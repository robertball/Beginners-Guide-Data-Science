I make this at least once a week! I use fresh basil and tomatoes out of my 
Garden. It is excellent with either fresh mozzarella, low moisture-
part skim or whole milk! It is great on the grill. I heat my oven to 450Â°
then when I put my pizza in the oven, I switch it to broil because I like
my cheese to brown.

In the oven in literally a couple of minutes and very good given how easy it is. If you don't have prosciutto use a little bacon or ham or whatever you have in the fridge. My sons liked this a lot and I liked just having the sliced tomato instead of a pizza covered in sauce.

A delicious and quick pizza! I made it with the mini Naans and only made 4, which was a bummer because me and my mom could have earn 3 each! A great quick lunch that taste like it took longer than 10mins to make!

Good recipe! If you brush the bread with olive oil and add minced garlic and bake for 8 minutes and then proceed with the rest of the steps, you can add sauce without it getting soggy- we did a sundried tomato pesto and crushed tomatoes as the base and it was great!

Very easy. I used what I had: I brushed the naan with coconut oil, then toasted the garlic on top in the broiler, topped with medium cheddar slices, sliced cherry tomatoes, grilled brown onion, ham, dried basil and black pepper. It was a big hit.

This was wonderful! We have also made this using pesto as a "sauce" with grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, fresh basil and mozzarella...The oven takes longer to preheat than this does to make...so many options...We like naan bread for pizza because of the portion control and everyone can pick/choose what they want...Thanks for sharing this!!

I made it tonight and it was very good. My grocery store doesn't carry prosciutto, so I used Black Forest ham from their deli counter. Its a bit less salty than Prosciutto, so I think a few olives would have balanced it out. Next time...

Easy and delicious! My husband said the prosciutto smelled like road kill and refused to eat any on his pizza :( Next time I'll just use bacon. It's cheaper anyway.

Made a few. One with olive oil and two with pizza sauce. Both were good! We used bacon that we cooked up beforehand. It came out tasty. Will do again!

It was simple and delicious. I used a sauce, though.

Instead of brushing with olive oil I brushed it with pesto, which had plenty of oil in it.  Layered the cheese, the tomatoes, the basil and MMMMM GOOD!

This was so easy to pull together. I keep Naan bread in the freezer for convenience, so I did toast that slightly.  I also panfried the prosciutto, as we prefer it crispy.  Next time, I may experiment by adding goat cheese and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  Thanks for sharing.

We really like this recipe and I have already fixed it a few times since I discovered it last month. 
 I'm always on the look out for easy "retirement" dishes to have while watching a movie.  In Maine right now (mid-winter) it's very hard to find fresh herbs but these days we are fortunate to have fresh herbs in a tube (puree), I mix this with the ild and "smashed, minced garlic") and brush this on the Naan. I follow the rest of the recipe as written but then add a sprinkle of dried sage, it goes so well with the prosciutto!   Thanks for the recipe!
