I was looking for a dish without the "cream of" soup and this was absolutely delicious! Everyone raved! I did replace the canned beans for fresh(steam for 5 minutes first, to soften before adding to recipe) I also replaced the onion with mushrooms because I wanted to put french fried onions on top, so it would be more like a traditional Thanksgiving dish. This recipe will definitely be part of our holiday tradition.

I opted to try a variation on the tried and true green bean casserole printed on the Durkee fried onion canister. Nobody ate these. Too much stuffing, needed more flavor. I guess I'm used to the old cream of mushroom soup. Oh well, I tried...

I made this recipe to bring to my sister's house for Christmas dinner this week.  Everyone loved it and asked me to make it again for next year.  I changed a couple of things:  I decreased the sugar by half and also decreased the onion by about a third.  I added some ground black pepper, a little garlic, and I used Stove Top stuffing instead of homemade.  I might try homemade stuffing next year. I used frozen green beans that I thawed and drained.  I didn't find them to be too crunchy at all, but I hate canned vegetables so maybe that's why.

My family really disliked the traditional green bean casserole recipe so I tried this recipe last year as an alternative. They loved this version and it was the only item that there weren't any leftovers for. This year I am doubling the recipe to make sure we get leftovers. :)

Much better than the traditional green bean casserole.  I made this both at the holidays and when my family was in town visiting, and everyone that has tried it loves it.  I also thought that the beans were a little crunchy for my taste, but my family wouldn't change it.

I think I would have rather used canned green beans, the frozen ones were just a little too crunchy for my taste.

I tried this recipe 4 years ago, in an attempt to create a traditional Thanksgiving menu for my family.  To be honest, I hated it.  I have refused to eat it again; however, my family thinks it's fantastic.  Go figure.  I make it every year for my family...I just get my veggies somewhere else!

I hate reviewing recipes that I have changed around because I do like to stay true to the recipes most of the time, but in this case I figured I would share how mine turned out anyway.  I used fresh green beans and after finding that my shredded cheddar was moldy :0 I used shredded swiss.  The swiss flavor was amazing in the recipe and the sauce was so delicious!  I kept everything else the same and for me this recipe was much too little to fit into a 9 by 13 dish.  I actually poured it in there and it was so thin that I poured it into a round 2 quart dish which worked perfectly.  I used cubed seasoned stuffing and only had to use 1 1/2 cup to adequately cover my dish.  The flavor of this recipe is wonderful! I'm sure it would taste great as written with the cheddar and will try it with cheddar next time, but the swiss really does mesh well with the other flavors.  A new favorite side dish here!

Absolutely delicious and much better than the Campbell's recipe. I was looking for a fresh version since I have sensitivities to MSG and other preservatives in processed goods. I altered this recipe by adding fresh mushrooms and celery with the onion. The first time I made it I didn't have sour cream so I just used regular whipping cream. Either way it's phenomenal.

We used this recipe for something different t our Thanksgiving table! I don't typically like greenbean casserole with the condensed soup mix so this take on the casserole was great! It was creamy, but not too much. I will change the stuffing topping as it was dry. I may make my own bread crumbs by cutting up white bread into squares, tossing it in melted butter, and adding that to the top next time. Great and easy recipe to make!

I thought this recipe is a good alternative to the traditional green bean casserole.  I'm not a fan of mushroom soup, so I had been looking for a recipe for green bean casserole that didn't involve that ingredient.  Everyone loved this dish and there were not many leftovers.    The one change I made to this recipe was instead of using dry stuffing mix to top the dish, I used french fried onions.

We don't especially like green bean casseroles, but we were asked to bring it for thanksgiving and it was a hit ! We were asked to bring it the following week for our Bible Study. The best part is that we were asked to bring it by a high school aged girl !

It has a great flavor.  I would just change the stuffing mix  from 2 cups to a sprinkle over the top.

The first time I tried this recipe, it wasn't so great. However, I did love the sauce, so I decided to give it another try. This time I used canned French style green beans in place of frozen. That made a huge difference. I also added mushrooms and added French's onion to the stuffing mix. Next time I think I will omit the stuffing mix and just use French's.

Great Recipe.  Wanted something different from the usual green bean casserole, and this was it.  Made it at my Thanksgiving dinner and it was surely the crowd favorite.  The only change i made was, i left out the onion and flour part...and instead, put the french onions on top of the stuffing before putting it in oven.  Will certainly make this again.

I absolutely hated this recipe.  This sounds strange after awarding it a 4-star rating?  Well, I rated it based on the other 7 people at the Thanksgiving dinner table.  They all loved it, including two kids.  So while I will not eat it, I've made this recipe for the last 4 Thanksgivings.

First try turned out pretty good and was a crowd pleaser for many who have not ever enjoyed the mushroom soup version.  Only four stars as I'll add some more spicing and cook a bit longer next time.

I made this two times. Once as the recipe directed and the next time with mushrooms and a few more spices. Neither time did I love it despite using quality ingredients (ie, organic beans from Trader Joes).

This was delicious! Everyone loved this dish at the holidays. I have been learning more about cooking in recent years and have been trying many new recipes. This required some work, and I used fresh green beans for the recipe, but this was well worth the effort. So wonderful! Rich, and delicious.

I was looking for something different to do with an abundance of home canned green beans...this recipe did the job!!  I used 1 qt. and 1 pint of beans (drained) and followed the recipe except for the topping.  I am not a big fan of boxed stuffing so I used the cheddar style french onions on top.  Everyone loved them and the flavor was so much better with the homemade sauce...than the more traditional soup method.  This one's a keeper!

This is a great way to liven up everyday GB cassarole. This was great. I used french fried onions instead of bread cumbs, canned italian flat greenbeans, and fresh mushrooms. Yummy, I will make this year after year. Totally better than the soup can recipe!!!!

I made this dish as a sub to the original green bean casserole due to mushroom allergies.  I gave this 4 stars (rather than 5) not based on taste.  This dish tastes amazing!  I did make some alterations though.  I doubled the recipe.  I substituted the onion for french fried onions.  And I topped with french fried onions instead of stuffing.  The thing I'll do different next time is actually mix it into the green beans.  It cooked as a cheesy layer on top and did not sink into the beans and seemed a little too thick (maybe I shouldn't have doubled the flour).  Other than the seperate layers, this was a good dish!

The frozen green beans weren’t as appealing as I would have expected. Also did not use the stuffing on top. Thought it would be too much with the stuffing I served with dinner. Might try it again with fresh green beans.

This recipe is very similar to one that is in an old Weight Watchers magazine I have, which I think is much better then this one. It uses swiss cheese and doesn't have as much sugar and onion.
