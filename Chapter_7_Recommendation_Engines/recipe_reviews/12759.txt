This recipe was wonderful after I added seasoning salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the batter. I did not serve it with a salsa but rather a mix of chopped tomatoes, cilantro and onion (no juices) and made a sauce of mayo, lime juice, fresh crushed garlic, diced jalapeno, and chili powder. The sauce and that bit of flavor punch makes all the difference. Add some shredded jack cheese to the tacos too!

I had a hankering for a fish taco and found this recipe.  I thought it was great - only thing I would add is that it lacked "zip" so I think the next time I make it I will add some spice...

I have used this recipe many times since finding it here. You have to adjust spices to your liking, but the easiest part is remembering that beer to flour ratio is about equal parts. Dry your fish with paper towels and dredge in flour first before the batter.. fries up very nicely! I make a tarter sauce with mayo, pickle relish (sweet), lemon or lime juice, cayenne pepper & cumin. This is awesome!! I've been on a fish kick since finding it.. I'm ready for some more soon. Cod or Haddock are great..

This is delicious!  Having moved from just NORTH of the border to the midwest, I have a craving for fish tacos regularly.  This recipe is exactly like they are made in so cal.  It does lack zip, but so do the authentic ones from Mexico!  The beauty of not putting the spices  in the batter is to ADD spice to each individual's liking AFTER.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

I made this the other night and wonderful doesn't even describe how good these where! I used Bud Light for the beer because thats what I had on hand. I also used tilapia fish. Instead of just mayo for the white sauce I mixed equal parts of sour cream and mayo and a dash of cumin and about a tsp of lime juice. I also made my own tomitillo salsa and pico de gallo. These were better then the tacos you can buy out. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe--the beer batter is delicious.  It was a very different taste, but we really enjoyed it with spicy salsa.

I used tilapia fillets for my fish tacos.  I didn't have any dark beer on hand so I used lite beer.  Also, I dressed my cabbage up a bit with mayo, lime and some chopped onion. The fish fillets came out nice and crispy.  Next time I might add cayenne pepper to the batter for the adults that like it spicy. Thanks for sharing !

I used tilapia to make my fish tacos and they were delicious.  I made my own simple tartar sauce (mayo, relish, lemon juice) and added chili powder to the mixture.  I also sprinkled a bit of Rose's lime juice on each taco which ended up being a great addition.  Definitely try it!

I tried this recipe on Ash Wednesday of this week, my family & I had never had fish tacos before. These were so easy to make and so good! Even my kids enjoyed them! I did not have cabbage, so I used shredded lettuce instead, the results were still delicious. I will make these again for sure!

I thought these were pretty great. I added some cumin, cayenne pepper, and fresh cilantro to the batter mix and it was a nice little kick. Pretty easy to make, though frying in small batches took a while. I also just used flour tortillas as that was what we had on hand as well as lettuce instead of cabbage. I also made a fruit salsa with pineapple, dried mango, the juice of an orange and a lime, and some cilantro and mint. Very tasty. Oh yes, I also mixed half sour cream and half mayonnaise as I'm not a huge fan of plain mayo. Very good with a great response from the S.O., and I had never even had fish tacos before!

This is a good basic recipe to use as a starting point, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs more seasoning. I also felt the batter was too thin and thickened it by using 1 c. flour to 3/4 c. beer. Then added ground red pepper for heat, about 2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper and some onion powder for seasoning and served it as fish tacos with my favorite "tartar sauce" coleslaw - Yum!

A necessary addition that we see here in Texas is some chopped fresh cilantro mixed with the cabbage - amount to your liking.

I made this beer batter for my tilapia that I wanted to deep fry in oil...the batter was great on the fish.  I just cubed up the tilapia, dipped it in the batter, and then deep fried in hot oil till golden.  :o)  I did not use the rest of the recipe though...so, I'm really only giving the beer batter the stars!

I love these fried Fish Tacos, so good. I swear I was ordering it right out of a Taco stand. No changes here. Made it for supper and I'll continue to make again. Added some hot sauce and lemon on top of the fish just before devouring it.   YUM  :=)

The batter is totally yummy as long as you season to taste.  I added cayenne, garlic powder and onion powder.  As for the dressing, I made a mixture of Mayo, lime juice, chipotle peppers, garlic powder and salt.  I got rave reviews!!  I served it up with jack cheese, angel hair cabbage, lime wedges and red onions.  They were fantastic!

This is a pretty close version of a real fish tacofound in Mexico and California.  They are not supposed to be spicy but to each his own.  I also mix the mayo with a little pickle relish and lime juice and then squeeze fresh lime juice on the assembled taco before eating.  That's how they are typically served in SoCal.  Pair with refried beans, rice and some tortilla chips and you can't tell the difference between this meal and one served at LaSalsa!  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband & I loved this recipe. After reading some comments about needing something. I opted to add Old Bay and season salt. Kids ate everything. It's a keeper. Thanks for helping me cook like a pro!

These were great. The only problem I had was with the mayo. I added a little ground chipotle to the mayo and it brought these up to 5 stars. I cut the fish to fit the tortillas I was using.

This was good.  Will reccommend.  Used halibut instead of cod.  It was very tasty.  Goes good with a glass of ice tea.

Excellent recipe! My husband and I make these regularly. They don't lack zip at all if you use spicy salsa (try Green Mountain Gringo Hot) and a healthy dousing of lime juice.

These were perfectly fine but I didn't like the mayo part- needed something better.  Haven't found a better sauce yet but I prefered tartar sauce to the mayo.

I made these tonight, and they were delicious! I used green salsa, and put balsamic dressing on the cabbage instead of using mayonnaise - so quick and easy!

OMG!!! Loved these. Hubby did the whole thing, said it was easy. Instead of just mayo he mixed it with sour cream and some seasoning. So yummy. The worst part was getting rid of the oil afterward.

Very good, fast and tasty.  I would not cube the cod before frying.  The batter seemed to just fall off.

I was expecting a fluffy crispy batter and was I disappointed. Although I seasoned the flour because of other recommendations,  that did not help. After coating and cooking the tilapia, the consistency of the batter was  thick and blah. Won't try this again.

Yummy! I added a little more salt, pepper and some spices that I had around the cupboard (dill, thyme), but not really necessary. I also added onions to fry along with the fish. Thanks for this tasty recipe. :)

Loved these! A few minor changes to thin the batter a little and they were a huge hit, even for my husband who doesn't really like fish!!
Definitely will make again!

I've made a recipe similar to this for years. I use Tempura instead of flour though; also I add a few sprinkles of Cheyenne pepper to the mayonnaise, along with a little lime juice to add a zing. It makes it more like a dressing to add to the tacos.  I also top it with shredded cheddar cheese.

This is a good basic recipe. After reading the reviews I added ingredients for flavor. Here are the changes I made.  Instead of cod I used Telapia. For the beer I used XX Amber. I also added, lime juice, pepper, cayenne pepper, cummin, and seasoning salt to the batter.  To the Mayo mix I added Chille/lemon powder, a splash of milk (dilutes the mayo taste a bit), salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic (i used the already minced from a jar garlic), and lime juice.  Instead of salsa, I cut up some onions, tomatoes, and cilantro.  My husband added pace salsa to his tacos but I prefer home made salsa.  I also heated up tortillas for 45 seconds in the microwave. I had them covered with a wet paper towel before I put them in. All in all... very delicious. It was a definite hit with the husband.

I halved the recipe as I has 12 oz of Icelandic cod. The batter definitely needs seasoning, I added 1/4 tsp salt would use 1/2 tsp next time, I also added some homemade salt free Taco Seasoning I. I used Stella Artois for the beer as it was what we had. We really enjoyed the fish, would definitely make again. I used Fish Taco SAuce on the tacos instead of the sauce listed.

terrible way to cook fish.  I'll never make it again.  super bland, the batter really doesn't stick to the fish because of the consistency.  

awful...

I made the batter as instructed and tweaked the fish with some seasonings. It was great, I used the Baja sauce and it was very good.

Loved this recipe :) I tweaked it to accommodate what I had on hand and a budget. I had a summer ale on hand instead of dark beer. I used frozen Tilapia (Aldi's) as it was cheaper  and seasoned it with Old Bay Spice,  used a coleslaw blend in place of the cabbage (had on hand). I also mixed the coleslaw blend with the mayo, lime juice, and seasonings instead of serving it up as separate condiments. We liked the flavor it gave the taco without adding extra stuff to the dish and still have the crunch of the coleslaw mix.
