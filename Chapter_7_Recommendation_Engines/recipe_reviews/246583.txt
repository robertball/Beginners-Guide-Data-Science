I have become a fish convert after trying this recipe.  I like a little heavier batter so I dredged the fish in the dry mix (after preparing batter - just put aside some of the mix) before putting the fish in the moist batter.  Delicious!  Trying to eat more fish and this recipe makes it easier.

I have never been a big fan of battered fish, but the 5 star rating caused me to try this recipe. My wife and I both loved it. The fish turned out flakey and delicious. I had to change my opinion of battered fish. If you like fried fish you need to try this recipe!

This is the best batter I have found. I use a dark beer for flavor and it gives the fish a golden color. I dry the fish on paper towels and salt them before dipping in the batter. If you like a thinner batter, add a splash more of beer, if you like thicker batter then don't add as much beer. I also fry the fish at 375 degrees and drain them before placing in a pan lined with paper towels.

This was a simple and delicious dish. Though the cod tasted good, my beer batter mix had fallen off my frozen cod when I fried it. Maybe I should've split it in halves to make for easy dipping. I forgot to add the Old Bay seasoning too.  I'll make it again and hope to get it right.

This is so good. Just like the fish I ate as a child in R.I. every Friday. Onion rings are also good with this batter.

I know this not exactly "home made", but my kids love this recipe!  We use the batter fir chicken, mushrooms, and more.
