My husband thought they reminded him of fried ice cream. Even a few family members who don't like peanut butter flavored dessert enjoyed them. Wax paper is a must if you don't want to be fighting getting them out. These could become anything with different toppings. We really enjoyed them and have a few leftover for the freezer for another day.

This is awesome since you can put any kind of sweet thing on/in the ice cream like fruit or chocolate/fudge syrup or caramel or strawberries or pineapple or coconut. Remember to use wax paper when you make them. They are easier to work with and cut out into pieces. They sound simple and boring but they are great in almost any form.
