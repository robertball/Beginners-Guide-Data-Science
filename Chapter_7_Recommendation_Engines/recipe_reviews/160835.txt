Delicious!  I made this for a picnic and used farfelle (bowtie) pasta.  Next time I'll add a little less olive oil - maybe 1/4 cup.

This was an easy recipe full of fresh flavors. I used fusilli pasta just as a personal preference. The whole thing went together quickly and easily. Thanks, AR, for another hit!
