It was my mom's birthday, who is medicated for high cholesterol, and my sister, who has recently determined she is lactose intolerant, was joining us for dinner.  Hmmm...cholesterol-free, low-fat, dairy-free cake...sounds...icky.  However, I made this cake. It took an incredibly short amount of time to prepare, and I had most of the ingredients in my kitchen (and others are inexpensive and easy to find).  I put it on a wicker "plate" and decorated it with flowers and it looked like a little country birthday cake.  IT WAS A HIT!  Everyone in my family had multiple servings and wanted the recipe.

This cake was delicious.  I am glad to see a recipe for those with allergies that actually tastes GOOD! This was the first cake I ever made and It turned out looking great, tasted great, and smelled great too. The batter was yummy. I baked this cake for 55 minutes and it was slightly dry.  Next time I will try 50 minutes and it should be perfect!  This recipe was great but I would not really call it a cake.  To me it was more like a dessert bread.  It was baked in a loaf pan and it seemed like a sweet bread instead of a cake. Maybe next time I could double the ingredients and put it in a round cake pan to seem more like an actual cake.

This cake was surprisingly good, I'm glad I made it! I followed the directions, and chose not to add the almonds, although I did add the almond extract.
