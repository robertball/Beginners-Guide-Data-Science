I have made this several times and people are shocked by how tasty it is (even those who don't want fruit for dessert).  Great for casual entertaining and perfect when you want to impress at a more formal dinner.

I had a friend who hated cake and I made this instead for her birthday.  It was a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved it!!  It was also great for me, because I don't know how to cook...at ALL!  This recipe was as easy as pie!

I used 1/2 cup of apricot preserves because I couldn't glaze the fruit with 1/4. I also warmed the preserves on the stove.  The first batch I tried to warm in the microwave - bad idea.

SO GOOD!!!!!  I made it for Valentine's Day dessert!  It was a hit and so easy!!  I am making it again tonight and the only think I am changing is adding the fruit and the glaze.  The strawberries tasted and looked a little funny after it sat overnight in fridge.  So tonight I will add fruit and whipped cream as I serve it!  I also used a pre-made choc. pie crust!!

This recipe is completely foolproof in the hands of an amateur. I should know.  My vanilla cookies were not completely crumbled, my fruit design was a mess.  It completely fell apart when I was trying to serve it.  But it was SOOOOOOOO delicious.  We will definitely try this again!  The best part was the cocoa cream cheese middle layer, I left the sugar out and I did not miss it.  This is a fabulous recipe.  Thanks!

I made this with the reduced fat vanilla wafers and lite cream cheese. It tastes just as good and takes an edge off the calories. Love that the chocolate isn't overwhelming! Fabulous recipe!

This tart was delicious... I took it to a party and it was a hit.  But, the crust was very hard and difficult to neatly cut... so the slices were very broken and messy on the plates.

This was a fabulous recipe. Make sure you eat it the first night or else the fruit will go brown.

I made this yesterday for my friend's birthday and everybody was so impressed! The recipe says to use a 12" pizza pan - I used an 11" tart pan, but one package of cream cheese wasn't enough... it only covered 3/4 of the pan with only a thin layer. I bought another package of cream cheese and it was perfect.

REALLY tasty recipe and highly recommended! The best part is that it's a no-bake recipe so clean up is really simple. I used a 9-inch round cake pan instead (didn't have a pizza pan)and it worked out perfectly. Crust was a perfect thickness and the amount of cheesecake was just right. If using a cake pan, however, remember to decrease the amount of fruit. I used 1/2 pint of strawberries, 3/4 peach. 3 kiwis, and blueberries. I added about 1-2 tbsp of water to thin out the apricot preserves. Excellent recipe and will definitely make it again.

The only change I made was using a store-bought graham cracker crust.  The whole family loved it!
