I actually made this for a picnic, planning to serve it cold.  It had a beautiful taste, and I reallly enjoyed it.  There were a few things I changed the next time I made it: 1. I steam the kale separately, to keep the vitamin content.  2. I swapped the vegan sausage for chunks of kielbasa instead (I am not a vegetarian). 3. I used ditalini pasta.  

The four stars is because I didn't like the kale boiled, and is for the original recipe, and not when I changed it.  This makes a great main course (hot or cold) or a great side dish).  Even without the sausage it has a beautiful flavour.  Excellent dish!

i really enjoyed this meal. i steamed the kale as suggested by one review and used that liquid to add to finished product. next time i make this i will cook in cherry tomatoes and mushrooms with the onions bc it was a little dry. i will also dilute the veggie broth i use to cook the lentils. i used some kind of tofu italian sausage and that worked great. i didn't have fresh herbs but the dried ones sufficed. i think this would also be good with goat cheese/feta.

My husband loved the flavors.  Like another reviewer, the red lentils came out mushy but aside from texture, the taste was still good.  I would say the prep time is not 30 min.  I had the entire dish done in about 30 min--I almost didn't make the recipe b/c of the approx time so even if you are short on time, you can still make this dish.

Very delicious recipe, easy to make.  I did not do the sausage and actually instead of the vegetable broth I just used water.  I added my own spices, such as seasoned salt and garlic salt and onion powder along with everything else....very good.

Yum! I tried this recipe with a few modifications and it was delicious and hearty. To boil the lentils, I used 2 cups chicken broth, 1/2 cup white wine, 2 cloves of garlice, and about 3/4 cups water. This kept it moist when I mixed everything together.   I also added broccoli and mushrooms, and steamed the kale based on other reviews. I added some adobo and a little curry powder. Instead of vegan sausage I used Bob Evan's sage sausage (sorry, not vegan but good!)  These tweaks just suited my taste buds better. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was an excellent, crowd-pleasing dish! I was having a bunch of guests over and it was perfect - full of flavor (but not spicy) and sutiable for pretty much every dietary preference. I generally followed the recipe, with a few exceptions. I doubled it so it made 8 portions rather than 4, but it could have served 10 with no problem. Luckily, it keeps well and even tastes good cold, so the leftovers have been great. I didn't add vegan sausage and put in 2 roma tomatoes and 12 oz of mushrooms, as one user suggested. It worked well, definitely putting in 2 or 3 more tomatoes next time (if I'm doubling it again). And make sure to cook the pasta al dente. Maybe it was just because I had to wait before serving, but the pasta became a little mushy after everything was mixed together and sitting on the stove on low heat for a while. My guests all loved it and I'm definitely making it again!

Great flavors, but there are some things that I will change next time!  I used red lentils, which turned mushy; green ones would probably be better!  Red onion looks nice for presentation, but quickly turns to a brownish gray, so I will cook with a yellow onion, and garnish with chopped red onions. Whole wheat rotini was not available, so I subbed with whole wheat noodles, and they worked out fine.  This made an enjoyable meal!

I was going to try this recipe and then saw that there were 732 calories per serving.  That's a lot and looking at the ingredients, I don't see how that can be.  Even with olive oil and vegan sausage, it shouldn't be that much.

Everyone in my family loved this, including the 1, 4, and 6 year olds! Easily adaptable, we spooned the lentils and kale over fresh biscuits instead of adding pasta. Delicious!

I really recommend this dish.  I think the flavor is more delicious as a hot dinner than cold, but it can definitely be eaten either way.  I used fresh herbs from my garden along with Tofurkey Italian vegan sausage, and it was delicious. I love the fact it uses both lentils and the vegan sausage, making a high protein dish.  Thank you so much for posting!

I made this with a few adjustments: cut the pasta in half (I think you could leave it out completely), substituted ground pork for the vegan sausage and chicken broth for the vegetable broth, added tomatoes and mushrooms, and use dried instead of fresh herbs. Use extra liquid as the lentils will continue to soak it up. Delicious and heated up well for leftovers - my husband and I both loved it.

We just finished eating this for supper. Everyone enjoyed it! My only change was to add garlic to the onion/sausage mixture, decrease the oil to about 2 Tablespoons, and use turkey sausage. Will make again.

This is a delicious, hearty vegan recipe.  I used baby kale (Costco) and just chopped it a bit and added it to the onion/sausage mixture during the last minute or so. As a shortcut, I skipped step 1 and used Trader Joe's pre-prepared lentils.  Will definitely make this again.

This came out very tasty, although I tweaked it a bit to make it healthier.
I used quinoa instead of pasta and cubed, roasted butternut squash instead of sausage.  I also added a chopped tomato and some fresh garlic to the saute mixture and topped the dish with a small sprinkle of feta cheese.

I made this tonight for dinner and I thought it was very good.  I did have to add extra veggie broth to the lentils to keep them moist while I was waiting on the pasta to cook, so definitely keep enough on hand.  

I used Gimme Lean! veggie sausage in the onion mixture, and it turned out great!  I would recommend.

This was SO good! My kids even had seconds! The only change I made was to add shiitake mushrooms and add a bit more veggie broth to the finished product to keep it moist. I will absolutely be making this again! :)

I loved this. It was pretty easy and very tasty. It was better the second day, and thereafter. Needed salt.

Good but to much macaroni for my tastes.  Will add less the next time I make it.  Overall very tasty vegan recipe.

I made this with a spicy vegan chorizo from Trader Joe's, and red lentils. It was excellent -- but on the spicy side!

I followed other reviewers suggestions of steaming the kale. I omitted the sausage, but added mushrooms and cherry tomatoes instead. I think the cherry tomatoes & mushrooms gave off enough liquid, because I didn't need to use any pasta water. Added some red pepper flake to the onion. And also added a lot of white wine to the lentils while cooking. Yum. Will try over brown rice in the future to change things up.

Loved it! I used Field Roast Italian Sausage and served it to my vegetarian and meat eating family and they loved it, too! This is more a testament to Field Roast, but they almost didn't believe it was vegan. Good work!

This was as amazing as everyone said it would be!  The only changes I made was that I used dried spices and I used vegetable broth to cook the onion rather than oil, and it didn't lose anything other than fat and calories!  (Hubby did use parmesan rather than the nutritional yeast I used.)
Definitely a saver to make again.  Satisfying, tasty, easy- the trifecta!

This was good. I did make some minor changes / exchanges. I replaced the pasta with quinoa, the kale with spinach, and the vegan sausage with chicken sausage. To give it a little spice we added cayenne pepper. This is a good recipe to play with. We look forward to making it again.

I will try again and steam the kale apart from the pasta. I will add more spices to the lentils and not drain them before mixing in. I will also use white or yellow onion to saute instead of red, since the red browns and doesn't look appetizing. I'm not giving up on this one since my kids liked it as is, but they picked out the kale.

I didn't attempt to cook the kale.  I used 1/2 a box of baby kale instead of preparing myself.  Then, when I combined pasta, onion mix & lentils, I added kale. I let it wilt for a minute & then dished out.  I also used dried spices.  It was great!  I was surprised I liked it at all, but this is very well seasoned.

Grabbed a bag of red lentils and a bunch of kale and came home and checked to see what I could do with them.  Decided to go with this recipe and how happy I am!  I didn't bother with sausage.  This is so good!  Very satisfying.  Would work great with chicken.  Only thing different I did from recipe is I added some diced tomatoes as others suggested.  I'm not vegan but this could convert me!

I just made this tonight and it was surprisingly good. The lentils turned out mushy just like some other reviewers stated but I didn't mind the texture. The one thing I would change is the amount of olive oil. The recipe calls for a little too much to my liking. I would cut that in half and add as needed to cook the onions. Will definitely make this again.

This really was delicious.  I've never put lentils with pasta before, but it makes a good combination.  I don't like most vegan sausages, so I added about a pound of sauteed mushrooms instead(for extra bulk and "meatiness").  I also added a couple of minced shallots for extra oomph. I sauteed the kale in about 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil instead of boiling or steaming, and it was great.  I'd make this again and I'm not a vegan, or even a vegetarian.  Five stars.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Of course, I did personalize a bit. instead of taking time to cook the lentils, I added a can of drained chick peas. I also added lots of fresh garlic and steamed the kale over top of the sausage & onion mixture.  Delish!

I steamed the kale separately.  Used brown lentils and vegetarian bouillon cubes. Added mushrooms and sliced grape tomatoes. Used field roast apple sage vegan sausage. Mixed in organic tri-colored quinoa instead of pasta. Delish!

Fantastic.  Just made this for the first time. Something I will continue to make.  I will try steaming the kale instead of boiling them next time and adding cherry tomatoes at the end may add some color.  I didn't need to add any of the reserved liquid.  Everything came out perfect.
