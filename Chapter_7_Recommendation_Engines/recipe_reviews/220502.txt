It was great! I love the Irish-Mex combo! Served it with some roasted red pepper and on a bed of brown rice and it was a hit. Thanks for the recipe!

We don't have fresh tomatillos in Australia, so I had to use canned. 
I also didn't have lager so I used beef stock.  A few little changes but not too many.  
It was fabulous!
I served it with a bean and avocado salsa and brown rice.  
Husband loved it and took the leftovers for work the next day.
Great meal to do in the slow cooker, absolutely delicious.

Made this for a dinner party. Absolutely delicious! Served as a stew with Queso Fresco and Parmesan Crostini. A definite hit!
