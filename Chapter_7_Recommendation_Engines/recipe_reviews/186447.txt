This turned out great.  I made several changes to make it more healthy: -half white and half brown sugar -added 1/2c ground flax seed -added 1c walnuts -used half white and half wheat flour -used 1c applesauce plus 1/2c oil instead of 1 1/2c oil Also, I had no fresh strawberries so I mashed with a potato masher 16 oz of frozen strawberries partial strained

Looking over the recipe, I was sure that 1-1/2 cups of oil would be too much. I also thought 1 T. of cinnamon and 1-1/4 pounds of strawberries would be too much. Indeed, when I mixed up the batter I was sure my suspicions were true.  The batter is very thick, and almost looks oily. I suspect it is the juices from the strawberries that provide the extra moisture the batter seemed to need. It all came together to produce a moist, beautiful bread, full of strawberry flavor, and just the right hint of cinnamon. What did NOT work was the size of the pans called for. When I looked at the batter in the bowl I just knew I would need bigger pans, and as it turned out the 8x4" pans I used were just right. I prepared this exactly as written and believe it needs no changes or tinkering. And the sprinkle of oatmeal on the top is a great finish!

This was very tasty! Next time I think I would use half brown sugar/half white. Also...I added walnuts...and it as spectacular!

I tried this recipe with the same motivation its creator had: aging strawberries! And I'm really pleased with the results!  No major changes, but here they are:  Cut the sugar to 1 c. white, 1/2 c. brown.  Added the walnuts per the other suggestions.  I used 1 c. oil and 1/2 c. plain yogurt.  Oh, and I didn't have 7X3 loaf pans.  But, nevertheless, it worked nicely with an 8X4 and 12 regular sized muffins.

I halved this recipe as I only wanted to make one loaf.  I'm glad I did--not bc this bread is bad but bc it is awesome and I don't need to eat it!  It's only downfall is that it's crumbly where the strawberries are, but I can so deal with that bc the taste is wonderful.  You can definitely taste the strawberries and the bread is slightly sweet--not too sweet at all.  It lets the oatmeal and strawberries shine.   I was a bit worried about the batter as it was so thick.  The strawberries were a bit difficult to fold in but once I did it was fine.  I did have to bake about 25 min longer, but I had overripe strawberries and I tossed in a few more than called for, so that would easily account for that.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was easy to make, and perfect for strawberries that needed to be used. Slicing them worked great because there weren't any really soggy spots in the finished product, a problem I've had with other recipes that called for the berries to be chopped. I made the recipe as is, and found it was just sweet enough. I think using brown sugar may make it richer-tasting, but it's not necessary.

Super yummy but the batter was SO thick. I halved the recipe but next time I'll just do whatever it says because all I really did was create a half loaf, Instead of oil I used strawberry yogurt took out all the sugar and created a cinnamon swirl though the bread just kinda sucked it back in. Oh yeah when you're adding the oat mixture on top make sure to wet them first unless you want dry oatmeal crumbs on top, haha. As I said earlier Yummy!

This was good.  I changed it a bit based on what I had at home.  I used brown sugar instead of white and I used 100% strawberry preserves instead of fresh strawberries.  I cut the oil by 2/3.  I also made muffins instead of bread.  My family enjoyed it.

This tastes great! I think I will play with the recipe a bit, the 1 1/2C oil was just too much for my liking. I think I will try applesauce as previously suggested. Also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and I liked that a lot, this time around I might use splenda instead of the white sugar.

My first thought was to double check the amount of oil…seemed like a lot…but I followed the recipe and although the batter sure was thick it did bake well.  I altered pan size to make 2 9x5 loafs and reduced temp to 325 in convection oven.  The loaves turned out well, although a bit crumbly where the strawberries were..next time I might try to mash the berries a bit..The cinnamon in this makes your kitchen smell lovely.

Strawberry bread is one of my favorite quick breads and I've tried a lot of different recipes. This is one of the best. As suggested by other users I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar, I also used 1 c. coconut oil and 1/2 c. yogurt in substitution for vegetable oil. I added flax seeds and used 4 c. of strawberries. Excellent. Moist. Not too sweet and great strawberry flavor. This will become my go-to recipe for strawberry bread. Thanks for sharing.

I made this as a 6-serving batch of Oatmeal Strawberry Muffins instead. Subbed vanilla yogurt for sugar + oil, and used about 8 oz. sliced strawberries instead. Mixed a bit of brown sugar with the dampened oats for topping, which created a delicious streusel. Came out quite savory for me, so if you want something sweet, don't leave out the sugar in the batter. Overall, yummy!

Very good. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, only used 1 and 1/3 cups of sugar and used 1/2 whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier and it still tasted good.

This came out like two enormous strawberry oatmeal breakfast bars.  It slices really well.  Amazing.  I tried it per the recipe (1.5 c raw sugar) but I think I'll try the puree version and try to reduce the sugar further.  This was really, really thick going into the oven.  I think it has to sort of melt together.  Freezes really well.

Yummy! We made this close to the original recipe (subbed oat flour and reduced the sugar per our habit). It was delicious, moist, and still addictively sweet with lowered sugar. Like others said, this recipe is a great way to use well ripened berries. We love it. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

Delicious sweet bread! I used a bit more cinnamon. I will use the suggested substitution (from other cooks)for the oil. There's too much oil in the bread. You can't tell when it is baked, however, when placed in pans before baking, the oil oozes to the sides. I used several paper towels to dab the oil. I will definitely try  1 c.applesauce and 1/4-1/2 c. oil next time. Other than that, this recipe is a keeper!

Ended up being a great recipe; however I changed a few things to make it healthier. I substituted egg whites for 3 of the eggs, substituted half a cup of unsweetened apple sauce for half a cup of the vegetable oil, and cut the sugar by 25%.

I just baked the Oatmeal Strawberry Bread. It is DEVINE...so moist. I substituted 1 cup of the sugar with Splenda and used 1 cup applesauce and only 1/2 cup oil. I will definitely bake this again using different fruits. It is a must try for everyone. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Excellent Recipe: I did a vegan version that was super yummy.
Since it has not milk, the only substitution is for the eggs.  In general an excellent egg substitute that is frequently better than eggs in backing is: 1 Tbsp Ground Flax Seed, 3 Tbsp water per egg.  
Totaling 1/4 cup ground flax to 3/4 cup water in this recipe.  I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 a cup, and found it to be great- not lacking sweet flavor at all.  I had only frozen strawberries and no scale, so I blended them and put in a large quantity- can't tell you how much exactly.  Loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

Really good! made some subs. though. Half the oil and replaced with juice from the strawberries. Also I took the suggestion to use half white sugar and half brown. Didn't have enough strawberries thawed so i used raspberries as well, tastes great!

This was great, I've now made about 6 batches including muffins and mini loaves. Works great to substitute blueberries in place of strawberries and applesauce or strawberry puree instead of oil. I'm now going to make it again with both strawberries and blueberries for family.

I made MUFFINS! Pretty dang good! I followed the recipe except I just cannot put that much oil in something some I replaced 1 cup of oil with 1 cup of applesauce and added the 1/2 cup of oil.  I also put replaced a 1/3 of the flour with whole wheat flour.

I baked the muffins for 28 minutes at 350 degrees and they came out great! They would be perfect for an after school snack. I just didn't want a wait a hour...

Very yummy. I used blackberries ( sliced) and blueberries since I didn't have strawberries. Also, I listened to other review writers and replaced half of the veg oil with applesauce.

I was skeptical at first but it is a hit! I used half whole wheat flour, half white and replaces half the oil with strawberry purée. Pleased with the subs at I expected 1 1/2 c. oil to be too much. Will make again as my mom's fresh strawberries are coming on fast.

This was yummy and different! I made it for my Mother and she is a classic mid-western baker. She loved it! I also made it for my twin sisters who are special needs and participate in the "Special Olympics". I specifically made it for a fund raiser bake sale for their team and it was a hit! I made mini loafs and they sold out very fast! I too followed the advice of other reviewers, and substituted half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Thank you for sharing!

This had a great strawberry flavor. But, it was more like a cookie than bread.

You don't need to use so much sugar or oil. But I did make a few changes to make a healthy version of this bread. ok, here we go......Step 1: Mix 1 C miracle whip and 2 TBSP of sugar and 2 TBS brown sugar and one egg beaten. after mixing this together add cinnamon. then mix. add sliced strawberries ( I only had 8 on hand so then I also added 1 C strawberry jam.) add 1 TBSP of oil ( I only added this for good measure but next time I aint going to) Mix this altogether and now Step 2: add 1 C oats, mix. 2 C flour, 1-1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. Pour into greased pan. I used a round Wilton pan size 10X3. This turned out to be very moist! I dont even think I'm going to use any sugar or brown sugar next time.

I cut out 1/2 cup of oil, 1/2 cup of sugar and added some chopped walnuts.  Will definitely make this again.  It is a little crumbly around the strawberries, but no one complained.

Made 11 loaves for my friends and neighbors.. Everyone loved it!  I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup of applesauce.. This helps cut the fat and it was still a moist bread.

This turned out pretty well, but I will probably let it bake a little longer the next time.  My tester came out clean, but the bottom half is a little wetter than I expected.  I used a little less sugar and substituted 3/4 C dark brown sugar for white.  I also pureed some strawberries and used 1 cup puree for 1 cup of the oil.  A sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top was a nice finish.  This is a good way to use up an excess of strawberries.

I'm giving this 5 stars simply because it was that easy, and that delicious. I used steel cut oats, but soaking them first softened them up enough for cooking. It's a bit crumbly, but nothing eating with a fork couldn't fix! I froze the second loaf because it appears that we're on a mission to eat the first loaf until it's gone lol.

I honestly did not expect much from this recipe but it was great.  I only made one change because I ran out of white sugar.  I used half brown and half white sugar instead of all white.  Next time I might  try making it with whole wheat flour.  I will do and update if I do.

Fabulous! Used mods recommended by others: subbed 1 c brown sugar for 1 cup of the white sugar; used 1 c applesauce in place of a cup of the oil, used larger loaf pans. Baked for 60 minutes. Amazingly good with great strawberry flavor!!!

It didn't cook all the way through for me!  I made it exactly as directed.  I thought maybe it was my oven, so I turned the heat down, covered them with foil, and baked for another 20 minutes, then another 20, and another 20.  Still mushy on the inside!  Too bad too, the cooked portions were delicious.  I think I will try again, except bake it into muffin cups instead and see if that helps.

Good tasting but turned out kind of soggy/to moist. Will try again with a bit of adjustment. I subbed applesauce for the oil and brown sugar for part of the white sugar.

This was a tasty way to take care of berries about to go bad. I didn't have two loaf pans, so I made muffins with the remaining batter. I think I liked the muffins better. They are already individually portioned and they don't turn out quite as oily.

I don't know, I think this is simply too much oatmeal for our tastes.  No one liked this in our family, although I did learn that cinnamon goes well with strawberry though, so thanks for that!

So good! I love how moist the bread is. I made mini loaves and they turned out great. Baked for 25-30 minutes. The only change I made was subbing 1 cup of applesauce for 1 cup of the oil.

Very yummy. Made changes to make it healthier - did 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, 1 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil, and 1/2 whole wheat flour half all purpose. I would not recommend making it in one big pan... is way too thick...

These muffins have a lot of potential.  The one thing I REALLY didn't like was the amount of oil that goes into the original recipe.  I didn't like the idea of the standard applesauce substitute because, after all, this is STRAWBERRY bread.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and tried strawberry yogurt, for the full 1-1/2 cups.  My family and I really enjoyed the taste, but the muffins were very DENSE.....  I would like them to be more moist.  I would like to try other reviewers' suggestions to use pureed strawberries instead.....  I think this might increase the moisture content, without going back to all that oil.  Hope this helps!

I halved the recipe to make 1 loaf. I subbed half the flour with white wheat, used 2 duck eggs, and coconut oil for vegetable oil. I had never seen such a thick (could hardly stir) batter so I added a smidge of almond milk. I then decided to use a 9x9 pan instead of a loaf pan. It baked perfectly! A bit sweet, so I'll go with a bit less sugar next time. Great use for my rapidly ripening strawberries and I'll definitely make it again.

I used an 8x4 pan when it called for a 7x3 pan and it was still to small (not even using all the batter.) It went over the edges & middle wouldn't cook. Was disappointed I had to get rid of it. I will try it again though.

I followed the recipe exactly and my bread was not only dry, the top falls off when you invert the bread to take it out of the pan.

This was really good.  Loved the oats on top.  I weighed out the exact amount of berries, then held back because it seemed like way too much.  I must've been wrong, for when eating it, it seemed like a few more berries would have been good.  I can't wait to make this again.

This was so easy to make and sooooo good!! I had strawberries that would of gone bad on me and some cream cheese. I blended them together with some white sugar and some icing sugar and added it to the mix!! YUMMY!!!! I went lighter on the white sugar in the recipe and did use brown sugar. I also didn't add the cinnamon.
