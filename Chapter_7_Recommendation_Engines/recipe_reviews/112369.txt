This recipe rocks, not that I cook frog legs that much.  The only thing I suggest is cook longer than the suggested time on each side. I did at least 4 to 5 on each side. I served with a green salad and brown rice.

An awesome way to cook frog legs - I made no changes and we really enjoyed them. I did add some cornstarch-water slurry to the marinade/sauce while simmering, but that was just because we prefer it thicker. I have a whole freezer full of chicken but ignored it all when the grocer had these babies in on special - frog is a firmer white flesh like chicken breast with a yummy seafood flavor, and I'd suggest trying this recipe whether you have "spare frog legs for some reason" or not!

Just tried it tonight, incredibly easy to do and sooo good.

I used Tamari sauce instead of Soya sauce, it tastes the same. And instead of using all of the marinade for the legs, I reserved about 1/4 of a cup of it to use for the sauce in the end. I did reduce it like the recipe asked.

ROCK YOUR SOCKS OFF, FOR SURE!
Definitely marinate for at least an hour!  I used an egg-flour-egg-Panko crumb coating on ours.  Awesome!   So crunchy and tender!  Time is approximate: it depends on your exact cooking temperature and the size of the frog legs.  Mine were Jumbo, and took about 3 minutes per each of the four sides (if you only turn them once, they will take longer per side).  I like them browned all over.  Triple the sauce, use 1/3 to marinate (throw this away after use) Use other 2/3rds to make dipping sauce by adding cornstarch, a little at a time.  Will ABSOLUTELY make again and again!

Very good. My wife doesn't like eating meat off the bone but with this recipe she cleaned the frog legs clean! I took advice of other users and cooked the legs 4-5 minutes on each side. Some of the thicker frog legs definitely needed that long to cook all the way through. I also threw in some chopped onions in the pan and cooked them with the frog legs. The onions were very good, especially with the cooked marinade poured over the top.

Righteous recipe! I added a little toasted sesame oil and rice vinegar to the marinade and thickened it up a bit with some cornstarch. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I would not try them. Was NOT going to happen!! But my husband ate them. After he got over the appearance (they look like mini-people with extremely muscular calves), he said they "werent bad".

Very nice. Next time ill make more marinade as it was sooo good. I might use the sauce for chicken wings as well and add some hot sauce for a bit of heat.

The recipe is really good. However, I think you could accomplish the same thing with chicken, so I'm not going to give it 5 stars. If you have spare frog legs for some reason though, by all means use this recipe. :)

Made this for the first time. Suggest medium heat for 4-5 minutes per side.  Very good. Great flavor.

Delicious every time!  I've made this several times and it is fantastic for chicken as well.  The only change I make is that I add a cornstarch slurry after I heat the remaining marinade in a saucepan to make a yummy dipping sauce or to drizzle over the frog legs or chicken.  Served over rice this is a fantastic dish!

I made triple the marinade, just because we like having extra; and cooked the frog legs for an additional minute on each side. Other than that, I prepared this per the recipe. It was very good and did not last more than five minutes.
