I add roasted red pepper strips, garlic-flavored hummus and crunchy iceberg lettuce in place of the spinach.  Instead of tortillas, I use wraps - which are basically the same thing anyway.  So good (and so healthy)!

Nice and simple. This recipe leaves infinite room for experimentation. I replaced the cream cheese with a creamy chipotle sauce and added thin slices of a (de-seeded) fresh tomato as well. Added slices of provolone to some, based on personal preference.
