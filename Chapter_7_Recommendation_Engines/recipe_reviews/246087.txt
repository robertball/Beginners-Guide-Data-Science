It was very good! I probably won't be ordering it at my local restaurant now that I can make it. I actually made it twice! The 1st time, I subbed [dried] cayenne for chili peppers and it was too hot and I wasn't getting enough curry kick. This time I backed off the cayenne and upped the curry a tbsp. Tweaking complete!

We liked this a lot, but it was slightly too "peppery" for us. I used jalapenos, like the submitter (because I'm a spice wimp) - but I think mine were super hot, because my skin is still burning from removing the ribs and seeds. Next time I'll cut it back to just one (and use gloves)! I threw in a couple of carrots, and cooked it in my cast iron dutch oven, initially on the stove, but then put into a 250 degree oven for 3 hours. The goat meat fell right off of the bone. We ate it with bread, but this would go great with rice too. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I loved it and so did my husband...I made several changes to the original recipe. I used more curry powder and I don't know how much more because I'm a sight cook not measured. I used rice, frozen peas and carrots instead of potatoes. I didn't use cayenne pepper I used a jerk seasoning for heat. I cooked it longer and used more liquid and allowed it to cook down till it was just enough to add my veggies which I returned it to boiling and when it did I added my minute rice and then turned it off. Tastes great.
