I get a little frustrated by reviews that recommend non-vegan additions to a vegan recipe.  I think that there are plenty of great non-vegan brownie recipes to add those comments to.  

Here are my vegan recommendations:
Use raw sugar instead of white sugar. Not only does this ensure that it is vegan, but the raw sugar crystals make a beautiful glimmer on top of the brownies! The first time I made these I used oil.  I even cut down the oil, and they were still very oily.  The very next batch (made the same day) I used vegetable shortening instead.  They were soooo much better.  I added a few shots of espresso (from my local cafe) to the batter.  You don't taste the espresso itself, but it does wonderful things to the chocolate taste.  You could substitute with strong coffee.  Here's the key for those who have crumbling brownie issues.  Mix the flour and the water first.  This allows the gluten to form.  It helps to let that sit for a little bit before adding the other ingredients.  If you don't do this, then the oil in the recipe will make it impossible for the water and flour to form gluten and make the brownies stick.  I have substituted vanilla soy milk for the water in the past, and that worked well too.  I have also added nice little extras.  Try peppermint extract or cayenne pepper (really...I mean it chocolate and cayenne pepper are sooo good together).

I reviewed this recipe once before, thinking these were awesome brownies. I tried making them again last night with a few changes and they turned out the absolute best brownies I have ever made. I did a half batch in an 8" square non-stick pan, which I lightly sprayed with Pam. I used 1 cup AP flour, 3/4 cup white sugar, 6 TBS cocoa, ½ tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, ½ cup water, 2 TBS veg oil, ½ cup natural/unsweetened applesauce, and 1 tsp vanilla. I poured half the batter in the pan, put in a layer (around 3/4 cup total) of butterscotch and chocolate chips, and then poured in the rest of the batter, spreading to cover the chips. They took around 30 minutes to bake, but we have a new oven and are adapting from our old one. :) They were rich, gooey, fudgy, but not overly sweet. Thank you again, Sandy. This is the BEST!!

These are only vegan if you use raw sugar. If you use white sugar they are not even vegetarian, as animal bone char is used in the bleaching process.

I have tried SO MANY vegan brownie recipes in search of the perfect one, and WOW! These are incredible! I made a few changes,  but nothing major; just little things to suit my personal tastes, and my boyfriend & I REALLY loved these! We made a half-batch, and these are my notes:

-Used 1/4 c. canola oil, plus 1/2 c. organic unsweetened applesauce for the oil.
-Added 1/4 tsp. almond extract, in addition to the vanilla.
-Threw in about 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips (vegan, of course!).
-Used coffee instead of water.

We baked for 23 minutes, and they are ooey, gooey, DELICIOUSNESS!

Thank you so much for sharing! I will be making these quite often, I'm sure. *Oh--Also: I didn't find these crumbly at all, as stated by other reviewers. Perhaps the applesauce helped bind them together better?*

I'm fairly experienced with vegan baking and often just adapt existing non-vegan recipes (it's fairly easy once you've gone through a bit of trial and error and know what works and what doesn't). So, this recipe intrigued me. I used it as a base and straight off it seemed like a LOT of oil. I don't really like baking with oil even though most vegan recipes suggest it because it makes the product greasy. So, I changed the recipe for 12 servings (to bake in a 12x muffin pan). I used 3/4 of the amount of fat it suggested (I substituted oil for melted vegan non-hydrogenated margarine). I doubled the liquid and used 1/2 soy milk and 1/2 water. I used Demerara sugar instead of white and 1/2ed that too. I then added 2 table spoons maple syrup (to give back some moisture and gooeyness). I doubled the amount of vanilla extract and added 1 tsp cinnamon. 

It made the mix quite dough like and it actually rolled up into a ball. I worked with it like that, breaking off 12 portions, rolling them into balls and pressing them into the muffin tin. I then baked it for only 15 minutes to keep them gooey. They came out delicious! They aren't very sweet with less sugar (my intention) so if you like your brownies sweeter (and higher calories!) add 2-3 more table spoons maple syrup!

These were good but crumbly.  I wouldn't take them to a get together, due to the crumbliness, but I'd definitely make them again to eat at home.  They didn't seem too oily to me like some reviewers stated.  I baked them for 35 minutes, a little longer than the recipe called for.

Some reviewers have commented that white sugar isn't vegan.  If it's cane sugar, it may not be vegan if it has been processed with bone char but not all cane  sugar is processed that way.  You'd need to write, call, or e-mail the manufacturer and ask.  I prefer not to mess with that and just use beet sugar.  It looks and tastes just like cane sugar and is vegan as it is never processed with bone char.



Also, "THEBOYCANPLAY" said that these are "not exactly vegan, as being vegan implies a bit more of a mindset than "no eggs, no dairy"

I'm not sure exactly why this reviewer said this.  If it's because of the white sugar, again, white sugar can be vegan.  If it's because these aren't exactly a health food, food doesn't have to be healthy to qualify as vegan.  A food is vegan if it doesn't contain animal products of any kind.

My non-egg-  and meat-eating friend alike made these brownies disappear at a work function. I DEFINITELY recommend cutting the oil to 1/4 cup and adding 3/4 cup applesauce. It makes these MUCH more brownie-like. Also, I added some chocolate chips and a VERY SCANT layer of icing to the top (not vegan, because it was milk chocolate), and it got rave reviews. Also kept them a bit more moist. If you add the applesauce, you do not need to overbake. 25-30 mins is just fine. YUMMY!

These are awesome brownies.  I wanted to cut back on fat and calories some though, so I used splenda instead of white sugar, and 1 1/2 cups of soy milk and 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1 cup water and 1 cup of oil.
YUM!

Absolutely delicious recipe, however I halved the recipe and used Earth Balance (a vegan butter subsitute made from various oils, which is so delicious) in place of the oil and vanilla soymilk in place of the water. I also added some chocolate chips and a bit of oats. So quick and easy, I would recommend this to anyone!

I'm sorry - I followed this recipe to a "T" and they were without a doubt THE worst brownies ever. I always bake for my husband's work & one of the girls recently became a vegan. I'll admit I have never made vegan recipes before so perhaps my tastes vary - they were very bland, and just didn't even resemble brownies. I doubt I'll even send them in - just enough for her. I have a reputation to uphold after all!! Thanks for sharing but I won't make again.

My kids have milk/egg allergies so this is a much-appreciated recipe! Very chocolately and rich. Slightly crumbly due to no-eggs, but the best I've tried so far. I use equal parts of brown and white sugar and add 1 c of both pecans and coconut flakes. You can also half the recipe and bake in a 8" or 9" square pan. Add 1-2 tsp of instant coffee for mocha brownies. Batter will be thick so don't be alarmed.

This is a very good vegan brownie recipe! One of my kids has severe allergies to eggs and dairy so I have been on the hunt for a good egg and dairy free brownie recipe and I believe I have found it! 

I made half the amount of the original recipe with a few minor modifications. Here is how I made them: 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup white sugar, ¼ cup and 2 tbspn cocoa powder, ½ tspn baking powder, ½ tspn salt, ½ cup water, ¼ cup veg. oil, ¼ cup applesauce, ½ tspn vanilla extract (Baked in a 8x8 square baking dish for 25 min at 350F). 

These turned out to be perfect in taste and texture- jumbo, thick, gooey, moist and dense cakey fudgy brownies that we all LOVED! Thank you so much for posting this recipe-it is a keeper for my family!

I'm giving five stars because I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, and I thought these were better than any other non-vegetarian brownie recipe I've tried! I made them for my neighbor, who is Indian. She's not vegan — milk and butter are OK — but she does not eat meat or eggs. I used half vegetable oil, half applesauce, and added about 3/4 cup of peanut butter chips, because I didn't have chocolate chips. PB chips aren't vegan, but they are egg-free, which is what I was looking for. They came out great! Not crumbly, and PB added a nice extra flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I followed the directions as specified and found the taste to be that of cheap generic chocolate candy and the oil literally pooled around the brownie I scooped out and tried.  While I appreciate people rated it higher, most seemed to do so based upon their changes.  I am rating the recipe as it is, not based on a bunch of changes I might have made- what is the point then?

I only used 1/4 cup oil, added 1 cup applesauce and replaced the water with vanilla almond milk.  I also added 3/4 cup vegan chocolate chips.  These were insanely good--rich, gooey, chocolatey, but not too overwhelming. This recipe deserves a 5 for its potential because these came out amazing!

Made these for a friend with a milk allergy, but everyone chowed down.  I didn't have applesauce, so I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added a cup of over-ripe mashed bananas.  Threw in some walnuts as well.  Turned out perfect - not oily, and definitely not crumbly.  Not as rich as 'real' brownies, but definitely a favourite.

i am a GREAT cook/baker, but as a new vegan i have to learn everything from scratch.  i have had horrible dessert experiences in vegan-land but these were VERY GOOD. 
 i started freaking out on the amt of oil, so i made it w/half applesauce and 1/2 veggie oil (i didnt have coconut oil).
they came out very cake like, but my omnivore inalws love them and thought they were un-iced chocolate cake.
next time i will make a icing (almond milk, cocoa and powdered sugar) to drizzel on top.

I was looking for a basic eggless brownie recipe to change into a fat free version. This was perfect!! I used skim milk instead of the oil and it works GREAT. I under baked them alittle so the inside was soft and gooey.

These have the potential to be good, but as written they are very oily and they fall apart even when cooled. It needs less oil and something to bind.

I changed a few things about this recipe after reading some of the other reviews.  Some changes: Used dark cocoa powder, sugar in the raw, 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup soy milk... Also, one of the reviewers said to add the oil last, I did that as well.  My batter seemed a bit in the thin side so I added some organic powdered sugar (thinking the cornstarch would help) until it was as thick as I wanted it to be.  Also, I greased and floured my pan, and the brownies popped right out for me! My brownies turned out so well I almost cried! I was so excited and amazed that they actually turned out better than I could have ever imagined.  Not greasy whatsoever! I made some vegan icing to top them off.  I just used some earth balance, organic powdered sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and cocoa powder. (It was okay, probably could have been better with tweaking.) But the brownies were amazing!!

As is, so not good.  I usually modify recipes to make them vegan, so I am used to the difference between regular and "vegan baked goods".  But this did not work for anyone in our home.  It was oily, crumbly, and lacking in flavor-richness (but heavy in cocoa flavor).  I'll go back to my old modified recipe.

I LOVE these! I have a taste bud for vegetable oil rather than butter so I love that 'brownies out of the box' consistency that these accomplish! I used Hershey's special dark cocoa and they came out a tad strong on the chocolate, but I am partial to that as well! Thanks for the awesome recipe..you are making it easy for me to be vegan!! :o)

These brownies turned out great nearly every time. I personaly love vegan recipes because you can eat the batter! Instead of combinging the ingredients in order, i combined all teh liquid ingredients first and whisked them slightely. Then added the sugar, then the cocoa powder, then the flour. For some reason this makes the brownies even moister. I tried adding all liquids, then flour, then sugar, then cocoa, and they turned out like a bubbling pan of fat. I also found they can be enhanced really well if you replace teh 1 tsp of vanilla with just half of one, and then use half a teaspoon of mint extract. They turn out freshly minty, but not too overpowering. Enjoy!

Disappointing... again. Made this to the 'T' 2 years ago and came out with a greasy pan filled with what looked like tar. This time around I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed the flour with water beforehand and let it sit for a few minutes. Perhaps that reviewer used an electric mixer because my hand mixing did not do the job. I ended up with strings/globs of unmixed flour/water mixture within the mix. I'd hoped things would meld due to the high oil contenct, but nope. Simply not worth my time to HAVE to tweak a recipe. Btw, I've been cooking eggless desserts and the like for 8 years. Finding a good brownie recipe has been the toughest so far.

I think I'm missing something with the high reviews- it's just okay- a little pasty and yet dry at the same time- not a brownie I would get excited about or really make again- too bad!

Yummy but I will agree that there was too much oil. Cut it down by 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup and add 1/2 cup applesauce instead to make it less greasy as well as lower in fat. I also cooked them for about 23 minutes as they were done faster this way. Besides this, they came out amazing! And don't forget to make your own frosting with powdered sugar, cocoa and almond milk! :)

these look beautiful, but taste and texture, that is another story. these tasted like something i made in my easy-bake oven when i was five. they are not crumbly like other reviewers reported, but that could be because i used the reviewer reccomended recipe of using apple sauce. other than that i followed the directions. they were kind of gummy, not fudgy. they have brownie flavor though.

I used all whole wheat flour. Instead of using sugar I used 1 1/4 cups honey. Also, instead of using 1 cup vegetable oil I cut it in half and for the other 1/2 cup used unsweetened applesauce. I was a little unsure how they would they turn out because of all the substitutions but they were delicious!

Amazing!!! I used to think that eggs are essential to brownies..but NOT AT ALL! Replacing eggs and butter with water and vegetable oil not only benefits my health,the environment and my wallet but also tastes much lighter..so I can eat more than one...

These tasted very good.  But, I really don't like the fall apart like planting soil consistency.  I'm really picky about my brownies.  I think maybe the 1 cup of vegetable oil is at fault for fall apart brownies.  There is another recipe on here that I really love.  But it is not vegan, which is what I was trying to go for by using this recipe.  I think I will just use the other recipe and substitute some vegan butter instead of using this one.

Don't listen to these hippies that say add applesauce to the recipe. I have made these with and without applesauce and there is no comparison, the original recipe wins hands down. Here's what I've tried:

1. Original recipe, except with brown sugar, tightly packed. These are delicious. The texture and density is good and the taste is outstanding. On the downside they are somewhat crumbly but had I not made them I would never suspect they were vegan. 

2. Replace 3/4 of the oil with applesauce, as suggested by someone else who commented on this recipe. These taste good, but not great. Not nearly as rich and they also have a kind of gross spongy texture. These suckers are not going to fool your non-vegan friends.

Turned out great...but due to tweaking the recipe. I used only 1/2 C oil instead of 1 C, 3/4 C water instead of 1 C, and added 1/2 C soy milk. Also, I used whole wheat flour & raw sugar (1.5 C white & 1/2 brown). With all the changes they turned out better than the boxed version & healthier too!

After reading a bunch of reviews, I wasn't expecting an outstanding brownie experience. However, these far exceeded what I anticipated! I added chocolate chips and walnuts, and some instant coffee granules. That gave them a richer chocolatey taste. I also did half walnut oil, half apple sauce. I also think the trick is to eat these cold so that they don't crumble as easily. The first brownie out of the pan fell apart, but the rest stayed together better. I must admit I did miss the crispy edge of traditional brownies but as I said to my husband, I would much rather eat these brownies than no brownies at all!

***UPDATE***I took another cook's suggestion and made these again in a mini muffin pan and that is the ticket! They were near perfect that way! I also replaced the water with an Americano. Based on an experience I had with a brownie mix over the weekend, I wonder if they would be even crispier/chewier if you replace some of the oil with melted vegan marg... Plan on making this again this weekend so will update with the results.

I used 1/2 c. water, 1/2 c. applesauce, 1 c. agave, and 1/2 c. oil. Baked for about 20 minutes. More cakey, just how hubby likes it. Thanks for a great starting point.

Super easy and yummy! I stuck to the original recipe (minus about 1/4 cup of oil based on some other reviews), and the brownies turned out moist and delicious.

I am not vegan, but I developed a milk and egg allergy as an adult and I am dying for some chocolate goodies. I was just diagnosed 2 weeks ago, so this is the first recipe I am trying that uses "substitutes" for the regular milk and eggs. The directions were very easy to follow, however this mix came nowhere near enough for a 9x13 pan. I had to bake it in a 8x8 pan. I decided to make two pans, one of which followed the original directions and the other used the suggested 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. I had to increase the baking time to 35 minutes. The brownies following the original recipe came out pretty good. Next time I think I will add a little cinnamon for more flavor. The texture was good though. More cake-like then gooey.  The second pan (using applesauce)came out looking exactly like regular brownies. I did not care for the taste at all. The original recipe tasted much better. I guess if you are used to eating vegan it wouldn't be too bad, but for me the flavor was too off.  Another review stated to mix flour and water together first...absolutely NOT. Do NOT do this. It will make the batter lumpy and the dry ingredients will not blend smoothly if you do this.  I really like the original recipe. Thank you so much for posting this. I will definitely be making this again!

The flavor was OK, but I don't feel like they lived up to their description as "very gooey". I was hoping for dense, gooey, thick brownies and these turned out more fluffy, crumbly and cake-like. I did use soymilk instead of water--maybe that is why? Not bad and it satisfied my chocolate craving, but not what I was expecting.

I just took these out of the oven 15 minutes ago...  they are great!  I made them mostly for my daughter (who is allergic to milk and eggs) to try.  But I couldn't help trying them after they were out of the oven 10 minutes...  :)  I didn't modify the recipe at all.  From what I can tell - there's no need to.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe is perfect. The only thing I changed is used raw cane sugar instead of white sugar to make it a truly vegan brownie. White sugar is not vegan. Raw cane sugar easily replaces it in a 1:1 ratio.

Surprisingly, these are pretty good. I used organic applesauce intead of any oil. I also used 1c whole wheat & 1c regular all-purpose flour; and organic raw sugar instead of white. Mine came out with a cake consistently...but not crumbly at all. They held together very well...and are very tasty!

Well I messed up this recipe and it still came out great. I tried to half the recipe except I forgot to halve the liquid.  Well to me this came out great the perfect combo of fudgey and cakey. I used leftover coffee for the liquid and added chocolate chips (vegan) to the batter then put walnuts on top of the batter. After working in the garden today I couldn't stop eating these!!  Yum yum yum.

Since I'm new to this, I made it according to the recipe EXCEPT I was out of white flour, so I used whole wheat pastry flour.  They were fine.  Better than most - way better than a mix.  The second time I made them, I made them with white flour AND after tasting the batter and finding it good, but a little on the bland side, I looked around for ingredients to add that could help perk up the flavor.  I wish I had seen the cayenne pepper recommendation! Instead, I went with a couple of spoons of cognac.  Man! It was really good!  You couldn't taste it, but it just added that layer of complexity it needed to move it from pretty darn good to great.

Good stuff. But I did 1. change water to 1 1/2 cups and oil 1/2 cup then 2. used splenda instead of real sugar to cut back on calories.

I made this recipe exactly except I used olive oil for the oil and agave nectar instead of sugar. These brownies were so addicting! I couldn't stop eating them. I made them saturday night and half the pan was gone by sunday afternoon. And it's only me, my husband and 4 year old son. Loved the recipe!

I love these brownies.  I usually halve the recipe & replace most of the oil with applesauce.  I also use soy milk for the water.  These are so delicious! I love them with frosting---yum! Thanks for sharing!

Was a hit at our party (both for dairy-free and non-vegan eaters)! Followed other suggestions: increased the cocoa powder by 1/4 cup; substituted the 1 cup water with 1/2 cup strong coffee and 3/4 cup water; substituted the 1 cup oil with 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce; AND added vegan chocolate chips (about 1 cup). I baked the brownies for a total of 45 min after first checking at 30 min and increasing the time by 3-5 min until toothpick inserted in the middle came out clean. Did NOT come out oily. No one could tell they were any different than regular boxed brownies! Will make again since I have another bag of vegan choc. chips.

Excellent recipie, since I'm on a gluten-free (among other things) diet, I substitued the all-purpose flour for rice flour and added two eggs worth of egg replacer. The brownies turned out marvelously, no greasiness or anything. I only needed to bake for 20 min.

Have a vegan friend and I was in charge of dessert for the meal. I tried this recipe and liked it.  Then I tried it again but substituted the oil for apple sauce.  Don't do that!  It will completely change the consistency of the brownie.  This recipe tasted good for a vegan dessert.  I haven't had much but really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe.

a good vegan brownie recipe is hard to find but I think my search has ended! I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan. I subbed 1/2 cup apple sauce and 2 Tbsp oil for the 1/2 cup oil as other reviewers suggested. I also tossed in a half cup or so of chocolate chips.

As is, 3 stars.  WAY to much oil. The finished brownies were shiny. So, I modified it. Instead of the cup of oil,  I boiled  prunes in some peach juice, then blended them and poured it into a one cup measure, and added the oil to fill it to one cup. It came out to about 1/8 cup of oil, and the rest prune puree.  NOW, these are great brownies!  A bit fruity tasting, but rich, moist, and dark.  I used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder, since I wanted to make sure I didn't lose the chocolate flavor to the prunes.

They were PERFECT (though if you want them true Vegan you should use a dehydrated sugercane product that hasn't been processed through bone char - I use Sucanat from my local health food store) I added a cup of chocolate chips. YUM!

After carefully reading some reviews, I attempted these vegan brownies off of a request from my vegan coach. I read the majority of the reviews and did some minor modifications. My coach is allergic to chocolate so instead of cocoa powder I used Carob powder (its just a chocolate substitute. A lot of people don't like it, I think it tastes the same.) Instead of 1 cup of water, I used 1 cup of vanilla soy milk. It made them verrry moist. Instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil, I used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and 1/4 cup of applesauce. And last but not least, in addition to 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, I added 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract. They were DELISH!!

These brownies were very moist and delicious!  I added about 1/2 cup of coffee to the batter and thought I might have had too much liquid but they ended up perfect.  My only complaint is that they could be more chocolatey or have more flavor.  Next time I will try adding nuts or as one other reviewer suggested cayenne pepper just to kick up the flavor.

I substituted 1 cup of pumpkin puree and 1 tbs olive oil instead of 1 cup of oil. Used 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/2 cup white sugar (both vegan processed). And added vegan chocolate chips and lots of cinnamon. Yummy! And less fat/calories.

Boy, do I miss eggs.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using slightly less oil and I was less than pleased with the results.  The consistency was somewhere between "brownie" and "cake", and they were oily (as several other reviewers stated).  I could taste the vegetable oil.  I would rate them as fine for my kids, but not something I would bring to a party for other adults to eat (as I had planned to do).    At least they were not a big disaster as were some other vegan recipes I have tried!  I may or may not bother to attempt them again.  In the meantime I will just hope my kids outgrow their dairy and egg allergies.  :)

Excellent!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted 3/4 c. vegan margarine for the oil, reduced the water to 3/4 cup water and added 1/2 cup coffee, as well as a dash of cayenne pepper.  As one reviewer suggested, prior to adding the other ingredients, I combined the water/coffee with the flour to allow the gluten to form up (then added everything else, poured in the pan and baked).  I frosted them with my own frosting made of margarine, melted chocolate chips, almond milk and powdered sugar.

Disclaimer: I modified the recipe, so my review is based on my modifications: 1/2C oil + 1 C apple sauce instead of 1C oil water exchanged for soymilk, baked for >35 minutes  They were the best brownies I've ever made!  Very cake-y, very chocolate-y, moist, and all around scrumptious!  Was told I should open up a shop with these!

Soooo Yummy and so easy. Taste just as good as "regular" brownies. I'm not vegan myself, but a friend is. She was coming over so I made these for the party. They were gobbled up so fast by everyone and a couple of people asked for the recipe.

I made these brownies last night hoping for some decent vegan brownies and I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious they were! Definitely worth making and very quick and simple to make. I'll be making these more often, I love proving people wrong about Vegetarian and Vegan foods. Nothing taste better than a delicious brownie that's 100% animal friendly!

I made these while I was on a no-iodine diet and they tasted like the best things I had ever eaten.  My roommates avoided them like the plague, and later, when I was off the diet I tried making these brownies again remembering how amazing they were and found to my disgust that they tasted like cat food. So...if you can't eat real brownies, these are delicious, but don't make them if you have tasted normal brownies in the past several weeks.

These brownies are extremely good!! my family is not vegan but my daughters have multiple food allergies including eggs and gluten.  for the all-purpose flour I substitute 1 cup brown rice flour, 3/4 cup potato starch and 1/4 cup tapioca starch, which works great!  I DID cut the oil back to 1/4 cup and used 3/4 cup natural unsweetened applesauce which really makes these more like a brownie and less like cake, but that is a personal preference.  sometimes I sub. rice milk for the water but also a personal preference.  these are very yummy with chocolate icing (vegan) but really don't need it because they still taste great without it :)  overall great recipe!!

I'm not vegan, but out of respect for vegans at a party, I tried these. I used oil and mashed banana instead of all banana. I didn't have vegan choc chips, so I increased the cocoa powder - per other suggestions. A vegan at the party said he liked them.  I've concluded that being vegan must change your tastebuds....

The recipe came out way too cakey and way too oiley.  Maybe if I add some vital wheat gluten to the mixture and reduce the oil content, this recipe might work.

Absolutely delicious brownies! Unfortunately, they were a huge, crumbly mess. The taste was rich, sweet and more-ish, but I need some of your advice for a better consistency. I will definitely attempt these again..  I reviewed this recipe for the first time 2 weeks ago: the taste was beautiful but I was frustrated with the texture, as the brownies fell apart in my hands. Today, however, I made one slight alteration to the recipe, but it made huge difference! I halved the amount of oil and split it with Pure margarine. This variable changed the consistency entirely; the brownies were still full of flavour, but they rose better, were lighter, fluffier and held together extremely well. Goodbye crumbliness!

These are very good, with a little modifcation!  These were actually my first attempt at Vegan baking, and I was quite proud of how they turned out, despite the fact I had completely forgotten to add in the vanilla extract!  Here's my version of the recipe: 2c unbleached flour, 1c white sugar, 3/4c brown sugar, 3/4c cocoa powder, 1ts baking powder, 1ts salt, 1c chocolate soy milk (in place of water), 1/2c canola oil, 1/2c sweetened applesauce, and if I had remembered, 1ts vanilla extract.  I also baked mine at 315-320 degrees for about 20 minutes as I have to under bake everything in my oven because if not it will burn easily, and they turned out perfect! Will definitely make these again.

These brownies were very moist and tasty. I replaced about 1/3 of the oil with applesauce and it still had that oily appearance that many of the other reviewers mention. I also replaced the white sugar with splenda. However, they tasted very nice. In the future I would add some chocolate (some dark chocolate is vegan) chunks to them to add to the deliciousness.

I used only 3/4 c. oil and these brownies came out with a very nice texture, not greasy or crumbly but still fairly moist. They are however a little tasteless; next time I'll try subbing some oil for applesauce and adding some chocolate chips.

I made these for a bake sale.  My husband, sister and I all think they turned out delicious!  Next time, I think I'll make them but not advertise them as "vegan".  I think people are incredibly short-sighted to think that vegan means "not good".  Once I changed the sign to just say "non-dairy" they received better reception.  (Sorry, I'm venting because I was very irritated.) These are one of the best brownies I've had.  (More like a cross between cake/brownies.)  I made a couple of changes: I used raw sugar, raised the cocoa powder up just a tad, and substituted half the oil with unsweetened applesauce. I had to bake them for 35-40 minutes.  With my leftovers we've been spreading some creamy peanut butter on top.  They are still moist 3 days later too!

Well, the part that COOKED on the outside only was kind of good.

It was crumbly and bland, but it was moist and tasted like chocolate.

I guess I'm still looking for a decent vegan brownie recipe. :(

just OK. not the best brownie i have eaten, a little spongey feeling.  good chocolate taste, perhaps from the chocolate chips and toffee bits i sprinkled on top.

This was acutally good!!! Not as chewy as I'd like but it did come out well. Here are my changes to this recipe if you are vegetarian and use butter and milk:

instead of Oil:
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup apple sauce
1/4 tsp vanilla & almond extract each
1/4 cup milk

1 cup of coffee cooled.
1 cup of milk chocolate chips...

Really really good..

This is a great brownie. I did make some adjustments and some substitutions for the the oil. I cut the oil in half and put in 1/2 cup applesauce, they held together really well. I really like the gooey, fudgy texture :)

Also, I thought the amt of sugar used was pretty high, so I substituted 1/2 c. of the sugar with powdered milk, and then proceeded to add 1/2 c. honey with 3/4 c. of sugar. That's really all the sugar it needed to make it sweet enough.

I also substituted some of the flour with oat flour (wheat-free) to make it healthier and whole grain. 

Thank you for this recipe, it was wonderful. I have made it 2 times already in the past month!

This gets 5 stars. one of my best friends, who has severe dairy/egg allergies has never had a brownie sundae...until yesterday. With Rice Dream ice cream and choc. syrup. He was in heaven! I did sub half splenda (my mom is diabetic and I wanted to cut some of the sugar) and half brown sugar. They were Excellent!

very good brownies! i usually make a smaller batch and bake them in individual servings. i also sometimes substitute the vanilla for mint extract for chocolate mint brownies. it is a little crumbly, so i bake them for only 20 minutes. thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe as is many times and they always turn out great!  These are the moistest brownies and they stay that way for days. I started a diet today and decided to make these and alter the recipe slightly to fit in with my eating plan.  I used whole wheat flour, half splenda white & half brown sugar and becel oil, plus I added extra cocoa.  I halved the recipe incase it didn't turn out but I've already eaten one row and they're not even cooled yet! I dusted with powdered sugar and they are delicious...they are very moist & rich... and very dark.  I just hope I can show some restraint with them and not eat the whole pan by myself!

it doesn't get better than this! the only change i made was soy milk instead of water. we made these, and some traditional box brownies for the non-vegans in the house. the non vegans thought these were way better than the traditional version: more rich and chocolately. here's to the vegans that want to pretend they're still somewhat normal!

I never thought vegan brownies could taste so good! I used 3/4 C applesauce and only 1/4 C oil but that was just because I was out of applesauce. They were much more satisfying than any "lighter" non-vegan brownies I've ever tried!

MMMM...is RIGHT! These were great! I did make some minor adjustments: I used brown raw sugar instead of white, and used vegetable shortening rather than oil.  I think this may have been contributing to the greasiness that a few reviewers were complaining about.  Using veggie shortening made them really nice and fluffy! Last, I used rice milk instead of water...MMMMMMMM!!!

I give these 5 stars for vegan brownies and somewhere between 3 and 4 on the general brownie scale.  They good, but had the slightly harsh taste I associate with egg-free baking.  Still, non-vegans who ate these were raving, so maybe it`s just me.

This was a great recipe for my egg-allergic son. All my kids and even my hubby loved these. I make it for birthdays so my son has cake he can eat too. I used half wheat flour and replaced the oil with almost a cup of applesauce. Turns out nice and moist, and rich :)Not like chewy brownies, morelike cake, but still very yummy!!

The ingredients for this recipe are good.  No substitutions are needed.  The problem Reviewers encountered was the brownies were oily or the oil pooled in the brownie pan.  Reading this recipe to my cousin who went to culinary school, she identified the problem.  Since oil and water do not normally mix, the oil needs to be bound to something first before adding the water.  Solution:  Blend the sugar, oil, and cocoa powder first.  Then, add the rest of the wet ingredients.  Now the batter is ready for the addition of the salt, baking powder, and flour, in that order.  Be sure to blend well after each addition of the dry ingredients.  Another note:  Be sure to line your 9x13 baking dish with parchment paper and spray well with nonstick spray.  Now you’re ready to bake according to the Baker’s directions.  The reason I gave this recipe 4 stars is because the directions weren’t as clear as they should be.  However, after rectifying the oil issue, these brownies are chocolatey goodness.  I will definitely make these again, should I come across another need for a vegan dessert.

I modified this recipe a bit. I used only 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 and 3/4 cup of oil instead of 1 and it turned out awesome.  Pure awesome. I baked for 30 mins.
I'll try using less oil next time bc I don't think it's needed to use this much. The recipe was great though. Hubby and I loved it.

Better than I expected. I cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8 x 8 square cake pan. I lowered the sugar to 3/4 of a cup instead of the full cup suggested. I used dark unsweetened cocoa. I only used 3 TBSP. of oil and added 1 2.5 oz. prune puree baby food as a substitute for the rest of the oil. I cut it into nine pieces instead of 8. With my substitutions, it's not only vegan and delicious, but it's also lower in calories.

I followed the recipe exactly but these were so crumbly. I do like the flavor so I will probably make these again but I think I will add a flax egg or two.  Hopefully that will help bind them.

Made these last night after searching the web for a vegan recipe. My daughter had to make a vegan recipe for her AP Environmental class as a lab assignment. After reading some other reviews we decided to use 1/2 cup of oil and a 1/2 cup unsweetened natural applesauce. Kept everything else the same and baked for 30 minutes. I cut into them this morning and all I can say is YUM! I wasn't too sure what to expect from brownies with no eggs but holy cow are these great! Good thing she's taking them to school or I'd probably eat the whole pan! They were not at all crumbly and very moist. Great recipe! Thanks!

Incredible. I replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil, using 2/3 the amount listed. Also, I added half a cup of quick oats. LOVED IT

Update: second time through-- I replaced the vegetable oil with 3/4 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of applesauce (something I use often to replace eggs). cooked it ten minutes more than it said; still really soft inside but utterly delicious nonetheless

Excellent brownies! I had a guest over who was allergic to eggs so I made this for dessert. Instead of 1 cup oil, I used 2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce and it was not oily as some others complained. Some said it was not chocolatey enough but I used Dutch cocoa and it was great!

Very good vegan brownies!  These were fluffier and more cake-like than traditional non-vegan brownies, but the flavor is perfect!  I made a few modifications based on other reviews - I used 1 cup of almond milk instead of water and used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil instead of the 1 cup of vegetable oil.  I will definitely be making these again.

For those who are complaining about the crumbliness of the brownies--instead of a cup of water, use a cup of unsweetened applesauce. The applesauce has a binding agent in it (yay fruit pectin!) and the moisture of the sauce should keep the consistency correct. You may need to cook them a little longer, or use a little less flour, depending on your gooey-ness preferences. :)

I've made this several times and have been pleased with the results! But I must warn everyone to never ever ever use Stevia as the sweetener. I was out of vegan sugar and Stevia was all I had. It made the brownies very bitter tasting. Who the heck ever throws out brownies? Well, I did. :(

These were really good. I made a few simple changes that I think made them even better! I used coffee, instead of water to give a richer chocolate flavor as well as used melted Earth Balance instead of vegetable oil. I also swirled in peanut butter on the top :)

This was my first time making a vegan recipe AND my first brownie recipe from scratch.  I cut the vegetable oil in half and did half applesauce (the idea of a whole cup of oil kinda grossed me out!)  Brownies turned out very cakey and mild in flavor.  If you don't like your sweets TOO sweet, this is perfect for you.

I used agave instead of the sugar, as I could not find sugar that has not been processed with bone char. I had to reduce it to three halves of a cup,though. The result was crumbly, but delectable.

Brownies taste good only think I question is the pan size... a 13 by 9 was way too big and the brownie mix barley covered the pan so I poured it in a 9 by 9 pan. I had a little bit of a gooey middle but that might be because of the pan being a little too small... or needing to bake longer. Overall though tasty brownies cant tell them apart from non-vegan brownies.

Mine turned out way, way too oily. Otherwise, it was fine  :) I'm pretty sure that if i reduce the quantity of oil it's going to be ok...

Awesome brownies! I cut the recipe in half and baked in 8x11 pan. Also used coconut oil (melted) instead of veggie oil,  it added a great flavor. I will definitely be making these again!!!

I made an account just so I could review these brownies!
After a long time of searching for a good vegan brownie I have finally found it! This tastes better than any animal product laden brownie out there! 
I did do a few things differently, I traded the white sugar for brown because that was all I had, I traded the oil for my favorite vegan butter, and I added chopped walnuts. 
DELISH

I made these to take to a friend's place as he had made dinner for me. He's vegan, so I really needed to make sure that I found a reliable vegan brownie recipe; this one worked out well. I wasn't fond of the fact that there wasn't a binding agent in the recipe, so I added 2 tsps of tapioca starch to hold it all together and it worked very well. I baked these for 50 minutes at 350ºF in an 8x8 pan as i wanted thicker brownies. They were fudgy, amazing, and were very well received.

I made two different versions of these. I did the regular, and I added chocolate chips to the other. The end result, is AMAZING. I don't generally like food I make, but this was just insane. My boyfriend ADORED them, and obviously, I'll be making these more often. :)

These were absolutely yummy! I took other reviewers' advice and used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of the full cup. I also used sugar in the raw instead of white sugar and added a melted dark chocolate bar, they were really really delicious! Even my omni family loved them!

I followed this pretty much 100%, except that I halved it. It came out a bit crunchy (in a bad way) on top, but the middle was perfect. I just cut appropriately and it was fine. Perhaps I overcooked... anyway, good vegan recipe! Thank you, poster.

This was a great recipe! It was my first time trying vegan baking, because I wanted to take brownies to a class meeting and I wasn't sure what kind of dietary restrictions everyone had. Not only was it a crowd pleaser, but no one noticed that it didn't have eggs nor butter. (Well, they are just college students, but still.) I did make the following changes, though. 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup oil. Turned out moist and delicious (and healthier!)

These were good, not great though. Mine are super thin. I wonder if i shoukd double the recipe or use a smaller pan. I used a half cup of oil and it was still too much so I piured out another fourth. I mixed the flour and water and let it sit 10 minutes before I added the oil. To build the gluten. Not crunmbly at all

My pastors daughter is allergic to eggs so I decided to make this recipe..I have a great egg free chocolate cake recipe from this site but these brownies were not good! They were extremely crumbly and very crusty on the outside by the time the inside was done. I also think they have a weird taste! But I gave them 2 stars instead of one bc for some odd reason my husband liked them.

Made them just as the recipe. Substituted 1/2 the oil for margarine and used 1/2 the salt. Perfect! Can't wait until tomorrow for the test taste. I'm sure they will pass. Oh, and I used coffee instead of water.

This was my first time purposely making something vegan.  My husband is allergic to dairy but I've never tried baked goods without eggs.  I was skeptical!  Based on previous reviews, I avoided white sugar and instead used some amber agave syrup and an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  I had some Earth Balance vegan margarine, about 1/2 cup, and then used 1/4 cup of oil as well.  The agave syrup wasn't as sweet as I'm used to with sugar, but the brownies went over so well with the group and my vegan coworker was thrilled!  I'll definitely be playing with the recipe some more!!

I've always wanted to try this recipe but the negative reviews had been holding me back. Today I was craving for some brownies, and found out I didn't have any dairy in the pantry.. no eggs, no butter, no milk. So this is sort of a desperate measure. I tried to follow the recipe to a T but I found out I also did not have enough white sugar! So I used brown sugar instead, halved the recipe, and baked it in an 8x8 inch pan for exactly 25 mins. I did not have high hopes in this recipe because of the previous negative reviews... but surprisingly, it was good! Understandably, it doesn't taste like the usual fudgy and chocolatey brownies made with more conventional ingredients. But it did hold up as one of the best tasting brownies I've had. Even my sister who's not so fond of anything sweet liked it! I love that it wasn't cloyingly sweet. I did crumble just a bit as mentioned on previous reviews but it didn't really bother me. One previous review mentioned it tastes like "burnt toast" -- there will be a similar undertone if you eat the brownie while still warm. This brownie is best at room temperature. This won't be my ultimate favorite brownie recipe, but I can see myself making this again.

They really didn't taste good at all. My husband described them as tasting like "burnt toast" but maybe I cooked them too long. Even still they were very gooey for how burnt they tasted. I must have done something wrong?

Tastes like a brownie! I'm not a vegan, but I was craving brownies, didn't have any eggs, and didn't feel like going to the store. I had to make them in the toaster oven, so I only made a 1/8 batch, cooked in a metal measuring cup. It didn't really work out, but I'm pretty sure that that's just because I was using a toaster oven instead of a regular oven, and also because I didn't know how long to cook them for with an 1/8 batch. But you know what? Even though only the outsides were solid, and the middle was a bunch of goo that didn't stay together, it still tasted like a brownie, and I felt safe eating it partially cooked because there aren't any eggs :)  If I ever find myself wanting brownies when I don't have eggs again, I'll make sure I come back to this page!!

Made these many times, yummy! Based on other reviews, I've settled in to using 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce or all shortening instead of oil. And thanks so much for the tip to mix the flour and water first before anything else - that worked like a charm to banish the crumbliness problem

I followed the suggestions and doubled the vanilla extract and used shortening instead of oil. I also added almond extract. I wanted to try something new and different as well so I added the espresso shots as one woman suggested. I think I added too much, because though they turn out good...they were more bitter than I would like...still satisfying and rich though.

I've baked these several times for bake sales and they are wildly popular whether people are looking for a vegan item or not. I preferred using shortening since the coconut oil I used once was a pain. I added 1/2 cup applesauce and they were moist, dense and truly chocolate. I've reduced the oil in some batches and never noticed.

I can't believe how good these are! I have tried so many vegan brownie recipes but they always come out crumbly and dry. These were sooo moist and delicious with a nice crust on top. I only used 1/2 cup oil and used rice bran oil, and I also mixed in 1 teaspoon of instant coffee - this really brought out the chocolate flavour and added extra depth. I found I had to bake them a bit longer than the recipe stated, I think mine were in the oven for about 45 minutes. Yum!!!

First time making Vegan brownies, they are as delicious a everyone said they would be.  The only thing is that i wish that they were less like a cake and more dense/solid.  Any recommendations?

These were very chewy and delicious.  my daughter added vegan chocolate chips to the recipe for an even more chocolaty taste. They got better the longer they sat.  we will try adding applesauce in place of the oil next time.

sounds really delicious. and easy to make.   but isn't most sugar non-vegan. non-vegetarian even. domino - the major brand and other refined sugars are filtered through charred animal bones according to peta.

I love these brownies.  I make a few minor changes to the recipe.  I use 1 cup of "Sugar in the Raw" or  turbinado sugar instead of  2 cups of white sugar. I also add walnuts,coconut shavings, and dried cranberries to the brownies.

This was my first time baking vegan and it turned out alright. I made some changes though...I used whole wheat flour instead of white, raw sugar instead of white sugar and I used organic apple sauce instead of the oil. A crusty layer formed on the top of the brownies that tastes kind of bland but the inside is as moist and tasty as can be! They're not as good as regular brownies but thats to be expected! These are a pretty good alternative and really, quite simple to make :)

This is actually a great basic recipe as-is.  I really like that it doesn't attempt to use alternative ingredients to substitute for eggs.  If you substitute rice, almond or soy milk in place of the water, you will find the texture is both fudgy and cakey at the same time, and the brownies rise quite a bit.    While the taste isn't out-of-this-world, but it's a good start and will work fine if you plan on adding chocolate chips or nuts to round out the flavor.  My only complaint is the amount of oil in the recipe.  I think you could easily do 2/3 cup oil and 1 1/3 cup water or non-dairy milk without losing much by way of texture/taste.  I would like to play around with using baker's chocolate in place of some or all of the cocoa powder to see how that helps the flavor, and will probably up the vanilla extract by 1/2 tsp.

Gaw....there are FANTASTIC. I modified like other people, mostly just based on what I had around. I made a half batch (8 inch pan) and instead of 1/2 water 1/2 veg oil I did 1/2 rice milk 1/2 canola oil. I used vanilla sugar instead of extract 'cause it what I had around. These are the best vegan brownies I've ever made, and almost the best I've ever had (that award goes to a recipe that drenches the brownies in dark chocolate/red wine ganache!!)

I'm not a vegan, I just made these because they seemed easy. That they were. They've been cooling for a while and they seemed to have stuck to the pan. There was no mention of greasing the pan and I assumed with all the oil that I wouldn't have to worry about. It may just be that they're still a little warm though so we'll see. I cut down on a sugar a bit, I put in about 1 3/4 cups and they're still sweeter than I like. The seem to taste alright, certainly not the best I've made, but ok.

the texture is superb. but they taste like Play-Doh. even my kids whom eat the parts of brownies that no one else wants wouldnt eat these.  i traveled with the Rainbow Family for some time, and the general rule for the kitchens is we cook ALL vegan food, cos everyone has to be able to eat. ive had my fair share of "zooh-zooh's" (sweet snacks) that were vegan. and they were all full of flavour and over all simply delish. idk why ppl think vegan food has to have no flavour. there are good vegan brownie recipes out there. this one, we really didnt care for. not chocolatley enough. however, as i stated, the texture was perfect.

I made exactly per the recipe and enjoyed the brownies, but next time will tinker with the ingredients. While they were good, the could have been less oily. I'm definitely making these again, but will sub some/all oil for Earth Balance non-hydrogenated spread.

Both my egg/dairy-allergic 2-year-old son and my chocoholic husband loved these!  Admittedly, we did not make as written -- a whole cup of oil sounded like too much, and the other reviews seemed to confirm that it would be.  We used one reviewer's tip of 1 1/2 cups vanilla soy milk plus 1/2 cup oil instead of the oil and water.  This made the density midway between cake and brownies, and they needed 38 minutes to cook fully.  Oh how YUM!  Next time, we'll add dairy-free chocolate chips for extra pockets of choco-goodness.

I didn't have any eggs or milk, so I wanted a vegan recipe. These were DELICIOUS! I don't have a 9x13 pan upacked, so I lowered the servings to make a 8x8 (should have lowered them more because they were cakelike). My husband thought they were amazing. He was very wary about them at first, knowing there was no milk or eggs. We ate 3/4s of the pan that night. Terrible, I know, but these are just as good, if not better than regular brownies! And they looked way better than the photo shows.

Delicious! They come out well if you replace 2/3 of the oil with applesauce, too--just reduce the baking time by a few minutes.

I didn't like them.  They didn't have much flavor to them and the texture was a little weird (not fudgy at all).  Mine baked for about 23 minutes, any more time and they would have been way to overbaked.

BEST. BROWNIES. EVER. I love that I don't have to use an egg or milk replacer. For dark-chocoholics like me, I recommend adding another 1/4 c. of cocoa powder, with a little more water and margarine to keep the brownies moist. It cuts the sweet even more and gives them a little bite! So yummy, thanks!

Great recipe!  I have used this many times for my friends with allergies.  The recipe is flexible, it tastes great no matter what you do.  I have even made them with rice flour for my wheat-free friends and they were actually OK.  (I have never been a huge fan of rice flour goods.)    I substituted half of the oil for banana puree and they came out a bit "cakey" but still soft and good.  If you do that, they will take about an extra 10 minutes to bake.  The banana adds a little more flavor.   I have used these over and over, especially when out of eggs.  My other friends never knew they were vegan.  Again, great recipe for anyone! :-)

I wanted to try these since the submitter stated how gooey they were. I was so disappointed. More on the dry side than anything  and some-what crumbly. The dough was very thick when spreading into the pan.  They did not hold together after cutting. They were more moist after 3 days, but still crumbly. My kids usually devour brownies, but these have been sitting around. I'm not a total vegetarian, but I do eat healthy foods. These need at least some Egg Beaters to hold them together, and I understand that would not make them vegan, but they need something to hold the dough together. Shortening is not the answer if you are looking for a healthier alternative.  I would at least recommend cutting the baking powder to 1/2 tsp., that way the dough would not rise very much and become chewier.

Better than I thought they would be!  I have a family member who is on a low-iodine diet so they can't have iodized salt, soy, dairy, eggs, etc.  It is nearly impossible to find anything premade with non-iodized salt.  I only made 1/2 the recipe in a 8x8 pan just in case they were scary bad! I used non-iodized salt.  Changes I made: (REMEMBER: this is for 1/2 a batch in an 8x8 pan): LIGHTLY sprayed pan with a bit of PAM. used 1/3 cup oil, added a little less than 1/2 cup of cocoa powder, disolved 1 teaspoon decaf instant coffee into 1/2 cup of water,  1/2 teaspoon orange oil flavoring instead of vanilla, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I added a few bittersweet chocolate chips which have just trace amounts of dairy.  Baked for 25 minutes and they were done.  Would  check at 22 minutes next time.  The orange flavoring added an interesting flavor without being overpowering. Worth the effort!!!  My brother gobbled them up!

A little sweet, a little crumbly, but really simple to make.  All in all for a vegan recipe, these brownies are really good.

I've baked these twice following the recipe ingredients exactly.  The first time I baked them for 28 minutes.  The second time I baked them for 25 minutes.  When baked for 25 minutes exactly, they were gooey and fudgy.  At 28 minutes, they were too dry and crumbly.  Delicious!  I won't be baking with eggs and milk anymore.

I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter and threw in a bunch of chocolate chips.  I left them in the oven for 35-40 minutes. It came out a bit crumbly but who cares?  They are delicious! Maybe if I bake them a little longer? I'll try that next time.

These are amazing - the best brownies I've ever had. Its terrible because I can't stop eating them, and I'm usually pretty good about that. The only changes I made to the recipe were 1) added 3/4 cup of applesauce and just 1/4 cup of the oil 2) used coffee instead of water. I also used the icing recipe from the "Zucchini Brownies" on this site. I'd definitely recommend this recipe to anyone - vegan or not!

I made this recipe with some slight modifications.  I don't like to use a lot of sugar in my food, and I like a dark chocolate flavor, so I cut the sugar in half and cut the vegetable oil to 3/4 cup for the right batter consistency.  They came out dark and tasty, and surprisingly held together very well.  Non-vegans used to a cakey brownie, however, will find the texture a bit lacking.

My niece made these for me and they were very good.  She did NOT use white sugar. She used raw sugar. FYI: White sugar is not actually vegan. Part of the process of whitening it uses animal bones. So no true veagn will use white sugar. Besides there are much better sugars to use.

Very tasty!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup oil + mashed 1/2 of a ripe banana instead of the full cup of oil.  I also substituted 1 cup freshly brewed coffee for the water.  Those were great suggestions-- the brownies turned out wonderfully.  This is my first experience with vegan baking, and I think the result was every bit as tasty as "regular" brownies.  They were moist and flavorful, slightly gooey, with good texture and a nice appearance.  The banana really does add banana flavor to the brownies, but I think that works.  My husband described it as being similar to banana bread with a lot of chocolate chips in it!  I don't think it had THAT much banana flavor, but it was definitely there and quite nice.  I took these brownies to my book club meeting and they were gone in an instant.  Two thumbs up.  I will make these again.

Wow, what a great recipe! So super easy and really great texture for those with sensory intergration issues. 
I added 1TBS of mint extract to give it a kick. In another batch I left out 1/4 cup of oil and replaced it with natural chunky peanut butter. 
It's such a great basic that you can really get creative with it.

I followed some of the suggestions made and used 1/2 cup organic unsweetened apple sauce in place if 1/2 of the oil,and added 1/2 cup of vegan chocolate chips to the batter.
I poured half the batter in the pan and then added a layer of 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1 cup vegan chocolate chips.
I also made the full recipe,but baked it in a 8x8 in. pan. I baked it for about 40 minutes,and it came out great. More like cake then brownies,but still delicious.
I sprinkles chocolate chips on top after it finished baking,let them melt and spread them like a frosting.
Without the chocolate on top,they wouldn't have been sweet enough for my liking,but then again I only added 1 1/2 cups of sugar.
I noticed a lot of people complained about them needing to be cooked longer,when she specifically said if you want them more solid you'll have to cook them longer!
Overall a great recipe. I'll definitely be making them again.

These were fantastic. I'm not vegan, I'm a dairyaholic, and these were the best brownies I've ever had! I listened to the reviews and used 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup applesauce (unsweetened.) I greased my pan and dusted it with cocoa, I used strong instant coffee instead of water, and added a cup of chopped walnuts and pecans. Then I spread half the batter in the pan, sprinkled 1 cup chocolate chips on, and poured the rest of the batter overtop.

They only took about 27 minutes to cook; I pulled them out slightly on the side of underdone, and they were PERFECT. 

My company couldn't believe these were vegan. They loved them so much. We ate them while they were warm; they were soft and sooo moist. I sent the rest of the pan home with our company (reserving three for us) because we would have ate all of them. These are my new go-to brownies, and the only reason I made them was because my mom was visiting and she's on a vegan diet. I wasn't expecting them to be anything special because of the ingredients, but we loved them so much! Will wonders never cease.

I am just starting on my vegan baking journey, and my family LOVED these brownies! I made them for my 11 year old son's soccer team and everyone gave them rave reviews! I did add a package of vegan cocolate chips....my son thinks they are fantabulous with the chips!
I also substitued turbinado for th sugar and applesauce for 3/4 of the oil.

Very delicious.  I followed the other suggestions for making a half-batch.  I added white chocolate chips(not vegan) and half of a chopped up dark chocolate candy bar.  I also sprinkled pecans and ground flax on top before baking.

excellent and i love how accessible this recipe is for even a non-vegetarian such as myself. All ingredients I have and I love that it saved me from using eggs as I am a a constant baker.  I added a couple tablespoons of vanilla pudding to thicken up the brownies and make em a little fluffier:).

These were PERFECT chewy brownies when I made them with 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil and added walnuts to them!  AWESOME!  Because there is no egg in them, even your kids can lick the spoon safely!  ENJOY!

The best brownies ever! I have been vegan for 3 years and finally found a recipe for vegan chocolate brownies that taste just like the non-vegan brownies I used to make in the old days and without any unusual ingredients. I added pecan nuts and plain choc chips so were even more indulgent. Thank you so much - these are the nicest treats I have ever tasted and I've been dreaming about making more ever since!!! : )

I really like this recipe. I find that adding coffee or espresso instead of water adds more flavor. Furthermore, applesauce works as a great oil substitute. For added holiday fun I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla and garnished my brownies with peppermint candies... Yummm!

Just a comment to anyone not familiar with the vegan/sugar controversy:  Most brands of refined white sugar are NOT vegan, because animal bones are used in the process of refining it.  None of the big name brands are suitable if you're cooking for a vegan (as they do not have to indicate on the label how it is refined).  Look for sugar made from "organic evaporated cane juice" and you should be fine.

These brownies were so good!! I'm a vegetarian soon to be vegan and my husband is a die hard meat eater. I had made them without telling him they were vegan untill after he ate them. He loved them so much he did'nt seem to care if it had milk or eggs. They are so moist and sooo good!! I dont think it needs anything extra added.

oh wow, these are AMAZING! i just turned vegan and was seriously craving chocolate so i made these and they were perfect for the job :D

but, i like to make things a bit healthier than the origina recipe, so even though they were awsome tasting the first time, i tweeked the ingredients to make it better. FIRST; do half whole wheat flour and half normal, i wouldn't suggest too much more or you will compromise the soft texture. Next, do half brown, half white sugars. And lastly, add 1/2 cup vegetable oil and about 2/3 cup UNsweetened applesauce. 

great recipe, doubles very well!

I'm sorry but I don't know how this got 5 stars but I will say that I doubled the recipe and used 1 1/2 c splenda and 2 1/2 c sugar so maybe that was what ruined it. They were edible but kinda synthetic in taste and texture...the closest thing I can compare it to are those Little Debbie brownies.

I seriously cannot believe how good these brownies are!  I am so delighted to have found this recipe.  My 2-year-old son is allergic to milk, and my 1-year-old son is allergic to eggs, and I am always trying to find desserts that they can eat.  I have to admit, I was a little skeptical that "vegan" brownies would taste good to myself, a non-vegan.  I will definitely be making these brownies very often for my boys (and be sneaking one for myself)!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

The brownies came out great, wasn't sure they would.  I made slight adjustments the recipe.  Instead of 3/4 c. cocoa powder, I used 1/4c. Otherwise it will taste chalky.  1/2 c. oil, instead of 1 c. so it will not be greasy.  I also used 1/2 c. soy milk and 1/2 c. water.  You may not have to use all the water.

I was trying to find a recipe that both my husband and I could enjoy. He is allergic to eggs. I have made brownies in the past using cake mix and pudding or with mixes from specialty mixes like cherrybrook kitchen. By comparison, these were edible. I can't really think of them as brownies. They were sweet, but despite the cocoa powder they just did not seem chocolate-y enough. They were also a little greasy, but this recipe just did not do anything for me. They cooked beautifully and looked like brownies. The taste was just off. Disappointing if you've ever had anything close to the real thing.

For this recipe, I've used a smaller, round baking pan, and also cut down the required oil amount by half. Also, instead of using cocoa powder, I've used 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate and grated it into small chunks. Since the chocolate was already sweetened, I added only 1 cup of sugar, and the brownies still ended up being quite sweet. Next time, I'd prefer to somehow make them more chocolaty and add nuts which would add to the taste. The texture was not moist at all, just a little crumbly, which was fine. Overall, really nice brownies!!

We LOVE these brownies.  My daughter is 9 and DEATHLY allergic to peanuts and severly allergic milk.  She makes these by herself ALL THE TIME.  It's an easy recipe, and the brownies are very fudgy.  They do fall apart a bit, but who cares?  The all end up in the same place...our happy tummies!

These were surprisingly good! A little more cake-like than a brownie but I think that was mostly due to my modifications. Changes I made in this recipe include: 1 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 of white, 1 cup of oil plus 1 large ripe banana mashed insead of the 2 cups of oil, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 of white instead of 2 cups of white and 1 tablespoon of vanilla instead of a teaspoon. I made these changes just to make the recipe a bit healthier and less sweet. Even with the reduced sugar, I found these to stll be sweet and chocolatey! Yum! This is my first vegan dessert I've made and I have to say I'm impressed!

at first i was going to substitute the oil for the applesauce, but halfway through making these brownies i realized that the applesauce i had was already passed its expiry date, so i had to use 1 cup oil anyways. the brownies still turned out well and not as greasy as i thought it would be. i baked for about 40 minutes. also, i'm not much of a sweet tooth, so i cut the sugar down by half and it still turned out pretty delicious! and as this is my first time with vegan brownies, i realize that they do have a weird 'feel' than brownies with eggs...

Yummy brownies. Great for the vegan craving a chocolate fix. Turned out better in texture than alot of other vegan baked goods recipes. I baked it 5 minutes longer than recommended and dusted the top with powdered sugar while the brownies were still warm. My brother ate them directly from the pan.

Unfreakinbelievable.  These brownies turned out perfectly.  They were insanely easy to make and they turned out so cakey and moist.  I'm going to make more and try adding some cherries to them. These will definately be made over and over in our house!

i love this recipe.  the only thing that could use some tweaking is the texture.  it is a little too gooey for my taste; it doesn't hold together.  i often use oat flour as it is high in protein and replaces eggs' structural properties, or a mix of oat and wheat flour to add some form-building gluten, too.  highly recommended.

AAAHHH! These are WONDERFUL! I made them on my own and nearly got the kitchen covered in cocoa and flour, but that's the fun of baking! Very user-friendly, I thought there was a lot of sugar, but it was great! Will make whenever I get a sweet craving ^.^ THANK YOU!

These are very delicious, I substituted white sugar for pure cane sugar and flour for all natural all purpose flour. The batter was a little crumbly, but when they were done they were moist and rich in flavor.

This recipe is very highly rated, which is why I decided to make it. Unfortunately, I didn't actually read the reviews. If you do, you'll notice that most of the people who rate it highly have made some pretty substantial changes--most notably to the amount of oil in the recipe. I didn't adjust that, and these brownies are unbearably oily for me. I've had one, and I don't think that I can eat another. It's a huge waste of ingredients. If you decide to make these, look into using less oil, or substituting it for applesauce. I would not recommend the recipe as it is presented, and I absolutely will not be making it again.

Like always, I read all reviews and suggestions  first and adjusted the recipe to what I have in my pantry and fridge.  So, instead of 1 cup of oil I used 1/2 cup each of oil and apple sauce. Instead of water I used 1 cup of coconut/almond milk. Also added 2 spoons of instant coffee to dry ingredients because I like strong chocolate flavor, and added chopped walnuts.  I am not a professional in baking and it was my first time making any type of brownies, but it came out so, so delicious: cakey, gooey, soft.  I just made the brownies and having a very hard keeping my family away from them, they keep picking at them. Thank you all!

This is a really good recipe. I offered to make brownies for my class at school and I went to make some and I realized that I was out of eggs so this recipe worked out great. My friends and I really liked them.

AMAZING, THE best BROWNIES EVER! So moist, dense and chocolatey! I made a few changes, I used sunflower oil- butter instead of oil (but used the quantity of oil) almond milk instead of water, and granulated sugar! I have only been vegan for a couple of weeks and I am a fresher at University in England, my 9 other housemates could not believe how amazing these brownies are, most of them had no idea they were vegan when they fell in love on their first bite! HONESTLY they are the best brownies (out of non-vegan brownies!) that I have ever had and my housemates agreed!!!!! Already made my second batch in three days! THANK YOU FOR THIS SIMPLE RECIPE! Great that you can use regular ingredients with the oil and water options when you don't have any dairy alternatives and especially that you don't need any hard-to-find vegan ingredients!!! WE LOVE THEM

Made it as written, except that I forgot the vanilla. On the positive side, they came out very chocolatey and moist.They did fall apart a bit, but I don't consider that a negative. On the minus side, they were a bit greasy. I'd probably cut the oil back to 3/4 cup next time and see how that works, maybe replacing the 1/4 cup with almond milk.

Edit: made these again and replaced 1/4 cup of the oil with water. They came out fluffy and cakey, and they were good, but I like the original, fudgey texture better. I did add 1/4 tsp of almond extract and that was good. Thanks for a  vegan recipe without any specialized ingredients. It will become my standby recipe, I think.

Due to allergies, we are gluten free, egg free & soy free....I usually end up with a VEGAN recipe as a base for alterations. This one was perfect.  The things I changed:  2 cups Gluten Free flour blend.   1/2 C butter & 1/2 C coconut oil (instead of veg oil which is soy based)   Add the equivalent of 2 eggs from the EnerG egg replacer product to give the brownies more "lift".  I've been happy with this recipe in the past....and really happy with the end result tonight with the alterations I listed above.  Excellent warm out of the oven.  This will be my go-to brownie recipe.

I used this as a base recipe, switched out white sugar with coconut sugar and used coconut oil. Also I used less oil cus it seemed quite a lot. 
I made two, and used  whole wheat flour for one of them. 
I made one batch with dark chocolate chips and one with cashew nuts and sea salt, the results are amazing! Got a tint of coconut taste tho, but personally I like it, great as a base recipe!

Best vegan brownies I've ever had. Although to make them, I use vegetable shortening instead of oil and I break up pieces of ghiradelli dark chocolate to mix in with the batter. I also bake them a little longer. Gives it a little something extra that everyone has loved. I made 4 batches for a Hurricane Sandy relief bake sale and they sold out within 20 minutes. Long before anything else. Kudos to you and thank you for sharing this amazing creation

I just made these and they are pretty good. I cut the whole recipe in half (I used 1/2 cup of cocoa) and baked in my 8X8 glass pyrex dish. I took the advice of others and replaced half of the oil with apple sauce. I also decided to add a TBSP of ground flaxseed, it's a great binder. Instead of water I used milk. After the batter was poured in the baking dish I sprinkled chocolate chips over the top. I baked it @ 350 for 25 min. Tastes pretty good. Will certainly make again! I might smear a little chocolate frosting on the top and sprinkle walnuts on the top. Give it some love. ;)

I made these for a friend who can't have dairy. These turned out surprisingly yummy. They're super chocolatey and rich. Everyone loved them. They were very moist and fudgy, but they didn't hold their shape very well...that could have been because we all ate the whole pan before it had time to cook off completely. Very yummy!

BEST BROWNIES EVER. i tried to make these yesterday but forgot the sugar! today i made them and switched up the recipe a little. i added 1 splenda and 1 cup white sugar, instead of water i added 1 cup vanilla soy milk and 3/4 cup veg oil instead of 1 cup. i also added 1/2 tsp espresso powder and i can tell you these are THE best brownies i have ever had. not too sweet, not to rich, and not lacking of flavor at all. i was scared to try it because of all of the changes i made, but they came out sooo yummy and not crumbly at all. GIVE THESE A TRY!

One of the guys I work with is vegan & he requests these brownies every year for his birthday.  I cut back the oil to 1/2 cup & use grape seed oil & replace the other 1/2 cup of oil with unsweetened applesauce.  I've used Dutch processes cocoa, but the best cocoa to use is Hershey's Special Dark cocoa.  Very rich & chocolaty.  The texture is a little odd since there are no eggs, but everyone seems to like them.  I, however, still prefer non-vegan brownies!

I like the flavor, but the texture was off. I measured exactly per the recipe, I tend to make it that way on the first try. But it didn't hold together, it was a bit cakey and the bottom layer kind of slipped away from the top. (A thin bottom layer stayed on the spatula as I put the brownie on a plate.) Maybe it was the cup of oil. Next time I will use some applesauce to replace some oil and use a non-dairy milk vs water. Then add in chocolate chips or chunks.  But by then its NOT this recipe anymore. I think it can definitely be improved upon.

This recipe is great! Tastes like normal brownies, without having to use any weird ingredients. I actually had all the ingredients already so didn't have to go to the store for egg-replacements etc. Since I was making these for my anniversary, after reading some of the other comments I did decide to add a little extra flavor w/ coconut milk instead of water and also by substituting most of the oil w/ melted vegan margarine. It's great how basic the recipe is so that you can substitute whatever you feel like, and was exactly what I was looking for: basic, cheap, quick, easy, delicious. Didn't have a brownie recipe w/out some sort of egg-replacer, so this was wonderful. It did seem like a lot of sugar, maybe because I don't bake much, but kept w/ the recipe and it came out tasting like normal brownies (which I was going for, since my husband's an omnivore & choco-holic)! He loves these :) Maybe next time (as I WILL be making these again) I will get even more creative & healthy, w/in reason of course, by using some avocado in place of the oil (other people suggested applesauce which I will try too) & less sugar (maybe substituting with some banana and agave syrup), & adding some strong coffee as part of the liquid component to make it even more chocolatey. Mine wasn't very crumbly at all (didn't overbake, went just by the directions), but would like to make it a smidge more fudgey so maybe using avocado would do the trick. Great basic recipe! I love it, thank you for sharing :)

Gooey, chewy, fudgy, yummmmmm.  I'm a brownie freak and these are everything a brownie is supposed to be.  My "omg, these are the best brownies I've ever had" recipe when I want to wow a non-vegan and show them how completely unnecessary eggs are in modern baking.  Have made this recipe at least 30 times, it never fails.  I took the advice of one of the commenters and added a middle layer of (vegan, of course) dark chocolate chips, which only adds to the perfect texture of this awesome recipe.  The only other difference is I usually cut some of the oil with applesauce.  I've taken these brownies to work, to pot lucks, to get-togethers... all I've ever gotten is rave after rave after rave.  I want this recipe on my tombstone.

I tried Certified MOxie's tips and mixed the water and flour first and let it sit for few minutes before adding everything else, and I used vegetable shortening instead of oil (not quite a full cup).  I also used raw sugar.  I added a few splashes of my morning coffee too and just mix it all with a fork.  Finally, I used mini muffin tins because I am taking these to a potluck.  Omg I just ate the first one- YUM!  I am a crappy cook and please note I did use another recipe last night (Best Brownies) and tried to vegenize it by using egg substitute and olive oil in place of butter and eggs.  They came out very oily and not so good.  As I am going to a potluck I thought I better try again and voila-- the brownies came out fab!! I think the tips from Certified Moxie helped a lot.  I am not a huge brownie fan, but these are rather luscious.  I have to try not to eat more bfore the potluck now.

This recipe was decent but I would suggest a few modifications. To avoid the brownies from crumbling, mix the water with the dry ingredients before adding the oil (took that suggestion from another review). Also, I thought that 1 cup of oil was WAY too much. I used 1/2 cup and they turned out fine. These brownies are a bit bland, I think next time I will add a spoon of coffee to bring out the flavor a bit more.

I agree with other reviewers who said this brownie is crumbly. Reading that I tried mixing the flour with water first, but that was a mistake because the amount of water required for this recipe resulted in a dough that resulted in clumps that I then I had to break up. Which was way more work than I would ever recommend anyone do for the results of this recipe. I've tried other vegan brownie recipes and this one isn't one I would repeat again. I also don't understand why people rate a recipe so high when you have to make so many adjustments to the original recipe. Flavor-wise this was just okay, texture-wise it's crumbly and does not have that gooey goodness of a brownie. I won't be using this recipe again.

I am not vegan but was looking for a chocolate cake or brownie recipe that didn't call for eggs.  I didn't have eggs in the fridge and didn't feel like running to the grocery store.  This recipe is a keeper and satisfied my chocolate urge.  Like others, I made adjustments to the original recipe.  After reading through several comments I decided to cut the oil to 1/2 what it calls for.  I used cold strong coffee in place of water.  I added the flour and coffee together and let it sit while I gathered the rest of the ingreds. Then I just added it all together (didn't sift...I forgot!) I used less sugar and replaced raw for white.  Lastly, since I love the taste of chocolate, I added a bit more cocoa and stirred in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Baked about 35 minutes and it was done.  Next time I am adding walnuts!

I followed other some other reviewers suggestions and added peanut butter and frosting. They turned out great! Instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil, I did 3/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. I also added in 1/4 cup of natural peanut butter to the batter. Spray the pan well with cooking spray and cook for 30 minutes. I also added frosting, which was 1 can of Pillsbury Supreme Creamy Vanilla (listed on PETA's accidentally vegan site, so 99% vegan), mixed with 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter and 2 tablespoons of vanilla almond milk. Mix with electric beaters. Spread over brownies. Let sit in refrigerator overnight and then cut into squares. I kept them in the fridge and we ate them cold. They turned out really yummy and not crumbly at all! They almost had a fudge like consistency.

I followed the recipe exactly, but in term of ingredients, but like one reviewer said, I allowed the water and flour to sit together longer for gluten to form.  They were FANTASTIC squares of gooey awesomeness!!!  Would make again and again until I die!

These taste even better than traditional brownies with eggs.  The plus side is that you can lick the spoon with no worries.

Not the best but I don't bake vegan brownies so I don't have a base for comparison. The texture was not what I would expect from a brownie. All I did was reduce the oil and add soymilk but not enough that would majorly change the taste or texture. I am vegetarian and I had no idea that white sugar had animal bone char in it until I read a review on here. Ideally I would like to only use raw sugar but its not cheap.

I was not a fan of this recipe. Vegan baked goods are usually fantastic, and this was an exception. The brownies came out much too cakey, and the flavor was definitely...off. It wasn't rich and chocolatey at all. Definitely disappointed. :/ Maybe next time.

The issue with this recipe being crumbly/not sticking together can easily be resolved (as can most any vegan recipe lacking eggs) by adding the flax seed substitute equivalent to a couple of eggs.  This mixture consists of 1 heaping Tbsp. ground flax seed + 1/4 cup water for each egg "missing".  I make this substitution for many baked good recipes to "veganize" them and it works wonders.  With this recipe I simply added the equivalent of 2 eggs worth of the beaten flax seed mixture (it even thickens like eggs when beaten with a wand-type hand mixer for 30 seconds or so) - it left the brownies a bit more cake-like and fully stuck together..not to mention the added nutritional value it adds to each treat!  I did not find the oil to be excessive as other reviewers mentioned - this may be due to the extra binding material provided by the flax seed mixture that helped keep the oil from separating out...in any case, the recipe turned out great for me and the brownies were a perfect texture.

Ok I don't know how fair my rating is I changed the recipe quite a bit to make them a little more healthy and lapband friendly.I used canned pumpkin inplace of the oil I used equal packets in place of the sugar and instead of water I used coffee over all Its certainly not like a Real Brownie but when im craving something sweet like a brownie these will defiantly do!

Very good basic recipe but I agree too much oil.  I lowered it to 3/4 cup and increased the almond milk I used in place of water to 1 1/2 cups.  I also increased the cocoa to 1 cup, and added 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cayenne powder, 2 Tablespoons of arrowroot powder and 2 tsp of baking powder for a more cake like brownie. I increased the time to 45 minutes as well.  I enjoy taking a simple and good recipe and shifting things slightly to fit our tastes and what we have on hand.

Great recipe for my niece and nephew who have dairy, soy and egg allergies. Made a few adjustments after reading all the comments. Used 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup almond milk, 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup canola oil. They came out yummy, and the batter was great too!!

These brownies are fabulous! No one was able to guess that they were vegan, they`re so cakey and delicious! The first time I made them they were a little oily, so I substituted half of the oil for applesauce, which made them perfect! Definitely my go-to brownie recipe from now on.

I literally joined this website just so I could comment about these brownies. I'm the type of girl that if you get near a dessert table will be stuck there all night long. I recently went dairy and egg-free and I got so excited to see a simple vegan brownie recipe! Alas, my excitement was short lived. The texture was wrong, and the taste was barely there.

I cooked these for a bonfire party and everyone said they were the best brownies ever,and only one out of thirty were vegan! to make them even more chocolaty i added half a bag of vegan dark choc chips to the recipe and then 10 mins before the end of the bake i sprinkled the other half on top to melt. Quite simply delicious. i was a little daunted when i added the water as it seemed too much but just keep stirring and it all goes in! I used extra virgin olive oil which i think made it a little richer and demerara sugar instead of white. enjoy!

Yummy!  I just made these and they were really great.  I have to add, like a lot of people I made a change only I did it because I found I didn't have enough cocoa in the cupboard.  Feeling too lazy and wanting brownies too much, instead of going to the store to get more cocoa I substituted some of the Ovaltine I had left.  Wow!  super good, only beware because the mixture started to foam up a bit and then I had to put a baking sheet under the pan because the mixture started to overflow in the oven.  My own fault of course, but still.  I will eat these delicious brownies and crumbs by hand as well as on ice cream.  Sometimes mistakes make the best treats!

I made these today and they were delicious - very chewy/gooey too! I used melted Vitalite in place of vegetable oil.  In the UK, a few of the big brand sugars such as Silver Spoon supply white sugar which is suitable for vegetarians/vegans.  However, they do say that their brown sugars may be refined with bone charcoal by the suppliers.  Everyone in my family (non-vegans!) loved these. They're very rich though so cut them up small-ish :)

Brilliant - so easy to follow and no oily residue either! I will definately be using this recipe again and again. But one thing I did was to mix the flour and water together first, let it site for a minute then add all the other ingrediants in. Brilliant!

This was my first attemp at vegan bakin, and I think this was a good place to start. The reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it was not truly vegan, but that was easy to fix. I swapped out the white sugar for raw, and used an unbleached whole grain flour or something like that that my husband got at the grocery store. I used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and 3/4 of apple sauce. Lastly, I used almost 1 cup of the cocoa powder as opposed to 3/4. These came out VERY moist. It took them a little longer to bake, close to 35 minutes, before I finally felt they weren't too gooey. The first piece I tried was a corner and it was a little dry, but I just had another bite of the middle portion and it was delicious. My husband loved them. I will definitely make these again!

Very yummy, but I'm only giving 4 stars because of modifications per another reviewer... subbed brewed coffee for water, and used 1/4 cup oil plus 3/4 cup applesauce to cut down on fat.  Very yummy and low fat/healthy.

Great vegan brownies. Not too oily. I added 1/4 cup chocolate sauce to amp up the flavor a notch!

wanting something sweet when you have not eggs, butter or milk.. hard to find something tasty. But this recipe fit the bill. delicious, sweet and it will keep you coming back. My husband was  a little hesitant because of the word vegan, but even he loved them. I will use this recipe every time I make brownies.  They did not come out oily, or crumbling. They were the perfect brownie.

I made these for my son who has egg and dairy allergies. I added some semi- sweet chocolate chips and some mini marshmallows, and baked for 33 mins. They were fabulous!! Will definitely make these often.

These are great! My husband did not believe they were vegan... said they were the best brownies he has ever had. I did add more water and less oil and they came out perfect. I don't do a lot in the microwave but if you're ever in a chocolate meltdown, try 1/4 the recipe in the microwave for 3 to 3 1/2 min. It's at least as good as the oven, maybe better.

The only change was we used 1 cup soy milk rather than water, used only 1/4 cup oil and added 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce. Came out GREAT... we also made a frosting out of 1/4 cup vegan butter, 1/4 cup soy milk, 2 cups powdered sugar, 3/4 cups unsweetened coco powder and 1 tsp vanilla.... YUMMY!

Thanks for making my saturday afternoon Sandy! 
I cut the recipe down by 4,so the yield was 4 fat brownies, and baked for 10 extra min than in your recipe because I wanted chewy brownies, not very gooey ones. I used extra light tasting olive oil, and brown sugar instead of white. It all worked fine, they were sooo good. Thanks for sharing.

I cut the recipe in half and used 2 oz of unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa powder, used evaporated cane juice sugar and used 1/4 cup canola oil. I baked it in a toaster oven in a round cake pan for 27ish minutes. I was hoping for more of a chewy gooey brownie, but it turned out more like bread. The outside was kind of crunchy, and the center was like cake. Maybe I should have used cocoa powder instead? I don't know.

These were yummy. My kids loved them and my son asked for them for his birthday instead of cake. My only complaint was that they make to many crumbs, maybe I overcooked them.

I have made these several times from another site where the directions were slightly different (amounts the same) but the result was very good. Take a half cup of the flour and the cup of water and bring to a boil, whisking to make a smooth paste, let cool. Combine one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar with the cocoa, oil, vanilla, and salt. When water/flour mix has cooled add to the sugar/oil mixture. Take the remaining flour and the baking powder and add in. I have found that using some extra cocoa adds a richness to the baked brownie. Also, adding additional vanilla makes for a smoother taste. I also put in chocolate chips or toffee bits, then I bake for about twenty minutes in an eight by eight pan. Cool and then cut easily - the result is a good sized, moist and chocolatey brownie, not bad for no eggs, no butter!

I followed the instructions by glutenfreemommyof3. They turned out delicious! The whole family loved them.  I think I'll use 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce so they are not as cakey. But it is very hard to get a gluten free, egg free, dairy free brownie that is goey. Very simple and quick for EVERYONE to enjoy. Thank you so VERY much. this will be well used at home and at church potlucks!

These brownies are good!  Not just for vegan, for brownies by any standard.  I have made these dozens of times and they please everyone from every walk of like regardless of their diet requirements.  As with all brownie recipes, it is important not to over stir the batter.  In fact, never make brownies with a mixer...always by hand.  The crumb will be tender and the density will be gorgeous!

Very moist and rich.  I added 1 cup of natural chocolate chips and I used granulated Splenda instead of sugar.  I also tried making them in a mini muffin pan (with papers) and topping them with a shmear of Nutella spread. Its a very versatile recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Great texture, yummy and gooey. The chocolate flavor is not as rich as i was hoping it to be. I am not vegan, but to make them more chocolately, one could add vegan chocolate chips. And a bit of coffee would do the trick also!

edited to add: I *also* just made these with coconut oil (about half of what is suggested turns out best) and shredded coconut - DELICIOUS and so easy to make - I always cut the recipe in half now and still make them in a pie pan. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just made these and they turned out soooo GOOD! I cut the oil (I used olive oil and it's delicious) to 1/2 a cup and used 1 & 1/2 cups water with it - I also added pecans. It took about twice as long to cook for me but I used a large pie pan and it was pretty full. Anyways, YUM! Thanks!! I'll make these again and probably try to use apple sauce next time for a healthier version. Oh yeah, and make sure to use raw sugar so they stay vegan! :-)

Pretty good...not your typical dense fudge brownie taste, but still delicious.  I halved the recipe and baked for 25 min in 8x8 glass pan. I subbed half the oil for applesauce, used half sugar in the raw and half splenda, and used 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate bar.  Tastes more like very moist chocolate cake/chocolate bread pudding rather than dense, fudgy brownie, but I am happy!

Followed this recipe to a T.  The taste of these was good. However, they completely crumbled and I couldn't get them out of the pan without having crumbs everywhere.  Wish I tried them before bringing them to a dinner party.

I tried this earlier today and I loved them! I've tried other vegan brownies that were disasters but these were just great.

I only added half the oil because a whole cup seems like way too much. So I put 1 1/2 cups of water and  1/2 cup of oil and I also added chopped walnuts and half a cup of carob chips! They gave these brownies gooey little pockets of carob that made them almost like a lava cake. These were great! I'm going to make them again soon.

When I wrote this recipe down I didn't have any eggs in the house. Then I changed my mind about it. I found it tonight and decided to actually try it for fun. It's really good! We choped up some milky way bars into bits and put them on top. Great addition! If I find myself eggless and cravin brownies I will make again. I would also recomend to a friend.

used applesauce in place of oil.  these don't have a rich chocolate taste, more like flour..?  and the texture is weird.  at least mine did not crumble i guess.

Not only the best Vegan brownie, but the BEST Brownie of any kind. I added some vegan Chocolate chips in the mix. The center was nice and gooey, almost like a lava cake. Once they were fully cooled they held together well, not crumbly at all.

I'm new to vegan cooking so I thought, "Hey, I'll just replace ALL of the oil with applesauce!". Bad idea. Super gummy! :( Better luck next time...

These are sooo good! My daughter and I are allergic to dairy and eggs so this recipe is perfect! I mada a couple changes.....I subbed half of the oil for applesauce and threw some dairy free chocolate chips as soon as it was done baking. As soon as the chocolate chips melted I carefully spread all over the top with a spatula.....it turned out great!

AWFUL. Just awful.  Too much flour, not sweet enough and overall just too chewy.  I substituted the cup of oil for applesauce (per all my baking) and these came out just so bad.  It was like eating brown chewy flour and baking soda.  Fortunately I only made a 1/2 batch so I didn't have to waste too many ingredients....

I just wanted brownies cuz I had mad cravings. Didn't have normal ingredients for brownies. I did not have cocoa powder, so I reduced the sugar and omitted the salt and used my favorite gourmet hot cocoa mix because it already has sugar and salt in it. I used 1 1/2 C sugar 1 C cocoa mix and I also added pecans and raspberry syrup flavoring!!! The end result was a chocolaty, moist, slightly raspberry flavored, hot cocoa cake. It was not the texture of a brownie. At all. Maybe on the edge but just because I had to cook it longer than the time mentioned I think. It was still great, who doesn't love chocolate cake.

This was the first Vegan recipe that I've ever attempted.  I really liked how simple this was.  I made them for a group of friends, only one of whom was vegan, and they all gobbled them up.  I have since received a stern talking to in that I'm not allowed to show up to any group functions unless I have these brownies with me.  I have since tried a gluten free version using a gluten free rice flour in place of the All purpose (used the same measurement)  I tossed in 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum.  They turned out great and my gluten free friend told me they were better then the ones she buys at the gluten free bakery.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

My son made these brownies for me, as I have milk and egg allergies, as well as being gluten-intolerant. He substituted rice and arrowroot flour for the wheat flour and added 1/8 t of xanthan gum (which takes care of all crumbliness issues). Baking them for 25 minutes and then broiling briefly on low on a lower rack worked quite well.  Our friends, who do not have the same sensitivities absolutely loved these brownies and requested the recipe.  We also thought that dairy-free chocolate chips would be a nice addition.

I made these last night with my egg and dairy allergic son in mind.  I have tried box mix with egg replacer a few times with no success.   I halved the recipe for an 8x8 pan.  Based on other suggestions I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, coffee instead of water, and added carob chips for fun.  These turned out quite well.  Flavor was good (my husband say's bland)  They were moist ad held together pretty well.  They don't taste like non-vegan brownies.  I would call them a brownie-like vegan dessert.  My daughter had 2 last night, and asked for one after breakfast this morning.  I will definitely make these again.

Very good.  I substituted strong brewed coffee for the water and vanilla soymilk for the oil. Instead of the 2nd. cup of white sugar , I used brown and I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I also added 1/2 cup carob chips.  Yum!!

My fiance fasts alot of the year (meaning no dairy or meat) and he has a real big sweet tooth. I made these for him and he absolutely loves them. They are really tastey. Even I like them and i usually do not like vegan treats. I altered the recipe a tad i just added some crushed almonds and it gave it that little something extra.! Bravo!  Thanks alot i will definately be keeping this for his fasting sweet tooth.

Fantastic! Some of the best vegan baked goods I've ever made. I halved the recipe and substituted almond milk for water, halved the amount of oil and made up for it with almond milk. I substituted two squares of non-sweetened, 100% caocao baking chocolate for the caocao powder. They came out super rich and dark. I also used whole wheat flower and raw sugar.  These things came out ooey-gooey and just top-knotch. Next time I'll add coffee and vegan chocolate chips.

I was searching for an egg-free brownie recipe and came across this one. The brownies turned out good but I did have to make an adjustment with regards to the oil.  I agreed with others that there was just too much oil in this recipe. I actually got rid of the oil altogether and replaced it with 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce.

Hi guys!  This is my first vegan baking experience and my first entry on this website! I also had to make it sugar-free as my boyfriend is diabetic.     I need help! The brownie didn't rise at all-is it supposed to? It is almost exactly the same thickness as it was wet. I used splenda instead of sugar, and whole wheat flour instead of regular flour, could that be why?     Any ideas as to why would be much appreciated!

VERY Good! They were quick, easy and very tasty. My 4 year old even helped me whip them together while I was making dinner. I was concerned about the amount of sugar, but they taste great and not too sweet.

The first (second and third, lol) time I made these, I followed the original recipe and they were AMAZING.  They were so moist and gooey...people didn't even know they were vegan. This last time I made them I used only 1 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup melted margarine, and a 1/2 cup of canola/vegetable oil, to make them a wee bit healthier.  They're still pretty amazing, although I had to bake them about ten minutes longer than usual, and they're not nearly as gooey.  But its well worth the trade-off.  They're still delicious.

I made these for a friend with egg, dairy, and corn allergies. They were AWESOME! I halved the recipe, added a *little* less oil, and replaced the baking powder with baking soda and cream of tartar. I will definitely be making these again. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Definitely the best vegan brownie recipe I've tried to date - I've made them in the past with oil and had disastrous results, so I used vegetable shortening.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and mixed the flour and water together and let it sit for a bit before adding other ingredients.  I also added a generous helping of dark chocolate chips and put some instant espresso powder in the water.  The flavor is awesome and they are quite gooey even baked at maximum time, but they were still FAR too greasy.  Next time I will consider halving the shortening.  A great base recipe to work with.

I used wheat flour instead of white, so I am positive that is why I didn't like it. I just hate using overly processed white flour. I'll try this again using it instead though...

Mine came out really crumbly....what did I do?  I switched sugar to splenda could that do it?  I also used olive oil, not something I would recommend in the future, there is enough that I could taste it.

These are more like "cakies" but they taste just like those old Snackin' Cakes. These are worth about 3 stars but because they are so easy to throw together and bake they deserve the extra star. Despite their 3 star taste, I can't help eating them until I feel sick. That's a sign of something good!

The recipe was great, the brownies are really good with ice-cream and you can freeze the brownies to keep them longer and then microwave them when you want to eat them.

I cut the recipe in half, subbed most the oil for applesauce, an used 1/2c cocoa [[easier measuring]]. Besides those lil changes I added the rest of my Praline Sundae Topping [[this site]] which made it look unbaked..would not do that part again. But I was really looking for something to finish it off an thought brownies sounded good but had no eggs. This recipe was great!! Thank yaa thank yaa

Absolutely delicious.  I was so happy to find this recipe for my 3 year old son who has severe food allergies to dairy, egg, peanuts, and treenuts.  We all love them.  I also add dairy free mini chocolate chips to them.  Will also try the applesauce.  Sounds great.  I am so thankful for this site.

These were pretty darn good for being so easy. I halved the recipe and used 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce instead of all oil. I used my "mini" baking pan which is about 6"x10.5" They did take almost 35 minutes and were still "shiny on top" but cooked perfectly.  I tried one about 30 minutes after they came out of the oven then put the rest in the fridge. I preferred the fridge ones... they got very fudgy...not crumbly at all. I may see how they taste frozen.

OMG these are the best brownies EVER...Vegan or not.  Recipes can be so hard to convert to Vegan, so having one that is already Vegan is wonderful.  Thanks to you, I have a great recipe that my whole family loves, even though I am the only Vegan in the house!

I made these twice once with all sorts of recommended adjustments, applesauce, chocolate chips, coffee, etc. they were horrible weird fudge blocks.  Disappointed and craving a brownie I made again following the recipe almost exactly- I halved it and used vegan margarine and raw sugar. They were amazing! And were superlative with a bit of vanilla rice 'icecream'.  (note: in rsponse to a few posts vegan food does equal diet food)

These brownies were so delicous!!  I wanted to make some brownies with my daughter but we didn't have any eggs.  These are better than any other boxed brownie mix I've used!  I won't be going back to boxed stuff again!

Great recipe for a novice vegan cook. I followed the recipe faithfully for the first batch and they were good, but with the second batch I used approximately 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 a cup of mashed bananas and just a tad more sugar (I use brown sugar) and they were delicious. When i was licking the spoon the batter tasted so good that I was worried for a second that I had added something non-vegan! ;-)

This recipe is pretty good for vegan brownies. For some reason they came out nothing like the picture. I cut out 1 cup of the sugar and I can tell, any suggestions for what to substitute the other 1 cup of sugar with? would applesauce work?

I've made a few vegan brownies so far since becoming a vegan and these were fantastic! I baked them a couple of minutes longer and they werent gooey but had a very moist slightly crumbly texture. Very choclatey and addictive. I can end my search for vegan brownies!

These brownies were exactly what I was looking for!  My son has a dairy allergy so sometimes it is difficult to find sweets that he can eat!  My only complaint is that they are very crumbly and messy - not exactly ideal for a toddler, but we make it work!  The second time I made these I frosted with a dairy free chocolate frosting!  YUM!

YUM!  I made these for my vegan friend, and, of course, tried a couple.  They are SO good, a fellow taste tester (non vegan) said, " these are the best brownies I've ever had".  They are very gooey, so I might bake a few minutes longer.  One piece of advice, don't stack these brownies!  I made that mistake and the tops of the bottom layer stuck to the top layer.   All in all a great vegan option.  The only change I made was replaced the 1 cup oil with 1/2 cup oil 1/2 cup applesauce.

I halved the recipe, and made it according to the directions. They were chocolatey and fudgy, but soooooo oily. When I put them on the plate to serve them, there were beads of oil left on the plate after my friends ate them. Partway through cooking, I took them out of the oven and tried to soak up excess oil on the top of the brownies with a paper towl. I don't know if they would be moist and fudgy without all the oil, but if I make these again, I'll modify the recipe and try to reduce the oil it calls for. I also greased the pan, and can't remember if the recipe said to do so, but that could be another source for excess oil. I'm not super familiar with vegan baking techniques, so perhaps there are other substitutions that could be used to reduce the oil (like applesauce or pumpkin...?).

I prepared these brownies, exactly according to the recipe to accomodate a family keeping Kosher as well as egg allergies.  They were delicious!  No one at the party believed they were vegan.  My advice to all the other reviews and recipe-changers out there--don't change a thing.  If dessert is really what you want, follow the recipe.  Yes, it is a lot of oil, but since when are brownies health food?  They received raves from all and were quickly gobbled up.  I also served them w/ soy vanilla "ice cream" and fresh berry sauce.  Yum!

These brownies are the bombdiggity!  My kids are allergic to dairy & eggs, so I try A LOT of vegan recipes trying to give them some sense of normalcy.  These brownies are the best I've ever had, vegan or otherwise!  I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, and subbed in 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil. Oh, and I threw in a dash of almond extract (artificial... nut allergy too).  They're fantastic!

These are very gooey and chewy and delicious!! They always come out perfect. I like to add chocolate chips to them which makes them REALLY tasty, but then I guess they're not vegan anymore.

I must admit I was skeptical as were the nonvegans I'm living with at the moment, but I've made these brownies twice and they haven't lasted very long.  

The only change I made was to cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added about a tbsp of water.

The ingredients are easy to find and the recipe is ridiculously easy.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

These were the yummiest brownies I have made in a long time. I didn't have eggs and wanted to make something chocolatey and found this recipe. I will sub applesauce or prune sauce next time instead of so much oil. My family LOVES these brownies!

These brownies are awesome! I made a few modifications after reading some of the reviews on here. I added a splash of almond extract, used dark chocolate cocoa powder, and added an equivalent of 1 egg using Ener G egg replacer to avoid a crumbly brownie. I topped it with powdered sugar and they were a huge success. My boyfriend LOVED them and I'll be bringing a pan to a staff meeting tomorrow (another attempt at confusing my staff into veganism!)

These are soo good. I needed to clean out my fridge and these brownies worked perfect for that. Used 1/2c. oil, 1/2 c. pomegranate apple sauce... 1/2c. coffee & 1/2 Lite chocolate soymilk... Added some dried cranberries to these and they are amazing.

This is the best Vegan brownie recipe ever... We make them in the small muffin trays as well. The bite size brownies are great for travelling and lunches. One addition we have tried is adding Carob chips to the mix..

I used 1 cup almond milk, 1/2 cup coconut oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, sprouted wheat flour, and rapidura.  It baked nicely- 25 minutes in a baking stone bar pan- but it was definitely more cake than brownie.  Not bad tasting though.  My husband will enjoy it with some fresh-made almond milk.

What a great little brownie! I'm not vegan but I needed a recipe that didn't include traditional brownie ingredients (eggs, butter, etc) because I didn't have any on hand and this recipe was a life saver! I spooned the (wonderfully gooey) batter by the TBSP into greased muffin tins and baked 20 min. Once they cool I will flatten them and top with hot fudge, pudding and a chocolate covered cherry for a unique brownie/cake treat. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I took the advice from the other reviews by subsituting half of the oil for half of a banana puree (even though it took about 10 additional min. to bake.) I also took put in gluten/wheat-free flour and rice milk since my brother is allergic to gluten, wheat and dairy. Usually when you alter something to make it gluten/wheat-free it doesn't taste as good and that also goes for some vegan recipes but this was a hit and tasted the same as standard brownies! This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was just ok.  I followed the recommendations to reduce the oil and sub applesauce, (1/3 oil, 2/3 applesauce for the oil).  These turned out more cake like and I prefer chewy so maybe next time, I will use more oil.

There were pretty good, and I say this coming from the perspective of a non-vegan.  I did not have problems with them being crumbly at all.  If anything, they were too moist! I followed others' suggestions and used 1 cup AP flour, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup apple sauce, 2 TBS oil, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp baking soda, and a pinch of salt.  If doing it again, I would probably cut down on the water and add a bit more oil.  These brownies weren't as rich as I wanted them to be.

Didn't have any eggs on hand, so this recipe saved the day. Made *exactly* as directed, but they turned out rather oily. Taste was okay but noticably not your "usual" brownie. I probably won't repeat these--unless I find myself eggless again:)

Uh-maz-ING. There are certainly variations that could make it taste different, but there's not much that could actually make them taste better.

yay vegan brownies! I've made this recipe several times with my friends, and it is always a hit- with vegans and non-vegans alike. they are quick and easy to make. a few suggestions: the recipe calls for way too much oil (as previously mentioned), which can give the brownies a funny taste.  I usually reduce the oil to 1/2 cup and use 1/2 a mashed ripe banana to keep it moist and fluffy.  I also increase the amount of water (probably by a little over 1/4 cup). I also like my brownies to be very chocolatey, so I use around 1 1/4 cups cocoa powder and add in chocolate chips.    I've found that they take a little longer to bake too, maybe  closer to 40 minutes, but this may depend on the pan size and oven.  Play around with the recipe according to your tastes, there are a lot of great modifications that can be made.

These are the best dairy-free brownies I have tried yet! I use mostly applesauce instead of the oil, and depending on what I have on hand I add in nuts, dried fruit, or chocolate chips. Very versatile recipe.

I made these brownies for my milk/egg allergic daughter. They were not anything like "real" brownies. They were rather rubbery and had a funny sweetness to them. I am sad to say my search for an egg and dairy free brownie will continue!

By far my favorite brownie recipe, don't tell your friends and they'll never know it's vegan. Two things, I cut the sugar down by almost half and you can't tell the difference. Also out of personal preference and nagging from friends I cut the time down by 10 minutes we all prefer a half baked brownie. MMMM delicious and soo easy.

I opted to cut the fat in half and use half of the oil in the recipe and use applesauce to suplement.  I used high quality dark cocoa, so that was good.  They are a little cakey for my liking and you can definitely taste the oil.  These aren't like eating the real deal, but they'll do if you can't have the real deal...

I love these brownies.  I would probably use less oil next time though.  They are a bit greasy when they first come out.  Probably replace half the oil with Wonderslim next time.  I added a half bag of vegan chocolate chips to the batter too - yummy. And these freeze great.  
The only problem is that I can't stop eating them!

These were very good for no-egg brownies. My Dad is allergic to eggs, so I'm always hunting for recipes he can eat. He'd never had brownies before. These were more cakey than real brownies, but they tasted good.

Not good- they tasted really weird, not like brownies. I measured everything exactly and added choclate chips but they still didn't taste right. I'll keep looking- thanks anyway.

Loved them.  I'm newly vegan and still remember how the real deal tastes.  I did add vegan chocolate chips and vegan sugar.

These are great, as is. Ridiculously simple, this recipe can surely meet a LOT of different needs (cheap, fast to prepare, vegan, etc) and it is definitely less complicated and more tasty than a lot of vegan brownies I have tried! Bake them now!

Finally, my quest for an eggfree brownie that tastes and has the texture of a real brownie has come to an end!

I did make some modifications, however, to accomodate the ingredients I had on hand:

-water was increased to about 1.5 cups
-oil was decreased to a couple tbsps of olive oil
-I threw in an individual-sized container of apple-mango sauce (about 1/4 cup) remembering that apple-strawberry doesn't work in brownies and not having plain applesauce on hand :-)
-I increased the baking time by 15-20 minutes (I kept adding five minutes until the only the centre was still gooey)

These were really awesome, thanks!

These brownies are AMAZING!  I've had a hard time finding good vegan brownies, but these are it.  My changes: cut down the sugar to about 1.5 cups; used 3/4 c. coffee + 1/4 c. soymilk instead of 1 c. water; and  1/4 c. oil + 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce instead of 1 c. oil.  I also threw in 1 cup of semisweet chunks and 1/2 c. walnuts.  So delicious - gooey and finger-lickable! :)

I made a third the recipe and baked it for 20 minutes.  The flavor wasn't very chocolaty.  Pieces tended to separate into top and bottom halves without being crumbly.  There was no oiliness.  The top tasted great.  Overall, comparable to non-vegan brownies but not the best.

This didn't really do it for me.
They are like 2nd rate brownies, and as a brownie lover, this was a big disappointment. They do have a chocolatey *taste* but it is mostly masked by a vegetable oil taste. Also, I only have whole wheat flour and that may have made it taste a little "whole-grainier" than what I would like in a dessert. Still, I put them together in under 5 minutes and they're vegan! so that's a bonus.

Oh yum!! These are WONDERFUL. I made half a batch and added Starbucks Yukon blend instead of water, cut the oil a little and added some vanilla soymilk. I added a bit more cocoa, too. I didn't cook as long as suggested, maybe 15 minutes. They were soft, gooey and wonderful! I've been a vegan for a few weeks, and have been dying without chocolate! Thanks so much!

Excellent taste and mouth feel, but the pieces crumble when you try to take them out of the pan onto the plate. But we'll definitely be making this one again because the taste was so fantastic!

I made these for a friend with egg/milk/soy/corn allergies. She was delighted to be able to have this treat, and raved about it.

 If I make them again I will keep in mind this: at the end of the required cooking time the brownies seemed undercooked. By the time the center seemed done it was infact burnt. I did have some brownies in a seperate pan that friend said were perfect once they say out and cooled. I will trust the recipe next time!

these were great my vegan friends loved them and to who ever wrote that sugar is not vegan is stupid are you serious how dumb can people be? But these brownies were great i used oat flour and wheat flour and used organic turbanado sugar to make them healthier and i think the oat and wheat flour make these more moist and yummy!

Very moist!! I halved the recipe, baked in an 8X8 inch pan and added an egg. I know it's no longer vegan. I was actually looking for a no milk brownie recipe--I will make again!

I think a better name for this recipe would be gummy cocoa bars, they really stick to your teeth!!...in a yummy good way.  I did make some change: used apple sauce in place of some oil and added some nuts (extra delicious!!). everyone loved them. will make agin soon.

Made half a batch, used normal all purpose flour.I sprinkled the top with chocolate chips and baked in a 
8X8in. pyrex pan for about 25 minutes. It was sooo easy to make and really good. A big hit at our family gathering. moist and chocolatey, somewhat crumbly and delicious! I think the chocolate chips are a must, cuz they give it that extra moistness and chocolatyness. I am not a vegan, but these are really great and easy brownies to make in a pinch!

Awesome brownies. I used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. 4 days later they were still moist. I added some vegan chocolate chips too. I just put a batch in the oven a few minutes ago, I used dark cocoa, and the batter tasted great, RICH!

Great recipe

These were mediocre but it could have been because I used half oil and half applesauce per other reviews. They were more cake than brownie, but they were edible...I've had worse vegan brownies.

Okay, where is the cook? I need to kiss her! OMG these are SO SO good. I saw this recipe and actually thought they would not turn out okay. I  used vanilla soy milk instead of water, applesauce instead of oil  and used black cocoa AND regular cocoa and added some semi sweet chips on the top. MAN alive this is one amazing recipe. My brownies are a little cakey, but I must say I've never met a cake OR a brownie I didn't like so that is fine with me. They are decadent, rich, and fantastic. Will make over and over. Now, if I could just figure out how to cut the sugar a little I'd be happier.

I'm not a vegan... I fast from meat, eggs, dairy, and basically a whole lot of other foods very often from the year for religious reasons. That said, I was really looking for a recipe that gave me a break from eating pretty much only fruits, vegetables, and soy milk. This recipe was decent, but I probably would not have given it so high of a rating if I could have had regular brownies. They taste fine in the beginning but they have a dog-food smell and they have a terrible aftertaste. I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil, and cut the sugar by maybe a tablespoon or two. I also really pack in the cocoa because I like rich brownies (I do this with the regular brownies I make) so these brownies are rich, sweet, and moist.... But they just aren't that great.

These were great as the recipe is.  If there is anyway to cut the sugar, I would love to know, though :)  2 cups is alot of sugar...but it is ok for an occasional treat :)  It was nice to be able to give my allergic child something he could have (he is allergic to dairy, eggs and peanuts).

The first time I made these they came out pretty bad.  I think I overcooked them, plus I was living in high altitude.  Having recently made some changes to my diet, I tried these again as a treat and they were SCRUMPTIOUS!  First off, ditch the white sugar as it's bleached with animal bones and definitely not vegan-friendly.  Try raw sugar instead (you can buy this at any grocery store with the sugar).  Also, Mandy suggested using 1 1/2 cups of soy milk (or rice milk) with 1/2 cup of oil.  This is perfect.  I used some light vanilla soy milk and it mixed up beatiful.  I baked for about 1/2 hour, cooled and cut.  Yummy, cake-like brownies!

I just made these last night and brought them into work this morning.  I'm the only vegan in an office full of meat-eaters.  Everyone loves them and keeps going back for seconds!
Based on the reviews I read from other people, I substituted pure cane sugar for white sugar (white sugar is not vegan), applesauce for vegetable oil and soymilk for water.  I also used carob powder instead of cocoa powder and added semi-sweet choclate chips and chopped pecans.
They only need to be cooked 20 minutes, otherwise they get too cake-like.  They came out a little gooey, with no crumbling.  Will definately make again!!

EXCELLENT!  I've made these brownies twice before, and there's a batch in my oven again tonight - they're delicious!  I've also made a low-fat version substituting 1 cup of pureed prunes for the oil, and it turned-out great.  A definite keeper.

WOW!  I made these brownies for Easter for my sister because she currently can not have any dairy.  They were a huge hit, with the entire family.  I cooked them for about ten minutes longer and they came out perfect.

This recipe gives some direction to the baking, but we had to change some of the amounts of the needed ingredients.

There is too much oil in the recipe, and also the ratio between the sugar and flour was not correct;

Add an equal amount of sugar and flour (use the given amount of needed sugar).

Add much less oil into the mixture, about 2/3 of the given amount. 

You might also have to add some extra water, if needed. 

After all the changes, the brownie came out just great! It was moist and tasty. We also finalized ours with powdered sugar icing!

Yam!   

(After the needed changes the brownie deserves 4 to 5 stars!)

These were a hit but I cut the oil in half also. There's no need for that much oil because with half it was plenty moist.

These brownies are so yummy!  They are a little crumbly, but I don't mind because the flavor is exceptional!  It's also a bonus that they are so simple to make - no unusual ingredients and all in one bowl.  I have made them 3-4 times in the last month!

These tasted OK but they were INCREDIBLY greasy because of all the vegetable oil.  I cooked them for 10 minutes longer than the recipe specified and there was so much oil, the brownies kept bubbling.  I don't think I'd make them again.

i have this recipe baking in the oven as i write this ... i tried to find a simple recipe i could use with all purpose flour since i couldnt find all the special flours as it calls for the rocky road brownies in my "cooking free" book.. i am new to this egg and milk allergy and im 22!! but anyways i kept thinking " oh these r regular brownies and i cant have them and ur not allowed to taste it cuz no one should eat raw batter or dough cuz of the eggs" .. then i was like DUH it doesnt have any!! so i ate the batter off the whisk.. very good.. i cant wait for it to come out of the oven. it was a lil thick for me to stir but added more water and a lil more oil .. added dried cherries, marshmallows and chips and peanuts.. cant wait!! THANKS!!

I made these brownies twice.  I am not vegan but made them for someone who is.  So, I tried the original recipe and they were good, but very greasy and fell apart easily.  The second time I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce as others suggested and it was not as oily and they were much firmer. Overall, great recipe!!

This is a great recipe. I added walnuts to the recipe and used canola oil.  I also cooked it for alot longer than the recipe called for.  The brownies firmed up great.  Just keep you eye on them so they don't burn.  I also sprinkled the finished product with confectioners sugar.  These are great!!!  Definetely try them out!

I modified this recipe by substituting apple sauce for the oil. Ialso used half and half white and brown sugar (but I do this with many sweet baked goods). The flavor was rather good. The center never fully cooked, though. I don't mind that much because gooey brownies are yummy. For the next batch I'd like to try using carob powder or at least mixing some carob chips into the batter.

Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely divine!!  I made these for my brother and his girlfriend, who are vegan, as a birthday cake for my brother. Not only did they love them but everyone at the party did too!They all begged for the recipe and couldn't believe how easy and quick they were to bake!!  Very, very impressed!

My daughter's teacher is a vegan and I wanted to make a treat she could eat.  I've never made or eaten anything vegan before so I didn't know what to expect.  I substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c of the oil.  They are very moist and cakey - so much that I would put them in the fridge to store so they don't get moldy.  The taste was better the next day, but I agree with a previous reviewer about the "harsh" taste - it has kind of a sour aftertaste.  I also thought it was strange that this recipe used white flour and white sugar.  I'm sure many vegans would substitute some healthier alternatives?  Next time I may add some instant expresso powder to the water for a mocha brownie.

These are amazing! Seven months ago I had a baby boy-turns out he has a severe dairy allergy. I have given up all of the things I love, including brownies! That is until I found this recipe! I have made them for family and friends w/o telling them they are vegan and no one noticed! Sometimes I will subsitute 1/2 of the oil for Applesause or Earths Balance (dairy free) margarine. YUMMY!

The best vegan brownies i've made. I only had half cocoa powder in my cupboard, so halved the rest of the  mixture - but that was enough for a normal sized cake tin. lovely texture, just right -as it crumbles away and is gooey inside but not too soft. Next time i will add chocolate chips (as i am a chocoholic) probably some nuts too - it will be even more devine. Thankyou Sandy for sharing this!!

A girlfriend of mine made these today for my son who is allergic to dairy. She added chopped walnuts. They were so yummy and gooey! I usually find brownies to be so dry and end up baking them halfway. With these there are no eggs so its okay to eat them partially cooked. My son called it cake.

My 3 yr. old grandson is allergic to all dairy foods so I made these for his birthday, not knowing if he'd like them or not - he'd never had a brownie!  He loved them, we all loved them & this will be our "cake" for all birthdays from now on!!

Just made my first batch. I baked them for 25mins and they were the perfect gooey texture. The edges were lightly crunchy. I subbed a half cup of White sugar with stevia and a half cup with brown sugar. In the future I’d make them with 1/8th cup or 1/4th cup less sugar because they were almost too sweet but all around pretty happy with them!!

I was looking for a quick, vegan brownie recipe and found this. I had baked as a last minute treat for an event, but sadly they are too crumbly to present. 

First off, I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup, which was perfect. I do this as standard practice as I have baked too many cakes, especially online recipes, which were sickly and way too sweet. 

I bake a fair few vegan cakes, biscuits, scones etc and noticed on making, that this recipe seems to call for way too much oil in my opinion, but gave it a go none the less. I now feel I should have reduced the oil to 3/4 cup. The rise was not as expected, the bake was much too dense due to the oil and the brownies did not hold together as they should after cutting. They were way too greasy and way too crumbly.

The texture in the mouth is somewhat claggy, rather than moist, but the flavour is spot on. They won't go to waste, we will eat them with custard or  vegan ice cream, but in all honesty, this recipe needs tweaking!

I will either try again with less oil, or find another recipe.

Have made dozens of times, both as posted and with some of the suggested subs (e.g. applesauce swap).  Give to many omnivores, complete win.

I use chocolate chips (vegan) or other additions (Oreos, for example) to make them special.  

Note: my primary cooking audience IS NOT vegan.  I am, but not the neighbors, friends, etc. that receive.

They gobble them up.

Great go-to.

These brownies are underrated! They were super easy to whip up and hands down the best brownies my family has ever tasted! 

PS they took about 10 minutes longer to bake in my oven than recipe instructed time, yet still super moist and gooey on the inside

I've made it 3 times and it is very good. A little soft, but the sweetness and richness make up for it. I made it with chocolate chips too, and that is good.

I cannot tell you how many times I've made these brownies. They are  awesome!!  Even my non-vegan friends love them. Sometimes I make vegan buttercream frosting and too them off. You can add colored sugar or powdered cocoa powder to sprinkle on top  Yum!!!!

The consistency was nice, but the brownies were mild in chocolate flavor. Too mild for my taste. If you like fudgy brownies I'd suggest adding more cocoa powder.

This is my go-to recipe if I feel for a brownie that has no eggs or butter in it. It's delicious and hardly lasts a day at our house. It was a staple food while I was pregnant with my little one, as I struggled to digest animal products. That was over 2 years ago and I still pull it out at least once every 2-3 months.

They are tasty. Very dense, rich and heavy. Didn't change anything. Mine were a bit under done and needed more time, my fault. Would love these with ice cream and maybe some berries or as a mix in for a shake. Yummy!

I've made this 4 times in the last 2 weeks and I appreciate how it's all pantry staples.  The only changes I've made is I put a layer of vegan chocolate chips in the batter when I spread it in the pan and I sprinkle a little rainbow nonpareils on top.  It is a solid, consistent recipe!

Best brownies I've ever made, the only thing I changed was using almond milk in place of the water! Over all great recipe, and even better that it's vegan! I made theses for my non-vegan friends and they loved them, they were really shocked that they were animal product free!

okay so i will say the liquid measures are definitely off... i have a feeling they forgot to add milk or maybe just not enough water. it wouldnt even mix, it was like clay. but i added an extra 3/4 cups of water and the batter was so yummy! the cook time is also off, its been in for about 40 minutes and the center still isnt cooked. besides that, the batter is delicious and i cant wait until it comes out!

Just eh. Made two batches; one as written and the other with applesauce subbed in for 1/2 of the oil. Rather flavorless and had a weird texture. I'll keep looking if i need something vegan in the future.

These were really great! I was going to a party that was all vegan food and i had never made anything that was vegan so i was really nervous that it wouldn’t turn out well, but it did! I used brown sugar instead of white because I didn’t have any vegan white sugar! I will definitely make these again! My only two concerns were they were a little dry and very lumpy on the top other than that they were amazing!

These turned out great. I made them as the recipe says, but i added chocolate chips and walnuts.  I also followed one reviewers advice and mixed the flour with water before adding the oil, so the gluten forms er whatever. 
Doing that though made it harder to mix and i was totally convinced half way through baking that it ruined the texture, but that wasn't the case! They are very gooey and moist, and hold together pretty good...for not having egg.

When I made these brownies, I replaced the oil with margarine. The only problem I had was that 1 cup of water was not enough liquid !! i had to add 2 cups of water to allow the mixture to be stirred. Other than that they tasted amazing and would definitely do them again :)

This recipe is FANTASTIC! These brownies are delicious and cheaper because NO EGGS! The taste is chocolatey, fudgy and decadent. Unless you mention it no one will know these are vegan. The taste is the same as non vegan brownies. To make them more cakey you would need to add a “little” more flour. A LITTLE (a couple of tablespoons maybe). To cook longer may be to overcook them but it’s your choice. Either way the taste is amazing. Highly recommend this recipe.

Great taste to these brownies, but they need wayyyy more bake time. They were brownie soup. They also had a crusty top which was interesting, not bad though

I read the reviews and used some apple sauce in place of the oil.  I also put a little PAM in the pan.  I feel bad because I am not sure my sugar was up to VEGAN par but I was not prepared to learn that not all white sugar is considered VEGAN.  Everyone at the party, including the lone vegan, liked them.  I am not vegan and so they were good but not sinful enough.

Great Vegan brownie recipe with minor adjustments...as per other reviews I too only used 1/2 cup of oil and 1-1/2 cups of water...and I had to omit vanilla because I was out. They are in between chewy and cake brownies which is great! I have tried many vegan brownie recipes and all were a gooey mess stuck to the pan but NOT this time!!! Thanks

I accidentally forgot to put in the cup of water and got very confused that the recipe would call for so little liquid, so I ended up using half a can of coconut milk instead to make it typical brownie consistency. The brownies were baked by the time I realised I needed water. They had to bake longer because of the mix up but they taste great with coconut milk substituted for water. Used the leftover milk in the can to make an icing with icing sugar and cocoa powder.

I had my non-vegan Portuguese dessert loving mom try this (and mind you, Portuguese people love their desserts to have eggs and milk in them. It's like a staple. If you're Portuguese, a dessert needs to have animal products in hem, it's essential) and she gave the recipe a 5/5 stars.  She said the texture and taste of the dessert was really good, and that for a vegan brownie, it didn't taste bad at all. But she also said it lacked moisture, but still tasted good.

So easy & very basic ingredients to be able to whip them up on a whim.  So yummy too! The texture is between a cake & chewy brownie.

TIP: use powdered PB in place of the cocoa/cacao for vegan peanut butter blondies mmm

Made these tonight and there is a weird after taste. It may be because of the egg replacer  I used.   I'm not vegan, so I don't know what is supposed to taste like.  They were ok. I was trying them for a friend who is vegan.

I made a half size version of this recipe and I'm glad I didn't do the 9x13 pan. What a horrible, oily mess. I followed one viewers suggestion of mixing the flour and water (I used brewed coffee instead of water) to avoid a too crumbly brownie. I also used vegetable shortening instead of oil because that same poster said they were oily otherwise. I'm here to tell you that they are extremely oily even using shortening. I also found they lacked good chocolate flavor even though I used Valrhona cocoa powder. In total, it was a huge waste of very good cocoa powder.

Forget adding non-vegan stuff to this, I'm adding some homemade vegan cannabutter in place of oil and cooking it at 300 for longer. I can't wait to make these lol I will probably also add some applesauce as well just so that they're extra moist and maybe some chocolate chips too. Thanks for uploading!

Made per directions and they came out delicious! Made 6 batches for college marching band...devoured, with many surprised the brownies were vegan. More cake-like than fudge-like, in case you have a presence. Will make these from now on - edible to almost all with food sensitivities.

I just made these for my vegan daughter. I followed the recipe modifications suggested by CertifiedMoxie to mix the flour and liquid together first. I used half coffee and half vanilla soy milk for the liquid. Mixing that with the flour first was difficult and resulted in a sort of paste that was difficult to mix into the rest of the ingredients. I also added some applesauce. The flavor is decent, certainly not the best brownie of my life. But still SUPER crumbly and unable to cut into squares and eat with your hands. Probably won’t make them again. I need to find a better recipe.

I used turbinado and brown sugar instead of white. Overall very good! It is more of a cake like consistency versus fudge. I prefer fudge brownies but my family liked these. I will make again and maybe add some chocolate chips or nuts

I followed others' suggestions of reducing oil to 1/4 c and adding 3/4 c applesauce. I also reduced vanilla slightly and added a scant 1/4t of mint extract - mint brownies are delicious.

So, I followed the directions and the brownies themselves have a very mushy consistency and was very oily. With that said, I happened to have leftover batter that I set aside in a tupperware in the fridge. It ended up making a great vegan fudge. It wasn't intended at all, but I'd recommend refrigeration and trying that.

Super fast & easy to make. I cut down the oil to only 1/4 cup + added 1/2 cup almonds slices in the batter and got lot's of good reviews. Next time, I'd definitely toast the almond slices first for better taste and texture.

I made it exactly the same but with 1/2  of the flour wheat, and the sugar cane... I just wanted something quick with chocolate in it. ....and i loaded it with walnuts. It worked! Idk if i'd make it again as there was allot of fat and it was plain but chocolately nonetheless. Enjoyed reading the other reviews.

Wonderful recipe! I’m an executive Pastry chef and have had a great deal of vegan brownies! This is by far the best one I have come across. I doubled the recipe and baked the brownies in a half sheet pan for 35 minutes and they were perfect!

I just made these exactly according to the recipe. I use Dutch-processed cocoa powder and the taste was great, and mine weren't terribly oily, though they took about 30-35 minutes to cook as opposed to 25-30. But though the flavor was nice, mine were really crumbly and didn't hold. Someone recommended mixing the flour and water together first and letting that stand to form the gluten, so I'm gonna give these another go by doing that. I've also read around that applesauce or bananas can make good substitutes for eggs, so I might try that, too. Aside from the crumbling, though, these were pretty good!

As the brownies were cooking I stopped by to read reviews and many people said theirs were too raw after the 25 minute cooking time so I thought I would leave mine for 5 more minutes which was a mistake.  It came out little bit crumbly.
I would cut the sugar in half, oil by 33% and probably the cocoa powder too around 33%.  

I will definitely try this again with those reductions with added fluid, flour and nuts.

Nothing wrong with the original recipe but it is extremely sweet for me as an European vegan.

I made it for a pampered chef party. Everyone raved about them and they made copies of the recipe that I brought with me. It was delicious! Will defiantly make them again!

Loved these and will definitely be making them again. Stayed moist and chewy days after I initially made them. 

When I made them I tweaked the following: 
- Used raw sugar instead
- Doubled the vanilla extract
- Added 2 tbsp of maple syrup
- Instead of a cup of oil I substituted 3/4 for unsweetened apple sauce and the remaining 1/4 for oil

I'm currently trying to go vegan and I had a party to go to, so I brought these for myself and some vegan friends. They tasted like brownies to me, so I'm not sure what others are complaining about, but give them enough time to cool properly or they'll become very crumbly.

I made the recipe exactly as posted except I added about a half a bag of vegan chocolate chips that had just been hanging around in the pantry for a while. These brownies were delicious. My omni family loved them and my stepdad who is notorious for making fun of the things I cook even said that they were perfect. Everyone was shocked that they were vegan! 
The next time I make these, I might try out some of the suggestions about cutting the oil a bit because, although they tasted delicious, I did find them to be a bit too oily. Other than that, though, these brownies were heavenly.

The taste is great, but IT WON'T SIT. I baked it for more than it was set to, still a liquid in the middle. Then I thought I would wait over night to sit, but It's still liquid. I think it may have to do with all the oil...

This is a great recipe. I'm a university student and this is the first time I've ever baked anything myself. I'm so proud.  Great brownies, light and most importantly the recipe is adjustable to preferences and different ingredient portions.

I took the advice of user candle65t by changing the order of the ingredients. I mixed the water, oil and vanilla together in a bowl first. 
I combined the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Then gradually added the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and I found the consistency to be as thick as other brownie recipes. 
I don’t like cake-like brownies so I didn’t replace any of the ingredients and I used the exact  amounts in the original recipe. 
The only change was the size of the pan. I lined a square 8” x8 “ non stick brownie pan with aluminum foil instead of using a 9” x 13” pan. Not sure if that made a difference but I baked them on middle rack for 35 min at 350 and they were perfect. 
I let them sit overnight on counter. I waited until the following day to cut them.  Not crumbly, not oily. The top had the same cracking as brownies using butter, but the middle was moist, gooey and chocolatey, the pieces did not fall apart when I cut them.  Everyone loved them, we had no leftovers. Would definitely make these again. Thank you for a super recipe!

These were pretty good, perfect in a pinch when you're out of milk and eggs! I do wish they were a little more chocolatey, but that's easily remedied by adding a handful of chocolate chips or making chocolate icing. 

They are a little crumbly as some other reviews say, but if you do let them sit the recommended time or even longer, I don't think it's that big of an issue. Just make sure you have a plate handy ;)

This was really really good - although NOT by any means a traditional brownie because of the moisture content.  Unfortunately I didn’t read the reviews far enough to see the recommendation of substituting applesauce for most of the oil - I would have done so.  I cooked it for 15 to 20 minutes beyond what is called for, just to try to get it to firm up.  It remained pretty gooey - but still awesome - just had to be eaten with a fork rather than by hand.  I will make it again with applesauce and see how it does!  Flavor is outstanding, though!

We are not vegans, but this was a hit in our house. I made two slight substitutions on others' recommendations (shortening instead of oil, soy milk in place of water), and the consistency was much better. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the vanilla. It needed 35 minutes of baking time for the knife to come out clean. Do let it sit for a bit after baking, as recommended, to avoid crumbling.

These vegan brownies are really good.  Made them as suggested by CertifiedMoxie.  I used coffee, raw sugar and added cacao chips.  I baked it a little longer about 35 mins so that It wouldn't be too chewy.  It came out perfectly.  So glad to finally have a chocolate treat that doesn't require a lot of unusual ingredients.  It is a keeper.

This is a great recipe. I used it as my foundation 3 or 4 times now. To make it my own, I oven roast walnuts for about 10 mins and add them in along with Enjoy Life's chocolate chips. Also, instead of 1 full cup of oil, I use only 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 unsweetened applesauce. They taste better than "regular" brownies to me.

I made this for my niece and her family who are vegan. I made the recipe as written.  The brownies were loved by all including those who had no idea the brownies were vegan.

These were pretty good, not super sweet, but I'm a new vegan so it might just take some adjusting. I substituted applesauce for the oil and added PB2 (about 1/4 cup) and a splash of almond milk. Baked for 35 mins, and they came out nice and dense and gooey,  the way I like brownies. Maybe it was the applesauce? But mine weren't crumbly at all.

I loved this recipe.  I added some morenga powder and used coconut oil. My kids could not believe that they were healthy vegan brownies.  I'm definitely doing these brownies for my kids again.

I substituted the oil with coconut cream, and they were by far the best brownies I've ever made. Couldn't even tell they were vegan, and the coconut cream was very subtle and not overpowering.

Used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce. Next time I'll use an egg replacement, as it was a little crumbly. The taste was great and it had a nice brownie crunchy outer "shell".

Made these as written. The batter looked and tasted like normal brownie batter. I was so excited for these! I baked for 10 minutes and it started to smell like it was on the verge of burning so I took them out. The top looked set and didn't look glossy at all. The outside pieces are barely cooked through and the middle is the texture of silly putty. I deem only half of the batch edible.

I made these for a friend and have no more ingredients to make a different recipe. (Good cocoa powder is hard to come by in Korea.) I'm so embarrassed, but I can't come empty-handed so I'm going to call it brownie fudge. Thank god there's no raw eggs in it.

I also didn't follow the recipe. I thought it would be a lot of oil AND a lot of sugar so I just used a 1/2 cup of vegan margarine and only a cup of sugar. Then I didn't use any water at all, but instead used about a cup and a 1/2 of almond milk (I eye-balled it so this is just an estimate) and lastly I used a bit more vanilla extract. The batter was super thick gooey and just came sliding straight from the mixing bowl. I did cook them for an additional 15 minutes because I wanted them to be chewy and they are!! So chocolatey and soft in the middle but chewy on the top bottom and sides. PERFECT!! AND they're not that sweet. More like dark chocolate brownies with that slight bitter zing. OH! And I did dash cayenne pepper in at the end because... #delicious. Just enough to tickle the back of your throat.

I made these but altered the recipe by using 1/2 cup apple sauce to replace half of the oil.  I also added vegan chocolate chips.  I served these at a picnic and no one knew they were vegan. Everyone loved them especially me!

I  love to bake! Our family recently transitioned over to a vegan diet and it has been a terrific experience thus far! I needed something sweet to make for dessert and came across this recipe and decided to give it a go. I followed this recipe exactly as shown. I baked them for 30 mins which was perfect. They are a bit oily but not to a point were I had oil dripping off the brownie or a baking pan full of oil under the brownies. They were super soft and I did get gooey effect . They aren't as chocolaty as a fudge brownie would be but you can easily fix that by adding dark chocolate chips which I attend on doing next time I make these. All in all I would make these again!

It was OK. More cake-like than brownie-like and leaving me with a feeling of lacking. But, it'll work for now.

I found this recipe because my little sister went vegan and we needed treats she could eat. I love this one because it tastes just as good as non-vegan brownies and doesn't have any weird ingredients or common allergens (I can't count how many vegan recipes I've had to abandon because of almond milk or walnuts). I generally add a bit of extra chocolate powder and some chocolate chips because my family can't get enough chocolate, but the recipe is delicious either way

Absolutely delicious! This recipe is good as is and also adaptable. I've halved it, made it with coconut oil, reduced the sugar, and made it with peanut butter swirled on top.

Replaced oil with 1 cup applesauce. I will try almond milk instead of water next time as other have suggested. Used mini muffins tins and cooked for 15 minutes. Turned out very good! The applesauce gives it the extra flavor it needs.

These vegan brownies are excellent! Even if you aren't a Vegan . My  family love them!  I only use coconut oil and bake them a little longer . I add 1/4 of vegan chocolate chips  and 1/4 cup of walnuts  to the batter .

I have made this many times and followed the recipe, however today I decided to add chopped nuts, dried cranberries and 2T of instant coffee.  Amazing.  I also followed another raters advice and used coconut milk rather than water.  They need about 10 extra minutes but otherwise fantastic.

I've been making Vegan recipes for 12 years,  since my  4 year old was diagnosed with a dairy allergy. I have many go-to recipes,  but am always looking for more. Sadly,  this was more like a  cake than a brownie recipe. In fact,  it wasn't like a brownie at all. And as far as cakes go,  it was just okay. I was really craving brownies tonight,  so I'm sadly disappointed. I won't be making these again.

I love this recipe! Super easy to make and still turns out well if you make substitutions. I used melted vegan butter instead of vegetable oil and half brown sugar half white sugar because I ran out of white sugar! The brownies came out almost exactly the same (just a little chewier, which I prefer) and they were all gone within 24 hours. I recommend heating them up and then topping with a tablespoon or so of orange juice... so decadent!

First time making vegan brownies.  Followed @Certifiedmoxie's tips and added espresso, used almond milk, and vegetable shortening.  I substituted white sugar with turbinado sugar.  Had to add 10 more minutes to the baking time.  Turned out great!  Will definitely make again!

Too oily. Too much sugar. But overall, a good simple recipe.
I added mint schnapps to half of it and made two batches in smaller pans. They turned out nicely.
Problem: adding schnapps made it too wet, so I should have subtracted two tbs of water.
Also, oil should be 4/5 of a cup, not a full cup.
I used mostly safflower oil and a little sunflower oil (for flavor). These were a good decision. So was the mint!
Cheers!

This rating is great!  Nice cakey brownies.

Cause I switched to a lower carb, Raw Till 4 diet, I switched from flour, more to black beans, as the main ingredient.

No Guilt, Healthy Black Bean Brownies  made in the food processor with no bowl required! Bake and slice into the most decadent, rich and fudge brownies

Lowfat, No sugar, Lower carb, High protein, Vegan.
Just 5 ingredients!

This was delicious. I substituted bleached flour for unbleached flour. I also used Splenda mixed with sugar. The brownies came out soft and gooey, just the way I like my brownies. I think next time I make this, I'll try substituting coffee instead of water.

Such a yummy gooey brownie. Made it for my friends (teens) and none of them could believe it was vegan! I do suggest adding significantly less oil than the recipe suggests, and it does crumble a bit so I suggest mixing the water and flower first.

I was out of eggs and wanted brownies. This recipe helped to satisfy my chocolate craving. I used butter instead of oil and it worked out well. They taste really good.

Loved the brownies!  I too modified the recipe a bit.  A mixed all the dry ingredients in together and used 1 cup of Kirkland Organic Coconut Oil instead of the vegetable oil as it solid.  I cut the coconut oil into the dry ingredients  until well blended.  Then, I added the liquid ingredients. I also added an addition tsp. of almond extract and 1 tablespoon of expresso.
I have made this recipe  two times.  The first time I used a mini-muffin pan with  baking cups.  The second time, I used the 9"X13" pan.  Both times I cooked about 10-15 minutes longer than indicated.  I prefer the mini-muffin pan as the brownies were less crumbly.

These are sooo good!   I just recently found out that I have to be egg and dairy free for the rest of my life.  This was something I could make for the whole family and not feel like I was missing out.   Bonus is they loved them and didn't notice they were different.   I would bake them a little longer next time as they ended up gooey in the middle.   But that didn't stop any of us.  

The batter is not like normal brownie batter.  I'm actually going to make the batter, ball it up, and freeze it for brownie dough bites.  This will work for me as I can't make a whole pan of brownies every time my sweet tooth hits.  My kids are moved out.  The batter is nice and thick for this.

Delicious! There was definitely too much liquid though, which resulted in far longer cooking time and the brownies did not hold together well. Problem solved by using a fork :)

Eating these felt like eating piping hot brownie batter with crispy edges. I was craving brownies like mad and I didn't have any eggs, so I searched for a vegan recipe. I don't think I will eat anymore of these now that my craving has been satisfied. They're just too oily and gooey to eat more than one of. It made me feel kind of gross after eating them for awhile,. They were difficult to swallow. I needed a lot of milk to wash it down and get the oil coating off my tongue afterwards.

This recipe was overall pretty good.  I read the reviews after I put them in the oven, I pulled the brownies after 20 minutes and patted the oil of the top.  It seemed to aid the oil problem, but If i were to do it again I would cut the oil and maybe add apple sauce.

I made this recipe after reading and combining two separate reviews. First, I kept this recipe strictly vegan. (Thanks CertifiedMoxie). Like others, my main concern with this recipe was the oil content. Many reviews stated the oil was way out of proportion. 

I used user review from "Amanda" recommendation to do 1/4 c. oil with 3/4 c. apple sauce in place of the 1 c. oil in the original recipe. Also, I took two recommendations from user reviews CertifiedMoxie, and added the water FIRST to the dry ingredients, before adding the applesauce, oil, and vanilla mixture. She also recommended adding Cayenne pepper, and I added about 1 tsp. 

My own adaptation to this, in addition to the adjustments above, was to  add Enjoy Life Brand Mega Chocolate chunks. I also cut the sugar in half, used only 1 cup. Also, on the Cocoa powder, I did a 50/50 split and used regular unsweetened and mixed with special dark. 

The brownie batter consistency was perfect! They are currently baking, and looked great. Here is the modified recipe for those who are curious: 

2 c. Flour 
1 c. Raw Organic Sugar 
3/4 Cocoa Powder (Unsweetened regular, Special dark, or a 50/50 blend of both)
1 c. Water 
1/4 c. vegetable oil
3/4 c. Unsweetened Natural Applesauce
1 Tsp. Baking Powder
1 Tsp. Salt 
1 Tsp. Cayenne Pepper 
1 Tsp. Vanilla 
2 c. Enjoy Life Brand "Mega Chocolate Chunks" 

Preheat oven to 350. Whisk together dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, mix applesauce, oil, and vanilla, set aside. 

Add 1 c. water

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because the texture wasn't exactly like the non-vegan brownies I grew up eating.  The texture wasn't bad though.  It was a chewy, fudgy consistency.   I think I could have baked mine a little longer.  The flavor was spot on.  Very tasty!!!!

I am not vegan, but made these because I didn't have eggs, but had all of the ingredients for these.  I usually use applesauce instead of oil, but was out, so I used 1 cup pureed drained navy beans as a substitute.  They turned out great, super moist & chewy with absolutely NO bean flavor at all!  My new favorite brownie recipe!

It was really good actually, but when i went to cut it, it all fell to pieces and is a crumbly mess. i'm really upset because it's a great dessert and i'm vegan and couldn't wait, but was upset it was so crumbly. Maybe next time!!!

This was fantastic. I cannot get enough. I did make changes... only because I didn't want that big amount of oil. I also cooked it for a bit longer than the recommended time. 

Changes made: 
-oil to 1/4 cup. 
-3/4 cup applesauce.
-45 minute cooking time.

I also added a thickish vegan chocolate frosting on top with rainbow spinkles. Yay! For sure would make it again.

This recipe was amazing for the little amount of ingredients it requires.  I used coffee in place of the water and worked it into the flour first to build the gluten as there's no eggs.  I served them hot with a coffee glaze. These would be excellent with a candied nut. They are gooey and full of flavor,  we also used dark cocoa powder and I used half brown sugar.

I've made this a few times.  I adapted a few things.   Used brown sugar instead of white.  Use non gluten flour.  Melted butter instead of oil.  I also pour a tin of crushed pineapple into the bottom of the pan, cover it evenly with Chia seeds (1/3-1/2 cup) a solid layer not a thick one.  Then carefully pour the mix over top trying not to move the Chia seeds and pineapple around.  Don't worry if you don't get all the way to the edge and even, it sorts itself put in the oven.  Also, it takes a little longer to bake but, oh so yummy!

My 10 year old son made these all by himself. I made only one change to this recipe - I dumped in two cups of pecans and walnuts and increased the salt added slightly.  T'was phenomenal for what my son made.

I thought this turned out really good, my vegan friends were impressed. I made it using pure cane sugar, not white as it is 1) Better and 2) Doesn't have the potential to have bone char.

These brownies rock! They really are gooey, chocolatey and delicious. Not too sweet, just dark, rich chocolate.  I subbed gluten free flour (1.5 c brown rice flour + 1/3 c potato starch + 1/3 cup tapioca starch) so, I added 1/2 cup more water. My goodness how decadent they are. Make these even if you don't need a vegan recipe. They are that good.

I made this using vegan ingredients. I cut the recipe in half and used half vegetable oil and half shortening rather than all vegetable oil and i used vegan sugar and brown sugar. over all they were very "gooey" (it was like peanut butter) and its better  the next day. It doesn't completely fall apart but it doesn't hold together which i expect seeing asthere is no binding agent (egg) ... you'll definately need a glass of milk

Delicious!! I had a vegan coworker and I wanted to make a dessert that I knew she could eat, so I came looking hear. This was the first one I tried and it was great. Some of the reviews mentioned that white sugar may not actually be vegan and suggested raw sugar, so I used that

I was wrong!!! These are delish, I originally thought, by sight, they were cake like. After cutting they are cake like, but fudgey inside. I did alter. I added vegan chocolate chunks,  omgoodness delicious going to alter further, instead of cup of water I'm going to use 1/2 c cooled coffee. Too much water in this recipe. Again very good, but I am a brownie lover, these are good, but cake like...

The family loved them. Not overly sweet, and had a solid flavor. Next time I will try replacing some of the water with cold coffee to give it an extra kick. This is a great starter to build on.

when i first made these brownies, they were good, but not anything special. following the recipe, they come out a little dry and definitely on the cakey-er side. I made them a second time and subbed the water for almond milk (with the same measurements) and holy moly, they're incredible. I recommend sprinkling pecans on top and adding a little extra salt. I recommend using coconut water instead of water.

This is a really good recipe! Instead of one cup of vegetable oil. I used 2/3 cup of coconut oil. It gave the brownies really good flavor. Also, I used less sugar, but overall it turned out very good. The texture is also very VERY nice. This is a good brownie, and I will make it again soon!!!

Delicious!!! But not what I would call a brownie, which is why I gave it a 4. It's more like a cake than a brownie.
I made a few substitutions that I think keep the recipe vegan: I used Special Dark cocoa powder, instead of 1 cup of oil, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup natural applesauce.
I love this recipe and it was a hit with my coworkers!

I am a vegan and so is my family. I love veganism and how it makes me feel. I also loved baking and baked goods.!  Sometimes it takes a try or two to get the recipe where you like it to be. This recipe is awesome!  I do lower the amount of sugar  by a bit and oil.  Other than that, it's delicious and tastes like a fudgy brownie. You don't have to frost it or dust it with powdered sugar!  They go fast!  I love it

Because they don't rise very well the center is always supa goopy and to avoid that I: bake it 10-15 mins then I cut out what would be the center piece place it back in the over for the rest of the time it needs to bake. When it's done its perfect.

I really wanted to love these.  They were just ok.  Mine were not gooey at all.  More dry and fluffy.  I did use Splenda instead of sugar.  Could that be why?  Also based on taste could have used a pinch of salt to bring out the flave more.

These tasted pretty good, but lost a star because of the baking time...  they defiantly took more than 30 minutes to even get to a brownie texture. I found they took about 40-50 To bake.

Based on other reviews, I did 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of the entire oil. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It came out really bland. Lacking the richness I'm used to from brownies. Maybe it needed more of that oil.

I've been a Vegan for about 2 months and I made these for the first time last night. I let them cool for about 10 mins and tried one. It was very rich and not as sweet because I did cut the sugar back a little bit. However, tried one today and they are delicious!! They are better the next day in my opinion!! Thanks for sharing!!

I substituted the 2 cups of sugar for 1 cup of baking stevia, substituted the vegetable oil for unsweetened almond milk, and made the recipe with whole wheat flour. I thought it turned out well! Even the next day the Brownies were soft and sweet.

I make this recipe whenever I get a strong chocolate craving. Which means I make it pretty often! The brownies are super gooey and moist. I sometimes add chocolate chips. Mmmm... brownies...

I do substitute the oil for refined coconut oil and I've also used unrefined coconut oil with great results. I also use additional cocoa powder  (oops, but not really! ) and they turn out amazing. Great recipe that I've been using for about a year now. I have added about 1/2 cup of flaked coconut and it gives it a cake like chocolate dessert too, but as you may have guessed, I love coconut...and chocolate.

these were good!  I lessened the oil  by 1/4 cups because I read someones review about too much oil. I also did half almond coconut milk and half water instead of 1 cup of water.  I added some coffee because I didn't have any vanilla. I will definitely make these again.  My go-to dessert recipe :) I can imagine putting chunks of this in some homemade vegan coffee icecream! #bless

Not bad! Next time I'm going to be using 1 1/2 flour and 1/2 cup more cocoa as well as cooking it for seven or so minutes less. All in all it's a great base recipe with lots of room for creativity!

I made these with earth balance instead of oil and cashew milk instead of water. Baked for 30 minutes and they were delicious. Vegan and non vegan guests loved them. I served with vanilla soy ice cream. So good!

Simple and very quick to make this easy gooey  brownie! The only thing I do different  here is add warm water and 1 tbsp of yogurt.  Other variations are adding walnuts/ chocolate chips/ coffee pwd.  Sinfully good every time with a dollop of ice cream!

Flavor was good but the rest were a mess. Texture was bad, too wet and felt unbaked even though they were baked. I wasn't trying these because they're vegan but because they're a healthier alternative. I'll keep looking but they might fit the bill for you.

I made this recipe with a couple changes....like someone else, I used Earth Balance instead of vegetable oil. Then instead of water I used 1/2 cup So Delicious  Vanilla Coconut milk  and 1/2 cup coffee. I also added a second teaspoon of Vanilla. They are really yummy....for me they were more cake like than chewy. Still delicious.

Instead of the 1 cup oil, I heated a banana in the microwave until mashable, then added enough oil to that to make 1 full cup...a slightly lower fat option. Baked for 34 minutes. Fantastic brownies. Will definitely make again and again!!!

I have made these brownies multiple times with varying results. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter- I thought the flavor was ok, but 25 minutes did not seem to be long enough to cook as they were VERY gooey in the middle. The second time I decided to cut the sugar in half (my effort to be healthier) but forgot to cut the cocoa, and then baked them for 28 minutes. They ended up quite dry and rather bland, but we'll chalk that up to human error. ;)

This last time has been the best result so far. I followed everything in the recipe except I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and cut the cocoa down just a bit as well. I've added chocolate chips each time, because why wouldn't you?! I like them much better than the first two times, but still not my favorite. I've had better brownies.

It's easier than the vegan recipes I've seen with flax eggs and other more complicated ingredients. I used this recipe as a guide but used half oat flour and half all-purpose, raw sugar (to keep it vegan), almond milk instead of water, vegan butter instead of oil, and added a tablespoon of strong coffee. The brownies are dark, chocolatey, and a bit chewy...totally satisfy a brownie craving, although if I had vegan chocolate chips I would've added those for even more flavor.

FABULOUS brownies! I was a little cautious about these brownies because they are vegan and I am not, however we didn't have any eggs so I decided to give them a try. They taste amazing and are very moist, even without the eggs! There is a lot of oil in the recipe, though. There was a lot of left over oil n he bottom of the pan that came out of the brownies.  Nevertheless, they were wonderful and I will be making hem again!

Absolutely amazing. Really pleased with how these turned out. Followed the recipe just as it says and they came out moist and dense. They weren't to gooey or too firm...  In the words of goldilocks they were just right. I made small individual brownies in my brownie pan and then sliced them in half to making Mr Kipling style slices. I cooked them for about half an hour on gas mark 2. 
Couldn't have worked out better!  Thank you for this amazingly simple and successful vegan recipe.

I made this when I first became a vegan and had a nasty craving for something sweet and stumbled across the recipe.

I have to say this is an absolute god send, very delicious warm and also once cooled - I'm the only vegan in my family and amongst my friends but everybody who tried them loved them and couldn't believe they were vegan!

I highly recommend making these (I've made them twice now) I will certainly make more in the future thank you for the recipe!

This is good, but too salty for my taste! Probably enough with only half a teaspoon. I used rice flour and had to double the amount of water because of it, and added a little extra cocoa for a richer taste. Mine ended up as a very moist chocolate cake, but it certainly satisfied the chocolate cravings.

These brownies were thebomb.com! I'm a newly vegan and I loved them! I modified the recipe a bit using almond milk and just a little water. Also I only had olive oil and used that instead of vegetable oil. They were so moist! Just don't make the same mistake I did. Make sure your layer is even. Lol

The middle did not cook at all. They taste okay but it's basically eating raw brownie batter. You might want to adjust the oil out, or maybe add more flour?

We used Crisco as well and they were AMAZING- and seriously I have been so frustrated by the texture and taste of vegan baking-it's like sadness in a pan, these are the real deal, none would even know they were vegan!

I have just become a vegan and was looking for some sweet treats for a get together with my friends! I've heard that vegan brownies aren't always that nice but made them anyway, and I can honestly say they are so nice! Many compliments and they wanted the recipe!  I would definitely recommend

So delicious.  I used the full oil amount the first time and they were extremely soft (but amazing).  The second time I used half the oil and they turned out really well.  Do NOT double the recipe to make them thicker... they still don't cook very well like that.  The third time I made them I did not use any oil, and froze them instead.  They are little fun frozen snacks instead!

For vegan brownies, I give this 5 stars. You'd never know they were vegan! Followed the recipe with no changes. Not oily at all. A little crumbly, but maybe should have baked a little longer than the recipe says. Overall, very good and I will be making these again. Stepson loved them and he is vegan.

I followed suggestions to replace 3/4 cup oil with Apple sauce. The brownies were more like cake than brownies. Not gooey at all and not very sweet. Meh.

These are amazing. I admit when I first tried it 
 Not to long after being out in the oven it tasted a like it needed more sugar. But as the day went on and even 2 days later I tasted them and they were great. I'm even making them to take to christmas

i was disappointed in these as i was making this as a test run for bf's daughter who is now vegan.. i really should have looked at run of the mill brownie recipes and gone from there.. this came out lacking that rich chocolaty flavor i'm accustomed to.. i didn't mind that this wasn't overly sweet.. but the run of the mill stuff calls for double the sugar, cocoa powder, and oil.. i followed Duckball's modification of quartering the oil and adding one cup of applesauce.. i also did half water half almond milk as Cherry Rae had done.. i now understand why CSmithRN04 gave her bad review.. the brownies are just bland.. bf says they're just less "punchy" brownies.. :( maybe a frosting would help? ~~small UPDATE: i topped these with Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting (from this site) and it totally saved the brownies

I did not make any changes, but I will probably not make them again because they were kind of heavy and crumbly. Also, they had a type of a dark flavor.

So i tried to make these, and I followed the recipe to a T, but the brownies stayed liquidy until they were burnt, and then it bubbled to a harden. I'm just starting to cook vegan and this was not a good experience for me or my husband at all.

I added 1/3 c of oil instead, since 1 c seemed excessive, added about a tablespoon of water  to the 1 c, and 1 1/3 c sugar. It was  a very good recipe though.

Simple, quick, and always a hit.  I like to use demerara sugar (a.k.a. turbinado) instead of white as I prefer the texture.  This time, I lined the pan with parchment paper.  It made cooling, cutting, and cleanup a breeze.

I made these in the hopes that I finally found the perfect vegan brownie, but unfortunately, it tasted more like cake than a true brownie. I'll keep searching.

Amazing vegan desert that my whole omni family loved! TIPS: I swapped vegetable oil for coconut oil/butter and it made it amazingly sweet (great for coconut lovers like me). I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I think this gave it a more rich/deep sweetness to it. I ate so much! Brilliant recipe!

I didn't have vegetable oil so I used olive oil instead.  I also subbed half the white sugar with brown sugar and everyone absolutely loved it!  Curious what a recipe with eggs and milk would've tasted, I tried another recipe the next day and actually preferred this recipe waaay more!  Soft and chewy, I also added vegan chocolate chips on top of the brownies.  With so many coworkers with dairy and egg allergies, I thought this was perfect!

I made this brownie recipe a few weeks ago and LOVED IT! I used gluten-free flour instead of white flour and used 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 coconut oil instead of doing a whole cup of oil, still turned out great! Myself and many others love this recipe BUT if you are looking for a brownie brownie, this is not the recipe to make. This is more of a CHOCOLATE CAKE/BROWNIE recipe! Nothing like the texture of a real brownie! Otherwise it's still worth making and is very enjoyable.

Way to much cocoa powder to begin with, but even with all of the sugar it did not help! Yes, they are absolutely gooey and soft which is great, but not good on the flavor.

They were absolutely yummy and very gooey so it made them fun to eat. But if you don't like them gooey just bake them a little longer and if you have them with vanilla ice cream they are over the top yummy.

I liked these brownies a lot! They were so yummy! I did add some vegan semi-sweet chocolate chips for an added chocolately-ness. Though one thing I would note is that these brownies are very oily so many next time I make these I will cut the amount of oil or use coconut oil because it is a little more forgiving. Over all, these were good brownies and I would make them again because they are so simple.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for I made them using a mini muffin pan. They turned out ok, not really sweet, but still edible. They don't seem too oily or crumbly but that may be just because they are so tiny. I only really made them because I was craving chocolate, but didn't have any eggs. Not wonderful, but not entierly bad either, may or may not make again.

These came out really good for me! The few changes I made; instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil, instead of a cup of water I used a cup of almond milk, and I added in about a half a cup of vegan chocolate chips. They were very gooey and delicious! Thanks!

I think this recipe is fantastic! I made it exactly as stated except I didnt have vegetable oil, only olive oil. I could taste the olive oil a bit, wouldn't recommend using it. However, these brownies were still very delicious! Next time I'll try less oil with applesauce and add some chocolate chips. Definitely worth making again and again!!

So I am not vegan, but I didn't want to use any eggs or diary today. I decided to also use my Oreos that were lying around my pantry, so I reduced the sugar to 1 3/4,  1 1/2 cups. I was a little unsure about putting the Oreos because it looked liked there wasn't enough batter, but it turned out pretty good. I suggest putting the Oreos on the bottom so that you will have enough on the top and there aren't any holes on the top. Anyway, when I tasted it, it was probably the best brownies I ever made! The cookies in the brownie were really gooey and delicious, and the brownie itself was great! I recommend this recipe to anyone, vegan or not -it's so simple, decadent, and amazing!

I added lots of chocolate chips to the batter and made up my own icing to go on top. My grandpa said they were the best brownies he's ever had! They were moist, very rich and gone within 24 hours.

Sorry to give a low review, and thank you for the post in any case,  but we tried theses (both my husband and I are brownie fans), and neither of us really want to eat the rest. (I made the recipe with no alterations).

Super love this recipe. I made it for a vegan friend and it never got to her. My good friend who's also a co-worker couldn't help himself...we ended up sharing it and eating it all. :D The brownies turned out very moist and tasty. I altered it a bit to make for red velvet brownies and it still turned out perfectly. It's great that you don't need to get anything fattening into the recipe to get great brownies like these. Major yum! Thanks for posting. :)

I made these last week and they were amazinggg and so easy to make!! My family said they were the best brownies they've ever tried, and were surprised when I told them I didn't use eggs or milk, they didn't believe me when I said that vegan food is actually delicious !! In Australia our sugar companies are vegan friendly and don't use bone-char:)) I also mixed in roasted peanuts for an extra kick:))

These were amazing! I made them because around Christmas last year I was doing a lot of baking, and bringing samples into my class at college, and a friend in my class was vegan, so i made them just for her, but everyone enjoyed them!

Made these for vegan friends, and they were great. They did not cut well, so I wouldn't want to make them for a baby shower or something, but they tasted good. I used a bit less oil and used 2 shots of espresso in place of some of the water. Also threw in some dark chocolate chips.

I'm not vegan but I have been getting into baking vegan food, and have been considering the decision to became one and I must say that this recipe is pretty simple and good! I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 1 cup of coffee instead of water, and it definitely tweaked it. It's great with a whipped vegan topping! Keep in mind, that it would be great with something topped on it, rather that be a whipped topping or fruit.

First vegan baking experience and was thrilled!  Did raw sugar as I learned white processed is not truly vegan.  Also subbed out 1/2 the oil for organic unsweeted applesauce and still think I could cut out more oil.  For those who mentioned crumbly texture:  mix the dry ingredients with water BEFORE the oil otherwise it won't combine well.  Added walnuts for a crunch and LOVED that.  Also baked about twice as long because 25 minutes were 100% uncooked except for outter edges.  Will definitely cook these again!

I swapped out gluten-free flour for flour, coconut palm sugar for white sugar, and half of the oil for melted coconut oil. My version was still on the oily side, but it baked off in the 30 minutes.

This recipe is AMAZING!  My kids have allergies to eggs and dairy so we are often stuck with boxed cookies/cake mixes that just do not taste that great.  When I came across this recipe I decided we had to try it.  All of these ingredients are typical pantry staples.  For a topping we have used organic powdered sugar once and then melted Enjoy Life chocolate drizzled over another time.

They were moist, chocolately, and so delicious.  My kids were thrilled with this new, delicious, quickly-made dessert.

I have to say, these are pretty good for vegan.  I used 1 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Also, substituted oil for 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 c. unsweet applesauce to make a little healthier.

Tasted great. Delicious, gooey, chocolatey, basically what every brownie should be. 
Texture was crumbly, and too soft. I had to bake my brownie for 75 minutes. 
Overall, flavor was great, but it was very oily and crumbly, and baking it was a drag.

Recently I became intolerant to dairy so finding recipes to help my sweet tooth that actually taste good has been hard but this one was one of the better ones. There are some changes I will make next time but they were very good for the most part I also added some peppermint extract (just that season) and they were delicious! Definitely something I will try again.

I used half a cup of olive oil and half a cup of coconut milk - worked great for me. I liked it.

They taste so good! Turned out really well - maybe just use 1/2 oil instead of a cup though :)

Of course, I used raw cane sugar as white sugar is not vegan, the cooking time and temperature will differ based on what pan and oven you use, and the batter was so thick, my mixer could barely handle it. But overall these brownies were very simple to make and tasted just as good as any non-vegan brownie mix. These are not gourmet fudgy brownies, but still satisfying.

These brownies were tasty, but pretty greasy and crumbly. For chocolate lovers out there I added some chocolate chips, and it really added some sweatness.

These are fantastic! I subbed olive oil for the vegetable oil and added about .25 cup of coffee, poured the batter into muffin wrappers, and had great cupcakes. Definitely a staple if you avoid animal products but like baking!

I love this recipe- thanks for posting. I add spices (like cinnamon), chocolate chips and coconut,use at least half of whole grain flour,and raw sugar (as if that would make it healthier, but one can try ;)). I think its great to remember roughly same amounts of flour, water, oil and a bit more sugar. I agree, that they crumble a bit, but I have no clue how to improve that.

Ok, on a positive note, the texture I really like. They are a bit crumbly while still being fudgy. On the bad side, they taste absolutely horrible. I am a chef, and I love to bake..I love to try new recipes and new things..these are just plain terrible.

I loved this recipe, my first time making it, and they were a huge hit! Everyone was actually surprised to find out that they were vegan, and it actually got most of whom had the brownies to try more vegan foods and recipes. Absolutely love this recipe, this is a must in my cookbook!

I really enjoyed this. I cooked it for 35 minutes so it's not as crumbly. I used Truvia baking sugar instead which is vegan, and cuts back the calories.

I ended up making this with about half the suggested amount of coco powder (I misjudged how much was in the packet) but they turned out great. Going to try it with brown sugar next time, seeing as white sugar isn't strictly vegetarian (some of the bleaching ingredients come from animal bone) but overall a fantastic and easy recipe. Great for vegans with not a lot if baking experience, also a great dairy-free chocolate fix!!

My son is allgergic to eggs, and brownies seem to be very difficult to make egg free.  This recipe is definitely a hit!  The brownies are very fudgy, very chocolately, and my son asked me to use this recipe for brownies all the time from now on.

I made this recipe gluten free as well, and used the batter to make brownie balls in my cake pop maker. Sooooo Good!  My modifications were to the flour, sugar , and oil. I used 1/2 cup coconut flour, 1/2 cup tapioca, 1/2 cup potato starch, 1/2  cup white rice flour. For the sugar I used golden sugar same measurements. And I used avocado oil for added omega goodness and less grease consistency. They cooked up in about 5 min in the cake pop maker. Gluten free and vegan and delicious!

I should've followed the advice of those who said to decrease the oil (way to much here). Even though I added 1/2 tsp instant coffee granules to enhance the chocolate flavor, it didn't have much flavor other than the cocoa powder and the taste of sugar. As personal preference, I would use more cocoa (maybe Dutched instead of natural) or melted dark chocolate and less sugar (2/3?). BTW I used ground raw sugar and these are cake-like fresh from the oven and more fudgy when cooled. I personally prefer fudgy brownies that are less sweet and more chocolately so I will not make this again.

This was a great recipe! I took tips from other reviews and used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup oil instead of all oil and they had a great texture, very cakey and delicious. Thank you!

I tried this recipe this weekend after reading ALL the reviews.  I was skeptical because there were so many differing opinions but I think they turned out VERY well for a vegan brownie (I'm not vegan but I made them for a friend).  I will point out, however, that they are very moist--the way that I like brownies.

I made a full recipe and modified as follows:  I used whole wheat flour. Instead of 2 cups of sugar I used 1 cup raw turbinado sugar and 1/2 cup honey.  Instead of the 1 cup oil I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  Instead of water I used 1 cup of strong black coffee.

I mixed the warm coffee with the sugar and vanilla and then added the cocoa, oil, honey and applesauce.  I mixed the flour, salt and baking powder together and then added the dry ingredients to the wet mixture. I stirred in one cup of vegan chocolate chips, too but they would be great without the chocolate chips.  

I used a brand new, non-stick 9x13 pan and baked at 350 (my oven might run a little cold because it's older) for about 35 minutes -- I set the timer for 25 and kept adding a few minutes until the brownies "looked dry on top" -- you'll be able to tell when they are done when the top isn't shiny any more.

I let them cool in the pan for over an hour and then cut and put into a Rubbermaid container in between pieces of wax paper last night to prevent sticking.  We ate a test brownie at lunch today and it was delicious!!

The reviewer who said these were the “worst brownies ever” must be on some sort of mind-altering substance, because these brownies are AMAZING. However, I recommend using less than ½ a cup of vegetable oil — 1 cup of vegetable oil is waaaay too much.

Im just going vegan, from vegetarian and these brownies are honestly the best! I used all supplies from the new organic section in stop and shop. If you think about most brownie mixes from a box have the same ingredients so, give these brownies a try. They are rich and perfect.

These brownies were absolutely delicious!! I followed the directions to the letter.  I did add about handful of vegan mini chocolate chips once my brownies were ready to pour into the pan.  Due to variances in ovens, I had to bake the brownies about 20 minutes longer than instructed.  As others have mentioned, they did crumble a little when I cut them, but I noticed that when I allowed them to cool a little more, they were fine and held their shape.  Overall, they were SO good and my boys and family LOVED them.  They are begging me to make them again soon!  Thanks for a vegan twist on brownies!!

I am a try junk foodie bake-a-holic and I thought these were absolutely delicious! My batter was a tiny bit grimy and thick so I added 1tsp of coconut milk and I really think it made all the difference!

Great recipe for Nick - no dairy, no eggs. We sprinkled some chocolate chips on top. These are dense but delicious.

I just found this recipe. I was looking for an eggless dessert recipe since I ran out of eggs. It turned out better than a thought. I replaced the flour for self-rising and cut the baking powder and salt. Also since we always try to make everything as healthy as possible, I replaced the oil for half applesauce half plain greek yogurt and added some almonds. They were delicious and my kids loved them. I didn't have any brown sugar but next time I'm going to try them with it insted of white or with another natural sweetener. Definitely doing this again!!!

These turned out great.  I mixed the flour n water first.  I used coconut oil and added coffee crystals.  Delicious and not greasy at all.

I made a couple small tweaks, and these turned out fantastic! I used just half the oil the original recipe called for, I added 1/4 tsp of almond extract, and a healthy squirt of chocolate syrup. That's probably not vegan, and I apologize to those who are offended by that change. I was making this recipe simply because I was out of milk and eggs and making do with what was in my cupboards. The batter/dough was incredibly thick and hard to work with (probably because of the lack of oil), but once I got it spread into the pan it turned out just fine. I would definitely make it again just as I did this time, it tasted great and had a pleasant texture.

I LOVED these brownies. They were delicious. A tip: add 1/2 a cup of vegan chocolate chips to the batter. They were great, but I would also suggest adding egg replacer or applesauce also, since they were quite crumbly. Don't forget to grease the pan!

This is a great recipe.  I cut the sugar in half and used raw sugar instead of white.  I also cut the oil down by 1/3 and instead used water to reach a proper consistency for baking.  I sprayed my baking dish with olive oil and poured half the batter, sprinkling vegan chocolate chips on the middle, followed by the rest of the batter with more chips on top.  This recipe needs approximately 15 more minutes of baking than indicated, but I used a toothpick in the center to gauge this.  Close to the end of cooking, I dropped dollops of unsalted natural peanut butter on top, swirled through with a knife, and continued baking for 10 minutes.  They are delicious!!

We adapted this recipe into a gluten free version using Bobs Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free Flour.  Added 1 tsp zanthum gum,  substituted full fat coconut milk for the water and left the rest of the recipe as is.  These turned out wonderfully!  Even better than our favourite brownie mix by Namaste!  Just as easy and much cheaper!  Thanks!

These were sensational! I would have given it a 5 if it wasn't too crumbly. I made a few changes though, used brown sugar instead of white and decreased the flour by 1/2 cup and substituted the 1/2 cup with unsweetened coconut flakes. They weren't oily and tasted just perfect.  Will definitely make these again!!

These brownies were soft and delicious!! I could not get enough. The only negative is that the bake time took a lot longer than 30 minutes. I baked for a little over an hour. These were so great, though.

I really wanted brownies, but didn't have eggs...so tried this recipe out. I usually make brownies from a recipe on the Hershey's website, so that's what I'll use to compare. I prefer a more cake like brownie for starters, which I get from Hershey's. This recipe was close though. I was leary of the oil...but followed the recipe exactly. I cooked them for about 8-10 min longer as suggested by the creator. They turned out very fudgy tasting with a more cake like texture. The texture was a little off because it wasnt staying together as well as I wanted it to. It was still moist enough and satisfied my sweet tooth. I'll keep this in the recipe box for the future....but just prefer my egg in there.  Keep in mind this review is from a non-vegan....so take it with a grain of salt ;)

Very good recipe...my kids LOVED it! A little crumbly, but the taste made up for that. I baked it for 27 minutes, and it definitely could have used about 5-10 minutes more. BUT, I know all ovens are different so next timeI will go about 35 minutes. Glad to have tried it...will be saving this recipe.

I used more baking powder since I am at a high altitude (colorado), and instead of using all the water I substituted wth coffee. Will definitely make these again.

These are amazing! I have made them many times now. I have made it using water and using almond milk for the liquid, both were great. I have also baked them in 8x8 pans and cooked them a little longer, but they were soo moist!

First I tried this recipe to the letter and they were super dry and gross. Then I tried it again with milk instead of water and 1/2 cup oil instead of one cup. I wound up making chocolate cake! A yummy cake, but not brownies  :-/

Just made these the other day and think they are quite good! I've not tried any other vegan brownie recipes, but imagine the results can run the gamut. I followed the recipe fairly closely and was happy with how they turned out. I only had about a half cup of white sugar left, so I added a cup of brown sugar, and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and ended up only having about 3/4 cup. Other than that I added about a tablespoon of molasses, and about a cup of vegan chocolate chips. I baked them for 25 mins and checked them...they were still a little shiny so did 30 mins total and after cooling they were a little cakier around the sides and chewy in the middle. Will definitely be making these again and trying some of the modifications mentioned by other reviewers!

My brownies turned out great! I only give it 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe after reading the reviews.  After reading that they were crumbly, I used the equivalent of 1/2 egg in egg replacer. For more flavor, I added 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and topped it with 1/2 cup of walnuts before putting in the oven.
They are fudgey, sweet, and a little spicey.  Wowza!! So good!

Great taste and always reliable! I don't like how it uses so much oil, but I just substitute half the oil for applesauce and it turns out great. I prefer to cook it longer than recommended, and it's a bit too crumby sometimes. Overall, though, it has a great strong chocolate flavor, and I love to make it! Another tip: sometimes this recipe tastes better as leftovers.

These were so yummy! I'm not vegan, just wanted an easy chocolate delivery system and had all the ingredients on hand. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I just used an 8x8 pan instead. It turned out more like a brownie ish cake than a cakie brownie. Not crumbly at all!

I made these tonight and they were great. I used all brown sugar instead of white, about a cup of dark chocolate nib chips, and some raw coconut on top. They were a bit crumbly, but delicious. You could eat as a piece, or even crumble over some coconut milk ice cream. I have no idea why some reviewers thought they were super oily. I usually make Ghiradelli brownies, and they are sooo greasy. I love them, but they are.These weren't,in my opinion, greasy at all. My Sis in law has a severe dairy allergy, and can never enjoy chocolate desserts. I can't wait to bring these to her tomorrow.I'd make them again, and I'm not even vegan.

They smell great, but came out moist yet super dry. I felt like I was chocking.

These were . . . Ok. I made them for a bake sale and when I tried to take them out of the pan, even after greasing it, they stuck and most crumbled to pieces :( But the taste was GREAT! They tasted like regular brownies.

Taste the mixture before you bake it!!!
My first batch were horrible, but the second were amazing. You might have to adjust the recipe. I used coconut oil (instead of vegetable), Cadbury coco, dark chocolate chips, and ground hazelnuts for the top.
If you can substitute nice ingredients, do it. You'll get much better results.

I'm an alright cook and I've made this recipe a few times and each time they turned out very well. I would not cook for anymore than 25 minutes and use maybe 3/4 cup vegetable oil instead of a full cup otherwise they're a little bit oily. I definitively recommend this recipe!

This was the first vegan recipe I've ever made. It was a decent introduction but I found that these came out a bit too crumbly. I think next time I will just use a milk and egg substitute to try and get them to hold together. Personally added walnuts in my version. Would have rated better if they came out gooey instead since that's just my personal preference.

Just tried this recipe after a failed attempt at veganizing my family's brownie recipe. This was so easy, required only standard baking ingredients that I had in the house, no awkward egg replacement, super quick  to prepare, and turned out perfectly! Perfect consistency and great flavour. Would be great with a vegan glaze or frosting.

Very good. I made a few small changes. I used raw sugar and subed the oil with 1/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup vegan sour cream. They turned out great. I'll make them again.

Darlings, These were boring cake-y brownies.  Not gooey at all. Not chocolate-y even though I added chips.  Espresso powder would really be necessary.  Read the reviews and did all the suggestions.  I am a registered dietitian so I know how the chemistry of the suggestions work. Am still looking for the FAB no cholesterol, no oil brownie.

I adore these brownies! These are great even for the non-vegan (aka my body builder boyfriend). I add vegan chocolate chips and use pumpkin puree instead of the oil.

This is my first egg free / milk free (vegan) Brownies, and they are good, but they seemed dry as compared to your average brownies. They are very good, and my little allergy girl loves them with a little almond milk!  Edited to add I did sub the Vegitable oil (soybean oil) for Canola Oil.

I switched to this recipe after years of using one that contained vinegar (something about that was a bit off to me) and am always very satisfied by these brownies.

They are crumbly and maybe too oily, but I do plan to finally try the suggestions given by other users (applesauce, shortening, mixing the flour and water first, etc.).  I am dying to try the coffee instead of water suggestion but always forget until they're already mixed and in the oven!  Next time for sure.

I made these for a vegan coworker and she (and those others who tried them) are raving about them! It was extremely easy and fast to make- and easy, on-hand ingredients! It comes out a bit gooey and sticky. You could also make these gluten free with gluten-free flour. Enjoy!

Made these and they turned out great!
I used Gluten Free flour
I used 1 cup of applesauce plus 2 tablespoons oil as sub for the veggie oil
I used raw sugar
and I baked them for 35 min.
oh and I cut back the sugar a bit
they turned out good, texture wasn't exactly "brownie" but it was better than I thought it would be!
so after all my changes I give this recipe 5 stars!

Loved it! These are the changes I made... I am sure I made the recipe non vegan. :) Half cup milk and half cup water instead of one cup water. One cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar. I also added walnuts and chocolate chips. It was perfect!

These brownies were the perfect texture -- right between fudgey and cakey. We halved the recipe to begin with, but doubled the amount of vanilla, and added about a handful of chopped walnuts. I think we could have used a little less sugar, but that might just be me. Since I became vegan, I've eaten a lot less sugar, and therefore, I can really taste it in sweet things like these brownies. Some of the reviews mentioned the brownies being a little crumbly, but we didn't have that problem (though, that it why people put eggs in baked goods). We baked in a gas oven at 375 for about 35 minutes.

Not a bad brownie! But of course you can't use the white sugar if you want it vegan so we used raw sugar. Maybe next time we will make it with black beans too.

Really great. I cut down a little on the oil. Replacing with a little applesauce makes them a bit more fluffy. Also wanted to comment on a previous comment: there IS vegan white sugar out there, such as Florida Crystals. Turbinado sugar is not as fine and affects the consistency and flavor. Also, do not mix the water and the flour first before the other ingredients: this will make the blending of the ingredients virtually impossible and you will have little strings of unmixed flour dough througout the brownie (gross. I know from experience).

This recipe is not very good. It bakes but turns to mush when you cut it. They still taste good but I woldn't call them brownies

I made these in a smaller pan (9x9) and left them in the over for 15 more min. They were gooey and so yummy!

These were really good. I adjusted the oil to 1/2 cup and mashed a banana(instead if applesauce) and mixed it with 1/3 cup of the sugar so it was runny. Really good recipe for those with milk allergies. Thanks!

I had to double the recipe because I used the wrong size pan so I had to bake it twice as long. The brownies did turn out DELICIOUS! I took some to school and my homeroom devoured them. They were a hit! Totally recommended recipe..

I am not vegan or even vegetarian, but I have a dear friend who is and I made these for her.  I didn't care for the texture, but the taste was great.  My friend loved them and has requested I make them for her on several occasions.

These are excellent no-egg brownies that I would recommend.  I am trying variations on cutting down the amount of oil in this recipe, but they are thick and delicious as is in this recipe.  They can turn into a crumbly pile of goodness.

I halved the recipe and used 1/2 cup sugar, almond milk instead of water, 1/4 cup applesauce and 2T sunflower oil. The oil gave it a slight nutty flavor. I am trying to switch to a vegan diet and these are an excellent substitute for regular brownies laden with sugar and junk. Thanks for submitting!!

These were TO DIE FOR! I think I may use almond milk though instead of water to tweak the taste a little. Even my dad, who is a hard food critic, loved them!

Everyone saying "it's too crumbly", perhaps you can dry adding baking soda to the mix or use dutch process cocoa powder. Mine are still baking right now, but I added baking soda to mine and I didn't AP flour so I had to use self-rising. I'll let you know how it turns out.

These are seriously the best brownies I've ever had! They are a little more cakey than fudgey, but they are gooey, moist and delicious! I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 1/4 cup canola oil, plus 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I made them extra dark and chocolatey by using 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 1/4 cup dutch process cocoa powder and adding 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips!

Decent brownies, which are hard to do vegan. In response to the sugar issue there ARE vegan white sugars. For instance, beet sugar is vegan. It's ill-informed to think that sugar isn't vegetarian. Domino Organic sugar is vegan, as well.

Not quite a real brownie richness, but not bad for my first egg, soy, and dairy free attempt.  Did add chocolate chips as some suggested--not noticeable flavor enhancer, but haven't tried without.

Great, easy alternative to baking brownies with eggs! First of all, the white sugar issue needs to be addressed because some of the comments here state that raw sugar is the only way to make this recipe vegan. It is possible to bake vegan with white sugar. You just need to be sure you are using beet sugar, which makes up about half of the white sugar sold in the U.S. It is very easy to come by, especially in the northern half of the country. Just google "beet sugar brands." You can likely find it at your nearest supermarket. 

The only change I made when using this recipe was replacing half of the oil with vanilla soy milk, as one reviewer suggested. It definitely gave it more of a cake-like texture (which was still great), so next time I'll use all of the oil to get that gooey, brownie quality.

Very good authentic brownie taste.  I used Willow organic melted (dairy-free) margarine instead of the oil.  I also added one tsp. espresso powder to the dry ingredients.  Next time I think I will try using the applesauce idea as these could use a tiny bit more moisture.  My youngest son is allergic to eggs, dairy, and peanuts.  He really liked these, so thanks for sharing.

This is a good recipe but not vegan. White sugar is processed with charcoal from cow bones. So if you use white sugar this is not a vegan recipe. You need to substitute the white sugar with turbinado sugar - Florida Crystals or brown sugar. But very good recipe!

Very good! This is the first recipe I have tried that has yielded positive results. I did double the vanilla extract, and I used one part oil and one part melted Earth Balance vegan margarine (because I ran out of oil). I baked them for about 38 minutes, and hey turned out very, very gooey. Next time I will use all butter instead of oil, soymilk instead of water, and will bake longer. Overall, it tastes great!!

the first time I made this brownies I followed the recipes as it is and their were supreme and delicious but unfortunately we are on a diet due to my daugther XV años (like sweet sixteen) so this time I decided to use 1 cup sugar sustituve and replace the oild with applesauce and they are delicious, you can't tell the difference and I low the calories to near 80. I gave the recipe 5 starts this is the best recipe I tried for brownies.

I just realised that I rated this recipe ased on a variation I made (a while back), and it's not really fair. I am going to make these again the right way and see how they turn out.

Loved this recipe. My family loved them too. I followed other's recommendations and used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c Applesauce. I gave it a four out of five though because I think the cooking time is off. I would bake this for 35 - 40 mins and put aluminum foil around the pan to prevent the edges from burning. Other than that, I'm excited to be enjoying brownies again after I had to give up dairy for good due to an acute allergy.

These were a little too sugary for my taste and more like a cookie than a brownie.  I should have tried the applesauce fix, I didn't see that at first. Next time I'll try that and also reduce the sugar by about 1/2 cup.

Made them once with substituting apple sauce - okay if you like the chocolate apple taste.  Made them as directed the second time and they were yummy!  Great for those with lactose intolerance!

Good texture - a good combination of chewy and cakey.
Definitely has an applesauce taste to it, I might actually go with the cinnamon apple sauce next time for added taste.
I used semi-sweet baking chocolate chopped up (instead of vegan chocolate chips, which I couldn't find anywhere), and they worked very nicely! I saved a small handful to sprinkle on top, and it looked so tastey :)

The first time I made these, they didn't last the night (though I subbed vanilla soy milk for the water for more depth).  But I made them the other day with exact measurements and they turned out to be crunchy on the outer edges and super gooey and oily in the center.  I think the oil content is too high with this recipe, but it didn't stop me from throwing out the center and serving the rest!  If you use raw sugar for this recipe, I suggest grinding it a bit in a coffee grinder, otherwise they turn out a bit grainy.

I changed this recipe a bit. I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I used whole wheat spelt flour and added a heaping tablespoon of ground flaxseed (for added fiber). It was a little crumbly, but it tasted great!

Very good, but it does taste more like a muffin than a brownie.  I also used the suggestion of a previous reviewer to decrease the oil to 1/4 cup and add 3/4 cup of applesauce.  Still good, but still muffin-like.

I had no eggs and was craving brownies!  Made a few changes, though: I wasn't sure if they'd come out well, so I halved the recipe and made it in a loaf pan with half brown sugar and half white, half oil and half milk (I'm not vegan), and 1/4th cup milk chocolate chips.  They came out so moist and wonderful--not at all crumbly as some complained--though they had more of a cake consistency than brownie.  It undermines the vegan quality of the recipe, but I really think the chocolate chips were a must.  With them, I could hardly believe it wasn't a boxed mix.  Will make these again (full recipe next time) with the changes I made.

Simple enough recipe, but these turned out more like a bland chocolate cake.  I did sub out some of the oil (based on other reviewers who said they were too oily and/or tasted like oil), but I think if I had done a full cup it would not have been as good as other recipes I've tried.  Thanks anyway...

Very disappointing. I made these for my son, who is a vegan: even he didn't like them. 

Back to the box mix for us.

I'm trying to be vegan ( don't know how long that will last) and made these and they are so good. Very chocolate-y but a bit crumbly. My family hasn't tried them yet, and that's when I'll find out if it is really a good recipe. They don't like the whole vegan thing, so hopfeully they like it. I made 1/4 recipe because I didn't want a huge batch until I knew they were good. And they are!

The first I made these I followed the recipe, the second time I substituted one cup of vanilla soy milk for one cup of water and added an ener-g egg replacer. These brownies are so good, the only complaint I have is they fall apart. I thought by adding the egg replacer it would rememdy that problem, but I was wrong. I think they were much tastier with the soy milk. Definitely a keeper, even if they do fall apart in my hand. I found it necessary to grease and flour my baking pan or they tend to stick.

I stuck to the original recipe because I was excited for a gooey vegan brownie. Although it tasted great ***IT IS NOT GOOEY*** The texture is more cake like. This is a great recipe if you are looking for vegan cake-like brownies, for the gooey texture it must need some tweaking.

I’m a vegetarian and the rest of my family isn't, so I made this recipe and didn't tell them until after they had eaten a piece that they were vegan. They loved it. My friends loved it as well. I recommend it for anyone they are just delicious.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe that I will never have an excuse to buy a boxed brownie mix again.  I always use half the oil and half applesauce, and if I use regular cocoa powder, I usually increase it to a full cup.  Just this weekend I tried is with special dark powder and 3/4 cup was just perfect.  Really rich, really moist recipe.  Thanks for the post!

I replaced 1 cup of oil and water with 1/2 cup of oil and 1 1/2 cups of vanilla soy milk. I also used splenda instead of sugar, and whole wheat flour instead of white. The final product tasted like chocolate cake... or maybe even chocolate flavored bread. When I mixed the batter is was super thick. Not bad, but not absolutley superb. They were definatley gooey at all.

I used 1/4 cup oil, 3/4 cup applesauce and Hershey's Special Dark cocoa.  I took them out of the overn after 25 minutes.  

The brownies have a cake-like consistency which was a bit of a shock at first bite, as I was expecting a goey texture.  As I have a milk allergy, it is completely "legal" while still satisfying my chocolate craving. I would like it to be goey-er, but I am happy with them overall.  Yummy!

I just made these brownies (for a vegan friend who's visiting tmrw). I like this recipe because it uses ingredients on hand and doesn't delve into egg replacers, etc. I did the 1/4 vegetable oil 3/4 applesause combo and the texture was great.  For vegan brownies these were really good, but they taste a lot like brownies from a mix. I'll make the real thing for non-vegan folks.

I was very impressed with how well these turned out. I added a little less sugar (1 1/2 cups) and they were still wonderful! Its always nice to find vegan baking options.

These brownies are terrific!  We are eating vegan for health reasons so I substituted the 1 cup oil with 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce and used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup splenda. I also added about a 1/4 cup of flax seed meal.  Absolutely delicious!

After reading all the rave reviews, I have to say I was slightly disappointed. They are nice and chocolatey, but the texture is a little strange. They won't go to waste, but they aren't the best dessert I've ever had. Just OK. I did also substitute applesauce for some of the oil. Not sure if I will make again.

Are you kidding me??? This is great! Really, just make it. Threw in a handful of choc chips as one reviewer suggested - but didn't mix in, just laid on top and patted down a bit (be careful, this ruins the "vegan" part). Also, I only had half the white flour so I subbed wheat flour for the other half. No problem there. And I cooked for longer to reduce the gooey as one reviewer suggested - still had super moist brownies.

EXCELLENT!!!! I just made these and they are soooo good!! I took the advice of some of the other reviews, and did soy milk instead of water and only 1/4 cup of oil & 3/4 cup of applesauce, and they turned out great, very moist, I also did gluten free baking mix instead of regular flour. Fantastic! This recipe is a keeper!

If I'd made these exactly, they would have been decadent. Unfortunately, I only had about 1/4 cup white flour left, and had to use whole wheat for the rest. I definitely tasted the difference there. I also did the 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cups applesauce as suggested. They came out perfectly soft and moist and not at all greasy. Maybe tomorrow they'll be nice and chewy, too.  The only real problem I have with this recipe is the crazy amount of sugar. It may have been my use of whole wheat, but even with all that sugar, they just weren't sweet enough.

Fab! If you have a convection oven, turn it on. The brownies tend to sag in the middle, but this almost totally prevents that from happening. I've made these about 5 times now for my mom. I also threw in some coconut for binding and it worked wonders.

*4 years later, I'm still using this recipe.  It's gotten me through quite a few potlucks, and if you've got cocoa powder on hand, it's dessert baking at its cheapest.  Still recommend reducing the oil and cutting back the sugar a bit.  Keep an eye on the sugar:cocoa ratio, as too much cocoa can taste chalky.  On the plus side, this recipe is fine a little underbaked, it just comes out gooey and delicious regardless :)

I've made these so many times, and I always get positive reviews from vegan friends. we always add just a smidge more cocoa and a handful or two of chocolate chips. the recipe is really forgiving, but be careful not to cook them too long! my oven cooks these in about 20 minutes....

After reading reviews I used 1 cup of soy milk instead of water and used 3/4 of a cup of vegetable oil. I like fudgy brownies so only baked them around 26 minutes. After 15 minutes of cooling the center was still very gooey , and still fairly oily, though this meant an incredibly fudgy gooey brownies. Decadent and by no means cake like, though very rich and rather oily.

This was so helpful! A very dear friend of mine has recently become vegan for health reasons and I had been kind of annoyed (if that is the right word) that he hadn't been able to eat a LOT of things he used to. This recipe has really helped because now he can eat my brownies.

I was looking for something to satisfy my chocolate craving and these seemed to fit.  I only made half a batch using half water, half soy milk, and half veggie oil half veggie shortening.  I also topped them off with a peanut butter frosting.  Overall the taste was amazing, but the consistency was not great; they fell apart when I attempted to cut them.  They need an egg sustitute; maybe Ener-G or applesauce would help.

i substituted white sugar for brown sugar and vegetable oil for olive oil.
the batter was a little weird, and the finished product was okay, but a little weird.  still pretty good considering it is vegan.

These are okay as sweet, chocolatey, vegan sludge (and I mean that in a positive way), but it won't strike non-vegans as a brownie. Like many vegan baked goods it falls short at trying to be something that it isn't. This recipe would benefit from a stronger protein binder (soymilk perhaps?).

I was worried I couldn't find any vegan recipe because on my mom's birthday, I have be a vegetarian...And I couldn't last a day without chocolate! But these saved me. I used soymilk instead of water, and used brown sugar(a little less than what this recipe calls for). Then it turned out great! Its not gooey for me, but it did turn out as bittersweet brownies for me.

Not a bad recipe. I added a teaspoon of almond extract as well as some chopped almonds to the batter. I also put in some egg substitute, but wish I hadn't, was too cakey that way. I'll try it again without.

YUMMY! I thought 1 cup of oil was a lot, so I only used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. I also used 1 cup of Rice Milk instead of water. They turned out great!!

it was a very quick and easy receipe, cheap too made from ingredients just lying around the house. Very rich, a bit heavy, will use a bit more baking power next time and cook for bout 5 mins longer, but on the whole delicious and chocolaty!definatly a keeper!

End product was definitely moist and delicious, very chocolatey!  Concerned about the amount of oil and sugar, I might try to adjust the recipe to use prune juice or applesauce, next time I make them.

These brownies are great!! They are cake-like more than fudgy, but they are super moist. Mine didn't crumble at all. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Maybe a little bit less oil, but almost a full cup. I used Canola oil. I think the greasiness than some  people experienced may be due to the type of oil used. I recommend this recipe for a cakelike, but moist and rich choclatey brownie.

The reason for me using this recipe was mainly because I did not have any eggs or milk. I loved how fast this recipe is to make! I didn't have vegetable oil, only extra light olive oil, but it seemed to do just fine. I did however add about 3/4 of a cup more water to the batter because it was way to thick, I could barely whisk it by hand or using my electrtic mixer. Once I added the extra water it seemed to even it out. It only needed exactly thirty minutes in the oven and it looks pretty good. I haven't tasted it yet but I am hoping it tastes just like the store bought mixes, or better! I did have some chocolate chips handy and sprinkled them on top before baking, plus after I pulled it out of the oven I spread melted chocolate over the top of it. I am letting it cool right now and I hope it tastes good!! This is my first time making brownies from scratch so I hope my husband and I like it!
EDIT: I made this recipe again this time without adding more water, and it made some semi-thick brownies, I was very impressed. I spread some fudge topping on it and didn't add chocolate chips this time so we will see how it turns out!

YUMMY! These brownies were amazing! I added some pecans and 6 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate chips before baking. My meat-eating, vegan-fearing husband gobbled these all up! This is my new favorite brownie recipe.

As is, I would rate this recipe a 3 star.  The flavor was just ok, texture was fine.  However, when I added a chocolate chip frosting to it they were wonderful.  So I would recommend either adding frosting as I did or adding chocolate chips to the recipe.

Yum! Probably the best homemade brownie recipe I have found. And what's better, it's Vegan :) The brownies came out rich, moist, very chocolatey, and not too crumbly.  I too, like others, altered the recipe slightly by using both white and whole wheat flour.

Great recipe!  Very fudgy...a true dessert...nothing healthy about it.  I added about 1/3 of a bag of chocolate chips and 1 Tbs extra coco powder.  Next time I might reduce the oil by about 1-2 Tbs. and replace with soymilk.  

But, these were a hit even with my non vegan co-workers.

A little more cake-like consistency than I expected but the taste is very good and my vegan friend loved them.  I will definately use this recipe again!
