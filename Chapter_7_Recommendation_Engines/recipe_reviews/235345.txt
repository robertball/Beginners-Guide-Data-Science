The star ingredient is the avocado, it brings incredible creaminess to this smoothie.  Typically, I find myself adding more ice to smoothies because we like them thick, but in this case, I added more water because it was too thick and my blender was struggling to blend it.  The blueberries and the mint partner well and each flavor is distinct.
