I think it would be better if you sauteed the mushrooms and onions in a bit of the bacon grease for flavour.

A million stars!

I doubled this, used a full pound of bacon, added DRY ranch dressing and folded in half a bag of coleslaw mix that I'd briefly steamed. I also mashed the potatoes with a stick of butter, couple big scoops of sour cream and a little hot milk.

Holy frijoles! Incredible side dish. Be careful that you hold yourself back, you'll stuff yourself silly if you aren't careful.

I was just lazy and threw the onions and mushrooms in a few minutes before the bacon was done cooking (I sliced my bacon before cooking) to save time.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My potatoes were a little too stiff when mashed, so I added a little fat free half and half.  These were perfect and a huge hit at our house.  My husband has already asked for them again.

Excellent!  Hubs and I both loved these potatoes, which I served with Classic Meatloaf and Chef John's Mushroom Gravy.  It's perhaps just a matter of personal taste, but I think either olive oil, butter or even bacon grease are more flavorful choices than the vegetable oil for cooking the mushrooms and onions.  I also added chopped green onion for freshness, color and a little bite, some softened cream cheese and a splash of milk. These are just packed with great flavor.

This was a good recipe, but I had to add a few things I used 3 tablespoons of ranch. I used a tablespoon of bacon fat to cook the mushrooms and onions to add to the flavor.   
I added black pepper to the whipped mash potatoes and also some milk because the potatoes were dry. The were a hit at the table my 9 year old Autistic child.It was a hit at the dinner table. I will make again.

A big hit with the family!  These are a nice change from plain mashed.  I also added the onion and mushrooms to the bacon just before it was done.  Great flavor.  Maybe next time I'll try adding some grated cheddar.

This was great even though I had to use sour cream as I did not have any ranch dressing.  I do now though, and am making it again tonight.  I used the bacon fat to saute the mushrooms and onions as it seemed a shame to waste the extra flavour.

I am new to cooking so I follow recipes to a T. I should have read the reviews first as they were very dry, but from fear of ruining dinner I didn't add anything else to them. (lesson learned lol) In any case, I guess these just aren't for us.  My husband was less than impressed and I really didn't care for them either. I love all of the ingredients on their own and thought this would be amazing! Maybe improving the texture would have made all the difference, I'm not sure. But I was certainly dissapointed that I didn't like it!

These were great mashed potatoes. I realize as I am writing this review, that I did not add the ranch dressing. I did however add 1/4 cup shredded smoked gouda. So very good! I will make as directed next time but this was great! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is excellent! You should definitely cook this because it's too easy not to. Anyways, I do agree with others regarding cooking the mushrooms and onions in the bacon grease. Also, I found out that to get the right texture for the mash potatoes, I had to add some milk (maybe a cup in total). My mouth is watering thinking about the leftovers in the fridge.

A very good recipe. It did need some milk as potatoes were a little dry, but other than that I followed recipe as stated.

These were very good.  I didn't have regular bacon, so I used the real bacon bits and it worked great.  As other reviewers stated, they were very dry, so next time I will add milk.

DEEEELICIOUS! I more or less eyeballed everything adding some milk to make them more creamy, extra ranch and salt and pepper. I was dying to add some blue cheese, but didn't do it, but I will next time as I think that would make these even better. I used a whole 8oz. pkg. of sliced mushrooms, idaho potatoes and 8 slices of bacon. Will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I couldn't really taste the ranch dressing, but these were still really good.  I cooked the onions and mushrooms in leftover bacon grease instead of vegetable oil, and added milk like other reviewers did.  Great recipe!

I made these tonight and the only thing different is I diced the onion not sliced. I would make again with only one change.... Next time (and there will be a next time) when I cook the onion and mushrooms in the pan I will add some garlic to it. To me it was missing garlic but then again that is my own personal taste. Very good recipe!

This was fantastic.  But like many others, I added some milk since the mixture was too stiff without it.  I also added course ground garlic salt for a little added zip.

My favorite.I didn't have ranch dressing so added cream cheese. As a personal twist, I like to melt a little butter in a small pan, make a large patty , and brown the bottom before serving.This potato tastes great with anything you serve with it.

Instead of Ranch dressing, I added sour creme and a little "Mrs. Dash."  Turned out great!  This will certainly be a staple around my house!

I loved this recipe.  I do not like salt, so I never use it to cook, and so I have never had very good luck with mashed potatoes, but this was delicious!  The ranch gave the potatoes the best flavor, and it was so easy.  Thanks for the post, this is a keeper.

Amazing! Used Russet potatoes and ended up adding about 1/2c (maybe more) of 1% milk.

This was delicious. I added more ranch dressing than what the recipe calls for. I also used turkey bacon.

very yummy:) I used turkey bacon cause that's what we like and I also used my kitchen scissors to cut the bacon before cooking and just cooked the mushroom and onion for the last few minutes with it. Using turkey there's not much fat so I didn't need to drain it. Didn't add any ranch my hubby doesn't like it in potatoes but my daughter does so she added some to hers. thanks for sharing:)

Great! I will be making these mashed potatoes again. I added on extra thing. Shredded cheese on top then put it in the oven for about 10-15 minutes.

Very good!  The bacon can get a tad mushy in the hot potatoes, so you have to really make it crisp before adding.  I was out of mushrooms so I added a bit of horseradish for more flavor and zip.  Turned out great!

Excellent and very tasty potato recipe!  I love the combination of fried onion, mushroom and bacon.  I used crumbled bacon instead and fried it with the red onion and mushroom!  Other than that, I followed the instructions and added the right amounts for each ingredient and it turned out great!  I accompanied this tasty potato dish with Cajun deviled eggs, steamed broccoli covered with a three-cheese sauce and garlic-pepper tenderloin steak.  It’s unfortunate the steak was too spicy for my girlfriend; otherwise, it was a great combination especially since we were drinking a great bottle of Malbec (Pascual Toso) from Argentina.   Delicious!  I will definitely make this great potato recipe again!

These potatoes are unbelievably good!! I made them to go with 'Bratwurst, Sauerkraut and Bean Casserole' but ended up having to cook Tater Tots for Husband, because I ate both the servings...

I stuffed green and red peppers with these potatoes after cooking and microwaved until peppers are tender (3-4 min.) for a different spin on potatoes. I also omitted the mushrooms for my husband. They were a hit! Great recipe. The flavor was wonderful and the consistency was perfect! My family has already asked to have them again. I think we have a new favorite!

Excellent recipe!  I prefer to use the bacon fat as others suggested for the saute of the mushrooms and onion.  I think if people are finding the potatoes dry they may be using a different type of potato, Yukon Gold potatoes don't need as much liquid as, say, russsets.

Yummy for a change of pace try this recipe. I like having a recipe for mashed potatoes that doesn't have milk in it. This is delicious all on its own if you don't have gravy for your mashed potatoes.

I was really excited for the recipe because who doesn't love bacon and potatoes; however, I was quite disappointed. The onions were overpowering and the potatoes were dry. I compensated by added sour cream and more butter. Also, there wasn't a lot of flavor to it.

These mashed potatoes are fantastic!  I didn't have bacon but I'm sure that would add another degree of yum.  As I was mashing them I thought they still looked a little dry so I did double the butter and ranch dressing.  They were just creamy and wonderful.

These potatos have the potential to be 5 stars but this recipe was kind of bland. We add some chives to jazz it up a little and some cream cheese to make it creamier. With those changes... we would make these again.

Ridiculously good ... but I added more butter and Ranch than called for, plus a small pour of whole milk and some leftover creme fraiche.  Hubby said they were the best mashed potatoes he'd ever had.

These potatoes were great. We made them to go with Easter ham and the whole family raved. Husband said they were the best potatoes he has ever had and he is a picky eater. We added just a little milk for a creamier consistency. Will definitely make these again.

This was good.  My local grocery store didn't have Yukon Gold, so I used about 4 lbs. of a different brand.  The potatoes were dry during mashing, however, probably because I had boiled them the night before.  I used about 5-6 tablespoons of ranch dressing.  It still didn't affect the flavor at all that I could tell.  The finished product tasted good though, and the tastes of the mushrooms, bacon, and onion added but didn't overpower.

I call these "heart attack potatoes"  They are soooo good, but not for everyday!  I use sour cream instead of ranch, and to make them even tastier (and more unhealthy!) I add in some shredded cheddar cheese.  They taste almost like the filling of pirogies mmmmm!

DELICIOUS!  I made these last night with a pork roast and green bean casserole and they were phenomenal!  I used extra ranch and omitted the onions (family preference) and added some garlic and they were just wonderful.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was very good! Seems like it was missing something though. Maybe spices, a little salt and pepper. I did add some half and half to make it a bit more creamy. Turned out very nice!

These were great! I didn't have any mushrooms, but I used extra onion and bacon, plus a little extra ranch. I cooked to onion in the bacon grease and really carmelized them. Very good, but next time I'm going to follow the recipe exactly because I love mushrooms and I know it'll be even better!

Thanks for the recipe! I've made some changes for my taste: Cut potatoes into even smaller sizes, kept bacon leftover oil to cook mushrooms, used green onions instead, added 1 tsp garlic salt & 2-3 tbsp of butter, 2 handfuls of corn, and enough milk to make whole potato mixture silkier. With my changes, even my skeptical Mom (who dislikes new recipes) loves it!

Very good recipe! I'm such a sucker for bacon, I added more. I used milk instead of ranch. Got a few compliments at a potluck! Thank you!

I made these for Thanksgiving and what a wonderful change to just normal mashed potatoes.  I have tried different recipes for mashed potatoes before and was never  a fan but these were so good!  I will make these again.

This was very good but I doctored it up.  I cooked the bacon, onions and mushrooms together.  Then I mashed the potatoes up a bit with the ranch - just so they weren't big pcs.  Then I added the potatoes to the bacon mixture in the pan and cooked them for a bit trying to get all of the flavors incorporated into the potatoes.  They were good this way but I wish I would have fried them a little more to get the potatoes a little crispy.  I would use the ingredients again but change how I cook it.

This recipe is the best!!! I didn't mash the potatos, but I did fry them with the onions, bacon, and mushrooms before adding the dressing. I think I probably tripled the amount of dressing added. I also added plenty of black pepper. My husband said he would eat these every single night if I made them. Yum!
