I cooked this dish last night  It turned out pretty good.  Not the greatest thing, but the kids love it!  Very kid friendly and something they could easily help with.  I did mine on the stove since I have a small microwave.  It was VERY simple and the flavor isn't bad.  We added some of the easter candy we had left to the mix at the end.  made it pretty interesting and colorful.  (we used sixlets and about 7 rolo's)  The rolos make for a carmelly surprise when you find one.  :)

This is so easy and simple.  A nice change from the usual rice cereal.  I did a mix if regular and honey-nut oat cereal.

Quick and easy treat!  I reduced the butter to 3 tablespoons and only used 1/4 cup peanut butter and it tasted great!

Wonderfully delicious!  I made these because my son has diabetes and needs frequent snacks and has tired of all the "normal" snacks.  Not only does my son love them but so does the rest of the family.  Very very easy to make.

These are delicious and a nice change from Rice Krispie treats. My kids love them and I feel like it's a good snack because you get some protein and fiber along with your sugar. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Will definitely be making these again, thanks for sharing!

I was looking for something to satisfy my craving for peanut butter and cereal... I used Rice Krispies for the cereal - crunchy peanut butter and I only had big marshmallows. Also - I put a layer of peanut butter chocolate ganache on top - delish! My rice krispie was a little hard... not enough marshmallow? Not sure. But it was tasty!

These are easy to make and so yummy. I used chunky peanut butter and have also used M & M's.( The new pretzel kind were awesome.) I will make over & over!

Very easy take on the old marshmallow treat classic. I combined some honey nut and chocolate cheerios that were about to go stale, and they're fabulous. To better manage marshmallow mixture and clean up, spray your mixing bowl, measuring cup, and spoon or spatula with nonstick cooking spray before using.

Works good with any cereal. I used to make these when my grown kids were little with the cereal they begged for then didn't like.  Now I make them for my 94 y/o mother with the non sugar coated cereal she gets but won't eat.

Used butter instead of margarine and large marshmallows.   Love love love these.   Had to stop myself from eating the whole pan.   Husband and toddler love them too.

I made these recently for a quick dessert to eat after a heavy meal.  They were a perfect sweet treat and everyone loved them!  I used generic toasted O's cereal and made them on the stove-top just like rice krispy squares, and it worked out fine.  You have to be quick about it and use a low heat since the mini marshmallows melt fast and you don't want to burn them.  I melted butter, added marshmallows, melted those, added peanut butter, mixed that all together then added the cereal.  Poured and pressed it all into a greased casserole dish and let it harden for a while before finally cutting it into squares.  Everyone loved them and they were still good the next day.  Next time I might add some mini chocolate chips or a chocolate drizzle on top.  Yum!

I used Cheerios, 3/4 c peanut butter, and added a few drops of vanilla and a tablespoon of brown sugar.  Warmed the ingredients on the stove rather than in the microwave.

I used plain cheerios & added 1/2 cup semisweet choc chips instead of pb & it was just ok. Then I melted Reeses pb chips & butter and dunked the mini rectangle squares in there and it took the recipe from ok to delish!

Ok, EVERYONE in my family loved these!  From my 1 year old to 17 year old and even my husband.  These were quickly devoured.  I just wish I had more cheerios and marshmallows to make a batch right now.  Will definitely be making these again and again.  I thought they were so much better than rice krispie treats.... which can scrape your mouth, and the peanut butter kick was perfect.  You can dress these up with candies and chocolate, but I thought it was perfect just as written.  Great treat to sneak protein and whole grains into!

Fun recipe. I added a spoonful of Nutella and loved the chocolatly flavor that it added. I also used multigrain cherrios to give them color variation. Yummy!

I had some cereal to use up so I decided to try this.  Made as directed, except added 6 chocolate kisses I had laying around.
