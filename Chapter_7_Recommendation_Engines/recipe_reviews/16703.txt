very tasty.  instead of breasts on the bone, i used boneless, skinless breasts and made sure to smother the top with leftover crumbs plus an extra half batch of butter/garlic/worcesteshire sauce mixture.  cooking time was more like 40 minutes.

Unbelievably easy to make and simple to modify if you don't have all the ingredients. I used boneless breasts and homemade bread crumbs. I also substituted onion powder for the onions and spicy brown mustard in the butter mixture instead of mustard powder in the bread crumbs, since I didn't have any in the house. It was so delicious I'm going to make it regularly!

Excellent chicken recipe! When making this, I love using fresh bread crumbs. I just throw whatever type of bread I have in the house (even bagels in desperation) into the food processor. It really makes a difference. I also used a ton more garlic then called for only because we're totally addicted. If you don't have the onions in the house, it still tastes awesome. I personally don't mind having extra bread crumbs because I usually sprinkle them around the chicken and when dinner is done and eaten, I like to nibble on the buttery, toasty crumbs left in the pan. I know, I know...very bad, but sooooo good!! Hey, the cook has to have fun once in a while!

This is DELICIOUS! Since I just bought a new crock pot and have been experimenting with it, I made this dish in it.  I set it on low and it was done in an hour and a half--and very nicely brown all over!  There is too much breading...you can definitely cut that in half.  But in the crockpot, it's moist and juicy!  I did spray the bottom and sides of the crockpot with Pam before starting.  This is a very easy dish to make and a great combination of flavors!  This one is going to be a new family/company favorite!  I made sweet potato pie and a fresh garden salad with it...YUMMY!

My roomies and I liked this a lot and followed the recipe almost exactly (which I usually don't do...) but I had two problems. I used minced garlic in a jar and it definitely didn't give enough garlic flavor, so I would add more next time. (Maybe the onions overpowered it, but that's fine!)  Also, there was a TON of the bread crumb mixture left over, which I just poured over top of the chicken before I put it in the oven, so I recommend using less than two cups.

This turned out great.  I use boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut the breading ingredients in half - there's still plenty of breading.  Also, if you don't have French-fried onions on hand and don't feel like going to the store, this recipe is still tasty without them.

The french fried onions really make this recipe.  My kids ate every bite of chicken (and I make alot of different versions of chicken)!  I added sliced provolone on top of the chicken (used chicken tenders) and then made rigatoni.  I also covered both in homemade spagetti sauce.

I have a family of very picky eaters, but this recipe made dinner time so pleasant.  Everyone loved it!  I made bread crumbs from leftover frozen italian loaf bread.  Just grate the bread while still frozen.  Some of the reviewers thought this was soggy.  Using fresh bread crumbs absorbs more of the juices.  I also increased the amount of onions by about a 1/4 cup.

Tasted great!  Just not happy with all of the leftover coating I had...next time I'll scale that down a bit--always easier to add a bit more than to throw so much away.

Very flavorful....I did crunch up the onions a bit more than the picture looked like was done.  Great taste and would definitely make again! Very easy to do too!

Super delicious!  I would make it again with no changes.  I've had variations of this without the fried onions and mustard powder.  Adding those extra ingredients just gives it a little extra zing of flavor.

UPDATE: WHEN I FIRST TRIED THIS, I WASN'T COMPLETELY CONVINCED THIS WAS WORTH A REPEAT. IT HAS BEEN MY MISSION (WELL, NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION HAHA!) TO REVISIT THE RECIPES I GAVE MEDIOCRE REVIEWS IN HOPES THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO TWEAK THEM TO MY LIKING THUS IMPROVING MY OPINION OF THEM. I'M SOOOOO GLAD I GAVE THIS ONE A SECOND CHANCE!!! THE FRIED ONIONS (WHICH I DIDN'T CARE FOR INITIALLY) ARE THE BEST PART. :) THEY MAKE THIS A TRULY UNIQUE DISH. I BET CHEDDAR FRIED ONIONS AND MELTED CHEDDAR CHEESE WOULD ALSO BE DELICIOUS (AND A FUN CHANGE OF PACE!).... GIVE THIS A TRY - YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED! Although I prefer my mom's chicken Parmesan recipe much better, this was decent nonetheless. Having said this, I DO like the idea of dipping each chicken breast in garlic butter and think it adds GREAT flavor. I now do that when making my mom's recipe. :) NOTE: As with any Italian entree, this pairs particularly well with a green veggie (i.e. broccoli, green beans, etc.) and / or pasta, a tossed garden salad and garlic bread. I like to serve mine with cheesy carrot casserole or broccoli with roasted red peppers to change things up a bit. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jennifer! :-)

I made this for dinner and it turned out very tasty and juicy.  I added garlic salt to the breading mixture, and baked it for almost 45 minutes.  This is a keeper!

Very easy to make. Tasted great! Simple ingredients. Not sure if I liked the onions all that much... but my husband did. I'll definitely make this again... any suggestions on what to do with all the extra bread crumbs?

Very good...and i forgot the parmesan for the breadcrumb mixture! It defintely still tastes great without it. I also pounded my boneless, skinless breasts to about 1/4-1/2 in thickness and baked about 30 mins. I used half butter/half olive oil instead of all butter. Do not skip the mustard or the crunchy onions...they defintely made this chicken    dish stand out from the others.

Amazing chicken!! Tasted great! I did make a couple changes... I didn't had enough bread crumbs, but I had 2 large cans of french fried onions, so i mooshed the 2 cans of french fried onions up in a gallon baggy, then dumped 1c of bread crumbs along with the parm cheese. I also added pepper to it. I didn't have worcteshersire sauce, so I made my own with 1/2c of soy sauce, 1/3c of maple syrup, 2 tablespoons of malt vinegar, 2 TBS of rice vinegar, 2 TBS of cooking cherry, 1 tsp. of ground ginger, and a dash of pepper. I also added the mustard powder to the sauce rather then the cheese and onion mixture. I also used 2 cookie sheets instead of the glass pan!

great flavor.  a few things i would change next time...use real onions instead of the FF onions (to much grease)  cut bread crumbs in half ( I used Italian BC) Bone and cut the chicken into 2"strips and bake on cookie sheet.  they did not have enough space to bake in the 9 x 13.  the worschester and the dry mustard add a unique flavor.  But all in all a great flavor combination.  Good JOB JEN

All my family loved this chicken.  I didn't melt the butter and worcestershire sauce in a pan, but instead in the microwave but overall, I think it still worked out great.  I did add garlic to the breadcrumbs instead of in with the butter and sauce and it still turned out great.  My son didn't want bread crumbs on his chicken, thinking I was tearing up big chunks of bread.  He said it was way, way better than store bought chicken tenders and they didn't even know there was extra of the onions in the crumbing.  Oh and I halved the amount of chicken and butter but not the rest.  Yes I have breadcrumb leftovers, but great for another time for maybe turkey.  A total winner.  Thanks.

Hubby and I gave this four stars, it was delicious! I halved the dry ingredients for 6-8 boneless chicken breast and it was plenty!! I piled the extra on top for extra crunch!! I baked on a foil lined, then sprayed with pam, cookie sheet. This way it gets good and cripy and clean up is a breeze!! I did not add the mustard powder and didn't miss it. I won't add the worcestershire next time because it curtled my butter and there is plenty of salt and flavor, especially if using seasoned bread crumbs. I may cut back on the bread crumbs next time because I prefer the flavor of the french onion and parmesan. Served with steamed and buttered broccoli and piled cripy crumbs on top that had fallen off around the baked chicken, YUMMY!!

The flavor was outstanding. However, it came out a bit soggy and I had a difficult time getting the onions to stick to the chicken.  I pounded my onions in a plastic bag, to a slightly smaller size so I wouldn't have the problem of them not sticking. I still had the problem so, next time I will pound them to a much finer consistency. I  served this over bow-tie pasta with red sauce drizzled over the top of the chicken and a slice of mozzarella melted on top of the sauced chicken. Delicious.

This recipe, like others have said, is great because it's both delicious and versatile. I used onion powder instead of French fried onions, threw some French bread into the food processor for fresh bread crumbs, skipped the mustard powder since i didn't have any in the pantry, and added some flat-leaf parsley into the breading mixture since i had some on hand. Since i had a lot of breading left over, i sprinkled some of it on the bottom of the pan, laid the chicken breasts on top, and then sprinkled a little more on top along with a drizzle of more garlic butter. So good!

WONDERFUL! Crispy and delish! Let it marinate in the garlic butter in plastic bags in the fridge for 30 minutes or so, occassionally getting the bag out and rubbing everything around in the bag. I did add a little bit of extra garlic b/c we love it here in Louisiana and some extra mustard for flavor. Also gave it a dash of creole seasoning for spice!

I have made this twice.  The second time I let the chicken soak in the butter for a little while before coating it which made for a juicier flavor.

This was so good!  One of my favorites!  I agree with the others though, you need to cut down on the bread crumbs.  For 4 chicken breasts I scaled the recipe for 4 but used 1/2 c. crumbs, 1/4 (3 oz.) can onions.  It did take closer to 40 minutes to cook.

This chicken was sooo yummy... I cooked the chicken in a frying pan, since it was coated with butter anyway.  I also didn't put mustard powder in the bread crumbs, I added dijon mustard to the butter mixture.. it gave it a very nice flavor.  Everyone loved it!! thank you Jennifer.

Everyone loved it! Husband and daughter are already asking me to make it again. I baked it on a wire rack over a cookie sheet so the bottom of the chicken wouldn't get too soggy. Made it with this site's recipe: broccoli with garlic butter and cashews. My husband dumped the remaining sauce on top of the chicken and pasta we had on the side and said it was his second favorite meal ever.

Was low on shredded parmesan - had to add about 1/2 cup shredded swiss cheese.  Hammered down four chicken breasts.  For tender chicken would only bake breasts for 30 minutes in preheated oven @350.  In the future will definitely not fry but BAKE chicken breasts using this recipe.  

From my family RAVE reviews.  Thank you for the recipe!

For my family, this recipe was just okay, nothing special.  When you do make this, however,  cut down on the bread crumbs as I threw out probably half of them after coating my chicken pieces.

This has to be one of the best dishes I have made from this  site. My husband normally does not like chicken breast and he was still raving about this the next day. I have giving this recipe out to many of my friends. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

It smelled so good while I was breading the chicken tenders. I substituted matzo meal for bread crumbs and croutons for the French-fried onions and served the chicken tenders with ranch dressing. I had a lot of breading left over.

Made just like recipe said.  I used 5 whole chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise.  They turned out very good, moist on the inside and crisp on the outside.   Didn't take long to put together and made a nice presentation.  Had plenty of breading.  Good recipe.  Nice to be able to just do in oven and not have to bother with browning in fry-pan first.

Not having any canned onion rings, I used diced onions sauted in butter on low heat.  I added a little bread crumbs before it was cooked soft.  I used half  the bread crumbs and doubled the garlic.  I think it's the best chicken I've ever tasted

Very good and easy. I only used 5 chicken breasts, cut into strips, and it was perfect. I would suggest reducing the amount of bread crumbs to 1 1/2 cups.

Very moist and tasty.  I used boneless chicken tenders and added just a dash of garlic powder to the butter mixture.  I did as suggested and cut the breading mixture in half...which was the perfect amount.  The whole family approved!

Needs a bit of  salt and  pepper but go easy on the salt - cheeses, etc.  are already  salty. But still could use a bit. All the flavors  work well but I  would cut back on  the bread  crumbs.

We liked this well enough, but I thought there were way too many flavors going on.  Garlic, mustard, parmesan, worchestershire and onion are all really powerful flavors.  If I were to make it again, I would leave out the ground mustard and the onions.  I think that would let the parmesan garlic flavor stand out a bit more.

This recipe wasn't as good as I antcipated it being but it was tasty all the same.  I used the leftover bread crumb mixture with a pound of frozen cut green beans and sauteed them in butter over medium heat for a few minutes.  It was a perfect compliment to the chicken.

Great chicken, moist and flavorful. Used boneless skinless breasts, doubled the butter mix and drizzled the remainder over the top, then grated some fresh Parmigiano Regianno on top and baked for 30 minutes. Perfect!

I make parmesan chicken fairly regularly, and this was a nice change of pace from the usual. I enjoyed the flavor of the garlic butter with the mustard. The only thing is my chicken was not at all browned, even though it was fully cooked, so I broiled it for the last couple minutes. Also I did find the breading to be slightly soggy, however the chicken still tasted really good.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it was just OK.  I used boneless breasts, eyeballed the breading rather than measuring it exactly, and crumbled the onion pieces.  I also added way more garlic than it called for.  I had hoped that the onion taste would come out more in the breading, but I couldn't taste it at all.  The garlic flavor was nice.  My husband and I both thought that the breading came out too soggy.  Next time I might pan saute it in olive oil or butter rather than baking, or I might broil it for the last few minutes to crisp it up.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I omitted the onions (I'm a pretty picky eater) and during the last 10 minutes or so of baking I covered them with spaghetti sauce and mozerella cheese.  I will definately use this recipe again!!

Very, very yummy!  I used margarine, instead of butter and accidentally bought boneless, skinless chicken breast strips (didn't realize it until I was getting ready to make it).  My husband loved the taste, and went back for seconds.  The chicken was moist and juicy, and I cooked mine uncovered for 35 minutes.  My six year old like it as well, and said I should cook like "this" more often. 
This will definitely become a staple chicken recipe in my house.  Thanks so much, Jennifer, for sharing!

This sounded interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. All you could taste was garlic and the french fried onions. I baked the chicken per the recipe for 35 minutes and it was still pink in the middle even though the juices ran clear. My boyfriend couldn't even eat it. I will definitely not make again.

This recipe was very good & easy to make...I used drumsticks instead of thighs & onion salt instead of french fried onion & 1 cup of bread crumbs as 2 cups is to much.  I am going to recommend this recipe to my daughter.

This was an excellent recipe.  We love "shake n bake" but this was hundreds times than anything in a box!  It was super easy, and very tasty, tender and juicy. We paired with alfredo pasta--just an excellent meal!

Simple to prepare and delicious.  Chicken was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I added shredded mozzerella cheese on top with about 10 minutes left in the baking time.  Served with pasta

Followed previous reviewers suggestions to pound chicken flat, smother the chicken with remaining coating and make an additional 1/2 batch of the garlic butter sauce to drizzle over the top. Baked for 30 minutes. Served it with angel hair pasta and some jarred spaghetti sauce. Awesome!

This is a great dish.  Added a little more Butter, Cheese and sprinkled some grated parmesan over the top at about 7 minutes left in oven time.  A keeper for sure.

My husband loved it!  I increased the garlic and double dipped the batter.  If you make the full recipe and double dip, you should double the butter mixture.

This was extremely good, but there was way too much breading left over.  I put it in a ziplog bag and put it in the freezer for next time.

I love "easy" and "different".  This was both.  Dipping the chicken in the garlic/butter/Worcester sauce really added some zip!  I will make this again!

I didn't have the french fried onions called for but did the recipe anyways. The chicken is moist and flavorful and would probably be even tastier with that missing ingredient so till then I will rate it 4.

Even the picky kids liked this. I used split chicken breasts with the skin instead. They came out very moist and the flavor ran through the skin. I was asked what the secret ingredient in the bread crumbs was. This went well with the asparagus and tomato salad.

Awesome! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a little less bread crumbs and a little more onion just to use them up. Next time I make this dish, I will cut the chicken in half lengthwise (I haven't gotten the art of pounding down yet) and pour all the extra breading over it. Even the picky kids asked for seconds!

Good flavor, but SO MUCH breading!  I cut it in half to begin with and still have a ton leftover.  Guess I will have to make it again!  Good occasional dish, but won't be adding it into the regular rotation.

I thought this recipe turned out super yummy!  It's probably because of the butter and French fried onions.  I used boneless breasts and cooked for 20 minutes.  It was easy to put together too. I kept nibbling the crunch onion pieces in the pan.  Husband also loved the chicken, four year old son, not so much.

Soooo good!  This tasted just like a chicken recipe that I used to get at a restaurant until they changed management and went downhill. Afterward I used to crave that chicken, and now I can make my own. Couldn't have been easier but tasted like it took a lot of time. I did have to make more garlic butter sauce as I didn't have any left over to drizzle over the chicken. Next time I will just double the sauce.  I would make this for company...it was that good!

This recipe was good.  Some changes that I made... I didn't have any french fried onions but this was still fine.  I didn't want to use a whole 1/2 cup of butter, so I used probably 1/4 and then added water to the garlic/worcestershire mixture.  The recipe might have been better using the full amount of butter but we thought it was just fine cutting back.  This took about 36 minutes to cook.

Very tasty!  My family loved it and we'll make it again.  Reading from others I used only one cup of bread crumbs and added 2 tsp. garlic powder and it was perfect.  Adjust the baking time for the type of chicken-cut you're using and it will turn out great, thanks!

This recipe was delicious and the chicken was very moist.  I used boneless chicken and it still turned out great.  Everyone loved this recipe and liked it even better the second day and chicken stayed moist upon reheating.  Cover it though when reheating in oven.

I found this dish to be very delicious! It's definitely a new recipe for my chicken dinners. I'm happy to have a new way to fix chicken for my family. My husband wants to know if there is a way to substitute butter for something low-fat? Otherwise...EXCELLENT!

My friend Susan made this last weekend, and I've never tasted such tender chicken.  The butter really seems to gives it a full rich flavor while the french-fried onions give it an unexpected crunch.  Goes well with about any side dish.

Easy and very tasty -- I used a little more butter and alot more garlic, and needed much less bread crumbs.  I also crumbled the fried onions, so they would stick better.  Definitely a keeper!

I used half of the crumb mixture and only 4 breast halves. I still used the same amout of butter mixture, it was good but we would all like more garlic flavor! Next time I'll double or maybe triple the garlic!

Wonderful!  I would change nothing in this recipe.  I read some reviews that talked about too much breading left over.  You can obviously half the breading, or:  Coat more chicken and freeze the portion you won't be eating that night, or put half the breading in a freezer bag before dipping chicken and freeze it for another time.

I made it for my 16 yo niece who loved it. so unbelievably juicy and tastes like heaven. because there were only 3 of us, I just made it with 2 chicken breasts and cut them in half but used the entire bread crumbs and sauce.... SO YUMMY!!!!!!! look forward to cooking it again.

I love the idea of dipping chicken in garlic butter and breading before baking.   I used a brush to apply the garlic butter to all sides of 4 bone in split chicken breasts.   I baked for 50 minutes, because the chicken was large. I would add some black pepper to the breading next time.  Served with Stovetop Green Beans from this site, which is supposed to be an alternative to green bean casserole, the French fried onions in this recipe goes well and the whole meal together evokes green bean casserole flavors.

I have made this several times.  My husband loves it.  I am not a lover of breaded food but this is good.  Easy to make.  I used regular mustard instead of powder since this is what I had on hand.  I also have used spicy brown mustard with equally good results.

The ingredients sounded good but this is soggy with no flavor.  Family wouldn't eat it.  And way too many bread crumbs.

Very good.  My family loved it.  Next time I will will try baking on a cookie sheet, with a rack to lift it up, so the bottom will be crispier.

This dish was wonderful!!! Hubby devoured two pieces of chicken! Made a couple of changes to the recipe..instead of parmesan cheese, I used grated cheddar cheese b/c that's all I had. I omitted the french onions b/c I didn't have them and I completely forgot to add the mustard, which I had intended to add but I managed to forget it.  Even with my changes and my forgetfulness this dish came out great!  This will be on regular rotation and hopefully next time I can remember to add the mustard and pick up some parmesan cheese at the store :-)

This was quite yummy and my boyfriend loved it!  I did add extra garlic after reading several reviews (and I love the flavor anyway).  I used chicken tenderloins which took much less time to cook but didn't get as brown as I would've liked.  Otherwise, I thought the recipe had great flavor.

Family loved it.  It did make way too much bread crumbs.  I would cut that in half or reduce it by 1/4.  I didn't have dry mustard, so I put dijon mustard in the butter instead.  My husband can't stop talking about this dish.  He said it is the best dinner we had in a long time.

Very delicious! Easy to make, and most ingredients I already had on hand. I used 2 boneless breasts and approx. halved the bread crumb mixture and cooked 35 minutes. I will add this to my chicken repertoire!

Very tasty, the coating got a bit soggy so I might try to bake on a rack next time. The only thing I would add is that I used a pastry blender to combine the bread crumb mixture so that the onions were smaller and more uniform in size.

I'm not usually a fan of baked chicken that has breading (as opposed to frying) but this was excellent.  I think maybe the worchestire is the secret.  I cut chicken breasts into strips and make chicken tenders with a big salad and my family loves it.  and believe it or not, but this chicken tastes even better cold the next day...yummy leftovers! thanks for the great recipe!

I have been using recipes from this site for years, but, this one is the one that made me write my first review!!!  It is so unbelievably easy to modify, and still turns out YUMMY!  I used oatmeal (quick oats) instead of bread crumbs, and did not have any mustard powder on hand, so I used a bit of deli mustard in the garlic/butter mixture.  Added some poultry seasoning and black pepper to the dry ingredients, and I also used boneless chicken breasts!  Oh MY MY!  This is a keeper for sure!!!!

Kids liked it, hubby said yuck.  I thought it was mushy but tasted ok.  I wonder if it was mushy because I used the rest of the breading/onion mix... which there was way too much of...

This is a very flavorful way to wake up boring baked chicken. It has a wonderful garlicy taste that goes very well with the french fried onions and bit of mustard powder. I followed the recipe exactly and was not disappointed! My four children gobbled it up and declared it, "mom's best chicken EVAH!"

I was impressed with this!  I used store bought bread crumbs and reduced the amount per the reviews. I still had plenty!  I put the rest of the crumbs on the bottom and the top of the chicken. I used boneless breasts and bumped up the temp to 375 for 30 minutes. Check the chicken after 20 minutes.

I halved the recipe because I didn't need 8 servings and I omitted the mustard powder because I didn't have any.  I used about twice as much garlic and I also probably used more fried onions than the halved recipe called for.  This was by far the best chicken I have ever made.  It was juicy and very flavorful.  This one is a definite keeper!

This recipe was pretty good. It smelled AWESOME cooking!! It was a little soggy on the bottom but it still turned out really good. All the family seemed to like it and even reheated it the next day. So thanks for a new chicken recipe!!

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breast as that's our favorite.  I used Panko bread crumbs instead of regular as they're my breading of choice.  I did make a bit too many and so the next day I made chicken salad and it was SO good on toasted homemade bread.  All in all, it's a keeper here because any dish that can serve for two meals works for me!  Thanks for sharing!

We loved this recipe. I used boneless chicken, and the cook time was about 30 minutes. I could see making a little bit extra of the butter mixture to drizzle on top. Crushing the french fried onions was also a good option as well to get them to stick better. I serve this with hot pepper cheese mac and cheese and it went great together!

I always ask my boyfriend for constructive criticism when I make a new recipe.  This time he said, "It's good!!"  The french fried onions are the best part!

The flavor was great; however, too much bread crumbs for the amount of chicken. I had a ton leftover.

I agree with everyone else, that there was way too much breading, but better too much than too little.  It tasted delicious and my whole family loved it.

The ingredients sounded diffent,and delicious,But
the cooking time needs to be extended and I found the taste to be boring,also the skin was very soft,there is a simplier way to cook chicken like this,...just baste butter mixed with garlic and pepper and put it on the chicken for about 45- 50 min.I will not be using this recipe again.

Great recipe, moist chicken and great garlic flavor.  I cooked in 350 degree convection oven, 1/4 cup crumbs and parmesan are enought for two breasts.  Easy company dish, I will cook this one again.

This smelled wonderful while cooking, but I was expecting a more robust flavor that it just didn't have. Also, for bone in chicken breast I had to cook it longer then the recommended time.
This does make a lot of breading mixture - cutting it in half I still had some left over.
I'll make it again and probably spice up the coating some.

This recipe was excellent.  I too had way too much breading after cutting it down.  Next time I will freeze half before rolling the chicken in it.  This was easy and the chicken was moist and delicious.  My boyfriend raved about it!

I loved this dish -- I made fresh bread crumbs with regular sandwich bread in a food processor instead of using dried. The fresh crumbs pick up the flavors really well.

This recipe was great. I wanted to cook dinner for my brother-in-laws birthday so I found this site and printed out this recipe. I don't cook very often, but I found this recipe easy make and really quick to whip up. Everyone loved it. I did end up with alot of breading leftover. I think next time I'll cut the breading mix in half.

This recipe was pretty good but I found that the amount of bread crumb mixture stuff the recipe calls for is more than needed.. because you end up getting a lot of leftover.. but it tasted really good.. a variation: add some italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture

This is the first recipe we tried finding this webpage this week, and this was delicious!! We already had all the ingredients in our cupboard (except for the mustard stuff) and my husband whipped it up in the time it took me to put our 5 yr. old to bed!!!! Add a glass of merlot and some homemade foccacia bread......VIOLA!!!! Delicioso!! Thank you Jennifer!!!
P.S. and by the way, we have a new baby named Jennifer.........
Sincerely,
Lauren

I was looking for something new to do with chicken and I loved this! The chicken came out so moist and delicious. The french fried onions were a great touch.  I served it with broccoli and it was a hit!

Awesome recipe!  The only change we made to it is that we first pounded the chicken - turned out sooo moist!!!!!

this turned out very good.  i had a lot of mix leftover.  i also marinated the chicken in rum, so it had a rummy taste.  it was very yummy!!!!!
