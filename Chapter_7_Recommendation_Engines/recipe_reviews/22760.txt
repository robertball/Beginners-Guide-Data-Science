As many others, I increased the flavor with the butter, onion, garlic and pepper. I used half and half for less calories and thickened the sauce with a little flour. (I also used a whole wheat pasta.) Easy recipe! Husband gave it a thumbs up!

Made this for the family.  It was a big hit.  As other reivews suggested, I sauteed garlic in butter with chicken and mushrooms.  I also added extra heavy whipping creas and it turned out perfect (I used 2 cups instead of 1 1/2 cups).  Family requested that I fix this again.

Just made this for the first time and it was wonderful but I added 5 cloves of FRESH crushed garlic and increased the cream to 2 cups. I also added about 1 teaspoon of basil for a little color & flvor and will add fresh broccoli the next time. The sauce WILL thicken - just give it TIME!  It is worth the wait!

This was very good!  I did make a few changes; I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream to make it a bit lower in fat, and put about a teaspoon of corn starch to make it thick.  I cut out the butter and used spray instead, and I also sauteed the mushrooms separately in a touch of white wine for some flavor ant it turned out really well!  I will definitely make this again!

This was SO good!!! Very rich and creamy. The only changes I made were to increase the cream to 2 1/2 cups and I added 2 cloves of fresh crushed garlic to the chicken mixture. Also, I new the sauce would thicken but it does as it reduces so I used about 1 tsp. of corn starch mixed in a little water, then added to the sauce. It thicken up real fast without reducing too much! This was so good, better than restaurant fettuccine! I was very impressed considering how easy it was! This is a keeper!!

I made this for dinner last night and my family loved it. I could tell by looking at the recipe that it might be bland (that is why only 4 stars), so I sautee'd onion and garlic in the butter before I added the chicken and mushroom.. awesome

This recipe is great! I did add garlic and onions to the recipe. To change it up a little bit I added some shrimp as well! It was a huge hit at my dinner party, everyone asked for the recipe.

OUTSTANDING! Like everyone else, I added freshly minced garlic and some chopped onion, and then I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and this recipes was smash hit! Will definitely be making it again and again (well, for special occasions; it is high in fat, after all).

I added onions and garlic to the pan with olive oil and a little tarragon.  The dish was good but I think it needs something to "thicken" the sauce better.  I used half and half and it curdled a little.  Next time, I'm going to add some chicken broth to pan and a little flour/butter mixture before the cream and see if that makes a difference.

Excellent!! The whole family devoured this!  I did add some minced onion and garlic like other reviewers said, and I also added just a pinch of nutmeg with the cream. Simple, fast, and divine....doesn't get much better than that!

Very good recipe. It tastes very simple without being bland, and gets rave reviews whenever I make it. I add a handful of onion to saute with the garlic, and it gives it a nice sweet flavor. I also use the whole pint of heavy whipping cream. I don't think there would be enough sauce without it. Add broccoli, artichoke, sun-dried tomatoes, or your other favorite vegetables for wonderful variations!

This is very similar to a recipe i fell in love with last year, but lost.  On its own this is a very good low-carb recipe, just substitute the fettuccine noodles for something else like shirataki noodles or spaghetti squash!

this was so good, family loved it and i couldnt stop eating it. Didnt have mushrooms, used fresh garlic and onions. Exceptional with sauteed broccoli.
Better than my other fettuccine recipes.

I did make some adjustments, more because of what I had on hand. I used penne pasta, added 3 minced garlic to the chicken and mushrooms while cooking and added halved grape tomatoes and sauteed pea pods before adding the 2% milk (which I substituted for the cream - and I used just 3/4 cup milk). Yummy!

This recipe has become one of my husband's favorites.  It is a really great recipe, however, I did make a couple of changes.  First, I doubled the sauce.  It takes a LONG time to thicken properly, so you have to be patient and continually stir it.  I would definitely recommend using a non-stick pan, otherwise, you could have some problems.  Also, instead of mushrooms, we used broccoli.  I steamed it for about 10-12 minutes first and then folded it in after the sauce had thickened and I had added the parmesan.  Finally, instead of fettuccine noodles, I used no yolks egg noodles.  It was all I had on hand, but it worked out wonderfully.  This is an excellent recipe and even my children, who are very picky, enjoyed it.

I think this is a delicious recipe, however I  did treak it alot,so I'm only giving it a 4* -- first of all do not use cornstarch to thicken sauce--add more parmasan cheese and it will thicken naturally. I used about 3/4 to 1 cup grated fresh parmansan(only use the fresh stuff) and it will thicken.I used half & half creamer >>almost 2 cups-- fresh minced garlic>> about 5 cloves- I used a chopped shallot(about 1 Tabl)--  I added 1/2 t. of red pepper flakes - pinch of basil, rosemaryand white pepper --it was a perfect dish and I will make again. I found it fairly easy to assemble,as I msot always have these ingredients on hand.thanks for sharing  your  recipe.

Wow!  My 20-yr old son hugged me and told me that he loved me when I made this for him!!  What more can I say?   The only thing I did differently was add sauteed garlic before adding the chicken.  Thank you Tory!!

This recipe was sooo good! I sautee'd some onions and garlic (like someone suggested earlier) and I also put a little garlic salt and pepper on the meat before cooking it. It was delicious! But next time I'll definitely make more sauce.

This was really good and very easy.  I used salt, pepper and 1/2 tsp Old Bay on the chicken while sautéing.  Other reviews thought it was bland but it tasted terrific with the addition of the Old Bay.  My only negative about this recipe is that it was not going to feed the four people in my family.  The next time I will double the pasta and the sauce.

This is a great, tasty and quick recipe. The second time I made it I added diced bacon and asparagus cut  into 1 inch pieces. fry the bacon, mushroom and asparagus separately in 1 tblsp of garlic butter. mix it in with the chicken just before adding the cream.

This recipe is awesome. I used half and half instead of the cream and it was perfect. I also cooked the chicken and mushrooms in garlic like most of the reviewers. I never knew chicken fettuccine could be so easy.

This was really tasty.  I added spices after reading some reviews and a little bit of corn starch.  It still was not very thick  (after 25 min cooking) until it sat awhile afterwards.  Also, it would have been helpful if Torrerizor had added cooking temperatures.  I suspect they are a very good cook and never thought of it.

This was absolutely delicious! I made a rue with equal parts of butter and flour then added half and half. I then added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup fresh parmesan. My whole family loved it. There were no leftovers!

Great recipe! I'm not a cook and this was easy for me! We also substituted the heavy cream for half-and-half and we added a tablespoon of flour to thicken it up (although in hindsight that may have been too much after added the parmesan). Turned out great!

I agree with the others.  I thought, midway through the stirring, that the sauce was going to be way too runny.  It reminded me of my LOW-CARB recipes minus the pasta, of course.  I believe you could make this and serve over steamed/mashed cauliflower and it would be a great low carb meal! My husband & I loved it. We wouldn't know how it tastes as leftovers-there were none. Yum!! Thanks for this one.  It's a keeper!

This came out tasting very good.  I added some extra garlic, but I do that to everything.  I did have some trouble with the sauce thickening, I finally had to add some flour.  But it came out really well. Doesn't reheat too well tho, the sauce kinda seperates the next day, but still tastes pretty good.

YUMMY!!! We are big fans of cream based pasta sauces, but they are usually a fuss for me to make. This recipe was wonderful and the sauce was easy to prepare. I did add italian seasoning and minced garlic to the pan. I also squeezed fresh lemon juice on top of our individual dishes to add some zest. This was indeed good.

I just made this recipe and it was delicious!!!  I doubled it for the 6 of us, used whole wheat pasta, canned chicken, and added lots of fresh veggies from the garden (red/green peppers, broccoli) and canned mushrooms (all I had).  We all rated it a 12 on a scale of 1-10!!  Next time I will add green onions &/or fresh garlic, for a variation. If I'd used fresh chicken and mushrooms, it would have been even better, I'm sure (if that's possible).  Definitely will serve for company - it's SO eash!  Thanks again, Allrecipes!!

This was a big hit at my house. My husband says he hates white sauce and came back for seconds! I did make more sauce by using more cheese and heavy whipping cream. I also added in more italian seasoning, some garlic powder, and put in some ground red pepper for kick. I will definitely make it again.

WOW!  This is a great recipe.  We had most of the ingredients except heavy cream so used evaporated milk with excellent results.  We tweaked the spices to our personal tastes.  What impressed us the most was how easy it was to create such an elegant main dish.  Thank you sharing.

I only made a few changes to the recipe.  I used a little salt on the chicken.  I also used a tbsp of corn starch to help thicken the sauce.  Like other users I used fresh garlic instead of powder. I used penne pasta since my family prefers it to fettuccine.  The taste of the dish was superb but it did lack a little in presentation.  I added a dash of paprika to the prepared dish for color.  Next time I may add some broccoli and red pepper.

Personally I thought that the amount of cream used for this recipe choked out the parmesan flavor. So I would add more parmesan. Sauce should be enough if you do use 8 oz. of pasta, but remember that is only half a box. Also I think that's kind of a lot of chicken, maybe use 2 small halves. Anyway, this was good but not great, I would modify it a bit to emphasize the parmesan and garlic. (Also note that it will take a little while for the cream to thicken, so be patient).

This was delicious, I did double the ingredients for the sauce as I wanted plenty and I added 1/2 cup of diced onions and a few gloves of chopped fresh garlic after the chicken and mushrooms were almost done cooking. My husband loved it and so did my guest. Easy to make and will be making this again! gammy

I thought it was really good.  i did take another person's suggestion and added a little onion and extra garlic.  However next time I will add extra cream for there was not enought to go around.

Mmmm, this is restaurant quality chicken fettucine alfredo. Actually, it's much better than some alfredo I've had at restaurants. Although my husband and I really enjoyed it, we put it on our list of things to eat only once a year. I've always known how fattening it is, but to make it yourself - whew!

I made this for a dinner party and it came out great!  I used 3T of butter instead of 2T.  I also thought the sauce would not thicken, and was about to get out some corn starch to make it thicker, but it ended up thickening and was perfect!  It was the first time I've ever made alfredo.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I originally reviewed this three years ago.... and I just wanted to say that three years later (and one more child later), this recipe is STILL a staple in our household! My kids and hubby ask for it at least once a week.  We love, love, love this recipe and will be making it for years to come.  We didn't change a thing, it's nice and simple and delicious the way it is!

Yummy!  I was worried while I was cooking that the sauce wasn't ever going to reach it's desired consistancy, but it did get somewhat thicker, and then after adding the cheese and removing it from the heat, it was perfect.  This has definitely become a favorite because it's so easy and tasty!

I went with some of the other reviews and used a little white wine in the chicken/mushroom saute, chopped onions and a little minced garlic.  Used half/half instead of heavy cream because I already had some.  The chicken came out tender and juicy.  Also added some chopped Italian parsley when mixing in the cheese, and a little on top for garnish color.  It was really good.  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious! As suggested, I sauteed fresh garlic with the chicken and mushrooms. I also used light cream instead of heavy cream. I LOVED it!! I'll definitely be making this again.

Made this for dinner the other night. I altered the recipe though. I feel bad rating it, but I did use it as a base recipe. I didn’t have any heavy cream on hand (never do) so I made my own using milk & butter. I ended up adding 2 sticks (yes 2 sticks!!) of butter total because I love it buttery. I added a lot of garlic salt to the chicken as it cooked in the frying pan & added more to the heavy cream mixture. Added some lemon pepper too. Very unhealthy but very good! Especially as leftovers! I was trying to make this chicken fettuccine from a restaurant that doesn’t make it anymore.

This is a really good recipe. I used Farfalle pasta and I added a lot more seasoning than what was listed on the recipe. The heavy cream WILL THICKEN. It just takes time. I made this for my boyfriend and he jumped for joy and did the moonwalk!

Added less than 1/8 tsp. of cayenne, white pepper, & nutmeg. Also added 1/4 tsp. minced jarred garlic. In the end I felt there could be more sauce so added about a 1/4 jar of Bertolli alfredo sauce. Served with original Suddenly Salad & polenta with marinara & paramesan.

the flavor was a little bland - next time i will add more garlic and parmesan.  also, used half and half - it might have been better if i had used the cream as suggested in the recipe.

Doubled the recipe. Recipe did not call for it, but I sauteed onion, bell pepper, and garlic with the mushrooms. Added Mexican cheese when melting parmesan. Also, after ingredients were combined I poured into casserole dish, topped with French fried onions, and placed in oven @350 until onions browned. Excellent flavor! Fairly easy prep. 



*I followed this recipe as a guideline, with my own twist. Either way, quite tasty. Great way to use leftover chicken (or turkey). I de-boned a chicken.

I cannot have cows milk anymore in my diet, but I seem to do fine with parmesan cheese. so I sub the butter for ghee and the heavy cream for coconut cream. turned out delicious. 
I however added 1/2 cup parmesan and topped with more cheese.

I gave this 5 stars because it was the most simple, delicious alfredo recipe I have encountered, and it was very successful.  I decided to follow the recipe completely except for adding some fresh crushed garlic instead of garlic salt.  It was so refreshing to see a recipe that called for only Parmesan, since I failed to buy Romano.  I was not disappointed, and it was a real crowd pleaser with my family of 8!

Because this was the first time I made this recipe I followed it pretty closely. Didn't have quite enough heavy cream so topped it off with half/half and it was fine. Used minced garlic, garlic powder, kosher salt/pepper. Used canned mushrooms and worked well. Next time I will make with half/half and thicken with a bit of flour or corn starch. Very easy recipe and everyone loved it. Season to taste; lots of room for improvisation with this one!

Very good.  Add pepper jack cheese (16 oz), plenty of black pepper (to taste) and add or substitute crawfish tail meat for a wonderful culinary twist.  Do not overcook the crawfish as they will become rubbery.  They actually are parboiled before they are peeled, so only need to be heated before serving.  I have had numerous requests for my recipe.

Oh my gosh, this was delicious! I have a picky eater who will reject anything with onion or garlic pieces or specks of pepper, so I sauteed pre-cooked, diced chicken with garlic paste, salt, and white pepper. I doubled the recipe and used 4 cups of cream and approximately 3/4 cup parmesan. Will add a little salt to the cream as it reduces next time.

This is my go-to recipe for alfredo.  I love that I don't have to do any thickening. First of all, I season my chicken well.  I use a chicken seasonal, garlic granules, pepper and a little chili powder.  I love to have the chicken seasoned BEFORE I use it in there sauce.  I take the chicken out after just a few minutes of pan-frying so that it does not dry out and cover it (so it continues to cook just a little).  Then I add the garlic and fry just a few minutes.  (As others have  stated, I do use garlic) Then I use about 1/2 cup of Romano instead of the Parmesan. It's a more pungent cheese and our family loves it.  Also, I sometimes garnish with Asiago cheese as well.  If it gets too thick,  just add a little milk  Thank you for putting it on all recipes!!

Followed the recipe except omitted the mushrooms. The sauce was very creamy and cheesy. Very easy to make and everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Double the sauce. It seems saucy at first but dries out. Husband said it could use more flavor.

Made a few alterations (doubled sauce, added 2 cloves of garlic, some chopped red onion, Italian seasoning, dried oregano, a touch of ground sea salt, and some ground black pepper), but used the rest of recipe for primary use. Really good. It just needed more herbs and definitely fresh garlic.

I made this for my daughter and she  absolutely loved it.  She loves Chicken Fettuccine and said mine tasted just like Friday"s version.  I followed the recipe but I blackened my chicken.. This was super easy to make and I will definitely make it again.

I have no idea what went wrong with this dish, but I followed it to the letter, and everything was looking wonderful up until the very last moment when I added the grated Parmesan to the chicken, mushrooms, whipping cream and butter mixture. The very instant that I poured the Parmesan on, the entire consistency of the mixture thinned out, and became an oily mess! Heartbreaking, as I was literally minutes away from serving the dish to my family! I do wonder if my decision to use a natural grated Parmesan containing no added cellulose made a difference, since I've never used it before, so I wonder. Any suggestions?

My 16 year old grandson made this recipe for dinner tonight. He added 2 ounces of Philadelphia cream cheese,  1/4 cup Parmesan cheese with 1/4 cup Romano cheese and split the heavy cream with half and half. He used a clove of fresh crushed garlic instead of garlic salt, and He used fresh fettuccine noodles then garnished with a few chopped green onions. This was a fantastic recipe and he did an outstanding job making it. Yummy! Will definitely use this recipe again.

Great Recipe! I made a few small changes. I used two cloves real garlic, and substituted half & half with some corn starch to the sauce as other reviewers suggested. I also separately cooked fresh fettuccine and added fresh cut up  broccoli to to the pasta while it was cooking. Great results!

I would definitely make it again. As previous posts mentioned, I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken. I remedied this by going with 2 cups of heavy cream and a half cup of flour

Delicious! I will never buy alfredo sauce from a jar again! I will make my own each time. I did add 2 cups of parmesan cheese as I love cheese. Added broccoli since I'm not a fan of mushrooms and it was great. Next time I will definitely make more alfredo sauce since I like my chicken fettuccini to be more on the creamy side. It tasted better than from a restaurant. Maybe I'll add tomatoes or bay leaves next time to spice it up. My Mom loved it. You must try!

First time trying this receipe.....it was simple, however, I only had "light cream" and it didn't seem to thicken much so added , a bit of flour and water.....also added green pepper strips to mushrooms and chicken and of course "summer savoury".   It was great and I will definitely make it again but may add more veggies, e.g. red pepper, diced carrots maybe?

I made this for lunch today and it was great!!! Loved it. I just changed a few things though. I used one clove of fresh garlic, cherry tomatoes, capsicum and onion instead of mushroom. I also added cheddar cheese along with Parmesan. Will certainly make this again.

I liked this recipe, in general.  Gave jt three stars because it's easy to make.  It's not super great but 2 of the three kids ate it,  which is good and means I'll make it again.  Would double the sauce next time and add more butter because it got absorbed rather quickly while sautéing.  Also would leave out the mushrooms since the baby portabellos that I used turned the sauce an unappetizing color.

Great as is, or use a little Garlic for a welcome addition. Otherwise, don't change a thing. Patience is a virtue; if you allow the proper time to cook, the sauce will thicken perfectly.

Also, you CAN use pre-cooked, grilled chicken slices and cook them into the sauce. It doesn't affect the recipe at all, it just speeds up the process a bit.

This was really similar to how I make my fettuccini. I only added a dash of pepper because i'm not a huge pepper fan. I also like to add a bit of romano cheese along with everything else so had to increase the cream a bit as well. Just eyeballed it though. One of my daughters favorite meals and its sooo easy to make.

Loved it! It's so delicious and what i mostly love about is that it's not heavy because usually I feel too stuffed everytime I eat it at a restaurant

Our 12 year old daughter love Fettuccine with shrimp. I made this recipe, as it is, with chicken and she loved it!
She wants me to make this again so, if you knew how picky my daughter was, you would know how great she thought this was too!

Great dish and easy to make.  I added chicken right into the noodle mixture.  I didn't have fettuccine so I used penne. I also added fresh garlic, broccoli and extra cheese.

I am giving the recipe a 4 because I had to add ingredients for flavor. I added 5 garlic cloves and the garlic powder, Basil and fresh broccoli. I also added 1tsp Corn starch to thicken the sauce, I mixed it with the cold whipping cream before adding it to the pan. With these modification the Recipe came out amazing and I don't even like Fettuccine, but I devoured it!

It was really good but not the best.  Added onion garlic, and basil to give it some taste.  But other then that everything turned out the way it was supposed too.  Of course our heavy cream came from the dairy and was not store bought just like all of our dairy products and the chicken came fresh from the butcher just like all of our meats.

Fast, easy and delicious!  Who could ask for more?  We skipped the chicken to make it a meatless meal, added a  sprinkle of nutmeg and parsley (personal preference), small green salad, crusty bread and a glass of wine.  This was a  perfect meal, especially because there are leftovers for lunch!!

I set this recipe out to cook but was busy doing "Mom" things and my husband made it.  Fabulous.  The recipe was so creamy!!  He used fresh garlic with the butter and it was delicious!  Better than any I've had at restaurants!  Definitely a keeper.

Tasty! I'd definitely make this again. I even left out the parmesan cheese b/c I was too lazy to grate any, but still it was delicious!
I also took people's opinion and cooked some chopped onions w/ the mushroom and chicken at first. Didn't regret it :)

I also used fresh garlic, and I forgot to take the chicken out of the freezer so I used broccoli instead.  After I sauteed the veggies, I did add some flour.  I also only had about 1/2 cup heavy cream, so I also added about a cup of milk.  This was so good and creamy!
The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of my alterations, otherwise I'd give it a 5!!

This was not my favorite alfredo recipe.

It's not that it's bad, it's just that i've had other alfredo dishes that were much better.  It's very edible and the chicken does have a good flavor.

I didn't like how thick the sauce turned out, but i think i cooked it a bit too long.  The sauce will continue to thicken after you shut off the heat and i forgot that.  It made the finished product very dry and goopy, rather than creamy with not enough sauce to go around, even though i increased the cream to 2 cups.

Hubby didn't like the mushrooms, but i thought they had a good flavor.

I probably won't make this again.

I modified it just a bit.  I used a cut up rotisserie chicken and tossed it in at the end.  I used half and half instead of the whipping cream.  It didn't quite thicken up the way I would have liked it.  If I made it again, I would use the whipping cream and add fresh garlic with the mushrooms instead of the garlic salt.  It was just OK.

Just finished cooking and serving this for lunch for 8 high school girls.  They loved it and finished almost everything.  Could have used more Fettuccine.  One box, pound, was very close to being not enough. I did use 8 breasts and about 31/2 cups cream.  Glad I did.

I really thought this turned out great. It took a while for the sauce to thicken up, but it ended up being just the right consistency. My only change would be to use fresh parmesan instead of dried - mine stayed kind of grainy. I ended up adding too much parmesan, too, so I will try to cut back next time.

Simple and tasty recipe! I sauteed onion and garlic before adding the chicken...turned out great and nothing was left over. The sauce was a little thin, but I like it that way!

very tasty, not out of this world, but very nice, quick and easy.
I put the noodles right in the dish with the chicken after draining and it worked out nicely.

I thought this turned out fantastic. The thick creamy sauce was excellent. I'm sure there are alot of variations that could be used but my family and I loved it just the way it is.

I was very disappointed with this sauce.  It looked very unappetizing because the cream (half & half) curdled and was watery.  The flavour of the chicken was OK but only because I sauteed an onion and garlic with it as suggested by others. We couldn't taste the parmesan even though I used 1/3 cup instead of 1/4. I won't be making again.

I had always stayed away from white sauces.  Never again.  This recipe was easy to make and great tasting.  The only substitution was a 6 cheese italian blend rathewr than parmesan only and it was stiill wonderful.
