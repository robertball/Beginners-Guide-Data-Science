Even though it may have been unwarranted, I was uncomfortable with cooking down and using the same marinade I had marinated the chicken in.  I know, restaurants do it all the time – but just to be on the safe side I made a separate batch of the marinade to finish the sauce and crisp up the sage.  I also used bone-in chicken breasts rather than turkey breasts.  The sage contributed incredible, herby flavor and the chicken turned out moist and tender with a beautiful rich color.  As long as sage is plentiful in my wife’s garden, this is sure to make a repeat performance.

Easy and very flavorful. I added more garlic, thyme and a tad less sage. Cooked at twmp between 250 and 300 slowly. Juicy and delicious. My internal temp was 153. Perfect and JUICY

I made the recipe with chicken breasts and served over a thin bed of rice which absorbed the flavor.  Crispy sage leaves added great texture.  I have added it to my favorites

Delicious. The turkey breast was so tender.  I did not fry the sage leave, but didn't miss it.  Served it on a fresh salad..
