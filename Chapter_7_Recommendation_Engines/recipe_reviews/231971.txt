You have to be VERY carful with the heat. It takes forever for the inside of the pancake to cook. I tried making them small and big to see which one works best but for someone who is somewhat new to making pancakes, this is not a good recipe to start off with.

The taste of these was really nice.  Warning - watch the heat of your griddle - I usually use a 1/4 cup measure for pancakes and did so with these but the bottom tries to burn before the top is set which makes flipping them rather messy.  After a couple of disasters I started making smaller pancakes, about the size of a silver dollar and that worked much better.  I think it is the natural sugar from the apples that causes the quick browning - the smaller size really helped the top to set and make it easier to flip them.

these were great and pretty easy (if not a bit time consuming) for a novice like myself, however the amount of salt seemed quite high so i cut it in half. STILL WAY TOO SALTY! i will definitely try these again but just a pinch of salt is enough a quarter tsp at the most! also i topped with the sauteed apples recipe also found on this site, amazing! my whole family loved them!

This thin batter is more of a Swedish pancake and should be very thin.  We loved this recipe.

It looked interesting to use whole apples but the batter is about as thick as water. They don't cook all the way through and burn on the outside. Very frustrating. Would NOT recommend

Very good! Made these with the Apple cinnamon syrup recipe on here, cooked exactly to what the recipe said, I used ~1/4 cup per pancake and I got 17 pancakes out of it.

Even keeping the other rater's comments in mind and turning my griddle on low. They simply wouldn't cook. So I eventually turned my griddle up to about 250-300. Still wouldn't cook after 10-15 minutes. Finally the outsides got brown and I prepared to serve them. The insides we're still mush and they didn't taste good either.

I didn't have any issues with cooking these. I used my good nonstick skillet, medium heat on my gas stove, and waited until bubbles appeared in the batter to flip them; just like I always have done with pancakes. Hope that helps anyone made nervous by the reviews citing issues with cooking these. My daughter loves apple pie, apple crisp, and now apple cinnamon pancakes.

I’ll admit I didn’t try the original recipe first. I read reviews and went with majority. I do regret using the blender for the whole process tho. Next time I’ll use my food processor for the apples and then add all ingredients to my stand mixer bowl. I used 1.5 cups flour, 1 cup milk, 1 large Fuji apple, 2.5 tsp baking powder, 1/4tsp salt, 1.5tsp cinnamon, 5.6TBS melted butter, 2 eggs. Flavor is on point. Trying a lower temp on the griddle for the second batch so the middle cooks. Will definitely play with the basic recipe to find my own.

Instead of shortening, I used 1 small mashed banana and 1/4 cup avocado oil. I only used 1 cup 2% milk and added 1 Tbsp brown sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon. I sprinkled some with more cinnamon when making them and to others I pushed a few blueberries into them. I made them small in size and they cooked beautifully!

They turned out OK not quite as brown sugary as I was hoping e I should’ve sprinkled brown sugar on top after flipping them once which I’ll do next time but thanks to the warning about the heat I had it medium high then turned it down to just over medium did small ones & they cooked beautifully

Five stars WITH several modifications

Wow - these were some of the best pancakes I have ever eaten. Thank you for all of the reviews that were left that helped me modify this recipe. After reading the reviews I made many changes to the recipe:
1. I used only one apple instead of 2 
2. I used 1 cup of milk instead of 1.5
3. I used .25 tsp salt instead of 1 tsp
4. I added an additional 1/8 cup of flour
5. I added 2 T granulated sugar
6. I used 1.5 tsp cinnamon instead of 1 tsp
7. Finally, I added .25 tsp of nutmeg.
Using the blender is genius. Even with all of the modification I made, the batter was still quite thin. I cooked on low heat instead of medium and they cooked up beautifully.

Very Good! Using the blender is a great idea. Followed the same idea using frozen mango (1 cup) and one banana. This recipe is not a sweet pancake FYI but perfect with maple syrup.

We loved it and will definitely make it again but may have to make changes next time. If apples are large, use a little more flour and baking powder, less butter.  I don't keep shortening on hand.  Made as directed batter was a little thin but I think it was my huge apples!  We had them for dinner.  Thank you for this recipe.

I follow this recipe is exactly as stated, and they turned out great the only thing I changed was our used walnut milk instead of regular milk, I switch this to only two servings but it still made like 10 pancakes is very generous portions. great recipe I can't wait to make it again
