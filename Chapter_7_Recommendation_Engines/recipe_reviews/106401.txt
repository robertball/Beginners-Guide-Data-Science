alright, so i changed the recipie quite a bit simply because i didnt have a lot of the stuff but what i ended up with were the best cookies ive ever had. ever.

i recommend not using the oats, but crushed grahm crackers.
i didnt have raisins. or apple juice concentrate.
i just used apple sauce and a TON of apple pieces.
also, skip the molasses.
i honestly dont even know what molasses is.

The flavors were nice, but very mild.  I didn’t care for the texture; it’s a cross between a cookie and a muffin.  I like cookies and I like muffins, but meeting half-way wasn’t good for me.

I really liked these.  They were soft and moist and had a great texture.  They were not too sweet, but the apples and raisins created the perfect flavor.

These are pretty good.  It has some flavor, but is still a little flat tasting.

Didn't care for this one, cookie was too bland and the fruit bits (apple, raisin, etc) too strong.  Felt like eating a bland salad in small, round, bite-sized form.
