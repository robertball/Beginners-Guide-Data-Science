I liked this recipe, but wished the directions were clearer. I started to make it from beginning to end and had mixed the lemon juice with cornstarch already when I realized that part of the recipe was for the syrup. I wasn't intending to make the syrup, as I already have blueberry syrup in my cupboard, so it was a waste of a couple of ingredients.  Perhaps whomever posted this recipe could separate the pancake recipe from the syrup recipe just to make it clear.  Thanks.

I loved it my husband only liked it. I didn't have any problem making them. I recommend you read the recipe completely before making or you could have a problem. I made them according to the recipe and made the blueberry syrup also. I would give it 5 stars but the recipe could be written a little better with the syrup ingredients seperate and I must mention they are not the normal pancake they are different. But I was looking for different and I loved them.

Be patient, it takes a little longer to cook than a regular pancake but well worth the wait.  I served with a lemon curd and warm strawberry compote on top - YUMMO!

Someone made these pancakes for me but they used ready to go pancake mix. And that's what I was looking for. I just needed to know how much Riccotta to put in. Also they used 1/2 spoon of vanilla extract. Delish fancy pancakes to break out of the norm.

We loved how light, fluffy and creamy these pancakes were. I made a few alterations to accomodate my husband's diabetes. I substituted baking stevia in place of sugar and served with sugar-free raspberry preserves and clarified butter. Did not leave us feeling overly stuffed, but comfortably satisfied. 5 stars for flavor, but I would only give it 3 stars for the instructions. The ingredient lists and instructions should be separate for sauce and pancakes.

I fell in love with lemon ricotta pancakes at Cheesecake Factory restaurant. So glad I can now make them when ever I want!!  I added chocolate chips to mine and my daughter couldn't stop eating them.

7.16.16   I posted a review and photo on this recipe on 10.12.14.  The photo's still here, but the review is gone??  Don't remember exactly what I said, but I can say that it turned out delicious and has been made a number of times since.  The ricotta and lemon really are key ingredients, so don't leave them out.  The blueberry sauce takes them over the top with a lovely presentation, and it's so very simple to make..

The directions can be a bit confusing but the recipe itself is easy and delicious. They truly are ligher and less filling. I have made hear pancakes many times now for friends and family.

Fantastic! I made these exactly as written so I could rate it fairly.
I loved the blueberry and lemon flavors together. The pancakes were light and airy. I read all the reviews first, so I didn't just throw it all in a bowl. I think keeping them warm in 150 degree oven finished them off inside. These are not the pancakes from our youth, all sugared up and topped with syrup. I will make these adult pancakes again. Thanks for sharing.

Didn't make the blueberry syrup so that might have been why we didn't like them to much.

Very good. We used baking powder per the ingredient list, not the instructions. Came out fluffy enough. Rich flavors.

10.20.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233914/lemon-ricotta-pancakes-with-blueberry-sauce/ ... Unusual review ahead!  I made another ricotta pancake recipe & the sauce from this one.  That's different, huh?!  :o  I thought the sauce would be blueberry lemonish, but it was just good.  I mean that in a good way, just not as I thought it would be.  I'll try this pancake recipe next time, okay?  ;)

These pancakes are terrific!  However, I felt the sauce was too bitter.  I did use store bought lemon juice, and that might be the reason for that.  I really enjoyed the pancakes with fresh, sliced strawberries on top.

The pancakes had the best texture and flavor.  The blueberry sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the pancakes so I would use the sauce sparingly.

Delicious!  Light, fluffy pancakes with a hint of lemon and a blueberry topping.  Wonderful combination of flavors.  I am not a nutmeg fan so omitted that 1 ingredient.

Great recipe. I love the ricotta pancakes at a pricey restaurant in our area and wanted to be able to make them at home. These aren't very sweet, but that's what I love about them. I invited those at my table who wanted something sweeter to add honey or syrup.  I did add a couple tablespoons of water to bring the berries and sugar to a boil just so the pan would stop popping.

I would eliminate the lemon in the blueberry sauce as it overpowered the blueberry taste.

Had a bit of trouble flipping them but that is mostly my pan. They were great and I will probably make them again next week!
Made them again due to popular demand and no problems with a different pan! They also reheat well either in the toaster or microwave depending on whether you like them crispy or not. One of the kids makes a sandwich out of them using cream cheese as a filling.

Made these for brunch, I only had fresh blueberries, so I just added some water to the saucepan to cook them in, and reduced the sugar, turned out perfect. These were quite lemony, a really nice change from traditional pancakes,

I love the protein boost of the ricotta in these pancakes--it makes pancakes a more acceptable breakfast food!  And they are a really nice texture, too. I also liked the tartness of the low-sugar syrup. I didn't alter the recipe at all.

I actually forgot to add the butter and the vanilla to the recipe.    I like the result much better.  At least for me the lemon comes through when the vanilla is not there.  The pancake comes off the griddle pan crisper  and that goes well with the blueberries.

loved it. light and almost custardy pancakes. took one straight from the pan and thought it was not done. after it set a couple minutes it was perfect. it does take almost twice as long as regular pancakes to cook.  put honey instead of sugar in blueberries.  and I cooked the berries in the microwave. put all sauce ingredients in microwave safe bowl. toss lightly to coat berries in cornstarch.  Cook 5-6 mins, stirring every 2 mins.

These pancakes have a wonderful depth of flavors, are light and fluffy and cook up better than store bought mixes.

My family LOVED these pancakes and the blueberry sauce!!  The  ONLY change that I made to the recipe was adding vanilla to the batter.  They were moist and had wonderful flavor, which was enhanced by the blueberry sauce.  My husband stated that we could never get pancakes this good when eating out!

I made the pancakes and the syrup.  The pancakes were delicious - light and not too sweet.  I replaced the lemon juice with water for the syrup only because I didn't want to use another lemon.  The syrup was delicious  - not too sweet and no taste of cornstarch.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

The recipe is inaccurate. It calls for eggs to be mixed in the directions, but gives no amount of eggs in the ingredients. I looked at other recipes that have almost the same ingredients, and they all suggested 2 eggs. That is what I did. 
I made more sauce by diluting the berries with some combo of orange and lemon juice. It needs no syrup, tho someone called for it. I gave them a dirty look and they THEN tasted it. 
Because of the density of the pancakes I cooked them 2 mins on each side, on med heat. I made them for 3 and still had pancakes left over. It was a very good and simple recipe. I would make it again.

These pancakes were just delicious.  I didn't make the blueberry sauce and just used regular syrup.  Not sure I recommend that, as I think they would go best with fruit.  But the pancakes themselves were wonderful.  Light, fluffy and lemony.  Will definitely make again (with the blueberries next time).

this recipe had great flavor BUT I think it calls for too much ricotta which makes it a bit too gooey or moist inside.  I would suggest using less probably start with half a cup

Made this for Sunday breakfast. My family said it was okay. I really don't get the point of the ricotta. Seemed like a lot of work for simple pancakes.

Delicious!  and Recipe was simple.  Ricotta pancakes were light, lemony, kept their height and not too sweet because I reduced the sugar.  I will use this sauce to top vanilla ice cream too, or make a blueberry smoothie with it.

Deeelicious!  Made it according to directions but left out the nutmeg as to not overpower the lemon.  I used fresh blueberries since they are in season and the sauce elevated it to the 5-star level.

No changes, very good, pancakes were just as recipe described. Next time I may use fresh blue berries and just serve on the side with maybe some creme fraisch, as I think maybe the frozen ones a bit too sweet as prepared

Loved the lemon flavor, but prefer lighter, cake-like pancakes. These were creamy inside-probably undercooked, which is easy to do! Cook on LOW heat, as they burn more easily than traditional pancakes. I used cherries and peaches for the compote

I made it according to the recipe. The first six I made were undercooked (my bad). I left the second six on longer but the centers were still soft. I guess it's the ricotta that makes it that way. I have the griddle at about 275° so they don't burn. Next time I'm going to use less ricotta and more flour. I'll even try another batch with buttermilk

I made this exactly as written, but doubled everything. The instructions are fine. I recommend cooking the pancakes at a heat just a bit lower than you normally would use for a pancake. I allowed my heat to creep up and one batch turned out very dark, and the lemon flavor did not come through. I used a lower heat on all the other batches and the pancakes were light and perfect.  When cold, you can stuff the blueberry spread inside and roll them up like a soft taco....yum!

As listed the recipe gets 3 stars, but leave off the blueberry syrup  and the pancakes themselves with just butter are 5 star. My wife is a blueberry enthusiast, even she found the pancakes to be better without the syrup. The syrup added a little too much lemon and we could taste the corn starch. She actually finished up the syrup and said it was thick enough before adding the cornstarch and lemon. But I am a stickler for following a recipe to a "t" before being comfortable rating it, so she stuck to the recipe. We think leaving the lemon and corn starch out of the syrup would improve it, that is from a woman who would add blueberry to almost anything and a man how thinks lemon ranks up there with God's greatest inventions.

The pancake batter was a bit thick and hard to cook evenly on both sides without one side burning and the middle still runny. The pancakes did have a nice taste. The blueberry sauce was good but does not need the lemon.  A lot of work   Not sure I would make these again.

I  made no changes and for me I had to follow the directions so next time I will know what I need to change but I loved them and I really loved the blueberry sauce but I got say that if you feel like you need to change it up you can mix half blueberries and half strawberries that might be something worth trying but overall it is a great recipe

Very good pancakes. More creamy than fluffy. Blueberry compote was excellent. Will try with other flavors.

Excellent recipe, except that it omitted adding a little water to the blueberries before cooking, which should be common sense, but isn't.  I usually just add some blueberries to maple syrup and heat it up.  It's easier, and now that I've tried both, I like my old system better.  The pancakes were GREAT!

Very easy to make. Instead of the blueberry syrup, I used fresh blueberries on top as well as serving them with plain Greek yogurt, applesauce and maple syrup. Delicious!??

No changes. Light, flavorful and delicious. I made these on vacation for a crowd and they were uniformly lauded. This will be a staple.

I made both the blueberry syrup with fresh berries and the pancakes. Will not make again. The flavor was bland and boringly mild. Regular pancake recipe would have been better. Tried blueberry syrup then real maple syrup made no difference. Was hoping the cheese and lemon would be a winning combination. The extra prep time and expense  was not worth it.

Absolutely wonderful and very easy directions to follow, unlike what other reviewers said.  My whole family went crazy over these and they were such a welcome change from the ordinary.  I didn't change a thing.

My husband and I loved these pancakes.  My husband said he will never eat regular pancakes again.  I used fresh blueberries but didn't change anything else.  I had no problem following the recipe

The blueberry sauce was perfect and i will use it again for a variety of breakfast items. The pancakes were light and yummy but, in the future  I will omit the nutmeg. I thought it overwhelmed the lemon flavor that I was really looking for.

We love lemon and love blueberries, but these pancakes just didn't have the "wow" we had hoped for.  There is something that's just not in harmony between the lemon and the blueberries in the batter for these.  All agreed they would have preferred to have had the lemon left out.  The basic recipe is good and ricotta gives the pancakes a nice lightness,.

The lemon wasn't too overpowering, these were sweet enough when I added a little stevia to the batter that I didn't even have to add syrup to finished pancakes:) my 3 to, best friend & I all loved them, as usual. My husband, not as much.
