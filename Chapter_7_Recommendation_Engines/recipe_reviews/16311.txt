This ended up being awesome, I served it with warm dinner rolls.  I looked around at the other reviews and this is what I did:  I used a full can of Beef Broth, just 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup, 2 full jars of sliced mushrooms (the little glass ones), I added a generous sprinkle of Paprika, A Tablespoon of Worshechire, Half of a small white onion finely chopped, 1 Beef Boullion Cube, I used only 1/2 a cup of Sour Cream, I dropped the garlic powder from a Tablespoon to only a Teaspoon - It needed to simmer about 20 minutes - not ten minutes and then put it over broad egg noodles, It was SOOOOO good. I had to tweak the recipe a lot to get the flavor I wanted though.

This is a great starter recipe. I changed it up a bit, I added fresh garlic , onion, mushrooms, and garlic salt to the ground beef while frying it. Then I added 1 can of beef broth, 1 can of cream of mushroom and one beef boulion cube. I served it over egg noodles with warm rolls and it was delicious.

This recipe was really quick and easy to make, but tasted great...after reading other's suggestions, and catering to my family's taste, these are the modifications I made:
- chop up and onion and throw it in with the beef while it's cooking (next time I will use two for more onion)
- after draining beef, double the mushroom soup, add two cans of slice mushrooms, and add one soup can of milk
- i added about a cup of sour cream, don't worry if people don't like it, my sister hates it, and mixed in with the other ingredients, it tasted great
The extra soup and milk really made a nice sauce so when I served it over egg noodles, everything was coated perfectly.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

YUMMY!  I altered the recipe a bit after looking at the other reviews.  Cook the ground beef and drain off the fat.  To the beef, add 1 cup of water, 2 beef boullion cubes, 1 Tbsp. dried minced onion, 1 Tbsp. Worstershire sauce, 1 tsp. crushd garlic, and a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup. Simmer for 10-20 minutes while cooking the pasta.  Add 1/2 cup of sour cream to the beef and serve it over the cooked pasta.

Been making this for years it is quick & easy what I do different is use a can of cr. of Mushroom & cream of celery, use garlic salt, onion and 2 tablespoons of cooking sherry and a cup or so of sour cream.  I think the sherry gives it that something some are looking for.

This recipe turned out excellent... after I made some changes (as the other reviewers suggested). I added an onion and 1 clove minced garlic to the burger while browning. Then I drained and added 1 "teaspoon" garlic powder and 1 tablespoon black pepper. I added 2 cans cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup water with a beef bouillon dissolved in it. I added 1 cup of sour cream and brought to a boil. I then added 1 tablespoon Worcestershire stirred then turned down and simmered for about 20 minutes while I prepared the egg noodles. When the noodles were done I drained and added the beef mixture in with the noodles. I mixed thoroughly and simmered for about 10 more minutes.(The beef mixture seemed soupy at first until you add it to the noodles.) Be prepared to be impressed!!!

If you saute fresh mushrooms, onion, and garlic (skip the garlic powder) to add, and add some Worcestershire sauce this comes out so much better for not much more work.

My husband and I are in love with this recipe. It's the absolute best comfort food and I love how easy this recipe makes it. I did make a couple changes based on reviews that made it AMAAZING. First, I sautéed 1/2 of an onion and 1 teaspoon of minced garlic for a few minutes. Then I added in the ground beef, browned it, and drained the fat. I added the can of cream of mushroom, 1 cup of beef broth, 1/2 cup of sour cream, and a lot of Worchestire sauce (probably 3 tablespoons). A little salt and pepper and it was done! Next time I may cut back a little on the sour cream, but it was still wonderful! My husband raved about it and ate two bowls. Definitely a go-to!

This dish is tasty, simple, and easy, but I wouldn't say it's a recipe for authentic beef stroganoff. This is more like a Hamburger Helper Beef Stroganoff in taste, appearance, and texture. So if that's what you're looking for, try this recipe, but if you're looking for the real thing, keep looking.

This is a good quick dinner.  I have a better recipe for stroganoff, but some nights I don't have time to mess with it and this is much faster.  I added extra mushrooms, garlic rather than garlic powder, milk to thin it out and a little ketchup to give it color.  My one year old loves this.

I grew up on this recipe and learned it from my mom. Being from the south, we also add onion, bell pepper, celery, (or frozen "Season Blend") with a little "Slap ya Mama Cajun Seasoning". We ate it on cooked rice or toasted bread.

This gets 4 stars for what it is... a simple stick-to-your-ribs meal-especially over mashed potatoes(yes, throw in a veg side). I've been making it for years. Substantial improvement is made by taking the time to brown the meat and onions (some garlic is nice too). If you have real mushrooms it helps as well. I've used cream cheese at times to sub for the sour cream and tomato soup is a nice change for the canned 'cream of whatever' generally used. This is a starter-recipe to be varied with 'what have I got in the cupboards/fridge'. I don't think mine has ever been the same twice, and I can't recall anyone throwing it away. No, it is NOT steak and you wouldn't take it to the company pot-luck, but it is a keeper due to it's ease and flexibility, low-cost, and widespread appeal.ymmv

I too changed this a little bit.  I used a Golden Mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom.. it's a more complex flavored (richer) soup, it too is creamy tho.. but negates the need for beef broth!  I also used the new whipped cream cheese instead of sour cream... and we LOVED it.  I browned 1.5 lbs of beef stew meat (actually chopped up eye of round steaks, much cheaper!), and then threw it all in my crockpot on low for 3 hours... the last 10 minutes I added the cream cheese.. and served over hot egg noodles!  Fantastic....make it all the time!

The taste of the beef was OK, but when added to the noodles, it became extremely bland.  Seems like something should be done to bump of the flavor of the noodles as well.

I made a few changes which really enhanced the flavor!  1) Added chopped garlic, a chopped onion, and fresh sliced mushrooms to the ground beef while cooking 2) Added about a cup of beef broth while simmering 3) Added a nice splash of white wine while simmering.  I also used a whole pound of egg noodles.  Adding the extra liquid stretched the mixture and made plenty to go with all the pasta.

This was great! I modified slightly.  Used 1.5 lbs ground beef, browned and removed from pan.  Added 1/2 cup chopped onion to some olive oil then added 4 oz sliced mushrooms (for me stroganoff needs shrooms) and fried for a few minutes then added 1T pre-minced garlic for 1 min then returned beef to pan.  Added 1 can each cream of mushroom & chicken soup and 1 soup can of water.  Seasoned to taste with a bit of garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.  Simmered for 20-30 min to blend flavors.  Removed from heat and stirred in the sour cream.  Served over egg noodles.  My DH loved it!  Will make again!

Easy to follow however I added worcheshire sauce, minced garlic, and beef broth.  The best part is I had all the ingredients on hand.  With a salad and garlic toast.....done in less than an hour!

I agree with others when they said this was a good base.  Someone else pretty much nailed a great try (in the reviews).  I browned beef with onions, drained then added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, cream of mushroom soup, pepper, 1 tsp beef bouillon, 1 cup sour cream, and enough milk to get desired thickness.  Picky husband , and kids, loved it!  Thank you!

The main thing about Stroganoff is your want that beefy flavor and sour cream to come out. Add cracked pepper if you want a kick...and a little milk if your want to make it more gravy like.  GOOD FLAVOR!

This recipe was fairly decent. I did use real garlic instead of powdered and I sauteed onions with the ground beef. I also added about a Tablespoon of worcestershire, 3/4 cup water, & a beef bouillon cube. It was an easy, quick meal

This was the exact recipe I was looking for tonight, I added a can of mushrooms and extra spices plus a little milk (I used 1 1/2 lbs of burger)I only had macaroni noodles and it worked just fine. My kids (ages 3 and 6) are eating it as I type this. It is very good! I will make it again, it was super fast! Thank you!

Use the reviews from others about adding mushrooms and extra sour cream and some beef broth. Makes it extra yummy.

Need a large meal on a budget? With 3 teenage sons (eating machines), who are active in sports, I am always looking for filling meals that I can make extras of for the “I’m hungry mom” times that come so often in our house. To make my life easier, I make a lot and put into containers in the fridge for my boys. I use 3 pounds of ground chuck, 1 large onion- cook and drain. Add fresh garlic, onion salt (about 1 tsp), worstershire (1 tbl) 1 large can cream of mushroom soup (about 26oz), beef broth (about 2-3 cups depending on what pot I cook in), 2 cans mushroom pieces and simmer for about 10 min. while the egg noodles are cooking.  Just before serving, I add about 1 cup sour cream to make it creamy and pour over egg noodles. I don’t care for pepper, but my boys always add pepper to it. They ask for this about every two weeks, so it’s a keeper! This makes about 12 meals – good size too! Works on our budget and fills my boys up!! Thanks for posting!

My husband liked it and gave it 3 stars. I thought the sauce was too thick, I think next time I would put the sour cream in at the start of the simmer time rather than the end. VERY QUICK & EASY TO MAKE!  I only had a half bag of egg noodles, but it ended up being plenty. I also added some corn midway through the simmer time. I didn't add the pepper until I dished it out at the table. I didn't add any salt.  With the added corn, I think this makes 6 servings. When I reheat the leftovers tomorrow, I'll probably add a splash of milk so that it's not so dry.

For a quick dinner, this was excellent.  Probably as written I'd have given it a 3 star.  Hubby said it's about a 4 1/2 star - he reserves 5 stars for unforgettable meals.  That said, I used a cup of beef broth, a cup of sliced canned mushrooms - fresh would have been even better, 1 T. roasted garlic, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 T. worcesershire sauce and 1 T. dry Ranch mix.  I served it over noodles with a side of green beans.  I know, I hate it when someone rates a recipe after making changes but I didn't make it according to the original recipe which looked pretty dull.  The changes gave it a meaty taste it would have lacked.

I really like this recipe, we make it all the time. My husband and kids love it. The only reason I give it four out of five is simply because I tend to change the spices a bit for better flavor... still working on the perfect taste :)

I made this with the addition of sauteing a whole package of fresh, chopped mushrooms and a whole, coarsely chopped yellow onion with the ground beef before adding the "wet" ingredients.  Thanks for this simple, quick recipe!

I was looking for something quick and warm and this hit the spot.  I cooked the beef with some onion and minced garlic and it was delicous!  Even my 5 year old ate it!  I also added 3/4 can of milk to the dish, it was a little too thick for us.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, we'll be making it again!

Great recipe. I did tweak it but who doesn't take a recipe and make it their own? I added minced onion and garlic and season salt to taste to the ground beef. Then added half a soup can of water and half a can of milk. My six year old and husband really like it. I will absolutely use this again. Great for a busy weeknight. Like the night before Thanksgiving.

This isn't going to win any awards for looks - but when you're hungry and low on cash, it's great to have around.  My husband and I ate a very similar recipe all the time in college, served over rice and with about 1/3 c milk instead of sour cream.  A teaspoon of garlic salt&pepper was our key ingredient.  I still make this when I don't want to hassle with "real" stroganoff or need something on the table quick.

I thought this was a GREAT recipe! I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and added garlic, onion, and mushrooms while cooking the ground beef (I also added beef stock) and it was fantastic. I'm only giving it 4 stars though because although I LOVED it, my husband didn't rave about it. **I'll still make it again though...he'll learn to love it. :-)**

This was very good.  I used beef for stew instead of ground beef and sauteed onion and garlic with the meat.  I also used Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom soup.  Used 1/4 cup of beef broth which made it creamier and added a touch of Worschestsher sauce.  My kids really enjoyed this dish.  Thanks for the post!

This is a good recipe for a fast dinner.  I omit the sour cream because it makes the sauce a little too thick for me.  Instead, I add enough milk to compliment the cream of mushroom soup.  I also like to add a few fresh cut mushrooms if I have any on hand.  This makes great leftovers!

This is my youngest son's most favorite dish, this particular recipe is easy to cook up real quick. I do add chopped onion and extra can of mushrooms when making it. So simple my son can make it when we're out of town.

This is a great simple meal. I change it up a bit to make it even faster. I buy a large bag of frozen meatballs at our grocery store- They have Italian seasoned, home style, and turkey. Saute onion, mushrooms, green pepper, and season a bit then add the meatballs and continue to cook stovetop or cook meatballs on a pan in the oven and add them to the skillet when they are done. Then add your cream of mushroom soup, a can of milk, and a package of lipton soup mix. It is very fast, tasty and a salad goes great on the side! Great meal for moms who work or have kids with after school activities. I also like to have toasted bread with it.
*TIP- Budget friendly too because I cut the meatballs into pieces which makes it stretch farther.

This turned out pretty good the first time I made it.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I added chopped onion to the meat while it was cooking.  The second time I made it, it turned out even better.  I didn't do the onions (my dad doesn't like them), I added onion and garlic powder, and a jar of mushrooms.  Super good!!

So I searched for a recipe that had ingredients I already had in the house and I decided on this one.  After scanning through the most helpful reviews, I browned the beef while rehydrating some minced onions. Drained, then added a few sprinkles of Worchestershire sauce, Cream of Mushroom with Garlic Soup, the onions, some garlic powder, some orgegano, salt, pepper and some frozen peas and let that simmer while the egg noodles cooked.  I added a 'lil bit of milk too, because it wasn't saucy enough.  Added the noodles and combined and then added in some sour cream with chives ('cuz that was in the fridge).  It had some nice flavor and really, the only thing I'd change would be to add fresh mushrooms next time.

Me and my family enjoyed this very much. I did read alot of the reviews before deciding on this one. I did listen to one that said to add a extra can of soup and mushroom. I also did add a can of milk to make more gravy. I think I would rather serve it over rice though. Overall it was very delicious.

GREAT! Just had this for dinner. Everyone loved it. I omitted the sour cream and filled the soup can halfway with milk. I added just a small amount of mozzarella cheese. I also took the advice of another rating and added a little bit of ketchup and parsley. I added frozen carrots,broccoli, and cauliflower. My kids and husband LOVED it!!

this was bland, no beef flavor. nothing like a stroganoff, with the exception that it had beef, noodles, and sour cream.  Maybe a decent base to build on but it was so unappealing that I didn't care to doctor the results.

Very yummy semi-homemade Stroganoff! One can of cream of mushroom soup wasn't nearly enough and I didn't have another, so I added a can of French Onion condensed and it worked perfectly. I also added 1/2 onion, diced and sauteed, and a small can of sliced mushrooms. I used minced garlic instead of powder. Very good!

Made by using the suggestions of "pizzafreak", which is the first commenter on the main page.  Everyone thought it was good except they picked out the canned mushrooms.

This is simple. And it's good! Not the best stroganoff I've had but when you're short on time and ingredients, it's a great throw together meal.

Very tasty BUT way too much garlic. We made enough for 4 servings and if I had to make it again I would us a 1/2 tablespoon instead of 1 tbsn.

Loved it! Super easy to make. I did make a few changes after reading the reviews. I sauteed onions in a little bit of butter along with fresh garlic. I removed this from the pan and added the brown meat. as the meat was browning, I added paprika, seaon salt and worchestire sauce. Simmerd for 10 minutes and poured over pasta. YUMMY!

My family liked this one.  It was a little too runny for my taste, so next time I'm going to add a little more sour cream and add about 1/2 block of cream cheese.

Not a bad recipe.  We liked it, and I'll probably make it again.  Only next time I'll probably add a little extra sour cream.  The dish did turn out a little dryer than I expected.

This is one of those recipes that I've had for years and pull out when I'm in a real hurry or lacking much in the cupboard, and everyone is happy to see it again.

The recipe I have adds a small (6 oz.) can of tomato juice to the mushroom soup. I can't imagine this without tomatoes, and have added a small can of stewed tomatoes when we had not juice in the house. It was still good.

As others say, a great starter recipe. It is thick, but I like it that way. Someone suggested bacon, which turned out to be a FANTASTIC choice. I added onion, garlic, mushrooms, and milk. Next time I'll try beef broth.

This was a great base recipe. Thanks Brenda! I did however add a few things. I cooked 1 onion and some freshly minced garlic with the beef. I also added some worchestershire sauce, 1 tsp oregano, 1/4 cup beef broth, and some mushrooms to the mix. I did not stir the sauce and noodles together. That way I can use the leftover sauce on rice or potatoes, to change it up a bit. It was absolutely tasty ... very good! I will definately be making this recipe again.

It was good after quite a few changes.  I added onions, mushrooms, and garlic to the ground beef.  Used one can of cream of mushroom soup, one can of beef broth, one beef boullion cube, one packet of ranch mix, and 8 oz of sour cream.  Served over egg noodles.

I love how easy this recipes is!! Threw it together for dinner and the family loved it! Thought that it called for too much garlic powder but I went for the whole tablespoon and husband said it tastes "perfect". Also, I didn't have cream of mushroom on hand so I used cream of celery and added some canned chopped mushrooms. This is a keeper!

I made this for my fiancee one night, and we were both a little disappointed. We decided to go with the basic recipe and we found it really bland and with not enough sauce for the noodles. I think next time I am going to add fresh garlic, chopped onion, fresh cooked mushrooms, and add beef broth to make more sauce. I even took the left overs to my family, and they agreed it was bland. I will admit the basic version left overnight does get better.

For a quick stroganoff this was easy and good. I only used about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, and added about the same amount of onion powder. Since I had some leftover rice to use up, I used rice instead of noodles. Very good!

I pretty much made this as written because this was all I had on hand.  The only changes I made was to season the meat while cooking (season salt, onion powder, garlic powder) and I mixed in a little bit of milk so my can of soup would mix better.  Served over linguine and it was delicious...would definitely make again.

This is so simple, so cheap and really yummy.  Made the 8 searvings version but only 12 oz bag egg noodles.  Added 1/2 chopped onion 1 small can sliced mushrooms.  Used 2 cloves garlic instead of powder.  The next day a bit dry so added a 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup when I reheated it.

This didnt have as much flavor as I had hoped. It was good enough to make again and I think next time I will take the advice of fellow reviewers and add some "extras" to season it up a bit

GREAT! and really adaptable. I scaled it for 2.  I ended up after a week of graduation, wedding, baby parties with a this and that in the fridge.  Leftover burger patties (1/4  lb each) 8 mushrooms - had to sacrifice 1/2 can of mushroom soup i got on sale for 50 cents -no wait - saving the other half for whatever - tossed in a tablespoon per person of catsup (My to die for recipe for stroganoff came out of the ORIGINAL joy of Cooking and called for tomato paste) then some broth (don't do water or bouiliion unless you have no broth) and then noodles.  heaven on a budget and when you saved the right things

i used ground turkey and added fresh garlic and a half of a white onion. After browned up the meat and added the cream of mushroom, it was a bit thick so I added a bit of milk to thin it out a bit. I used light sour cream and regular cream of mushroom and the dish turned out better than expected. It was quick and easy, I will totally make it again.

This was a terrific and tastey dish with a few additions. I chopped onion and added to the meat. I also added 1 T worceshtire sauce, reduced the garlic powder to 1 tsp. and added a can of water with the mushroom soup along with a beef buoillon cube. Combined the meat mixture with the egg noodles and served with homemade rolls.

This was okay. It was too dry though with only 1 can of soup and it didn't call for diluting it, but I HAD to add about 2/3 a can of beef consomme to have anything to simmer. The flavor was fine though when it was done., but a little bland for my personal tastes. The family gobbled this right up. I used minced garlic in the jar instead of powder so I used less.

Not bad, it was very easy and quick to make. My husband and I both liked it. I did add some extra salt and parmesan cheese to give it a tad more flavor, as it was just a little bland without it, but overall pretty good when you're in a hurry!

I liked this recipe, I don't think I would ever make stroganoff the traditional way as I like ease.... I did as other readers suggested and added 1/2 packet of dry hidden valley ranch...it tasted really good, but was pretty dry even when I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk. It might have been the ranch that dried it out, hard to tell, I will be trying it again without the ranch.

Found this recipe after a long day and didn't have a lot of energy.  Added some mushrooms and extra garlic.  Cooked a vegetable on the side and it made for a great, easy meal.  I disagree with other reviewers, this is a good, simple recipe.  Sometimes it doesn't need to be a culinary sensation, just easy and filling.

Very, very bland. No taste.  I added more garlic, some onions, beef broth and a boullion and nothing.  Hamburger Helper makes a MUCH better stroganoff.

I use a 16 oz bag of wide egg noodles. I add 1 chopped onion and 2 cans cream of celery soup since my husband hates mushrooms. I add one 16oz container sour cream to the hamb. and soup mixture just before serving as to not break down the sour cream too much. I serve it over top of the noodles as you would spaghetti. I have made this for my family for 35 years and it has always been their favorite.

This is comfort food from my childhood!  I would give it a 5 star rating, but it really is not an appetizing looking dish!  I always add an extra can of sliced button mushrooms and a sprinkle of paprika on the top for color.  Yum yum... I may have to make this for dinner tonight now!

Mom rates it a 4. Kids & hubbie loved it! I thought it was bland and I had to add about 1/2 cup of milk to thin & make the sauce go further. Lots more garlic (fresh & granulated) & pepper. Easy, simple dinner that the rest of the family loved.

This is one of our favorites, delicious and very easy!  It can be very bland, you have to add more of each ingredient.  I usually add about a cup of sour cream, sometimes more depending on the flavor.  It is very important to flavor the beef while it is browning.  Otherwise the beef is very bland.

Good base for a stroganoff, but definitely not enough flavor... needs the onion, garlic, etc. suggested by other reviewers.  Use this recipe to start, but you have to play with it a little.  We didn't have enough milk on hand to thin it out and it was way too thick.

I really enjoyed this.  I liked it because it was so simple.  The only thing I did different was I sauteed garlic with the beef (would have done onions and mushrooms, but my husband doesn't like them... such a baby!).  If you are looking for something that tastes a lot like Stroganoff, don't go for this one.  This was just a quick dinner that had a similar flavor.

My mom raised me on this stuff!  Then taught me how to make it - simple, quick, tasty and sticks to your ribs.    It turns out well with cut-up stew beef too.  But you do have to put some milk in there - half the soup can worth.  Plus you need some onions, and I go with real garlic.

Love this cuz it's soo quick and easy I've made at least once a week. I've added worsteshire sauce, onion, garlic and mushrooms. I've also tried the golden mushroom soup with a little milk and that is good too. My husband doesn't like the sour cream so I leave that out, but with all the other cream in it you can hardly tell.

My family loved this dish!!! Even the late teenager who heated it up in the microwave thought it rocked!!(his words not mine) I did add 2 cups beef boullion as suggested in other reviews because it seemed like it would be too thick and creamy without it. Also added diced onion when browning the hamburger. Amazing flavor from simple preperation!! Just the way I like my recipes to be.

Very good for a quick and easy weeknight meal. I used 1 cup of sour cream and 1 can of beef broth. I also browned the meat with chopped onions and garlic. I serve the noodles and stroganoff separately as some family members like more noodles than meat and vice versa. Thanks.

I dont eat ground beef, but i love stroganoff, so i substituted Yves veggie ground round for the beef.  The onions in the ground round gave it a nice flavour.  As well, i added a can of mushrooms, used fresh garlic, and to thin it a little, i poured in the liquid from the can of mushrooms.  Even my carnivourous boyfriend loved it.  I'll make it again for sure :)

A really simple and quick recipe.  However, I thought it needed something extra for flavor, so I added a 1/4 can of beef broth to it and it thinned it up a bit and added some great flavor to it.  I also added a small can of mushrooms.  I will fix it again.

Super quick, tastes pretty darn good for a really easy dinner. Only changes were doubled the cream of mushroom, added a little milk and substituted in minced garlic. My picky daughter even likes it!

Rest assured, this review is based on the ACTUAL RECIPE! 

I gave this 4 stars because it is pretty good for being a plain basic recipe. We all really liked it. But it was missing a few other flavors that I might add next time. 

So as is 4 stars. Not based on others modifications.

I used 1.25 pound hamburger, chopped onion, cooked until no longer pink, and added a few shakes garlic powder. Added a can of cream of mushroom, 1 c. beef broth, 1 TB Worcestershire, and a 4.5 ounce jar of mushrooms. Small splash of white wine and about 1/2 - 3/4 c. sour cream. Heated through and a 12 oz pkg of noodles. Next time might try to find a 16 oz bag. Great meal. No complaints from my house!

I loved how simple this recipe was. Due to the fact that my mom doesn't eat red meat I made it with chicken. I was a little worried about how it would turn out but it was delicious! I followed the recipe step by step. It was a little dry for me but still very good. My brother who's the pickiest had a second plate so I guess it wasn't that bad :)

I made this, but I must have missed adding some liquid to the ground beef mixture.  After adding the condensed soup it says to simmer.  But it needed something to liquefy it enough to 'simmer'.  I added 1/2 can milk just to liquefy the mixture enough to simmer.  I also added 3/4 pkg Hidden Valley mix. I would have added fresh sliced mushrooms but didn't have any.  I also added a little more sour cream.  Served with fresh (from my garden) green beans sautéed in butter with chopped onions.  It's a super-good recipe that doesn't take much time to  prepare and fix.  I love it!!! I will make this again. 
PS:  I used the recipe adjust to 4 servings.

This recipe was delicious made by just following the original recipe.  Many of the reviews added lots of yummy ingredients that probably does enhance it, but they also take more ingredients and thus time.  If you are looking for an extremely simple stroganoff recipe that is delicious, this is the one.  I wish I had doubled it though; My boyfriend and I polished the majority off the first night.  I just barely had enough leftover for a lunch.

Like most others who reviewed this recipe, I made same additions to the original. As is, it's a good place to start. I added a chopped onion and tsp of chopped garlic to the beef as it browned. Then I added about 1 1/2 cups of chopped cremini mushrooms. (I had purchased a large pkg at Costco and needed to use them up!) I took the advice of several other reviewers and added about 2 tsp of Worcestershire Sauce to the mixture. At that point it was smelling pretty good, so I continued with more of the advice I had read here and added 1 cup of beef bouillon. Next, I added a generous splash of white wine and then the can of mushroom soup. I let it simmer while I prepared the noodles. I didn't have egg noodles but I did have linguine which I snapped in half before I threw it in the boiling water. WHen the noodles were almost done, I added the sour cream to the meat mixture. I had been tasting this periodically and it was so much more tasty than it looked (grey food really is not that appealing!). So, like another reviewer, I threw in some frozen green peas. I let it simmer a little longer, until the peas were hot and then served it over the noodles in pasta bowls. My husband and 16-year-old step son gobbled it up. It was delicious! Thanks, Brenda for the original and to the other reviewers for their suggestions. It was a "village" approach to cooking a great dinner!

Really simple and easy to make. It took no time at all. My picky husband like it. I added some fresh garlic, mushrooms, and shallots. The sauce was a little on the thick side. I think next time I am going to take the comments' advice and add some milk or beef broth to it.

Very easy and yummy recipe. Mine was a little bland, or maybe it was the brand of cream of mushroom I used.  Next time I would add fresh garlic and a ton of salt and pepper.  I also added fresh mushrooms to mine. I would make again. Thanks!

Good easy weeknight recipe with a little tweaking.  I added some chopped onion and fresh sliced mushrooms.  Also about 1/4 cup of milk, as it just seemed very thick.  Tossed the egg noodles with a little olive oil and parsley just before serving.  The family loved it.

I gave this a 4 due to it being a little bland...but overall, this is a good recipe for those on a budget, tight on time and beginner cooks.  I have done similar to this for years using ground beef.  It is fine as is...if you want to kick it up some read through the reviews for ideas...or use my years of experience.  I cook a mirepoix (chopped onions, chopped celery and chopped garlic) along with 90/10 ground beef.  Add beef broth (be it canned or bullion with water), a little worcestershire, cream of mushroom soup, mushrooms cut in thicker pieces, sour cream and add more water if needed (or a white wine/vermouth)....basically adjust the liquid to accommodate your needs. Keep the salt content in mind when using canned soups, beef broth, worcestershire and bullion cubes....taste before adding additional salt.  Serve over noodles.  I often add diced carrots to my mirepoix and/or add peas into the mix.  Just a nice basic meal that has always been a comfort food for us. As a side note.... I often make it very 'wet' and add my noodles right into the pot.

A little on the bland side but simple and quick to make, and a respectable weeknight meal.  I added chopped onions and sliced mushrooms to the meat to give it a little more flavor.

Better than I thought it would be. Sour cream makes a big difference! I was not looking forward to eating it, but I thought it would be an easy meal for the family. It turned out to be actually pretty good compared to some beef stroganoff Ive tried. Even at as leftovers. Will make again, but will add a little milk.

This was quick and easy and pretty good.  I had made Turos Csusza from the website the night before, and had lots of noodles leftover, so this is what I used for my noodles and sour cream, although I did add a little more sour cream also.  It was tasty and helped me use up the Turos Csusza leftovers.  The kiddos loved it.

This is a good quick budget conscience recipe, but like others I altered it so therefore I only gave it 3 stars. I added chopped garlic instead of powder, 1 pkg. fresh mushroom sliced, 1 can of beef stock, approx. 1 Tbs. of Parsley, and three caps-full of extra dry Vermouth (which, as another poster similarly stated, makes all the difference) to the existing recipe. Thanks for posting this.

Good base recipe.  The recipe as it is, is pretty bland, not much flavor.  But if you add some Worcestershire and some of the other ideas from other reviews its good. I like to mix and match the ideas from the other reviews and make it a lil different each time and its always good and easy.

So good!! We did end up adding a few things per our family's personal preferences (chopped onion, canned mushrooms, and some extra seasoning) and also added an extra can of cream of mushroom, since it didn't seem like enough. But this was a great recipe, can't wait to eat the leftovers again tomorrow!!

This was just okay. All my kids ate it, but no one really enjoyed it. I did follow another user's suggestions and added a can of beef broth, a generous sprinkle of paprika, a T of Worcestershire sauce, some dried onion flakes, and a bullion cube added to my water in which to cook my noodles. The best part was the noodles, which were homemade style straight noodles. I know it's not fair to change the ingredients and give a low rating, but I could tell it needed some dressing up.

I've never made stroganoff before...i made this because it look simple and I had all the ingredients on hand. I really enjoyed this and will be making at again! The only thing i added was a bit of chopped onion to the beef.

A very simple and filling one-dish meal. I usually add a cup or two of peas for a vegetable component.

Without modifications...two stars.  With...four to five.  I added three cloves of garlic.  One small chopped onion. 5 chopped fresh crimini mushrooms (about a cup).  No garlic powder, onion salt instead.  And a tablespoon and a half of the new leas and perrins THICK worcestshire sauce.  Let's just say that after this meal we were some happy campers.

I would have given this fewer stars, I really didn't like it at all, but my kids did love it and even asked for seconds . . . so I guess it wasn't all bad.  Both my husband and I thought it was too bland.

This looks just like the recipe I always make. The only difference I see is I add a few slices of chopped bacon with the ground beef while cooking it adds great flavour!

I also thought this was a good base recipe. I added onions, garlic and mushrooms and I thought it was a nice easy recipe. I wouldnt say it was anything great but it is a good one if you are in a hurry and need a nice filling meal!

This was a great recipe. I added some wine to thin the mixer before I put in the noodles and added  4 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese after the noodles and sour cream were in then stirred it all up. It was great.

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for as far as easy beef stroganoff. I like mine with ground beef, and NO mushrooms.  I added little bit of fresh garlic and onions, but otherwise it's just perfect. Thanks for reading my "mind" when it comes to recipes!!

Easy and tasty.  It is not as good with ground beef as with other cuts of beef.  But this is a great base recipe when you're in a pinch for time and want something with a good flavor and with substance.  Serve with a salad or some garlic seasoned green beans and you're good to go.

A very good and easy recipe to put together. We had a super busy day and I was in no mood to 'cook'. Found this recipe the day before and glad I did. The only change I made was adding mushrooms that needed to be used up. The hubby went for seconds. Will surely make again.

This was a fast, easy and great tasting dish. I changed mine up a little bit, after reading some of the reviews from others. I added chopped onion and sliced fresh mushrooms to my ground beef while cooking. I also added some worchestershire sauce in with the cream of mushroom soup. A friend of mine told me she makes a simular recipe but where it calls for the sour cream, she uses French Onion Dip. I only had 1/2 of a container so I used that and 1/2 sour cream. It was wonderful! My kids both came back for seconds and that is very rare when it comes to casserole type dishes!

I don't know if I reviewed this already or not so I'm doing it just in case. It's a great recipe if you need a quick meal for the family. My only sugestion is that you make a little more sauce than it calls for otherwise it turns out a little dry.

I make this all the time.  I do spruce it up with some mushrooms, onions and garlic.  Then I add stew beef cubed small instead of ground beef.  I also add 2 beef bouillon cubs, 1,2 cup of red wine, and some worchestershire sauce.

mmmm mmmm mmmm!!! My whole family loved this! I added a 4 oz can mushrooms w/ liquid (will use fresh next time), sautéed onion with beef, used a little less garlic powder, and added one crushed beef bouillon cubes to meat AFTER draining fat. Used with homemade spaetzle noodles. Hopefully making again very soon! Thank you!

This was a great quick fix dinner. I prepared this the suggested way of reviewers with the Hidden Valley Ranch packet. I'm glad I did that though we found the flavor to be bit too salty. Next I will make this with low sodium cream of mushroom and probably only use half the ranch packet.

This was pretty good for a quick and easy dinner. I threw in some mushrooms, about 1/3 of an onion and a little extra sour cream. I will make again. Next time I will use lots of fresh garlic.

I made this dish for the family last night and they loved it!  It was super easy to make, I had all the ingredients on hand and it tasted pretty good.  It's a poor man's version of beef stroganoff, but it's a quick, easy and inexpensive meal that will please the whole family!  THANKS!

I hate to give a bad review, but this was bland, bland, bland!  I even took ALL of the other reviewers suggestions and added onion, fresh garlic, worcestershire, sherry, boullion, etc. and I still thought it was just tasteless.  I will say that it was easy enough and husband and kids ages 3 and 1 liked it, but they like stuff on the bland side.

As written, I agree that it would be bland.  I added an onion, mushrooms, and couple cloves of garlic when cooking.  And it turned out good.  Just the way I remember it growing up.

My husband made this for dinner last night.  The only thing we did differently was use ground turkey in place of ground beef.  Overall, I thought the dish was good but we both agreed it had too much garlic.  My husband thought he had read the recipe wrong and had to get up and check while we were in the middle of eating.  Next time we would use a tsp. of garlic powder.  It is a good base recipe to start with and add ingredients to your liking.  Would recommend.

It's good for what it is.  I added green bell peppers, onion, mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce.  I think it would've been pretty plain otherwise.

this was nice and simple.  i browned 1 chopped onion and a clove of garlic with the beef.  i also added white and red pepper.  i think it needs something else, as it seems to be missing something.  maybe worstichere (?) sauce?  i will definately try it again and keep experimenting with the flavors.  very good base to experiment with!!

This was just okay, prety bland actually. We ate it as leftovers the next day and added some cheese to it, and it was much better. With the cheese I would give it a 4.

This was easy, but very, very bland! This is a basic recipe that really needs to be adjusted. It definitely lack some spices and/or seasonings, like cumin, chili powder, nutmeg... according to your taste. If I make it again, I will season it according to my liking.

Yum.  I actually added a little more sour cream, a little milk, and threw in a package of onion soup mix, and served it on rotini noodles, since that's what I had on hand.  I'm single, and got three yummy meals out of it!

We didn't care for this.  I used it as a base to make again and used sirloin instead ground beef, which generates some nice juice while cooking.  I added 1 onion, cut down on the garlic, added more spices, 3 tablespoons ketchup, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire, and last added 1 cup of sour cream and heated through not letting it boil.  Was soooo much better!  I know the ketchup part sounds weird but just give it a try.

This was really good, but a little too thick and rich for my taste.  I think that I would add just a little milk to thin it out a bit.  Also, I ended up with what I thought was way too many egg noodles/too little sauce.  I might try using less ground beef next time, as well.  Great tasting, quick meal, all in all!

My family enjoyed this recipe so much. My 9 year old helped me make it and was so proud of himself for 'making dinner'. :) The only thing I thought was a tiny bit too much was the sour cream, so I used 3/4 of the container and it was perfect. This took only about 20 mins total and is a godsend after a long day. Thanks!

Recipe was quick and the ingredients you will probably already have on hand! Like other reviewers, The only think I did differently was added Worcestershire sauce and onions to the ground beef half way through cooking it. Good recipe for a weeknight!! Family liked it.

I loved it.  It was easy and flavorful. I did add a little more spices to it, but the original recipe is excellent. I used turkey meat though as I don't eat red meat.

As written, this recipe turns out very bland with little beef flavor. Adding beef stock and using regular soup (not nonfat) helped, but I thought it needed a little heat so i added some red pepper flack.   Also a splash of Worchestershire sauce. That brought it up to 4 stars, but I wouldn't make it again.

The sour cream was a bit much after adding in the condensed mushroom soup. I found adding in the soup, then adding in a can of milk  and letting it boil down helped make a more mild sauce that was still flavorful when combined with the meat and garlic powder. 

I also added a dash of parsley flakes and a basil leaves with some salt and pepper to the sauce while it was simmering and it came out wonderfully.

Overall this recipe is a good start but since I don't eat sour cream much I'll probably use my modded recipe from now on.

I hate to say: I did not have Sour Cream. But when I realized it, it was to late. I did have Crème Fresh...it worked just fine but I doubled the amount. ...and more Salt. Almost always more Salt. LOL Thanks Brenda...!

I loved this recipe. I made it with cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic as that’s what I had. I added 1 can French onion soup, I beef bouillon cube and 1 can of milk. I didn’t add garlic as it was in the soup. At the last minute I decided to add the packet of ranch dressing mix. I have to say it was amazing. Any recipe that lets you build on it is awesome in my book! Thank you for sharing!

This is literally the simplest meal you can make in 1/2 hour.  It was delish as is.  Its going in my rotatation.  I dont always have sour cream on hand, lol.  But I did for once.  My family loved it.  Since I used mushroom soup, I also added fresh mushrooms chopped up.   I just happen to love mushrooms, lol.  So that was just on me.  Other than the extra mushys this is a really easy quick recipe, for a tired parent, wife or husband getting home after a long day:)  ty  Peas on the side ( my other fave)  Over egg noodles this was seriously a comfort food

The changes, added dry onion soup mix to recipe, added cumin to beef tips, used butter to brown beef and added cumin, salt and pepper,drained into bowl and used that liquid plus straight water to hydrate mushroom soup and onion soup mixture. Next time i will combine cream cheese and sour cream for richer sauce, (i read through several recipes to see what i liked), this one will always be the base and i will add what i have on hand at the time.

So easy and quick to make! Not to mention it tastes delicious. I did change the recipe just a bit - nobody in this house is on a diet so I used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom & Garlic soup (not fat free) and Daisy sour cream - regular, not low fat. I added a bit of Lowrey's Garlic Salt & Lowrey's Lemon Pepper for taste.

A good, cheap recipe, but not very bold in flavor. Using condensed soup instead of fresh mushrooms  saves a little on the cost, but it also compromises a little on the freshness, and it could use a stronger seasoning as well. But if you're looking for something quick, easy, and relatively tasty, this is a reliable option.

This is a good base recipe but needed some tweaking for our tastes. Taking advice from other reviewers I used 1 cup of beef broth, 1 tsp garlic powder,  sprinkle of paprika, about 1/2 tsp onion powder, splashes of Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also used fewer egg noodles. The specified amount seemed to mask the beef flavor.

We've been having hamburger stroganoff for years, using only the burger, egg noodles and mushroom soup plus a little salt. So easy my kitchen-phobic husband can make it!

I also use leftover chicken with mushroom soup, egg noodles and a few frozen veggies to make "chicken stroganoff", which my family says tastes almost like chicken pot pie.

I will definitely make this again, and I did make a few changes the second time around. I substituted 3 crushed and minced garlic cloves for the powder, because I don't like garlic powder and always have fresh garlic. I added 1 small diced onion and the garlic after the beef browned and cooked until they were soft. I didn't drain the grease. Instead, I added enough flour to soak up the grease, cooked it low until it smelled nutty, and then I added the soup. Also, I added 3/4 can of water to the soup.

The only thing I did differently was to replace the egg noodles with rice, as my pantry was somewhat "lacking". Both the kids, and myself couldn't get enough!

Very quick and super easy to make!  I also read the reviews and added the Hidden Valley Ranch packet.  It was very full of flavor.  You know its good when the kids ask for more.  A  quick  weeknight meal.  I also served with fresh Pillsbury Honey Butter Biscuits.  Yummy

I added diced garlic tomatoes, browned the beef with the onions and added  Worcestershire  Sauce... this always seems bland to me.. even added a small can of diced mushrooms.. IDK... it just was ..meh... I’m wondering if a cup of fresh sweet peas woulda helped...?

I added my own twist to it by adding onions and green peppers. I also seasoned the hamburger with grill mates backyard bbq. It was delicious.  If it's too thick, just add milk to desired thickness. Enjoy! We definitely did.

This was a great weeknight meal. I followed the recipe with a few additions. I sauteed half of a yellow onion, diced, with the beef, added a tsp of roasted garlic (I just can't brown beef without onion and garlic), omitted the garlic powder and, as another reviewer suggested, added a ranch seasoning packet with the sour cream. The ranch packet really added a lot of flavor. Thanks for sharing.

Made changes suggested below, specifically the ones from Elizabeth. To those I added a 1/2 TBSP of Gravy Master because, why not? It's something I like. Also substituted Skyr for sour cream.

I'm vegan so I of course had to make changes. Noodles of course Instead of ground beef I used ground beef crumbles, I use soy sauce, garlic, shiitake mushroom, vegan sour cream, vegan cream cheese, vegan mozzarella, fresh parsley, vegan cream of mushroom,I only added salt to the water while the noodles were cooking but none to the actual dish, I didn't use garlic powder, I used half of vegetable broth and have shiitake broth.

I was trying to think of something quick and easy for dinner last week and thought that it had been a while since I made my moms stroganoff but due to fires I didn't her recipe with me so I searched Allrecipes and founds this one,the flavor is smooth and the time it took to make was quick and easy. Very delicious.

Very easy recipe to make and turned out well.  As suggested by others, I used only a tsp of garlic powder, and next time will use even less since the garlic taste was still a bit strong.  Also added minced onion and used ground turkey instead of beef.  Will definitely make again.

I make it exactly as the recipe called for.  I have to say that it was a little bland.  I had to add a lot of salt and pepper for flavor.  It got the job done, but I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I really liked this dish & I’m not a mushroom person! I used to make the Hamburger Helper version of this but really wanted to try it homemade. This recipe was so easy! Only changes I made were similar to others — I added 1.5 cups beef broth & used 3 beef bouillon cubes. Only took 20-30mins!

Okay so I said I made it but I do have to say upfront I used Gardeins Beefless tips instead of Ground beef. For a vegetarian alternative this was amazing. Very moist from the soup but not gummy. Awesome.

Not sure I would recommend top round steak for this dish. It needs a tender steak like filet for this preparation or it needs to be cooked slowly for the tendons in the meat to break down.

It was okay. Simple and quick. My family said it was good, but the flavors fell flat. Could use something more. 

Served ours with garlic bread.

Sauted onions and mushrooms in butter, added 1 tbs chopped garlic and towards the end reduced 1/4 cup wine with the vegs.  Added Campbells cream of mushroom with garlic soup,  1 cup sour cream,  1/2 can of milk,  1 tbs Worschestire, and 1 tbs of beef bullion paste.  Stirred in cooked ground beef and let simmer on low for about 20 minutes.  Mixed with egg noodles.  Yummy!  I might try adding a pkge of dry Ranch Dressing mix next time as one reviewer suggested.

This was really good.  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the meat on this recipe and then used some beef broth with flour to cut down on the thickness.  I also added a can of cream of onion soup to give it additional flavor.

In my opinion a recipe that has this many stars shouldn't need so many modifications in order for it to be good.  I cooked the recipe as was written (except I did add a can of water to the condensed soup so that it would not be so thick that it wouldn't coat well) and I thought it was rather bland.  I'd need to make a lot of changes in order to be willing to eat this again.  At that point it would be a new recipe though.

I added a can of French onion soup and fresh mushrooms along with the cream of mushroom soup. I liked it; however I think I would need to spice it up a bit more next time. It was very easy and convenient to make.

I have been using this recipe for years. I found it in the "I hate to Cook" Cookbook.  Over they years I have adapted it.  I first sauté about a cup of fresh mushrooms in olive oil.  Then I remove them and cook the beef in the same pan.  I add about a 1/4 cup of white wine to the pan, stir to heat, and then add the soup.  Cook as recommended and then add the sour cream. Stir in completely before adding noodles. I use a tender cut of beef cut in cubes.  It is wonderful and my husband asks for it for his birthday.

This was delicious and a great starter recipe!! However, I did make several changes.

1. Added 1 cup of beef broth 
2. A couple punches of cayenne
3. A tablespoon of Worcestershire 
4. Half a minced onion (cooked w/the beef)
5. Reduced garlic powder to a teaspoon
6. Simmered for 20 minutes instead of the original 10. 
7. Added the salt + pepper in the beef and onion mixture

Overall, I would definitely make it again!!!

I loved it and will make it again. But I am cooking for just me most of the time so this is one recipe I would cut the noodles down but maybe make more sauce. It was kinda thick.

I cut calories by using low-fat soup, light sour cream, and 93% lean ground beef.  I also used sauteed fresh mushrooms because I like them better than canned.  I agree with reviewers who suggested doubling the Worcestershire sauce for more flavor.  Despite that, the flavor was kind of bland.

This is how I’ve always made beef stroganoff. Super quick and easy. However, I don’t use ground beef. Usually I use stew meat, which is probably chuck, but it’s cut up in chunks. But this time I had precooked frozen meatballs in the freezer that needed to be used up. And when I went looking for wide egg noodles at my supermarket, they were out. But they had pappardelle! I’ll never buy regular wide egg noodles again, if I can get pappardelle! They’re wider, and thicker and perfect for stroganoff!

I added some sliced mushrooms and diced onions sauteed with the beef. I also used plain, nonfat Greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream and also less calories that way. It was pretty good. I'd probably make it again. It was nice and easy, and I had all the ingredients on-hand.

ETA: Oh, also I forgot to say I added a packet of dry Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix as one of the reviews suggested.

Thanks for the recipe - this is a trip down memory lane. I learned this recipe in the late 60s, in cooking class at school. Still quick and good, I also add mushrooms and paprika. A bit less salty than Hamburger Helper, so I consider it an occasional guilty pleasure.

Made this tonight giving it 5 stars because it is quick and easy. My advice is to play with your seasonings it was a bit bland at first so I had to add a bit more seasonings for my taste. read the reviews they do give some good advice. I am from the south I just added some Tony Chachere's.

Not a stand-alone recipe.  Very bland if you don't add other seasonings, etc.  I did not read where anyone made it as is and said it tasted good; everyone had to make changes.  But a good starter recipe.  Wish I had read the reviews first and I would have been prepared to add other stuff, as needed.

This is a good base recipe. I read the reviews and added the hidden valley ranch packet. It was pretty good. Then I remembered the sherry tip and added that and it does make all of the difference.  It tastes 100% better with a bit of sherry. I also added a bit of hot water and then a bit of  heavy cream to thin it out. You could use milk. Etc. It needs to be thinned out.

I love this recipe. We call it "Poor Man's Stroganoff". I mince my onions fine so the my hard to please family do not see them. I always use the canned mushrooms however, I tried it with the fresh mushrooms and it had a fresher taste. LOVE IT!!!¡!!!¡

It wasn't bad, but it was bland.  It needs something to liven it up. I tried adding a little more sour cream, a little milk to keep it from getting too thick, and garlic salt. It still wasnt very flavorful.

This was a great meal that everyone liked.  I almost doubled the meat for the 4 of us because I knew my 14 year old would eat a lot. I made 2 boxes of rotini noodles and only a little bit left because the kids boys the noodles the most.  I cooked the beef with onion and garlic. I did not have ranch dressing powder so I added about 1/3 cup of the actual dressing and it was great.  I forgot the sour cream until the very end and it made it much better.  I might use a full onion next time. I was happy with this recipe and will make it again.

This turned out great! I sautéed some onions in the meat and it added a little pop of flavor. The kids all went back for seconds so it was definitely a hit at our house!

I skipped the mushrooms altogether and substituted a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup for the cream of mushroom soup. I also substituted stew beef for turkey just for fun.

Next time I will add more milk to make up for the canned mushrooms liquid. It was super creamy and needed more

Easy to make and delicious, too! 
I made it for my  in-laws, who raved about it and then asked if they could take some with them to eat later.
I'll be making this one again and again and it will be going into our "Family Favorites" cookbook!

Easy. Quick. Has good flavor. Seems like it will reheat well. Followed suggestions from others - added minced garlic to meat while browning. Added dried onions also. Sauce made of Cream of Mushroom, 1 c beef base and sour cream. Worcestershire was not overwhelming.

This is a great recipe. We enjoyed it as it is, however we like our stuff to have more seasoning. You can add any seasonings you want and it will taste great. This last time I made I added 1tablespoon + 1 teaspoon of Finger Lickin' Lickin' Chicken that I ran through the blender to make very fine., 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to 2 lbs of meat. 1 and 1/2 teaspoons Tabasco brand steak sauce, 1 and 1/2 cups of milk to one 16 oz can of cream of mushroom soup. I ran all of this through my blender and poured it over my meat and let it simmer. 
Since I do do use 2lbs of meat next time I'm going to use 1 packages of noodles

Nice recipe not quite as good as authentic stroganoff but cant complain seeing how quick and easy this was to make. I must add that I didnt have ground beef or garlic powder so I used ground turkey and onion powder instead. I think it would have been a lot better if I used beef and garlic powder but still pretty tasty.

This was quick and easy and like almost everyone else, I modified it to taste. Fried two chopped onions, two stalks of celery and nearly two cups of fresh mushrooms. Then added in the cooked and drained beef along with garlic powder, salt and pepper, dried parsley, cream of mushroom soup, cream, sour cream, Worcester sauce and 1/2 cup of peas. Served over noodles. Will make again.  :)

It really was exceptionally easy and really good.  I tried another, very similar recipe, but the other was proof that you, or at least some dishes, can be too rich.   This was pretty perfect.

Great flavor! I agree with other reviewers, I like a thicker sauce so I added the cream of mushroom soup. Made all the difference. So glad I came across this!

It was so good! I actually ended up adding a little more garlic and a pinch of dried onion because I thought it needed a little more... something. Now that I've made it I'll probably keep experimenting - that's just what I do with recipes. I'm definitely a fan, though!

My family has been going through it so I made it to help out a bit and give everyone a home cooked meal! It was really good and easy to make even tho I kind of botched it. My mother wound up adding a bit of milk and an extra tablespoon or so of garlic powder to make it a bit more creamy. We ate it with green beans, corn, and rolls!  Definitely good for first time cooks like me! Thanks a bunch

I made it today for lunch as I had left over ground beef already cooked. I followed the recipe for the most part up until the end. I wish I would have read some of reviews, I think it may have made the taste a little better. First I think the ground beef should be sautéed with the garlic for extra flavor in the meat. Secondly I was confused on whether to add the water to the cream of mushroom or not, it seemed a little lacking in sauce without it  I added about half a can off water. Everything went well until the end when I added the sour cream, I think it was too much. I didn't even add the whole amount and it really lacked in flavor. I tasted it prior to adding it and i tasted good for simple easy-make recipe. I ended up having to add more garlic powder, some onion powder and decided to try this steak seasoning I had lying around, it took quite a bit of seasoning to get the taste to something not so bland. Maybe it's something I I didwrong but I would definitely follow some of the tips on the reviews while making this recipe to get it just right. I like the idea of the hidden valley ranch seasoning. Not sure I'll ever try this recipe again though.

I add one tablespoon wochestershire sauce, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper.  After adding the sour cream, I add 1 ladle of pasta water.  Very quick and easy.  I also used Tomato Bazil noodles.

I made this pretty much as written (except for adding 1/2 pound of fresh sauteed mushrooms and browned onions while simmering and before addition of noodles and sour cream). It was perfect - just enough sour cream, just enough noodles, simple to make. Easy and excellent dish, hubby LOVED it!!!

I  changed it up just a bit for my and family's liking. Here's what I added. I used 1/2 lb chuck sliced thin, 1/2 prime rib roast. (We buy in bulk from Sams and cut into steaks) 1 large shallot , 1 cup home made beef broth from bones that we buy for soup stock and our dogs. 1/2 + Cup sour cream and 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream. I add the noodles to the sauce and mix ILO over the noodles. Finally I finish with chopped chives. My family loves this recipe and we only eat it once a month and it's a true treat! This contends with any top chef in any restaurant.  Add or cut ingredients per volume. We make a lot and it's fantastic the next day for lunch. Serve with fresh garlic loaf bread with soft butter and you'll have every coming back for more. Thanks for the share.

It was OK, but since I don't care for mushrooms, so I used cream of celery soup. I cubed a Top Round into 1/2" to 1" squares put flour in a paper bag with salt & pepper, shook a handful at a time. Cooked the beef in butter with onions, garlic, worcestershire sauce.and let cook. Added sour cream, and 1 can of tomato soup, simmered for 20 min, adjusted seasoning with s & p garlic powder and more worcestershire sauce. Served over egg noodles.

This is amazing! However, unless you are a huge garlic junkie, one tablespoon of garlic is way too much. A little bit goes a long way. I would suggest a half tablespoon or smaller. I had my nose burning from all that garlic.

It was very easy to make. Made it with 1lbs of ground beef and 1lbs of venison. My family is busy and everyone is going somewhere at different times. Made a double batch due to 2 teenage boys. One had to get to work and ate it on bread like a open faced sandwich, he asked if I could save some for later. I can not make any guarantees. Everybody so far has liked it.

Let me start off by saying that I am a complete disaster in the kitchen, and tonight was the first night that I attempted to cook dinner for my husband and I. I used the recipe exactly as it is, only I added 1 packet of the dry Hidden Valley ranch dressing, which I'm glad I did because it came out AMAZING. My husband is the pickiest eater I know, and he hates mushrooms, but even with the cream of mushroom soup, he absolutely loved it, and said it is a must once a week for dinner now! Very easy to make and very quick!

I'm a novice cook, and found this recipe because I have lots of frozen hamburger to use but have finally made it past the Hamburger Helper phase so need to find other ways to use it up. I was going to make the recipe as is, but with just 5 minutes of looking through reviews, I thought I could swing some minor modifications: 

I made all 16 ounces of egg noodles instead and ultimately only used about three-quarters of them in the actual meal. I made more because I planned on using more soup/liquid. I just added the cooked noodles until I liked the ratio of sauce to noodles.

Use two cans of cream of mushroom soup.

Also add 1 cup of beef broth. Make the broth by heating one cup of water in the microwave and then adding one bouillon Cube.

I had 5 or 6 fresh mushrooms in the fridge that I added late to the sauce, rather than heating them with the burger. They were great and I would have used more if I'd had them on hand. 

I think this would have been tasty as is...it's for a quick meal using very little ingredients, not for culinary artists. Which, again, I'm not.

The recipe didn't specify whether to add water or not, so I added half a can of water. I also used a little bit of cajun seasoning. This meal was amazing and I will be making it again.

I loved this. I would add a bit more of cream of mushroom next time. I also put a little less garlic powder so I could add onion and some paprika. I really loved how nice this tasted for how simple it was.

This was phenomenal!  So easy. I will admit I was a tiny bit confused when I added the condensed cream of mushroom soup...then I realized i needed to add the water too, just like making the soup. I salted to taste and every one went back for seconds and were pleading to take the leftovers the next day. This recipe would easily feed four adults.

This was neither good nor bad. it simply had very little taste to it, this was something you would expect to eat over at an elderly persons house who avoids all spices and flavors. Followed the directions exactly as written. 

In the end ..very very simple to make but, boxed Hamburger Helper Stroganoff tasted better.

Definitely simple and tasty.  I used Campbell's Beefy Mushroom instead of plain mushroom soup and added fresh chopped mushrooms in the last 10 minutes of cooking the beef.  It was quite good, though just a bit on the bland side.  I browned a bit of onion and bell pepper before starting the beef, too.  Next time, I'll add a touch more garlic and some savory herbs with perhaps a bit of dry mustard to give it a little more punch.

This was a great quick easy meal!  Followed some of the suggestions and did an onion, garlic powder, beef soup stalk (no salt), a couple dashes of Worcester sauce, and paprika in addition the rest of the menu. Didn't have sour cream but it still turned out really tasty. Thx!

4.5 stars. Great recipe, easy and fast, and it's flexible enough to allow modifications and still come out amazing.  Just trying to use up what I had laying around, I've used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and it was super.  I always add 3/4 can of milk in with the soup, plus one beef bouillon cube to intensify the beefy flavor.  Another tip is to under cook the noodles slightly, and let them sit in the mixture for at least 15 minutes before mixing in the sour cream, that way the noodles not only finish cooking but absorb some of the flavors in the process.  This will thicken the mixture significantly, but you can always add more milk if you want.

This was okay.  If I was to make it again, I'd definitely follow up on some of the suggestions made  by others, such as cooking onions along with the meat and letting the whole works simmer together for a bit. However, it made for a very quick decent dinner and for that it warrants an extra star.  That's how it got to 4 stars rather than 3.

This was good, but i made the following changes, added a few splashes of half and half when I added in the cream of mushroom  to loosen it a bit, also added in some frozen peas to well round it. My hubby loved it!

I usually don't like reviews that indicate all the changes that the reviewer had made to the recipe, but I just have to add one here.   I did make a few changes, but my family just loved this so much, I had to post something.

I pretty much followed the recipe (double batch), but used 1 can cream of mushroom, and 1 can cream of celery.  Also sauteed some fresh onion and garlic instead of the garlic powder, and followed the suggestion of reviewer Kerri Vann Pritchard and added the package of dry ranch dressing.  Served with steamed broccoli and crusty bread.  Delicious!

OK as written. Pretty bland, but like other reviewers some slight tweaking and it makes it good!

1. Added minced onion to beef as it was browning.
2. Added a simple ranch seasoning mix that I found the recipe for on AllRecipes when I added the soup.
3. Also added a half cup of water as it was simmering as it was getting dry.

Turned out pretty good after those simple changes.

Wasn't blown away by this recipe although it got decent reviews from my wife. I think it's better the first time but doesn't make for the best leftovers. In my experience it thickened too much perhaps because of the mushroom soup. I'd like to try in again with a combination of mushroom soup and something else that would thin it out a little. Tasty though. I'd look around for another stroganoff recipe next time out.

It was pretty good, but I think I added too much sour cream, giving it a rather bland flavor. I had more noodles than the recipe called for as well as more hamburger so I doubled the sour cream, but I don't think I should have. The family did like it anyway and I may make it again, but following the recipe a bit more.

It was such a huge hit with my family!  This was a nice, quick meal to put together on a busy weeknight.  I replaced the ground beef with Johnsonville's Irish O'Garlic sausages that were removed from the casing and browned and crumbled.  This sausage gave this dish some amazing flavor!  This has been requested for dinner again already!

I swapped out the ground beef for Johnsonville Sausage.  I'm giving the recipe a 5 based on that swap.  I do not believe that it would have been as good with just ground beef.  The flavor of the sausage really made this dish.  I think you would probably only taste the garlic powder had I not used sausage.  I used a different type of egg noodles because I had them in my pantry.   Really filling and easy recipe.  We are having leftovers tonight!

I made this last night with the following changes: ground turkey, fresh garlic, and 1/2 soup can of low fat milk...it was delicious!  My family really loved it!  It was quick and easy and will definitely be a staple in my home.

Pretty good (I liked it more than my boyfriend - he was going for 3 stars)....I followed the recipe straight, just to see what the basic flavor was before adding like everyone else. I think next time I'll try to go with added onions, mushrooms, possibly bell peppers. I liked it simple like this, more my flavor. With a side salad and garlic butter toast...it was a great dinner. :D

Sorry, but I'll have to give this barely a 3-star "It was OK" rating, it was pretty blah. For one, though I love garlic, I thought there was too much here. For another, the soup/sour cream mixture didn't result in a creamy texture at all - probably some water should have been added to the recipe. I made this exactly as written, using 85% lean ground beef, medium egg noodles, and eyeballing half of an 8-ounce container of sour cream. It wasn't bad, and I ate it all, but I probably won't be making this recipe again.

It tasted better than I remember it from home. I added a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce to the meat after draining, cut the sour cream in half and added heavy cream in it's place. I also put a teaspoon or so of paprika in at the end. Garlic salt, and fresh cracked pepper were also in there somewhere. This is a great dish and it's very very hard to mess it up.

Don't usually care too much for stroganoff but, had all of the ingredients on hand and wanted a quick dinner. Had to use 2 beef boullion cubes with some water because I didn't have any beef broth. Husband and I each had 2 helpings. Surprisingly good.

This was pretty darn good. Very versitile and can change to suit your taste.  I did make a few modifications based on other reviews.  I sauteed fresh mushroom about 1/c lb, used a can of Progresso mushroom soup (not condensed soup)and added a .87 oz of McCormick brown gravy mix - that gave it a more beef meaty flavor.

Pretty good if you just want quick dinner and have the ingredients on hand. I think the sour cream was a little much. Maybe half the amt. or just to taste. The consistency and taste was more to my liking before I stirred in the sour cream.

I made this remembering when I was a kid and my mom would make this. It is as good as I remembered. I give it three stars because I am the only one in my family of 5 who likes it. Maybe you need to grow up with the taste and texture to like this recipe.

So simple and so good. I goofed and accidentally used a can of Cream of Broccoli instead of Cream of Mushroom and it still tasted delicious. It helped that I added an entire package of sautéed mushrooms. I will definitely will make it again (with either soup.)

After reading other reviews, fried onions with  garlic first and then added extra lean ground beef.  Microwaved mushrooms until just tender and then added them with soup, sour cream (no garlic powder) and a bit of worcestshire sauce, goodo.

I've only recently started cooking around the house since my wife went back to school. This site has been my best friend with great recipes-- this one is no exception. I added the Hidden Valley Ranch Mix as suggested by one reviewer and also added an onion and a jar of mushrooms. I used milk in the Cream of Mushroom soup rather than water which gave the dish an overall creamier consistency. The only thing I will change the next time I fix it is that I will decrease the amount of garlic powder. It gave it a bit too much of a garlic taste for my liking. Otherwise, this is a great dish and I will definitely enjoy cooking it again!

This recipe is good as is. Yes, I'm sure if you do a million things to it you can make it more to your liking. My only suggestion is to add some kinda liquid to this (I started with 1/2 cup of milk and I'll probably go with a little more next time).

Pretty good for a quick and easy ground beef meal.  I sauteed minced garlic in a little olive oil before browning the beef.  Definitely need to add something to the sauce.  All I had was chicken stock, so that worked in a pinch and actually added nice flavor.  Next time will add fresh mushrooms.  All in all, a decent weeknight meal.

I am a food and nutrition teacher.  I am always looking for quick nutritious dishes that can be completed in less than 1 hour.  This was just what I was looking for.  I only gave it 4 stars because of all the adjustments.  I would have liked to give it 4 1/2.   I only added 1 t. of garlic powder, then I added 1 t. of beef boullion, 1 cup of water,  1 t. of salt and 1 t. of onion powder.  In order to make it fit my Curriculum I also added 1 cup of chopped carrots.  My students LOVED it.  Many have returned to class to tell me they have also prepared this recipe at home!  Great!

I doubled the recipe and added a beef bullion cube and one packet of onion soup mix.  I decreased the sour cream to 1/3 cup (I don’t like sour cream) and added it in with all the other stuff, rather than at the end.  I also skipped the salt and pepper.  I chose to spoon the sauce over the egg noodles, rather than mixing it together.  I gave my hubby and kids the option of putting more sour cream on top (they love it) but they all declined, saying it was good the way it was.  I’d declare that a hit!

3 and a half stars, if I could. When I tasted the beef mix, it was really bland and unappetizing. I added a beef boullion cube, a half a packet of dry onion soup mix, and about a cup of water, then let the majority of the water simmer out. This definitely helped with the blandness. My boyfriend isn't a huge sour cream fan, so I just served this with a dollop on individual bowls. In a pinch, a quick, easy recipe that uses ingredients most have already on hand.

this was a great start on a basic recipe.  I made some changes to add a bit more flavor. First I browned my cubed sirloin.  Next I sauteed onion and garlic then added mushrooms.  I deglazed the pan with a little red wine.  I added beef broth and cream of mushroom soup. This really kicked up this recipe to make it 5 starts instead of 4.

This is extremely quick and easy to make.  I reduced the amount of garlic powder called for to 1/2 tbsp. because the full tablespoon is slightly overpowering.

This a very simple yet a good recipe.  It is good when you don't have much time.  I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom because we like ours a little more soupy.

I liked this recipe BUT I had one beef with it.  The recipe doesn't specify whether or not you should add a can of water with the can of mushroom soup, so I went ahead and did it anyway but it seemed like it was way too watery.  However, I did add the Hidden Valley Ranch mix like one user said to do, and it made it tasted really great!

Simple and delicious.  Not "gourmet cuisine," but yummy comfort food recipe that uses up left over noodles.  By the way, I used ground turkey and it was still great.  Also topped with a little chopped up parsley for color and to avoid the "dog food" look (no offense). Also, my kids (5 & 7) LOVED this.

Simple and plain. I wouldn't have been able to get away with putting this on my dinner table without some seasoning in it... salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder aren't enough. I actually used seasoned pepper and thyme with the garlic powder and salt, and I cooked it all into the beef instead of adding the garlic later. My husband liked it since I made the alterations.

Very good and very easy to make.  However, I think the amount of garlic powder is a bit too much.  I cut it back to 1 teaspoon, and that was plenty.

Like others have said this is a great starter recipe. Of course there are always things that you can add to a recipe. My mom used to make this when I waas younger and I loved it. So of course I was looking for a recipe. I added the garlic to the hamb while browning. and of course worcestershire sauce. you can't make stroganoff without it. And fresh mushrooms and canned. I really like mushrooms. It it turned out great. My daughter loved it and the leftovers were gone the next day. Making it again tonight.

This is quick and tasty.  I used roasted garlic mushroom soup instead of adding garlic and as someone else suggested, a package of dry ranch dressing mix.  I'm sure the leftovers will be even better!

Really simple and nice flavor- a bit creamier than I needed, next time will add more mushrooms and less or no cream cheese-I also thought it was a bit bland for my tastes and added some worsteshire and salt- way better for me that way! Whole family liked it though! Will definitely make it again with those changes.

This recipe sounded easy, but somewhat bland.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to make a few changes.  In addition to the listed ingredients I add the following: 1/2 a chopped onion and two cloves of garlic (both cooked up with the ground beef), a can of cream of celery soup, a good couple shakes of worsteshire sauce and an envelope of dry ranch dressing (the ranch dressing mix was an awesome idea that I never would have thought of myself!).  The outcome was a delicious, quick and easy dinner!  No one is trying to call this a gourmet meal, but for a tasty and hearty home cooked dinner this definitely fits the bill.

This was good. I used turkey instead of beef though and I did add a little more garlic powder than it called for. My kids really liked it.

I like traditional stroganoff, and thought that ground beef would be a good, but cheaper version.  It was remarkably bland and the first recipe I have made that my fiance has not cared for.  However, I agree that it is a good starter recipe, and with some creativity, has potential.

I made this recipe, but instead of using the ground beef, I used the leftover beef from the Burgundy Roast Beef with Savory Sauce recipe which was emailed on 3/20/08.  I used the leftover sauce as well in addition to the cream of mushroom soup and sour cream.  The whole dish was superb!  I cut the beef into bite sized pieces and then added the rest.  It was great!

This recipe wasn't too bad.  I started to make it and realized I was out of ground beef.  I substituted diced chicken breast and used cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  I also added a lot more garlic and a cans of peas.  My husband said the noodles were a little "plain" and would have been better mixed in with the sauce than served on top.  Not too bad, not my absolute favorite.

This old standby has been around for at least 40 years. I only resorted to it when money was tight and I was desperate for a filling meal for the family. It's nothing great and was surprised to not only see it here but some thought it was wonderful. What a crack up!!

I have a husband that is allergic to mushroom so what I have done is subsituted the mushroom soup with onion soup and even though my kids say they hate onions they love it made this way. It is a quick and easy meal when you don't have much time.

Not bad when you are looking for something quick and hearty. I added in some fresh garlic and onion as well as 1/2 c beef broth to thin down a little. If I were making it for just myself and not husband and daughter I would add in some fresh mushrooms as well.

I've never made beef stroganoff before and found this to be a very easy recipe.  I followed it exactly, although I did add some worcestershire to it in an attempt to spice it up.  My husband and I both enjoyed it although I felt as though something was missing.

Pretty good. I did add more garlic and used milk to thin down the soup. I also used a cup of sourcream. Husband and kids really liked it. Would be really good with mushrooms but my family doesnt like them (to bad). Easy and good.

I thought this was delicious, though my boyfriend didn't like it. I made a lot of changes and additions, due to the variety and lack of ingredients in my kitchen. I cooked the beef with a clove of minced garlic and an onion. After draining it I added cream of celery soup because I had no mushroom (I guess this change keeps it from being stroganaff haha). I also added more onion and some worcestshire and broccoli florets. I served it with garlic bread and I loved it.

Quick and easy recipe that tastes just like my moms.  I added a bit of fresh mushrooms because my mom always does but other than that I followed the recipe.  Nothing fancy but to me, it's a comfort food.

This recipe is just like my mom used to make, but I lowered the sour cream. I used to hate it when she put in too much sour cream. It's a great basic recipe, and my hubby has asked for it again.

This was great! I omitted the sour cream and used 1/3 C skim milk instead, and added oregano, parsley, squirt of ketchup to mix, and fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top. My kids loved it! Thank you!

I have been making this for some time now and I too usually add water or milk. It lasts a little longer this way too. I also make mashed potatoes and canned corn. It doesn't make it easier but it sure makes it tastier.

If you can imagine that

My kids dance when I tell them this is for Diner.

This recipe is very good.  I did add some onion & green pepper while browning the ground beef.  This is a quick & easy dinner to make.

Very simple and delicious even my daughter who is so picky cleared her plate! I added fresh garlic and onion as suggested and a dash of paprika.  I did use the sour cream and soup but added  little milk.  Great recipe!

This is just Hamburger Helper, only you dirty more pots.  Also I had to add about a cup and a half of milk.  It's too thick otherwise.

It was good, but it was a very heavy meal.  I added paprika and a few shakes of lea & perrins as suggested.  I also used half garlic powder and half crushed garlic, and a package of fresh mushrooms that i sliced up and cooked with the beef while it browned.  And, after reading all the other reviews comolaining that the sauce was thick, I put in only half the amount of [reduced fat] sour cream.  Even using reduced fat sour cream and soup, it still is a very heavy meal.  It did have a very good flavor though.  If we could rate in halves, I'd give it 3 and a half stars, but given that I think a lot of people give overly generous ratings site-wide, I'm rounding down.

I thought this recipe was not bad as a base recipe.  By no means would I just make it as is since it would be way too bland and too thick.  However, I decided to spruce it up by adding a cup of red wine, a cup of rice milk, rice sour cream (I'm lactose intolerant), a teaspoon of paprika, and some dried parsley to the sauce.  When I was browning the meat, I added some fresh garlic and onions.  Also, I hate mushrooms, so I used cream of onion soup.  This was my first time making a beef stroganoff and I thought it went pretty well.  I will make this again with the adjustments I mentioned.

My family and I enjoyed this very much! Instead of using ground beef I thought that I would make it a little heartier and add stew beef meat and it was a hit! I also substituted the egg noodles with rice which was also yummy! Next time we will try with the noodles whcih I'm sure will also be good.

This overall was a very good dish, much like one out of a box.  I did need to add some milk at the end to make it a little more moist; otherwise it would have been too dry.  I also added a little more garlic powder and salt for some more flavor.  But definitely an easy dish to make!

My 3 and 1 year olds loved this and I thought it was pretty good for as simple as it was to make!  I did tweek it a bit - I added mushrooms, used real garlic instead of powder and of course salt & peppered it.  But other than that, while not a fancy recipe, it is quite tasty for being so easy!  A perfect weeknight supper!  I'll definitely make it again!

Very easy, but not that great. A little too thick with creams and meat. Lessen the amount of meat and add some milk and it's OK for an easy, quick after-work meal.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  It just tasted like cream of mushroom soup.  Don't get me wrong, I love cream soups...and I love cooking with them, but I was looking for a different taste here.

Well this is a quick and easy meal. I didn't use fat free cream of mushroom soup, because I had regular cream of mushroom soup and it tasted good like I made it. I also added alittle more garlic powder (love garlic) and you could just taste alittle hint of something different. Thanks for the recipe...

The garlic was a tiny bit overpowering, but not so much that it wasn't tasty!  I added dried parsley to the egg noodles, and a little milk to the sauce.  Yummy!

This recipe overall waws pretty good though it was rather bland.  I tried spicing it up with previous recomendations of hot sauce and worchestershire sauce.  I thought that this gave it a strange flavor.  It needed something, but I am not sure what.  I also added milk to thin down the sauce.  I have had better beef stroganoff recipes.

So easy. I made minor adjustments: used about 1/2 lb ground beef and browned with 1/2 onion and 1 clove garlic, added milk and 1 beef buillon cube to soup mixture, and a little more sour cream. Yummy! Even the hubby said it was good and he hates this type of food. I also used elbow macaroni which worked fine.

I made this last night, but I didn't have this recipe, I threw it together.  The changes I made were adding 1/2 onion, one can of mushrooms, and about a 1/2 cup of milk.  I whisked the milk, sour cream and soup together and then added it to the ground beef.  I would have used fresh garlic but did not have any on hand.  I also added a couple of dashes of Worchestshire and Hot sauce.  My husband like it, and it made a lot.  I think it needs a little more flavor - beef broth might help.

Very good recipe for the quick preparation time.  Two recommendations for this recipe though: Use "real" garlic instead of the garlic powder, and add mushrooms to the recipe.

Yes simple, but very unsatisfying if prepared as is.  I agree with the others about adding ingredients.  Onions, mushrooms, fresh garlic rather than powder, and seasoning in the form of broth or soy sauce all work well.

Good but needs something.  It definitely needed milk to thin it out some. My 5 yr old and 2 yr old both ate it so I'll probably make it again just for them.
