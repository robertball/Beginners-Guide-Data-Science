FANTASTIC!!  I don't have all those different flours on hand, so I just substituted 2 cups of all purpose gluten free flour which already has xanthan gum in it.  I also cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups but will try even less next time.  Consistency of cake is amazing and no one would guess it's gluten free!!!

I'm 1st generation, 100% Hungarian and this was really good.  I can't believe it's gluten free.  I used coconut flour, since I didn't have almond flour and it came out great. Thank you for such a tasty, easy recipe.

I loved the taste and consistency.  4 apples were too many, I only used 2 and I also cut the sugar back to 1 cup. It came out perfect!  Keep in mind cake doesn't rise too high. I baked for about 50 mins.

I read some of the earlier comments about this recipe. Very helpful.  couldn't find Almond Flour so switched to Coconut Flour.  I cut the sugar to 1 Cup.  Absolutely delicious and moist.  Peachlander12

Excellent!  Everyone enjoyed this.  I used gluten-free flour (only) instead of the combination in the recipe.  I did not add the walnuts.  4 generous apples made the cake very moist and delicious.  I would make this again!

This recipe is an absolute treasure for those who cannot eat wheat. +The reviewer who expressed concern re xanthan gum as an allergen can substitute guar gum or locust bean gum. It might be possible to find out what the growth medium for your xanthan gum was.  It's not always grown out on wheat.

Our favorite.  I've made this several times.   I substitute xantham with psyllium husk 1 to 1 ratio as xantham gum disagrees with me.  I use 6 apples...the more the merrier in our opinion.  Lots of nuts too.  I use brown sugar - a little less than the recipe.   I'd like to try it with different fruits in the future.  Peaches or pitted cherries.

Fabulous !! As others did, I cut the sugar to 1 cup and it was just the right sweetness. I used the flour mixture in the recipe, but cut the xanthan gum to 2 tsp, as I was worried with a full Tablespoon it would be gummy. Great texture and taste. My apples were large so I used 3 (Ambrosia and Granny Smith). I baked it for ~40 min. Thank you for the recipe and helpful reviews!

Due to allergies, I skipped the walnuts, substituted coconut flour for the almond flour and 1.5 tablespoons guar gum for the 1 T xanthan gum.  
I substituted brown sugar for the white but the recipe was still fairly dry, crumbly and very brown.  I even took it out of the oven at 50 minutes, already too dark in the glass pan.  In an effort to reclaim it, I brushed the top with melted butter and sprinkled vanilla-infused demerara sugar over it.
Next time, I will try turning the temperature down 25 degrees.  I will substitute rice and tapioca for the almond flour as well.  (They absorb less liquid than coconut flour.)  And I think I will sprinkle the top with the vanilla-infused demerara sugar before baking.

At our mile high altitude it’s diificult to get this to raise so, although very tasty, it’s usually flat.

this cake is great!  i just used almond flour and GF all purpose, about half and half. I also cut the sugar back to one cup and didn't notice any difference.  My husband loved it.  Be sure to use a nice tart, firm apple that will stand up to baking.  Serve with real whipped cream or a good quality ice cream.

A wonderful desert; I couldn't find any  sorghum flour, so I substituted Coconut flour instead and it turned out just great.  I tried it out on three friends and it was overwhelmingly received with no hint that it was a gluten free product.  Very moist and almost coffee cake like in texture.  My very first attempt to bake and it turned out well.  Thanks for the receipt.

Delicious! My boys really enjoyed this one. I made as written and wouldn't change a thing. They heartily approved and requested I make it again for a potluck we attended. Came home with an empty dish from the potluck too!

I followed this recipe exactly and I and the rest of the family thought it was out of this world!  It was fantastic when it was still slightly warm.  Everyone had seconds. The walnuts gave it an extra special taste.  I will make this again and again and again!

So, I made this about a week ago for my family and it got rave reviews. My mom was absolutely in love with this and said it was THE best apple cake she had ever had! In fact she was praising it for days which is unusual for her to do. My sister too thought it was amazing, as did I. Everyone did agreed it was the best the first two days so you might not want to make it too far in advance of when you need it--though it was still very good the cake batter had absorbed the liquids and it altered the texture.

When I did make it instead of the flour mixture I used an all purpose gluten free flour that had all of the types in it beside the almond (I think it was Bob's Redmill brand) and then I did an almond meal flour. I also increased the apple amount a smidge as I enjoy a really high fruit content and it worked quite well. I personally thought it a little sweet with the recommend amount of sugar, but I think that had my apples been a little tarter than the amount would have been good--no one else thought it was too sweet so it might have just been me.  It is a wonderful recipe and I would highly recommend it, just remember that you might want to adjust the sugar to taste and if you like a lot of apples you can get away with adding a little more to it.

Loved it! I didn't have sorghum flour so used buckwheat instead. I would use less sugar than what the recipe calls for as it was a tad too sweet (I use brown sugar instead of white).

Made this recipe today just as stated except I used gluten free baking flour and organic cocanut sugar and cocanut oil.  Unfortunately the cake came out very hard.  I will try again next time using regular sugar and see if there is a difference.  Smelled wonderful though.
