I used one box mexican rice in place of plain converted rice and equal amounts V-8 tomato juice instead of water. I also used a homemade taco seasoning. I served this with additional taco-type toppings (chopped tomato, sliced olives, chopped red bell pepper, sour cream, salsa, crushed Doritoes) and we made taco bowls. Nice, quick ECONOMICAL dinner. This would make a good filling for mexican stuffed peppers.

It was easy, and the kids enjoyed it.  When I do this again, I would add a bit more onion, some bell pepper and garlic while the meat is cooking.  It's a good base to start from, maybe some green chiles, corn, olives?  Versatile and easy to adapt to what you have on hand.  Exactly as written...it's begging to be spiced up.

Easy Taco Skillet Haiku: "We nom-nom'ed this up. Easy, inexpensive meal. Add taco toppings!" Very good but a smidge on the wet side since 2 c. of water along w/ the juice from the diced tomato can made for a little more liquid than necessary. We festooned our plates the way that we would if we'd been eating tacos - avocado, salsa, and chopped tomatoes. Colorful, cheap and easy dish win.

Used my own homemade taco seasoning, substituted 1 cup water for beef stock, added salsa, and put it under the broiler to melt cheddar. It was great! I love that it stretches the ground beef. Now my family of 5 has leftovers!

1 3/4 cup was enough water given the amount of juice on the brand of diced tomatoes I used.  After tasting, I added a small can of green chilies,  My husband and I enjoyed it like this and our teenage son liked it spooned into hard taco shells and then topped with the lettuce and cheese.

I had to use tomato paste since I didn't have canned tomatoes, and I used venison as the meat. I also doubled with no problems. Husband and kids gave it a thumbs up. It was a great recipe when all I could turn up was rice and meat for dinner!

Good, frugal skillet meal! I doubled the recipe, topped with lettuce, cheese, salsa, guacamole, and corn chips. Kids loved and hubby was pleased. Will definitely make this meal again!

It was delicious.  BUT instead of tomatoes I added Rotel, substituted Mexican rice instead of rice, and added a can of black beans.  DELICIOUS!!!

My husband made this tonight. He used a Vigo Mexican rice packet instead of converted rice (what IS that?) and less water (from reviews). He did add some salt to taste. We thought it was very good. I added some Chohuli pepper sauce and it was great! We think it would make a great burrito or stuffed peppers. I would add black beans and sweet corn, but as is, is simple and tasty! I came back and added a star after eating the leftovers several times. This is really tasty. I even ate it for breakfast!

Delicious!  
SUPER EASY recipe, however, I have a restricted diet so I had to be a bit more creative.  I can not have a lot of carbs so I replaced the traditional rice with Better Than Rice™ (pre-cooked, plant based rice). 
I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added my own seasonings of fresh garlic, a tiny bit of taco seasoning, herbs and ground pepper to keep the sodium levels lower. 
To add a bit of healthy fat, I added chopped fresh avocado. 
I will DEFINITELY make this again!!!!

I made this exactly as printed. It was great. I let it simmer a little longer to ensure the liquid was absorbed. So refreshing to have a recipe with alot of carbs. I will be making this again and again. Thank you for sharing this!

This is so easy and yummy! I used chili seasoned diced tomatoes, and a little less water than called for. You could dress this up with any toppings, make it different every time. I used the leftovers to make burritos the next day.  Easy, good, and inexpensive!

aboslutley.   Changes I made.

+Added about 4 ozs. taco salsa to skillet when I added rice etc.


+To the shredded lettuce, shredded cheese I added chopped green onion and crushed tortilla chips.  Mixed all of the above together, then topped the taco skillet for serving.  Don't forget to pass the sour cream.

Had to cook plenty of onion and add garlic to pump up the flat flavor of the taco seasoning even added a little Cumin powder to the meat mix. Added chopped black olives on top of cheese. Good dish but needs help or plain.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. Quick and yummy! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and made my own taco seasoning using the Taco Seasoning Recipe instead of the Taco Package Seasoning.

Not overly impressed. This was just bland and I'm not sure yet just what to do. The ingredients  seem to have a good  base but not balanced right and also needs some more seasoning. I'll try it again when I decide what to do with it.

Too skimpy on the cheese.  Would also benefit from garlic.  Next time I'll put it on top of taco ships on the plate.

Needed more spice. Cooked rice ahead in a rice cooker. Instead of diced tomatoes  I used homemade salsa.

Good, easy , budget-friendly and adaptable. Instead of premixed taco seasoning, I used 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 2 TBs of chili powder, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and half a TBs of corn starch. I also sautéed an onion and two cloves of garlic with the meat, subbed beef broth for half of the water and used fresh tomatoes since I had them on hand. I also found it necessary to season a little with salt near the end of cooking. Thanks for a great recipe!

Adding rice to this recipe did not appeal to me at all (although it may have been a key ingredient -- sorry). I don't think of it in 'tacos', and I was happy to cut back on carbs. I just added some homemade taco seasoning mix to the hamburg/onions while it was cooking. I made a small amount and didn't want to open up a can of tomatoes for this. Plated it up with some reserved chopped onions, tomatoes, avocado, sour cream and topped with Mexican cheese blend. A nice one-dish meal!

I won't make this again as written. It is very bland. And a waste of ingredients without significant changes in my opinion.  Lots more seasoning, maybe cilantro for freshness, don't forget all the usual taco toppings! It just kind of tasted like it came from a box.

Definitely a winner in our household.  One difference is I used precooked white rice. I added the rice when I assembled  the dish .  I added a splash of tomato juice to thin it down.

Just needed something, salsa or sour cream. Put some salsa on it and it was better but not great. Leftovers are going into tortilla wraps for something different. Added a cayenne pepper to the meat and rice mixture for some heat and fresh purple onion and cilantro to the lettuce mixture.

If you follow this recipe is ok and a little bland if you don't do some basic add on. First I did it with lean ground turkey.  Second after browning the meat, I added red and orange peppers ratio to the same amount of onions, 2 garlic cloves and 1/2 jalapeño. I bought diced tomatoes with green chiles and instead of water, I used 2 cups chicken broth.  After it was done, I added some cilantro before adding the cheese.  Then I can say it was super fantastic and flavourful with 5 stars. But follow the instructions.

Looking at the other reviews, I decided to use Ro-Tel tomatoes and green chilies and added a bit of cilantro.  I have to say this tasted great and was super easy to make.  Will be keeping this one handy for a quick tasty meal.

Probably won't make it again.  Very bland.  I didn't have converted rice so I used white rice but I don't think that would have changed the flavor.

For a quick dish this is a good recipe. Used a few spices to kick up the heat. Only because we like most eveything  a bit spicier. Served with warm tortillas and garnishes. Everyone enjoyed it. On a side note if you have not made a recipe please do not rate it. I seen this on this review and a few others. It is not helpful and unfair to the rating system when looking  for a recipe.

This is good but needs a few changes.  I added a small can of green chilies, 2 teaspoons ground Cumin, 1 teaspoon dried Oregano, and a little extra chili powder.  I also decreased the water to 1 1/2 cups.  With the juices from the canned ingredients that I used, I thought it would be too wet.  I probably should have decreased it more but it was very good.
