What a nice change from the usual enchilada!  I made 2 minor changes, I subbed parmesan for the cotija and I omitted the cilantro garnish.  This was a light but filling recipe that I expect to use often.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe sounded like a good idea, but after making it I have to say it was surprisingly delicious. Unfortunately the local grocer didn't have butternut squash in stock so I used a whole organic acorn squash (it was smaller than conventionally raised). The amount of garlic and onion seemed small so I minced 1 additional clove of garlic and probably another 1/4 c of onion. I also substituted grated vegan "monterey jack" cheese for the goat cheese. Usually I don't purchase or eat dairy products but I think the cotija cheese is essential for it's salty flavor- I probably put on closer to 1/2 a cup over the top. I rolled the enchiladas and put them in a baking dish instead of baking and layering the tortillas (ended up using 7 large corn tortillas). I may have used extra enchilada sauce- I just poured it over the top until everything was covered. I baked them at 350F instead of 400F for about 20 minutes, and they came out perfect. My boyfriend said he wouldn't have noticed that they didn't have meat if he didn't know because they just tasted like delicious enchiladas. Our meat-eating roommates tasted and enjoyed it as well. If you enjoy spicy foods you may want to add some hot sauce or diced jalapenos to the squash mixture, but although we usually like our food spicy the lack of capsicum didn't result in a bland dish.

This is a delicious combination of flavors. The goat cheese and butternut squash complement each other beautifully. Stacked enchiladas are typical of New Mexican style, except the tortillas are lightly fried or warmed in a skillet rather than baked, and then dipped in red chile sauce (not enchilada sauce) before being assembled. I made mine this way, and they came out great. Next time, I'll add more spinach and goat cheese. I can't wait to make this again!

Not very impressed. BLAND to say the least. Not enough texture, couldn't taste the sun dried tomatoes at all and cheeses added nothing.  IF I made this again I would add more garlic, a couple peppers(jalepeno) and some other spices.  Rated this a three only for the healthy factor but the time involved was not worth it.

I thought these were pretty good.  We used wheat tortillas instead of corn (heated in the preheated oven for 30 seconds each), and subbed one fresh roma tomato for sundried tomatoes because they were so expensive.  We also subbed shredded Mozzarella cheese for cojita.  I also added a bit of curry powder and dried cilantro to the onion while sauteing.  We all liked these but thought it could use more of a kick (like more curry powder or red pepper flakes), and thought it was important to use fresh cilantro and not replace with the dried spice like we did.

We made a vegan version of these by omitting the cheese and using Tofutti sour cream. They were excellent! My only problem -- I followed the directions with the tortillas, but my corn tortillas were very tough and chewy. Any advice on how to make them more crispy? Thank you!

Wow, this is delicious! Instead of doing the crunchy tortillas, I made it like regular enchiladas, rolled up and covered in sauce then sprinkled with cheese.

Parmesan works if you don't have cotija.

This recipe was simple to make and was very good.  The only step I skipped was baking the tortillas.  I doubled the recipe which drove the cost of the dish to high for my budget so the next time I prepare I will use different Cheese.

This was absolutely delicious!!!! I only had cheddar cheese and monchego and they still turned out great. I cooked the squash a little too long so instead of diced it was mush....but I added extra spinach and sun dried tomatos so there was still lots of texture. I didn't add onion because I didn't have any but it wasn't missed at all!! This is definitely a new go-to.

I really enjoyed making these enchiladas.  I especially like the directions for cooking the squash first in the microwave.  Made it so easy.  Next time I might but a little bit of salsa or spices in the sour cream to give it a little more pep.

This was fun! As a leaping-off point for ingredients I needed to use, it was perfect. Flour tortillas, done casserole style. Had to use a sugar pumpkin; roasted it in the oven. Extra onion, garlic, and added 2 chilis in adobo as others suggested. Had spinach but decided to use the kale I had instead -- love the way kale keeps its body. And unfortunately only had green enchilada sauce in the pantry, but it went with the pumpkin SO well! Hope you all try it and make it your own!

I did change a few things. First, I used 3.5 cups of spinache and second, I substituted feta because I didn't have goat cheese or cotija cheese.  I sprinkled a little bit of feta inside before I baked them. I also made my own enchilada sauce because I was out of that too! I recommend using chopped itallian tomatoes, 2 tsp of cummin, onion powder, garlis salt and peper. Season to taste. Roll your enchilladas in a small rectangular baking pan, pour the enchilada sauce over the top and sprinkle with cheese.

Interesting.  If I make it again, I'll double the cheese and probably roast the squash for a nuttier and richer flavor.  My lunch box was certainly the envy of all at work when I warmed up the leftovers!

We all loved this! You could use a little more spinach, squash and sun-dried tomatoes... maybe not? It was a "flavor explosion" as once of my friends said. The only thing I did differently was I used a salsa verde instead of "enchilada sauce" because I figured, whatever. Also, not to worry about perfect tortillas, I laid a couple flat and smash some other ones to fill up the spaces- it's just layers. I will make this again for sure. Really good!

Had to make some variations based on what we had on hand:
Substitutions: 4 flour tortillas instaed of 8 corn, 2 cloves garlic instead of 1, dandelion greens (from the back yard!) instead of spinach, mozzerella & cheddar cheese instead of goat & cotija, plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream.
Omitted: tomatos & cilantro.
Added: 1 can pinto beans.

Different from anything we've ever had, but pretty good! Would've been better if hadn't burnt the tortillas. Even our picky toddler loved it. Was not very filling though.

A very unique but delicious flavor. Made these earlier this week using ingredients I had on hand - parmesan instead of cotija cheese, and feta in place of goat cheese (in limited amounts the tastes are supposed to be similar). Surprisingly, DH really loved these too! I could definitely get used to these, and plan on making them again soon!

My fiance thought these were amazing.  I used 6 larger tortillas, 8 oz of sun dried tomatoes (wasn't sure how this compared to the 4 called for as I could only find them in weight), subbed parmesan for cotija cheese & used green enchilada sauce.  I took other's advice and baked the squash first (45 min at 375 cut in half face down).  My only change would be to use a bit less tomatoes (4-6 oz) and more goat cheese.  Very different and a great way to use squash!

What a great recipe. I was trying to cut the calories a bit so I used Lavash instead of the tortilla. I also added mushrooms to the onion/garlic and I did not use the enchilada sauce. After I baked it I put shredded lettuce, tomato and onion on the top. I put extra feta cheese and chunky hot sauce on the table for those who wanted it.

It was good- I thought it was lacking in texture and too bland for my taste. Decent meal if you are looking for something different- but not spectacular.

Granted, I didn't have a lot of the ingredients (tomatoes, enchilada sauce, cliantro), but I have to say this was NOT very good. It was weird more than anything. And I couldn't even eat it with the goat cheese on it. I don't think I will ever want to make this again.   I couldn't believe something came up when I was searching for ingredients with goat cheese and squash. So I thought it might be worth a shot!

Excellent recipe! Just added some adobo seasoning to the squash and spinach mixture. Came out great. Will definitely be making this regularly!

Long been a fan of butternut squash in Mexican dishes - the use of both goat and cotija cheeses is downright inspired!

I like to make the real recipe before giving a review. You can't go wrong with this one as is. Excellent! It is also a good jumping off point if you don't normally have some of the ingredients. I like to add black beans and a dash of cumin. I put the sour cream in the enchiladas, etc. Basically...don't be afraid even if you don't have everything perfect. It is a great recipe to work with.

We made the squash/spinach mixture but assembled 'tostada' style.  We fried the tortilla (whole) and spread a layer of the spinach/squash mixture, then crumbled on some goat cheese and some shredded mozzarella (no cojita).  We got store-bought enchilada sauce and did not like it AT ALL, so instead we put on some fresh made salsa.  Really tasty!  Great combination of flavors.

I changed a few things so I could use what I had in the fridge.  I used red onion, a little extra garlic and soft Mediterranean herb goat cheese.   I made tacos instead of enchiladas since I didn't have enchilada sauce or cotija cheese or cilantro.  I used fat free Greek strained yogurt instead of sour cream.  It has a lot of protein in it and a great thick texture.  I heated the tortillas on a dry hot pan, spread the goat cheese on it, added the squash mixture and a dollop of Greek yogurt.  Yum.

I was a bit skeptical when I was making this, as it has unusual ingredients for enchiladas and no meat, but it was delicious! I used wheat tortillas that I had on hand instead of corn tortillas and I used 1/2 cup of mexican cheese blend (with cojita and 2 other cheeses) in place of the cheese it calls for.

This was delicious! It was very easy to make (loved the easy directions for cooking the butternut squash), though I did adjust some of the ingredients. I added way more sundried tomatoes and extra garlic and extra cheese. Yum.

Interesting presentation and tasted better than expected. Used double the spinach. Could not find cotija cheese.

Relatively easy recipe.  I wasn't sure how much squash I had since I had a precut package from Costco; I figured it was closer to a whole squash, so I scaled the recipe up a bit.  Used a whole onion, tightly packed spinach (about 2.5 c), a 14 ounce can of mild enchilada sauce, and 7 inch corn tortillas, and the recipe made 6 of those.  I have to agree with another reviewer about it being a bit bland, but it's a good foundation to add your own hot sauce/salt/pepper, whatever.  Plus a good way to get some veggies in the diet!

This was the first time I've made enchiladas, and wanted to try them the traditional way, so rolled them with the filling. Instead of goat cheese, I used ricotta and mixed it in with the squash mixture. Also added some black olives that I had on hand and wanted to use up.  For a bit more spice (though I don't like too much), I added a pinch of cayenne and some Frank's Red Hot chilli lime sauce.  Added a mixture of Parmesan and Mexican grated cheese mix to the top (after pouring over the enchilada sauce.  Btw, used "Quick Enchilada Sauce" recipe from this site.)  This turned out very nicely except that the corn tortillas were so soft that it's more like a casserole, but a very tasty casserole. If I made this again, I would use more spinach, only because I really like it and it was disguised by the squash. Thanks for the recipe!

When another reviewer mentioned that her boyfriend said he wouldn't have noticed that it was meatless if he didn't already know, I was skeptical. When another reviewer said how surprisingly good this dish is, I didn't trust her. I need to learn to resolve these trust issues! 
I did alter the recipe a little bit. Instead of goat cheese, I used softened Manchego, and because I am not a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes, I subbed chopped Romas. I also threw in a scoop of hot red pepper mix Sabra--I keep it on the door of my freezer and scrape a bit out when I need to add a little heat. 
This was a huge hit. I was so excited about how well it came out, my husband was a huge fan, and my mom legitimately didn't realize it was meatless! When she heard what was in it, she was pleasantly surprised! I highly recommend!

This recipe is delicious and so unexpected! I made them open faced, more like tostadas, and only used the goat cheese, to cut back on calories. The result was super tasty! And it didn't take long to prepare at all. I bought the squash already diced, so I didn't worry about seeding and all that. Just mixed the cubes into the skillet with the onion, garlic, and spinach until it was tender. I'll definitely be making these again!

It was so different and delicious! Thank you for this recipe! Some changes we made, first we cut the butternut squash into bite size pieces, tossed them with olive oil and salt in a bowl, then roasted them on a baking pan in the oven. I was thinking sweet potatoes as a substitute to the butternut squash might be good, more firm and richer taste. I have an iron deficiency, so we also added steak that we grilled and cut up into tiny bite sized pieces. We were out of red enchilada sauce, so we used the green, nice mild flavor that complimented the ingredients without overtaking the recipe. Also, we doubled the ingredients and used larger tortillas.

I made the filling with frozen spinach and 2 fresh tomatoes diced and folded in squash that I had roasted with a bit of ancho powder and garlic salt.  I stuffed the filling into halved bell peppers and poured the enchilada sauce over top.  Covered and baked.  Only stuffed peppers my BF has ever liked and asked me to make again.

I was very excited to try these because I love butternut squash and it seemed like a wonderful idea to make enchiladas with them.  But I really feel this recipe fell down in several areas (I followed the recipe as written except for leaving out the cotija cheese because I didn't want to buy some for just one recipe).  The filling was severely lacking seasoning and needed a little more moisture.  The way the tortillas were stacked and baked resulted in a dish that was difficult to cut and eat because the tortillas became dry and somewhat rubbery.  The sauce ran everywhere and burned onto my pan instead of cooking with the enchiladas.  I would make these again but with some pretty big changes: cube the squash, toss it lightly in olive oil and a good amount of salt & pepper, then roast it in the oven.  Add in a few extra tomatoes and a little more spinach. Maybe even throw in some spices such as cumin or chili powder. Instead of stacking, put the filling inside the tortillas, roll them up, place in a glass pan, cover with enchilada sauce, then bake.  I might also swap the goat cheese for cheddar, but really only to make it more appealing to my kids, who find goat cheese to be too strong.

I wasn't sure whether I'd like a red or green sauce with these so I tried both and I can't choose, they're both so good with these enchiladas!  I'm very happy I've tried these and will make them again for sure.

Had butternut squash to use and found this recipe.  I was skeptical but figured it'd be worth a try.  I didn't want to take the time to do the tortilla stuff so I always just use the packaged tostada shells from the store (I know, they're not very healthy but they're a huge time saver). After making it a couple of times, I switched to no goat cheese and just sprinkle some shredded cheddar on top to melt.  I made this recipe with pre-cooked spaghetti squash yesterday and everyone thought it was just about as good as the butternut.  My whole family (me, husband and two twelve-year old boys) loves this, but we're not picky eaters.  This has become one of our regular meals....thanks for sharing!!!

I turn these into grilled stuffed burritos and sub salsa instead of enchilada sauce for dipping. Never would have thought of putting all these ingredients together but they are excellent!

I harvested the squash from my garden and cooked as directed with the exception of cotija cheese.  I used Tex Mex blend since I had it on hand and cotija was too pricey to buy for just one recipe.  Surprisingly good.  The spinach and sun dried tomatoes really add to this.  Next time I will add jalapenos and make it in the true enchilada form where it is rolled and baked in a dish.
