This is a healthy, versatile, and tasty recipe. We do not miss any of the heavy creams, and one may substitute westphalean ham, etc. with ease. Reheats well.

This was fantastic!! I used one egg in place of the substitute, used leftover diced sausage in place of the bacon, and loved it. This is definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've made... though I know our picky kids wouldn't give it a second glance! Wonderful - thanks so much!

I really thought this was kinda bland. Too much trouble for underwhelming results.

Not impressed at all, no flavor, very bland... And when do you ever cook the egg mixture.

I was not impressed by this recipe.  When do the eggs get cooked?  I assumed that was in the recipe somewhere, but after I started making it I realized they never do.  I added more milk and cheese and tried to cook the mixture somewhat, but it just came out nasty.  I also added more spices, but still thought it was bland.

Delicious... and pretty easy to make too.  I microwaved the finished dish for a couple minutes just to make sure the egg cooked all the way.  Next time I might add fresh mushrooms, peas or broccoli, more bacon.  A great dish.

Like others, I used this as a starting point, and used what I had on hand. Canned asaparagus, real eggs, linguini and no chives was my variation. In any case, it turned out great and even reheated well the next day.
