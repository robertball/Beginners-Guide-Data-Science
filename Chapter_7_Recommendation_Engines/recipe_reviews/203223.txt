Normally cream cheese is not one of the ingredients, but it can work to firm watery yogurt used in Europe/Usa etc.

My Turkish friend makes it with Olive Oil, chillis, salt & pepper to taste. The best and freshest Greek or homemade yoghurt; quality Olive Oil and Feta are ideal. We love it!

Wow and wow!  I made this over the weekend and simply loved it!  I make my own yogurt cheese quite often and enjoy coming across new ways to use it.  I know I will be making it again and often.  I didn’t bother with the cream cheese, just didn’t feel it was a necessary ingredient.  Thanks for sharing.
