Unbelievably yum! Made it pretty much as written, except the chick was already cooked, skipped optional garnishes, and only 1/4t cayenne, which left it still quite spicy.  Even at that, my 10 and 7 year olds happily devoured their portions, alternating bites with salad or bread to mitigate the heat!  Definitely a keeper!

This is a really delicious soup, I'm only taking off one star because I found the sauteed chicken in it to be a bit unappealing. i'm making it again tonight, but using some leftover roasted chicken in it, and I think that will be much tastier. I couldn't find chickpea flour, so I used regular all-purpose flour instead and that seemed to work okay. This soup has lots of opportunities for modifications, adding different vegetables, tofu, etc. Very yummy, versatile, and really hits the spot, and all that ginger is quite soothing especially if you have a cold.

Delicious, creamy, many flavors.  Good with noodles or without.  Will be making again, however I would double the portion.  Ate the whole thing between 2 people.

Cheers!

Oh and add pearl onions to the stock, bring to a boil as you brown the onions, simmer then follow the rest of the recipe.

Not necessarily rating this recipe. I'm Burmese and I'd like to point out that it's `Ohn No Khauk Swe` not `Kyaw Swe`.

Please make sure you aren't misinforming the public of what this recipe is.

Delicious recipe! Made this recipe exactly as stated and it came out perfect. I left the noddles separate and let people add them to the sauce based on their preference along with the toppings. Thank you for a great recipe, will definitely be making again!

I am obsessed with the noodle station in the cafeteria at work and this is one of the dishes they occasionally serve.  I wanted to try to make it myself and found this recipe.  It's not *quite* the same but this recipe is still delicious.

Other than swapping out the chicken for slivers of pork, I made this recipe entirely to specification.  The broth is absolutely to die for, although it's a stretch to call it "broth".  The sauce is very thick, because this isn't so much a soup as it is a noodle dish.  It's also extremely rich, so keep both points in mind if what you're really looking for is soup.  I've eaten it both ways, and you really need noodles of some type, and rice noodles are only one option.  It would be just as tasty over soba or ramen noodles, if that's all you've got.  Fish sauce adds a lovely dimension, so don't skip it if you've got it.  I think lime wedges rather than lemon would be a better accompaniment, but really, this recipe is excellent regardless.

Sauce was good, but waaaay too many noodles. Not sure if I'll make it again. Lots of dirty dishes in my sink afterwards.

The delicious soup deserves 5 stars, but I took off one because the rice noodles detracted from the flavor. I only used half the noodles called for, but it was still too many because they didn't pick up any of the soup flavor so just added a tasteless element to the bottom of the bowl. Do try the soup, though, and all the garnishes. The flavors blend beautifully and taste great.

Pretty delicious and interesting dish. There were a few adjustments to the original recipe. The original portion of rice noodles (16 oz.) was a bit excessive so I cut it in half. I also slightly adjusted the cooking method for the rice noodles to give it a more thorough doneness. Didnâ€™t have chickpea flour so ap flour was substituted in its place. This one is definitely worth a try!

So close to being perfectly delicious...I'm a bit perplexed by the amount of noodles called for the soup recipe...noodles went to waste.  I tried all of the optional condiments and thought they added to the dish in a positive way.
