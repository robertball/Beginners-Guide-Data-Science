This was great but for me, but I did make a lot of changes. I felt there was too much oil and not enough zing, so I added more salt, vinegar, more lemon juice, and some lemon zest. to counteract all the craisins . I would reduce the amount of craisins next time. I think three quarters or half the amount would be fine. I used whole baby kale leaves instead of regular. (I think arugula would be a good green to use as well.) Additionally, I used a yellow pepper instead of red because I just prefer them and how they look in a salad. Lastly,  before serving I threw on some toasted pine nuts and mixed them in with the kale. They were the perfect addition. Yum!

Will make again. My husband and grown son even liked it. I think next time I will add almonds for some crunch.
