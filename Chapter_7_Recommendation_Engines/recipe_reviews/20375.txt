This is a good vegan recipe.  I used sugar (and plenty of it ... to taste) instead of honey.  I also mixed whole blackberries in to the creamed tofu, and layered it with granola and raspberries.  It was easy and quick.  The end result looks like custard or yogurt, and the vegans loved it.  Me not being a vegan and not particularly a tofu fan, I thought it tasted fine, although the creamed tofu has a "unique" texture.  My vegan friends said it was delicious, and that they aren't used to eating dairy products so they can appreciate and enjoy the flavor of tofu. Hope this review helps you vegans and the people who love and cook for them. =)

I changed this recipe quite a bit, but the basic premise really helped.  Instead of apple and raisins,  I used mixed berries.  I found the tofu mixture a bit bland, and then I remembered I had 1/2 container of peach flavoured cream cheese, so added that, and it really livened up the flavor.  Instead of granola, I added some graham cracker crumbs, and voila...this was a mock cheesecake parfait and it was delicous!

I am a personal trainer and have a vegetarian client that I am trying to help get more protein in her diet.  I have never really eaten tofu before, but we tried this recipe together and I was very pleasantly surprised.  My client liked it too.  In this recipe it tastes a little like vanilla yogurt. Not as creamy, but good.

Wow, what a roller coaster ride for my taste buds! I made a few changes: I used 2 tablespoons of honey instead of 3, added 1/4 cup blueberries, for the granola I just used toasted rolled oats (about 1/4 cup), and I added lots of cinnamon spice to my minced apple. What I did: I added about a dozen blueberries to the blender to add a hint of blue to the tofu. I put a layer of 1/2 the amount of tofu in a bowl. I used frozen raspberries and blueberries so I heated those on the stovetop until it started to turn into mush. I then put the raspberry/blueberry jam onto the tofu layer. I heated my minced apple/cinnamon spice mix for a couple of minutes over the stovetop and added this onto the raspberry/blueberry jam layer. Then I layered the rest of the tofu on top. I toasted some rolled oats, mixed them with the raisins and sprinkled the mixture on top. It turned out super flavorful and exciting to eat with all the different ingredients and made a really pretty dessert. If you like sweet stuff, use the whole 3 tablespoons of honey. I plan on making this again, except next time I'll mix the raspberries with the tofu. Thanks for sharing!

Try this, even if you are new to tofu!  I served it at a dinner party, and no one guessed tofu  (which supposedly has no taste).  Very tasty and very healthy, a nice alternative to yogurt.

I did not change a thing!  (Well.. i used mixed berries because they were on hand.)  It's perfect! Great recipe!! I'm not vegan, but love to use tofu when ever I can. I brought this to a pot luck and everyone chowed down with out a thought of it being tofu!!
