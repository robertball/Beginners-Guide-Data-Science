A good base recipe and an easy way to make Risotto without all the stirring.  I made several changes: -Used chicken broth instead of water.  -Used about a cup of mozzarella -Did not use parmesan -Browned and seasoned (salt, pepper, chicken herb seasoning) the chicken first -Added salt, pepper, and herb seasoning to the mixture -Baked @ 400 35 minutes, then additional 20 to get creamy risotto texture -Added more vegetables than called for (a whole package) - it was a seasoned vegetable mixture with zucchini, onion, green beans, etc...  It turned out great with these changes.  Probably should rate lower or write a new recipe with all the changes I mad, but you get props for the baked risotto idea.

This is a good recipe to use up some ingredients around the house but it is pretty bland. I really like the creamy texture of arborio rice. I used cr. of chicken soup instead of mushroom & frozen corn instead of mixed veggies. I would also recommend browning & seasoning the chicken cubes before baking.  :)

Excellent recipe, although I did make a few changes.  I used cheddar cheese because I didn't have any mozzarella. I browned and seasoned the chicken before adding it to the mixture.  I also added salt, pepper, paprika, and dried parsley to give it some flavor.  We loved it!

After reading some of the reviews stating the recipe was a little bland, I decided to try spicing the recipe anyways but add a little spice.
Try adding:
1/8 tsp dried thyme
1/8 tsp pepper
Sprinkle some Paprika on top

If you have a recipe based on chicken and rice, and no seasoning, not even salt and pepper, it'll be fairly tasteless.  I make this with Cream of Chicken, chicken stock instead of water, and of course, salt and pepper.  Yummy!

I used Cream of Wild Mushroom soup, 1 cup of chicken broth made with boullion, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1 tsp of Nando's Peri peri sauce, 1 tsp of Worchestershire sauce. I first browned the chicken after coating them in paprika, salt and pepper. i didn't add any veggies but served new carrots on the side

Excellent quick easy meal. Not really a risotto but this is a super easy rice casserole. I will make it again. I added garlic, onions, scallions and sea salt. It did not cook in 30 min. For some reason I needed and extra 15. It is not my oven as my oven is fantastic.

Great basic recipe! I read the comments that had said that it was a little bland, so I just added a couple spices that I had in the cupboard and it turned out great! I will definitely make this again. So easy to prepare

I have to admit, I made quite a few changes to this recipe- my review is more a review of the cooking method than the seasonings.  The previous reviews talked about how bland this is as written, but I liked the idea of the arborio rice, veggies, and chicken.  I partially pre-cooked the chicken in a skillet with hot sauce, salt, and pepper.  I used cream of chicken soup rather than mushroom.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper, and oregano to the sauce mixture.  I used Mexican cheese blend instead of mozzarella.  This was a big hit and I will definitely be making again.

This is a very good recipe. The only change I would recommend is to use instant rice. Also, the next time I make it, I may layer the top with canned biscuits to make it into a pot pie of sorts.

This recipe is delicious! The rice cooked nicely and flavor was great. As a thought this is a nice recipe to make changes to such as removing the chicken if you need to make a vegetarian meal.

Very bland.  It needed seasoning other than just salt and pepper.  I would not make it again.

It's too bland, as is.  Needs salt, pepper, and a little garlic salt or other spice.  Easy to make.

I madethis dish and took the advice of some of the other reviews, making the chicken first as well as seasoning it with seasoning salt, and then I added some other seasoning to the dish itself.  It tastes good, I did have to cook it longer to get the rice done.  Thank you for the recipe
