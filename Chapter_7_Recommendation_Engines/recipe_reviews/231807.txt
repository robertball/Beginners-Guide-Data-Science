Made it as described and it was excellent.  I think this is my favorite new stuffed pepper recipe.  Very flavorful, the red pepper flakes add just the right amount of heat.  Other stuffed pepper recipes often call for cheese.  I love cheese, but this didnâ€™t need any at all.

I used extra carrot, extra cream of mushroom, cayenne instead of red pepper & added some cheese at the end of cook time. Pretty good

Next time I'll use less red peppers as it was a little to spicy for me. I also added diced mushrooms which came out nice.

This is a winner! Absolutely Delish!My only changes were to omit the carrots and add some fresh garlic and herbs and the last few minuts of baking i melted some shredded Mozzerella cheese on top of the peppers! Wonderful recipe!

Very good. Kind of a chicken rice casserole in a red bell pepper.  And the red bell pepper keeps this dish light and refreshing with a nice textural/juicy quality.  I didn't love it so much that I would put it in my monthly rotation but I may serve it again on a warm summer evening with a side salad and a glass of white wine.  
Per other reviewers suggestions, I added garlic and a few fresh mushrooms, then topped with mozzarella cheese.

I also add some mozzarella cheese, not only to the mixture but also on top. I used 1 red, 1 yellow, and 1 orange pepper.  It was awesome! My bf really liked it too, that says a lot!!
