These were very tasty.  I loved them.  My husband said there was a lot of strawberries. So, to please him, I think I would only use 1 cup of strawberries and 1 cup of blueberries next time.

The base of this whole wheat muffin is wonderful. It came out perfect. I made a couple taste changes, I replaced the sugar with brown sugar and lessened it by 2 tablespoons. My family does not like things too sweet. I also added cinnamon and only use strawberries. I was looking for a strawberry muffin recipe when I found this one. I know I made some changes but I can attest that this recipe is good to go. I will use it again.

I had a bunch of fruit that was a little past it’s prime.  I used peaches, blueberries and cherries.  I tossed them in flour before mixing in and added cinnamon to the dry ingredients.

Your recipe, while a good healthy option, was not quite low fat and low sugar enough for me. So I used 1/2 cup of Splenda in place of the sugar, nonfat milk, and one ripe, mashed banana in place of the oil. I also used 3TB of white flour and covered the strawberries and blueberries in the flour before stirring into the batter so that they wouldn’t be too mushy or sink to the bottom of the muffin pan when baking. 

When the batter was filled to full in each muffin portion it ended up making 14 muffins that rose up beautifully and were absolutely delicious! I baked the muffins for 19 minutes using paper liners. I wouldn’t use paper liners again though. The muffins stuck to the paper. Next time I’ll just put them in a Pam sprayed muffin pan and deal with the extra cleanup. 

By making these changes it also brought the calorie count from 164 per muffin to 87 calories per muffin, with quite a bit less fat and sugar.

I used only 2 cups of berries .  I found that 3 cups was too much and they didn't cook.

Love...love...love!!!  Best muffin I’ve ever had. Didn’t have strawberries or blueberries, was thinking of chopped apples but was too lazy, so made plain. Went with other comments and used brown sugar and added cinnamon. This is a keeper!

Excellent, but 2 cups of strawberries makes muffins too moist and causes the pan to burn.  Makes the house smell wonderful!!

These were some of the best ‘healthy’ muffins I’ve made.i made them as written with the exception of using brown sugar in place of the white, using only strawberries, and adding a little streusel (butter, cinnamon, sugar, flour, oats). I almost added more flour because the batter was thin, but then remembered it was whole wheat flour & they came out tender & moist.
