Tasted pretty good.  I added enough sundried tomato to equal the fresh basil, which balanced out the flavors a little.  An interesting dip but not one that I would make again.  I will pass the recipe on because many of the people I served it to really enjoyed it.

This was great!  Used it as a dip for crackers, but could be used on chicken or fish.
