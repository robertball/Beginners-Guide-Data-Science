Delicious! I used shredded potatoes and regular bacon instead of turkey (don't care for it). Instead of putting the sour cream and salsa on the inside, I served it alongside, but if I was making these to 'grab and go', I'd put it inside. These had great layers of flavor. I used the avocado on mine, but I omitted it on hubby's b/c he's not a fan of it. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I don't know how"grab and go" they are, but these sure are delicious! I cooked the potatoes and onions together to save time, and I cooked them in the bacon grease (I used regular bacon instead of turkey) instead of butter. Great weekend breakfast.
