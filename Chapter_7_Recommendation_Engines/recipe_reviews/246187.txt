This recipe tastes just like what I order from the Chinese restaurant.   I did use less chicken and added more veggies (carrots, broccoli, water chestnuts.)  You can do whatever you want with that, but the sauce is great.  I do like things spicy, so next time I will add some crushed red pepper.  (I order the same thing made spicy at the restaurant.)
