Very easy and sooo delicious. The carmelized glaze started to stick as they started to cool when removing from the foil lining, so I just put the pan back in the oven to re-warm and they came off fine!

Absolutely delicious!  I love Rosemary and probably added more, but this was the perfect alternative to sweet potato casserole at thanksgiving.  I sprinkled a little brown sugar on them at the end.

Tried these for Thanksgiving.  They were extremely easy to make.  They made the whole house smell delicious.  Everyone liked them except my husband who said they were good for sweet potatoes (enough said, not this recipes fault).  I made them and traveled with them and then reheated.  Probably better straight from the oven.  I'd make them again as they were easy and good.

This was TOTALLY delicious.  I was a little cautious with the rosemary, but next time, I'll use the full 2 tbsp recommended.  Watch your time on this, as mine were done in 30 minutes, so I didn't increase the temperature at the end.  Good and easy recipe that will be made often.

These were good. The rosemary and honey are nice flavors with the sweet potatoes. If I make them again, however, I will go lighter on the rosemary. There was a bit too much of the herb for me.

So easy and delicious.  The rosemary was a nice variation to my usual method of baking sweet potatoes. This recipe doesn’t need any adjustments.

Woah Nellie these are tasty! Use parchment instead of foil and there will be no sticking. These smell amazing when they're cooking! Everyone gobbled these up. I used about half the amount of rosemary to be safe (it can be overpowering), but next time I'll use the full amount. I also used half the amount of black pepper. This one's a keeper!

These were great!  A lot better for you than loading the sweet potatoes up with butter and brown sugar (not that that's not also delicious).  This still had sweetness from the honey, but the rosemary really added something different.  Very easy to make too.  Will definitely make this again.

I have made these several times, and everyone always has the comment 'what did you do to these potatoes?!' (in a good way, of course).  This time I opted to include chunks of butternut squash in with the sweet potatoes, and it was great.  The simplicity of this recipe makes it a real star.

Even though I mixed them up halfway through, they still stuck to the sheet, and burned on the bottom. Other than that the flavor was very good.

I really liked these, but my husband said "too sweet". Taking the potatoes out of the mixing bowl with the slotted spoon and allowing the sauce to drain is important in order to avoid burning. I forgot and just dumped the mixture onto the pan. Where there was extra sauce it started to burn so I had to take them out early, but they were still delicious.

Very, very good. I used dried rosemary since that is what I had on hand, next time I will make sure to use fresh rosemary. Will be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty.  Used 1T of dried rosemary and would probably use more honey next time.  Peeling and cutting the sweet potatos is rather tedious.  This is a nice recipe, however, there are easier ways to eat sweet potatos.

To the reviewers who said the potatoes got burnt: it's not because of the honey, but because the recipe calls for olive oil. This is a mistake. The burning point for olive oil is low. Use either canola oil or walnut oil. 

Pour the honey into a bowl and mix in the 2 T oil, then add the rosemary and 1/2 tsp salt along with 1/4 tsp of pepper (less than the recipe calls for). I cubed the sweet potatoes, tossed them in a bowl with the sauce, threw them in a parchment-lined 9 x 13 ceramic pan, and baked at 400 for 45 minutes, stirring them after 20 mns.

Turned out really good, with a bit of a glaze.

perfect way to prepare sweet potatoes! I mixed maple syrup and honey (because i was low on honey) and I only had dried rosemary so I used the full amount.  Also sprayed canola on the foil to prevent sticking. remove from foil to serving platter immediately & enjoy.

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner today. Everyone loved it, but two people thought the rosemary was too strong.  What I will do next time is lay a couple of whole sprigs across the top and later remove them before serving.  That way I can infuse the potatoes with the flavor, but more subtlety.

Made these tonight to go with salmon and rice. I think I ate 1/2 of them while waiting on the rest of dinner to finish cooking! These were so good, and definitely going in the recipe box for a make again!

This recipe sounded so good, but they came out burned even though I followed the recipe exactly.  If I try them again, I would definitely roast them at an even temperature of 375 or 400 and keep an eye on them to make they don't burn.  Very disappointing.

Making this for the 2nd time. This time I'm using canola oil,  a little less rosemary than I used last time which I used more than 2 tbs last time. I decided to use brown sugar and  cherrywood smoked salt.

Great recipe.  Made in quantity for a church dinner so a bit labor intensive but especially popular with the vegans in the crowd.  One hint- I microwaved 5 large sweet potatoes for 1 minute - then cut in 1/2” slices.  (Softens them just enough to ease slicing). Then I tossed with rosemary etc in plastic bag. Baked 30 minutes at 350. When slightly cooled I took a sharp knife and took off the skin.  Worked great.  Easier than peeling. Reheated on low oven to serve.   35 large potatoes fed 75 people with s bit to spare.

My bad, not the recipe.  I just started raising bees and this honey recipe seemed like a great way to eat some honey.  The basic combination of ingredients and 45 minute initial cook time went fine.  But instead of pulling the cubes before upping  the temp for the final 15 minutes I just turned up the temp and left the cubes in the oven.  Big mistake.  They turned out black on one side.  I’m going to make em again and do it right.

I've made this several times and  brought to parties/BBQs and it is always a hit. I stopped peeling the potatoes, no need. Just chop, mix everything really well in a plastic bag. 
Set up a baking sheet with parchment paper, spread out the potatoes flat, bake and perfection. Then I toss in a chafing pan cover for transportation and reheating as needed when I get to my final destination.  Or put in a covered dish for home serving.

First time I made these were for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  I have made them several more times and this is our favorite way to prepare sweet potatoes or  yams.  The fresh rosemary is what makes it  so good...I happen to have a plant to harvest from easily. I still like them just baked or oven fried too.

Made this as a tag along. It was my 1st time with fresh rosemary. The aroma and taste was very pleasant.  However I did not find it sweet enough for sweet potatoes. Next time will need to triple the honey.  The Rosemary kept it separate from the squash so if I did not know which was which on the table I honestly would have assumed it was squash with rosemary.

I couldn't quite crisp them in the oven at the end like the recipe suggests because the sauce started smoking but I think that was my bad for not letting more sauce drain out from the spoon prior to placing them on the pan. Flavor was delicious!!

I had an extra 2 medium sweet potatoes on hand so I increased the other ingredients by an extra half.  The were very good but a little too much oil & rosemary for me.  Next time I'll cut back on both.

These  are good. I made them last year for Christmas with a variation of adding an equal amount of Yukon Golds, less rosemary. They are all good, and those who dont like sweet potatoes, can choose. But honestly, I did not like them either until I tasted this recipe that someone made with both kinds of potatoes.  Really good.

Delicious.  Baked at 325 for 1 hour since that was the temp needed for my main dish.  Then turned it up to 450 and it was done in 10 minutes.  Nice chewy texture on the outside, tender on the inside.

This is our new favorite sweet potato recipe! My husband isn't even much of a fan of sweet potatoes but he likes this recipe, and its too easy! We first tried it at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I recommend making sure the cubed potatoes get slightly crispy before pulling them out of the oven so they don't end up too mushy.

Much less baking time is needed. Cook for 20-25 minutes and turn up the heat for 10-15 minutes. Otherwise perfect as is! I do think it's really important to use fresh rosemary. There is one other thing I did by accident. I don't actually know if it made a difference. Mine weren't sticky at all, but they were sweet, so maybe this is the trick if you're having trouble with overly sticky yams. I put together the ingredients about 3-4 hours ahead of time and left them out of the fridge and although the sauce was very thick when i first put it together, it was very liquidy when it was time to make them. I followed the directions and removed them from the liquid with a slotted spoon, then strained out the rosemary from the liquid, tossed the rosemary with the yams. These were the highlight of our thanksgiving meal!

This was a very easy recipe and delicious. I had a problem with the sweet potatoes sticking to the foil so next time I will try the parchment paper. I added a little more rosemary. I enjoy these potatoes warm or cold out of the fridge.

The best sweet potatoes I've ever had!  I wouldn't have thought to put rosemary with sweet potatoes but it was a fantastic combination.  Loved how the honey carmelized on the outside and made them chewy.  I will be making these again!

These are really delightful, and such a welcome change from the syrupy marshmallow crud that is popular at the Thanksgiving table.  The honey and rosemary are lovely complements, and unlike those other dishes, you can actually taste the sweet potato.  They're also REALLY easy, except for the cutting of the sweet potatoes.  And make sure to use cooking spray, because they WILL stick to the foil.

Absolutely delicious.  We tend to stay away from too-sweet sweet potato recipes.  The honey adds a touch of sweet, but it's deliciously savory.  The key is to cook it long enough to get the chewy, caramelized bits.  It also works great with squash.  I used it with delicata tonight and had amazing results (I think I like it better than the sweet potatoes!).

Absolutely loved these!  I steamed the potatoes a bit first to speed up cooking time.  Yummy. Oh I used yams too

Fabulous!  What a great, healthy alternative to my normal sweet potatoes with tons of sugar and butter!  The kids loved them too!  So yum!

I think that I would give this recipe 4 1/2 stars if I could.  I only give 5 stars to OUT OF THIS WORLD recipes.  This recipe is really good though and warrants a tad more than a 4 star rating in my opinion.  It is really easy to put together and very tasty.  My husband loved it.  The honey and rosemary do a nice job of enhancing the natural flavor of the sweet potato.  I did not modify a thing and thanks to a spray of olive oil on the bottom of the pan before putting the potatoes on it, I didn't have any issues with sticking.

These are delicious!  I used a little less honey than the recipe called for because I was worried about them being too sweet, and they came out perfect!

This was an easy-to-make recipe and something I'll definitely try again. The rosemary was a bit too powerful for me so I will reduce the amount used next time to strike a greater balance for my palate. Overall this is a recommended try as it has nice elements of sweet and savory.
