These were well worth the effort. I added extra basil, cilantro, lemongrass, and crushed red chili.  I mixed everything together and let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours to let the flavors blend.  I didn't have any mint and I could tell that was missing. Will definitely make these again and will be sure to have mint next time. I added a little carrot too for some crunch.

Brought these to a summer afternoon baby shower, and everyone loved them! They're pretty, light, healthy and fresh-tasting. (I omitted the peanuts, but provided peanut sauce for dipping, as well as Thai sweet chili sauce.) I used Mediterranean basil because I didn't have Thai basil, but everything else was as written, and they were delicious! Made the filling the night before, and put them together in the morning. Once I rolled them up, I covered the platter they were in with damp paper towel, and then plastic wrap, for transport to the party. They sat in the fridge like that until I sliced them in half for serving.

These are great! I followed the recipe the first time (which is what my rating is based on) and the next few times I made some adjustments for personal taste. The cucumber is great if you eat it right away. If you're making it ahead, leave the cucumber out until ready to serve or the cucumber gets soggy. I do the same with the peanuts. The mint was good, but now I leave it out because of personal taste. I also make it into a lettuce wrap if rice paper wrappers aren't handy. Finally, and food purists will think this is terrible, but I even use dried basil and dried cilantro. In the interest of economics, I never use all of the fresh basil and cilantro when I buy it, so it's just easier to keep dried on hand. I didn't tell guests I used dried and it still got rave reviews. If using dried, just don't forget to use half the amount of fresh called for. Yum and thanks!

Clever to mix the greens & dipping sauce in with the chicken. Very enjoyable alternative to the shrimp Vietnamese fresh rolls we like so much.

These were a BIG hit! I used some rotisserie chicken I had left over and since I don't care for cucumber I left those out, but I'm sure the small amount wouldn't detract from the deliciousness of this fabulous creation! The flavors were bright, the filling was substantial enough to make a portable meal (especially since the "dipping sauce" is already in the roll), and working with rice wrappers isn't difficult; just a bit time consuming (and worth the effort!).   I took them to my brother's 50th b'day party and everyone snarfed them down in record time! I am now printing out the recipe to send to an aunt - she raved the loudest and requested it. These will also be going in my lunches, since they're perfect for my tiffin tin and bentos.

This was my first attempt at making a summer roll and they turned out wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly. I thought these were easy to make and I didn't have any problems with the rice paper wrappers. I will definitely make these again.

I loved this. It's very similar to a deli product I order at a local asian market. Tasty & worth the little extra effort it takes to make my own! Thanks for the recipe!

Made these to take to work.  Everyone loved them!  I saved some to keep at home and my husband ate every last one.

These tasted really delicious, however I think there is an art to assembling them! Takes practice! Maybe next time I might add some vermicelli noodles. Served with chilli and peanut dipping sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly as is, except for substituting Thai chili peppers for the jalapenos (they're hotter, so use less of them).  I brought them to a potluck of 19 women-only 1 person didn't like them.  Takes time to make, but they are delicious.

The best "Fresh Rolls" recipe we've come across. Very, very nice! Tastes just like our favorites from the local Thai restaurant. Thank you so much for sharing.

Great recipe.  I used about 1/4 fish sauce than called for because it was all I had, and it was still yummy.  Other ideas to jazz it up--add whole mint and cilantro leaves and shredded carrots in with lettuce.

Loved this recipe because it made me try something new. Rice paper is suprisingly easy to work with. However, it was WAY too salty for me and I halved the fish sauce...

This was really good, but it was not better than the other versions I make and it was way more time consuming. We did enjoy them, but I think I will continue my quest for more ways to make summer rolls.

I got raves about these rolls.  I made two substitutions.  I didn't have fish sauce so used oyster sauce and I had regular basil growing in my garden so used that instead of Thai basil.  This isn't an everyday dish but I will certainly make it again.

My daughter did not like the taste.  She found it too sour.  I thought it was ok but don't think I can serve this to guests unless I play with the flavours a bit more.  Perhaps less lime next time?  More sugar?  More Thai basil?  I couldn't taste it as the liquid was overpowering.
I did like the idea of mixing all the ingredients together, though.  Just need to adjust the quantities of the liquid according to our tastes.
