Not happy with this salad at all.  Dressing was too mustardy, and the sweetness from the sugar made it taste weird.  I used red onion instead of regular onion (I prefer it for salads).  I won't be making this again.

We enjoyed this, it provided a great way to use the veggies from our CSA box. I omitted the sugar, and added a little cumin. Try it over spinach, or with wild rice. Also great because it really doesn't have anything in it that isn't nutritious; who can beat a dressing made from yogurt?
