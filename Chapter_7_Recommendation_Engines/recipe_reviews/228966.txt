Outstanding recipe! I totally disagree about too much cilantro. I thought that really added to the flavor. In all my years of cooking, this is the first recipe I have encountered where stems are separated from leaves and used in an earlier stage of the cooking. Great taste! Be sure to use a really ripe mango to add to the sweetness. Yum, yum, yum!!!

I liked this recipe, but I thought that a whole bunch of cilantro was a bit of overkill so I cut back on it and it made for a great meal. Thanks Eric!

I loved this recipe but I'm not a huge fan of cilantro so I used a 1/4 of what he called for and it was still fantastic!

Zesty, savory and sweet all in one dish, perfect combination of spices , who would have thought, highly recommended if you need new taco ideas.
PS there is never enough cilantro in one dish, it is all up to your taste buds (everything in your moderation)

Loved these flavors together!  Made for a great change to taco night!  I halved the recipe and it will probably give me 3-4 servings.  I thought the cilantro amount was perfect but I am a cilantro lover.  :)

Also added some lime juice  on top after cooking. Also instead of Serrano peppers I used 1 and a half jalapeños. I used extra firm tofu which stays togther better in a stir fry situation. Overall a delicious and healthy recipe!

This was really good. I just wish there was more mango in proportion to tofu. Also, i think I'll increase some of the spices next time. Half of the recipe was more than enough to feed two people (the only thing i added was shredded carrots).

This recipe sounded so crazy I had to try it. I found a peach salsa at the grocery store that went perfectly with it. Even my picky 9 year old liked them. We still ended up having a lot of left overs, I think it serves more like 6 people.
