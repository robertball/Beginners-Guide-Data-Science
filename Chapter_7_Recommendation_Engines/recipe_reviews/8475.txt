I hate to write negative reviews, but after preparing this frosting, I had no choice.  This is NOT a buttercream frosting!  This frosting tasted like whipped lard.  If you are looking for a REAL butter cream frosting, then this is not the recipe for you.

This is a great receipe, it was easy and it tastes like ice cream. I don't know what problems everyone was having but the butter has to be room temp, the milk has to be cooled and added slowly and it needs to be whipped about 10 to 15 minutes. If you make the receipe correctly it will be good! Also white sugar means granulated sugar.

I followed the recipe to a tee and this came out perfectly! It's just like the professionally-made buttercream that was on my wedding cake. One tip: My icing seemed to have creamed together after about 5 minutes, and I considered stopping beating it. However, I'm glad I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE and beat it for 20 minutes, because the consistency was much creamier and more consistent!

This is some of the best tasting icing I have ever made but, in spite of that, I can only rate it with 3 stars. I was looking for a recipe for whipped cream frosting and happened upon this. In spite of the mixed reviews, I couldn't resist.  The frosting is really fluffy and is not overpoweringly sweet at all. But I couldn't make it stop separating and I beat it with commercial-grade mixer for 25 min. Finally, I ended up allowing it to sit for an hour and then draining the liquid off (over a half cup) and beating it again.  This time it fluffed right up and stayed that way.  My family thought that it was wonderfully tasty and, in light of that, I will probably make it again.  I would be afraid to frost a cake and take the cake to a function because it really does need to be refrigerated. Also, I had to double the recipe to have enough to ice a layer cake. (Admittedly, we like lots of frosting though).

This was the best buttercream frosting I had ever tasted.  I followed the advice of some of the other raters that suggested mixing the flour and milk before putting on the heat.  I cooked it until it was starting to thicken (but not thick enough to form a ball, pourable thick).  And instead of 1 cup of sugar I used 1 1/4.  It turned out perfect and everyone loved it.  It was so heavenly that it melted in your mouth.  I would recommend this recipe and will definitely use it from now on when I want a buttercream frosting.

If I should have given this recipe a big fat 0(zero) but could not continue without a rating.  It had no flavor. If it had any flavor at all it tasted more like lard  than butter. Will never make it again.

I would like to think I'm a fairly good cook but this recipe made me feel the likewise. Nothing I did could bring this mixture together!!!  I even tried adding extra icing sugar, but once the mixer got turned off it all separated!!!

I was dissapointed with this recipe.  It almost tasted like eating pure butter and sugar.  Try using 1/2 a cup of butter and 1/2 a cup of shortening instead of a whole cup of butter.  I also found that adding the whole 3/4 cup of milk made it too thin in texture.  This recipe was a waste of my time and ingrediants.

No doubt, this concoction has a nice flavor. However, it was a disaster to work with!I followed the directions precisely and the ingredients seperated! I wound up with an oily liquid in the bottom of the bowl! I managed to scrape some "frosting" off the top and plop it onto some cupcakes, just because I couldn't bare to give up. I refridgerated the cupcakes with the blobs of goo and they turned out to be ugly and crusty. Don't waste your time and energy with this recipe.

As a beginner baker, I was looking for a frosting that was easy to make with few materials. But then I found this one! I thought I'd done something wrong, when the butter mess was floating on the sugary milk. That's what I get for not reading reviews first! Unless you want a mess....stay away!

This is my family recipe (my sis posted this).  To all with the low feedback you definitely did something wrong, this recipe is very easy but must be followed exactly as written.  It looks horrible when mixing but it does come together and makes a great TRUE buttercream frosting, it is not sickenly sweet like most buttercream frostings that use a whole pound of sugar.  This frosting tastes absoulutely phenom on chocolate cake.  We have gotten so used to all the sugar and fat free stuff  that many don't recognize a great real buttercream frosting.  Anyways please have patience and follow the recipe as written and you will have a great buttercream frosting that is NOT too sweet  to anyone wanting to refrig or freeze before you use  just warm it up and remix it, I freeze it all the time and it reseperates but comes right back together when I remix.  Actually tastes better and is even fluffier after freezing and remixing.  I do have a kitchen aide which makes it alot easier.

What a great frosting!  I never have confectioners sugar so this was great for me.  I used rice milk instead of cow's milk, and it worked great!  Everyone at the party raved about the cake...I added raspberries as decoration.  Yum!

The best frosting I ever had or made. I didn't mind that it took a little planning and time to get it perfect because thats what this frosting is, perfect. I put it on a banana cake and it was a wonderful combination. I would recommend this frosting to anyone.

At first I thought this recipe was a horrible practical joke.  I was beating and beating and it stayed seperated and horrible looking.  I persevered and, suddenly, the whole thing came together.  You have to beat for at least 20 minutes to get that to happen.  It may have been the colour of my butter, but it was a very pale yellow colour so I couldn't use it to ice the outside of my cake.  Instead, I used it between the layers.  It's got a melt-in-the mouth texture and my Lady said that it tasted like sweetened cream.  After refrigerating, it held the cake together well.

This was a disaster and a waste of ingredients.  It separated, never formed a true frosting, and I had to throw it out and find another recipe.  Don't waste your time and money with this one.

This is very good tasting. I beat my egg whites stiff, and let my milk cool and used room temp butter. I mixed for 13 minutes and it was like velvet. I even used food coloring and had no problem!!

This is a very tasty recipe, however, it is extremely rich.  I could not finish the piece of cake I put it on.  Also, it gets hard when chilled, so if you're going to put the cake in the fridge, take it out a little while before serving.  Otherwise it was good though, I'm definatly saving this recipe.

I was somewhat disappointed in this recipe.  Unlike a lot of reviews, I actually found it quite easy to make -I used my kitchenaid mixer (I can't imagine using a handheld mixer for 20mins).  It looked terrible for the first 10 or so minutes of mixing, completely separated and chunky, but eventually it came together nicely.

My issue is the taste: prepared as-is it tasted like sweetened butter.  I ended up adding half a cup of powdered sugar and it was a bit better, but I would not consider it the "Best Ever" buttercream icing recipe at all.  I'll be trying a different recipe next time.

This recipe was great, not too sweet and very creamy. Loved it. Used margarine. Perhaps with butter will upgrade to 5.

This is not a recipe for someone who wants a quick frosting. While it's simple to make, I find that few have the patience to do it correctly. I've made this frosting a number of times and always recieve rave reviews because it does compliment a number of cake flavors without overpowering them. If it tastes like lard or butter, consider adding another drop of two of higher end vanilla extract. Also, you'll need to use real, unsalted creamy butter to achieve the best taste. if you're using margarine, I'd advise you to try it again with butter! I have really enjoyed this recipe on a light and fluffy banana strawberry cake and then zest lemon on the top of the frosting. I find it to be refreshing and delicious.

I am no professional but this frosting turned out amazing!! When I poured the milk in it was slightly warm still which I think help prevent things separating. The butter also melted some which i thought was going to do me in, not so much. Tabbed in my favorites forever!!!

My 12 yr old found this recipe and decided to make it.  She made me stir the milk to a boil, whip up the egg after beating it for only 1 minute, we cooled the milk in freezer and added the other ingredients and it looked like a soupy lumpy  mess.  She started to mix it and got impatient and put on the cake, then whined that it was "too sweet and watery".  I removed the icing from the cake and put back in the mixing bowl, and after mixing at high speed for at least 10 minutes, like magic, the icing took on a creamy light consistency and tasted absolutely fabulous (and looked much better, although she had put food coloring in it to make it lavender).  So she learned to "follow directions" and it was well worth it, although interrupting my evening t.v. shows multiple times for "help"!!  Yummy!!

ok this frosting was the best when i first made it, but WARNING! Don't throw it into the fridge for use later on. I did that and it turned hard. I tried to fix it but it just wasn't the same. It looked like cottage cheese after....

I found this recipe to be disasterous! After I mixed all of the ingredients as listed, it was very runny and would not mix well. After draining some of the milk off of the mix, it then began to take a thicker consistancy only to end up tasting like a batch of bland marshmellows. I do not recommend this recipe.

I don't know what went wrong, maybe I added the milk before it was completely cooled or maybe i did not beat long enough(I beat with a hand mixer on high for a REALLY long time) but it just never took the consistancy of icing. It kept seperating and had the consistancy of curds and whey. Sorry I really hate to give a bad rating.

The best frosting I ever made. I use it all the time. My friends and family love it. Have given the recipe out many times. Never had any trouble getting it to blend together.I mixed it for about ten min. and the texture was perfect.

this was great!  I'd never made frosting before, and was ready to give up on it, thinking that I'd done something wrong, because it was looking curdled all the while I was beating it, but then, like magic, *poof*...  it became thick and creamy.  Glad I waited those extra two minutes!

excellent excellent frosting, however, it did take a bit of time adding more and more confectioners sugar to get the perfect consistancy.  Overall, a great recipe.

Read all the reviews (all 109!) and decided to give it a whirl. I liked the simplicity of the ingredients as well as the fact there wasn't loads of sugar. I used coffee cream instead of milk but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Turned out great, did not separate at all. Perhaps because I made sure to beat the egg white until peaks formed, added the sugar slowly and after letting the cream cool, added it slowly as well. Used a handheld mixer and beat for about ten minutes. Turned out perfectly, exactly what I wanted.

WOW!!!! I made this exactly per the recipe (white sugar is granulated).  It is amazing!!!!!  So super creamy and, as another review said, is like ice cream.  Not too sweet, it's perfect!  It does take a little bit of time, but is well worth it.

I only made this recipe b/c it didn’t require powdered sugar. It tastes okayish…but more like fat/butter than frosting. After 20 minutes of mixing it looks like frosting, but it's a strange oily/fatty/slimy consistency. Takes too long to mix and the results aren’t worth it.

Have always made the long version of  true butter cream frosting.  This recipe is great! And the taste
is right on. Best made with a standard mixer, not
a hand model mixer.

Wow best frosting ever. You have to follow the directions to a T but well worth it. Milk must be no warmer then room temp and butter no softer then room temp. Thanks for the awesome find!

This is the best butter cream I have ever used. Even out of all the butter creams I made in baking school, this is by far the best. It does take quite awhile but it is worth it.

I decided to try this recipe in spite of the bad reviews.  I'm glad I did.  It is a fantastic frosting recipe!  Not overly sweet, and so light and fluffy.  I believe the key to this recipe is to follow it exactly.  Make sure to cool the milk completely after heating it.  Also make sure to beat the egg white long enough - I beat it for 5 minutes.  The frosting did look disgusting for the first 5-7 minutes of beating - then it started to go together and formed a light, fluffy and delicious frosting.  I will be using this recipe for years to come.  My only suggestion  would be to use a stand mixer because holding up the hand mixer for 15 minutes killed my arms and shoulders!

I'm not a baker, in fact I barely cook, and I got this frosting down on the first try. I followed the instructions and it came out perfect. My family loved it! I think what helped is that I beat the egg white for a really long time until it was almost foam. And I beat the mixture for over 20 minutes. Truly is the best ever butter cream frosting!

First my daughter and I read all the reviews.  We concluded that those who made it correctly really really liked it and those who didn't, didn't like it.  So we rolled up our sleeves and made it.  It is super smooth, melt in your mouth silky smooth.  It has just the right taste of butter.  Even though this recipe calls for granulated sugar, if you are patient and whip the entire 20 minutes, it totally integrates with the other ingredients and makes that creamy, even though one only uses milk, smooth, buttery yummy frosting!  I like it!!!

looked great till i added the milk, i think the amount of milk is too much everything separates, i was able to just poor out the liquid from the bottom and whipped great after that.. make sure to stop adding milk once it has the consistency of frosting...

I had some bad luck with the egg whites to start with but my mixer is the cause of my bad luck........second attempt was fine after I chilled the bowl and beater. End result was a light fluffy frosting with a high gloss finish like that of royal icing. The flavor was light and delicate and perfect. I did mix for 20 minutes with the Kitchen Aide and was pleased with the results. I did not experience the curds as previous people had commented. Overall I really like this frosting.

This frosting is better than I had ever tasted. It is so light and fluffy. 

At first I was a little aprehensive because of the time it takes, but I decided to go with it anyway. I don't regret it! All you need is your time and your dedication to the instructions. It's as simple as that.

I tried this and it turned out perfectly. I let the milk cool and added it slowly as one other gal mentioned and as for the taste, its not bland but its delicate and so I think this frosting is for cakes that have a delicate flavor too so as not to overpower them. I followed the instructions exactly and at precisely 20 min I had frosting. I didnt have any white sugar so I pureed some brown sugar into powdered brown sugar and I had a very nice and interestingly flavored frosting, albeit a slight brown color. My family liked it.

This taste very good but I could never get it to set up....  We even tried it twice in the same night...the first time it wouldn't mix and the second time we got it to mix but wouldn't fluff...it's just a liquid in my fridge.  I am putting it in the fridge to cool and whip again...we shall see what happens.

I am not a baker by any means and usually am the type that uses store bought icing but after trying this icing and having no problems at all with it,I used a hand mixer and the milk was still a little warmer then room temp. I will for sure use this recipe again.
I also added a little almond extract to give it a little more flavor.
It was wonderful and the whole family loved it.

I read the reviews, and took into consideration all of the helpful hints. 
Before I added the milk, the icing looked beautiful. I thought to myself, "Hm, I must be one of the lucky ones. This may turn out good." Then... I added the (cooled) milk. It turned into curds and whey. I remembered reading that someone else had a similar experience but after longer whipping, it turned out fine. This was not the case. I whipped for a very long time and still, curds and whey. Then I tried mixing it on high (kitchen-aide massive mixer); still, curds and whey. 
This recipe seems to be a coin flip as to whether or not it will turn out well. I would suggest looking elsewhere.

I followed this recipe exactly - except using store boxed egg whites and it DID NOT come together no matter how much I beat the icing.  I had to trash it and go back to the old faithful butter cream recipe on the back of the 10x box...

I must say, after reading all the negative reviews, I almost didn't try this recipe...  But I decided to give it a try, and I didn't have any problems at all...  I CAN see where some would get frustrated when you add the milk...  It DOES get "curdley" looking...  But if you just stick with it and let your blender do it's job, then it DOES come together into one of the best frostings I'VE ever made!!  I don't know if I would have the patience to stand there for the amount of time to blend it all together with a hand blender, but my Kitchen Aide was wonderful!  It's a delightful frosting that my husband even loves!  I'll surely use this recipe again!

This recipe is great tasting, but only if made correctly.if you add the milk before it is completly cooled than the frosting will curdle, and if you mix it long enough than it will not be runny as it will thicken up....

This icing was thin and slimy. We followed the directions precisely, and thus wasted 20 minutes of our time beating it.  On the bright side, we probably saved thousands of calories by not icing our cake.  Enjoy (if you dare)!

Easy enough for a four year old to make (with a little help). It was very fluffy and not too sweet. You have to beat the egg whites first. We cut the butter and sugar directly into the peaked egg whites with a pastry cutter and then beat it some more on high. Added the cooled milk and beat it another ten minutes or so. 1/3 recipe was plenty for an 8" round tin.

I followed the recipe exactly, and this frosting is obviously too much of a hit or miss risk - I don't know what it is to have such greatly differed results between people. I used an electric hand mixer on high speed for over 45 minutes and it still didnt fluff up - it was stuck oily and separated. I remember my stand-up mixer back home has a "cream" and "frosting" setting on its highest power (very, very powerful at this setting). It could be that the recipe turned out to be a big wastefull mess for me because  My little hand mixer might just not have been powerful enough to create frosting. I would only try this recipe if you have a powerful stand up mixer.  I'm going to continue my search for a less heavy, more fluffy frosting.

This frosting was great, I made it for a flag cake for my 4th of July party. Everyone loved it! I made it because I whipped the cream I was going to use into butter and made this as a last ditch effort.  I followed the recipe exactly and was worried about half way when I stopped the mixer to check on it and it looked like a separated mess.  I decided to keep on blending hoping it would pull together, and boy was I glad.  About 10 min later it all of a sudden whipped right into perfect frosting. It really does take 20-25 min of whipping to get it right.

I LOVE the flavor of this frosting. I did have a hard time frosting cake. It got hard in fridge but I still put on cake. I put on "Mystery Chocolate Cake". I will make this again for sure!

I'm afraid that as it's been a long time since I've baked from scratch I had forgotten that the milk would have to be cooled completely.  Perhaps a mention of cooling might have helped (sorry) never did get to taste, it basically looked like scrambled eggs!

Good thing you said it took 20 minutes to cream up. I thought I had a disaster on my hands. But it finally came together and tasted great. A little hard to spread. I like the cooked recipe better I think. I was in a rush so this did the trick.

This buttercream frosting came out a little bit greasy The only reason I gave this recipe more than two stars was because I was able to rescue it by adding about a good handful of flour.

I tried this recipe. It separated and didn't come together at all. I would not recommend this to anyone as a frosting. For everyone who had this problem, put everything into a pot as is. Everything will melt and come together, but will be liquidy, which is normal. Check from time to time by putting a very, VERY small amount into a cup with cold water. When it forms a soft ball, add a few scoops of peanut butter or a few handfuls of chocolate chips and melt together. Put into a heat-safe pan. This recipe makes a better fudge base than frosting.

I too, was a bit disappointed with the recipe.  However, I also had to change the servings to expand the recipe.  It turned out well, by appearance...until I tasted it and it was indeed very heavy on the butter side.  I have not had any problems with changing serving sizes in the past, with any recipe except this one.  I may try it again with less butter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

I use this exact same recipe ALL the time. The only thing different I do is add 1 tblsp of flour to get it to form. And just keep BEATING it! That the key! My ingredient amounts vary slightly. I use mine when I make Gobs!

Thanks for the review with the suggestion to add powdered sugar. Overall I would say, too much work/ time for average frosting.  Without the addition of powdered sugar I would agree with the suggestion to put on cookies.

I made this because it doesn't use corn products.  My family loved this recipe.  The only change I made was using a touch of almond extract along with the vanilla.  I used my KitchenAid mixer and followed the directions as written.  It takes a long time to make it but really worth it.  I was able to do basic piping of a shell border and name writing with it.  A keeper for sure!

I'm so glad I made this before I needed it.  I followed the directions exactly, and after adding the milk, it never came back together.  After whisking on 10 for 35 minutes, its still a lumpy, watery mess.  Not sure what the secret is, but if you could maybe put it in the directions, so we get more than 1 step...that would be great!

I thought the recipe was easy to make.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out fine.  My only complaints are that it doesn't make much (next time I'll double it) and it's not as fluffy as I was hoping it would be.  But I don't think it tasted overly buttery like lots of people said.

I'm on Team 'NOT' with regards to these reviews.  It's just too much....butter.  My brother stated he would rather spread it on a ham sandwich.  Yes, a classic bakery buttercream is very very buttery, but it's sweet and thick.  This was neither.

I burnt up my mixer trying to get it to thicken up. I mixed it for over an hour. I had to add confectionary sugar and cream cheese to be able to thicken this recipe. I'll never attempt this again.

Perfect buttercream. The milk must cool completely for this work. So good. And it's wonderful for decorating too.

I'm not a fan of cakes because I don't like sickly sweet icing.  This was the best icing I've ever tasted (other than whipped cream icings)!  I will definitely use this again and am more inclined to make cakes.  I did boil the sugar and milk together for a few minutes until it thickened slightly and the resulting frosting was easy to work with.  It is a very light frosting and am not sure how it would work in a pastry bag.  Excellent!!!

I've never made butter cream frosting before. I had all of these ingredients handy, so I thought I'd use this recipe. I'm not sure why you have to beat it for so long, but it turned out so well. It tastes really good and is really creamy. I added a teaspoon of creamy peanut butter and it was delicious!!!

i gave the cupcake to my sister... she said it tasted like foam...  it's just not good. i tried fixing it by adding more vanilla and sugar. but it didn't work. it's just really bland and needs some flavor and better texture.

This frosting was wonderful. I made it exactly as the instructions stated and it turned out like beautiful, professional butter cream. I think that the KitchenAid is key to this, I'm not even sure if I could have gotten it to work with my hand mixer. Either way, great recipe, very rich and very yummy.

If you follow the directions exactly, the texture will come out perfect.  I only changed a few things: i reduced the butter by 1 tablespoon (but could have done a bit more,) i beat in about a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar at the end, and i added some more vanilla... there was too strong a strong butter flavor.  Just remember to beat the everloving crud out of it for as long as the recipe tells you to... it will change from curdled to light as air.

This was a disaster! I chose this recipe because I didn't have enough confectioners sugar for most butter cream recipes. I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a globby mixture that kept separating and tasted like sugary butter!   I managed to save it though! I had to use the following ingredients, which sadly turned this into a chocolate frosting to cover the taste of butter;  1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 cup confectioners sugar 2-4 tablespoons cream cheese (to taste)  I wouldn't suggest this recipe to anyone who doesn't know how to save it. Good luck!

This was awful. I was so excited to make this for my friend's birthday, and I prepared an amazing chocolate cake base, and I cried because this frosting came out so awful. I don't understand how this is even classified as a frosting.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out pretty good.  It was a little greasy though.  I saw other reviewers who said it seemed curdled, mine did too until about 10 minutes into beating it with the kitchen aid.  I beat it for the whole 20 min and it came out pretty fluffy, still greasy though. EDIT: Okay, i wrote the review for this recipe after i just tasted the frosting in the bowl.  I went ahead and used it (thank goodness) and filled my cake, then it sat in the fridge overnight before I put the fondant on.  This frosting came out so perfect for filling cakes!  Once in the cake, it completely lost any greasiness it had in the bowl.  I can see myself using this frosting for most of my future cakes.  I also think this will be a good base recipe that will lend itself well to other flavorings, besides just vanilla.

After reading all the bad reviews I had to try this recipe just to prove I can do it and sure enough it came out perfect, really flufy and tasted perfect not too sweet just right. I'm sorry for all of you that didn't get a good result, I follow the recipe the only change is that I cream the butter with the sugar for a little bit and then added the whipped egg whites to it and continue the rest of the recipe.

i just got done making this frosting five minutes ago. i'm waiting for my butter pecan cake to cool down :) this frosting has a pretty good flavor, although it was not what i was expecting. i think i might try a different recipe next time, but overall it is still a good frosting.

This was ok frosting. A little buttery, but other than that pretty good. You do have to whip it for at least 15 mins and it really helps to beat the egg white first. I will probably make this frosting again.

It did turn out for me, but I found the flavor just so-so, and the "mouth feel" a little greasy.  My family did not care for it at all.

I really regret not reading these reviews first.  This turned out soo horrible!  I tried making this recipe.  What a waste.  It never even resembled any frosting that I have ever seen.  I beat the stuff for 25 min but to no avail.  It was still clumpy and yucky.  I will not ever try this again.

This recipe is wonderful. Though the frosting is rich, it isn't too sweet. I usually hate frosting - way too sugary - and this was really excellent. I will certainly make it again.

This recipe tasted like buttercream frosting but it never fluffed up. I had the mixer on full blast and let it beat for 10 minutes and it never fluffed up. There needs to be some clarification whether or not the egg white needs to be beaten before adding it to the mix.

Does "white sugar" possibly mean powdered sugar?  Because let me tell you, white sugar with this recipe looks like a science project.  I managed to save the separated liquidy mess by adding about half a bag of powdered sugar.  What a loser recipe.  My poor kitchen aide worked its little hiney off for nothing!  My husband said throw it away, but I put it in the fridge just for the experimental value of bacteria growth rate tracking.
