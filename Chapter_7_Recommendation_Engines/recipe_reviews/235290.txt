11/9/13 - I created this recipe after having a lot of squash on hand and peppers that needed to be used up.  AR added my footnotes to the description listed above.  I tried freezing a dish, thawed and reheated.  It reheated great, just a little thinner than the original dish.  I hope you enjoy this soup.

I loved the soup however I did make a few modifications.  I roasted the squash in the oven at 450 cut side up so it carmelized a bit.  As a result it was quite sweet so the sugar was not needed.  Would definitely make it again - maybe with some curry spice next time.  Didn't find the peppers all that hot - may put in more next time.  Added some garlic as well.

I love this soup! I threw in some left-over squash that I cooked in cinnamon that had some cranberries in it and it still turned out lovely! I put in a little less sugar than the recipe called for.

SAVORY VERSION: I used about 6 or 8 cloves of garlic, black pepper and twice the butter. I didn't have poblanos or celery, so I used two large jalapenos and an Italian pepper I had on hand. When I finished making it, it was still missing something. So, even though I didn't want to add the sugar and have it sweet, I added about a tbs of honey. That didn't add any real sweetness, but added the something I needed!

I thought this was ok.  I was expecting more of a punch from the peppers but didn't think it was all that spicy. To be fair, I probably have a high tolerance to hot peppers and jalapenos, to me, are on the milder side.

I love Winter squash soup and this is one of the best recipes I have tried. I used extra Jalapeno peppers, because mine are not very hot and I didn't have poblanos on hand and don't care for that taste anyway. I also used a brown sugar substitute to reduce carbohydrates in the recipe.

A bit more of heat than anticipated... But that was a great surprise!
