I uppped the flour in this recipe from 3 Tbls to a little more than one cup. I did this because I had made the buttermilk IV recipe and it was way too custardy and runny. I was trying to find a recipe that was more of a spongy kind of pie, from a recipe that I loved at a Utah restaurant. Anyway, upping the flour turned this cake into a recipe of its own, so maybe I will post it seperate.

Wow! This is like creme brulee pie! I followed directions exactly except I used a deep dish pie crust and increased cooking time to 70 min. Make sure you wrap the crust edge with foil so it doesn't burn. After you take the first piece soak up syrup in pan with a paper towel and there should be no more seeping. I found this to be spectacular after being refrigerated for a few hours. The best pie I have ever tried!

The most helpful review of this pie shows them altering it to add a cup of flour?! This is ridiculous. The buttermilk pie was runny because they didn't incorporate the ingredients properly. This pie has a lot of liquid, so you have to be careful. Buttermilk pie looks easy, but that's because the ingredients are so simple. It takes technique to combine. Start with room temp. ingredients, and make it easy on yourself and do the first 3 ingredients first and blend well. I melted my butter instead of softening it and it came together much better. When adding the eggs, do one at a time and make sure its incorporated well before adding the next. Then the buttermilk and vanilla. Overall, not a bad recipe for buttermilk pie on this site. It is one of the best out of the 5 others I've made and reviewed on this AR. The baking time should be tweaked, as with all custard pies you can partially blind bake the pie shell, or bake it on the lowest rack for 400 for 10-15 min to set the crust and then lower to the posted temp. until it's set. This easily prevents soggy bottom crust. Buttermilk pie is done when it doesn't jiggle. Don't overbake the pie. It's not supposed to be dark brown on top. Who likes dark brown scrambled eggs? Ew.

This pie is deeelish!  I've made some minor adjustments.  I only used 1 cup of sugar and used 5 tablespoons of butter.  I also didn't use a pie crust and it turns out beautiful.  I added some whipped cream and blackberries. Thanks for great recipe!

This pie is really good!  I made several during the Holiday season and they really went over well! I have never made one of these before, so I don't know if this is normal, but after you cut a piece of pie, a clear liquid drains into the empty spot eventually.  So I started putting a piece of a paper towel there to absorb it.  The pie is delicious.  Use a deep dish crust.

First of all, this recipe is silly easy to make.  I had been trying to make a buttermilk pie on and off for literally six years.  I would follow the recipe strictly, but the pie would always come out too runny, no matter how long I cooked it.  Finally, one of the reviewers on here pointed out that they accidentally misread the ingredients, and the pie came out great.  Then another reviewer wrote that she deliberately altered the recipe in one key way to make it less runny.    What I did was follow the recipe included except for three things: I used 3 tablespoons of flour instead of 3 teaspoons; I used 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 1.5 cups, and I also added maybe 0.75 tablespoons of cornstarch to the buttermilk I had, since it was 1% fat buttermilk, and I wasn't sure whether all buttermilk was supposed to be that low fat (this was also suggested by one reviewer).    I ended up baking the dish for around 60 minutes or so, and the center came out perfectly no runniness at all, even after cutting out one of the pieces.  Good pie, and it takes about 15 minutes to put together, especially when you use a store bought pre made crust like I did.  Try it!

I had leftover buttermilk from an Irish soda bread for St. Patrick's Day and searched for buttermilk recipes. TGhis was my first introducation to buttermilk pie. Great recipe. I also made my first successfull pie crust and the filling fit perfectly. I followed the temp and cooking time and it was golden brown with a thin, sweet and crisp top to the pie. I did use lowfat buttermilk so I dissolved 1 tsp. of cornstarch in the buttermilk before adding it. I really want to try it with egg beaters and margarine but I'm sure it won't be the same. My husband LOVES LOVES LOVES this recipe just as it is. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutly the BEST buttermilk pie!  I was a bad girl!  :-)  I didn't tell my children what was in the pie.  THEY LOVED IT!  Now at my house it is called Custard Pie.  They will NEVER know.  :-))))

Dee-licious.  I made this pie for a dinner party, with 1 cup of white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  My friends had never eated buttermilk pie before and were astounded by its amazingness.  Thanks, Linda!

Delicious.  Very sweet pie, but really good.  I'd never made a buttermilk pie and wasn't sure how it would turn out.  The kids really liked it and it was amazingly easy and quick to make.  Definately shake the nutmeg on top.

So great! I have eaten buttermilk pie my whole life, and this one is as close to my aunt't as I have ever had! I used a regular 9-in. crust (not deep dish) and used up all the batter...so maybe all those other people were using 8-in? Well, it's REALLY good!! Thanks!

This is a wonderful buttermilk pie recipe, almost identical to the one my family has baked for years.  The only difference is the recipe (which I can't find!!!) that my family uses, cooks about 90 minutes, but for the last 30 or so minutes the temperature is reduced (maybe even turned off).  I'm happy with this recipe though.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't really care for it. I remember living in the TN. and granny making buttermilk pie all the time. Maybe that's my problem is. I compare good O'l home recipes with a twist of something that granny left out on purpose. Thanks, it was worth a shot.

I had never made a buttermilk pie before, and this was a very easy recipe to follow.  I didn't make any alterations (okay, a tiny bit more vanilla).  Prepared in a 9" pie crust.  I held a little bit of the filling out, b/c I thought it would overflow.  Next time I'll put it all in.  It would have been fine.  The pie went fast and people were scraping the crumbs out of the bottom of the pie pan.  I'm making another for Thanksgiving with our family.

I had some leftover buttermilk to use. This was awesome....loved by everyone at my party. Based on other reviews I did add a 'handful' more of flour. It turned out perfect. I will make it many more times. Quick to prepare....a lil long on the bake time, but well worth the results.

Great recipe.  Easy and Yummy.  I followed it as written and it turned out so good.  I used a frozen crust and did not thaw the crust before baking the pie.  After baking I let it cool then refridgerated the whole pie.  We ate it the next day, almost at room temp.  Was not runny.  Great custard texture.  Will make again, THANKS!

I love buttermilk pie, but we melt the butter over low-med heat then add only 1 cup sugar and flour, then gently whisk into buttermilk mixture. Create a foil tent over the prebaked crust and batter. Bake at 350 for 45-50min.  It comes out perfectly. Spongey and not runny at all.

I made this for my mom on mother's day and she really liked it.  I cooked it a wee bit longer than 60 minutes.  Mine didn't darken alot, possibly due to the small sprinkling of nutmeg.  I may use a tad bit less butter, but I loved the buttery, sweet, slightly tangy flavor. I will definately be making this alot.  Its soooooo easy :-)

I had never made a buttermilk pie so was delighted when this one was so easy and tasted great.  Reminds me of an egg custard recipe that I've used for years.  I will probably add the lemon flavoring that someone suggested when I make this again.

I shouldn't be rating this as I don't like custard type pie but the hubby said it was wonderful.  I too cut the sugar and had to cook a little longer.  It was an easy pie to make and I will probably add a little coconut next time.

Oops...I goofed. This is a wonderful, old-fashioned pie. I made it yesterday, and when I came back today to rate this recipe, I realized I made a mistake, but it worked well. I added 3 TABLESPOONS flour, and mixed it in after creaming the butter and sugar. Then added the remaining ingredients. My pie turned out great, very custardy, and I have had very minimal liquid run-off because of the extra flour. No floury taste or consistency, however, and I think that's because I creamed the flour into the butter/sugar mixture thoroughly before adding the eggs, vanilla, and buttermilk. I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks!

This was by far the best buttermilk pie recipe I have ever tried.  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it...my friend took it to his boss's house for a Thanksgiving party and it was a huge hit.  Only change is that I recommend using deep dish pie crust like some other users had recommended.  It was soooo good.  I doubled it and made 2 pies and they are gone after less than 24 hours.  Am making another one tonight for my Dad!

**Edited to update: 11 years later and this pie is still a staple recipe in our house! That "friend" I made it for to take to his boss' party is now my husband, haha...and he and my dad both LOVE this pie. It is gone so fast I have to make 2 at a time.  Our 5 yr old refers to this as mama's "sugar pie" haha. This has become a favorite family recipe for sure! Comes out perfect every time!**

Made one today, made one yesterday - both perfect. Thanks for the great recipe! - Eggs room temperature. Butter WAY softened /partially melted (it was sitting on the stove). Mixed ingredients together in proper order - cream the butter and sugar together first, etc.  Followed the recipe exactly (well, i used a 'soup spoon' for the flour - 3 soup spoons of flour - ha - that's what i grabbed out of the drawer, and I didn't measure the nutmeg, I lightly sprinkled it across the top of the pie.  I've made more than a few Buttermilk Pies from recipes on this site and this one is my fave.  I finally determined that I prefer my Buttermilk Pie without lemon juice.  Since discovering these last year, I have made at least a dozen of them, following the different recipes on this site, and not one of them has ever turned out soupy. I am FINALLY getting over my fear of discovering I have cooked an 'Egg-Soup Pie' when I open my oven door. I am not a "Pie Whisperer" - however, I do live at a pretty high altitude (5,000 ft) which causes some baking issues, but not for this kind of pie, in fact, the altitude is probably what makes this style of pie turn out perfectly every time (word to the wise).

I used all purpose gluten free flour, poured directly into shallow Pyrex pie pan and topped w/cinnamon. Co-workers loved it! I've made a second one (see posted pic) for a co-worker native to southern TX that said this pie was part of his childhood. I'll keep you posted to see if it passes muster with him.

This was my first attempt at making a buttermilk pie, and it actually turned out well; the only problem is that it tasted exactly like a regular egg custard pie. So while it was still good, I was a little disappointed; I was looking for something a little richer, with a little more flavor.The only change I made was reducing the sugar slightly, to just over one cup, after reading the other reviews.

Great tasting pie. But, I put too much flour in (9 tbs) because of what other reviewers had said, and it was a bit fluffy towards the top. Being Australian, and not having tried any when we traveled through the South, I don't know what Buttermilk Pie is supposed to taste like or what its texture is supposed to look like. So, I can't say whether this is supposed to be a true buttermilk pie. 

Regardless, I loved it and will try again, but this time using 3 tbs and using a deeper dish (as I had way too much custard).

Easy! Quick! Tastes Excellent!  I used store bought packaged crusts to save time.  Everyone loved these pies!  Did not change a thing. Made as written. Will definitely make again and again and again!

Delicious!! took the pie crust recipe from the "all-american apple pie" recipe you can find at this site (that crust is scrumptious.... and extremely easy!!)
Added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract and reduced the amount of sugar to 1cup, even after that i thought it was too sweet, even for my sweet tooth. Also cut back on butter, what's more, i had to use margarine because i run out of butter but it still came out good. I even had to make my own buttermilk since here in Spain it's impossible to buy it (mixed 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1 cup milk together, plus 1/2 teaspoon corntarch...). Thanks for the recipe, sure i'll be making this again...

Used 2% buttermilk and cinnamon instead of nutmeg, but it was delicious.  I did have to cook slightly longer, but that could have been my oven.

yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!!!  This was so easy and turned out amazing!  I forgot to put the nutmeg on top, but it still tastes wonderful.  I also used a deep dish pie crust which I think you'd have to use to hold it all.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This came out firm and a bit spongey on top but not rubbery or runny at all.  As suggested, I melted the butter (5 Tbsp) in a saucepan then added the sugar (1 cup, which was plenty ) and 3 Tbsp flour, took it off the heat and mixed it well. To 1  1/3 cup buttermilk , the eggs and vanilla I added the zest of one lemon, a pinch of salt and a 1/4 tsp freshly ground nutmeg, plus sprinkled some more on top. Pre baked the crust (about 10 mins) and let it cool down before adding the pie mixture, which by this time was close to room temp. Covered the crust with foil and baked at 400 degrees - by accident - for ~15 mins before I realized the oven should have been set to 350. Lowered temp and Baked  for another 20 mins or so. It cooked quickly (again, room temp ingredients) and tasted flavorful and delicious with the extra nutmeg and the addition of zest.

Oh yum. I was concerned when I pulled it out of the oven because it was still fairly liquid, but after chilling, it turned into the best, creamiest custard. Easy to make AND this good? Oh yeah.

It tastes pretty good. I used a store bought pie crust mix. It did seem a bit too sweet to me, but if you like really sweet then don't change it. As for the flour amount, some reviews said it was supposed to be 3 tablespoons instead of teaspoons, others said it was perfect the way it was, so I just doubled it. After 60 minutes of baking, the center was still very runny, so I baked it another 10 minutes or so, and in the end it was fine.

I am wondering if the amount of flour in this recipe is an error? Most of the other recipes for buttermilk pie on here call for 3 TBSP of flour. Perhaps that is why one reviewer's pie turned out soupy? Anyways . . . I made this exactly as written EXCEPT I put in 3 TBSP flour. (instead of 3 tsp). It turned out perfect!

This tasted way better than I expected.  I thought I might like it.  I loved it.  The top had a slight gritty/crunchiness to it, reminding me of creme brule.   I cannot wait to make this for my father.    In my opinion, it is too much for a regulat 9" crust but not quite enough for a deep dish.  I chose not to use the whole batter and made a regular crust pie.  In the future, I will double the recipe and use three pie shells.  This is definitely a keeper.

This pie is spectacular.  Really different texture, like a cross between custard and mousse, but absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend is not a big dessert guy, but he absolutely loved this pie!  Great warm or cold, especially with some fresh berries.

very good!!! i had never had buttermilk pie before and decided to try this one.  everyone loved it!  I did increase the flour from 3 tsp. to 2 tablespoons and it set up wonderfully!  I also covered the edges of the pie crust with foil before baking to prevent it from browning too much.

For some reason, the crust stuck to the pan, I don't usually grease the pan for pies, but maybe this one needs it?

Turned out absolutely perfect and delicious! I made the recipe to the letter, not changing a thing, and I couldn't be more pleased. The only hard part is keeping a straight face to get your kids to try it before you break the news there's buttermilk (ewwwww) in it. Some adults, too. But once they've got a bite of it in their mouths, they're sold.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful.  I have made it several times according to the recipe, and I have also added 1 cup of whole pecans to it right before baking and created a delicious alternative to pecan pie without using corn syrup.

This was the first buttermilk pie I've ever made - and it tasted great! I did cook it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe suggested, and there was still a small pool of clear syrup in the pie plate after I'd taken a slice.  I'm not sure if there's a way to prevent that.  All in all, very tasty!

very good pie! I made this last evening and we ate half a pie. Very rich maybe too sweet but still very good. I bake mine a little longer as I saw previous raters mention. I baked it for 1 hour and ten minutes. Once it sits after baking it dries up a little more making a perfect texture.

Deliciously sweet.  It came out just a bit runny so I recommend another 15 minutes of baking or so.  The slightly crusty top adds to the flavor...yum.

I followed the recipe to the letter, but wound up with 1/3 a cup of the liquid left over after I filled the pie to overflowing (deep dish shell too!) It was good, very sweet, but funny looking as the nutmeg kind of darkened as it baked, cracked and split so islands of it floated away on the butter. I had to get the turkey baster out to suck up all the butter oozing out the top from the middle. We ate it hot, and it reminded me of eating pure honey from a spoon with the sweet taste lingering in the back of my throat. I might make it again because it was very easy to make, but I don't think i'd make it for company because the looks, and texture leave a lot to be desired.

My kids loved this recipe. You do have to make sure your ingredients are well incorporated otherwise it will be runny. I did increase the flour to three tablespoons.

My family makes this and we call it country custard. I have found that butter does not set up properly and that is the reason we have always used margarine. Also we put it all in the blender on high for 3 minutes. Bake at 400 for 10 minutes then turn down to 350 for another 40 minutes just like pumpkin pie. This solves the runny issue that many have commented about. There is no need to increase the flour just change how you bake it.

The same as many others, I made this because I had buttermilk to use up.  I had no idea what it was supposed to taste like.  Some mentioned that it was better the next day when it was thoroughly chilled, and I found a taste difference too.  The first day, when it was just barely cool, I had no idea what to compare the taste to.  The second day I thought it had more of a cheesy taste, and my daughter said it reminded her of cheesecake.

The pie was easy enough to make, and I would strees that the ingredients should bee at room temperature.  I liked the thin crispy crust on top and the hint of nutmeg.

I may make this again if I have leftover buttermilk, but I probably  wouldn't  make it otherwise.

First of all, that 94 year old lady in Arkansas is a freakin' genius.  I wanted/needed a quick pie recipe for Christmas and I don't think I could have found a better recipe.  I cheated and used a store bought crust.  Everything about this recipe is perfect for fast, tasty and convenient.  The only tip I'd give is that I put the nutmeg in earlier in the process so it blended with the eggs and sugar.  The resulting pie has a delicious "egg nog" flavor.   Other than that, my only suggestion is bake it on a cookie sheet.   I'm not sure what went on in my oven, but I think early on a little of the custard bubbled over and the cookie sheet was a happy accident.  Thank you for a delicious recipe!

I had to bake this for longer than called for. The center was still quite jiggly, so much so that I thought it was ruined, but I put it in the fridge to cool and it set up nicely.  I'm not sure how I like the flavor but I don't attribute that to the recipe, I think I'm just not a huge fan of buttermilk.

Top poster is right about adding a little more flour, but 1 cup does indeed turn it into a new recipe (more spongey ...cake like, almost)  next time i will limit it to half a cup, with the full amount of buttermilk.

After reading many of the reviews, I used 3 Tablespoons of flour, but I will not do that next time.  I will follow the recipe exactly.  The extra flour spoiled the custard texture and made it more solid, opaque, and "cakey."  However, I did not have any sogginess, like some writers, so maybe the extra flour fixed that?  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a glass pie pan with an inside top diameter of 9.5 inches.  The pie turned out less than one inch thick, including the crust, which I think is too thin.  Next time I will use a smaller pan.  This recipe is very easy to make.

Delicious! My pie only needed 45 minutes in the oven. I used a 6" granola pie crust and reduced the sugar to one heaping cup and the butter to 1/4 cup. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making again!

I LOVE THIS PIE however I cut the sugar down to 1 and 1/4 cup. Perfect! Putting on my winter weight. Getting the high grade (full fat) buttermilk makes a huge difference in taste,  1% will not due. BUTTER!!!!!!!

I had some buttermilk I needed to use up and I came across this recipe. The recipe is so simple and the finished pie was so delicious. I loved how the top got a crunch to it, surprising texture with every bite. Loved it!

W-A-Y too much sugar, half would be plenty and cut back on the butter.

This is a really good recipe! I used only 1 cup of sugar and about 1/2 cup of flour to prevent having a runny pie. Modifications made the pie perfect!

I've made this before but I added  1/2 cup of Gooseberry's. I have a 4yr old grandson who loves this pie. He's a little sour puss.

Creamy and delicious custard pie.  Did use 3 TABLESPOONS of flour and no issues with setting up.  While a deep-dish pie pan is probably called for, I guess mine was a little too deep as the filling ended up being nearly an inch short of the rim.  Oops!  Still tasted great, though.

I usually make fruit pies and so this one was really different for me. I had left over buttermilk from pancakes that I wanted to use up. After reading reviews I used 3 tbsp flour and only 1 1/4 cup sugar. It turned out really really good. Not runny at all and it was just sweet enough. My 16 yr old daughter ate 1/2 the pie! Thanks.

I used Benecol(R) instead of butter, Splenda(R) /Sugar Blend(use half as much as in recipe), & low-fat buttermilk. Also used a deep-dish pie shell. Very easy pie to make. Smells & tastes like a delicious custard pie. (Keep it in the fridge & use a paper towel to soak up excess liquid after first slice.)

This is a very sweet pie and delicious! I think it tastes better chilled - it's still sweet but it's much firmer and the sweetness isn't overpowering like it is when the pie is still warm from the oven - you can taste the buttermilk, butter, eggs better once it's been chilled. Only thing I did differently was 1) I used a deep dish 9" crust and the filling fit perfectly and 2) I used 2 TBSP flour instead of the 3 tsp.  Also, I know alot of people melted the butter first but I didn't. I just let the butter come to room temp so it is soft and then I just creamed the butter and sugar together.  Also, I did bake it for 70 minutes at 350.

This was my first try at a Buttermilk pie, and everyone loved it.  I enjoyed it too, a very old fashioned style pie that is plain but good.  To enjoy the flavor of the filling, don't go too heavy on the nutmeg.   This would also be good with fresh raspberries or blackberries added into the filling when baked.

Very easy to make and smells INCREDIBLE when it's baking. One reviewer called it "Creme Brulee Pie" and it does have a thin, sweet crispy crust like creme brulee.  I was expecting a custard pie, but this is a more dense, syrupy pie, similar to pecan pie in sweetness and texture. If you're expecting a CUSTARD pie, this isn't it. It was a bit sweet on its own for my taste, BUT ... when a covered a slice in fresh strawberries and unsweetened whipped cream, it was SPECTACULAR! The combo is just perfect ... sweet pie, tart berries, unsweetened cream ... like the best shortcake ever. :)

This was delicious and just what I needed.  Since moving from Austin and being 8 months pregnant, I was craving the buttermilk pie from Hoover's Cooking (a Southern cooking restaurant in Austin).  This tasted pretty close to their spectacular buttermilk pie but I think the key is to add a little nutmeg or cinnamon into the pie and then sprinkle more on top.  If anyone knows the exact recipe from Hoover's - let me know!  I did have to bake this 70 minutes like most of the reviewers said and it turned out perfect.

What a pleasant surprise!  The best way I can describe this is a cross between creme brulee and custard pie.  Everyone loved it!

My kids went nuts for this recipe! I did misread the directions and used 3 tablespoons of flour instead of 3 teaspoons. When I realized my mistake I just crossed my fingers and prayed since it was already in the oven before I noticed. My oven runs hot and is touchy, it burns everything that bakes for long periods of time so I made a tinfoil tent and baked at 325 for an hour (which would be 350 in most ovens) the middle was still soupy so I jacked it up to 350 (375 for everyone else's oven) and baked it another 20 minutes. It should be a custard consistency throughout when done. I also added cinnamon, I couldn't help myself no pie from blueberry to buttermilk is complete without it in my mind. I've never seen a pie slice disappear so quickly in my house. Next time I will make baked cinnamon apple slices to top and maybe some whipped cream to garnish.

I thought this pie tasted wonderful, just needs a few tweaks. I thought it was a little too sweet, I think a cup would probably do it.  I also thought it was a little too liquidy. I may add 2 TB of flour to see if it is a little thicker. I also think I will bake the pie crust first before putting in filling. Maybe that will help with the soft crust. I think the author must have forgot to add some steps, because it does not turn out perfect.

I made this pie last night, reducing the sugar to 1 cup (unless you really, really, like overly sweet stuff, I can't imagine wanting the additional 1/2 cup--I thought it was still verging on too-sweet with only 1 cup).  I was pretty happy with it, with the only hesitation being that I thought it was a little too spongy.  Then, I come here to review it and I realize that it said 3 teaspoons of flour not 3 tablespoons like I put in.  Oops!  So maybe it would be more custard-y if I hadn't done that (and more what I was looking for).  Otherwise, one of the simplest recipes, yet tastes good.  I used a deep-dish crust and thought it could have used more filling.  I used a buttermilk crust from the Pie and Pastry Bible.  Yum!  Only 5 stars because even if I had made it correctly I don't think it would have blown me away.  However, people at work are going CRAZY over this pie.  They are already asking me to make it again.

Followed recipe exactly and it was really good.  I could really taste the butter flavor, might cut that back a little if you don't want a lot of butter flavor.  My father loved it for his birthday and said it tasted better than the kind he got at his favorite place.  This was my first Buttermilk pie, so I don't know how they're supposed to taste, but it was good!
