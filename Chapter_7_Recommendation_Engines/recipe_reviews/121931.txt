I made this recipe with my kids. We used equal amounts milk chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips and Reese's peanut butter chips. I made no other changes. These are DEADLY. My husband and kids cannot keep their hands off of them. This is an amazing little recipe. I bet these would be great with chocolate graham crackers. EDITED: I made these AGAIN early this morning and I'll tell you, I literally cannot make them fast enough. My husband has been raving about these since I first made them!

Wow this little gem hit the spot. I was having a raging sweet tooth today. I didn't have semisweet, but I had some caramel/milk choco swirl chips to use up. Good stuff and simple, my kind of recipe!

Very easy and good! I used 1/2 c. dark chocolate chips and 1 c. chopped pecans. They tasted best completely cooled. IMO :)

My mother-in-law gave me a similiar recipe with the same name years ago. The only differences from this one is I put 10 graham crackers in the food processor to make the "meal."  I add a small bag of semi-sweet morsels (I like Nestle's toll house) and add 1 tsp. of real vanilla to the meal in a bowl. I grease and flour the pan. The rest is the same. They are always a huge hit!

Yummy!! Great for my boys with their egg allergy!  I didn't have chocolate chips though, I only had butterscotch chips and I used 1 cup of marshmallows instead of the nuts. The marshmallows make it a little tricky to check, just make sure it doesn't wiggle when you take it out. We all loved it! It came out great and I can't wait to make these for our friends!!

I made this for my 5th graders class for a project on California.....We called them "California Gold Rush Brownies." They were soooo easy to make. I whipped up the dough in my kitchen aid and didnt realize how stiff the batter would be....you'll be surprissed! The kids in his class LOVED them! He even needs several copies of the recipe for students and his teacher. Very awesome recipe! Thanks!

Very nice flavor.  These bars have a chewy texture, quite similar to Magic Cookie Bars.  They are quite easy and quick to prepare and I will make them often.  Thank you for the recipe.

My family has been making these since at least the 70's.  My grandmother's handwritten recipe called them "Vi's Cookies" because she got the recipe from her friend Vi.  No nuts, rolled in powdered sugar after cutting, and only at Christmas!  Can be doubled for a 13X9 pan.  I line my pan with parchment  so I can lift out the whole thing for easy cutting.

YUM - talk about a good brownie, and this one only has 4 ingredients!  This was the third brownie that I made for a sundae bar.  All three were completely different from one another and this one really stood out for me.  I found it amazing that only 4 ingredients and no eggs could taste this good.  It was nice and chewy and cut beautifully with a plastic knife.  The texture of this brownine would hold up very well on Christmas platters, and it is different from the regular chocolate brownies.  Definately found a keeper with this recipe.

This recipe deserves 5 stars for ease and little ingredients, but probably 2 stars for overall taste and texture.  I just wasn't a huge fan.

I thought they were amazing, but I gave it four stars because everyone else in the family thought they were just okay. To me the flavour was perfectly balanced, not too sweet with the chewy-ness I love! Yumm!

These are very good. Instead of Graham cracker crumbs, I used vanilla wafer crumbs and they still came out fantastic. They taste great both ways I just like to switch every now and then.

These are easy to make and quite tasty too. First bite I was unsure but they definitely became addictive. Very rich, a small bite goes a long way!  I used fat free sweetened, condensed milk and it could not tell a difference in taste.  Next time I may add some coconut or roast the pecans.

Soooo easy!  This is the first time in my life where I turned the oven on to preheat, and then the mix was made and in the pan waiting to go in before the oven was done preheating!  And the taste is really good too.  Easy to substitute whatever yummy things you like.  As long as you have the graham crackers crumbs and the sweetened milk, you can add anything else you like - mint chocolate chips, coconut, cranberries, pb chips, whatever.  Vey happy with this recipe, it's a keeper...

Quick, simple easy bars to make.  I needed something a little different to take to work and this recipe did the trick.  Not saying its a recipe I would rush back and make time and time again but made a great one off treat.

We've used this recipe for years with butterscotch chips added in as well.  Just making a batch now to send to my son who is a soldier in Afghanistan.

Well...i made this recipe over the weekend...it was okay.  I didn't love it, but then I didn't hate it. It was too dense due to the Graham Cracker Crumbs. If it hadn't been for the chocolate chips I probably would of hated it.  We warmed it up in the microwave and placed ice cream on top of it.
