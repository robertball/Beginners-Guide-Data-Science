Melt shortening and then cool? This is why some of you had a problem with it. ALWAYS have ALL ingredients at room temperature, including eggs and liquids!! Cream shortening or butter with sugars until smooth and creamy. Then add eggs and mix well again, then other liquids and mix well. Mix all dry ingredients in a separate bowl and then add 1/3 or less at a time to the wet ingredients and that's how great cookies are made, as well as all muffins and quick breads too! The old cookbooks used to explain this, but, alas, that info isn't included anymore and new bakers don't have this info. My daughter just made this same mistake because the recipe she used didn't give step by step info like they used to! No matter what the recipe says, this is always (in my experience) the way to perfect baking! I hope this helps!! Great recipe otherwise!!!

Excellent, crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  Perfect spicyness.  Not a fan of using that much shortening, so I used 1 cup shortening, 1 stick of butter and it turned out sooo good.  Once the shortening/egg mixture cools, it does get pretty stiff, so using an electric mixer with a dough hook is ideal or else you'll get a nice work out.  I chilled my dough for only 2 hours and it was plenty.  This dough crinkles beautifully and this recipe makes a lot of cookies.  I used walnut sized dough balls and yielded a little over 3 dozen.  I tested my oven with a thermometer to check the temperature accuracy, and it was.  375 degrees at exactly 9 minutes made soft, chewy cookies.  Will be my master recipe from now on.  Rivals the bakery ones - and so easy to make.

Excellent recipe. This makes a perfect cookie. Hint for those who found the recipe tough to deal with due to being sticky: Make sure you allow the shortening to cool completely (until it starts to turn white again) before adding the sugar and molasses. Also after combining all of the ingredients together store it in the fridge overnight.

Delicious! I used butter rather than the shortening. I took them out of the oven at about 9 mins, as I like a softer cookie.  They have stayed soft and still taste good four days later.  I will make these again.

Fabulous!!! I made a couple of changes.  I only had butter so made them with butter versus shortening.  I also made a mistake and didn't allow the melted butter to cool. This made for VERY soft dough, so I had to add about 1/2 cup of flour.  We rolled them in red and green sugar for Christmas.
I big hit in my house.

This was a huge hit over the holidays. I had several different people with several different tastes raving over these cookies. I was worried at first because the dough was a bit dry but I guess that's what it's supposed to be like. They turned out great and I'd love to make them again. I suppose I should...

I doubled the recipe (not knowing it made 6 dozen to start out with) and they came out amazing. I also made many of them a smaller size as well so people wouldn't feel bad about eating so many as they are delicious! I live and work on a farm, and everyone that I live and work with had eaten them all by the end of the day.. Thank you for the wonderful recipe- I will definitely be making these for the holidays and share this recipe. :)

They bake nice and look nice but you have to really like molasses and cloves to like these cookies. My husband couldn't even finish one cookie. I tried to acquire a taste for them but no luck. I let a couple of friends taste them hoping I could give them away. Also no luck so I'm sorry to say that they are now in the garbage.

I would give these cookies a million stars if I could! Followed the recipe exactly except I I got impatient and only chilled the dough for an hour or two. Came out perfect - moist, chewy, and spicy.

These were very, very good. I used butter instead of shortening with no problems. I also substituted brown for white sugar. I froze the dough for two days, then kept it very, very cold between each baked batch by keeping it outside in the Utah winter! I used a tablespoon size ice cream scoop to form. The dough was just a little sticky, but not any stickier than other cookie dough you roll. Perfect baking time for me was 9 minutes on parchment paper, which makes cleanup a breeze! The cookies were crispy around the edges and soft everywhere else. Nice recipe, thanks for sharing it!

Thank you thank you thank you!!! for posting this recipe. For the past couple of years I have been bringing in baked goods to my work around the holidays and this particular cookie was this years winner. It is so delicious and chewy and perfect that I plan on making it every Christmas. The only problem is that I think this cookie is to blame for the 3 extra pounds I gained around the holidays. Anyway, a little  time consuming but well worth it. Do Not Alter The Recipe!!!

I reduced the spices significantly since I wanted molasses cookies, not spce cookies.  They came out quite flat, very flat.  'Not used to flat cookies.  :)  Keeping in mind I halved the recipe, these are my measurements: 1/4c each butter, margarine, shortening; 1c brown sugar; 1/4c molasses; 1 egg; 2c flour; 1/2 + 1/8t cinnamon; 1/4t ginger; 1/8t cloves.  Also added 1t vanilla.  Only problem I had was their flatness.  'Kinda messed with my mind - expecting flat cookies to be crisp instead of chewy.  Good tasting, but didn't wow me.  Too, they spread a good bit even after refrigerating so two & a half inches is probably a good distance between 'em.  Made 4 dozen, about an inch round of dough each.

Excellent recipe.  I've used this recipe for two years now around the holidays and it always turns out perfect.  The cookies stay chewy and yummy for weeks.  A crowd pleaser.

I can't seem to bake these fast enough - my kids LOVE them and they pair wonderfully with a cup of tea!  I like to wrap the dough in saran wrap and chill overnight - it makes the rolling much easier and cleanup is a breeze!  The only change I make to the recipe is to use butter rather than shortening - we avoid partially hydrogenated oils at all costs.  Having made the cookies both ways, I prefer the butter.  Be sure to reduce the salt if using salted butter!

These cookies are excellent! I've been making them for about 2 years and my friends and family ask for them again and again. The recipe makes a lot of cookies so I love to make a batch, put them in the freezer (they freeze beautifully), and take one or two out at a time to have with tea. Delicious!

I just got done making these cookies. WOW! The dough is beautiful and easy to work with. The taste is fantastic. I used half butter and half shortening, and thats the only change I made. I used a scoop and all the cookies came out uniform and beautiful. I loved making these. I will be sending these cookies the a friend stationed in Iraq and I know he will love them too.

These cookies are so good they make my mouth tingle! They are so yummy with coffee or even a bit of vanilla ice cream. They are so rich and gooey on the inside, sweet and slightly crisp on the outside. My only suggestion to anyone who hasn't tried this is that if your dough feels firm before you put it in the fridge, don't put it in the fridge for long. I left mine in over night and it took an eternity to roll into balls! However, it was well worth it as these cookies are excellent. Easy to make, yet when someone tries it, they will think you are a baking master! Thanks so much for the fantastic cookies!

I made these cookies using butter instead of shortening. I found that using my convection oven setting, I only needed to bake the cookies between 6-7 minutes or they would burn. The flavor was delicious!

I was looking for a new cookie to make around Christmas time.  I tried these, and my family loved them!!  Even if they are not rolled in sugar-they taste great.  We double the cloves!!  Great cookie-I am on Weight Watchers - 4 points - but worth saving up points for!!

These are a favorite.  Sometimes I don't roll them in sugar, and they're great that way too. I use blackstrap molasses and very fresh cinnamon.

Great recipe!  I used red and green sugar, and colored sprinkles on some to make them festive looking.  Big hit with the family.  I liked that they didn't have to be rolled out.

I'm not sure how the recipe is without the following changes but I made these changes per some reviews and they were FABULOUS! 1} Take 2 tablespoons of the half cup of molasses away and replace it with honey. (I figured it would add more depth to the total flavor) 2} Substitute half of the white sugar with the same amount of TIGHTLY packed brown sugar. (makes a chewier and richer cookie /makes up for the missing molasses) 3}I doubt this made much of a difference but I used half unsalted butter and half shortening. Just a personal preference over all shortening. The dough is really stiff so have a mixer or be prepared for a little workout. The refrigeration isn't really necessary if you just use softened fats instead of melting them.  Make sure to really keep and eye on these as they cook QUICK, The SECOND you see the edges just START to brown, take them out, even if it still seems doughy, I promise they will set and be wonderfully chewy once they cool down a bit. If you see my photos, I baked mine about a minute TOO long this time.

Absolutely delicious, my husband loves soft molasses cookies so I always added milk but that makes them more like cake. He liked these and so far they are still soft.

Excellent.  Since I am not a big fan of shortening, I used 3/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup shortening.  Left everything else the same.  I baked mine for 10 minutes and they turned out crispy on the outside and soft inside...just the way we like them.  After the first batch, I put a couple drops of water on top of each before baking to get a more crinkled look.  Definitely will be making these again.

These cookies are wonderful! My husband isn't crazy about molasses or gingerbread type cookies or cakes, but loved these cookies. They stayed soft & chewy for over a week, kept in an airtight container. The recipe didn't state light or dark molasses....I used light & they were yummy! Other than that I did't change a thing. Just be sure not to overbake! Eight minutes seemed to be perfect if left on the cookie sheet 1-2  minutes after taking them out of the oven.  This is a keeper!!!

I made these for a cookie exchange party. I needed seven dozen so I tripled the recipe and came out with 17 dozed, wow!!! But everyone LOVED these cookies. They are wonderful, time consuming due to the refrigeration process but really easy to put together, decorate, and bake! Thanks for the recipe.

I have made several recipes off this site, but never take time to rate them.  This recipe turned out so awesome I just had to.  I've been searching for a recipe as close to my husbands grandmothers as possible.  He loved this one.  I'll never make any other molasses cookie recipe again.

I've used this recipe for years.  The only thing I do different is that I sprinkle the tops of the balls with water right before baking and bake for a chewy texture, 8 - 10 minutes.  This creates a crinkled cookie.

This is one of my favorite cookies. I always get asked to make these for Christmas cookie trays at work. Just the aroma of them baking reminds me of winter and the holidays but they are good year round. I use my cookie scoop to form them into balls and they go quickly when I am in 'baking mode' during the holiday rush. The dough can also be made the day ahead and refrigerated until you are ready to bake.

This is a great spice cookie, even for me though I don't usually appreciate that sort of thing. We didn't have any ginger, so I used pumpkin pie spice in place of all the spices. I also tried to roll and cut these into shapes, but that didn't work out-- the cookies ballooned (my three-year-old though it was magic: the gingerbread men turned into snowmen!) But the cookies tasted great anyway.

My husband asked for "soft ginger cookies" like his mom used to make for Christmas.  While she was looking in her files, I found a ginger cookie recipe from this site that was very good:  chewy, but very flat, and not exactly like the cookies my husband wanted.  I finally got the recipe and made it...and now I find the recipe posted here!  It is fabulous. The dough is very stiff, but it is very managable if using a stand mixer.  The only difference was that my recipe didn't indicate that the dough should be chilled so I bake them right away.  The dough was not at all sticky as I had feared, but rolled very easily into balls.  I baked for 9 minutes, and they came out perfect with chewy centers, crispy edges, and a beautiful crackled top. They were very lofty just coming out of the oven, but did fall some as they cooled...but they still weren't as flat as the other recipe I tried.  I used butter flavored shortening and have eaten entirely too many of them already!

Really good!!  I like that you can have your choice of a chewy or crunchy cookie depending on the cooking time.  I have family members that like both so I do half and half when baking.  Beware that this is a real stiff dough so either use dough hooks for the final mixing or do it by hand.  My mixed burned out with it! lol  I wanted a new one anyway.  Family and friends all raved and will become part of the Christmas cookie tray year to year here.

These cookies have a lot of flavour. The only thing I did't care much about this cookie is that it turned out really flat after it baked. I prefer a thicker cookie. Other than that it was very tasty. My son loved them as well as my hubby. If I can't find another recipe that makes a thicker cookie I will continue to make this cookie, it tasted that good and I think I can get past the flatness of it. LOL.

simply wonderful. Soft and chewy. I have an old recipe that is the same except you don't melt and cool the shortining. I really can't tell the difference but it only takes a couple minutes to melt in the Microwave so why not. I like that it made a lot of cookies.

This is an excellent recipe!! The only change I made was using half sugar, half Splenda for the required 2 cups.  I baked them for 8-9 minutes because we love our cookies chewy!!  They were very chewy, although, I think crispy would be good with a cup of tea or coffee, too!!  Thanks for a great recipe; a new addition to my recipe file!

I did not like cookies that much., but that is probably because I do not care for molasses. Cookies came out nicely after baking, but I did not care for them. Thanks anyway.

THese turned out great!  I used a course sugar to roll the balls in before baking.  Kind of made them look sparkly.  I crave these spicy cookies and could eat a batch myself!

Everybody loves these cookies.  They are gone the first night. I roll them in green and red sugar during the holidays.

I am so glad I tried this recipe!  Moist and chewy, with the perfect amount of spice.  The dough was so tasty; a large portion of it never got to see the inside of my oven.  Delicious!

I made these according to the recipe except for cutting the cloves in half (don't like a strong cloves flavor). As to the shortening, it says to melt & COOL , add eggs, sugar & molasses and beat well. You let it cool to room temp so it doesn't cook the eggs. Beat it well and it becomes smooth and creamy.  These cookies are fabulous! Adjust baking time for chewy or crisp. It makes a LOT of cookies, using a 2 Tbs scoop I got 4 1/2 doz cookies. Because of this I divided the dough  in half, adding plumped raisins to one half. Some I rolled in sugar, some I didn't. My husband declared them all delicious and I have to agree.

This is the exact recipe our family has been making since 1942, so that gives you an idea of how much we love these cookies.  About the shortening - it’s very important to the chewiness of the cookies.  I melt the shortening and allow it to cool down but I don’t allow it to become completely solid again before mixing in the sugar, molasses, etc.  If you chill the dough thoroughly it won’t be sticky to handle and the cookies won’t spread as flat.  Be sure to remove them from the oven as soon as they show some crinkles on top and the edges are set.  I’m pretty sure our family will still be baking these cookies 50 years from now.  They are sooooo good!

Delicious!  That being said, I didn't melt the shortening and then cool it.  I just mixed the shortening and sugar, then mixed in everything else.  No ginger in the house so I used allspice - very nice tasting cookies.  Baked for 10 minutes and they were the perfect texture!  Thanks!

If I could give this six stars I would.  I don't like gingersnaps at all, but these are in their own category...soooo good.

This recipe is the best! Easy too. I've made the other one with the butter and this recipe turns out crispier. This is now my "go-to" recipe for molasses cookies

This recipe is really good! Crispy edges and chewy middles. There is no need to melt the shortening and then cool it. Just cream together with the sugars. Also, I always crank up the spices for cookies like these - that's the only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars, otherwise, it's a 5-star recipe. Either way, this is a great recipe (I just don't like giving a recipe five stars and then listing a bunch of changes I made).

The cookies didn't spread at all! They looked weird and tasted salty.  Would use all butter next time and pinch of salt only.

Seems to be a foolproof recipe.  I made them twice this holiday season, and they always turned out soft and chewy.  I added 3 chunks/chips of dark chocolate inside.  It is a delicious flavor combination.  These were a big hit!

Amazing cookies. I have never made ginger cookies before and was looking for the perfect recipe. My family gave them an A+!
