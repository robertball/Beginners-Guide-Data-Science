This was a great recipe, a nice change from plain old mashed potatoes. The only thing I will change next time is cooking the carrots a little longer than the other items. Other than that this recipe is a keeper!

We used parsnip instead of turnip, and added 3/4 cup of sour cream. So yummy, we had them at a table of 10, made a double batch, and had none left at the end of the meal, with requests for them to be at our Thanksgiving table. Thank you.

These were so good. The only thing I changes was using evaporated milk instead of plain.  One of my guys that I cook for won't eat mashed potaoes, but he loved these.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great way to make mashed potatoes less guilty! I thought we'd kind of have to choke it back, but I was wrong - it's wonderful and tasty!

I loved this recipe. The only changes I made were that I subtituted the turnip with 1/4 of a head of cauliflower. I also added chicken bouillion to the water that I boiled the veggies in. Very flavorful!

I did not know that mashed turnip can be so good...I thought I did not need as much butter as suggested in the recipe. though. I mixed in minced persely at the end to make it prettier.
Good side dish.

I liked the proportions of turnip, carrot, and potato.  Boiled onions didn't appeal to me so I just boiled the vegetables without the onion, mashed them with the butter and milk, then added caramelized shallots instead of onion.  I didn't need as much milk as it called for, I may have overcooked the potatoes.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe of combined root veggies is French Canadian, Nova Scotian and probably a simple dish prepared by all frugal folks with only root vegetables in their cold cellar during the winter.  Your version is great, Jill and you're right, everyone can find their own favourite combo.  Thank you for submitting your recipe.

I loved this delicious change of pace from mashed potatoes. I will make this again - for sure - using different combinations of vegetables. The only thing I don't like is the name *wink*wink*. When I served this at my Canadian Thanksgiving dinner, I told everyone it was "Root Vegetable Puree". (I'm such a snob...) Fantastic recipe, Jill! Thank-you!

Everyone liked this but didnâ€™t think it was amazing. Golden color gives good visual presentation. One person thought it tasted more like creamed (yellow) squash than mashed potatoes. Essentially, this is a dressed-up version of Basic Mashed Potatoes from this site with a turnip, onion, and carrots thrown in. On the bland side as written but easily fixed by adding preferred seasonings. The real benefit of this dish over plain mashed potatoes is adding high nutrient root vegetables which, as a group, are an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, fiber, potassium and antioxidants. This is a great way to camouflage some root vegetables that might not be eaten if standing alone, especially among young children. Oh, and we roasted the vegetables rather than boil them both because of a preferred taste and not losing substantial nutrients by draining off the standing water. Used a Vitamix to blend. We will make again with personal adjustments. Thank you SNOG for sharing an old French Canadian recipe.

Great way to use up the parsnips I had (which I subbed for turnips).  I also subbed leeks for the onions because it is what I had on hand and added a vegetable bouillon cube to the water.  I cooked the carrots, parsnips and leeks a bit longer than the potatoes, then used my immersion blender to puree the veggies (the hand mixer wasn't cutting it with the carrots).  Came out fluffy and yummy.

These were really yummy!  Next time I will steam the carrots then boil them so that they whip up more smoothly.  Even my 1 year old and 3 year old ate them!

This was really good. It had an almost leek and potato soup taste. I thought I cut the carrots smaller than the rest but they were still pretty hard when the rest was done...so make sure you cut them REALLY small for more consistent cooking. Thanks!

One less side dish to prepare, woohoo!  I used half and half and kind of free poured so I got more liquid in than I should have but it was still good.  Folks wondered what veggies I disguised, lol!!!

It was a little bland, and I agree that the turnip had a lot of water so it was more watery than regular mashed potatoes (I thought my bf didn't drain the pot properly!) Next time I would experiment with adding other spices, but the mixture was very nice together.

Very good, the turnip has a lot of water in it, so may want to add more potatoes than turnip.

I've been making variations of this for years. It's so versatile - - you can use almost any vegetable. Try it with a chopped fennel bulb (tops, stems and all). Also, I've used sour cream, butter or buttermilk (or a combination thereof) to add to the mash. Above all, the more veggies you add, the healthier it is!

The end dish was tasty but lumpy, probably because I fork-tested the potatoes but not the other vegetables to make sure they were cooked enough to be mash-able. The lumpiness didn't bother us, and the taste was good. I used cream cheese bc we were out of milk, and bc it makes a creamier dish.

This was really good.  As some have mentioned there was a lot of water in the final dish so I might not add so much milk next time.  This would be wonderful as a topping to Shepard's Pie!

Tasty, but I neglected to read the other reviews that said to cook the carrots longer, so they didn't mash up as well. I also added some garlic powder. Great way to use those turnips I get in my CSA.

YUM! This one is a keeper! I replaced milk with half & half cream (10% mf), instead of all carrots I added 1/2 carrot 1/2 parsnip mix and served sour cream as a "top-it" option. Very surprising, savoury and comforting.

I made this for Thanksgiving and we loved it!  The flavors were delicious together and it was great way to dress up "boring old potatoes."  I'll make this one again.

Hubby and I found this dish to have little flavor.  There are too many recipes out there with the right combination of vegetables and seasonings already that I don't feel compelled to tinker with this one.  Wouldn't make again.

Pretty good...took advice from other reviewers- used yukon golds, put chicken bouillon granules in water and used evaporated milk.  Hubby thought it was a little bland, I should've added sour cream.  You really need to cook the carrots well; I thought I did, but carrots didn't whip up.  I think next time I will leave out onion as some didn't whip up either and kind of ruined the texture.

Fantastic! An easy comfort food for a cold winter night. I used Yukon Golds for the potatoes and the whip turned out creamy and delicious with very little butter.
