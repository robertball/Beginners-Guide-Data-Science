Refreshing, not too sweet, bit of a kick. - I think I over-pinched the cayenne but I like it hot. Great way to enjoy tasty farmer.s market fruit and veggies. Easy to make.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe, using one nectarine and one peach.  Also, used a serrano pepper instead of jalepeno.  My family loved it served with our homemade pupusa.

Made this for a group BBQ to go with the BBQ Flattened Chicken.  Made 2 batches - 1 as written & 1 without the Jalapeno (I don't do hot!).  Rave reviews from everyone! Leftovers were really enjoyed with tortilla chips later in evening.

I made this as per the recipe, except I misread the red peppers and put in red onions.  Once I saw my mistake, I put in red peppers.  Still very good!

This is great addition to a warm meal, other salads, and a bruschetta snack, with a cuppa of earl grey tea ;) The Corriander makes for a flavoursome Asianish aroma..

We have tons of peppers this year. I used one of every color. Excellent presentation. My Father in Law wants me to make a ton and can it. I don't know how, yet. I want to keep the texture and the super fresh taste.

I love this salsa. The sweet-spicy flavors are a nice change from tomato salsas and it's good on grilled meats.
My daughter and her teenage friends scarf it up. I can't make enough! Thanks Chef.

Every time I make this dish the flavor just gets better to new combinations I add to. A repeat always.

I used mango instead of the nectarine . I used all of the other ingredients, however precise measurements were not used. It turned out to be a great hit among my group. I also let it sit overnight before having it, mixing it several times throughout that time.

I would be willing to make this again. I liked the kick it had. It had been a while since I had prepared things of this nature, and it was nice that this turned out so well.

I usually love Chef John's recipes, but I was disappointed with the nectarine salsa.  It seemed rather bland.  I think it needs other fruit such as mangoes and pineapples to pep it up.
