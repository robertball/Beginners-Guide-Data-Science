I made this for dinner tonight and we thought it to be the best mac and cheese we have ever had. It was very moist and flavorful. I found it to be a recipe that will serve more than 6. The two of us will be eating it for several days! Thank you for sharing this recipe.  My husband is AF retired but the Navy serves really good food! Thank you also for serving in the armed forces. You are special people.

This was great to pull together for a last minute clean out the fridge and fill in the gaps dinner. I used whole wheat elbow macaroni, reduced fat sour cream and half Velveeta and half shredded cheddar cheese. (It gives it more of a flavor like the macaroni and cheese that Mom made for me when I was a kid with gov'ment cheese.) I don't normally keep saltines on hand so I used crushed Ritz crackers. I didn't get to try this but my husband and boys seemed to like it so much that nothing remains. I served this with leftover bacon wrapped meatloaf and a fresh green salad.

Very good! I decided to make this last night, but I forgot to get the condensed cheddar cheese soup so I used crm chicken soup instead. I also put in some chopped grilled chicken. I used 4oz velveeta and 8oz sharp shredded cheddar just because I love the flavor. Topped it with panko crumbs mixed in melted butter. Difinately the best baked mac n cheese I've found.

This is the creamiest mac and cheese recipe I’ve ever made, was a big hit with my family. I doubled the recipe and baked in 10X15 casserole dish. I used 2% Velveeta cheese, light sour cream and 2% milk. I didn’t have enough sour cream, as doubling called for a full 2 cups, I only had a bit over one cup, and so I grated some Colby Jack cheese along with the parmesan cheese (which I eyeballed both amounts, but probably totaled a cup and half together of shredded cheese).  I also didn’t have any crackers so I topped with French Fried Onions (the kind you use on green bean casserole). I spiced it with some shakes of black pepper, cayenne pepper and granulated garlic powder; along with the fried onions on top it had a marvelous flavor to it. If I don’t have the fried onions, I would add a teaspoon of onion powder to it also. I baked just the mac and cheese mixture covered for thirty minutes, then uncovered and topped with the fried onions and baked another eight minutes until lightly golden brown. For those that did try this and felt it was missing something, try the fried onions on top in lieu of the crackers. This is now our official mac and cheese recipe…and we’ve tried quite a few on this website…thanks for submitting.

Made exactly as written and enjoyed the nice creamy delicious results. I might change using Ritz (buttery style crackers) instead of the saltines but otherwise nothing else needs to be changed. I like the other reviewer who suggested adding tuna, that be something to try the next time. Thanks for posting this super easy dish.

I didn't have any sour cream but was dying for mac and cheese.  I added more cheddar and it was a little dry, but delicious.  Next time will be sure to have sour cream on hand!

This was excellent, way better then any other mac & cheese I have had. The only chages I made were to add 1/3 cup of finely chopped fresh cilatro to the mix & grated a little cheddar cheese on top & crushed some italian season croutons since I didnt have saltine crackers on hand. I will definately make this again, makes me want to join the Navy.

This was good but the sour cream does overpower the dish. I think I would just use 1/2c.

This is the best mac and cheese we have ever had. My hubby isn't a fan of mac and cheese but this one he loved.  This will be a regular dish in our household. Thanks for sharing!

I have tried more mac 'n cheese recipes than I care to remember ... looking for that elusive "just right" taste.  I have finally found it with this recipe. I used the basic recipe and followed some advice from other cooks. I used Fiesta Cheese soup for a little more "zing", only abut 3/4 of a cup of sour cream (it was all I had), used a freshly grated, three-cheese Italian blend, had a little over a cup of shredded cheddar on hand and threw it in, added some ground red pepper and finally, used round butter crackers instead of saltines. This will be my ONLY macaroni and cheese recipe from now on.  Plus, the leftovers warmed up very nicely (be sure to add a little extra moisture when reheating). Thank you, Muffin Mom - this granny is very satisfied.

nice and smooth and creamy - no problems with it except that it's not as flavourful as we would like.  Next time I'll add a little more spicing to our liking.

The tanginess imparted by sour cream serves to underscore the cheese flavor, but we felt that one full cup was overkill. We don't want to taste the sour cream - we're all about the CHEESE! The reduction to 1/2 cup as others have noted, is just about right, replacing the remaining 1/2 cup with milk.  As I didn't serve it immediately, the sauce tightened up considerably during the wait, so I blended in even more milk. I didn't measure how much, but if I had to guess, I'd say it was about an additional 1/4-1/3 cup. Just make it slightly looser than you think you need, because the starch in the pasta absorbs liquid readily. Sautéed some boneless chicken breasts, cut into small cubes, in garlic butter with fresh thyme and folded in to make it a complete meal. A hit all around!

Love this. I added some garlic and onion powder and just a dash of cayenne. I also left out the Parmesan cheese and replaced it with shredded Monterey Jack. We just love the jack around here and it's a good melty cheese. Also, 7x11 pan. I've also done it in a 9x11. Same recipe, basically. I heard angels singing when I took a bite. My only real note is that this DOES NOT reheat very well, so you should feel no guilt about eating an absurd amount in one sitting.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and put some in sprayed muffin tins.  The only adjustments that I made were to reduce the fat by using 2% velveeta, low fat sour cream and low fat milk.  Was very creamy!

I love this.  I have wanted a very creamy mac and cheese and now I have found it.  I did use Ritz crackers and increased the crumbs to 3/4 cup with 3 T butter, but otherwise made as written.  Thank you so much Muffin Mom!

I will never use another Mac N Cheese recipe ever again! This makes the stuff from the box look like cardboard. If you love CREAMY mac n cheese this is the recipe for you. I did melt the cheese in a pan before mixing with the noodles to help make sure it was evenly cheesy. I also added some garlic powder. cooked it for 30 minutes. Other than that didn't change anything and have made it three times already!! Love love love! Thank you!!

My immediate, and extended, family loves this dish. I make it all the time for gatherings. Instead of saltines, I use Ritz crackers and I use 1.5 sleeves, crushed, and mix with 1 stick of melted butter so it covers the entire dish. Nothing like that crunch!

I love this recipe! It was so much easier to make than the usual mac & cheese with making the roux and all of that. I followed it exactly, but melted then velveeta and mixed all ingredients in a bowl, then added cooked pasta. I had a bad experience in the past where the cubed velveeta didn't melt all the way, and it wasn't good. It was super rich & creamy and I don't think it will be dry for leftovers like a lot of mac & cheese gets. Will definitely make again!

Very tasty!  In fact I surprised myself about how good this recipe is - I suppose I associated mac/cheese with that horrid boxed stuff so to satisfy my grandson's insistence, I thought I'd try this recipe instead.  Now he will only eat "this", not "that" and the whole family enjoys it along with him.  Instead of cracker crumbs, I sometimes top with grated cheddar cheese along with panko, which adds a pleasant crunch.

I usually make mac n cheese from scratch and this was a very easy recipe. I made it the first time exactly as described. The second time I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made some changes. I didn't have enough Velveeta, so I substituted cubed cheddar cheese I had. It was good, but the cheese didn't melt as well as the velveeta, so it may need to be stirred during cooking if you do that. I also didn't have sour cream, so I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk. I didn't have fresh Parmesan, so I used the grated Parmesan I had in the fridge. I also substituted cream of chicken soup for the cheddar cheese soup. Both verisons were good!

Very pleasant tasting. The only suggestion I have is that it needs just a tad more macaroni. Not nearly the other half a 1 lb box.. but this recipe needs a good 10-12 oz macaroni, not just 8.

Surprisingly bland in spite of so many ingredients. Needs something else.  I won't make this version again.

Easy and good. This makes a great "base" macaroni and cheese. Don't change a thing for the kids or picky eaters - add whatever you'd like for the more adventurous types. This is a keeper.

So good!!! Different than my old standard cheddar version but just as delicious. Like the difference between a hamburger and a hot dog, both good just depends what you're in the mood for. I guess. This recipe is a winner!  Thank you for this yummy recipe & thank you for your service! (From an ex-Army wife)

I made 2 pans and ran out of foil, so I only covered 1.  The 2nd pan still came out okay, but the covered one was much better!  All my employees complimented the dish at our potluck.

The best recipes are ones that someone has to quest to recreate.  This one is great.  I was able to pretty much eyeball the ingredients and it turned out perfect.  I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines... I just hate saltines.  So full...

I WANTED to love this.  I was having a pregnancy craving for the most amazing mac and cheese so I went for the one with highest reviews on this site. To me this tasted like noodles mixed with cheese wiz and crackers... I never buy processed cheese but I made an exception because this had such high reviews, but I was very disappointed.

It's nice how easy it was, but it tasted cheap and easy.  Might be a decent base recipe if you added different cheeses and flavors so it's not just Velveeta and sour cream coming through.

Very good mac and cheese, in fact this is my go-to now. The first time I made this I followed the recipe directions exactly. We didn't care for the little bits of unmelted Velveeta in the finished dish so now I warm the sauce ingredients enough to melt the cheese and it's wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe and thanks for your service to our country.

This was awesome! Instead of cheddar cheese soup, I used cream of mushroom soup, and added about a cup each of mozzarella and mild cheddar cheese in addition to the velveeta.

Incredible.  If you are looking for a Velveeta based mac and cheese this is the one!  I used 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and Club crackers because that is what I had on hand.  Delish!

This mac and cheese is good and very rich.  I used 2 different shapes of wheat pasta (it is what I had on hand).  Family enjoyed it.  Thanks Muffin Mom N Garlic Girl for sharing your recipe.  Also, thank you for your years of service with the U.S. Navy!

I have tried sooooo many Mac~N~Cheese ideas and have never been happy....until now! My son says it was too creamy but his VERY picky friend (if it's not from MC D'S then it not worth his time)  says he is crazy and asked for the recipe to give to his mom. Now if I can get this picky eater friend to like something I put in front of him then I feel I did something right :) My hubby really enjoyed as well! Also used Ritz instead if Saltines to top.

The best ever!  This is the only homemade Mac n cheese my kids will eat. Super easy too!  I make it with BBQ chicken whenever we go camping for our last meal.  I do everything ahead of time and put into two disposable foil pans. While we are cleaning up the campsite, I throw both pans in the RV oven and lunch is ready so we can eat before we head home. Best of all is no dishes!  Make it! You won't regret it!

This recipe tasted really good. I don't like the boxed Mac and Cheese so I'm always looking for different recipes to try since this is one of my four year old's favorite meals. He really liked this one! I think there was almost too much sauce so I would probably add more noodles next time to fill it out a bit. Since I had to work in the evening, I cooked the noodles and mixed up all the ingredients and put it in the fridge for a couple of hours, and then when my husband and son were ready to eat he put it in the oven. That worked out really well for a make ahead and bake later type of meal. Thank you for sharing this recipe; I'm sure I will be making it again!

A very yummy dish that will please children!  I enjoyed, but as an adult would spice it up with mustard or cayenne for that extra kick if serving for adults.  I used 2% Velveeta, fat-free sour cream, omitted the parmesan cheese and used crushed corn flakes, as I had on hand.  I would make this again for that creamy delicious perfectly velvety dish!

I was excited when I found this recipe and I wanted to taste Navy Mac N Cheese cause it sounded so good! I followed the recipe to the T and it came out fantastic!  I took it to our annual Thanksgiving celebration and it was gone in minutes.  People went up for second servings of just the Mac and Cheese.  I think the only thing I would add is a little Cayenne pepper I probably will leave out the crusty topping.  Overall, I was impressed and will be making this my staple Mac and Cheese dish.  Great recipe!!

My family rated this just ok.  It's not bad, but you have to Really like cream cheese and it's not my families favorite. I might make it again since it is so moist and creamy, but cut back on the cream cheese and a bit more of another kind.

This was very good.  I made with the sour cream but had to substitute other cheeses for Velveeta.  I will make it again and follow directions, as written.  I, too, am looking for a thinner, whiter "lunchroom" type of mac and cheese.  As I prepared it, it wasn't exactly what I'm looking for.

This was pretty good. The only issue my family discovered was that the Velveeta cheese didn't melt all the way in certain places. Some spots it was great and others it seemed barely melted.

I guess I'm just not a big fan of the Velveeta flavor.  Will definitely try this again using a different cheese.

I made this last night and WOW! I've gone through 5+ mac n cheese recipes trying to find one my family will love and BINGO! This is it! Thank you so much! I like that it has a whole different base than the usual flour butter rue. Those always seemed to go dry and almost grainy in the oven, and I love the ritz/butter topping too! I added a little dry mustard for kick and it was perfect! This is defiantly going in my file! Thanks again :)

This is light years above the Mac N Cheese that we got out of the Food Replicator during the time I spent on the Enterprise.  Dr. McCoy didn't approve of all the cheese, cream, and butter, but Sulu loved it.

Very good! I used evaporated milk in place of whole milk and Ritz crackers since they were becoming stale. I added a dash of freshly grated nutmeg. I have used Velveeta for years and always get rave reviews. I will use this recipe for Christmas buffet.

Very creamy, comfort food at its best!  Added a little garlic powder to mine, because I love in in mac & cheese.  The cracker topping makes it even better.  Thanks for the recipe.

made this first because who can go wrong with a military recipe...family LOVED it...and now request it alot!  I make it at 1.5 times the recipe. leaving the soup the same...and the snack packs of Ritz crackers that have 15 ish per pack. crush them along with a handful of saltines! other variation is 4 oz of Velveeta and using a 2 cup measuring cup fill the remainder to get to 2 cups with shredded cheddar!  did this the first time out of necessity and it was a hit! love love Love this recipe!

I don't know if it was the quality of the processed cheese that I used (store brand vs name brand) or that I substituted cream of mushroom soup (and it was 98% fat free), but the taste was very bland, and I didn't like that the cheese was in globs in the dish.  I didn't use the cracker topping, so after the 30 minutes I stirred it up to incorporate the cheese into the sauce and put it back into the oven for a few minutes.  The taste was just lacking something.  I put a bag of shredded sharp cheddar (8 oz) into it and mixed it all up again and baked it another 10 minutes.  The sauce prior to the cheddar was on the loose side and after was very rich.  I think I may have used a little too much.  Next time I'm going to use the cheddar soup and a little bit of dry mustard (before adding any cheddar) and see if that makes a difference.

I’m 28 and have never like Mac-N-Cheese. I’ve made dozens of recipes, I always try Mac-N-Cheese when I encounter it at someone’s house or restaurant, determined to figure out why so many people like this delicious sounding comfort food without success, until now.  I’ve finally seen the light and it’s a creamy cheesy glorious light, this is the Mac-N-Cheese that would be served in Heaven.  I had 20 people over for Christmas dinner 2014 and I served a double recipe and it was a huge hit.  Everyone raved on and on about it, I’ve made this a couple times since and I’m constantly getting request to make it for potlucks.  Seriously if you’ve been on the fence about Mac-N-Cheese or you’re just a lover of it and looking for a great recipe, look no further.  Trust me and my 28 year search and give this one a shot, you won’t regret it.   Thank you Muffin Mom N Garlic Girl for sharing this with us. P.S. I served in the navy for 10 years and I’ve never been served anything this good, thankfully for us you got lucky.

The flavor was good but the proportions were waaaaay off!  After six of us ate this as a side dish with our meal, I went back and cooked another batch of the pasta. I added this to the remainder with an additional cup of milk and it was much better. Otherwise its like you are eating a spoonful of melted cheese. And I used light sour cream and 2% velvetta. Not my familys favorite!

When I joined the Navy the Mac and cheese was excellent.  When I got out of the Navy just four short years later, it had gone down hill.  In efforts to be more health conscious, the cooks were not allowed to add cheese to the Mac and Cheese.  This recipe is exactly what the Mac and cheese was like in the early years of my enlistment and it was a major hit in my house.  I made it wrong, first time out, because I only had cream of chicken soup in my pantry, but even with that, it was still excellent.  I can't wait to make it again - exactly to the recipe.  Bravo Zulu.

I doubled the recipe except the condensed cheese soup I stay with the 11oz and also switched the saltine crackers with ritz as mentioned before. The best macaroni and cheese I've ever made it was in a 13x8 pan so had to cook for a good bit longer but well worth it

I made this and it was delicious EXCEPT...I used  Tostitos Salsa Con queso instead of Velveeta Cheese.(just cause I had the Tostito's Salsa on hand)   I didn't use the soup...I used cream cheese instead  and instead of sour cream  I used Greek yogurt. I used 1 can milk....diced onion, cayenne pepper, grated pepper jack cheese,  and butter and Panko for topping.  Oh....I guess I pretty much changed this up but it was Soooo good....

A couple of years ago, we had a contest.  Everyone made Mac and Cheese.  I had heard of the Navy recipe, and found this.  Everyone thought that they had the "best" recipe, but this was picked by the group as #1.  We've been making it ever since.  Fantastic!!!

oh dear.  This is one of those recipes that becomes an obsession.  I have made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  It's good the next day cold or re-heated.  The only change I've made so far is to double the amount of saltines & melted butter which I did because I love the crunchy topping.

This recipe was a hit. I'm never a big fan of mac and cheese but made this one and my family loved it. This will probably be our go to mac and cheese recipe. I'm going to try to add bacon next time. I read the review with the Ritz crackers and I will probably try that as well.

Perfection. One warning, though-- if you make this for a potluck, make a double batch and keep one at home or else you won't get to taste it.

Exactly what mac n' cheese is supposed to be - creamy, mild, but with a good cheese flavor.  I have tried all the recipes out there including Paula Deen's and this blows them all out of the water.  Made it as is.

Its a great recipe to use as a base to tailor to your own tastes.  Personally, I am a little flabbergasted by the amount of sour cream in the original recipe, also I am partial to garlic favor so see the following tweaks:
1. Double the amount of macaroni to 2cups (16oz)
2. I used 2 cups of cubed cheddar cheese (no parmesan, and honestly didn't need it)
3. 1tbsp of garlic powder whisked into the milk (try heating the milk up for 30sec to help the garlic dissolve).
4. 8x13 casserole dish greased with pam
5. baking time 30min covered with foil at 350and 20min uncovered at 300.
6. After baking, stir the entire contents of the dish together to mix the cheese together. 
7. Make another serving of the cracker topping and add broil the casserole dish at 500 till the topping is golden brown.

Awesome. This was the perfect comfort food/vegetarian option for my dinner party of five adults. For six, I'd probably consider upping it a bit, because there was only a spoonful left in the dish at the end of the evening!
I was in a bit of a rush, so I set my oven for 400, cooked everything for 15 minutes and took the foil off for the last 3 minutes and it turned out pretty much perfect. Also, the fried onions on top? Awesome decision. Couldn't ask for a better flavor blend. This is going into our cookbook!

I doubled the macaroni to 3 cups and used one jar of ragu cheese sauce instead of soup. Other than that made exactly as stated and it was excellent!

Awesome! So creamy and cheesy and addictive.  Wonderfully done. I followed other suggestions and used half Velveeta and half cheddar and it was awesome. I've also added raw broccoli and the cooking time is enough to soften the broccoli, but not "mush" it. Delicious! I've gotten requests for the recipe.

This recipe was good because the cheese sauce was easy to make (no rue) but I would change a few things. First of all, omit the Velveeta and use freshly shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Also, I only used half the amount of sour cream that the recipe called for and it was more than enough. I also combined all the cheese sauce ingredients in a pan and whisked continually over medium heat until thoroughly melted and smooth. The sauce also needs black pepper and some garlic salt. Instead of the Ritz crackers, I would use Italian bread crumbs. Also add a little extra cheese sauce to the elbows before putting in the oven because it tends to dry up a little during baking.

Perfect! Doubled the recipe and made in a 9x13. I usually am I a homemade cheese sauce kinda gal started with a roux....but this recipe interested me and looked super easy and seemed like it would be thick and creamy as the submittter said.....well it was delicious! Very creamy with little pockets of melted velveeta all in the middle....my kids just loved this as did I. I will never doubt the velveeta mac and cheese again....first time and definately not the last. Great recipe and thanks!

I doubled the recipe so I wouldn't have to cook for a night or two (actually we're on our third night of this- but it's tasty!). I used half each Velveeta & shredded extra-old cheddar, half each sour cream & fat-free plain yogurt and added a teaspoon each onion, garlic & mustard powders (I would cut the garlic down to half a teaspoon next time though). Made the rest of the recipe as described in the directions. I served this with herb-garlic bread the first night and baked cocoa-coffee rubbed chicken the second night (and tonight as well!). I like the idea of adding tuna to this, or serving it with hot dogs like I had as a kid. I do have another 'mac and cheese' recipe we love, but it's a little costly to make due to the ingredients used. This is a tasty, cheaper alternative!

This is a very easy recipe and it's the most delicious mac and cheese I've had in a while. Instead of using velveeta cubes and cheese soup, I used the jar cheese sauce and extra milk.  I blend everything together, except pasta, in a glass mixing bowl and microwave until warm.  Then I transfer the melted cheese mixture and macaroni to the glass baking dish and layer with sauce and sharp shredded cheese.  Yummy!!

This was good but much "richer" than what we usually eat!  And I used fat free sour cream and reduced fat Velveeta.  I think we'd like it better if it was a little "lighter".......and would feel less guilty after eating it!

Excellent Mac and Cheese  - I added a pinch of garlic powder, and followed others' advice on 4 oz. of velveeta and then a cup of shredded cheddar cheese (I left out the parmesan).  My boyfriend said it was the best he'd ever eaten!

**Updated** 
I'm only giving this 3 right now because I know why it didn't come out the way is suppose to. 
My boyfriend and I didn't notice how small the serving sizes were. We bought everything we needed but when we got home decided to double the batch. There was enough of everything except the condensed cheddar cheese soup. 
Because of that, I believe that is why it didn't come out as creamy as it was meant to be. 
We're going to redo this recipe in the near future and I will update my rating and review off of that outcome of that batch.
*Made this recipe again this weekend for a BBQ. Turned out really good! Instead of mixing everything on the stove top and baking I mixed everything into a crockpot  and once melted added the cooked pasta. Let that sit in there for a couple of hours on high heat to let it thicken a little. It was very good! Everyone loved it. I had a lot let over since I doubled it and had extra to take home. My DnD group later ate the rest of it lol.

This was the mac and cheese I've been looking for!  Thick and moist.  Made it a the recipe was written, and it was very good, but I think I will try adding a few extras for a little more flavor.

Brought this to a family pot luck and this recipe got tons of compliments. I did NOT end up making the topping for it.... because the standard box of Cremette pasta is actually double what the recipe calls for and  didn't notice that until after I had gotten started. Luckily I had doubles on all the other ingredients so I could adjust.  Adjust everything but the overflowing dish I planned to bake it all in that is, lol. It barely fit; but my hubs & kids happily ate leftover mac-n-cheese for days.

I made this last minute as a Thanksgiving side dish as I had forgotten a key ingredient for something else and had everything for this. It was incredibly easy and my sons loved it. I used ritz crackers instead of saltines and next time I’ll add bacon or ham or maybe broccoli.

This is my go to dish for any family function. I  Use only a 3rd of the sour cream and a quarter more of the valveeta cubes. Sooo creamy!!
Also, instead of bread crumbs, I use bacon. Always a hit with everyone!!

This is it!  The first homemade Mac and cheese that was truly cheesy.   Made it three times now.  Everyone loves it.   The third time I added a tsp. of powdered mustard which gave it some zip.   This is a keeper

Made this for 75 people for a dinner we were catering.  Everyone LOVED it.  Very easy to come together.  I did mix all the sauce ingredients together in a big pot while the pasta was cooking & then added the drained pasta to the pot.  The cheese melted without curdling.  I did replace some of the Velveeta with shredded CoJack & used Ritz crackers for the topping. Other than those minor changes I made it as directed.  So rich & cheesy.

I've been searching for a great mac and cheese recipe because my 16 month old refuses to eat anything but that. Made this for her and she downed it. I loved it as well. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this several times and my family of picky eaters loves it. I don't use the crackers on top because of the picky kids. Today I made this for about 50 people and increased it to be made with 5lbs of pasta. It made two full size trays and there is less than 1/4 tray left! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. We will keep this recipe and share it forever!

This is delicious! The best Mac n cheese ever!  We had it last night at son’s girl friends house. I had my doubts when she said what she was serving as I, and my daughter, had tried making Mac n cheese before but came out dry.  Sons girl friend added more milk to this as she did not think what was listed was enough. But she also made a large batch, with three cups of macaroni, and added bacon bits and Cajun spice.  I will be making this listed size recipe when we gat back to our place..

I had my doubts when I saw this recipe but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. I usually don’t like the processed cheeses but I had some leftover that needed to be used. I followed the recipe as it was written. Next time I would just change the saltine crackers for normal bread crumbs or croutons only cuz I didn’t care the the saltine taste with the cheese. Over all good, easy and quick to put together Mac and cheese.

instant hit!  So incredibly easy just like the name.  I didn't use crackers for the topping because I had to make it ahead and bake it the next night.  I added sharp shredded cheddar as well.  I will definitely make it again.

This was so yummy! The prompt here asks if I made any changes... Yes, because I didn't have any parmesan cheese. It was still really delicious without it! I think the sour cream is what makes it so creamy. I found it to have a fluffy sort of quality! Next time I'll use the parmesan cheese--we stocked up.

My family said, make this Mac and cheese recipe for now on.  Everyone loved the creaminess.  Melted all cheese together and added smoked paprika and garlic powder for extra flavor before mixing in  macaroni.  Also used ritz crackers.  Loved it!!

I love this recipe. It is my go to potluck dish and I’m always asked for the recipe. I have made it exactly as directed and it’s delicious but I typically double the recipe and make the following adjustments; add 1lb of bacon cooked and crumbled, substitute Panko bread crumbs for the cracker topping.

I made this for a mac and cheese cook-off and won against 16 other submissions. The only change I made was substituting Ritz for saltines, added s little garlic and onion powder and doubled the recipe. Great, “traditional” tasting Mac and Cheese.

This is my go to mac n cheese. Have made it for the family many times and it's always a hit. Covering it with foil is must. Instead of saltines I find that Ritz crackers hold their consistency more than saltines.

That's a lot of cheese for  only 8 ounces of pasta, and  8 ounces of pasta doesn't feed 6 people (in my opinion) Oh and used cheddar, didn't have processed cheese on hand

Like many others I cut back on the sour cream (2/3 cup light sour cream rather than 1 cup), used 4 oz Velveeta and 4 oz cheddar/edam cheese), and used closer to 10 oz noodles than 8.  I didn't have saltines so I used plain breadcrumbs for the topping.  I poured into 2 separate pans.  One for us for dinner, and the other for a friend, and everyone raved about it :)  Great recipe!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my hubby loved it. Super gooey and cheesy. I personally would rate it 4 stars as it was good but I prefer a less gooey consistency for my mac and cheese (hope that makes sense).

I made this for a picky crowd (blending two families full of teens) on Christmas Eve with pulled pork sliders and this was a huge hit! All the family loved it!  I added a few splashes of Tabasco sauce for a mild kick and I doubled the recipe and baked in a 10/15 pan with any problems. It baked about 40 min before bubbling. This is a part of our new Christmas Eve meal!

Made this for the first time on Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it so much, it's been requested for Christmas! I hate when people alter the recipe so much that they are not even rating the recipe given but more their own. The ONLY thing I changed was french fried onions instead of saltines as I didn't have any crackers on hand. It's easy and perfect!

This is the best tasting, easiest macaroni and cheese I've ever made. I love it as written for a great side dish to share with friends, but it's also great with "add ins" for a full meal. You can add just about anything and it always turns out great. My favorite meal idea is adding cubed ham, peas, and topping with crushed French's fried onions.

Made this for my daughter, who is crazy about Mac n cheese.  She thought it was too cheesy, so we boiled up additional pasta and threw it in to make it just right.  We'll make it again.  Thanks for a good, basic and easy recipe!

This was a little too artificial.. I think next time I make this I will omit the velveeta and if it needs more, then i'll throw in some shredded cheddar

I reduced the amount of sour cream by half and it still came out really, really good! The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ingredients. I just feel yucky eating such processed cheese and cheddar cheese soup. I think if someone else had it made it and hadn't told me what was in it, I would have definitely given it 5 stars.

I substituted sharp cheddar cheese, instead of all the Velveeta.   4 oz of Velveeta and 4 oz of Sharp Cheddar Cheese.  So I made a four cheese Mac & Cheese.  I also did bread crumbs instead of saltines on top, which I don't think affects the flavor of the dish.  I 

I have found my new favorite Mac & Cheese recipe.

This was delicious and very creamy.  I made it for a tailgate party and everyone loved it!  One man who doesn't normally even eat mac n cheese, asked for the recipe!  The only change I made was to add garlic powder to the mix prior to baking it.

I used lite sour cream and added  T of cayenne and a T of garlic powder. I also added  a 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. It is the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had! I made it in the crock pot rather that the oven. Suoer moist!

This is a family staple of ours. I changed some stuff as the years go by that I make it. I cube a little cream cheese along with the processed cheese. I also mix ritz with the saltines and use irish butter. My kids ask for this at least once a week.

This is my go-to recipe! I add 1/2 tsp Salt and 1/4 tsp Black Pepper. I do not put the crushed crackers and butter on the top. It is by far the favorite of everyone that tries it!

I doubled the recipe, but used less sour cream b/c it was for a kindergartner pot luck (was not sure if they'd like all that sour cream)...did not put the crackers on top...put it in a crockpot to stay warm and for transportation.  Wonderful!

Very good base macaroni n cheese recipe. I've made it a few times now and it seems as though picky eaters find it particularly delicious and for those with a more open palette it's easy for them to add additional seasonings to their liking.

I have yet to find the perfect mac and cheese recipe...Although this was ok it just wasnt what I was looking for :(  It was not as flavorful as i like and not creamy enough for my taste I might try this recipe again and decrease the macaroni a bit. I also didnt do the cracker topping i topped mine with bacon as I always do with my mac and cheese recipes!

It was missing that cheddar cheese taste I enjoy so much, so I added 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar to my liking...   
I LOVED the texture, even using light sour cream, nonfat milk and low fat velveta.  Thank you for this flexible recipe.

Just made this for dinner and it was delicious!  My boyfriend and my kids Loved it!  They can't get enough.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I like my Mac and cheese a bit on the peppery side and with sliced tomatoes sometimes.  I've only had one other better than this recipe but this one is definitely a keeper. It's so easy to make. I'll be making it very often. I highly recommend this one if you're looking for a quick, easy and Delicious Mac and cheese recipe. Enjoy!!

I tried this recipe last thanksgiving and it was great.  My friends and family were pleasantly surprised with how cheesy it was.  I followed the directions but used a big bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of 1/4 cup of parmesan.  You can't go wrong with more cheese and changing up the type of creamy cheese would give great results.  I also prefer shells to elbows because it's like mini pockets of cheesy goodness.  It was delicious and get requests to make a pan of this for gatherings.  The cracker/butter concoction added to the top makes it all the better.  I've always wondered what good can come out of a can of cream of cheddar soup.  It's the secret ingredient for extra cheesy macaroni.

This was the BEST mac n cheese we have ever had!  I added a bit of cayenne pepper for a little pizazz.  It was very thick, smooth and creamy.  On top I used French fried onions.  Delicious!!  Thank you for sharing and thank you for your service.

Best Ever! I made this and another dish fir dinner last night. We loved the mac-n-cheese. I wish I had doubled the recipe. The only thing I changed ( because it is what I had) half and half instead of milk, colby jack instead of parmesian and club crackers instead of saltines.
It was so good my daughter asked if I would make some for the consession stand for the high school game tonight!

I made this recipe 2x's. I agree with another poster, it needs just a bit more noodles, which is why I rated only 4 stars. Tastes great otherwise.

I upped the serving size to 50 to make this for a party...I added lots of black pepper and some garlic but it was PERFECT!  I got so many compliments on it.  SUPER easy and DELICIOUS!  I highly recommend using this recipe.

Hands-down, the BEST mac + cheese recipe I've ever made. No adjustments are needed, and it's one of the few dishes all 8 members of my household agree on. One of these times I may try the "low fat" versions some reviewers have listed... or maybe not. A girl needs to splurge once in a while. Thanks, Muffin Mom N Garlic Girl.

I've made this about 10 times now and just love it.  Very easy and delicious.  I used Ritz crackers because I was out of saltines and it came out okay, but I think it is better with the saltines.

This was really good. I was afraid it was going to be too wet/sloppy because of all the milk/soup/cream but it was perfect. Creamy cheesy goodness.

I'm looking forward to baking this.  I'm making it for my son's bonvoyage. He just finished his Navy training and will board a submarine in early March.  I thought this would be great on the menu having "Navy" in the title.  It tasted pretty good cold so it should be even better bubbly hot.  Thanks for serving and posting this recipe.

Really enjoyable and easy to make. The first time around I did the recipe as written except I used bread crumbs I had. It was very good. The second time I doubled the Parmesan and used double the Velveeta and used sharp cheddar instead. It was so delicious. We really love this recipe.

I've made this recipe twice already.  Its a good easy recipe for cheesy & gooey Mac & Cheese.  The second time I made this recipe I added subsituted shredded pepper jack instead of the parm cheese, creole seasoning instead of salt, & panko bread crumbs with the saltines and it was just as delicious!

Best mac 'n cheese I've ever made (and I've tried a lot of recipes). Thank you for your service and for the fantastic recipe. I've made as written and changed the cheese a bit depending on what I've got on hand, and it's always fabulous.

I added some garlic and onion powder, and pepper.  I didn't do any topping, because I'm not really a topping on casserole kind of girl.  This was a typical velveeta dish.  Good, but I don't make a habit of having velveeta around the house.  I did add tuna and some frozen peas to make it more of a tuna mac.

All four of us agreed this was the best mac & cheese we'd ever tasted! I tried to keep to the recipe, but added a second can of soup because I tossed in a bunch of chopped ham. When I make it with just macaroni I'll only use one like the recipe states, but will cut the sour cream in half. It was just tangy enough when I made it, so I think it will be too much without the second can of soup.

This was pretty good but not as good as I was expecting after seeing the rating. I follwed the recipe exactly. Just not creamy enough for me. the top layer was hard and dry, probably from baking the last 10 minutes without the tin foil.

This was delicious. It was for a potluck, so I doubled the recipe and threw cooked noodles and rest of ingredients in a crock pot and cooked on high for 1 - 1.5 hours.  Added garlic powder, salt and pepper and it was awesome!  Got rave reviews.  Thanks so much!

I tried this recipe even though I didn't have the Cheddar Cheese soup or the Parmesan Cheese. My family is very picky, but they  absolutely loved it. I can't wait to make it again with all the ingredients. Thanks for this recipe!

This was good.  The ONLY thing I changed was I used more pasta and more velveeta.  I used carrot/squash pasta in place of white macaroni noodles.  Kids scarfed it up, mom loved it and adult son loved it. I thought it was pretty good for a quick meal!

My family is totally in love with this awesome mac and cheese. I follow the recipe to the tee, nothing needs to be changed. Have made about 5 times now.  My oldest daughter says it's like being in cheesy heaven and has made all the requests for it. Thank you so much for this awesome comfort food dish  :D

So good!  I occasionally made this ahead of time, refrigerate overnight, add a little milk to it and cooked for 45min.  This is the only Mac n cheese my entire family agrees on. To make it healthier,  I use light sour cream, 2% velveeta, skim milk, skim parm cheese.  I also omit the butter, the breadcrumbs cook up fine without it. I sometimes add a layer of 2% sharp cheddar before popping in the oven.  Thank you for this great recipe and your service to our country.

I made a HUGE batch of this mac n cheese...enough to fill an entire roaster pan.  My husband is quite a connoisseur of mac n cheese, and he told me this is some of the best he's ever had.  I'd call that a glowing recommendation!!

Like many others, I have tried numerous mac and cheese recipes.  I especially like the ones that don't require making a roux.  This one fits the bill completely.  The ingredients and approach are very simple, and the recipe yields a dish that is delicious fresh and as leftovers.  I used whole wheat macaroni and evaporated milk, and made no changes to the recipe.  Just fabulous!
