Very good as is; especially since it called for canned tomatoes and chicken.  I doubled the recipe except, so I used 1 can of petite diced tomatoes and 1 can of italian style diced tomatoes.

These were delicious! I seasoned and baked a chicken breast instead of using canned, garden fresh cherry tomatoes instead of canned, and I used parmesan instead of feta. Can't wait to make this again!

This was great! I'm not a tomato fan, but with the chicken and basil, it's not an overwhelming tomato taste. Took this to a Holiday party and everyone loved them!
