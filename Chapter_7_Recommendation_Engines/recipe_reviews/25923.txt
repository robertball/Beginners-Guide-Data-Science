This was a good dish, but I varied a bit. I used milk instead of heavy cream, chicken broth instead of bouillon cube, and added cream of celery soup, 1 cup of chopped celery, and 1 tsp of poultry seasoning.

I sauteed my onions, chicken and mushrooms with garlic and oregano.  Then I added 1 can of chicken broth and let it simmer for a while.  Then I drained some of the liquid and added about 3 cups half / half & 1 cup milk, used almost 1 cup of parmasan and stirred in the noodles and baked for about 45 min.  I will make this again for my sister, a white cream sauce fanatic!  This is so delicious ya'll, but I felt like a whale after eating it!

This is a very good base recipe, but you may want to reduce the amount of cream and add more veggies.  Other than that, the 5 people that I tried this recipe on finished off a doubled recipe!

This was very tasty, but I would recommend less water.  The sauce was more runny than it was creamy.  The recipe calls for covering the skillet contents with water.  I'd only use half the water next time.  I also added a red pepper, which gave it a better flavor.  Very good, and it reheated well.  I served it over buttermilk biscuits.

Too liquidy.  Three chicken breasts and four cups of cream, plus water to cover, made this far too runny.  The flavor was decent, but suffered due to the excess of liquid.  Didn't reheat particularly well -- cooled to a solid, thick block, and reheated to a jelly-like, thick sauce.  Will not make again.

I only used 2 cups of cream and it was still too runny.  I like the combination.  I cooked chicken tender pieces in olive oil.  Next time, I will make a traditional alfredo sauce though.

I added green peppers to mine as well.. they tasted quite yummy.. The only issue I would have is that after baking it, it turned out a bit dry. Next time I'll try and get a bit more of a sauce to it so the noodles and chicken stay moist, even on top.

Umm whoever suggested cooking the chicken in the microwave, just stop. Don’t be lazy. I sautéed the chicken about 8 minutes on both sides then put it in the oven to finish cooking while I did the rest. I also added garlic and oregano to the onions and mushrooms and used milk instead of heavy cream. Turned out pretty good!

I've made this twice and following the recipe it comes out too soupy. I see other reviews that have changed it up. I'll try one of them next time. 4 stars because it's delicious!
