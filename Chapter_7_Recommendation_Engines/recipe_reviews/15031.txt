This is a great recipe exactly as written, though I do always salt my eggplant first to make sure it's not bitter.   I've tried other variations, all very good: adding several spoonfuls of pesto in lieu of the basil, melting mozzarella cheese on the garlic bread, serving with focaccia or pita bread.  I've also varied the amount of each vegetable based on what I had on hand, and it's come out great every time.

Absolutely excellent!  The only thing I will change next time is to serve it on toasted pita triangles rather than crusty bread...I'll get more of the tasty spread that way!

Although I added goat cheese for a little extra flavor, I was a bit disappointed with the intensity of flavor overall.  Unfortunately, I did not have fresh herbs on hand so I used dried herbs (2x as much), so that may be reason for the perceived lack of flavor.  Maybe it just needs more salt.  I must agree with everyone that it is a very tasty dish and I looked forward to eating the leftovers (with extra salt :)

This is a really nice recipe.  I made it as a side dish.  I used a whole loaf of french bread which I cut into wedges.  It went over really well.  There is enough left over for tomorrow's lunch.  Quite delicious.  This could also be made as a nice lunch in itself.

What a great idea... I used zucchini, mushrooms, green onion, tomato, and ripe olives with a splash of balsamic vinegar added as they simmered together.  Just like a delicious veggie pizza.

I found this recipe because I was looking for light, healthier dishes.  I made it for dinner and both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I chopped the vegetables into larger chunks so it didn't fit well on small rounds of bread, so instead I sliced the loaf of french bread the long way, baked it with the garlic and butter and then piled the veggie mix on top, while it was still warm.  It was delicious!

We loved it!!  Added a vidalia onion to the mix.  Took the baguette, sliced in thirds - then each in half lenthwise.  Made a wonderful open sandwich. Also, used a drizzle of EVOO instead of butter on the bread. Once assembled added a little shredded Parmesan over the veggies.  Fantastic.

Mmmm...we added a bit of onion and green pepper, then topped with fresh parm.  What a great way to use all the goodies fresh from the garden.

Very good! I did sweat my eggplant for about a half an hour before cooking to avoid sogginess. I omitted the salt during cooking due to salting the eggplant to sweat it, but otherwise followed the recipe. Topped with a bit of shredded Italian cheese blend before serving. Thanks! :)

This was the first time to make this recipe.  My family and I loved it.  Great seasoning taste...almost didn't mind the fact that there was no meat on the sandwich.  I will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe that can be used as an appetizer, a side dish, or a vegetarian meal all by itself! I made it as a side dish with grilled chicken, but had the leftovers as lunch the next day.  Some modifications I made: brushing the bread w/ olive oil and toasting on the grill; cooking the veggies only until tender and warm, so that it was chunky when spooned onto the bread; and adding some yellow peppers and sliced onions to the saute mixture.   It was a huge hit, especially with all of the great summer veggies.

This was another one we did for our wedding reception. Wow..would be a good description. The two guests that are vegetarian absolutely raved over this. All the other guests loved it as well.

Excellent on Foccacia Bread with garlic mayo. Make sure the eggplant doesn't get overcooked. Mushrooms are a must!

Very tasty! A little on the oily side and I probably will use all zucchini instead of eggplant next time. But overall pretty good. I made this as a meal, but i think it would make a much better appetizer for guests.

I loved this recipe because it can be so easily tweaked.  I added portabella mushrooms, a splash of balsamic vinegar and melted some gargonzola cheese on it.  Instead of garlic bread I used a grinder roll and put pesto mayo on it.  Yumo.  :)

Yummy!!! I didn't have any eggplant on hand so i skipped it. I did however put shredded mozzarella cheese on top and put into the oven for another 2-3 mins. Easy and fast to make.

YUM!!!  I did some unnecessary add-ins just to use up some stuff I had.  I added in some onion and mushrooms with the garlic.  I also didn't have fresh basil on hand so just used some dried.  Put this on some home made naan bread instead of making the garlic bread and it was soooo delicious!!!  This recipe is very versatile and yummy!

Thanks for this great recipe!!  Tried it exactly as written;  fantastic!!  Second time, added sliced fresh mushrooms to garlic,  and sauted until tender, then added vege's and cooked just until slightly crisp.  Used two chopped, peeled, seeded tomatoes instead of one.  Add tomatoes when vege's still crisp.and cook tomatoes until pulp.  Keep warm.  Serve in a beer batter crepe (recipe this site), and you have a delicious meal of Ratattouie!!!  Or you can add slices of grilled, cooked  chicken breast for a variation that becomes the main meal.  Absolutely delicious!!!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was good but not great.  I would definitely reccommend crisping the garlic bread before adding the veggies.  Honestly, it pretty much tasted like bread with veggies on top.  The flavors did not meld well.  I'd be interested to try it with different combos of fruits/veggies (the eggplant/zuchinni mixter din't exactly blow me away).

I omitted the basil (and garlic powder) and spread the baguette slices with  basil pesto I made with basil from my garden since I wanted to use it up and this was amazing. I also used white eggplant which I peeled since I wasn't sure how the texture would turn out unpeeled.   I brought it to a party and got lots of compliments.

This was yummy hot or cold,  winter or summer. or as a side dish!  I made this one night, and because I'm lazy, the next day I toasted in the toaster some good bread, buttered it and sprinkled garlic powder then added the microwave veggies.  So I took a shortcut!   It was still wonderful.

This was very good. I sliced the baguette in half and then halved each piece lengthwise, for open-faced sandwiches. I also used olive oil instead of butter. Next time, I'll add mushrooms and maybe some caramelized red onion. A definite keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I used pita bread instead of garlic bread, and tonight for left overs I am going to serve it over whole grain pasta!! I added yellow squash into the mix as well. It was very tasty, the vegtables all blending in great together, I will make this again.

I loaded this thing with mozz cheese, and it was pretty tasty.  The eggplant and cooking times of it were less than desirable.

This is so good!  I served this as part of a vegetarian dinner party as an appetizer and it went over really, really well.  The small store by my house was out of zucchini, so I used a medium eggplant and two tomatoes instead.  I didn't peel the tomatoes because I forgot and it was totally fine, too.  I have previously balked at eggplant anything but this was really, really good!  It came together quickly, also, which was nice and it stands up well since it can be eaten at room temperature and still be fine.  I also like that it seems to be fairly versatile regarding the different veggies you can use.  I'm looking forward to making it with the zucchini and pleased with the fact that I found an eggplant recipe I like!  Finally, these would also be good with a sprinkling of parmesan on top, but it's totally not needed (just an extra dose of cheese - ha.)  Thanks so much!

This was delicious! I made the veggies and did slices of garlic bread instead as a side dish for a family gathering. It was perfect, absolutely delicious. I did follow some of the suggestions as they were dead on.

This was soooo good! I made garlic pita bread instead of the garlic bread. It was a huge hit at my dinner party... even those that are not huge fans of eggplant!

This was good, but we didn't think it was great.  I followed the recipe, with the only changes being to add fresh mozzarella after cooking the vegetables, and to add some roasted red peppers to the veggie mix.

This was sooo good. I made this as a meal for my meat loving fiancé and teenage brother and they really enjoyed it (really!). I even asked fiancé if it could be a favorite meal and he said definitely. I used two cloves garlic and instead of buttering the bread I brushed them with olive oil before toasting. 
I also cooked the veggies for longer (12 - 15 minutes) before adding the tomatoes because I wanted them soft. We enjoyed it nice and hot.
This recipe was so nice to make too because I enjoyed all the chopping and sauteéing involved. It made me feel like a really good cook. 
Thank you SO much Ila!

This was a delicious blend of vegetables using fresh herbs to increase flavors. This is a great way to get vegetables in using garlic bread. My husband loved these! A couple things I switched up though. I added 3 more cloves of freshly minced garlic than specified. Because of this, I cut down the amount of garlic powder to 1 ½ tsp. Chinese eggplant went nicely with this recipe. Didn’t have fresh oregano, but cilantro matched these flavors pretty well. The bread was sliced in larger pieces. I melted mozzarella cheese on these and sprinkled some red pepper flakes on top. This was very satisfying.

Easy to make, most of the time is spent with prep and cutting up begetables. Can alter to your preference and what you have in the fridge based on what veggies you have. I used pita bread instead and would add a bit more salt and pepper for taste or else the mixture comes out a bit bland.

this was so good. I don't like eggplant so I substituted mushrooms instead and used olive oil instead of butter on the bread before adding the topping. I also added a bit of grated mild cheddar on top and put it under the broiler instead of the oven.

I thoght this was great but needed something so I added fresh portabello mushrooms and thinly sliced red onion to zucchini mixture. Great flavor! Fresh herbs are a key, and mozzarella cheese sprinkled on just out of oven is to die for!

Very tasty!  I tried a short cut and grilled frozen garlic toast.  It was a little too rich but I think it would be excellent using homemade garlic bread as the recipe suggests.

Pretty good taste. I do think pita triangles would be better instead of bread and will try that next time as well as feta cheese.

This is a keeper!  Something about the combination of flavors and textures that is very tasty.  My vege neutral husband (he has never complimented a vegetable dish before) said it was "really good" as he went back for his third serving.  Will definitely be making this again.

Crack!  So good.  I am now making it without the garlic bread to save me some calories and because even the veggies alone are awesome.  With the garlic bread outstanding.

This turned out very good. I highly recommend adding an onion. Also, I was expecting the bread to come out like toast. Three mins on 325 still had soft bread. I had to cook it for 12mins to get it crispy and firm.

This is a variant of the Italian "bruschetta" - toasted (toaster-toasted or oven-toasted) Italian or French bread which is then rubbed with a garlic clove, sprinkled with extra-virgin olive oil, and then salted as desired. Basic bruschetta can be eaten as is. However, myriad  toppings, e.g., the eggplant topping in this recipe, are excellent enhancers of the basic bruschetta. Google "bruschetta toppings" for a plethora of tasty toppings.

Great recipe for when you are wanting something out of the ordinary. I loved it however my family didn't, but I will make it for my self.
