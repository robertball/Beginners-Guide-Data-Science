This is a very attractive dish.  Not exactly quick, but you can't expect that with risotto.  The effort is worth it.  It could use a little more spice, but then again, I used dried tarragon which is not as flavourful as fresh.

As a positive, this dish was very pretty - colorful, great presentation. However, other than the coconut, there was simply no flavor in this dish.

This was a little time consuming, due to precooking the wild rice.  I would add more chicken broth or stock and less water next time to give it more flavor - otherwise it was great.  I added chicken, some parmesan cheese and asparagus in mine.

This was a lot of work, but that's risotto for you!  My husband commented that it was bland, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

I love the idea of adding wild rice to a risotto but the recipe lacks flavor. Using broth or stock instead of plain water certainly would help things. Adding the coconut milk washes away flavor. I ended up adding broth powder, cauliflower, and hot peppers. As is, this is a recipe with potential.

Way too over-done.  Wild rice risotto is a great concept.  As I was cooking it, it actually tasted wonderful.  But after I added the tomatoes, peas, and coconut milk, it just turned into a disappointing confusion of flavors.  I will make this again, but will modify it heavily.  I will cut the tomatoes, peas, and coconut milk, double the wild rice, use chicken stock instead of plain water (for the risotto), and add in a little butter and parmesan to finish it off instead of the coconut milk.  With risotto, less is more.

No flavor to this recipe. We don not use a lot of salt in our food but this needs either salt or butter.  I would not recommend this dish.

I made my very first risotto tonight.  I made it very simple, substituting beef broth, no white wine on hand. My family loved it :)
