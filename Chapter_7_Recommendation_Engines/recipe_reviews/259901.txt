Everyone in our family loves it. I made it several times and honestly am puzzled by the negative reviews. European desserts are less sweet, which I personally prefer. I use 2 cups flour and 1 stick butter (to simplify). Since I bake it in a stoneware pie dish, I add 10-15 min to the bake time.

This is a delicious cake, wonderful with a cup of coffee. It's more like a breakfast or brunch cake to me, and I love the fact that it isn't too sweet. I followed the recipe to the letter. The batter is very, very thick, almost like a scone.

Do not waste your time or money.  I neglected to read the reviews before I made this, something is definitely missing from this recipe.  Should be taken off the site.

What is wrong with this recipe I bake a ridiculous amount than I noted while putting all the ingredients together that someone left a big ingredient out other wise u could have made pizza dough out of this recipe I had to than figure out how not to waste the ingredients so I added a cup of milk an extra 3/4 cup sugar honey and raspberry extract might be wise if you review recipes before u post them so people donâ€™t waste their money

I felt like something was missing from the recipe. Was not pourable into a pan like the directions stated. It was thick. Was not sweet enough nor cake like. Disappointed. I spent a lot of money on good ricotta and chocolate and had to throw away. Was not the Torta di ricotta e cioccolato I had in Italy.
