This is so close to my own chili recipe that I knew we'd love it. The only change I made was two cans of black beans, just didn't have the red beans and an orange bell pepper or yellow can't remember, but these would not alter the taste. I've never added Worcestershire sauce or liquid smoke to my chili that I recall and it gave nice rustic flavor to the chili, the cocoa is my secret ingredient also ;-). Oh for the oregano I used my garden fresh instead of dry. Everybody loved this chili and sent the leftovers home with the kiddos for another meal. Only change that I'd make is to throw in a nice jalapeno pepper next time. Thanks ctooch99 for the recipe.

This is a nice variation on the turkey black bean chili I usually make.  LOTS of ingredients, but it had good flavor. I cut way back on the red pepper flakes and it was still plenty spicy for us. Also used chicken broth instead of beer because I didn't have light beer.

Spicy & Thick Turkey Chili Haiku: "there's just too much stuff. A good chili nonetheless. Yup, spicy & thick." We liked this chili, but I just felt the ingredient list was unneccessarily long, but to save on time, I mixed all of the dry ingredients together in a small tupperware the night b4 (still not sure how a mere tsp of cocoa powder is the "secret ingredient" according to the recipe submitter, but I included it too.) I prefer to have my chilis going in the crockpot all day, so my family was surprised to come home to see chili in a large pot on the stovetop rather than chirping in the slow-cooker, and as thick as it was, I'm glad that it WAS in a pot so that I could keep my eye on it and stir it frequently. I won't lie - it was a delicious chili, but not so earth-shattering that I'd follow the ingredient list to the letter next time I make it.

Great base to start your life long journey to find the Chili that is perfect for you/your family. 

Everyone adjusts accordingly but I have used this recipe as a framework and adjusted for spice/ a heartier consistency to great success.

Love this recipe.  Turkey chili is so good- all the great chili taste without the grease.  This recipe has a long ingredient list, but the result is well worth it -- a rich, memorable flavor.  I think this has become my new #1 favorite chili recipe.
