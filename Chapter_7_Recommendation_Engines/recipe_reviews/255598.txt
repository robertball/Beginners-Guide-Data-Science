This is very good!  The only change I made was to use Trader Joe's Lemon Pepper Pappardalle Pasta rather than the egg noodles.  I still have no idea what two cups of pasta means, but I used about 4 oz of the pasta as well as some capellini pasta for my husband.   I always wondered how to make marinated artichoke hearts, and this recipe tells you how!  I served this with some chicken breasts using a chicken rub from this site.  It was very tasty, and I'm grateful that we have some leftovers for tomorrow night.  I know this will go over well as leftovers!  Thank you!

This looked bland, so I added 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning and 8 oz faux crab.  And I finished it with paprika .  I really liked that it is so quick to prepare!  Yummy!

Just made this! I did sub the noodles with spaghetti squash, white cooking wine for the pinot grigio and the lemon for a lime. It's super delicious. Much better than I thought it was. I'm definitely making this again!!

Very light, not greasy, with excellent flavor.  I substituted apple juice for white wine and quinoa for noodles - still perfect.

Simply divine combinations. Thanks for sharing! Eye had to make due on a couple things, the noodles and the wine, and it was still fabulous! Eye also substituted coconut oil and salt for the butter. Eye don't do dairy. ;) Works like a charm.

Great as written, and also good with other favorite pastas and onions/no capers.
