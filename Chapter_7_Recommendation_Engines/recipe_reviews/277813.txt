1.10.20  I typically roast my potatoes at a much higher temperature, so I had my doubts about these potatoes browning/crisping at 325ÂºF.  Yes, they do take a little longer to roast, but they cooked up beautifully.  Nothing fancy here, just a solid, basic recipe for oven roasted potatoes.  I did think more salt was needed, so right before serving, I sprinkled with sea salt flakes.
