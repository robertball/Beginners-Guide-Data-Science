I made a half batch of this dressing to use on 'Taco Pasta Salad' from AR in the morning, so the flavors had all day to blend.  I used avocado oil rather than vegetable, as that is what I had on hand.  I also used Stevia® in place of the sugar.  Reading the footnotes, and liking spicy, I used half paprika and half chili powder to add a little zip.    It complimented the taco salad nicely with its sweet/spiciness. We really enjoyed this dressing and I will be making it again. Thank you, Grandma39, for sharing your recipe.

We love french/catalina-style salad dressings, and this is a good one.  Our tastes lean toward "less sweet" these days, so I did cut back on the sugar to suit our personal taste preference.  The nutritional breakdown is already pretty good on this dressing, but I used Truvia® instead of sugar, so the calories were even fewer.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Grandma39!

Very nice recipe (used avocado oil). After tasting it, I also added some garlic powder and about 1/4 tsp. of habanera sauce (didn't measure, just shook bottle a couple of times) for a little added kick. Was feeling too lazy to clean another device, so opted not to blend. Poured it into an old store bought salad dressing bottle, refrigerated a few hours and the salad turned out with fantastic flavor.

Awesome-sauce!!!   I mean salad dressing.  Used 1/2 the oil and only 1/2 cup sugar. Love it.

This recipe is so much better than bottled dressing. I made it exactly as written but next time I will use 1/2 cup oil since I thought 1 cup was a bit too much. I will definitely make this one again.

25 July 2016--made for use in a Taco Salad, very good.  Added a little chunk of red onion instead of dried minced, used apple cider and Currant vinegars.  Blended with immersion blender, thick and delicious!
