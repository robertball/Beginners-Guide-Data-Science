Coming from a Scottish background, I am surprised when people alter an authentic recipe, which this is. Making truly excellent shortbread take a little more time than indicated. Slowly incorporating the flour is the key. Start with two cups after thoroughly blending the butter and sugar, then add the next two one at a time and the final one in quarters.  This is how my Gram made her's (which I follow as well) and it turns out perfect every time. For a little variety, add finely chopped dried fruit such as apricots, cherries or cranberries.  You can't go wrong!

Very nice shortbread.  Rich and buttery.  I do question the instruction to mix the ingredients by hand.  The probability, in my opinion, is that would lead to overworking it and making it tough.

This is the original!  I think you absolutely should just mix by hand so you still get the little bits of butter.  Much like pie dough in that you would never use a mixer for that either.  So good.  Thanks!

I had a craving for chocolate  and raspberry, but not together.  So, I made the dough as per the recipe,  then split the batch of dough in half and put each half into a cake round. I mixed mini chocolate chips into one and pressed into an even layer.  In the other half I dropped raspberry jam,  mixed lightly so there would be streaks,  and pressed into the pan with the help of plastic wrap.  They both came out delicious!! The shortbread was buttery and not too sweet, and the additions were a nice change.

Lovely, simple recipe. I used dark brown sugar instead of white. I used a pastry blender to mix and cut the recipe in half. Only trouble was stopping before I ate the whole pan. Delicious!!

A very tasty shortbread. I mixed everything in the food processor, just pulse until it's crumbs, dump in pan and pat together.
I did add some ground ginger and some candied ginger for a flavor variation.

So easy&So delicious!

I made the recipe twice exactly as written ,,except,,,, . The first time I used a pastry blender to mix it all together, then the 2nd  time I used Adrienne's 
suggestion and dumped all the ingredients in my blender. After blending well I just dumped it in my pan and used my hands to press the dough into pan. Then I pricked it all over with a fork and baked.
it came out perfect. Easiest ever recipe!

So thrilled with this easy recipe! The shortbread came out perfect. I used a 15x10 inch sheet pan. The cookies are about 1/2‚Äù thick. I dusted the top with cinnamon and sugar. I did all the mixing by hand as instructed.

So easy and so delicious!!  I gave these (and some other cookies) to co-workers for Christmas, and almost all of them asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make these again.

Wonderful recipe. Melt in your mouth good. Will add slightly less flour next time. Batter was very, very stiff.

So for a long time it feels like you're being pranked when making this recipe... You just kneed this dough like a kitten on it's Momma. I found that when I zoned out and let my hands wander through this dough like a back alley massage therapist does near the end of her 12 hour shift, that the dough finally came together.
