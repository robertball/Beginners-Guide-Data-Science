Like other reviewers suggested, I added more lemon juice (2/3rds of a cup) and increased the flour by 2 tbsp. Very lemony flavour and a very dense, moist  bread, I did have to bake mine longer though. I skipped the glaze too. One small detail that is missing in the directions...it does not say WHEN to add the lemon juice, I added it after I creamed the shortening/sugar and eggs and BEFORE the adding the milk, otherwise that much lemon juice would have curdled the milk instantly. Good recipe and thanks for providing it!

This is the best lemon bread I've ever made, my dad loves it.  Especially when I add poppy seeds which realy complement the sweet-tangy lemon flavor.  I add a little to the batter, and a little to the glaze and it's really delicious.  I've found that the bread takes less time in my oven, about 45 minutes, but everyone's oven is different.  When you think its ready then it probably is, (if you know what your doing :-) otherwise it won't be as moist as it should be.

This is great as a dessert!  I usually use butter instead of shortening, a tablespoon of lemon zest and I make the glaze by combining lemon juice with powdered sugar.  It is perfect with tea.

This bread has a lovely pound cake texture.  I poked holes in it before pouring the glaze over.  Sir the glaze ingredients very well before using but don't skip using it.  It makes the bread what it is.

I have discovered that it is quite difficult to find a good lemon loaf recipe.  This one, however, is one of the best out there!  The nuts are an interesting addition.

Soooooo good!  I think I have made this 6 times since I found the recipe!  Everyone loves it, and my husband is requesting it again today.  I bake it in 3 mini loaf pans.  I also microwave the lemon juice to melt all the sugar before pouring the glaze on top.  Yum!

The bread is really nice.  It is moist with a great texture.  The glaze really is the defining component in this recipe. Let the bread absorb as much of it as possible.  My husband put it on a plate and rolled the bread in it until it was all over the bread.  Yummy!  My only problem with it was that the inside wasn't lemony enough.  I'm not sure whether it requires more zest or perhaps a teaspoon or two of lemon juice. Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this bread! My mom used to make it when I was little. (Mom's recipe uses 1/3 c marg.) It's almost more like a cake than bread. I like to make it in mini loaf pans so the glaze can really get into each bite (poking holes is also helpful).

great recipe. I did make a change by accident. I squeezed a full lemon and added it to the egg ,butter and sugar mix before the milk. Then when I finished  cooking the bread I looked back at the recipe and discovered that I did it wrong so I cut 1/2 a lemon with 1/2 the sugar to put over top. I also like butter better than shortning. My mistake made the bread so nice and lemony. It was wonderful. I just made another loaf. Thanks

Good recipe for a basic lemon bread. I did however, change a number of things. First, since I wanted my bread more lemony and less milky, I added 1/3 cups of lemon juice and reduced the milk to 1/8 cups + 1 tbsp. To make the bread more fluffy, I added 1/8 of a tbsp of vinegar to the milk and also added 1/4 tsp of baking soda. I added the lemon juice right after I added the eggs.  The texture was lovely! I put only 1/4 cup sugar and it was too sour for my liking, so I'd increase the amount of sugar the next time round. Also, I took the bread out of the oven and glazed it 15 mins before the cooking time ended (I cooked it for about 40 mins), and placed it back it, so it'll have time to dry a little. I will definitely be making this again!

The tastes of blueberry and lemon is a great match.  I tried to make mini loaves but the loaves needed to cool almost completely before they'd come out of the pan.  It makes a very tender loaf though.  Delicious!

This is most excellent!  A wonderful recipe, with a great flavor, and it's moist and fluffy.  

I did make a few changes, after scanning the comments.  In case they help anyone else, here they are:  

1) Lemon juice in the loaf itself.  I know the directions call for the lemon juice to go into the glaze, but I wanted there to be more lemon flavor in the bread itself, too.  So I did 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup lemon juice (but mixed the lemon juice first so the milk wouldn't curdle when it was added), instead of the 1/2 cup milk.  You could probably add more juice if you want, but this worked for me.  I was also a bit more generous with adding lemon zest.  

2)Lemon glaze: If you don't have confectioner's sugar on hand (like me), just mix the sugar/lemon juice together while the loaf is baking so there's plenty of time for the sugar to melt.  I also microwaved it to warm it up, and that helped the sugar dissolve.  Poking holes into the bread also helped the glaze absorb into the loaf very nicely.  

3) Sugar dusting:  When I had glazed my loaves, I sprinkled the tops very lightly with sugar... a little sweet touch that also gives the loaves a yummy shimmer.

4) Mini loaf cook time:  I made this into mini loaves as part of a birthday gift, so if you want mini loaves as well, baking them at 325 degrees for 40-45 minutes did the trick for me.  

Altogether a wonderfully flavored bread - thank you for the recipe!

I've made this recipe twice now and it's fabulous!  I double the zest to add extra lemoniness (is that a word??), and also poked holes in the cake so that the glaze would soak in.  I also subbed butter for the shortening, used half whole wheat flour and used poppy seeds instead of walnuts.  I DID try it with walnuts once, and it wasn't as good as with the poppy seeds - plus only white flour isn't as good as the half whole-wheat.  Maybe both walnuts and poppy seeds would be nice?  Sooooo good with a cup of warm tea in the evening once your kitchen's all clean!!

Turned out very well. The lemon I had was small/medium and so I used two instead of one. This added a more lemon note which my family enjoyed. I also used confectioner sugar for the glaze instead of white sugar. The final piece was beautiful and very moist. Note: This could be outstanding with a thicker icing instead of just the lemon sugar glaze.

This turned out great!  I made mine with whole wheat flour and Smart Balance instead of the shortening and it still turned out ALMOST perfect.  It was a little dry around the corners, but really good still.  I might bake it for 50-55 minutes next time instead of the full hour.  I added the juice of half a lemon to the bread batter to make it more lemony, and used powdered sugar for the icing.  Really good and I don't have to feel guilty about eating it with the modifications that I've made!

The most refreshing bread I have ever had!  It's sweet, yet tangy, and has the most beautiful texture.  It is like a fluffy lemon pound cake, and the glaze makes it glisten as well as tingle your tastebuds.   Everyone loved it.  I tripled the amount of zest, and next time I will probably add even more.  Mine only took 51 minutes though, so I am glad I was checking on it the last twenty minutes.

Great recipe! This lemon bread is truly exquisite. I find though that by adding an extra teaspoon of lemon zest, it gives a better, more lemony flavour. Delicious! =)

Have used this same recipe for nearly 30 years and it always gets rave reviews.  One reviewer stated that recipe did not say when to add lemon juice so she added while creaming eggs/shortening. The recipe does NOT call for juice in the bread but used as part of the glaze. I poke holes in top of bread after baking and then spoon juice/sugar over top of loaf. Glaze soaks right into cake giving a nicy lemon flavour.  If you prefer a tarter bread, add a small amount of juice or lemon extract to batter.

Perfect for an afternoon tea time.  However, 60  min in the oven was really too long.  It should be closely watched after 50 min.  I added extra lemon zest and mandarin orange zest instead of nuts - it adds a pretty orange bits in the bread.  delicious!

I made a few substitutions out of necessity: butter for the shortening and some lemon extract for the zest. I also mixed in sliced strawberries instead of the nuts. Holy summer in a loaf pan, Batman. It really is more of a cake than a bread - very moist and dense - but calling it bread makes me feel better about eating it for breakfast;). Definitely don't skip the glaze, it really isn't complete without it.

I agree this is a wonderful recipe, but if your goal is simple lemon _bread_, this is not your recipe.  The lemon flavor is found almost entirely in the glaze, not the bread itself.  That said, when you add the wonderfully bright and tangy glaze to this beautifully textured and moist bread magic happens!

This was pretty good.  Lacked flavor in the actual bread itself, but the glaze (I made with powdered sugar as per other reviewers rec's) saved it.  I added the zest of one large lemon to the glaze to make it extra zing.

AWESOME CAKE, moist, rich and great lemon taste.  I used the zest from one medium lemon in the batter and the juice from that lemon for the glaze (also added  more sugar).  I think using that much zest addded a lot of flavor to the cake.  I also used butter (salted) so I skipped the tsp of salt and that worked fine.  Mine needed a little more time to cook and cool and when I took it out of the pan it fell apart a little.  Next time I will wait for it to cool almost completely before adding the glaze.

My son loved this! He finished 1/4 of the loaf in one sitting. I added 2 tsp of lemon juice and used a butter flavored shortening. I only baked it for 45 mins.

Fabulous! I left out the nuts but otherwise followed the recipe. It was done in 45 minutes in my oven.

I just made this because of all the great reviews.  I am dissappointed, it was too dry for my taste.  I cook and bake often, so it will not be a recipe I'll try again.

I made this the first time for a bake sale at the church.  The second time I made it I kept half for myself.  Great tasting bread, though I baked it in a bundt pan, I'd like to find a way to 'bread' it a bit more so that it has the texture of a banana bread instead of a cake.

Loved this bread so much!  I decided to have this bread for part of the Easter Brunch Menu.  Everyone who tried it were amazed at its taste.  Tastes like a sweet lemonade rather than tart lemon taste.  The icing makes it even more delectable. I highly recommend this recipe to all who enjoy trying new recipes!  Thanks Gwynne!

This recipe is amazing!  It makes a lovely, very lemony loaf.  I use the zest from one lemon, and substitute orange juice for the milk for a even more citrus flavor.

Very, very, good!  I just had a slice of this and it has such a tangy lemon flavor (what I was looking for), although I atribute that mostly to the glaze (I used juice of 2 lemons & added slightly more than 1/2 cup sugar), but overall taste is yummy!  I too also added extra lemon zest and used butter instead of shortening.  Mine was also ready at 45 min (could've even taken it out at 40 as the sides & bottom were a little overdone).  Question: should it have risen even to the 9x5 pan?  Mine rose about 1/2 inch at it's highest point from the initial batter height. Still good, will make again!

This was so easy to make, and so delicious and moist. To put the glaze on, I poured it on and used a basting brush to spread it around. Then I poured the extra glaze back into the bowl of glaze; it worked out really well. I took advice from two other reviews, the one that poked holes in the bread before putting on the glaze, and the one that used salted butter instead of shortening and left out the salt.

Great recipe. I took the advice of the previous reviewer and used 1.5 tbsp of poppy seeds in place of the nuts. I would continue to do that in the future. This cake really needs the glaze to taste lemony. If I were to make it without the glaze, I would have to add some lemon extract to the batter.

Wanted to add this for the reviewer that said one detail was missing...."when to add lemon juice". I followed his/her advice and then realized the reason it doesn't say WHEN is because it's for the GLAZE not the bread itself. That particular reviewer stated he/she didn't make the glaze. It's too bad this reviewer is one of the first ones that pop up. Now I don't have the juice I need for the glaze. :(   My fault.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I took a tip from one of the reviewers to poke holes in it before adding the glaze. I will make this again with the addition of poppy seeds next time. Yum!

Per another's review, I added 2/3 C lemon juice, which was a good call. I love super lemony breads. I didn't have any walnuts, so I used pecans. I'm still on the fence about adding nuts to a bread that just seems to beg me to use poppyseeds instead. :) Left off the glaze because I just didn't feel like making it. Either way, this is delicious and my husband has been really enjoying it for his breakfasts this week.

Delicious, lemony bread with a cake-like texture and sweetness. I made some changes based on others' comments. I used butter instead of shortening, 1 1/2 Tbsp poppyseeds instead of nuts, and added the juice of one (small) lemon to the batter, along with 1/2 tsp of (homemade, so strong) lemon extract. I also used about half lemon zest, half orange zest, and substituted 1/4 c orange juice for half of the milk. Definitely watch cooking time. Mine was done after only 45 minutes--good thing I checked, since I didn't believe it would be done so soon. I poured the glaze on as soon as I got it out of the oven and let it soak into the bread. It worked great, although I had trouble getting it out of the pan after it had cooled some. It's very good but I find it a bit too sweet. Next time I won't use orange juice and may reduce the sugar in the glaze.

This was pretty good. I used the zest from 2 small lemons in the bread, and used the juice of about 1.5 small lemons for the glaze (I tasted the glaze while adding the juice to decide when to stop). I also left out the nuts and added poppyseeds instead, which was delicious. It's a very thick batter, and it goes from "not done" to "over-done" very quickly, so watch it! For my oven it took about 45 mins and it was already starting to dry out a bit. But the glaze really gave it back that moisture.

This recipe was amazing and quite addictive.  I made two small loaves so I could freze one to have on hand.  he first loaf was gone almost instanly and the second one was gone the next day.  I then had to make some for work and it was eating up instantly.  Thanks for an amzaing recipe, this will be used often.

An easy quick bread to make. I made it into mini loaves (the batter was enough for 6). I used the juice of one lemon in the batter AND to brush on top of the loaves after they came out of the oven. I love the subtle tartness of the cake which was balanced well by the amount of sugar and the crunchy poppy seeds. When they first came out of the oven, it was very moist and light - almost cake-like. After a day or so, it's texture was a bit drier like the usual quick breads.     I found it weird to cream the shortening, sugar and egg together at the same time. It took longer than usual to get everything together. Next time, I'll do it the usual way with shortening + sugar first, then the egg. I don't know how it'll turn out, but I bet it'll still be delicious. =)

I think some reviewers didn't read the recipe properly- the lemon juice is for the glaze, not the bread.  The zest (rind) is for the bread.  I really enjoyed this bread, the glaze is fabulous!  I will make again and double the rind amount- I didn't find the bread to have enough lemon flavor to it. Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe and made one loaf and 12 muffins.  I agreed with a previous reviewer that the bread was baked in about 45 minutes.  I added the juice of 1/2 lemon to the batter.  I also used powdered sugar to make an icing instead of a glaze.  Still gives that "lemony" kick without being sticky.

why anybody would want to ingest shortening I don't know.  Shortening is disgusting as there is nothing remotely healthy or tasty about it to me, someone who puts his health first.  However this recipes got a lot of reviews and I needed to bake something for a friend.  I siubbed the shortening for butter.  The bread did not rise however previously I have had this experience baking banana bread and I believe the cause is not creaming the butter and sugar FIRST then adding the eggs one at a time, not as it is written above (creaming sugar, butter and eggs together).  Could the reason also be because the baking powder might have expired?

More of a cake than a bread. It did not have any lemon flavor (except for the topping). I love lemon, so I was very dissapointed.  I will not make this again.

Excellent! I purchased a new bread pan from my favorite cooking store and this christened it. I was not disappointed! I omitted the walnuts but otherwise made to recipe. Outstanding. What is nicer than a slice of glazed lemon bread and a cup of tea? Thanks :)

Very moist and tasty.  I love that it is made with real lemon instead of flavour in a bottle.  I look forward to trying it again with a little more zest and some poppy seeds.

This bread is WONDERFUL!  I used butter instead of shortening, no nuts, and about twice as much zest.  This bread is not only very tasty, it's also beautiful!  Thanks for this recipe.

Very yummy lemon bread!  I was looking for a recipe to use poppyseeds in and thought this would work.  And it did!  The glaze is so good.  I made three mini loaves and it only took 30 minutes.

Incredible!!! I can't say enough how delicious this bread is! It comes out so moist, doesn't fall apart when you cut it, has an amazing flavor.
I added poppy seeds to mine and a little more lemon zest and I actually added a little freshly squeezed lemon juice to the batter to give it a bit more lemon flavor. It probably doesn't need it though.
Also, the key really is the glaze. It adds such a tangy, crusty, sweet taste. Everyone I've made this for asks me for the recipe. Thanks so much Gwynne!

This is the ultimate recipe for lemon bread!!  It is very moist, and full of lemon flavor.   I used two medium size loaf pans, cutting the baking time to half an hour. I increased the zest by almost double.

I think it is the best use of lemon flavor so far, neither too tart nor too sweet.

This project has taken me out of my comfort zone, and introduced me to the the treacherous world of BAKING ??.
Actually, it was very rewarding - I found I could create deliciousness with little effort!

I used butter instead of shortening. Also, took alterations from other commenters adding a whole lemon juice to batter as well. So lemony but not too lemony! Plus for glaze used powdered sugar instead, way better!

I agree with another reviewer that this recipe needs more lemon flavor - followed exactly the first time, with just the lemon zest inside the actual cafe and it tasted like a regular pound cake.  Second time, in addition to the lemon zest, I added 2 TBS of lemon juice to the cake....better but still needs more lemon. This recipe is just ok - I will keep trying until it I get it to the 'that's awesome' point.

This makes a really nice bread! Today I didn't have a lemon, so I tried it with a small orange. Turned out great! I decided to warm the glaze in a pan, and forgot it a moment- oops! It boiled and turned it to a candy! Used it anyway, but now it's got a thicker glaze to it. Next time I'll just add more juice to the sugar and skip warming it to help it dissolve.

Despite most everyone saying it was moist,, one person didn't which raised a flag for me. So, instead of 6 tbs. shortening,  I used 1 stick of butter, (8tbs), I also used 3 eggs instead of 2. I also as a matter of practice put my timer 10 mins. ahead of time since all ovens are different and baked goods continue to cook somewhat after being removed from oven.  Doing these 3 changes made the bread moist and not over baked.

Excellent and easy! Made this two days in a row and second time I added more lemon zest and a little more flour. I also added an egg white to get bread little more fluffier. It was devoured AND I made this with gluten free flour and lactose free butter!

I couldn't believe how well this was to make and it's addictive.  I added poppy seeds to it because I had no crushed walnuts on hand.

Love this recipe.  Use butter instead of shortening and add a little fresh lemon juice to batter.  If you are using granulated sugar boil it with the lemon juice and pour over the bread while it is still hot (and before removing bread from pan)  If you have issues removing bread place parchment inside the bottom of the pan and let it hang a bit over each end - when cooled just lift the loaf out via the parchment paper.  I like to add poppy seeds instead of the nuts but both are very good!

Mine turned out more like a slightly lemony bread-bread. I know it's called "bread", but I expected more of a moist, cakey banana bread consistency. I followed the recipe except used pecans instead of walnuts. Disappointed in this recipe.

Great recipe! I used other reviewers idea of lemon juice in the mix--juice of half a lemon. I also put about 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream in the mix because my batter seemed too thick. I meant to use plain yogurt, but picked up wrong container, but either works.  Delicious. Oh, yeah, I also used powdered sugar for glaze. It worked just as good.

This is a wonderful recipe, though have not tried with the glaze.  I make it using sugar substitute and it tastes great; even better when I add about a cup of blueberries.  Thanks for an easy dessert for a practicing diabetic with a sweet tooth.

Great way to use lemons from my tree and milk that is "on its way out."  I add lemon zest, the juice of a whole lemon, vanilla, amaretto flavor, and almond slivers to the batter. I also used butter as I did not have shortening on hand.

The only changes I made were to increase the zest in the batter and to use confectioners sugar for the glaze. My husband went nuts over it! He had two large slices and would have had more had I let him. Thank you!

Good. Made into muffins instead of bread so they would cook faster. Did not put glaze on. This recipe says it makes 12 servings, but it made more like 9. Will make again.

It came out over-cooked, dry and non-lemony in flavour, even after I soaked it in the lemon juice/sugar glaze.

I was looking for a way to use the lemons from our Meyer lemon tree and found lots of lemon bread recipes.  This is the first one I made and it was excellent; however, I doubled the zest, cut the sugars in half, and used powdered sugar in the glaze.  I also used butter.  Delicious.

Made exactly as recipe stated.  The bread was good, the glaze waaayy too sweet and I looovvvee my sweets.  I would cut sugar in half.  Glaze came out a little grainy but not sure if that wasn't because I had to run out and left my husband to do that part!  Only gave 4 stars due to the too sweet glaze, with half the sugar it would definitely be 5 stars!

This is really good, but pretty crumbly the last few times I've made it.  It seems to help using butter instead of shortening.

First time I made this and it's super delicious, and moist! Instead of walnuts I put cherries. And I put lots of lemon zest, for the glaze I used lemon juice and powdered sugar.

The bread part was fine with the mentioned addition of extra lemon juice and flour... but the glaze basically ruined the whole loaf.

I'm a lemon lover. The glaze is great. The bread was very dry. It tasted more like a plain quick bread with walnuts. The lemon taste was more of a hint. I may try to tweak this, but wouldn't make it as written.

My family LOVED this recipe! We enjoy lemon-just-about-anything, and this was so easy to put together. I did make some changes, using butter in lieu of shortening, and bringing the sugar/lemon juice glaze mixture to a low boil (dissolving the sugar more completely that way) before pouring it over the cake. I changed the lemon juice/sugar ratio, as well: 3T white sugar to 6tsp lemon juice. 

Mmmm! The smell alone is wonderful! The glaze makes a nice "crust", which adds a nice contrast to the delicate crumb texture inside the cake.

I made this bread for my husband to take to the office to share.  I made two small loaves which still needed to bake for 40 minutes.  I increased the lemon zest to a heaping tablespoon.  I heated up the lemon juice and disolved only 1/4 cup sugar which was plenty of glaze for me.  I thought it was wonderful and got rave reviews from my husband's office staff.  I did have problems getting one loaf out of the pan, that one stayed home with me. NBaker

I used butter for the shortening, and it was excellent.  Sweet and tart, and so moist.  I leave the loaf in the pan when I pour the glaze over so it soaks in well.

I've made this bread a few times and it is always delicious. This time I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup and substituted canola oil for shortening. I used orange extract, orange zest, and craisins. Delicious!

Delicious recipe. Very lemony and moist. The recipe lacks a few key instructions. The lemon juice should be added before the milk. Juice some additional lemons for the glaze. The glaze should be made with powdered sugar and poured onto the bread before you take the loaves out of the pans. Cool a bit and then take the loaves out of the pan to cool. I chopped the walnuts very fine. I have been searching for a recipe which would turn out lemony and moist this is the recipe. I did add the zest of two lemons to the recipe. PERFECT.

Delicious, but I did make the following changes: 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 white sugars, added poppy seeds and squeezed a lemon into the batter after the milk was blended.  I also added a half cup of wheat flour and just one cup of the white.  High altitudes, add at least 10 minutes to your cooking time.

Great! Never fails and everyone enjoys it.  I make the glaze by using lemon juice and turbinado sugar.  This gives it a really crunchy top.

The syrup is what really makes this lemon bread so good.  The cake itself does not have a lot of lemon flavor but it's still very tasty.  I did not add the nuts and it tasted fine.  Next time I'll add some more zest and a little lemon juice for flavor.

Good but not fantastic. The glaze melts. I made it a second time and waited til the bread cooled before added the glaze. Still, the glaze did not harden (like icing). Will try another recipe from this site.

I thought this was a very good lemon bread; however, next time I will definitely add more lemon zest to the batter and I think a glaze made with powdered sugar would be better (this kind turned out way too runny for me). With some tweaking I think this could be a great recipe for lemon bread.

At first I was a bit disappointed because, while the glaze was very lemony, the bread itself wasn't that lemony.  But on the second and third day, it grew on me.  I too traded poppy seeds for nuts.

I made one with all purpose flour and white sugar, as the directions said, and one with whole wheat flour and brown sugar, just to see how it would come out.    I gave the white one away and kept the brown for myself.  The brown one rose more than the white one.  

I think 60 minutes is too long.  Even cooking 2 loaves at once, the edges of the white loaf, which was in a metal pan, seemed a bit burnt.  The brown loaf was cooked in a glass pan and did not burn.  Both of them came apart a tiny bit when I took them out of the pan.

This bread wasn't at all bad.  It just wasn't very lemon-y. I even substituted lemon juice for some of the milk and added extra lemon zest. I poked holes all over to let the glaze (which was amazingly good and why I gave this 4 stars instead of 3) soak in and that helped some but the bread itself didn't have much lemon flavor even after the changes I made.  My kids liked it tho.

Pretty good. I used a small handful of dried cranberries (which I softened with water in the microwave) instead of walnuts. It worked well enough. I'm not a big fan of nuts. The cranberries make it pretty much a breakfast / dessert bread. The glaze is so simple, but so good.

This was definitely easy to make, and while I'm not a huge lemon fan, my guests that ate it really enjoyed it. Like others, I traded out the nuts for poppy seeds. I'll definitely make this again since everyone that ate it seemed to enjoy it.

Really good. I left out the walnuts. Very moist light and fluffy. The glaze is just great. Within half an hour of adding the glaze I only had quarter of a loaf left! Many thanks.

This recipe is almost exactly like the recipe on the side of the Imperial Sugar bag.  The difference is that it uses butter instead of shortening and a little less milk.  Anyway, this bread is very tasty.  It's a bit stumpy (didn't rise that much) but maybe I needed fresher baking powder.

Very good bread. I also used poppy seed instead of nuts, and increased the lemon zest. I got raves on this one!

This was good but not great.  I probably would not make it again.  Still searching for the perfect lemon loaf....

If there  were  more stars I would have clicked on that. This was absolutely delicious. I put a dollop of lemon curd on a slice and  topped  it with whipped cream. GREAT dessert!! This is a keeper.
