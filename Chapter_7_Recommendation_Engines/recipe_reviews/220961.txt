Made this with Easter ham from a week ago. - Oh what to do with all that left over ham.  Made this and was skeptical. My family loved it - and they are very finikey. Yum! Clean plates - everyone loved it! Thank you. Didn't change a thing!

This was a very tasty and hearty meal!! I was looking for a recipe to use for leftover ham and this one is a keeper! It's quick and easy and my fiance loved it. The only thing I changed was that I added about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and some green beans. Thanks for the recipe! *Update* I had this next day and added salt to it and it was PERFECT! I thought the ham would be salty enough and didn't want to oversalt it...I was wrong. Add extra salt!

Ultimate decadent comfort food!  Too bad I only have leftover ham about twice/year!  This recipe is basically the same as my au gratin potato recipe with the exception of adding the ham and cubing instead of slicing the potatoes.  Also used a combo of sharp and extra-sharp cheddar cheese.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum! Very tasty. I changed things up a little based on another au gratin potato recipe I've made before. Used 4 T of flour and 2 C of milk to make a little more sauce. Used 2 C of shredded cheese and added salt, pepper, nutmeg, cayenne, and mustard to the sauce. Didn't feel like cooking anything ahead of time so layered the potatoes, onion, and ham raw in the pan and poured the sauce over it. Covered with foil and baked at 375 for 90 minutes. Excellent! Worth all the peeling and chopping.

This was really good. I didn't boil the potatoes, I just cubed them and fried them in a skillet with some oil, diced onions, diced peppers, some garlic and a splash or two of chicken broth. Of course, I added salt and pepper to taste. Once the potatoes started to soften I mixed in the cubed ham. When it was done I put it in the casserole dish and topped it with the cheese sauce and breadcrumbs and popped it in the oven. The only thing I would do differently next time is omit the breadcrumbs. I didn't feel like they added anything to the dish and, in the 25 minutes the dish was in the oven, they didn't really brown. So, it was like I just had raw breadcrumbs on top soaking up the cheese sauce. Other than that I will surely be making this again. It was a great use for leftover ham and very yummy!

We tried this last night and I wish I had taken a photo to post bc it looked great.  Slight changes just to speed it up.  We used 2 cans of canned diced potatoes and a can of peas.  It was delicious and very easy.  Great way to use leftover ham.  Worth a try. Thanks for posting!

I made this with leftover ham and veges from thanksgiving dinner.  My husband is an avid casserole hater and he went back for seconds.  He said he really liked this! I added some celery, carrots, red and green peppers that were left over from our relish tray.  I boiled the celery and carrots with the potato and saut√©ed the peppers with the onion.  A very tasty one dish meal!  All I had for bread crumbs were Italian panko crumbs, but they added a nice flavor.  Enough left over for lunch tomorrow.  I will make this again.

This recipe was great and utilized a few things that would have gone bad if I didn't use them soon (namely ham and potatoes). The only thing I did differently was add a bit more flavor for fear of my toddler not liking it. She definitely loves her spices. I added a bit of garlic powder and chili powder to the ham and onions as they were cooking. And I sprinkled on crushed rosemary before the bread crumbs. My whole house smells like rosemary potatoes (YUM!) and the taste is phenomenal. Definitely making this one again.

I made this recipe with adding crushed red pepper as the only tweak.  I found that 1/4 cup bread crumbs were quite generous.  I added a picture.

This recipe was comfort food personified.  I used frozen chunky hash browns and added a bit of yellow mustard for flavor.  Otherwise, I did it exactly as directed.  The sauce cooked up smooth and creamy.  This one goes into my recipe book.

I had some ham leftover from Thanksgiving and I made this for dinner tonight.  It was very good.  Even my husband had seconds on this.  I will be making this again when I have lefto over ham.

Super Yum, definitely a keeper & going into regular rotation!  This is a great standard recipe that is simple to prepare, versatile, and frugal.  I used red potatoes and left the skin on, I grated a block of swiss I had instead of cheddar, and I incorporated some baby carrots I had by slicing them into coins and parboiling them at the same time as the potatoes.  Otherwise, I prepared as written.  My whole family cleared their plates and I got a third meal out of a 10 pound ham (traditional ham dinner, this casserole, and froze the ham bone with remaining ham for a pea soup next week).  This is a very tasty meal that will stretch my food budget a little farther, thanks for sharing!

This is very similar to another recipe I use, so I changed up the method a little bit. No need to pre-cook the potatoes; simply cook the entire casserole for an hour, covered tightly with foil, then uncover and bake for an additional ten minutes. I sliced the potatoes and layered them with the ham in the greased casserole dish (next time I will layer in some frozen peas for some color), then I poured the sauce with the sauteed onions over the potatoes and ham, taking care to make sure that everything was coated with the sauce so that it would cook through. The breadcrumbs were a nice touch - I used Panko. There were NO leftovers!

Hearty and quite tasty. A hit with the family. A few to many potatoes for me. I may add carrots and decrease the potato next time.

Instead of using leftover ham, I purchased a 1 lb package of pre-diced ham. It worked great. I used boiled redskin potatoes and they were very moist and tender. This is yummy comfort food! But if you are afraid it will be too bland, add onion powder, garlic, or a sprinkle of dried mustard, cayenne pepper, or chipotle powder, or a few drops of hot pepper sauce.

I doubled the recipe as I always do (still not enough LOL) and it was fantastic.  Per our taste I  saut√©ed 2 cloves of fresh garlic and 1 stalk of celery with 2 small red onion and added oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme, crushed red pepper flakes to the veggie mix and added about 1 Tbs of dry mustard and a few shakes of red pepper sauce to the cheese mixture (8 oz of sharp cheddar and 8 oz of cheddar jack).  I added just a dust of italian bread crumbs on top which really doesn't add much (personal taste). I did peel/cube my russet potatoes and parboiled them prior to baking @ 350¬∫F which took approx 40min (doubled recipe). My family LOVED it so thank you for the base recipe! We really enjoyed this one!!! I will definitely make again & again!   Bon App√©tit

Wow! This was incredible! I used leftover mashed potatoes from Christmas. I had a houseful of testosterone men with hearty appetites and this filled the bill. I did add garlic and some season salt to the bottom mixture. Will definitely make again!

So good that a serving was taken out before I could take the picture. :) Very good, easy recipe. I topped mine off with some shredded cheese before adding the breadcrumbs. Would definitely make this again.

I was looking for a simple ham & potato bake that wasn't complicated or too fatty. This worked out well. I used half the butter, a little less cheese, and chives instead of onions. It turned out to be delicious! We made steamed green beans & carrots on the side to make a full meal.

Best We've had so far!  I have been looking for a recipe that tastes similar to the Marie Callender's Family size Scalloped Potatoes with Ham, this is it!  I added in some personal taste like onion salt instead of regular salt, and we didn't have any breadcrumbs, but everything else was verbatim.  Big hit with the whole family, including 7 yr. old twins with different tastes in food.  Thank you for a keeper of a recipe.

This recipe is easy and delicious!  My family all loved it.  It took me a little longer than the time stated, but I grated the cheese myself and probably cleaned up after each step.  I may use less onion and add celery the next time.

Great use of ham leftovers!  Everyone loved it.  The only complaint was that there wasn't enough ham in it.  I would double the amount next time.

This was awesome.  Very cheesy, especially when made with sharp cheddar.  As other suggested, I added some chopped celery, red pepper and carrots, plus some frozen peas to make it a full meal.  Next time I will add more potato, though.  Agree with another reviewer's wife with that. LOL  Made this with the leftover ham from Christmas that I had frozen.

this was very good.  i sprinkled a little rosemary in the white sauce, along with the ham and onions....just a little bit.  also added a little onion and garlic powders to the sauce.  my DS went back for seconds, and that barely ever happens!  thanks for the post SweetT!

Our family thought this was awesome... Instead of doing the milk and flour we used cream of mushroom soup and 1/4 cup milk... ( we didn't have the amt of milk needed so we improvised)  excellent!!!

I thought this dish was OK, but nothing special.
I pretty much made it exactly as written, except that I bought "new" ham instead of using leftovers, and I shredded my own Cheddar from a large block. I should note that a 1.5-quart baking dish would not have sufficed for me. I only had a 2.5-quart dish, and it was nearly filled. (I think that maybe my "small" potatoes were larger than they should have been.) I thought the cheese sauce was nice, and I ate it all over several days, but it just wasn't exciting, sorry.

This was delicious - I normally don't give 5 stars if I change the recipe, but all I did differently was I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth and then added some garlic powder and a tsp. of Dijon to the white sauce. It would be easy to add other veggies or use chicken or change it up a bit with different spices, etc. Good basic recipe.

Update 4/15- so I Mae this recipe again to the book. Lot
Less cheese and it still was phenominal. The real key is getting the butter, flour, milk mixture correct. Low and slow and season with salt/pepper as it‚Äôs cooking. Much like any other cooking try tasting your creation while it‚Äôs cooking with a few puffs on a spoon. This recipe is legit and my wife who hates ham cleared that  in about 2 minutes. 

Old review - I made this recipe with a half ham I thawed out the night before and it was fantastic. Three things about this casserole i would do for sure. 1) put the 3 TB of flour into the onions and add milk only until its a thick peanut butter consistency. some of these pictures the sauce looks way to watery  2) Use a huge  white onion 3) I used red small potatoes and about 8 of them. I also threw in some red pepper flakes which helped liven it up a bit but didnt need it

Made this tonight. It was okay, but we like jazzed up food! So, here are changes I made: 1. For bread crumb topping I used a slice of buttered toast crumbled. 2. I added green onions to top after baking, then also added melted cheddar to very top. I am thinking crumbled bacon on the very top would also be good.

This was very yummy. Very rich & creamy... not for the calorie-conscious! I added a few good shakes of garlic powder to the sauce and it really made a good difference to the taste. Otherwise I think it might've been a little bland. I cut the amount of cheddar cheese in half but topped the dish with a few slices of pepper jack cheese I had to use up before topping with the bread crumbs. This would probably be good with mushrooms in it. To those of you who found the sauce too runny, be sure to bring it to a boil before adding in the cheese. This thickens it. Thanks for the recipe!

Hard to go wrong with this one. Ham, potatoes, and cheese sauce, yum. I added broccoli cause I felt like it, it was also good.  We almost ate the entire thing, which can't possibly be healthy, but we couldn't stop ourselves.  Good use for a leftover spiral ham. Thanks for sharing, we'll definitely have this again.

I made some minor adjustments to the recipe but I think that's the fun of cooking. I used slightly larger potatoes so I doubled the onion and cheese sauce. Next time I will use smaller potatoes and still double the sauce because we like cheese in this family. I also used a generous amount of garlic because you can never have too much garlic. I also added extra cheese in top because, like I said, this family loves cheese. :-)

First time we made this the cheesy topping was too thick and the casserole contents were dry. Taste was still good and we put leftovers in tortillas with sour cream and hot sauce for breakfast burritos. The second time I made this with more cheese and more milk. ( I used mozzarella and Monterey Jack this time... My boyfriend doesn't like cheddar, but these two cheeses are a bit creamier than cheddar anyway.)

This is a hit. This is one of those great recipes that you can tweak according to your families tastes! I don't wait for left overs, I buy a ham slice (thick cut) and cube. I follow the recipe until I get to the bread crumbs part, as the first time I made this, the bread crumbs didn't get crunchy. So instead I added saltine crackers that I crumbled in my hands, over the top of it all, then added dollops of butter over the crushed crackers and baked accordingly. WOW, what a great buttery, crunchy addition this made. Necessary, no...but yummy, YES!
P.S. This time I used a certain brand of packet cheese that is called Triple Cheddar and contains Vermont White Cheddar, Sharp Cheddar and Cream Cheese. Very creamy.

This was so yummy!!  Very simple but extremely tasty!  Both my husband and son liked it.  I used golden potatoes, which I think made a better choice than regular Russets.  I also used half-and-half instead of the milk.  It's what was on hand and it worked great!  I have made this twice in the past few months and will continue to make it - it's definitely a keeper!

I made a ham for just so I could make this after! My picky ones love it as much my hubby, Who had 3 helpings. I made as written the first time and it was great. Thus time I used crushed corn flakes on top which gave a slightly salty/sweet combo. I'll keep the corn flakes next time. Love everything about this recipe.

This is the best recipe that I've made in the last year and the left overs were so good for lunch.  I used 2% velveeta for the cheese but otherwise followed the directions.  Such perfect comfort food and I'll be making this again soon.  Doesn't get much better than this!!

This is very good as published.  The second time I made it, I added one teaspoon of dry mustard with the flour (in the white sauce), and half of a large bell pepper, cubed, with the ham and onions, sauteing until soft.  I used corn flake crumbs the second time.  I'll make this again.

My husband loved this! Used leftover spiral ham from Christmas (the still-meaty bone is going in the soup pot). I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I used a low-fat mozzarella and though probably more subtle than cheddar, it worked well. I also added a can of peas and used panko bread crumbs on top. (To be honest, I burned the top a little putting it under the broiler to brown the bread crumbs, but it just added to the flavor!)

Very good!! Next time though I'd use more ham (maybe 3 cups). I also used a Tex mex mix of shredded cheese. This gave it more flavour I think. I also would use less bread crumbs on top. Some of it was still dry. Over all, a great way to use up leftover ham.

This casserole took me about an hour to prepare, but it was worth it.  I knew this was going to be a winner with my midwestern born husband and I was right.  He said he was almost ready to faint with pleasure.  Ha-ha!  The only change I made was to cut up a piece of toast into 1/4 inch cubes as a topping instead of using canned bread crumbs.  I wish it would have had a specific amount of salt to add, because I had to keep sprinkling in more, and I have no idea how much I ended up adding.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!!

My picky eaters liked it. I substituted for shredded gouda for a slightly different flavor. Definitely making again, but it's missing something. Very good and filling, but not scrumptious.

Recipe made exactly as written and it came out great.  It is the ultimate comfort food, on par with mac n cheese casserole.  There is ample cheese sauce for recipe which will help when heating up leftovers (there are only 2 of us). My preference would be to add a little heat, but my husband said not to change a thing:).  So I had a bit of  pickled jalapenos on the side. Served with green beans. Perfect! We enjoyed it, and the request was made by my husband to add to our "regular rotation".  Thank you SweetT!

Family lived this dish. I only added a 1/4 cup corn and peas to give it more color.  I wanted a dish that didn't have a can of soup in it.  It was so creamy and the bread crumb topping gave it a nice crunch. Will definitely make again

I followed the recipe as is using my leftover ham from Christmas.  I saute the onions and cooked the potatoes and made the sauce and put everything in a casserole dish covered with cheese and French's fried onions.  we really liked it.

I have made this dish a few times now. My husband and I can‚Äôt wait for leftover ham at Christmas or Easter so I can make this. I follow the recipe for the most part; the only thing I add is 1/2 tsp ground mustard to the cheese sauce to give it a bit more flavor.

Made per recipe except instead of cooking the potatoes first, I cubed them raw and baked the dish at 375 and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. Great way to use leftover ham. Thanks for the recipe.

I made it with our leftover Christmas ham, and it was excellent. I did not boil the potatoes like others suggested, I just made smaller cubes and increased the cooking time by about 10 minutes. I used Panko instead of breadcrumbs like someone suggested and it was a better flavor and held up better while cooking.  So an hour in the oven with the raw potatoes and then uncovered for 15 to brown and crisp the Panko.

OH yum, but used 2 1/2 quart baking dish, added more ham and frozen "southern style hash brown diced potatoes", instead of coming home and getting potatoes ready! Also I have  enough for 2  dinners for 2!  Probably added more to the cheese mixture, as i make mac and cheese often, and know the amount!  Good stuff for leftover ham!  Maybe add broccoli?   Next time!

I used green onions instead of a regular onion, just because we prefer them.  Also, I added quite a LARGE dash of rosemary, which will definitely be a regular addition. To the cheese sauce I was 2 oz. short on shredded cheese and added a couple slices of pepper jack, which, in my opinion, gave it a nice little bite. I did not use bread crumbs at all, just seemed unnecessary. My boyfriend asked me why I never made this before and I told him that I just found the recipe! He said that it better become part of my rotation, he loved it and said it was even better the second night when I heated it up in the oven with a little extra cheese on top. Definitely a keeper!

Yum! Made exactly as written with the exception of cubing the potatoes instead of slicing which I learned from a previous potato casserole recipe. I think the potatoes turn out much better. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I was annoyed by how many dishes I had to dirty to make as instructed (pot and colander for potatoes, skillet for ham and onion, sauce pan for milk and cheese and the dish to bake it in).  It was a meal in itself and better than regular scalloped potatoes, which I find kind of bland, so I would make again.

I love this recipe! Its very easy to make and its delicious. My whole family always asks for seconds. I followed the recipe exactly, but one time I switched the bread crumbs for French's fried onions, and both were a hit. Great for leftover ham.

We loved this! Yummy! I added garlic powder and ground mustard to the cheese sauce. Also used panko for the bread crumbs. Gave it great texture oh the top. We will make this again with leftover ham!

I used to make this casserole gosh, 40 or so years ago!  But I used to use grated Swiss cheese instead of cheddar.  It makes fir a different taste!  Lots if buttered breadcrumbs in top. Yummy. The ultimate comfort food. I‚Äôm making it again!

Added green pepper (because I needed to use it) and used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs on top.  Had some chicken gravy left over, so I used that instead of the butter called for to make the sauce.  Added dry mustard.  This recipe is a nice basic one, and can be adjusted to one's taste.  Love the homemade cheese sauce, but would double the amount next time.  Easy on the stomach and a great way to use leftovers!

Since I was making this for just 2 I changed it a little.  I added some chopped green pepper to the onion and cooked them before adding the ham.  Instead of making a cheese sauce, I heated a can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup with 3/4 can of milk.  I then poured that over the ham and potato mixture.  I left out the bread crumbs.  My husband thought it was very good.

Entire family loved it (including my picky 10 year old)!  I forgot to defrost the chicken breast that I had so threw them in frozen and poured the sauce over top.  I cooked it the full 6 hours but they were probably done at hour 5 because they were almost shred-able.  I did strain the sauce into a pot and added cornstarch like another did.  Served it over basmati rice.  Definitely one to make again!

Good recipe for using that leftover spiral ham. We are a small household and always have leftovers as spirals hams are usually 6 pounds or more. Next time I am going to try the breakfast recipes

This is an excellent recipe.  The only change I made was to omit the bread crumbs--I forgot them.  I don't think the recipe needs them but when I make it again I will add the buttered crumbs.  Thank you for a delicious recipe.

Tasted good, same basic cheese sauce as most mac'n'cheese recipie's and I think the macaroni would hold up better than the potato's.  
Don't boil the potato's until done, they will finish as you bake it.

So delicious! I used white cheddar for the sauce and didn‚Äôt have any onion for it, but everything was still so yummy and we had the leftovers for breakfast the next day with an over easy egg on top. 

What makes the difference in this dish is flavorful ham and flavorful cheese! If you pick bland options, the dish will be bland. So choose your Easter or Christmas ham wisely!

Really good! My husband, went back for seconds. I did do a few additions from the other review‚Äôs recommendations I added dry mustard, paprika and onion powder. My own contributions were canned chopped mushrooms and I topped with panko breadcrumbs AND fried onions (like you‚Äôd put on green bean casserole), I really liked the extra crunch!!  I think I did something wrong with my roux, it was a little grainy. We use all lactose free stuff so it‚Äôs possible it was that but mixed in your mouth with the potatoes, it didn‚Äôt make a big deal.

I added diced mini yellow peppers, mushrooms and a clove of garlic since I don't use a lot of salt.  It was great!  (I also used my pressure pot to cook the potatoes for 15 minutes while I was cooking everything else up cut off some of the prep time) Just an fyi!

I made this just as the recipe says but it was just ok. If I ever make this again, I would cut the cheese in half. Just too much for me. A little less sauce might be better too.

I like the recipe, but I used swiss cheese  (12oz) instead and a little more ham. I also used marjoram, thyme, and a little cayenne to give it some flavour..

Tossed in some green beans, went easy on the salt as the ham was already salted.  Would definitely make again.

I made a half recipe of this and it‚Äôs was delicious . I did only use 3 potatoes  and 1 1/2 cups of ham. Used a whole can of the soup and really think if you were making the full recipe you would need 2 cans. Other then that I made it as written and got rave reviews. Will be making this again!

Excellent! I doubled the ham and probably used larger potatoes  than called for.  90% of the cheese I used dairy free and soymilk and it still tasted awesome. My 8 yr old ate two helpings and she rarely asks for seconds of anything. A year later, we all still love it. It is an awesome way to use dairy-free ingredients and no one can tell the difference.

Success!! I added garlic, bacon, and a fresh jalapeno. On the top I added shredded cheese and instead of bread crumbs I did the dried onions that I had left over from the green bean casserole. I also doubled the gravy and it came out SO good.

The whole family loved it. Used chopped up leftover roast potatoes and ham. Add less cheese in the mix. Sprinkled the rest with the bread crumbs on top. Quick, easy, and delicious!

I made it exactly as written. Next time I might cut back a tad on the butter. My husband loved how soft the potatoes were.  I boiled the potatoes and while they were draining I whipped up the cheese sauce in the potato pan, saving one clean pan.  I might add garlic and some herbs next time.

Didn't use the breadcrumbs (per another review) and cooked potatoes first (lightly roasted in oven).  Cheese was mixed with ham and potatoes.  Rue was poured over all then baked.  Delicious!

This was fairly quick & easy.  Only difference I had to make was using panko (did not have bread crumbs on hand) and panko is always great.

Since the recipe is basic, you're going to get basic (which I don't mind with leftovers).  It tastes like potatoes, cheddar cheese, and ham...which is a half step below a loaded bake potato. We're going to go all the way next time and top with chives, sour cream, and bacon after it's done baking.  Might even leave the potato skins on next time for that full baked potato flavor (and maybe coat the pan with a bit more butter).

Will make again and find other ways to doctor it up however even as is, it's a decent & simple recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight with my leftover ham and also leftover parsley potatoes.  It was delicious.  I also added a large stalk of celery finely chopped with the onions and ham and before I put in the cheese sauce I added 8 oz. of mixed vegetables.  Will be making this again since I froze some of my ham.

I was so excited when I came upon this recipe because my mother made this for many dinners.  She never put cheese in her‚Äôs, that I can remember, so I tried the Cheddar and liked it.  I used Veleta cheese the second time I made it and liked it even better.  I also cooked carrots in the microwave and added them into the casserole which gives it more color and balances three of the food groups together.  This is a hearty easy to make casserole for home dinners or cover dish dinners.  Anytime I‚Äôve taken it for my lunch my coworkers say it looks and smells wonderful.  Needless to say I‚Äôve shared the recipe with many coworkers and family members.  This is definitely COMFORT FOOD especially on frigid Winter nights!

We loved it!  The only changes I made were 1) not to precook the potatoes  and I should have 2) used leftover swiss cheese and the cheddar.  It was delicious and will definitely make again.

Excellent casserole!  I used this recipe as a starting point.  I used leftover spiral ham that I cut into bite size pieces.  I peeled and partially cooked potatoes in the microwave and sliced them on a mandolin.  I layered the potatoes and the ham in a casserole dish.  I sauteed chopped onion and celery with crushed garlic.  I added some basil, crushed red pepper and thyme to the sauteed vegetables.  I made the cheese sauce with pretty much every cheese I had in the refrigerator-a small chunk of cream cheese, a small chunk of Gouda, some grated cheddar, some pepperjack and even a few slices of American cheese.  I added a good squirt of grainy dijon mustard, some Penzey's roasted garlic and onion powder and some seasoned salt and lots of Penzey's ground black pepper.   I added the vegetable mixture to the cheese sauce and poured it over the casserole.  I gave the casserole a few good shakes and poked it with a knife in multiple places to get the cheese sauce to go down into the layers.  I used plain  bread crumbs seasoned with Emeril's Essence.  I made it for dinner for my husband, myself and 2 of his college buddies.  All 3 of them went back for seconds.  SO good!!

Perfect.  Very rich.  Basic meat and potatoes casserole done right.  I fried the bread crumbs briefly in butter before topping the casserole.  Dutch oven worked nicely to cook it in.

Glad I doubled this! Had TONS of leftover Easter ham. Left out the onions because I have a few picky eaters and didn't miss them at all. Just a simple recipe with ingredients I already had on hand. Will try with pepper jack cheese next time!

Turned out great, I used pre sliced package ham rather than left over ham.  Next time I will use less cheese it was just a little to cheesy for my wife and I.

I made this exactly as written. Turned out burnt and could only eat from the middle.  So I would diffidently not cook it for as long as stated in the recipe. What wasn't burnt was okay but I will not make it again.

I used yellow potatoes and left the skin on and whatever cheese I had on hand. I make my own bread crumbs from the ends of the bread which are whole grain.  I didn't add the salt and pepper because I felt there may be enough seasoning  between the ham and the cheese and that turned out to be enough for me. Everyone's tastes are different,  some like more salt and pepper,  some less,  this way it can be seasoned to individual taste.  Otherwise followed the recipe. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again!

My family absolutely loved this so much we're going to try making it with ham steak so we don't have to wait for the next occasion when we cook a large ham. The leftovers of this we're almost better than the original night I made it.

This was a great recipe that turned out delicious ! The cheese sauce was incredible. The only alteration I made was that I had leftover baked potatoes from the night before so I simply peeled and chopped them.  
This actually saved me a lot of time!

I made this recipe exactly as written first and my family loved it! I tried it again with frozen shredded potatoes since I was out of potatoes and it also turned out well. Lots of pans to wash, but it was a great leftover ham recipe that stretches the holiday leftovers!

This was excellent! I only boiled the potatoes for 15 minutes instead of 20 because they were diced so it didn't take that long. I also had large baking potatoes so I only used 3 of them. I think the onions really added flavor to this dish, we went back for seconds and thirds. If I make this again, I would also add more ham next time!

I made this last night with my leftover Christmas Ham and it came out delicious. Husband loved it. The only thing I did differently was to use Gruyere Cheese instead of Cheddar only because I had to use or lose it. I think any good melting flavorful cheese would have tasted just fine. I also used a little cream with the milk again only because I had to use it or lose it but it worked just fine also.

Very good. I'll make it again. Only difference was I used Mexican 5 cheese blend (8 oz) and about 1 oz cheddar.

I made this on Thursday and delivered it to my kids (adult children) at their school/condo's. It was gobbled up then they  requested it again for family dinner a few days later. A big hit!

It was good! I was a little hesitant about the cheese sauce, but it ended up being perfect. I added green bell peppers to the ham and onion and also sprinkled with garlic salt and crushed red peppers. I also topped it with Mozzarella cheese. The perfect easy dish for my left over ham.

This dish is amazing.  The only thing I did differently was I used baby potatoes that I cooked in advance.  I also didn't peel them.    I put the potatoes in with the ham and onions and cooked for a little bit.  This is an amazing recipe!  I will be making this whenever I have leftover ham

Would make again. Added garlic salt for the regular salt, a serrano pepper and a green bell pepper. Also cooked the potatoes in a pan rather then boiling to keep them al dente.

There are probably more intricate recipes out there using richer ingredients, but we are sold on this one.  I work from home, so am the "designated cook" on weeknights.  We just call this "cheesy goodness" in our house.  Don't limit yourself to cheddar --- baby swiss, colby jack, even parm works, so long as you mix with a creamy cheese of some sort.  Good recipe which has become a staple here... thanks!

I added a little garlic powder, Onion powder, chives and some parsley flakes. I also mixed in probably 2 teaspoons of Frank's hot sauce and some sour cream. It was delicious! It wasn't hot just gave it a little flair!

I added garlic and rosemary to the sauce!!!
This was amazing!!! SO SO SO happy I tried it!

I took the lazy man's approach...boiled water and threw in the potatoes celery and onion till soft, 

mixed up the cheesy white sauce w/o measuring,  then threw it all on top of my left over ham in the casserole dish.

I was worried that the sauce I made was too thick as it only sat on top, and I spread it over the top all the way to the edges and covered it with bread crumbs. I was afraid the sauce wouldn't mix with the veggies and ham properly, but it did! 

Everything was perfect! All my family LOVED it! I ate three portions! Enjoy! I will definitely be doing this again!

What a great recipe!! I mixed in some green beans and chicken breast as well to make it go a bit further for my family of 5. I also used a touch of ground mustard. My family is in love. This will absolutely be making the rounds with my leftover ham from now on!! 
Thank you!!!

I made this with leftover Easter ham. The only things I did differently were to only boil the potatoes for 10 minutes and just lightly sprinkled some garlic bread crumbs on top before baking. It was very good! I'll definitely be saving the recipe to make again.

Quick, delicious, comfort food. I had to thin out the sauce with some half & half, and added chopped green pepper for color & extra flavor.  Another keeper!

Made this recipe with the leftover ham I had from Easter and it was definitely a good idea to use this recipe. I substituted the breadcrumbs with panko, which worked out just as well. 
Great recipe! Thanks again.

Perfect for cheesy potatoe lovers! 
I have made this dish several years now, as is without altering a thing. I'm not a big ham fan, except for this dish! After the 1st time, my husband bought a ham a week later so we could have leftovers to make it again! It went that quick with just 2 people!

This was an ok dish I guess. When you first get it out of the oven and the cheese is creamy, it's ok, but when it starts to cool the cheese starts getting thick and it's not as good. I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe was great. My picky eaters even asked for seconds. The only thing I did that was different was that I sprinkled shredded cheese on the top for the last five minutes. Next time I make this I'll definitely have to double the recipe.

This was really good... changes?  Yes, I made the sauce in the same pan where I sauteed the ham and onions so I could get all those delicious drippings, and then since it was cast iron, I put the potatoes and the ham in that same pan and baked it in the cast iron.  Oh, I sprinkled some parsley in there as well.

It is a very good starting point. The recipe has good bones and would be good a starting point for some. I added celery, mushrooms and garlic to the pan with onion.  I love that recipe did not call for cream of something soup.  With the additions that i made it was a big hit with the hubs and kids.

Very,  very good. Easy too. I had some half and half and some heavy whipping cream to use up so I used those in place of the milk. Added a little onion powder because my onion was VERY small and I love onion. Also instead of the plain bread crumbs I added a little bit of the Italian bread crumbs, which didn't make a huge difference, as it would be excellent either way. I will be making this again at Thanksgiving! Yummy. Kid friendly too! :)

I didn't have an onion. So I used some onion powder and skipped the butter/onion/ham in the skillet part. The cheese sauce turned out perfectly. The entire dish was yummy (might need more seasoning for those who like a more seasoned dish) and went great with a side of peas and carrots on a rainy day.  I'll probably make this again.

Wonderful! My husband and sons said they liked it, but they always say that. (They are good boys!) I knew it was a winner when they all got up for seconds!  I used new potatoes and just microwaved them whole for 10 min,  then diced them. Served with steamed mixed veggies and garlic-sauteed spinach.

I've made this several times now, using leftover Christmas or Easter ham, and it's always a hit even with the kids.  It's great as written, but easy to change seasonings or types of cheese to suit your taste.  I personally like to add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the sauce.  I like to bulk up the sauce a little to make sure the casserole isn't dry or bland.

We liked this as written.  Four stars.  We liked it more after whisking in a pinch of cayenne and a dollop of Dijon to the sauce before pouring over ham & potatoes.  

I also omitted the first 3 tablespoons of butter and used 1 Tablespoon of olive oil.

Just made this for my people - and it was inhaled.  I used sweet potato chunks as that is what I had for left overs and it still tasted pretty good! I am sure it would taste better with regular potatoes.  Next time I think I might add in a little bit of corn just to add some crunch and colour.

I added some extra Italian seasoning, used a little more cheese than what the recipe called for but other than that followed it word for word. It came out delicious!! My whole family loved it, it was super easy and fast to put together and make. It's definitely now my go to recipe for leftover ham!

Hamsgiving. The leftovers that keep on giving. I omitted the bread crumbs, and this was still awesome. I used half and half that I had in the fridge in lieu of milk, and it just added to the creamy texture of the extra sharp cheese sauce. Per another reviewer, I still added salt to the sauce (against my better judgment), and it was perfect!

This is a great dish, and all the other reviewers on this are spot on.  I over cooked some potatoes, and ended up with a a quasi-mashed potato variation on this.  My daughter and I loved it this way, but my wife thought it needed more potatoes - but she is a potato-holic.  I will definitely be making this again in the future, and will be careful about overcooking next time.  It will likely work best with the left-overs as suggested, instead of cooking them from start to finish.

Made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I enjoyed it very much.  Made per recipe other than I used a bit more onion and put some grated cheese over the top ten minutes from the end.  Highly recommend - you will not be disappointed.

This recipe is great! I cooked the potatoes in a skillet, rather than boil, added asparagus, onion & the ham once veggies were tender. Think next time I will add bacon. very delicious!!!

Absolutely loved this one, but instead of onion I used jalape√±os and I left out the paprika and I used velveeta cheese. Very yummy.

This was so good! Although the family didn't gush over it, my husband told everyone they couldn't have seconds because he was going to eat the rest. Of course, my 8-year-old had already taken seconds. I saw my husband go back three or four times for more, which is very rare for him. There was some leftover, but I am eating it now for lunch and it's every bit as good as it was last night. 

I made some fresh broccoli to go with the meal, and it was a great accompaniment. The only change I made was substituting bell pepper for onion (didn't  have any onions at home).

Absolutely amazing!  I did everything just as the recipe called for, except for using 1 1/2 T of butter when sauting the ham and onions, and it turned out soooo yummy!  My 3 kids, who normally don't like potatoes because of the texture, ate this up and asked for seconds!  The cheese sauce is to die for, and I look forward to using this cheese sauce in other recipes- I'm thinking Broccoli casserole?  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Kids loved it, I loved it, only suggestion use a bigger baking dish. I used a 1 & 3/4 quart and it overflowed. I will be making it again. I may even try a little cayenne pepper or chili powder next time.

This was a great recipe, so heartfelt thanks for posting, SweetT! I doubled the recipe for a crowd and made these variations per reviews /for gluten free: substituted gluten free flour, and fat free half and half, crumbled gluten free bread slices (I didn't even dry them). nom, nom...

Amazing dish! Added in green beans (fresh or frozen) for something extra (let it cook a bit longer, until beans were soft). So good, will purchase ham just to make this. Family loves it

This was a nice easy way to use some of my frozen left over ham. I had everything on hand.  My changes were that I added Paprika to the cheese sauce and a sleeve of Ritz cracker in place of the bread crumbs.  I wish that I had coated the potato/ham mixture with the cheese sauce and I wish there had been a little acid bite somewhere--garlic or mustard maybe.  All in all I'd do it again--Everybody ate without complaint and with seven kids that's no small feat.

This is too easy for how good it is. I didn't add any salt to the white sauce because after I salted the potatoes and mixed it with the ham it had enough salt. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

Use cheese - no cheese soup, no substitute  - it needs it for flavor/taste. Good. Very similar to other 'ham casserole' recipes listed.
