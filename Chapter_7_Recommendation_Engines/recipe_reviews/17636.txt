This was quick and absolutely delicious! My hubby and 10 year old son enjoyed it very much. Goes well with homemede bread. I didnt make the entire recipe...i used 1 lb hamburger,1 can vegetables...and left the rest the same. I did add some water (about 1 cup) to this also.

Pretty good and simple stew. I added a little garlic, red potatoes, and fresh parsley flakes. Turned out really good.

I've been making versions of this for years, its a really good meal. I prefer using frozen mixed vegetables, though.

I made this last night...Next time I will use less pepper than the recipe calls for but overall it was really good. For the veggies, I used 1 can corn, 1 can carrots, 1 can green beans, and about 1 cup of frozen peas.  You could use whatever you have around the house in this one.

Do not worry about using 3 lbs ground beef - I used about 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, canned green beans and corn and fresh onion, carrots and celery.  I also used a can of beef broth plus 1 can water to cook the potatoes.  I added a bit of Italian seasoning and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to step it up a notch. 
Pure comfort food.
