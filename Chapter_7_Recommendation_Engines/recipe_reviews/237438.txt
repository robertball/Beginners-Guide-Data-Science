These were pretty good! Maybe I'm a wimp, but this was VERY strong(I thought it was just me, but then when hubby mentioned it, I knew it just too much) ...I would reduce the amount of tequila next time, for our personal tastes. I still prefer regular margaritas w/ lime, but this was nice for a change. Thanks for sharing. :)
