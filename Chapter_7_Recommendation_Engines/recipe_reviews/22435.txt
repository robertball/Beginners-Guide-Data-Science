Very good -- the texture is like chocolate mousse but the taste is a little bit different because of the yogurt.  It's really quite pleasant and had to believe that it's low fat!  I used ultra low fat whipped topping instead of the light that the recipe calls for so it was even lower in fat.  You really do have to use gelatin-free yogurt or it doesn't drain at all.  The drained yogurt is like a sweet cream cheese -- it adds the richness of a cream cheese without the fat.  I will definitely make this again but will double the recipe next time!

Surprisingly good, although the nutritional content is not all that different from "real" lowfat chocolate pudding, but it's also not as cloyingly sweet as regular pudding.

This is a great fat-free treat.  Used Fat-Free Cool Whip and Dannon Fat-Free Plain Yogurt - added my own vanilla.  I also used Equal rather than granulated sugar.  I added a total of 4 tablespoons of coffee (instead of water) in with the cocoa.  Mixed in 6 packets of Equal to the cocoa after the heat step.  Very good.  Slightly tangy, but not so much that I minded.  You really need to use a good quality cocoa powder. Never missed the fat.  Froze half in popsicle molds to make my own Fudgsicles.
