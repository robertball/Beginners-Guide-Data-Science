TY Jen! for such a lovely recipe! It was absolutely the best paella I have ever eaten, simply delicious! The only changes I made were what proteins I used. Added small scallops, clams, instead of snapper and there were lobster claws at my grocer, so used them instead of the tail. The dish was full of seafood with not a grain leftover! Thanks again!

This was superb! It was also fun to cook with someone else, but it is easy to do alone. The flavors are incredible.

I'm from Alicante (Spain). Nice recipe, but more like a risotto.

I thought this was very tasty.  The only thing I did different was use clams instead of mussels.

I've made this twice now. My boyfriend goes crazy over it.  No chanegs to the recipe with the exception of the seafood - due to availability and price (we live in Munich) we have to make some substitutions.  Excellent and will make again.

First time ever making paella and it was terrific. Personally, I don't think you need to add all the seafood unless you have a ton of people over. We just used the shrimp and snapper and it was plenty for two.

This recipe was delicious.  Only one suggestion, cook almost all of the moisture out to develop the soccorat or crispy rice at the bottom of the pan.
