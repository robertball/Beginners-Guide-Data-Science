I ADORE this recipe! I actually have this same recipe from a co-worker, but what I use is the packaged slaw cabbage from the produce section, and I also add some of the flavor package from the ramen noodles to the dressing. Just taste it until it's to your liking. I also just toast the noodles, almonds, sesame seeds (and sometimes sunflower seeds) in the oven, rather than in butter. Just spread on a cookie sheet and toast at about 300 degrees and watch until brown.

Am I the only one who gets annoyed when people completely change the recipe so it bears no resemblance to the original and then give it a low star rating?  Like someone substituting spinach for the napa cabbage...seriously, that is not even an Asian salad any more.  sheesh.  Change it all you want, but don't then come along and rate the original recipe poorly just because your changes don't work out.  Thanks for letting me get that off my chest!

Way too fat for our tastes...changed to 1/4 cup oil, 3 tbsp vinegar, 3 tbsp sugar.  Didn't use butter at all, but toasted sesame seeds and almonds in oven at 350 for 7 minutes.  Every one raves over this recipe, and it's a lot healthier, with less juice in bottom of bowl. I also added the flavour pack from the ramen noodles to the dressing and it was to die for. Thanks for the great start though.

This was really great! My husband is a chef and soooo picky and he said he REALLY liked it and would eat the leftovers. I read through the other reviews and took the advice of a few others. I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, used rice vinegar, put 3/4 t of sesame oil in and put the 2 seasoning packets from the ramen after the dressing cooled. I also mixed everything in 3 separate containers and mixed just as much as we ate for dinner - good idea! I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro, 1 large can of mandarin oranges and 1 can of chopped water chestnuts to the napa cabbage for a little more flavor. It turned out great! We are having this again very soon. THANKS!

this is a great and easy to make salad...

with some modifications:

- i used a spinach mixture instead of the napa

- added some mandarin oranges and water chestnuts

- substituted olive oil (much healthier than vegetable oil) and only needed 1/4 cup, not 3/4!

- eliminated butter entirely and just toasted all the crunchy stuff

YUM!

Loved this recipe!! My only complaint (but will modify for future uses) is that it says "cool" the sauce mix, when really, I think that it would taste better chilled (apprx 1 hour?) before pouring over the salad. I also used the pre-packed/pre-shredded cole-slaw mix, which saved on time.  Next time, I will either buy a bigger package of the slaw or use one and 1/2 bags so that the oil mix doesn't create "soup" at the bottom.  Finally, I think I'll also add half chopped green bell pepper.  Overall, we loved and will make again.

Next time I will omit the butter and toast the almonds and sesame seeds just as others had suggested.  I also cut down the oil to 1/4 cup and may try cutting it down even more the next time I make this.  Tasty salad, all around, although I am still searching for ways to make this a bit healthier, maybe add more cole-slaw mix to give it more bulk.  I used one bag of pre-prepped cole slaw mix and thought it was a lot of slaw.  But once you add the ingredients and start mixing everything, the volume shrinks down quite a bit.  So again, maybe adding an extra bag of slaw, cutting down on the oil, upping the amount of vinegar and soy sauce, and omitting the butter may make this somewhat more healthy.  Oh, and I did add the seasoning packet that comes with the ramen, that added extra flavor.  UPDATE:  I still had tons of leftovers from when I made this a few days ago, so I added another entire bag of pre-mixed slaw, and again, it seemed like a lot, but when you mix it, the volume shrinks down.  Definitely just as tasty.  I will always use 2 bags the next time I make this, or, just use one bag of slaw, and just one package of ramen and cut out the butter and cut down on the oil as I had mentioned earlier.

This was great.. I also did not use the butter for browning the noodles/almonds/sesame seeds.  I just put spray PAM into the pan w/about 1 tsp of sesame seed oil and browned over low heat.  Once browned, I put one packet of the Ramen seasoning into the noodle/almond/sesame seed mixture.  I also eliminated the 3/4 cup vegetable oil and reduced to 1/4 c olive oil with about a TBS of sesame oil.  It turned out really great.  I ended up using one full bag of slaw mixture and a half head of Napa cabbage..

Excellent, easy recipe and delicious.  My only issue, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5, was the amount of oil.  I am going to try it with slightly less oil.

Really good salad.  I measured most of my ingredients free hand.  I didn't add the green onions (too lazy to chop...I'm feeling a bit under the weather today), but I don't think it made much difference.  I didn't add the sesame seeds because I didn't have any and added an extra spoonful of soy sauce and brown sugar.  Tossing some mandarin oj's in there gives it a nice touch.  I served this along with the Asiago Toasted Cheese Puffs from this site.  Thanks for this submission Juanita.

I halved this recipe to make 5 servings and 1/4C butter plus 1/4C oil for the dressing still seemed a bit excessive, so I made some (healthier) changes.  To toast the 'crunchies', I first misted the noodles/nuts/seeds with 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter' buttery spray, then browned in a Pam-sprayed pan.  For the dressing, I probably used a Tbs or less which was perfect as the dressing didn't pool at the bottom of the bowl.  Added some mandarin oranges to the original salad ingredients for a refreshing start to the night's dinner.  Thanks!

Great ‘Asian Salad’!  I followed others advice - I think I collected all the positive changes: 

- rice vinegar instead of white vinegar
- brown sugar instead of white
- pre-made coleslaw mix
- toasted all crunches without butter in oven at 300
- used ‘Asain’ Ramen and added a teaspoon of the packaged seasoning mix
- added a chopped green pepper
- used slightly less than 2/3 cup olive oil (olive instead of vegetable and less oil than called for) 
- Refrigerated salad dressing for about an hour, shake to remix before tossing
- kept crunchies separate until just before serving - toss and serve immediately 

Delicious! Will probably become my staple salad to bring for get togethers.

I make this A LOT. I do add some blanched sugar snap peas and blanched sliced carrots.  I also thicken the dressing with a teaspoon of cornstarch whisked in, and add a little more soy sauce.  It's a great salad, and seems to keep a little longer than a normal lettuce salad. (If there's any left.)

Very good!  I cut back on the oil and butter as others have done.  I read the leftovers were not great and I only have my son and I to feed.  So problem solved: I just keep the dressing and cooked crunchies (seperate) in the fridge and make up a small amount when we want some.  If you have only tried the pre-packaged cabbage -you MUST try the real thing Napa cabbage is so much better.

Great flavor but too many noodles. The very simple dressing was a great, balanced flavor, but there were way too many Ramen noodles and almonds; it overpowered the cabbage especially when eaten later after sitting in the fridge for a bit. 1 package of Ramen noodles and 1/2 cup of almonds is enough. I'd use the dressing on other salads; it was great tasting and refreshing. The only thing I changed was I added sliced cherry tomatoes to the salad. Make sure to wait to add the sesame seeds to the pan. Since they're small they fall to the bottom of the pan and can burn before the noodles get browned.

Phenomenal!!!!!  I use chicken flavored ramen noodles and add the seasoning packets to the dressing.  I bring this dish to a church dinner every month and am constantly asked for the recipe.  Recipe is very flexible - can use pre-packaged slaw mix, shredded broccoli, red or green cabbage, or any combination thereof.  Other nuts, such as walnuts or cashews can be used, and I sometimes toast the noodles and nuts in a 350 oven for about 10 minutes.  Using splenda will keep the cabbage from releasing it's water.

I have mixed feelings for this recipe - my boyfriend adores it but only after I altered it quite a bit. Original recipe has too much oil and not enough vinegar.  I also doctored it up with pepper and salt. My kids thought it was so-so.

Thank You, Juanita !  I served this at our Labor Day BBQ and everyone RAVED about how GREAT it was.  I took some advice from the reviews and used 1/3 cup oil, 1/4 cup rice vinegar and 1/4 cup white sugar.  I also added one tablespoon of sesame oil which seemed to give it an extra layer of taste.  I will definitely make this again in the future.

This was a great hit. Do all the chopping and shredding the day before, but don't put the salad dressing on until just before serving. It was a great  make ahead salad.  Thanks!

This dish is excellent! I used 1 1/2 bags of coleslaw instead of cabbage. I also made the entire batch of dressing and used it all. However, I did cut back on the veg oil by 1/8 cup and substituted this with sesame oil. The sesame oil adds so much flavor! This dish was a hit and I'll definitely make it again.  A tip when you're toasting the noodles, nuts and seeds: you can dry toast them in a large skillet over medium heat.  Toast the sesame seeds separately though because they sink to the bottom and toast quickly and may burn before the others are done.  Just stir everything around until it looks golden brown.

This was a hit at our Labor Day party.  I have only two suggestions: 1. Use 1/2 the amount of butter called for.  2. Add shredded carrots.  The carrots made the salad more appealing to the eye and gave it a more complex flavor.  This is a great picnic dish.

Very Tasty addition to the Easter buffet! To save time I used 1 1/2 bags cole slaw mix. 1/4 cup olive oil was plenty, and I added one packet of ramen seasoning to the dressing. I had several request for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper! :o)

I've made this salad twice now. The first time I found it had too much dressing.  The second time I made the dressing and only added to my taste rather than just dumping it all in.  It was fantastic!  Thank you for sharing!  I'll definitely make it again.

I love this salad!.. added some canned chicken to make this a meal.  I didn't have the slivered almonds this time but usually put them in along with some mandarin oranges and flat leaf parsley or cilantro...  :)

Excellent!  I didn't have cabbage so I just used a bagged garden salad mix instead and that worked out perfectly.  I microwaved the oil/sugar mixture for 1 1/2 minutes and allowed it to cool fully before adding the soy sauce and it thickened and emulsified perfectly using only a spoon to stir.  For the noodle/almond/sesame seed topping, I did cut back on the butter, used about half, and it was outstanding. I didn't think that I would care for the sesame seeds much but decided to add them anyway as stated and found that they impart a wonderful rich nuttiness to the overall flavor.  This topping would be great on other salads as well.  Also, I added frozen grilled chicken strips (cooked in the microwave of course) to the salad to make it a meal.  The whole family loved it. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was awesome! The crunch of the noodles, almonds and cabbage made this salad both unique and absolutely delicious. My kids aren't normally big on cabbage but they loved every last bite!!

This is so light and dang delicious. We do cut back on the sugar a bit, but just to save calories. Easy recipe to make, but packed full of flavor. Great for a meal by itself or side for a main dish. Highly recommend!

Thank you Juanita!  Not only I, but everyone else LOVED this recipe!  Other than substituting 2 lbs. prepared coleslaw mix for the napa cabbage and adding the ramen flavoring packets to mix, I followed the recipe exactly.  I couldn't believe it when my party of 6 devoured every last bite.  This was a BIG hit!

One of my go-to recipes when I carry a dish. I use seasoned rice vinegar instead of the white and also add about a teaspoon of sesame oil to the dressing. Soooo good! So the noodles do not get mushy I add them before serving. It is a keeper!

This was basically a good idea, but too sweet for our taste. Total time should be increased, as you have to wait for the dressing and the noodle mixture to cool off before you can combine them. Thanks!

This is a good start to an asian salad recipe. You can play with it to make it to your liking. I definitely agree with those that say serve the dressing on the side. I used chili/sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, gave the dressing a nice kick.

This recipe is a great start.  I am doing weight watchers and tried to use minimal oil and butter.  I think the flavor was great with just a few tablespoons of olive oil.  Also added mandarin oranges in their juice to cut back on the sugar.  I used chicken ramen noodles and the seasoning packets.  It was better using  nappa cabbage, added snap peas and slivered carrots to get even more veggies. YUM!!

Yum! I have tried other versions of asian salads and this one is the best.  I think toasting the noodles, sesame seeds and almonds is the difference.  I used two bags of coleslaw mix and added the packet of seasoning to the dressing.. Perfect !!

I make this salad for every barbecue we attend, and I'm always asked for the recipe. If I don't have almonds available I sometimes substitute peanuts or pumpkin seeds; either one works very well.

I absolutely love this recipe!  My family are not cabbage fans, so I substitute the cabbage for green leafy lettuce, very finely chopped and it receives rave reviews.  As others mentioned, save the dressing until right before ready to serve and toss, toss, toss.

Yummy!  I used a prepackaged asian dressing instead of making my own dressing.  I used "Soyvay Chinese Chicken Salad Dressing".  It was wonderful.  Everyone loved it.  I made it for over 200 people--just "up'd" the recipe to 50 servings and everyone got what they needed.

This was surprisingly good.  I didn't have high hopes for anything with Ramen noodles in it but it got a good rating so I gave it a try.  Glad I did.  My boyfriend and I both thoroughly enjoyed it.

Good idea, but as someone who is opting for healthier options i tweaked it a lot, therefore I can only give it 3 stars. I also would recommend not using butter at all..it doesn't make any sense what with all the fat in sesame seeds and almonds. i used the following - dressing: 1/4 C oil, 3 T vin, 3 T sugar (boil) & add 2 T soy sauce Salad: 1/2 box wheat spaghetti (pre-boiled), 1/2 C roasted almonds & 2 tsp roasted sesame seeds (mix). 3-4 C spring mix and 1 bunch chopped green onions, shredded carrots, and/or other shredded vegetables on hand to mix. Toss to Coat.

I have made this recipe twice, and the first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I made a couple of huge mistakes that actually turned out to be okay.  Therefore, I would claim this is a pretty foolproof recipe that you can't go wrong with!  The second time I made it, I mistakenly melted the 1/2 c. butter in with the the rest of the dressing ingredients instead of using it to toast all the crunchy stuff.  Side note: all of the crunchy ingredients really only need to be browned in about a Tbsp of butter...1/2 c. is not necessary.  I also added too much sugar into the dressing...I put about 3/4 of a c. instead of a 1/2 cup.  Everything was still very good and delicious though.  This time around I was too lazy to chop green onions up for it, and everything was still fine.  We didn't miss the green onions whatsoever.  I would highly recommend using the prepackaged coleslaw mix for this, I used that the first time I made it.  This time around my grocery store was out of it, so instead I just finely chopped up a head of cabbage.  I also only buy one package of the blanched silvered almonds (I try to cut corners on grocery bills where I can), which equaled about a 1/2 c. and I felt that was enough. I highly recommend this recipe because it's a nice, light, crunchy, different salad that complements most Asian dishes.

It was alright. I cut down the soy sauce as reccomended but still found it to be a little overpowering in the dressing, good with the first few bites, but afterwards it was too salty. I replaced the veggie oil with olive oil, and cut out the butter and sugar. That's probably why the salt was overpowering. I used spinach instead of napa cabbage, if you plan on eating this for leftovers, add the spinach when you serve the salad, otherwise it gets soggy. I also added mandarin oranges, which turned out to be my favorite part of the recipe. The idea to put the seasoning into the dressing was gold! But too many ramen noodles for the amount of salad.  Meh. maybe i'll try the original recipe sometime in the future.

This is a wonderful salad - however I halved the dressing and topping ingredients and it came out great.  I can't imagine using twice the amount that was on my salad.  I also drained my topping mix on paper towels after browning - this removed a lot of grease and collected a lot of over-browned crumbs onto the towel.  I added two broccoli tops, chopped in a small dice, and that added a lot too.

My favorite salad ever. I didn't even know I liked cabbage. I followed the directions this time and loved it. Next time I will use half of the butter (you can ommit it, but I just love the butter flavor). I will also use a little less oil in the dressing. If your nappa cabbage isn't very large this recipe will make too much dressing. I will also seperate the 3 sections for left overs. It was seriously so good and so easy. ALSO- if you have a food processor use that because I really like the small shreads of the cabbage. If you are just using a knife- chop cabbage into small shreads. This is a must try!

This is a great place to start. I'm sure it's great as-is, but I tried to make it a little healthier by following the advice of others and it turned out really well. My husband loved it. Changes: used EVOO for oil and reduced to 1/4 c; used rice vinegar; used Splenda and reduced to 3 tbs. Was still too sweet so I added a little fresh ginger and some chili garlic sauce for kick; used low-sodium soy sauce. Added shredded carrots, sliced snow peas and a handful of chopped cilantro to the slaw mix; tossed the crunchies with a little sesame & chili oils and baked for a few minutes. Also only tossed enough for dinner and stored the 3 components separately to avoid sogginess.

OMGosh! This is fabulous! I did make a few alterations as suggested by other reviews. 1) I toasted the sesame seeds ( black sesame seeds was all my store had on hand), ramen noodles & almonds at 300 until browned. About 10 minutes. Made the sauce ahead of time & made sure it was completely chilled before tossing with cabbage. Then I added the noodles, seeds & nuts on top. Will do this again with seared tuna next time. YUMMO!!

A good twist on a salad.  I don't care for cabbage but this is a good way to "disguise" it for me.  Warning- NOT a good leftover!

I made this last Saturday for an asian theme party and it turned out great.  The only thing I changed was the vinegar and sesame seeds with rice vinegar and sunflower seeds.  Would definitely make this again!

I just recently brought this to our neighborhood block party and it was a huge hit!  The key is to put this salad together right before serving so the noodles don't get soggy.  I used cider vinegar for the dressing which workd really well.

Great recipe- my husband's favorite! I always use a bag of slaw mix instead of the napa cabbage, which makes it so quick and easy!

I scaled back this recipe a lot.  The only head of napa cabbage I could find at the grocery store was HUUUUGE, so I got "celery cabbage" instead.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out... I'd never even heard of it before, but it was really good and I think it worked well as a substitute.  I used rice vinegar instead of white for a more asian flavor, and I cut *way* back on the oil.  I don't care for oil in dressings at all, and I think with all the sugar in the dressing, it should stick to the salad without a problem without the oil.  Next time I will simply omit the oil, or at the most put just a splash of sesame oil for flavor.  Besides the heavy oil, I thought the taste was fantastic and will definitely make this often because i thought it was pretty quick and easy and a nice change from standard iceberg salad with ranch.

This was an excellent salad (almost addictive) but I did make changes.  I used the oriental flavor of ramen noodles, two packages of coleslaw mix instead of the napa cabbage, and some rice wine vinegar in addition to the distilled white vinegar.  This recipe is a definite 'keeper'.  Thanks Juanita!

This was absolutely delicious, I cut the recipe in half and we have lots for leftovers, which is a good thing.  It is really important to keep everything in three separate containers in order to keep everything fresh.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Excellent blend of flavors and textures!
In my opinion, this recipe serves many more than ten people as a side dish- if you make a full recipe, I would say serves 15 generously. Might serve ten as a main dish salad.
I used 1/2 napa cabbage, and 1/2 broccoli slaw mix- turned out to be a great combo. Nice crunch from the broco slaw, great peppery flavor from the Napa. For our tastes, we used only half of the butter called for and fewer onions. I also like my salad to have a bit more "tang" so I added more vinegar than what called for, and for added sesame flavor, I used a touch of sesame oil in place of pure veg oil. Adjust the dressing to your liking after mixing it up!

THIS IS MY FAVORITE SALAD- MY FAMILY HAS BEEN MAKING IT FOR YEARS!!!  HERE'S A LITTLE TIP TO HAVE IT FRESH THE NEXT DAY (IF YOU HAVE A SMALL FAMILY)  USING 3 SEPARATE CONTAINERS, HAVE ONE WITH JUST THE CABBAGE AND GREEN ONIONS, ONE FOR THE TOPPING (SESAME SEEDS, RAMEN NOODLES, AND ALMOND MIXTURE) AND USE THE  THIRD ONE FOR THE DRESSING (THE VINEGAR, OIL AND SOY SAUCE MIXTURE).  THEN WHEN YOU WISH TO EAT THE SALAD AGAIN, PEOPLE CAN PREPARE THE INDIVIDUAL BOWLS!!  BESIDES, SOME PEOPLE LIKE MORE DRESSING AND TOPPING THAN OTHERS SO IT LET'S THEM CREATE THEIR OWN!!!

I didn't care much for this salad.  It was more work than I cared for.  It made a lot of salad, but unfortunatly it didn't keep well for the next day. The cabbage and noodles turned out soogy the next day.  The clincher was that it used a lot of oil for a salad. i won't be making again.

This salad was a huge hit at my childrens birthday party. I did modify it quite a bit but this was a great jumping off point since I didnt have a recipe for the dressing. I doubled the dressing and added more veggies. I added 3 ribs of celery thinly sliced, 1 can of water chestnuts chopped, and about 1 cup of chopped carrots. I also switched out the almonds for peanuts. And topped with chow mein noodles for garnish and crunch. It was absolutely wonderful. I had 4 people ask me for the recipe. I will definately be making this again. Espeically since I didnt get to have much of it, the bowl was empty quick! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Thanks for submitting this-it's THE recipe that makes it to all the potlucks these days.  I found that it is important to wait until just before serving to add the noodles so they remain crunchy.  Either I had a very small head of Napa cabbage  or I like veggies, because I needed to add a second head to get the balance of noodles/almonds to cabbage correct for my taste.  I'm going to try oven-toasting my noodles, seeds, and almonds next time for a healthier approach. (Although the butter did make the noodles very yummy!)

I like this version of the recipe a lot better than some of the other ones on this site. I didn't have any sesame seeds on hand but it didn't matter it still tasted wonderful. I urge anyone who is looking for a quick easy recipe to bring to a pot luck or holiday gathering, to try this one.

Oh my gosh, this salad is fantastic! It is basically like a cole sole with a sweent and sour dressing with a LOT of added crunch! It's easiest to crush the ramen noodles without opening the package first. Just pound the pakage with your fist on a counter until the ramen are in little pieces. (And yes, they actually are cooked without boiling!)

Very well received at a recent family party--got several requests for the recipe.  I made a couple of alterations to the recipe to reduce the fat content, though:  used 1/2 cup oil in the dressing, and also used about half the butter in browning the noodles and nuts.  Very tasty!

WAY too much oil and butter. I used about 1/3 the amount of oil and only a tablespoon of butter with decent results. Next time I will only use half the sugar as well and use an oil other than vegetable (maybe a combination of walnut and sesame oil).

Really good! Works well with broccoli slaw mix too. Mix the seasoning pack in while browning the noodles. Often add mandarin oranges.

Didn't have sesame seeds so I doubled the almonds and I toasted them first. I had 3 packs of ramen so I used them all and I added the seasoning pack when I was toasting the noodles in the butter. Used regular cabbage. Made it night ahead for a potluck next day. Delicious! I've also made this substituting red onion for green and stirring seasoning packet into boiling mixture. One time I ran out of canola oil so i did part olive oil.

Delicious with modification. I use 1/4 c oil, 2T vinegar, 3T sugar, and 1T soy sauce. Works with chopped broccoli and shredded carrots or bagged broccoli slaw. Im saving this recipe for sure.

Made this for my daughters birthday party and other than the "sample" I tried before I put it out it was gone in a few minutes! Multiple guests came back for more but it was so good there wasn't enough!  It's only been a week and I've already been asked to bring it to two different events!  Delicious!  I added a little more vinegar and sugar than it asked for the first time after tasting the dressing it seemed kind of too oily.  The extra sugar and vinegar made it perfect!  YUM!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I used the 1/2 cup of butter and thought that was way too much.  I will cut it in half next time.  Also, I used Apple Cider Vinegar in the dressing and served the dressing on the side for people to add the amount they wanted.  I used a large bag of shredded cabbage and there was enough dressing for 2 recipes.

I used red cabbage to give it some color and added salt to taste. I think the next time I make it though I will add chicken to it.

Changed some for what I had on hand. Omitted sesame seeds, used cider vinegar, and added carrots. Divided everything up for individual servings, considering adding strawberries and chicken for tomorrow.

Made this last night it was great!  But I thought the dressing was weak so I dumped it out and used 1/2 cup balsamic vinaigrette with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  I also cooked up some chicken chunks waited till they cooled off and added it in.  I will make this again both my husband and teenage boys ate every bit.

I loved this recipe!  I topped it with mandarin oranges (at my boyfriend's suggestion) and it was delicious!

Altered the original slightly because I did not have the other ingredients on hand- used balsamic vinaigrette instead of white vinegar; sugar in the raw instead of white sugar; pumpkin seeds instead of almonds; peanut oil instead of veggie oil.

I toasted the pumpkin seeds, ramen and sesame seeds in the oven without butter.  

Added a bit of sesame seed oil to the sauce.

Pan fried chicken chunks with sesame seed oil and seeds and tossed it all together.

Super yummy!!

As others have stated, this is an excellent base.  I think I will be adding chicken breast next time to make it more of a meal.  Definitely will be cutting down on the oil... maybe half, and will try toasting the noodles rather than browning in butter.  Added sesame oil which really gives it a great and unique flavor.  Also added celery and extra package of ramen noodles ('cause I love them!) and think it would be excellent with snow peas too.  Will make again for sure!!!!

SOOO delicious!  I can't wait to make this again.  I used the bagged cole slaw mix, and it turned out well.  I toasted the Ramen in the oven.  When making for just a few people, I will not mix in the Ramen until just before serving.  Otherwise, the noodles get really soggy if you want to have the salad the next day as leftovers.  I will mix up the dry ingredients just prior to eating.

With the modifications suggested by a couple other reviewers, namely reducing the sugar, oil, and vinegar, this recipe is absolutely delicious and very quick to make.  My family has made it a couple times now and we always enjoy it for a few days because it makes so much.

Great base.  I added grated ginger and 1/2 tsp of toasted sesame oil to the dressing, cut the oil in half as suggested by others. Substituted 3 TBSP Maple syrup for the white sugar and reduced vinegar to 3TBSP apple cider vinegar.  Didn't heat it because I didn't use the sugar.  Added orange segments.  Excellent.  Thank you :)

OH EM GEE is this good. Seriously, don't think about it, just make this salad. I only used one thing of Top Ramen package because I forgot to buy two and it turned out wonderfully. Plus it cut the fat down and that's a bonus.

Used everything but the cabbage (just had regular bag salad on hand).  Husband said, "This is the best salad I've ever had," just matter of fact like that.  I agree.  Great dressing!  Added pan seared mushrooms with balsamic vinegar.  Recommend making the dressing at least 30 min ahead of time so it can really cool down.

Very tasty, went nice with an Asian themed BBQ.  I modified recipe as suggested by others by cutting down oil and butter and adding water chestnuts.  I also happened to have a chicken breast in the fridge that was marinated in a Thai peanut sauce that I ended up grilling up, chopping into cubes and adding to the salad.

Great Salad. For a healthier version I did the following:
1) omit butter, brown seeds/ noodles in oven @ 350'F for about 10 minutes
2) Reduce Vegetable Oil to 1/4 c.
3)Used Bragg's Amino Acid, instead of Soy Sauce
4) Added 3 T. Fresh Chopped Cilantro. This is a delicious light salad and a hopefully better for you than the original.

I made this for a potluck at work...everyone loved it.  I used pre shredded coleslaw, left out the seeds & nuts (a coworker is allergic), & toasted the noodles without butter.  I also added a chopped yellow bell pepper, baby broccoli, & a can of mandarin oranges.  I also didn't cook the dressing....just mixed it all together & poured.  I had just enough left for my hubby to eat for dinner...he liked it very much, & told me to make more next time!

This was really yummy, but it looks ugly. It does not hold up well so don't make it for company unless you are going to serve it within 20 minutes. The only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars was the appearance factor.

I love this recipe and have been making it for several years now.  I especially love the dressing and the super yummy crunchy mixture.  With these two parts of the salad, I think you can use whatever type salad any way you want.  I usually just use a regular green salad along with a half bag of broccoli slaw. YUM!

Juanita, this was an excellent dinner on a hot mid-summer's day in Florida.  We had Wasa bread and assorted melons to accompany the salad and made it a meal.  But I have to say thanks to the "most helpful" reviews as well.  I added cilantro, water chestnuts, used rice wine vinegar and olive oil, etc., and the results were great.  Since there's only my husband and I, I'll halve the recipe next time.  This is a keeper.

This is the best salad recipe ever! So easy to make and wonderful flavor! I added shredded carrots for color and added another veggie too. Also used olive oil, used 3 packages of Ramen Noodles and about 3-4 tablespoons of sesame seeds. What flavor it gave to toast the noodles, seeds and almonds. I will make this recipe over and over. Will rty to add some breaded chicken to it next time.

I love making this salad to take to parties, etc.  I have also made it with some store-bought chicken tenders and cut them up to make family meal on the go.  It is GREAT for swim meets or when you need "cooler food" to go!  
I also add sunflower seeds and use olive oil instead of butter and sunflower oil instead of the veg oil.

This is such a yummy salad (though not very healthy)  I substitute sesame oil for the butter (about 1/4 c) and olive oil for the veg oil.  I also add a little more soy sauce.  Mmmm!

The sauce was phenomenal. I'd recommend trying this with Grilled Peanut Chicken, if that recipe tickles your fancy. This salad doesn't work well as leftovers, so don't make more than you can eat in one meal.

I added mushrooms, water chestnuts and some sesame oil.  It wasn't my personal favorite because I don't love cabbage, but it got rave reviews at our potluck and many people asked for the recipe.

This was yummy!  I will definitely be making it again.  We went the healthier route (it is a, afterall) and used the measurements MICKE suggested and skipped the butter and used the oven for the dry mix.  It turned out great!

I have used a simular recipe for years, just  "Toast" the noodles, and whatever seeds you like, you do not need to use BUTTER to brown them. Less fat too!

E V E R Y O N E  LOVESSSS this recipe.  I've given it to many friends and am always asked to make it.  For a short cut - omit all the crunchy stuff and buy Asian crunchies in the salad isle at the store.   I also use just the dressing for spinach salad and have added chick peas - yummy!

outstanding!!!! The only alterations I have made with this recipe is the fact that I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, rice vinegar, and add some baby asian greens to the mix. I have made this MANY times and everyone asks for the recipe! I make my dressing and leave it on the side for everyone to add themselves. This eliminates the "oily" residue at the bottom of your serving dish. I would give this six stars if I could!

This is now my favorite Asian salad recipe.  I thought the dressing was great and browning the noodles and sesame seeds before adding really makes the salad.  Great recipe!

I've been making a similiar recipe that I found recently; it has less butter and oil. It also had a shredded carrot, and 1/2-1 tsp of black pepper , which we liked. It didn't have soy sauce though, but I bet that would be tasty and will try it next time.  I ran out of sesame seeds once and substituted with some tahini in the dressing.  Tasted fine, but I prefer the seeds if given the choice.

This salad was excellent.  I made several changes though.  To cut down on the fat I browned the ramen noodles, almonds and sesame seeds in 2 Tbsp. olive oil rather than the 1/2 cup of butter called for.  I also cut the vegetable oil to 1/2 cup and the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I substited white wine vinegar for the white vinegar and broccoli slaw for the cabbage as suggested by other users.  Also, as suggested by another user I added 1 tsp. of sesame oil to the dressing once it was cooled.

I could not believe my taste buds!  This was so tasty! My husband never eats cabbage but he loved this.  I did use the suggestion to use the seasoned rice vinegar instead of the white vinegar and I am glad I did.  I would use less oil next time but over all LOVED IT!  Thanks!

I gave this recipe only **** because it does need some tinkering.  Like others, I reduced the oil, butter, and sugar.  I also used cidar vinegar rather than distilled white.  Since I was bringing it to a potluck with a huge crowd, I doubled the recipe (tripled the dressing) and added a pre-cut cabbage mix along with the Napa cabbage. This gave it more color and texture. I also added roasted chicken breast to make the salad more substantial. Needless to say, everyone loved it and the bowl was emptied.

This was great!! I am always looking for something to make a light supper and that is ready quick. This would be too much for just the 2 of us so I cut the recipe in 1/2. Also I used a little more than 1/2 a bag of Dole coleslaw mix which also has carrots in it. I added about 2 cups of cooked chicken breast chopped up to make this a meal. The chicken ended up absorbing the sauce so I made some more as I like sauce. I would suggest if you are going to add chicken and are cutting recipe in 1/2 like I did to go ahead & make the sauce as called out. As you toss it you can then tell how much you want and it will save you having to go back and make more. This is a great salad just as it is but if you want a meal thought I'de let you know how it turned out.

This is fantastic. Be sure you add the dressing just before serving, otherwise the ramen noodles become soggy. This would be a great main dish if you added chicken. It makes a large amount for two people, next time I will split the salad in half and make it for 2 nights. I used a bag of Dole pre-packaged coleslaw instead of cutting up a head of cabbage, so easy.

I've made this salad many times and it's one of our favorites.I do,however,add the two packs of chicken flavored Ramen seasoning into the salad dressing for awesome flavor! I also save half the crunchy toppings to top when serving.(the other half soaks up the yummy dressing and gets a little soggy!)

We have been making a close variation of this recipe for years at every cookout we have. The only difference is I don't brown the sesame seeds ,noodles and almonds which eliminates the butter. I also don't heat the oil, sugar etc.  We use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and apple cider vinegar instead of that white vinegar. And we use the seasoning packet that comes with the ramen. Everyone loves it. I might try adding the soy sauce to see what that does for it. I am always in a hurry so I don't ever seem to have time for browning and boiling but it comes out great anyway.

I have been looking for a salad like this for a long time!  I made it for a recent party and it got the best compliments from guests than anything else.  I would suggest making the noodles and sauce several hours ahead of time to give it plenty of time to cool before adding onto the cabbage.  This will become a regular salad for me.

The crunchy topping is fabulous! I cut the Napa cabbage into shreds, add grated carrots, snow peas cut on the diagonal and julienned red pepper for color. Prep and store these ingredients separately the day before serving. Right before serving, I gently mix the cabbage/vegetable mixture and put on individual plates. I also add chicken tenders ( marinated for 15 minutes in 2 Tbsp. Hoisin sauce and 1 Tbsp sesame oil, dipped in mixture of Panko and sesame seeds, and sauteed in oil) to the top of each salad. Then add the crunchy almond/noodle topping. We used Ken's Lite Asian Sesame with ginger and soy dressing. With the chicken it is a delicious and complete meal.

Didn't care for this. I think I will maybe add the seasoning packet from the noodles and I wish I had just toasted the noodle mixture in the oven and not in all that butter. My family just wasn't impressed.

I made this salad as an accompaniment to our dinner during our family reunion. All ages of people ate this and loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Fabulous, I'll make it again and so will many family members.

This has become a standard at our house.  Only change I make is to chop up a couple of cooked chicken breasts in the salad along with some mandarin oranges.  Goes from a side to a complete meal.

I followed the recipe for the most part but used red onion and added in the chicken flavor packet from the Ramen noodle package and cut the soy sauce back so it would not be too salty...wonderful salad!

SO! It's cabbage night over here at the house! The next time, I may toss some pieces of sliced chicken breasts, or bake some on the side. Mandarin oranges may be interesting as well. Thanks, cabbage!

This is so delicious and the Napa cabbage is a really nice choice.  I didn't have any ramen noodles so I added celery for more crunch.  This is especially delicious using Thai Peanut Dressing instead for a change.

Very good summer salad. I make an Asian Coleslaw similar to this recipe and everyone enjoys the flavors of the nuts, seeds and scallions. Mine is layered in a bowl, marinated overnight and tossed together before serving.

I give this 5 stars because it is always a crowd favorite and I am usually asked for the recipe. BUT I make a couple changes worth sharing.

First, I use baby spinach with either red cabbage or shredded broccoli mix added.

Second, I buy the oriental raman noodles because I add the seasoning flavor packet (to taste about 1/3) to the dressing after it is cooled.
Thanks Juanita, it is what I was looking for!

Tastes yummy. I used Broccoli slaw instead of cabbage. It was quicker and a bit more flavor. Next time, I wouldn't use an entire stick of butter. It wasn't necessary and a bit greasy. Also, I'd throw in 3/4 of the dressing, instead of all. But, I definitely will be making it again.

I absolutely love this recipe! My salad turned out perfect on the first try. :)

I made the following changes:
-- substituted extra virgin olive oil in place of the vegetable oil
-- substituted spring mix in place of the napa cabbage
-- added 1 cup of strawberries, halved
-- added 1 cup of mandarin orange wedges

Will DEFINITELY be making this dish again!!!

Most Excellent!  I added 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, browned and coarsly chopped, and 1 can drained and sliced water chestnuts.  I made this for my friend's retirement party, and it was a big hit.  Very tasty with lots of character.

Another excellent dinner salad.  We added orange chicken and it was a complete meal.  Here are my changes - I used only 1 pkg of ramen and it was plenty for my family of 4.  I browned the ramen/nuts/seeds w/ only 1 tbsp of oil.  For the dressing, I used about 2 tbsp of sugar instead and about 2 tbsp of oil  ~  This was plenty and it was nice and light.  I actually used regular cabbage in place of napa because i had that on hand and it was delicious.  My kids loved it and I will definitely make this again just the same way.

For a bit of change, I changed the Napa cabbage to Broccoli slaw.  I decreased the butter to 1/4 cup and the oil was decreased to 1/3 cup canola oil.  Also, to give more spice I substituted lo sodium Teriyaki sauce for the soy.  Then to finish, I marinated the vegetables with the Teriyaki sauce and only added the crispy noodle mix until ready to serve.  This preserves the crunch.  YUMM!

My husband liked it alot better than I did...but I think the problem was the butter. I would recommend alot less, it took the asian taste away. But the recipe itself was great and really simple to throw together....a nice, quick meal! I will try it again with that modification. Thanks for the recipe!

As written, this is a very good recipe.   As I modified it, I think I made it a GREAT recipe.   Some of the modifications I got from other people's reviews and some were my own idea.     My modifications were  - cut the amount of almonds in half - double the sesame seeds  - brown the noodles, almonds and sesame seeds in the over (no butter) 350 degrees for 10 minutes - add a tablespoon of sesame oil to the sauce  - add a half cup of cilantro  - add 2 tablespoons of sumac  For me, the sumac was the magic ingredient.   It seemed to really round out the flavor.

Amazing!  The dressing is a bit on the oily side, but the topping....ohhhh, the topping!  It took everything in me not to just eat it by the handful.  I made it for a family potluck and got rave reviews from everybody.  Next time I'll just cut back on the oil a bit.

LOVE IT!!!  I buy the brocolli slaw at the grocery store and use that instead.  I also toast the ramen noodles and almonds together.  I also add the ORIENTAL flavoring from the ramen noodles to the dressing before the boil.  SUPER!!!!!

Yum!  1/3 c evoo + 1 T Sesame Oil; rice vinegar; oven toasted all the crunchies w/butter Pam 350 - 8 mins; add the chicken ramen pack to the dressing (all per others' reviews - thanks!); also add shredded carrots. It's 105 today and this is a GREAT summer cooldown treat!  Can't wait to try again & add some shredded chicken.  Thanks for the post!

GREAT SALAD, I loved it and this being the first asian salad I have ever made...I made some minor changes to suit what I like.  I reduced oil to 1/4 cup and omitted butter all together and reduced sugar.  I boiled chicken and chopped that up.  I also used the package cabbage.  So, I added all ingredients plus the chicken in a big bowl, I mixed the dressing, used two ramen noodle flavoring packets, added about an extra tblsp more of soy and tossed to coat. EXCELLENT and filling.  You can play around with any nuts you like, I didn't have sesame so I used almonds and cashews and that worked fine. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was pretty fantastic but I got rid of the butter and toasted some various noodles and sesame seeds in the oven instead.  Then I tossed it all together.

I make this recipe a lot! but I dont toast the noodles, sesame seeds or almonds. I dont use the soy sauce, but I do add the season pack from the noodles to the dressing. I also add a large can of cooked chicken,drained. It is delicious!

When I decided to finally use up my napa cabbage, I turned to this recipe with low expectations. I halved the recipe and still had way too much. Surprisingly, I liked this salad as is but using only 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Next time, I would like to make sugared almonds, using brown sugar, and put on top of the salad. Also, I would like to decrease the butter to 2 tablespoons, use 2 tablespoons white sugar for the sauce, and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar for the almonds.

Awesome!  However, 1/2 of butter to cook the ramen noodles and almonds in is way toooo much --  Pam cooking spray will do the trick and cut the fat and calories.  I used broccoli/cabbage mix instead of bok choy -- this was really great!

Great! Just the recipe I was looking for. I used Pam instead of butter and a 16 oz. bag of coleslaw in place of the shredded cabbage. It made things a lot easier and less fattening without really altering the basic recipe. I can't wait to try this one out on others. Thanks!

Everyone loved this salad!  I cut way back on the butter and used just enough to coat the pan, I added sunflower seeds, plus I made the full amount of salad dressing but barely used any on the salad.  A little dressing goes a long way, so I suggest you pour a little at a time and stir it and taste.

This was a very good recipe. The only problem was finishing it that day/night beacsue left overs would be nasty and soggy. Called for too much oil. Also, I changed the raman noodles to chow mein noodles. Overall, a very good salad!

Oh, my gosh. That was the best meal I have ever made! It's FANTASTIC! Just note that it makes a TON of food.

I added chicken: I cut two chicken breastes into tiny little peices and cooked them in olive oil, soy sauce, and the flavor packets from the ramen noodles and then dumped it in the oil mixture to soak for a few minutes. The only thing, if you do that, you don't need to add as much soy sauce to the oil mixture at the end.

This recipe is the best version of this type of salad that I've tried. Totally delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little Asian sesame oil to the dressing and my husband and father loved it. I think that it would be delicious with the addition of some sliced, grilled chicken breast to make the salad a meal (and I'd feel a little less nutritionally guilty eating this salad as the main dish instead of as a side dish!).

I used a bag of coleslaw mix to make it easier and substituted sugar with Splenda. We weren't sure what to expect but everyone loved it and will definitely make it again. Good mix of taste and crunch.

What a great recipe!  I'm a health nut, so I did alter it somewhat:  canola instead of vegetable oil, Splenda replaced sugar, margarine rather than butter... I also cut out the green onions and added green, red and yellow peppers instead. I used half a head of cabbage and added a bag and a half of Rainbow Salad (this was mentioned by another reviewer).  Additionally, adding some Thai Chili paste to the mix gives it some kick!!  I'd highly recommend it if you like things spicy.

We have been making this salad for years in my family. Instead of white vinegar we use seasoned rice vinegar and instead of vegatable oil we use peanut oil. Never put dressing in the fridge. You must heat the dressing to a boil to make sure the sugar is dissolved. I always use at least 2-3packages of ramen noodles and 2 small packages slivered almonds. And to cook the crunchies I use 2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter. Always add crunchies after you have mixed the dressing in. I have used coleslaw salad instead of napa in a hurry and no one ever complains. However napa is the best.

I love this with the Rainbow Salad Mix from the produce section (3 pkgs if making the full recipe).  The Salad mix comes with shredded broccoli, califlower, carrots, and red cabbage. This makes prep easy.  Everyone at my office insists that I bring this to carry-in lunches and I don't complain---It's so easy!

A big hit with all my guests.  I, also, cut the sugar and the oil, but I add about 1 tsp.  sesame oil.  Adds tons of flavor.  Have used Napa and bagged slaw mix.  I use rice wine vinegar, plain, not seasoned.  Adding grilled chicken chunks makes this a complete meal and is good leftover.

Great Recipe!  I followed the suggestion to toast the noodles and sesame seeds without the butter, and it was just as tasty.  I also made the dressing with 1/4 cup oil, 3 tablepoons of cider vinegar, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  It was the perfect combination of ingredients, not too sweet, not too salty.  I used the prepackaged coleslaw, and I don't even like coleslaw or raw veggies.  Definitely a keeper!

Delicious side dish for cook out season!  I used half the butter for browning the noodle mix and a tad less oil and sugar in the dressing. Dressing the salad just before serving kept the noodles nice and crunchy.  I had to make copies of the recipe before anyone would go home.

This salad is wonderful. I only used 1/2 cup of oil and used 2 heads of napa cabbage. I do not like the core of cabage much. I also replaced the almonds with chopped peanuts and found instead of adding sesame seeds(burn easy) to add a few drops of sesame oil to the dressing and to the ramen/peanut mix while cooking. and I think you MUST use Rice Vinegar to get that REAL asian flavor.

This salad is restaurant quality.  I added chicken to the salad, as another member suggested, and my husband and I had it as a main course.  Terrific salad!

Great recipe ! Brought it to the office and it was well received. Only thing I would do is make sure to not add the dressing mixture until right before you serve it so the noodles do not get too soggy.

My husband and I loved it!  I made up the whole recipe for the dressing, but since it was just the two of us, I halved the salad ingredients and used half the dressing.  Then we had it again two days later.  The second time we had it I used raw cashews.  It was great that way too. I even used some of the dressing on a frozen oriental rice, veggie and bean mixture and liked it.

One word - sensational - is right as per the description of this salad. Who knew nappa cabbage could taste so fantastic raw??!! All the ingredients are so Chinese-y but the Chinese are not known for salads...wow! Thanks Juanita! The only thing I can add is the ramen can be more or less depending on how big your head of nappa cabbage is. Mine was just medium, about 1.5 lbs and so I only used one packet of ramen. I used half the seasoning in the browning of the ramen and almonds and the other half, I boiled with the dressing. I also followed other reviewers and tossed only at time of serving. This way, the cabbage and toppings remain crunchy.  This recipe is a definite keeper! A friend at a potluck said he could eat this everyday for the rest of his life. That's a great compliment for you Juanita, enjoy!

I brought this to a ladies bible study, and it went so well, a few went online and retrieved the recipe for themselves!  One has even made it since then!  I will make this for my husband, but will add grilled chicken this time.

Very different, unusual salad that will take people by surprise. If you make enough to serve over and over again, I recommend keeping both the liquid sauce and the crispy noodles-n-stuff separate until ready to serve; I took this one camping and the cabbage was soggy by that evening. An excellent, easy, affordable recipe that I would serve again and again. Caution: had bad luck doubling the recipe, the oil separated so badly that it wasn't so great.

I used 2 bags of shredded cabbage PLUS two heads of cabbage, shredded, with the original amount of dressing.  Good thing I did or the veggies would be swimming in oil.  I would suggest using less oil...........seemed way too much on the cabbage.  Definately toast the sesame seeds separate so they don't get burnt!  I would have liked a more tangier dressing than this sweet-oily concoction.  I did add 1 pkt of ramen seasoning and that helped a little.

I love this recipe!  I made some modifications, though.  I cut the butter to 2 tablespoons.  I didn't have enough oil, so I added about a tablespoon of sesame seed oil.  I also put the ramen noodle seasoning packet in the dressing mix.  Delicious!

When I get the salad from the restaurant, all the ingredients are separate. That way you can make up individual salads as you need them. I also would suggest more sesame seeds.

I used what was in the house and significantly reduced the oil.  It was so yummy.  Coconut sugar (low glycemic) not white sugar, butter flavored coconut oil not butter, bean thread noodles from Costco not ramen for gluten free (had to boil the noodles because you can't crush them).  I did not add the vegetable oil for dressing just reused the buttery oil from earlier step and cooked with white vinegar and other ingredients.  Then tossed in boiled bean thread noodles.  A tsp of sesame oil is a good idea and would try that.  There is no need for the vegetable oil.

I also toasted the ramen, almonds (sliced) and sesame seeds in oven at 300 degrees for 15min. I also didn't heat the sauce, just mixed and poured.  Used shredded cabbage, and only 2 green onions.  Also added chicken for a full meal.

Everyone loved this! I followed some other reviews and reduced the amount of oil to 1/2 cup. I also couldn’t find the green onion so used a small red onion instead.  I used cashews in place of the almonds and it tasted great.

Great salad!  This dressing does have fat, but depending on what type of diet you follow, some healthy fat is actually beneficial and lets this salad turn into a meal instead of a side.  My family of 5 polished off a whole batch in one dinner and was looking for more.  My tips: It tastes fine as written, but flavor is mild, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  If you want some extra flavor, I suggest buying the Asian/Oriental ramen noodles and adding one of the flavoring packets to the dressing.  For added crunch, we also add 1 can of water chestnuts, diced.  Please note, regular cabbage and Napa cabbage are not the same - Napa is more tender and easier to digest, in my opinion - so just be aware of the difference when you're shopping for ingredients.

This is the best Asian salad I have tasted. Plus it was healthier than the others I have made in the past.

I make this recipe all the time, it's a huge hit at parties. I make it ahead of time, then add the almonds and ramen mix right before serving so they stay crunchy longer.

Super easy and flexible..... I halved recipe as only 2 of us.... loved it..... had this with friends before, their teenage daughter made it, then sent me this link..... her mom calls it “Asian crack slaw” cause she can’t stop eating it when it’s offered! Definitely will make again for any gatherings or potlucks!

I really liked this version of an oriental salad, however my mom and I use (crappy and embarrassing, but I’m admitting it here) about 1/2 of the flavor package in the dressing. The added flavor package included in the Ramen Noodles pack is loaded with extra salt and MSG, but my goodness it REALLY makes the salad taste excellent.

I substituted Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage. I discarded the outermost leaves, quartered them, blanched the innermost cores so they'd be softer, and just included the rest of the leaves raw. Was delicious, and stayed more crisp than when I've made similar salads with cabbage. I will use less butter to brown the noodles/almonds/sesame seeds next time, as they ended up a bit greasy for my taste.

For a dish made out of Ramen noodles, this was surprisingly banging. I used cabbage/carrot mix from a bag and otherwise followed exactly. It was finished quickly. Will certainly make again.

Had some Napa cabbage in my CSA share this week and this was an easy, tasty way to use it.  I followed others' suggestions (baked the seeds/noodles/almonds; reduced the oil and sugar; added the spice packets from the ramen).  I would try it again with a little less oil still, but it was still great.

I've made this salad many times and my guests always love it. When I can't find Napa cabbage I've used savoy.  I also had to use olive oil once. It was fine but the dressing was a little heavier.  I like sesame oil.

My family loves this. Coleslaw mix would have been much quicker but I shredded, regular cabbage, red cabbage, kale, carrots, red and yellow peppers along with green onions. I need a huge amount for a family reunion so I went to great care to make it colorful. I'm taking it package separately so it won't become soggy.  A friend at church always brings this to potlucks and you are lucky to get a bite of it before it's gone so I knew I needed the recipe. My husband insisted we needed to test it out before the big event and he ruled it 'Delicious'!

I needed a salad for a potluck and picked this one for something different.  It went over very well, definitely better than I had originally expected.  Only reason this is a four star instead of five is that what little was leftover went from good to blah in a matter of hours.                          My notes to self for next time -                          1.  use a really large pan for browning things up next time to Brown more evenly.                            2.  Maybe a touch more soy sauce and vinegar next time for just a bit more pop

This salad is so delicious!  Too much butter for me though, the next time that I make this I am going to try without the butter and maybe cut back on the oil 
and try some sesame oil.  Thanks for sharing!

Thanks for sharing this recipe!  I was looking for something other than "traditional coleslaw" for a picnic.

I followed your recipe almost to the "T" ... except I used cider vinegar, threw in those seasoning packages, added a little fresh ground ginger, and whisked in a glob (a good 1/2 cup +/-) of creamy peanut butter to the dressing while it was hot.  Everything chilled overnight.

I took it to a picnic and tossed in the dressing and crunchies there, so it would not become soggy.  Absolutely NOTHING came home - (which is the best compliment I can think of)!

I'll definitely be making this salad again!

This was delicious!  I did halve all the ingredients, except for the vinegar (I used rice vinegar) and  oil (I used sesame) of which I only used 1/4 cup plus 1 Tbsp.  I also used the cooking spray + 1 tsp. sesame oil to toast the ramen and almonds as   someone else had done.  Put the sesame seeds in when the rest was almost toasted, and added the ramen seasoning packet.  I also used the packaged slaw and added some red onion.  I kept the crunchies separate from the dressed slaw until ready to serve.  My family LOVED it!

Took out half of the oil and added rice vinegar to the dressing.  I also used standard cabbage and included a couple stalks of celery to add to the crunch.  Did not use the butter but browned the noodles and seeds in olive oil.  Delish!

I liked this salad with 4 adjustments.  First, I did not use sesame seeds because I do not like them. Second, I used rice vinegar, because I did not have white. Third, it was way way too much oil when I tasted the dressing after it was made, so I added 1/4 c. rice vinegar to it.  4th, I used chow mein noodles noodles because it is what I had.

LOVED this. My mistake was making ahead which made the noodles soft, not crunchy, was still good. Next time if I make ahead I'll just prepare everything separate and mix together when ready to eat.
I don't use vegetable oil so used a previous posters suggestion to substitute 1/4 c olive oil and about a TBS of sesame oil.
Also, the recipe is huge, halving it would work well. I just used half the cabbage this type as I didn't have a big enough bowl.
I also used the flavor packets from the ramen because they were there and I thought the salad needed some seasoning.

I took some hints from previous reviews and used seasoned rice vinegar, packaged cabbage slaw/salad, less oil (1/2 cup canola oil) and about half the seasoning packet from the oriental ramen. It tasted great, a lot like the Oriental chicken salad I used to order a lot at Applebee's. I will be making this all summer!

quarter cups work fine for butter, oil and sugar. Tasty stuff once you reduce these!

Would have been five starts, but way too much fat. I wish I had read the other reviews first and toasted the crunchy stuff without butter and cut way back on the oil. As it was, I only added about half of the sauce, because all of it would have been way too much. I'll definitely try this again, though, with less fat, because it was delicious.

Very tasty. I used 1/2 c oil and seasoned rice vinegar in my dressing, as well as the ramen noodle seasoning that others suggested. I also used thinly sliced red onion instead of greed and added some thinly sliced red pepper for color. Good stuff!

My entire family (3 kids and husband)devoured the salad!  I made the dressing and toasted the noodles and almonds the day before - so the next day, when I intended to serve it - I tossed it together just before dinner!  It's out of this world!

We really liked this salad.  The flavor was very fresh and I liked not having to use the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles.  However, I thought the recipe called for too much butter to toast the nuts and noodles.  They were a bit too oily.  Next time I will try using half the amount of butter.  Otherwise, this is the recipe I will use when I make this type of salad. Thanks!

I made this last week and substituted lettuce for cabbage because I don't care for it. It was good but I thought it lacked a little something. I might try again with some small adjustments.

This is SO good!  However, I've found a much easier version that essentially satisfies the same craving:  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Broccoli-and-Ramen-Noodle-Salad/Detail.aspx (substitute sliced almonds for the peanuts and regular cole slaw for the broccoli coleslaw).  But this recipe is amazing too!

Pretty good.  I served it with my mom visiting.  She said she has something almost like this, but it uses the packet of ramen noodle seasoning in the mix.  Next time I'd try that as it seemed a bit bland.

I made a few changes to this recipe (all noted in other reviews). I added bite-size chicken chunks, used Splenda instead of sugar, topped with mandarin oranges and used white wine vinegar.  My husband said it was good but my 2 young boys only picked off the oranges.  I thought it was great.  I'll save this recipe for my next pot-luck dinner.

I found the dressing really oily tasting, and wished I'd used olive oil instead of veg. Other than that, this was pretty good. I've made the Asian Chicken Noodle Salad recipe from this site a couple of times - and liked that a lot - but I much preferred the slivered almonds/sesame seeds in this recipe to the pine nuts and sunflower seeds in the the ACNS. Thanks, Juanita!

This is a very good, very filling salad.  I can't find napa cabbage (I know it can be sold under different names and I couldn't find those either), so I use baby spinach leaves. I also take the advise of the other reviewers and add the dressing to taste.

This makes the most delicious salad! It's also versatile. I've had it with regular lettuce, craisins and strawberries. I've also had it with regular cabbage. It's delicious no matter what base you use. The reason is because the dressing and the crunchy topping are both so good. I used only 1/3 cup of sugar and it was still very sweet. Overall, a fabulous salad that everyone always raves about!

Love this recipe! I substituted white wine vinegar in place of the distilled white vinegar. I think it added flavor. Also, I think next time I'll use a few more ramen noodles (since they seem to be everyones favorite part of the dish) and less oil - much less oil.

Awesome recipe. Had an Asian themed dinner party to go to and this is the dish I took.  I ended up taking home an empty dish. Thats always a good sign. Attending the party was a professional chef who raved about it and gave it the thumbs up sign.I did alter the recipe a little. I used 2 bags of broccoli slaw instead of Napa, cut the butter to 1/4 of a cup, used seasoned rice vinegar, also to help cut calories used splenda in place of sugar. I added 1 tsp of sesame seed oil to the dressing after it had cooled. Hats off to the "Food Engineer" of this recipe.

This is a great recipe,  I use sushi vinegar just to simplify the process as it already has the sugar added in.  To make this salad a fresh light and wholesome meal,  I make this salad the day after I roast chickens with cold shredded chicken.  Delicious!

this is very similar to the recipe i use except that i only use one package of ramen noodles, and i buy the oriental kind and add the flavor packet to the sauce mix with an additonal Tbsp soy sauce.  i also use 3/4 C sunflower seeds instead of the sesame seeds.  i love this salad!

This was a fun recipe. I made it for a church potluck. I never thought about using uncooked ramen noodles for crunch- but it really works! I love sesame flavor, so I think I will use sesame oil next time instead of vegetable oil.

Great salad!  I used cider vinegar instead of distilled vinegar, cut down on the butter, and substituted Splenda instead of sugar.  The only other thing that I would change would be to cut down on the green onions by at least half.  This recipe is definately a keeper!

FABULOUS!! I always use less oil and a little more vinegar (try different amounts to suit your taste!). I toasted the almonds, sesamee seeds and raman noodles 300*(no oil) BE CAREFUL they burn fast..  and I added atleast 1 chicken breast chopped up with seasoning. This was so GOOD.. I have made this 3 times in the past 2 months and will keep making.. thanks for a great salad!

This needed changes.  I would cut down on the oil, maybe by half.  I also had to increase the amount of soy sauce.  I added seasoned rice vinegar as well, I'm sure that just adding more vinegar and sugar would have the same effect.  You probably only need about 1/2 the butter as well.  I prefer it crunchy, so I would add the crunchy stuff right before eating it.  Tasted great after the changes.

Yum! Served this with Oven Kalua Pork. Excellent accompaniment. Dressing is just right.

This was okay, but I have had better salads of this sort.  If you wish to get an easy precut cabbage bag, I’d suggest using two bags and not quite all of the dressing.

This is one of my favorite summer salads--always get raves when I bring it to picnics.  Also great as a light summer supper with the addition of cooked shrimp or chicken!

Wow, Wow, Wow!  Sounds crazy... tastes divine!   I also reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, and the sugar to 1/3 cup and that was perfect for me... lightly sweet, plenty moist without excess oil.  Whoever thought of this recipe is a creative genius!

Excellent! I made this for a Memorial Day cookout, and it was the biggest hit of the party! Almost everyone went back for seconds!

A few suggestions: I used seasoned rice vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar, I doubled the sugar - it may sound too sweet, but it turned out great! Also, make sure to toss the salad and dressing at the last possible moment before serving so that the ramen noodles don't get soggy!

I will definitely be making this again!!!

this was great! I added one extra package of ramen noodles. We had as a main dish, I added broiled chicken to my husbands salad to make it a more substantial meal. Will make this as a side next time for a get together, cookout etc! Thanks so much.

My family really loves this salad--if napas are smallish, I'd suggest using 2.  Delicious, and very unusual.  I give it A+.

Excellent flavor.  I used less than half of the oil that the recipe called for and it was great.  Next time I would put just a little less sugar in.  The flavors were so good that I just couldn't stop eating it!

Loved the recipe and it was a hit at our dinner party.  I cut the oil in half and thought there was still plenty.  Next time I will use about 1/2 the butter too.  It tasted great, but would be nice to reduce the calories.  Otherwise very good and I will keep it on my list!

Added the chicken and it was awesome.  My husband has NEVER taken thirds on anything I've cooked before (after 10 yrs).  It is now added to our regular meal list.  Thanks!

Very good salad.  I sauteed some chicken breasts in sesame oil to toss in with the cabbage to make it a meal.  I also didn't add the ramen noodles or sesame seeds (I didn't have any).  I also used the packaged cole slaw mix to make it even easier to make.  I added a couple of splashes of sesame oil to the salad to give it some extra flavor.  The only thing I would change next time would be to cut way back on the amount of oil, it was too much and just sat in the bottom of the bowl.  Otherwise, delicious!

I left out the green onions and almonds b/c I did not have any...but the dressing and ramen really make the salad!  It was delicious.  I will make it again using all ingredients, plus I would add some shredded carrots to the mix for some color.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!!

It was a different kind of cole slaw and was a nice change.  I kept the crunchies separate and let people sprinkle it on top of the salad so that leftovers would be cruchy too.

hmmmm yummy! I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I think next time I will use just a little less sauce and maybe pick up a bag of the pre-shredded cabbage to save time. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have made this salad several times and have found that adding the sesame seeds and almonds to the noodle,onion, and butter mixture last prevents them from getting too brown.

This was pretty good but a little too sweet in my opinion, also, there were too many ramen noodles and too many almonds - next time I'll only use 1 pkg of the noodles and 1/2 cup of almonds and 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds
