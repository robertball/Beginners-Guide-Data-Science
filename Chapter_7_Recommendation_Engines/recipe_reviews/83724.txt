I am not a bake bean lover, Baked Beans are one of my husband's favoite foods. So I decided to try this recipe. It is great. To cut back on the calories, I used Splenda's Brown Sugar Blend. I used half of the sugar that the recipe called for. They turned out great. I'll be eating more baked beans. the apples added a wonderful flavor to them.

I bought a jumbo size can of pork and beans instead of two smaller ones, and followed the rest of the recipe, except I ran out of ketchup so I used half ketchup half bbq sauce.  Brought these to a family gathering and everyone raved about these beans, I would definitely make them again.

This was good as a side for our Superbowl food. I cut back on the sugar to 1/2 a cup, and only used 1/2 an onion. Thanks for the post! I really liked the addition of apple to this. It added an interesting flavor.

This recipe was really good.  The only change I made was to break up the bacon to fry and put the brown sugar on top of it in the frying pan.  As soon as all of the sugar melted I mixed it in. (got this idea from another allrecipe) Big hit at the picnic I brought it to. Thanks for the recipe!!

We loved these beans! I did cut the sugar to 1/2 cup as well as crumbling the bacon into the beans. Perfect!

WOW!!!! These are great!  My husband loved them so that makes me happy.  Next time I will only use 2tbls. brown sugar.  They were just a little too sweet.  I paired them with the 'Cowboy Chicken' recipe from this site and it was a great meal.  This is one you can WOW your guests with!

These came out good, but a little bit tangier than I prefer my baked beans. Next time I'll use less apple. I used onion soup mix instead of fresh onions and added a little bit of garlic powder. When these came out of the oven, I removed the bacon and stirred the beans, as there was a good amount of fat sitting on top. Maybe I didn't pre-cook the bacon long enough to remove enough of the fat? I'll try these again, but probably cook the bacon completely and crumble into the mix.

Now, I did use Bush's Country Style baked beans, which already have brown sugar in them.  Sorry, but these were waaaayyy to sweet for me...and I used only 2 T. brown sugar.  I like sweet, but not this sweet.   Maybe next time I would try Original...

I was worried about using the apple but it gave it a nice texture.  I did not add the brown sugar because I used Bush's beans w/brown sugar.

O.k.  So this wasn't the greatest dish in the world but it was edible.  Personal preference, if made again, I would omit the mustard, ketchup and apple.  Definitely if using canned beans with sugar or honey, I would also omit the sugar.  I too crumbled the bacon up after frying fully on the stove top.  I also placed five whole strips within and cooked in oven for 35 minutes.  Actually, I would try sautéing the onions on stove top so this way I can add the bacon and onions to the beans and heat up on stovetop, eliminating the time to cook in the oven.

This recipe is wonderful!  I prepared it for a Memorial Day cookout and friends have been asking me for the recipe ever since.  The apples add a special zest to it that makes it really different.

Adding a diced sour apple is probably the best thing to ever happen to baked beans!  This was a little too sweet for me - I would recommend 1/4-1/2 c brown sugar.

This is the way I've always made baked beans but instead of apple, I add 1 can (drained) pineapple tidbits, finely chopped onion, and green pepper.  If you like more of a sweet and sour taste try adding a little yellow mustard.  About 1/2 teaspoon.  You'll especially love the pineapple tidbits.

Been making this recipe for years, but, here's my note... it's best when I use the cheapest canned Pork & Beans, instead of canned baked beans. Try it!

I really liked this recipe.  I had the apples in it but after tasting it I took them out. (yes a tideous job)  I am nto a fan of the way the apples felt in my mouth.  I also used only a half of cup of brown sugar.  I will use this recipre (with my changes) again.

This recipe is close to mine, but I only use half a cup of Brown Sugar, 1 Tbs. Mustard, Lipton Onion Soup.  I also add 2 TBS. of Karo syrup for added thickness, then add 2 strips of Bacon.  This recipe is good, but I still prefer mine.

I found almost the exact recipe in The Betty Crocker cookbook in the 60's. Only thing it didn't call for ketchup but Lea & Perrins instead. We're been making this all my married life and my kids and everyone who eats it likes it. It's better to saute the onions in the bacon fat. Gives it a better flavor. The apple must have been your idea. Good recipe.

Okay, so my husband and I don't normally like baked beans but this recipe appealed to me because it was different. Easy to pull together. Really easy. My five year old son helped. I found it to be really sweet but my husband tells me that baked beans are supposed to be sweet. I liked them, but if I were to make this dish again, I might use less sugar. Still, it got the whole family to eat baked beans which is always a draw.

I know it's kind of unhealthy, but I mixed the bacon grease in with the beans to give them a more 'smoked' flavor. Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter and mine turned out GREAT. Everyone raved!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I scaled back on the brown sugar (I used Splenda Brown Sugar) and it was still fabulous.  The flavor from the bacon and apples was great! 2 thumbs up!!!!!

I personally thought this was excellent. however my family found it was too sweet and I cut the brown sugar in half. I really think next time I will use pork and beans and not Bushs’ Vegetarian Beans and I think that will solve the too sweet problem.

This is a great basic recipe for baked beans, with the apples an added surprise.  Very good.  I have often added sliced stuffed green olives as an extra.  Also delicious.

My hubby didn't care for the recipe at all, but I thought it was interesting enough to eat it.  But, I don't think our taste buds would want us to make it again!

The apple truly makes a difference.  I used Bush's Original baked beans so I didn't add any brown sugar but next time, I will add a little.  Also, I think sauting the onion would better infuse the bacon taste throughout the beans.  A great, simple, yet tasty recipe!

Did not add all of the sugar and glad I didn't.  Added about 2/3 of the sugar.  Used vegetarian beans with lower sodium as the base.  Used 2 green apples and chopped up the bacon and sprinkled on top before baking.

My family loved this! The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. I got Busch’s original recipe which has brown sugar so I put half the brown sugar it called for in there. It was very sweet and everyone who loves baked beans loved it! I’m keeping in my stash for our next get together. :)

The Granny Smith apple make an incredible flavor change and i think makes these beans a big hit with my family.

This was a very tasty recipe although it was a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will reduce the amount of brown sugar.

6.16.18  We’re just not into overly sweet these days, I knew the amount of sugar would be too much for us, so I did modify the recipe by cutting the amount of sugar in half, and used Truvia® Brown Sugar Blend. Not sure why I never thought about pre-cooking the bacon, but I did for 30 seconds on high in the microwave.  Wow, what a difference that made, really reduced that puddle of fat you usually end up with when baking beans.  The apple does give the beans a little different texture and was an interesting flavor, but subtle.  We like our beans kind of soupy and cold, so I cooked only for 30 minutes, cooled them, and into the fridge.  These were good, we enjoyed them.

Great recipe.  Changed a little based on preference.  Used half the onions, half the apple and half the brown sugar.  Turned out perfect!

The best recipe I’ve ever used to make canned beans special!  Mixed and baked all in a cast iron skillet. Just crumbled the bacon and mixed in. Gave it even more flavor. My guests raved. The beans just disappeared like magic. Wish I’d made double.

I've created several doctored baked bean recipes and I have to say this was the best.  It had the perfect measurements that balanced everything.  I didn't do the Apple because I didn't have one, but I still received rave reviews.  Thank you!

This was very good. Everyone loved it. A nice change from the plain old bean. I fried the bacon first and then chopped it and added it to the rest.

I did as some others suggested and cut down a little on the sugar. I was disappointed that I couldn't really taste the apple. My boyfriend said, "There is just nothing to them." I felt they tasted too much like beans I could buy canned. I will still look for another baked bean recipe.

This is now a favorite that we make every Sunday.  I do use the creamy dijon mustard and Splenda brown sugar blend.  I feel like I am eating dessert with my meal !!

The beans are very sweet and sugary so be careful what you add as a main dish. I made the mistake of making meatloaf which also had a lot of brown sugar and bbq sauce. Other than that the beans were great. I didn't have enough pans to make it in so I did it on the stove and it was still really, really good.
