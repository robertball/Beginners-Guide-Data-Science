Delicious!  This is the first time I've tried cooking with catfish and it turned out wonderful.  I think the number of servings should be changed to 2-3, though.

Very easy and extremely tasty.  We LOVED sauce! It is nice to have a sauce that is low fat and that you can eat without guilt.  We were putting the sauce on our steamed vegies and our baked potatoes.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce and used cajun seasoning instead of making the one listed.

I made the mistake of trying this with flounder instead of catfish and it didn't turn out as well.  Will definitely make it again though, with thick catfish fillets, and will increase the amount of spices for the rub (we like it spicy in Texas!).  The sauce is a great.  Won't change a thing there.

I especially liked the saucy that goes with the fish. It is also good baked with tomatoes and cheese on top.

This is a keeper - both my son and husband loved this. It's easy - even though there are a lot of ingredients! Thanks.

This is one of my husband's favorites.  The spices compliment the catfish and he loved the tasty sauce.  He likes spicy food, and this had the right "punch".  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We liked this.  I added garlic powder and seasoned salt to the rub and after grilling, I drizzled them with melted butter.  Of course that added fat, but sure was good!

It needs more flavor but otherwise it was good. Next time I am going to add some garlic salt, red pepper flakes and some butter/margarine into the foil packets with the fish. I think this would create more juice that would soak into the fish and give it more flavor.
