Was o.k, but I did not have zucchini- but I did use fresh mushrooms. I tasted it BEFORE I added the diced tomatoes and it was fine, but when I added the tomatoes it was not. so next time I will not add the canned tomatoes.

A very pleasing weeknight supper.  I used Penne because I had it on hand and also spicy Rotel tomatoes.   I added Parmesan at the end, and I think that really improved the taste.

Just a point about the comment on not adding tomatoes...drain them first and get rid of the overtly tomato flavor/acid...that is true for just about all pasta dishes if you do not use fresh tomatoes.  I also agree that fresh mushrooms add a subtle zesty quality.

This was really good; however, I did have a problem cooking through at the end so next time I will simply cook the pasta while I am cooking the meat. Doesn't really satisfy the "one-dish" description, but better than waiting for the noodles to cook with a "starving" 9-year old nagging for dinner! :-) The only change I made was to replace the zucchini with 8 oz. fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms.

Although the flavor was good, the title was deceiving in that it LACKED mushrooms, themselves. I added a pkg. of fresh mushrooms and replaced the water with beef broth. Also did not have the noodles called for, so I used egg noodles. Really good second day. Will serve again, but rated it low due to its lack of veggies.

This was good, I didn't have tomoates on hand, but used a large zucchini.  Next time might add some fresh mushrooms as they are my favorite.

For a quick dinner this is a good recipe.  It was flavorful and easily adaptable to put whatever you like in it.

Used regular mushroom soup because that's all I had. Same with using a can of stewed tomatoes. When it was done I covered the handle of my pan, topped with shredded cheddar and stuck it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Excellent!!
