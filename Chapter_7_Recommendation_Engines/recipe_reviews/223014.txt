Best Passover muffin ever! I reduced the recipe to a dozen and the family ate them all the same day!

Very good, but unless you are Sephardic, most vegetable oil (e.g. canola oil) is not kosher for passover.  I used applesauce instead of the oil and reduced the sugar a bit, and they were really yummy.

Very tasty and moist, at least warm from the oven. I substituted olive oil and used half brown sugar. Added chopped apples but I bet it would be good to add some leftover haroset.
