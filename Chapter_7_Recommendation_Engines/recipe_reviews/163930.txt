Very light but very nice.  Asparagus was tender, but not "cooked".  The dressing is great.  Will probably use on a cucumber and tomato salad tomorrow.  I put diced red pepper in with the asparagus as it seemed to need more colour.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I'll bet there is more that can be done with this starting as a base but it's really nice as it is!

This is a nice change-up on the asparagus I usually make.  I will say I think that for 1 and 1/2 pounds of asparagus, the recipe as written makes a whole lot of dressing.  I also think it calls for too much oil.  I do prefer my dressings with a little more vinegar than oil in the ratio but two tablespoons of peanut oil and one tablespoon of sesame oil is too much.  Cut both of those in half.  But I like it - I love asparagus and am always looking for ways to cook it.

I give 5 stars b/c of my DH's delight - he said it was AWESOME! I didn't have peanut oil, but used all other ingredients as written. Instead of making a cold "salad," I used the dressing as a sauce poured over warm, cooked asparagus. It was really good. A nice way to cook asparagus.

Made this again today. Due to a soy issue, I used Worcestershire in its place. It's still good. I've also used fish sauce which freaks some people out unless they aren't told before they eat it.

This is probably my favorite asparagus dish ever, and I'm something of an asparagus aficionado. It's a perfect side dish for any southeast Asian-style dinner: delicious, quick, and easy. If you leave the spears intact (while trimming off the woody parts of course), it makes for an elegant presentation as well.  I've served this several times with the Pork, Apple, and Ginger Stir-fry from this site.

Have made this several times.  Always gets rave reviews.  Only change I made is that I roast the asparagus (400 for about 12-15 min) with a little olive oil and sea salt.  I then reduce the peanut oil to 1 TBSP.

Very good, and simple for hot summer days when you don't want to eat something hot and don't want to work too hard!  You can easily substitute green beans for the asparagus.

The dressing in this recipe is wonderfull and lite, it dosen't over power the taste of the veggies.  I made this with carrots and brocolie that I blanched, and sweet yellow peppers.  It was wonderfull!

I made this exactly as written for a bbq I was throwing. I chose it because of all the great reviews. I was very disappointed. Luckily I made this early in the day so I had time to run out and buy more asparagus because I threw the batch made with this recipe out. 3 minutes is WAY too long to boil the asparagus. I boiled for 3 minutes then added to an ice bath and the asparagus was very very soggy. I knew at that point I had to remake it but I figured I would try out the dressing on my 1st batch before throwing out just to to test out the dressing. Awful. The dressing was very bland and tasted like plain oil. For my 2nd attempt I added the asparagus to the boiling water and cooked for 1 minute then added to an ice bath. I still think this was a tad too long but much better. I tossed out the dressing from this recipe as well and ended up just using some bottled balsamic dressing. I suggest boiling just 1 or 2 asparagus spears to find out the cooking time that suits your taste before cooking the whole bunch.

Great dressing; neither too tangy nor too sweet (I dislike both those attributes).  Vibrant green color if you don’t overcook it.  Lovely salad, one I think I’d also like with another vegetable – possibly green beans or zucchini.

I know it's not spring and asparagus is not at its peak in December, but the 99 cent store had a lot of it so I bought 2 large bunches.  That said, I was very careful not to over cook the asparagus, as other reviewers seemed to have problems with the timing.  I left off the peanut oil to save a few fat grams and we liked the dressing just fine without it.  This was a nice fresh-tasting salad and it was refreshing to eat fresh asparagus in December.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!  The only thing I did differently was to sub agave nectar for sugar and I used all sesame oil (some guests had peanut allergies).  Great side dish!

YUM!! Didn't change a thing-- Just subbed all sesame oil since I didn't have peanut oil. Kept a close watch on the asparagus and their perfect crunch and the amazing blend of flavors have me already looking forward to the leftovers I'm going to have for lunch tomorrow!!

Over all not a bad recipe at all... definately a different take on asparagus... I didn't have all the exact ingredients so I had to make some substitutes that could have been why I didn't find anything special about this recipe but it still tasted good... gotta love aparagus

The most important thing is cooking the asparagus.  One minute makes a huge difference between mush and crisp.  Go for 3 minutes, maximum.  The dressing is excellent.  I toasted white sesame seeds and used half the amount.

Easy & delicious. Didn't have rice vinegar, so used balsamic. Also, I added shredded carrots & toasted the sesame seeds.

Reall refreshing with a delicious dressing!  Wanted to drink it but thought better of it :).  It's sweet, sour and perfect.  Used low sodium soy sauce and add salt as needed.  Liked this cold rather than luke warm, but still made this following the recipe to a T and not sure why it takes 25 minutes until it's ready; start to finish this was done in 15 minutes.   This cooks quickly, ice water is key to stopping the cooking in its tracks. This is perfect for a bbq, had it on the side with burgers.

Excellent!  Big hit at our family picnic.  It did need salt, perhaps because I use reduced-sodium soy sauce.  Also, I toasted the sesame seeds.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will use often.

This recipe is incredible.  The dressing is just the right vinaigrette, and does not over power the asparagus. I did substitute the peanut oil for canola oil, due to peanut allergy, and it was still yummy.

I took this to a summer bbq and it was a perfectly unique side dish.  I let the asparagus cook for 5 min, which was longer than I intended and it was a little too long (my bad - the phone rang).

Excellent recipe. The trick is to not over cook the asparagus-3 minutes was plenty. I also added some diced red Thai peppers for color and flavor.

Simply yummy! I cut the peanut oil by about a third, and only boiled my asparagus for 1 minute because a like them barely cooked. I love the light simplicity of this dressing - but I can also dig the fish sauce idea and will try it next time. Thanks!

Delightful, interesting flavor.  Served it on Easter with ham. Well received.  I cooked the asparagus too long but still good. I think that under-cooked is better than over-cooked. I had too many things going on in the kitchen while I cooked the aspargus.

Tasty, fast and easy. Loved it. Also tickled to know it's comes from an intergallactic hitchhiker.

I love this salad.  I added crisp bacon bits and chopped red onion.

This asparagus salad was a hit for our Easter picnic. Ive made it again at my daughter’s request. I skipped using peanut oil and just used sesame, didn’t miss the extra oil at all.  A great way to enjoy spring asparagus.

Didn't have peanut oil so substituted olive oil. Blanched asparagus, fresh green beans, and orange and red bell pepper chunks. Everything else was the same (used Splenda for the sugar). This is a low-carb, sweet and tangy way to get fresh veggies! Thanks for posting.

Excellent recipe. We substituted olive oil for peanut oil (to avoid allergy issues) and it was just wonderful. We left the spears whole, which made for such a pretty presentation with Easter dinner.

I was surprised at how much flavor the asparagus did not hold.  I normally cook my asparagus in a vinegar sauce and add a bit of sugar, so this was a little more bland than what my family is used to being served, however, I really enjoyed the combination of flavors in the dressing.  Not sure I would have ever thought to mix 2 different vinegars.

I'm not a big asparagus fan and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used sweet rice wine and red cooking wine in place of the vinegars. Due to allergies, I cut the peanut oil entirely.  Next time I'll probably cut down the sesame oil by half too as it was a little strong without the peanut oil to balance it out.  Still tasty though!
