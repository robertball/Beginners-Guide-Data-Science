I'm so sorry, I hate to give poor reviews, but these were not good at all.  They were oily, salty and under cooked.  I did try an excellent recipe on this site called Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes submitted by Cathy Martin which was great! I'd suggest to try that one instead.

The Recipe as listed is incorrect, the amounts of salt and pepper should be in teaspoons NOT tablespoons, the recipe is not edible if you use Tablespoons.

Recipe states 35 minutes for cooking but mine had barely started
cooking at that point.  After all was said and done, it was an hour and
15 minutes before the potatoes were tender.  Flavor is good.

This recipe is awful. I did not read the reviews and have learned from my mistake. Took over two hours to cook, were watery and tasted terrible. 
Whole thing went into the trash. DO NOT try this recipe!

I can't believe I didn't look at the reviews first before trying this recipe. Well, It is way too salty. I think I cooked mine in the past at 425 for 45 minutes not 35 because the temperature was too low. I needed to cook this for 2 hours. I used less than half the salt and it was still way too salty. I should have known better than to just follow this recipe blindly especially since I've made this countless times in the past. I'm using it for a Thanksgiving dinner at work and it's ruined. Thanks a lot. You should take this recipe off of this site.

OK I also made these BEFORE reading any reviews... oops.  I agree that these are by far NOT the best au gratin i have had.  I caught the mistake of the kosher salt thing right away, so it wasnt the salt.  It was the cheese/milk sauce....  For me I think the biggest mistake here is not making a cheese rue/sauce on the stove first.  Other recipes of au gratin potatoes call for that and are much better.  More time, yes, but next time I will follow a recipe that does that.

Oh what a failure!  Much too watery and underdone!  The seasoning proportions are too much also... I saw that right away and just put what I thought was best. Had to drain dish and continue cooking to salvage the ingredients. I am new to this site and have only tried a few recipes (others were successful) and I  have learned a valuable lesson--  read the reviews BEFORE attempting a recipe.  This recipe is so bad and has to be doctored so much to be usable, it should be pulled from this site!  Sure hope I am not invited to any of Miss BonnieB's impromptu dinner parties!

I TRIED THIS RECIPE AND WAS NOT HAPPY.  AFTER ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES COOKING THE POTATOES WERE NOT COOKED AND THERE WAS FAR TOO MUCH LIQUID.
THIS WAS A VERY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE.

The measurements are incorrect in this recipe.  I believe the person posting this might have meant 5 teaspoons of salt and 3 teaspoons of pepper.  There is also too much liquid, and too little baking time.

I cannot believe I didn't read the reviews first!  My potatoes cooked for over 2 hours!!!  I was SO disappointed by this!  Flavorwise, they were ok, but I added cheese inbetween the layers which helped!

DON'T!  I eliminated most of the salt.  Turned out more of a milky/cheesy potatoe soup.  Edible ... barely.

I actually made this and looked at the other reviews after.  It wasn't awful as some described it, but it does need to cook longer. I used russets, and since I didn't have buttermilk, made my own with 2% milk + vinegar.  My family thought the flavors were good & I added some garlic salt to it also. I think it is a usable recipe, just increase the cooking time(I went 40 minutes and the potatoes that I had sliced in the food processor), were still a bit crunchy, but not unpleasantly. I'll definately make this again.

almost a winner! I didn't taste the salt at all, i would recommend doubling up on the salt and maybe a shot of hot sauce.

I'm sorry to say, this recipe is bad.  To better it, try par-boiling the potatoes slices first. This will make the bake time still 1 and 1/2 hours. Then half the buttermilk. 5 TABLESPOONS of salt is ridiculous, so is the 3 TABLESPOONS of pepper (Use your own discretion). The cheese amount is right. Though the time is a lot more than originally said, it will turn out a lot better this way.

Like so many before me have stated...I wish I would've read the reviews before making this recipe.  I sprinkled each layer with salt and pepper rather than using the 5 T and used 3 c buttermilk instead of 4 so it was not overly salty or too watery.  However, the texture was not creamy, but curdled.  It was far too sour and the cooking time exceeded one hour and 15 min, despite the fact I increased the temperature to 425 degrees after 45 minutes.  The potatoes were even sliced paper thin with a mandolin. I STRONGLY do not recommend this recipe!

Do  not try this recipe.  Curdled buttermilk, uncooked potatoes after more than 90 minutes in oven AND 20 minutes in microwave.  Terrible.

Seriously the worst I have ever made.  Too watery, Too hard, as in undercooked, too Salty, Too Peppery, and I like hot stuff. This was by far the worst excuse for potatoes I've ever experienced.  Other recipes from you guys have been great, but you should seriuosly consider removing this, because if you don't read the reviews you can't imagine what you are in for...take-out!

I caught my mistake using this recipe right after I put it in the oven, so I bumped the temperature up and planned the rest of my meal to be served later in hopes the potatoes would be done.  Over an hour at 450 degrees later, the potatoes weren't tender at all.  The sauce was a lumpy, and oily. Thankfully I never add salt to most recipes until I taste them at the end.

I make a recipe similar to this all the time, and it is one of my favorites. mabye these suggestions will help.
add a little salt and pepper, not much you can salt it to taste later
i cook my potatoes at 350 for about an hour, more or less depending. you just have to taste it and see.
i layer flour to thicken it up a bit.
I use american cheese, and a blend of co-jack and mild cheddar. i layer all types of cheese in each layer.
i dot butter in each layer also. just a few thin slivers.
it is not very visually appealing, but it is very good.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  I cut down the recipe quite a bit, to feed only five.  I also used Garlic Pepper, rather then plain pepper.  It came out watery, not creamy, like Au Gratin potatoes should be.  I also cooked it an hour at 400* hoping to crisp it up on top, it didn't work, the potatoes weren't even cooked all the way through, and they were cut 1/4 inch to 1/8 inch thick.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I made this recipe because I didnt want to bother with making a milk/cheese mixture on the stove. I used smaller amounts of salt, just estimated to taste, and it was fine. I did use the olive oil on the bottom of the pan but did not have an issue with it coming out greasy. I also used pepperjack cheese for a kick. I did not have buttermilk so I used 2 percent. I also know that potatoes take forever to bake so I cooked it 30 minutes, stirred in some flour because it was a little soupy, and cooked for another 30 minutes. It turned out ok, but not impressed. I will eat the leftovers, but I probably won't make it again.

I read the reviews after I'd already started to prepare this, and was worried. Fortunately, I didn't follow the instructions to a tee... I used cooking spray on the dish, and it was not too greasy. I thought just salt and pepper was too bland, so I added onions and just lightly sprinkled with salt, garlic powder, and parsley. I alternated cheddar and pamesan cheeses. I didn't parboil as someone suggested, but 25 minutes in a 1300 watt microwave did fine, it just needed a little more milk (even though people said it was watery... Could that be due to the low humidity where I live?). It tasted pretty good my way, but next time I'll stick with my mom's recipe.

This recipe does not word as written. There is no thickener for the sauce, and the potatoes do not cook within the cooking time indicated.

Add another one to the list of "I should have read the reviews first before making this!"  I was planning a very special dinner for my boyfriend which unfortunately included these so called Au Gratin Potatoes.  Needless to say the night turned out pretty bad because I was so embarrassed that I couldn't get these potatoes cooked.

This recipe was not to my liking. The gravy isn't creamy at all. Extremely salty even though i used only a pinch. 35 mins isn't enough cooking time for this recipe. Even though, I cut the potatoes paper thin. I mean seriously Yukon Gold potatoes aren't cheap. Talk about a waste of time and money!! It's 9pm on a Friday night,and I have to figure out what to cook. Thanks!!!

As others have said, the potatoes had barely started cooking at the end of 35 minutes....I didn't even attempt the tablespoons of salt because I knew that had to have been a mistake.

I had already started preparing this recipe when I read the reviews.  Instead of a quart of buttermilk, I used two cups (1 pint), reduced the salt and pepper (sounded like too much) and baked it for 60 minutes.  The recipe turned out perfect!

When this recipe finally got done, it was good. However, it needs a little tweeking. First, use teaspoons not tablespoons of salt and pepper. I used only three tsp of each because the cheese is salty. Next, it might be best to par-boil the potatoes first. I used a madolin and sliced the potatoes very thin, but it still took over an hour to cook. Next, raise the temp. about half way through to about 400deg. to get the mixture to bubble to help cook the potatoes. Also, I added a few slices of onion.

Recipes calls for 30-35 minutes cook time and it has now been 50 minutes and the potatoes are not even close to done. Also, too much buttermilk - it's very watery, not so much creamy.

The buttermilk curdled, the potatoes weren't CLOSE to being done, and it was WAY too much liquid as well as being super oily.  All Recipes should remove this recipe.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY, and it was a total disaster -- it was greasy and runny and the potatoes were not cooked.  I ended up cooking the dish for an additional HOUR, and it still wasn't good. I will not try it again.

I really liked these potatoes. However I made them for a party of 40 so they took forever to cook. Also they were really salty and almost bitter. I would suggest a different type of milk.

What a disappointment!  This recipe is all wrong.  The potatoes weren't cooked, the "sauce" was all watery and greasy from the chesse.   I was disappointed in myself for screwing it up, but after seeing all these other reviews I'm glad to find out that it wasn't me, it was the recipe.

I wish that I'd read the ratings & reviews on this one BEFORE I made it.  First, it's way too salty and too liquidy.  Even using kosher salt vs. regular salt, these proportions have to be way off.  The cook time is off by at least 45 minutes.  I had such high hopes and am really disappointed.

I did half-portions of everything. I used about half the proportional amount of buttermilk and added the salt and pepper to taste after baking. Came out wonderfully after about an hour 15 and needed no salt or pepper for me. Thanks for the original recipe and thanks a lot for the helpful reviews.

These were not a fan fave. I feel there was way to much liquid in this at the end of cooking. A quart of buttermilk is a bit much. I think the recipe could have done with half of that and come out well. They need to cook for much longer than stated.

The buttermilk curtled and the cheese inside didn't really melt.  It was so liquid-y that I had to recheck the recipe to make sure I didn't make a mistake.  I wish I had read the reviews but I was looking for something quick and went with it.

Cooked for over an hour and the potatoes were still not tender at 375 degrees.  I, thankfully, did not add a lot of the salt.  The buttermilk did curdle as others have stated.  I, too, am sorry that I did not read reviews first otherwise I would have tried a different recipe.  The flavor was good but the sauce did not stick to the potatoes.  Maybe they were not starchy enough for the dish.  Will not use this recipe again.

Oh my goodness, why didn't I read the reviews before trying this recipe.  I should have known better than try a new recipe before the church social.  Just like the other reviews said, it was too salty, watery and undercooked~~even after cooking it for longer than was stated.

This dish wasn't too bad, considering the salt/pepper portions were way off!! I learned to drain the potatoes more before cooking. I had potato soup instead of a nice potato casserole I was hoping for. It was alittle salty, & I only used 3tbps salt/pepper. Know I know to change the portion to tsp. But everyone ate them anyway.

We made this and noticed that they turned out way salty. We are wondering if the 5 tablespoons of kosher salt should actually be 5 teaspoons. It turned out too salty to eat.

should have read the reviews before I made this.. After 1 1/2 of cooking it was still not done and I sliced the potatos paper thin, the cheese was burned, the buttermilk was clumpy and the whole dish was watery..

I microwaved the potatoes first before putting in the dish with the cheese. I only put a light sprinkling of salt and pepper as the amounts stated seemed ridiculous! It came out very liquidy, however the flavor was good. I think that if I had added all that salt it would have been awful.

Not only did it take forever to cook, even after an hour and 15 minutes it was too liquidy.  Also, my family could not stand the overpowering salt and pepper.  Is that supposed to be teaspoons instead of tablespoons?  It was incredibly disappointing!
