I loved the flavour of soy, cumin, cilantro and vinegar in this dish. I did some modifications based on my preferences ( I never saute plain chicken...it must always be marinated or seasoned because I find it too bland otherwise). The base and combination of flavours and ingredients were new to me and that is why I am giving this a 5. AND it's pretty healthy!!So, I sauteed the chicken first (seasoned and marinated for a 4 hours with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, soy sauce and the vinegar) then I took it out, and sauteed the onions, garlic, peppers and rest of the sauce and seasoning with the green beans until they softened...about 8-10 minutes adding the tomatoes, chicken and cilantro towards the end to heat through. Sorry to modify as the first reviewer but I really wanted to review and tell you I never would have thought to throw these things together so this recipe deserves 5 stars and for people to give it a try! Thanks!!

Really good! Will make again. Also the amount of vinegar (THREE tablespoons) was completely subtle and perfectly blended with the soy sauce, garlic and cumin. I would recommend using low sodium soy sauce and skipping the extra salt. I used fresh-from-the-garden green beans as well but steamed them briefly first so that they wouldn't be hard. It worked well.

Saltado de Vainitas Haiku: "Way too strong and 'rich.' Have to eat this over rice, to thin out the 'urgh!'" Made this as directed (using fresh green beans instead of frozen) and should've trusted my gut when using 1 TB cumin, 6 TB soy sauce, 6 TB white wine vinegar, and 1 c. cilantro; yes, those seemed just unusual enough of ingredients that I figured they would come together in an interesting, flavorful way, but in that amount it was OVERPOWERING. I would gladly make this again, but would drastically reduce everything, or would consider, like a previous review, marinating the chicken first in some of the soy/cumin/OO. Strangely enough, we liked the tomatoes in this best of all, and I thought that was the most peculiar addition, but what made this edible for us at least was serving it over plain basmati to take away some of the /carton-eyes-popping-out-of-head.
