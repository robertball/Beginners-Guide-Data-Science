Absolutely delicious!!!  Hubby was so curious as to how I made them, because they tasted SO good, "like they are from a restaurant", he said. I followed the recipe exactly as written. This is simple to make, and comes together really quickly so you can have dinner or an appetizer in no time.  I can see myself making this over and over again. The sauce is perfect. Thanks for the fabulous recipe, Mark!

So sad to say we probably won't have this again as we didn't love it.  I had high hopes because Honey Walnut Shrimp is a fav here and this was also a mayonnaise based sauce with a little kick.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the recipe, just our taste.  BTW LilSnoo's photo is amazing!

I loved it and it was so easy!!!  I kept to the recipe but, had to make a small adjustment due to what I had on hand.  For the Thai sweet chili sauce andchile-garlic sauce I subbed my Thai Chili Garlic Paste and Guy Fieri's Asian BBQ Wok Sauce(added this for the sweetness).  I will make again!

Didn't finish my review! We may try not to lay the sauce on so thick, or try cooking the sauce into it a bit more after putting it on. Either way the taste and texture were still perfect!

This was really, really tasty.  Based on other reviews, I expected it to be "like that seafood chain's spicy shrimp appetizer".  It was close, but my sauce seemed to turn out a little sweeter and there seemed to be a lot more sauce than was needed.  

I turned the whole thing into a meal and served it over rice noodles.  I definitely plan to make this again, but with some modifications to the sauce.

this was absolutely delicious. Any size shrimp will do, although I cut my jumbos in half so they would cook faster. Sauce is delicious but surprisingly there's no heat from the hot sauce. I added some toasted sesame seeds.. The green onion is key too. Yumm!

These were fabulous, no need to go to bonefish to pay 9.00 per plate for them.

We really liked this - it was a great appetizer. I only had large shrimp on hand, not the smaller ones that Bonefish uses, but they turned out just fine. The shrimp were VERY crispy outside, so the cornstarch is an excellent "foil" to the usual soggy mess saucing a battered & fried food produces. I didn't have the sweet chili sauce on hand, and so had to use tuong ot toi and mix it with 2 or 3 tbs honey. It really came close, but there was something missing we couldn't quite identify - maybe lime? Thanks for the recipe!

What a great, light crisp on a plump and juicy shrimp! Fantastic in its ease to make as well as the flavor it brings to the table! We will be making it again, and again, and again..... Delicious!!

I made several changes due to what I had on hand and to make the sauce mild, but they still tasted great!

Made this recipe using chicken breast tenders and it was amazing. I was heavy on the sriracha and heavy on the green onion, but otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely make again.

Have made this a number of times.  Always works out!!  Is a great "date night" dish......easy and few dishes.....Normally keep the leftover sauce and use it to dip chicken fingers in.....lots of fun!  Thanks for a good one!

I'm going to give it 5 stars because it was so delicious, but the amount of sauce was too much. I made this for dinner two nights in a row and i think i barely used 1/4 of the sauce. Also, sauce is too sweet for my liking so cut it with two capfuls of apple cider vinegar and red pepper and was amazing. I can't knock the recipe though for this, my own personal taste!

I liked this recipe a lot! The flavor wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it was still delicious. If you're thinking honey walnut-esque, this is not it. I followed the recipe for the most part, but didnt think there was enough variety of flavor. I had some musashi spicy mayo on hand and threw in a couple squeezes of that. Overall, I think I'd make this again. The corn starch did a great job of making the shrimp crispy!

I only used about 1/4cup of the sauce to coat the shrimp. The second time I made it I reduced the amount of mayo but kept the others the same and was still good spicier but we liked it that way

It's really good. My husband never gets excited about shrimp but he loved this. I think it is pretty darn close to that popular restaurant item. The only thing confusing is the sweet chili sauce. I got a sweet and spicy chili sauce and don't know if that is right, still added the siracha.

I had been searching for a recipe like this since it's so difficult to dine out with three kids.  After a couple other failed recipes, this one finally hit the nail on the head.  Absolutely delicious!
