Tastes pretty close to my Grandma's recipe.  I halved recipe and next time will make whole.  A powdered sugar glaze drizzled over is a nice touch.
EDIT: Well, I made it for Christmas for the whole family (And we haven't had my grandma's stollen sinced she passed away in 1997).  It was a hit!  I followed the recipe exactly but added 2 cups raisins.  So tender and flaky with a hint of lemon.

Finally someone who bakes a German Stollen like my German Mother (Yes she was born ans raised in Germany) taught me.  I've had discussion with people who tried to tell me it wasn't authentic.  But then, it isn't the Dresdener Stollen is it?

I have had many different types of stollen, however, this recipe is not for a stollen rather more a Raisin Bread or Breakfast bread. Stollen has more ingredients and is coated in Powder sugar. The Bread tasted best with honey butter on it.

My husband's parents are immigrants from Germany.  They have a tradition of making Stollen and delivering it to all the neighbors on Christmas Eve.  My husband always wants to do the same.  My mother-in-law gave me the recipe, but without any instructions!  This recipe was very similar to hers, so I just followed these instructions and it turned out great! We coated it with some powdered sugar glaze with almond extract.  This added just the right taste to compliment it.

Made this today for a catering event at work. It was great! I used apricot and dried cranberry's since that was the only dried fruit I had. Many compliments.
I will use this recipe again.
Thank you for sharing it.

it's not frosting that you put on top, it's powdered sugar with a bit of lemon juice mixed. And it's just a very thin layer which makes it just right.

The taste was very good, however, since it had only 1 envelope for over 5 cups of flour it did not raise much.  Rule of thumb is 1 envelope for 3 cups of flour.  I added cardamom 1/2 tsp.  The lemon zest gave it that special taste.

Wonderful stollen, just like my Germany grandma used to make...just the right amount of subtle flavors.  It makes a HUGE loaf...next time I will make two smaller loaves rather than one.

My whole family liked this bread a lot. It didn't rise as much as I would have liked it to, but i think that was my own fault. I put the milk mixture in with the yeast while it was too hot i think. Next time I might add more nuts and raisins. An awesome bread.

This is sooo good! I added about a 1/4 cup of cranberries to it along with the raisins and it added a splash of color and sweetness to the dough. also, I baked a thick rope of marzipan inside! This was delicious!

A blah recipe.  The stollen is bland in flavor.  Texture and size is good however.  I made 2 stollen recipes - this one and another one which has nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon.  My family (hubby, 19, 18 and 19 year old boys) preferred the 2nd one.  I will add that recipe after Christmas.

I attempted this before the holidays for my German colleagues.  From their responses, it was quite good but not the typical Stollen.  I am thinking they were expecting something like the Weihnachten Stollen.  Good stuff with a little butter or even honey.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I think I did like another reveiwer and added the yeast too soon/while the milk was still hot.  We will definately be making this again.  Thankyou for the recipe!

I'll use more yeast next time. When I shaped it into a loaf, it spread outward rather than rising upward very much, so I ended up with a rather flat, but very tasty stollen. I added 1/2 tsp cardamom, and will probably use just a bit more next time. When I brushed on the egg wash before baking, I sprinkled with a little sanding sugar. I might try the powdered sugar glaze, but I can't stand a stollen covered with a layer of powdered sugar. It hides the subtle flavors of the bread.
