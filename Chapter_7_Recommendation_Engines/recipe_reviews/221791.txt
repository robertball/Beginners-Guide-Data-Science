I don't have a pressure cooker so I had to modify this. I soaked the split peas in the refrigerator overnight to soften them. Then I stir fried the vegetables in a tablespoon of canola oil for a few minutes, before adding the spices. (I didn't have sambar powder, so used garlic chili paste) Next I added the peas, and then some water. I let the mixture simmer for about 15 minutes. The peas still came out a little firm, so maybe I should have cooked them a bit while I was cooking the veggies.  I served all over basmati rice. This recipe was OK, but it could have used a few more vegetables in my opinion.
