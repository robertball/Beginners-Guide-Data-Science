Do not make this caramel corn unless you plan to give it away, have rock solid will power, or the metabolism of a four year old.  It is highly addictive.  This past weekend I made it twice, once for a birthday gift and once because we were all sad to see it leave the house.  I used dark corn syrup and followed the recipe exactly.  To pop the popcorn, I put the kernels in a brown paper bag, folded the top over twice, and microwaved for 2-3 minutes.  No oil needed.  Repeat until you have 4 quarts.  The only tip I'd suggest that isn't in the recipe already is to also spray the spoon or spatula you use to stir the corn with cooking spray.  The pots and pans clean up easily after a soak in hot soapy water.  Then you can relax and attempt to avoid eating the entire batch of caramel corn all at once.

Oh my, this was the best! I took the advice of others and sprayed a roasting pan, left the popcorn in the oven while the sauce was preparing.  I also sprayed my spatula so nothing would stick.  Drizzled it and stirred it.  Helped to have someone mixing the popcorn around as I was drizzling it.   Cooked it 45 min and stirred it every 10 min.   Laid it out on parchment paper and it was delicious.  Gone!  Very easy, just time consuming because of the stirring but so easy for anyone to make and look like a pro!  I am going to try adding peanuts and drizzle chocolate next time.

Delicious corn. I used to make Amish Caramel Corn from this site, until I ran out of light corn syrup. This recipe used dark corn syrup so I tried it out, and it was great. I popped a generous 1/3 cup corn, and it was great. The liquid foams a bit in the oven, which really helps with coating the popcorn. Also, dark corn syrup doesn't have the high fructose syrup light corn syrup has.

I am a beginner and have never made caramel corn, but this is definitely the recipe to learn!  I took this to an office party after making it only once and I got rave reviews!  Great recipe!

I've been making caramel corn for years and I decided to try this recipe because I didn't want to search for the recipe I normally use.  I'm so glad I did because this recipe is the best caramel corn recipe I have ever tried.  The only thing I did differently is lower the oven temperature to 225 degrees and bake for an hour stirring every 15 minutes.  I also use a 20" diameter stainless steel mixing bowl to bake the caramel corn and a silicone spatula to stir.  It's a lot easier and I don't have to worry about caramel corn dropping out of the pans when I stir it.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I'd do it.

This was very good. We couldn't stop eating it! I did as the directions stated. However, I used butter flavored microwave popcorn. It took 2 bags to make 4 quarts. It was very rich.. I think because of the extra butter coating on the popcorn. We didn't mind at all! I also stirred every 10 min. while it was cooking in the oven. It came out very crunchy and not sticky.

This has a higher proportion of corn syrup than most. I think that made it take a few minutes longer to cook up crispy. This was good, but I think ones with less syrup versus brown sugar are more flavorful.

Delicious!  I used my air popper, so baking the corn to get all the moisture out before pouring on the carmel was key.  I had some carmel left over so we put it on apples too.  We used light Kara syrup (like it makes a difference!) but it still came out great.

This was really good except for the fact that I don't think I stirred it enough times throughout the baking process because some bits came out burnt. But the parts that were edible were delicious!! Followed recipe to a T, I will be making it again.

I've made this recipe 4 or 5 times during the holidays, and every time I make it, it doesn't last more than a day. This is a very good recipe for home-made caramel, and is a great alternative to melting 40 (or so) individually unwrapped caramels. The way I figure it, it'll take me about as long to make the caramel as it will to unwrap all of those candies, and the quality of home-made items is typically better than store bought. A few side notes (as usual): Instead of measuring out 4 qts., I just use 2 bags of popped buttered microwave popcorn, and it the portioning comes out perfect. I also do line my cookie sheets with foil, the caramel corn comes off easier when scraping it with a greased spatula. I don't find it necessary to bake it for as long... Typically I bake my batch for about 30 minutes, scraping each tray (to prevent burning) every 10 minutes. I allow it to cool on foil, and have never really had the need to spray it with cooking spray. Once its cool, it comes off fine. This recipe received 5 stars in my opinion because it was simple, tasty, and came out perfect every time.

Take this recipe to another level - add a half teaspoon of cinnamon when you add the baking soda and vanilla, then drizzle with melted white chocolate chips after baking.  Tastes like Cinnabon!  Very addictive...

This was okay, but tasted more like popcorn balls than the caramel corn I remembered as a child. The recipe that turned out the way I like (more caramel-like) is the one called "My Amish Friend's Caramel Corn" also on this website. It is a 5 star, if not more, recipe.

Perfect recipe exactly as is.  Use Reynolds Non-Stick Aluminum Foil to line the pan, and a wooden spoon rather than a spatula and you'll have no problem with the batch sticking to the roasting pan.  We didn't even empty the batch onto another sheet of foil.  Just left it in the roasting pan.

If I could have found the 6th star on here, this recipe would have got it. Just pulled out the first batch of caramel corn I've ever made in my extensive cooking life and I am addicted! Better than anything we've ever bought and surprisingly easy. Try this, it is delicious!

Very easy to make and very tasty.  One cup of popcorn kernels made just enough to be covered by the sauce as listed.  I will make this again and pass on the recipe.

My grandmother used to make caramel corn every year at Christmastime.  I remember being fascinated as the caramel bubbled up after adding the baking soda and then helping her mix the sauce with the popcorn in a giant metal mixing bowl.  I couldn't wait until the corn was done baking in the oven, so I usually sneaked a kernel or two each time she took it out to stir it.  My own daughter was just as impatient as I made this caramel corn last night and she was delighted when it was finally done baking and was cool enough for her to eat a big bowlful.  Making this brought back memories of being in the kitchen with my Granny and it tastes even better than I remembered.  Thank you, Karo, for letting me relive a part of my childhood and for a great tasting recipe for my family!

didn't seem like quite enough carmel to cover the corn. Otherwise the taste was pretty good.

This is fantastic!  No need to change a thing. I did use two bags of microwave popcorn like another person wrote in the review section because that was what I had in the house. Absolutely wonderful recipe.

So, I have now made this 3 times in the last week.  That pretty much says just how good this recipe is.  It is addicting, and so easy to make.  I have the recipe memorized and will be making it regularly.  The store/candy shops caramel corn doesn't even compare!

Yum! This was so easy to make. The first time I ever made this I thought clean up would be hard but after running the pan under hot water for a minute, clean up was a breeze. It was really tasty. Next time I'm going to drizzle melted milk chocolate and white chocolate over it with a fork. Can't wait.

Awesome caramel corn!  It was easy to make and the payoff was that people LOVED it.  Some of my family who never even eat caramel corn raved and said they ate the whole canister!!  Will definitely make it again.

This popcorn is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!  I used light corn syrup which was fine.  Some helpful tips:
I did not use cooking spray.  I lined a large (sheet cake) pan with parchment paper.  It did not stick at all.  I stirred it right in the pan on the parchment paper and let it cool right on the paper (did not use foil).  Only cooked for 30 mins after adding caramel and it was fine.  Used a pampered chef rubber spatula to stir and that did not stick either.  Enjoy!

Excellent! I didn't add the salt because the popcorn I used was already salted as was the 1/2 cup butter. Other than that small tweak this was fantastic!
I am going to try and make it green and yellow for a Packer game if possible....

I made it exactly as directed. I made MANY batches to give away for Christmas gifts. I made 1/2 cup popcorn in a hot air popper. For baking, I started out using a cookie sheet, then went to a roaster, and ended up with a HUGE stainless steel bowl that I bought at Sam's Club for under $10. It made the process so much easier. I did not find that I had to spray the bowl. I did spray the rubber spatula to make stirring easier. I broke the corn apart as it cooled (it cools quickly). I had so many compliments! I already passed this recipe along to my daughters and this will be included in our annual Christmas baking. Thank you for sharing!

Easy,delicious and presents lovely in a cellophane gift bag (if it makes it that far!). My guys gobble this up as soon as it's ready. I recommend real butter and dark Karo syrup as opposed to margarine and light Karo syrup.

OMG! This recipe is OUTSTANDING!!! I used light corn syrup and followed the directions exactly. I used a little over 1/3 cup of un-popped popcorn kernels and popped in a pot on the stove with a little oil. This is better than anything you will EVER buy in a box... my advice is to keep the recipe handy, you'll be making it often!!!

i would give 10 stars if I could!! THIS IS AMAZING!! COMPARABLE TO T**SYS!! We made multiple batches and gave gift bags full to our neighbors this year instead of making cookies. I made 3x batch at a time and used my large/deep roasting pan. It was SO easy and way less work and less mess than cookies. Imade it even easier by buying prepopped popcorn. Very cost effective, the ingredients you need make many batches. I will NEVER buy carmel corn again!! :)

Awesome!  I got a brown paper grocery bag from the grocery store and when it said to pour and stir, I just put the popcorn in the bag and poured the syrup over it and shook to coat then put it back in the pan.

Best ever made or bought! I doubled the recipe (used 4 bags microwave popcorn) and used half light cornsyrup and half dark. It was perfect!  It made two very full gallon size ziploc bags. Perfect for family movie night and then some.

I tried this carmel corn while testing recipes looking for prospective Christmas gifts.  If a single kernal makes it into Christmas tins it will be a miracle.  Just like mom used too make.  Good enough too gift.

This recipe is great!  I had never made caramel popcorn before and had no problems, and it turned out great, crispy, not chewy at all.  I made it for a second time today.  I didn't have enough brown sugar so I used half white sugar and it worked just as well.  I also decided to stretch it further and use just over 2.5 bags of microwave popcorn (smartpop, so not the super buttery kind), and it's still great, and still very sweet and crispy (my photo is of the second batch with the more popcorn to caramel ratio).  

The biggest trick I learned was to skip the shallow roasting pan that just made for awkward stirring, big messes and unevenly coated popcorn and opt for the really big stock pot.  It worked wonderfully.  I stirred every 10 min 3 times and then left it for the last 15 min.  Also I didn't take it all out at once at the end, I took about 1/5th out each time onto parchment paper, and returned the rest to the oven.  That way I could separate the individual popcorn pieces easier and wasn't having to deal with a giant solid mass which had to be physically broken rather than separated.

I buy my popcorn from Vic's, then I don't have to pick out the unpopped kernels. This is great, I made 6 or 8 batches, each one was perfect. I gave it away in big tubs from Walmart for Halloween.

EXCELLENT! I have to say that this actually took me 2 tries to get it right, lol. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up w/ a burnt mess. I came back to read through the reviews and noticed that no one else seemed to have this problem, so I adjusted the cooking times/temps. with how my stove/oven run, which is HOT, and proceeded from there. The end result was beautiful, delicious, buttery, crunchy, yummy goodness! With the adjustments that I had to make, I would not hesisitate to make this again...and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

VERY YUMMY!  The recipe needs no changes.  It was very easy to make.  I used parchment paper in place of spraying the foil.  This would make a great treat for any Halloween party when placed in a see-through glove, tied with ribbon, and a spider ring.

This is the recipe that I use, and people LOVE it!  I have found that microwave popcorn works fine (light version) if you don't have an air popper.  I usually like to cook it longer at a bit lower temperature (I cook it for 45 minutes at 250, then turn it to 200 for 20 minutes longer) and it makes it crispier and much tastier.  I also add pecan halves - awesome!  The best change that I do now is to line my pan(s) with parchment paper!  Nothing sticks to it at all, and cleanup is a breeze!

This is soooo good. I love popcorn, and this was so worth it. I made a 4-5 cup batch, just to test it out, and I should have made more. I decreased the sugar to under 1/2 a cup, margrine and corn surup to 1/4 cup, salt and BS to 1/4 teaspoon. I also added some glazed pecans, best thing I could of done. Thanks so much for the recipe:)

Cant say enuff about this recipe!! Have made 6 batches, as I am giving it for Christmas gifts, and not a single batch has been anything but perfect! The 45 minute cooking time is not necessary, but the 10 minute stir time is. Have taken it out as soon as 20 minutes and it is still nice and crunchy. Very very good flavor also. Will never use another recipe. No need to!

What's not to like?  Easy, although it does take some time and non-stick spray, but it is hard to mess this up.  I made a double batch and used a large deep roasting pan.... pretty simple and takes hardly no extra work except making more popcorn.  Remember the non-stick spray!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out so well - the caramel corn is very delicious and easy to make! I made it using butter instead of margarine, which I highly recommend if at all possible. I can tell I will be making this a lot. Next time I'll use dark brown sugar so as to get a darker, slightly more molasses-y flavor.

This recipe is amazing! It is crunchy and then melts in your mouth, a big hit here. I did use light Karo Syrup and brought the mixture to a boil on medium-low heat, once it started to boil I reduced the heat to low and let boil for 5 minutes. It didn't burn and turned out wonderful.

I have been making this recipe for over 25 years.  My family and friends can't get enough of it.  Because it is time consuming and I make so much of it, I now just make it at Christmas time.  My tips I keep the popcorn warm while making the caramel it coats better, I use only imperial margarine and using dry roasted nuts will coat better than other kinds.  Also making sure to stir the popcorn every 15 minutes will help it become completely covered.   It is highly addictive but worth the wait according to my family (who would like to have it in a 25 gallon drum each year) ;)

This is perfection.  So easy and quick.  I used light Karo.  This is better than any carmel corn you can buy.  I poured mine out on parchment paper instead of foil, did not stick at all.  Stayed crispy till it was gone.

Absolutely wonderful!  I used microwave popcorn-the butter flavor-3 bags, picked through to make sure no kernels snuck in.  Then, as it was cooling, I threw some orange candy on top-it stuck and was yummy-peanut butter flavor, but you could use m&ms

This is super delicious but very time consuming. Just a heads up to anyone going to make it. My oven runs hot, so even at 250 it was burning even though I was stirring it every 5 minutes. So after 30 minutes I just took it out and let it cool. Still, we love it! I'm saving it for our Halloween party this weekend. It's sure to be a hit.

This is extra special delicious stuff!  The directions are easy to follow!  I had no idea how easy it was to make this.  That's a problem!  I would tell you to follow the advice of others and mix the caramel over the popcorn in a deep pan and then put onto the flat sheets to pop into the oven.  That step will save you cleanup and loss of fallen popcorn kernals!  Also, be sure to pick through the popped corn for unpopped kernals so as to avoid that problem!  Yum!

What a difference a couple ingredients can make!  LOL.  I accidentally left out the baking soda and vanilla the first time I made this.  It was absolutely delicious.  I just made it again, including the left out ingredients, and it's even better!!  I couldn't be happier.  Just as a note: I had a little more than 4 quarts of popcorn and added about a cup of peanuts to the mixture before putting it in the oven to warm, so I made a 1 and a half batch of the caramel coating.  It was perfect.

12/21/2016 - This has become my go to recipe for caramel corn. Everyone loves it! And it makes a great snack, great gifts, and a nice addition especially to fall and winter parties. I start with Microwave Popcorn from this site (adding no oil or salt). Why buy caramel corn when I can make it so easily? Such an addictive recipe! ***Update - made this for 2012 Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!

Really tasty caramel corn! It is essential to keep your popcorn warm before tossing it. Also, use a roaster pan for easier stirring.

I made this as a quick addition to the menu at our Christmas party when more guests arrived than anticipated.  I didn't have any corn syrup so I used maple syrup instead and added a dash of cinnamon, and it turned out great, and with a really good flavor!  Definitely making this again!

Although this is very good, it was better once I adjusted the recipe a bit: I did not use any cooking spray and had no trouble with sticking at any point during the process. I used light brown sugar, 1/4 cup light corn syrup and 1/2 tsp vanilla .. I only used 11 cups of popped corn and ended up with some very covered and very tasty popcorn. I only have my oven set to 225 and cook it for an extra 15 minutes. Worth it!

Something didn't quite work right.  My caramel was too viscous and the entire mass ended up stuck to the foil during the cooling process.  Spent more than 30 minutes peeling it off the foil!

I've tried making caramel corn before with other recipes with very little success. This recipe worked perfectly on the first try with very yummy results. Was going to drizzle with chocolate but it didn't last long enough to accomplish that. I think that says it all!!

I’ve made this recipe 3 times now and it will be my “go to” caramel corn recipe from now on. I have a big extended family and everyone gives it five stars. I always add a little bit of cayenne pepper and cinnamon to the ingredients before cooking the caramel.

I was amazed at how perfect this came out!!! SO delicious!! I cut the brown sugar and corn syrup back by half and added everything else that the decile called for. It was amazing!! We have it to the kids' teachers for their parent teacher conferences and they loved it!!! I made it with light corn syrup and it worked perfectly!

Mine was completely burned and black on the bottom after less than 10 minutes of baking.  Don't know what I did wrong- everyone else seems to cook their caramel corn!

The 'boil for 5 minutes' part burned the sugar and ruined the whole dish, pretty upset about that.

My kids starting gobbling this up before it even cooled off.  It's better than any store bought version.  I made two batches one with and one without peanuts.  I think real butter is key.  It's Amazing!  Easy and inexpensive with ingredients you probably already have on hand. This started a new Christmas tradition at our house.  Thank you for this great kid friendly recipe.

Nothing needs to be changed, it's perfect as is. But, if you like salted caramel... you can  add sea salt at the end when you  spread it out to cool. I found that parchment paper works best for these sticky tasks like caramel & such. But most home cooks may not have on hand.  This was a hit at the football game, GO PATS!!!

My 6 year old was complaining that we were out of Cracker Jacks.  This made a great substitute. My wife and kids all had trouble staying out of this once it was made.  Will definitely make it again.

I did the carmel part of this recipe in the microwave.  I found that the 4 qt pyrex measuring cup was just on the small side when boiling for five minutes.  I had some of it over-flow.

Best recipe I have ever tried hands down. It was not that difficult and we had most ingredients on hand. We did sub pancake syrup for the karo but it was still amazing and all gone. We will be making more tomorrow!

I tried this it was good. My favorite is the sea salt caramel corn Snapdragon Treat Company makes theirs with organic ingredients but when I can't order theirs then this is almost as good.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly! I popped 4 bags of microwave popcorn and the caramel sauce made the perfect amount to cover all the popcorn. I stirred the popcorn every 10 min. and I'm glad I did because it clumps together pretty quickly in the oven, so stirring every 10 was perfect. I spread it all out on waxed paper and let it cool completely and then used a chocolate drizzle on it! (I bought the microwaveable chocolate wafers, dipped a chopstick in it and then drizzled the chocolate. This stuff is soooo good!!

This caramel corn is the best! the only thing that I changed was I changed out the corn-syrup with the same amount of Mrs. Butter worth's thick-n-rich syrup it to me gives a little more flavor. Made it with the corn-syrup just as good.

Loved it!  FYI, if you're popping your kernels in the microwave in a brown bag, one cup of uncooked kernels equals a little over 4 quarts of popped popcorn.  I would also have a large bowl on hand to do all the mixing with. Trying to pour the caramel sauce over a pan full of popcorn makes a great mess. And spray your stirring spoon with nonstick spray before you start. ??

Do it exactly as the directions say and you have the most perfect caramel corm around. By far my most favorite recipe on allrecipes.com. I made it for Christmas gifts and got raves.

My first batch - perfect. My second batch I added peanuts- even better.  Because I like peanuts. It tastes like Cracker Jack. I even put little prizes inside each jar for a fun surprise.

Read the other reviews. Stirring it every 10 minutes is key, and spraying all the pans, utensils and tinfoil works so well.  When I spread it out I tap it apart with a wooden spoon so it doesn't end in chunks, but individual pieces, like Cracker Jack. SO IMPRESSED.

Thank you so much for this recipe. It will remain a family favorite for years to come. :) Happy holidays.

This caramel corn was excellent!  So easy to make, takes no time at all. I used butter and since my oven isn't working I made this in a roaster oven. I'll be making this for Christmas gifts.

This is a great recipe!  I wanted to add peanuts to make my own Cracker Jax.  My saw the can of Spanish peanuts and made a comment about not wanting peanut skins in here caramel corn, so I spent about 30 minutes "skinning" half of the can of peanuts:(.  I mixed about 1/2 cup of the peanuts into the caramel mixture just before pouring it over the popcorn.  It worked Perfectly!  This is a keeper.

Made this today to take up to our RV on the weekend - curious to see how it stores for a few days. Made regular popping corn. It's very easy and the flavour is very good and I changed nothing in the original recipe. One thing I did at the end was pour/shove/spoon the mixture into a very large PLASTIC bowl and mixed it around with a wooden spoon until it cooled. The popcorn stayed separated. I use this same cooling/separating method with caramel Chex mix. The bowl MUST be plastic - it won't burn or melt the bowl.

I don't know what is better the way it tastes or the way the house smells while making it. Reminds me of being in Kilwins in Harbor Springs.

This was exactly what I was hoping for.  It is a classic caramel corn and so easy to make.  Absolutely make sure that you spray oil on the spoons you use as this stuff sticks like glue.  If you are lacking will power this may just be a single serving batch.

This recipe is delicious just as it is written! The only thing I did different was after popping the popcorn I put it on the pans and popped it in the oven to keep it warm and to pull some of the moisture out. I have added roasted peanuts to it to make a homey version of Crunch N' Munch and it totally rocked our socks off! This is sooo much better than plain ol' popcorn for Movie Night at our house! And the best part? There are never ever any leftovers so I don't have to convince myself to stay out of it the next day!

We love this stuff!  My only word of caution is that if you have an oven that bakes hot,  watch this very carefully. I managed to scorch one batch.  No worries...  The dog said it very tasty!

I am ***12*** years old and I made this myself. It was SOOOO good! In fact, my family and friends loved it so much, my leader is making me teach my youth group how to make it. Totally the best. If you follow the instructions right, its hard to mess up. If you want it gooey, cook it less. I'm not lying, it is really awesome. If you have a spare hour, DO IT! My only complaint was that it was so good, they couldn't stop eating it! ha ha :) -E C S

Fabulous! I made 2 batches because we couldn't stop eating it. The first time I made it as stated but felt the caramel should have covered the popcorn more. So I made extra caramel for the second batch which covered it completely, but it did not taste better! Next time I will decrease the popcorn to maybe 3 or 3 1/2 quarts instead of 4. Still, this is THE recipe, and better than any others on this site that I have tried.

Love, love, love this recipe! Followed it exactly as written and loved it so had to make another batch right away.  I tried a different one that a friend recommended and didn't like it at all. This is nice and crispy. One thing I did learn is make sure you have good popcorn! Makes a huge difference.

I put a simple twist on this and use puff corn.  I love Carmel corn but dislike the kernels or hard bits and covers that come with the popcorn.  Puff corn is big and of course puffy with none of the tooth breaking elements.  Think of puffed cheetos without the cheese flavor.  Cheetos brand makes it as do a few other companies.  I also love to throw in cashews or other nuts.  Just made two huge batches to give for Christmas.  Always gets rave reviews except for my husband who groans at me that he does not have the willpower to not eat way too much of it!  Blessings.

This is perfection and so so easy!  Make sure your popcorn is warm to make the caramel go on easier.  I did bake mine a bit longer and it stayed crisp in an air tight container for a week.  This is a regular at our house!

This was good, and the teachers at my school thought it was a great surprise treat at our weekly meeting. It stores well, and definitely has that classic caramel corn taste - just like what we got on the boardwalk when I was a kid.

Really good and surprisingly great with Candy Corn M&M's. With the right additions to the mix and a little more salt than the recipe calls for, the sweetness won't be overbearing.

So....Stinkin'....Yum! Not only had I never made caramel corn, I'd never popped popcorn on the stove. It's ridiculous how easy both were. This will be a staple at our house from now on.

I make this caramel corn all the time.  If you're anxious to eat this (& don't mind getting your hands a bit sticky), DON'T BAKE IT.  I've never put it into the oven.  I just mix it up in the large plastic bowl & eat the whole thing all by myself.  It's so good.  I usually wait to weigh myself for a few days after eating it.  This is my go-to snack when there's nothing in the house to eat.  I can never wait the additional 45 minutes to bake it.  I'm getting ready to make this for a church group.  I will bake it to keep it from being sticky.  After reading all the reviews, I'm sure it will be as good or even better.  Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent.  While cooking the syrup I also used a candy thermometer.  I wanted to see how hot it got while boiling for the suggested amount of time - and it did come to a hard crack stage.  The caramel coating was crisp, crunchy and full of caramel flavor.  One of our favorites!  I shared this at work also and it went over VERY well!

I too never made caramel popcorn before.  This was to die for!  Cracker Jacks and Crunch n' Munch ain't got nuttin on this.  So good!  My husband and kids loved it too.  I used BJ's cooking spray and McCormick Pure Vanilla, as I didn't have what was listed.  I did use the Karo Light Syrup, but will have to try the Dark Syrup next time.  I'll also have to use chocolate and other goodies in it too.  As for the clean-up, I filled the  pan used to make caramel with water about 3/4 of the way up and put in a couple of tsps of baking soda. Bring to a boil for a couple of minutes and viola, all the caramel is off of the pan.

A good basic. However, I use only butter. Period.  I substitute 2 T Molasses for part of the syrup, and use only dark brown sugar.  Now it truly is a Dark Classic!  Much richer and more flavorful. This recipe works well to make popcorn balls, also.

I am bad about reviewing things, but this is so good & amazingly easy to make.  It took me about an hour, including popping the corn & cleaning up the mess.  I lined my roasting pan with foil and sprayed it with cooking spray.  I couldn't believe how easily it came off of my pan and everything else.  I didn't do the best job of coating all the corn, but I'm sure no one will complain.  I'll do a better job next time.  I'm glad I remembered to spray everything, including my whisk & spatula.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very good recipe...I was hoping for something a little more soft and gooey.  This recipe gets very hard and crunchy.  Act II used to sell microwave caramel corn and it was the best I've ever had - too bad they dont make it anymore!

Ok this is too easy!  On my first attempt half the corn was consumed before the 45 minute bake time was up.  It is better when done but plenty deliscious before too.

This amazingly simple and good.  It's a cross between popcorn balls and caramel corn, with the benefits of both.  It's just gooey enough to cover the popcorn and you can eat it in pieces rather than trying to chomp into a sticky ball- so awkward.  My fam loved it and it's a quick treat.
***** 
I also tried the 1000 watt microwave method that worked just as well. To replace the stove top.  Instead of ingredients in the saucepan on stove, put the ingredients in a bowl (mine was a heavy ceramic) nuke for 4 min at a time stirring in between 3 times and then reduce power to 50% for the 5 minutes of boiling time.  Remove bowl, add remaining ingredients and dump on the popcorn- used a parchment lined cookie sheet.

This is my 3rd time making this. Definitely use a rubber spatula and take out of over as you mix it. A great recipe.  I doubled it and gave out bag  of caramel corn as gifts.  Everyone loved it. I broke up some chocolate covered pecans and mixed in one batch 5 minutes before it was to come out of the oven. My mother is going to love it. A can’t miss recipe!

Possibly the best crunchy caramel corn I've ever had. I could never make this recipe unless company was coming over or I was bringing it to an event, because I think I would sit and eat my way through the entire batch. I also like caramel corn that stays chewy, and that was typically what I would make because I much preferred it to the crunchy type. But now, after finding this recipe, it's a toss up for which is my favorite! Note: I used light corn syrup.

Buttery, crunchy, salty and sweet.  Better than anything you can buy.  I made this tonight for my New Year’s Eve gathering tomorrow night and I’m just hoping it will last until then!  I used 4 bags of microwave popcorn and made 1.5 times the recipe for the caramel.  Delicious and addicting.

Turned out good. I did 1 hour @ 225 and stirred every 15. Turned out on bare marble island. 
For popping, put good 1/8th cup At a time in paper bag for 3 min in microwave.

Absolutely to die for recipe for caramel corn!  I use this recipe every year. It goes really well with my holiday mix of white chocolate and dark chocolate pretzels, toffee, marshmallow, with hint of cayenne. The caramel corn is definitely the star.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR RECIPE!

I accidentally used too much popcorn so was more between kettle corn and full Carmel corn. 
Husband took to his work and it was all gone in no time! Was texted for recipe! Success. 
‘
Making bigger batch this weekend.  Soooo good. I used real butter and my homemade Madagascar vanilla.  So will try to do it correctly and see ow much better it gets!

This turned out just like what I made years ago!! I couldn’t find my recipe, so I tried this one, it’s a winner!! I used the coating per recipe, but had probably had twice the amount of popcorn. I also had it in the oven 60 minutes, stirring it every 15 minutes.

This caramel corn is absolutely delicious! I popped my popcorn in an air popper with a little bit of vegetable oil, and I think it made all the difference! It was light, crunchy, and delicious! Because it makes such a large batch, I split the 4 quarts in half and put them on baking sheets when I put them in the oven. Then, I left one batch plain, and drizzled the other half with white and milk chocolate! Yummy!!! Definitely make ASAP!!! It’s SOOO worth it!!

Easy to make.  I used a candy thermometer since my pan was a lot bigger than 2 quarts so it boils faster.  Only took about 3 minutes to hit 241 degrees which is roughly what you are looking for.  I also added almonds and cashews.  It's cooling on the counter now but I've tasted it and it's delicious.

Followed recipe exactly. It came out great! Next time I will take it out a few minutes sooner as it was on the verge of having a slight burnt taste. But that is only because my oven runs hot!

This turned out really great! Since my husband likes spicy, I added a half teaspoon of Cheyenne and it really put it over the top!!

Love this recipe but surely the 4 qts of popcorn is a misprint. That's a ton of popcorn! I use 4-5 cups!

This is an old recipe I have made for years. WARNING: wont last long as it tastes better than anything you can buy! Can also make into popcorn balls if desired.

Second time making this- It is great! I am very careful to pay attention to the caramel when it's boiling for 5 minutes, it starts to burn very fast. 

If you want to switch it up a bit, melt peanut butter chips (like white chocolate chips, only peanut butter flavored) in the microwave, about a 1 cup, heat in 30 second increments, stirring in between. Drizzle over cooled caramel corn on parchment paper.

I have been making this recipe for years niw. It’s a big hit with family and friends. I have always used light corn syrup and when drying out the popcorns RN with the caramel sauce, I bake it fir 20 min. Then I stirr it around and shake it, I keep doing it for an hour. The best ever!

OMG. This recipe is amazing! Some things aren’t worth making from scratch. Trust me, this caramel corn is worth it. It’s crispier and “lighter” than any caramel corn I’ve ever had. I made 2 batches in 2 days. I microwaved 1/2 cup raw corn in a silicon “colonel popper” I got from amazon. On my 2nd try, I used 2 sheet pans lined with foil, which made stirring and dispersing the caramel easier and clean up was really easy.

Ive made this caramel corn twice now and my family loves it!!  Super easy to make.  It's not too sweet and doesn't get sticky if you keep it in an air tight container.  I would highly recommend this recipe!

Pretty good. First go around I followed the recipe to the T. Came out more crispy than I would have liked. Second time I added some extra popcorn, and baked the popcorn only 15 minutes, stir, then another 10. Much better! Think I’ll add some kind of nut next time. The caramel sauce was SUPER easy and quick! Thanks for the ingredients and how to!

I have been making Carmel Corn for years and lost my recipe.  I am so glad I was able to find it here.  My family, friends and co- workers would pitch a fit if they didn’t get a bag of my Carmel Corn for Christmas.  Sadly I made that mistake one year and had to hear about it well into July!
This is the exact recipe I use. I do however add a few things!  I reduce the popcorn to 3 cups and add a cup of pecans and pretzels to make 4 cups.  Once this comes out of the oven and cools completely I add a bag of Ruffles potatoe chips and then drizzle melted white chocolate followed by a drizzle of milk chocolate. Then let that harden.  Then break it up a little and bag it. I usually make about 20 batches every Christmas. I do warn you if you start giving this as a gift expect to be making it every year. It is so addicting and every one Loves it.

Worked for a first-timer PLUS it's easily made  vegan! My first time EVER making homemade caramel corn and it came out fantastic! My husband loves it so much he wants to learn how to make it too! Bonus: I used vegan buttery sticks (Earth Balance) in place of the butter listed (I guessed that might work okay, since it said butter OR margarine) so my vegan daughter could eat it and it came out great tasting for all! I've not only never made homemade caramel corn before...but I've never even KNOWN anyone who did. But it wasn't hard at all (just took a little time).  I'm looking forward to taking this to many holiday (and other) gatherings in the future to impress people...and share yummy caramel corn!  ;-)

Turned out awesome!  Didn't take  as long in the oven (about 30 minutes), and it seems like there wouldn't be enough topping for all of that popcorn, but there is.  Recommendation - stir at least every 10 minutes.  Also, I used parchment paper instead of spray on the sheet, worked great!

This recipe doesn't last long at my house! It's definitely a favorite in the Winter months, especially just as the popcorn comes out of the oven! I did have difficulty with the sauce sticking to just about everything, but I'll grease my spatula next time as other have suggested.

I omitted the corn syrup and stirred while boiling and it was still really good. Easy clean up too without the syrup! Second make this week! So good! Reminds of Cracker Jack.

First time I've made caramel corn and this was simply the best I've ever had! Even above what's made at the carnival. I tweeked the recipe a bit and added raw chopped almonds, shredded coconut (sweetened) to the popcorn and poured the caramel over (best caramel hands down - even my hubby couldn't keep his hands off and he detests, absolutely HATES caramel). I didn't go 45 minutes in the oven, I feared it would burn, and after stirring twice, mine was perfect at 20 minutes. After breaking it apart, I decided to pour melted chocolate over half of the mixture (going for the girl scout cookie flavor), and it was amazing! Have a big bowl or 2 gallon ziplocs handy, as you will need them if you don't gorge yourself right away (which I nearly did). This recipe is definitely becoming a staple - and it was so easy!

This recipe is the best.  I changed one ingredient.  I don't use corn syrup.  I substituted that with pure maple syrup.  It's delicious!

I made this tonight and it was just what I was craving! Crunchy, buttery and like another review said, it doesn’t stick to your teeth. Delicious! I drizzled mine with some milk chocolate for a “Mouse Munch” minus the nuts! I will be trying that version too! Thank you for the recipe! No doubt it will be gone in a blink:)

I added more salt, to make salted Caramel popcorn,  and it worked quite well, however it turned out harder then I would have liked it to be. No matter what, I tasted like gold.

Use butter for the best flavor.  Also, line baking sheets with parchment paper for easy clean up.

Oh my goodness!!! This is absolutely fantastic! I had to use golden syrup since corn syrup in s not easy available in New Zealand. I used Butter Lovers microwave popcorn (why hold back?) My grown up sons could not stop eating. Im not sure how it’s supposed to taste with corn syrup but this golden syrup version was an absolute triumph!

This is a good receipe. It always turns out well. I always use a quailty dark brown surgar. It gives the caramel corn a darker richer look and flavor. One mod I do that my friends and family like is I add 1 tsp of caramel extract with the vanilla. It gives it a little more caramel flavor.

Caramel corn is my weakness, and this is hands down the best recipe I've every tried. It is highly addictive. I had to just take a bowl full and put the rest away and hid it from myself. I'll be making a batch for each of my grown kids for Christmas.
Edit: If you have too much syrup, you're not using enough popcorn. If you are burning it, you aren't following the directions correctly.  Make sure you are baking at 250 and stirring it about every 15 minutes.  It comes out perfectly every time for me.

This is the best!! I use a roasting pan sprayed with Pam and bake at 250 degrees for 45 minutes, taking out and stirring well at 15 minute intervals. I use 1/4 cup Karo  light syrup and 1/4 cup Karo dark syrup, perfect balance of flavors, otherwise as instructions. Be sure to use dark brown sugar for a more caramel taste. Fantastic recipe, thank you.

This stuff is the most amazing caramel popcorn ever. Hell, you could use the recipe to make yourself just a tray of the caramel and it would be beyond perfection. I made a batch this evening. The only thing I wish I'd done differently is I didn't keep my popcorn warm in the oven. I wish I'd seen that part of the recipe. That and my caramel was very thick and I'm not for certain why, so it didn't coat it completely, still it's the best caramel popcorn we've ever tasted.

Not only is this recipe so simple that anyone can make it, but it's absolutely by far the most tasty Carmel Corn ever. I make in double batches weekly. This is perfect for parties, family get togethers/ holidays, and movie night at home.

Melts in your mouth!   So easy and delicious!  Here's a few tips I hope you find helpful. 

1.If you want a good ratio caramel to popcorn and for best results, POP 1 cup (yellow kernels) popcorn. 

2 Preheat that oven (it makes a difference)  and be sure to give it a good stir every 10 minutes.    Take it out of the oven to stir so you don't lose all of the heat with the door open!

3 After pouring the caramel over the popcorn be sure to stir using a wooden spatula or spoon.  Stir very well, at least a couple of minutes to evenly distribute. the popcorn one.

Ok, I'm going to be "that guy" because I made a few alterations to this recipe.  Instead of vanilla I added 1/4 cup Devils Cut whiskey, I used vanilla infused salt, and added pecans.  It is very good. I baked it on parchment paper, made it very easy to clean up too.

I made a change to this recipe, I really like a deep flavored caramel corn so I replaced the corn syrup with maple syrup, not the real kind but the pancake type. Was a hit. Made it for Christmas presents needed 84 quart bags. Everyone loved them. Didn't overpower the caramel with maple flavor but added a nice deep layer of flavor....

Loved it! I slightly increased all ingredients for caramel to make more sauce. I also decreased baking time to 20 minutes stirring every five minutes. It came out perfect and everyone raves each time I make it. Almonds and pecans make a great adddition and you can just throw them right in with the popcorn. I will make this again and again!

This was super tasty, we added Shreddies, peanuts, pecans, hazelnuts and cashews to ours. Will definitely make this again. Great thing to have at a party!

I scaled this down to 6 cups of popcorn. I followed the good advice of a reviewer of lowering the oven temp to 225degF and baking for 1 hour, stirring frequently (it does clump together quickly). I attempted to bake in a 15x10 pan w/sides, but I also liked her idea of putting it into a pot (which I did) for easy stirring---worked great, with nothing falling out. I had a problem with the sauce starting to burn towards the end of 5 min; I'll reduce the heat or the cooking time when I make again, and I definitely will. Delicious and addicting!

One of our family treats growing up was caramel popcorn with a soft sweet caramel. This recipe combines my love for sweet caramel with a good salty edge and crunch. This popcorn is stick to your teeth good. I mean this literally. But it's so delicious. It's also very easy. I followed the directions exactly except that (1) I used two normal sized bags of light salt/butter popcorn which was just a little more than 4 quarts (2) I used a pasta strainer to remove unwanted popcorn kernels (3)I used my well-spritzed-with-cooking-spray crockpot set on high to keep my popcorn hot while I mixed in the caramel. (4) I used a non-stick cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray instead of foil. (5) I did not bake for 45 minutes, rather, I poured out to cool after I mixed in the caramel. This may be why my caramel corn stuck to my teeth a bit, but I don't mind at all and it makes it much faster of a process. I have made this twice now and have added it to my cookbook!

Made this as-is and gave some away for the holidays (but kept some for myself, too. Yum!). My MIL is a big fan of caramel corn and said it was the best she's ever had. That's high praise!

Great recipe! Delicious, buttery caramel corn.  Stays crispy in airtight container for weeks!  One tip:  Once the popcorn has been coated with caramel, bake in 2 roasting pans. I use roasting pans with high sides to prevent popcorn from spilling into oven. Blend every 10 minutes while baking. This helps the caramel coat all of the popcorn.

Perfect 5 stars!  Follow it just as written.  All the 5 star reviews were right!  This will be my Xmas treat gift in pretty bags this year instead of cookies.  SO easy and flawless recipe!  I used light corn syrup and lightly salted microwave popcorn.  It will be gone by tomorrow at my boyfriend's construction site.

The popcorn is soooo good, very light and crunchy. I made half recipe and used 10 packages of honey instead of corn syrup. It took cup of unpopped kernel to make 2 quarts for half recipe. I used a candy thermometer and stopped cooking when it reached around 275 degrees. I also stirred the pot for the entire time. I worried that it would burn if I didn't stir for 5 minutes! I also found that it is easier to just pour the syrup directly into pans filled with popped popcorn. Also I didn't need to worry too much about stirring initially since I would coat the popcorn every 15 minutes. This recipe is fantastic. I would love to try adding spice such as Cajun or chocolate drizzle next time.

Wonderfully easy, but I don't have a pan big enough to be able to stir it all so this time I cheated a little on the popcorn and it turned out great. I like to toss in some pecans, walnuts, peanuts, whatever you have on hand but I have to make a plain recipe too for those that don't like the nuts.

Made 2 double batches of this today.  The first I added 1 tsp cinnamon with the baking soda and vanilla, and 1 cup freeze dried peanuts (used dark karo syrup).  Also drizzled some melted milk chocolate over that batch.  The second I added 1 tsp cayenne pepper powder with the baking soda and vanilla (used the light karo syrup here).  Took it to the gym that my husband works at and the kids went crazy!  (Hubby said that we would want me to make them both again, but hot one again for sure!)

I made this and it is the tastiest treat eveeer! I didn't make any changes however after making it a few times, I realize that you can not rush the process,  and the key to covering all the popcorn is in the turning portion of the process...make sure you turn frequently! This snack is FABULICIOUS!

A friend of mine shared this recipe with me a few years ago and I have made it a ton since then. I always double the recipe and I'm still sad when it's gone. It goes fast!

This for sure is a keeper!  I will make a few changes. I will use light corn syrup but will add one tablespoon of molasses. Increase cooking time to 7 minutes at a medium boil. As for the baking time I would add additional 15 minutes baking time or increase the temperature by 25°. I added a cup and a half of peanuts. The peanuts was added to the corn syrup mixture with one minute remaining to the cooking time, I would use butter and not any margarine or that stuff in a tub. Use large popcorn kernels.

I've never really baked anything before but this turned out good and gives me the sense I can follow directions.

I can't wait to share some of this stuff.  I think I'll make it again with gourmet popcorn sometime.

We loved it. I used microwave pop corn, 1 bag, and cut the recipe to 1/4th. It worked perfectly & taste awesome. I just wish I had enough to make a full recipe because I know we will want more. Yum!

Followed the recipe to the letter and got the best caramel corn I've ever had! 
DO spray everything that comes in contact with the nonstick spray to make clean up easier.

Great and simple recipe! I used my Pyrex baking dish with lid to pop my corn in the microwave. Easy, fat free and I like the consistency of the popped corn from the microwave vs. an air popper. The only thing better would be using a kettle of course! Also, I used pure maple syrup instead of corn syrup. Yum! If you decide to try, you would use the same amount of maple syrup or honey as corn syrup. I love the flavor way better than corn syrup! Spray your spoon with olive oil and work quickly once your caramel boils for 5 min. I had my popcorn warmed in a big steel bowl which made it easier to mix before I poured it onto the cookie sheet.

Really good caramel corn!!  I live in Guatemala and finding brown sugar is difficult, so I used instead a compressed brown sugar that tastes almost like molasses, and Wow!!  These were great.  More than plenty syrup, recipe went together really fast, and it tasted just the way I like it, crisp, crunchy and sweet.  This will become a staple for us, I think.

This is an excellent recipe!  Because my husband is diabetic,  I lowered the sugar by using only 1/2 cup of the brown sugar blend by Splenda instead of the 1 cup of sugar.  As another review added cinnamon , so did I.  
It tastes so awesome...and I'm a pretty picky eater.  After many years of non-use, I pulled out my air popcorn popper and made two batches of popcorn for this recipe.  Boy am I glad that I never got rid of this machine.  It is a major time saver.  Use it, if you have one.
Oh, and I don't use non-stick spray.  A light coating of butter greased inside the roasting pan works just fine.

Was very easy to make.  My family enjoyed this very much. When making this, it IS a good idea to spray non-cook spray on your wooden spoon, or plastic spatula while your mixing it while in the oven.  Awesome flavor. I had never made this before.

Fantastic! I could eat this until I pop! I left it in my metal bowl for baking in the oven, this made it a lot easier to stir. I also tried a couple of variations and they all turned out delicious! For our last family get together, I filled small decorative ziplock bags with this caramel corn, they were a huge hit! Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful! I wanted to surprise my husband and there was a moment I thought I might eat it all before he got home. I made it exactly as the recipe described. Good tips- spray everything down with cooking spray and clean up is pretty easy with a little hot water. Be patient with the first stir. Popcorn does not like to stay in the cooking dish until it is well coated.  Use multiple dishes so you don't overcrowd the pan if you can fit them on the same rack in your oven.

So awesome.  I have never made caramel corn before, as I'm not really a fan of it.  But my husband loves it and I figured it would be a good snack to have out at Easter, and wow was it well-received!  I even loved it!  I used a little extra popcorn, just so they would have a lighter coating, and sprinkled it all with a little sea salt.  I also took half and threw in some cashews and drizzled it with milk chocolate, and it was absolutely amazing! I will be making this A LOT!!

Excellent Carmel corn! Use a throw away foil tin roasting pan for easy turning! I doubled the sauce and made big batches in the pans for better coating! I give this away at Christmas as part of our homemade gift basket and everyone loves it!!

For the past two holiday seasons I've made Rum Cake. It got me thinking about rum Carmel corn. This is the first year I've tried it. I found this recipe, I added 3/4 cup of Kraken Black Spiced Rum during the boiling processes. OMG. This is totally delicious. Between my wife and I, I don't think we'll have any left for guests. Might have to make more. 

By the way, I'm not a Rum drinker, but Kraken taste awesome. I took a couple of sips and I really think it makes a difference. 

Good luck

Jim

Delicious! I added 1 cup of Spanish peanuts in half way through the boiling time and did everything else as written. Very good!

Wow, my kids & I loved this. We were going 2 put it in gift baskets but we ended up eating most of it. I have to get more stuff 2 make more & hide it from us. It is the best. Wish it didn't take so long 2 make. But let it bake the 45 minutes

I substituted maple syrup for corn syrup, and used only one cup of butter. You couldn't tell the difference. Fantastic recipe! This caramel corn will be made a lot in our home!

What a great and easy recipe! Followed it to the letter and used A.S.G's suggestion for making the popcorn in a paper bag in the microwave (thanks for the tip!) First batch turned out so well I decided to make another one....and added bacon....just because I can! :)

Needed 35 - 3 cups bags of these for baby shower party favors ("ready to pop" sticker on each one) and it is way too expensive to buy, so I used this recipe and made my own.  Very important to read all the reviews first and I took everyone's advice, so it went really smoothly. Pam spray all utensils, have an extra person to stir while you pour, have a hot soapy sink full of water before you start, start timing 5 min. from the 1st sign of a boil.  I used wax paper to spread it to cool.  Soooo delicious!!  I agree that the caramel mixture is a little more than you need.  For the rest of the batches, I just used more popcorn to start with.

I've never really been a fan of caramel corn, but on a whim, decided to make this for a neighborhood get together. Oh. My. Goodness. Is this what all caramel corn tastes like?!??!?! I couldn't even wait until it was finished to start eating it right out of the pan!! I'm glad I made a double batch, because I might just keep some for myself!

I have been looking for an easy caramel corn recipe to replace the one from Kraft (with the little caramel squares that you have to unwrap) and this looked too good to be true! I halved the recipe and made it in the microwave in a large measuring cup. It turned out awesome and I ate the whole recipe! I will have to make it again to prove to hubby that it was easy since he was out when I made it and didn’t get to taste it! Thanks!

This became my go to recipe last Christmas for potlucks, Christmas parties, etc.  It is buttery and perfect.  Made it once without having the popcorn warming in the oven and it was not a success...followed the recipe ever since and perfect.  I use a disposable covered roasting pan and it's perfect for parties, potlucks, etc.  Adding nuts makes it even better!

Leave it to Karo to bring us an easy, foolproof caramel corn recipe.  I used to make a recipe from a relative and couldn't locate for today's need, but this is much, much better.  Already done and packed for giving (alright, I did have a few tastes).  :-)  Thanks Karo...

Cannot leave it alone! I probably used a bit more popcorn so it wouldn't be quite as fattening and rich (3 microwave bags) and it is perfection,

I am not the world's best cook, so I was a little worried about "boiling" sugar and Karo Syrup, but following these directions just as instructed, created a caramel corn that is just beautiful to look at and delicious to eat! My husband is a terrific cook and he was really impressed! It's easy and so yummy!

Tastes terrific but be very careful not to overload the pan and also make sure that you have the popcorn EVENLY coated.

AMAZING, never made carmel corn before and tried this, OMG, soooooo easy and yummy. I have made it 7 times in 2 months, and I have tried alterations, for holidays (so far Val day and St Pat day) I use white sugar instead of brown, I always use light corn syrup, and when I add the vanilla and baking soda I dye the color, red and now green. Turns out wonderful and the children love the colors.

With Allrecipes, there is nothing I can't make.  I would have never thought I would have caramel popcorn in my very own living room watching a Netflix movie.  Easy and Delicious. Compared to other recipes it calls for much less butter which is always good. I didn't have to bake it as long as it directs. However the longer it sits once out of the oven the more crunchy it becomes.  Hot or cooled down it's great.

I'll just add to the OMG'S on this!  Everything that was said before is true.  Good, easy, and perfect.  I followed the recipe this time but will definitely take some of the hints written about adding chocolate and/or nuts!  Had to hide it for Super Bowl or it would be gone tonight.

I made this recipe for christmas baskets I was giving away.  It turned out amazing and everybody loved it!  So easy to make, I even used light microwaveable popcorn (2 bags).  If you are giving it away, I suggest putting the caramel corn in cellophane bags and tie them with ribbon.

Great recipe. I have made it several times, But I make 1 1/2. of the caramel, which covers the corn better. I have many fans when I make this.

Good recipe, I only just added some almonds and pecans to the mixture. I made a halloween mix by adding m&m's and gummi worms to it after it cooled.

I just made this and it is delicious!  I added dry roasted peanuts and that makes it even more yummy.  The directions were easy to follow.  I was worried when pouring the caramel that it wouldn't coat all the popcorn but as it baked and I stirred the popcorn, the caramel spread around and covered everything.  I stirred it every 10 minutes, using two wooden wok paddles.

Great recipe! I've never made anything like this before and it went flawlessly. There's just a lot of sticky cleanup! 

I used microwave popcorn and stirred it in right out of the microwave. I also used bacon-flavored popcorn for a twist on the original. It is... different. Bacon "flavor" is not bacon, but it works pretty well with the caramel.
