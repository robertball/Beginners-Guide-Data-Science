I've made these for years with slightly different proportions:  2 cups crunchy peanut butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 2 cups rice krispies and 1 1/2 cups softened margarine.  I, too, melt the choc. chips in the microwave with shortening.  I went to a Party City and bought a plastic dipping spoon in the candy-making department....and it makes dipping the balls a MUCH easier process!  Even when I double the recipe, every morsel goes.....as I place them on pretty plates or in pretty candy dishes and give them as Christmas gifts to very special friends!

I thought these were excellent! I added about 1/4 cup more peanut butter and it was very easy to form balls by pressing the mixture together.  Also- Instead of the messy process of dipping the balls, I used mini-muffin papers and covered the bottoms with melted chocolate and then added the peanut butter balls and poured chocolate over the top. Easy!

Oh my does this bring back memories! My Grandma Helen used to make these every Christmas and we all looked forward to them. I didn't have her recipe and I was so happy to find this on AR. I made these with my niece and we had a ball - no pun intended! I did made a couple of changes to made it hold together better. I used a whole jar of peanut butter (it's a little over 2 cups anyway), kept the butter the same, and reduced the sugar by 1 cup. I melted the peanut butter and butter in the microwave and then mixed everything. I put the peanut butter balls on cookie sheets lined with wax paper and let them chill for a few hours. I then dipped them in chocolate and red and green sprinkles for Xmas. Take one bite of these crunchy, peanuty, chocolatey little treats and you'll want to make these every year too!

Awesome! This is an excellant recipe! We didn't have any rice krispies so we took some kix and crunched them up and used those and they turned out great! Also, we had lots of trouble with the chocolate melting. It would get really grainy. Our solution was to put a little bit of chocolate in at a time over very low heat. It worked perfectly! Don't forget to stick toothpicks in the peanutbutter balls before you freeze them. Makes them much easier to dip;)

These are truly wonderful Christmas treats. I make them every year and they disappear in a hurry. Some advice...if you have an old fork you are willing to sacrifice, bend it so that is L shaped. Pour your melted chocolate into a narrow container and dip your pb balls this way. Keep a hot water bath handy if the chocolate starts to thicken. Also, if you tire of dipping in chocolate, another option is to roll in finely chopped pecans or walnuts, or a mixture of cocoa and powdered sugar...or you can just drizzle the chocolate over them in zig zag patern.

Very Good recipe.  Guests thought the chocolate was a little rich, I think next time I'll try milk chocolate chips.  Adding extra peanut butter is a good idea.  And I think adding 2 tablespoons of shortening to the chocolate makes it a thinner layer of chocolate.

Great hit for kids and adults.
Only used 2 cups sugar and 4-5 cups of rice krispies as I found it too wet to roll properly.
I liked the crunchy texture that I remembered.

This was delicious. I have never had peanut butter balls before, but they are similar to buckeys, with out the cereal. I found that forming the balls was a little difficult because the mixture kept sticking to my hands. I solved that problem by dipping my fingers in some water. I brought some into work and everyone thought they were great.

We used to call these "chestnuts" when I was little, because once they're dark chocolate-covered balls with a circle of peanut butter poking out on top.  These are really easy to make and they taste delicious.  The peanut-batter batter will be a bit dry at first, but keep stirring until the icing sugar is fully combined. Definitely use toothpicks to dunk the balls in the chocolate - stick a pick in each ball before they are refrigerated.  And, you don't need to cover them completely in chocolate - I find that is a bit too rich for most people's taste.  Just dip halfway.
A scrumptious Christmas treat!

I was looking for a recipe to satisy my brother in law's craving for peanut butter balls during a Christmas visit - now we all crave them!  This recipe makes a ton of balls; we doubled it and were a little sorry we had to form and dip them all (almost 200).  A few notes... We ended up mixing the dough in the mixer to incorporate all of the dry ingredients thoroughly.  Rolling wasn't really rolling, more like gently squeezing or they crumbled.  We dipped some in milk chocolate and some in semi-sweet, then settled on a mix of the two.  A great recipe, thank you!

These are WAY too sweet as the recipe is written. I cut the sugar to 2 cups and all I could taste was sugar - I couldn't even taste the peanut butter. I wound up having to melt down another cup of peanut butter and add another few cups of cereal to make them edible. I would never put more than 1 cup of sugar in this.

I just made these and they came out perfect and delicious!  I liked the simple ingredients and didn't want to use shortening like the other recipes called for. For an added touch, I melted Resees chips in a small freezer bag in the microwave and cut the corner to drizzle over the top. I thought mine were pretty average size and I ended up with 60. They looked so professional!

Taking all other reviews into consideration, I came up with a new recipe that is flawless:  

1 C crunchy Jif PB, 1 C creamy Jif PB, 1/2 C butter, 2 C powdered sugar, 3 C rice krispies, 1 package chocolate almond bark

1.  Melt PB and butter.  Pour over rice krispies and powdered sugar.

2.  Keep bowl of cold water handy, and use to keep palms wet.

3.  Roll into 1 inch balls (a 1-inch scoop works well to get the correct amount).

4.  Place on waxed paper lined baking pan/cookie sheet.  Place a toothpick in each ball.

5.  Freeze.

6.  Melt about 4 squares of almond bark.  Remove about 10 balls from freezer, dip in bark, use knife as leverage to remove toothpick, and fill in hole with knife.  Melt more bark as necessary, or remelt existing bark to warm.

If you don't work in small batches, the balls soften, the toothpick falls out, and then the ball is stuck in the bark.

I make this recipe all the time.  Except I use one cup of creamy peanut butter and one cup of crunchy.  I also only use 3 cups of confectioners sugar, And a teaspoon of vanilla.  I don't cook them over a stove.  I soften the butter and blend by hand, much easier sort of like making a meatloaf.
And for the chocolate, I add a 1/4 of a bar of pariffin wax.  And then I top them with a drizzle of white chocolate.  My profile picture is of my Chocolate cover peanut butter balls.  And they are never dry.  I use Peter pan peanut butter as well.

These turned out AMAZING!!  I too cut back on the icing sugar, used crunchy peanut butter, and the holiday Rice Krispies, for a prettier presentation.    When dipping the chocolate, I used both white and semi sweet.  Using a fork and spoon (the ball gets put in the chocolate, scooped out with the fork and spoon the rest of the chocolate).  Give a couple shakes off the side of the bowl, and voila!!  Put them on parchment paper, let them dry and then drizzle more white chocolate on the semi sweet and vice versa.  I have gotten rave reviews on the presentation, and so many requests to make more.

These are so good. Dipped them in chocolate almond bark then melted some white almond bark in a small sandwich bag, snipped a tiny bit off the tip and put fancy little lines across each one. Then set each one in a mini baking cup before giving as gifts. Looks beautiful and tastes even better.

I made these on new years eve with 3 young kids at my side. It was fun, easy, and not very messy (I did the chocolate part).I took the advice of other reviewers and cut down on the sugar and I think that helped a lot. From start to finish they were done in a little over an hour. A few tips - To cool them faster between steps chill in the freezer for 10 min. Also, to keep the peanut butter mix from sticking to your hands when rolling, dip your fingers in a bowl of cold water. Over all a yummy treat!

How do I love these treats? Let me count the ways! First off I will tell you, I am not a huge peanut butter fan...don't hate it, just don't love it. I needed something that seemed fairly simple yet round and "candyish" for the holidays. The holidays passed and I never got them made but a few weeks later, I decided since I had all the ingredients on hand, I would give them a go. 
#1 (as I am counting the ways I love them)they are EASY to make. At first when I was rolling them into balls by hand they (my hands) started to get more and more gooey. I fixed that problem by keeping my hands dusted with powdered sugar.
#2 They LOOK nice and could easily be dressed up even more with sprinkles etc.
#3 They TASTE out of this world....I'm serious, they are SO creamy on the inside they taste worthy of the name "truffle". 
It is not normal for me to get a hankerin for anything peanut buttery but I seriously got hungry for these! Just to get them away from me, I gave the last dozen or so to my dear friend and told her where to find the recipe. A week or so later I spoke with her and she had already made them...TWICE! (she didn't exactly thank me for showing her this new vice!) BEWARE...your greatest dieting weakness will be replaced with these new wonders....before making, consider carefully if you want to do this to yourself and others! AWWWWWW..... GO FOR IT!!!!! You'll thank yourself. Between curses.....you'll thank yourself! ;D

This recipe is delicous!  I tried 3 other horrible peanut butter ball recipes before trying this one.  I did cut back on the sugar and used a bit of shortening in the chocolate to make it go further and simplify the dipping.  I found the recommended method of using the teaspoon the best dipping method.  We will make this a Christmas tradition!

This an excellent recipe. A hundred times better than any using parafin, who wants to eat wax anyway? 
I do however, use a whole cup of peanut better rather than a half cup. And sometimes for a little variety I will dip them in one cup semisweet chocolate chips melted togewther with one cup butterscotch chips... try it... you'll like it!

This is just like the recipe that my friend & co-worker Kelly made long ago, except using only 2 cups of powdered sugar....4 is too much.  The rice crispies add great texture and crunch.  Some use crunchy PB, as well, but I strongly prefer using creamy for these. I make these every Christmas to give as gifts.  I found it too tedious dipping each ball one at a time, so I now line mini muffin tins with the mini liners, put 1 TB of melted chocolate in the bottom of each liner, drop in the ball and cover with more melted chocolate.  You can decorate with Christmas sprinkles or finely chopped peanuts on top before they harden.  They look beautiful & festive, taste delicious, and are very popular with everyone who receives them. They look so cute in the mini muffin liners!  :-)

I followed other's suggestions using a little less conf. sugar. but otherwise followed the recipe. When I was making these, I said to my husband, I will never make these again!  I said that because I found it almost impossible to form the balls it was such a sticky mess and seemed just so time consuming but as others may have mentioned, even just fridgerating the mixture for 15 mins  makes it 100% easier to form the balls.  These are incredibly delicious!  Better than a Reese's cup.  Also, I had trouble dipping in the chocolate using a toothpick or spoon and just ended up using my hands and then it became very easy to get them all covered quickly.

All my friends and family LOVE these balls.  My family is from OH so they call them "buck-eyes".  My baking aunt even asked for the recipe!  I would never use any other recipe.

Excellent and easy recipe. My in-laws remind me months in advance to make these for the Christmas holidays! I used chunky peanut butter for some added flavor and crunch.

My husband thought that these balls should have a little more peanut butter, but other than that he thought they were a cut above the one's his mother used to make (she didn't use rice crispies).  I rolled the balls in melted chocolate almond bark instead of melted chocolate chips. This worked out great; the chocolate hardens and doensn't melt in your hands. In fact, the PB balls kind of resemble candy.  Yumm!

These peanut butter balls are heaven!  Unfortunately, they're so good, they're irresistable.  The crispy texture is a wonderful addition and really compliments and enhances the peanut butter flavor.

Very easy recipe.  Kids will enjoy helping making these.

Note:  I may have measured incorrectly, but there was not quite enough peanut butter mixture to cover the rice crispies/sugar mixture.  You may want to have a bit more peanut butter on hand to add if necessary.

Yum! These delicious morsels are time consuming but oh sooooo decadently addicting! I am a perfectionist at heart (I know this isn't a "healthy" trait, but sometimes I just can't help myself lol!) and the fact that my PB balls look so pitiful will more than likely keep me from making these for anything other than special occasions. I guess I just need to break down and invest in a dipping tool set haha. :) That aside, I think the ratio of PB, sugar and cereal is spot on here. The PB mixture is SUPER easy to work with (at least it was for me), has the right amount of crunch to it and is sweet enough to not rot your teeth. NOTE: To make your chocolate go farther, add 1.5 - 2 T of shortening to it. This thins it out a bit and makes dipping MUCH easier! I'd also like to point out that I was able to make nearly 8 DOZEN balls out of this using my 1 T Pampered Chef cookie scoop!!!!! Obviously, I needed another bag of chips to get the job done, but instead of using chocolate chips (I opted for MILK chocolate for my first 4 dozen), I used WHITE chocolate chips. Because my white chocolate dipped PB balls looked boring (snore, snore), I drizzled them with a touch of melted chocolate. Mmmmmmm.... Thanks for sharing your recipe, Nancy! Since these are usually part of many of my friends and co-workers holiday cookie trays, I think I'll wait until then to indulge. This requires a little too much effort for an everyday treat. :-)

So easy to make but it did take me 3.5 hrs start to finish. I used 1 cup of powdered sugar and that was plenty sweet. I've seen other recipes using graham crackers but I think the rice cereal adds a nice crunch. 

I used 1 bag semisweet choc chips + 1.5 tbs of shortening to get a smoother and thinner chocolate coating otherwise like others said, it would be too thick. You can use Wilton's melting chocolates too.

I only gave these a 4 because is was so hard to dip into chocolate... Midway through I ran out of chocolate and didn't want to run to the store, so I got creative. I took cream cheese cake icing got it very soft and dipped the balls into the icing. This was 10 times easier and they were the first to go... I will be making this again but from here on out it is cream cheese icing for me (as requested)! They are more like 6 star made this way!

I have found that the brand of peanut butter makes big difference in this recipe. Only use Jif or Skippy- generic peanut butter or off brands peanut will cause consistency problems and balls will not hold together enough to dip even when chilled

I knew the combination of these ingredients would appeal to my family's taste however, I wasn't interested in the time consuming task of rolling so many balls. Instead, I halved the recipe, pressed the peanut butter mixture into an 8x8 pan, poured the melted chocolate on top and chilled until firm before cutting into squares. The mixture turned out a little crumbly but I believe this could be solved by using 1/4 cup less powdered sugar. The taste however, is wonderful.

Fantastic!!  Made these this weekend.  Sent some to school with my children and their friends told me how good they were!!  I did add about 1/2 cup of additional peanut butter to make it easier to mix.

way way way too sweet. Cut confectioners sugar in half in order to make palatable for most people. Otherwise only children maybe like it. Suggest  melting chocolate compound for dipping with two forks. Freezing balls for half an hour before dipping makes them set up very quickly.

Super good if you cut the sugar in half and add a liiittle more p.b. and rice crispy cereal. I also add 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and use natural p.b, so I have to add 1/4 tsp salt as well. The chocolate I use is bakers unsweetened dark plus milk choc chips (that are sweetened) and it's a nice balance. I do add a tsp coconut oil to the melting chocolate to thin it just a little. I will make these at Christmas again with my other balls. :) ..I'm sure the kids would like these better than the rum balls accidently bitten into last Christmas lol

I followed the recommendations given by most of the reviews.  18oz container of Jif Crunchy Peanut Butter, and half of the confectioner's sugar, also I did half milk choc and half semi-sweet.  Chilled before rolling and then froze for 2-3 min after adding chocolate.  They turned out excellent, added a little red and green sugar to the top to make them festive.  Tried this with cream cheese frosting as suggested by one reviewer and it was terrible, skip that alternative!

After reading some reviews, I added a little more peanut butter (a whole jar minus a bit that someone used for a sandwich, lol), and cut the sugar in half. I also added the rice crispies to the pot, thinking I was saving my bowl from messy peanut butter, but since the pot was obviously warm the mixture was harder to make into balls. So don't do that. Also, I was worried it needed to be rolled into balls immediately, but my 11 month old son decided to get into a cupboard and grab an opened box of lasagna noodles and they went EVERYWHERE and then he put one in his mouth!! So panicking I run to him to grab it before he breaks off a piece and also picked up the rest, all while my fingers were covered in peanut butter which I was so afraid I would leave behind somewhere and have him eat for the first time. But crisis averted. I then payed attention to him until nap time. When I went back to making balls it was fine, actually easier after they weren't so warm. Using a bowl of water helped to make them less sticky too. When they were in the fridge for a bit I went back to make them a better round shape, and that is currently where I'm at. I hope the chocolate part will go smoothly.. I've never melted chocolate before and don't have a double boiler. I'm planning on using a stainless steel mixing bowl! I'll also wait until my husband is home so I can do it all at once without stopping. I also used toothpicks which I hope will help with the dipping. It made 50 balls exactly. (Weird!)

These were great and semi-easy.  I didnt melt the chocolate correctly so they were a bit lumpy.  I might leave out the rice crispies next time.

Great recipe but needs some changes- I followed others suggestions and used only 1.5 cups of sugar, increased the peanut butter by 1/2 cup and crushed up the crispies- they came out great except I have to find any easier way to "dip" them in the chocolate, it was very messy and thick almost too much chocolate on the balls if thats possible... overall they are very yummy!

The taste of these peanut butter balls is excellent.  My husband will insist on seeing them every year at Christmas. They are easy but rather time consuming to roll and then dip so many balls.  Just a note--I had to use almost twice as much chocolate to cover all the balls.  Maybe because I made my balls on the small side.

Good.  Seemed like there need to be more peanut butter.  Was a little stiff to me.  Definitley use chocolate melts and not chocolate chips.  The chips make the coating too thick and had too much chocolate on them in my opinion.

I wasn't at all impressed.  They were dry, crumbly and way too sweet.  I even used extra peanut butter.  I'm not a beginner so I don't think it's anything I did...but, maybe?  Will not make again.

Good recipe. I chilled the mixture over night and used a cookies scoop the next day to form the balls. I dipped some in semi-sweet and some in milk choc. I pefered the milk choc. I also added about a T. of crisco to the choc. when melting, a t. of veg. oil does the trick too.

WAY TOO MUCH powdered sugar! It needed about half that. The powdered sugar made it hard to make into balls and then they broke apart while I was dipping them so I ran out of chocolate and then used choc. bark instead of choc. chips. They even tasted like they had way too much powdered sugar, and I love the stuff. It seems people are giving recipes good ratings just because they used the same ingredients, but they make it a whole different way. Not the recipe I was looking for I guess.

I made this recipe as is and found it to be dry and hard to work with.  After reading the reviews, I see that many have altered the recipe to add more moisture into the mix.  I wish I would have read these reviews earlier!

This is a great recipe, but I found it had too much sugar in it.  I substituted 2-3 cups of the powdered sugar with 2-3 cups of powdered milk.  It makes it taste sensational and it's much more nutritious, calcium, protein, and yes, less sugar.

I made these to dip into chocolate fondue for a party. My husband said that reeses cups don't compare to these for a peanut butter fix. They were sooo good! They were very sweet and peanut buttery, moist, but not too moist. The crunchy-ness was a nice delicious touch. I will definitely be making these again.

I made this based on the many good reviews, before I realized that by the time people got done with their "modifications," they had a completely different recipe! I made this as-is, and it was so bland I added more peanut butter...still bad. If you want a good recipe like this, try Buckeyes i (delicious!!)

This is a great fool-proof recipe.  I use 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs instead of rice crispy cereal.  The rolling is very time consuming, but well worth it.

I made these balls yesterday and today.  They are fantastic!!  I made smaller balls, which used up more choc. than I had planned.  I had white choc. chips, so melted them and dipped the rest of the balls in the white choc. chips.  They are great, too!!
Thank you for sharing!!

Merry "Messiah"mas!!!

These were great however I did make a few adjustments.  I used 2 1/4 cups PB, 1 1/2 cups semi sweet and 1/2 cup milk chips.  Rather than regular Rice Crispies, I use Kellogg's Chocolate/Vanilla rice crispies.  I also add 2 tablespoons of crisco to the chips.  I added the extra peanut butter because the first time I tried these they seemed a bit too dry.  With just a few tweaks they turned out great...we'll surely keep this recipe in our "favorites book"

These come great. My grandmother used to make them when I was a kid, and this must be the exact recipe because they're as I remembered. The key is the shortening in the chocolate so it coats evenly. Thanks!

I just finished making the peanut butter balls and I am disappointed at how dry they are.  It was difficult to roll the mixture into balls. I haven't even attempted to dip them in the chocolate yet. I am going to try a new batch.  It is necessary to either decrease the amount of sugar or increase the amount of peanut butter. I attempted to put a toothpick in each ball before chilling so the dipping process would be easier; however, the balls cracked and crumbled.

This was a great recipe. I made 3 batches for a cookie exchange. The only think I added was 2 tbs of shortening to the chocolate chips which made the melted chocolate much more easier to work with.

I made these last year as written and felt that they left alot to be desired.  I had a hard time forming the balls because the peanut butter mixture was so dry.  Also, they were too sweet and just didn't have enough peanut butter taste.  

This year, I made a few tweaks to the recipe.  I used natural peanut butter, ony 2 c of sugar and dipped them in Ghiardelli 60% cocao baking chips with just a bit of shortening.  I like them like this so much better!  They are bursting with great peanut butter flavor and are definitely not too sweet.  I also used the idea to dip your hands in water while forming the balls which worked beautifully.  I just kept a bowl of warm water next to me and dipped my hands in it after every other ball.  This also had the effect of making the surface of the balls smoother so they looked prettier when dipped.  I also placed half a cocktail peanut on top of each ball in order to differentiate these from other candy I was making.  It looked so pretty!

I was so excited to make these with all the good reviews and all...and I must say I'm a little dissapointed.  I followed the recipe, but added a 1/2c more peanut butter...and they are STILL not peanut buttery enough!  Next time, I too would cut down on the amount of icing sugar because I can really taste it!  I inserted toothpicks and chilled the balls over night, which made dipping much easier!  The melted chocolate didn't look like there would be enough (I was right), so I just dipped half of each ball in chocolate and dipped half of the chocolate covered balls in crushed peanuts and left half with just plain chocolate.  I'll give them another go with more PB and less icing sugar.

To Die For! I follow the recipe to a "T". BUT-I second the idea of inserting toothpicks prior to letting the balls firm up. That way you can dip them easily without having any crumble. Leave toothpicks in place until they are 100% firm and you're ready to dish them up-that was you'll get just a tiny hole. I also have to wonder if just a tad of parafin wax might help the chocolate along too. I did mine with a double broiler so the chocolate stays smooth but it's still quite thick. I'll be trying it with just a teeny bit of parafin next time to thin the chocolate better. But this recipe, consistency and taste are perfecto!

Here's my alterations: 1 cup pb, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups rice crispies, 1 cup confectioner's sugar.  This proportion seemed really nice.  I also found that that putting the chocolate in my 2-cup pyrex measuring pitcher whatsit and putting it in a large bowl with water from the kettle melted it nicely and kept it that way long enough to work with.  Now the trouble is not getting totally fat on these treats ;).

These were AWESOME!  I used natural peanut butter - 1 c. crunchy & 1 c. creamy.  Per other reviews, I only used 2 c. powdered sugar.  I dipped half iof the balls in 65% cacao chocolate and the other half in melted white chocolate.  Both were excellent, but the white chocolate dipped balls were TO DIE FOR!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Awesome recipe!  My friend and I made these on our Holiday cookie day and they were outstanding!  She has brought some to work and I just overheard one of the ladies saying she was dreaming about them while watching TV last night!  You know they must be good!  We made the first batch with nutty PB, and second with creamy and found that creamy was easier. Truly a keeper!

Very nice recipe. I modified it a little though, didn't add the crispies... and I used 3 cups sugar, 2 1/2 cups of peanut butter... and i didn't have a double boiler, so to melt the chocolate i used small pot, and melted a teaspoon of butter weith 1/4 bar wax and after that melted i put 1 small bag of Milk-chocolate chips in and just stirred on low until all melted and dipped the balls. oh and i put the balls in the freezer over night and after i dipped them in chocolate, Very delicious!

This was the best peanut butter ball recipe I have ever tried. Very light, if mixed well and make sure to let the balls freeze overnight. They will melt in your mouth. I have had several requests for the recipe.

I made these last year and everyone wanted them again this year in their basket! I loved the toothpick idea someone left. I did that this year. I didnt dip mine, I 'painted' them with my small spatula while holding them by the toothpick. They get too much choc on them when dipping. I rather have more peanut butter!! I also mixed with my hands, MUCH easier!

I carried these to our Sunday School class party and I got rave reviews from everybody there.  Needless to say, the peanut butter balls were all gone when the party was over.  I dipped mine in chocolate flavored almond bark that I melted in the microwave.  It is so easy when you use the almond bark.

Not a very talented candy maker here.  The PB mixture seemed a bit crumbly, and I had a hard time forming it into balls, but did it.  PUt the balls in the freezer for about 20 mins before dipping in the chocolate.  Also, I don't have a double boiler, and struggle putting one pot on top of another doing it that way, so I melted the chips in the microwave, along with a little shortning(saw Emiril do that before. lol)  Some of my balls fell apart a little bit while dipping in the chocolate(could be my fault for not letting them firm up longer).  The end result worked out, though.  Not very easy to make(if you're not good with candy).  I will probably make these again around Christmas time.

This was way too crumbly and did not hold together well.  More of a rice krispie ball with peanut butter flavoring.  I was not impressed.

Easy and tasty though I found it made LOTS more than the noted 24 1-inch balls.  More like 48 and I also had to double the amount of melted chocolate in order to cover all those balls.  Mine didn't come out as smooth and pretty as some of the ones shown(maybe that's why some raters add shortening?), but that's most likely due to my lack of technique and they could be prettier with practice.

I wanted to make peanut butter balls that were both gluten-free and without corn additives.  I followed the recipe as written but substituted Kellogg's Gluten Free Rice Crispies and used Kraft All Natural peanut butter.  The result was fantastic.  I used three cups of rice crispies and three cups of icing sugar.  Suggest you keep hands water-wet when rolling balls.  Will definitely make again.

I've never made these before so I decided to try this recipe based off of the ratings. I made it exactly as is in the recipe. I found it to be far too sweet. I couldn't really taste the peanut butter even. I'm wondering if 4 cups of sugar is the norm and they're supposed to be this sweet?
Either way, I did add another cup of peanut butter- still didn't help, in my opinion. Anyways, I can see some who enjoy very rich, sweet desserts loving these- my daughter sure did! For my personal tastes though, they're just way too sweet.

This was a little different from the recapture I usually do, but I have to say I strongly preferred this one while rolling the consistency was great it didn't stick to my hands nor did the peanut butter melt while rolling I'll defiantly use this recipe again

I have been following this recipe for years and years. I found it on Allrecipes and have been making it ever since. People request the recipe each year. It is always a favorite.
I have learned that thoroughly chilling the peanut butter balls before you roll them into the chocolate, is key.I usually chill them over night
to be sure they are set.
Wonderful treat!

I followed the recipe exactly. I found the mix to be a little dry and the balls were falling apart, so after mixing everything, I had to add a little extra melted peanut butter (pb) and then the balls began to stick. Next time, I'll start by following all the other reviews and add extra pb at the beginning, reducing the sugar, and give crunchy pb a try and it'll become a 5 star recipe. They still ended up very yummy, but really, really sweet! Also, it made more like 6 doz.

The recipe was a hit with everyone. No complaints about taste. I would recommend, as some have, to be easy on the confectioners' sugar. The peanut butter is sweet enough with 2-3 cups of sugar.

I don't have any specialized equipment, so I just used a crock pot to melt the chocolate and a fork to pull the balls out. It's definitely an acquired skill. I'd say to bring some extra chocolate chips, just in case, because the two bags that I had never turned out to be enough. And be sure to allot plenty of time to this project, as it took me about an hour just to dip the balls in the chocolate.

Only made 1/2 a batch, and still ended up with 33 balls.  We loved the texture that the rice cereal added.  I did end up using my hands to get the ingredients fully incorporated.  I covered some in white chocolate, which tasted equally good, but did not look as nice.

YUM!  Loved them exactly how the recipe made them.  I melted a little peanut butter with some white almond bark and drizzled it on the top and they looked (and tasted) amazing.  Easy too.

These were very good.  The rice krispies made them less rich (which was a good thing), but we think that the peanut butter balls that are made with graham crackers taste more like peanut butter cup candy.  I will make the other kind in the future.

I lost my regular recipe and tried this one.  I do not like it at all.  The consistency of both the pb mixture and chocolate were difficult to work with.  I will not use this one again.

I took the advice of others and used only 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and I'm glad I did or they would be too sweet! I chilled the dough before rolling into balls and this made them easy to roll. I gave them 4 stars because although they are very tasty, I find it difficult to make these look pretty. This was my first time making these so next time I may try drizzling instead of dipping!

these were wonderful....there wasn't quite enough melted chocolate for all of the peanut butter balls, so I opened another 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips to finish the job...and, btw, 2 cups of choc. chips = one 12 oz bag....also, I didn't have enough crisp rice cereal so I added about 1/2 cup slightly crushed corn flakes instead and it worked out just fine

These were a big hit over the Holidays. I'm sure they'll become a tradition in our family. I melted 2 ounces of paraffin wax (about 1/2 block) then added the chocolate chips. Put a toothpick in each ball & dipped in the chocolate mixture. The paraffin helps the chocolate set up faster. Great recipe!

Used 3C Powdered Sugar, 1/2 crunchy 1/2 smooth and a mix of semi & milk chocolate chips - also chilled the batter overnight before rolling into balls, and then chilled again before dipping in chocolate. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY! Very rich!

Best peanut butter balls I've ever had. I do think that the sugar should be cut back some, not for sweetness but the recipe is very dry and the balls are very hard to mold.  They tend to be pretty crumbly.  It took me a total of three hours to make the full batch... a little excessive for me because I have two kids under two.  I should've cut this batch in 1/2.  Very tasty though!

Made these with Almond Bark instead of the chocolate morsels and they turned out great! Almond Bark doesn't melt as quickly when little hands handle them as the Chocolate morsels do. Great recipe!!

These couldn't be any more wonderful.    Because it is what we had on hand I used half natural peanut butter and half crunchy Jif.  The flavor was just right.   Following a commenter's suggestion I added cereal, but we didn't have rice crispies so I crumbled some frosted flakes and put them in.  Added a nice, sweet crunch.   Finally, husband came home with milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet so the coating was made of those, which may have contributed to their sweet, rich, wonderfulness.    I put a toothpick in each peanut butter ball before the first chill, and then slid it out as I dipped each in a spoonful of melted chocolate.  It made the process much easier.  Finally, I used three bags of chocolate chips - much more than the 2 cups called for in the recipe.    I'll make these every holiday season from now on, for sure.

Yummy!!!!  The rice cereal (instead of gram crackers that i am used to) gives it a nice crunchy texture.  Did use only 2 1/2 - 3 cups powdered sugar and i added a bit extra PB so they were more moist.

These were good! If you chill the batter before you make the balls, they tend to roll a lot easier. I usually make these for the holidays as presents and tend to make large batches. I have found through the years that if I make it a few day project I do not get so ovewhelmed. I like to add a crunch bar or two to my chocolate and I make some with crunchy pb too! graham cracker crumbs instead of rice crispies is prefered by some too!

I've been searching for a recipe like my Grandma's which seems to have been lost. This is the one, they are fantastic! I couldn't stop eating them even before they were dipped in chocolate. One change I did make was I doubled the amount of chocolate chips to cover all the balls. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a huge hit at the bake sale. My mom made these when I was little, they were just the same.  I didn't chill the balls first because I was rushing, but with a spoon and a scooper it worked fine.

When I made these, they did not form into balls.  I checked and the amounts were correct, but I just got crumbles that would not stick together.

A bit too sweet and peanut butter mix was a bit too dry to work with easily.  I would recommend adding less powdered sugar or a bit more peanut butter.

This made 50 balls.  Next time I would cut back on the sugar as others have recommended.  Adding 2 tbsp of shortening to the choclate is very helpful, or using chocolate candy coating works very well too.

These were great!  Very easy and turned out wonderful.  Putting them in the fridge before dipping in chocolate is the key for sure.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Great recipe to make with the kids.  We made a double batch this morning for holiday gifts.  The texture when rolling up the balls was perfect.  I've tried other recipes when it just sticks like crazy to your hands, but this one was very manageable.

One thing I do when making this recipe is melt a little cooking wax in with the chocolate.  It makes the balls shiny and the chocolate stays on better.  They turn out delicious every time!

I make this with only 2 cups of powdered sugar. I press it into a 9 x 13 and then spread the chocolate on the top. I cut it into squares and it's much easier than rolling and dipping all those balls.

The trick to these is to pour the melted peanut butter mixture over the cereal mixture, then combind it by hand. Becareful it is hot! This recipe is exactly like one that my mother has made for years around the holidays. We also use other flavored chips like milk chocolate, butterscotch, white chocolate and my favorite peanut butter. I've been known to decorate with holiday sprinkles or mini choco chips and/or dallops of other melted chips. Oh so good and it makes for a pretty presentation. This is for sure a 5 star recipe, second to none. :o)

Excellent!  Rave reviews from all tasters and many requests for the recipe.  I used three cups sugar instead of four and just drizzled chocolate over them.

I love peanut butter balls.  These treats were really good but I found that the recipe seemed a little heavy on confectioners sugar.  I also had trouble getting these treats to look as pretty as they should, so as a novice baker be prepared for this challenge.

Wonderful!  I used Ghirardelli candy making and dipping bar chocolate to cover the balls instead of the chocolate chips - it gives it that nice glossy look plus it's made for melting and dipping.

I found this to be a great peanut butter ball recipe, however it calls for too much sugar.  We made this with three cups of sugar and it was more than enough.  So, feel free to cut back on the sugar and still have a great recipe.

These are very good.  The second time I made this recipe I added 2 tbsp of shortening to the chocolate when I melted it.  This made the chocolate creamier and easier to work with.  It still sets up well after cooling.  YUMMY!

these were great. I did not cover them all in chocolate, I rolled some in coconut, some in a combination of cocoa powder and icing sugar (which hubby loved) some in just icing sugar and others in melted chocolate and then rolled them in chopped nuts...these are a keeper. I did get 5 dozen but guess I like smaller balls. I doubt these will make it to the freezer for christmas.
Excellent recipe

I followed the advice of some other reviewers...and found an absolute KILLER recipe!  I took 1 cup of crunchy JiF, 1 cup of smooth Jif, 2.5C of powdered sugar, 1t of vanilla, 3 cups of crushed Rice Krispies and 1/2c of softened butter.  I used a baby cookie scoop instead of rolling by hand...less mess
Thanks for sharing!

These are tasty little treats and easy to make. I don't put in the crisp rice cereal though, but i think that tastes better. I wasn't sure, however, if the butter should be melted or soft. I've made this recipe several times, and I found it comes together much better when the butter is melted.

As suggested by others, I reduced the powdered sugar and only used 1 cup of the powdered sugar (4 cups is too much) then I rolled the balls in the powdered sugar, and as for the rest I followed the recipe. These are sinfully good! They taste like crunchy Reese's peanut butter cups. They didn't taste too sweet and they had *just enough* peanut butter flavoring.

These were good but I made a few crucial changes.  The first time I made this recipe, I didn't change a thing and they
came out way too sweet (we couldn't even taste the PB--just sugar!).  So--I added 1/2 c more PB and decreased the powdered sugar to just under 1 cup (instead of 4). Oh- and I used chocolate flavored Almond Bark instead of semisweet chocolate.  I got so many compliments and requests for the recipe.  Thanks for the post Nancy.

I first time I made these they didn't come out so good.  They didn't hold together well.  And the ones that did, I could bearly get my teeth through.  So I thought I try them again but this time, I crushed the rice cereal and used extra peanut butter.  They were unbelievable.

This is the best peanut butter ball recipe out there. Before when I made them without the cereal, they were average, but just by adding the cereal I have been asked more times than I can count for the recipe!! I make them every Christmas!

Delicious and very sweet!  I used a little extra PB to make it easier to combine.  I had never heard of PB Balls before....but people go crazy when I make these things!!

I made peanut butter balls for the first time this year--and my boyfriend absolutely loves these!  I like the Rice Krispies...it gives them added crunch.  I doubled the recipe and used chocolate almond bark to coat and they still tasted great!

So easy and so great.  These taste almost like the candy "whatchamacallit".  It has a wonderful flavor and the rice krispies give it a great texture.  My children ate these before I got to give them as gifts.

These are really time consuming but worth it they taste great. The first batch I made I left them in the frig overnight and the next day they had a bit of an old taste to them. I will be making these again. Kids love to help with these.

They of course taste delicious because peanut butter and chocolate are always great together but this recipe in particular is a little dry. No one that ate them seemed to notice, though, except for me so it might just be my picky critique. They were a big hit either way!

I made these for a company event and everyone raved about them. Followed the recipe exactly and kept them in the fridge for a few hours before dipping. My hubby and kids taste tested them and asked if I could add them to the Christmas baking repertoire. Thumbs up!

Instead of making balls, I rolled mine into tubes with parchment paper and froze them. Then I took the parchment paper off and cut them into bite size pieces, and spread the tops with chocolate.

WAY too much powdered sugar.  We had a hard time rolling them into balls even after adding another half cup of peanut butter and 2T of butter.  The finished product was too powdery and lacked the rich texture I was looking for.

These were delish and the person i made it for absolutely LOVED them!! A stand up mixer would have been a great way to mix the ingredients as it was a little hard with just a wooden spoon. But still loved this dessert!!  It’s a keeper!!

I did half the sugar and they were still plenty sweet. I felt like the mixture was fairly crumbly and needed more butter or peanut butter. I used one whole 16oz jar of PB instead of measuring two cups. I assumed it was the same, but maybe I should have measured? I also needed quite a bit more chocolate to cover them, closer to 16oz. But they are tasty and I love the crunch of the krispies in them! They won’t last long! :)

3 cups of confectionary sugar only.
And use ghirardelli melting chocolate.  
Definitely a keeper in the Christmas collection.

Like others have said, with a full 4 cups of sugar it's simple too sweet. What I do to balance it out is use 1&½ cups powdered sugar and a of cup almond flour. I also replace a ½ cup of regular peanut butter with unsweetened peanut butter and they taste much better now! 

Also a good trick when rolling the mixture into balls; dole out some globs then roll a few at a time with greesed hands, cleaning your hands when they get sticky to help keep the balls together

Simple wonderful treats loved by my nephews.  So easy to make.  You will not be disappointed.  This year I used Almond Butter just because I had it in the cupboards.  It's delicious too.

ONE CHANGE - used only 3 cups of powder sugar vs 4 c.  No reason for all that sugar :)

So good! I converted this to a vegan recipe easily by swapping the butter for vegan margarine and the chocolate chips for milk free chocolate. My guests never knew the difference and gave them rave reviews. Now, my husband requests them for every occasion!

These peanut butter balls are almost perfect! I will be making them this way from now on. I was a little leary about using the rice crispies at first, but they really give the recipe texture and a lighter taste. The only change I would make is the addition of a little more peanut butter as it seemed the final balls rolled didn't have enough.

Delicious yes.......but, oh what a problem I had making them.  I thought forming the balls was very tedious and tiring.  I made them smaller so had quite a large bunch.  Then....trying to get them to look pretty after dipping them in chocolate was a HUGE problem for me.  I said never again will I do this.....no matter how good they taste and they didn't look as pretty as the picture!

Easy to make and delicious!  After melting the chocolate I held a spoon in each hand and easily coated each ball, then dropped them on parchment paper and put them in the fridge to cool then stored them in an airtight container.

Loved them, loved them, loved them! Easy to make and even easier to eat! I used Ghirdelli baking bars instead of chocolate chips for the coating. Next time I'll try reducing the sugar as others have suggested because they were very sweet, but that didn't stop these from being the first dessert to disappear at our New Year's party!

Yummy! Kind of like a crunchy Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. Mixture was very sticky (probably because I reduced sugar to 3 C) so I  kept a  water bowl nearby to rinse finger frequently.  Recipe was still plenty sweet. Dipped only bottom portion of ball in the "Buckeyes" style. 
Will definitely make again.

Decided to try this recipe over the many others to choose from. How can you go wrong with a recipe from a 96 year old?  You can't!  I took these to work and everyone loved them. I really liked the crunch from the rice crispies. Thank you for sharing this recipe:)

Fantastic as is, but I prefer a heavier peanut butter ratio so I cut the powdered sugar down to 3 cups.

A very good recipe, very popular with friends at parties. A couple of suggestions -- We cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups, and it tastes great. The full four cups would make these unbearably sweet. Also added about another half cup of peanut butter, to make up the lost volume. Another thing I've learned is that the peanut butter and cereal mixture is very difficult to work with until it's cooled down quite a bit. Put it in the fridge for a few minutes, and it's much easier to roll into balls. Also a question on the yield -- this says 24 servings. I get 50 to 60 one-inch peanut butter balls out of it, so that probably needs to be corrected. You'll get a lot more out of this than you expect.

I love making these!! If you like butter scotch, try melting 1 package  with a small sliver of paraffin wax. Coat the balls the same as with chocolate.  The wax will help it set and make them shinny.

my family loves these and I had lost my recipe.  I made these exactly like the recipe until the dipping process. My mother in law always used a tablespoon of Crisco and a tiny little chip of paraffin wax in the chocolate. They harden perfectly and have a beautiful little sheen to them. Love these and so easy to make.

There is something wrong with the amount of icing sugar in this recipe. The amount of sugar should be cut in half or even one and half cups.  I was only going to use two cups but then had second thoughts and followed the recipe.  I ended up doubling it minus one cup of rice krispies to get the proportions right.  Needless to say I hope everyone loves these, which I am sure they will.

This recipe was fantastic!! Like other reviewers I did cut the sugar back to 3 cups. Also I used my cookie scoop to scoop the balls onto the cookie sheet and it worked perfectly. Others were complaining about the balls sticking and this did not happen with the cookie scoop.

Fail. Had a giant mess. Balls wouldn't form. Ratios were off or something. Had to add more Rice Krispies, and then still had a mess. Don't recommend this one.

This is a delicious recipe that's a hit in my home! Just a couple small changes: I only put in 2 1/2 cups of the sugar and substituted the rice krispies for crushed golden grahams!! I also may have added a teeny bit more peanut butter because I wanted to empty the jar;) I made these for my office cookie exchange this year because the recipe makes so many! (I made 60 average sized balls).

This recipe needs a lot of work. There is too much sugar and the consistency is very dry. They were very hard to mold into balls because they wouldn't stick together. Will not be making again.

Made this recipe recently and there is definitely wayyy too much sugar!!  I would cut it from 4 cups to 1, and add more peanut butter and butter.  Would also add about half a cup of butter when melting the chocolate chips to thin it out.

The consistency was a little too crunchy from the rice cereal and too squishy soft for my liking, but the taste was SPOT ON! They were rich and peanut buttery, and the thin chocolate coating made them taste just like Reese's PB cups. YUM! Next time, I think I'll stick the cereal in a blender to make it a bit smoother. Still delicious, though!

I made this recipe and gave it to friends and family as part of my Christmas baking.  This is the item that recieved the most compliments and that people asked me for the recipe for.  I don't know if it was my miscalculation because I was baking multiple things at once, but I needed more chocolate to coat the balls.  I recommend having more semi-sweet chocolate on hand just in case.  Like another reviewer, I also needed a bit more of peanut butter and butter mixture in order to mix in all the cereal.

I did enjoy these, however, many people that I served them to did not.

Following other reviews, I cut the sugar back to about 1 1/2 cups and they were still sickly sweet. Adding all that sugar to already sweet peanut butter and covering it in sweet chocolate. I even thinned the chocolate so I could have a thinner coating.

The next time I make these, I will scale the sugar back even further. These certainly have potential to be 5 stars, but the amount of sugar in this recipe is WAY off. I couldn't imagine what it would have been like with the full 4 cups.

We loved these peanut butter balls. My kids made them with my assistant that is how easy they were to make.  Will definately make them again and again.

This recipe was such a disappointment!  I followed the recipe exactly but the balls were very hard to stick together. I did read reviews and add extra peanut butter as suggested. Even after working them into balls as well as possible and putting them in the freezer for a time, they still fell apart when trying to dip them.  It was a gooey mess. This was a total disaster and I will not use this recipe again.

This is my second time making these, they are soooooo goooood! The first time I halfed the recipe because I didn't know what they would turn out like plus I had never made peanut butter balls before (so simple!) but this time I made the whole batch but I used milk chocolate because I don't have semi sweet :S STILL YUMMY!

I followed the video instructions and used an extra 1/4 cup of butter....I used 2cups of chocolate chips and have done half the batch, so need to purchase another bag of chocolate chips.
I think if you had 2 cups of melted chocolate you would have enough... 2 cups of un melted chocolate is not enough for 90 one inch balls.Taste great though!

These were so delicious and decadent!  I like a darker chocolate, so I used half semisweet and half bittersweet chocolate.  Using a high quality chocolate is key.  Based on other comments, I also slightly increased the peanut butter and slightly decreased the sugar.  My husband does not like anything too sugary, and he went crazy over these.  I will definitely be making these again.  Highly recommend!

Delicious! The only problem I ran into was that the chocolate wasn't runny enough to dip the peanut butter balls into so I added a little vegetable shortening. Other than that these were great!

very good, but if you just dip the balls in chocolate the chocolate it way too thick, but if you put zip lock bags over your hands and dip your hands in the chocolate you can roll the balls in your hands and they are covered with much less chocolate and they are not so rich. Only problem is it is very messy.

Was pretty good. at first they tasted great, but after a day or so the filling seemed very dry. way too much powdered sugar. I think next time I will put in less and add more peanut butter. I had to make extra chocolate as well. all in all I certainly didn't mind eating them!

I used a full 18 oz jar of Jif (the only way to go), and later added about two heaping spoonfuls because I had too much powdered sugar. I only used 3 cups P.S., next time I think 2 would be just fine. Used milk chocolate chips, melted w/a little bit of parafin wax. Then w/a fork I "sprayed" some colored (colored w/food coloring paste) white chocolate over my egg shaped balls. They looked like little easter eggs. Turned out great, tasted even better

These were by far the best peanut butter balls I've ever had. Everyone at the party was asking how I made them(even guys!)and couldn't stop eating them! I made them like the recipe said except I didn't heat them both together, I melted the butter first and then poured it into room temp. peanut butter. I used guiradelli semi-sweet choco chips to melt and it hardened fast and easy. Wonderful!

Very good recipe. Followed the recipe as is.  I did have a hard time rolling them. Some of them were not sticky enough to hold the shape. Next time, i will only add 2 cups of the crispie cereal, maybe that will help. Very tastey and will be making again! Thanks for sharing.

Made this today, they turned out pretty good!  Really sweet, but that's how is should be.  I did use semi sweet bakers chocolate & white chocolate to dip them in.  I ran out of both of those & thought that unsweetened bakers chocolate was dark chocolate so I tried several of those in it also & that was Horrible--so bitter!!!  Anyhow I think the white chocolate tasted the best with it-great recipe & will make again!

These were really good! But the dough was really crumbly and I had to use my hands to get it to come together well enough. I also found it hard to dip them, but it was probably just me. Needless to say, they arent beautiful but they tasted good!

Oh wow!  These are awesome!  I did change one thing in the recipe though, but they still came out great!  I only used 2 1/2 cups sugar (which was plenty)instead of the full 4 cups.  My whole family loves them, thank you!

These tasted FAB but beware that it is very dry and you will need to add more peanut butter.  I made them as recipe says and they were so dry I couldn't even form a ball with any of it.  Salvaged it with about a cup more of peanut butter melted with a tablespoon of butter.  In the end they tasted very yummy.

Can't stop eating these!  I only used 2 cups of sugar -plenty sweet.  I may try less next time.  The choc dipping is time consuming, so I think I'll try drizzling it over the top instead.

These are great, but definitely cut back the powdered sugar. They were too crumbly...I would use only 3 cups next time.

YUM, YUM, YUM! I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception: I used Chocolate Almond Bark instead of semi-sweet choco chips. It worked great. They are fabulous and everyone (adults and children) loved them!

The BEST peanut butter ball recipe out there. Just like my dad used to make.  These were moist but not too moist. I got rave reviews from everyone who ate them and many requests for the recipe.  Thank you for posting!

I made these for the first time over the holidays and I don't know how many people have asked me for the recipe since. Make sure when you are rolling the balls to dip your fingers in some extra confectioners sugar to help with the sticking. Can't wait to make them again!

Tasted great! But you need to add shortening to get the chocolate a little shiny. I also melted my chocolate in a water bath so it melted nicely.

This for me was just okay however my family loves it. I think next time I will add maybe 1/2c of peanut butter, the balls to me seemed a little dry.

Wonderful!  For a change instead of the chocolate try almond bark.  I've had many times and I think I like the almond bark even better than chocolate!

WONDERFUL!  The first person I shared them with asked for the recipe!  Made about 70 balls and it took more chocolate than called for to coat them but I did use half milk and half semi-sweet chocolate.  Going to make these for the teachers at daycare and add something festive for color.  GREAT recipe!  Thanks!

Quite a hit...I lowered the icing sugar to 3 1/2 cups and it was still sweet (but good!) and I used about 1/3 cup more peanut butter just so I could empty out the container.  Totally awesome snack!!  Thank you.

I thought this recipe turned out really good, except I used a whole jar of peanut butter instead of just 2 cups. It was tricky to stir, but I got it all blended good enough. Getting the balls to shape into circles was the hardest for me. You defintely have to work fast when using the melted chocolate from the microwave. My family was very happy with the results, even though the presentation wasn't perfect.

ok! im kindof new at this but im going to give it a try! if you are having problems melting the chocolate and it becomes grainy. substitute it with an 8 oz. hershey bar and add a 1/3 of a bar of wax to the mix. the wax helps to harden the choc. to the peanut butter balls. my grandmother taught her grandson well....bless her heart! have fun with this!

This is the same recipe that my mother made when I was a kid. Last year I started the tradition of making them every year but we had lost the recipe during many moves and my mother couldn't remember the details of any of it. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe so I can continue the tradition!!!

Good taste but not as easy as stated.  The peanut butter was sticky and the chocolate process wasn't as easy as some reviewers said.  I probably won't make these again.

This was a bad one for me. First off I made them with the four cups of powdered sugar. The peanut butter wouldnt mix in all the way. Way too much sugar!  Thank god I had enough peanut butter to try them again. I cut the sugar to two and a half cups. It worked better. The chocolate was too thick when I dipped the balls in. It was such a chore, this whole thing and it was messy. Will never make again.

Made way too big a mess for something that turned out ok. I also didn't coat them in chocolate, not really a fan. I kept them in my fridge and they were fun to munch on though

I made these and what a mess they were..I always follow the recipe the first time around and make any changes after, that way I can give an honest review.  First off, there is way too much icing sugar, it was just sitting in the bowl, and I think it could have used more rice krispies..over all, not worth the effort to me, but my husband and daughter enjoyed them

It is a good recipe and people love them. However I had to add more peanut butter to mine, because there wasn't enough liquid in the recipe. Overall, great though.

These weren't as easy as I had hoped. My mom makes Buckeyes around Christmas. I saw this recipe and thought why not. The chocolate didn't look so good on them. But they were still really good. I couldn't keep my husband out of them.

These were GREAT.  I have had them before w/o chocolate, and I didn't have a lot of time, so I just dusted them with powdered sugar.  They were awesome.  It made so many that I took about a dozen to work the next day.  EVERYONE raved.  This is a great party snack or easy desert.

These were pretty good! They soften pretty quick when working into balls, so puting them back in fridge is important! I ended up ditching the spoon and just used my fingers to dip into chocolate. It wasn't easy making a good presentation, but nobody cared!

When my family tried this recipe, it was very dry.  There seemed to be too much sugar as well.  I've made Peanut Butter Balls in the past and my family did not care for these as much as the ones in years past.

These turned out delicious!  Changes: I used extra crunchy peanut butter.  This made the mixture a bit crumbly, so I added about 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter and it was fine after that.  I also did not have any Rice Krispies, so I used crushed Rice Chex.  Turned out great!  I dipped them in milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet, but that's just preference.  I'll definitely be adding this to my holiday recipe collection!

This is the first candy I've ever made, and I found it rather easy to make by the recipe. It is important to let the balls harden well before dipping; I put them in the freezer. I also mixed the milk choco, and it came out well. The rice krispies make the snack a very light treat.

4 cups of powdered sugar?  I never got it all incorporated, and what I did get mixed up, made the dough very crumbly.
I didn't increase my peanut butter, I stuck with the  two cups.  I got about 3 dozen balls made.  They taste good, but they are SWEET.
I don't know if I would make this again.  My entire arm is sore from trying to stir in all the powdered sugar and they take a lllooooonnnnnggggg time to dip.

The peanut butter mixture was too dry and not peanutty enough for us, and I added 3 oz more. Will not make agin, too much work.

This was the recipe I was looking for! They were great! I found the chocolate dipping part a little difficult,but it was worth it in the end.
