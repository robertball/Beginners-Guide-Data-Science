i had to make some major modifications due to what i had on hand, coupled with the fact that my 2 year old would be eating it and she doesn't do well with spice.  i didn't flour the chicken, i just seasoned it heavily with montreal steak seasoning, some onion powder, and a light sprinkling of red pepper flakes, and stir-fried the chicken. I doubled the sauce for a pound of angel hair and used two chicken breasts, and i think that ratio was perfect. the sauce was pretty thin but i actually enjoyed it that way, which is strange for me, as i usually like a creamier sauce, but this was great! i used a brick of colby jack cheese and it was the tiniest bit stringy, but that was probably my fault for shredding the cheese too thick. i also eliminated the jalapeno and doubled the garlic.  the flavor was intense, the sauce was delicious, and somehow managed to coat the pasta very well even though it was thin.  everyone in my family enjoyed this and i will definitely be making it again. yum!!!

If anything, this dish wasn't spicy enough for our tastes.  I made the recipe with it's exact measurements & it came out okay.  Everyone in the house ate it but I would definitely make some small changes next time I prepare it.  I used 1 bell pepper and 1 onion & felt that it was too much for the amount of sauce that the recipe yields.  So next time I will either cut the amount of those two vegetables in half, or double the liquid ingredients in the sauce.  There was so much onion, it was hard to decipher what was onion and what was pasta.  Maybe the ones I used were just too large.  I did take the other reveiwer's advice and make sure all the veggies were chopped and ready to go prior to cooking the pasta and chicken.  Overall, it was good, just going to doctor it up next time to suit our family's tastes.  Thank you for providing a nice change of pace for dinner tonight!

The recipe was pretty good.  You need to have all your chopped vegatables ready prior to starting the recipe....so that the pasta and chicken don't get too cool!  I will definitely make it again, will just be a little more prepared!

Very tasty and good for the whole family.  Because I have some in my family that loves spicy food and some that can't even handle black pepper, I subbed mild green chilies for the jalapenos.  I also skipped the bell pepper, adding a bit more onion instead.  Also, instead of pasta, I put the gravy and chicken over mashed potatoes which turned out very delicious.  The only thing I was a bit disappointed in, was the fact that even after breading my chicken and adding extra spice on top, for some reason, it didn't seep into the meat itself.  Major bummer :(.  Otherwise, all in all, it was very good.

Wow! I just made this for dinner...yummo!! I don't know how anyone could say this is not delicous! I only made a few moderations, because of what I did and didn't have in the house. I did double the sauce and why not?! It is super yummy! I used extra cayenne pepper because my husband loves spicy food and I also used pepper jack cheese since I didn't have jalapeno peppers. I did sub fat free sour cream...it made me feel a little less guilty about such a heavy sauce! Again, WOW!! I loved it!!

Pretty good, the adults liked it...the kids ate it, but didn't want seconds and they're not picky kids, just didn't like the flavor combo here.

This was really really good!  Unfortunately, I did have to change part of it even though I hated to.  I didn't have flour, so instead of coating the chicken, I flavoured the oil in the pan with salt, pepper, and cayenne, which worked fine.  Once the sauce was finished (had to use a little corn starch to thicken), I put my cooked linguini in the pan with the sauce and coated it.  I only cook for two so there was a little left over, but my bf took that for lunch the next day and said it was even better.  Good man :)  When I make it again (and again, and again and...) I think I might try chopped mushrooms in it too.

Excellent recipe!  I made this with yogurt instead of sour cream and used it without the pasta.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was good, my 9 yr old really liked it. I used already cooked chicken instead of coating with flour and frying.

Not as much flavor as I was expecting.  I did double the sauce as others recommended.  This was ok, but I'm not sure that I'll make it again.

For as much prep and spice this dish offered, it came out surprisingly bland to my tastes (my boyfriend liked it a lot but he also doesn't like spicy foods). I think the cheese could be doubled, with more jalapeno and cayenne pepper. Overall, ok dish, but there could be a lot more zest.

my husband and i liked this but it was a little too spicy for the kids (who actually do okay with many spicy things). for those that don't want as much spice, best thing is to reduce cayenne pepper when cooking chicken

Not great for the cholesterol or the waistline, but sure is good. Took others suggestion & doubled the sauce. Don't let the calories & fat content stop you from trying this - will make again, just not to often.

This was very good.  I doubled the broth, milk, sour cream, and cheese and had plenty of sauce for the pasta.  I also used green chiles instead of jalapenoes and it was still very spicy.  We will definitely have this again.

Mine was too spicy! I think reducing the amount of cayenne pepper on the chicken or omitting it altogether would have been better. Took a while to prepare, and I even used a chopper for the peppers and onions.
