Moist cake that would benefit from the addition of raisins or dates and some more spices, like cinnamon and cloves.  If you want to really "frost" the cake with the suggested frosting, you need to prepare it while the cake is baking and then chill it to thicken it up.  You really need to be careful to prepare the pan or it will stick.  For those who really must be strict about their diets, this isn't a bad option.  It isn't flat and tasteless as so many are and it doesn't call for odd or difficult to find ingredients.  I will try it again.

I used this cake for my son's first birthday party.  He loved it as did the rest of our guests.  I added a bit more juice concentrate to the frosting to give it more flavor.  You also have to make sure the top layer of frosting is thick enough because when it sits for a bit, the cake looks spotty in areas that have little icing.  The hardest part was not tearing the cake when trying to put the two halves back together.  I found that you could substitute any unsweetened fruit juice concentrate if you happen to be out of apple.

I followed this recipe to the exact, and I tell ya, I feel like I wasted a lot of money making this cake. It has no flavor at all, Im always looking and trying new recipes to make for my mom that is sugar free. I actually throwed it out. It was that bad. It really needs some other flavors in it.

I love sweet stuff, and this satisfied my sweettooth. I am a swimmer, and before big swim meets I try to reduce the amount of suger I eat. My brother opted out of eating any, and my sister tried it and hated it. My parents both loved it though. I would recommend this recipe to everyone. And if you need to add a little bit of sugar. I didn't and it still tasted great! Also, don;'t use too much frosting on the inside, because if its too thin on the top, it will look like its green and moldy:-)

A very healthy cake. Is a bit plain though. I recommend getting cream cheese frosting from a can to even out the healthfulness of the cake. Still healthy!! :)

The cake was yummy and moist. Perfect for us sugar-concious! I used a mixture of millet, spelt, and barley flour instead. -- I would recommend doubling the frosting recipe. I too had issues with not enough coverage (and it does look like mold!)

I and my kids are pretty finicky, so I'm not quite sure why this recipe is getting a bad rap!  After reading the reviews, I still wanted to try it, since one of my kiddos displays auspergers-like symptoms when he's on sugar but still deserves to have cake every now and then.  I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 2 tsps of vanilla since people complained of blandness. Still, I was skeptical, but it was wonderful to me... and more importantly, to my kids (one is having a piece with her breakfast right now)! Maybe it's just because we've been off of sugars and artificial sweeteners for a while now... but I don't think so. We're typically a pretty hard win! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I followed the recipe to the letter and this cake was very bland.  I may as well have been chewing on my dishtowel.  The icing is definite keeper though.

This cake turned out great. I did make double the recipe for the icing and added cinnamon nutmeg and vanilla for more flavor. I will bake it again.

It has a great texture, I used a different frost. I also substituted all applesauce for the frozen concentrate and omitted the apple chunks and almond, making this a good general cake base for adding seasonal fruits and other no-sucrose flavorings.  I expect that with these modifications I'll be using it on special occasions pretty much constantly in future.
