I hoping this would be more like what we found in Spain but it was nothing like it.  Also, It never dried out and after 2 days, I had to heat it up. I thought "YUCK, I should just throw it all out" but after heating it, it firmed up and was ok.

All Nougat has uncooked eggs in it.  I ate a lot of it and never got sick.  All in all it is a very good recipe that you definately try.

I had no luck with this recipe at all. Not only did it never set up, the ingredients separated as well.

I was so disappointed. It never set/hardened.  I come to figure out there are ingrediants missing after the fact.  I compared to other recipes and this one is forgetting the sugar.  Expensive lesson since I made a large batch.  This honey is not cheap.

This recipe is for Turrón Jijone. This is a SOFT nougat. This *never* gets hard because it is not supposed to. The hard/firm nougat is Turrón Alicante. Reviewers here have confused the two and the two are quite different.

It did not work at all. I followed the recipe exactly and the ingredients completely separated. I should have listened to the other reviews. The ingredients are expensive.
