It tastes like a mix between French and Thousand Island with a litte extra zing.

Ooh, yummy. I was skeptical when I first saw the ingredients, but I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to try it as an "experiment". It makes exactly a quart so I just poured it right into a clean mayonnaise jar for easy storage. I'll make this again!!

Wow this was really good and very, very simple to make.  I made it when my family was visiting and I thought my brother was going to make himself sick eating so much.  LOL!  Thanks for sharing it with us.

I made this and the first taste all I could taste was the mayo. Next time, I would cut that back. Other than that, we spiced it up a bit with crushed red pepper and it tasted fine. Overall, it was ok.

Tasty!  I like that it tastes unique and not exactly like any other dressing.  I used only 1/3 cup mayo and and still find it a tad too mayo-ey.  

Next time I'll try to half this recipe, as we'll never eat 3 cups of dressing. :)

Had to make a few changes, since there are only 2 of us.  I replaced the soup with about 1/4 Cup of kethcup, since I didn't want a open can of soup.  I used sour cream instead of mayo and added more hot sauce.  It was really good and we thought it would make a great condiment for french fries or even on a burger.

This I give a 4 1/2, actually. Easy & tasty, with no chopping! Just dump in the blender & whirl! The whole family likes it.

Pretty good salad dressing--we love salads & love most any kind of dressing, but I'm always on the hunt for a new one to try. We thought the proportions of mayo, vinegar etc. were just right.

This salad dressing is amazing.  It tastes like a cross between 1000 island and french.  I am very skeptical when a recipe calls for canned tomato soup because it always has a can taste.  Made this yesterday as written except used just under 1/2 cup light "real" mayo.  There is no fooling, this makes a lot of great dressing.  Not too tangy and not too sweet!

Very good.  Great blend of seasonings and you'd never know there was tomato soup in the recipe.  Makes a lot, but stores in the refrigerator for a long time.

Wow, what a unique dressing! I had to hide the ingredients from my family though or they wouldn't have eaten it..."tomato soup? Ewww"... I just eyeballed the spices and tweaked until I got it just right. Makes a ton too! Thanks!

I love this dressing, but prefer it with amount of ketchup rather than the tomato soup.  Equal amount ketchep, mayo and oil.

Very Good! I had three helpings last night with dinner and one for mid morning snack, one for afternoon snack.  My daughter who wont eat Salads ate two helpings. So good I had one bite left and when asked by my three year old I quickly stuffed my mouth and told her sorry it was all gone.... I also only added 1/2 cup of Mayo and it was perfect.

I love this recipe, however I simply omit the mayo (I am not a fan).  More tang and less calories. I also use granulated garlic and onion instead of the salted varieties. Add a little parsley and some green onion (scallion) for brightness.

I just made this but, without the red wine vinegar and hot sauce. It is perfect!! It seems to be a recipe than will work with a lot of dishes. I am thinking of using it as a dressing for a sandwich.

I loved this recipe. Used canola oil and left out the hot pepper sauce. Was really good the second day. Hubby liked it too and he doesn't like tomato soup. He never even knew.
