First off, I did not have the whole chicken on hand, but the recipe sounded great and I didn't want to wait.  So used five bone-in, skin-one chicken thighs that I had on hand.  Three of five family members liked it.  I enjoyed the dish as it made ordinarily bland chicken more interesting with a nice mediterranean twist.

I have made this twice, almost following the recipe exactly, tweaks were due to available ingredients (first time my husband accidentally threw away lemon juice trying to help tidy, second time I had no fresh oregano/Rosemary to hand, so used fresh sage because it was in house). I did put 1/4 onion and 1/2 of squeezed lemon in body cavity. Fabulous recipe we'll make again and again.

This was an easy recipe and turned out pretty good!  I loved the feta/garlic flavor with the chicken.

I think I used too much garlic, and my feta was not really strong enough, but all in all very good chicken

I will definitely make this again. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I used dried thyme (vs. fresh oregano) in the cavity with fresh rosemary. My hungry guys ate the chicken before I could make the sauce, so will save it for another day.

luscious. I used an eight pound bird, added 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme and 1/4 cup full fat cream cheese to the cheese mixture, inserted under the skin and allowed the skin to dry uncovered overnight to crisp it. Served with traditional Greek salad and potatoes for an excellent Sunday roast.

Made this “beer can chicken” style on a Big Green Egg”. Filled the recipe for the prep then grilled as usual on the Egg. The family loved it!

My husband and son said this was the best roast chicken I’ve ever made!  It was so moist and full of flavor.  Served with green beans, roasted rosemary potatoes and salad.  Couldn’t be easier.

Chef John,  here are two thoughts. First, what about a mixture of cream cheese and the dried feta?  I think that would improve the texture and appearance of the cheese.. Secondly, regarding the off color from the  cooked cheese and fresh herbs,  perhaps using dried herbs might improve the appearance, although I still prefer the fresh rosemary over dried.  Furthermore, perhaps finely diced dried tomatoes that are soaked in olive oil may add another contrasting color that improves that appearance and add more flavor to that filling under the skin.   What do you think?  Cheers, very good tasting chicken.

I made this tonight and it was delicious. I did not change a thing! I served it with a cauliflower riced risotto with asparagus and mushrooms instead of pasta or a potato. A big hit. Thank you Chef John.

Super easy and super delicious.  I took Chef John’s advice and used a creamy feta.  Made alongside  oven roasted potatoes— Chef John’s recipe for (Greek Lemon Chicken and Potatoes).  The leftovers were just as good, using the leftover potatoes as home fries alongside a feta omelette.  Thanks, Chef John!
