Wow!  Made this for dinner tonight.  Absolutely deliciious.  Added a few bread crumbs on top and broiled until browned.

I had some cooked jumbo shrimp that I had to use up and this worked out perfect.  I actually marinated them in the frig overnight.  I also sprinkled them with some fresh bread crumbs and freshly grated parm before putting in the oven.  Instead of the bread, I served over rice pilaf with some fresh tomato chopped in it.  Yummy.

Made it exactly as directed, and I found it far too lemony for my liking. I prefer scampi with more of a butter-garlic taste, like my old recipe has. My daughter forced herself to eat it, I think because of the effort I put into it, but it's not something I would recommend, nor will I make it again. Sorry, but it's nowhere near a 5-star flavor.

Have been making this for a few years now excellent. I do not make it with the garlic toast , but I do add more garlic to it and serve it with rice
