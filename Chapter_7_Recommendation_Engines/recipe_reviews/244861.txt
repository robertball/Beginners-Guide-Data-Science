I made small changes. I used flour tortillas for one batch and corn for another. I used red enchilada sauce for the flour tortilla recipe and green enchilada sauce for corn tortillas.

I made this with home made enchilada sauce, and it was a huge hit. We used whole wheat tortillas and sharp old cheddar, which added some punch to the flavour profile.  I also increased the spices to our taste.  Otherwise this one is a real winner as is. My husband can't stop talking about it. Good thing I made the whole recipe as there's enough for three meals for us.  Thanks for posting this simple but satisfying recipe.
