Okay, let me first say that I was skeptical about this recipe-- especially about the puree part, since I'm used to chunky chicken salad. I also thought there wouldn't be enough dressing for the amount of chicken, but I was very wrong on both counts. I boiled the breasts for about 20 minutes to cook, and combined Miracle Whip with T. Marzetti's original slaw dressing. I added the onions and celery, then shredded the cooked breasts and added those. I didn't feel like it needed salt or pepper, so I threw everything into the food processor, chopped it up, and ended up with a baby food-type mush with a slight crunch. I put together 5 sandwiches, threw them in a cooler for a road-trip my boyfriend and I were taking, and all five were gone within an hour. They were so easy and so delicious, and I will never buy chicken salad again. I didn't even need to tweak anything! Throw away your skepticisms and try this recipe-- it's perfect as is.

This IS really delicious!!!  I'm a big Miracle Whip fan so I liked the fact that this calls for salad dressing which is why I gave it a try.  I have never tried cole slaw dressing and didn't even know they made such an item but I found it in my local shoprite.  It added a wonderful flavor!!  As another reviewer, I did not "puree" this in a food processor but left it chunky.  Yummy recipe!  Thanks!

I love this basic recipe. Do yourself a favor and make the coleslaw dressing...http://salad.allrecipes.com/AZ/ClSlwDrssing.asp, I used Vegenaise (just like mayonnaise) in place of the creamy dressing, added a 1/2 cup of cashews. I fifn't use a food processor because I think it breaks it down too much, just diced into small pieces. This can also be made into a delicious sandwich by adding bacon strips, sliced avocado and provolone or swiss cheese. We couldn't stop eating it!

This is a great easy recipe.  So great in fact I made it 3 days in a row.  (I liked it).  Good on toast and on soft bread.  Must add on to my review.  I have made this so many times since I first reviewed.  I use a pineapple coleslaw dressing called Jimmy's.  It is awesome.  I also recommend serving on croisants as well.  I did that for a bridal shower.  Everyone raved.

This is indeed the best chicken salad I've ever made.  I served this at my son's birthday party.  The kids actually ate it.  Many parents have since asked for the recipe.

Excellent chicken salad...has a great texture and a sweet-tangy flavor.  I've made it using low fat salad dressing and cole slaw dressing, and it's wonderful!  Highly recommend!

This is very good. I used mayonaise and the coleslaw dressing.  I like that I can process it to what ever consistency I like. I have made this several times and it's a keeper.

I have been playing around with my chicken salad recipe for years.  So, with a bit of skepticism, I tried this recipe.  All I can say is...it WORKS!  Absolutely delicious!  I recommend that anybody who comes across this try it just once, you'll be hooked.  No changes made at all, but I think I agree with the person who said the onion was just a tad much.  I think next time I make it (and there will be a next time), I'll decrease the onion a little.  Superb!

Update:  I made this recipe again, and used 1/2 tsp onion powder as opposed to the 1/4 onion.  The overpowering onion taste was gone, and the powder added just enough flavor.  Hubby LOVES this!

I thought 'coleslaw dressing' a strange ingredient, but it added just the right tang. I left it chunky, as my family loves the texture.  I also added chopped cashews and served on croissants.  Delicious.  Even my kids loved it.

Very good recipie, I butchered a rotisserie chicken instead of two chicken breasts, mostly because I'm lazy, then I added chopped almonds/pecans and dried cranberries.  Pretty much the best thing ever, never buying store bought again.

This could have been very good, but the onion was overwhelming and I like onion! Use much less and add some walnuts or pecans and red grapes.

Great chicken salad and very easy/quick to make! I reduced the coleslaw dressing to 3 TBLS and used more celery. It doesn't make alot but that's good if your makeing a lunch for you and a few others. Would make this again Richard!

I know this  recipe was posted long ago on this site--but I started making it last year & fell in love with it. I don't even measure ingrediants anymore--just put amounts in as I see fit. I do not "puree" it all- I leave it kinda chunky  (but not too) I just love the flavors and eat it in sandwiches, on top of crackers or lettuce.. Any Way Is Good : D Thanks so much for sharing (ps-you can even throw a few raisins or even pineapple pieces in for a change of pace & still it is great ! )

I was pleasantly surprised by this. So easy and very tasty. I suppose it's the salad dressing/cole slaw dressing instead of mayo made a big difference. I chopped the celery very tiny b/c I'm not a huge fan of chunks of celery - but I like the flavor it adds. This will be my standard chicken salad recipe from now on.

This is nice!  Made it with red onions and a mix of mayo and ranch for the dressing.  The chicken I grilled on the George Foreman grill before cutting it up into big chunks for the Food Processor.

I doubled the dressing like many people advised and that was good advice.  The only thing I'd do differently is not put the food in the processor in the order it's listed but put the vegies in first and give it a spin in the processor before putting the chicken and dressing in.  This way the chunks of onions and celery will hopefully be a little more even.

Note: Not a cheap dish.  Chicken breast package was $9 and the store bought Hidden Valley Cole Slaw dressing was 3.89.

This is one of the best recipes here on AR!!  We loved the mildness and the texture was just perfect.  I've only ever made chunky chicken salad but this is now my go-to.  I didn't use Miracle Whip but just regular Kraft mayo.  I used the Kraft cole slaw dressing and it added just the right (tiniest) amount of sweet that we really enjoyed.  Thanks, Richard, for this great, easy little recipe.

I made this for a family party and several people ask for the recipe. I used the food processer for some of the chicken and all of the other ingredients. I cut the remaining chicken in chunks, so the chicken salad would have more texture. Great Recipe...

This recipe has a really good taste. It was a little tangy for m so next time I wont add as much cole slaw dresing. I also added some apple pieces and grapes for more of a crunch. Like some of the others I did not put this in a processor as I like chuncky chicken salad.  All in all this is a great chicken salad recipe. Thank you for sharing

I've tried more than a dozen different recipes for Chicken Salad, looking for one as good as sold by a local market and now thanks to you, Richard, I've found the ONE! 
I used 1/2 (left side + right side = 1 whole breast) of a large chicken breast from a Sam's Club rotisserie chicken and 1/4 teaspoon of Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up salt (Original) and chopped up everything by hand using my ninja knife skills. Oh, I used Miracle Whip and Marzetti's Slaw Dressing. Everything else was as you posted. This was wicked good. Thanks for posting this!

I made this for a Christmas cocktail party and it was a big hit! I used rotisserie chicken breast meat from Costco and it was perfect. Served on toasted corn cups made by cutting 3-inch rounds from corn tortillas with a biscuit cutter, brushing with olive oil and baking inside mini-muffin pans. Also great on croissants!

So easy!  I leave out the celery and onion for personal preference.  I use 2 large cans of chicken breast and mix with Miracle Whip and Marie's cole slaw dressing.  Just mash everything together.  Sometimes add a bit of salt or garlic salt.    I keep the dressings in the fridge here at work and stock up on the canned chicken breast.  I can keep it in the workroom or even in my desk.   That way the ingredients are always on hand.

This is the 1st thing I have rated so far but I felt like I should give this 5 stars. I'll be having it often. My husband & 3 year old son enjoyed it as well. I didn't use a food processor. I cooked the chicken and then shredded it by hand. I added everything else after that. I just prefer mine chunky. I used Miracle Whip as the salad dressing (: I didn't add any salt & pepper, but only because I'm trying to cut back. All of the flavors went together perfectly and I didn't have to change any of the portions. I highly recommend.

All I can say is YUM!  I used mayonnaise because I don't like salad dressing.  Otherwise, I made exactly as the recipe states.  Will make this again and again.
Thank you, Richard.

Came out sweet and tangy with a great consistency.  Perfect for tea sandwiches or on crackers. This chicken salad begs to be served with fruit in my opinion.    I usually make a chunky salad, but preferred this, hands down.  Used left over grilled chicken and added one green onion and some garlic powder.  Didn't need s&p.     (I didn't have coleslaw dressing so I used equal parts olive oil, red wine vinegar and sugar and emulsified it in the food processor before I added the other ingredients.  Next time I will reduce the vinegar to suit my taste, but it worked, and my family loved it.)

I'm only giving this 4 stars because the title is so deceiving; it is NOT the "best chicken salad ever" and in fact, it's really not even a chicken "salad" but more of a dip or a spread. However, I did quite enjoy the flavor but was a bit disappointed in the texture. Be sure to use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise because it pairs so well with the cole slaw dressing.

Muy delicioso!!!! One of the appetizers - served in little sandwiches - for my parents 30th anniversary/renewal of vows. That was several weeks ago and people are still asking for the recipie! Since I had so much chicken I just added the ingredients to taste. I also used red onions which I love. Add more of the wet ingredients (dressings) if making sandwiches! Enjoy!

This was just OK. It got better as it sat in the refrigerator, but have had better chicken salads, so don't think I will make it again.

I made this for a large family gathering. I didn't have the coleslaw dressing, so I left it out and added a chopped up boiled egg. I also used Dukes mayo. My family thought it was the greatest, especially my dad, who is a very picky eater. They have been talking about it ever since!

5 stars and true to its name.  I made this for a Bridal shower and had NO leftovers.  My family loves it, too.  I make this with Miracle Whip and T. Mazerettis Coleslaw Dressing.    I use the food processor for finger sandwiches (spreads beautifully), but I coarsly chop the chicken with a knife for a family lunch.

This recipe is very good.  Took suggestions made as is but added pickles and cilantro. Made finger sandwiches out of wheat bread (cuts better than white)  and made "Cajun Appetizer Meatballs"  off this site.  Made as is.  Maybe a little less on the cajun seasoning.  Took both of these to my Texas Holdem Poker nite Everyone loved both Recipes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe I made extra meatballs and saved and putting regular gravy over them tonite with mashed potatoes.  I know that will be good also.

This is going to be a great recipe to use this Summer, now that the weather's getting warmer. I used dill relish in place of the celery. I also think next time, I'll use a few dashes of onion powder instead of chopping up the onion.  Also, instead of using a food processor, I stirred it all up in a bowl and that worked just fine.

My package had 6 chicken breasts so I tripled the recipe, making 1 batch at a time.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, thought it had a bit too much onion for me wanted a chunkier recipe.  I made the dressing only for the second batch - omitting the onion but adding a jalapeno and 3T fresh parsley then added the chicken chunks after the dressing was blended.  For the third batch I made the dressing with a lesser amount of onion and added chicken chunks after blending. I tossed all three batches together and aside from having a green chicken salad (due to the parsley) it was perfect.  This recipe makes a very good chicken salad that lends itself to personalizing to taste preferences.  Absolutely a keeper!

Chicken salad is one of my favorite dishes ever...thus I am very picky with my recipe choices.  This recipe was AWESOME!!!!!  It is the perfect combination of flavors.  If you are from the southeast, I recommend "Jane's crazy mixed up salt" if you can get it at your store.  Adds a few more very slight spices such as garlic, oregano, etc.  It was good just with regular salt though.  Thanks - great find!

This was a good chicken salad recipe.  It's my first try.  I used a pretty strong coleslaw dressing, and that was what I tasted most, but it has a lot more potential.  Next time, I'll use less dressing, or maybe a milder one.

Fabulous!  Add lots of chopped pecans, plus tarragon and parsley (use dried if fresh not available).  More celery and use red onion if possible.  Increase dressing by 1/2, which means 6T Miracle Whip and 6T Cole Slaw Dressing.  I only  used the food processor for the chicken, which gave it a wonderful texture (don't overdo it).  My chicken was a 16 oz pkg of Costco Foster Farms Grilled Chicken Breast Strips.

Yum yum yum.  I used some ranch creamy dressing and homemade slaw.  I get a kick out of people who don't read right.  It does not say to puree in food processor.  Says to chop.  I just hand chopped all and it turned out wonderful.  Great on some multi grain bread!

Had this last nite with greens. Used leftover roasted chicken, and since wife isn't a fan of onions, I sprinkled Mrs. Dash's Onion & Herbs on it...she loved it..and so did I. Definitely a good way to use up leftover cooked chicken. Didn't 'puree' it but may blend the left over for sandwiches

Wow, this is good!! I made a homemade coleslaw dressing with Miracle Whip, sugar, vinegar and vegetable oil. Then I mixed that with mayonnaise for the sauce. I added some almonds and fresh green onions from the garden. It's even good with canned chicken and I hate canned chicken! I can't stop eating it!

Finally, a chicken salad recipe without fruit and nuts. I used the moist meat from a fresh rotisserie chicken for this. Instead of a food processor, I hand-chopped the chicken, onions, and celery so it would have a chunkier texture. Our local Piggly Wiggly deli makes a fantastic chicken salad, and they told me it was made with slaw dressing and Miracle Whip, but I didn't know the proportions. THIS is the recipe, and I'm glad Richard posted it. It's fantastic.

I thought this was just ok---I did not like the miracle whip as much as I like Mayo with this.  I made many changes for our tastes:  I always poach the chicken breats and add celery--1-2 stalks, 1/4 of a large onion and slivered toasted almonds.  I just toast them in the oven on a cookie sheet. Keep them in the freezer and it takes about 12 minutes until they are toasty on 350.  Since I didn't like the taste with the miracle whip I added 1 tblsp home-made curry powder and a couple of tblsp mayo.  Hubby loved it this way on toasted Oregon Herb bread with lettuce.

Great recipe. I also added a few seasonings...dill,parsley,dried red peppers,salt & pepper. I used about 1/2 dried minced onion & the other 1/2 green onion. Also added some pecans...it was great. Used it at a baby shower on croissants & got raves! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe! A great replica for the chicken salad my grandmother made so long ago. My picky sister in law raved about it , my kids, niece and bible study famlily ate all of it. Initally I Made it with can chicken, but today is my sisters birthday and I'm making it with the boneless breasts. Didn't change anything else. Thanks a million!!!!!

The name does not lie...this is the BEST Chicken Salad I have ever had.  I threw a baby shower and tripled the recipe, you should of heard the compliments, they didn't stop.  All of it disappeared quick.  This is definitely a recipe i plan on keeping forever. Thanks!

I'm not fond of fruit in my chicken salad, so I found this a great basic recipe. I poached the chicken breasts in water with a couple of chicken boullion cubes. I used mayo rather than the salad dressing, but I did add the coleslaw dressing, which gave a nice hint of sweetness. I also added a handful of pecans. This made wonderful sandwiches on croissants with just lettuce.

Flavor was good with coleslaw dressing but I prefer mine a little "chunkier" and food processor makes it too mushy.  Doesn't take that much longer to chop ingredients and mix by hand...then it's a 5*****.

This is an excellent recipe! Very simple, but wonderful. I made dollar sandwiches, by spooning the salad into small puff pastry shells I had made. Very pretty and tasy for a party appetizer.

This is good but sweeter than I anticipated. I subbed onion powder and celery seed  and added chopped dill pickle for crunch since kids wont eat fresh onion/celery. Also some left over shredded cheddar I had on hand. Served on open face toasted bread. Yummy. Did not use processor.

WOW, I'M IMPRESSED WITH MYSELF (LOL) ... we just ate a fantastic chicken salad sandwich made with this recipe and my husband was soo surprised BECAUSE none before had tasted this good!! The only thing that i did differently was i chopped my chicken in small pieces and only did the onion & celery in the food chopper...  then i blended ALL ingredients together in a mixing bowl... this gave it a nice bite and it was still quite creamy & spreadable.  I REALLY think the salad dressing + cole slaw dressing (i used miracle whip + marzetti) is THE secret key to the flavor. Be sure and use both even if you tweak something else!! Soo yummy & soo much better than ANY store bought EVER!!

I used canned chunk chicken breast and the consistency with the chicken was almost intolerable.  I did add grated cheese and shredded lettuce and made a wrap from it.

This is very good chicken salad. I used a few green onions for the onion, and poached the chicken breasts with a bit of sage in the water. I'm not sure why some reviews mentioned being leery about pureeing, because the directions say to chop, not puree. I will use this recipe from now on.

This was great!! I had a lot of chicken left over from a dinner and wasn't in the mood for soup... So I tried this. It was delicious! Really close to willow tree's version! I didn't spin the celery in my food processor (my bf likes the "crunch") but I did the onions and chicken. Not quite to a "paste" I kept it sort of chunky. Then added that to the celery in a separate bowl and mixed in the coleslaw dressing and mayo.

This is a great chicken salad recipe. Like others, I did not know they made cole slaw dressing but it really makes a difference... I made it for lunch the next day and I could not stop eating it and was too full for dinner.

This is excellent! I have been making this all summer and it is the best! I throw an extra two marintated breasts (any flavor marinade works) on the grill at dinner to use the next day for this recipe. It's easy and adds a bit deeper flavor. P.S. I tried it in the processor but prefer it shredded or finely chopped; just a texture thing to me as the flavor is wonderful either way..

i used half my boiled chicken to make enchiladas and wanted something super easy for the rest of the chicken.  Wow, what a find!  Realized too late I didn't have the cole slaw dressing on hand - subbed Drew's All Natural Dressing & Quick Noodle Sauce, Lemon Goddess Tahini flavor (in store with the organic items.)  Amazing.  Looks like baby food; tastes like heaven.  This is my new Chicken Salad receipe - no more eggs or fruit or nuts or chow mein noodles...  Yippee!!!

My first chicken salad attempt... turned out well. I think it needed salt. Used the store bought dressing that starts with a "m" and has a "z" in it lol. Will look for ways to enhance this pretty tasty recipe. Made with Roast Sticky Chicken and French Rolls to Die For, from this site

So, I made this salad both ways before rating this recipe.  It's a very good simple chicken salad, and I will make it again.  I liked it better with the chicken in chunks and the onion and celery just diced, but it wasn't "the Best".  It did introduce me to Marzetti's Cole Slaw dressing, which was great!!  Since I had the big jar, I added some of it to some egg salad that I made for sandwiches, and that was great!!

Tried the recipe as listed and served it on onion rolls. While everyone liked it, it was a bit bland for my taste. Next batch I added a whole jalepeno pepper, tbsp of fresh cilantro, and two tbsps of course ground mustard. Served on a jalepeno cheese roll it is excellent. This is a great recipe that allows for a good deal of improvisation depending on ones tastes.

I have always bought chicken salad sandwiches never thinking that I could make one myself. This is fabulous. My daughter couldn't stop eating it right from the bowl.I think using boneless skinless chicken breasts roasted for about 40 min. in the oven is much tastier than any tinned chicken could ever be. I make this at least once a week,

This is a big hit at our house. I like chicken salad with grapes in it -- you can do that to the finished recipe. I also like sliced green olives (but not with grapes!) -- you can do that to this finished recipe. My husband was skeptical but ate it all and then wanted me to make another batch right away!

This "IS" the best chicken salad ever!  So much flavor from the cole slaw dressing that I don't feel compelled to add grapes, nuts, or apples as I usually do.  I will use this a lot!

This was delicious!  The cole slaw dressing gave it that little sweetness perfect for chicken salad.  I used mayo for the creamy dressing and added chopped granny smith apples for a tart/sweet addition.  Excellent and easy as 1-2-3!

this was absolutely amazing. I had never made chicken salad before and it was a hit in my house. I added some chopped walnuts and diced apples for some texture but the straight recipe was delicious the way it is.

YUM!  Finding a chicken salad recipe as versatile as this is great.  In its original form, it is great for sandwiches (although I too used mayo instead of "salad dressing").  I also experimented with using some and making a chicken pasta salad. To the spread I added: 1/2 green and 1/2 red bell peppers, wasabi mayo for creamy salad dressing, 1/2-3/4 cup finely shredded cheese and added this to cooked rotini pasta.  Was this ever good!  There is something about the coleslaw dressing that gives it such a great "sweet twang".  Thanks so much, Richard, for sharing this great recipe with so many possibilities.

This recipe was great!  I didn't have a package of chicken breasts, but I DID have a package of chicken consisting of 2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 legs, and 2 wings.  I just used the whole package and doubled the rest of the recipe.  I used Kraft Cole Slaw dressing (about $1.49) and Miracle Whip.  It came out delicious.  Thanks!

Made this a day ahead to bring to today's 4th of July potluck picnic.  Letting the flavors meld overnight meant the onions came on a bit strong. One girl at the potluck said this was the BEST chicken salad she's ever eaten and she thought she didn't like chicken salad until today.
I liked it too although it bothered me that the texture was a bit like a tunafish salad and in fact, with the strong onion taste, it was easy to miss the chicken taste and think the dish was actually a tuna fish salad.

Very good. I made this at the last minute for a party and goofed up and put *WAY* too much onion, but it was very good nonetheless. I've never liked chunky chicken salad so this is the answer for me. Looking forward to making it again! 5 stars.

I know people are skeptical of the food processor in this recipe, but I followed it exactly as written.  I over-processed it, in fact, then piped it into puff pastries and served it at a fancy tea party.  I could hear the guests describing it as "chicken mousse".  I originally made it without onion, but after having people taste test it, they requested the onion.  That made it perfect. It goes to show that following a well reviewed recipe is the best policy!

Changes that I made to this recipe were added 1 Tsp Celery Seed, 1/4 chopped red grapes, and 1/2 cup chopped apple.  Next time I'll add fresh rosemary too.  This is a great basic recipe.

I usually cannot stand my own chicken salad - there is always this weird, mayo taste I can't stand.  But THIS!?  Oooh-WOW!  Very excited to make it for more than just the immediate family.  Great recipe!  Processed it in the Ninja - still can see small onion and celery chunks. I, like many reviewers, was skeptical. I like chicken salad to have a little sweetness so I thought about adding some apples or grapes - but I'm so glad I didn't.  The slaw dressing adds just enough sweetness.  I used shredded rotisserie chicken from the store - (already cooked and ready to go!) Thank you, so much, for this yummy recipe!

I am not sure on this yet.  I think the way you prepare the chicken and the brand of cole slaw dressing make a big difference in this.  I boiled/poached some chicken breasts to make this, so there was not much flavor to my chicken.  I used regular marzetti's coleslaw dressing.  Although this was a decent chicken salad, there wasn't much flavor beyond the expected onion/celery flavor.  It seemed kind of ordinary to me.  I will try a couple of things next time.  First, I will cook my chicken with some salt and maybe a bay leaf to give some extra flavor to the chicken.  Next, I will try another coleslaw dressing or maybe add a little more for more oomph.  Also, I really like cranberries in my chicken salad, so I will add a handful to give a little extra sweetness.  Overall, it was a very basic chicken salad, not much different than if you made with mayo and a little sugar like I usually do.  *Update* I made this with diced grapes and increased the dressing and mayo to taste and I really liked it.  4 stars with my modifications, 3 stars without.

Wonderful flavor. The coleslaw dressing was a great addition adding a tangy sweetness.  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth, (didn't use the food processor) added grapes and pecans used soft bread and everyone just loved. This is will be my go to chicken salad recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I had never considered my beautiful cuisinart processor for making chicken salad ! Great thing to do. But overprocessing results in a "paste" pretty quickly, so I used the pulse just enough to cut up all the chunks without overdoing it. I had a bunch of fresh parsley, some red and white onions, celery of course, the dressings you describe( miracle whip and Marzetti's) in generous proportions. Also used kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, dash of smoked paprika. I added in two hard boiled eggs, I really feel that added to the rich taste of the salad. After processing,  added chopped ( by hand)green grapes and toasted pecans.Awesome !This is a good recipe that I felt needed enhancement to make it great and I succeeded in doing so. Thank you! It's so easy to make.

For those that are skeptical on putting it in the food processor: It doesn't have to look like baby food or pate. You don't have to puree the ingredients, just pulse or put on low until it looks right to you.  I have tried this exact recipe with and without the food processor using the exact same ingredients and it does change the taste when you process the ingredients, almost as if it married up all the flavors with bits of crunch.  I liked it better that way.  I am leaving mine in the fridge overnight to marry up the flavor some more for lunch tomorrow.  You gotta try it!

I have made this chicken salad many times over the last 3 years.  This is by far the best chicken salad I've ever tasted.  I do however, chop everything since I don't own a food processor.  I try to get everything chopped up as small as I can get it. I also usually refrigerate it for a few hours after I've prepared it to let all the flavors blend in.  Thank you so much Richard Rego for this incredibly tasting, easy to make chicken salad.  It truly is 'the best'!

Very good.  Made my own slaw dressing (white vinegar, sugar, mayo) and I must have used really large chicken breasts because I needed waaayy more mayo to make it good and creamy (probably a cup total).  I did not puree the chicken, but chopped it into very small pieces.  Loved it though and my husband said it was "the best chicken salad he's ever had"!

I made exactly to recipe and it had a  very nice flavor.  A little bland for my taste, but I will try to spice it up a little next time.  I will also try it with the chicken more in chunks like some other reviewers.  The ground up texture turned off my husband a little.  A nice solid recipe and VERY easy.

This was SO GOOD!! Even my picky kids loved it. I used the breasts from a store-bought rotisserie chicken, mayo instead of miracle whip (ugh) and carrot instead of the celery since hubby doesn't eat celery. I've been searching for a good chicken salad recipe for years...I found it!!

I didn't use the food procesor. Susbtituted grated carrots for the celery stalk, and also added 1 leaf romaine lettuce finely chopped. Loved it!! next time i'll toss in some corn. Thank you

Our family has been making this recipe for years now and still think it is the best!  We do make it according to the recipe and appreciate the smooth texture, perfect for spreading on sandwich bread or crackers.  We have taken this chicken salad, along with the trimmings, to families in need of a meal.  It has always been well received.  If you need to pretty it up for public sharing, place in a bowl lined with lettuce and decorate with fresh herbs and cherry tomato.

Very good.  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of two, added 2 boiled eggs (chopped), fresh parsley.  I also used Miracle Whip (for the creamy dressing) and a lot more of the coleslaw dressing.

I've made this chicken salad twice within a week.  Made it the second time because it was such a big hit and went so fast the first time. This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

I am not one to eat the same dish everyday so it's strange for me to say that I eat this for lunch DAILY.  I make a batch up on Sunday night and every morning I throw it on a wheat wrap with tomatoes and iceburg lettuce to give it some crunch.  One thing I changed is that instead of creamy italian dressing I use a soy-based creamy italian by Nasoya.  Same taste, with less calories.

3 1/2 stars. Good overall, but not extremely flavorful. I used Mayo for the creamy salad dressing and Miracle Whip for the cole slaw dressing (all I had). Maybe the cole slaw dressing has more flavor than Miracle Whip. I've never had it before. I'll probably try that next time. It was the perfect consistency; not too dry, not runny. Also, I added 1 grated baby carrot, and I'm thinking of adding sweet pickle relish for a bit more flavor.

We enjoyed this salad for sandwiches. I used canned chicken. Also skipped the cole slaw dressing. For the creamy salad dressing, I used mayo, ranch and a trader joe cilantro dressing. Added cashews and granulated garlic and green onion.

DEEEE-LISH!  I was wary about trying out a chicken salad recipe, but am very very pleased with how it turned out!  I used Helman's Mayonnaise for the "creamy salad dressing" (ecch! I do not like Miracle Whip so that wasn't an option), and I used one can of "premium white chicken breast chunks" in place of the chicken breast halves and everything else I followed to a T; this worked out perfectly.  Thanks!!

I made this for my husband and he loves it!  Wants me to make it all the time.  I used the breasts from a grocery store bought rotisserie chicken skin and all, trader joes organic mayo, and Hidden Valley coleslaw dressing (because it does not have high-fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils like most of them).  I was worried it would be too soupy or wet, but I used the pulse setting on my food processor til I got it to the consistency that looked best. Thanks!

I gave this recipe 5 stars.  I thought this was a great salad; simple and easy to make with just a few ingredients.  I loved it.  
NOTE:  I don't have a food processor so I could only chop the chicken.  I wish I had chopped them smaller, or even shredded them because  
my husband thought the salad was too runny.  Again, I think it was because I could have chopped the chicken up more.  I'm sure that would have helped.  Also, I served it on flat bread.  Too much bread per bite in my opinion.  I prefer a better balance.  My fault, my choice.
Next time I'll try adding a chopped granny smith or something similiar.  Another crunchy texture and a surprisingly sweet, tart addition.  Yumm.

Yum! I made this exact to the recipe using a home-mixed coleslaw dressing and it was great to put on a sandwich or eat alone. I adapted the mix from the "Taste of Home's Creamy Coleslaw" recipe also on this site:

2 tablespoons mayonnaise or salad dressing 
2-3/4 teaspoons sour cream 
1/8 teaspoon seasoned salt 
1/8 teaspoon ground mustard 
1/8 teaspoon celery salt 
1 tsp red wine vinegar (to taste)

PS - Cook the chicken in broth for more flavor!

I made this today for me and dear husband. I chopped all ingredients by hand as we like a chunky chicken salad texture.  I used red onions and added about 1/2 cup swiss cheese. I doubled the recipe to have a few leftovers for later in the week, but we ate it all today for lunch and dinner.  YUMMMM

This is the easiest chicken salad I've ever made.  After cooking my chicken, it was ready in minutes.  Hidden Valley's Light Ranch with Bacon is a great salad dressing to use in this recipe...the taste of bacon without all the extra calories!

This is really really good.   The recipe calls for creamy salad dressing, which I am assuming is something like miracle whip?  I didnt have any, and used mayo instead and really am happy with the results.  I love the texture of it, and the slight sweetness from the cole slaw dressing.  Thank you!

Very good. I made my own coleslaw dressing from a recipe on this site and used 1/2 C. Also added a scant 1/2C of mayo since I didn’t have salad dressing. I usually add relish to chicken salad but was out so left as is. I will use this recipe from now on.

I rated it 5 stars because of its simplicity and taste, but have to confess I made some substitutions based on ingredients I had on hand. I substituted green onions(mostly green parts) for celery bcos I had none. I used only Ranch salad dressing and added a pinch of minced deseeded mild green chili. It tasted great and I am sure the original recipe will too. I used rotisserie chicken breasts.

This chicken salad recipe is my new favorite!  This is as close to my grandmother's recipe as I’ve found and it’s the new standard for our house.  I will say the flavors take at least an hour or two to develop but it’s well worth the wait!  I followed this recipe to a T.

I used 1/3 cupcole slaw dressing and a couple tablespoons of mayo.  I also cut up a rotisserie chicken, which I think added to the flavor.  And left it in small cubed pieces. I didn’t purée all the ingredients together. I like my chicken salad chunky, not like tuna fish. Delicious!

I also split the chicken salad and added two tablespoons of curry paste, raisins and sliced almonds for curried chicken salad. That too was delicious!

I’m not a cook. I used two cans of Members Mark 12.5oz Chicken. Maybe too much? Too dry. So I doubled the salad dressing (Miracle Whip) and doubled the slaw dressing. (Marzetti).  Added the salt and pepper and garlic powder to taste. Very pleased with this simple delicious recipe! My wife liked it too! ??

I made it as instructed. I choose rotisserie chicken and real mayonnaise because I had it on hand. It was delicious. I was skeptical of the slaw dressing but it works. Very yummy.

This is a great recipe and I also use the Easy Cole Slaw Dressing recipe on All Recipes. I do not use a food processor to grind it up bc we like our chicken salad chunky. Made with smoked chicken it is even better!

Made it. Loved it. Best chicken salad that I have ever tasted. The first time I made this, I made it according to the recipe. The next time I made it, because I was strapped for time, I used canned chicken and in my opinion, it was just as good. Everyone else agreed!

I had lots of compliments on this chicken salad when I made it for a ladies luncheon. I like the creamy, fine consistency. I prefer a more savory taste and this was on the sweet side. Otherwise, very happy with this recipe!

I followed this recipe only vaguely. I used mayo instead of the salad dressings and added some sweet tomato pickles and smoky paprika. I used it for a sandwich filling on croissants with roquette. Very good and a little special for a bridal High tea.

Regarding the measurements that are indicated for two of the ingredients (the ¼ cup of creamy salad dressing and the 4 tablespoons of coleslaw dressing): a quarter cup is equivalent to 4 tablespoons. So those quantities are identical, and may be measured either way, using either utensil. (For future reference: one standard measuring cup equals 16 level tablespoons, so a half cup is 8 tablespoons, and quarter cup is 4 tablespoons.)

I used mayo, since I’m not a fan of Miracle Whip . I used onion powder instead of dicing an onion. The slaw dressing was new to me and quite tasty! This recipe’s a keeper!

Made it exactly like the recipe said I used Hellmann’s light mayonnaise And hidden Valley coleslaw dressing. I can see where Mericle whip would be good as well. Delicious!!

Great simple recipe ..  made a couple of changes .... used mainly dark meat , will make with breast next time... made slaw  dressing from Allrecipes  simple slaw dressing recipe,   and didn't puree rather cut up small as I like the texture... 

People need to use common sense... if it seams like too much onion for your taste, start with less.... 

Anyway thanks for the recipe  will use this as my go to chicken salad recipe.

Super easy! i didn't have coleslaw dressing so I added some mustard power, celery seed, sugar and vinegar to the mayo and it tasted great. If you don't have slaw dressing, just make your own.

I've made this recipe twice and it has turned out well both times. It's so easy and tastes great!  The second time I used leftover Thai grilled chicken (spiced with lots of pepper and cilantro) and a green pepper instead of celery (since I didn't have any) and I think it was even better. A great way to use up leftover chicken!

I saw this recipe and it sounded good.  However I needed a recipe for a piece of halibut.  In my own way I thought I could sub the halibut for the chicken which I did and it turned out fantastic.  I poached the halibut in chicken broth, let it cool and proceeded with the rest of the recipe. I couldn't have been happier with the results.

I make this with one bag of vegetarian chicken (quorn brand tenders), I double the celery, skip the onion add salt, pepper ,onion powder and a few shakes of cayenne pepper and it is amazing! I also make my own slaw dressing based on a recipe I found on this page. It's amazing! My husband liked it so much that he even makes his own version with regular chicken. It's pretty much always in a Tupperware in the in the fridge at my house.

This was quite good, the texture from putting in the food processor is pretty smooth, which I found a bit weird. The flavor was yummy though,and it made good sandwiches and good for spreading on crackers. I will probably use this recipe again.

Yummy and easy, but heed the advice of others and cut the onion portion in 1/2 at least! It was tasty in both a sandwich and in a salad with lots of fresh tomatoes and greens.

This is an excellent chicken salad! The chicken in the food processor reminded me of the old days when my mom would put it through the grinder. My chopper wasn't big enough to make the whole thing in, so I mixed it all by hand. 
Fantastic recipe, thanks!

Made this for a 4th of July gathering with friends and people loved it! Don't be scared to use the food processor,  my friends thought this had just the right amount of crunch. So good that my husband asked me to make it again this weekend.

I've been searching for a chicken salad recipe like this for a long time!  Thank you for sharing! There used to be a deli called Chuck's in Downey, CA that my dad used to take me to as a kid.  It closed many years ago and thought I would never experience his chicken salad sandwich again.  That was until last night. Simply put the on a hoagie roll w/ lettuce...I just about died and went to Heaven. Attn: Cooks!!! Don't let the simplicity or the ingredients of this recipe fool you.  I'm not a fan of miracle whip but I am definitely a fan of this chicken salad.  Thanks again!

Good recipe..but here's the thing..I used mayonnaise instead of salad dressing. I used plenty of medium coarse ground pepper and some salt. I reduced the onion to half, and replaced the other half onion with green onions. I shredded the chicken by hand and did not use a processor. And the real secret to great chicken salad?  Dill.  Sprinkle in plenty of dill (Litehouse dried herbs) and you're all set for the best chicken salad ever.

I have made this as written and it was really great and easy to do.  I wasn't a fan of the texture though and that's why the 4 stars.  The second time I made this, I used up some smoked chicken thighs/leg quarters.  That smoky flavor took this recipe over the top. I processed half of the chicken after the celery/onion and then folded in the other half chicken that I shredded instead.  This made for a much better consistency, I thought.  I also used red instead of white onion and added a half can of sliced water chestnuts because I really like a crunch to any salad recipe.  Thank you Richard for a really great recipe.

I have made this recipe loads of times and everyone loves it.  I love how dead-easy it is to make. The coleslaw dressing really is a great secret ingredient for making it taste like it has a lot of fancy ingredients in it when it doesn't. (I would like to point out that 1/4 cup and 4 TBSP is the same amount, so you don't need to dirty up two measuring devices for your dressings!)

I do puree it all in my food processor -- not how I was accustomed to eating chicken salad but I actually love it that way now. It holds together on the bread and you don't have chunks of chicken falling out on your lap.  I frequently make this along with homemade rolls to give as a gift to friends who are sick/have just had a baby/etc .  I make it with scallions when I make it for my family, but it does turn the puree rather green, so I make it with regular onion when I give it as a gift. :-)

Had all the stuff but the salad dressing.  Substituted mayo, horseradish sauce and sweet pickle relish.  YYUUUMMMM!! Blender on the fritz.  Used the food chopper.  Had to push away from the table it was so delicious.

This was a good recipe. It didn't "wow" me - it just seemed like all the other chicken salad recipes missing an "it" factor. I did use the low fat mayo and fat free slaw dressing. Perhaps the lack of fat is why I wasn't won over? I will make this again as it is easy, until I find "the" recipe that I am looking for.

The best. Easy, yummy. I use water chestnuts chopped up instead of celery, i hate onions so used onion powder and garlic powder, pulled rotisserie chicken, and add some cayenne. Mmmm. Has become a staple!

I am reviewing as I devour the chicken salad for lunch. It was delicious and easy, I was able to make it after coming home at 8:30 after an exhausting day. I chopped everything by hand because I like my chicken salad chunky. I used mayo instead of the dressing, no celery, and red onion because thats what I like. I also chopped up two strawberries, cherries, and one dill pickle spear into the salad. Let it marinate for an hour and enjoy it sprinkled with some Parmesan cheese. This is definitely a go to recipe during the summer months when it is painful to turn on the stove.

This is simply divine and using the food processor produces a great flavour. I've even used the basis of this recipe with tuna (mixing coleslaw and miracle whip)

This is my favorite now. I make it often now, my friends like it too, and asking for a recipe... I dont use a food processor, but I cut the chicken finely, so its good. BTW I made the coleslaw dressing as one of the reviewers has suggested.

Oh so good! I have always wanted a chicken salad recipe to call my own. I have found it! You can make the texture any way you want. I made it as is. Served on croissants. I layered lettuce and sweet pickles on top of salad for my sandwich. Can also be used like a pate w/crackers if you process it enough.

This is nice. I used homemade coleslaw dressing and mayo. I'm giving this 3 * because it wasn't above average or excellent. If you've ever been into a sandwich shop and they have a shredded chicken, mayo and veg sandwich this is what it tastes like. The consistency is not a plus in its favour. However, I suppose the kids would find it easy to eat, but not very flavourful. A bit of a disappointment because I tripled the recipe. Great for little kids sandwiches who can't eat crunchy things but not really suited to adults.

I am so particular about chicken salad, that in fact, I've only found one place I like it really!! This was a fabulous recipe! I used a cole slaw mix that I love from Harp's produce department and a sliver of chopped apple. I also added about a tablespoon of salad dressing to the mix before serving to make it a bit more moist.

Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

Great recipe, but I compromised and only processed about half. It made a great texture. By the way 1/4 cup = 4 tablespoons, so the dressings are half and half ;-)

Super easy and very yummy! Used Miracle Whip and Marzetti slaw dressing just as others recommended. Perfect!  I also boiled the chicken breasts.  Made for a wedding reception and got rave reviews!  Perfect!  Next time I might experiment with other dressings, but this is a safe bet!  Thanks!

I love the cole slaw dressing in this recipe.  I chopped my ingredients instead of using the food processor and I liked the texture.  I will make sure to double this next time so we can have plenty of leftovers.

Very good.  A good base to embellish on to make it my own.  I liked the way it spread easily.

I was a little hesitant in making this, since my husband is not a big fan of chicken. But he raved, saying that this IS the best chicken salad recipe that he has ever had. The rest of the family-well we like chicken, and loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is perfect and easy to make!  I think next time, I made add a boiled egg in.  However, it is very flavorful as is.

It was a tasty chicken salad.  My 8 year-old daughter loved it wrapped in a low-carb tortilla with lettuce for lunch.  I'll continue my search for the perfect mix of savory & sweet.

Very easy and really tasty. I used minced onions as well as I didn't have an onion. I would definately make it again!

Very good recipe.  I baked the chicken in oil, salt, pepper, and oregano.  I also chopped the chicken by hand and threw in some walnuts.

This was very good.  If you are using a food processor, you can pulsate it to the degree of chunkiness that you want.  If you just hit on, then it will blend it too fast and will be very creamy. I think next time I will add dill pickles to the recipe but it was still a very good dish. Thanks

I think this would be better with tuna.  Tastes a lot like tuna salad.

This was the first time I ever made chicken salad and I was so pleased with the results. I could have eaten it all up before I served it to my guests! Personally, though, it was drier than I would have liked once I made my sandwich. So I spread a little more Miracle Whip on my bread and it was perfect. This is now my offical recipe for life! Although, I'm not so sure that I will need to have the coleslaw dressing in the furture. Miracle Whip adds the same sort of flavor as the Kraft dressing I bought. I can add some more spices (like curry or dill or garlic) myself. Enjoy!

I used mayo because I'm not a fan of miracle whip and added sour cream and toasted almonds.  Very delicious

This is excellent.  I added crushed pineapple(drained) & grapes.  I also used light Miracle Whip.  With the pineapple & grapes, it made 3 cups.
