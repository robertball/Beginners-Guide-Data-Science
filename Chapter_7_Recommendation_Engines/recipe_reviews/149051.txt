This was great, I love the raisin bread idea - it really gave an everyday sandwich a fun kick

So at first I was skeptical when trying this recipe since there were only 2 reviews spaced out over the past 6 years, but I decided to go ahead and try something new. In making this I did change a few things. I used the cinnamon swirl raisin bread and I added onions. I found that if you do not use the honey mustard you have a dry sandwich that does not taste right so it is a must! Also the onions to me add just a bit more flavor that fits the whole sandwich together. Glad I tried this recipe, the whole family loved it!

There were pretty darned good.  I wanted to make these to take a photo but could not find Raisin Black Bread so I made Steak House Black Bread (this site) in order to make these.  Good flavors but way too much meat and cheese for one sandwich.  (could use some red onion too) I started think I would do these in my cast iron skillet - then realized there was no way I was going to be able to flip them over so I turned off the skillet and broke out the Panini maker - that worked much better.  This recipe only had one other review from 2008 - 4 years later it has a face and is worthy of making again.  Thanks!

I made absolutely no changes to this recipe and it was wonderful just the way it was written! One reviewer gave this 3 stars just because it has a lot of calories and supposedly too much meat and cheese. Well, hello! You can see that in the recipe before trying it. But giving it 3 stars for that reason is just downright unfair. If you want meat and cheese, then fix this sandwich because it's mouth-watering, especially with plenty of honey mustard (I like moisture in my food). If you don't want meat and cheese, then go vegetarian, of course, and don't make this sandwich. By the way, this is great in the frying pan, as well as a panini maker.

I had pumpernickel and raisins and ground turkey but no bacon. Had Swiss cheese. Will make tonight and try layering flavours.

Ok well thought cranberries could replace the mustard if too dry.
