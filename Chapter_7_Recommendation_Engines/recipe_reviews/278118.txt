It was tasty but quite dry and I baked it in a Wolf steam oven on the convection humid setting.  I think I'll try it again with must room temperature butter rather than melting it.  There was quite a bit of butter that settled to the bottom on the spring form pan and was wasted.

Love this recipe! I made no changes, thank goodness. The flavor of cranraisins & pecans is wonderful. This will be a “goto” recipe from now on.

Delicious!   I followed the recipe exactly.   As long as I was getting the baking dishes dirty, I made two separate batches and gave one away.  It's pretty easy to put together.
