I make A LOT of cookies and my fiance told me these were the best cookies I have ever made.  Brought tears to my eyes to hear that from him. :) Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Loved making this cookie. Very easy and tasty. It was a bit more chocolate than hazelnut, but very good overall. Will definitely make again.
