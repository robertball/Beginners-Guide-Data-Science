This recipe is worth the work!  I'd originally made this as a dipping sauce for chicken satay, but I mixed leftovers with spaghetti and fresh green onions for a home version of my takeout fav, Cold Sesame Noodles.  Excellent both ways.  A recipe box keeper for sure.

Very good!  I hate when people alter a recipe and then review it BUT (yes, you guessed it) I changed it a bit:  I didn't have soy sauce so I added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp rice vinegar and I didn't add the lime juice because I don't like it.  That's it!  I think the servings are a bit off because I needed a bit for one serving of pasta, but other than that this is a great recipe!

Made this last night to serve with a chicken/vegie and pancit noodle stir fry.  I was lazy and used peanut butter which eliminated the need for the sugar and oil. I thinned the mixture out with chicken broth and it was absolutely delicious! This one's a keeper and I thank you Lisa!

Used this in the filling for Thai Chicken Spring Rolls (AR recipe) and also served on the side as a dipping sauce.  This is just really good!  Definitely will be making again

Great sauce! You can use this as a sauce for a Thai style pasta, but you probably want to add about 1/2 cup chicken/vegetable broth to it when it's in the food processor so it will distribute better through your pasta. I like to saute cubed tofu (1 inch size), shredded cabbage and bean sprouts, add a package of cooked rice noodles, and then toss with this sauce. Delicious, filling, healthy and easy!

This is the best Thia Peanut Sauce I have found.  It tastes just like what is served in Thia restaurants with the fresh rolls.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty!  I am really happy that it didn't use peanut butter!  It was more like REAL thai peanut sauce!

Excellent recipe! We've made this using a blender because we don't have a processor. Might have to invest in one to make more delicious sauces like this. So easy to make and very tasty. We used a hot chili sauce instead of the hot oil. Sriracha sauce is great on eggs too so it won't only be used for this recipe. Love this!!
