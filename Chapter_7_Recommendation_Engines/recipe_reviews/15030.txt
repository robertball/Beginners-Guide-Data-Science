Great, easy, yummy recipe, Angela!  Thank you.

For those complaining about it not being crispy enough, there are lots of basic tutorials on this site.  The basic idea is this:  lower temp, more time, less browning, versus higher temp, less time, more browning.  This is why we broil quickly and braise slowly, and why there are lots of temperatures on our ovens.

So, in short, if you see this recipe, read the reviews, and decide you want it crispier -- boost the temp to 400 and shorten the cooking time by 5 or ten minutes.  Or, boost to 425, do for 20 minutes total, and turn halfway through.

I just hate to see a great recipe get "dinged" because people don't read reviews or know how to make some simple changes to suit their tastes. ;)

I used ranch dressing rather than italian and used garlic and herb bread crumbs.  The chicken tasted wonderful and was very moist and tender--no knife required!

Very good and super easy!! My husband loved it but I did make some adjustments to the recipe (some similar to previous posts):
1)Marinated the chicken breasts in Newman's Own Italian salad dressing for 3 hours 2) Added parmesan cheese and garlic salt to the bread crumbs and 1 cup was plenty 3) Drizzled a little melted butter on chicken in hopes of browning but ended turning up the heat to 400 towards the end because it wasn't browned 4)Added a slice of muenster cheese on top of each breast the last 5 minutes. I served this with broccoli and herb noodles and it was a very filling and great meal!

My family has been using a similar recipe for years.  This is one of our favorite dinners. I marinate the chicken in the salad dressing for a couple of hours to get the most flavor. I also sometimes mix some melted butter into the breadcrumbs. This helps the crumbs stick to the chicken better and also makes it slightly crispier.

WOW!!! What a great recipe.  The chicken came out very moist and tender.  The flavor was incredible.  I made this 2 days in a row last week and plan on making it again tonight!  The flavor combinations are endless.  I used light Italian dressing the first night & the second night I used honey mustard.  I added herbs & parmesan cheese to my seasoned breadcrumbs.  Tonight I plan on using an oriental dressing.  I cooked mine for 25 minutes at 350 degrees (turned once) and broiled the last couple of minutes to crisp up the top.  Thank You!

This is a really easy recipe, but still very tasty.  I added some Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs, and marinated the chicken in the dressing for a couple of hours.  The result was excellent!  The kids loved it and so did my wife and I.  We will definitely make this recipe again.

Nice recipe Angela! I mixed dijon mustard in with the dressing, sprayed a bit of PAM onto the breasts for some crispness and cooked on a rack. I also added garlic and parm cheese to the breadcrumbs. Thanks for a quick and easy dish!

Yummy. I did as others here suggested and marinated the chicken in the Italian dressing, then coated "Shane n' Bake" style. It turned out very moist and flavorful. I served it with stuffing and steamed broccoli.

This recipe is great.  My fiance doesn't care for chicken, but really liked this.  My 13 month old also loved it.  I poured a tiny bit of olive oil over the top during the last 10 minutes, and it came out very cripsy.

I loved the idea of this recipe. I made some changes and it came out great.  I marinated the chicken in the dressing for about an hour. Then to the bread crumbs I added garlic salt, parmasean cheese, and a little onion powder. Then I breaded the chicken and pan fried it to get it nice and brown. I put it in a glass baking dish and sprinkled some of the reamaining breading over it and drizzled it with butter before baking. It was perfect.

How much easier can cooking get?
This is a great recipe. The chicken comes out moist and delicious. This is the recipe my boyfriend requests most often (once a week, at least). I've also tried using French dressing (kinda gross, wouldn't do it again) and a pesto italian dressing (excellent).

It was excellent! I marinated it in the dressing for about 2 hours b4 cooking and i raised the temp to 400 degrees as mentioned, still came out a lil soggy, but that could have been my error with greasing the pan. I also added a lil garlic powder, pepper, and Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs to add a lil flavor. I will make this again!

Ok we marinate our chicken in italian dressing to grill it all of the time and love it. I thought we would love this but it ended up having a weird flavor to us. We didn't care for it at all and probably won't eat the leftovers.

I loved this. It was the easiest thing I have made in a long time, but was so tasty! I made my own "breadcrumb" mixture using crushed ritz crackers and basil, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. It turned out amazing. I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, flipping them halfway through, and it wasn't soggy at all.

Chicken had good flavor even with a short marinade time. For those who want a crispier crust, try putting the chicken under the broiler for the last few minutes of cooking time, just make sure to watch it closley-it can go from perfectly cripy to inedibly charred rather quickly.

Definitely easy!  I pounded out the chicken breasts first. Tasted okay although my husband didn't care for it at all.  The italian dressing takes some getting used to. I would rather spice up some bread crumbs, dredge the chicken in beaten egg first and then in the bread crumbs and bake. Not sure I would make this again.

This is a great no-fuss recipe for a quick dinner. It's also healthy. I added parmesan cheese and used fat-free italian dressing. The breadcrumbs were a bit dry after baking, but I fixed that with a spritz cooking oil spray. I will definitely be making these again, especially when cooking time is limited!

Easy and quick!  I used fat free italian dressing since that's what I had, and used plain breadcrumbs that I added my own seasonings to (seasoned salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and parmesan cheese), and took the advice of another reviewer by putting the breadcrumbs in a bag and shook the pieces of chicken in it.  Husband absolutely raved about this.  The chicken was moist and tasty...it's amazing that it only takes 3 ingredients (plus seasonings)!!

Yep, it's that easy. I do put chicken in a zip lock with the dressing, though-- it makes it faster and less messy. I use home made bread crumbs which makes it taste better than store-bought. I don't bother to flip the chicken mid-way through cooking. It doesn't matter I have found. But I do bring the chicken to the top rack in the oven to "broil" the chicken about 5 minutes at the very end to make it crispy and golden. My family loves it-- and we have chicken parm this way about once every other month.

Not impressed. There are similar recipes that are much better in my opinion. Probably won't make this one again.

My family didn't like it.  I could taste the Italian dressing too much and it was bland as others said.  It was really juicy though.

It tasted okay. I marinated the chicken breasts in zesty italian dressing for an hour. Breaded them with plain bread crumbs. Added garlic salt on top. The flavor was boring. It was super juicy though, so I can't complain about that. I wish it would have tasted better. I tried to find my italian seasoning and would have added that but couldn't find it. I'll keep this recipe to improve upon. :) Thanks!

Very easy excellent recipe! My husband normally hates frozen chicken breasts, but he absolutely loved it! I made my own dressing out of white balsalmic vinegar and olive oil, with italian spices. I also made the chicken in a cast iron pan to speed up the cooking time. Will definitely be making again!

Very good.  My only ding is that you don't need 2 cups of crumbs...alot gets wasted.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll use 1 cup of crumbs and 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese rather than a full 2 cups of crumbs.

My hubby and I really liked this recipe because it really has endless possibilities with different salad dressing and mixture of bread crumbs! We will definantly play around with it. I also put it on a rack so that it would cook and let any oil or fat drip off...very low fat option! THanks for the recipe!

This was a very quick and easy chicken dish.  Next time I am going to marinate the chicken for a little while, and maybe add some parmesan cheese.

but be careful to avoid having the breading under the chicken stick to the pan!

I used the advice of a previous reviewer and increased the temperature and lowered the time.  I did use boneless skinless thighs and they came out perfect.  It was great! I loved being able to use dressing to coat instead of an egg or milk.  Hooray! It was moist, tender and tasty. I served mine over a bed of spaghetti with red sauce.

Easy and so delish!! Bought chicken breast, already seasoned with italian dressing. Rolled in italian bread crumbs and topped with drizzled butter and paprika before baking. Served with my famous cheesy tators and a fresh avocado and bacon salad. Mmmmmm

I have made this and it is a family favorite, I do not use bread crumbs instead I use crushed cornflakes. This gives it a crunch that bread crumbs do not.

Pretty good. I wanted a last-minute idea for the chicken breasts I took out for supper. I added the parmesan and some garlic and seasoning salt to the bread crumbs. I basted the chicken with some melted butter for browning. Next time I will let the chicken marinate in the dressing for a few hours.

I was in a pinch and didnt really have anything to make for dinner and no time for the store so I tried this out.  It was moist, which was really good.  But other than that, nothing spectacular.  If I ever make this again I think I would definately leave it in the dressing to marinade awhile and maybe try a little parmesan cheese in the bread crumbs.  It was super easy and the ingredients are things I always have on hand, definate bonuses.

Way to go Angela!  This was sooooo good and very easy to make.  It came out so moist.  The only thing I added that was different was some drizzled butter on top of the bread crumbs before baking. These were thick cuts of chicken breast so I baked at 350 for 40 minutes and used Wish Bone italian dressing.
My hubby and son loved it also!!!!

Thank you for such a wonderful recipe! Thanks Angela!

Excellent and easy. Here is my variation -- use chicken tenders or cut breasts into tender size strips. Bake on a pizza stone or cookie sheet for 20-25 minutes at 400.

I liked the recipe for ease of preparation and thought the Italian dressing gave flavor.  My husband felt the chicken should have been browned.  He said it didn't look appealing.

Delicious! I made a few minor changes based on the reviews of others. I marinated the chicken in the dressing for 3 hours. I added parmesan cheese and garlic powder to the breadcrumbs. I also turned the chicken about half way through. Very juicy and tasty and I am not usually a fan of chicken!

Will definitely make again! The only changes I made were I used premarinated lemon pepper chicken breasts and low fat Italian dressing, because those were what I had on-hand. Very simple, yet very delicious recipe.

I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs so I put some croutons into the food processor and used those instead.  It worked out great!  Served it with pilaf.  Quick meal and very tasty.  This is going to be added into our regular meal rotation

While I liked the ease of this recipe, I didn't like the end product. If I make this again I'll use Ritz crackers as a coating. The bread crumbs just seemed too mushy for me. I did as many reviewers did: I cooked the chicken on a rack, added spices to the bread crumbs, and broiled for the last five minutes of the cooking time. Still just so-so.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  I never make chicken.  In fact, my husband and I never cook chicken breasts because they're so boring and rarely good.  This recipe was fantastic.  It was so easy (threw it together in 5 minutes) and cooked at 400 for 25 minutes.  I will definitely make this again!

Listen, if you need a super-easy, super-fast supper, this is it!  I couldn't believe how moist the chicken was with so few ingredients.  My family loved it.  I substituted equivalent amounts of crushed croutons because we didn't have bread crumbs and bumped the temperature to 450 degrees for the last 12 minutes both to crisp the topping and so I could throw in the easy Yogurt Biscuits by Rosemarie Kondrk from this site to go with our dinner.  Delicious!

It was very easy, and I did marinate the chicken as others suggested. I even cut the chicken into smaller pieces for chicken nuggets. However, I personally didn't like the flavor very much and won't be making this again.

I must say that I was a bit skeptical when seeing the ease of this recipe.  I thought, "How could that be good?"  But with nothing much in the fridge and availability of condiments limited, I went ahead and tried it.  It was delicious.  The only thing I would suggest is to allow the chicken to marinate in the dressing for an extended period of time.  You know, really soak up that Italian Dressing.  Besides that, I really enjoyed the easiness and the taste.  Raj H.

I've made this twice: once as written and once with Ranch dressing.  The results are pretty bland and unless you go to the trouble of messing with temperatures / broiling / flipping it's gonna end up a little soggy on the bottom.  But for how quick it's done, start to finish, it's good enough to make once in a while...when you're short on time.  Just don't have high expectations!

This is a really good basic recipe, it's very easy to make changes to suit your tastes, and it's almost impossible to screw up. I used creamy Caesar dressing, chicken tenders instead of breasts (I find they're easier to bread,) and added some grated parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours, then I baked at 350 for 15 min, turned the chicken over, baked at 400 for about another 10 min, and stuck it under the broiler for 5 min... came out perfect, flavorful and juicy.

This lived up to its name!  I didn't marinate at all, just dipped in the dressing and then the bread crumbs. I added grated parm to the bread crumbs. I followed the advice of another reviewer and baked at 400 for a crispier finish. I also broiled a bit at the end. The chicken was very moist and there were no leftovers!

Really simple and REALLY good.  My husband and I loved it.  I did put the chicken in at 400 degrees and left in for about 25-28 minutes.  It was very moist.  I used the pre-made/boxed Italian bread crumbs.

The chicken was very tasty!  I did put some extra spices in the Italian bread crumbs and marinaded the chicken in the Italian dressing for about an hour. I also broiled the chicken for a few minutes at the end. It was very moist inside, and after I broiled it, it was crisp on the outside. Thanks for the idea!

Oh my! This was delicious! I took suggestions to marinate longer - 30 minutes or so. I used Italian-style breadcrumbs and added crushed red pepper for a kick. Finally, I completed cooking in the broiler for about 5 minutes. Enjoy! (I cannot imagine any other result!)

AWESOME!  Exactly what I was looking for!  I needed a quick dinner for my 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 year old daughters and this was perfect!  They really gobbled it up!  I also think if you cut the chicken breasts into strips it would make a great party appetizer!!!  I used balslamic vinegrette and the flavor was terrific and my chicken came out wonderfully moist!  This is a definate keeper!

I'm torn. I want to give this recipe 5 stars for being SO easy and still tasting good, but it really seems a little too generous. The flavor was good, but not out of this world. Wish I'd read the review about getting a crispy topping, but I'll know better next time.  Very tasty and very easy for the night when you don't really feel like being in the kitchen but don't want to choke down fast food or something out of the freezer section.

I marinated the chicken for an hour in the salad dressing before I coated with bread crumbs to give extra flavor, but I thought it was still a little bland. Next time I think I would season up the bread crumbs with a little extra spices of my own.  Very easy to make!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I was looking for a low-fat way to enjoyed breaded chicken with my salad and this is it.  I even had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Next time I'm going to try one breast each with BBQ, Ranch, A1, and any other sauce or dressing I can think of. Way to go, Angela. Thanks!

I first reviewed this recipe a few years ago. I just wanted to say that this is still one of my family's favorite meals. My picky Asperger son loves this chicken and will eat it as is.  I use Newman's Own Ceasar dressing- it looks like Italian dressing. If you have the time marinate over night in the dressing. If not even just a couple of hours really adds to the flavor.  Any leftovers I heat up add some jack cheese and mustard and put on toasted bread for a sandwich. It's VERY good!

I didn't have italian style bread crumbs so I added garlic powder, salt, pepper, & Mrs Dash to the plain bread crumbs.  I also used Ceasar Italian Dressing.  It was so GOOD and was so EASY!  My husband and 2 year old daughter loved it!  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is really easy andquick to prepare on weeknights. I found that mixing parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs adds more flavor.

Easy. Easy. Easy. 
When I ran out of Italian dressing, I mixed Balsamic vinegar and oil - it turned out delicious. 
Loved it will make it again. 
Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe seemed too good to be true. I didn't this chicken could be so easy to make and so delicious! I made these for a whole bunch of guests and they loved them! They were raving about how delicious they were and asking me for the recipe.

My only change to the recipe was LAYING a sheet of aluminum foil over the pan of chicken while it cooked in the oven. I did NOT pinch the edges of the aluminum foil, as that would cause too much moisture to stay in the pan and leave the crumbs mushy. But I also did not leave these uncovered, as that would surely dry them out (and I hate dry chicken). I strongly recommend this recipe to others.

My mom used to make this for me all the time when I was younger without the breading! The only thing I would change about this recipe would be to marinate the chicken in the Italian dressing overnight like my mom used to, so the flavors of the Italian dressing really stick to the chicken! Delicious, fast, & easy!

This was wonderful!  I also added parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and I used an italian dressing mix with olive oil and water. I baked the breasts in my toaster oven which allowed them to sit closer to the coil.  It didn't take more than 20 minutes to bake them (only two) and they were wonderfully crisp!

I used this recipe last night and it was a hit.  My son had 2.5 chicken breasts and said that it was amazing (high praise from a 16 year old)  I will definitely be using this one over and over.  I didn't change a thing and it was perfection.

I loved this recipe! I marinated the chicken breasts overnight and used seasoned bread crumbs. I can't really say how much, just enough to cover. I sprayed both sides of the chicken with non-stick spray and bumped up the oven to 400° for 20 minutes, turning the chicken halfway through. It browned very nicely. No more will I mess with egg/breading and pan browning. Next time I am going to add some grated parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.

Now this is the kinda recipe I love!! Fast, Easy  and tastes great. I chopped up some garlic and marinated with the Italian Dressing for 15 mins. I would suggest NOT marinating it much longer. The acid cooks the chicken making it dry. Ive tried something like this a while back and it turned out horrible bec I marinated it overnight. I also used half breadcrumbs and half parmesan cheese. I will be making this regularly.

We had this for dinner tonight. Very good and very easy. I used a Fat Free Italian Dressing, and put garlic powder, and oregeno in the bread crumbs. Cooked it at 400* 20 min. on each side. Was really juicy. I had dinner on the table within 1 hour from getting home from work. A nice stress free dinner.

This recipe is excellent and EASY!  I used Neumann's Own Italian dressing.  I did not have time to marinade the chicken which I want to try next time but it was just as good dredging it in the dressing as the recipe originally recommends.  As others suggested, I bought some fresh Parm and added Italian seasoning & garlic salt to the bread crumbs.  

I decided to try cooking the chicken at 375 for 30 minutes and it turned out perfectly!

This recipe was ok, nothing that blew my taste buds away though.  Right now I'm undecided if I'll make it again, but if I do I'm going to try marinating the chicken over night to see if there's a way to infuse more flavor.  Thanks for giving me the building blocks to mix things up and find something that is more suited to our tastes.

Can I give MORE then 5 stars?
WOW! GREAT!  OK, I did change a couple of things.
FIRST...I used chicken tenders since it's just me and hubby.
SECOND...I make my own bread and had some leftover herb rolls and made my own bread crumbs.  
BUT even with Angela's list of ingredients I think this is a EASY and NO brainer recipe.
I cooked my tenders at 475 degrees for about 15 minutes...checking on them so they didn't over cook.
My hubby said "PLEASE put this recipe in your book".  
THANK YOU Angela...GREAT recipe!

Have been making this recipe for a long time, always good when your in a hurry and need something good for dinner. Works even better if you let them marinate in the dressing for a while.

We added some zesty southwest seasoning to the breading to give it a kick.  Whole family loved it.  Chicken was very tender and juicy! Thanks Angela!!

These were really good and soooo easy. The only changes I made were that I drizzled a little olive oil on top and after they were done in the oven I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to get crispy.

I used my own version of salad dressing: olive oil, champagne orange muscat vinegar, little Dijon mustard, crushed garlic, salt&pepper and some onion powder. Then I added a little mayo to help it coat better. I used Ian's whole wheat panko bread crumbs which are really tasty. I also used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breast and cooked everything at 400F for just 20 minutes on a pizza pan to preserve crispiness. Easily one of the best recipes I've made this year. Mayo really helps it stay moist. Delicious!

Delicious! Although I usually need to cook the chicken a little longer than 30 minutes (maybe 10 more).

Okay - I MUST'VE done something wrong here... b/c there are all these rave reviews, but our chicken had almost no taste to it & I marinated it for a good hour, if not more! I imagine it must be something I did, & not the recipe, so I'm giving it a three, & I'll try it again, maybe pounding out the chicken flat & marinating it overnight next time. I suppose that I could also add seasoning to the breadcrumbs, but that wouldn't help the flavor of the meat itself... Don't know what went wrong.

I used boneless leg/thigh meat instead, but it was still SO GOOOOOD!!!!!! I ate it with a creamy mushroom & onion sauce drizzled over some of my leftover rice... for a grad student, this is practically a special occasion dinner...especially if it tastes that good with such a simple recipe. :)

This is a crowd favorite. Everyone I've made this for just LOVES it. I use Good Seasons Italian Dressing and let the chicken marinate for at least 3 hours. It comes out perfect and moist every time!

Quite tasty if very mildly flavoured, I even let the chicken marinate in the Italian dressing for 1/2 an hour, I think I might leave it to marinate for longer next time.

Really easy and hassle-free to make! However, it *did* taste like 30 mins' work.. Rather bland and not crispy on the outside as we'd expected. Will probably make this again only when really short on time..

I followed some of the other reviews and added parmesan cheese and other seasonings to the bread crumbs.  I also broiled it for a few minutes at the end of baking.  Hubby thought it was excellent, my son and I thought it was pretty good.

I was surprised that something so easy would turn out so Yummy!!!!!  I used Ranch dressing and marinated it in the fridge for an hour.  I also added Parm cheese and garlic salt to the breading (someone's suggestion here).  Then I had to cook it a little longer because my Chicken Breasts were really thick!!!  I couldn't believe how moist they were.  For a working mom of 2, quick and easy are my best friends.  I will definitely be making this again and trying different dressings for variety.  And my picky 3 yo son loved it and asked for seconds.  My only complaint is that the breading came off the bottom of the chicken and stayed on the pan.  How do I solve that problem?  I sprayed it lightly with Pam but it still stuck!?!?!

This is a great dish. Easy to make and tastes great. I marinated the chicken breasts in cheese and garlic italian dressing overnight (like I do for another recipe) before I breaded and cooked them. Another one for the recipe box.

This is GREAT!  I used the Good Seasons Italian mix (I made the dressing with balsamic vinegar and the "Zesty Istalian Mix"), and marinated the chicken in it for like 2 hours.  Then I followed the recipe as written.  Did the "shake 'n' bake" thing to coat it w/the breadcrumbs.  Served with http://sidedish.allrecipes.com/AZ/LmnHrsrdishNwPtts.asp Lemon Horseradish Potatos.  It was great!!  Please try!

I tried this recipe cause I was looking for something quick and easy.  Well, I found it in this recipe.  It was quite tasty and juicy.  I put the bread crumbs in a bag and did the shake and bake thing after dipping the chicken in the dressing.  It worked fantastic.  My family loved it as did I.  I will use this recipe time and time again.

I took a few suggestions from some of the other reviews when making this dish.  I added some parmesean cheese to the break crumbs and before baking, I spread some olive oil on the coating - DELICIOUS.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe.  I used Kraft Parmesan Italian dressing and it was awesome.  Very easy and tasty.

I am a full-time student, and this is a nice, easy, inexpensive, stress-free meal to make, and delicious, too!  I did it "shake n' bake" style by putting the bread crumbs in a zip lock bag, saves bread crumbs and time.  Also, I used ultra low fat italian dressing and it was still fabulous, and healthier, too!

I had intended to make something else for dinner then realized I didn't have all of the ingredients then came on here and found this recipe. It was wonderful. I am not a big fan of chicken, but will eat it a lot more using this recipe.

Really good and moist, but I think I put too much dressing on it.  My dad made it the next week without as much dressing, and it was better!

I'd tried doing this with fried chicken, but never baked. This was really easy and very delicious. Healthier than fried chicken, too.

This was absolutely STUPENDOUS! Short, easy, and delicious...who could want more. It's definitely a 5-Star recipe, no hands down. BUT...instead of Italian dressing, I used Best Foods CITRUS SPLASH ORANGE VINAGRETTE dressing,and though I didn't marinate it at all, I can't help but think letting it sit in the dressing for an hour or so would be even better. ALSO...I had some homemade bread crumbs already made up. What made them work out so well was that they weren't totally pulverized, and in fact were random sizes, which gave a great crunch to the chicken. Also they were made of PLAIN WHITE BREAD, so there weren't any spicy crumbs to compete with the citrus tang of the dressing. Everyone at the table kept commenting about how truly delicious the chicken was! Thanks so ve-ee-ee-ry much for this recipe! I have no doubt but that I'll be making it 20 years from now, and still getting compliments!

The italian dressing made the chicken delicious.  However, I had a problem with the breadcrumbs sticking to the pan, even though I had greased it.  Most of the breadcrumbs came off, but the chicken was still delicious!

Used French Dressing. It was all we had. Pounded two breast to 1/2 inch thick. Used  a baking rack over a pan. Flipped at half wa point. Baked at 425 for 18 minutes. Chicken came out with a nice crisp to it. Everyone loved it. Thinking you can probably use a lot of different salad dressings with good results.

you definitely need ranch or mayo instead of italian dressing.  and you definitely need parmesean mixed with breadcrumbs.

Super good and quick prep time.  I  used bone in chicken and  cooked on a rack inside baking dish. Still had soggy bottoms but will make the adjustments I see in other posts.

This  was absolutely fantastic! I googled breaded chicken recipes and this came up.  I looked at reviews to tweak things a tad. I too seasoned my bread crumbs.  I used garlic salt, onion powder, parmesan cheese, italian seasoning and some other seasonings with rosemary.  I broiled the last five minutes to get it crispy.  I marinated about an hour.  Used Paul Newmans Oil & Vinegar dressing.  I also melted butter in the bread crumbs.  It was sooooo tender, juicy and flavorful.  My boyfriend went back to eat the rest.  Thank you!  Will make this again and try with other dressings!

I am a decent cook but I Love how Simple & Straight Forward this Recipe is. Tonight I made it with some Garlic & Cheese Mashed Potatoes on the side plus some Toasted Garlic Baguette Medallions.. Yummy

Super good! I changed the heat to 400 and did it for 20 minutes, flipping the chicken after 10. I also used ranch instead of italian dressing and it was so good. Definitely recommend.

Good recipe. Super easy to follow. The only complaint is not being crispy enough and a little bland. I added some salt and chili powder to the mix for a little more flavor.

Easy and delicious.  This is one of my picky family's favorites.  I make a big batch and then shred or cube the leftovers to use in more recipes throughout the week.

This is a fantastic recipe. I found this recipe at 1900 hrs yesterday and completed making the chicken by 2100hrs- within 2 hours! 
Made some variations such as added a little of onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper,some olive oil besides adding heaps of Italian dressing.Marinated it for 40 minutes. Mixed bread crumbs and shredded cheese in a large freezer bag, added chicken and shook well so that the chicken is coated from all sides. 
Left it in the oven at 375F for 20 min and the last 7-10 minutes at 400F. 
Hubby and family LOVED IT! Would make again and again, and with different dressings each time.Would surely recommend it!

I did love this recipe, but not for it coming together. The breading fell off the chicken leaving the chicken to taste just like un flavored chicken. The breading did end up tasting like a mock stuffing and was pretty decent.

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe but was pleasantly surprised.  The chicken was flavourful and stayed moist.  Also much quicker then the traditional three stage breading.

I made this chicken for my husband and he loved it! The chicken was very flavorful, juicy and tender. I did like a lot of others and marinated the chicken in the italian dressing for a few hours before cooking. The only thing I've had trouble with this dish is getting the bread crumbs to really crisp. The bread crumbs on the bottom of the chicken never sticks. But overall the taste is great!

I'm beginning to learn how to cook.  With a picky 3-year-old and a husband whom I don't want to disappoint, this was a hit!  My daughter usually turns her nose up to meat (I'm not forcing her to eat it).  I was surprised that she cleaned her plate without any prompting from us!  I think it's because the chicken came out sooooo tender and savory.  To avoid flavor overload, I used plain breadcrumbs after marinating the chicken for about an hour in Zesty Italian dressing.

I am gluten intolerant which means I can't eat anything with wheat, barley or rye.  So I marinated the chicken in my own home made gluten-free salad dressing and before cooking I dipped in a gluten-free bread crumb + chopped almond mixture.  The last 10 minutes I turned the over to 400 degrees.  Chicken came out delicious.  My husband love it too!!

I make this dish all time. Sometimes I add marinara and melted cheese towards the end to make it an "Italian" twist. So easy!

This was awesome! I appreciate all the comments and suggestions that added to this already great recipe! I added a few tablespoons of melted butter with italian dressing and marinated the chicken for an hour. I baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for a 1/2 hour, found that the breading was still a little soggy, so I put it in the broiler for less then 5 minutes on each side. It came out crispy, flavorful and moist on the inside. We really enjoyed it! I did add some parmesan cheese, italian seasoning and red pepper flakes to the bread crumbs.  One cup of them is enough.  I also appreciated the suggestion of cutting large pieces of chicken breast in half.  Overall, this recipe was awesome and I will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks, Angela!

Delicious! I loved the juiciness of the chicken and the flavors lent to it by the Italian dressing. Recipe couldn't be easier. Definitely going into the "recipe box."

This was nothing too exciting, just chicken.  I would marinate the chicken overnight in the Italian dressing, then add the bread crumbs when and if I make it again.

I made this last night and it was pretty good. I made my own Italian dressing and marinated the chicken in it for a couple hours. Then I covered the chicken with bread crumbs and baked. Not my favorite chicken recipe, but I will probably try it again.

Phew! My children gobbled it up! Even the finicky 2 1/2 year old...she just scarfed it down. I used Annie's Naturals Tuscan Dressing. I also marinated it for an hour but longer would be better. I am impressed with how moist the chicken was. I cooked it on 400 for 30 minutes (the breasts were thick). I turned them half way through.
Thanks everyone for the advice. Will try parmignano cheese next time.

This was my first attempt at making a home cooked meal for my son. I am a single mother who just bought her first home last week. My son is almost two. He isn't the pickiest eater thank god but I have NEVER seen his tear through food like he did this chicken last night. He kept screaming More More. Thank you so much. This was the EASIEST chicken I have ever made. And it was tasty too!

Another easy yummy dish. I used reduce fat balsamic vinegrette (all that I had on hand) and added some pecorino romano cheese to the bread crumbs. I did pan fry instead of bake for a crispier crust. Served with tortellini and Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce from this site. A nice change from the traditional egg and bread method. Thanks!

This recipe was pretty good. I added an egg and a little melted butter to the dressing to help it stick to the ck and to make the crust a little crispier. Next time I will marrinate the ck over night to hopefully make the ck more flavorful.

Nothing spectacular. The crumbs were crispy and the chicken was tender...but there wasn't much to the flavour.

easy to do. bland to eat. i put this chicken over angel hair with a red sauce reduction and the breading turned everything into slop. dressing is good for marinating, but not for glue for the bread crumbs. (remember, you use oil to make things NOT stick to each other!)

I was so surprised by this recipe. It was really good! I used Caesar dressing and threw some Parmesan cheese into the bread crumbs and it was dinner! So easy. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks!

I made this last night and it tasted really good. Only bad part is that my husband hated it. I marinated the chicken over night so it was favorful and juicy.

Fantastic and very easy.  I like to cut the large chicken breasts in half for easier breading.  Also, I add additional seasoning to the bread crumbs.  Italian seasoning, Garlic Powder and a small bit of crushed red pepper are my favorites.

There wasn't anything spectacular about this recipe.  I couldn't get the breadcrumbs to stick to the chicken and the flavor was bland.  I won't be making this again, sorry.

Very very good. Normally for the four of us three breasts are good but they were all mad there wasn't more. It turned out great.

A great, basic recipe. Love the fact that I usually have all ingredients on hand. I marinated my chicken in the dressing for about one hour.

This recipes was great, and best of all easy. I marinated 2 ckn breasts in italian, and the other two in kraft three cheese ranch for a few hours. I also followed what the other reviews said about adding seasoning to the bread crumbs, I added parm cheese, italian seasoning,and garlic salt. The breading did come off when i turned them, so I drizzled some olive oil on the bare spots and put some more bread crumbs on them, Turned out wonderful! We liked the three cheeses ranch ones the best !

Even after marinating it in the dressing for a few hours and adding some spices it was still a little plain for us.  Quick and easy though.

Easy and the chicken was moist. I also added some parmesan cheese and broiled for the last few minutes. Thoought it was nothing special though even after marinating longer than suggested.

This was so easy and really good!  The chicken was moist and tender, but the bread crumbs weren't as crispy as I'd hoped.  I'll play around with it a while.  Also, I recommend seasoning the bread crumbs with Lawrys, Natures Seasoning, Garlic powder, parsley and basil.  Yum!

So easy and everyone loved it!  Even my 5 year old who is the pickiest eater I know.  I didn't even have to ask him, he just said "This chicken is REALLY good!"  If your recipe impressed my picky kids, it's 5 stars all the way.

Yum....I altered the recipe a little, that's the reason why I gave it only three stars. Instead a whole cup of italian dressing, I used 3 tablespoons of Hidden Valley Ranch, (the best ranch ever) and mixed it with one tablespoon of Kraft Italian Caesar and one beaten egg. The results were great! I feared a whole cup of italian because of how tangy the dressing is, I'm glad I decided to mix it a little. Thanks for the idea though.

This recipe has easily became one of our family favorites.  I have changed a couple things. First I leave the chicken in the italian dressing for about 15 min, then after the baking I brown the chicken in hot oil, makes it more of a chicken finger. Absolutely Deliscious!!!

This was a good basic recipe for nights that I'm in a hurry and don't have time to fuss.  It was tasty, quick and easy.  I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and I sprayed the chicken with a little olive oil after it was coated to give it extra crunch in the oven.

If you're looking for a quick and easy and tasty way to prepare chicken, this is it. The best part about it for me was that I had all the ingredients on hand, and if I hadn't I could have improvised. Half a bottle of vinaigrette with Romano cheese, the remains of a bag of garlic and butter flavored croutons crunched in the Cuisinart, and that's all there is to it. In a pinch you could make your own oil and vinegar, add Italian spices, and dredge in flour and Parmesan. Great! I'll make it again.

I thought it was good. The dressing gave it a lot of flavor. My husband did'nt like this one he thought the bread crumbs were soggy. I agree with him on this one. This won't be a keeper for my family.

Because my husband and I like recipes kicked up, I played with this one a bit. I added a packet of dry italian dressing and a pinch of chicken boullion to the bread crumbs. I also used Wishbone Robusto Italian dressing. It's a good dish to make for myself when I'm eating alone, too.
