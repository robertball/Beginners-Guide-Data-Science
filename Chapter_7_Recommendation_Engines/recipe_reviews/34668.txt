So good, but no need to  take so many separate steps. Just cook the carrots and pepper first, push to the outsides of the pan and add meat. Boil noodles at the same time, then add to pot when meat is cooked. Add green onions and stir. Make a hole in the center and pour in the beaten eggs, scrambling as they cook. Stir it all together, add desired seasoning and you're done.

This was really good. A lot like the stir fried noodles from the Chinese restaurant, but not as oily. I skipped the red pepper and added, instead, pea pods, bean sprouts,and water chestnuts. I also used 3 packages of noodles and only 1 packet of seasoning. The seasoning was just right. More than that would have been too salty. I don't know where they came up with it being 6 servings. It was just enough for me and my boyfriend and he's a big eater (and he would have like it if there had been more!) It serves probably more like 1 person per packet of noodles. Next time I'll use 4 packets and have leftovers! It was so yummy!

Everyone who was over for dinner loved the noodles along with my family, including a picky 4-year old and a baby! I did alter the recipe slightly: I cooked the veggies all at once as suggested by previous reviewers, and instead of using ramen noodles, I used "A taste of Thai" rice noodles according to package directions. They are a bit more filling and have no sodium, fat, or cholesterol. They went well with a grilled tenderloin, marinated and smothered in sweet and sour sauce.

Yum! I used one package of Oriental and one of pork, but I only used the Oriental seasoning packet and that was enough seasoning. I used maybe 1/4 cup diced white onion, 6 baby carrots (julienned), and I added about ½ cup sliced celery and 1/4 cup broccoli florets. I used vegetable oil instead of sesame, and I omitted the red pepper. It turned out really well! I saved time by cooking all the vegetables together. My daughter loved this, my husband enjoyed it, and I thought it was excellent. And cheap! Thanks Karen!

This was really easy and good.  I added shrimp which I wouldn't recommend...it made it a bit too rich; veggies would be just perfect.  I also took a shortcut by stir frying all the veggies together instead of separate.  Good recipe!

This is a great base recipe.  I kept the initial ingredients the same.  To make it better,  I added minced garlic, chopped water chestnuts, bean sprouts, ground ginger and Thai Chili Sauce   The Thai sauce makes it spicy.  YUM!  A fabulous recipe to be made to whatever you want to add to it.

This turned out better than I expected.  I used 3 packs of ramen for 3 people and there was enough left for my daughter to take to school the next day. I only used about 1/3 of one of the seasoning packs and it didn't need more.  We ran out of sesame oil so I used more vegetable oil proportionally and it still tasted great.  But it did take a long time to start getting crispy.  Next time I will use more than one carrot.

I would cut back ont he sesame oil next time. Also while everything is in the wok- i made a small sauce with cornstarch, chicken broth, and soy sauce- poured it over the noodles and veggies. Good starting recipe, definetly can build off this one. Thanks!

Only used 1 packet of the seasoning and a sprinkle of ginger. Also cooked the noodles only 1 minute. this way they keep their curly shape.

This was an easy dish and basically a variation of fried rice using ramen instead. It was alright but needed a lot more flavor. I used plain onion instead of green as it came already diced in a fajita blend veggie mix of diced onion and red and green peppers. I also used frozen mixed vegetables that I microwaved before stir frying. Not bad, but not memorable either. This was quick and easy.

This was really good. Nothing fancy but still very good. My kids love these noodles and it went well with lemon chicken tenders from this site. I was very careful to make sure i didnt overcook the noodles as i didnt want them to stick together during the drying process. Yummy!

It's very good. I also added mushrooms, snow peas, green beans and broccoli, plus 1/8 ginger. The serving is a generous dinner portion for 2 people. No way enough for six unless meant as a side dish? I now scramble the eggs separately from the veggies because otherwise the soy sauce turns the eggs brown. I also increased the soy sauce to 2 TBL and 3 TBL sesame.  Still takes me half hour to make, I think from cutting the veggies.

This is a nice alternative to fried rice when you don't have any leftover rice in the fridge. I made this as a side for bulgogi and grilled veggie skewers so I left out the veggies. I added sriracha, garlic, and cilantro instead. Very good. Will make with the veggies and some leftover meat for an easy 1 pot meal next time.

I decided to make this because it sounded so good. I cut chicken breast tenderloins into bite size peices and stir fried them. Then I didn't have peas (I don't like them much anyway) so I used just over half a bag of the pepper stir fry vegetables. Red and yellow peppers and white onions.  It was just so delicious I can't believe it. My husband loved it too. Next time I will use an extra packet of noodles. And by the way, I only used one packet of the seasoning packet, and it was perfect. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. It will be a regular meal around here. :)

This was really good. I didn't have carrots or peas so I used green bell pepper and broccoli. I liked the flavor the sesame oil gave it but DD and my niece did not. They also didn't like how the veggies I used made the noodle green. LOL Next time I'll add some other veggies for color.

We LOVED this!!! I agree, you don't need so many steps. You can just push your veggies aside, scramble the egg; and then push the egg aside to stir fry the noodles. I used one packet of the seasoning mix and about 3 tbsp of soy sauce. I did not have vegetable or sesame oil. I used sunflower oil for the whole thing and it was wonderful! One thing I seriously disagree about; this was not six servings. I'd say four servings, tops! My family of three ate every bite!

This was very good.  Next time, I might decrease the cooking time on the noodles to keep them firmer.

For those who worry about calories and sodium, just reduce or skip use of the flavoring powder packets. Add some garlic! Use chicken broth. Add mushrooms or other flavorful veggies. Shredded cabbage is excellent. Onions are great if you like them as well as I do.

This was excellent! I added some hot chili sauce to it and man it was good! I agree with a previous poster..you can do this all in one pan, and another poster that about half of the oriental packet was enough for three (but a whole one might be good with less soy sauce). Great recipe that I will use again! Thank you for sharing.

This recipe inspired me...I had some leftover medium egg noodles and roasted chicken in the frig.; and fresh broccoli in the garden. Also grated carrot, sliced green onion, minced garlic, some peanuts and 1 packet Ramen noodle oriental seasoning.  I use a soy sauce substitute called Liquid Aminos which tastes like soy sauce but is better for you.  And last but not least:  A generous splash of lime juice.   YUM.  Even my husband, who is a meat-and-taters guy, thought it was delish.  I'll be making this again soon !

This was a great side dish for the Orange honey garlic chicken on this site.  I didn't have enough packages of ramen noodles so I used regular pasta (speghetti) and broke it half b4 boiling.  I also added 2 cloves garlic with the oil to cook the veggies.  I used frozen veggies and they worked great!  I put a squeeze of lemon on before serving and we all really enjoyed it.  I agree with others to only use one packet of seasoning or it could tend to be too salty.  Thanks for a quick and easy addition to week night cooking!

5 stars for taste, although I found the whole procedure used to be overly burdensome and using a lot of extra dishes that wouldn't be needed.   I will make this recipe again, using different techniques.

Good basic recipe but try using some garlic and ginger while stir frying and a jalapeno and you will find the flavor much more interesting.

YUM!  Quick and easy...I did cook all the veggies together to speed things up a bit.  Next time I make this one I will use one seasoning packet (maybe a little less) and low sodium soy sauce.  Anything that my picky teenage boys will eat stays on the menu in my kitchen!  Throw in whatever veggies or meat you have on hand and make it a meal in a bowl :)

Wow, this was so good. Omitted green onions as I did not have any. Fried all the veggies together and added to fried noodles along with egg. This was seasoned just right.

I stopped mid-meal to write THIS IS OUT OF SIGHT!!!!
I added celery, mushrooms, cabbage, peas, carrots, yellow onions, green onions, red bell pepper and eggs and seasonings. FABULOUS!!!! A side note- when you fry the noodles, add soy sauce to the pan about a minute or so in and the noodles will fry up real nice!!!!!! Served steamed white rice and pot stickers for sides:)

Quick, easy and wonderful. I used 2 packages of Shin Ramyun Noodle Soup (gourmet spicy, 4.2 oz.) instead of Top Ramen. I sauted a sliced sweet onion first, pushed it to the side of the pan, then sauted the other vegetables. I substituted celery sliced on the diagonal for peas. I thought the peas would make mushy leftovers and the celery added a nice crunch. I cut the carrot into matchsticks. I had ham to use up so I diced it, sauted it then added minced garlic. I  added sweet chili sauce at the end. This is my kind of comfort food.

Although this recipe looks really tasty, it's not something I would prepare for my family given the number of calories and the amount of sodium contained in each package of instant ramen noodles.

This was excellent.  To speed things I did not fry everything individually.  I fix it every week now.  It is a real keeper.

I added 1/2 lb. sirlion steak (I tried pork in it once & didn't like it)to make it a main dish & used a 16 oz bag of frozen stir fry veg, thawed instead of fresh vegetables. Make sure you stir the noodle a lot while they are cooking to avoid clumps. This is a great meal for dinner & is even better heated up for lunch the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely amazing. The only thing I changed was I put some chili sesame oil along with the regular but it turned out beautifully. If you love a kick to your meal I definitely recommend that.

An easy and versatile change up from fried rice.   Cooked noodles, added frozen peas to the water at the last minute.  Stir fried veggies on hand, scrambled eggs in the same pan and then when cooked added noodles and one packet of seasoning (to three noodle packets).  Needed soy sauce, maybe use one more flavoring packet next time.

This is very similar to a Lo Mein.  We loved it. I did add extra soy sauce, extra seasoning packets, extra veggies, extra everything basically. We love lots of flavor and with a little tweaking it was a HUGE hit. It’s a do over.

Well, it was pretty  good.  I added chicken to make it a little heartier.  I would use chicken ramen next time, less sesame oil and more low sodium soy sauce next time.  Like other suggested, I put the peas, carrots and red pepper in a skillet together, added noodles after 5 min with oils and then the chicken and lastly the egg.  Not sure why we are told to cook and separate so many times.  You can use frozen peas and carrots to save some time.  All in all, thumbs up!

Very good, simple recipe. There is some latitude with which kind of noodles to use and I never have oriental ramen seasoning and end up using some combination of garlic powder,  ground ginger and garlic powder.

Easy and convenient recipe great as is, Sometimes ill just add a little more for my taste,   I'll add a tablespoon of minced Garlic and 12-drops Hot Sriracha sauce in the sesame seed oil and shred a table spoon Ginger in while panning the noodle before adding the rest of ingredients....amazing flavor.

Wow, this was terrific. I will never order fried rice in a restaurant again. I liked the ramen noodles better than rice.  Break up noodles & boil for 3 minutes, drain and then coat with sesame and veg oil immediately, before setting aside - so it doesn't clump while it sits   I  used 1.5 cups defrosted frozen peas,  1.5 cups frozen corn,  1 cup chopped white onion, 1 carrot, 1/2 cup red bell pepper, 1/2 cup chopped srooms, 1/2 cup celery, ginger and chopped garlic.  Sauted it all at same time  on high FOR JUST 2-3 MINUTES.  They MUST be undercooked so they are still crunchy when served.   Put it aside.  Scrambled 4 eggs until still wet and put aside.  Fried the 2 pkts cooked ramen in 2 T sesame oil, 1 T EVOO for 4-5 minutes (stir frequently) sprinkled with soy sauce & 2 packs seasoning.  Add vegs, stir and cook for 1 minute, add eggs, stir and cook for 1 minute.  I ate 3 big helpings!  Only 1 helping left over :(  Equally good with OR without adding meat

It was alright. A little oily, used to many pans. However I didnt have any soy sauce so that could have been why i found this just ok.

Had a bunch of veggies to use...didn't feel like fried rice and didn't have any cooked anyway. Followed the methods, but with a ton of veggies: chopped red onion, diced celery, diced carrots, chopped cremini mushrooms,  orange bell pepper, snow pea pods, spinach, green peas. Seasoned with soy sauce, one ramen noodle seasoning packet, House of Tsang Szechuan Spicy Stir-Fry Sauce, salt, and pepper. Yum!!!

DELICIOUS! So easy, and I especially liked it because it's flexible. I'm not a fan of peas, so I substituted it for green peppers to keep the colors (the variety of colors makes me feel like it's better for me) but I really love onions and peppers and sauted carrots so it was perfect! (I also sautéed them together - onions last)... WARNING - I suggest cooking the noodles last and adding them right after draining. I let them sit and they were all sticky and hard to blend without ripping to shreds (I fixed it by adding more oil and some splashes of water - meh), and be sure to hide the Ramen packages so it looks more complicated ;-)

Had to post a review because I now make this recipe all the time.  My son says the house smells delicious when I cook this.  To save time I usually just get a big bag of stir fry vegetables.  I keep telling myself that if I add enough green leafy things it's not too unhealthy! Maybe I'm delusional about the healthy part but it is yummy and comforting!  We like it spicy in our house so we add a little Sriracha sauce, and please don't leave out the sesame oil--it makes it sooo fragrant!  If you find that your noodles are clumping try cooking them for less time.  Don't cook them as you would for ramen soup.  Put in boiling water, turn off the heat,let sit for a few minutes then drain.  It works much better if they're not completely soft.  Thank you so much for this great, versatile, go to recipe!

I had some Chinese egg noodles that I wanted to use up so I made this recipe. This isn't 'authentic' Chinese by any means but it sounded like it would be good. I  followed the suggestion in the Allrecipes magazine (added grated ginger) and just threw in whatever veggies I wanted to use up. I had no seasoning packet because I didn't use instant ramen, and I think the flavour was fine without it. Probably healthier too.

Better than I expected.  Made half a recipe for 2 of us and wished there was more.  I doubled the veggies and used the whole seasoning pkg but no soy sauce.  DH really enjoyed it also.

I had plain ramen noodles from the asian market on hand.  So didn't use any seasoning packet.  I added minced garlic & ginger to the sauteeing vegetables. I sauteed shrimp and scallops in a separate skillet with some herbs.  This dinner is one I love:  I can feed my vegetarian stepdaughter and then combine the shrimp/scallops to the dish for the others.

I didn't care for the Ramen noodles, I prefer regular chinese noodles.  I bring some chicken or beef stock to a boil, remove from heat then add in the noodles (similar method as Minute rice).  Once the noodles are softened I add them to the other cooked ingredients.  Far easier and tastier.

This is such an easy dish. I've made it several times and the family just loves it. So versitile.  We've made it with pork, chicken, shrimp, beef, and all kinds of veggies:  carrots, celery, bean sprouts, pea pods, onion, broccoli, mushrooms, green beans - just be sure to start cooking the veggies staggered so you don't have some crisp and some soggy.

It was super easy.  I added precooked chicken to it and reduced the oil needed by using water and it worked out really well.  Im excited to make this again.

We liked this. It's mild tasting. I cooked the veggies together in seasame oil, took that out, then fried my eggs, I added a little caynne pepper,and soy sauce to them. It's nice and quick.

The kids really liked this dish.  I ended up adding only 1 seasoning packet and used the same amount for all other ingredients!  Will make again but attempt to get a crispier noodle by boiling for less time and stir frying longer.

Great easy recipe that looks like you did something really special. - I pre fried the eggs, stir fried the veggies (I would recommend using way more veggies than the original recipe)and boiled the noodles the night before so the day I served it I just had to  fry the noodles with the sesame oil and soy sauce and add everything else in - That way it was fresh but minimal work when company was coming. It got rave reviews from all of my guests.

This is a good idea for Top Ramen. I was a little nervous using the packets of seasoning as they are kow for a lot of salty taste but all in all it turned out good for a quick night dinner!

Great recipe for easy fried noodles!  I love having an alternative to rice for our Asian meals.  Not too hard or time consuming and definitely yummy! Update: we decided we really dont like the sesame oil flavor so I omit it.  Sometimes I make fried rice with this recipe, substituting 2 c cooked rice for 1 pkg ramen. (Save the leftover seasoning packet).

So good! I used Thai Kitchen stir fry rice noodles instead of ramen noodles though as they are much healthier and more hardy (I’m a big eater). I kept the other ingredients the same, but increased the amounts of everything since I made more noodles. I used the whole box of noodles and it made enough for 2 big meals (again, big eater so this would probably give those who eat less 3 or 4 meals).  I still only used one packet of the ramen noodle seasoning and it worked fine. Highly recommend!

There is no need to saute' all the veggies separately and I omitted the eggs and didn't see that it made any difference.
I used raw shrimp and cooked them in crab boil until they just turned pink then drained.  I broke the Ramen noodles up slightly as well which made eating them a bit easier. I would use about half a dozen green onions next time though and a little more than 1/4 cup red bell pepper.  I also added about 1/4 cup of a sweet asian chili sauce at the last minute which added a little more zip.  It's an excellent dish.

I used the simplified instructions of cooking all in one pain, starting with the pepper and carrots. Seems like a great way to use up small amounts of a variety of vegetables. Added cooked ground sausage. Lunch served! Definitely will make again

I made it with a couple of alterations. I add mushrooms and cooked them with the green onions. I also substituted snow peas for the regular peas. I added skirt steak that I cooked in a little soy, garlic, 1 Tbs sesame oil and 1 Tbs vegetable oil for about 90 seconds on each side. I think next time I may add water chestnuts and baby corn. Delicious... Even my pockets eater said he liked it!

The pepper was a nice addition to traditional noodles.  I used different noodles and season salt and didn’t have sesame oil which would have improved the taste.

I make this often.  I toss the flavor packet out and just use soy or tamari and/or teriyaki sauce.   You can get canned Chinese veggies.  I like to cook the noodles then fry them in a bit of sesame oil to make pan fried noodles.  Then add bean spouts, egg, carrots, onions, zucchini, eggplant and other veggies.  Sesame oil and soy are essentials to this recipe.  I can't believe anyone would rate this without the soy or tamari sauce or sesame oil.

Delicious recipe! I made it with different veggies ie canned corn and canned peas but still delicious. I recommend doubling the portions since it is so good everyone will want seconds.

I added chicken, used 6 packs of noodles but only 3 season packs. Perfectly seasoned and not too salty.

We are in love with this recipe! Made it as is. Made some minor changes. Adding Shrimp and mushrooms was great too! There are so many things you can do to change it up, but even the base recipe is wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

This is quick and easy. Rather than make the veggies individually, I buy a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and use that. Even quicker!

Only ok for me, I didn't have bok choy which I would have liked in it,  so I used some yellow squash.  I really had to doctor it up with seasoning to give it more taste.  Mine didn't look like the picture, it was more stuck together.  I don't think I will make this one again.

I increased the ramen to 6 packs.  I added lots more veggies and especially liked added spinach (in addition to the eggs and peas).  Zucchini, carrots, onion worked well.  I think the sesame oil was kind of heavy so 3 T was enough, but the full 6T of soy sauce was fine

Totally made it my own by making it so my 6 yr old would eat it and using what I had on hand. Basically, the noodles, olive oil,  cooked broccoli, thawed precooked frozen shrimp, and soy sauce. He and I both loved it.
I would have loved to put egg and other vegetables in it but I feared he wouldn't eat it. Figured I'd start simple and work my way up.

I have a feeling I have been making this recipe for years.  I quickly got tired of the ramin and flavor packet and kept adding my own veggies, sauces, and spices.  It is a fail proof system that falls together in minutes.  I sometimes add a spinach, or cabbage leaf.

This is a delicious dish. There is a bit of prep work but worth it. I think all the veggies could be sautéed together Instead of on at a time. This would cut back on the amount of oil used. I added crushed garlic and cremini mushrooms. A bit of pork, beef, chicken or shrimp would be a nice enhancement.

As another review stated, saute the veggies first, then fry the cooked noodles, push to the side, and scramble eggs. We used hot sesame oil for heat. The ramen seasoning packet has plenty of salt, so watch the amount of soy sauce that is being used. Overall one of my favorite ways to use ramen.

Great taste! I don't have a wok and the noodles stuck to the pan. It's probably better to use a non-stick pan if you have that instead.
I used only one of the spice packages that come with the noodles, which was totally sufficient. 
From the recipe, it was unclear, if you poor the oil into the mixed egg or the other way around. It's the other way around, poor the mixed eggs into the oil and stir. 
It's also not clear that this is rather a side dish. The amount of vegetables in the mix is so small, it just adds some color and flavor, but this is not a main vegetarian dish in itself.

Oh this was yummy! I've had bad luck with fried rice and this was a sublime alternative. I'm allergic to peanuts so I used vegetable and sesame oil. I used frozen peas and carrots and thawed in the microwave for 90 seconds at 50% and cooked as directed. My only addition was some leftover asparagus with garlic and cooked the noodles with one of the pork spice packets. I DEFINITELY recommend adding the garlic. Lots of it if you like it. Gave it a lot of oomph! I also added extra egg because I like it.

Pretty good! Only thing I didn't like was the sesame oil, so I made sure to scratch that out the seconds time around. I also don't like carrots as much so instead I added cabbage, bean sprouts sriracha sauce and a tbsp of sugar and it was super yummy!

I was actually surprised that this was so good.  I did add a cut up chicken breast. Try this.  I have made it twice now and we have really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Karen.

Great way to dress up a Ramen Noodle. My advice is to skip step 3 altogether. The green onions and bells are cut so small, the carrots are grated, and the last 5 minutes is perfect for the peas so that they don't loose their texture and bright green color. Plus, the noodles are already fried pre-package, they get fried again here in sesame oil, and  who needs that much oil? This was easy, quick, and flavorful and perfect for weeknights when time is limited.

Really good and easy!  Use only 1 packet of seasoning and cook all veggies together, make a hole in center to cook egg.

Was ok. Kids loved it. I added 1 tsp minced garlic, more onion, used frozen veggies, 5 pkgs ramen noodles & 3 flavour packets. I think next time we will add ground ginger, more garlic, more soya sauce, water chestnuts, baby corn & snow peas.

This is a good basic recipe as is, but their are numerous ways to change and improve this recipe. I have used chicken, beef  and pork in making this, at different times of course. You could add different types of vegies and sauces. Good job Karen.

Great base recipe, thanks! My young son even told me I should work at Panda Express, LOL. (It was a complement.) We are a family of 4. I knew 2 packets wouldn't be enough. I wonder if that is a typo? I made 6 packets of noodles! It made 5 generous servings. Another thing I did different was cook about a half pound of pork, thinly sliced, in garlic and onion. I think any meat would be good. I also forgot to use the seasoning packets, but it was delicious without them! Definitely will make again.

It tasted pretty good but the noodles were too sticky. Added some cooked chicken, carrots and mushrooms. Did not add the seasoning packet. Next time I will cook the noodles for less time and see if that works better.

This was so surprisingly good! It was just like chow mein at a Chinese restaurant, only better, I thought.   We added some tofu and it was delicious.   My only other comment is that the recipe as is was really only 2 servings instead of the 6 shown.

This was so tasty! I used 4 packs of the noodles (Itchiban as we don't have ramen brand here) it was just enough for 3 people!
I added some broccoli, pork and peas as well.

For what it is, I give it 5 stars! However, I was expecting the dish to be similar to Chow Mein and it was actually not.  Even so, this recipe was very very good.  I used Shin Ramen (Ramen noodles carried by Asian Grocers) and added shrimp and it was soooo good. I will definitley make this dish again!

I really did like this recipe. I took the advice of others and cooked the vegetables together. The only two things that I really didn't like was the noodles when I fried them, I was hoping they would be crispier but they were really soft. The other thing was the seasoning. I added two packs and (because I used 3 packs of ramen noodles) and I wish I would have added more because it was pretty bland. Otherwise, very goood will definetly make again.

I made numerous changes to this recipe.  I used some broccoli instead of carrot, white onion instead of green, and peanut oil instead of sesame, since that's what I had.  I also added some garlic and ginger puree to the oil before I cooked the vegetables.  I didn't know how much soy sauce to use, so I put in about 4 tablespoons or so.  Also, I added a little tofu in lieu of meat.

I'm rating this a 3 because without the extra spices I added, it would have been very bland.  I will definitely make this again, though with my improvements--and maybe with some ground black pepper, too.

Excellent Recipe!  I used green pepper instead of red.  The sesame oil gives a good favor.  I used a partial packet of seasoning and that was plenty. I was able to cook all veggies together in the oil as well. Will be making this again!

This is a very good recipe.  I had to use angel hair pasta because my ramen noodles had weavils in them, grrrr!  Also, I used frozed chinese vegetable mix instead of the fresh veggies to save time.  I also used stirfry sauce in place of the soysauce along with the seasoning packets from the ramen noodles.  My entire family enjoyed it.  That doesn't happen very often!

This was really good and fast too! I stirred all the vegetables in together with the onions though. The missing star is because I thought it would be "fried" but it was more like boiled and stirred in oil. But it was really tasty nonetheless and I would definitely make over and over again. I have been making these noodles for six months now and I enjoy eating them every time! I don't use sesame oil bcoz I couldn't find it in the grocery store, and I also use stir-fry frozen vegetable mix which cooks faster, i also cook them without the eggs. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe list!

This is good for a quick noodle dish but I thought the sesame oil was too strong. I think I'd prefer sauteeing everything in just regular cooking oil.

Although the stir fry taste was there I do not prefer the noodles. The noodles were just one big clump. I would much rather take the time to make fried rice!

I had this for brunch today and it was great! I followed another reviewer's lead and stir-fried all my veggies together (except the carrots ~ I didn't have any). I also added a touch of soy sauce to my beaten eggs before frying them. Quick, easy, and tasty. Thanks Karen.

Easy and yummy!  I added shrimp, water chestnuts and mushrooms to mine.  Will definitely use again.
