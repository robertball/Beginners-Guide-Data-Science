Used a gluten-free mix and added the spices to it. For the water needed in the mix, I used strong coffee. I repeated the coffee flavor by icing them with a mocha frosting also from this website. These were excellent and a big hit at our Hispanic themed dinner; kids and adults loved them equally. Thank you caroliney_ for sharing this recipe!

These were very moist and good.  I loved the flavors of the cinnamon and pepper in this.  I didnt have ground pequin powder so I used ground chile de arbol pepper and just a pinch of ground habanero pepper and it worked great.  Even my almost 2 year old daughter liked the bowl.  The spice is just right in them.  Thanks for sharing this unique brownie recipe!

my boyfriend and daughter loved these (I did too, but my opinion doesn't count in our house). I added a little more cayenne pepper to it and scaled down the recipe to make a batch of 20 instead of 30. Delicious! very reminiscent of my childhood on the border

Unimaginably delicious.  I used baking soda (didn't have powder) and regular cinnamon and regular, ground red pepper.  The spice is THE PERFECT balance of light enough but pronounced enough to make these taste like the most unique brownie.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips, as well!  Easily, my favorite brownie of all time.

I didn't have the mexican cinnamon so used my Penzey's cinnamon.  Also used cayenne pepper, it was all I had.  These surprised me as we made them for my son's Spanish class.  I made them in mini muffin pans and rolled in powdered sugar.  I really enjoyed the flavor, a little salty, sweet, and the cinnamon added a nice touch.

These brownies were great, I cut the recipe in half & used an 8x8 pan, they took about 40 minutes to bake.  Next time I make them I will use a better brand of cocoa powder & a little bit more chili pepper.

I couldn't find the pequin chili powder, so I used something called Mexican Hot Chili powder by McCormick. I used a lot more than the recipe called for (double at least- then kept shaking it in until I could actually taste a little kick) and more Cinnamon too. I baked it in a mini cupcake pan and topped it with chocolate frosting- I added the chili powder and cinnamon to my regular dark chocolate frosting recipe and squirted a dab on each. BIG HIT at the party I took them to! Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought they were delicious just plain but especially good with ice cream on top. I had to make them closer to 35-40 minutes though. They were not nearly done at 20-25 as the recipe says.

I totally cheated when I made the Mexican Brownies.  I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate fudge mix and added the cinnamon and some ground chipotle chile powder to the mix.  Delicious and SO easy!

Excellent recipe with a bite to the sweet taste.  I used cayenne pepper because that's all I had and it was delightful.  Makes a huge amount.

Wow! I'm a huge brownie fan, so I had to try this. I have what I consider to be a perfect recipe, but I'm always willing to try another. Since I don't have a 12x15 baking pan (I have a baking sheet, but I wasn't comfortable using it since I didn't know how much rise I'd get), I cut it to 2/3 so I could use a 9x13 pan. Well, when I did, guess what? It's my brownie recipe, with baking powder added. For those of you who like more fudgy brownies, just leave out the baking powder. 
I wanted to try it as written (though scaled down), and while I couldn't get hold of pequins, I did find a jar of Mexican cinnamon. By the way, Mexican cinnamon is also known as Ceylon cinnamon; it's milder than the cinnamon we're used to, without the bite and it's got some fruity notes as well. I also used Hershey's Dark Chocolate cocoa powder, so these are definitely not your grandma's brownies. These are wonderful brownies; since it doesn't have the bite, you are left wondering about that wonderful taste that's reminiscent of the cinnamon you're used to but not quite the same. Then you get just a touch of heat (mostly just a warmth in the back of your throat). And the dark chocolate brings a richness to the entire dish. Give it a try; you'll be glad you did.
Update: After making this recipe numerous times, I'very made a couple of small changes that make it close to perfect. First, I'very started using Chipotle Chile powder rather than cayenne; it adds a touch of smokiness that works well with the dar

WOW, these were good brownies! I made some with and some without cayenne pepper, and I must say that while I was surprised to find that I did like the ones with pepper (they weren't too spicy or anything), I preferred them without. But regardless - the texture is phenomenal! I love a dense fudgy brownie, and these totally are. Moist, rich, and soooo good. I lightened the recipe a bit to suit my own dietary needs by substituting applesauce for half the butter and using part Splenda for some of the sugar, and it still turned out beautifully. I've only ever made brownies from a box mix before; I had no idea what I was missing! Thanks for the recipe!

Just what I was looking for! I reduced the sugar by about 1/4 cup and used regular cinnamon and cayenne pepper because that's what I had on hand. Also, only had 3/4 cup baking chocolate so I added 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips. A perfect end to a cinco de mayo party! Thanks

Easy to make and I like that I could use ingredients that are commonly found in the kitchen. (We used regular cinnamon and chilli pepper since we didn't want to run to the grocery store) Awesome recipe! Thank you!

Great stuff!! The cayenne pepper was just fine. I used a smaller pan, and had to lengthen the cooking time quite a bit. I definitely will hunt for the right size next time. Thanks for sharing!

SOOOOOOO Good! I love chili and chocolate, and this was a great combo. The perfect balance, and I loved that the brownies were not too dense, I prefer a lighter brownie. I just used normal cayenne pepper and cinnamon and it turned out fine.

I've made this recipe a few times now and they have been a huge hit! The spices really bring out the chocolate flavor. Cinnamon and Cayenne pepper works well if you don't have fancy spices.

Pretty yummy. I scaled it down to 10 servings, baked it in a 9x9 pan, and subs. cayanne pepper as suggested. It taste really rich and yummy. I think I also cooked it for 35 min and it's still really moist and gewwy in the inside a day later. Lastly, after I poured the batter, I dropped chocolate chips  along the top for garish..

I may never make 'regular' brownies again! These had a great flavor with a hint of something different. Like many other reviewers I didn't have the Mexican cinnamon or the chile pepper that it called for. They were still good with regular cinnamon and I substituted chipotle chile pepper.

I made these for a Thank you gift and they were a huge success.  I didn't have the pequin powder so I used Pasilla powder.  The smokiness worked beautifully with the Mexican cinnamon to showcase the chocolate.  I do think they may be the best brownies I have ever made.  The texture was perfect, the taste was perfect and they cut so nicely.  Thank you, caroliney.

Awesome!  I used normal basic cinnamon and chili powder.  After it was in the giant jelly roll pan, I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of the batter and then baked it.  Perfect!  This is my favorite brownie recipe I've ever made so far.

This is an excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe as is, only difference is I had to use a 9x 13" pan so the baking took much longer (about 45 mins maybe) and I substituted the pequin powder with cayenne pepper.  The brownies came out not quite cake-like but not quite fudge like either.  Very moist and flavorful.  Not very spicy, so little kids can eat them too.  I will try to find that pequin powder because I want more kick!

Just made this recipe with the alternate ingredients suggested because I did not find pequin pepper nor Mexican cinnamon.  I will try the cayenne pepper next time. The Mexican hot chili pepper did not come through in flavor. I don't care for the consistency. Overall still a brownie and still yummy.

This is an excellent brownie. My latest version had 1/2 butter, 1/2 coconut oil. I might use an applesauce/coconut oil combination next time, leaving out the butter altogether . . . I could not find the pequin chile. The first time I made them, I used the cayenne sub - but it needs to be at least doubled. I want more heat to them. This time, I threw a dried ancho chile in my food processor - and ended up using the entire thing [~4 tsp] - still not enough heat. I thinking next time I will probably use both the ancho and the cayenne. By the way, this is a moist brownie - and I think it would be lovely, even without the cinnamon and chile . . .

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday and it was very good. I didn't have butter in the house when I made this, so I used vegetable oil. I thought they would be too oily, but they weren't. They were good. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved these, the perfect brownie texture for us! I used ancho chili powder because that is all I had, and it came out tasting great! I'm taking an enchilada dinner to a friend who is recovering from surgery and will be bringing these for dessert. I just know her family will love these brownies!

I am so sorry to say this....I really, really didn't like these brownies.  Considering how much I *wanted* to like them, the results were disappointing.  I love spicy food.  I love brownies.  Unfortunately, the combination didn't work for me.

These were the best brownies I think I've ever eaten.  They were super-moist and stayed that way for days.  They are definitely a more fudgy brownie and the cinnamon and pepper added a new dimension to plain brownies that is perfect for dessert after Mexican food (or anytime!).  I substituted cayenne pepper for ground pequin powder.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee.  I think these would be great as "plain" brownies without the cinnamon and pepper, too.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Making these for the second time. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were a huge hit. The spices were spot on. Flavorful without being too spicy.

Amazing!  I didn't have pequin.  I used Chimayo Red.  Everybody loved them.  Not too sweet, nice heat, and perfect texture.  Excellent!

My grandkids loved these brownies.  I made a batch for Cinco de Mayo and they were a hit.  For some reason mine always come out like cake.  Perhaps I need to reduce the amount of eggs.

These are just the best Brownies ever!

I had to use Chipotle Chile powder, it was the only one I had left in the house but they were amazing, my kids loved them, my husband loved them and they will be being made again. Thank you for sharing.

Won't make again because I don't like cake brownies and that is what this is.  A good brownie to me is moist & not dry.

These were awesome!!  I have so many chile pequins I don't know what to do with them all.  The majority of the company that I had over when I made these were hispanic.  They didn't get the 'mexican' brownie thing, but for me (a transplant from up north) the addition of cinnamon and chiles made them totally mexican.  Yum!  I just used plain cinnamon since I'm not a food connoisseur, I couldn't tell the difference.  Next time I would probably double the chiles though.  Either way, this is my favorite brownie recipe ever!  Thank you!!

Very moist and cake-like brownies. I used regular cinnamon and cayenne pepper, and I would probably reduce the cayenne a little bit next time as it came through a little too strongly. And it wasn't sweet enough for me, so I topped it with the Chocolate Glaze I from this site and chopped walnuts. My coworkers seemed to enjoy them!

Wonderful recipe I added a pinch of cayenne. Nice little bit of heat. Added a single pouch of espresso as it brings the cocoa to another level.

These might have been five star, but I made the mistake (for me) of using Hershey's dark cocoa, which I did not care for; it was sort of an overwhelming flavor.  I could not find pequin chile so used double the amount of cayenne, but the spices were still too subtle. Without the spices, and halved, this is very close to my go-to brownie recipe.  With regular cocoa the spices might have been more interesting, but I suspect the amounts just need to be increased for my taste.

This was good, though I'd only make it again if I needed a Mexican dessert.  So much butter!  Dang, it felt wrong making it!  Then 6 eggs???  More like a cake than a brownie.  I only had 5 eggs and it still worked out fine.  I only had regular cinnamon, which was fine and I used a scant 1/2 tsp of cayenne, which also was just enough to get the back end of spicy with each bite- not enough to over power.

I made this immediately after seeing it in the new AR Magazine. The only changes I made were that I used regular butter and omitted the salt. I also forgot the baking powder! (That's what I get for trying to multitask!) However, the brownies were still thick , moist, and relatively light.  They were very thick - definitely cakelike brownies as opposed to fudgey brownies. I thought next time I make them, I'd either halve the recipe or make two 9x13 pans and share one with a friend.

Even though I didn't have the cinnamon or chili powder listed in the recipe - I used what I had on hand, which was regular cinnamon and ancho chile powder - I thought  it was a great flavor combination.  I was looking for a chocolate and chili recipe combination, and I wasn't convinced the added cinnamon was going to give me the taste I was looking for, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Am making this again tonight for a potluck at work tomorrow.

I made these exactly as the recipe calls for and they were delicious. I love the mixture of chocolate, cinnamon, and chili. They were a great dessert after tacos for supper.

I made it with gluten free flour and cayenne pepper.  I found it an odd taste but am not a good judge since I'm not all that fond of chocolate - however, both of my roommates liked them.  One said it was more satisfying than a brownie sundae she had the night before.  I'll see how well they go today at work, I made them for a Cinco de Mayo pot luck.

So good! I use cayenne or my homemade pepper mix, but all you are looking for is that little kick. I make it in a 13x9 by changing the servings to 20. These go quick no matter where you take them!

Made these for my husband's birthday. He's not a sweets person, but does like a spicy chocolate. They disappeared pretty quickly!
