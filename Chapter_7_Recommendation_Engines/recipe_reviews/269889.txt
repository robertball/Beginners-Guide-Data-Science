When I make again, I may change the time, or remove the basket part way through to check the fries to be the way I prefer.

I have made these many times and they are always good. I make them a bit different but much the same.

First recipe in the air fryer. Made with sweet potatoes. Delicious, but not at all crispy. I did preheat, so don’t know what went wrong.
