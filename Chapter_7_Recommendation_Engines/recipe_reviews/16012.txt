I have know this recipe for years. It's really wonderful. I have never put hot peppers in it. I think it should mention you need to use a medium potato or a little larger and not to rinse the potato because you need the starch to hold the formedpatties together. I make them quite thick. It's a delicate recipe and has to be prepared correctly.

Renee's recipe was fabulous!  I've tried many salmon croquette/patty recipes, and this is by far the best I've tried.  I recommend this for everyone.

Excellent recipe!  I made it for a Mardi Gras dinner.  Yum!  I'm going to saute the peppers and onions next time, and kick it up a notch with even more jalapenos :) Note: the recipe makes 8 patties, not 4 as indicated.

Thanks for the recipe.  It had a nice flavor and makes for a fairly easy dinner.  I had trouble getting mine to stick together, so they were quite crumbled, but the flavour was nice.  Next time I'll try adding another 1/2 egg.  I sprinked dill/lemon seasoning on them when I was frying them and served them with lemon wedges.  Next time I might try some cajun or other seasoning to see what it is like.
Thanks!

We had major problems with this!  Patties wouldn't stay together.  Dry and bland too (which is surprising with the pepper and onion, which I sauteed in butter first, and jalapeno.  Served with Wasabi-Jalapeno Sauce.

What a trip down memory lane.  I grew up eating these made this same way, minus the jalape√±o, which is an inspired addition.  I made 6 nice size patties from this recipe.  Thanks, Renee!
