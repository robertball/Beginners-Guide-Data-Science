Delicious flavor, BUT I had a problem with the caramel layer seeping under the cream cheese layer.  So it was crust, caramel, then cheesecake and the nuts on top.  It still looked pretty good, but not as pictured.  I didn't anticipate the problem because I assumed the cheese layer would be heavier, and I did pour the goo on carefully, after partially baking the cheese filling as instructed.  Next time I will try spreading the cream cheese to the edges of the crust more carefully to make sure there's no gap.  Also, I didn't toast the pecans and there's no need to since you bake them 40 minutes!

This recipe is great!  The only changes I made were to make the cheesecake layer thicker  (because for presentation I wanted a thicker layer) I doubled the cheesecake portion of the recipe.  It came out perfect!  I think the other reviews  that complained of seeping between layers were unfortunate for the creator of this recipe because I had no problems at all.

This was good, but I have to say that I was disappointed in the appearance/flavor of this...Like the other reviewer, all of the egg mixture went under the cheese layer, so the top wasn't the 'pecan pie' I was looking for, and actually made the top a bit dry. It tasted ok, but I guess I was just expecting more...Thanks for sharing.

I know many were complaining of the seeping of the pecan mixture into the cheesecake. I baked for an extra 5 minutes with the cheese cake and used chopped pecans (3 cups) and had no seeping! Worked like a charm!

I doubled the cheesecake part and even let it cook a little longer to attempt to keep the pecan pie mix from seeping into the cake. It was fine when I put the pecans on top but as soon as I poured on the goo it immediately seeped through the cheesecake layer. It looked decent when it was finished but the consistency was horrible. The goo was all at the bottom, the cheesecake itself tasted like scrambled eggs and then there were just pecans on top. Some of the guests were nice and said it was "ok"
