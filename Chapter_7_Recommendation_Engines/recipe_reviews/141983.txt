This is a great recipe! The family loved it! It's quick and easy. The only things I changed was due to it being too tangy I added 1/4 cup white granulated sugar, I omitted the salt and worcestershire sauce and added 1 tablespoon minced garlic instead. I let it simmer for about 45 mins and it turned out great! Thanks for a great recipe...I will be making this again!

Good recipe. A lot of ketchup, but turns out very good. To make it a little spicier, I added a teaspoon of cayenne powder. I let it simmer for one hour and made it one day before. The meat became more 'sticky' after half an hour simmer.

These were very tasty, very saucy, almost too saucey though... I had to simmer this 45 min to get it reduced/thickened. Plus it needed the time for the flavor to develop. Tangy flavor, zesty with some zing but not too spicy, or sweet or tomatoey, a nice blend of all. I scaled this back to 1 lb of beef. I used 2 Tbl dried minced onion and 2 heaping Tbl. of diced pimento pepper in the jar, Head Country bbq sauce, which didn't have hickory so I put in a couple of drops of mesquite liquid smoke (the only kind I had on hand). I used about a half tsp of sea salt, 1/4 tsp celery salt, and 5 or 6 grinds of black pepper and a tsp of paprika to go with the pimento since I didn't use fresh sweet red pepper. I buttered the buns and grilled them til they were toasty and golden, topped with sloppy joe filling and a slice of american cheese, this made a nice filling lunch and I had plenty of leftovers for another meal. ***These were even better after I reheated the leftovers. I almost gave this a 5 based on what I reheated, but the original recipe only says to cook these a few minutes and they certainly would not really compare with my final product. Fabulous recipe, I'll certainly use this again. Thanks so much for posting this one!

Yummy flavors!  I used 1 tbsp of tomato paste & 1 sm can of tomato sauce with 3 tbsp of ketchup.  Then used 1 tbsp of each of the remaining ingredients except BBQ sauce which I used 1.5 tbsps.  I also used a green pepper in place of the red.  Definitely will make again!!

Good recipe. Easy to make. Kids didn't like it. It is a bit tangy or maybe more the flavor of ketchup and I only used 1 cup. I don't think I will make again. We had lots left over. You could probably make 1/2 recipe for family of four or less.

As other have said, this is *really saucy*, I also let it simmer for much longer... Other than that, I didn't have parmesan or apple vinegar, but without parmesan and with balsamic vinegar, it was delicious :)

Along with all the ingredients listed I added 1 can of diced Tomatoes & only used 1-Cup Ketchup.  I also only used 1-lb Hamburger and replaced the yellow onion with dried minced onion about 2 tbsp.  Added some green peppers (1/4 C), black pepper, a few drops of Tone's Liquid Smoke.  Added a little water and just simmered away for a long time until thick.  Yum Yum.

We like a less ketchup-y sauce, so I used half hickory smoke barbeque sauce and half ketchup. I also added a tsp. of Liquid Smoke and I used dijon instead of yellow mustard. I also added 8 cloves minced garlic. My boys really liked these. I liked how these were less sloppy than your usual sloppy joes. They held together well, which a Mother appreciates. NOTE: The parmesan cheese was a nice touch. I didn't bother using the snooty kind, just plain old Kraft. This made quite a bit, filled eight big buns and there was enough for my husband's lunch tomorrow. Maybe ten servings, two small sized.

Pretty good.   A little too much ketchup for our tastes, and I used a bit less than called for.  Still, it was easy and quick.  Thanks for the recipe!

These flavors suited my personal palate very well.  There is a nice balance of tang and sweetness. Next time I will add a bit more apple cider vinegar and a bit more hickory flavored bbq sauce - because I like the smoky bite of the mixture!

This is a pretty good sloppy joe recipe.  I didn't find it overly sweet, but more on the tangy side.   I left out the red pepper.  And, had no problem with it being too runny or not thicking up.  Thanks!

I did make a few changes.  I did not add the bell pepper and I substituted tomato sauce and tomato paste for the ketchup.  But it turned out quite delicious!  We've always made my mom's old standbye recipe, and it was good.  But even she said this was excellent.  We will definitely use this one again.

This is great. my wife and i like things a little hotter so i tweaked it a little. we added 1 chopped jalepeño to the veggies. I left the liquid in to help soften the veggies and then drained (which i didnt see in the original instructions). i used 85/15 beef. i added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper. only 1.25 cups of ketchup and 1/4 cup of Sweet Baby Rays sweet and spicy sauce.  Finally we added sharp cheddar cheese. Great taste and even better the next day.

This was  a really sweet sloppy joe. Kinda tasted like a pulled pork sandwich but with beef. I did like it as a sweer sloppy joe but I also enjoy a more salty/spicy sloppy joe. If your looking for a sweet sloppy joe or a kids fav. This is it. I did add green, red, yellow peppers and a onion.

We really liked this sauce. I've tried a couple of sloppy joe sauces from this site, and this is, so far, my favorite. However, my boyfriend thought it was barbecue sauce and the barbecue was a little prominent, though i thought it was fine. I may play with it and omit or lessen the bbq next time to make it more of a sloppy joe sauce. We used ground beef and added diced bell peppers and canned corn. It was really good! I had mixed reviews on the corn though, lol. But everybody loved the sauce!

I made these for dinner last night and my entire house smelled while they were cooking. I think they smelled even better then they tasted. The only change I made is that I used a Mexican blend of cheese instead of Parmesan cheese. My almost 9 year old loved them and at 2 smaller sandwiches. I think next time I will add a bit of garlic and green pepper also but that is just a personal preference. Thanks so much for this recipe.

OK, but there are so many better recipes. It needs some Everglades seasoning.

This is delish and simple. Left out the parm, otherwise everything else kept the same. Came out perfect!

This was good but needed some changes. I found it too sweet. Will cut down brown sugar to 1 Tbsp. I cut down the Ketchup to 1/2 cup and even that was a bit much. I increased the Worcestershire sauce and barbecue sauce.  My husband loved it.

My family loved this recipe!! The only thing I did different was add extra of everything because I used 3lbs of meat to feed all 6 of us. I cooked it on my electric skillet, which cooks pretty fast and that's always good! I also added a little bit of chili powder just for a kick. I will definitely be making this again!!

My family loved it!  It was so quick and easy.  Even though we all like the tang from the  vinegar, I think that I will back it down to 2 1/2 tblsp.  the next time.

Delicious! The red pepper was so good in this. I only used about 1 cup ketchup because that's all I had, but will do so again, because the sauce came out thick--not too "sloppy" and very flavorful.

I like trying new sloppy joe recipes, and these were tasty.  I liked the peppers in there.  As written I thought they were a little too ketchupy and vinegary, I would cut those down nest time.  Easy and comes together fast.  I liked the parm cheese in there, different.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, Caitlin.

This was probably the best sloppy joe recipe I've ever tasted & certainly that I've ever made.  My husband liked it too.  We like our sloppy joe a little sweeter, so I would recommend starting w/ the sweet ingredients first & then adding the acidic ones like worcestershire & AC vinegar to taste.  I added way more brown sugar than the recipe called for.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce rather than hickory flavored.  I also omitted the bell pepper b/c we don't really like it.

My husband and I loved these sloppy joes. They had a definite 'tang' to the flavor, and were much better than the cans you buy at the store!
