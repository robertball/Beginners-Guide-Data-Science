This is the best zucchini bread recipe I have tried. We all liked the honey/molasses flavour, and the lightness. I have made it with currants, dried cranberries, walnuts, and pecans - a different addition each time. I keep a jar of applesauce on hand in the cupboard, and freeze the remainder once it's opened.
I use the fine grater attachment on my food processor to get fine strands of zucchini.

I made this for my office and the two loaves were gone in minutes.  I used light molasses so it was not overpowering and because I did not have plain applesauce I used chunky which actually gave it a little more texture.  I used the process of Dejourger (draw out water) learned in a recipe from this site for "abby's Zuc bread" that process really made this recipe light.  This was delicious and a real recipe keeper.

This recipe reminded me of when I was dieting and was making food that had low or no fat in it. Even if it wasn't that good you ate it anyway because it was low in fat and it was sweet. The bread was heavy and rubbery looking. The taste was bland. I think if you added some salt(maybe about 1/2 tsp.) and more oil and maybe less applesauce you may have a better tasteing bread.

I have made this recipe many times.  Our family loves it!  I did add 1/2 t. of salt to the recipe for a little extra flavor.

I was excited about this recipe because I love zucchini bread and was looking for a healthier variation.  I have to admit the flavor was good, even without nuts or vanilla (which I didn't have on hand).  However, even after baking for over an hour, the loaves sank and I found they were still partially raw inside.  Guess my toothpick wasn't long enough!  There was still enough "baked" in one loaf for me to enjoy, though.

My very first attempt at Zucchini bread and it was a big hit. My family and co-workers raved about it. Several asked for the recipe. My 1 yr old grandaughter can't seem to eat enough !! Great recipe, easy, quick and delicious.

Changed this up a bit....drew the water out of zuccini with salt as some suggested.   changed apple sauce to 1/2 cup  and added 1/4 cup plain nonfat yogurt.  Still used1/4 cup oil.   then I added lots of cinnmon, 1/2 tsp ginger and cloves.    Fabulous and will try it next without the oil and increasing the yogurt .

This tasted great!  I made it at night and didn't want to put hot loaves in the fridge, so I removed them from the pans (I doubled the recipe)wrapped them in foil, and left them in the turned off oven.  They were still warm in the morning for breakfast and were so wonderful!  Thanks!

My family loves zucchini bread, but not this one.  Ususally like molasses, but this recipe was really heavy, and had no flavor.  Threw out the 2nd loaf.

This recipe is too dark with molasses flavor kids just don't like.  It is a very heavy robust cake.  We did not like it.  Sorry

We omitted the honey. Part we baked into muffins. I usually don't like zucchini bread because it's so dry but this is yummy.. Part of it we deep fried in little balls and coated with cinnamon/sugar
