After making this over a dozen times, here is my edited version: when looking for this recipe, I was looking for a "garlic herb" sort of potato. I cut the potatoes into quarters but the cooking time for this recipe, as most people have mentioned, is WAY off. After 50 minutes or so, my potatoes weren't even close to being tender and the rest of my meal was about to get cold so I decided to throw everything in the microwave for 10 minutes- usually, that's how I make my baked potatoes so tender. PERFECT SOLUTION, and I highly recommend it. I now put the baking dish with potatoes, 2 TBS butter, generous drizzle of olive oil, and garlic, herbs, etc. in the microwave for about 15-20 minutes - not only does it taste exactly the same, but it takes a third of the time and your potatoes will be tender, guaranteed. For herbs, I just use 1-2 TBS dried italian seasoning. I also use concentrated lemon juice rather than real lemon. PS - Stir the potatoes every five minutes while microwaving just to make sure they're all coated.

These were excellent. I was missing the lemon juice, but had everything else. I did switch the cooking method up a bit. I had pretty decent sized red potatoes so instead of just quarters, I had to cut them in to eighths, maybe even a little more. I poured everything into a big ziplock bag and shook it all up. I then arranged the potatoes in a single layer on a cookie sheet. I baked uncovered at 375 for 35 minutes and they were perfectly tender. Maybe I cute mine smaller than others, but that amout of time was perfect, they were nice and brown on the outside and mushed just enough on the inside. If you bake on a cookie sheet instead of in a baking dish, I do recommend turning once about halfway through.

I love roast potatoes, I find that if you par boil first the roasting time is much less and they crisp up better.

The cook time for these should actually be about an hour-they are definitely worth the wait!

This recipe was excellent! I made it with T-bone steaks and green beans. My boyfriend loved the potatoes so much that he didn't even want to eat his steak.. which is amazing because he loves steak! The only change I made to the recipe was that I doubled the garlic sauce. It was great and it will definitely be a family favorite....2nd review.....we have been making this recipe for over 5 years now and it's still a hit!!  My boyfriend (now husband) absoluetly loves it.  I gave this recipe to my sister as well and it's a hit in her family too.  fantastic!

These were amazing.  I have not been able to find a good recipe for these potatoes.  I am glad to have finally found one.  The lemon gives this a really great taste and I did add more garlic than it called for, and it was great.

These potatoes are delicious, but cooking time and temperature are way off.  Mine took forever and I ended up raising the temperature.  Next time, I will spread these out in a 9x13 pan and bake at 425.

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this recipe.  I could have eaten the entire bowl myself! I used small red creamers and less butter.  I sprinkled them with Spanish smoked paprika from Penzeys for the final ten minutes, which put them over the top, flavorwise.  Thanks, Laura, I will make these often.

This is a nice basic recipe that can be altered to individual taste buds.  Personally, I liked the lemon in this, the hubby & kids really didn't seem to notice.  I had a few extra brussels sprouts that I threw in there, and they were so tender, as were the potatoes.  Great with pork chops, thanks Laura!

YUM!  The best potatoes I've eaten in a long time.  The lemon juice really tastes delightful!  I used half melted butter/half olive oil.  I will make these again and again!

I used 2lbs peeled Idaho potatoes rather than red skin.  They were very good, but they took much longer to cook than what recipe called for.  I cut each tater into about 6-8 pieces, but maybe next time go even smaller so they cook quicker.  I gave it the 30 mins covered, and then another 25 uncovered, and they still couldve been a bit more done.  Will make again!

These are great!  To ensure even coating I put all but the parmesan cheese in a bag and shook it up.  Dumped it into the pan and sprinkled on the cheese.  It took about an hour to cook though.  About 45 minutes covered and another 15 minutes uncovered.  They came out perfectly cooked and so delicious!

This is a 5 star recipe AS WRITTEN as long as you use the SMALL red creamer potatoes and cut them in fourths as directed and put them in the 8" X 8" pan, not spread out on a cookie sheet as some recommend.   This recipe gives soft, tasty potatoes, not crispy ones as some are trying to get by changing the cooking method.  Cook as the directions state at 350 - to crank up the temp higher will render the garlic bitter.  Do not use the microwave or boil to pre or post cook until you have tried this recipe as written.    The first time I cooked these, I incorporated some of the reviewers suggestions and, although good, they are not the spectacular goodness you will get if you just follow the recipe as written (if you use the bigger red potatoes, cut them into tiny pieces).  I usually add, subtract and modify recipes to suit my own taste and truly appreciate reading and incorporating the suggestions from reviewers but I think this is my favorite potato recipe - AS IS! (ok, I did cut up some chives after the roasting was completed)

This is the perfect potato side dish for so many different entrees.  They are wonderful!  I reduce the amount of butter to just 1 or 2 Tbsp. just for the taste and then add a little olive oil.  Sometimes I add some diced onion.  This is meant to be a basic roasted potato so no need to add a bunch of spices or the wonderful lemon and garlic compliment won't shine through.  Yum!

Just made thes for supper tonight. I cut the red potatoes into quarters and and mixed all the ingredients that the recipe called for. Put everything together in a casserole dish and covered with foil. Cook time states 40 minutes but it actually took an hour and 5 minutes. The last 10 minutes of cooking I put the oven on broil and took the foil off to give the taters a superior golden brown color. These were the best tasting oven baked potatoes our family ever had. We loved them!! Thanks for sharing this absolutely delicious recipe. Will be making this for a long time to come. Yummy !!

this is good but time and temp are way off. 400 degrees for an hour/70 minutes has always worked for us, if you like them roasted.

Unbelievable. The lemon gives the potatoes a wonderful kick, that isn't easily identified as lemon. They were (unintentionally) the highlight of the meal; husband couldn't stop eating them. They do take a lot longer to cook than the recipe states. After 45 minutes, I gave up, and popped the whole dish in the microwave for 12 minutes. Next time I will allow at least an hour for them to cook, and there will be plenty of next times.

Yum!!  These are SO easy to prepare, and I KNOW that I will be making these over and over again!  I made these alongside Marinated Grilled Shrimp (also on this site) and a salad and some garlic bread and it made for a fantastic meal!!  My roomates absolutely loved them as well.  I was a little bit worried about the lemon in the dish (not a big fan), so I only used half of a lemon, and I really enjoyed the kick it added!  It didn't taste lemon-y, it just added a little zip that was quite delightful!!  I doubt I'll ever use the full lemon...I don't feel it needs it.  And as others have said, it DOES need to be cooked longer than 30 minutes (I cooked them for an hour and there were still a couple of potatoes with a firm center).

We did not care for the lemon in this recipe.  I will stick with my regular recipe which is pretty much the same with no lemon and toss in a package of Concord Foods Potato Toppers and just a pinch of salt.

After reading most all of the reviews I decided to try this recipe exactly as it was printed. I loved the flavor and so did my husband. The cooking time is off somewhat. I let them cook for 35 minutes covered and they were still hard and undercooked so I took the dish out of the oven and microwaved it for 10 minutes ( any longer would have burned the parmasean cheese)then put it back in the oven uncovered for 10 more minutes. That did it. They were tender and delicious. Now that I know how long they need to cook I will try them again.

Love this recipe! Make as stated but do cook at 400 degrees and cut mine smaller to speed up cooking time. Have made with fresh garlic and powdered garlic as well. I also use a little fresh pepper and when I uncover them I add a little more Parm as we love it. My family really enjoys these and this recipe is quickly becoming a staple in our house. Thanks!

Didn't have any lemon on hand, so i skipped that. There was a lack of flavor for my taste. Next time I will use a little more butter and a lot more parmesan!

Very simple!  We loved them!  I agree with other reviewers that you either have to cook them longer or cut them really small for this temp/time.  I cut mine small.

These potatoes were awesome. I didn't change a thing and they were awesome. Maybe a little less butter than whats called for would be good... or some olive oil next time?

Made it just as directed. Very simple and delicious. I probably could have cut the potatoes smaller for a more tender potato. Will definitely make again!

Delicious, 'nuff said.  Only changed two things. I cut the amount of lemon juice to ½ and changed the cooking time.  After having read so many reviews saying that the potatoes were not done in 40 minutes, I covered them with aluminum foil, cooked them at 350ºF for 30 minutes, THEN I uncovered them and cooked them at 400ºF for another 30.  They came out perfectly.

I made this recipe a few times; it was always good, but I wanted a crispier potato.  To make this a five star recipe, peel the potatoes and parboil them. I usually always leave the skins on potatoes, but I learned that leaving the skin on will prevent crisping.  Peel them and parboil for about eight minutes.  Heat the butter (I put the butter in the dish the potatoes were going in and put that in the oven on the top rack while the potatoes were parboiling.)  The fat being hot when you add the potatoes also helps with crisping.  Add all the other ingredients (except the cheese) to the potatoes and toss in the hot butter.  Also, use an oblong baking dish as opposed to a square one, so the potatoes are more spread out.  I cooked at 425 for about 40 min uncovered.  Don't add the cheese until the end, and stir halfway through the cook time.  I never understood what people meant when they said that potatoes were crisp on the outside, but creamy on the inside.  Now I get it!  I also added fresh rosemary to the recipe for personal taste. This is a more time consuming way in which to prepare these, but well worth the effort.

These are really tasty but they take much longer than 40 minutes to cook.  Maybe they should be boiled a little first.

These are so mouth watering. I cut my potatoes real small and covered with foil. I cooked it at 400 deg. for 45 min. and uncovered at 350 deg. for 30 min. I would highly reccomend this method or else your potatoes will be hard or take hours before their done. I used fresh garlic. When it was done I sprinkled extra parmesean blend (with romano and other great chesses). Oh and I sprinkled parsley and rosemary as suggested and it looked and tasted great.

These are a huge hit in my house! My husband can't get enough of them! I wasn't sure about the lemon juice, but tried it anyway, and now I won't make them without the lemon juice because, I'm afraid it would ruin the recipe. They're also very simple to make! The only thing I add is a little olive oil since butter tends to burn off easily, but I still add the butter, as well.  Five stars from this family!

I cooked these at 350 for 30 minutes but they were still hard.  Cranked up the oven to 400 and cooked 30 more.  Took the cover off and baked for another 15 minutes.  Didn't have a lemon so I used 3 Tbls of lemon juice.  Topped with some green onions when done.  They were great!  Loved the little bit of citrus flavor at the end.

These were very tasty, but the cooking time is way off.  Either raise the temperature to 425F for 30 minutes while covered or bake at 350F for 1 hour then uncover.  The potatoes are very good though.  I love roasted vegetables.

WOW this was a big hit with me and my family. I adjusted the recipe just a bit... I used 4 big fat cloves of fresh garlic which equaled about 4 tsps of minced garlic, then I used more like 1/2 a cup of grated Parmesan cheese...  roasted COVERED for 30 mins in a 450 degree oven and then uncovered for another 20 mins. They were amazing.  I read another review that suggested just microwaving this dish. DON'T!  That would be a huge injustice as roasting the potatoes gives them that nice browned yumminess you can't get in a microwave.

This is an excellent recipe. What I've altered is I use the red mini potates as I find them easier to work with and better for portion sizes. I boil them for about 30 minutes, and then put them in the oven with all the trappings uncovered for another 30-35 minutes. I also use shredded parmesean cheese which I find is awesome but will try it with the grated parmesean cheese as well. Thanks for sharing this one!

You can always substitute white wine vinegar for the acid found in the Lemon Juice. 2 tablespoons is the measurement for the juiced lemon incase anybody was wondering. Yeah the cooking time needs to def. by a little longer especially at that degree maybe 375 for 45 or 400 for 30 min would probably be correct.

Perfect and delicious, even to my husband who has a distaste toward Parmesan =) The only thing I did differently was to use garlic powder because I didn't have any fresh garlic. Still delicious!

Diced the potatoes for faster cooking, added 2TBS Italian Seasoning, used lemon juice concentrate and shook everything up in a ziploc.  I omitted the cheese (mainly because I forgot) and they were fantastic!

Agree with everyone else. Cook about 50 degrees higher and for about 15 to 20 min longer. Plus Lessen the amount of lemon juice.

This dish is easy and really delicious.  My husband stopped chewing several times during dinner to say how much he loved these potatoes (very unusual!)

I found it took longer to cook than the recipe stated, though.

Nice overall flavors, but I needed to make some changes. I noticed that they were not cooking fast enough, so I had to crank up the heat to 450 to finish them in time for dinner. I also did not use as much butter-they didn't need it. I only used half a lemon because mine was enormous, and added a whole lot more parmesan cheese and some freshly ground black pepper. I might have added a fresh herb if I had had one on hand. We really enjoyed the lemon flavor and the texture. My boyfriend especially liked them. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe however  the timing and temperature was not accurate for me. I had to bake covered for an hour at 350 and then uncovered for 30 minutes at 375. Next time I will also double the sauce so that I can base the potatoes while they are uncovered.

This is an easy to prepare dish and i always have these ingredients on hand so it's great in a pinch.  I also add parsley to my butter mix before baking.  It definitely adds a nice touch and I think they look better with some spices baked on.

These were really good. I wasn't sure about the lemon but it was nice, not overpowering at all.  The garlic didn't really shine through though.  Overall we were pleased with these potatoes but have other favorite recipes we will make more often. Thanks for the recipe.

All around SIMPLE recipe. I could drink the ingredients added to the potatoes and leave the potatoes out. One major alteration to the cooking time. Cook for one hour- the potatoes were crunchy at 40 minutes.

Tasty but  inaccurate cooking time. I was skeptical of 40 minute roaster potatoes and after 40 minutes in my following directions to the letter the potatoes were as you might guess still hard...

Delicious!  The only changes I made is cutting the potatoes into large cubes instead of quarters, and I chop about half an onion and add it to the mix.  I also use an 9x13 baking dish, not an 8x8.  My hubby LOVES it, I make this often.

I thought it was pretty good, except I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than the directions said to.  When I tasted them after 30 minutes, some of the potatoes were still hard.  It had just the right amount of spices.  I thought I would taste the lemon, but I didn't taste it at all.  I'm sure it enhanced the flavor of the spices and the potatoes.

This was very easy and the results were great! I added more garlic because the family adores it, and more cheese because there is no such thing as too much cheese. Regardless, I read the other reviews and cut the potatoes one more time. I made the potatoes one day ahead and let them marinate in the seasonings inside a gallon size bag. Baked them at 400 degrees and 40 minutes later: Tasty taters!

This seemed like a really great recipe at first, but 30 minutes was not enough time to tenderize the potatoes! They came out really hard & I had to microwave them for a while so that dinner would be on time. I would recommend changing the pre-foil-removal time to something like 45-50 minutes, for better success.

Delicious recipe! I used the custom recipe by Sarah B. I added a little more garlic & some Italian herb seasoning & popped it in the microwave for 12 minutes uncovered, stirring occasionally. It was sooo good & it was super quick! Thanks!!!

Out cold great recipe. It was late I had a couple steaks and needed something good, and these potatoes far exceeded expectations! If you're looking for a quick home run side, this is it! Can't wait to have this again! Add some shredded cheese, sour cream and bacon bits and it is lights out great!

This is a 5-star potato dish as far as yumminess goes, but I have to give the recipe 4 stars because the cooking time was (like others have mentioned) way off. I baked covered at 400 degrees for 45 minutes, then uncovered at 375 degrees for another 30 minutes. Because these potatoes turned out so delicious, it was definitely worth the wait. Didn't make any changes to the ingredients. Thanks for sharing this recipe! We LOVED these flavorful potatoes! :)

Yummy though I did add extra Parm cheese to the tops of these as well as additional garlic.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes lightly covered, then 15 minutes uncovered to get nice and crispy.  Will be made a staple at our house.

This was a good base recipe.  Like other reviewers noted the time was much longer than noted.  The only thing I would change if I made again would be cut the lemon a bit. It had a good flavor but seemed a bit overpowering.

Very tasty, but definitely needs some adjustment to the oven temp/time. Cut my 'taters into eighths, and shook them around in a zip-loc w/ the ingredients. Discovered at 30 min, 350 deg., that they were nowhere near done, so I took off the foil and cranked it to 400 for another 20-30 min. til ... perfection! Fabulous crispy exterior, soft and buttery interior. This was a delicious new way to fix red potatoes (since I usually just do rosemary, sea salt, and EVOO) and I'm so glad to have tried it out.

We enjoyed these but I think I will lessen the amount of lemon juice or omit it all together next time.  You could really taste the sour in them.  I had to bake them for about 55 minutes and then turned on the broiler for 7 minutes to brown them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love, love these potatoes but only 4 stars because of cooking method.    They crisp up much better if parboiled for a few mins. plus it also cuts back on baking time.   Just a suggestion.

Fabulous!!!! I took someone else's idea to microwave for 20 minutes. I kept everything else the same. I had three adults at the table and the dish went dry. Only thing I will change next time is to double the recipe. This is the very best red potato recipe I have ever tried!

I didn't realize I was out of lemon juice until I went to add it.  So I cooked them without.  They were good, but I'll definitly use the lemon next time.  And I'm definitly cooking this again!

The need to cook much longer than the recommended time. If not they will be watery. I think that putting the potatoes in the nuker for about 10 minutes will help shorten the cooking time.

Loved this! I made the recipe exactly as stated and I put some fresh cracked pepper on top when it came out of the oven. The lemon is a must, and the flavor of it is very subtle, but it is what makes this recipe different.

VERY GOOD!  I used the other reviews for the following modifications - used 2TB olive oil, coated the potatoes in a ziplock bag then added herbs.  Baked 20 minutes at 450 degrees, turned them, then 400 degrees for 15 minutes more.  I made them with fresh herbs from the garden and they were wonderful

Probably one of the best Red Potato receipes I've found! Super easy to make and a huge hit with my family! Instead of cutting the potatoes in quarters, I sliced them into 1/2" slices.  They cooked faster and I was able to get more in the pan I was using (I'm feeding a family of 10, so I needed to use ALOT of potatoes and a large pan!) I used olive oil instead of butter and added more cheese than the recipe called for...overall though, this is a winner and one I will make again and again!!

I was looking for something a little healthier than this, so I used olive oil instead of butter and left out the cheese, but they are still amazing! I make them at least once a week. I usually follow the timing fairly accurately, but yesterday I left them covered for another 5 minutes of cooking, and then broiled them for about 10 minutes at the end and they turned out perfect.

Great recipe with very good flavor. I agree with the other cooks who stated that the potatoes need to cook longer. I cooked them for about 50min-1hr. I used the juice of half a lemon instead of the whole thing. The flavor was perfect.

I used the same ingredients, however I cooked the potatoes at 450 for about 35 minutes.  I sprinkled the Parmesan cheese on the potatoes at that point, then put them under the broiler until the cheese was bubbly (maybe 5 minutes?).  These were very good and I'll make them again.

Very good, would change the cooking time, I cooked mine for one our plus, and ended up putting them in the microwave at the end for about 5 minutes so they were just right. Good flavor though, loved the lemon!

These were very tasty!  I used small red potatoes and cut them into 8ths.  They cooked fine at the suggested temp, but I turned the oven to broil for the last 10 min to get them browned.  I served them with the Parmesan Tilapia on this site and a green salad and it was a great meal!

This is a fantastic recipe that is versatile and delicious.  I make it for breakfast with eggs and bacon or dinner with pork loin and vegetables.  I make it a bit healthier by only using a dab of butter and a tablespoon or so of olive oil instead.  The other reviewers are correct in that it takes at least 45 minutes to cook all the way through.  Enjoy this one!

These were great!  Tangy and cheesy!  I did cut the potatoes into smaller pieces and parboiled them for 10 minutes before baking.  They turned out fantastic :))  This recipe is going into my "keeper" file!

Really good - but only use 1/2 lemon and lots more parmesan (fresh grated, don't skimp here). I used sea salt and tons of fresh cracked pepper. Even better with fresh herbs like chives or rosemary. One more tip - halve the potatoes and place them flesh side down after tossing to get a lovely browned potato. I add chicken quarters and toss it all together then cook this way. It's killer good. Cook at 400 for 40-45 minutes.

This recipe is GREAT.  The only addition I made waas Mrs. Dash Tomato Basil and Garlic seasoning all over the potatoes--it makes the potatoes SO TASTY they can stand on their own as a meal!  The best potatoes I have ever made.

I was surprised that the lemon wasn't very strong.  It just added a nice little kick.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and turned the potatoes over half way trough cooking.  It also took about an hour to cook through.  My boyfriend was getting hungry so I turned the oven up 50 degrees higher for the last 10 mins.  They were very good, and were a perfect side dish to roasted chicken.

Very delicious. The best thing is you can bake the potatoes the same time you are baking other items at same temp. I did find I cut the potatoes smaller than quarters, so they cook quicker. The taste is excellent.BRAVO for another recipe for potatoes which I am longing for

A decent, simple recipe.  Only problem I had was that 30 minutes at 350 covered and an addition 10 uncovered didn't come, not even close, to cooking the quartered red potatoes.  It's closer to an hour at that temperature.  Unless you boil them first or put them directly on the heating element in the oven.  Good recipe though.

Ok - cooking time is really off but with a little extra time these come out so yummy it's worth the wait. My husband and I wanted to eat the whole pan but were able to hold off till the next night. They were just as good if not slightly better with a quick reheat in the microwave. We'll be making these again but will cut the potatoes into smaller pieces so they don't have to cook so long. The ones in the picture I posted took about an hour.

I would give this five stars for flavor, however as many previous reviewers have mentioned the cooking times are WAY off.  I wound up cooking it for 40 minutes covered and another 40 minutes uncovered.  They could have cooked longer, but the rest of my dinner couldn't wait.  Next time I will try increasing oven temp...maybe 400.**** Made them again at 400 degrees.  Still required a little longer cooking time, but much better.

Oh my goodness...these potatoes are so good!  My aunt made them for Christmas dinner this year and I ate a ton of them!  She needed to get them done quickly and actually did them totally in the microwave...about 15 minutes total cooking time.

Used 2 cups of cheese verses the recommended amount.  Everyone loved it.  Very good with steak. Timing on recipe was short.  Needed to brown for 20 minutes verses 10.

These are great; everyone loved them. I had biggern-than-baby red potatoes, and was leery of baking them first, so I put them in boiling water for 10 minutes, drained them, vacuum packed them and refrigerated them overnight, then baked. Because they were done ahead of my ham, I kept them in the oven longer, and they were very forgiving of the extra time/heat. This recipe is a keeper.

I am very pleased I found this recipe. I usually find red potatoes a bit bland, but this was a nice change.  The subtle garlic flavor was a hit with my family.  These are great with rosemary chicken!

Very easy and very flavorful.  Red potatoes have their own distinctive flavor and are complemented by the butter, garlic and cheese.

These are excellent as printed. Red potatoes cook much faster than russets or baking potatoes, so the cooking time is about right.  If yours aren't done, your pieces are too big!  I know the recipe says "quarter them", but some red potatoes are larger, so the idea is to cut them into small chunks.  Make sure, too, that you put them in a pan large enough that they can all touch the bottom, and at least one surface is exposed, for proper browning.  I have also made them with oil instead of butter (olive or canola), and that works well too.

Pretty tasty.  My family enjoyed this  for a side.   Unfortunately mine did not get the extra time they needed to crisp up on the outside  (the rest of our meal was ready and I timed these by instructed given time).  Will be prepared next time to give a little more time to the clock to get that little crisp bite.

This was so amazing and even better the next day... I did change the recipe slightly, I used the butter garlic lemon marinade twice before putting in the oven.... Then 20 minutes before it was done I put another batch over the potatoes ... My bf loved it

This recipe was okay except the baking time was much too short. I had to raise the temperature to 400 and add another 20 minutes to cook the potatoes through. The garlic addition was tasty, though. I don't think the cheese did anything much for the flavor and it seems to need an herb of some kind. I added a half teaspoon of cracked black pepper to bump up the flavor and yet it seems to be missing something. More butter maybe? Perhaps feta cheese instead of Parmesan would have been better.

I've made this several times and I absolutely love it! I've tried using bottled lemon juice and jarred garlic as well, but it really tastes the best if you use FRESH lemon juice and FRESH garlic. For those that said this lacked flavor, you *really* need to use lemon juice. These potatoes are PACKED with flavor. This is probably my favorite recipe for roasted potatoes. Anytime I make these for a get together or have company over, everyone raves over these.

Thought they were great!  I noticed many reviews say they did not have lemon on hand, I would definitely recommend making sure you have the lemon, added the 'kick' to the recipe.  I also found they went really well with some sour cream on the side ;)

What a great recipe!!  I changed a couple of things,  I used 2 cloves of garlic the juice from 1 1/2 lemons. I also added paprika and fresh ground pepper. Then I baked at 350 for an hour and 15 minutes then turned the oven up to 375 for the last 15 minutes and they came out perfect!! The husband wants me to make this more often for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Excellent, made it just as stated with the exception of heating it at 400 for 30 minutes. potatoes came out golden brown on the outside and soft and garlicky on the inside.  I can see where others would have problems as I knew 350 wouldn't be enough.  These are great, though. thanks for sharing!

Good and easy recipe!  I like when the potatoes are a little browned so I put them under the broiler at the end for a few minutes.  I would make them again as a side dish.  Thank you MARD11030 for the recipe.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes on here and have made it 30+ times. This is how I have improved on it. The first time I didn't have grated parmesan cheese, but shredded. I took the shredded and put it in a food chopper and roughly chopped. The next time I used the store bought grated. HUGE difference. I will now take the extra step every time to chopped shredded parmesan cheese! Also I put the potatoes in a preheated cast iron skillet (its a big one) and cook at 450 for 25-30 min stirring once or twice.

Very delicious! I would recommend cooking a little longer and stirring the potatoes a few times.  Mine started to burn on the bottom.  The flavor is great, I've made it a few times now.

I made these with Tri-Tip and the Green Bean Bundles and wow what a dinner!  I think that I may double it next time.  Everyone loved the potatoes including me but I would have liked them a little more flavorful!  Overall...these potatoes were a hit with my kids and a few of my daycare parents too!!  We finished our dinner off with Sam's carrot cake.....super yummy!

Really good.  I cute the pieces smaller and they cooked up fine.  I did broil them for 10 minutes in the end to crisp them up (turning after 5 min).  I didn't have lemon juice and I could taste where that was missed.  I used a parsley seasoned garlic salt and also cut up some sweet onions but those were the only changes.  Next time I'll carmalize the onions before I add them.  Really liked it.

Gave this 3 stars but problem may not be recipe but my cooking abilities. Follow the recipe, except I could not stir to coat the potatoes because the dish was too full (maybe I had more than 2 pounds of potatoes) and forgot to add the Parmesan cheese until I uncovered the dish for the last 10 minutes. Didn't really make a difference since I needed to almost double the cooking time before the potatoes were done.

These were wonderful.  I was looking for a nice variation for potatoes and this is definitely a keeper.  I used the recommendations for Sarah B. to cook them in the microwave for 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes and it tasted just fine!  I will make these again (this week)!

Good, we make them often but they take much longer to cook than stated. Usually I cut the potatoes smaller and they still take at least an hour.

Absolutely wonnnderful recipe- these will be a go-to side dish from now on. Anyone who is considering skipping the lemon juice- DON'T! It's a huge contribution to these potatoes. I cooked these at 400 and followed every other instruction to a T. Thanks for this recipe!

Very good recipe - but mine did NOT cook in 40 minutes at 350 even though I had cut them into sixths instead of quarters.  I ended up throwing them in the microwave for 5 minutes to finish them up.

This is really good and very simple to make. I followed Sarah B's advice and microwaved the potatoes for 20 mins, stirring every 5 mins. I also used lemon juice concentrate and poured some garlic olive oil on top of the potatoes before pouring the butter mixture. They came out nice and tender and so delicious! I will try it next time with a bit more garlic for my taste, and perhaps with variations like rosemary or italian seasoning. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are easy and yummy. I'm sure the butter is sensational, but I use olive oil and add the parmesan after the foil is removed. I also add fresh parsley or basil on occasion. I even do these on the grill in a disposible aluminum pan.

Loved it!  The lemon adds great flavor to the potatoes.  I cut my potatoes into 8 pieces to make them bitesize and took the advice from other reviewers to alter the cooking time.  I parboiled the potatoes and then baked in the oven.  I will be making this again.

these were soooo good! 5 stars was not enough! The only thing is I had to crank up the heat and bake them longer than the original recipe time. I also put in about 3-4 tbl spoons of lemon juice because I didn't have a lemon.  - will def. make them again!

I sliced the potatoes and used garlic powder instead of garlic and used salt and pepper. I didn't think my husband would like them and he pronounced them delicious and almost like dessert.   Thank you for a simple, delicious recipe!!

I LOVE these!!! What I found that works perfectly is to microwave JUST the quartered potatoes in the baking dish with a little bit of water covered in saran wrap (poke a slit) for 10 minutes and then follow the regular cooking directions. I love it when I make these just right and you can taste the savory combination of butter, lemon, garlic and parm cheese. Mmm.

Tragically, I did not read the other reviews before making these, and only realized when dinner was about to be served that the cooking time in the instructions is WAY off.  These take more like an hour to cook through, and my potatoes were quartered and then some.  I will take the time into account next time.

Cooking time aside, this is a really good recipe!  The second time I made it, I accidentally added a little too much lemon juice (from a bottle, since I had no lemon fruit).  It was very lemony, but still tangy and tasty.  So it's pretty forgiving, but I advise that you go a little lighter on the lemon juice end of things!

This is very good, I made it for Christmas last year. I didn't love the lemon juice, although some of my guests thought it was great with the lemon juice. I prefer simpler roasted potatoes, with olive oil, butter, sea salt, and pepper. But I would make these again for a special occasion.

Sorry, but this dish is not for us.  The lemon seemed to overpower the garlic and I always use more garlic than called for.

These are very good, i omitted the lemon juice and upped the garlic and added a little red pepper for a little kick, but they were great, i even ate them for breakfast with my omelet.

What a wonderful recipe for red potatoes!  I made mine in the microwave (cut them up into 8ths and microwaved for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes).  Also omitted lemon juice because I didn't have any.  The whole family loved these. Thank you for the great recipe!

Loved these.  I cut my regular red potatoes a bit smaller.  Maybe each potato into eighths.  Threw them into a glass bowl with a tiny bit of water.  Microwaved 10 mins, flipping them once after 5 mins.  After this I poured them into a 9x13 pan, coated them with the sauce and baked about 20 mins, broiled them the last 5 for some crispness.  Next time I will add more fresh garlic or some additional garlic powder for a little more flavor.  Great recipe!

It could have just been the oven I used at someone else's house, but these potatoes did not cook as much as I would have liked in the time indicated... and the parmesan turned funky in the oven. I would have waited on the cheese until just before eating. I ended up quick-cooking these on the stove after the oven didn't suffice. My boyfriend loved them, though. I will try this again, though, given the rave reviews!

Excellent recipe for red potatoes as a side dish with any meat. I quarter the potatoes and boiled them first to reduce the time in the oven. They were perfect!!

Great recipe!  They are just like the ones at a favorite restaurant of mine!  Followed the recipe exactly and they turn out great everytime!  I will try the suggestion of putting the potatoes into a bag rather than pouring the butter mixture over.  I think this will work much better.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I've made these a few times now and they're always pretty good. I quickly figured out that these can use bit more garlic and a little more salt. Also, extra virgin olive oil adds a nice flavor when used instead of butter. It's much easier if you "toss" the potatoes in a sealed container, it coats them nicely.

Mmmmmmmm. As a potato lover, these really hit the spot. Next time I will use a little less butter (there was a pool left in the bowl) and with the tang that the lemon gives it, you can cut the salt in half.

This was fantastic..I agree with some other users suggestions, hopefully this will help others: 1. I made with lowfat butter to make it a healthy side dish 2. I cut the potatoes thinner and put them on a baking sheet.   3. I put the potatoes to a ziplock bag and spread the mixture throughout.   4. I baked this at 350 for 35 minutes, stirring once half way through (dont' forget the Pam on the bottom of the pan!) and they turned out PERFECTLY.   5.  I added fresh cut onions to the mixture - I thought it added to the flavor.    I definitely will add this to my recipe collection!

excellent recipe!  I made this for my roommates and some friends and they all loved it.  It was very easy the only the I would have done different was boil the potatos beforehand because they took awhile to cook.  very easy and flavorful though!

Good.  Added pepper.   Baked at 400 degrees.
Tastes better with a little sour cream on the side.

I really liked these.  My kids didn't care for the garlic.  They thought it had too strong of a taste.  Maybe this is for the more mature palates.  I thought it was superb.

Delicious, and even better, easy! Cut my pieces smaller, and did cook for longer as previous reviewers have said. My husband, who is more a rice than a potato guy, declared this his new favorite potato recipe. I agree!

My family really enjoyed this side dish.  I will definitely be making this again!  I filled a 1.5 qt round baking dish with sliced potatoes, doubled the butter and garlic, and baked it for an hour covered.  Turned the oven off and let it sit while I prepared everything else.  The potatoes were perfectly soft and delicious.

This was different and pretty well received. We all agreed roasted red potatoes with crushed garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, red pepper and Italian seasoning is the one we will stick with.

These were wonderful.  Easy and delicious.  You can adjust the amount of garlic and the "doneness" as you like it.  I made them as a side item for Easter dinner today and I'll definitely make them again.  Thanks.

Excellent side dish!! I also added a few extra spices, but that's up to the individual. I'm sure the recipe as shown is perfect for most. I added a large red onion (sliced into rings and seperated) with the potatoes for extra flavor. This is a definite keeper in my house!! (Would have given more stars if possible.)

Made these for my fiance and I last night and they came out amazing, the lemon gave them great flavor (I also added some fresh thyme). Following previous reviews I cooked them for longer than the orginal recipe calls for - 30mins covered, 30mins uncovered, then 5mins under the broiler to crisp them up. I can't usually get my man to eat potatoes unless they're in french-fry form, but he loved these!

The potatoes were awesome.  My husband kept asking where I bought them.  He didn't believe that I actually cooked something so good.  I did boil my potatoes for a bit to get them softened up some. They were perfect.

After a couple times making these, I found that if you crank the heat to 400 and cut the spuds into 6 pieces, the baking time comes a little bit closer to what the recipe suggests.  My husband and I just love these potatoes and I always look forward to the leftovers as part of lunch or dinner the next day.

I just didn't really care for this recipe.  It took 75 minutes to cook, which is a long time for a side dish and trying to time the main dish to get done at the same time....  Not something I'd make again.

As others have said, the indicated cooking time is insufficient. I had to cook these for another 20 minutes for tender potatoes, nevermind "golden brown"(my quarters were about 1"x0.5"). The taste didn't particularly appeal to us. We prefer "Zesty Red Potatoes" (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Zesty-Red-Potatoes/Detail.aspx)

These potatoes were the best I've had in some time. I was a little leary of the lemon juice, but it turned out wonderful! I baked them for about an hour and 10 minutes and they turned out beautifully! I also added a small amount of Rosemary from my garden and extra garlic. They were tender and very flavorful. My 2 sons and husband LOVED these!

Very tasty potatoes!  I also pre-cooked the sliced potatoes in microwave, then added remaining ingredients.  We will definitely make these again.  :)

My husband and I really enjoyed these.  I cooked them at 400 degrees covered for 50 minutes and 10 minutes uncovered and they were done.  I also cut each potato into about 8 pieces or more.  I didn't have a lemon, so I used 2 TBS of lemon juice...I think any more would have been too much but 2 TBS was perfect.  I also used seasoned salt instead of regular and could've even used a little more.  Overall, very tasty and simple to make.  I will make again!

These potatoes are scrumptious, and the hint of lemon and garlic are what makes them so flavorful.  A definite option to basic baked potatoes.  The only thing I changed was the cooking temperature and the amount of time they were in the oven.  I baked them at 400 degrees, first covered for 30 minutes.  Then I removed the cover, gave them a stir, and continued baking them uncovered for another 10 minutes.  They weren't quite done, so I gave them another stir and baked them uncovered for 10 more minutes.  They were fork-tender.  I served them as a side dish to this site's Millie Pasquinelli's Fried Chicken.  Awesome meal!

I made these for Christmas Eve dinner because my boyfriend was joining us and he doesn't like mushrooms, which is in most of the other dishes. I've tried making something like these before and I learned from that experience; this time I parboiled them for about 10-15 minutes before baking. I did not use as much lemon juice, mainly because we did not have many lemons on hand. They came out great. I thought they were delicious and would be a terrific side dish for many meals. I added a little bit of parsley on top just to give it more color. A+!

So-so recipe. These potatoes took far more time to cook than specified, so allow for that if you cook these potatoes. These were fairly unremarkable potatoes, and I have had better recipes for the same thing. We will not have these again.

Like others I had to bake these potatoes much longer than the recipe called for.  I cut each potato into 8 chunks so they were more bite sized.  In all, I had to bake at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes and then I removed the foil and baked for another 10 minutes to brown and crisp them up a bit.  I had some fresh parsley in the fridge and I chopped that up and sprinkled on top which I think gave it a nice fresh flavor.  I also sprinkled some powdered garlic seasoning on the potatoes, since we all love the flavor of garlic!  Over all I thought these were quite tasty, my family thought they were so-so.  They just prefer mashed potatoes.

This was great! I really enjoyed it. I also make potatoes like this with fresh rosemary, garlic, olive oil, and onion and my husband like that better- but for me the lemon, garlic, parmasan combo was great. I never would have tried the lemon on my own, so thanks! I did find the timing to be off a bit though - upped to 400 and then baked 30 min covered and about 15-20 uncovered and stirred three times. Will use again!

Very good and different, nice and salty and the lemon adds a different flavor.  I didn't have fresh lemon so I added about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice and they came out great!  Par-boiled first so they'd cook faster and then ended up broiling at the end just to get them to brown and crisp up faster...potatoes always take forever in the oven when they are raw...best to either par boil or microwave to soften first, then crisp up in oven.  Love this new recipe to my standard menu of sides!

Great side dish!!  Perfect match for a fish entree.  I dropped the cheese and mixed in some red chili pepper flakes, doubled the garlic, and used cut up baby reds.  Very good and easy.  Perfect for when company is coming over for dinner.  Thanks!!

I increased the heat to 400 for this and then 430 for the last ten minutes, and they came out perfect.  I think 350 would have been too low for them to be fully cooked in the time stated in the recipe.  Needed salt, but otherwise very good.  I'll add more garlic next time, didn't taste much.  I thought the lemon was a very nice touch

The only reason why I'm knocking off a star is that the cooktime in this recipe is wrong, so I'm glad I read the reviews beforehand. I cooked these 30 minutes covered and about 35 uncovered and they turned out great. I used pre-made lemon juice (around half a cup) and just sprinkled the parmesan cheese on top without really measuring, until it looked right. We ate this with the Broccoli with Garlic and Cashews recipe on this site, and it made a great dinner.

I love new potatoes, and am so pleased that I have found another way to prepare these. The recipe was easy and tasted great. Agree with others, they need to ccok at least an hour at 350. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delightful side dish that my family loved. It was perfect with porkchops. I have two teenage girls who are so picky about what they eat, but they wanted more. Thank you so much Laura for making this meal a winner.

These potatoes were sooooo good.  I used extra butter, garlic and parmesean to make them really flavorful. I also had to cook them for about an hour (more than the recipe said).  Overall Very good though.

I wasn't too thrilled, but my kids loved these, so I'll make these again.  The cooking time really is off. They take closer to an hour to bake.

I tried this recipe for dinner last night. My husband and I loved these potatoes. They were very good. The only problem I had was they cooked longer than 30 minutes..more like an hour. And I cut the quarters in half so the pieces were actually smaller than called for.

This took much longer than 30 minutes to cook, and I ended up microwaving it just to get it done. It tasted good and was easy to prepare.

Very tasty and the lemon really makes it exciting. Served with a slow cooker beef & wine. You can add herbs to it for more flavor. I did follow the directions very closely (as a reviewer "turnuson2" suggested) and cut the regular red skins in small pieces, and put in a baking dish. They still needed 15 minutes more before uncovering. I finished it with the broiler on low to brown the tops.

Simple, absolutely delicious recipe! I have learned to not try new recipes when guests are coming, but I made a wise exception this time. I used small, fresh-from-the-farmers-market red potatoes, cut small, and I added smoked paprika and red pepper flakes, baking covered at 350. Contrary to the experience of other reviewers, mine were soft at 30 minutes. I allowed them to bake uncovered for 15 minutes more to crisp them a bit. My guests raved. I will DEFINITELY make these again and try some of the herbs mentioned  by others. I think I'll have the leftovers now!  :-)

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed. The potatoes were greasy and bland and it took 25 minutes longer for the potatoes to brown after uncovering. I won't be making this again.

After reading a couple of reviews, I added some Italian seasoning and turned the heat up to 375, left it uncovered and cooked for 30 minutes. I used new potatoes, so they were pretty small when quartered and we didn't have any of the undercooking problems.  I also added an extra teaspoon of garlic. Not only was the dish worth 5 stars, but the smell that filled the house was as well.

Fantastic recipe but it definitely needs to be baked at a higher temperature.  I am going to try it at 375 while covered and then increase to 425 when the lid is removed.

Very tasty. My only complaint would be that the cook time was off. After cooking it as directed at 350 for 30 minutes my knife still couldn't cut through easily. I put the cover back on, turned it up to 400 and cooked another 15 minutes. Next time I will allow for more time.

turned out really great, although I had to put back in the oven for like another 30 minutes as the potatoes were still hard.  I would next time put in at like 375 for at least 40 min.

This was a great start to some good potatoes. I did, however, have to add more salt and parmesan, and even a little oregano for a little more flavor.  I ended up cooking it at 400 degrees for 30 min and it still wasn't done.  I uncovered it then and cooked it for another 10 or more minutes and it was great.  My husband and I really liked that it had a better texture than boiling the potatoes and then frying them, like I usually do.  I'll make this again.

The potatoes were delicious once they were done but it took over 1 hour to become tender.  The rest of my food was becoming cold waiting for the potatoes.  Next time I will cut them up smaller and hope they get done sooner.

I made this exactly as written and they were just a bit firm. Also, my wife had recently purchased a new lemon juicer and I was surprised how much juice I got out of one lemon. So, the potatoes were a bit too lemony.  But in all, the flavor was really good. I like this as a quick prep method. Very good.

Baking time in recipe was far from accurate. I made without lemon juice (only ingredient not on hand), baked uncovered for 60 minutes at 375.  Turned out great.  I'll be making this often.

When I made this, the potatoes were undercooked.
I used potatoes that were 2-1/2 to 3-/12 inches big. The smaller ones I quartered and the larger ones cut in more pieces.  I think perhaps the recipe should have been more specific about the size chunks

After reading the reviews, I ended up cooking this in the microwave for 15 mins.  It worked perfectly!  I thought this was delicious!  I also added 1 T of italian seasoning.  Yummy!!!  The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the cooking change I made due to lots of complaints in the reviews about the cooking time being way off.  I will definitely make this again!

Love this recipe. Tweaked two small things, I used actual minced garlic oppose to what was instructed as well as since I figured there would be no way that these potatoes would be cooked in the time frame stated. I boiled the potatoes for about 15 minutes prior to cutting and coating with a little olive oil and the rest of the flavorful garlic recipe.

Fantastic tasting, the reason I rated 4 stars is because I did take others advice a microwaved for a few minutes (12 I think) first because I've screwed up potato times so many times.  I baked them 8 minutes, then 10 without the cover and they were so good...creamy texture not crispy and it was really delicious.  Lots of compliments from my family.  I used regular red potatoes frm the 10 lb bag.

Good, we enjoyed them. I used quite a bit more parmesan cheese. I'd make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the potatoes were not done after the specified baking time.  Also, there is too much lemon.

Made exactly as described except cooked in a microwave convection oven  so it took a little less time (set oven for 325 degrees F with 30% microwave power for 20 min covered then 10 min uncovered).  Came out perfect!

Pretty good recipe, was short on Parm and didn't cook it covered up in the oven. Loved the texture nonetheless, I broiled it last minute and love the lemon tang on the potatoes and garlic aroma.

OMG!! The only thing I did different was I doubled the cheese and lemon just because I just live lemon and cheese. This is by far the best Potato side dish I have ever had in my life! Tomorrow I am making 10 pounds of it for a large group of potato lovers! Thank you so much for this!

This cook time/temp is way off, which makes this recipe unusable for me.  It is very frustrating to cook your potatoes for an hour and they still aren't done.

Tried this and my guests cleaned their plates. I adjusted the recipe by using complete seasoning. In addition I also cut the potatoes in 8th's so the 40 minute cooking time to work but the microwave works well also. I just like my potatoes a little crispy from baking it instead.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe! I didn't have lemons, so I used concentrate. I added a small onion because we like the flavor, but it didn't need it. Perfect compliment to my main course!

Very tasty! I took Sarah W's advice and microwaved for 20 mins. Didnt use lemon or olive oil & they were great. I drizzled salted butter on them with italian seasoning, a little minced garlic, salt, pepper & parmesan. My husband and I enjoyed them. I will definitely make them again.

Really good. Out of LEMON JUICE so I used WHITE VINEGAR instead. Turned out perfect. Obviously added cook time like others said as well.

1 1/2Tbs White Vinegar is the equivalent 3Tbs Lemon Juice (1 medium lemon)

Loved it!  I was missing lemon juice but had lime juice on hand so used it instead.  Added my usual spices too - Basil, Parsley, pepper, & sea salt.  I used small red potatoes, & I like my potatoes not too soft & not too firm.  This cooking time was perfect for me.  The rest of the family loved them too.  :)

This recipe is SOOOOO yummy! My girls and I love it! However, follow the "most helpful positive review" about putting the potatoes in the microwave instead.  It really does come out amazing even though its microwaved.

Very tasty.  If you use larger red potatoes it will take quite a bit longer to cook.  Mine took an hour & 10 minutes.

Good and easy, but took way longer than expected to cook (more like 50-55 minutes).

This was a big hit!  I tweaked it so my son could enjoy it also - used non-dairy margarine and nutrional yeast instead of the parmesan.

Wow! This recipe is delicious!! I upped the temp to 400 for 40 min uncovered, then cooked it under a london broil for 12 min on broil and they were perfectly cooked, and enjoyed by all. I didn't have garlic, so I had to use powdered, and I used concentrated lemon instead of fresh. I just eyeballed everything and it worked great. This one will definitely be made again and again, thank you for the recipe!

wishing I had paid attention to the reviewers before I made this dish. The potatoes were excellent; wonderful flavor. However, the cook times stated are not enough; perhaps the submitter used very small red potatoes? This dish needs an hour, NOT the stated 40 minutes total, to cook.

Easy & flavorful; what more could you ask for? My husband, who will eat anything but likes hardly anything, actually said he likes them! And my 3 sons liked them as well. I loved the flavor the lemon juice gives, not really 'lemon-y' like you'd think, but very good! I will make these again! FYI they do take longer than the time posted to cook.

Good recipe.  I increased the number of servings to 16 and it took over 2.5 hours to cook.  As they were cooking, didn't have faith they would come out tasteful.  However, once they were done, everyone loved them!  About to make my second batch right now.

I agree with other posters, this took more like an hour to cook and we upped the temp to 400 towards the end of that. I mixed it with some veggies (squash, broccoli, bell pepper) and roasted it all together - turned out great!

These tasted wonderful however the cook time is a little off. I cooked them as the directions stated but the potatoes were just a little stiff in the middle but we ate them anyway. The sauce was sooo good. I added a little extra butter and garlic...yummy.

I loved this recipe! I am a potato lover, epecially of the non-fried variety. It came out pretty good for me. However, after a long day, I was too lazy to mince any garlic, so I used a no-sodium garlic/herb seasoning in place of the minced garlic. I used a little olive oil and then margarine spray in place of the butter.  I also did not use lemon juice. I thought the potatoes would be gross, but it came out yummy, even with all the substitutes. I'm sure it will taste twice as good next time I make it with the fresh, listed ingredients. FYI, I used baby red potatoes, and it cooked just fine (gas stove, if that makes a difference) in the time indicated in the recipe.

After only trying this recipe once, my husband and I love it! It was very simple to make, which is a must for us with our busy schedules. I used Sarah. B's modifications from her September 14, 2009, review of this recipe and it turned out perfectly. Thanks for adding this recipe that I can now cook for years!

Easy to prepare and not too time-consuming IF you parboil the potatoes before roasting them. Adding a little Italian seasoning to the butter mixture gives them a nice flavor.

I liked this recipe.  However, I did leave it in the oven for an additional 30 minutes from what the recipe writes.  The recipe should probably read to "wedge" the potatoes, not quarter.

Delicious - even though my son picked out the garlic, we all liked them! I used the microwave as another reviewer suggested and it only took about 15 minutes. Perfect for a quick dinner.

What great flavor and so simple!!!  I was very hesitent about adding lemon juice but I made this recipe as is.  All the flavors came together amazingly well.  Perfect for a garlic lover but not over done and to garlic-ky.  And as I mentioned, I made this recipe as is (I was in a hurry and failed to read prior reviews).  Even though my potatoes  cooked 10 minutes longer, waiting for them to brown, they were still not done!!!!  The rest of my meal was complete so we ended up eating them a little tough.  They were still great!!!!  Next time I will par boil them!  Be warned!

My husband proclaimed these "the best roasted potatoes I have ever made".  I mixed the butter, salt, pepper and parmesean together and then added potatoes and tossed.  (Didn't use the lemon, personal tastes)  My picky 11 yr old wants the leftovers for breakfast and offered to go out and dig up the rest of the potatoes (I used homegrown reds and tripled the recipe) so that she could have more.  LOL  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

A delicious new family favorite. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great. I've also made it without the lemon juice and it still tastes great.

The lemon and garlic combo was not very good.  It would have been better to leave the lemon out completely.

These are wonderful. I always boil the chopped potatoes for 10 minutes before coating with the butter mixture and baking. This ensures they will be tender and perfectly baked in 30-45 minutes. I also add 2 tbsp of thyme or Italian seasoning to give them a great flavor.

My boyfriend and I loved these potatoes. I made some changes after reading the reviews and they came out perfectly. 1) I cut the potatoes into about 1 inch pieces. 2) I added some olive oil to the mix. 3) We love garlic, so I used about 4 cloves. 4) I substituted the Parmesan for cheddar and cooked it on right at the end. 5) I also added some rosemary. I recommend you make these because I definitely will!

Prepared this just as written, using my own judgement as to when the potatoes were tender. I do not use butter (cholesterol), using Smart Balance instead. Removed foil at end and cooked a few minutes more until beginning to brown a little.  Added some grated cheese after removing from oven and let it melt.  Hubby and I thought they were very good.

Just FYI I used the method from Sarah B. below to make this. Made in the microwave and it was spectacular! You could tweak this so much to your own tastes but I just like mine as a garlic and herb type.

Great garlicky flavor and nice dish overall. I baked mine for 45 minutes and they still needed more time. Maybe I was supposed to stir them once during baking? It didn't indicate such. Anyway, other than that some of them could have used a little more cook time, the flavor was great and I would fix this again. I didn't have butter so I used some olive oil, but only a couple of T.

I expected one of those boring flavored baked potatoes, guess what...this recipe is not. It is unbelieveably good. Your taste bud will id every ingredient! I took the advice of other reviewers, and boiled the potatoes (the small ones, quartered) for 5 min, then baked covered for 30 min, and lastly baked uncovered until roasted brown. This is a keeper. Thx.

I LOVED these potatoes. However I put them in a ceramic dish, & poured the (premixed) liquid ingredients over them, & put them in the microwave for several minutes, then finished them in the oven for at least 40 mins, & many were still not done.  I had them chopped pretty small, too. I think I will seal with plastic wrap in the microwave next time, to allow for some steaming.   I sprinkled chopped fresh parsley over the top before serving & that was a nice addition.  We all decided that rosemary would have been even better.   We served them at a dinner party with a Lamb Shank recipe from Cooking Light, that had a lot of the same ingredients in it. Everyone raved about these delish taters!

My family loved these potatoes. I had to increase the temperture to 400 because it was taking them forever to get done. Took about an hour. Very tasty. I will definately use this recipe again.

These were good but like others have said - the cooking time is way off.  I baked them at 350 covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 30 and had to then put under the broiler on high for about 20 minutes stirring every 5 minutes or so. Great flavor and went perfect with my roast sirloin tip roast and roasted asparagus.  I will definitely make again but will follow the advice to bake at 400 - 425 or parboil them first.

VERY GOOD.... ADDED a good 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, changed garlic to 1/2 teaspoon of powder garlic, and used 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice instead of whole lemon.  Cooked at 400 degrees for 45mins covered and 15-20 mins uncovered.  Live at 5300 feet, so it takes longer to cook.  Thanks for sharing:)

Well as much as I wanted this to be good; it just wasn't. The recipe calls for 1 juiced lemon. That is three table spoons of lemon juice if you use the stuff out of the bottle. Which was too much. I think that if I ever make this again I will leave out the lemon and add more parmesan cheese.

Perfect side dish to complement all sorts of flavors! I just kind of eyeballed all the ingredients - I think I used four or five pressed garlic cloves, a little less than a tspn salt, two tablespoons lemon concentrate, olive oil in place of butter and I sprinkled with some garlic salt. I baked at 400* for 40 minutes but ended up broiling on high for at least another 30 minutes - and some pieces were still rather hard! Overall, an easy and delicious side.

My first experience making this recipe was not a good one, since the cooking temperature and time were way underestimated, not sure where that came from. I'd say 375 for 45 - 60 minutes. Also, 2 lbs of cut up potatoes do not fit in an 8x8 dish without being piled up, so I had to go the next size up, I believe 11x8.  This really threw off our dinner plans as we kept waiting for them to be done.  Also, the potatoes had a pretty good flavor, but they needed some herbs, maybe a tbsp of either thyme or Italian seasoning. I think I'll just forget it and find another recipe!

COOK LONGER for certain ! I cooked them for 1 hour and they still were not done...the taste was great and I really like the recipe, but 30 minutes is nowhere near long enough ...!

These potatoes are delicious! I do a few things differently, however.  I add a dash of Extra Virgin Olive Oil on the potatoes when they're in the cooking dish and stir around to help prevent sticking and burning and I use more than 1 tbsp Parmesan cheese.  I increase the cooking time to about 50 minutes, then remove the foil and let cook for an extra 10 minutes.  This seems to give them the perfect softness.  Everyone who's eaten these potatoes at my house have raved on and on about them.  Great recipe!

I added a bit more salt and put them in a bigger pan to spread them out.  They still took a bit long to cook than noted in recipe, but overall, very delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed another reviewer's recommendation of microwaving the potatoes and mixture for 20 minutes instead of baking, and then I finished off in the broiler. YUM!

This is a GREAT one! These were super yummy with great flavor. I used a little more garlic than it called for which ended up being a little to much so stick to the suggested amount. Some said that they had to cook them  longer so I cut  the potato in thirds and then halves and they turned out perfect.

These are my favorite potatoes.  I agree with everyone that it takes longer to cook than suggested. Warm the potatoes in the microwave first to soften them. The lemon juice is a must.  I add either parsley flakes or rosemary.

I found this recipe online yesterday and made it for last nights dinner to go with a Pork Tenderloin.  They were so good everyone had 2nds and some had 3rd helpings!!! I did take the advice of previous cooks and baked them much longer about 1-1/2 hrs.  The last 15 minutes at 450.  They were very tender and a little crispy on the outside.  I will be serving them again in the near future I'm sure.

These potatoes were so awesome!  I made them for guests and then made them again later in the week.  These will definitely be my go-to potatoes from now on.  They were easy and so yummy.  Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have any trouble with the cooking time.

our new favorite!  I did just one pound of potatoes, cut all the ingredients in half.  potatoes ended up in about 1 inch pieces and I steamed them for maybe 10-11 minutes as someone else suggested.  Tossed them in the butter mixture (got ahead of myself when cooking and put the parmesan right in with the butter, lemon, etc) then broiled in the toaster oven for about 12 minutes.  My husband is still raving about them, and believe me that is rare!  so I happily rate this 5 stars.  Next time I think I will try cutting the potatoes into bite size pieces and doing everything the same as I did this time, except the cook times would be somewhat less.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!!!!!!!  oh yes, and I used 1/4 tsp (for the 1/2 recipe) garlic powder as I did not have fresh on hand.

These are really good!  Need to bake much longer than recipe says though.  I put them in a 9 x 13 pan the second time I made these so they could cook more evenly, I also turned up the oven to speed up the process.  Well worth it though.

I loved these! I was looking for a new way to fix red potatoes which is one of our favorite side dishes. I actually spread the potatoes out on a cookie sheet after reading another review and cooked it for 35-40 mins on 375 degrees uncovered. They were very tender and tasty. Next time, I will add other herbs or spices just to add a little more flavor. My hubby loved these potatoes and said they were a hit.

I am always on the lookout for new potato recipes  - made this for a Canada Day barbeque, and it was a popular addition to dinner. I made as indicated in the recipe, and the cooking time of the original recipe even worked. My red potatoes were relatively small, so they were cooked in the time indicated (and just to make sure, I raised the temperature to 375 degrees - which helped with the browning as well).

I will definitely make it again. I skipped the cheese since I have picky eaters and they still turned out great. Not the best I've ever had, but very good for how simple it is.

These are good for red potatoes (I'm not a huge fan) I wanted to add some color to my meal and tried these.  I would make them again.

These were great! Cooked for 1+ hour at 400 degrees, first 30 minutes covered. I added the parmesan when I removed the cover. I took some of the other reviewers advice and used half butter and half olive oil. I also substituted bottled lemon juice for fresh lemon juice. I used baby reds and garnished with rosemary, and they turned out delicious.

As other reviewers said, the lemon did add great flavor.  I used olive oil instead of butter, chopped the potatoes much smaller and boiled for about 10 minutes before covering with the marinade and baking.  Tasted even better the second night when re-heated in the oven because it got crispier on the top layer.  I'll make this again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I used italian dressing seasoning instead of the lemon juice.  I also cooked in the microwave for 15 minutes stirring every 5 and then baked in the oven for an hour at 350.

These definately need to cook longer and I even cranked up the heat to 375 for a crispier finish.  Too much butter and can also easily sub with olive oil or mix the two.  I don't understand the addition of the tiny amount of parmesan - I didn't even taste it. Certainly not necessary...I would suggest if you want that flavor to add more and do it toward the end of the cooking time.  I added some chili powder and loved the lemon juice.  You can easily add chopped garlic and onion wedges for additional flavor.

These were good. I think I would up the amount of parm on them next time, but other than that they were yummy and turned out beautifully. Thanks for the great dinner addition!

I thought this was a good recipe.  I really like a lot of flavor so next time I think that I will add some italian seasoning to them also or maybe just some salt and pepper. They were good though.

This was a simple yet very tasty side dish. As other reviewers mentionned the cooking time is longer than posted. I had the potatoes in the oven covered for almost an hour. I also increased the amount of cheese and added italian seasoning to add that herbs flavor. Great recipe!

These were delicious!  We increased garlic to 3 teaspoons, used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, and increased the parmesan cheese to probably about 2 tablespoons.  Will maybe add some pepper next time.

This was delicious! I tried to make it a little healthier by using only a tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. I also added a little parsley for a bit of color. I had no problem with undercooked potatoes; they were done in exactly 30 minutes. Thanks! This is definitely a keeper.

Wow! I have to say I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, but I was looking for something different so I decided to try it.  It was really excellent and very tasty.  The only change I made was to use 3/4 stick of butter and added 1/2 teaspoon of thyme.  Also I did not measure the Parmesan Cheese that I had sprinkled on the top.  Will definitely make again.

Yummo! I could not stop eating these potatoes. The lemon juice and parmesan cheese is key! I made these along with the sage pork chops (awesome!) from this same site and my family was in dinner heaven. The only thing that I have to add is that I put them under the broiler for an additional 5 minutes right at the end to crisp them up a tad. Mine were steamed and well cooked but the broiler made them PERFECT.

Really easy!!  I read a lot of the reviews and this is what I did:  sliced the potatoes (about 7 largish red potatoes), put them in a glass 2-quart baking dish, then poured the butter, garlic, salt and lemon juice over the top as described.  Then added a splash of olive oil.  I microwaved them for 8 minutes on HI, stirred, microwaved them for 5 more minutes, then added the parm. (Probably quite a bit more then listed -- we loves us the parm in this house!)  The grilled chicken isn't ready yet, so I'll probably heat the potatoes another minute when we sit down.  These are very tasty, and certainly simple!  

Next time I'll do them in the oven, as I'm sure they'll be prettier and a little more uniformly done.  But I'm certain DH and my 3- and 5-year olds won't care...

Loved the flavor but had to adjust cook time.  Had to crank the heat (425) the last 15 minutes of cook time and broil for 5 minutes to brown.  Next time I will start off with a higher temp.

This was a tasty dish. I will say much too much butter. Next time I will probably cut it in half. I added pepper, which it didn't call for, but I thought it definitely needed it. And I baked these at 400 covered for about 45 minutes, then uncovered under the broiler for 10-15 minutes.

Cook for at least an hour. Did not brown in 10 minutes so I broiled for 5 minutes.
Grandma really liked these too.

Very easy side dish with great flavor.  I love recipes that only need a few ingredients.  I used bottled lemon juice and it tasted great.

Delicious - like the other reviewers suggested, I increased the temp to 400 and added about 10 minutes of cooking time. I used smart balance spread instead of butter just to make it a little healthier.

These were really yummy. I did take the advice of other reviewers and increased the oven degree to 400 and left them in for 1 hour (45 minutes covered, then 15 minutes uncovered). I did not have red potatoes so I used the golden potatoes I had on hand and it still turned out great. I put in some lemon pepper & thyme and added more Parmesan/Romano grated cheese when I took off the aluminum foil for the last 15 min. of baking. The lemon really gave it a little zing but not overpowering. This was really good and I'll definitely make it again. My husband suggested that next time I make this to cut the potatoes in smaller pieces (cut in eights instead of quartered) so it does not take as long to cook and grab even more of the flavor of the marinade.

These take way longer to cook, usually about an hour. However, they taste great and compliment many meals as a side dish.

We had these with chicken cordon bleu for dinner and enjoyed them, but felt something was missing.  I had added fresh rosemary sprigs in the butter and garlic when it was melting and then baked with the sprigs.  Still think it needed some fresh ground pepper and maybe some corse sea salt.

These are so good, but as others have noted the
cooking time is way off. Mine had to bake a total
of 1 hour and 15 minutes at 400 degrees to get
them done, but it was worth the wait. I followed
the recipe except I increased the garlic to 1 tbs.,
used garlic salt in place of salt, added 1/2 tsp. of
lemon pepper and 1 tbs. of fresh rosemary which
pairs nicely with the lemon juice, to me. A 5 star
recipe that is highly recommended!!!

Very good taste although next time I will only use half a lemon. I had to bake it for about 10 minutes longer than suggested to cook the potatoes through.

A very good recipe!  I sliced the red potatoes instead of quartering them, and they cooked more quickly.  Though I wish I had left them in a bit longer to allow the potatoes to crisp up a bit.  I used a small amount of crushed garlic instead of minced, and next time I'll use a bit more.  Very tasty!

For a long, long time I wanted to know how to make roasted potatoes and how I know.  Followed recipe exactly but baking time is 1 hour- no less than that.  I also cut up a bit smaller than quarters.  Thanks so much, Nerry

I made these the other night when we had family over and my family RAVED about the pot's!  My mother loved the lemon flavor in them.  She even says they are the best pot's she's had in awhile.  I think they were good but nothing amazing.  I will make again but not in a rush too.  But b/c my family raved so much about these i gave it a 4star.  I might have added a bit more cheese if i were to change things up.

This recipe was very good.  I did however make a few changes.  Used olive oil instead of butter and cooked them for about 70 minutes.  We're going to use the leftovers at breakfast.  I may try adding some spices the next time, it could handle some seasoned salt or extra garlic or onion powder.  Even chopping up an onion would be a tasty alteration.  Definately a keeper.

This was a great side dish.  We all enjoyed them.  I agree with the longer cooking time and I also broiled mine a bit at the end to make them a little crunchy.  Will make this again but I think it needs a little more spice...maybe a packet of the dry ranch dressing or some other spices.

These potatoes were easy and delicious.  I was a little nervous because lemon juice and potatoes didn't sound like a good combo to me but they came out great.  I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces to make sure they didn't take too long to cook.  I'll be making them again for sure.

These were pretty good. I had about 2 1/8 lb. of red potatoes to use up, a little more than the recipe called for. I made it exactly as written, except that I accidentally mixed the grated Parmesan cheese into the butter/garlic/etc. mixture, instead of sprinkling it on top of the whole dish. Like many other reviewers, I found the cooking time to be way too short (I live above 6000 ft.). After the 40 minutes specified in the recipe, a sample bite of a potato piece was hard and crunchy, like an apple. I wound up adding time, finally stopping at a total of 1 hour, 25 minutes! Even then, a potato piece or two were still a little bit crunchy. I never make baked potatoes, so I don't know how long they're supposed to take, but this dish barely approached the texture of baked potatoes. And even then, the dish wasn't yet "golden brown".
However, the flavors were wonderful. This was a little like a "shrimp scampi" dish, with potatoes instead of shrimp. If I make this again, I'll be sure to allow plenty of time for baking the potatoes.

I made these potatoes tonight for dinner alongside some baked chicken and neither my husband or I enjoyed the flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and the potatoes were very lemony and just tasted like they boiled in their own sauce.  The only change I made was to alter the cooking time as the potatoes took over an hour to cook.  It's not likely that we will make these potatoes again.

YUMMY! These were great for a dinner for hubby and I alone. I kept the recipe as is, but did cook about 45 minutes or so. I did try and cut mine a bit smaller, so that helped. Served with maple salmon, tossed salad and amish bread from this site.

AMAZING!!! I loved this recipe and I will make it more often! It came out so delicious... The only thing was I added some pepper. I had to leave mine in the oven a bit longer because the potatoes were still a bit hard. Maybe it was the pan I was using. Excellent I give this recipe 5 stars!

Really good. I used a couple tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter, and broiled for the last 2 minutes of baking to give a nice color.

i don't know what i did wrong but the potatoes didn't soften at all and they never got golden brown and i even cooked them un covered for an extra ten minutes. the flavor was OK but I nothing I would write home about. I used up the red potatoes in the pantry though so it served it's purpose I guess.

This was a wonderful recipe!  The lemon was so light and refreshing.  The only thing I changed was I quartered the potatoes, mixed all the ingredients in a plastic bag, added the potatoes, tossed, then added the parm cheese and tossed again before pouring into the dish.  I covered and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes, uncovered and cooked an additional 30 minutes more.  My husband really enjoyed them as well.  I will make these again!

These were really tasty but I think next time I would omit the parm cheese.  Overpowered the potatoes, I liked the ones that didn't have any cheese on them.

These were excellent.  I did cook them for 50-60 minutes at 375 and they turned out perfectly -- tender and flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone LOVES these!  I find them VERY flavorful.  I cheat and buy frozen red potatoes that are cut small into 1/8 I think (or they could be small red potatoes that are cut in 1/4).  The frozen ones already are flavored with salt and pepper, but I still follow the recipe exactly and maybe that's why mine turn out FULL of flavor.  I toss the cut potatoes and all ingredients (minus the cheese) into a foil grill bag, close the bag and shake like crazy until everythings coated.  THEN I add the cheese (I add extra cheese) and shake again until coated.  Then we throw the bag on the grill for 10-13 minutes on each side.  Before you put the bag on the grill, make sure the potatoes are laying flat so they all touch the grill (you don't want the bag to be bulky bc some potatoes won't get cooked).  We put the potatoes on the grill frozen (bag says NOT to thaw before grilling) and they still cook to perfection doing it 10-13 min each side.  Just watch it so the bag doesn't burn.  The best pieces are the potatoes that DO get a LITTLE burnt on the edges. . .they taste amazing!  The lemon is what sets these apart and makes them so unique and delicious.  Also, we use garlic powder rather than fresh because it's quicker.  We crave these and plan to grill them in the cold Chicago winter as well!

This recipe was yummy but based on the temperature and cooking time, my potatoes were waaaaay under done ... next time I will bump up the temp to 375 and cook for about 50-60 minutes ... we had to eat the potatoes after the rest of our dinner because they were no where near done after 40 minutes.

For some reason, the garlic turned blue when I added the lemon juice.  The taste was excellent, but the blue color made the potatoes unattractive.

These were tasty and easy to make. When I pulled the potatoes out at 40 minutes, they were only about half way done. I microwaved them for another 10 minutes, and all was good.

This recipe turned out very good. We don't usually eat large portions of potatoes, so I used 2 lb of baby red potatoes for 5 svg, & the ingredient proportions for 2 svg, plus alittle extra cheese. The potatoes didn't turn out to oily or lemony, & they cooked perfectly. Nice side dish, will make it again.

These taste AMAZING, but were a bit too greasy from the butter.  Next time I make them I will reduce it, or try using just a bit of olive oil instead.  Other than that, these were a GREAT and easy side dish!!  My picky boys loved them!

This for some reason did not turn out for me; the potatoes were not cooked all around and I did put tight foil around it. Also, the taste just reminded me of greasy butter. We ended up throwing away all the left over.

Liked this recipe a lot since I always have all the ingredients in the house! The only thing I changed was adding pepper and baking it for an extra 1/2 hour. the potatoes were still crunchy at 40 minutes (as per recipe instructions). will make again! quick & easy... and you can do this with much more than just potatoes!

As some of the reviewers suggested, I cut the potatoes in 1/8's and baked at 400 for 45 min uncovered. It turned out perfect!  This makes a killer side dish and I will definitely use it again soon.

We liked these a lot.  Used a higher oven, 400 degrees and baked uncovered for 1 hour.  I sprinkled them with sea salt and that really made for great flavor.

Delicious!  
But just like the other reviewers said, I increased the temp to 400 and baked 50 minutes covered and 10 uncovered.
It was a big hit with the family.

These were great potatoes.  I used fingerling potatoes.  Some were red and some were white.  I also used a bit more garlic than called for.  The lemon was such a lovely surprising flavor.  They did take a bit longer to roast, but I read the other reviews and planned for that.  Thanks so much Laura....I think this will be my go to roasted potato recipe from now on.

These are the best roasted potatoes I ever had.  Instead of parmesan, we added rosemary, and instead of lemon juice, we added olive oil.  The results were amazing!  We will make this over and over again!

Very good!  Quick and easy - I added onions to this as well and it was great.  I slow cooked these for 2 hours on 250 then bumped it up to 400 for the last 45 minutes stirring about every 10 minutes - the potatoes were perfect!!!  Wonderful flavor!  thanks!

Good potatoes, but I would prefer a little more flavor (in the form of herbs/spices).  I would reduce the butter by just a tad too.  But easy to make, and good garlic flavor.  (I doubled the garlic).  The other reviewers already mentioned it, but the cook time is waaaay off.  I upped the temp to 375, and it still took about an hour (I lost count, lol).

Believe it or not, I don't have regular table salt so used seasoned salt instead and everythign else as suggested. I've made this recipe almost 10 times already so I just had to post. I love this recipe. This was also a big hit from friends and family, everyone has asked for the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!  We like it with scant lemon juice, otherwise it's a little too tart for our tastes.    We also like Italian seasoning or dried rosemary on the potatoes.  Dill didn't seem to work with this recipe (it was an addition I tried).  An excellent recipe!

Good, but not great.  I only used 1/2 lemon and it seemed to overpower the garlic, even though I used 3 cloves.  I wanted it less fattening, so I used olive oil and baked it in my stone uncovered at 400 degrees.  Was ready in an hour. I used asiago cheese.  I put a couple pats of butter over the top when it was done baking and then put some parmesan on it.  Smelled great!

I melted chedder cheese and more parmesan on top at the end, which added to the flavor.  I also added italian seasoning and extra lemon juice.  They came out very lemony with a little more flavor but I wouldn't say they were that great.  The cheese really helped.

I'm sure it would have been good, but the cooking time was off. Potatoes were way undercooked.

These were just ok, nothing special. I didn't feel that all the extra flavors did anything for the potatoes. These were more work than just tossing potatoes in olive oil and garlic, but not as tasty. Won't bother making these again.

This receipe is wonderful.  The only thing I added was some shredded cheese in the last 10 minutes.  I allowed that to melt on top for the last 10, and it was wonderful.  If you love extra cheese, give it a try.  This receipe is now a family favorite, and VERY easy to prepare.

By far one of the most outstanding potato recipes.  I add close to 2 cups cheese instead.  Your guests will come running back for seconds and beg you for the recipe!    Absolutely outstanding!!

I thought these potatoes were pretty good.  My boyfriend enjoyed them and so did I.  The only thing is that I wish they had a little bit more flavor.

I loved this recipe!! I threw it together at the last minute and it ended up being my favorite part of the meal! I didn't have an parmesan, but it was good without it. I did sprinkle some rosemary over it - very good!! I cooked at 400 for about an hour.

This is a definite keeper.  The flavor is wonderful.  I substituted lime for lemon, because that's what I had, & the dish turned out very nicely.  The only negative is that my potatoes didn't cook fully, even though I allowed 10 minutes extra.  The key is to make sure that all the pieces match the quarters of the smallest potatoes.  Thanks, Laura, for a great recipe.

I cooked mine as the recipe said for 40 minutes, and since they weren't finished (should have read the reviews!), I cooked them uncovered for another 20 at 400 degrees.
Weren't ready in time for dinner, but tasted good reheated later.

Did a trial run with one serving before making for dinner, and they turned out great! I brushed the potatoes with olive oil instead of the 1/4 c butter for health reasons, cooked with brussel sprouts as others recommended, used a little less lemon, and cooked on 400 for an hour. The basic recipe was great though!

Baked red potatoes are always a treat... but this recipe makes the best red potatoes I've ever tasted. I did use a little less butter than called for but still had plenty to coat the potatoes with the garlic. Thanks Laura, for a tastier way to bake red potatoes!

The guys loved them but I think they were definitely too buttery causing them to stay soggy- I'll use less next time. I cooked for a little over an hour. With a few minor adjustments, I think they'll be great!

I added dried parsley before cooking and chopped green onions after cooking.  My daughter loved these she had sour cream on the side for dipping.  I think I'll add crumbled bacon next time too.  Lemon haters do use, you can't taste the lemon.  I cooked 400 degrees for 30 min. covered and 10 minutes more uncovered.

WOW! These were SO good.  As mentioned by others, they need to cook for 40 minutes covered and another 10 uncovered.  I added brussel sprouts and may even double the sauce next time I make these (which is this weekend for a family dinner!)
Thank you SO much!

This is a favorite potato dish in our home.  I omit the lemon - we don't care for it.  And of course, I add more garlic.  We add brussel sprouts, quartered, as well, if I have them on hand.  It takes about 45 minutes to roast and it even tastes great reheated the next day.  Super dish Laura!!

Not bad.  Could have used more garlic (I love garlic though).  A healthy alternative to mashed potatoes with all the butter, sour cream if you use it, and milk.

This recipe needs a lot of adjustments.  It calls for WAY too much butter, which makes the potatoes come out soggy with it.  Also, the cooking time does need to be doubled to an hour.  I personally thought there was too much garlic also.  I won't make this again.

Wonderful! After reading the reviews, I decided to par-boil the potatoes. My two sons, ages 12 and 10 loved them. My 10 year old kept saying how great the potatoes where, and he is picky as they come.Husband and I also loved.  The lemon adds a nice touch...different.  I Will be making again and again. Thanks for the recipe Laura!

These potatoes are great and we intend to make them again.  Definitely cook for one hour.  The flavors blend well, resulting in a subtle taste.

Well, I always modify my recipes, but this basic one was delicious! I only added dill to change the flavor a bit. I also used this with regular potatoes.

These potatoes were ok. I don't like red potatoes much but bought some when my boyfriend suggested it. They were a little dry and bland; next time I'll up the amount of spices and butter.

These are awesome. The lemon juice really amps up the flavor.  I left out the parmesan cheese,  don't care for it, and it was wonderful.  Also made again with added quartered onions and chunks of carrots. Highly recommend!

I liked the flavor it was pretty tasty but I found it took way longer to cook the potatoes than the recipe said. Next time I'm going to try cutting them into smaller pieces. Other than that this was a simple and yummy side dish it went great with our steak and mushroom dinner.

I could not use the cheese so I sauteed some shallots with the garlic and some seasoning, then I tossed the potatoes with that mixture. They were great!

I make this recipe A LOT and everyone loves it. I use less butter and roast them at 400 for about 1 hour. My Costco carries a bag of tiny red and white potatoes. They are the best for this recipe.

Oh so good, who knew lemon juice would add a spark to the taste. I cooked for 50 minutes.  At 375. Then uncovered for an extra 10 to crisp up potatoes. I also add a sliced up onion & extra parmesan.

Just made this. Added fresh organic rosemary to it. Potatoes needed more time. Could be my oven but I put back in, covered, for 15 more minutes.

I've made this several times and they do taste great. Cooking time is off though. After following the directions the potatoes are never brown after such a short time so I always uncover, stir, and bake for 30 minutes and longer of the rest of the dinner isn't completed. The extra time has never hurt the final results.

I loved the potatoes, but my family hated it. Makes me sad they can't enjoy potatoes made a different way. Oh well, more for me.

Pretty good but not fantastic in my opinion. Could taste slight tang of lemon. I didn’t have whole lemon so used lemon juice in bottle ((2T). Potatoes were garlicky and nicely browned. Husband really enjoyed them. I used the regular sized red potatoes and cut them in med cubes. Done in 40 min.

These were okay but needed more flavor. They also took closer to an hour to cook.

Definitely will make again. I used white vinegar (suggestion as a replacement) since I did not have a lemon and I used mozzarella instead of parmesan due to not having that either. It was still delicious. I also added black pepper to the potatoes.

I ended up putting heavy cream in it; would use more milk if I had any. They had good flavor, but were just really thick which is good if you like that!

Great recipe but needed much more bake time (and extra 15-20 min) to get potatoes golden brown, as the family likes them.

Love this recipe. I gave it 4 stars b/c I had to make some edits. I used 1-1/2lbs of baby medley potatoes, cut in half or quarters depending on the size. I also added brocolli. I mixed together 6tbsp of olive oil, juice of one lemon, a tbsp of Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and creole seasoning. I then drizzled this over the potatoes and brocolli, added parmesan cheese and baked, covered, for 40 minutes on 400 degrees, stirring after 20 minutes. Then I removed the foil and sprinkled more parmesan cheese and broiled for 5 minutes, uncovered. Amazing!

This was very tasty. I will make this again but I will pre boil the potatoes and cut the potatoes in smaller portions. The suggested baking time is way off and we had to use the microwave oven so they would be tender enough.

I liked them! After reading the reviews I cut the potato into 8 pieces, I cut the portions back to 1. Cooked in the microwave for 5 minutes and then in the oven for 25 minutes and under the broiler for just long enough to brown. Thanks for the recipe.

This is an easy and tasty potato dish, but ohhh my,..this cook time is waayyyy off! I turned the heat up to 375 and cooked it for an extra 30 minutes and that seemed to work. I don’t know how to even that out if I make it again, but if you make this, definitely recommend changing the cook time and/or temperature.

It was great per recipe.  It was AWESOME a day later when I reheated the leftovers in a cast iron skillet.  I added a little olive oil to the skillet, placed it medium, then, when the oil started to wisp smoke I added the potatoes.  I turned them as they crisped up on each side.  My wife and I enjoyed them even more this way!

I made red roasted potatoes on Valentine’s Day, but adjusted the recipe . Instead of 1/4 cup butter I used 1/4 cup garlic olive oil , and 1/4 teaspoon of dry Italian herbs and 1/4 teaspoon of dry thyme . I minced 1 garlic and melted about 1/2 tablespoon of butter, salt and the juice of 1 lemon and mixed with the diced potatoes in a bowl . I spread them out on a 9 X 13 baking dish and sprinkled them with grated Parmesan cheese . I baked them for about 40 minutes at 425 degrees. They came out perfect and delicious !

I think this recipe was OK because the lime a little out of place. I tried the recipe as is and honestly I think the lime doesn't really add to this recipe. It will be better of without the juice.

These were ok but nothing I am going to just be crazy to make again.  My family ate them but they won't be a favorite.  I cooked them at 400 for an hour and then 10 minutes without being covered.  30 minutes was no where near enough time.

These were delicious! I took recommendations from other reviews and cut the potatoes smaller and roasted for an hour. They turned out soft inside and nice and crispy outside! The lemon juice added an awesome flavor! I will be making these again!

Even my kids loved these potatoes. However, they were so much better with shredded Parmesan (or fresh grated). I read the recipe the second time and realized it said "grated", so I tried the grated stuff that you find on the pasta aisle. Not good. Shredded or fresh-grated is the only way to go. 
Also, make sure to put it in a single layer, and if your potatoes aren't teeny tiny, cut them into eighths and/or allow at least an extra 10-15 minutes to the covered cooking time.

St. Patrick's Day....and the recipes call for everything boiled.  Just couldn't do it for my potatoes and veggies (corned beef was in the crock pot for 8 hours).  So it took an extra dish, but it was worth it!   Made these in the oven to go along with the corned beef, ....made the carrots the same way.  WONDERFUL!  I was surprised...I'm not a COOK....but these came out perfectly.  HINT:  Roast the potatoes cut side down...REALLY important!  I added a little olive oil to the aluminum foiled lined pan....the potatoes popped right off and were brown and wonderful.  None left at dinner...all asking for recipe...SO SIMPLE. Roast carrots tossed in olive oil and your choice of seasonings, 25 minutes, with the potatoes.  Perfection!

30 minutes wasn't long enough though. The potatoes needed an extra 10.

the potatoes need at least 45 minutes covered to cook and another 20 minutes uncovered. I followed the recipe and the potatoes were not done.  

Other than that they tasted great

Very good; everyone in my family loved them. The hint of citrus was refreshing. I took the advice of other reviewers and upped the temperature to 400 but other than that followed the original directions.

First time making it, made it for two people, so less lemon, 3 cloves of garlic.  Time of baking is longer, otherwise the lemon in the potatoes was just delicious.

Delicious but his takes much longer than 40 mins. I cranked the oven up to 400 after 40 mins. and it took about 1 hour total.

Wish I read the reviews before...have  been baking for over an hour and the potatoes are still no where near done! And I had cut mine into smaller pieces- more like eighths. Had to eat the rest of the meal already.

These were really good. I didn't have a lemon so I added some lime juice (1-2 tablespoons) and I accidentally (thankfully) cooked the potatoes on 375 degrees instead of 350 and found that it was a good decision because the time on the recipe was way off. Even at 375 the uncovered baking time ended up being 30 additional minutes instead of 10 so it took an hour for them to be done. I also added extra Parmesan the last 15 minutes. Yummy!

I made these as one reviewer suggested in the microwave to save time. If I had it to do over again I would probably try the recipe as is. While the flavor was good in the microwaving method, you lose the roasted texture and flavor that way.

I followed Sarah W advice and cooked potatoes in microwave with all ingredients mixed in. You must make sure to turn them every 5 minutes so that all pieces of potato remain moist with mixture or else it will get a little tough... Tasty but tough. It came out great in half the time!

Im African American and the lemon in this flavor profile was too overbearing even with the extra clove of garlic I minced. The tangyness is not for me and I will not make again.

These were really good. Unfortunately, I did omit the lemon just because we had company coming over for dinner and sometimes people can be picky. They were great without the lemon and next time I make this I look forward to adding that to see how these turn out. Thanks for sharing! Inlaw, hubby, and kiddo approved.

I absolutely love these potatoes!! I have been making them for probably about 5 years now and they are the best I have ever had! My advice is don't skip the lemon or Parmesan they really makes the dish!

It was a huge hit! There were four of us and we ate every bit of those 2 pounds no problem. I bet we'd have eaten more if I'd made it! I recommend only a few changes in cooking, the flavor was perfect with these ingredients. 
 
I read the reviews ahead of time, and made some chages based on them. I cooked the potatoes ahead of time by boiling them till they were just getting tender through the middle, then quatered them. I used the mixture provided with lemon juice concentrate instead of fresh, but actually ran short of the mix and had to add an extra quater to a half more of everything. After coating the quarters and laying them double thick in a baking dish I drizzled the remaining mixture on top, finally adding the cheese. I used extra cheese too, but I'm a cheese lover, so that explains that. I baked at 350, checking every 5 minutes until they looked golden and crispy on the outside.

I made it for dinner for my boys and we loved it! I followed Sarah W advice and microwaved it in a glass dish for 15-20 minutes stirring every 5 mins and then finishing it off by browning it in the oven at 375 for another 5 min.

Tasty, but way too much liquid.  First time I didn't microwave or parboil and they definitely took a lot longer to cook but there was a lot of liquid at the end so they never browned or crisped up.  This time I microwaved the potatoes first for about 3 minutes then cooked them uncovered in the 8x8 pan. After 15 minutes I checked on them and ended up using a slotted spoon to take them out and put them onto an empty cookie sheet because again they were just sitting in liquid.  This worked well.  Next time I'll microwave for 2-3 minutes, toss in half the butter mixture, put onto cookie sheet and bake at 3:50 for 20-30 minutes.

Really really good. I am a total beginner cook and they turned out so yummy. I used olive oil instead of butter and they were great. Also- my grocery store was out of stock on the small red potatoes, so I had to use the med/large ones. Cooking time took WAY longer. They were almost mushy but still fabulous. So easy even I did it!!

These were great!! I did modify the cook time a bit, seeing the other reviewsabout the cook time I didn't take the chance as I got a late start on dinner. I put the potatoes in the microwave for 20 minutes(make sure you stir  while in micro to coat the pottoes, then into the oven for another 20 to brown the tops and boy were they good. All the kids enjoyed these so much that my picky 12 year old said "mom you gotta make these more" and I def. will be!

This was really easy to make however i would definitely leave it in the oven for longer than 40 minutes.  While the potatoes were good they are missing a little something.  Next time i make them i would add a dash of Italian spices

Excellent recipe !!! I made a just a few minor adjustments: I baked the potatoes for 40 mins covered and 15mins uncovered. It came out perfect (soft white part and crispy skin) I also added just a sprinkle of rosemary and basil at the end!

I thought the seasoning was great! I used the full amount of seasoning for 1.3 lbs of potatoes instead of 2 lbs (which was more than enough for 3 people). I followed the instructions, but at 30 minutes they were still very hard and I knew 10 more minutes wouldn't finish them in the oven so I microwaved the baking dish for 5 minutes, then popped them back in uncovered to finish baking (I had diced them into large bite sized pieces). This worked pretty well, though some were still a little firmer than I would have preferred.  I would definitely use this again, but it does need a longer cooking time. The seasoning was very nice - I did use a fresh lemon, and enjoyed the light lemon flavor!

Like others have said, the cook time is off, BUT they were still really good, just not quite done. My son is allergic to milk so I left out the parmesan cheese and used dairy free butter spread. We had leftovers so the next day I shredded them up and made THE BEST hashbrowns I've ever tasted. For that reason, this recipe is a keeper!

First-rate!! I'd been looking for a good roasted potato recipe for quite a while. I ended up using a lime (out of lemon at the time), and added a little more cheese. Also parboiled the potatoes prior to baking. The dish not only looked great after baking, it tasted terrific.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it gets rave reviews!  I usually cut the potatoes into smaller chunks and double the cooking time.  Next time I may try to make them healthier - less butter and salt.

Sorry but they were just regular ol' red potatoes to me. The cooking time was also WAY off. I was stuck with everything ready for dinner, minus the potatoes. The potatoes took alot longer to cook. We were all done eating by the time the potatoes were done.

This recipe is fantastic!!  My kids really loved these potatoes.  The only change I would make would be in the cooking time.  The potatoes came out a little under done when I made it, but other than that, it was really, really good!!!!  :)

Great recipe! Although, next time I will cut back a bit on the lemon juice it just didn't suit my taste using that much, but everyone else loved it.

Excellent recipe, I make them all the time!! However, they take a long time to cook, so I have to cut them into smaller pieces than suggested to get them to cook in 40 minutes.

This was a very good recipe, but like other reviewers, the cook time needed to be increased.  If I would've used baby red potatoes it may have been okay, but I used regular red potatoes and they weren't cooked thru in the time alloted.  I ended up increasing the temp to 400 degrees and cooking and extra 15 to 20 minutes.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe!!  I couldn't get them to cook quick enough - so I cut the pieces smaller and baked them at 400 instead of 350 and they cook much quicker!!  I still wouldn't even be able to give an accurate time - just check them every 30 minutes and stir every time.

These were just so-so. As other reviewers have suggested, the cooking time does not seem to be sufficient so I ended up baking these for significantly longer than the recipe called for, and while the flavor is good, its not particularly spectacular. I made these to go with steak, and while my guests all ate the potatoes, none of them commented on them. I may make these again in a pinch, but I didn't find them particularly special.

too lemony.  Took advice and cooked in microwave....came out rubbery.  The seasoning was a nice touch though.

I made this recipe for company, and served with steaks and asparagus.  I made 3 pounds of potatoes, and increased the other ingredients accordingly.  I cut the potatoes small and it did take only an hour to bake.  As I put the potatoes on a serving dish, I was concerned that we would have a ton of potatoes left.  But....they were so good that there were no leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a good and easy to make side potatoes. The only problem is 1 lemon juice was a little too much; made it sour.

These potatoes are EXCELLENT!!  I highly recommend them for any meal!  I definitely agree with the previous posts.  The cooking time is way off.  I follow the recipe exactly but put the potatoes in the microwave for 25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes, to get them soft.  Then I put the potatoes in the oven for about 10 minutes to brown them.  My husband loves them.  I don't think we ever have leftovers!

Great tasting, but substitute 1/2 of the butter for olive oil, and added parsley. I can never leave a recipe alone, probably would have been great without my intervention.  Would have used dill if making a different main course that day.

I made these again tonight and they were great. I wish they would have absorbed the butter lemon flavor more, but they were great...I know it sounds weird, but I cooked them in the oven for 30 min and then transfered them into foil and grilled them the rest of the way. Served with grilled chicken and bbq grilled carrots. Awesome dinner...

These potatoes are seriously sinful. I think the recipe calls for a little too much butter, my potatoes were swimming in it so much so, that, halfway through baking them I spooned out a lot of the butter. But maybe I didn't use enough potatoes...either way, delicious!!!!

Oh.. wonderfull.. This was dripping with butter, but for somethings you do not need to know the fat content. I thought the cooking time could have been longer, the pieces I pulled out early were tough, I think 375 or 400 for 40 mins should do it.

I've made these many many times! Flavor wise these are wonderful!  Only thing I find is that they need longer to cook. We like our potatoes tender and I usually cook them at LEAST an hour and then take the tinfoil off and "brown" them a little towards the end. Sometimes I omit the lemon juice and just use the butter and garlic! They are just as delicious (I actually prefre them like this and my hubby likes them with the lemon so I rotate how I make them!!)  Very yummy!

The recipe as written did not work for me or my family.  The cook time is way off....I baked mine closer to an hour.  The butter made the potatoes way to greasy.  The 2nd time around, I skipped the butter and used some extra virgin olive oil instead.  I used all the spices listed just added a tad more salt and some chopped chives as well.

Yummy. However, definitely cook them in the microwave either prior to, or after, for a good 3.5 minutes. I also sprinkled rosemary on top. Wha la, super easy!

I agree with others that 30 minutes is not nearly long enough. I followed the advice of another user who microwaves them for 15-20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. They come out perfectly this way. I have made several times, and will make again.

These did not cook in 30 minutes....it took at least 55 minutes at that temperature to get them cooked as shown in the picture.  I should have know better...too bad as the taste was nice.

These tasted really good, but they didn't want to brown for some reason.  I eventually served them anyway, and they were well-received.

My wife LOVED this recipe when I made it for dinner.  I started it off in the oven but then read the reviews about it taking longer and switched to the microwave to speed up the process.

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly except for taking a reviewer's suggestion and microwaving for 20 minutes (stirring every 5 mintues) and they turned out great!

My family loved this recipe. I altered a few things. I cut bite size pieces of six red potatoes and 6 white potatoes, which made this dish very colorful. I omitted the lemon, used 2 tsp. lemon pepper, 1 tsp. black pepper and 4 tsp. salt, 8 tablespoons minced garlic (from a jar) and omitted the cheese. I melted the butter, then tossed it with everything in a large bowl and then transfered into a 13x9x2 glass baking dish at 350 for 45 minutes covered with aluminum foil It was delicious and the potatoes were the perfect texture. Fast and easy to prepare. Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely make this again and again.

The parmesan cheese is the only thing that saved this recipe from being average potatoes.  We could barely taste the garlic, as recipe called for it.  Next time we'll double the garlic & cheese to see if it turns out better

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I had to cook the potatoes much longer than the recipe called for, and they still didn't seem cooked enough. Also, the lemon flavor seemed way too strong.

I bought small red potatoes and cut them in 1/8, and STILL had to cook them for an hour. I used fresh parmesan and more garlic. They were delicious!

These potatoes are delicious!! I was looking for a low sodium dish, so I just cut out the salt and used unsalted butter. The flavor was amazing! The garlic and lemon make all the difference. I will definitely be making these again soon!  Remember, if you use larger red potatoes, it will take longer in the oven. I used very small potatoes, and it only took the recommended time.

Super EASY!  I made this with kabobs and apple pie for my parents summer 09.  The only change I made was to use olive oil instead of melted butter.  It was just too good!  Can and SHOULD be served all the time!

Very tasty....however....I have to agree with another reviewer....the cook time was way off. Took much longer than indicated which threw off our meal since it came out long after the other items.  But truly they were delicious.

Yum! Yum! This is a delicious recipe. I added a little bit of parsley and black pepper. And I added like 10 more minutes on the oven and they were perfect. We ate it with a delicious NY Steak my husband made.

LOVE these.  Have made them as a side dish whenever I make dinner for friends (i.e., new baby drop off dinner) and they have been a hit.  I turn the heat up to 400 and bake uncovered -- otherwise, I find it takes a lot longer than recipe says.  Even better reheated the next day in a skillet with a bit of oil -- yum!

I cut these up quite a bit (into 1/8ths), and cooked about 40 minutes at 375. Pretty good. I enjoyed the lemon flavor but added a bit of Italian seasoning.

Pretty good...but took MUCH longer to cook than stated.  I even upped to temperature to 400 after reading other reviewers.  After an hour at 400 degrees, they still weren't done.  I turned up to 450 and they finally finished about 20 minutes later.  I think boiling them first would have worked much better.  I ended up taking some out after an hour and putting them in the microwave because the rest of my dinner was done and my husband was starving.

Good recipe, but you def need to cook the potatoes longer - at least 1 hour.

All I changed was to boil the potatoes for approx. 5 min. first, then put in the oven for an hour.  They were absolutely delicious!

I double the ingredients but left out the lemon because I didn't have any.  It was so good!  Can't wait to make them again.

Combined all ingredients exactly as written the only difference was I put them in foil and threw them on the grill (too hot to cook inside right now) They were good  but nothing to write home about.

Very good and will make again.  Next time I will start them earlier and bake longer.  I ended up putting the whole dish in the microwave to get them tender and then under the broiler to brown and crisp them up.

These were delicious! I knew ahead of time to leave them in for almost an hour, so the modified time worked out great.  I accidentally mixed in the parmesan with the butter, so I just added a bit more about 10 minutes before they were done. Good reheated too!

I've made potatoes many different ways over the years and this simple recipe is really delicious.  I rated it a 4 because the cook time is off, it needs to cook at least an hour.

The flavor was nice but it did take a long time to cook and the potatos were mushy in the middle and not as crunchy as I like on the outside.

very good, but takes too long. I followed all suggestions and even turned up the oven. Took about an hour for them to come out right. Too time consuming for me, but they are good.

I LOVE this recipe!  I tried it on the grill the other night and it was great!  I simply put all of the ingredients in a foil envelope.  Just be sure to rotate the bag so the potatoes don't burn.  Great recipe!!

I love the lemon flavor! It really enhances the butter taste. I will probably increase cooking time to an hour next time.

These potatoes were soo good! I almost didn't want to eat the chicken i made along with it...haha, these potatoes could have easily been my meal. The only disappointing part was that the cooking time was way off...mine took an hr in the oven. Other than that, the potatoes had great flavor and i'll definitely be making them again!

We made this last night and it was so good! I added an extra clove of garlic and Italian seasoning. I cooked it 400 for at least 1 hour and 45 minutes! Next time I'll try nuking in the microwave for 10- 15 minutes like others. Still very good!

We had my hubby's boss over for dinner last night and I needed something quick and tasty to go with steak. At first I was like "lemon, garlic & parmesean don't sound to hot together" but after reading the ratings I decided to try it. I'm glad I did! This is a new staple in our home! Thanks so much!

Amazing recipe! I did have to cooke these much longer than the time recommended on the recipe.  I made these with chicken and had them in as long as the chicken was in...maybe a little longer.  The flavor of these was just declicious! I think the lemon juice is what made it so good in my opinion.  Definitely one of my favorite side dishes! Thank you!

They were very good, but the cook time was way too low. The potatoes were practically raw, and we followed the directions exactly. Once we cooked them a lot longer, they were good.

I read other reviews on these potatoes so I made mine in the microwave since I was using the oven for chicken. They did come out very good but got hard after a while if you didn't them right away. So I will be making these again but this time in the oven.

The lemon juice added a light fresh taste to the potatoes.  I used half butter and half olive oil.  A keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

These were good! Following the suggestions of other reviews, I cooked these for about an hour. It was a tad too citrus-y for my taste so next time I'll use half a lemon (juiced) and extra Parmesan cheese.

This was so good.  I'm so glad I tried this.  I'm a huge garlic lover...and this packs such a cool flavor!!  Yum...don't skip the lemon.  (Im not a lemon lover so I almost didn't use it)  But it totally adds to the great flavor blend. I cooked it a bit longer because I had other things in the oven, but yep it was delicious!!

These were great !  I baked them at 375  and cut them smaller to cut down on my cooking time.  Mixed in some Hillshire Farm polish sausage and made a veggie and we had a meal.

These are tasty and very easy, but you have to cook them WAY longer than what is indicated in the recipe.  Worth the wait, but keep the time in mind!

These were delicious! They remind me of another recipe I like to make - roasted broccoli with parmesan and lemon juice. Its the same concept, although I never would have thought to try it with potatoes. The combination of parmesan with lemon is one of my favorite flavors.

These potatoes were fabulous! We didn't have any lemon juice on hand so we just left it out. Also used seasoning salt instead of salt and added a teaspoon of dried parsley flakes for color. The cooking times were way off for us, though. After we did the said cooking time we left them in the oven for 10-20 minutes more. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe, but I think it might need to be tweaked a bit though.  I would probably add more butter and garlic next time because I found the potatoes had more lemon flavoring than garlic. I also had to cook it a good 10 minutes longer than suggested...but maybe that's just because my oven is old. Overall, it was a good side dish and I would definitely make it again.

These were good but I thought the lemon flavor was overpowering. I will make them again but without the lemon. And they definitely have to be cooked longer than called for.

The recipe, just by itself, was a little bland. I added simple lemon pepper, and although a juiced lemon is in the recipe, this did not create an overpowering lemon taste. It was great addition actually.

This was very good and easy.  I really liked that it could be made ahead and then just put in the oven.  Will make versions of this often from now on.

My fiance, who is not particularly picky about food, but rarely gives it a compliment, LOVED these potatoes. I didn't do anything different, but they did not brown up for me at all until I turned the oven up to 425 degrees. So that's the only thing. They took much longer to cook, and I would recommend cooking them covered for 30 at 350 then uncovering them and turning the temp up to 425 to brown and roast them. But it's wonderful!  I will play around with these some more.

This was a very good recipe.  I cut the butter in half and replaced the remaining half with olive oil.  I added 1 tsp dried rosemary and I added a generous share of parmesan at the end instead of at the beginning.  Great results!  Thanks!

I loved these potatoes and my husband did as well.  He had some red potatoes at a banquet and has been longing for some ever since.  This recipe has come the closest to what he experienced.  He was eating them right out of the pan.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Pretty good. I used baby red potatoes, so mine cooked in time. They were a little too greasy for me, but overall they make a tasty side.

I thought the potatoes were very tasty, however, the cook timing was WAY off.  You need at least an hour at 350, probably more.  I ended up turning up the heat to 400 after the first half hour and leaving the foil off for much longer then 10 minutes.  I wish I had read other reviews before trusting the timing since we ended up eating potatoes long after we had finished the rest of our dinner.  I also thought the recipe needed more parmesan cheese then was called for in the recipe and I, too, opted for olive oil instead of butter.

Yummy yum Yum!

I made it vegan style by using olive oil instead of artery clogging, heart attack inducing butter.  I also subsituted Almesan for Parmesan. What is almesan you ask?  It is a parmesan substitute recipe from the "Veganomicon".  Blend 1/4 cup slivered almonds, 1 tablespoon toasted almond seeds, 1/8tsp salt and 1/4 tsp lemon zest until you have a tiny crumb texture.

in sum: olive oil instead of butter, almesan in the middle of baking, and dill towards the end of baking. oh so good!

As other suggested, I microwaved the potatoes for about 12 minutes - then I broiled them for 2-3 minutes (which made them nice & crunchy on outside).  Also added 1 tsp italian seasoning.
I will use less butter next time - maybe 1/8 cup - doesn't need this much.

Most excellent as is.  The lemon threw everyone for a loop - no one could figure out what was giving the dish such a kick.  It was devoured and my daughter licked the pan - it is that good and definitely not the same ole red potato fare.  Only downside and completely my bad - I used a glass container and it more than doubled the cook time and completely threw off the timing of the meal.  Sadly a lesson I repeat every 3-4 years it seems.  Just a reminder to forgetful souls like me.

The lemon juice is a must have for this recipe, it gives it great flavor! I followed this recipe pretty much exact...I skipped the parm (forgot about it) and used a tad more butter then it called for. Then I tossed the potatoes in a ziplock bag with the butter mixture so they were evenly coated. I added rosemary as well. As for the cooking, I read reviews on how long it took. I didn't have any problems, because I put the potatoes on a cookie sheet on the very bottom rack. After 30 min, they were already starting to brown. Left them in for 45 min totally, and they were perfect!

I am not sure what went wrong for me with this recipe. I believe it was the lemon. Because of the reviews of the potatoes being undercooked I boiled mine for 10 minutes prior to baking at 400 degrees for indicated time. The potatoes were tender but the flavor was lacking.

SO DELICIOUS! I added some shredded cheese to mine. Even better when reheated on a skillet the next morning and sereved with eggs. The lemon is the secret ingredient that adds the tangy flavor.

Loved the flavor. I didn't have parmesan cheese and it was still good, but definately would be better with the parmesan.

This is a great and very easy recipe. I made stuffed porkchops and was looking for a side dish to go along with it. I used the amount of butter called for but added some more black pepper and some parmeson cheese on top. yummy. thank you

I gave this one 4 stars, only because I changed around the recipe a lot.

I added pepper and cooked the potatoes in a skillet after they were cooked in the over, to give them more of a crisp. I also added the garlic cloves, some balsamic and onion into the skillet.

My boyfriend loved them! =) Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe was great!  Easy to make and tasted delicious!  I steamed the cut up potatoes first in a steaming bowl in the microwave for about 5 minutes and then put them in the sauce before putting them in the oven.  They cooked much faster.  I cooked for about 10 minutes in the own at 350 and then broiled for about 5 minutes to get them a little brown on top.

My picky-eaters can't get enough of these potatoes!  I have to make a double batch!  They are very good.  I cook them a bit longer than the recipe calls for, like some of the other reviews said.  I cook them for about 45 minutes covered, then an additional 15 minutes uncovered.  Best potatoes I've ever had!

Simple and delicious! I microwaved them covered for about 5 minutes before putting them in the oven (first attempt left them crunchy cooking for the recommended amount of time). Added more garlic and no salt and watched them disappear. I have to make a lot to end up with any leftovers.

I had to cook these for over an hour at 350 degrees. I even cut the potatoes fairly small. It doesn't seem to be the oven b/c the biscuits cooked perfectly. I think I will stick with another method of cooking next time. Otherwise the flavor was good...but to be honest no one was all that hungry by the time they were done.

This turned out pretty good.  I may have used a little more potatoes.  So, it was a little bland.  I followed another review and boiled the potatoes first.  I'm not sure I will do that next time.  They didn't seem to get that golden look or texture which would make sense after boiling them.  Definitely a keeper though.

Awesome!!!!!!  What more can I say!!

I loved them!  My whole family loved them!!  Instead of butter I used 1/4 cup of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray, which has no calories or fat (I'm sure if you ate the whole 1/4 by yourself then it would)instead of the butter but did the rest the same.  I did cook them in the microwave first for 20 minutes then I finished them off in the oven with the meat.  They came out great. I'm gonna make these for Thanksgiving! Thanks again!!

Oh these were so yummy! I did everything the recipe said to but like one of the comments on here, I cooked them in the microwave for 15 min. Then I sprinkled a packet of dry ranch dip seasoning & they are so flavorful & tasty!!

This was a nice change for a potato side dish.  The lemon juice added a nice flavor.  The potatoes were not soft at 30 minutes.  It took about 55 minutes.  Next time I would use less butter and maybe add parsley for color.

This was an incrediably good side. The flavor was slight enough to not "out power" the main course, but delicious enough for seconds. I, personally, had no problem with the time on it and only left in the oven for 40 mintues total. Defenitaly will be making this again!

This was a simple and tasty dish to make!! I cooked it with baked chicken and steamed broccoli. It was the highlight of the meal. I cooked the potatoes longer thought ~50min _+ 10min of broiling.

Delicious! The lemon juice really makes it great and gives it that extra zing.  I added parsley for a little color and cooked it covered for 1 hour.  Served it alongside grilled salmon and fresh green beans - fantastic!

My crew really liked this dish.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except that I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut the pieces smaller.  I added a little more parmesean cheese and I added Italian seasoning, which was great! Next time, I plan to cut the butter in half.

I cooked them longer than the recipe suggested and used maybe two or three tablesppons more butter - but this recipe was great!  The parmesan cheese at the ends was a delicious finish!

sooooooo yummy. I usually just use garlic powder and omit the cheese to make it a little healthier... today I tried it with some orange juice and green onions and broiled for the last 5 min. DELICIOUS!

I tryed this recipe yesterday, Very Good Tasting. I agree about the cooking time though, about 45 to 50 minutes for the cooking time then the additional 10 minutes to melt the cheese. I didn't have Parmesan Cheese so I used grated Sharp Cheddar is what I had in the fridge. Thank you for the recipe. Would make it again very yummy.

These potatoes were loved by everyone I cooked them for.  My father told me to give my mother the recipe!  I did find I had to cook them longer, which was no big deal.  They were worth it!

I followed the recipe exactly and it did not turn out well.  They need to cook A LOT longer as some others have suggested.  Mine did not have much flavor for some reason??

This was a pretty good recipe - I added fresh dill to it and some green onion - I also cooked it for 45 minutes and when I took it out of the oven to remove the covering, I tossed in about 1/2 cup sour cream and cooked an additional 5 minutes or so.

The flavor on these was good, but we didn't like the lemon.  It's not that much, but you can notice it.  I didn't know if that was to keep the potatoes looking pretty or what, but we decided that next time it gets left out.  You need MUCH more cooking time than listed here if you are going to do it at 350.  You could do 50 minutes at 400-425, but not 350.  Without the lemon and cooking longer, this would be a great recipe.

I served these potatoes as a side to Chick & Asparagus bundles. They were a absolutely amazing! My dinner guest love them. Only change I made was to use shredded Parmesan cheese. ( I was out of grated). I probably used way more than the recipes suggested, I just sprinkled it all over the top. Still turned out great I plan to make them again soon.

I did 30 min at 375 covered, followed by 20 min at 350 uncovered.  Other than that I made no changes.  We had it with steak and broccoli.  The steak overpowered this, so it would probably go better with ham or chicken.  But it was VERY good and everyone in my family liked it.

The best.  Easy easy easy and GOOD GOOD GOOD.  I used 'fake' lemon juice since I forgot to buy lemons.  You know..the lemon juice out of the plastic lemon - and I just eyeballed it and figured a Tablespoon was good - maybe a bit more.  It was phenomenal and I would make again!  Loved the lemon and garlic.  YUMMY. Made again on 9/14/09 - I halved the butter and did olive oil too and this time used real lemons.  So easy that my kid actually helped make them.

Need to adjust cooking time on this recipe...I ended up cooking 10 min. in microwave plus 30 min. in a 375 degree oven.  I decreased the lemon and the garlic (personal preference) on this and we really enjoyed them.  Will try 40 min. at 400 maybe next time.  Will make them again.

I agree about the cooking time. It needs at least an hour (brought them to Easter dinner near raw) but loved the flavor and simplicity of ingredients. The lemon juice especially soaks in and brightens up the flavor and leaves a nice aftertaste. I will make this again.

Good, easy, and fast. Potatoes alway take longer by about 10 min. I had to nuke them tonight a few minutes to get them to cook faster due to timing and they still turned out great.

Made this for friends and it was a hit. They even wanted to know how to make them. I cooked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for another 30 minutes like other reviewers said. I served with salmon and it was very complimentary.

The potatos were ok. My family really didn't care for them to much. There wasen't much flavor. Definitly cook for 1 hour.

Definitely tasty potatoes!!  I followed others advice and cooked them for a little over an hour.  There was a few leftovers, and they warmed up just great!  Easy recipe and delicious.  Thank you :D

These potatoes were so good however I did tweak the recipe just a little.  Per other reviewers, I increased the temp to 425 for 40 minutes and then cooked uncovered for about 10 more.  At the end of cooking, I put fresh grated parmesan on top of the potatoes and cooked under the broiler to get them crispy.  I also added parsley and garlic powder to the lemon/butter mixture.  These are fabulous potatoes!!

We really enjoyed these potatoes, I would of given them 5 *'s but I think they need to be cooked longer.  I would start with the given time and cook until potatoes look perfect to you!

I tried this recipe and I do love it. But it's really buttery. Not too good for the waist line. But my guests loved it. It's fast to prepare so that's a plus. I'll definitely make this dish again, but not too often.

The taste was great, however, I wish I would've read the other reviewsfirst; the time was too short. I ended up placing them in the microwave so they would be ready with the rest of my meal. Otherwise, good flavor!

As in other reviews, the cooking time was way off. I took advice from some other reviews and par boiled the potatoes before everything else, but then i just could not get them to crisp to an appealing texture. Probably will try again though, because the taste of these (perfect hint of lemon) was FANTASTIC!

The potatoes are great. The lemon juice adds that special kick that I look for that sets a recipe apart from all others, but the cook time is definetly too short for them to be edible. I would have to say an hour is about right.

Great recipe, really easy!  The only thing I would add,  if you are cooking at high altitude, make sure you increase temp. to 375 and bake covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for 15 minutes.

As noted by others, the cooking time will definitely need to be increased.  I ended up baking mine around 1 hour and 20 mins.  The flavor of the potatoes was good, but I added a little extra lemon juice, garlic, and dill weed.

These potatoes are tender & delicious!   About five minutes left of cooking time, I sprinkle 4 cups of mozzarella cheese on top of the potatoes.  Talk about YUMIE!!! PS. You could also you Lipton's Onion Soup Mix for more flavor!

These were pretty good. I added more garlic than was recommended. When they came out of the oven they seemed a little bland for my taste, so I added an Italian shredded cheese mix, (mozzarella, fontina, romano, asiago) on top, and they were much better. I will make them again.

Very interesting flavor, haven't decided how much I like it, but its a nice change of pace from typical garlic potatoes. However, mine came out still very crunchy after thirty minutes, so I had to increase the temp to 400 for another 15 minutes. They were still slightly undercooked but I was too hungry to care. The lemon adds a nice little zest. I'll probably make this again. I added some italian cheeses on top, they tasted great with the recipe.

My whole family loved these, will make again. I cooked these in an electric skillet to cut down on cooking time almost by half. Place potatoe wedges, cut in 1/8, in a single layer in electric skillet.  Add 2 cups water and cover, cook at 350 until almost done and the water has evaporated.  You may have to keep adding water.  When potatoes are almost done and the water has evaporated (leaving off lid will speed evaporation up), add the butter mixture, leave lid off, and fry, turning gently occasionally (not too much as it would turn potatoes mushy), until brown.  Add parmesian, stir gently to coat potatoes, brown for just a minute or two longer.  Enjoy!

Great potatoes!  I used half the butter and a half a large lemon.  I used 4 medium sized red potatoes (Not sure if it was 2 pounds) and cut them up into about 1/4 inch thick and about 1 inch wide pieces, and they took about one hour to cook at 350, although I did have other things in the oven also.

I found these to be bland - I even added fresh dill weed to compliment the lemon - but it was quite tasteless.  I won't make these again.

Very fast and easy.  Followed the recipe exactly except that I cut the potatoes in half and then into 1/4 inch slices, otherwise the pieces would have been huge.  I am going to use this recipe again with many variations.

Followed directions to a T and these required an additional 25 minutes.  Sitting down with a nice juicy steak and the potatoes are under done.  Because I was checking on the potatoes my steak cooled.  When they were finally ready (after dinner) they were bland.

1 star for the thought.

I enjoyed this dish so much!  I did make a few changes though.  Since I had some dill on hand, I used 2 T of that.  Then I added some italian herb seasoning into it and I put more garlic in the sauce.  And instead of cooking the potatoes covered first, I did it uncovered so that it'd be more crispy.  Then, I covered it so it could bake through.  I will definitely make this again!

This would have been better if I had cooked it longer, or used less potatoes, or cut them up smaller.  This was really my error - the dish probably deserves a four.

Oh Yum!  Okay so these are so delicious and I found the darker crunchy peices along the edge are the best so next time, I'm going to cut them into wedges as seen in the picture and not into quarters as the recipe states.  Maybe a little less butter to help them brown.  Don't skip out on the parmesean, it the best part.

This is really easy and good. I used 3# red potatoes cut into eighths, 3 cloves garlic, 1/4 c. butter (which was a little too much, the dish was too oily), and juice of one fresh lemon along with sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Because I forgot to put them in on time, I microwaved the dish uncovered for 10 min, then baked covered for about 20 min at 450. Then uncovered for 10 min longer. Added cheese then baked a few minutes longer. Added some shredded cheddar as well as grated parmesan. Could use one or the other, but was short on parmesan. My family really liked the change.

These potatoes were very tasty!  I cut the red potatoes into 1/8ths and cooked them at 400 degrees 45 minutes covered and then 30 minutes uncovered.  They have a definate lemony flavour.  I will make these again I'm sure.

I guess I should have read the reviews first because 40 minutes on 350 was definitely not long enough.  I had to add about 25 minutes.  Flavor was very good though.  I'll definitely make again.

This is a very good versatile recipe.  It can be used with all types of dishes.  My potatoes cooked for an hour and I cut them into eighths, so give yourself some extra time when making this.  The potatoes never crisped and the lemon over powered my potatoes.  I'm not complaining though, I ate most of the potatoes!!  I loved them, and my company enjoyed them too.  My husband prefers other recipes I've tried in the past.  Maybe my lemon was too big?  Anyways, thank you for sharing.  I will definitely make this again when hubby isn't home!!

I was not impressed with these potatoes. As many reviewers mentioned, the cooking time is completely wrong. At 350, it took me a little over an hour to cook the potatoes. I cut my potatoes into eighths, not fourths as the recipe suggested. The flavor was just ok. All of the flavor falls to the bottom of the dish so you have to spoon it over the potatoes when you serve them or else they will have no flavor. I won't make these again.

Made these for Christmas and while I thought they were very good, next time I will not use so much lemon juice, if any. They also needed to cook for more than 40 minutes - more like an hour total. I also had to sprinkle a little extra salt on them when they were done. It was nice to have a potato dish other than potato salad, for a change.

I made these with butter and olive oil and since I didn't have any lemon juice on hand I added lemon extract, I also threw in some rosemary sprigs. I left the temperature at 350 like the recipe states and they took a little less than an hour and a half.

Decent but not great. I added about a tablespoon of garlic instead of the teaspoon.  Also, they took an extra 20 minutes to cook. I ended up setting the oven to 400 to speed it up. Probably won't make again, but still pretty good.

We loved this recipe & prepare it frequently. Like others have said, I did have to extend the baking time quite a bit, to an hour or more at 375 degrees. Also, I toss in some rosemary for added flavor. My four year old absolutely loves these. Thanks!

My family enjoyed these. Used a foiled lined pan instead of a baking dish. I microwaved the potatoes close to 10 minutes first, cut them, then shook everything up in a bag and spread them out on a pan. After a 1/2 hour, I broiled them for about 5 minutes to get brown. A little time consuming, but tasted great.

I wasn't impressed with this, considering the amount of calories.  It was funny to think that these potatoes would cook in 40 minutes, especially if they are "quartered".  Unfortunately, I was busy cooking everything else and didn't pay attention.  My whole dinner was timed down to the minute, and when I pulled these potatoes out, they were raw.  I followed the recipe exactly.  By the time I got them on the table (20 minutes later), no one was interested. Won't be making again.

This was the first time I made red potatoes and will make this recipe again for sure. I upped the oven temp to 400 (I had chicken baking as well), so it took 35 minutes. They browned nicely, but will cut back just a little on the butter next time.

A good simple recipe.  I served with roast chicken and broccoli casserole.  It was good, I wouldn't really say they are anything that different from other roast potato recipes.

This was great!  I used fresh potatoes out of the garden, along with "brown sugar meatloaf"(from this site)....It was a great combination, a hit for the whole family and such an easy dish, Thanks for the recipe!!

Great potatoes!!! I had mine in the oven for just over an hour, and they still needed a little more time.  (My oven is horrible)I also didn't have any lemon juice but they were still very tasty. i added extra garlic salt.  Very good, will make again.  Thank you

Too much lemon flavor.  Cut in 1-1/2 inch cubes and cooked for an hour, still needed to microwave to finish cooking.  Will keep looking for a recipe, thanks anyways.

The taste is fantastic, but like stated in other reviews - the cook time is completely off. Should have cooked for at least 20 minutes longer or bake temp needs to be increased. Will definately try but will tweek this bake time a bit.

These were excellent!! I didn't have red potatos but used brown thin skinned ones instead and it worked fine.  I added a little extra parmesan and used margarine instead of butter as it was all I had.  Still wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe, will definatley make again!

These were OK.  I didn't like how drenched in butter they were, and you could hardly taste the cheese.  I would keep searching for a better potato side dish.

Great!  I cut the potatoes in smaller bite size pieces and then was able to cook them for the amount  of time that is stated in the recipe.  We liked the subtle flavor of the lemon juice but I used just half of a lemon. I also put the potatoes under the brolier for a few minutes at the end to get them a little more crunchy - yum.

This was a tasty side dish.  It was delicious with a crock pot chuck roast.  If I were to do it over again, I would add more parmesan, and maybe a little seasoned salt.  The potatoes were delicious, but needed a little more flavoring.

Definately a keeper!  I had to bake the potatoes a little longer than the recipe called for, but everything considered, the recipe is worth the extra time it took to bake them.  I also cut the recipe down to feed two people.  Had just a few leftovers and they were tasty the next evening!

Excellent recipe, I used too much lemon, but they still got ate up!  I will make this again.  Great for every day meals and more elegant meals equally.  You could probably "pretty" it up by adding a dark green spice, such as oregano, after cooking.

This tastes great!  I didn't use any parmesan cheese and I used about half of the prescribed amount of butter. I also added extra garlic in addition to chopped tomatoes, green onions, parsely, paprika and mushrooms!  Overall, I was very pleased and they tasted great with my grilled salmon.

Sorry but we just did not like this.  They ended up way too sour due to the lemon juice which unfortunately I used the exact amount in the recipe.  Will keep looking but thanks anyway.

I used the sauce but prepared the potatoes a little differently.  I quartered my reds, boiled them until almost tender, tossed them in the sauce, then poured all into a foil packet, grilling them next to the teriyaki chops.  We thought there was too much of a lemon taste.

These potatoes were awesome, though they took a bit longer to cook than it said. I think that quartering the potatoes leads to a longer cooking time. But otherwise, this was an excellent recipe and I will definitely make this again.

These were pretty good.  Though they took longer to cook than I'd expected even though I cubed the potatoes and cooked at 375 deg.  They took about 50-55 minutes to cook until tender.  I'll make these again, but they weren't a family favorite.

Very tasty and easy to fix. As long as the oven is on anyway, try this sidedish. Even better after sitting a little while.

Wow-- these are soooo good I couldn't stop eating them.  My husband, who is not a potato eater, said they were the best he's ever had.  The only thing is that it takes much longer than 40 minutes to bake.

This is a great side dish! We liked these a lot. I ended up cooking my potaotes a little bit longer for more of a golden brown crunchy potatoe. Will have to make this again soon!

Good stuff.  I added seasoning salt and extra garlic.  Next time I will add even more but I definitely liked this!
***note - I would like to change this to 5 stars from my original rating of 4 stars.  I make this ALL of the time!  I add some lemon pepper and extra butter and the house smells heavenly while it's baking.

This was a great recipe to use for parisienne potatoes!  Used as a side dish with roasted chicken, along with Orange Glazed Carrots, this made a fantastic meal...  Hubby would like to use a little less lemon next time, but I had absolutely no complaints against it...had to go back for seconds!! :)

My husband and I liked these potatoes but I wish I had read the reviews before starting..I didn't count on the extra 20 minutes they had to cook (covered). I also agree that it calls for a little too much butter and was too garlicy for my taste. Husband loves garlic so he ate most of them. I might try this one over again.

I didn't particularly like the zing that the lemon gave to these potatoes (but I'm not much of a lemon fan either so that may be why).  Plus, they needed to cook longer - a lot of them were too undercooked.  I'll probably try this one again, but leave out the lemon and add more garlic.

These were good! I made them as a side dish with "Cheese Stuffed Chicken Rolls". This was very easy to prepare and tasted really good.... I left them sitting out after dinner and my roommate devoured the leftovers!

This is a terrific recipe - especially when you're short on prep time.  Great recipe to personalize to your own tastes too (we love to add dill to potatoes.)  Definitely cook for an hour though.

This was an excellent and quick way to serve yummy red potatoes. We had it as a side for orange roughy and it was delicious, especially with the hint of lemon flavor.
