I have made this recipe many years with one slight modification.  Mix together the butter, water and sugar, bring to a boil and remove from heat.  Add chips and stir until melted.  Add eggs and vanilla and incorporate.  Then add the rest of the dry ingredients.  Why dirty another bowl?  Easy, quick and delicious with minimal cleanup!

I've been using a nearly identical recipe (also from Toll House, using baking bars) for years and it is great. In fact, I just made them twice for parties this week and they were the first to disappear from the dessert table.

As a chocoholic, I like to also fold in large chunks of white and milk chocolate (or dark chocolate, depending upon your preference) just before pouring into the pan. About 2.5 oz of each. If the mixture isn't too hot, they'll stay solid enough so that the brownies have pockets of solid chocolate that add to both the flavor and the presentation. You can never have too much chocolate, in my opinion.  :)

A few prep ideas: (1) It is also possible to melt the sugar and butter with a few tablespoons of water in the microwave (using a large microwave safe bowl of course). It is easier, faster, works just as well and it is plenty hot enough to melt the chocolate when mixed in after the sugar is melted. (2) In addition to buttering the pan, I like to line the bottom of the pan with a piece of baking paper to make it easier to get the brownies out and avoid breaking. (3) Remove the pan from the oven just before it is fully done for even moister and denser brownies (it will keep cooking/setting anyway due to the absorbed heat).

BTW, this has become one of my favorite web sites, I just feel a little guilty that my cookbook collection gets so little attention these days.

I love the recipe, but I am confused by the reviews which mention making these for years since the Dark Chocolate Chips are a brand new product that I have been waiting years for Nestle to make.

I have been making these for years.  Only double batches.  Always a  request for parties and anytime you want a major chocolate fix.  Very easy to make, one pan,  the best brownies ever.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe. Brownies are hubby's favorite dessert and I have been looking for the Dark Chocolate Morsels in our area for a while and finally found them. These just didn't go over very well here. We do LOVE dark chocolate and fudgy brownies over a cake texture. The texture of these (even after adding approx 15 min to the bake time) was more like partially cooked fudge. The bottom and top were cooked but the middle never got done. The dark chocolate flavor is also not as strong as I was hoping for. It's no secret that we love our sweets here but these were just too sweet and the flavor was flat. I followed the recipe, leaving out the nuts. I enjoyed trying a new recipe and new product but will keep looking for a dark chocolate brownie recipe for us.

This brownie could be so wonderful, but I was very disappointed in the cook time . . . after 40 minutes they were totally raw in the middle; cooked another 5 minutes and still too gooey. Cooked almost 50 minutes to get the middle done (and yes, I know to take them out while still loosely set in the middle, but these were WAY undercooked at 40 and 45 minutes) and the outsides were hard and no longer chewy. I should have covered the outsides with foil to prevent over-cooking, but hey, if you have to go thru all that trouble, why bother with this recipe? Perhaps the oven temp of 325 degrees was a misprint? Maybe cooking at 350 would help? So, even after 50 minutes of cooking, these brownies are still not cooked in the middle. Won't make again.

Wow! Yummy! I always like to try out new brownie recipes, just to see what is out there and this is my new favorite!  I used good quality semi-sweet chocolate (sorry, not Nestle) and it was great, I think I will try dark chocolate next time just to taste the difference.  I was a little unsure about only 3/4 c flour but it wasn't a problem.  Very happy with these brownies!

I have never made homemade brownies before. Too easy to pour a mix in a bowl... WOW - & this took only minutes more than a box!! They were GREAT! almost like fudge!  I made them in a muffin tin, so I had to adjust the time, I took about 33 minutes. No more box mixes for me.

There is not one bad thing about these brownies!  Rich and gooey and less butter than in most brownies this good.  I add 2 teaspoons of instant espresso granules (inexpensive stuff from Aldi is fine) and dissolve it in the water.  It won't taste like coffee, just deeper chocolate.  Great, easy recipe.

Doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 pan lined with parchment.   I brought the brownies to a friends house for dessert, and we all agreed they were fantastic!  I will definitely make these again.

Very similar to a recipe I have used for years.  Don't bother with the saucepan, just melt the butter, sugar, and water in a microwave proof bowl and mix in the rest of the ingredients.  This bakes very evenly in about 35 minutes at 350 if you use a 9x9 pan instead of 8x8.  My recipe used half the chips melted, and half stirred into the batter just before baking.  It is still very fudgy, so maybe those who are having trouble with the batter being too runny after baking might try dividing the chips evenly.  This is quicker than a mix after you have made it a few times.  Just have some cold milk or vanilla ice cream ready!

I used the dark chocolate chips for a spicy chocolate pie,but I will try them for the brownies to see if they beat my long time recipe using Nestle Choco Bake. That recipe has been a hit with everyone for years! I will write back and let you know my verdict!

The brownie part was great but I couldn't find the German Chocolate Topping so I made my own with coconut, pecans, cream and butter.  Delicious.  The brownie comes out really moist and very chocolatey!

I've used a similar recipe with semisweet chips, and I wasn't sure how much of a difference the dark chocolate would make. It's been awhile, but in my estimation they're a little different but not hugely so, possibly because of the added sugar. If I make them again, I'll probably halve the salt (I use salted butter), and lighten up on the sugar, since the semi-melted morsels added at the end are plenty sweet. These are really very rich and loaded with sugar and fat. Usually I'm not a killjoy when it comes to sweets, but part of me thinks it's still overkill. That being said, plenty chocolatey, and probably delivers what most people expect, so at least 3.5 stars.

Made these as a treat for my chocoholic husband and I must say they are decadent! Had to bake for 45 minutes and they were still very moist when warm but firmed up nicely once fully cooled ... I  served with a side of fresh strawberries and cream ... YUM!! Thanks for the recipe ... new favourite!!

I followed this recipe exactly, but baked it off in a silicone mini muffin pan...OMG...this is by FAR the best and easiest recipe for brownies that I have ever tried and I can tell you, I've tried many many brownie recipes.  The brownie bites were moist, chewy and way too adictive for this chocoholic!  You will not be disappointed in this one...promise!

These are so yummy!  They firm up after they cool and are so rich.  Be sure to have a big glass of milk close by you'll need it.  Best Brownies ever.

The flavor of these was very good! I didn't have a problem with cook time, because I used a little bit of a larger pan, so mine weren't quite as thick. In fact, I did add a bit to my cook time after reading other reviews, and I may have overcooked them a bit. Very good and I will make them again.

Just wanted to clear up a mystery for one of the reviewers --- a lot of us "older bakers" started making this recipe years ago when the recipe just called for "ordinary" chocolate chips.  I haven't made this particular recipe but have had excellent results from a very similar Nestle recipe.

I thought these were great.  I didn't see the need to cut the butter into pieces; everything melted together fine.  Instead of transferring this mixture to a mixing bowl, I added the other ingredients to the pot.  I used semi-sweet chocolate as that is what I had on hand, but I definitely plan to make them again using the dark chocolate.  This is now my new go-to recipe for brownies.  Thanks for sharing.

Brownies are what I'm most comfortable baking. Those morsels are a GREAT addition!

These are good.  Next time will try milk chocolate morsels.  They are too sweet for my taste.  I think will reduce the sugar a little down to 3/4 cup.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband said that these were so good, that I probably shouldn't make them again. . . Seriously chocolate-y, dense, and moist!

I had the same problem as several others with the cook time being off, I had to add about 15 minutes. While these were good brownies, they are incredibly sweet. I think I'll stick with Brooke's Bombshell brownies or Mmm Mmm brownies. Thanks anyways.

I'd give this a five star even though I changed a few things. We don't use eggs and I used an egg replacer. This recipe is so good that it can take it. They were still crinkly on top, as home made brownies should be, and really good. I used a very dark chocolate bar, copped. Sorry, our grocery store didn't have Nestle Dark Chocolate Morsels. I tried! We also did the one pan variety. Egg replacer isn't as sensitive as egg so we had no issue whatsoever. Thanks Nestle!

I made these for my family last night as a Valentine's Day treat because my husband loves dark chocolate and brownies. Very easy to make. I, personally don't care for walnuts in my brownies, but hubby likes them so I added them. Well, these were very good, even with the nuts! Rich and chewy. Although, my 4 yr old son, a chocoholic, did not like them. Maybe a little too rich and dark for a kids' palate. Anyway, will make these again...maybe even swap out the walnuts for dried cherries!

Very good brownies. I did use ghiradelli chips though. I have edited my review. I downgraded to a 4 because the chips really made a difference. I made this again with nestle and it is too sweet!

Very, very rich chocolate brownies.  If you like fudge-like brownies then this is for you.  If you like more cake-like brownies, then this is not.

Best fudge brownies!  So good with vanilla ice cream.  I used semi sweet instead of dark, and a little less chocolates than called for, but otherwise kept everything else the same.   Was great!

Excellent, my Fiance' stated these are the best brownies I have made (and I make a lot of brownies!) I made them exactly as stated with the exception of adding some andies candies crumbled on top, yum!  I did have to bake them about 5 minutes longer than stated  ( at 325), but they came out chewy and rich! I have made these twice so far and am sure I will be making them again soon.

My husband said these were the best brownies ever.  Very fudgy and rich and pack an intense chocolate punch.  Took them to 4th of July party yesterday and got other compiments also.  I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips, which I imagine are comparable to the Nestle dark chocolate chips.
