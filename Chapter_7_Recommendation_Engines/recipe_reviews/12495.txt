This pie started out pretty well- the bottom layer tasted delicious. Had problems with the top though: used dark rum for flavor and found that the darker rum color (along with the egg yolk mixture) looked extremely unappealing when folded into the egg white mixture. Ultimately I scraped the top layer off the pie and made a half batch of Chocolate Mousse I (off of this site) to use instead (the recipe uses rum). I topped the mousse layer with some fresh whipped cream and chocolate shavings. In the end I had a beautiful and tasty Chocolate Rum Pie.

It is delicious. I used ghirardelle semi-sweet chips for a special flavor. I didn't do it exactly as the recipe showed because my family doesn't want to eat all that raw eggwhite. I used the eggwhite as a merringue and baked it a few moments. It seemed like there was too much of the rum layer even without the eggwhite.
