I couldn't taste the lemon flavor. I also microwaved it in 2 shallow bowls instead of a mug with no overflow.

Quick and tasty. Use a few drops lemon extract if you want a stronger lemon taste. Use a giant mug or two medium ones. Use only half a large beaten egg if large is all you have on hand.

I wish it had more lemon flavor. I had everything on hand which is a plus. Warning! I used the biggest mug I had and it overflowed. Use 2 mugs for this recipe.
