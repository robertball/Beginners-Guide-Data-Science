I saw this and had to try it out!  I decided to go the easy route and use Bisquick with the added brown sugar, vanilla and brown sugar-baked bacon.  It was so delicious!

WinCo had bacon on sale this week so this was a fun new way for me to use it in something homemade. These turned out absolutely perfect. i used whole wheat white flour but other than that, I made no other changes. HUGE hit. HUGE. My husband and kids ate every single one. For me, next time I'd use a better quality bacon. I used a cheap bacon and the results weren't as great as I'd hoped. My family didn't care--I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist.

What a great twist on waffles.These are actually belgian waffles and they puff up A LOT! I'd recommend using a belgian waffle maker. I used a regular waffle iron and had to be sure not to shut it all the way or the batter would spill out,even with less batter used. I found that if I held it almost shut, but not completely, that the batter fluffs up so much it'll still reach the top of the iron to cook.  You can also freeze leftovers in sealable bags. Just stick them in the oven at 250 degrees just til warmed.  Great recipe! I even made extra bacon and ate it alone! If you're looking for  a strong bacon flavor I suggest using more than what the recipe calls for.

these were good.  Next time I'll use more bacon (10 slices) and double the brown sugar in the batter.  The flavors are good, but need to be enhanced more.  We enjoyed these though, and can't wait to make again with the improvements.

I used more bacon - maybe 16 slices - and I got 10 1/2 Belgian-sized waffles out of the batch by using a 1/2 c measuring cup to pour out the batter.

I used half whole wheat flour. i added a teaspoon of cinnamon and increased the brown sugar by half, based on other reviews. i also cut a big step in that i used the precooked bacon pieces that Sams Club sells. i added a tbsp. of white corn syrup and the brown sugar to a skillet over low heat added the bacon and cooked for few mins. i turned my griddle to 4 as the 6 setting burned the brown sugar on the bacon. I and my boys thought these were very tasty. I cooked all the waffles which i believe it made 10, and cooled on waxed paper, then froze in individual packets so my boys can heat in microwave before school

These are very good, but definitely need more bacon! Next time I will add a slice to the mix (I halved the recipe) and make 2 extra to sprinkle on top.

DIdn’t make these yet, but wanted to remind people who don’t normally have buttermilk on hand that there is a powdered version of buttermilk in the baking section. Refrigerate after opening, but it is an easy way to keep it on hand.

These were so awesome, I loooovve them!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and these came out from my Belgian waffle maker beautiful, flavorful and fluffy.  They are airy but at the same time very filling, very good with dark maple syrup.  I also followed the directions as written, except for one thing (which was a big mistake!): I decided it would be a good idea to place the bacon on a paper towel to drain, like I would when I normally cook bacon. DO NOT do this!!  I didn't think about it ahead of time, but the caramelized sugar cooled onto the paper towel, which made it adhere to the bacon... cue me spending 10 minutes delicately peeling paper towel bits from my precious bacon!  Anyway, these waffles are great and I even liked them leftover, cold straight from the fridge, with no syrup.  I really recommend this recipe.

These were good and my family enjoyed them. I only wish they had more of a bacon flavor. The inly change I made was to add the bacon grease to the oil. In the future, I would use more bacon. Can there ever be too much bacon anyway?

Hmmmm...different.  It's actually easier than it sounds.  It makes a lot!  We never could quite adjust to having bacon in our waffles, but we did like them.  Didn't love them, but enjoyed trying something new.

Wow!!!!! I made a bunch of brown sugar bacon the day before (it’s our favorite way to make bacon) and saved enough to use for these waffles. I halved the recipe for three of us and it made enough for 5 Belgian waffles. They were a HUGE hit with my teenage daughters and I loved them too! Will definitely make these again!!

Irresistible!  Fluffy, delicious, and full of flavor. Yes, they could have had more bacon I suppose, or maybe I shouldn't have eaten the extra slice I baked. Next time I'll make more bacon. I used thick sliced and it was divine. Thanks for this super special  new Sunday Brunch addition!

This waffle recipe would be great even without the bacon!  Using a sweet bacon only enhances the flavor.  Cinnamon is a great addition as well.

I made this recipe as written and was very pleased with the results.  Super yummy!  I really liked having the bacon baked into the waffle.

Here are my thoughts for next time...
1. Make the brown sugar bacon the day before.  I wasn’t prepared for how sticky the bacon would be and it took a bit longer to chop than I expected.
2.  Make more bacon than listed.  Isn’t everything better with bacon?
3.  I’ll add more brown sugar to the batter.
4.  I might take the easier route and simply use Bisquik and add the bacon,vanilla, and brown sugar.

I used self-rising flour which eliminated the baking powder, etc. I also added 1/4 c. sour cream which makes the waffle light and fluffy.

I've made this recipe with brown sugar and without, I love the brown sugar bacon if..... I am serving the bacon as a side along with eggs.  But.....brown sugar bacon gets "lost" in the waffles especially if you are putting syrup on the waffles, which we always do since the syrup is from our own maples.  I don't want to add brown sugar when it is not noticeable, I'll keep mine separate from my waffles, both are delicious just not together.

I made it as stated, and it was delicious! Definitely need to use a Belgium waffle iron. I think I got about 10 waffles out of it, so it makes a lot! I made them all up and then reheated them for the next several breakfasts.

Loved it, shared it nothing but love in response. Despite some extra bacon (2 strips) the waffle was light and fluffy. Great submission.

As a bacon affectionado .. there isn’t enough bacon in the recipe. Nice waffle batter.. but I think I will leave the bacon to the side and enjoy it that way!

High in sodium, but yummy. I think that the next time I make it, I'll halve the recipe, but use the 8 strips of bacon.

Did not like the texture.  Caramelizing the bacon was great  and will try that way again.

I made it with Aunt Jemina Pancake Mix Original. Just cut the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, Buttermilk, and vegetable oil.  Use what the box ask for and add everything else but the cut items.

Pretty weak.  A good way to ruin a LOT of bacon.  Save your time, just make some regular waffles and eat your bacon on the side.  At least then you can make chicken and waffles with the leftovers.

My family loved these waffles! I did make these as written with gluten free flour. They could use more bacon though. If they had more bacon they would be perfect!
