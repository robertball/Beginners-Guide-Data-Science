Delicious recipe!  I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of butter and stone ground wheat flour instead of white flour to make it a lot healthier.  I also just used merlot instead of port wine.  VERY EASY and my fiance loved it!!  Perfect with new potatoes and asparagas!

This was so delicious. Not something to eat on a regular occasion but wonderful for those special ones.
