Very tasty pasta salad! Used shells and macaroni and added 1/3 cup of sour cream also and 2 packs of Splenda. I'm sure it would be good with some crumbled bacon, but wouldn't be as healthy. I also add a fresh chopped de-seeded jalapeno for more warmth. I think it could use maybe another can of tuna too. I would definitely make it again though.

Good summer pasta dish.  My son really enjoyed it.  My husband and I think it needs something, but can't quite figure out what that is.  I took it to a ladies dinner at church and it was well received.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

The pasta was very good. I used whole wheat pasta but that was the only difference.  Godd pasta but is missing the WOW factor.Would make again though.

Just as good if not better without the broccoli slaw.
