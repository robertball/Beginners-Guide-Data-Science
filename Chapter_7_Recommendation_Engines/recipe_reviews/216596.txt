Man, this stuff is good!  However, I modified it a bit, because it was just too "wet" as written.  I make the sauce as directed, but I use 1&1/2 times the amount of all the other ingredients.  I bake it at 400 degrees for about 25-30 minutes, and that makes it just right for our tastes.  I have since experimented with different dried fruit blends (tropical, etc) with equal success.  It's a healthy snack staple in our house!

I took MagicPam's advice and added another cup and a half of the rolled oats. I did not add the raisins or cranberries until after the rest of the mixture had baked because I didn't want them to burn. (Whenever I make trail mix or granola with the cranberries and bake them, it never turns out right. They either dry out, become rock hard or scorch and taste awful). We ate this as a breakfast cereal (granola) sans chocolate covered peanuts with fresh strawberries sliced over the top. VERY good. I'm glad for the previous reviewer who suggested to double--I agree that the mix would have been way too wet had I not and maybe I would not have had as good of an outcome.

This is pretty good.  I am following a paleo diet, so I skipped the oats and m&m's, but it was still good.  There was way too much maple syrup by following the recipe.  There were puddles of it.  I would definitely cut down if I make again.  Update, made this a second time with 1/2 c maple syrup and added some additional nuts and seeds and some dark chocolate chips chopped up.  This was very good now!

I made half a recipe, followed the directions to the letter, and it turned out pretty well. The raisins and the cranberries were a little too "baked and dry," so in the future, I'll try adding them after the mix comes out of the oven.  Little confused that it says "ready in 2-3/4 hours," since this took no time at all to prepare.  Can totally see how you could mix up nuts and fruits with this.
