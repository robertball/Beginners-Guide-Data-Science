TO PERFECT THIS RECIPE:  This one has a lot of potential.  When I told my picky husband that we were having a hot dog casserole, he made gagging motions.  Who would have thought this was decent. A BIG...HUGE... thing that I'd change for next time was cooking the hotdogs PRIOR to putting it in the oven.  ...unless of course you like that straight out of the fridge taste, which most people don't.  I put it in for the set amount of time and even cooked HALF the amount, and the hot dogs were still not cooked.  We had to put them in the microwave.  There's always using your favorite sausage link or my favorite andouille sausage instead.  Also, even after halving the recipe, we thought it needed more chili.  We've used homemade chili too.  Don't be afraid to add that cheese too and being creative and adding things like onions, etc.  It won't be gooey (a worry I had).  We also put the tortillas on the stove to cook them a little before baking.  Will do it again with these corrections.

Where has this recipe been all my life???  Absolutely wonderful!  I used fat free doggies, added onion, cheese, and mustard inside the fat-free tortilla and used homemade chili instead of canned.  My, my, my....what wonderful comfort food! Thank you Maxine!

I make ours with the chili without beans and add crushed corn chips on top. Great addition to a football party which kids will be attending. The adults will try and like too!

Comfort food in a different arrangement.  Too much fat in original recipe, so I used 99% fat free Vegetarian chili, 2% Sharp Cheddar cheese, and fat free white smoked Turkey hot dogs.  Then per other suggestions, put diced onions inside flour tortillas with the dog.  This all added up to a tasty dinner the roommate said would be worthy of having again.  After decreasing the fat by a ton, the only drawback is the enormous sodium content of the chili.

This is a keeper at my house. I did change it a bit tho. I added chopped onions between the chili and cheese layers and used shredded velveeta. My husband LOVED this casserole.

Nothing extravagant here, but for the effort it requires and the fact that it seems to please everyone's taste for parties and sporting events I find it worthy of a five.  Cheap, quick and tasty.  I cook my hot dogs first, go with 1 can of bean and 1 can of no-bean chili, which I combine and warm, add about a quarter cup of ketchup to the mix to make the chili go a litte further and put some cheese and a tad of the chili inside of each tortilla.  Great recipe - Thanks!  :-)

This is a really quick and simple, yet delicious recipe that my whole family loved! I added crushed fritos on top for a little added texture.

Great recipe.  It's one that all the members of my family like.  From my husband to my children - it has already become a family favorite.  Psst - dad and kids try to beat each other out for the leftovers - yea, it's that good.  Just add a little more chili - not too much.  Use the 19 oz cans instead. Perfect amount.  If you want it healthier, as some suggested make your own chili and you can also use all natural turkey hot dogs like I do.  By using a good quality canned chili it's a dinner that can be on the table in 30 mins with little effort.  My favorite part.

This recipe was great!  At first glance I thought it sounded so wierd, but I know how looks can be deceiving!  The only thing I changed was I used 2 bags of cheese- one to fill all the tortillas, and the other to top it off. Delicious!!

This was so simple and really good.  Next time I make it though I'll make my own chili as the sodium content in canned chili is through the roof.  It would also be really easy to cut the fat in this recipe by using reduced fat cheese and reduced fat hot dogs.  I might also try using corn tortillas.

I made this two Sunday's ago as a make ahead dinner for my husband and two kids because I wouldn't be home to make them dinner. I used CheddarWurst instead of plain hot dogs and I used my own homemade chili. I cannot tell you how much of a hit this was with them. My husband served these up with sour cream and more shredded cheese. I came home and there were NO leftovers. I'll make this again when I can have some myself because two weeks later, the boys are still talking about the "hot dog enchiladas". Banner idea.

I make this 2 or 3 times a year and it's comfort food that is so easy to tweak to your own personal taste. I'm fussy about hot dogs and use only Farmer John or Kosher hot dogs. When wrapping the dogs I add  some mustard to the tortilla, some chopped onion and some coarsely chopped olives. The chili for both the bottom and top gets some chopped fresh serranos for some added bite. Also when cooking for 2 and you don't want left overs it's easy to halve this recipe and use a smaller baking dish.

OK.... this was AMAZING!!!!! I read alot of reviews before I prepared this. I found this recipe because I was looking for a new way to use up some leftover homemade chili and this was fab!! Only thing i changed was boiling the hotdogs (i used turkey dogs for less fat) then searing them with a little texas pete (we love spicy food) and heating up my homemeade chili.  I used whole wheat tortillas to cut even more fat and placed a small amount of ketchup and cheese on the tortillas b4 placing the hotdog in and rolling them up. My husband (who prefers much healthier cusine) ate 2 and loved it!!! Will def use this as a new way to use leftover chili! Thanks for an amazing recipe!!!!!!

Very good. VERY easy. Kids loved it. Adults enjoyed it too. Only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of high fat content.

This was a BIG HIT at potluck today!  So quick and easy.  I used a total of 3 cans of chili (2 on top and 1 on bottom) and 2 cups of shredded cheese.  I diced a quarter of an onion and sprinkled it on top of the chili and then topped everything with the cheese.  I'm looking forward to putting this recipe in the line-up of our weekly meals at home.

Such a simple recipe that turned out to be very tasty and well liked! It really does taste like a chili dog! I halved the recipe down to 4 and used an 8x8. I boiled the hotdogs first. Layered one can of chili on the bottom. Then rolled the hotdog up with cheese inside the tortilla like many reviewers did. And I topped with 1/2 can more of chili and cheese. I didn't measure the cheese as we like things cheesy! I can't wait to use homemade chili with this! I'm not sure why I waited so long to make this, but I will def be making this more often! Thanks for an easy peasy, crowd pleaser recipe!

This was really good!  Better than expected.  I never would have thought of it, but the tortilla-hot dog-chili combo is really good.  The tortillas absorb some of the sauce and get a little plump (not soggy though, I hate soggy), they aren't identifiable as specifically tortillas after cooking. I made it because I had leftover tortillas and hot dogs in the fridge that needed to be eaten.  I only made 2 but used a whole can of vegetarian chili.  We like lots of chili!  Also I put a bit of yellow mustard inside the tortillas and sprinkled some french fried onions on top because I needed to use them up too.  The onions tasted great!  I think you could add olives, green onion, diced jalapeno, diced tomato- whatever you need to use up.  Next time I'm going to cut the roll ups in half before putting them in the dish so they're easier to serve.  I will definitely keep this recipe in mind next time I need a really easy dinner or have ingredients to use up!

Family loved it (except the daughter who dislikes tortillas and beans). Kids gave it 5 stars. I love that it is quick and easy. I used 2 cans of chili on the bottom and 2 on the top.

My fiancee absolutely loves hot dogs. Therefore, despite how odd a casserole involving hot dogs sounded, he practically begged me to make this recipe. He even bought all of the ingredients. I took one reviewer's suggestion and pre-heated the hot dogs in the microwave just to be sure they'd get hot enough. I also added more cheese inside the tortillas along with some onions. I also used 1/4 lb all beef hot dogs. Next time, I'll add more onions and some sour cream. This recipe is excellent if you like chili dogs. They were VERY tasty, and even reheated well a couple of days later. I would suggest, however, not eating ice cream for dessert afterwards. Chili dogs and dairy don't seem to mix well in the tummy.

The only thing I did differently was to use two 25 ounce cans of chili with beans and it was loved by everybody. I considered adding cheese inside the tortilla wraps as others had suggested, but instead I opted to sprinkle a good amount of the cheese over the first bed of chili. I loved the ease of preparation and wanted to keep it that way. This is the easiest meal ever and yummy, too. Serve this with a nice salad and your meal is complete. Thank you so much for submitting this wonderful recipe. My family already can't wait for me to make this again. It was truly loved by all ages - four generations just loved it!

I came across this recipe several months ago and couldn't decide whether or not to make it. I couldn't understand why hot dogs rolled up in a tortilla with some chili would be rated so high. Well,  I finally made it and it was wonderful!!! I boiled my hot dogs first and heated up the chili in the microwave to speed things up. Also I put a little mustard inside the tortilla before rolling it. I sprinkled some chopped pickles on the top just before serving. I still don't know why this was so good, but it was!! I can't wait to make this with some of my own left over chili.

I made this last night with a few changes.  I threw the hot dogs on the grill for just a few minutes to brown them up a bit and to make sure they were heated through.  Then I added some chopped onion, spicy mustard, chopped jalapenos and some Velveeta cheese and rolled them up in the tortillas.  I used chili without beans since I don't like beans and followed the remaining directions.  It was much better than I thought it would be.  My husband made an awful face when I told him what we were having but he said he liked it.  I wouldn't serve this if I had guests but it was quick and easy for a weeknight meal.

I was skeptical, but these were actually pretty good...I did add a slice of american cheese inside with the hot dog, but other than that followed the recipe.  I will probably make this again.

This recipe was really easy and tasted great.  I loved the tortillas instead of hot dog buns.  I added cheese inside the tortilla and I added chopped onions on top.  Great for a quick, easy, and yummy meal.

I made this for the family and got raze reviews! Husband even told his mother she needed to try it that it was wonderful...lol! I used homemade chili instead of the canned and added mustard and ketcup to the hotdog wraps.  A side of homemade coleslaw and it was awesome! Will definitely make again.

HOw easy was this!  I used the large can of Hormel Chili with no beans on the bottom and a small can to cover the dogs on top.  Cut up some onions.  I did warm up the hot dogs some in the microwave along with the torillas just so it wouldn't take 30 min in the over.  Super easy and family thought it was good...and that was it.  Will be making again and easy things to have on hand.

I just made this tonight.  After some skepticism, I was pleasantly surprised!  My 6 year old loved it, even though the chili I used was a little too spicy for her mouth.  My 2 year old ate the hot dog and some of the chili, which for him, is HUGE!

I did cook the dogs before hand so they were hot when I rolled tortillas.  I added cheese and mustard into tortillas before rolling.  

This recipe is affected by the quality and taste of the chili used.  This would be even better if you used your own home made chili, which I plan on doing the next time we have left over chili!

Thanks for this new addition to my recipe book!

I had high hopes for this one--a quick and easy TexMex experience.  However, while it was alright it was disappointing.  Not what I expected.

Delicious new twist on the traditional chili dog! This is definately a keeper, and one I will be making again later this season! But I did add two small chopped onions, and I also had to use four 15-ounce cans of chili, because two cans wouldn't have been enough.  I also used bun length franks; fitted the tortillas better.

We were kind of up in the air on this one. The flavour was almost there, but like others, I found the texture of the tortillas a little unappealing. I used 8 hot dogs and 8 tortillas, so I was surprised that the chili almost seemed to disappear. To me, chili dogs should be almost "sloppy joe" sloppy, and this just wasn't. I think I'll try it one more time with an extra can or two of chili and maybe jumbo hot dogs, as it seemed a little dry and the hot dogs didn't fill the tortillas as much as I would have liked. Good starting point, though.

*Update*
So, I tried it with 6 jumbo dogs and six tortillas. One can of chili on the bottom of the casserole, and two on top of the rolls. Baked till bubbly, sprinkled with shredded cheddar, and holey moley, was it yummy!

I'm shocked!  I thought this sounded almost grotesque (sorry!) but tried it anyway since my college boys love chili cheese anything.  My husband LOVED it, and my son made it for his roommates by  layering the tortillas with sliced up hotdogs instead of wrapping them.  They all loved it!  I'd suggest a pan of oven fries with this as there is plenty of chili sauce for dipping.

I have to say I was surprised how good this recipe was and my husband told me I can make this anytime in the future.  I did follow some suggestions and browned up the hot dogs first, and also added cheese inside the tortillas.  I might add some green onions the next time and black olives.  Perfect comfort food.

Great recipe.....very kid friendly and economical.  I used 3 cans of chili and white corn tortillas.  I also put a little shredded cheese inside each tortilla before rolling them up.  Could almost call it Chili Dog Enchiladas

It doesn't get much easier than this! I wish I'd bought a more expensive canned chili - the stuff I used didn't have a great deal of flavor. Still, I added half an onion finely chopped to the chili, which was an improvement. A dash of chili pepper or some crushed pepper flakes would have been good too. This is a great recipe for when you don't have much time in the kitchen and/or are low on groceries. Thanks, Maxine!

Great idea for a new way to eat hot dogs.  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Our son, not so much, but then again he's not too big on hot dogs.  I made up 4 hot dogs with 1 can of chili with beans.  I loved the quickness of putting this meal together and popping it in the oven.  Serve this with Sweet-and-Sour Coleslaw from this site.  I will be making this again AFTER our son goes back to college.  Thanks Maxine for sharing.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  In reading other reviews about it taking longer to cook, I decided to heat the chili in a sauce pan before transferring to the baking dish.  This really made a difference.  I also used one can of "hot" chili and two cans reduced sodium and also used lower fat hot dogs.  There was more than enough sodium still to go around.  Will make this again and again.

This was awesome and tasted JUST like chili dogs. VERY filling. I spread a little chili, cheese and onions on the tortillas before I rolled up the hot dogs. And I used 3 cans of chili instead of two. Two just wasn't enough. GREAT recipe!

My husband and oldest son (17) ate it and said it was OK.  I know them..if it were really good they would have said so.  What is so puzzling is that my youngest son (9) ate three helpings!  And he can be the pickiest of eaters.  Perhaps he just liked the hot dog weiners in it.  I took the suggestion of others to avoid the refrigerated taste of the hot dog weiner and grilled them first.  Although that helped I probably won't be making this again unless I have some heavy eaters over for dinner.

We thought these were very good, also quite filling!  I put a piece of pepper jack cheese in the tortillas, broke it in half so it would go end to end.  I then topped with 'French's' French Fried Onions.  Great Saturday night meal when you don't feel like going out or tired of 'pick-up'!

My husband loved this. Good filling meal, and quick to make! I subbed turkey hotdogs and turkey chili to make it a little healthier.  I also sprinkled a little cheese and onions in each tortilla. YUM!! Will definately make again.

Love it.  Only thing I did differently is a used chili with beans on the bottom and chili with NO beans on the top, just because I don't like that many beans.  I also heated tortillas over an open flame on stove for a little more flavor from the browned edges before I rolled them.  It turned out great.  Will definitely make again.  My husband had it the next day and said is was very good.  Very easy and quick to make.  I might add some vadallia onions on the side and maybe even try sour cream on the side next time.

If I could give more stars, I would!!! Usually hot dogs are a dreaded dinner at our house by one of my daughters. But she loved this!!!! It's nice to have a dish that is still affordable, still easy and loved by the family. It gives hot dogs a nice change. We added fresh onions on top of ours. Great!!!

Good but extremely salty! I thought an 8 inch tortilla was too much for 1 hotdog so I got the smaller ones and they worked great! I made this dish exactly to the recipe. For me it was way too salty between the chili and the hotdogs, but my husband and children enjoyed it, I would make it again.

My family absolutely LOVED this! I also tried a variation, using a spicy "sloppy joe" sauce with kidney beans added to it instead of the chili.

Oddly enough, chili dogs used to be my favorite food. I think a few months back this would have been a huge favorite of mine. But now that I've lost about 30lbs and I run almost daily, this isnt so appealing to me anymore. Regardless, it was pretty good. My son(14yrs old) went nuts over it and my daughter and wife liked it as well. They all gave it a 5. Hey, you gotta cheat on your diet sometimes right? This is a good choice for a lazy day.

We LOVE this recipe.  My kids do not like beans so I use one can with beans carefully hidden underneath the chili dog and one can without beans on the top where they can see.  I also put a very small amount of chili and cheese inside the tortilla to make sure no one steals all of the good stuff when they take theirs!!!

This is a suprisingly delicious meal -- and very simple to make.  My three-year old daughter helped make this and had a blast.  Rather than spread the first can of chili into the bottom of the dish, we mixed in a little cream cheese and stuffed it into the tortilla with the hot dog.  (I also used a smaller baking dish).  Everyone loved it.  Would have received an additional star, but it sits a little heavy in the tummy -- just the nature of chili dogs I think.

I ALWAYS read reviews before cooking, and followed many suggestions, used what I had & my husband’s picky criteria. Made for 4, Hebrew National hot dogs are favorites, and had on hand. Cut hotdogs down middle, added small slices of x sharp cheddar, broiled till cheese was melted. (I maintained regular oven rack place for general baking.) Removed hot dogs from casserole, then greased casserole pan with olive oil.  Moved to Cincinnati recently, ‘Skyline Chili’ is all over Cincinnati. Local stores carry their chili canned. I had a can. No beans, good for my husband will eat NO beans! I combined 1/3 quinoa with 2/3 rice. When combination was cooked I added about 2 ounces of Skyline Chili. Put combination on bottom of casserole. Putting hot dogs in tortilla shells –added about a tbsp. chili to each, rolled up, laid in casserole. Set oven at 400. Covered casserole with remaining chili (½ a can) spread on all surfaces, baked 7-10 minutes – removed –sprinkled ¼ cup extra sharp cheddar shredded, back in oven till cheese was melted. My husband did not leave a scintilla of quinoa or rice . . . and he never mentioned anything. Nothing means good. This is added to the ‘husband will eat’ relatively short list!

This was definitely different, but came out pretty good!  I used chili without beans as I don't like beans, and added a little sour cream.

When I saw this recipe had 4 stars I thought maybe it somehow transcended a hot dog wrapped in a tortilla.  It didn't.  My 8 year old wouldn't even eat it!  Bummer...

Enjoyed making this casserole for the family. I think you can be as creative as you like and the finished product will taste like chili dogs.  The best thing about it was that all chili dogs were hot and ready at the same time.  I don't like how the chili gets cold when serving up individual dogs and this way they were warm and ready to eat at one time.  I did pan fry the dogs before cooking as per another reviewer. Will make again.

I added a slice of 2% american cheese inside each tortilla with the hot dogs and created another layer of onions only. 

It's a monthly favorite at our house.

My husband and I LOVED this!  If you want a bit more flavor, just spice up your chili.  I mixed in 3 Tablespoons of ketchup, 1/2 onion - chopped, 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce, and 1 tsp. mustard powder.  It's still super easy and adds a bit more variety to the flavors.  I highly recommend this recipe!

As someone else said, this recipe has a lot of potential.  Although it's not my favorite, I like it because both my son and husband will wolf it down and it's super easy to make.  It's yummy as-is but I'll experimenting later.  I will be using this one again!

OMGoodness. I looked at this recipe and said that is not gonna be good. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU!! It IS soo good. Tasted a little like a burrito that I make, but to me, better.. I hoarded the leftovers for myself. I have a fam. of 5 w/ a hearty eating hubby and 2 teenage boys, so, I use a pan one size bigger than a 9x13 and made 12. I took the other readers advise, and added some chili w/o beans to my recipe (in the bed & on top) to make it go a little further. I boiled my weiners in water ahead of time & put a little chili on my tortillas before adding my weiners inside, and sprinkled w/ just a little shred. cheese in there too. Other than that I followed the recipe as instructed. You can def. add any hot dog toppings u like, but u don't need them. It is DELICIOUS by itself.

This was decent, but nothing great. My hubs' opinion is quite different, however. Not only did he NOT like this, he said it was the most awful thing I've ever made (ouch!). This is what it is... good stick-to-your-ribs fare. I love chili dogs and appreciated the fun twist Maxine added to them. Would I say this is better than an actual chili dog? No. Is this an acceptable (and easy) substitute? Yes. Maybe this will float your boat, but unfortunately it didn't ours (well, not my hubby's). Thanks anyways, Ms. Miller! :-)

If the only objective was to have the taste of shili dogs in a single pan so that it was easily portable, I would give this 3 stars. Other than that, this is tasty, but not exicting. Not worth the work either. It tasted just like chili dogs, but chili dogs only take 10 minutes max. This took prep time and required baking.

I ended up taking the hot dog out of the tortilla and slapping it on a piece of bread to eat. I have no idea why anyone would come up with a recipe like this. I realized hot dogs belong in a bun, not a tortilla.

Excellent !! Will never eat Chili Dogs the conventional way again. I put the crumbled corn chips on as well. And as for the person ( Sue ) who gave this 1 star, she didn't even try the recipe. How do you rate it because it sounds bad !! What a nut !!! Great recipe !!!!!

OMG...this is soooooooo good! I made it exactly as the recipe said, but added one more can of chili. Next time, I will make it with homemade chili and add some onions. This casserole is amazing! i disagree with the review telling you to cook the hot dogs ahead of time. It is not necessary! Just leave it in the oven a few more minutes, duh!

This was by far the worst recipe I have ever tried and I have never given a poor rating before.  My husband and son both said to never make this again and they are not picky eaters.  I didn't adjust anything except added an extra can of chili as others suggested.  Will NEVER make this tasteless meal again!!!!

Tried this for lunch today and loved every bite! I did add some onions and sliced olives for some added color. Needed to use up some leftover lavash and used this instead of a flour tortilla. Could not tell the diffference in texture and the lavash held up very well. Was not soggy or mushy.

Great Recipe ! I whipped it up in 10 mins. My wife loved it aswell. I boiled the hotdogs for about 7 mins prior to baking, and I also added mustard and some cheese in the tortilla. I think that was key to the great flavour. I will be making this again

Holy cow this was delicious! I made a turkey variation and used home made chili (See "Simple Turkey Chili" recipe) and turkey dogs. I also try to sub in whole wheat and whole grain where possible, so I used whole wheat tortillas and they came out beautifully. A dish you'll be excited to eat the next day for leftovers!

This was surprisingly good!!  I used fat free turkey hot dogs and boiled them first and used Hormel Turkey Chili.  Everything else was followed exactly.  Even my 7 year old son ate them up :)

I really enjoyed this recipe, and it was quick & easy to make... I did change some things though. I chopped an onion & added it to the 2 cans of chili which I put in a casserole dish. I chopped up the hotdogs & added them to the dish & instead of using tortilas I used bisquick as a topping... w/ shredded cheese on top.

Gooey/cheesy/happiness on a fork :-)  I used 3 cans of chili, and a ton of high quality cheddar.  I rolled sliced cheddar up with the dogs/inside the tortillas too (cause there's no such thing as too much cheese).  This dish was quick and satisfying -just what I was looking for on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

This was not bad. I did heat the hot dogs and tortillas prior to assembling. I will add more chili next time as it did not seem to be enough. It's still a keeper. May try with onions next time as well.

Based on reviews people either love them or hate them, our family tended to be in the love it group.  I used a large can of Hormel chili with beans and cheese hot dogs.  I also added chopped onions and cheese in the the tortilla with the hot dog it isn't fancy but it fills the bill on a busy night

This is a great recipe! My 11-year old loves to make it on his night to cook supper. The only thing we do different is use leftover homemade chili instead of the canned (but I bet it would taste just as good with the canned).

I think this might be my first one star review. Sorry - but I didn't like this much at all. Yeah - it was easy. That's about the only positive thing I have to say about this recipe. The tortillas were mush, the flavor of the cheese was lost and canned chili? Ugh. At the very least do yourself a favor and use homemade chili. I'll take a good ole chili dog any day over this. Sorry to be harsh - but this recipe is just not that good. I followed it exactly and I cannot figure out for the life of me why it has gotten such praise. Being a junk food junkie I thought for sure with the high ratings that I would love it. I was very disappointed but I guess I should have known better. It is what it is and it wont be making it into my regular rotation. I wont be making this again.

My husband was helping me make out the weekly menu and came across this...I made it for him and my 2 boys (ages 3 and 4) and it was a hit. I read previous reviews and did use minced onion and mustard in the tortillas with the hot dogs. I didn't like that so much... next time I will probably quarter some string cheese to put in the tortillas and maybe try the sour cream and onions. This isn't gourmet, but it is very kid-friendly, fast, easy, and cheap. :-) I also threw some frozen fries in the oven as it baked - plenty of chili in the pan to have some chili-cheese fries too.

I used turkey dogs, whole wheat wraps, 2% Mexican cheese (that's what I had), and regular chili with beans.  It was delicious, my 19 month old and 4 year old liked it but not as much as I did.  will definately make again.  It is like a hot dog enchilada.  Thanks.

My family loved this recipe!  I browned the hotdogs first in some butter, and spead a mixture of yellow mustard and stone ground mustard on top of the tortilla before rolling up the hotdog. I also added cheese inside the torilla as well as on top.  I used Hormel chili without beans.  Will definately make again!

This was SO great! I didn't care for how the tortillas got a little soggy, but it was 'workable'. Added cheese and onion to the hot dogs before wrapping them up. Good stuff.

Ok, I can't believe I'm giving this five stars.  Maybe I was really, really hungry.  This is a totally wierd, off the wall recipe, but it is surprisingly good!  I think next time, I'll tuck some cheese into the tortilla before I roll it up.  I made a batch of fries to go with it.  It was almost like chili-cheese fries.  A good game time meal!

OH MY GOODNESS!  Such a switch from normal hot dogs.  The kids love this, think it is just the coolest.  I did add cheese and sour cream to the inside of the roll up.  Wonderful, easy, kid and hubby approved!

Not one for those watching their weight, but I'm sure all of the elements could be tweaked to make it suitable. That said, it was a simple, very tasty dish that I'll be looking forward to making again. Like others, I spread the tortillas with a little mustard, and added finely diced onions with the cheese; and served it with sour cream. Might try a few variations next time, like making a more vegetable-based chilli; however this is a fantastic base for when I don't have the time. Thank for the recipe!

Simple and easy to prepare.  I liked it and my boyfriend thought it was ok, but just needed getting used to.  Added onions and one more can of chili, still needs a little something, though.  Overall, will try again.  Thank you.

I made this recipe with homemade chili instead of canned.  I preferred the taste of my chili over store-bought, but I will not be making this recipe again.  The first bite was pretty good, but as we continued eating it the dish got increasingly more greasy-tasting.  Interesting recipe, though!

My tortillas got slimey and were thoroughly unappealing.  Did not taste much like chili dogs so I'll stick to the traditional dish.

I gave this three stars because my little kids loved it.  The teenagers and hubby and I thought it was just "okay".  That should give you some clue as to the taste appeal of this casserole.  Very quick, easy-to-make, and kid-friendly, but just not that special.  We will make it again for the kiddos when they have a sleepover or something...but will use our hot dogs on the grill the rest of the time.

If you like chili dogs, this recipe was for you - - easy and yummy! However, I would add finely chopped onions when I make it again, and possibly some mustard could be added somehow...I like mustard and onions on my chili dog. The kids loved it, tastes just like a chili dog from a fast food restaurant!

This was easy and the guys loved it, however, I use chili with no beans  and use hot dogs with cheese in the middle of them. I'll stress again how easy and fast this is, a meal in less than an hour with only 4 ingredients is great for after work when you have hungry men to feed!

I needed a quick lunch for my family of four after running errands on Saturday, and this was perfect. 5 stars for ease of preparation and tasty, too. I used hot and spicy hot dogs, which were a little bigger than a regular hot dog, so I used 3 cans of chili (1 on top and 2 to cover). Served each hot dog "enchilada" with chopped onion and mustard.

It was really quick, tasted great.  All my friends loved it.  I used a much bigger baking dish than a 9x13 because I had 8 Hot Dogs to a pack.  The amount of chili was good but next time I'm going to add an extra can.

This is great!  I made two modifications:  Use "bun length" hot dogs, and, use chili "with beans" for the bottom and then "no beans" for the top layer; and then the cheese.

It doesn't get any quicker or easier than this and my kid liked it!  That's a win, win!  I chose angus/no preservative dogs and multi-grain tortillas but if you used regular dogs and flour tortillas this would be really inexpensive too.

Tried this recipe for the first time. Easy recipe. Followed it exactly, just cut the ingredients in half since it's only my husband and I. Next time I will definately add some onions and more cheese. My husband loved it!

Made these this evening.  Put the hot dogs on the grill for a few minutes before wrapping them in the tortillas.  Also followed other suggestions and put onion and mustard in the tortilla with the hot dog.

I might try this again, but use smoked sausages instead of hot dogs/frankfurters.  The wife doesn't much care for hot dogs.  I used the Mexican Fiesta shredded cheese instead of cheddar - gave it more of a Tex-Mex flavor.  I also added some cheese and some chopped onion to each tortilla before rolling.

THis was an excellent dish. A nice twist on hotdogs. I made half the dish using chili with beans and half the dish using chili no beans. I made it with more beans than the recipe called for but only so we had extra to add to the top of our fries. Yummy! Will definitely make this again.

I enjoyed this but couldn't eat more than 2. It seemed a little salty! But still good. I took the suggestions of others and added chili, cheese and mustard to the inside of the tortilla's. Yum!

We were so pleasantly surprised how yummy and delicious this recipe was!  After reading many of the reviews, I did follow some of the changes suggested.  I cooked the hot dogs first, added crushed corn chips both under the rolled tortillas and on top, added cheese and onion with the hot dog before rolling, and used 3 cans of chili with no beans.  It was delicious, and easy!  I did cook it at a lower heat for a longer time, but only because I had to run out and needed dinner ready when we got home.  All in all, a great dinner and fun to make.  Great for kids to help with too!  Thanks Maxine, we'll be making this one again!

I, like other people, just tweeked it a little, I heated the hotdogs first and the tortillas on a griddle. I added a little cheese in the tortillas with the dogs and I cut them in half since it was for a church function. I did one can of chili with and one with out beans. I also added diced onion and mustard.My only mistake was I forgot to cover it so my cheese was not as melty as I would have liked. Still it was awesome!!!

This recipe was absolutely fun, and delicious!  We will definitely be making this one again!  I was even able to make it fit into my Weight Watcher's Online daily points!  And, to top it all off, my family loved it too!  It just doesn't get any better than this!  Thank you to whoever sent this one in!

Great idea...don't think I would have ever thought this up!  Adults & kids of all ages loved it including a one-year-old.  I did add ketchup, mustard, & shredded cheddar to each tortilla before rolling up the hot dog as others suggested. Next time I'm going to add a can of diced tomatoes & chopped onions. Very easy & good!  Thanks Maxine for this kid-friendly, unique recipe.

This was way too salty. None of the three of us could force ourselves to eat it. Chilli cheese dogs are my favorite too.

This was so fun to make.  I followed lots of the previous reviewers' advice.  I wanted to cut down on the salt and fat, so I made my own chili (using chili powder w/out salt).  I put onions, cheese, ketsup and mustard inside the tortillas.  Used organic, lower fat hot dogs.  I steamed some broccoli and cauliflower and put it around the perimeter and sprinkled with the cheese before baking.  My son ate all the veggies.  Yum!

This was fabulous, per my husband.  He thought it was so good I didn't get ANY!   I followed other reviewers and used homemade chili and sprinkled chopped onions on top.  Next time I will double the receipe so I can have some. :)

I loved this and so did my husband ! I tweaked it a little by adding more onions, using corn tortillas and putting on alot more yummy cheese. I rarely use a recipe that I don't tweak a little. This will definitely be a routine dinner on my list of menus.

This was really really good! I think bad ratings would be due to the canned chili-it doesn't always taste so good. I used homemade chili. I did boil the hot dogs and warm the tortillas. In the tortilla I added mustard onion and a little cheese. I then topped with chili,onion and more cheese. My husband was hesitant at first when I mentioned what we were eating, but after he ate 3 servings he couldn't quit raving about how good it was!

Interesting twist to Chili Cheese Dogs.  My family was scepticle at first, but enjoyed the change.  I layered some chopped onions and fritos.  However, not as enjoyable warmed up the next day.

This was a fantastic easy meal!  My whole family loved it, and and my son told me that if I never make another recipe besides this one, that would be fine with him.  I did grill my beef hot dogs first on my George Foreman grill.  I also spread taco bell queso dip on the tortilla first, then sprinkled cheddar cheese and then rolled up my grilled hot dog.  Thanks for a super easy and delicious recipe!

I have never commented on a recipe before, but had to on this one. I was GREAT!!!! I always do new recipes exact, then make up my mind if I need to tweak it. We only eat Ball Park Plumpers. I am going to go stock up on canned chili with beans, because I know my husband is going to want this often and it is such a quick easy meal to do. I will add oinions next time but don't know if I will put them on top before the cheese or in the tortillas, maybe I will do half and half. Love it thank you for sharing.

This was good, but not fantastic. You really need to buy a high quality hot dog for this and I didn't have any on hand. I have 2 teenaged boys - 1 loved it, the other really didn't.

My kids will tell me with new recipes, "It's a keeper." Not this time. What I got was, "Why didn't you just make chili-dogs?" Simple, yes. Quick, yes. Make it again, no. The tortillas added nothing, and as the kids said--it's a chili-dog!

My family loves hot dogs and I came across this receipe while searching for a quick meal I could prepare for dinner.  I have to agree with another reviewer that the 2 cans of chili was barely enough, especially in a 9" x 13" pan.  I also used corn tortillas instead of flour, since that is all I had on hand and placed diced onions and tomatoes on the chili and cheese topping.  My family thought it was great!

I added this to my recipe box a year and a half ago and just now tried it. What a big hit!! Now I'm regretting waiting so long to try this! After reading the reviews, I decided to pre-cook the hot dogs. I added some extra cheese and chopped onions to the inside of the tortillas before rolling them up with the hot dogs. I also added the extra can of chili on top. It was perfect! Will make this over and over!!

I tried this recipe because I was planning to have hot dogs for supper, had forgotten to get hot dog buns and didn't want to go back out.  It is awesome!!!  My son said it tastes like Sonic's chili cheese dog.  I have to agree!  A definite keeper!

This is a very simple recipe but just AWESOME!!  I have made it a few times now and it deserves 5 stars when made according to posted recipe but but I have found a couple alterations we like better.  First, I place shredded cheese in tortilla when rolling up the hot dogs.  Second, we like the kielbasa dogs better.  And lastly, I top the casserole with a jar of con queso.  I serve with chopped onions, sour cream, and crunched fritos.  This is a family favorite and that says alot when I have 2 picky eaters.  Thank you for offering this recipe.

Very good!!!  Made it for my husband his father and brother and they all gave it rave reviews.  My husband said a hot dog is a hot dog but he changed his mind after eating this.  We will have this often.  Did follow suggestions and pre cooked hot dogs under broiler first and added chili, mustard onions and cheese in tortilla before wrapping the hot dogs.  YUM!!

This is one of my family favorites.  To make it a little more healthy, I use turkey dogs and turkey chili.  You don't even know it has less fat.

fun recipe and  tasted better than expected. i used homemade chili and crisped up the hot dogs skins in a skillet for more flavor. i sprinkled crushed corn chips on half but actually enjoyed the non corn chip portion better. next time i will try spreading a little mustard in each roll up since i enjoyed dipping mine in it

Originally I rated this a four, but the second time I wrapped 2 corn tortillas spread with mustard around each pre cooked frankfurter, and topped the casserole off with grated cheese and diced onions.

Okay, I was unsure at first about this recipe but this was the best sounding one that I had found. So, I made it and it was AWESOME!!! Those that are timid about it, don't be...just make it and it will surprise you! Seriously!!! I will definitely make this again. And especially for going on trips and camping, this would be the absolute perfect thing to cook. It's cheap, tastes good, and is super easy to make! Thank you very much for this recipe!!!

i was looking for a twist to serviing chili dogs, while reading all the reviews, I figured, why bother, just heat all up and assemble individually and serve.  No advantage to putting in a casserole.  It is really just a hot dog burritio.

This was alright.  It didn't blow me away, maybe the chili needed more flavor. Or maybe the idea of a hotdog wrapped in a tortilla just weirded me out.

The whole family liked this! I browned the tortillas over an open flame and boiled the hot dogs before wrapping the tortillas around them. I think next time I will use three cans of chili as there wasn't that much on top. I didn't cover it only because I was out of foil. Thanks for the fun meal!!! Oh I also added one chopped onion to the chili.

Easy, tasty, budget friendly.  You can use manicotti instead of tortillas (just slide the 'dogs into the tube) for a spin on it.  Used turkey dogs and turkey chili to cut some fat and still comes out great.

I also nuked the hotdogs a bit before putting in the shells.  I added a little cheese to the dogs before wrapping.  My nieces (6 and 10) loved them.

Much better than I expected!  I used way more chili than the recipe called for though, and used homemade chili I had previously prepared and froze.

Everyone in my house loves this recipe! I always use more chili & cheese than called for because we like them completely smothered. I also put some shredded cheese inside the tortillas with the hotdogs for an oozing effect when you cut into them. Absolutely fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was ok.  I think I'd rather just eat a regular chili dog on a hot dog roll.  At least, that's what it tasted like anyway.  I didn't buy my usual brand of hot dogs as the store was out of them.  That could be why my taste was a little off.  My husband really liked these.  I might make again.

I put the first can of chili with beans[Hormel] in the food processor until they were like a sauce. very thick. added a few tlbs of water. put that on the bottom and on the dog with onion and mexican shredded cheese.  Then I put the second can mixed with a little water over the rolled up dogs.  The chili is very thick and will cook down while in the oven.  topped with more mexican cheese. served with sour cream just like enchiladas.  I also added some texas pete hot sauce to both cans of chili.  This one's a keeper.  I bet this would be great with cooked chorizo sausage.

We do not care for boiled hot dogs much so I thought I'd give this a try. Darn it, they tasted more like boiled hotdogs, but it was still a different unique dish worth trying once..The oven temp was way to hot I thought..

This was really easy and very tasty.  This recipe is far from being complicated but coming up with different ideas that are quick and well-received by the kids makes this a gem.  The possibilities with this are endless too...You could add all sorts of things from onions, to refried beans, etc.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummo!! I made some of the suggested changes by putting chopped onions, cheese, mustard, relish and ketchup inside.  I also used two hot dogs in each tortilla, since I had the big tortillas. They turned out way better than expected!

This is a SUPER EASY, SUPER QUICK, kid friendly meal.  Easy to sub turkey chili and fat free weiners. My picky eaters gobbled it up!  Next time I will add onions as others suggested, and serve w/fritos.  Thank you!

This is a very easy dish something if you want something quick and easy.  This would of been much better with homemade chili and also if using cans I would add an extra can of chili. Next time I think I will make it with homemade chili.  My kids did not like this as much as I thought they would.  Definitely a recipe to keep but not an absolute favorite.

Used my own leftover chili rather than canned chili, and I think it made it taste better.  The kids loved it, but I think I will make again using chicken.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I made this for my mom, dad, and brother && everyone was saying how good it was. Cooking & preparing this meal was very simple yet very flavorful! I did change one thing... I didnt use all the chili and beans at the bottom of the dish but I put some of the chili & beans inside the tortillas. :) When they were done cooking, I topped it off with sour cream && green onions! 


Yum yum yum!

This is definitely a football night food! Added chopped onion and mustard inside the tortillas. Also baked the hot dogs first until they were plumped up. I think it would be so much better with leftover homemade chili rather than canned. I am not a fan of the canned chili taste. It is a great dude-dish.

This was very disappointing. With all the rave reviews, I thought this would be much better than it was. I used Johnsonville casing weiners because they are so delicious, added some taco cheese with the dog before rolling up in the wheat low carb tortilla, and canned chili. I also topped it with the shredded taco cheese mix. Maybe if I used my own chili recipe it would help. Otherwise I thought these were mediocre. I most likely would not make these again.

It's allright.  Edible.  But that's about it.  Regular chili dogs are better.  The only benefit to I see is that since tortillas have a long shelf life, it is a meal that you can keep in your pantry and always be ready to conjure up a dinner in a short timeframe.  I'll keep this in my rotation for that reason.

A new favorite in our house!  Kids and hubby were thrilled!  I sliced the dogs lengthwise and put both slices staggered inside the tortilla.  This way every bite had some meat.  Quick and easy!

I made 6 chili dogs as I only had 3 tortilla shells, so had to cut them in 1/2, worked out great, I also browned the hot dogs and after cutting American cheese slices into thirds put a strip on each hot dog, had some left over chili to use up instead of canned. I was waiting for complaints but got complements! Will fix again.

I've made this recipe for years.
My kids like it when I put a slit in the hot dogs and stuff with a piece of cheese before wrapping them in the tortillas.  Then when you cut into them they are cheesy with every bite.

This recipe is so fast, easy and tasty that it is a must on my list!  My picky two year old ate an entire serving on her own, my husband had seconds!  I addeed 1/4 of a large onion finely diced throughout the chili and inside the tortillas, also put down a layer of taco cheese inside each tortilla before wrapping the hot dog, yum-o!  Thanks for a family-pleaser!

This went over great with my whole family, and it's very easy to make. I tweaked it - spread some mustard on the tortillas and added a bit of cheese, chopped onions and dill pickle chips before rolling them up. I didn't have chili with beans, so used two cans of hot dog chili and one can of baked beans. Used Velveeta instead of cheddar since that's what I had on hand. I made half with franks and half with polish sausage - the kids loved the franks and the adults preferred the sausages.

So quick & easy and incredibly tasty!!!  Next time I'm going to make it with a bit more chili and use smokies instead of beef hotdogs.  This would be a GREAT food to put out for guy's get togethers or sports parties!

Yep!  You can dress up a hot dog all you want, but no matter you do,  it will still taste like a hotdog! We liked it MUCH better with the sausages..I used half spicy and half cheddar sausages. (cooked them first)

This was surprisingly good! I will definitely make it again. It's extremely filling. I did find that I had to cook it 15 minutes longer than stated.

First off, I haven't read all the reviews.  

Overall, it's a nice easy recipe.  It would seem, however, that quality ingredients are key to this one.  I used house brand items for everything (it's what we had on hand), and the results were so so.  I did modify the recipe, but not enough to make it something else.  

I added green onion (as some others have suggested), and only used one can of chili with beans (I used a can of plain ol' chili beans as well).  Other than that, it was spot on.

It's got potential, and I will try it again, but only after I get my hands on some Hormel, or preferably, Wolf's Brand.

Easy and fast to make, smells and tastes so good! The first thing my 18 month old said was mmmmmmmm! My husband "gave me permission" to make this once a week. He was on the phone right after he finished, telling his friend how easy this recipe was to make and how good it tasted. My 5 year old daughter snubbed her nose at it at first, but when she smelled it after it was done she couldn't help but eat it, and loved it. I'm trying to eat healthier these days, so this is perfect for the days I make a salad for myself that no one else likes, and need something else to feed the rest of the family. Two thumbs up from the whole family on this one!

I was skeptical about this recipe but was pleasantly surprised by the taste. It was delicious! Make sure you use a good chili like BUSHE'S. Cheaper canned chilis tend to make the dish watery and kind of bland. Children are sure to love this recipe.

This was ok.  I used Hormel chili and it was kind of bland.  I will make this again but will use Skyline Chili for a little zip.

Delicious!  My teenagers and I loved this.  As recommended I added cheese inside the wrap with the hot dog. Seems like we needed a side, maybe I'll do fries next time.

Using hints from other reviewers, I added some sour cream, cheese and onions on the inside of the tortillas with the hotdogs, and I decided to add some onions on top with the cheese, too.  I also used one can of chili with beans and one without.  A nice change from the normal chili dog, we liked it. Very easy, very quick, dinner was done in 45 minutes from the time I walked in the house. I might try corn tortillas next time just for fun. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe that I make when all the nieces & nephews are over. Many reviewers commented about the fat content; we use turkey hot dogs, low fat turkey chili, & lo fat tortillas. Haven't had any complaints yet. Try a little mustard inside the tortillas for added flavor.

Surprisingly fantastic.  Easy to make, quick, and soooo tasty.  I made up a half recipe (5 dogs) and it was filling enough to feed both me and my husband, and have one dog leftover.  My husband said it was the most creative way to deliver a dog he had ever seen, he also noted that he would like me to put this recipe into my personal recipe book.  Will do!

i'm giving this recipe a high rating simply because it's a great use for leftover chili (which you always get when you make chili). plus, i have a childish love of hot dogs. great for kids as a treat other than proper food.

Try this wonderful recipe out on some teenagers.  I made my own chili and filled a 10 X 15 inch pan.  Three teenaged boys and a hungry husband finished off the whole thing!  I got half a chili dog!  The top browned too fast; next time I'll try baking it at 400 degrees and watching it more closely.  There sure will be a next time.  Great, easy recipe Maxine.  Thanks so much for putting it on for us all to enjoy.

It was OK. It made a lot of food for one person (lasted for 6 meals). I guess I just didn't like the pairing of flour tortillas and hot dogs all that much. I probably won't give this another try, sorry.

A chili dog without the work of putting it together.  This has to be one of the easiest & most tasty dishes I've made!  I broiled my hot dogs first & added some onions on top.

Very simple and yummy recipe!  I would suggest heating the tortillas in the microwave for 20-30 seconds before wrapping the hot dogs so they're more pliable.  I might add some chopped onion next time for a little kick.

Not too bad...husband liked it, but 8 yr old son didn't like the canned chili.  Never use canned chili to begin with, but gave it a whirl.  My son wanted me to make this again, but with "my" chili.  Next time, I'll try it with homemade chili.  Definately a good recipe for chili dog lovers....a nice change.

My 13 year old and his friends devoured this recipe.  I have never seen my son eat so good.  He is very very picky!  Whoever decided to come up with this one did a GREAT job.
Thank You!

Excellent cheap and easy meal.  It's so simple, I wonder why I had never heard of it before?  I don't use the full amount of buns, though, because that's too much bread for my family's tastes, so I use about 3/4 of the amount called for.

The family thought it was okay, but we worked out some changes for the next try.  First, I will be using homemade chili, my family is not fond of canned chili but love chili dog chili from a can when we can find it.  Second, it was a little chili poor, so we will be adding the equivalent of a third can.  Lastly, add a small amount of cheese to the interior of the tortilla wrapped dog.  

My son pointed out that there is no ketchup flavor like a real chili dog, my wife felt the same way about mustard.  Therefore, put out the normal hot dog condiments for doctoring the casserole.

Very easy and tasty. The tortillas were a little chewy so next time I will just leave them out. Maybe it was just a strange combo for me but still had great taste. I did cook the hot dogs before putting them into this casserole.  Fritos would be a good addition to the top.

I followed directions but cut in half - 4 hotdogs, etc. - and added onions. Personally I found this recipe to be less than appetizing.

The recipe is easy to make, but be sure to put the oven on the high temperature so everything cooks well.  Others said the hot dogs were not done - but ours were.  My husband and I both liked the recipe (I made it exactly as written).  We were unsure about the beef frankfurters because we had not had them before.  One thing we both agreed upon is that this needed much more chili and beans.  Next time I'll use 3 or 4 cans.  I may also try different hot dogs and chili's next time to see if it tastes any differently.  Thanks for posting, it was quick and easy.

I didn’t have really high hopes for this dish as it was soo easy, and had simple ingredients.  Well, whether you use your own chili or canned , you will be pleasantly surprised.
I didn’t add onions to the dish before cooking.,but allowed my family to add afterward, along with extra cheese or chopped jalapeños.
Thanks for the recipe!

A lot of good flavor! I used my chilli but it really sogged out the tortillas, not pleasant. Next time I'll use canned chilli. If that doesn't work... then I'll eliminate the tortillas and sprinkle taco chips on top. I also used Hillshire Farm beef sausage, 1/2 diced red onion and small can of black olives.

This recipe was good. I did add onion and cooked the onion and hot dogs before adding them. I would like to try it with brats or something besides plain old hot dogs. Has anyone tried something else with it.
Will make this again.

The recipe was fast and easy to make but it was a bit too salty for me. I’m going to make it again using homemade chili beans and beef hotdogs instead of turkey dogs.

I used regular hot dogs instead of beef frankfurters and it still turned out fantastic. It was a big hit with everyone including my mother in law. i will be fixing this again.

I was scared to try this but it wasn’t bad. I think it should be called baked chili cheese dogs. That sounds way better. I added mustard to the dogs and diced onion to the top. I used regular hot dogs, not beef. And I used one can with beans and one can without and it was PLENTY of beans!  I used prob a bag and half of cheese. I baked for 30 min with foil and 5 more min without foil and I had no prob with the dogs not being hot.  I did think the tortillas were a bit soggy but still okay. My husband suggested trying it with crescent rolls instead of tortillas if I make it again

I will make it again, but lower the temperature because the chili burned on the bottom of the pan. Otherwise, made as is and had no complaints.

Everyone loved it. So this recipe will be a keeper. The one thing I did different is I put mozzarella cheese on the tortilla and layed the hot dog on it and rolled it up.  It was yummy

This recipe is surprisingly good! Made it pretty much as written, with a few tweaks. Halved it, found six, 6" taco sized tortilla roll ups fit perfectly in my  8 X 12 dish. I used Ball Park's fat (size) turkey hot dogs, and boiled them first as reviewers suggested.  I also added the cheese and chopped olives inside the tortilla, also as suggested. I found one  roll up filled me up!  Will freeze the other five for quick meals later. Come cold weather, when I make chili, I'll use my own here. Recommend.

Beside other kid-friendly foods, I made this for my 10 yr. old son's birthday party, 'cause I felt that kids like hot dogs, and would gobble this up.  The all took some, but no-one finished their portion.  They didn't like the beans in the chili, and they didn't like the tacos.  They all said it was very salty, and they'd rather have hot dogs in a bun, so my DH ran to the store to buy more hot dogs & some buns.  The grown-ups also had some of this, and no-one cared for it.

Even the 9 year old loved it. Granted we added re-fried beans and salsa but this was a huge hit. For my dish I used Turkey sausages and for the boy-folk I used the fatty cheddar stuffed, artery clogging, pork filled bangers.  Both dishes a sold to repeat.

Since I love chili dogs and I love burritos I thought this might work.  I just made a few slight changes.  I grew up eating chili with no beans, and don't care for them so I used Chili without beans.  Also added taco sauce on top and sour cream after the baking was done.   Very easy dish.

I really tweaked this recipe. My family doesn't like hotdogs, so I used Polish Dogs. I scooped just a little bit of the meat out and stuffed the Polish Dog with shredded colby-jack cheese. I also added just a little bit of shredded colby-jack  cheese to the inside of the tortilla before I rolled it up. Since my husband is not a big chili fan, I added some sour cream, shredded colby-jack cheese, and diced onions to the chili and cooked it on the stove until the cheese was melted. Not only did I cover the wrapped Polish Dogs with the  remaining chili mix, I also added some shredded colby-jack cheese and fresh diced tomatoes to the top before it went in the oven. This dish after all my tweaks paid off. It was a big hit with my family.

I baked this after a long day and enjoyed that it was easy to assemble and tasty. Inside the tortilla, I added a squirt of mustard, scant teaspoon of chopped red onion, a slice of bacon (pre-cooked), and some shredded cheese. I also used turkey chili, though I will likely make my own next time and lower fat hot dogs.

Great dish for a quick lunch.  It tasted better than I thought it would.  My husband called it a chili dog enchilada.  haha  I think chopped onion is a must.  I added the shredded cheese I had on hand.  It was a Mexican cheese blend.  I suggest covering the casserole dish with aluminum foil to prevent cheese from browning or drying out.

This was okay, and certainly easy to make, but I felt it was lacking something. With some adjustments I think it'd be better.

My wife has been making this for years and its one of my FAVORITES!!
We use refried beans and mustard on the inside, oh and onions. Then the chilli and cheese.
Reckon I have about 3lbs of it around my waist:)

Even the pickiest son loved it and he's not a fan of chili.  Doubled everything but the cheese.  I did cook the dogs prior to wrapping.  Will make again!

I have made this recipe for all the guys in the repair shop that work on my car. They absolutely LOVED it!  I served it with Chopped onions and jalapeno peppers on the side with different mustards.  It is so easy to make and so great tasting.  I would recommend this for a late dinner night, or family TV night ... you will love it to.

This was just weird. I told my hunny I think we would like it better if we were a bit drunk. I think next time I will just use the leftover chili to make actual chili dogs. Made exactly as stated about except used homemade chili instead of cans, what was on hand. Other big downfall is we cook so there is leftovers for lunch the next day and I have yet to eat mine but hunny said they don't reheat very nicely.

Amazingly simple and good.  Made as directed, but just used plain chili and a whole big onion chopped on top of the two chili layers. Cooked for about 40 minutes (the wieners were perfectly warm inside)  Delicious.  Great with a little mustard on top and a side of fries to dip in left over chili/cheese.  These seriously might replace chili dogs for me.  Easier and the tortillas don't get soggy at all.  Thank you!

This was a super easy dish to make and it tasted delicious.  It only takes a couple of minutes to put it all together and pop it in the oven.  Be sure to get a good can of chili that you like, I used Wolf chili without beans.

I made this today. It was awesome. I used 1 can chili on bottom, ground the hotdogs with cheese, filled the tortilla's with ground dog/cheese, topped filling with a healthy squeeze of mustard, rolled up tortilla and placed on top of chili. Topped tortilla rolls with 2 more cans of chili, and since I had extra dog/cheese grind, I topped the chili with what I had left, I added more ground cheese on top of that, added some chopped onions too. Since I had some time before supper, I covered with plastic wrap and placed in frig till I cooked it. Wonderfully easy. Real Man pleaser!

These are awesome.. I like mayo mustard on my dogs so I added it to the tortilla nd some cheese and rolled it up.. For my husband I added some sour cream inside and salsa. We both loved them. Even better the next day reheated.

This was great - kids loved it.  Used turkey dogs and low-fat chili. We are not terribly health-conscious, but this was Delicious with just a few changes.

This was great out of the oven, however a few thoughts.  I thought it was a bit dry and could be a bit more sloppy.  The tortilla's were a bit doughy, but I would make again with some changes which I haven't figured out yet.

Tasted amazing. Next time I will wrap some shredded cheese in with the hot dogs because we felt there just wasn't enough cheese. I also had to add 2 cans of chili because I bought the bigger hotdogs so I needed a bigger pan. But I will definitely make this again. Oh and I used no bean chili.

This was so good and so easy!  I did use turkey chili with beans, 97% fat free hot dogs, and whole wheat flour tortillas.  I also added some chopped onions to the chili.  I will be making this again!

Very easy to do and came out great. I added BBQ sauce, salsa and chopped onions on top. Sauce added a tangy sweetness and medium salsa added a little kick. Recommend

I used turkey dogs, whole wheat tortillas, 98% fat free hormel chili, and 2% milk low fat mexican style cheese to make this a bit healthier. I added rolel tomatoes and green chili in the tortillas along with chopped onions. I put a layer or onions under the cheese and jalapenos on top and crunched up tortilla chips on the very top. It was delicious!!!

Bf really liked this; I liked it too but thought it could use ketchup or mustard; he just loved it as is.  I used less chili (bc that's what I had) and ww tortillas.  I used more cheese and put a slice in each tortilla with a bit of chili and the hot dog before rolling up.  Then I just topped with cheese slices (also what I had).  I cooked the hot dogs by frying them in a dry skillet then proceeded with the recipe.  Pretty good, thanks!  Would be even better with homemade chili I'm sure!

I think this is a good concept.  However, I prefer regular chili dogs.  This dish was just too heavy for my liking.  I used turkey chili and turkey dogs to cut down some of the calories, but then again you don’t eat chili dogs as a low calorie meal =)  I probably won’t make this dish again.

It was great right out of the oven.  Not good as a leftover, tortilla gumy.

The canned chili was too thick and made the casserole dry.  I'll try it making my own chili.

This was really yummy - the only changes I made were:  I used corn tortillas instead of flour and I rolled up 1/2 slice of american cheese into it with the hot dog.  My 14 year old loved it!

Very good comfort food. I added Jalpeno and chopped onion in the tortilla with a thin spread of salsa. I topped the cheese with crushed Tortilla Chips.

I made this earlier this week for my husband and I. I thought it might taste kind of stange with a tortilla shell, but it was actually REALLY good!! He put his only traditional chili dog toppings on it and I put my regular chili toppings (hot sauce, sour cream). 
I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dinner. I made it pretty much by the books, however, I did substitute Oscar Meyer 98% Fat Free franks for the beef hot dogs. I also used 1 can of regular Hormel chili without beans and 1 can of Hormel turkey chili without beans. It turned out awesome! Will definitely make this recipe again!

Ok this is the first rating or review I have done. When I told my husband about the recipe he kind of made a "ewww" face....when I got it done, he could NOT stop eating it.  He said he would like it at least once a week.  I made my own homemade chili and it was wonderful.  Thank you for an inexpensive, fun, different meal!  Yummmmy

I debated on cooking this, but finally did. I did take some suggestions. I made my own chili and also put mustard, onions, and velveeta cheese inside the wrap! And it was amazingly good! I will place this in rotation with my other meals! I normally don't give reviews, but this one I had to! I will put this in rotation with my other meals!! Thanks

This was actually really good, although from the reviews I expected it to be.  Followed some other reviewers choices and used turkey dogs, but I would still like to try it with beef dogs.  Used low carb flour tortillas and precooked the dogs. Very tasty.  Had it as leftovers the 2nd day  and could have nuked it a bit longer since the dogs were cool.

There's this unbelievably low glycemic index food called chana dal. buy it at an indian grocer. I'm going to make it with chana dal instead of beans. I will make the dal into chilli first, the fastest way by FAR is in a pressure cooker!!!!! I'm going to leave out the tortillas to save around 100 cal. per person, otherwise, yum. I'm going to use fat free hot dogs and 75% less fat cheddar which a brand called cabot makes, thanks maxine, I hope my changes don't offend you. CHEOAH, I LOVE hotdogs too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I cut all the hot dogs and wraps in half before I added the chili on top, so it would be easier to remove from the pan.   My sister has made it for her family too.  Everyone is right....too easy.

My 7 year old daughter wanted to make dinner all by herself so I picked this recipe for her. I was not expecting it to be so good. It was really, really good and she (and I) was so proud for doing it by herself. She is already planning to make it as a surprise for Sunday football for her daddy.

I followed others' advice by pre-cooking the hotdogs as well as the chili since I was using half homemade leftovers and half canned.  I also used half mild cheese and half processed cheese (as you can tell it was "use what you have in the pantry night.")  My children were starving and getting cranky so I also ended up finishing the dish in the microwave.  Even with all of the "make do's" my kids scarfed these down and demanded more.  I thought the tortilla business would scare them off, but it ended up being what they liked the best.  Thanks for a quick, easy, yummy recipe that adapted well to leftovers!

couldn't get past the tortilla idea. they turned out a little soggy (i even browned them a little) and the hotdogs didn't get an chili attention. might make again but with my own modifications.

My husband and I both liked these.  I fixed half with flour tortillas and half with corn tortillas.  There are so many ways to adjust these to individual tastes but the recipe as submitted is a great starting point.

This was fun to make and a nice change for a quick casserole. I didn't have canned chili but used a can of chili without beans and then chili beans drained mixing them together. I also used sausage weiners with skin on it. It was crunchy and great. You can put anything in these that you like on your chili dogs. We added onions and pickle relish. Try it if you are looking for a "fun" casserole.  You won't be disappointed.

This was delicious and my family really enjoyed it.  Certainly a quick and easy kid friendly meal.  I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and boiled the hot dogs first as well as added "toppings" (ketchup, etc) to the inside of the tortillas.  We'll definitely be having this again!

This was Not a hit with my family. I followed the recipe and boiled them like some others did, and it turned out perfect and looked beautiful, but did not have the taste.This is great for someone that does not like to cook or someone looking for something fast to make. I could eat it maybe once every 3 years.

This was a big hit with hubby and all three kids.  I made a large batch of homemade coney dog sauce and used that instead of canned chili.  It was delicious - so much better than I expected!!!! Like other reviewers, I boiled the hotdogs first before rolling them in the tortillas.  FYI: I used the small taco size tortillas with regular size hotdogs and they were perfect. I'm really glad I gave this recipe a try - I'll definitely be making it again.

This was really yummy!  The only thing I did different was that I forgot to cover it with foil, it still came out great.  It was super easy to make, the whole thing from start to finish was on the table in about 35 mins.  I used Stagg turkey chili and chicken hot dogs, and lowfat cheese.

What a super simple, super quick, & tastes good too recipe!  I spread the tortillas with mustard & a little mexican cheese.  Used homemade chili, so I just eyeballed the amount.  Sprinkled onions on after they came out of the oven.  We loved them!

This was surprisingly good.  I did add the onions and thought it needed WAY more cheese.  The family gobbled it up, even the kids.

Wow, this was fabulous!  I did take the suggestions to cook the hot dogs first.  Added mustard inside the tortillas and then topped with chopped onions between the top chili layer and the cheese layer.  When you cover with foil, spray the cheese side with PAM otherwise it will stick and come off when you uncover it.  I loved this and will be making it again!!!  Michelle

This dish makes a great weeknight dinner because it is so fast and easy. My kids absolutely love it and like that they get to help "cook" by rolling the hot dogs in the tortillas. I have made it exactly like the recipe calls for and I have also substituted turkey franks and low-fat cheese to make it a little healthier. Both ways are equally delicious!

As hard as it is for me to say, the 2 guys I cook for thought this was pretty much the best thing I ever made (big surprise)! Even my 1 year old daughter ate this. Total crowd pleaser. I'll probably be making this at least 2x a month. Super cheap too! Used 97% fat free kosher dogs, whole wheat tortillas (rolled up with a little mustard, cheese, diced onions), 1 can turkey chili, and 1 can lean beef chili with beans. YUM!

My husband and son loved this, but I am not a chili fan, and just didn't enjoy this at all. I'll make it for them again, but I will make something a bit less heavy for myself.

I need to doctor this up a bit. It wasn't bad but I should have read other reviews. The kids ate it but sure didn't "love" it. It's different that's for sure, we get tired of the same old stuff. I will try it again. I'm actually giving it three and half stars. Thanks for sharing.

Half of my family that ate this loved it the other half said it was ok. I used cheese hot dogs and put a little chili in the tortillas. I think adding onion might of gave the taste something extra.

This was pretty good. We love chili dogs so I am excited about now having a new way to make them! I too diced an onion and put that in the tortilla along with some shredded cheese. Turned out nicely. Will try with homemade chili next time. Thanks for the post.

Everyone absolutely loved this recipe! My family doesn't care for just plain hot dogs, we usually eat them wrapped in biscuits or cresent rolls.  This was a wonderful change.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was add a bit of cheese inside the tortilla. Otherwise, I wouldn't mess with this recipe. Thanks!

My boyfriend says this is his new favorite.   very very good.  I use hormel canned chili; one hot w/ no beans, one mild w/ no beans and one with beans. i also put cheese and onions inside the tortilla with the hot dogs and sprinkle chopped onion on top, under the cheese. terrific comfort food.

I thought it was okay, my husband loved it! I think part of what made it so good, though, was the homemade chili. Not sure how much I would like it with canned stuff. Plus, I had some in the freezer so it was easy. I would make this again because it was cheap, easy and fairly tasty.

I made this for a "foods from childhood" themed dinner party and was somewhat doubtful of how it would taste.  It was a surprise hit.  I don't recommend eating more than one (or even one half) of a hot dog at a time, however.  Though we may still love those foods from childhood, our metabolizims do not!

For speed this dish is great.  Have to use the smaller tortilla's or else it is too bready.  Once I actually put 2 hot dogs in each of the larger shells and that turned out fine.  It is not fancy food but it is quick and filling.  I always use the chili without beans as my family hates beans in their chili.

This was great!  The whole family enjoyed it.  I used turkey keilbasa and sliced it in half, instead of hot dogs.  I also microwaved the sausage for a minute before baking it.  Love how simple it was to make.

I tried this with turkey dogs and a canned turkey chili... they were okay, but I liked the concept.  It definitely depends on the kind of chili you use. Next time I'll use homemade chili!

I kind of had mixed feelings about this one. It was good, quick and easy but the next time I make it I will probably make some changes. The hot dogs seemed to taste a little dry to me. I think it will be better with some cheese and maybe some extra chili tucked inside the tortillas to prevent that.

I thought this was a great recipe -- it's basically a chili dog wrap, which is less messy than the regular bun and easier to eat with a fork. I served it to a friend and she loved it!

Given the fact that you can throw this together in under 5 minutes, it was pretty darn good!  I used 6 weiners only, and given that I only had 10" tortilla's I just cut each one in half.  On the downside, the flavor of the cheese was really lost and I think next time I will try rolling each hot dog in a cheese slice, then the tortilla, top with chili and bake.  I know, I know...cheese slices are gross, but this is what it is!!

So easy and cheap! I did take another reviewers advice and boiled the hot dogs, and microwaved the tortillas first. Then added cheese in the tortilla. The only thing I'll do differently is add a can and a half to the bottom and top of the hot dogs, instead of one can of chili. Maybe onions, also. But even without, the taste was great.

I always kinda wanted to try the chili dog casserole with the buns but I knew my DH wouldn't like soggy bread, so when I saw this I thought we eat soft tortillas in a lot of things and tried it.
Personally I loved it! I added some mustard to the top of mine but it really didn't need it, I didn't have any shredded cheese so I used sliced cheesed still tasted great the DH gave this a thumbs up, I halved the recipe for the 2 of us.  please note I used turkey chili and lowfat hot dogs, tasted full fat and very satisfying for some reason I thought it was more filling than regular chili dogs. Thanks for the awesome recipe

I was a doubting Thomas all the time I was preparing this dish but I thought it was very good and would make again.  I did make my own chili and would recommend this.  Also, I can't see how two cans of chili would have come close to being enough to cover.  I was afraid the flour tortilla would not be good but was excellent.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was better than I was thinking it would be.  I think other reviewers are right, you should cook the dogs first.  I made this with homemade chili and wrapped some cheese in with the dogs.  The tortilla came out a little soggier than I would have liked, and it seemed like it just needed something else.  Truthfully, we like regular chili dogs better.

I give this 5 stars for the ease,I think it was the fastest dinner I have ever made. My family enjoyed it, even my husband and daughter who don't even like hot dogs. Be careful to not overbake it, the tortillas get hard and it isn't as good.

My family all thought this was a very good recipe. It is quick and easy to make and easy on the budget. I pretty much followed the recipe, but also added the cheese in the wrap with the hotdogs, and I also added a can of corn the the can of chili I put on top of the hotdogs. It was a good addition we thought, and served it with sour cream. My 18 month and 5 year olds ate it up, we will be making this again, thats for sure!

This was surprisingly good - sorta like a cross between a burrito and a chili dog.  :o)  I browned my hot dogs in a skillet before wrapping them with a slice of cheese in the tortillas.  I also topped everything with sliced American cheese and it worked great.  We used 2 cans of turkey chili with beans also.  Hubby said he wouldn't mind having it again, so this one is going into our file.  Thanks for a great and EASY recipe!  :o)

Awesome, nice and simple, i love tasty simple recipes. I used one can of Stag Chili and Dempsters Cheese Tortillas, Cheddar cheese on top, plus some freshly grated black pepper. Oh, and on the advice of other reviewers, i boiled the (All Beef Costco) wieners first.

This recipe was very easy.  I added some cheese inside the tortilla as well to give it some extra flavor.  I don't like chili all that much, but it was pretty good.  My boyfriend loved it.  Definately "man food" that I will make again.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe!  Only change I made was using one can chili w/o beans, one with.  This is because I don't like the beans but hubby does.  With this change there are enough beans for him and not too many for me.  I served it with a side of Mexican rice.  Thank you!

My son liked it but the rest of my family weren't thrilled about it. I thought it was easy to make and had a different taste than regular chili dogs. It's a great meal for small kids.

I followed the advice of others here and added cheese inside the tortillas. I used low fat cheese and turkey dogs and used chili with no beans. Everybody liked it and I will make it again.

I prepared this receipt using low fat or fat free ingredients.  I added a dollop of low fat sour cream on top just before serving.  I also offered chopped onions on the side.  Then, for the second batch, I changed it up a bit.  Again using low fat or fat free.  Instead of using chili I used baked beans.  I also switched the cheddar to American.  If I make the baked bean version again I will use cheddar to see how it turns out.  The family gave the chili version a “good” rating.  The baked beans an “o.k.” rating.

Ok, so this is basic but I really like chili dogs and I really liked this. The tortillas got a bit soggy after the first half hour so maybe I'd fry them like you do for enchiladas. My husband didn't care for this much but he doesn't love chili dogs! I'll make this again.

I liked this recipe!  It was really good.  I made it exactly as posted.  All three of my kids ate it which is a miracle in itself.  I'm going to try making it next time by using lower fat ingredients.

This wasn't bad. All I had I had on hand was generic chili, so the next time I make it, I will go with a name brand chili. My husband really likes it, but agrees with me on the chili.

The recipe looked good, but I almost fell over when I read the nutrition label for this. OVer 800 calories for one serving and 47grams of fat for one serving? YIKES! I tried it anyway, but I Used 99% fat free turkey dogs, 2% cheese, corn tortillas, instead of chili beans, I used canned Hormel Turkey Chili and some xtra seasoning and the calories were cut in half, the fat by 2/3 and it tasted very good! (maybe not quite as good as the full fat version, but nothing ever is) I am still trying to figure out how the submitter got 6 servings from 10 hot dogs and tortillas....lol...

This was just a mess. I was really excited about trying this as I had it saved forever in my recipe box but I should have left it there. The franks tasted almost raw and I know it was well cooked but baking inside of the shell just makes it taste undone. I think the concept is good but maybe a few changes would help. Really didn't enjoy this and neither did anyone I served it too. Thanks for sharing though.

This was awesome! I made two dishes, one turkey dogs and turkey chili, the other beef dogs and beef chili. No one could tell the difference! Inside the tortillas I put some chopped oninons and sprinkled a little pepper along with the hot dogs. EVERYONE loved it! The kids especially since they are chili cheese dog lovers. I served it with seasoned fries. This one is keeper!!

I used fat free hot dogs (IMO, Oscar Meyer are the best), turkey chili and fat-free cheese.  I'm used to substituting low-fat versions of things, but I don't know how other people would feel about these changes.  I thought it was pretty good, though not a 'wow' -- and very easy.  I'm sure kids would love them.  Good thing for a lazy night.

We love chili dogs...so this was right up our alley. I used Wolfe brand Hot chili cause we like it spicy and I like chopped onions on my chili dogs, so I put some on top.  I also doubled the cheese, we like a little food with our cheese!

I was in the mood for something easy and different and this covered both. I'm not a huge fan of chili, but this was really good! It tasted like it was missing something so I might add onion or some type of spicy seasoning to spruce it up next time. Very filling too!

This was just OK.  I think I would've rather made hot dogs wrapped in ready made dough and had the chili on the side.  I probably won't make this one again.

Everyone loved this, and that rarely happens in my family.  I used mozzerella and cheddar cheese and sprinkled it both inside and on top of the "enchiladas"! Will be doing this one again.

I give this a four because my chilren gobbled it up while my husband hated it.  I thought it was great for a quick Saturday meal.  I used turkey chili with beans and my kids asked me to leave out the beans next time.  This did not stop my three little ones from polishing off the whole dish though. I only got one hot dog!

This has quickly become a favorite of ours. I now serve it on game nights, when we have anywhere from 4-10 people over, and no one's turned it down yet! We put sour cream on top, after serving. I just put the cheese overtop the whole thing, instead of wrapping it in the tortillas. It comes out just as good and is even easier!

This is really good but really fattening. I would advise buying top of the line chile for this meal. The higher quality the better. I made it once with canned and once with home made and both times this was really tasty. I would make this again for fun food nights but its just too rich and high in fat for a regular meal.

This was ok. I like real chili dogs better. I didn't really care for the tortillas. I added onions to mine. I think it would have been bland without them. I don't think I'll make this again.

This was awesome! Exactly what I look for in a recipe - fast, easy & delicious! My 2 kids loved it - my husband & I also loved it, even though it is quite a bit fattening. I used turkey hotdogs instead - personal preference. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

My 5 year old son wants to be a chef when he grows up.  He made this recipe (with supervision) and we all LOVED it!  We used leftover homemade chili and added shredded cheese inside the tortillas with the hotdog.  UNBELIEVABLE GOOD!

Great for a quick, easy, and CHEAP dinner.  Kids loved it.  Even my picky 8-yr old son.  He ate as much as my husband.  I don't think I'd fix this for a dinner party, but it is great birthday party food!  Thanks for the recipe!

My family and I love this recipe.  It has also become my first choice when making food for someone who has had a baby or experienced loss.  I add a (10.5 oz)can of chili-no beans to make it a little saucier.  Easy, inexpensive and so tasty!

I made this for my boyfriend because he loves chili dogs and it turned out OK. It's definetely not my favorite supper but it wasn't gross either. He liked it but I couldn't wait to get my plate clean so I could eat something else. I'll probably make it again someday when I'm short on time.

This recipe was very quick and easy to make! My kids thought it was ok, my boyfriend and I both liked it, not a favorite but was a good, easy, quick meal that everyone would eat.

This recipe was OKAY, my kids seemed to like it and I probably will make it again one day.  It's one of those things you can eat but don't want it again for quite a while.  Very quick, easy and satisfying though.

Sorry, but we didn't like this--even my two ravenous sons home from college turned up their noses (reminded them of dorm food).  the tortillas became doughy--yuk.

Great recipe!  Hubby liked it very much and he is not a real hot dog eater.  I've substituted low sodium chili with beans and also turkey chili with beans with very little affect on the taste of the dish.  Good, quick, and easy - Three BIG pluses!!  8-)

This is easy and delicious! Also can be made almost entirely fat-free with fat-free hot dogs and cheese and turkey chili. My husband didn't notice the difference.
