This was the first custard pie I'd ever made.  I took it for Christmas dinner and it was quite the hit!  I do think that maybe something that could use to be noted is that the cook time was longer than on the recipe page.  It took me about 35 minutes to get it to set, at 400F.  I was using a gas stove, which may have been the reason.  Regardless, it was a very tasty dessert!

I found that from past experience that if you 
scald the milk instead of using it cold, it will
set the pie quicker.  I scalded the milk and it 
took 25 minutes to bake.  It was good but tasted
somewhat flat.

I scaled this recipe down to half and made in a small springform pan. I used Chef John's pie crust recipe (excellent). I had to bake it for about 40 minutes though. 15 minutes is definitely not enough. I LOVE the flavor. It was very easy to do. It's almost like eating flan without the caramel and inside a pastry crust :o) Will make again

Perfect custard pie. It got the five- star rating from my husband, who grew up in Massachusetts where these pies are very traditional. Excellent.

I thought this was good.  It did, however, take forEVER to set and I ended up baking it for about an hour!! I used a graham cracker crust.  We had it on Thanksgiving and everyone seemed to enjoy it as a nice change from the usual.  My sister said it tasted like quiche and that she would have a leftover piece for breakfast the next morning!  :-P

Pie tasted great, was easy and had a great texture. It took about 35 minutes to set for me. I like a little more spice so think I will add a smidge more nutmeg and some cinnamon. Thanks for theecipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I used half n half instead of milk to make a richer pie. I also added a pinch of salt. The baking time was about 30 min. I baked it at 350 because I had other pies in the oven. I also prebaked the crust for about 10 min. The texture was smooth, the perfect richness, delicious!  I'll be making this pie regularly!

Very easy recipe to make and it turned out really good. The cooking time was longer than what was listed - about 40 minutes to get it to set, but the flavor is very good. I drizzled it with warm dulce de leche sauce. Delicious!

I would add a more sugar.  I would also like to try cooking it in a double boiler for a bit before baking, just so it's a bit creamier and smoother.

No changes to the recipe except to use gluten-free crust and add a bit more vanilla.   It's a good old fashioned pie that's not too sweet like so many other desserts are these days.

I found this recipe delightfully easy to make but absolutely delicious and eggy.  I did add a little more nutmeg as it is a holiday favorite flavor in my family.  I did have to bake it for 55 minutes until the knife came out clean and it was set.

I also served it with homemade whipped cream sprinkled with nutmeg.

I think this was probably the most simple pie I’ve ever made. It’s very smooth and super easy to make. I used duck eggs since that is what I had and it was delicious. Husband and son were hoping for it to be sweeter, but that’s a matter of taste not a recipe flaw.

Phenomenal! I think my husband would prefer a bit less of an eggy-tasting custard so next time I'll make a few tweaks to draw out more sweetness, like adding a bit of salt and maybe a tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk like another recipe I found online suggested. I thought it was perfect as is though! Took about 40 minutes to bake.

Easy and turned out good. Definitely had to increase baking time to around 40 minutes in my oven. Next time I think I’ll add a little more sugar because it wasn’t sweet enough for my taste.

Very good, similar to a flan made from eggs and sweetened condensed milk, but this is less heavy and sweet. Made two versions: as the posted recipe, and another with evaporated milk, both are good, but I prefer the one with the evaporated milk.

It's not a bad recipe and very easy to make, but like a lot of the other reviewers it needed much longer to bake than 15 minutes. I think I baked mine between 45-50 minutes. I love custard pie but this one didn't quite taste like other pies I've had. There are other recipes I'd like to try. This one was ok.

My husband and I really liked this!  I used almond milk for dietary reasons and pumpkin pie spice because I was out of nutmeg.  Had to bake 50 minutes to set...not sure if the time in the recipe was a typo or what.

Everything was wrong, ratio of ingredients and time and temp.  I am an experienced cook.  No way to know ahead of making that it will be one less dessert for the holiday.

I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg&I think next time i will use 2/3 sweetened evaporated milk. Just for that little extra sweetness. But it was good.

Tried this recipe, it's pretty tasty, but it takes far longer than 15 minutes to set, closer to an hour.

This was the first custard I've ever made aside from a flan which is similar I suppose. It was good, but if I make it again I might add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg in with the pie filling.

Good tasting custard pie, first one I tried to make myself.  Pretty simple but definitely the description above needs to be changed to at least a 30 minute cooking time.  At 15 minutes my pie was still liquid. Next time I'm going to try it with raisins.
