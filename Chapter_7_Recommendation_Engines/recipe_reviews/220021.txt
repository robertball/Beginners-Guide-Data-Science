I  baked the first 6 to see how they taste. I couldn't taste the pineapple or coconut so I added more pineapple in and coconut sprinkled on top with sugar for the second test. Upon tasting them I added more pineapple, coconut and dried cranberries. Then I could taste the pineapple a little more and I just love cranberries. I wont make this recipe again but thanks for sharing.

These are very cake-like, and bland.  They would be great for whoopie pies perhaps, but the pineapple and coconut are lost in dough.  Not something I would do again, but it did sound good.
