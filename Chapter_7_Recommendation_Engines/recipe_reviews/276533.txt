I made half the recipe and still got 24 cookies. I only used 1 cup powdered sugar in the frosting and 3 1/2 tsp of milk, the rest of the frosting ingredients remained the same. With that being said, I loved these!! I split my dough in half and made 1/2 without nuts and 1/2 with nuts. I baked the ones without nuts for 14 minutes and they turned out very soft and pillowy. The half with nuts I baked for 16 minutes and they tasted just like a pumpkin cake only in mini size. This is a recipe I would definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!!
