Yum!  I've only found one restaurant in my life that serves what I consider "authentic" wisconsin cheese soup - this recipe came very, very close.  I substituted a bit (3/4 cup?) of the chicken broth with beer.  That made it almost indistinguishable from the restaurant one that I remember.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Were it not for the green pepper, I would have enjoyed this soup a lot more and rated it even higher.  I like green pepper, but it was too prominent in what is a mild-flavored soup.  I added 1/2 cup of Guiness Draught, but I don't think that necessarily made this any better - this soup would have been good with or without it.  For the record, Hubs disagreed with me on the green pepper thing, even suggesting it only added to the "Green and Gold." (okaaaay...)  To ensure the cheese doesn't curdle or separate, remove the soup from the heat before stirring it in, slowly and gradually.

This soup is so good!  The only thing that I did differently was to add bacon instead of ham and I also used a little bit more cheese! (I love cheese)  Our family makes soup every Sunday for a quick easy dinner.  This soup will definately be one of the recipies that we will use often!  Thank you!!

Must add a great beer (I used Honey Weiss) or pale ale to be a true Wisconsin cheese soup!!!! (substitute some of the chicken broth for the beer)  Also, because of a corn allergy in our family I used 1 medium mashed potato with potato water and flour to help thicken and left out the cornstarch.  I also substituted the milk for half and half.  Higher calorie count but richer and heavier flavor like a Cheesehead would want it!  Go Packers!

This was wonderful.  I put the veggies and ham through my food chopper so they were grated and blended very well.  I will make adjustments to flour and cornstarch next time as we like a thicker soup.  I also added about 4 oz of velveeta type cheese.  This is so good!  I think I will go make some more.

There is a restaurant near my house that serves a great Wisconsin cheese soup. My wife wants me to make one like it, this was not it. It was to bland for her and she loves bland food. There was not much of a cheese flavor. If I had the desire I think I could make this more to my taste, however, I think going with another recipe will be easier and ultimately better.

This is a decent starting point.  I would definately cook the veggies longer.  And I used extra paprika and wasn't afraid of some salt and pepper.  I also used 4 cups of cheese instead.

We all loved this soup.  The kids all rated it 5000 stars.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated, but was sure to chop everything very small, especially the green pepper so the kids wouldn't balk.

This was wonderful.....my family really thought it was great...even my 3 yr. old grandson who is a picky eater. I didn't put the mushrooms in and I substituted 1/2 cup of beer for 1/2 cup of the chicken broth. Otherwise I made it just like the recipe called for. This recipe is a keeper!!!!

I made this recipe for a family gathering and it was a total hit!  Everyone raved about how good it was.  I doubled the recipe, used extra cheese than what the recipe called for and used bacon instead of ham and it was fantastic.  Better than what you can get in a restaurant!

Soup had very nice flavor, but not a lot of body. We added some diced potatoes to make it heartier. Would be a nice soup for an appetizer or light meal though.

This was good. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used crushed red pepper and it had just enough heat. It had good flavor. Paired it with a sandwich. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I made this for the first time last night for my Bunco group, and it did not disappoint!  I even forgot to add the salt & pepper and people still raved over it. LOL.  I did substitute bacon for the ham but either way would have been wonderful.  The vegetables came out so tender and the soup was so creamy and not clumpy/gritty at all, thanks to the instruction on when to add the cheese!  Definitely a keeper!

I agree that this is like the original cheese soup that I have eaten in Wisconsin years ago, not like the thick soups served in restaurants.  This soup has a light cheesy excellent taste.  I have shared it with neighbors and all have raved about it.  I will certainly make it again.

I added extra veggies to compensate for the ham and peppers that I chose not to use.  Also had to cut way down on the cayenne pepper as it has a tendancy to be overpowering.  This is a delicious recipe!

I've made this several times and it is absolutely delicious.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms, so I left those out and substituted bacon for the ham (it's what I had in the house).  Served with beer bread.  I'll be making it again this weekend.

I love it so long as you follow the advise of Sarah McKeown Schafer. (Read the critique) I made it per the directions and it was gritty like a bad cannoli. I added a bit more hot sauce for a little more zing.

Very good soup. I substituted chopped red pepper for the green.  The recipe didn't state what size onion, I used a medium and thought that was too much, so will used less next time I make it. Also added a bit extra cheese for an extra cheesier flavor.

This soup was really good.  I used almost a half of a pound of ham, an extra half a cup of sharp cheddar and two ounces of another cheese.  The recipe as is didn't have as much of a cheesy flavor as some other Wisconsin Cheese Soup recipes I've tried in the past.  Overall, very nice.  I didn't give it a kid's rating because my little guy munched on the veggies, cheese and ham as I was making it and was too full for dinner.

I loved the recipe - it tasted great.  It took me a long time to chop up all the vegetables because I don't have a food processor.  That was the only drawback.  I would definitely make it again!
