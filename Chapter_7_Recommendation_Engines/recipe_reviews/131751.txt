I will start by saying that I do not like meatloaf.  I made this because my husband likes meatloaf and loves swiss cheese.  The only thing I changed was adding some zucchini, squash and carrots that I had run through the food processor.  I used the 7% fat ground beef and still had quite a bit of grease that I poured out of the pan, maybe from the cheese.  The meatloaf did not slice neatly and looked pretty unappetizing so I was prepared for us to look for an alternative dinner.  I was wrong, it was really good (and remember, I don't like meatloaf).  My husband took one bite and said, "This may be one of my favorite meals that you make."  Wow!!  I'll definitely make it again.

Delicious!  Will be making this again for sure.  I didn't have sage so I used some thyme and all purpose seasoning, turned out great.

I put a couple strips of bacon across the top of it and we all loved it. I could tell that this meatloaf would have tasted wonderful even without the bacon.

This was very good, next time I will make it with about a 1/2 cup of Swiss cheese and a different kind of cheese, the Swiss just had too strong of a flavor for me even though I usually love Swiss cheese!

How great is this meatloaf?!  Love the idea of Swiss cheese... in fact, just about ANY melted cheese topping on a meatloaf makes my mouth water.  A winner!

WOW!  This was awesome!  My husband (who is a meatloaf LOVER) raved about it while eating!  I did alter the recipe just a tad.  I didn't have any "buttery crackers", but I did have saltines.  So I crushed about 20 and melted a half stick of butter and mixed the two.  I also didn't have shredded swiss, but I had deli slices!  So in the meatloaf I used a parm/oreg cheese blend.  And on top I used sliced swiss to melt!  Also, I used thyme instead of sage and garlic powder instead of chopped garlic.  I also added some savory seasoning for added flavor!  All in all this was an excellent dinner!  Quick, Easy and GOOD!  Great recipe, thanks so much!

Just delicious!  Made it with half ground turkey and half ground beef - a bit healthier.

We really liked this-the addition of Swiss and sage gave this meatloaf a nice flavor.

It seemed a little dry and kind of came out like a brick.  The crackers didn't do much for flavour...I thought it would give the meatloaf a slight buttery taste, but they didn't.  I probably wouldn't make this again.

Yummy and it turned out perfectly, not too greasy or crumbly. I didn't have any buttery crackers or enough saltines, so I used about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 stick of butter. By far the simplest meatloaf I've made.

This was a great meatloaf. I added ketchup over the top and sliced some green bell peppers and laid them over the top also.

I love meatloaf and I am the only one in the family that eats it.  However, this was eaten with zest.  I did make a couple changes based on what I had.  I chopped onion and garlic together and added some fresh chopped basil to the mix.  I used turkey meat so added some wortshire sauce.  I also used panko because I didn't have crackers.  I love swiss cheese so this was a great meal for me.

I made this for my husband who is a huge meatloaf lover and he loved it, of course. But the reason this recipe gets 5 stars is because I loved it, and I normally hate meatloaf. Great, easy recipe!

Wonderful! I added tomato sauce on top at the end,baked 2-3 more minutes,then added the remaining shredded cheese (cheese blend, not just swiss). Net time, I will add a little water to the mixture before baking. Great flavor!

DELICIOUS! EASY! HAPPY DAY!
I followed the recipe but substituted chopped, fresh basil because I didn't have sage. Also, I used the whole amount of Swiss in the mixture. I covered the dish in foil and baked for 40 minutes. Then, I removed the foil, covered the meatloaf... almost to the top of the dish... with a half jar of "Pace, Organic Salsa with Tomatoes, Onions, Jalapenos and Garlic" (because I had it on hand) and added a few additional gratings of cheese. It came out moist and tasty! The salsa made a complementary, fresh and light  sauce with a kick of spiciness. P.S. I used 16 Keebler Club Crackers finely ground in my Chopper and 1.15 lbs 90% Ground Sirloin.

It was excellent!  I actually ended up using colbyjack cheese because thats all I had and it still turned out delicious.

This was very tasty!  I used swiss cheese instead.
