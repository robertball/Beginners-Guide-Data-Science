I didn't use parchment paper. I cleaned the glass turntable from my microwave, sprayed it with Pam layed my chips out then sprayed the tops of them. Cook as instructed. Everyone loves them. Also good with flavored popcorn salt. Ranch was a big hit.

These were wonderful!  I used a vegetable peeler in order to get potato chips which were literally paper thin-- it really improved their crunch!  I also tried sea salt, which was delicious.  However, when you make them, IGNORE the cooking time completely.  Stand there and just watch them.  When they are browned, crispy, and fragrant, they're done.  It took only 2 min. for mine to finish.

This recipe has to have 5 stars for keeping my husband entertained for a full hour! I printed off the recipe just to try and he saw it and just marched off to the kitchen. These came out quite well, but we ended up cooking them on a greased plate, not on parchment paper as the chips did stick a bit. 8 mins is far too long though, we were cooking ours for 4 and a half mins and they were very evenly browned.  This could take a bit long if you wanted say a packet worth of chips, so good thing we just ate them while the next batch was cooking! Thanks for a fun recipe.

FINALLY!! I make chips once in a while, but I have a little kitchen gadget for that. But I never know the exact time and method, I have to just try and see. It is also more time consuming. So, now I tried this method which proved to be the best. I just sliced the potato with my chips slicer, without peeling as in the picture. Sprayed my parchment paper with vegetable oil. Seasoned the chips. Placed the slices without overlaying or touching. Covered them with parchment. All they needed was about 4 minutes WHILE WATCHING THEM and checking on them every 1.5 minute or so. Once they are golden, that is it. They are healthy, delicious and quick, took 10 minutes from start to finish to make 2 small potatoes. I LOVE chips, but I try to avoid them since I like to keep fit and healthy. Now, I don't have to feel guilty. I am eating them while typing this review! YUMMY!
A quick update, I have made this recipe a number of times and became an expert so I took it to class and taught my students and they gave their parents the recipe and they are all making home-made chips guilt-free! THANK YOU!

This recipe is great.  We tried different ways to cook them, on a plate with pam sprayed on them, on a microwave bacon plate with EVOO on them and we also soaked them in vinegar then salted them.  Yummm.  Also did this with apple slices and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar so GOOD!!

Tastes like a baked potato chip.  Be sure to use a serated knife and cut as thin as possible, almost transparent.  Spray a plate with cooking spray and lay the chips hanging over the edge.  This will give them a curl; then spray the chips and salt if desired.  Cook for about 2 1/2 minutes and turn.  No need to spray again.  Continue cooking and turning every couple minutes until they appear done.  It's important that you cook them until they are crispy or they will not taste good.  This is very time consuming but delicious!

These turned out terribly- They stuck to the parchment paper and tasted aweful.
Id recommend to use a tsp of oil- but, that recipe already exhists so this one would be obsolete.
Well- No point really trying to make potato chips using this recipe, it doesnt work.

Finding myself with one, lonely potato, this provided our evening's recreation (we're easily amused).  We cooked these on parchment paper sprayed lightly with Pam.  Watch carefully so they don't burn. Once cooked, watch how quickly one lonely potato disappears.

This was ok....I think what bothered me was that I could not put large batches in the micowave. It took me like an hour to make this bc i had to oil the potatos and make sure the color was golden when it came out. It took about 7-9 minutes per batch.

My sister & i were searching on allrecipes for something to fix the kids we were babysitting for dinner. This is the perfect recipe. Even though it isn't meant to be a dinner recipe, it worked perfectly!!  It is really easy I made this recipe with the potatoes i had on hand, (which were red skin potatoes) and they were D-LICIOUS!!!  This is a make again recipe and i suggest that EVERYONE will at least try this recipe. You will definately want to make it again!!

I used PAM spray. Then tried Taco powder, Garlic Powder, Seasoned Salt (ugh). Next I'll try brushing on olive oil with spices already in it.

This recipe is so simple I thought the resulting chips couldn't possibly be good.  I was wrong!  They are really quite tasty.  Especially if you season according to what your craving of the moment happens to be.  Today, mine was kosher salt and cracked black pepper.  The only trick is to not nuke them too long at one time.  I did mine for 2 minutes to begin with followed by several 30 second intervals.  Then I just left them on the parchment paper until they were completely dried and cool.  Yum!  Even my tiny (read petite 22 year old health nut) daughter couldn't stop eating them!  Simply delightful.

This recipe intrigued me for awhile before trying it out and then I had to experiment on the exact thickness to set my mandoline to.  Also, as other people said, watched the timing to get them exactly done enough.  Tried it with sweet potatoes also, which came out pretty good.  Thanks to the reviewers that recommended spraying PAM on microwave tray and on top of potato slices before cooking.  This was a great addition to lunch as well as a snack if you're not in a hurry!~!!  Thanks for the post.

I have to give this a  cause it's so easy. It's my fault that my taters weren't in symmetrical shape. They did take a good 8 minutes in my nuker. I also used sea salt as someone else recommended. They are time consuming, though, cause you can only do so many at a time. But, you can't just have one!

These were fabulous, guilt-free chips!  I sprayed the oven's glass tray with Pam as suggested, and it worked beautifully!  This recipe is a keeper.

WE LOVE THESE!!  They are really excellent crunchy potato chips that we don't have to feel guilt about eating!  We used large, fresh russets sliced thin w/ a sharp knife.  We alternated the thickness just to see & like them thick & thin.   Sprayed a large microwave safe plate with Pam, layed out the chips & microwaved for 9 minutes.  They are crisp, brown & delicious.  Our 2nd batch we sprayed them w/ olive oil Pam & salted w/ Sea Salt.   The 3rd batch we used Barbeque seasoning.  ALL ARE A HIT AT OUR HOUSE!!  We were snowed in so this was fun entertainment too!

These worked very well for us. I used parchment that I lightly sprayed with cooking spray. The first batch I cut with a vegetable peeler, as suggested by another reviewer, sprinkled with sea salt, and they cooked very quickly. To save some effort, I made the second batch with the 2mm disc of my food processor. They took several minutes longer to cook, but were just as tasty. Also, I did not have to re-spray the paper and I used it several times. I think a mandoline that can slice as thin as the vegetable peeler would be ideal for prepping. Great recipe!

Lotta work for a few chips that really aren't as good as commercially produced chips unless you get your cooking method perfectly dialed.  Gotta be SUPER attentive to the process.  If you let them cook even five or ten seconds too long, they're shot.  Not worth the effort.

These were so good!!!  I did not use any parchment paper and I cooked mine about 5 minutes.  They were fabulous!!  Next time I make them I will try them with Grippo Seasoning (if you know what that is you are probably from The South and are so lucky).

These were pretty good. I didn't have parchment paper and had to use wax paper. I didn't know how this would turn out so I stayed there the whole time it cooked. It was ok but some of them stuck to the paper and after 5 minutes they started turning dark brown. I'll try it again but use other reviews and spray a plate or the turn table itself.

I've used this recipe a dozen times now and my son loves these healthier potato chips as much as the ones that come in a bag from the store.  I use Russets most of the time and they still turn out browned and crispy and delicious, although I think the Yukon Golds have a little more flavor.  Great recipe!

These were simple and came out crispy. It took 7 min in my microwave and some of them came out burnt while the rest weren't even brown. They did get crisp though. I sprayed them with non stick spray before cooking. I sprinkled these with homemade Nascar seasoning and my husband raved over these. 1 potato made enough for 2 of us.

So good and so easy!
I used some cooking spray on the parchment paper since the potatoes stuck to the paper the first time I tried this recipe.
You can reuse the paper as well.

I can't imagine these working for anyone.  I tried these and the potatoes got brown before they could get crispy.  Very unappetizing. Some of the chips started sticking to the parchment paper. I followed the directions.  Too much trouble for the terrible end results. I will stick with Lay's fat free store bought chips. Thanks anyway. :(

These are FABULOUS! Leave skins on Russets. Tried yams but didn't like them much. They're worth the effort. Mine took about 4 min. per batch. Served for company, all ages, and they loved 'em.

Tried this today on a whim with both potatoes and taro.  Turned out really good although I did not leave them in nearly as long (4 mins was perfect).  Tried one batch as directed and one with cooking spray...liked the cooking spray the best but both good. Thanks as taro chips can be as much as $10 for a 6 oz bag here in Maui!

Why haven't I ever heard of this method of making chips?  I just tried it, and they are easy and yummy!  We all love potato chips at our house but try not to have them too often due to the fat content, but this recipe is a game changer!  Can't wait for the kids to get home from school to try them.
I used my mandolin, sprayed my parchment with olive oil, sprinkled some sea salt and seasoning on and within a few minutes had delicious healthy potato chips.  I am soaking some potato slices in vinegar now to try making salt and vinegar chips (my kids' favorite)!

I used regular Idaho potatoes and sea salt.  I followed the suggestions of spraying my large microwave turn table with cooking spray (I used canola) first and using the vegetable/potato peeler to get really thin slices.  I can't believe how crispy and delicious these came out.  You should've seen my husband's face when he tried one.  He went in and grabbed the peeler to make another batch right away.

I love making home made potato chips, but my previous recipe was such a hassle (either baking and burning, or microwaving on a plate and taking ten minutes a batch...) 
BUT THIS WORKED FANTASTICALLY! Uber easy, and I had batches done in 3ish min. I brushed my sheets with olive oil inbetween batches, and it worked perfectly! This is the way I'll be doing these from now on!

I made sweet potato ones and they are fantastic! Sweet and salty. Yum! :) I used Becel spray and sea salt to keep them from sticking to the plate. I find that they crisp up a bit after you take them out. I guess they keep cooking a smidge after you take them out. Even the softer ones crisped up after a minute or two.

I read all the reviews and used the tips and the potato chips turned out very nice. They tasted just like store bought, and the low price of just having to buy a potato is definitely a bonus. Make sure to use a GREASED plate. These are great for experimenting with, and they are very easy. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!

We love the idea of this, then when tasting them it was all good. How would have though healthy chips. Yummy! I made 3 different batches. I followed the recipe for the 1st one, the 2nd I used popcorn seasoning and 3rd.  I used garlic salt to taste. They didn't take 8 minutes. I started watching them about 4 minutes. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Aweful experience trying this recipe.  Nowhere near potato chips, more like hash browns AND GREASY!  Could not get them right even after 10 minutes of microwaving, tried 3 min got Mush, 5 minutes, still mush.  I do not recommend this recipe at all.

Huh. I had rather low expectations that these would actually taste like chips. What a nice surprise :) I'm thrilled you shared this with us. Thank you! I used my vegetable peeler to get very thinly shaved slices and cooked about 4 min.

I followed other suggestions and simply placed them on the turntable plate.  Tasty and fun to make.  To make a huge amount would be time consuming but I've actually found that for a personal snack one medium potato (I like gold ones) will take 2 microwave sessions to cook and is only a few minutes.

These are the best right out of the microwave!! I didn't cut my paper thin so it took longer to "cook". Used Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. A great snack for low cost!

Finally I can make a chip that my husband can eat. He has end stage kidney failure and can only have potatoes that have been soaked in water all day, and then cooked. (soaking lowers the potassium)
This is a healthy recipe for any one.

Really good! I'm trying to live and eat healthier and this was just the thing I needed for my salty/crunchy craving I just had. Literally eating them as I type. Hope to try different seasonings in the future too. I read that soaking them in vinegar and then sprinkling them with sea salt is amazing. I did as others had suggested and used a plate sprayed with cooking spray.They browned up in about 4 1/2 minutes in my microwave. I didn't have a potato peeler or mandolin as others suggested using. So I used a sharp kitchen knife and cut my potatoes as thin as I could. Still came out great!

Fantastic!  I did not use parchment paper. I used a paper towel.  This is perfect for anyone who loves potato chips but not all of the fat.  I sprayed lightly with Pam and salt and pepper, Microwaved for 4 minutes, turned them over and cooked for about 1 minute more.

Absolutely fantastic! Only complaint is I can't make them fast enough! I think the cooking time definitely depends on the thickness (and of course your microwave). We did a thin batch and then later a thick batch and both were equally yummy!!! I too greased the plate due to no parchment paper.

I tried this recipe with yams/sweet potato with mixed results. I seasoned with garlic powder, salt, pepper and used pam on my microwave plate as suggestd. I burned quite a few, but they do serve as a fairly good sturdy chip-like, healthy alternative. Thanks for suggesting. I will continue to experiment with taste and crispiness.

I have to give this 5 stars for the simplicity and then you can complicate it if you want.  I didn't want to downgrade to 4 stars because of what I thought this needed. I complicated it by A.  Washing starch off prior in strainer; I think potato chip making usually demands this  B.  Dehydrating in oven on wire rack @ 170 degrees for maybe 20 minutes and C.  Spraying small amount of oil on.  Not a major difference in outcome between air fryer and microwave.

Decided a spur of the moment to try & only had russets on hand, no Yukon Gold. Hubby made them & for our microwave for some reason it took 10 min. He forgot to spray the parchment paper before putting in microwave like others suggested. Sea salt is much better & will continue using that. Overall will make again for a quick snack or to go with burgers, pulled pork or sandwiches. You don't have to worry about the grease because there isn't any. I think the best part of these is not peeling the potatoes because all the vitamins are there.

So easy to make and so good! I agree with the other ladies, watch the time.. it took 11 min for mine to get crispy.. then again I didn't cut them so thin.. also I didn't use parchment paper, just the microwave plate and sprayed it with Pam.

This is a good recipe, but you need to be extremely watchful with the time. I agree with another poster who mentioned 2 minutes and a half. I tried this twice and that is the exact time it took me to avoid getting scorched results. I however will try them in the oven. I am not a fan of the microwave plus having to be this watchful is just not my cup of tea.Again, this recipe is not bad all you need is to get a knack of  the cooking time given the particular level of energy of your microwave.

Wasn't sure what to expect, but gotta say, it was pretty darn good. A couple of tips that may be helpful to others.....my microwave is 1100 watts (high onthe power end of things). Went for 6 minutes on first batch. Too long. Second batch at 5:15. Just right. The parchment paper (used Reynolds) worked great. Did not stick as others indicated. Both the top and bottom layers of the paper seemed to absorb moisture as the chips cooked. I salted the potatoes on the paper prior to cooking and cooled the cooked chips on the paper for about 2 minutes. Last tip. The top layer of paper was subject to the fan blowing in the microwave. Sprayed a light layer of cooking spray on top layer and lightly pressed onto potatoes. Worked well.

Am a WW member and always looking for low/no fat healthy recipes. This one fit the bill!!
Those who didn't like this recipe may not have had the proper tools. One key is I have a veggie slicer that makes the potato slices very thin. Microwave wattage could be a problem for others, as 8 minutes was a bit too long for me. Since I only made one batch, I am planning on doing more and using spray oil prior to salting.

Love this recipe!  Helps keep me from going overboard eating too many chips.  When the craving strikes I can slice one potato, season & enjoy.  Once gone I cannot keep reaching my hand into a bag for more.  Have experimented with spices with good results.

I made it exactly as written with minor exception of using Pam with olive oil.  I had to cut my parchment paper to fit the microwave turntable.  I started watching them at 5 minutes, and added 30-45 seconds each time I looked at them until done.  Most yummy!

These Microwave Potato Chips are so easy to make, crispy, fat free and delicious!   What more could you want!  I used Yukon Gold Potatoes, and cut them very thinly on my mandoline.  I then soak the chips in ice water to remove the starch for about 30 minutes, drained them, and then placed them on a clean kitchen towel covered with some paper towels to totally dry.   I then took two  precut round parchment papers to cook the potatoes in the microwave.  I sprayed one paper on one side with Pam, placed a few potatoes on top, and then placed the second parchment paper, sprayed side down on top of the potatoes.   I cooked them for approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds  to start.  I added additional minutes because they weren't cook or crispy enough, and then I proceeded with the remaining potatoes.  The only problem I had, was eating them as I pulled them out of the Microwave.   So addicting!!

Ive made these before with a gadget that slices the potatoes and a rack to have them sit upright in the microwave.

They turned out great!

I substituted with large Idaho potatoes for even larger chips and they turned out great. Didn't use any salt to make them even healthier.

These were great!!  As suggested by other reviewers, I used a mandolin slicer, which definitely helped to get the thin slice needed.  I also sprayed my turntable plate and the tops of the sliced potatoes with cooking spray and sprinkled a little bit of sea salt on them.  To get the desired brown and crispness, it took 6 minutes in my microwave.  My husband and kids gobbled them up as they came out!  I will definitely make these again.

I have been making these for about a year. I don't know if I would have made the 2nd batch if I didn't have a V-slicer (easier to spell then mandolin). I slice them into water to wash off the starch and keep them from turning brown. I was making them on corelle ware plates sprayed with pam .... but DUH, I keep my carousel clean so I am just going to spray it and cook... You can overlap a little they just stick together a little... no biggy. Thank you CVSWOMAN!!
MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL!!!

These tasted good for being very simple - the only problem we had was how few we could make at a time and how fast they were being eaten.  I don't know if they would taste very good once they have gone 'cold' ... so while this could come in handy - I don't know if we would make these on any kind of regular basis.

Just got done trying this recipe. Pretty good.  I used the Pam on the plate then potatoe slices then sprayed Pam over potatoes.  I put the cooked chips in a quart freezer bag and tossed with spices.  I used some cheesoning w/a little sea salt,garlic powder. I'm making more right now.  I think I'm going through the pantry imaging what flavors I'm trying next, because the possibilities are endless.  I also dropped my time to 4min and still turn out. I got about 6 dinner plates out of 1potatoe. I also used 2plates to speed up bathes and cool plates

to say the very least this was an interesting experience.. unfortunately i had the same problem of the potatoes sticking to the parchment paper as some of the others.. i even oiled it a bit.. think i'll stick to regular potato chips or if i want to be healthy i'll buy the baked ones.. i'm gna partially blame my microwave.. the thing is cheap and old.. bf said maybe i didn't slice them thin enough.. but that was the thinnest setting on my mandolin slicer

These were great. I used a microwave bacon plate as another reviewer suggested. It took about 5 minutes in my microwave. Everyone asked for more!

This recipe turned out well. Like other reviewers, I recommend just watching and not really timing it. Red potatoes work as well as gold.

Great and super easy recipe to make potato chips. I spray my plate with Pam, lay the potato slices then brush on olive oil and sprinkled some sea salt. First microwaved for 2 minutes but potato still very soft, microwaved another minute then flip them over and take another 1 minute. Turns out very crispy and taste just like store bought potato chips but healthier! I also tried sprinkle some popcorn cheese powder and they tasted great!

these are easy and very good.  I followed the directions exactly.  They took about 10 minutes in my microwave (sliced paper thin).  I had no problems with them sticking. Great guilt free, healthy snack. Thanks for sharing!
