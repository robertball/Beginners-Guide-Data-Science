Updated review:  I made this recipe again tonight.  This time I used a combination of crushed corn flakes and italian bread crumbs.  I again used munster cheese instead of swiss.  I decided to try the gravy and it was good, but I don't think it's necessary as the chicken tastes great alone.

Original review: My husband says this is the best new recipe that I've ever made, and he's hard to please.  

I did things slightly different for personal preferences.  First of all, I used Italian bread crumbs instead of Corn Flake crumbs because that's all I had in the house.  I used munster cheese instead of swiss becuase neither of us like Swiss.  And I didn't make the gravy, because my husband isn't a gravy person.  

These were so simple to make, took little time and turned out wonderfully.  The first time I made this it came out too dry, so I adjusted my cooking temperature the next time to 350, for 30 minutes, and it worked fine.  I will definately make this again!

Really great!... liked the creamy sauce.  Used mozzarella cheese instead of swiss.  The cheese will run out if you don't tack up the sides of the chicken breast.  One thing that helps is if you fold the ham around the cheese, and then wrap the ham/cheese square in the chicken.  Less cheese oozes out!  

Will definately make again!

Delicious! I used bread crumbs to coat the chicken and then sauteed in a pan with a little butter and olive oil. Once browned, I made the sauce, adding my usual seasonings and some white wine. I then poured the sauce over the chicken to heat through. Thank you Michelle!

Every time I make this my family loves it.  I melt the butter in the 13x9 pan in the micro and then roll the chicken in it and then roll it in bread crumbs and return it to the pan.  Very easy.  I use whatever kind of cheese I have on hand in the fridge.  Be sure to put a little water in the bottom of the pan so they don't stick.  Also, the sauce it the best!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I dipped the chicken breasts in a beaten egg, then rolled in seasoned bread crumbs and drizzled melted butter over them.  We didn't like the sauce at all and felt the chicken was delicious without it.  I also made two of the rolls with Swiss cheese and two with Provolone, and my husband and I liked the Provolone better (our son preferred the Swiss).  I'll be making this recipe this weekend when my daughter's fiance and his parents come for dinner.

Thanks for this recipe!  It gives a twist to chicken hardly any effort.  I've made it twice now.  Neither time did I bread it or make the sauce, actually.  After rolling the chicken up, I sprinkled paprika on the top, surrounded it with wedges of butter, and let it bake.  The second time I made it, I was running low on time, so I pan seered some seasoning into the chicken first, and then rolled it all up and let bake for 25 minutes.  The nice thing about not breading the chicken is that I didn't need toothpicks, so no worries of the little sticks breaking in the food.  When first seering the chicken, it made for less flexible meat to roll-up, but it worked anyway and my guests loved it!

This recipe is easy and it tastes great. I tried it for new years and it came out delicious. The sauce was incredible too. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and will probably cook more often than just special occasions. Thanks for sharing. =)

Wow... Yummy. I actually used sliced turkey bacon instead of ham and sharp cheddar cheese. Italian bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese gave the chicken rolls an extra kick. Only cooked for 35 min. Oh... The chicken taste great without the sauce

this is the best.. thank you for sharing.  a great simple recipe with tremendous flavor.  A pleaser for all. I tweaked the recipe a little, but it does not matter, it always will come out fantastic. use any cheese, just use toothpicks to keep it in the chicken, and the sauce is great, i used low sodium cream soup I have used onion, chicken, mushroom), and low fat sour cream.  great lite sauce. (the flavor stays the same)  
I made so many, I rolled about 15 extra in tin foil and froze them.  (preheat oven to 350 and cook for 35 minutes from frozen) did not use toothpicks when rolling in tin foil, while cooking, make sauce and rice or noodles.. FAN TAS TIC.

Followed someone else's suggestion and mixed some Italian bread crumbs in with the corn flakes.  Also added a couple of huge dollops of dijon mustard on the chicken (I love that flavor in this dish). Also followed whoever's absolutely brilliant suggestion of wrapping the cheese in the ham first, then rolling it in the chicken to prevent less cheese loss.  And added another teaspoon or so of lemon juice to the sauce.  This is SO GOOD!!!!

Easy to make - tasted great.  I used mozzerella instead of swiss because we don't care for swiss cheese.  I like the use of the cornflake crumbs which stayed crispy instead of getting soggy.  I made the sauce, but most of the family just ate the chicken plain, so I probably wouldn't make that part again.  Overall, a great meal.

OK. Made this last night with a few changes and it ws simply the best Cordon Bleu I have ever had! I took salad croutons and crushed them since they are already seasoned it was perfect. Rolled them in it and browned them in just a pad of butter. The sauce I did the same except I deglazed the pan with some white wine. Outstanding!! I will servethis for a dinner party cut into circles with sauce dizzled over. If I could give this a 10 I would!

My one suggestion is to use dry spaghetti instead of toothpicks. They cook right along with the roll and you don't have to go looking for toothpicks to remove.

They were tasty, but had a hard time getting the cheese to stay inside (even though I rolled the ends under as well)

Made this for a dinner party and it was a hit.  I especially loved the sauce.  I didn't have any cornflakes cereal so I used regular bread crumbs.  I served it with mashed potatoes and corn.  Was not difficult to assemble, but looks like it was when served.  Crowd will think you are an aweome cook!

This was excellent. However, I didn't have regular cooked ham---it was honey baked, and ah no, SO I used canadian bacon(YUM!) Couldn't find my thyme, SO I used Italian Seasoning blend(Excellent) and I used 1/2 cup of butter and double coated. Worked great for me. Plus here a tip learned from working in a meat market, when you pound out your chicken and layer your meat and cheese, then roll the chicken up, you don't have to put a tooth pick in it to secure it, so long as you squeeze it closed, lay the chicken on the seam on a cookie sheet pan, place in the freezer for 20-30 minutes prior to breading, your chicken will remain closed during the coating and baking process, yes some cheese escapes but not much, it's still very cheesy in middle, and this recipe was quite nice. I did use the sauce after I plated dinner and over steamed red potatoes...which was an excellent idea, I might add. My husband raved and raved about the chicken all evening. And the kids all gave me kisses to tell me it was delicious. So I'm thinking I won't change anything I did any different. It pleased my family.

I haven't tried different recipes with Cordon Bleu yet, but this was delicious. For the breading I added about half a cup of bread crumbs to the corn flakes, and also added Thyme and about a teaspoon of Emeril's essence for an extra kick. I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream in the sauce, and added some milk and water because it thickened up pretty fast. This is very easy and a great option if you are feeding a lot of people. Thanks!

Just made this tonight.  It was very good. But should the ham and cheese be a little thicker? The sauce was good for dipping the chicken, not for covering the chicken.  Will make again.

I have to say using the thyme made the chicken have excellent flavor, and all in all this was an ok dish. I found it extremely hard to pound out chicken breasts that thin, and then rolling everything up to be even more of a challenge. Even after using toothpicks to secure the sides and hold everything together, the presentation was pretty awful, and the insides still oozed out. I used provolone cheese(do not like swiss) and only italian bread crumbs and butter for the coating (which turned out very soggy and mushy-even after the recipe took 20 minutes longer than stated in the directions) I thought it would be sort of crispy. The over all flavor of the chicken and ingredients was pretty good, but the time consuming prep and ugly presentation is a deal breaker for me. =(

I had this growing up and it's been a while since I ate this tasty dish. I made this tonight and it was just juicy and tender and even better than I remember it. I used an egg to dip the chicken in and bread it with italian bread crumbs. I baked it at 400 degrees (gas oven) for 30 minutes. The chicken was releasing its juices and it held the hamd and swiss cheese. What was the star of this dish was the sauce! I read what other reviewers said about the sauce so I tried it. This sauce was soo awesome, creamy, tasty and complimented the chicken well. I served this over hot white rice. Yummo!

Made this for dinner last night. Was very good, although I didn't make the sauce. Didn't think it needed it. Thanks

Excellent! I tried this last Sat. for our X-mas dinner with friends. Everyone was so impressed.
It tastes good. I will make this again as I have a lot of ham and swiss cheese
left over. It's very easy to make too.

With a little altering, these came out wonderful and were delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and spread a little mayonnaise on the breasts before inserting the ham and cheese "fingers" and rolling them up, securing them with some wooden toothpicks that had been soaked in water for a bit.  I also used panko bread crumbs seasoned with a little of Emeril's BAM, parley flakes, salt and pepper because I didn't have any cornflakes.  The sauce was a nice complement to the chicken.  I did, however, need to thin it a bit with water to get it to the preferred consistency.  I served this with mushroom wild rice and baby Brussels sprouts in a butter sauce.  Definitely an elegant and memorable meal.  I'll be making this one again.

I followed the recipe to a T and it was very good. I used as many toothpicks as needed to hold the breasts together and keep the cheese from overly oozing out during baking. Don't be afraid to use alot. When the breasts are cooked simply remove all of them before serving.  
One important note:  Do season the raw chicken breasts with some extra salt and black pepper because overall the chicken itself tasted under-seasoned. The only thing carrying the flavor was the cheese and the ham. Other than that, the recipe is a good one and a keeper.

This was excellant! The only thing I didn't like was the size of the chicken breasts (which weren't mentioned) and the size of the ham slices (not mentioned either).  I also subsituted homemade bread crumbs (America's Test Kitchen recipe) for the cornflakes.  It was very gook and my picky eater ate two of them!  We will have this again, for sure!

I loved everything about this!  But most of all I loved the simplicity.  I really enjoyed the hollandaise type sauce--so easy to prepare and tasty too.  Perfect weeknight meal for my busy family.  A great, kid-friendly dinner :)

I'm not much of a cook, but this is the best dish i have made so far. Even with messing up the cornflakes(i measured them as whole instead of crumbs)

This was really very good.  I pounded the first breast too hard, and it broke apart.  After that, I used considerably less force, and took my time, and they flattened pretty well.  I would also reccomend using panko, it really crisped up nicely.  They were easy, and very impressive to serve!

So good!  I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of the cornflakes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  They cooked in about 25 minutes.  The sauce was super easy, and although it's not as good as a cordon bleu sauce made with heavy cream, it's an excellent lower-fat alternative if you use low-fat soup and sour cream. The sauce isn't great by itself but goes well on the chicken. Of course part of what made this so good was undoubtedly dipping the chicken rolls in the melted butter before the crumbs!  Very easy and delicious, will make again.

So I made the actual chicken cordon bleu my way, (filleted but not the whole way through chicken breast with deli meat and panko crumbs) but i wanted to comment on the sauce. It's an interesting taste I will say. I added some white cooking wine to it because it was really thick and some other spices. By itself i really didn't like it but I tried it with the chicken and was surprised how good it came together! I don't think the chicken NEEDS it, but I had all the ingredients and wanted to try it and was pretty pleased.

Made just as directed for my son's in-laws and friends.  Got RAVES for it! Did follow another's suggestion and set oven temp at 350 instead of 400.  It did take a little longer that way but finished product was done and juicy enough to not use gravy - which would be a mistake!  Thank you Michelle for a great and simple recipe.

There were only two of us eating it and it was still all gone in under 24 hours. We LOVED it. The sauce was a nice touch, but certainly not necessary. I also used bread crumbs instead of the cereal because I had them on hand. It had my roommates wishing they knew how to cook =]

This recipe was awesome :)  We used to get those prepackaged stuffed chicken things but this was so much better!  Take caution with the sauce though, I thought it was pretty gross...the chicken is better off on its own!

Yummy.
I didn't have Swiss Cheese, so used Provalone instead.  Also didn't have cornflakes, so just used dried bread crumbs and added a bit of Parmesan cheese to them, also added thyme and garlic powder to the crumbs.
I'd read other comments about the sauce not having enough flavour, so I added Onion powder, thyme, pepper and garlic powder.
The overall result was terrific.

Chicken cordon bleu is one of my favorite dishes.  I've never tried to cook it until tonight.  It turned out so delicious.  I used provolone cheese in three of them and seaside cheddar in one. Instead of cornflakes, I used garlic and herb breadcrumbs.  That added a really nice flavor. I also used applewood smoked ham.  I made the sauce and added milk to it.  The sauce was ok but I'll probably skip it next time or find another for it.

This is such a simple, VERY delicious way to make cordon bleu. The most time consuming part was pounding the chicken! The sauce really makes a difference to. If you haven't tried this recipe yet, I suggest you use the sauce. (Also, I used store-bought breadcrumbs because I was in a time crunch, and everyone loved it.)

I would like to give this recipe 5 stars but didn't because the cooking time was a little too long...30 minutes should have done the trick.This seemed intimidating but it was very easy to prepare although I did make some slight changes. I dipped the rolled chicken/ham/cheese in an egg wash and then into a bread crumb mixture of bread crumbs (of course), garlic powder and seasoned salt, placed into a casserole dish and dotted with butter.  Bake 30 minutes in a 400 degree oven. Make the sauce! I added 1/2 cup of white cooking wine to the sauce and it was delicious! I served with steamed broccoli and some pasta(which goes great with the sauce!) Easy and impressive dinner.

Thanks for the recipe! Really good and easy. I baked for 35 minutes at 350 and it came out perfect!

My family just loved this recipe!  I added a little garlic powder, white pepper, and a couple of sprinkles of cayenne pepper and smoked paprika to the cornflake mixture.  For the sauce I also added a little white wine to thin it out a bit.  It was really, really good...no leftovers, the kids went back for seconds!

This was really easy and tasted great.  I did't have cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom which worked well.  I will make this again!

Fabulous, absolutely fabulous!! Everyone in my family loved this! I used cheap deli ham and that worked out just fine:) This does not have to be an expensive meal! I loved the corn flakes idea, how wonderful! I cut out the thyme and added parsley. I omitted the salt because the ham was salty enough. I used egg whites instead of butter. The meal tastes great without the sauce:) Serve with butter potatoes and veggies. Yum, enjoy;)

This was easy to make, and handled substitutions well.  I used a provalone rather than swiss, my 9-year-old liked it a lot, as did my husband.  The sauce was better if doctored up with a little white wine and a little drop of lemon juice to cut the "cream soup" flavor...  Will make this again and again, I'm sure...

Great recipe Michelle! I used Kassari cheese because I had no swiss (Kassari has more flavor). My family loves savory dishes like this. I, too, used white wine and a bit of sherry in the sauce. Thanks so much for sharing.

We loved this recipe.  My husband loves chicken cordon bleu and would eat it every day if I let him.  He claims this is the best he has ever had, and I've been trying different recipes for years!!  I didn't make the sauce, so I can't comment on that, but the chicken was great!  I made half of them with swiss cheese, and half with mozzarella (because I hate swiss) and both turned out wonderful!!  We'll definitely have this again!!

This was my first attempt at making Chicken Cordon Bleu because I had always been intimidated by the recipe.  But this one was easy and I actually took it the very first time I made it to a Sorority Potluck and everyone loved it.  I made extra for my husband and daughter and they loved it--the sauce was very good (and easy).

Loved it!!!!!!!!! I dipped my chicken in butter then in the bread crumbs. Then I poured the remaining butter over the chicken, it wasn't dry at all. Even my kids loved it.

Really Good, Easy and Simple! I added Italian Bread crumbs on the ham to add a little extra crunch and it turned out terrific! The sauce was simple, and amazing!

This was amazing! I used Panko Bread crumbs and I also used some mayo to help hold the cheese and ham inside the chicken. This was my first stab at making Chicken Cordon Bleu from scratch and I was not disappointed! I did not make the sauce, however, because we tend to be a non-sauce family. Thank you!

Great recipe except this sauce.  You can't make such a great dish and then top it off with canned soup!  It is like putting ketchup on a porterhouse steak.   Impossible to get away from cream soup glob and sour cream.  Search another recipe for a better sauce.  One that at least you can pour.   Basic cordon bleu is good.

An Instant favorite! I went with thin cut chicken breast instead of pounding them, and American cheese because it was on hand. I could take or leave the sauce, but the chicken really didn't need it anyway. It was fantastic on it's own. I may make some modifications to the sauce or scrap it entirely. This is going in my book. Thanks so much for such a great dinner.

My husband just told me that dinner was scrumptious.  I think it was a first.  I was out of some of the ingredients so I used rosemary instead of thyme, plain potato chips instead of corn flakes, and velveeta instead of swiss.  Don't pass this one up!

This was delicious. Only change I made was that I used italian bread crumbs instead of cereal for the coating. Be sure to seal the ends really tight so the cheese doesnt leak out.

Good recipe, but I cooked it about 10 minutes less than called for.  The sauce wasn't bad once I added 1/2 of white wine to it.  It wasn't the gourmet type sauce you would get in a restaurant, but it was VERY easy.

THIS RECIPE WAS OKAY. I USED SHAKE AND BAKE BREADING INSTEAD OF THE CORNFLAKES. AS USUAL WITH A RECIPE LIKE THIS THE CHEESE CAME OUT OF THE CHICKEN. WOULD BE BETTER JUST TO MELT IT ON TOP THE LAST FEW MINUTES. I WILL PROBABLY MAKE THIS AGAIN SINCE THE OVERALL TASTE WAS GOOD. I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE SAUCE OVER THE CHICKEN. IT WAS OKAY MIXED WITH PASTA.

We liked this recipe and sauce well, but for some reason, (maybe I pounded it too flat) the chicken was a little dry.  Not sure how I can help that except to adjust the cooking time.  It's one to definitely do again.

Prefer to have a sauce that is not made from canned soup.  Suggest applying seasoning directly to chicken breast and not ham and cheese so as to not have all spice clumped in the middle.

Make this tonight.  I already have the chicken ready to go, just wondering- I don't have any cream of chicken on hand, only cream of mushroom & celery.  Does anyone know if I could still make the sauce with either of those soups?  Or should I just forget about the sauce?

This is a really good recipe. We liked the sauce. I served it with asparagus and red potatoes and the sauce went great on the asparagus! It wasn't bad on the potatoes either. By reading the other reviews, some saying it was dry. I cooked mine at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and it was done!

This was very good - i used chicken cutlets and pancko bread crumbs so it was pretty easy too.  Next time I would skip the sauce since the bf didn't care for it and i thought it was just okay.  Thanks for the recipe!  We've added this to the cookbook.

This as good start! Everyone cleaned their plates at my house. I didn't have thyme so I left it out, I coated the chicken rolls in egg and used bread crumbs instead of cereal crumbs. I will definitely make this again!

Except for the pounding out the chicken breasts, this was surprisingly simple.  After rolling up the chicken, I browned seam-side down without toothpicks.  I didn't really bread, just sprinkled some Panko crumbs over rolls then baked for 30 minutes at 350°F to reach 165° interior temperature.  Made the sauce as directed and it was all delicious.  Thanks for a very nice recipe.

This was fabulous!!!  I made a few changes like using Monterey Jack instead of Swiss (I don't care for Swiss), dried basil instead of thyme (and added a bit of garlic and onion powder and coated the chicken with crushed Ritz cracker crumbs.  I also sprinked on a bit of mozarella over them during the last 5 min of cooking time.  Wonderful!!!  Very nice presentation as well.  My family loved it and it would easy be good enough for a dinner party as well.

Nice, quick, semi-fancy dinner.  I pounded out my chicken, but not quite thin enough.  Used Virginia ham from my local deli and some swiss.  Instead of rolling the bundles in the breadcrumbs, I brushed melted butter on top and sprinkled them with bread crumbs.  I also thinned down the sauce with milk.  Very good dish.

I liked this recipe w/a few modifications of my own.  Instead of thyme I made use of oregano and paprika, seared the ham with chunks of bacon in garlic oil, used french bread mixed w/light parmesan for the breading and substituted lemon extract for the lemonjuice and topped it with lemon zest and peppercorn.  375 degrees for 35 min seemed to work really well also.  Love the recipe, thanks again.

I changed it and liked my version better. I spread each chicken breast, after pounding with brown mustard. After rolling, I used the butter-flour-egg-crumbs method to bread them and I used Panko bread crumbs. Delicious. Even my father, the extreme picky eater, liked them!

Amazing! I've made this for a dinner party and they loved it! I skip the sauce, and use bread crumbs seasoned with thyme, oregano, basil, garlic salt and Parmesan cheese instead of the cereal. Absolutely perfect, every time (and I make it often :D )

This is such an awesome dish.  Although I have never tried the sauce for it (always missing one ingredient or another!) I would like to one of these days.  I didn't change a thing on this recipe other than omitting the sauce.
***Update: have since tried the sauce and it was also a huge hit.  Followed this recipe to a T.

Yum!  My husband can ALWAYS find something he doesn't like about something I make.  The only thing he said about this one was "Mmmm, this is really good...The sauce is great!"  I just about fell over!  :)  The kids loved it too!  Woo hoo, a keeper!!!

This was great!  I didn't have a tenderizer and forgot to buy plastic wrap, so I used a wood cutting board, a 1 gallon ziploc bag and an old small kettle.  Worked great!  I butterflied the breast which took less time to flatten but cause holes.  I had minced 2 garlic cloves, putting a pinch in each roll-up and the remainder over the rolls in the pan.  I also used seasoned bread crums for the outside, but next time I'm going to try chicken Shake 'N Bake.  Woohoo, this was great!  Oh, and also added parsley, thyme and pepper to the sauce. Thanks!

The sauce puts this over the top. I also mixed some parm cheese in with the bread crumbs, since there is no such thing as too much cheese in my house!! 
Tossed about a Tablespoon of butter in the bottom of the pan, to keep things from burning.

Just made this and we both loved it! So good, and it seemed so much easier than the chicken cordon bleu my mom used to make. (Don't tell my mom, but it was every bit as good as hers, if not better!) Really easy, tasty dinner I know I'll be making again soon.

My husband requested this for dinner and I begrudgingly agreed. That was before I knew both how easy they would be to make and how absolutely delicious they would be! Even my Mother-in-law, who made a surprise visit, commented on how impressed she was...who can ask for better than that?!

Delicious!  Made this for my family & brother and his girlfriend.  Everyone was impressed!  The only thing I would change is the cook time.  Check doneness at 30 minutes.  I cooked for about 38 minutes at 375 and it was too dry.  But the flavor was great!  I made it with Garlic Red Potatoes recipe from this site and steamed broccoli.  I will for sure make this again....it looks gourmet and is very easy!

Easy to prepare, the sauce was very good but this was my second time making this and the temperature needs to go down on this or it will dry out, which was what happened on both occasions. Because I dont like tasting wood.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  The only thing I changed was 1) I didn't need toothpicks and 2) I added 1/2 cup milk to the sauce.  I might experiment a little with different spices, like garlic powder sprinkled with the cornflakes.  Thanks for the post!

I've made this a couple of times now and it's very good.  My suggestion is to add some garlic and dry sherry to the sauce mixture for flavor.  Use fresh lemon juice if you've got it.  Also, I added a bit of lowfat milk to the sauce as it was cooking.  I thought it was a bit thick and needed to be thinned a little.  I substituted muenster cheese for the swiss.  Yummy!  The leftovers were good too!

This was absolutely heavenly!  I modified as follows: I used provolone cheese instead of swiss, and flavored with sundried-tomato, basil, and garlic.  I also surrounded the chicken rolls with red pepper strips and onions and basted with a little margarine.  Fabulous!!

I was amazed at how easy this was.  I rolled the chicken in butter and then italian breadcrumbs.  Also, I did not have any swiss cheese so I used Monterey Jack and it came out wonderful.  I will make it again soon.

I was really surprised that those three ingredients made a gravy taste. Very neat. 
However, the recipe was quite time consuming so I probably wont make it very often. But, it tasted really great!

This was really good. Even my husband that's not big on cordon bleu enjoyed it. I will definitely make again but being a HUGE cheese fans, I will add double the cheese next time.

Very easy and very delicious. I added a little shredded swiss cheese to the sauce and it went perfectly with both the chicken and over pasta and broccoli for sides. I will definitely make this again!

I made these for Easter dinner withouth the sauce and I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes.  They were delicious!  This was my first attempt at something like this and it made me look like I knew what I was doing!  The recipe was easy to follow and the chicken looked so fancy, my family seemed impressed.  Thanks for helping me jazz up Easter :)

Good.  I used smoked turkey as I don't eat pork.   Breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes simply because that is what I had on hand. Also had to improvise on the cream of chicken soup since where I live you can't find cans of soup at all. I used homemade chicken stock, cornstarch for thickening and then added the sour cream and lemon.   It went over well even with a 2 1/2 year old!

1st I have to say: I am a vegetarian & don't cook meat much & of course don't know how this really tasted...that being said, my husband LOVED it & said I could definitely make it next time we have company over. I don't cook chicken all that much & when I do it's usually easy chicken wings/drum sticks, so I was worried, however this recipe was really easy. I didn't have a meat mallet so I used my rolling pin! Also, now thinking back, it might have been easier to put the breast in a ziplock bag, instead of the saran wrap as it was sliding just a little bit. Anyway the whole thing was great. I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and lime juice instead of lemon, both because that's all I had in the house. Good recipe! I definitely recommend it!

The chicken was good using the panko crumbs, but this sauce is terrible. Condensed soup + sour cream = nasty!

Easy, very good.  I poured the sauce over the top of the chicken and returned it to the oven for about 5 minutes before serving.  This seemed to work well.

This recipe was a hit in my house!  I used provolone cheese, and crushed Crispix, b/c that's what I had on hand, but I don't think either substitute changed the final product much.  I will definitely be making this again!

We REALLY enjoyed this recipe.  I rolled them and secured them with toothpicks while dipping and coating, but removed the toothpicks prior to baking and it worked out fine.  I think the sauce was okay, next time I might look for another recipe, but it was quick and I appreciated that.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My entire family really enjoyed this recipe. My husband is not a big fan of chicken and he told me to definately make this again. I actually tried using the bread crumbs like alot of people recommended but I think next time I make this recipe I'll use the corn flakes. It would give it a much crispier crust. My husband usually won't eat sauce or gravies with his meals but he actually loved it. I found the sauce to be a little bland and to thick so I add a little onion powder and garlic powder and some milk to thin out the sauce slightly.

LOVED IT!  I am going to make this for company.  One roll is a perfect serving.  I have three kids who don't eat meat so I just put swiss in the center and made sure I folded in the edges and rolled.  I think these were every bit as good as the ones I put ham in.  I also seasoned the cornflake crumbs with seasoned salt.  DELICIOUS!

Although this dish is a bit more time consuming than others, it turned out great.  I used swiss cheese, however I will try provolone next time.  The chicken was very tender and a hit among the fam.

Best Chicken Cordon Bleu I've ever made! The only thing I did different was use bread crumbs instead of cereal.. and seasoned w/ garlic powder and parm cheese. For the sauce I added 2 table spoons of mustard to give it a kick!  It was GREAT.

This was fantastic!!!!  I made it for my Mom and Dad for dinner and they couldn't stop giving me compliments.  This is a keeper recipe and the sauce is out of the world. I dipped the chicken rolls in melted butter and then in bread crumbs and baked at 350 for 45 minutes, turned out great.  I'm so glad I made this tonight, it was such a success!!

Family loved it! The kids were arguing who gets to pound the chicken next time.  We didn't have cornflakes, but used breadcrumbs.  It was delicious and has already been requested for another dinner soon!

I have never made homemade Cordon Bleu before and it was a great learning experience! I made it for my dinner and my boyfriend and I invited his parents over, it was the first time I cooked for them and they thought I was a chef...in reality I can barely cook and I am a police officer....Thanks for posting this recipe!!

great recipe for company.  I didn't have corn flakes so I used Italian bread crumbs.  The chicken rolls made a big hit.

My family loved this. I made some changes, I used frosted flakes instead of plain corn flakes. It made it so yummy! It may sound weird but it is very tasty with the swiss cheese and ham. You can also use turkey ham instead of ham if you dont eat pork. One more change I used was I added garlic salt on the chicken before I pounded it. You may want to use a ziplock bag for the chicken before you pounded it, makes clean up easlier.

These were great - my picky daughter loved them. However, like another of the raters, we thought the gravy mixture wasn't enhancing or necessary. Next time - I won't even bother making it.  I also used bread crumbs instead of cornflakes and found it was excellent this way!

Great recipe, made some changes as suggested by others, used mozzarella, Italian bread crumbs, baked at 350 for 35 minutes, came out perfect first time, sauce is also very good, adds a nice tangy flavor and helps with moisture, although moisture wasn't a problem, chicken was juicy.

Thought this recipe was very tasty.  I used Breadcrumbs and Eggs, instead of butter and cornflakes.  I liked the sauce.  Big hit at my house.

THis was a really good meal. I did change a couple of things. I did make the sauce. It was good. It was a little too thick so I added some milk. I used more than a teaspoon of lemon juice. I just squeezed half a lemon in there. THe chicken was a pain to roll in the corn flakes, it made a mess and they didnt stay on too well while cooking, but it was worth it. The extra bit of crunch really worked well. Some have complained about the chicken being dry. Some peices of mine were too but those were the ones that didnt have sauce on them. I recommend making the sauce.

Very good recipe. I did change it a little bit. I used my own bread crumbs and I seasoned the chicken to my taste (I used thin fillets). I didn't want the rolls to dry out during baking so I baked them for about 30 min at 350 degrees and then broil them on Hi for about 2 min on each side just to brown the breading. It turned out PERFECT!! I will definitely make it again!

What a crowd pleaser!  It tasted wonderful and looked great on a plate.  I used a maple ham and lorraine swiss and the flavors worked perfectly together.  I was a little hesitant about the sauce, but it was wonderful - everyone was impressed, especially when they found out that my three-year-old helped me prepare it!

This recipe was fabulous! And easy too. I did modify the cooking time to 30 minutes at 350 degrees as other reviews suggested, and coated the chicken with a mixture of balsamic vinegar, champagne vinegar and oil rather than butter prior to coating it with a combination of bread crumbs and crushed cornflakes. And last, I used  Italian seasoning and garlic for flavour. I did not care for the sauce recipe.

These were wonderful!  My whole family loved them including my 8 year old and 18 month old.  They presented very well and would look lovely for company as well. I did decrease the cooking time to 35 minutes and cooked it at 350 degrees as other reviews suggested.

This was a great recipe, very easy to put together.  I did use provolone cheese instead of swiss and it was very good.  Also, I used seasoned bread crumbs for the breading.  Next time I may not use the butter and try milk or egg instead, to reduce calories.  Definitely will make again.

We loved this recipe.  I was out of ham, so I used thin canadian bacon instead.  Also, I left the cheese and canadian bacon slices whole and put them directly on the chicken before rolling.  I didn't have corn flakes, and used total flakes instead.  Also, I was out of sour cream, but had some sour cream onion dip made up.  I added that to the soup and it was delicious.  This recipe is obviously very adaptable, and the flavor and texture were excellent.

Even I was impressed with me when I made this one!  Considering how relatively easy it was, the presentation and taste were GREAT.  I used provolone, just because that's what I had.  And adding a little lemon juice to the sauce did help cut the "cream" taste.  Overall - YUMMY!!!

This was G R E A T !!  How gormet?  The only thing I changed was rollin the chicken in bread crumbs instead of cereal.  The sauce (i was a little skittish because i don't care for the cream of ___ soups) was excellent!!  This is my fiance's favorite meal :)

I used a little more cheese than called for and  rolled them in eggs and bread crumbs (instead of butter and cornflakes).  My husband and I really liked the sauce, and it is especially good on fresh steamed asparagus.  I didn't even think to add white wine, but I definitely will next time.

Made this today, and it turned out great. I substituted fresh thyme and rosemary for the dried thyme. A little more work to chop it, but worth it. Mixed the rosemary thyme mix into panko (as a substitute for corn flakes). Also used Haverty cheese instead of Swiss. Give it a try.

Delicious I used Shake and Bake for the coating which kept it very moist. Had to substitute the lemon juice for 1 teaspoon vinegar which worked out and was delicious.

I really liked this recipe. I changed a few little things. First I was making this for two people, so I only useed two chicken breasts. I make my own bread and used my own breadcrumbs. I used a different cheese. To make the sauce I used some cream of mushroom soup, only because I didn't have cream of chicken and it came out great! Also I used the juices from the chicken breast for the sauce.  Very good!

My tweaks:   I replaced the melted butter with an egg wash and replaced the cornflakes with panko breadcrumbs.  I mixed the thyme with the breadcrumbs.  Since I only had chicken tenderloin pieces, I flattened them slightly and layered the ham and cheese between two tenderloins rather than rolling.  The chicken was DELICIOUS!   But I didn't care for the sauce -- as written, it's so thick that it's more of a "topping".  I had to add much more than a tsp of lemon juice, and some white wine, to thin it out.  Even then, not so great, though my husband and kids did like it.   I served this chicken with mashed potatoes and a veg combo of corn/asparagus/carrots.

My first time EVER having this dish (how can you go wrong w/ chicken, ham, cheese and bread crumbs??) This did not disappoint me at all. I followed directions, and took advice from other reviews... I added onion powder, garlic powder, a little salt and pepper to my raw chicken before rolling. I used swiss AND a provolone/mozz blend cheese. Rolled in Italian pankos (OMG so yummy!) I also substituted the ham with turkey ham since we don't eat pork in my household. Served it over white rice cooked w/ chicken stock, red roasted potatoes and fresh cut green beans. The Cordon Bleu sauce was DELISH (added a little white cooking wine.)I had to make another batch of the sauce because my family put it on everything LOL. I will be adding this to my recipe box for keeps. Thanks for posting!

I made this for my husband and he absolutely LOVED this dish! Only change I made was using seasoned breadcrumb vs. cornflakes but still he loved it! He did suggest I add one more slice of cheese, but he's a cheese man. Overall this recipe was wonderful! I loved how simple it was!

This recipe is a keeper!  My husband and I loved it.  Next time I will just pour butter over chicken rolls in baking dish, then sprinkle with italian bread crumbs (used instead of corn flakes).

Excellent!  Watch the amount of lemon used in the sauce and don't be tempted to add to more cheese than specified.  This is a wonderful and fairly easy recipe.

This was great!!!  I didn't have corn flakes, I'll try that next time. I spread pre-made pesto sauce on chicken before I put in the ham & cheese---turned out great. You really don't taste the pesto sauce just gives it lillte bit of a different taste.

This was really good. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars because it is almost perfect. The only problems I found with it was (1) like many people said, it doesn't hold well together (when you try cutting it) and (2) the flavor might be kind of strong for some people (I love the strong flavor though)

Awesome recipe! I had never made Chicken Cordon Bleu before, but this seemed like I could do it, so I gave it a try. Glad I did! My fiance LOVED it and so did I. :] I opted not to use the sauce and it still turned out great! Also, like many of you, I used bread crumbs in substitute of the cereal. I highly recommend you try this one out!

I was terrified of making these, for fear they'd turn out "hideous".  Surprisingly easier than expected, and wonderfully delicious.  I used shredded swiss (all I had on hand).  Egg held the breadcrumbs on perfectly.  (Plain crumbs seasoned with garlic, sage, basil).  Husband gave his five star approval, as did his insanely picky brother.  Sauce is fantastic with some white wine added in.

I have been making this for years and the only thing I do different is I add fresh sliced tomato and a sprinkle of sage on top of the cheese, I also wrap the ham up around the cheese to keep it inside the chicken like other reviewers. 
Gravy was a nice addition, Thanks

Great and easy!  I used half corn flakes and the other half French's Fried Onions, turned out great!  I used deli ham and deli swiss cheese to make it easy. The sauce was delish too! Dinner was awesome!  Thanks for submitting!!

This recipe is wonderful.  I have to admit that if you do not use the sauce that is suggested in the recipe, the chicken is missing something.  It also can get dry without it also.  My husband thinks that I have slaved over this recipe and that he is eating something "too good to be healthy!"  I think it is a great recipe!  I do, however, care for it best without the spices added.  GREAT recipe!

This was such a quick & simple dish, but oh so wonderful! I lowered the oven temp to 375 as well adjusted the cooking time to 33 minutes. The chicken came out very moist. The sauce was a perfect match.

This was terrific!  The sauce was awesome too, much lower in calories than a typical cordon bleu sauce.  I didn't use butter, but olive oil instead, to cut out somemore of the calories, and didn't have cornflakes, so used breadcrumbs.  I'll say that the sauce was phenomenal.  Thanks for the recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe with some minor alterations to the spices: used Herbs de Provence (ooh la la) instead of thyme inside the rolls and added some Paprika to the coating for a little color and spice.  Baked at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  Didn't use the cream sauce this time, but will try it next time.  Good recipe!

What a great recipe!  I changed it just a bit to suit my taste:  I didn't have cornflakes on hand, so I used regular bread crumbs.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  The sauce to go over this is wonderful, and I added the drippings from cooking the chicken.  It got rave reviews all around.  I would definately make again and again!

Great dish!!  I made it for a Sunday dinner and it was fabulous!!  I did do a few different things, first, instead of dipping the chicken in the butter, I dipped it in basil, and balsalmic salad dressing  and then into the crushed corn flakes, and I dotted the chicken with butter, and I didn't make the sauce, we found it didn't need the sauce.  It turned out very moist and delicious!  My husband and son raved about it.  Will definately make this again!  Thanks!

This is delicious. Pounding the meat very thin helps it cook properly and makes rolling it up easier. I had honey corn flakes on hand and didn't care much for them, especially with the sauce. Next time I will use egg in place of the butter to keep the coating on better, and either plain cornflakes or butter cracker rounds. Update: After making this recipe a few more times, I decided that although it has great flavor, it is a tedious recipe.  I do not make this version of cordon bleu, BUT I still use the sauce!  GOOD sauce.

It was very good, but I should have used thinner sliced chicken breasts so that the chicken could roll better.  I had to use toothpicks to keep it all together.

Not exactly the easiest thing I've ever attempted, but the end result was really good.  My boyfriend thought they were the best.  Also, I used provolone as he's not overly keen on swiss cheese.

This was great!! My husband doesn't like swiss cheese, so I substituted provolone, and don't feel like I lost anything.  It tasted great, and the rolls are easy to heat up as leftovers!

Dinner was great.  I altered the recipe slightly and used Panko and regular breadcrumbs.  I also brushed egg on the chicken (for coating rather than dipping in butter)and sprinkled the breadcrumbs over the top.

Really good recipe. I followed some other reviewers and uses Italian bread crumbs and egg, then drizzled the butter over top.  My husband and son both said it was very good(unusual with new recipes).
I am going to have to learn to pound the chicken a little better, it was kinda hard for me to roll everything up. Other than maybe a little more cheese I wouldn't change a thing.  I did not make the sauce.

My family LOVED this dish.  It is easy to make, and was something new and different.  I don't have a meat mallet so I had to beat the chicken with my fists haha, but it worked just fine.  Definitely recommene this to anyone!

Very good recipe. I only made a few changes, but the heart of the dish remained true to Michelle's original:
1) used Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs instead of cereal flakes
2) placed rolled chicken in an *un*greased dish, drizzled half the butter on top, sprinkled crumbs over, flipped and repeated. I mixed the extra breadcrumbs with the rest of the butter, and spread around chicken rolls, then baked. (makes a nice stuffing-like addition once baked)
3) Sauce was a bit too thick, so I used half-and-half instead of sour cream (which was great later on baked potatoes)

Good work!

This is very good!!  A little messy and involved to make, but well worth the effort.  The 2 year old turned up her nose though... wouldn't even taste it (she's not much of a meat-eater though)

Delicious recipe, few changes.  Cook at 350 for 30 mins. Add a little bit of honey Dijon mustard to the sauce and a splash of milk to thin this.

Turned out good. I didn't pound the chicken thin enough. Since I don't like swiss cheese I used a mixer of cheeses and that's not a good idea. I also cooked in a tube solar oven and that made it turn out very moist and flavorful.

Taste is excellent.  Have made it a number of times, but do not know how to prevent the cheese from oozing out and keep the meat from opening/unrolling. Tried just about everything, including toothpicks.

I loved this chicken. Reminded me of Sizzlers Malibu chicken. I used thighs cause that’s what I had. I made the chicken rolls and then realized I forgot the Swiss cheese. I payed the cheese on top of the chicken roll and topped the cheese with panko. Turned out great! I did make a nice dipping sauce of mayo and mustard which was the perfect touch.

Just finished and incorporated some of you suggestions. My batch was coated in crushed cheese-it’s and chicken in the biscuit crackers since I didn’t have a flake cereal that wasn’t sweetened. I’ll update soon.

My mom used to make a very similar recipe when I was a kid.  Based on what I remember from my mom’s old recipe I made the following changes:  Needs more liquid in gravy like milk or water.  Also easy on thyme or eliminate completely. Add paprika. Use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss. Italian bread crumbs instead of corn flakes. Double the gravy recipe. Add extra sour cream. I also recommend pouring the gravy over the chicken and sticking it back in the oven for another 20 minuets. Goes great with rice.

We enjoyed this recipe although we substituted panko bread crumbs for the cornflakes. That' s what we had in the pantry. The sauce is very good as well. We pounded the chicken but would have done so more to make it thinner. All in all, we liked it and would make it again, with the panko as we always have those on hand.

Review Edit: amazing 

Just popped in the oven I'm using different parts from this recipe and another recipe and creating a whole new way to make this I used mozzarella and swiss cheese alternating in the pocket and also on top of the bread crumbs will add pictures when done

So good! Took the suggestion of another reviewer and added some Italian bread crumbs to the crushed corn flakes. Also I used sliced deli mozzarella cheese, just as a personal preference. My husband and kids loved it! The sauce was a little thick to me, so I thinned it with chicken broth. I would do that again.

This will be one that I make again and again!   I call it "my take on a Cordon Bleu" because I made a few alterations to the recipe.  I didn't have ham, so I used cooked bacon instead.   And not being a family that enjoys Swiss, we opted to use garlic and herb jack cheese.   Wonderful flavor combination.   I thought the sauce was good, but a little unneeded.   My husband liked the sauce but did not care for the lemon in the sauce.   I think next time, a nice county pepper gravy would be better.   Both my 4 year old and my 18 month old daughters ate everything on their plate, which is always a bonus in my book.   YAY TO THE YUMMINESS!!!!

I made this recipe as is, with the sauce, and really enjoyed it. Good, easy, basic recipe - and easy to expand on.
The second time, I herbed the breasts with sea salt, pepper, parsley, thyme and sage, doubled the cheese, and cooked on 375 for 40 minutes.  I also used seasoned planko crumbs in place of the cereal. I also added some white wine to the sauce mixture.  Both ways were great, I just like a little more seasoning. My hubby loved both!
Thanks for the recipe

This is amazing!!! My fiancé gets super excited every time I make it. The only thing different I do is instead of corn flakes I use crispy shake n bake. He asks for it over and over.

The roll itself was good.  However, the sauce was not -  no flavor other than sour cream and much too thick.   I watered it down some but never could get a creamy smooth sauce.

This was well-liked tonight. I followed most of the recipe but I made the cream of chicken soup from scratch (low-sod chix broth, milk, flour, seasonings) and I used mozzarella (twice as much) instead. 

I also added a half-sized recipe of "Kickin' Collard Greens" by Ken Adams here on allrecipes (minus the red pepper flakes, and I didn't cut the leaves down). About 30 min into the collards cooking, I pulled the leaves out and added them to the ham and cheese before rolling into the chicken.
Then I added the drippings from the collards recipe into the gravy - bacon, onion, garlic, and chicken broth - excellent! Was a great dinner with a side of squash. Going to follow it up with blueberry zucchini cake with lemon butter cream frosting!

made this, but cut the recipe in half as there were only two of us. Loved it, did not change a thing in this recipe. Am planning on making it again this week. It is definitely on my keeper list. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us,

I made this 3 times already. My three children love it. And that's hard one being 5, autistic with texture and color issues, and another 2 1/2, picky and following her big brothers lead, and the youngest is 15 months. Now all that being said... For those who have slight issues with the cheese oozing out during cooking try getting a slice of Ham cutting it long ways in a strip long enough to fit your finger of cheese in and curl over the long ends and wrapping the cheese jelly roll style as usual... Creating a neat little packet so the cheese stays in place, And not all over your pan. It's a slightly bit more ham and a little bit more work but worth the flavor and look of your creation. Once again thank you for this beautiful and delicious recipe. It has made a wonderful addition to the scrapbook/recipe book I am making for my daughter as she grows up.

I used what I had on hand - american cheese and mozzarella cheese (some with one, some with the other) , Special K for the cereal,  and cream of asparagus soup instead of cream of chicken.  It was a hit!  My daughter didn't care for the sauce but the rest of us loved it.  I may add a little spiced bread crumbs or just some herbs to the coating to add some more flavor.  And I should've read previous reviews because the cheese ran out the sides on me .  Now I know for next time - and there will definitely be a next time!

400 degrees for 45 min. Use 1/4-1/3 cup of breadcrumbs and same amount of crushed cereal Honey Bunches of Oats. Use 1-2 tbsp of melted butter with a little egg whites. Add to bottom of red pan about 1/3 cup of white wine mixed with a little chicken bouillon. Add salt, pepper, and thyme to chicken.

I kicked up the sauce by adding garlic salt and pepper, and thinned it out with a little half and half- it turned out very smooth and flavorful. I didn't have thyme, so I substituted sage and it tasted great. Should have flattened out the chicken a little more, or bought bigger chicken breasts because it was tricky to get the parcel completely sealed.

My kids love this recipe! I slice the chicken in half - like I'm fileting it. That way I  start with a thinner piece and then I pound it as flat as I need too. After stuffing it, I also roll it in egg whites and then a combination of panko bread crumbs, basil and Parmesan cheese and spray with Pam before baking, which gives it a nice crunch. No need for toothpicks, as they burn and are a pain to remove. I cook at 425 for around 30 minutes - really tasty! The sauce is amazing :)

I made this dish, but will definitely eliminate the addition of the canned soup. It totally ruined the dish and not only smothers the wonderful flavors, the added unnecessary calories.

It was great, I baked it for 50 min and instead of Swiss cheese I used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar. I also ended up mixing mayonnaise and Parmesan into the butter for the crust, and finishing it off with bread crumbs.

I am new to cooking and i thought this recipe was easy to follow and easy to make.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of swiss and italian bread crumbs instead of cornflakes (didnt have the cornflakes on hand). My husband does not like cordon bleu chicken but I tried it anyway with success.  He actually loved it and said he would definitely eat it again. Thank you for this great recipe and making me look like an amazing cook ;)

What a wonderful change to boring chicken.  The only changes I made was to add crushed potato chips to the corn flakes (my mommas recipe)and replaced the lemon juice with 1/8 c. of Moscato and 1/8 cup of water.  I will definitely keep using this one.

This recipe got mixed reviews at the Christmas dinner and majority did not care for it. Definitely not my favourite. The cooking time was to long and it was just bland. Adding the gravy to it helped it but still not a recipe I will make again.

Love, love, love this recipe! It was quick, easy, and delicious!  I used "thinly sliced" chicken breasts so I could skip the pounding step.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of corn flakes.  To make the sauce healthier, I used plain, nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream and fat free cream of chicken soup. This one's a keeper!

Really good. I used mostly italian breadcrumbs and a little corn flakes to give it a little crunch: Perfect combo! (a ratio of about 3:1) Great flavor, thanks.

This was really yummy. I used panko instead of cereal crumbs and it turned out great!

I loved the recipe and I will make this one again. I did add to much lemon juice to the sauce but still loved the chicken.

Family thought it was great.  We changed the recipe a bit.....we used 2 strips of partially cooked bacon instead of using ham. As we knew the bacon would have a lot of salt we used no salt during the wrapping. This was a good call.

We found that pounding the chicken down was best accomplished in a Ziplock gallon bag.

We used about 2 cups cornflakes instead of the listed amount (1/2 cup).

Sauce was good.

Yummm I used rosemary in place of thyme with lemon pepper and garlic powder as a rub on the inside of the breast before rolling...also added lemon pepper and extra fresh lemon juice to sauce gave it a little extra zip.  Dipped in 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter and used 1?2 of each italian bread crumbs and the corn flakes, turned out nice.. My hunny loved it!!!

A nice basic cordon bleu recipe with the addition of thyme.  I don't have a meat mallet, so I sliced the chicken breast in half, and re-pinned it together using toothpicks....  unfortunately, that takes away from the presentation.  I also used japanese breadcrumbs (panko) which added a nice crunchy texture...  served without the sauce and with a green salad ..... perfect!!!

I have made it several times now. It's great. 
I varied the recipe and put some prosciutto in with the ham. I put 2 pieces per roll. That was fine. On one I put 4. Too much. It overwhelmed the cheese and ham after baked. Even my friend's kids ate it and came back for seconds.

What a great recipe! It was very good and easy to make. The only thing I did wrong was leave them in the oven a little too long. I used smoked ham and it infused the chicken and cheese with such a great flavor.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I don't  think that I made the chicken thin enough, but it was definitely done in 40 minutes.  I used provolone because that is what I had.  Also, I used breadcrumbs as well.  Turned out pretty well, but I am hesitant to say that it is "the best".

Delicious and easy recipe.  I followed the advice of others and used bread crumbs instead.  I also used string cheese.  I found the gravy to be a little thick so I added about 1/4 cup of milk to it.  Maybe next time I will try white wine.

I'm 26, and all my roommates moved out so I am getting my cooking skills together. This recipe was sooooo good. I used bread crumbs vs. the cereal and the sauce was eh...but it came out sooo well!! I actually used thin sliced purdue chicken and it was perfect no hammering needed! Plus there were small enough that they would be perfect for a appetizer or tapas! (Great for parties) Thanks!

this recipe is awesome. i almost didn't go through with it for dinner tonight, i'm pleased i did. i used provolone instead of swiss, because that's what i had on hand. i used chicken breasts with rib meat, removed from the bone. i saved the bones and cooked with chicken bouillion cube and water. since i was also out of chicken soup, i thickened the resulting broth with flour, then pulled the chicken that remained and chopped and added to sauce. i followed the rest of the sauce recipe. you must make the sauce. it's so good. i wrapped the cheese as well as possible inside the ham. i rolled in bread crumbs, since i didn't have cornflakes. i just finished cleaning the kitchen. my husband and i agree, it's the best cordon bleu we have ever had. our twins also liked it. thank you!

Very good recipe, I wouldn't substitute the corn flake crumb for bread crumb, personal opinion. I added poultry seasoning to the bread crumb mixture. I also added white wine to the sauce. However, you really don't need the sauce. The chicken is juicy, moist, and flavorful enough without it. I served this dish w/ red potatoes and sugar snap peas. Oh, almost forgot to mention, my boys do not like Swiss so I substituted  provolon and munster. I'll definitly make this again, think I might try Black Forest ham next time.

I used to make this for my for friends in college and got rave reviews every single time.  I'm a fan of using ingredients on hand so while I didn't follow the recipe exactly the results were the same.  This is really great to serve if you are having a few people over (too many and the recipe could get a little time consuming).  I tried to the sauce once and didn't particularly care for it so I haven't made it since, but overall a very good recipe.

The taste was wonderful.  I gave it a four because it is kind of a pain to roll the chicken.  Next time I will just butterfly the chicken and put the Ham/Swiss in and then coat it with the Butter and Corn flakes.  The sauce was great.

Absolutely amazing!!!  I used Cheddar cheese and a peice of sliced American. So so so so good. i would leave the thyme out next time though. I also sprinkled with bread crumbs in addition to the corn flakes just because they were sitting there. Can't wait to have again. mmmmmm

I liked the recipe, but I learned to use smaller breast pieces next time. All I tasted was chicken. I enjoyed the ease of the sauce, but it was not the tipical cordon bleu sauce. Thank you for the recipe.

This was okay.  I liked it but my family thought the swiss cheese was overpowering.  I will most likely make this again except change the cheese to something else.

I loved this recipe after I made a few small changes! Try cutting the chicken breast open and placing the fillig in the center then closing it again instead of rolling it. I replaced the bacon with smoked turkey and the thyme with a 1/4 tsp. oregano. I also substituted half of the butter with garlic butter. It was really great!

I used this sauce with another recipe.  Also good with cheddar cheese soup.

This was ok.  My boyfriend just loved it, but I didn't think it could come close to the stuffed chicken recipe he had made me 3 weeks ago (see "Bob's Mexican Stuffed Chicken" recipe, also on this site). That's a hard dish to top.

The chicken recipe was pretty good...not excellent you understand.  But still...tasty.  The sauce was kind of lame.  Too thick.  Needed garlic or something of that nature.

this is yummy but i found it a bit difficult to get my chicken rolls to stay rolled.  i had to use a bunch of toothpicks.  i think i should have pounded the meat a bit flatter.  i will be making this again.  thanks for sharing.

This was the first time I made homemade chicken cordon bleu, usually relied on the frozen variety and I must say this was excellent!  I will never use the frozen variety again.  The corn flakes added alot of crunch and the sauce was so easy to make yet so tasty!

Pretty good, I used bread crumbs instead of cornflakes, which turned out well.  I think more swiss cheese should be used, and the sauce turns out a little bit thick, but it was a crowd pleaser for the most part.

This is a great recipe---the one thing that I changed was using honey flavored corn flakes rather than the plain corn flakes.  It adds a touch more flavor.  But besides that, it is a great meal and I always get lots of compliments.

wonderful!!  the only thing i would suggest would be, becare how much thyme you sprinkle on the cheese & ham.  a little goes a long way.  my husband loved it as well as myself!  i would definately make this meal if having company for dinner!!

Have made this only once so far.  Not all ingredients and time are always available in your cupboard.  But take the time to make as its delicious.
