I thought this was pretty tasty. I added a chopped onion, and used garlic powder in place of garlic salt. It came together relatively quickly, and made for a nice dinner. I tasted the sauce after it reduced and felt that it needed a bit of herbage. So I added some dried basil and oregano--that really helped. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts, even though the recipe didn't specify whether to use bone in or not. They took about 25 minutes to cook through, and were definitely still juicy in that amount of time! They're really great with a sprinkling of romano cheese on top too! Thanks for the recipe! Edit: I also did not use the full amount of olive oil called for. Just enough to cover the bottom of the saucepans.
