This recipe is very like the one my mom made for us when we were kids. It's important to put the sauce in the bottom of the pan 1st - as indicated in the recipe, otherwise you may get sticking/burning problems. Many of the other recipes do not call for it, but it's an important step. I forgot to put the eggs in this time, but I will next time for sure. Maybe I'll add some mushrooms, too. I used fresh-grated pecorino cheese on top, as it was all I had on hand, and it still came out very well. Thanks for posting a great recipe!

Ya know what this needs to make it 5 stars?...Italian Sausage! Substituting half of the ground beef with Italian Sausage would put this ziti over the top.  Also, make sure you use a good tomato sauce. If I absolutely have to use the kind from a jar, I will season it up with sauteed onions, garlic and some Italian seasoning.

This recipe was quick, easy and turned out well for us. I only used one pound of ground beef, which I sauteed with a 10 oz. pckg. of mushrooms and a clove of minced garlic. Added some dried basil, salt & pepper to the cheese mixture and used Trader Joe's Rustico Sauce. I think the ratio of meat to cheese was perfect this way, and if I ever decided to use the full two pounds of ground beef, I would make sure to have more sauce on hand. Thanks, Elaine.

Amazing recipe! My fiance asks me to make this all the time. The cook time is perfect for the 6 settings and everything! I didn't change it at all other than adding Italian Seasoning to the meat/sauce mixure! My first meal when we moved in - PERFECT & EASY

Fantastic recipe!  My family loves it.  I used Italian sausage instead of beef and added some provolone cheese to the top.

I am a family of 6 so I doubled this recipe. The BEST Baked Ziti recipe out there. Easy to prepare and very yummy. I have even used ground turkey and ground venison with no problems.

Very easy- just like lasagna but without all the time-consuming layers!  I made this with 8 oz. of my own meat sauce (Bolognese Sauce from this site) plus a 28 oz. jar of sauce.  It was the right consistency- not too saucy.  Made this for a dinner with friends and everyone loved it and had 2nd helpings!

I made this as written, only adding Italian seasoning to the meat. It was simple, quick prep, and DELICIOUS. My 1 year old and 4 year old gobbled it up. The leftovers were good too. I think next time I will make double the recipe and freeze one for an easy "throw it in the oven" work-night meal. This one is going in my rotation.

This was good, and i only made a few changes. I used 1lb of ground beef and added a little more parmesan (we love cheese). The store was out of ziti so i used rigatoni. I think i will add some italian sausage next time i make it.

Next time I am adding seasoning to the ground beef along with garlic and then this will be awesome. I did all of the prep work while my 1 year old was napping, had it ready for the oven for later. Wasn't sure if I needed to add more cook time after having it in the fridge. I think I did because after letting it sit for 15 minutes I needed to microwave my dish. Any how, I would make this again. My husband and father enjoyed their meals.

This was truly epic! I went "whole hog", using nothing low-fat. We rarely eat like this, so it was OK. Whole-milk riccota and mozzerella! YUM! Used penne pasta. Cut down on the meat a bit, used 1# GB and @ 1/2# Ital. Saus. Sauteed some onions, baby bella mushrooms and maybe 3 crushed cloves of garlic with meat. To use no garlic in this dish would have been a sin . Like someone else said, used Newman's Sockerooni, too, but it's only 24 oz, so I added a can of Ro-Tel 'maters with chilis (with the juice), like another someone said. Also put under the broiler for a minute to give it a touch of color, and served with garlic bread. Worked to perfection. This was almost like lasagna. You could add a green salad, if you feel the need for it. This has earned "keeper status" in our kitchen, will be passed on to the twins so they can entertain a crowd on Superbowl Sunday! ;)

This recipe came out perfectly!  I was preparing everything and had to go somewhere.  So, I assembled it and put it in the refrigerator. I popped it in the oven when I got home.  It turned out great.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was good, but I made it vegetarian by omitting the sausage, and that made it kind of bland. I would add some italian spices if I made it again.

The only change I made was add a little red pepper flakes for spice. Also, I mixed everything together instead of layering! YUM!

Fast and easy, I have made this one several times over the years, I like to add basil, and sometimes I uses Italian sausage because that is what I have on hand. But in all reality you don't need to change a thing. Kids will love it!

This was my first time making baked ziti and it turned out great thanks to this recipe! I used a 13.25 box of penne rigate whole wheat pasta, used about 36 oz. of pasta sauce (and spooned a bit more onto the top to fill it in), and added chopped onion and garlic to the pan before browning the meat. It was very good and I will definitely be making this again. The only thing I would do differently next time is salt and pepper the meat while browning. Great recipe!

This recipe was easy and tasted wonderful. It wasn't too dry,saucy or cheesy with just the right proportions of ingredients. The recipe says it makes 6 servings but there was plenty left over( I have a family of 4) to freeze and save for an on the go weeknight. I didn't have any freshly grated Parmesan so I used the the kind that you shake out of the plastic container and it still turned out great.  Even my picky 8 year old went back for seconds. That makes it a huge hit in my book! I will absolutely make this again.

A simple recipe with great taste.  I used ground turkey instead and was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly.  To be more healthy I think you could definitely sneak in some veggies.

Easy and delicious. I actually forgot to put the parm in with the noodle mix and it still turned out great. I did have to add a bit more sauce. I actually used this to make food from my cousin after she had a baby. Instead of baking in a 9x13, I baked in 3 of those 2 lb disposable loaf pans so she could freeze and bake smaller servings instead of defrosting/making a whole one at once. We had one of the "loafs" - Delicious! Will make again

I added lots of fresh and roasted garlic, some fresh Parsley, some fresh Rosemary and some Jalopenas, and made my sauce from canned tomatoes, green peppers and onions caramelized in olive oil, and several ounces of Cabernet. I hardly ever add salt to any dish, but I did salt the Ground Chuck 80/20. The wine, particularly, added tremondous flavor.

I made this recipe twice, once using ground beef, and once using ground turkey; and both were great.  In both cases I halved the amount of meat and there was just the right amount.  I also added about 50% more sauce.  Great left-over as well.

Very, very good, but I did make some alterations.  I added a can of petite italian diced tomatoes, spinach leaves to the meat sauce and I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  I also used whole wheat penne noodles b/c I didn't have ziti! My whole family LOVED it!

I had to give this 5 stars because my picky-eater kids loved it!  I didn't have Ricotta so I used cottage cheese instead and just 1 egg.  I also used fake meat (vegetarian) and homemade Italian tomato sauce Since I didn't have the extra juice from real meat, I only cooked it for 30 minutes total.  I did the math and including Italian bread and sauce from scratch it cost $12.96 and we have lots of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  So much better than the $65 we pay at our favorite Italian restaurant.  Great recipe, will definitely make this for years to come.  Thanks!!

This was great, however I found that I should have slightly undercooked the pasta, as by the time it was baked, the pasta was overcooked.  Note taken for next time!

I really did enjoy this meal, but I would add about another 1/2 cup of sauce to make it better.  Additionally, make sure to place baking dish on top of a cookie sheet because it will over flow and drip onto bottom of oven.  While I did foresee this, others may not.

This recipe is wonderful and has become a weekly favorite with my family and co-workers. I usually take leftovers to work. I made a few modifications. I use ground turkey and season it with garlic salt while it is cooking. I also add chopped garlic, onion, and green pepper. I then add two jars of spaghetti sauce and cook the ground turkey sauce for about 15 minutes on medium-low. To the ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese mix I add one egg, and one frozen container of chopped spinach, cooked, and sqeeze dried. After it is layered and topped with the remaining mozzarella cheese, I bake the ziti uncovered for about 30-45 minutes in a 350 degree oven. I like to serve it with garlic rolls and ceasar salad...Fabulous!!!

A few healthy changes, used ground turkey, a can of cut tomatoes with diced Jalapenos and garlic, cut onions, low fat cottage cheese, and Dream Fields low carb pasta.  A perfect dish for a snowy night like tonight in Seattle!

Easy & Delicious! I made this twice this week - wanted an easy alternate to lasagna to have for Thanksgiving week. Everybody loved it & called it lasagna anyway. Way less fuss & dishes than a traditional lasagna & tasted better too. No danger of those dried out edges. I didn't out the mozzarella cheese on top & the second time I just used 1 lound ground beef & served with a pot of meatballs & Italian sausage. My Italian Grammy would be proud of this dish.

This is a great recipe (my family loved it) - but I would make a few changes next time. 2 lbs of ground meat was too much (even for my meat-loving fam!), and 16 oz of ziti (a whole box) works fine.

Don't forget to have some extra sauce to serve!

This recipe wasn't awful, but I didn't really care for it.  It tasted way too dry and needed salt.  Maybe it was the sauce I used - Prego 3 Cheese (not a good choice).  If I make it again, I am going to add a can of tomato sauce to the spaghetti sauce and add salt as well.  It also needs some garlic and herbs to add more flavor.

I made this recipe for the pasta dish of our Easter dinner (without the ground beef).  It was wonderful.  I double the recipe and we had leftovers for lunch and another dinner.  I will make this again and again.

I liked it...so did my husband. It came out a bit dry and the pasta was a bit undercooked. When I tried it again I added a little bit of tomato paste to just give it the little more moisture it needed.

Really good and so much simpler to make than lasagna. Next time, however, I will add a layer of veggies (mushrooms, zucchini, etc) to jazz in up a little. I cut the recipe in half but used the full amount of sauce.

Easy to do.  I made this for my family and the girls (12 & 5) couldn't get enough.  I modified it a little by adding some chopped spinach to the cheese/egg mixture, a can of Italian stewed tomatoes and some fresh garlic.  I also made sure to season the ground beef as it cooked with Creole seasoning, onion and garlic powder.  I added extra parmesan cheese too.  Will definitely make it again.

This recipe was really good but I made some changes to make it healthier.  I subbed whole wheat penne for ziti, I used ground turkey instead of beef, Low fat mozzarella, and skim milk ricotta.  I also sauteed a chopped white with 3 tbl of minced garlic in oil before adding the ground turkey.  And added a small can of mushrooms to the sauce.

My husband really loves this recipe, but I tweaked it just a little. I only use one pound of ground beef and cook it with some garlic and onion to add more flavor. I use about a jar and a half of spaghetti sauce because when I use one I think it comes out too dry. After making it a couple times with these alteration I think it is perfect!!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used mild italian sausage. Also used fresh basil and oregano from my garden in the meat sauce. I stir in a little sour cream in the cheese sauce too. Family favorite.

Mine turned out bland and dry. Not sure if I did something wrong or what. Just wasn't the best ziti recipe that I have tried.

so good, i dont normally like pasta bakes (not a big red sauce fan) but this is like a simplified lasagne. went together easy and tastes delicious. i followed the recipe to a T, except i used a little parmesan and feta on top along with the mozzarella. everything else is as is and i wouldnt change a thing.

This was easy and tasty. I also like it because it's easy to modify. I used only 1 pound of ground beef, but the same amount of cheeses. I also used part spaghetti sauce and part pizza sauce, because that's what I needed to use up, and it turned out just fine.

SEASON THE CHEESE. Okay so this recipe is delicious, I made a few small changes but mostly spices. I only used 1lb ground beef, a 32oz jar of sauce and a whole 16oz box of penne. I always season my beef with garlic salt, pepper and Italian seasoning and I started to sprinkle some garlic salt into the cheese mixture but I didn't want to overdo it. However, after tasting it, the cheese spots are kind of bland so I would definitely recommend adding some seasoning to the mixture.

All in all, this recipe is great. Plenty of meat with just 1lb and lots of cheese. :)

Excellent recipe!  Been making it at least one time per month in last year.  Everyone who tries it raves about it.

Yummmma's! !   This recipe is excellent, I cut it in half for 1 person - plenty of extra's.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out just right.  I recommend this recipe to anyone who loves pasta dishes.  Elaine, thank you for posting it.

This was okay. I guess if I'm going to the trouble, I'd just make a lasagna. Tasted about the same, just different noodles.
