This is the chicken casserole I grew up with, except we leave out the cheese.  One tip from years of making it for those of you who work outside the home full time: put the boneless skinless chicken breasts (frozen works great) in the crockpot with a cup of water on low all day... then you don't have to boil the chicken when you get home and it is so tender and easy to shred with two forks.  Also, I used just 2 Tablespoons butter; it works fine for a sleeve of buttery crackers.

A favorite recipe of ours..soooooo good! I cut the chicken in bite size pieces and saute in a little butter and olive oil instead of boiling method. Yummy!

I have been making this dish for years, it is my husband's favorite. The only thing I do different is that I use less chicken and add rice.

I have made this recipe as is for years and is a family favorite.  We spent 2 years in India and just because of being there I added 1 teaspoon of curry powder to this recipe and it was wonderful.  I now make it, often alternating using the curry powder.

Very good for a quick meal.  I used leftover KFC chicken from the night before to prepare this.  I also added a little salt, pepper, & poultry seasoning for additional flavor.

This reminds me of my mom's chicken casserole that I grew up with. It's always been my favorite dish of hers. The only difference is that, instead of the cheese, she incorporates a can of cream of celery soup (in addition to the cream of chicken), plus a little more chicken.

My friend made me this dish when I came home from having my son at the hospital ;)  It's one of my favorites now!  I made it like this, except with 1/4 cup butter, 1 tbsp poppy seed and I did not use the cheese, but I think it would be good (I used more sour cream instead).  But in my opinion, cooking the chicken like this and shredding it is the only way to go for this dish!

Amazing just as it is but I changed a few things and with my changes would give it 6 stars!!  I added  about 3/4 cup thawed peas/carrots to the sour cream / soup mixture as well as about a tbsp or 2 of Italian Seasoning.  Then to the cracker/butter mixture I also added a tbsp or 2 of Italian seasoning and about a 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  Absolutedly amazing!!!

This was really good.  I used my food processor to shred the chicken which made it really easy.  I might add some onion next time.

We make this ALL the time.  It's a no fail recipe.  You can eyeball all the ingredients and it still turns out amazing.  We serve it with biscuits and veggies.  I also put the chicken in the crockpot all day.  But I use chicken broth and italian spices for some extra flavor!

Very good ! Very easy to make with ingredients you probably already have. I cant cook ANYTHING! And I had no trouble making this dish. It's a little on the fatty side though. Enjoy :)

I made it just as it calls I think I'd use a rotisserie chicken next time for more flavor and add some veggies.

Quite good, although it came out a bit dry for our family liking. I will add an extra can of chicken soup next time, and up the poppy seeds quite substantialy - my family loves those!

Well, it's a keeper.  Made this one as a "throw in the oven" make ahead meal for my guys when I was out of town and even my son's friend had seconds. Cut back on the cheese (1/2 C) and the butter (2 TBS)- the rest as written.

I didn't have any sour cream on hand but had plain yogurt, less fat, and it tasted great! Even my picky 2 year old said it was yummy! Definitely will make it again. I also didn't use the 2 c of shredded cheese.

One of my family's favorites. To save time, I use deboned and shredded chicken from whole, skin-on breasts I boil the evening before.

I made this recipe for my husband but changed it up a bit and he LOVED it! .. and kept telling me lol. okay, so i didn't use any poppy seeds because i didn't have any, and I did add spinach. I did everything as listed, but I defrosted some frozen spinach, and added a layer of that on top of the layer of chicken. To the spinach, i sprinkled a bit of chicken bouillon (but just a tiny b it!) I also didn't add any cheese.. i forgot if it asked for some lol.

Excellent recipe! I've made this a number of times and recently I've added a couple of teaspoons of poppy seeds to the water when I boil the chicken. I simmer the chicken for about 2 hours, so it shreds very easily, then mix it with the soup and sour cream before layering it in the dish. I also cut back on the cheese just a little. I'll continue to make this at least monthly! Thank you!

Yummy!  I prefer more chicken but this is a keeper.   We served it over pasta but I like the idea of using rice or potatoes.

I love this dish and my mom made it for me when I was young.  The combination of sour cream and cream of chicken soup is very rich, so I think the cheddar cheese can be omitted.

This is a pretty good recipe, I did however change a few things. I cooked my chicken with some chicken broth in the slow cooker. I mixed the shredded chicken, about 1 tbsp of poppy seeds, sour cream, co chicken, and 1/2 the cheddar cheese. I also added some salt, garlic powder, and onion powder because it seemed to be lacking some flavor. I used 2 sleeves of garlic butter Ritz crackers and 1/4 cup of butter, 1 tbsp poppy seeds, and the rest of the cheese. Absolutely delicious!

Loved it. Mine was almost soupy? Like it slightly fell apart when you scooped it out. Everything was good. I made it without cheese. Less fattening and I don't entirely like cheese.

I made this, but mixed in a drained can of corn with the soup/sour cream mixture.  I also used only about half the amount of shredded cheddar.  It came out great!

I love this casserole. I had some that a friend had brought to my inlaws, and was so excited to find the recipe for my very own. My husband hates chicken pot pie, but he loved this!!! Reheats really well too.

This casserole was good, but had way too much butter for the topping imo (1 stick). Next time I think I will use reduced fat ingredients and only half to 1/4 of the butter. It also called for too much cheese (2 cups to top a 9x9 dish), so I would cut back on that a bit.

I added some garlic powder and onion powder to the soup mixture. Then after it was finished baking, I turned on my broiler to get the top extra crunchy. YUM.

This was very rich but tasty.  I added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning to boost the flavor.  I also added a handful of frozen peas to get some veggies into it.  I cut back on the amount of butter in the topping to about 2 tbsp and I also only added about a cup of cheese (to make it less fattening!).  I used leftover rotisserie chicken and it added a nice flavorful boost.  To be honest, I wasn't blown away by it, but it was a nice easy recipe that my family enjoyed.

This was good, but not great. Feels like it was missing something. I did add peas in with it also to give the kids their veggies.

I gave this 4 stars because I modified it but with the modifications its def a 5 star dish. Its so good. I add rice, broccoli and a can of cream of broccoli soup. I also use half the amount of sour cream and use some of the left over water from the chicken to to keep the chicken moist. If you mix the chicken into the soup and water it helps to keep it from drying out. 
everyone at home loves this one!

This could not be easier to make, and my family and friends LOVE it! It is now my "go to" casserole whenever I need to take a dish to someone after they have had a baby, surgery, or just feeling under the weather, and they ALL send me a message afterward asking for the recipe! I now make it in bulk (6-8 at a time) and put them in the freezer - these casseroles freeze and thaw/cook great! Thanks for sharing!

My family loves this dish. The only change is I don't add the cheese and I add 1 can of peas and carrots to the sour cream and soup mixture (so my kids get a little veg!) and they devour it. Almost no left overs! Great recipe!

The addition of cheddar cheese to this classic recipe was so good, I'll never make the original again. I prepared this exactly as written, except for the amount of poppy seeds. I used one Tblsp. instead of one tsp. Usually, this is served over rice, but it is so good, that is definitely optional.

This was so easy and tasted so good! I was lazy so I just bought the shredded rotisserie chicken at the deli and it literally took me 10 minutes to throw everything together. I used fat free sour cream and fat free cream of chicken soup to cut calories where I could. (Take what you can get, right?) Will definitely be making this again. Might mix some cooked rice in it next time.

Me and my kids love this recipe. The crust makes it sooo tasty. I triple the crust and double the sour cream and cream of chicken. That's just my preference, however it's delightful just the way it is… DELISH!!!! I've made several times… :)

I made this for dinner this week and my boyfriend ate it so fast that not only did we not have any leftovers, but I had to battle to get my portion of dinner! It's really yummy and ridiculously easy to make. I loved that we already had a majority of the ingredients. I may even make it again tomorrow, to use up the sour cream in the fridge.

Good dish.  I loaded it with more veggies, so it ended up being very full. Like others, I thought the dill made unique. I scarfed down two servings (not that abnormal).  My dad and his friend each had a couple, too (not that abnormal either).  At least half of the casserole dish remained.  My husband relentlessly dominated the entire rest of the casserole.  Unfortunately, that's not that abnormal either, but I think it suffices to say that we all enjoyed it...some more than others.

Perfect combination of creamy and crunchy. Didn't have to change anything to make it great. But keep in mind that it doesn't keep well as left-overs...the topping gets soggy, though, it's unlikely you'll have any left-overs!

It was yummy.  I would suggest more ritz crackers on top the crust is delicious.  I did add a little broth from the chicken to the casserole because of reviews that it was too dry, but it definitely wasn't dry at all, I also used some of the broth to cook some white rice and this went nicely over the rice and the rice helped soak up some of the liquid.

A perennial favorite in our house!  The only thing I recommend is some additional seasoning in the cracker mix.

OhMyGosh!  This is one of the best Casseroles my husband and I have ever put into our mouths!

It is so unusual, it is impossible to describe the flavor!  But it is FULL of flavor!

Delicious!  I will make this again and again!  Thank You!

This casserole is scrumptious! I added extra popppy seed to the topping of crackers as well as paprika. I did this just for added flair for the final apperance. I took leftovers for my lunch the next day and was asked for the recipe from several co workers.

Our annual family reunion favorite (sans cheese)!   This is one of those recipes where substitution usually equals success.  I've used leftover turkey mixed with chicken (even canned, when necessary). I've sautéed the cut-up chicken in O.oil, which added a different, deeper flavor.  We've used cream of mushroom, celery and I'd like to try c.o. Asparagus too, mixed with at least one can of c.o. Chicken.  

For us, the more crackers, the better! I always mix the crackers/poppy seeds with softened butter rather than melted butter.  My cousin, who started the "poppy seed chicken" tradition said it seemed less "greasy" this way.  I've never had mine come out oily or greasy, so I have to assume she's correct.   This is a good potluck and works well for large families like ours.  We make this for 30+ and there are rarely left-overs!

My aunt used to make this dish.. always wondered how she made when I found this recipe.  I decided to make it for my husband. HUGE HIT!!! He kept telling me how much he loved it.. To me, it tasted just like my aunt made it.  

The only pan I had this size was a foil pan. I wouldn't recommend using this type of pan because the bottom half was warm & not hot. But overall, Great dish!

This is one of my favorites meals. And to make it less fattening, I use the 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, low fat or fat free sour cream,  and use wheat Ritz crackers and a whipped butter and not as much. I also serve this over rice!

I love this, it's my favorite casserole. I use the Chicken N Bisquit crackers & add a can of cream of mushroom. Also I use the cans of cubed chicken breast pieces, saves time & I don't like chicken fat.

This is delicious! When I make it again (hubby is already asking “when”), I’ll make the following changes (only for personal taste); I’ll reduce the cheese to about half of what the recipe calls for; I’ll mix the chicken, soup, poppy seeds, & sour cream all together before placing in the dish; I’ll increase the poppy seeds to 1 1/2 teaspoons. These changes are all personal preferences as this recipe is delicious as is but I feel it can be just a smidge better with the above changes. Hubby thought it was so good, he ate what little leftovers there were, cold, as his “fourth meal”. He also thought this was one of those recipes that are even better the next day (because the flavors meld together so well! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This is a family favorite. I do not put cheese in mine. However, I add a can of  sliced mushrooms ( 2 small ones or 1 big one).   And I double the ritz cracker topping.  This also freezes well. This is good to give as a sympathy casserole or to someone who just had a baby.

I made this in the very early 90s and not since then. I don’t recall where the recipe came from, but the version I made had a rice base and no cheese. I made it just tonight (plus rice, minus cheese) for my fiancé (we’ve been together for 15 years) and he wants to know who I’ve been holding out lol. Also, I made my own cream of chicken soup:

I changed up this recipe...sliced the chicken and cooked it in oil and garlic. After adding cooked chicken to the dish with half the sauce (also added a cup of the cheese to the soup mixture), I cut up a red pepper, garden onions, and asparagus and added the raw veggie pieces on top of the chicken. Then I added the rest of the sauce. Then sprinkled about a cup of the cheese on top. Then sprinkled the cracker topping. It was excellent!!!

Great just as written. Husband loved it so did the teenager!! It was not dried out at all. I kept aluminum foil on top for 20 min took it off for the last 15. Top was crunchy and the filling was fantastic!! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

As kids, we called this dish Chicken Ala Gunta (with a long U sound).  We didn't know what the name was, so just made one up.  I like to add a couple of T of cooking Sherry or Brandy to the sauce.  Serve with Jasmine rice, fresh steamed broccoli and your favorite bread (Sister Shubert's Yeast Rolls) for a meal fit for a king (or queen)!

Made this tonight for dinner and my teenage boys said to me afterwards, “that’s a keeper”. I didn’t use poppyseeds though. I didn’t have any & this dish still turned out amazing. I also cooked the chicken in a pan with butter & oil while adding salt,pepper,garlic powder, onion powder, & thyme. Afterwards I scraped all the pan dripping and added to the creamy mixture. Wowza, yum! So much flavor.

I’ve been making this recipe for years—my own version. I add 1/2 cup chopped onions, sweet roasted red peppers, mushrooms and Natures Seasons spice to give it some taste.

This has been a longtime favorite!  I usually chunk the chicken rather than shred it and put the soup/sour cream mixture on a bed of brown rice.  Yummy!

I give this a five as a starter recipe. I doubled it for a 13x9 dish. I also added carrots to boiling chicken and then frozen peas and then rice. Once all was cooked I removed from the heat. I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. I also mixed some canned mushrooms and added some poppy seeds to the soup mixture. Everything else was the same. It was delicious!!

Loved it.  Looking for  easy filling recipes to make and freeze for my parents,  Only thing I changed was sauteing the chicken in some olive oil and butter per another suggestion and adding some sage and rosemary.  A keeper

The only thing I did different was wait to put the cheese and cracker mixture on the last 10 minutes. That way the crackers don’t get too dark. Very good recipe. I serve it over rice. Yummy

For a first timer I did not know that you should toast the cracker mixture in a skillet and melt the butter in a skillet the addd the crackers and toast in skillet. Mine looks horrible. I hope it tastes okay. You should be more specific with the directions of the recipe. Idk if it’s Edible or not right now. I’m disabled and on food stamps. So this was a big waste of a meal if we can’t eat this! ????

I use a whole roasted chicken and put a layer of rice on the bottom and add the mixture to the top. I use 2 sleeves of ritz and a stick of butter. You may have to add a bit more soup or sour cream for the extra chicken.

My friend and I made this for a church supper, for about 40 people. It was the first time I ever made it and, actually the first time I had ever heard of it! It came out really good and was very easy to make several at one time. We didn't add the cheese, since my friend said she had always made it without the cheese.

We made 6 tins, which was enough for everyone. Served with rice and green salad. We made it a few days in advance and it kept well in the frig. 

This is one that we will keep in the rotation for the church supper.

I have made this many times and it is  a perfect recipe! I have found that using  the Ritz brand crackers and Campbell's brand soup does make a difference in taste. Stick with these brands. I serve the casserole over white rice or buttered noodles with peas and a salad on the side.

I cooked chicken cubes instead of boiling it after reading someone elses comment.
Thought it would be pretty bland but turned out ok
Easy to make
Not sure what the poppy seeds did for taste??? Probably could have left them out without much difference.
Will make this again.

Wonderful recipe!! Has always been a family fave passed down from my mom. The only thing different is I add a can of creamy onion soup with the cream of chicken soup to up the flavor. Poppy seeds make it pretty but don't need them if you don't have them.

This recipe reminds me of a dish we grew up eating in my family.  However, my Mom would always add boiled carrots and onions with the chicken.  These add a little more flavor to the mix.

This was delicious.  I made it for a few friends that came over for dinner and they all got seconds.  I did add an additional can of cream of mushroom and added ranch dressing to the soup mix as other suggested.  It was wonderful!

i used chicken thighs and i didnt cook them before i put them in so i had to add like 40 more mins to the timer, it ended up perfect with the chicken thighs cooked all the way through but so tender thighs are defiantly the way to go.

This recipe is a little different than the way I usually make it but decided to give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it and it was delicious!  It was creamy and just plain yummy.  I immediately decided that this would replace my old recipe.  The next time I made it, I cooked the frozen chicken in the crockpot which was super simple and made shredding a breeze.  I also added cooked wild rice to the bottom of the layers.  However, I don't recommend adding the rice because it totally changed the consistency and made it very dry.  Lesson learned!

I used to make this years ago and loved it and forgot about it till i came up on this recipe. I used to use a can of cream of celery and chicken with the sour cream and use a rotisserie chicken shredded with about 2 cups of rice with broccoli and used more butter and crushed crackers with the cheese.

This is a favorite in my house! It is comfort food at its best. I do cut the amount of butter by about 3/4..that's just personal preference after having made this a handful of times.

I loved the idea of the recipe and it was very easy to prepare.  As I was sprinkling on the cheese my instincts told me two cups was way too much.  I should have stopped at 1/2 cup and the casserole would have been delicious.  Two cups of cheese created an unpleasant fondue on top.  We had to scrape most of it off to make it edible.  Other reviewers haven't mentioned this.  For us, it was just too thick and gooey.

I've been making this for my family sver since my husband and I got married. His mom gave me the recipe she had used for decades. I don't use the shredded cheese and add 2 tsp poppy seeds. This is a quick, filling meal that's great by itself or with your favorite vegetable sides.

Have made this many times.  I season the chicken with onion, garlic, salt, pepper, carrot, etc and cook in chicken broth or stock for more flavor.  Great left over, freezes great, also delicious with any of the ritz crackers.  Have used the buttery, the wheat, the plain.  Also have cooked chicken in pressure cooker when short on time.  I don't layer.  Just stir everything together and put crackers and melted butter on top.  Don't have to measure chicken after a few times.  Just approximate amt.   Also put in microwave for a few minutes to get it hot and speeds up cooking time.  Make day before and bake next day.  Even better.

This is an awesome dish! I made a few modifications though. I boiled the chicken breasts in chicken broth instead of water, added seasonings, and instead of the crackers, I used the French's fried onions.

Great recipe. Really rich though. Used cornflakes instead of crackers and added some garlic and onions. Next time I will add rice (uncooked).

this was a great easy dinner for my family. However I did replace the boiled chicken with chunk white chicken in a can. Great time saver! Also doubled my recipe with the exception of sour cream,  only used 8 ounces. Added a lot more poppy seeds, YUM!

Terrific recipe. I added real bacon bits to the soup mixture and holy cow. Definitely going to be serving this again. May reduce the butter by half though.

Ok this definitely doesn’t look pretty for the picky eater (I just remember when I was a kid I stayed AWAY from casseroles), but it. is. delicious. I was counting on leftovers but there were none! 

•	Topping it over rice is crucial. I'm all about ease, so I separately made the SteamFresh White Rice with Veggies blend. It makes it taste more like chicken pot pie but without the soggy vegetables normally cooked inside!
•	For ease and quickness, I took the suggestion to cook the chicken in the crockpot all day while at work so I only had to pull it apart and assemble the casserole when I got home. I cooked the chicken in one can of chicken broth for flavor and seasoned each piece with oregano, basil and garlic powder
•	I used well more than 1 teaspoon of poppyseeds but its certainly a preference.  My only change for next time is to try putting some poppyseeds into the casserole soup mix not just in the crust
•	I prefer shredded cheese blends, so I used Mild Cheddar Jack. GREAT!
•	I had to use an 8x8 pan – that’s all I had and I like the casserole to be chicken dense

Absolutely delicious!

This has always been a family favorite,but without the cheese.  With hungry teenagers, I use a double pack of cooked chicken strips from Costco, a family-size cream of chicken soup, 12 oz of sour cream and 1 1/2 rows of crackers in a 13x9x2.  I love the idea of using a roasted chicken too.  I serve it over rice or egg noodles, and my kids fight for the leftovers!

Very good casserole!  I don't use canned soups, made my own with the broth from the chicken I made in the crockpot yesterday. Also used light sour cream and cut down just a bit on the butter. I love the crushed cracker /poppyseed topping.  Will definitely make this again.

This casserole is  amazing!  There are never any leftovers when I make this.  My husband loves it and requests it all the time.  My 2 year old even eats a second serving! A huge hit at our house that I will keep making!!

My family loves this recipe.  I have made this several times.  If I don't have time to cook the chicken, I stop at the deli and get 4 cooked chicken breast which makes this recipe a breeze but delicious. This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Next time I will put the chicken in the slow cooker and season it. But otherwise this was a fantastic dish that will be in our rotation for sure!

I've been making this for years but i leave out the cheese and mix the poppyseedsin with the sour cream and cream of chicken.I alsoput the crackers on top, which makes freezing easier,just thaw put crackers and butter on top and bake. Everybody loves it. The kids always clean their plates. I serve over white rice. It also is better the next day.

Skip the cheese and add peas to the soup mixture! My grandma has made this for my birthday every year of my life... Its my favorite! If youre running short on time grab a rotissere chicken and let it cool before adding soup mixture and peas.

If you're looking for stick-to-your-ribs comfort food, this dish delivers.  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I would reduce the amount next time, as it came out more like a party dip than a casserole.  I served it on toast and found it lovely.  I also added broccoli for some vitamins.

This was easy and great! I didnt use the cheese but instead used rice since my husband loves rice! My mother-in-law was in town and enjoyed this recipe a lot too! It needed some water or more cream of chicken as it was just a little dry.... will def make it again!
