I have been making this recipe for over four years, and here are my suggestions and/or recipe changes:

1) Substitute three cans of Solo apricot filling for the apricots (will make layer filling much thicker and tastier)

2) For cake mix, use Duncan Hines Butter Golden cake

3) Add two to three tablespoons of pure almond extract

Enjoy!

I made this cake for my sister's birthday and everyone loved it!  I did make a few changes though.  I used Chambord (raspberry liqueur) instead of Amaretto, substituted canned raspberries for apricots, added some raspberry fruit spread to the filling to give it a thicker consistency, and topped the icing with some fresh raspberries.  It was so delicious.  Only thing I will do differently next time is cut the icing measurements in half- it made way too much icing for one cake!

this cake is very delicious indeed. the only downside to this cake it that it is somewhat of a costly cake to make. but all in all, it is very delicious. more of an adult type of cake.

I made this cake for a friend that loves Amaretto and it was a "WOW" reaction. I took the advice of others and did not do this filling recipe.  I could not find Solo apricot.  So, I cut up 3 bags of dried apricots, soaked them in water for 20 minutes and cooked them until tender.  I processed them with 3/4 c. of sugar and 2/3 c. of amaretto.  It was great and enough for 3 layers.  I also added 2 teas. of almond extract to the cake batter.  My icing was too thin even with adding lots more sugar.  Next time, I will use 12 oz. of cream cheese.  I covered the cake with toasted, sliced almonds.  I would make this again.

This cake was delicious, but after reading the reviews I changed some of the recipe. I doubled the apricots and used less Amaretto which wasn't necessary, the extra apricots could handle the Amaretto. I would also put some frosting on the layers with the apricots or use less powdered sugar because it was alot of icing.

Wow, yummy!  I made the recipe exactly as directed and it was fantastic.  I had worried the apricot filling would be too thin and soak into the cake but it didn't.  Changes I'll make next time: This does make a lot of frosting, I'll probably follow another reviewers suggestion and add a thin layer of frosting to the inner layers of cake. The cake was a little difficult to cut in half, next time I'll freeze the layers before cutting them.

This cake tasted pretty good, but if I make it again I will make a change. The recipe states  blending the amaretto and the apricots until smooth then spread filling on cake. Well, my filling didn't spread.. it poured. It was like orange water. I wasn't sure about this, but went ahead and finsihed recipe. The cake tasted good, but for me and my guests...the filling had a little too much amaretto bite. I think, next time, I will use 2 cans of apricots and maybe  1/3 cup of amaretto in the filling. This isn't a cake that would appeal to little kids.

I thought the cake was too strong at first.  Then I put the leftovers in the refrigerator and the next day the cake tasted great!  Next time I'll refrigerate the cake overnight before serving.

This recipe wasn't what I expected. When i read over the ingredients and directions, I expected the filling to be more filling and less puddle. I also wasn't expecting the frosting to be a glaze. The flavors were very good.. but it definitely needs some fine tuning.

Very nice tasting cake. If I make it again I will use the berry filling. The frosting made a lot. I will also decrease the cream cheese.One other problem I ran into the frosting was very runny. I keep putting the cake in the fridge. Any suggestions............

I'm sorry to say I found this recipe disappointing. It didn't have the rich Amaretto flavor I was hoping for. I DID, however, love the apricot/Amaretto puree, and will use that again with a different cake.

Agree with Linda T. Will add more apricots for the puree. I will also be spreading icing between the layers before the puree next time.

This is the very BEST cake I have tasted - I made it for a group of friends who immediately wanted the recipe.  Don't change a thing - it's just perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

Maybe consider reducing the filling down a bit so the cake isn't as soaked with amaretto.

I made as the recipe states but less sugar in the frosting(2 cups instead of 4).  Tried layering the filling first then the frosting but that got messy! Then tried frosting first then filling. But I think the point is for the filling to soak into the cake. But all in all it was a wonderful cake!! It goes best with cofee!! I am eating a piece right now with my coffee!

We just got done making this cake.  Yes, the frosting is too runny.  We noticed that after we had added 2 cups of powdered sugar, it was the ideal consistency, but adding the additional 2 cups of sugar is what made is loosen up.  My recommendation is to add LESS sugar (only 2 out of the 4 cups).

I made this into cupcakes.  I skipped the apricot filling.  I used 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of the 4 the recipe called for in the icing.  The icing wasn't as firm without the 4th cup, but the flavor was awesome! They were a big hit at the picnic.

Wonderful, it tastes and looks like you spent a lot of time making it but is fairly simple.  The only change I would make is to reduce the amount of cream cheese and powdered sugar in the frosting by half.  It was way too much for just frosting the sides and top.

I followed the suggestion to use Solo canned apricot filling, Duncan Hines Butter Yellow cake mix, and also to add almond extract to the cake mix. I used less powered sugar for the frosting than called for, just kept mixing it in until the sugar started overtaking the cream cheese (maybe about 2.5 cups of powered sugar to the 2 packages of cream cheese). I made it for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews from everyone!!

This cake was fantastic - a couple comments. I only used 2 TBS liquer in with the apricots. Otherwise it would have been way too wet and way too strong for me and my household (could have gone to about 1/4 cup comfortably though I think, just watch the consistency of the filling, too wet and it will run everywhere). Also be aware the frosting makes a TON - I almost think it could easily be halved, however I'm not a huge icing fan - but just depends on how thick you like it. It is a nice contrast to the tart apricot filling, so the balance was good. I only used 3 cups powdered sugar in mine and otherwise followed the instructions / ingredients. This is a lovely cake, and the layers make it a little "extra" special!

This is the requested cake by my husband for his birthday annually.  A 4 as is, a 5 with some changes as others have suggested.  To reduce the liquidness of the filling I use 2-3 cans solo apricot filling with a splash of amaretto (1-2 tablespoons tops).  Otherwise wonderful and a hit with the birthday guests.
