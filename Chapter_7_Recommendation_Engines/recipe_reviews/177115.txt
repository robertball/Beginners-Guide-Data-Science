These are so delicious. I added some chopped green olives to the feta and it tasted like a burger from my favorite greek diner. I know the combo sounds weird but it's a must try if you like green olives. Thanks for sharing this. New, different and so easy.

We love feta cheese so this was wonderful.  We grilled the burgers and they were flavorful and juicy.

My wife and I both enjoyed this recipe a lot, though my son thought they were marginal. Next time, I may want to try these with bleu cheese. The Longbranch in Leshara, Nebraska made burgers with the same concept, placing cheddar or American cheese with grilled onions in the middle of the burgers.

ADDENDUM: It took me awhile, but I finally tried these with bleu cheese, and we like them even better that way, probably because the bleu cheese has a stronger flavor. I made sure to place a large charge of bleu cheese smack dab in the middle of the burger, in addition to mixing bleu cheese with all of the hamburger. I added a few extra splashes of Worcestershire sauce too.  Remember to find that fine line between mixing the ingredients enough so the meat stays together and the ingredients are evenly distributed, but not so much that the burgers become dry because the meat is too compressed. Keeping the hamburger somewhat loose is the secret to juicy burgers.

I do not own a grill, but thought these burgers were restaurant quality.  I just fried them on the stovetop and then put them in the oven with the sweet potato sticks I was baking to make sure the feta got cooked (I'm pregnant).  I added more worshershire sauce, double at least.  Very easy, very quick.  Thanks!

Had these tonight, they are a good and I'm glad we tried them, however next time I would just make "feta-topped hamburgers" instead of stuffing them.  Stuffing them made them very thick, and it would just be much easier to top them, and have the flavor across the entire top of the burger.  Also recommend using goat cheese; the ones tonight half were feta and half were goat cheese.

I added dried basil in these instead of parsley.  Forgot the worcershire and I think it needed it.  They had a nice creamy center with the feta; I will try them again on the grill but I did them under the broiler and dried them a bit!  Wasn't my day for cooking! :(

A very moist hamburger with a surprise in the middle.  I made this as written, but next time I will amp up the seasoning a little bit.  I went to our favorite greek restaurant and bought fresh pitas to serve these on and made Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce from this site to use a the condiment for these burgers.  I didn't have any problems getting the two patties to seal.  The results were a very tasty hamburger that we will be having again.  Thanks *cookin'mama* for sharing.

BEST BURGER EVER!  We looooooved them!  We added a little extra Worcestershire sauce, but just a splash or two.  We did them on the stove top and with turkey burger instead of beef.  Now that we've had these, I'm not sure we'll ever cook a plain burger again!

I usually add my  spices to about 1/4 cup of red wine then let it sit before pouring over the  ground meat and mixing with 2 forks. This worked well with the feta.  I added hickory chips to the charcoal which really added to the overall taste.

I thought this was very good. Added a little burst of flavor in the middle of the burger. We still used american on top and ketchup just because it was a little dry, but would make it again.

These fell apart on me a little bit, but the flavor was great.  My 19-month-old son tore these burgers up and loved the feta- who knew?!  We will definitely make these again

Sooooo delicious.  Couple additions I made: mixed in garlic, onion and the feta instead of having it on top.  The best thing I added was some homemade guacamole on top of the burger.

I read the reviews and the advice that someone gave about handling the meat as little as possible, but these burgers took quite a bit of handling.  I under-seasoned them, so next time I'll do better with that.  These burgers smelled better than they tasted.  I loved them in pita with tzatziki (the recipe on this site is amazing.)  I will make these again...they seem worthy.

These were amazing! The only complaint I had was I wish I had stuffed more feta inside! My husband loved these and said they are the only burgers he wants to grill from now on! We did use some different seasonings, but we just seasoned the beef to our taste. Amazing, we will be making these a lot more often!

This was a little awkward to make. The amount of feta the recipe says to put into the hamburgers was impossible I had to cut it way back. Otherwise, pretty good.

My hubby and I are feta fans.  I thought it sounded like it may end up being a little too plain for us, so I added some chopped onion and garlic, upped the Worcestershire sauce, and added a little A1 steak sauce as well.  They turned out really tasty, and I will make again.  I think my additions changed the texture some and I had to be super careful when flipping, but they thankfully did not fall apart.

I added dried oregano, since that is essential for Greek flavors, fresh mint, and finely chopped onion. I wasn't paying attention and mixed the feta into the meat. It was messy but really good!

We LOVED it! I did tweak it a bit, by  adding a few breadcrumbs, finely chopped onion and egg to the meat. Inside I just HAD to put  bacon bits inside. I may try other additions another time.

Nice! I wanted something different, and definitely got it! Love it! No toppings needed! I used some extra Worcestershire as well!

I substituted soy sauce for the Worcestershire sauce and added a bit of garlic powder to the burgers. I served them with a side of fried tomatoes with basil and olive oil.

These burgers really were something else.  I only gave them 4 stars simply because I'm not a huge fan of Feta.  :)

I loved this.  Made as described except used 1 1/4 lb ground sirloin and made 4 burgers.  Wanted them a little larger!  In addition to the parsley I added 1/2 tsp or so of oregano and doubled the w-shire.  Very very yummy!!
