We really liked this.  I thought the seasoning in the box of rice was great.  Like another reviewer, I used fresh mushrooms.  Next time I make it, I will use a leaner sausage because it was a little greasy.  I will also leave the margarine out that the box of rice calls for.  It doesn't need it with the sausage in it.  Thanks Robyn!

Pretty good...keep in mind, the taste of the seasoning packet used with the rice will dominate the taste of the dish. Maybe the seasoning packet shouldn't be used? The recipe doesn't say but all the 6oz boxes of rice that I buy include a seasoning packet so I just assume it was to be included (without it, there is no seasonings?)Also, instead of canned mushrooms, I used fresh. I'll maybe play around with this in the future.

I used Turkey Sausage and the seasoning packet that came with the box of rice, and it turned out great.  Maybe I will try it without the seasoning packet next time, for a different taste.  Overall this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks

This wild rice pilaf a wonderfully versatile recipe that lets you change it around to suit your tastes with almost no effort.  Weather you use turkey sausage, pork sausage, or ground beef, it always turns out well.  I make this just about once a week at house using pork breakfast sausage and it's loved by everyone.

I started out with 3 cups of cooked long grain rice left over and was looking for a recipe to use it with.  I had kielbasa sausage on hand, and sliced that up and browned both sides, then added 1/2 a sweet onion chopped, and used fresh mushrooms (125g, or about 1.5 cups chopped) and let it 'simmer' for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Then I added the cooked rice, blended it all together, and let it 'simmer' covered for 5 more minutes.  It turned out pretty good, if still a little bland.  I would make again with my modifications though.

A very basic recipe.  I used it as a starting ground. I've used it 2 times now and both times it turned out differently.  I made a rice blend in a rice cooker with a cube of bullion.  Then cooked up some turkey & apple sausage and diced onion in a skillet.  My husband and 18 month old both liked it.  I'd give it 4 stars but I didn't make the recipe as instructed either time.
