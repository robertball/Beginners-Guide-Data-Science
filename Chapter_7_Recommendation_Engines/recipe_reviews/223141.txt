I doubled this recipe to make two smoothies. I don't keep soy milk on hand, I used lactose free milk instead. The kids LOVED this smoothie--my oldest boy said it reminds him of Orange Julius.

I thought this was good. However, it oddly didn't taste that sweet and I used a sweet in season peach. To fix that I added 1 Tblsp. of vanilla protein powder. That seemed to be perfect. I thought the calorie count was a tad high and so I just made 2 servings out of it. TY

Great! Used frozen peaches and I always have over ripe frozen bananas on hand. I used unsweetened almond milk and omitted the juice, added the flax seed and also added 1 tblspn of wheat germ. Thanks!

Perfectly Peachy. I used a fresh orange instead of juice, and  I didn't have soy milk, so used Greek yogurt thinned with fat free milk instead. Added in some nutmeg to give it a fall flavor after tasting it, was good without also. I think a handful of oats would be more filling, I'll try that next time.

Yummo! I added a Tbsp Greek yogurt and a scoop of protein powder as well. The yogurt gave it a nice creamy texture without having a yogurt taste.

It was great!The orange juice really brought out the flavor,making it a orangey tingly taste.Thee only suggestion I have though,is that if you don't have time to freeze your fruit,add some ice cubes,and make sure to skin the peach before you add it in.

I made it exactly to the recipe.  It was good!  Next time I'll probably decrease the OJ slightly and increase the soy milk.  I used lightly sweetened vanilla soy milk and to my surprise, it tasted sweet enough for me.

Delicious!  I used frozen peaches.  Banana was not frozen but it was fine and still cold.  I didn't have soy milk so used unsweetened almond milk.  Easy to make and delicious.  I will definitely make it again!

Awesome recipe, used frozen peaches and a room temperature banana instead. I also added a handful of spinach, chia seeds and a teaspoon of agave syrup and it was delicious. Definitely will be using this recipe again.

I added some of my own ingredients to try to make it a little bit healthier. However, it did not turn out how I expected. The smoothie was chunkie and lumpie but the more I blended the more it would just thin out! So I had lumpy and chunky juice. I think it may have been the protein powder or hemp hearts I added that made it this way. I was not happy with the end result.
