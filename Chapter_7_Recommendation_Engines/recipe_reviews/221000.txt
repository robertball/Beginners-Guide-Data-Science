Hi there! I am the self professed foodie who submitted this recipe, and there is an error in the brown sugar amount. It should read 2 TBSP, and not 1/2tsp. Not sure why that happened, but happy people have been enjoying our family favourite ham! Just made it for our Easter dinner, and everyone left the table very content! Thanks for the wonderful reviews!

Loved it! I used a can and a half of beer, almost 1/3 cup dijon and a large handful of brown sugar for an 8.5 pound ham and turned out great! Plenty of juice in the pan to keep it moist. I cooked mine a bit longer, but otherwise, great simple recipe to start with!

My wife and I did not like it.  We don't like beer. That must have been the reason.  It tasted bitter I think.  After washing each slice and cutting away the outside from each slice it tasted good enough to eat.
I'll use 16oz bottle of cola next time instead of beer sugar and mustard.

This was very yummy!  I did mine in a roaster.  Half the time was face up then turned face down for the rest.  I didn't have dijon mustard so used regular yellow mustard and added a little liquid smoke.  Was very juicy and tasty.  Will definitely do this again!

This was delicious! I used Sam Adams White Christmas beer because it has some good spices in it. I was not able to baste it for the 1st hour because we were gone, so I did it in an oven bag to keep it moist. After the 1sr hour I basted a few times and it turned out PERFECT. It was a hit, even the left overs got eaten!!!

I will try this again as the results may have been my fault. My ham came out very tasty, but not juicy. It was dry, almost like a country ham. But, I did not read where I was suppose to continue to baste it after covering it with foil. And I did cook the ham face up as opposed to face down like the package directions on my ham stated. Unfortunately, a lot of it was wasted and thrown out. Was even too dry for sandwiches. I had a 10lb ham, so maybe I overcooked it....
Worth the try and will update after making again. Thanks!

I am a big fan of Allrecipes.  I made a 10lb ham and used an IPA beer and followed the recipe.  I basted frequently so I baked at 350 and 375 because of the heat loss of oven opening.  I also baked cut side up but was hesitant doing so.  Ham was delicious and very moist.  A keeper.

I needed a ham for a late Christmas get-together, so I decided to try this recipe. Overall, it turned out very good. The basting at the beginning is kind of a hassle, and I'm not really sure if doing that adds that much to the final product. I covered it tightly with foil and let it cook for 60 minutes, versus 90, simply because I used a 6-lb ham instead of 8. The finished ham was great. After slicing, I spooned the pan drippings over the ham, and it was very moist and flavorful.

I sliced it off the bone and put it in the crockpot. Then I poured everything over it and set it for low for 2 hours. It made serving for Easter much easier.

The positive reviews are spot on, this was by far the best way to cook a ham.  It was truly delicious and certainly not hard to make.  As other said it was kind of a pain to continue to baste but well worth the time!

1.2.20  Followed this recipe to the letter, and this was the best ham I’ve ever made.  My ham weighed 8.03 lb, I used my new digital food thermometer/oven probe (Christmas gift), took the ham out of the oven at 140ºF, let it sit covered for about 10 minutes, and this was the juiciest, tastiest ham ever.  FYI, if you don’t have a digital food thermometer, it was just about 90 minutes, as listed in the recipe, and if checking with your meat thermometer, just keep that 140ºF in mind.  Don’t be concerned about the beer because you won’t taste that.  Gotta think the constant basting is key to the juiciness of the ham, which easily can end up dried out.  Next time I bake a ham, this is my go-to recipe, Thanks for sharing,  it got a thumbs-up in this house.

This ham turned out to be the most moist ham we've ever had.  I put in a lot of work basting it but it was SO worth it.  My family loved it.  I'm sure I'll make it this way again next year.

This was AWESOME!  I have cooked a lot of hams in my life and this is by far the easiest and the  most moist ham ever.  I will for sure make it again.  I would like to try with a dark beer.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was an 11 lb spiral sliced ham and I cooked it covered for 90 minutes which was the time recommended for an 8 lb ham.  It was way overdone.  It was tender but dry and the marinade was not that tasty.  Very watery and not sweet at all.  I wouldn't make this again

My husband always smokes our hams and turkeys and I wanted something different. I'm from VA and use to eating baked hams. I loved the twist on this with the Dijon mustard and beer. Yes, it was very juicy and my husband even liked it.

A go-to recipe for us. One exception, we replace the beer with ginger ale.  Wow super moist and delicious.
I also just pat extra brown sugar on ham... it's  Christmas.

Good tasting ham but cooking time & temperature is way off and I had to add another 1/2 bottle of good beer to continue basting. I will make this again without this recipe

I made this on Easter exactly as the recipe stated. I was worried that, what seemed to me was an extended baking time, would dry it out but it wasn’t dry at all. I was pleasantly surprised. I didn’t use a glaze so all you taste is The ham. Maybe next year I’ll put some brown sugar on it

While we're not big fans of ham, the local market had an insane deal. We tried this recipe and the ham came out great. Tender, juicy without that rubbery texture that seems to prevail with other cooking methods.

This is a FANTASTIC Easter ham. I used spicy mustard as opposed Dijon, but other than that, I followed the recipe verbatim. I used a 7.5qt Dutch oven for an 8lb bone-in smoked ham, and it came out deliciously flavorful and super moist: a perfect holiday ham.

This was the most moist smoked ham I have every made!  I used a large pan with a lid (think pot roast pan).  I get my ham smoked by the butcher, so it is already cooked through.  I heated my 6 lb. ham for an hour and it was heated through.  It would have been too dried out if I left it in much longer.  The lid to my pan was key; if I had just put foil over it, I think it would have dried out.  Every time I opened the pan lid to baste it, the steam would hit me in the face.  So the ham baked in moistness and it was perfect!  Served this for dinner guests and they raved about it!

This recipe is great.  The ham is really moist & tender.  Fabulous leftovers.  I only used half of the Dijon and it was still too much for our taste but it was very very good.  Half of the mustard is good.  Definitely will cook ham like this again.

Really like this recipe. I am not a beer drinker, hate the stuff actually, but I had a can of Modelo in the back of my fridge so decided to give the recipe a shot. I made it as written and it was fabulous. Didnt really smell that good cooking but the result was juicy and delicious!

I made it exactly as is and it turned out delicious.  My Swedish husband said it was more similar to the hams he had in Sweden versus the Honey Hams we've had at Christmas.  Not sure why but I'll definitely be making this again.

Turned out great! Instead of basting the ham I injected the marinade! Delicious!

I've done two of these and this is the best recipe I have ever found for hams.
