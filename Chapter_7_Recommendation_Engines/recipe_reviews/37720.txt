Just an FYI...these are NOT sugarless.  They should be labeled as "No sugar added" or something along those lines.  
The dates, raisins, and prunes are actually  incredibly high in sugars.  Natural sugars are better for you, but this recipe would not necessarily be good for someone who needs to, or wishes to, strictly limit sugars in his/her diet.

I made these muffins to "disguise" prunes for a friend during a long recouperation.  Although I figured out I should add the water to the fruit before cooking, maybe it should be a bit clearer about that.  I mixed together a topping of chopped nuts, brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled a little on before baking (which I do with a lot of muffins and bread).  They are very tasty and light!  Thanks for sharing.  EV

In a word . . .  YUM!  I made these for my toddler twins and ended up eating as much as they did.  (They loved them too.)  I didn't have prunes so I used dried cranberries instead.  I also substituted a mix of wheat germ and ground flaxseed for 1/4 cup of flour to add a bit more nutrition (and a full teaspoon of baking powder to deal with the heavier flour mix).  We loved them and will definitely be making them regularly.

I thought these muffins were delicious! I used whole wheat instead of white flour. I only rated them 4 stars b/c of the high fat content. That is disappointing from a healthy muffins (27% of your daily dose of saturated fat in one muffin!). I also thought the buttery taste was quite strong. Next time I will substitute with some apple sauce and I think it will become a 5 stars.

I used diced Granny Smith apple instead of dates, and these were really good muffins!

Yes... these were excellent.  Moist, tasty, and easy to make.  I like the idea of substituting applesauce for part of the butter, and will cook down an apple and try that next time.

This was an awesome recipe.  I've given up processed sugars so I've been trying recipes sweetened with fruit.  The first time I made this, I didn't make any modifications and it was superb.  The second time, I added 1/2 cup of cocoa and baked as a cake since I haven't found an adequate fruit-sweetend chocolate cake recipe.  I also blended the fruit and water until it was a thick paste so that I didn't have bits of fruit all through the cake.  It was pretty good right out of the oven but after sitting for a day, it tasted even more chocolatey and awesome.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe. I am forever cutting the sugar down in recipes. I used 3/4 cups spelt flour and 1/4 cup white flour as the only change. This will be fun to play with, maybe some bran, wheat germ or flax seed ground up??

Love this muffin, though I made a lot of changes.  First of all, I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and make it fresh for myself almost daily.  Yum!  Secondly, since it's summer, I make it in the microwave, and it's come out great.  Also, I used extra prunes instead of dates, since I don't have any.  I replaced a quarter of the flour with whole wheat flour and the butter with grape seed oil to make it healthier.  Yes, I know, a lot of changes, but it's still basically the same recipe and is very delicious.

These muffins are SO TASTY! They are moist and very sweet. I replaced butter with vegan margarine due to lactose intolerance. Even my picky eater, who wouldn't eat anything with raisins ate 3/4 of a muffin. Thanks!

I liked these.  Due to the lack of processed sugar the flavor is slightly more complex.  If you want it sweeter try adding a quarter cup of Agave Nectar.  However, my kids ate them without any added sweetener and approved.

These muffins were very good. I did alter them a bit as I added flax seed and sesame seeds, and I did not add prunes as I did not have any. I was wondering if a person could exchange the butter for apple sauce? I have used applesauce instead of oil and this had worked out fine. This way these muffins could be sugarless and low fat. If not I will still make them again. Thanks

These are so good, and nutritious. Wonderful for diabetics. I have looked everywhere for this recipe, and finely! A cook at our hospital used to make these - 20 years ago. This recipe is the same. She used to make them brownie fashion, in a 9 X13 pan. They were great that way. I took one reviewers suggestion, and used part wheat flour and flax, used 1/2 unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 butter, and increased the baking powder to 1 tsp. They were perfect, and keep nicely.

Absolutely Awesome!!!   These are so moist ... they remind me of Morning Glory Muffins.
I didn't have prunes or raisins, but added dried mixed berries instead.  Also added coconut flakes when I added the nuts.
Will make these again, and again, and again.  
Thank you Lynn!!

Flavorful and quick.  I like making muffins, bread, and desserts with dates and other fruits.  I like that these muffins have no added sugar.

This is my grandchildren's favorite.   Although loaded with natural sugars, I don't have to worry about all that added.  It's becoming a holiday family tradition.

In place of the dates, I used 1/2 prunes and 1/2 figs. Wouldn't do figs again. Didn't like the crunch from the seeds (like Fig Newtons). I know I'd like these better with the dates. It's really not too sweet tasting, although I thought it would be. Also added 1 tblsp flax seed and a few pinches of cinnamon and nutmeg. Did use the optional walnuts and also mixed some of them with brown sugar and cinnamon to top the muffins. Having one right now with some whipped cream cheese and a hot cup of tea. Thanks for the great recipe, Lynn!

I halved the recipe & got 4 jumbo sized muffins.  These are good, but I miss the sugar.  I would make these again but would add a strusel topping to them.
