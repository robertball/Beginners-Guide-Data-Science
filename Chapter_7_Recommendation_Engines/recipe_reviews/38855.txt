This recipe didn't work. The "dough" was too thin to be made into balls with two spoons and when poured onto pan obviously made thin flat cookies. When these were scraped off the pan they tasted bad.

I gave three stars because it was a good starting point for me and it made a small batch. I used 2 T. soft butter creamed with the sugar then added the eggs. Hazelnut meal in place of chopped nuts 1/2 t. baking powder and 1/4 c. mini chips. Dropped cookies on parchment and baked 15 minutes. Got 18 delicious light brown cookies. Next time will cut sugar to 1/3 c. and add 1/2 t. vanilla. I'm always looking for small batch recipes since we are empty nesters. Thanks for the start! Made a second batch cut sugar pecan meal and 1/2 c. chopped pecans in place of hazelnuts/chips plus 1/2 t. vanilla. Just as delicious!

I did make some alterations and it turned out really good... subbed one large banana for the two eggs to make them vegan used walnuts instead of hazelnuts and triple the amount of flour. I baked them for ten minutes and set them to cool on a wire rack. They tasted delicious like banana bread cookies!
