I have been making these since I was a kid.  They are the best.  You can also make them with english muffins.  I still eat them today and I am...well, we won't go there.  But they make a great fast lunch and I almost always have the ing. on hand anyway since we are big pizza eaters.  For a grown up version I add olives, onions and roasted peppers.

This makes for a great Saturday lunch with your kids! My daughter got a kick outta this (but made a mess with the sauce).  I used "pizza cheese," which has cheddar and moz, pre-mixed and spinkled some pizza spices over each one(which can be found next to the pizza sauces at your grocery store).  The spices really convinced me I was eating a pizza and my entire family gave this no-effort lunch two thumbs up.

Better than the frozen kind plus my kids get to make their own.  I think next time I will use a whole grain bagel.  I alway's like to sneak in extra nutrition when I can!  :)

My kids loved these. They were easy and fast to make. To save money I am going to buy the day old bagels to make these. This would be great for a croud of kids. My kid will get this when they don't like what mom and dad are having.

I made these last night for my 5 year old and 2 year old little girls.  They loved them!  The oldest said "This is the bestest pizza I have ever had!"  I used pizza sauce instead of marinara sauce because that is what I had on hand.  So so easy!  This was a big hit with the kids!

I give this recipe 4 stars for its fast and easy steps. I made the mistake of putting the tomato sauce on the bagel before the toppings and they turned out soggy. I will make these again since my husband and son devoured them! Great taste! Good recipe!

Fun to make, easy for the kids-we've made these twice in 2 days. Tastes much better when sprinkled w/Watkins pizza blend. I used mini bagels & baked at 400 for 5-6 min. The bagels crisp up just a little instead of staying soft & chewy at 350!

What a tasty little treat.  I needed to use up some bagels and my kids made these for lunch.  They had such fun making them and even more fun eating them.  I tried one and was surprised to find that I actually liked it.  It's a nice alternative to frozen snacks.

Great taste and easy to make!  The only thing I tried different was using a can of tomato sauce in place of the Di Giorno.  I seasoned the sauce to taste with basil, oregano and the like, while simmering on the stove for about 10 mins.  It may take a little longer, but it’s much cheaper than buying the name-brand pre-made sauce.  One other thing, its definitely not “kids only!”

I like making these when it's cold outside.  One pizza and a big bowl of vegetable soup.  A perfect lunch.

Excellent recipe idea!  Make sure not to let your bagels get older than a day or two - I didn't realize this since I don't eat bagels on a regular basis.  Still managed to salvage the finished product, though.  Yummy!

I pop sliced bagels in the toaster, when done apply the toppings, put them in the micro to heat, and we are good to go.

Made these for lunch today and they were a big hit with my 2 year old! I let him help me put on the cheese and pepperoni, which made my kitchen a huge mess, but we had a blast so it was worth it! I will definately make these again! Thanks for posting :)

These little pizza bagels were great!  Everyone is my house loves pizza, but they don't agree on what kind.  This allows you to make custom pizzas.  The kids loved to "help" make them. I too used pizza sauce since that is what I had on hand.  We will make this again.

These are so good and easy!  They taste a little like french bread pizza.  My 5 year old daughter loved them!  I toasted the bagels first then added the toppings since I thought it would be a little less messy.

This is a fun recipe. My 6 yr. old son loved it. I added a little garlic powder, it was great. It made it more like garlic cheese bread. I will definately make this with my little guy again.
