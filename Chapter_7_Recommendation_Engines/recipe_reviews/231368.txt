YUM. I did add coconut (1 cup) and used butter instead of margarine. They set up better with butter.  (let's face it, everything's better with butter) :)
These are always a hit.

You MUST use STICK BUTTER OR MARGARINE with this recipe and not tub butter.  Only stick butter keeps the cookies firm.  Tub butter is too soft and won't let the cookies set up!  You also need to make sure you boil the mixture for no less than 1 minute until the chocolate mixture has a shiny look to it and not dull.  AND you have to be really quick getting the mix out of the pan and onto the wax paper or else it will start to "set up" on you and will end up breaking apart in the pan.  This is a simple recipe but it does have some quirks that you should be aware of to get them to turn out their best!  I've made these cookies for years and years and can honestly admit that the first time I made them I used tub butter and the "cookies" had to be scraped off the wax paper.  The stick butter not only makes these cookies firm but it also gives them the dense fudge type texture that makes them so delicious.  Waiting for them to completely cool rather than eating them warm also adds to the wonderful taste and texture of this cookie.  I'm not a great chef but I can make these in my sleep and they are wonderful!!!

These remind me of my childhood and it was the one thing we cooked with my dad!! However, our family called them "goat drops".  I know... Disgusting, but we loved them and had no idea Dad meant droppings!  My only recommendation is they are a bit on the sweet side.  Hard to taste the peanut butter.  I halved the sugar and added an extra  1/4 c. of peanut butter. It's perfect for us and like some of the other reviewers said, it's a very forgiving recipe on ingredients!! Thanks for sharing this. My kids love it and we now share a bit more of my history and traditions!

These are the best no bake cookies that I have ever made; they came out perfect and I did not make any changes to the recipe! I will add a few tips:
1: the recipe is forgiving meaning your measurements do not have to be exact 
2: bring the mixture to a boil, stirring very frequently until it boils and then once a rolling boil starts, begin timing 90 seconds.  When you get to 10 seconds remove from heat continuing to stir.
3: stir in the peanut butter until it mixes thoroughly and THEN add the oatmeal in small pirtions stirring thoroughly after each addition.

These turned out great!  My three year old helped make them and there wasnt a lot of exact measuring involved.  This recipe is very forgiving! We were both very impatient for them to cool, so I stuck them in the fridge and they turned out great!

Great recipie! Like the other said, very forgiving. We halved the sugar and used dark chocolate instead of cocoa powder, crunchy peanut butter, butter, almond milk and regular oats instead of quick cooking... Way far off ;) Still turned out amazing! Perfect consistency,  and hard not to eat them all at once!

DO NOT USE MARGARINE. Margarine is only ONE MOLECULE away from PLASTIC and shares 27 INGREDIENTS WITH PAINT. Everything is better with REAL butter. ?

Followed the instructions to a T but after 12 hours the cookies were not setting up. The pan of cookies went in the freezer for 3 hours and I was able to carefully peel one cookie off the parchment paper with success. Will do more research and figure out what needs to be done so this recipe can be more successful.

I will definitely be making these again! Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. Yes, they are very gooey when you first put them on the wax paper, and I was a little worried after reading the reviews of people who said they never set. But after they cooled completely, they held together and weren't crumbly. Just be sure to bring to a rolling boil and then boil for 1 1/2 minutes. I did mine for a little over 1 1/2 minutes just to be sure. Thank you so much for this recipe! Best one I've used so far!

Just made this recipe.  They are rich and chocolaty with a nice hint of peanut butter.  They come together easily and set up quickly.  Will definitely make this again... it will become my go-to no-bake chocolate cookie recipe.

DELICIOUS!! No bake cookies are so easy and they don't make me feel as guilty about eating sweets.  To make this recipe a little healthier I did make a few adjustments BUT I do believe these would've turned out just as good without my changes.  1. I substituted half of the butter for coconut oil. 2. Substituted half of the sugar for light brown sugar (not packed). 3. I used crunchy peanut butter...yum! 4. I put them in the fridge to cool and it took about 30 minutes.  We couldn't wait to eat them and next time I will double the recipe because these are going quickly.  Thank you for posting such a mom-friendly & kid approved recipe!

Flavor and texture are off the charts.  Mine didn't set up well though.  Next time I will try butter instead of margarine and maybe cook the sugar mixture a little longer to see if that helps.  Any other suggestions about getting a good set up with no bakes?  This was my first batch.  Definitely will try it again.

My son and I made these, Very quick, easy, and oh so good. I followed the recipe exactly as written (was a little worried about the amount of sugar). I used Hersey cocoa powder, country crock light and peter pan creamy peanut butter. Creamy, smooth and just the right amount of chocolate to peanut butter taste. When you bring to a boil becareful not to boil over a high heat to avoid scorching your chocolate. I would recommend these to make with kids,to share, or just because.

These are great. I only had tub margarine on hand so I had to boil it for at least 4mins to thicken it up. I spooned them out right away but would let them sit a few minutes next time, the last cookies to be spooned out set much better than the first ones. Definitely make again!

. First of all lined  four baking  sheets with wax paper  ( wasn't sure how  many to line and as turned  out,  took exactly four sheets. Then measured out rest of ingredients as need to be at the "quick" and " "ready".   Next added coco powder,  sugar, 1 stick margarine, and the milk in a medium size sauce pan, stirring pretty much regularly.   Brought mixture to a rolling boil. I  Timed it for exactly 80 seconds and tthen removed from heat(this is where "quick" and "ready" comes into play}After removing from heat stirred  in the  vanilla THEN the peanut butter(until smooth), and  lastly the oats (added1/2 cup extra oats ( 3 !/2 cups total) as appeared too "runny",( you be the judge to  as if  mixture needs more oats) . Mixed  all well and quickly placed on  baking sheets by the tablespoon. Anxious to try so placed one baking sheet in fridge to set , big mistake, cookies spread out way too thin, let remaining cookies (3  baking sheets)set while  on  counter tops. After 55 minutes cookies were set perfectly, Very tasty and a  nice texture. Thanks for  sharing the recipe, JJsma. Excellent, quick and easy, total time from start to  finish  equaled  1 hour  and 14 minutes. Also made  38  small-medium  sized cookies.

These are great no bakes.  I used butter and real vanilla, mainly because I'm a cookie fiend.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

The outcome was too dry for the cookies to hold shape when you dipped them onto the waxed paper.
I have an old cipe that made them perfectly every time. I will be looking for it. These are tasty but the texture is too crumbly and dry.

This is a great recipe that I've made quite a few times for my family.  Do not use tub butter or margarine or you run the risk of the cookies not setting up properly.  While old fashioned stick butter is not the healthiest, this is one of those recipes that comes out best with it in my own experience.

I've made this for years and husband loves them. I use 3-1/3 cups 1 minute oats, dark cocoa and real butter. I make sure they actually boil for the full 90 seconds. I also return the mixture to the lowest stove setting for a minute while stirring after I mix in first the vanilla, then the peanut butter and finally the oats. Putting the waxed paper on an aluminum cookie sheet works best. They are even better if, after cooling, they are stored in a plastic container or plastic bag overnight. I added a cup of dark chocolate chips right before I spooned them onto waxed paper for my most recent batch, and husband loved them

These are a nostalgic pleasure and kids love them.
Four stars because it needs to be noted that a full 2
Minute boil works best, and after the final batter is mixed,
You may need to wait 10 minutes before mounting
the cookies onto parchment or waxed paper. These are a classic.

Used brown sugar, and water instead of milk (I didn't have any), used real butter. I mixed all the ingredients together over medium heat for about 2 minutes then used the pampered chef mini scooper in mini cupcake liners (made 48) tamped down for perfect Valentine snacks.

This is the BEST recipe for no bake cookies, and I wouldn't add, or omit anything. The most important things are you must use unsweetened cocoa powder, don't substitute with semi-sweet chocolate chips, or  your cookies will be to sweet, and you have to bring the sugar, milk, and butter to a full boil, and boil for AT LEAST one minute, because you want all the granules of sugar dissolved, or your cookies will be gritty.

This is a great recipe and was just what I wanted to find, but I did make some changes.  First, I used butter instead of margarine.  Second, I replaced half a cup of the oats with hemp seeds (ie. 2 1/2 cups oats, 1/2 cup hemp seeds).  Third, I added a bit of Pink Himalayan Salt to the oats/hemp mixture.  The end result was delicious.  It set up perfectly, too!  

However, I added a bit too much salt.  I already have some oats/hemp/salt pre-mixed and I only added a pinch of salt. 
Also, I will experiment again and add about 1/4 cup of flax seed to the dry ingredients.  It was very easy to stir 3 cups of dry ingredients into the "syrup," so  I don't think 1/4 cup of extra dry ingredients will be a problem.

The trick to get these to set up is stick butter and MUST be a rolling boil for 90 sec. I used 2 1/4 cups of oatmeal instead of 3.  Great recipe.

They didn't set at all. Just a gooey mess, not anything like what I was hoping for.

Surprisingly delicious! I was looking for a quick, egg-less cookie recipe. This did the trick. Was a hit with the hubby!

Instead of margerine I used butter and instead of creamy peanut butter I used super chunky these are so easy to make and they're so good I'll do them over and over again

My 18 yr. old made these with stick butter.  we saw that they were soft ,so added about 3/4c. more  of oats while still in the pot...Still came out too soft and didn't set up after an hour; however, I did see that  1 person suggested Freezing them for a short time.  Presto.  It did yield 24 cookies.

I have a poor success rate getting no bake cookies to set up. These were perfect. I did use regular oats and they are a bit chewier. Prefer to use quick oats.

I haven't had these in years. I made these tonight, mind you, this is the first time I've made these and they turned out just as I remembered. However, I used diluted canned milk instead of regular milk and they didn't taste any different. This is definitely a recipe I will keep

On a hint from a friend, I used 1 cup of peanut butter (instead of 1/2 cup) and an add'l  3/4 cup of oatmeal... just seems to make a creamier cookie.

I substituted butter for margarine but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The first batch never solidified but stayed gooey and creamy. The taste was great but it wasn't a success. The second batch I boiled for 2 minutes and the results were much MUCH better but again...barely solid, but at least they could be picked up and eaten like a cookie. I tried a third batch with margarine and exact to directions...gooey and creamy with no solidity even after three hours. I won't use this particular recipe again.

I didn't have enough butter so I used coconut oil. I also only had crunchy peanut butter. Turned out as good as mom's. Handled my chocolate craving very well.

They were a little sweet, but simple. I would make them again and leave out some of the sugar.

I think I'll use butter next time. Mine didn't quite solidify, they were very soft. Needed a spoon to eat these, too soft to hold in my hand without melting. Tasted great though!

I rated this 4 stars the day I made it, but revised to 5 stars after they had sat overnight.  Very easy to make, and as others said, a flexible recipe.  Good one to make with children.

Delicious! I have already sent this recipe to two friends who made them and loved them as well.
