This humble salad brought back such memories, all of them wonderful and pleasant, of dinners at my Italian grandmother's table. This, to me, was the ultimate comfort food. All the ingredients blend together deliciously to create a taste sensation. Perfect with the arugula, but this could also be tossed with some rigatoni or penne pasta. This is also good enough to eat on its own with a crusty slice of Italian bread for a simple, light, but satisfying meal. I used all fresh herbs from my garden, and beautiful, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano. Thank you, kimscookingnow, for the delicious memories. I have to say that of the 700+ recipes I've tried from this site, this is by far one of the more memorable.  And for what it's worth, my German hubby raved about this too!

This is a great recipe, so I just had to share it.  It tastes great and is healthy at the same time.  We are trying to get more legumes in our diet, and this recipe makes that easier.  Makes an excellent side dish to any grilled meat.  I hope others will enjoy!

This is delicious.  I had some beautiful arugula and started searching for recipes.  Thank goodness I found this.  Hubby is a vegetarian, so I sometimes struggle for new recipes.  I made this one exactly as printed, but added a little onion with the garlic.  The wine, garlic and tomatoes are a lovely counterpoint to the spicy arugula.  I think the cheese is a must.  =)  Thanks, Kim!

Outstanding recipe.  I substituted raspberry vinegar for the white wine.  I also garnished the entire salad with some chopped up fresh garlic tops before adding the cheese and then drizzled it with some olive oil and raspberry vinegar.  A big hit in this Italian home.

This was SO GOOD!  I had some arugula left to use up and stumbled across this one - very earthy and full of flavour, and came together very quickly, another bonus.  Thanks for sharing...we really enjoyed this dish :)

Finally something to do with cannellini beans instead of the Ribollita! I used spinach instead of rucola and also cooked it in with the beans for a nice side dish. Didn't have any canned tomatoes (gasp, I know, no Italian home should be without them. Don't tell anyone) so I used fresh tomatoes and it was still very nice just less "saucy" than I think it should have been. Thank you Kim's Cooking Now! for your recipe.

We were both shocked at how good this was. I do love arugula and I used white wine vinegar instead. Used fresh agugula, tomatoes and basil from the garden. Excellent!

Paired it with grilled veal.  Added a 1/4 teaspoon of finely chopped red chili pepper.

Wonderful side dish, something different besides the usual sides. It's nice to see a new recipe for Arugula too!

This is very tasty and healthy.  I added a couple of cups of cooked penne pasta, it makes a great vegetarian meal.

I love arugula and I love beans so I thought I would love this.  I even added extra garlic because as far as I'm concerned you can never have enough but this dish just didn't do it for me.

Seemed to be lacking something. I think mixing the arugula in rather than setting the beans /tomatoes on top would be preferable. I may add bacon or something else with a little different texture next time.
