Okay, I changed this quite a bit but I give it 5 for the base and the ability to play with this dish - also the simplicity. I used ground turkey, I pan fried with onions and garlic, added cumin, chili powder, chipotle chili powder, and paprika. I added 1.25 cups of rice, 1/2 cup tomato sauce, 2.5 cups of water with 2 chicken bouillons mixed in. I also added black beans, Mexican red beans and corn - brought to a boil, then covered and turned down to low for 25 minutes. Served with shredded cheese and sour cream - LOVED IT. If you want it spicy add cayenne or hot sauce before simmering.. YUM.

This was great! I did, however, do a few changes. I seasoned the beef and the onions while cooking them with garlic salt and paprika. I also used 8oz of salsa instead of 8oz of tomato sauce because I did not have any tomato sauce on hand. The end result - DELICIOUS! Other reviewers have stated that the recipe tasted too much like chili powder, but mine was just right!

This is a good base recipe, but for us it just needs some more spices.  I think I would add a couple of garlic cloves and some red pepper flakes.  I also thought that using a medium taco sauce instead of plain tomato sauce would probably be good.

This is simple yet tasty.  Instead of the spices I substituted a packet of taco seasoning. I also added a can of diced tomatoes.  I had to cook this for twice as long as the reciped stated, so the rice was not crunchy.

I was the only person at our dinner table to eat this, I think the amount of chili powder was a turn off...probably because we aren't used to it. I may try it again and skip it, however preparing recipe as is, I would rate a 3. THANK YOU FOR SHARING.

Used this recipe for years. I have a family of 6 and a full time job so on nights when I don't have anything ready this is always perfect.  It's fast and the kids love it.

I made the recommendations from others (used fresh minced garlic, added cumin and paprika to the meat while cooking, used both diced tomatoes and tomato paste vs sauce, and brown rice vs white). I had to cook the whole dish for 40 mins. The end result was a very happy husband and a very picky toddler who both devoured it!

I thought it was good I had to use tomato paste so of course more water was needed... I made this before as is and was happy this time around I used paste again, but didn't do the broth and used ground turkey... Yummmy, Next will try something else or even one of the changes made by others but either way was very happy...

The family really enjoyed this, even my pickiest eaters.  An adaptable recipe..I didn't have 14 oz of beef broth, so I used what I had - about 8 oz, and increased the tomato sauce to 15 oz.   I also added some chopped tomato for texture.  Easy supper!

Changed a lot, but liked the basic recipe. Ended up using the rice/bean/tomato sauce/ground beef mushy mixture to fill burritos (seasoned with chili powder, a little red pepper, salt and cumin). Also put fresh spinach, cheese, sour cream and a dollop of salsa on the burritos and it they were delicious. Thanks for the base recipe. A nice way to combine and use the left over beans, rice and tomato sauce I had in the fridge.

I was a bit disappointed in this. It's a good base recipe but it just seems to need something; bland. I'll make it again but would use diced tomatoes with chili peppers and other spices. This might be a good recipe for a family with very young children.

I have never made this kind of dish before, but it is better than I expected. I used a 1lb 92 percent  ground beef,  I substitute chicken broth cube (2 in 2 cups of water), salsa instead of tomato sauce and 1/4 tsp 0f chayenne instead of chili powder( i dont like very spicy food) I think it was perfect to my taste, really good! Thanks.

This is a decent recipe. I must apologize to Campbell's because I used homemade beef broth leftover from making "Pepperoncini Beef" from this site. It was pretty bland, as written, which I figured it would be looking at the ingredients, so I adjusted to our tastes. I used brown rice instead of white rice, got bored waiting for it to finish cooking, and poured it all into a pyrex baking dish and baked it, covered in foil, for awhile at 300 degrees but I have no idea how long I had been simmering it when I got bored and did that. I do think this recipe would be MUCH improved if I had taken the reviewer's suggestion to use salsa instead of tomato sauce & I will do that next time. Thanks for the recipe! (Served with "Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad" & toppings of shredded pepper jack & hot sauce.)

Very good.  I did add cheddar cheese and cooked it in the oven for 30 minutes after cooking the rice in the beef broth/tomato sauce (beef mixture was placed in casserole dish first).  My son loved it.  This is a keeper.  Quick, easy and tasty.

I doctored this a bit...used stewed tomatoes, fresh garlic, some cumin, and only about 1tsp of chili powder.  Served with peas that were great just mixed right in along with tortilla chips on the side.  Family liked it and it was super easy!

Boring!  Simple is the word another reviewer used and that it is.  However, there is very little flavor in my opinion.  Won't make again.

YUM! I used veggie broth because that's what I had on hand and also added a teaspoon each of paprika and cumin. Salt and pepper to taste. Topped with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese and plain Greek yogurt. Delicious AND easy!

Love it.  Added fire-roasted stewed tomatoes and salsa, instead of the tomato sauce and chili powder respectively.  Excellent flavor.

There are so many things you can do with this recipe!  I used half chorizo and half ground beef. Roasted red peppers and only tsp of the chili powder and 1/4 tsp of cumin. It was delicious! Next time I might even take the chili powder down to 1 tsp. It is a bit overpowering but all in all it's a great base recipe.

Cut way back on the sauce, and used sausage instead of ground beef. I put a squirt of lime juice in mine. My hubs really liked it and he doesn't like rice or peppers!

While very good, I did alter this recipe. I used a small amount of cumin, italian seasoning, and ground pepper. The chili powder that I used was a more spicy version which added good flavor. I also added cheddar cheese at the end! Will make this again as it was pretty quick for a weeknight dinner.

Made this for my husband, who loves Spanish/Mexican food, and he loved it. The only change I made was that I used a full pound of ground turkey, put in about 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic salt both while cooking the meat and when making the sauce, and I used 1/2 a package of taco seasoning in place of the chili powder/garlic powder. The only thing I would do differently is to fry the rice before adding it to the broth mixture to help the rice cook faster.

This was a great quick and easy recipe!  My son couldn't get enough.  I did add some ingredients. I used a can of stewed tomatoes (I did not have any sauce).  I added 1 tsp of cumin, papika, 2 tbsp of Worcestershire, can of corn, can of Rotel and topped it off with some cheese.  We will be eating this again in our house.

This was flavourful, simple, and easy! I didn't have chili powder but made my own (equal parts cayenne pepper, ground cumin, oregano, and garlic powder), and I used 2 cloves minced fresh garlic instead of the 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I also used 1 tsp of the spices in cooking the beef, and added 1/2 an orange bell pepper in addition to the green pepper. The texture was a bit mushy, but that was mostly my fault (instead of long-grain I used short-grain rice, which normally requires less liquid). Next time I will reduce the amount of broth, and I will try leaving the green pepper raw and mixing it in at the end.

I liked this recipe, but added a lot of spices and some garlic. I would probably cut back on the chili powder and add a little more rice in the future. Overall, a quick and simple recipe.

My family loves this recipe..the second time I made it, I changed it to 12 servings..the left overs are gobbled up with the next couple of days..the left overs did taste better so next time I am going to prepare the night before and let sit in the fridge for a day. I added some red pepper, corn and crushed red pepper and about 5-6 drops of hot sauce and cut back on the chili powder...we like spicier food.  I love this recipe and will be making it again!

Yummy! I followed the tips, I added paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, chili powder, salt and black pepper.  I also used 6 oz tomato paste sauce, 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 1 1/4 cup of rice.
