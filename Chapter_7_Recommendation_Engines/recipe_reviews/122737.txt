Very good & easy. To make it prettier, pick the cherries out of the pie filling, using no more of the goop than clings to the cherries. Try mixing the goop with powdered sugar & drizzling on the finished rolls, or save the goop to use as a light jam on toast.

BETTER than store bought!  I did not use the egg on the inside or out. In place of cherry pie filling,  I used seedless raspberry jam in 3 crescents, and apricot preserves in the other 3. I baked at 325 for 14 minutes.  Next time I make these, I will spread the cream cheese down the entire length (excluding the tip) of the crescent.  The ratio to filling and dough will be more equal.  My kids loved these!!!  Easy to make and could use other jams/jellies for the filling.

I made this for my sons school picnic.  However, instead of making indivisual crescents, I took one can of cresents and pressed it into the bottom of a 9x13 lightly greased pan.  I then layered the cream cheese mix, cherry pie filling.  I took the other can of cresents, flattened them out, cut them into strips, and placed them in a crisscross pattern over top.  I brushed the egg whites over the top.  I needed to cook it longer, about 25 minutes.  I just kept checking on it.  I cooled them, cut them in bars, and topped with powdered sugar.  I put them in the fridge to chill.   They turned out nicely.

I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, reduced fat crescent rollw, and sugar-free pie filling.  These were a big hit and very easy to make.  There was probably enough filling left over for me to use another can of crescent rolls.  I will definitely make these again soon!

Tasted great but I had a problem with the filling leaking out all over so they didn't look so great.

This was great for a quick dessert at the last minute and cleared out a package of cherries from my deep freeze. I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat crescent rolls and I made my own cherry pie filling from frozen organic cherries, sugar, cornstarch, water, a little lemon juice and a touch of pure vanilla extract. I only made half the recipe tonight, but stuck the other half of cherry pie filling and filling ingredients in tupperware containers for tomorrow. I bet this would be good with almost any filling you have on hand.

Very good.  The whole family loved them.  If you can get them to look pretty, that's a plus, but they're good anyway!

I love this recipe. I actually got it from Taste of Home Magazine years ago. I don't use the egg and I have used different fruit pie fillings as well as chocolate chips too. Everyone loves them, they are always a hit and an absolute MUST at every Holiday gathering.

Always a hit, but much better after chilled and eaten later or even the next day.

These were great and so simple.  I also left out the egg though.  I added a few white chocolate chips to the cherries, though they didnt melt all the way, we still loved it.  I also made some with apple pie filling and added carmel bits.  They didnt quite melt all the way either though it was still good.  Maybe add a dollop of caramel ice cream sauce instead.  Great easy recipe, Thanks!

Yum! Yum! And double Yum! I halved this recipe, still using one egg, and they turned out soooo good! Mine don't look quite as pretty but you should definitely give these a try!

These are good. I have been looking for this recipe for over a yr. I first had it from Pampered Chef as a braide. Much easier than making the crescents. Thnaks for posting.

Even using another reviewers tip to pick out the cherries & only use as much goop as sticks to the cherries, my filling still baked right out.  It's a quick, easy, & yummy recipe.  I like that there are only a few "on hand" ingredients that have the reduced fat option.
