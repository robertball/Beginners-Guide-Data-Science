I made this cake for my daughters birthday and it turned out wonderful.  You get the best of both worlds with cheese cake and white cake.  One thing I did wrong though was I did not whip the whipping cream long enough, so the cheese cake topping was runny, but it set up well in the fridge.

This recipe is better just put into one 9 x 13 cake pan, it makes a denser cake that way.

Good cake but not at all what I was expecting. It really shouldn't be called a cheese cake. That part of the cake was more like an icing. To make a true cheese cake, I would suggest 2 packages of cream cheese, 2 eggs, 1 cup of sugar, and 2 tbls of vanilla extract.
