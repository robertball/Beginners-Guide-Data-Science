My husband is a chicken wing fanatic and he did not like the taste of these.  I think these wings would be better withou the powder garlic.

I thought these were pretty good.  I only used tomato based hot sauce and I added minced garlic and they were not incredible, but good.  They weren't spicy enough for my husband, so I added cayenne and tabasco to the sauce, which "kicked it up a notch"!  I'll probably try them again.

Hot, hot, hot? Not, Not, Not. When I say "hot wings," I expect them to have more of a flavor kick. We'll try something else next time.

I have a secret wing recipe that I made, very similar to this one.  I'm surprised the reviews aren't higher, mine are touted best in the land and people beg for my recipe, but I won't give it up!  Maybe they are using the wrong sauce.  I use Frank's (or any Louisiana hot sauce) and Tabasco to add more heat.  Hope that helps!

So, I chose to bake these wings instead of using a grill. I baked the wings for 20 minutes. I only had the garlic power, 1.5 cups of butters, hot sauce, and the pepper vinegar sauce on for the first 20 minutes. After those 20 minutes were up, I took the wings out and added more hot sauce, and the parmesan cheese. I then put the wings into the oven for 25 minutes. Before serving, I added lots of paprika, and about 2 tsp of seasoning salt, and a little more vinegar pepper sauce. Yummy!

Oh my god, the Parmesan cheese is an amazing.  Gives it a great flavor and the sauce sticks to the wings.  Awesome recipe.  I have add chipolata sauce for an extra kick and grilled the wings twice. yum
