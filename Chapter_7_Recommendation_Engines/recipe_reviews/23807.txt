This is a very common cake here in Norway - you get them in all bakeries. Skolebr√∏d really means "school bread". I have no idea why it's called that as kids aren't allowed to eat such sweets at school. However, there's a major difference between how we make them compared to the recipe:  Here we add the thick vanilla custard before we bake them, not after. After you've rolled the buns, let them rise - then you can easily make quite a big dent in each bun. Fill with the custard, but not to much or it will run over the sides of the bun and make a mess. Don't worry though, if you're like me and like a lot of filling. The custard will puff and fill more than you think. After the skolebrods are baked, chill them somewhat,  put on icing (powdered sugar + egg whites) and dip in shredded coconut. Yummy :-)

I love this recipe, I've made it several times now, and it is always a hit at Christmas. I fill mine with vanilla pudding. The only thing I have changed is that I set the oven to 375 degrees, not 475 degrees. At the higher temperature the bottoms of the rolls burned.

Delicious!  A very straight forward recipe that was easy to follow.  A bit of effort, but worth it.  I married into a Norwegian family and since have tried to learn a little norwegian cooking.  I love the use of cardamom.

I did not care for this recipe. These rolls are hard- tough almost.  100% whole wheat flour is probably the reason.  There is no way you can fill them with pastry cream- the best you can do is top them with it.  My one deviation from the recipe was to dip them in a powdered sugar glaze, then unsweetened coconut before attempting the pastry cream "filling" (which by the way, is very good- I had no issues with the recipe for pastry cream.)I had seen this glaze/coconut in every other online recipe for skolebrod.  While the toppings I added and the cream were good, the roll underneath was so dry, so unflavorful (even with the cardamon-which I love) that there is no way I would ever attempt this recipe again.  Too expensive- too time consuming, and now I am left with 22 rolls no one will eat.

I lived in Norway for a while and absolutely adored these buns. your dough is excellent. The ones I encountered had the cream in a depression in the center. The rest of the top was glazed and covered in shreaded coconut, making the whole thing resemble a puffy fried egg!

I made this recipe as written, and while the result was OK... the bottoms of the breads were overcooked, and it was all together more 'bready' than it should be. 

I made a second batch with modifications, and it got rave reviews from my dinner guests and office the next day.

(I resubmitted my version with modifications to allrecipes, and perhaps it will be published.)
