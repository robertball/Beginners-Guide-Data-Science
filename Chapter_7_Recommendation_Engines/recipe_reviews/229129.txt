This was a great base recipe to go from. I sprinkled my veal with italian bread crumbs and browned it in olive oil. Then added 1 1/4 cups of marsala wine and a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano. Let that cook on med-low, then added fresh baby spinach. Let simmer to just wilt the spinach and dish out to plate. Top with sliced provolone cheese. Let stand for 2 minutes to allow cheese to soften and slightly melt...serve!!

This was very expensive and lacking in flavour!!  I was most disappointed in this recipe.  I had cooked it for a special occasion i.e. my son's birthday and his wife's 40th birthday.  Nobody liked it.

I modified it for 2 servings (4oz each) using scallopini and not cutlets.  Sauteed the veal under 30 secs per side and put it in a small roasting pan.  Deglazed the skillet with marsala while tossing in the tomato, basil, and garlic for less than a minute.  Poured that over the veal and added the parmesan.  Under the broiler for 2 minutes and done.

I've made this 3 times now the first as written, which was edible, but not IMO the best showcase for the veal.  The second time I used pork cutlets because veal is too expensive to use in an experiment.  It worked well with my changes so I made it again with veal.  I season my flour with white pepper, rubbed sage, and garlic powder.  I switched to dry white wine and cut it back to 1/4 cup so the veal doesn't stew in the oven and honestly, I think it would be just as good without it.  Ryan, your instincts were good and I hope you aren't offended by my changes.

We thought this was very good! For the coating I used a brown rice breading in place of the flour for my husband's gluten intolerance.  It gave a good flavor.  Then instead of veal we used pork which was already specially cut just for scallopini from the store where we buy our meat. I know we will make this again.

I put cooked veal in baking dish and de-glazed pan with wine then added tomatoes and reduced a little. Brought out the flavors very delicious! Served over angel hair pasta.

A great recipe for Veal.  I also deglazed pan and mixed spices , tomatoes, and wine together to blend ingredients and then poured over veal.  I will cut back on the wine next time---a bit overpowering the other ingredients.

Made this fairly close to the recipe, except that I used a red Zinfandel instead of Marsala wine and didn't have fresh basil, so used the one in the tube. Added some mozzarella on top in last few minutes and served with pasta/sauce/grilled vegetables. Will make this again...got a "keeper" review from my husband.

Quick and easy, yet delicious dish. I added garlic and onion powder, and salt and pepper to the flour before dredging the veal. I also deglazed the pan with the marsala and tomatoes before pouring it over the veal in the oven safe pan. The veal came out very tender and flavorful. Mellow flavor, not too spicy. I served it over a bed of spaghetti in a pink vodka sauce.
