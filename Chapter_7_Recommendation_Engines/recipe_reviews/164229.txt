LOVE these things! The only change I made was to leave out the nuts, as I'm not a fan. They do stick, so I used a non-stick pan sprayed with cooking spray, came right out with no problem.

So very easy, and so very yummy.  I sent them out for Mother's Day.  My Mom and Sis loved them.  I told them to heat them up in the microwave for a few seconds before eating since they were oh so gooey good when they came out.

I really enjoy this recipe because you can switch it up to suit your personal tastes. I omitted the walnuts because I'm allergic and I didn't have any coconut, so I used a combination of peanut butter chips, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips with the sweetened condensed milk. I ate almost the entire pan and my best friend requested the recipe. Needless to say, these are versatile and terrific squares. Thanks!

These are so good.  My grandmother has this exact recipe and we have been making it for years.  It is fun to experiment with the new flavored chips you find at the grocery store, like peanut butter, mint or cherry.

This is the same as my mother's recipe, except we add the walnuts before the coconut.  Then we drizzle the sweeten condensed milk over the coconut.  I just wanted to check a recipe on ALLRECIPES for the cooking temp, etc. It came out perfectly! My husband remembers his mother making theses when he was a kid.  (He is 76 years old.) So I guess this recipe has been around awhile.

I remembered these from childhood. I'm allergic to coconut but just leaving it out is the solution.  We also used peanuts sometimes.  Thanks for sharing it.

I loved it! And i will totally make it again! I did make a change and it was still good, i put two cups of chocolate chips instead of one cup of butterscotch and one cup of chocolate.

I have also made these squares for years, as did my mother & grandmother - and they are delicious!  I usually make it at Christmastime now, as part of my Christmas baking trays that I give to friends as gifts.  I don't use walnuts myself, as I don't like the bitterness of walnuts, but I use sliced or slivered almonds on the top instead.  They are always delicious & freeze well too.  Nice to have on hand if unexpected company drops by.

This is a nice variation on the magic layer bars.  I still prefer the original recipe, but this is still very good  but sweeter than we like.
