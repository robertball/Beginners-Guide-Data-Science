Tasted great! Husband and kids LOVED it! Will make again!!! I didnt make the gravy part though, I needed to use a packet of gravy that has been sitting in my cupboard. Also, I substituted canola oil for the lard with no problems. 

I do have to add, I agree with MBUENZLI's review- Country Fried Steak is not supposed to be exploding with flavor. And for anyone having problems with the batter falling off the meat when you fry, make sure your oil is heated enough before adding the meat. I do this by dropping a pinch of flour into the oil. If it bubbles like crazy, its ready!

I have never used a "recipe" for this dish in my life, as I learned to cook in my g'ma's Southern kitchen, but this is how I have always done it!

One change I did make from Mamaw's gravy was to use half milk and half chicken broth.  It won't taste like chicken gravy but it will have a bit more richness.  This is the only way I make milk or cream gravy anymore.

Another reviewer said to make sure your grease is hot enough and that is wonderful advice.  Frying at too low a temp is a common error.

I was soooo happy with this recipe.  I did change it a little but it was delicous.. I browned the meat in 1 stick of margarine and 2 tablespoons of Extra virgin olive oil instead of Lard.  I also cooked it a little longer than what called for so coating was crispier.  The gravy was scrumptious and my boyfriend said he would love for me to make this again.. thans for the recipe

I made this for dinner a few nights ago and we thought it was pretty darn good. It was my first attempt at country fried steak and I think I did a pretty good job, even though I did change the recipe a little bit.  I used buttermilk and one egg and I seasoned the flour more than the recipe called for (with garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika).  After dredging in the milk and flour, I let the steaks sit for about 20 minutes, then I heated canola oil (instead of lard) to cook the steaks in (I also used a cast iron skillet).  The only other change I made was to the gravy.  I doubled the sauce for starters...here's what I did.  After frying the steak, I poured the oil out of the pan, but reserved 1/4 cup and added it back to the pan.  I then whisked in 4 Tbsp of the flour which I'd used for dredging - cooked that a little to cook out the "floury" taste.  Then I added 1 cup of 1% milk and 1 cup of whole milk, then I seasoned with about 1 Tbsp of fresh crushed peppercorns and about 1/2 - 1 tsp of salt.  I think the amount of peppercorns was a bit too much, (I would use probably 2 tsp next time).  It was still very good and I will likely make this dish again. The gravy was fantastic and I intend to make it for fried chicken as well.

Very good comfort-style food.  Fried steak in butter,  seasoned (simple salt and pepper with a touch of paprika) coating was nice and crusty and I had no problem with it adhering.  Doubled the sauce.  Removed steak from the pan onto a warmed plate, added a gob of butter, melted, and an equal amount of flour. Whisked flour into butter to cook out the raw flour taste, (a couple of minutes) and SLOWLY add the milk.  Flour will seize into an unappetizing ball, but don't despair.  Keep whisking and slowly adding milk and eventually the mass will soften and loosen to a wonderful gravy. By doing it this way you'll have a gravy that's thickened to your preference. Salt & pepper to taste.

This is a family favorite. Lots of pepper is a MUST! I do sometimes add 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of garlic powder or sometimes a little minced garlic (my Mom's secret ;)) and ALWAYS double the gravy as we like lots of gravy for both the top of the meat and for mashed potatoes. Also fantastic over plain sliced bread too! A real southern cookin' favorite. I always use my cast iron skillet for this dish, it just seems to taste better and always come out perfect that way for some reason.
For those who can't get the batter to stick, the cooking oil must be HOT when you add the piece of breaded meat.

Very easy and delicious.  Instead of making the gravy, I used McCormick Country Gravy mix and added a little pepper.  It was great.

Great recipe.  It's kinda common sense...but I couldn't find a recipe for country fried steak in any of my recipe books.  I used venison cubed steak and the flavor was tremendous.  Thanks for the life saver!

M 12-y-o daughter's favorite!  Cube steak can be chewy so have the butcher at the grocery store run it through the tenderizer a 2nd time for you ... it does make a difference.  And since my family is from the south, I grew up with this recipe save one modification: my mom fried it in bacon drippings, a little more flavorful than lard.

This is a classic recipe, try this though:  I have cooked this dish all of my life and mine rocks big time.  So does this recipe, but here are ways to make this a bit simpler.  First, ditch the eggs, you do not need them, and nor do you need to dredge the steaks in flour 2x's.  Salt and pepper your steaks (thinner the better when buying) and dredge them in flour once.  Wait for oil (crisco, veg, canola, peanut...peanut fries the best) to get hot, cook on 6, or just over the half way mark on your stove.  Cook on high, burn your oil.  If the oil starts smoking, your burning it.  Burned oil will make your food taste discusting, if you are burning, turn pot off, pour off oil, wash, start over.  Cook steaks as directed (can also be a great recipe for fried chicken).  This gravy aka sawmill gravy, or country or milk gravy, is an art.  You kinda have to hold your mouth right, and there are no true measurements.  If you think the gravy is bland, add salt and pepper.  Do not cook this recipe and try and be healthy about it, this is a backwoods, southern, fattening, comfort meal!  Add lots of salt!  Eat with mashed potatoes!  This is not for you if you are on a diet or are even watching your weight.  And cook more than 4 pieces if you are going to go through all the trouble.

Likestocook, you've just reaffirmed that "simple" is often the best - thanks for this recipe! Had the crust been about twice as thick and a little crispier, it would have been 5-star material for sure. (Yhe lard was good and hot and the steaks were done just as the coating started to brown, so the lack of crispiness wasn't due to cold lard.) The amount of gravy was fine for the steaks, but I had to double it to have enough for the steaks and the veggies, too. All in all, a good, easy and tasty recipe.

Tasted good with minor additions.  Added garlic powder and paprika to the flour mixture.  Used canola oil in place of lard.  I also let my steaks sit for about 10 minutes before frying to try and keep the breading on.  My family really liked the gravy, especially with mashed potatoes.  Some of my steaks were a little tough, so next time I will cook them in the crockpot.

Delicious!! I tried making Country Fried Steak many times in the past using different recipes and it never came out good so I figured I'd give up till I seen this recipe and tried it. My whole family loved it! It was a bit too peppery for us, but, I will definately make it again using less pepper. I also used shortening instead of lard. The breading was nice and crisp and didn't stick to my pan.(Note: be sure to use a cast iron fry pan for best results). Also don't overcook the gravy or it will get too thick, if this happens, add extra milk to thin it out.

I liked this recipe very much...the breading on the steak made a crispy, thick & tasty coating. The gravy was good too; I would cut back on the pepper a bit, but it was still tasty. A good, down-home meal.

A heavy meal, but very tasty. One trick my mom taught me was to put the steaks, after you've fried them, in a covered casserole dish in the oven at 300 or so while you finish up the rest of dinner. It makes the breading not quite as crispy, but it keeps the steaks warm and it makes the meat more tender.

I'm from the south and this recipe is about as authentic as they come.  It was easy, the gravy was thick and peppery with a wonderful taste.  My daughter loved it!  I'll definetely be making this one again.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Great recipe, but this is the recipe for chicken fried steak not country fried steak. Chicken fried steak is southwestern. Country fried steak is southern. The big difference is that country fried steak is cooked along with the gravy.

I used 2 TBL butter and 1TBL canola oil instead of lard, plus lots more pepper - we like it spicy.  It was excellent- I made it without changes the first time and this way was just a bit better.

YUM!! This was my first real success when it comes to frying meat. I've tried to make this on my own before with no luck. I think the one thing that really made a huge difference for me was that in another CFS recipe I read to make sure to have your oil or lard at 365 degrees. So I made sure to have it hot enough and had no problem at all with getting the breading to stick.   The only changes I made were using "minute steak" which I believe is just way tenderized cube steak anyway. I also used oil instead of lard. As far as seasonings I added lawry's and that's it besides the S&P.   I dreged the meat in flour the first time and let it sit in the fridge while  for about 15 minutes, then I went ahead and followed the rest of the recipe.  Let me tell you I was actually giddy when I put this meat onto the plate because it looked so awesome. I kept thinking since it looked so perfect it would probably taste bad but not so,it tasted as good as it looked. The gravy even turned out too. I would have preferred to have the regular white country type of gravy that you get at a restaurant but this tasted good still. I guess it just would've looked even nicer with the whiter gravy instead of a more brown color. That's really nothing to complain about though because this was so good.  When I took it to the table my three year old exclaimed "It looks like truck stop meat!" Believe it or not I took that as a compliment because it really did look like restaurant food and tasted even better!

I make this sometimes using pork sirloin and it's incredible but either beef or pork I use about a 6 oz cut of meat which I pound and tenderize, this makes for a big satisfying steak. Instead of plain lard I use bacon fat, always have always will. You can season the meat and dredge with whatever you like in the way of spices. I keep mine fairly simple. Salt, lots of black pepper a bit of garlic powder, onion powder and fresh thyme leaves to taste added to the gravy. Like another reviewer stated, I triple the amount of gravy because we have mashed potatoes and biscuits with ours and we like a lot of gravy. Before adding the flour to the fat in the pan I add some minced fresh onion and saute for a minute or so. Some people complained that it was not health food. It's not supposed to be, it's supposed to good down home comforting country cooking which it is. I don't make this weekly but we have it several times during the year and company and family love it. It's ok to treat yourself to an indulgence once in a while.

Super delicious! Very simple recipe but maybe that is what makes it so great! I would definitely suggest to chill the steaks, after coating, for about 1-2 hours to let the coating stick. Otherwise, they seem to just fall apart.

this recipe is awesome. Much loved by my entire family of 6 (I'm the only female lol).  I couldn't find cube steak at the market when I decided to make it so used some cuts of round steak.  Still was great.  I spiced up the coating with a the salt & pepper but added some garlic and chives from my garden.  Served with garlic mushrooms and cream cheese & onion mashed potatoes.    Very good!!

Very very good and simplistic recipe for cube steak. I have to admit that I was a little worried about the taste of them from the cook's picture though....

Loved this.  As an admitted non-fryer, even I didn't mess this up!  I've experimented with several different techniques and found that seasoning the meat first, then dredging in the seasoned flour makes for a very flavorful bite!  I season the meat with my "house seasoning" which is salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Then, season the flour as the recipe states.  Also, the reviewer that recommended butter instead of lard was spot on!  This is indulgent comfort food at its finest!

I make this recipe at home only I add poultry seasoning to the flour for a more "chicken fried steak" flavor.  I use bacon fat for the gravy instead of lard this brings out the flavor of the steak.

Absolutely delicious and very filling!  My husband is from the south and he told me the gravy was just like his dad used to make (which I've never been successful at making homemade gravy before).  There were no leftovers!!

Nine times out of ten simple is better. This isn't unnecessarily complicated like so many other recipes and it tastes every bit as good. I don't understand the people who are saying the gravy is difficult and takes a long time. I didn't think it was any different than any other gravy, it was done in five minutes. I did fry it in olive oil and butter because I don't like lard. Tips for keeping the batter on: Let the meat sit until it's not very cold. Let it sit for a few minutes after the first time in the flour. Let it sit for a few more minutes while your oil heats. The MOST important factors are: 1. Your oil needs to be HOT, really, really hot. 2. Leave it be. Set the meat in the oil, set a timer, and don't bother it. If you're picking it up over and over, the batter will fall off. Very good, will make again.

What I have done to keep my seasoned flour on the steak is after  I dredge the meat through the flour mixture (I use  Kentucky Kernel instead of flour) I then let it set for a few minutes~about 5, before placing it in a HOT pan. his way the flour is well adhered to the meat and stays put.

I looked this up because it had been so long since I made this dish.  I loved it in college and my family loves it now.  The only change I made was that I caramelized onions in the oil before frying the meat. Then I put the meat in to fry and finish cooking.  I turn down the heat, put the onions on the bottom, then put the meat on top.  I make the gravy and pour it over all and simmer it until it is tender enough to cut with a fork. I remove the onions before serving.

This was a very good recipe.  The only changes I made were to use canola oil instead of lard (which I don't keep in the house) and to use my electric skillet set to 340 instead of cast iron.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Will definitely make again.

This was really, really good.  I could only rate it a 4 because I think the flour coating could have used salt... other than that it was fantastic.  It will definately be made again!

I am no stranger to country cooking but I have never made cube steak quite like this before.  It was absolutely awesome and I will make it again for sure!  I have a ton of deer cube steak frozen so I used that instead.  To the flour I added 2T wheat germ (to lessen my guilt) and 1T canned bread crumbs.  Following other members' advice, I made sure the steaks were really cold and the oil (I was not about to use lard! Canola oil worked just fine.) was really hot.  Perfectly crispy!  I put the finished steaks in a 250 degree oven to stay warm while I made way too much gravy.  The key is keeping the ratio of fat to flour 1:1 and constantly stirring in the slowly added milk. You gotta add the salt and pepper to this or it will taste like greasy flour. Also I did a very light sprinkling of cayenne on the steaks before dredging and added 2T whipping cream to the egg wash.  Not a meal for every week since it's so loaded in fat and calories but a very yummy treat to indulge in.  It's a Southern thing, I guess. :)

A great southern chicken-fried steak.  Being from Texas, it's hard to find chicken-fried steak recipes that even come close to what we can get at local restaurants, but this one is a winner!  I'll salt the meat a little better the next time, because mine was blander than we like.  I had a little difficulty w/ the gravy because I thought there needed to be much more than what the recipe made.  (Again, that's probably a southern thing... we like our gravy!  LOL)  I added more milk to make more gravy and should have also salted and peppered it better.  But, all in all, it's one of the best "real" chicken-fried steak recipes I've ever made and I'll definitely keep using it.  My hubby enjoyed it!

Very good recipe & great comfort food! I add 2 chicken bouillon cubes & the rest of the seasoned evap milk (plus the rest of the can if necessary) to the milk gravy for extra flavor, otherwise it tastes a bit 'flat' to me for some reason. I also double dredge in seasoned flour instead of plain & seasoned (I find 1 c. is enough for 6 steaks with just enough leftover for the gravy) I really like that the coating actually sticks to the steak, not to my cast iron pan, in this recipe.

I have encountered the issue with the batter separating from the meat in other recipes as well. Someone else suggested making sure the oil is very hot; that is a great idea. I'd add that you should make sure the meat you are breading (meat, chicken. portk, etc.) is patted dry before breading. This allows the initial flour dip to take hold on the protein.

My wife and I made this yesterday morning and it turned out great.  We used Vegetable Shortening instead of lard, and cooked it on cast iron.  Instead of measuring out the left-over fat for the gravy, I just left it in the pan and eye-balled the rest.  A tip for making the gravy, especially if you're using cast iron: Turn down the heat and add as much milk at a time as you can, because the cast iron gets so hot it will evaporate the milk extremely fast unless you can cool it down.  Also, use a wire whisk to constantly stir the gravy and break the chunks apart -- whisks always work great for gravy-making.  Ours turned out a little on the thick side, but it tasted great.  Another tip: if your gravy tastes bland and floury, just add more salt and keep it on the heat a tad longer.  Gravy without salt will always taste funny.  Great tasting and easy recipe!

I skipped the eggs in this and just dipped in the flour, adding paprika with salt and pepper to it; I used vegetable oil to fry the steaks.  I also added a bit of paprika and a dash of rubbed sage and more salt and pepper to my milk gravy!  Delicious!

I made this for dinner tonight and my fiance and I both loved it. The gravy was "just like mom used to make!" I didn't have any lard on hand so I sub'd bacon grease. The added flavor was so tasty. I served it with buttery smashed potatoes, sweet corn and (of course) biscuits.

Delicious and easy! I used 1/2 cup safflower oil instead of the shortening and added a dash of worcestershire to the gravy. I also used top round steak instead of cube steak because that's what I had on hand. It was very tender and my husband told me he felt like his granny had just cooked him dinner. Thanks for the great recipe, it's a keeper!

Yum this was fantastic, I love country fried steak, but have never tried to make it! I did season my flour with some garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and meat tenderizer, therefore eliminating the salt in this recipe, as the tenderizer has plenty. Also we used venison cube steaks as we already had them in the freezer.  The steaks were tender and flavorful.  Beacuse we used vension we did not feel too guilty about frying them.  Besure to have your oil nice and hot! Yummmmmm

I've never tried making anything like this before and it turned out perfect. Meat was tender and flavorful and breading was nice. I made the following changes: 1-I threw some minced garlic, salt, and pepper on 2 flap steaks and pounded them with a mallot under they were flat, which I think eliminated any chance of them being too chewy and bland. I also added a couple tsp of milk to the egg wash. 2- I sauteed some minced garlic with a few chopped mushrooms, simmered them in a bit chicken broth, and added about half the mixture to the gravy to give it a hint of mushroomy taste (I love mushrooms). I added the rest to some mashed potatoes. 3- I added a few bread crumbs to the flour.I don't think you can screw this up as long as you pound the meat and use hot oil. cooking time was perfect. Also, instead of lard, I used veg. oil with a a bit of margarine.

This turned out great!  I've made country fried steak for years but just doing it however.  It's nice to actually have a recipe to go by.  Thank you for the tip on making sure the oil is hot too, that really makes a difference and a lesson I will take with me forever!!!

Wow, finally a way to cook tender cube steak.  Bit of a mess to clean up, but worth it.  I followed the directions exactly (used solid Crisco for my lard) and the meat came out wonderful! Served the gravy over rice.  Easy enough for me :) --- a definite keeper.  Thanks!

It's funny reading reviews of this recipe and seeing people say how heavy it is and that it's too bland. That's pretty much the definition of chicken fried steak. It is old time country cooking and black pepper is the only seasoning. I use bacon grease instead of lard for the cooking fat because I always have that on hand. We don't have very often because you can feel your arteries clogging with every bite! But it would really lose something if you tried to "lighten" it or spice it to make it something it isn't.

This is exactly the recipe that I use and my family has used for ages. Because I am from the South (Alabama), I love this recipe even with it's simplicity and lack of robust flavor. People who like spices should try adding cayenne pepper and garlic powder for something extra. Me? I'll stick with the homestyle method. Thanks!

This was my first ever attempt at chicken fried steak and it turned out great.  Used seasoned salt in the dredging flour and then I salted and peppered the meat before dipping in flour and egg stuff. My gravy turned out too thick, but that was my fault, I should have added more milk.  Will make again!

Great recipe! For those of us that like a little more substantial coating, I dip the meat in plain bread crumbs instead of the second dip in flour, but it works well as written. You can't have this without the gravy...yum! The mistakes most people make when making gravy is not cooking it long enough, not stirring it enough, and hesitating to add more liquid (milk, broth, whatever) if it appears to be to thick.  Remember, it will continue to thicken after being removed from heat, especially milk gravy thickened with flour. This meal with mashed potatoes is a family favorite.

I love cooking, but have never been able to make a really good gravy..... that is until now. This recipe is fantastic, and the only change I would suggest, is to double the gravy ingredient's. Everything else is spot on perfect. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a very good recipe, my steaks and gravy came out perfect. I used canola instead of lard, also watched the video which was a big help. Definately will keep this one on my list to cook! Thanks for the recipe.

I have lived in the south all of my life (50+ years) and have never eaten, much less cooked country fried steak.  I must admit that it was pretty dang tasty!  The menfolk loved it.  Prepared the recipe exactly as written.  Thank you.

This recipe knocks it out of the ball park. My husband bows at my feet whenever I make it (so yep, I make it a lot!!). Seriously, I use this as my "go to" recipe for venison cube steaks (which is about the only way I'll eat venison). Husband always takes leftovers into the office to make his male co-workers envious, and they, too, bow at my feet ;) Coming from an ex-Texas girl who knows her chicken-fried steaks, this recipe is perfect as written!!

This recipe has been in my family for, I don't know how many years, and is identical with the exception of a couple of things, instead of dredging, dipping in beaten eggs, and dredging again, we just press the flour into the steaks and salt and pepper once the steaks are put in the pan to fry, and, we use Crisco instead of lard.   For the gravy instead of milk, we use 1 can of Carnation Evaporated milk, and one can of water, salt to taste, and, yes, a lot of pepper, the more the better, ohhh, sooo, creamy, and ohhh, sooo, gooood!!! We have it often, and there is never any left.

I've been making this w/o a reciepe since my gran tought me 25 years ago.  Only, we don't use the egg.  If you rinse the steak & pat with a paper towel, it's moist enough to get a nice coating.  I also, like to season my meat a bit before the dredge.  I don't use lard, standard vegtable oil or crisco work just fine.

This was good.  I didn't have lard so I used plain Crisco.  Next time I make this, I'll just use butter.  The crisco was NOT a good base for the gravy.  I ended up dumping that out and starting over with butter.  I also used cream instead of milk and even though the gravy was thick, it tasted AWESOME!

Very good......I used olive oil instead of the lard as that is what I had on hand and as another reviewer quoted used 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 cup chicken broth......my only complaint is there was NOT enough gravy, so I would STRONGLY suggest doubling it, especially if you are serving mashed potatoes with this recipe!

Made this for my family tonight. BIG HIT! I've made country fried steak before but this time the gravy turned out just right and the steaks were perfect, too. I used canola oil instead of lard and added some seasoning salt and paprika to the flour but every thing else - including timing and technique - was per the recipe.  The family told me I'm going to be making this a lot more!

I was skeptical at first with so little ingredients but this is truly fantastic!  I admit, I was weary with the pepper...it does sound like a lot so I just eyeballed it and used very little compared to what it said. My husband said its not enough so I might opt to do half next time (too many incidents with recipes putting too much pepper).  Either way, this was delicious.  I've done this twice now and I've got a few tips. 1. If you have really thin steaks like I did, skip the medium high heat and go for medium.  I learned the hard way its better to go for less heat.  You can always cook it more.  2.  For the gravy, I tripled the recipe the 2nd time, and I had to reduce the heat because it wasn't quite done yet at 4 min but if I left it on a little more on medium I think it would have started to burn. If you watch your heat and pepper it up to your taste you should have perfect results everytime.

For a 15 minute chicken fried steak, this was awesome.  I prefer a little more flavor in my gravy and a thicker fried coating in general, but I would take a lot more time to prepare something like that.  I added a few seasonings to the gravy and to the breading to make it more flavorful and still have it done quickly and I thought that was great.  The breading was nice and crispy and the gravy was good.  Definitely a good one!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. It was my first time making country fried steaks and it turned out awesome. I used butter instead of lard but it kept sticking so I switched to oil which helped keep the breading together. First attempt at making gravy from stratch too! Gravy came out wonderful just like my mom's. Great recipe, very easy too!

I used to cook supper for my wife during the week when she came home from work to make sure her ailing father had something to eat. I consider myself to be a beginner at cooking. As long as you follow the recipe,(and I love All Recipes), one should be able to survive. I fixed this recipe to a tee and my wife and I loved it. Needless to say it was very tender and I will be making this again. Thanks, LIKESTOCOOK,...Tom J

I've been making this for years, and it's good, but I do use a little more seasoning in the flour- onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika, because it makes a prettier, darker steak.

Comfort food at its best. This is one of the best recipes for country fried steak I have had. The only thing I did different was I used vegetable oil instead of lard.

Great taste and my family really enjoyed.  A restaurant near us breads and fries the steak like this and then tops it with monterey jack cheese, scallions, chopped fresh tomatoes and chilies.  It's dynamite!

This really tastes good, however I made some changes that really had my husband and son licking their lips!I salt and pepper the meat but that was all. Fry the meat in a stick of butter instead of lard. The flavor of butter adds a wonderful taste. I did after the meat is a nice brown color I left some of the grease and browned some onion. Then came the flour, sprinkle flour in frying pan with the onions and grease.With a fork quickly whisk the flour, onion, and grease mixture tilla crumbley brown stage. While you are whisking slowly pour in hot water...keep whiskinguntil all flour is smoothed out. Now let the gravey start to cook. You will notice it start to bubble. Keep whisking once every 20 sec. or so until you get the right consistacy. If too thick add water, if to thin add flour. Salt and pepper to taste. Now por that on youe cubesteak and watch your family lik their lips baby! Yummy onion/grease gravy for the meat. Try over white rice or mashed potatoes too. It is soooo good.

This was a great receipe.  It seemed like it needed a little more salt.  Other then that I think it was great!  I also tried to make the gravy, but it was looking awful so I decided not to use the gravy as mentioned in the receipe.  Using the fat from the meat was not my idea of making gravy in my opinion.

THIS is the recipe I've been searching for! No fuss, nothing elaborate, just perfect country fried steak like my dad made when I was a little girl. The breading was just right (some recipes call for dredging through the egg 2x and the flour 3x), and the gravy was divine. I see now that the problem with all the recipes I was trying was that they added too much extra junk to the gravy. This was great, the gravy is just a little sweet, and so smooth and just PERFECT. For those who thought the breading needed kick, I find that adding 1/2 tsp cumin for each cup of dredging flour gives it a nice smokiness.  Thanks Patti!!

Did not like this.  I used a deep fryer for the steak the next time and seasoned the steak with seasoned meat tenderizer.  Made the gravy using butter based rue.  Thumbs down on lard!

This recipe is really good. The only thing that I do differently when I make a milk or cream gravy is that I always add an 8 ounce package of "room temperature" cream cheese. I learned this from an Amish family near the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania. The cream cheese is mild flavored enough, yet rich enough, to add an additional creaminess to the gravy while also adding a mild "bite" to it as well.

I haven't made this recipe, but I've made similar.  Also, add onion powder and a boullion cube or 2 while it is cooking.  Really good.

I made this as written  except I used butter instead of lard because  I didn't  have  it on hand. the meat was really  tasty but  when it came to the gravy,,,,it was pretty bland and I had to continue  adding salt to it. I will make again but do something  different  with the gravy

I like a little more salt and pepper on the meat before coating in flour, but this is really tasty.  I sometimes make this with just the flour (skipping the eggs) for a quicker, lighter dish.  "Lard" is a scary word.  I  just use vegetable oil.

I used frozen hamburger patties that I really don't enjoy as burgers.  I did flatten them out a bit and then I followed the recipe as written.  I enjoyed the peppery gravy!

I grew up on fried cube steaks and gravy and have tried often to recreate but the flavor just hasn't been what I recalled.  Not anymore!  Don't know if it was the lard, high temp,or egg wash - all new to me - but this sure satisfied my longing!  Almost as good as what I always get at our favorite restaurant in Springfield, MO.  Hubby thought the pepper was a bit over the top so I'll cut that back a bit next time but that's the only change I'll make.  Thanks for a very satisfying recipe!

I wanted to impress my boyfriend with cooking him a country fried steak dinner so I used this recipe.  He loved it.  I loved it.  I was so impressed.  The steaks turned out perfect and was really delicious.  I had leftovers for lunch the next day and I thought my steak would be dried out because of reheating in the microwave but it was still perfect and juicy.  I will definitely be making this again!

EXCELLENT! I added some seasoned salt and garlic powder to the flour mixture for a bit more flavor. Also, I used a mixture of bacon grease (Thanks for the idea, Sherri, lol) and veg. oil for frying, instead of the lard, and just browned the meat in the pan and finished cooking it in the oven. I doubled the gravy to ensure that there was enough for our mashed potatoes too! I really can't believe how tender the meat came out...soooo good! Hubby LOVED this dinner, and is already asking for it again, lol. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've been making this recipe for years.  The only difference is I use Vegetable oil instead of lard & I don't use an entire cup of flour (1/4 C give or take).  This is one of the good ole southern dish's that I grew up eating.  More than likely one of the first recipes I learned to make.  As a young lady growing up in the mountains in Tennessee, the first things I learned how to cook was how to fry EVERYTHING! (Poultry, beef, pork, venison, wild turkey, vegetables, etc!) My family never used measurements, I learned to "eyeball" it & add a little more of this, a little less of that, whisk & continue cooking until it "looks right."  Lol.. I know it sounds funny but that is really how I was taught!  My husband requests this the most.  But he doesn't like gravy on it, (I do) he just likes it fried extra crispy with salt & pepper.  This is a great basic recipe that you can play around with & add your own spin on it with adding spices & making the gravy to your preference.  It's absolutely a 5 star recipe.  Everyone will enjoy this one!

I've only had country fried steak in restaurants, never have I attempted to make it myself. This was pretty easy, I followed the recipe pretty much, we used bacon fat to fry the steaks...and make the gravy...I know really unhealthy...but boy was it good. The gravy was so good. Next time and this will not be an often thing for me to eat, but I'll double the gravy for the mashed potatoes too. Was a very nice special treat...and way better than any restaurant has ever served me.

Really good recipe, I doubled everything. I cut the steaks the long way so they wouldnt be too tough to chew for the kids. Made the gravy as is....great meal. Just be sure to add a little extra seasoning to the flour so the batter isnt just tasting like flour.

This was awesome comfort food.  I took others advice, used milk and broth (I had beef broth) for the gravy, along with a little more spice (red pepper).  I have been trying to cook healthier foods for my family, but when my almost growm boys asked for meat, I gave them this.  It was a huge hit, they gave it their best ever compliments!  haha, of course! It is a must on my rotation from now on.  Thank you

I can't personally attest to this recipe (I'm a vegetarian), but I've made it twice for my country fried steak loving boyfriend, and although he said it was good, both times the majority of it has ended up in the fridge and then down the garbage disposal. I'm definitely never making it again. Three stars because I don't know if its good or not.

Yum!  This is a recipe that requires cooking experience.  Milk gravy takes a while to get the hang of making.  Pour your milk in slow to prevent lumping and start pouring it in once the flour turns tan not dark brown.  Try, try again!

I loved the country fried steak, didn't care for the milk gravy, it was brown not white and burnt tasting but the meat wasn't burned. Just didn't care for the taste. I actually used a package white gravy mix for the leftovers and it was great.

I am a reformed steak snob. I thought I was too good to eat cube steak when my grocery store had a 50% then 30% off coupon on some and I thought "why not?". What a pleasant surprise; so quick to prepare and tender to eat and why did I not think of breading and frying steak before?! Yummy! Topping it with a white gravy just perfected this dish.  We will be having this again and often.  So good!

This turned out great!  I flash fried them and finished them off in the oven so I could prepare the rest of the meal.  I also just used the packaged country gravy and fried in canola instead of lard.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was good, but not the best I've ever had. For starters I would recommend beating the cube steak to make is less tuff and thinner. Next time I make this I will dip steak in egg then in flour mixture. Also recipe didn't make very much gravy. I had to keep adding flour and milk to make enough for my family. Will make again with these changes.

Very good, meat stayed tender and I had no problems with the crust not sticking. Be sure to use med high heat and be patient, turning the heat high will only burn the crust and leave burnt pieces in the pan when you start to make the gravy.

This was great! I love country fried steak, and this was the first recipe where I could successfully make it myself. REALLY pound the meat, the thinner the better.

I make this a lot! But I add Cayenne Pepper, garlic powder, salt, black pepper and celery salt to Italian seasoned bread crumbs, dip the meat into beaten egg, then in bread crumbs. I also fry in lard - best in the world for frying! Serve with peppered country gravy. This is definitely a 5 star recipe!

I followed the recipe as written, except I substituted garlic salt when I seasoned the meat initially. I used regular salt for the gravy. I also used canola oil, since I made 12 servings and don't keep that much lard around. I don't know if it was a function of making so many servings, or if maybe I am just heavy-handed when it comes to seasoning, but I used way more than 3 times the amount of salt and pepper for the initial seasoning. I think each piece is 12 Weight-Watcher points, for those of us who are counting, but everybody LOVED it.

This was really good. My boyfriend loves to cook but doesnt have much skill. He was able to make this (with my supervision) with no problem and it came out great. We did add extra pepper and used oil/butter instead of lard.

I followed the recipe and made some modifications. I added some seasoning to the flour, salt, pepper, garlic salt, ms. dash original blend. I think everything else I did it exactly the same, the only think I would do differently next time is that after battering the steak in the flour, I would also use another style of crumbs. It will make it more crunchy or even instead of the flour. Not sure, the coating was too heavy, or maybe it was I am not used to it.

So good, I let mine simmer in the gravy for about @ 2 hours. Made the gravy really thin with a can of beef broth so it could cook longer and not turn into paste. The steaks were so tender and just wonderul.

i always have a hard time with breading and this was the same as my previous experiences. i'm still working on that.  my skills aside, this was a great meal. doubled the gravy and served with mashed potatoes. my husband said it hit the spot and that i should make it again, and often. i'm not sure about often, but i will add it to the rotation.

Made this tonight. Excellent!! Doubled the gravy used half milk and half homemade beef stock, and used a combo of olive oil and veggie oil. Sorry but I won't use lard for anything, just can't bring myself to do it. Very good recipe, thank you for sharing it!

I give this recipe about 3.5 stars.  I never made this from scratch, but tastes much better than the frozen deep fried patties served at the restaurants.  However, there is a lot of salt and pepper in this recipe for 4 steaks, in my opinnion.  I also added a couple pinches of garlic powder and onion salt to the flour, as suggested on similar recipes on here for Country Fried Steak.  Might make again, but without the gravy and a little less salt and pepper.  Bread coating is nice and light and cube steak can actually be tasted unlike the processed patties.

i bought a whole bunch of striploin steaks a while ago, and while some may argue that this is a sad way to use such a nice cut, i just have so many hanging around that i need to use them in some way or another. i used two of these, pounded them to 1/4" thickness and cut them into 2-3 pieces each to make them more manageable shapes. also, instead of dredging in flour a second time, i used bread crumbs for the outer layer to make the steaks crispier. delicious!

First of all, I am not a cube steak lover, however my husband is.  Had some in the meat drawer and came to this site to look for some ideas.  This was the recipe of the day so thought I would give it a try.  Believe it or not, I had never had Country Fried anything but always wanted to try.  I even used some onion and garlic powder with the flour but it just didnn't do anything for me. My husband complained through the meal that it didn't taste as good as plain fried cube steak.

I must have done something wrong. The outside would get done and the middle was still red. I had to bake them a bit to get the middle finished, and then they were tough and chewy. The kids said it tasted like chicken, which is a good thing.

I only use enough shortening to coat the bottom of a cast-iron skillet. Only use cast iron, and make sure your skillet is HOT! For a twist, pre-cook, drain and crumble TINY bits of a mild bulk sausage into the milk gravy for a super flavor. Also, if your gravy wants to thicken or congeal, try adding a tablespoon of brewed black coffee to it. Add slowly while whisking. (adjust amount to desired texture/flavor) This step will boost the flavor and keep the texture just right!

My first time making CFS and it was great!  When my husband walked in from outside, the smell brought back happy childhood memories of his grandma's cooking!  I will definitely make this again!  Even the gravy turned out well -- and I've never had good luck with gravy! :)  Happy cooking....

The steaks turned out really good.  My kids even liked this and they are very picky.  The gravy turned out like mud.  I don't know what went wrong, but overall a good recipe.

We just did not like this recipe much.  I know that country fried steak is supposed to be bland, but this really had no flavor.  My kids (13,10) did not like at all.

Husband loved it! Only thing I will change next time is double the milk for the gravy.  It didn't make much as is.  Very good and easy recipe though.  Will definitely make again.

my first review :) and a great place to start...this is a great recipe...i have been using one similar to this for years and it's one of my favorites...the only things i do different are the seasonings and the way i cook it...in the dredging flour i use onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and salt and pepper...i brown the steaks at a med/high temp until brown on both sides and running pink, then i place them in a slow cooker...i make the gravy according to this recipe,except doubled..and i add garlic and more pepper...i then pour the gravy over the steaks in the slow cooker and cook at low for about 4 hours...oh my!!! these are wonderfully tender and gravyyee...delicious...

This was very good.  I substituted the lard for oil.  I also added a bit of paprika on the steaks.

Just make sure the oil is very hot before adding the steaks.  Makes the outside nice and crispy, not mushy.

This was a good basic recipe which my husband and young children loved.  I altered it however by adding onion salt, garlic, seasoning salt and some other seasonings to give it some flavor.  I didnt cook in lard (I used canola oil instead) and didn't make the gravy.  I used a country gravy package with half and half milk....made it taste very rich and delicious. Definately a meal to eat when you are not watching what you are eating, full of fat but very good comfort food.

I used chicken breast instead of steak. I just lightly pounded the breasts with the edge of a salad plate (didn't have a hammer). Be careful not to pound too hard or too much or it will tear your meat apart. I used fine sea salt to rub the breasts before I dredged them. I followed other reviewer advice and let the meat set for 20 minutes to get the flour to really stick to the meat during the frying process. I did use McKormick's country gravy packets instead of making my own and it was awesome! I did use canola oil and in my frying pan, I filled the pan to where the oil went up about 3/4 of an inch. Heat the oil on medium high (between 8 and 9 on an electric stove). Every few minutes, check oil readiness by using the end of the handle on a wooden spoon. If the oil is ready, it will start to bubble around the spoon handle (learned that on Rachael Ray). You may need to decrease the temp a little if the oil starts to smoke or the oil turns too brown. This recipe was fantastic, and it went very well with mashed potatoes!!!

This was a great way to prepare cube steak.  I have never double dipped in flour before, and it gave the meat a nice crispy coating.  I don't know if I finally cooked it right, or if it was due to the meat sitting in the oven on warm for about 10 minutes while I cooked the gravy, but the meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  My grandma always tells me "cook 'em quick in a hot pan!"  So I let the pan get really hot before I added the oil.  The gravy was good, but a little lacking in flavor.  Maybe adding beef bullion would make it taste a little better.  I will make this again.

Hey this is my famous cubed steak recipe.  I omit the egg and just dip the steaks in milk instead.  This is a fantastic dish as long as you remember to season your flour well.

This is a good recipe. I have cooked this twice, the first time followed the recipe to a T. The second time I made changes based on other reviews. The changes I made were as follows: Add garlic powder to the seasoning on the meat and to the flour. I also added salt, pepper, and garlic to the egg. You also need to double or triple the sauce if you plan on making mashed potatoes. With the changes I have made this recipe gets a 5. If you make it as stated then I think it gets a 4. Thanks for the recipe post.

This was pretty good. I doubled the gravy ingredients and added quite a bit of seasonings to   spice it up a bit, otherwise it would have been bland. The steaks cooked up nicely with the breading crisp..and it stayed on! Did not use lard, I used canola oil with a little butter melted in.

I made this last night and it was excellent!  Instead of lard, I used canola oil and took the advice of a previous post about letting the steaks drain over paper towel on a cooling rack.  It worked great!

My boyfriend and I both said "Wow!" when we took our first bite of this!  It's probably the best country fried steak I've had, I was amazed by how flavorful it was with just salt and pepper and vegetable oil instead of lard. The coating was nice and crispy and the steaks were still hot when the gravy was done.  The gravy was good, too, but I had to add 1/4 cup more milk.  I also prefer for it to have a bit of chicken stock in place of the milk (gives it a better flavor to me).  I served this with Alton Brown's southern biscuit recipe (from the show Good Eats on Food Network), they were the best biscuits ever if anyone's looking for the perfect biscuits to go with this recipe.

At best, this was ok.  Used butter/oil combo for frying.  Had good flavor, but the coating just slid off after frying.   Had to add extra milk to the gravy as it seemed to get too thick.  Probably won't make this again.

This wasn't exactly what I thought it would be.  The coating wasn't very crispy, like I like it, and it didn't sitck to the meat after cooking.  Maybe it is just that I lack good frying ability, but it wasnt very good.  My husband ate it, but I think he was just being nice!  I will probably keep looking.

This recipe takes me back to my childhood days on the farm. If mom had cream to use, it was "minute steaks with cream gravy"; obviously if milk was used, it was "with milk gravy". It didn't need to be more flavorful than the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, combined with some pepper, poured over mashed potatoes, to be a satisfying, stick to your ribs, meal. Pre-cholesterol, pre-fat-free, comfort food.

This was so easy to make and delicious too!! I thought the pepper factor was fine, yet I added 1 tsp of onion flakes and 1/2 tsp of Lawry's seasoned salt. Otherwise the gravy was just bland but full of pepper. Received no complaints from boyfriend (always a sign of a keeper) and reheated well for lunch the next day. Would recommend giving this a try yet might want to cut back on the amount of pepper used depending on personal preference.

Excellent recipe. We added about a tsp of garlic powder, italian seasoning, and seasoning salt to the flour mixture and a tsp of seasoning salt on the steak. The gravy was awesome, we will use it as our main gravy recipe from now on.

This was fantastic.  I used venison steaks instead.  My boyfriend swears that this recipe can make any cut of venison steak taste as good as the  tenderloin.  I used an old heavy cast iron fry pan and also added a teaspoon of cajun seasoning to the flour.  It was just great!

My family an I thought this recipe was GREAT! I used shortening insted of the lard (not something I keep on hand), and also seasoned a little more than the recipe called for. This is not something you should eat everyday if your watching your figure, but it will be on our splurge list!

I thought this dish was great!  I made it for a group of middle-school girls and they were surprised how much it tasted like country-fried steak at their favorite restaurant.  Thanks for a delicious dinner and 7 happy teenagers!

This is the classic CFS and gravy!  Sometimes I add just a pinch of thyme to the gravy; sometimes I add a shake of Tony Chachare's Creole Seasoning.  I'm glad to see the recipe creator uses lard; it really makes a difference when you are quick-frying meats and poultry.  I've also used venison and elk using this recipe and technique.

A awesome recipe and it is how we cook it in the south for sure..little hint my own son taught me is....add one part corn meal to two parts flour dredging mixture..(note..dont use this for the gravy..flour only..no cornmeal)...its the secret many southern style home cooking restaurants  use..you know the small tiny restaurants that stay packed out....the crust is just the best ever...its also a recipe you can add a little boulioun to the gravy mix...chicken or beef..and we dont use much lard these days...cornola is fine..olive oil as well...as is its the perfect traditional recipe that all the southern grannys use....note..do brown the flour well before you add milk or half and half to the gravys rough ...little rule is make it smell like you want it to taste..them add milk..etc..im all for chicken or veggie broth as well....its all very good...and so easy...

Looks like a good recipe for me to try, but I will have to cut way back on the pepper.  Pepper is not my favorite spice.

this is the way I have been making chicken fried steak forever. one hint is to tenderize the  steaks a little with a mallet before coating them. not a lot but it really makes them so tender you can cut them with a fork. a real Texas staple.

oh-wow-yumm.. The only thing hubby said was "I'm a little bummed you didnt make me 2 of them." I said,but I did give you the biggest piece,maybe next time. I dredged twice,s&p,paparika,and fried in olive oil. Used the gravy out of the jar.Thats a keeper,and now I dont have to wait to get it at the restaraunt.

My mother taught me this recipe 45 yrs ago. One of my sons' faves growing up. They all had me teach their wives how to make it. Sometimes we ask the butcher to tenderize round steak & cut into smaller pieces for mini steaks. Still scrumptious!!

This is a good basic country fried steak recipe....pretty similar to what you'll get most places.  I do mine a touch different.  I crush saltines and mix that with the flour (about a 50/50 mixture)along with some pepper and seasoned salt.  I also use an egg/milk mixture to dip them in.  You can use any type of oil (I use whatever I have on hand).  I also add pepper and seasoned salt to my gravy, and make much more...am guessing I about triple it(I don't measure anything so it's hard to say for sure).  I also use a cast iron skillet.  Make sure the oil is hot before you start cooking, and don't turn the steaks too soon or the coating will fall off.

I have been using this recipe for years but with one exception.  I
dip the cube steak in flour and then into the egg mixture and into
crushed cracker crumbs.  Try it, I think you will like it.

didn't make the gravy (we already had cream gravy to use) but the steaks were good.  Could have used more salt (but I eye-balled it so I may not have used enough in the first place - I tend to salt very lightly).

Super good and easy to do! I did not use lard, however; I used butter. I did double the gravy so we could use it for the mashed potatoes. As I was eating it, I wondered what it would be like with sautéed mushrooms...hmmm! Thank you for the recipe :)

Made this tonight in 2 batches and 2 ways. First batch made as written, Very good. However, family loved the second batch made by cutting steaks into bite size pieces, sprinkling with salt, pepper and lots of garlic powder , then dredging in flower inside of a ziploc bag and pounding with a mallet, then in egg batter, then back into flour again before frying. Crispy, awesome, YUMMY!!!!  The bite size pieces are super tender and cook fast.  Gravy was yummy too.  I did add a little garlic powder to it. Thank you for this recipe.

Family loved it. I am not one for measuring, I "learned" from my grandmother to eyeball it, so the gravy was a little thicker and I added bacon to it. I also used the bacon drippings in place of the lard. Over all this was so easy and will definitely make again.

This was a great meal! Very easy to make. I just use oil instead of lard, and self rising flour because I didn't have enough of all purpose flour. The steak was not tough at all, very easy to chew.:-)

Nice and simple recipe for Country Fried Steak. I left the lard out to make it a bit healthier and seasoned it with a teaspoon of rosemary for a little extra flavor (and because that's how I remember my mom making it!).

Delicious recipe.  I made a few changes as mentioned by other cooks.  Made gravy with buttermilk, cut down a bit on the pepper, added a little chicken broth for flavor, let steaks sit about 10 minutes after coating with egg and flour.  Coating stayed on and was nicely browned in about 3 min. per side.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  It is a keeper in my book!

My family LOVES Country Fried Steak.  As an example, once when we went to Cracker Barrel I was the only one in the family who didn't get the country fried steak.  This is the first time I've ever attempted to make it.  I fixed this tonight.  The only change I made was canola oil instead of lard.  My family LOVED LOVED LOVED it and has asked if I would make it again.  Great recipe!

Great recipe! The flour/egg/flour technique was wonderful as it made the breading stay on. I used a touch of garlic powder on the meat before breading, and it was a hit in my house. Kudos!

Meat was great, but I had to add more salt to the gravy. I think I want to try the meat on a biscuit - seems like a good idea.

Very delicious. This was my 1st attempt at one of my husband's favorite meals. We both loved it! My only change: vegetable oil instead of lard (enough to coat the bottom of my skillet ~1/8"). Like kelcampbell, I saved a portion (~1/8-1/4 c.) for the gravy after cooking the steaks. I poured it all from the pan to a bowl, fished out the browned bits with a slatted spoon, and then used a regular spoon to get a little oil.

Made this tonight and it was good. I used butter instead of lard and added Mrs. Dash, extra ground pepper and extra salt. I would have preferred the coating to be more flavorful and heavier. In addition I had to use nearly 1/2 cup of butter. I will make again soon.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was great!  I didn't make the gravy so I'm rating just the steak.  The only changes I made were to add a little more seasoning to the flour, and I fried in the butter/oil combo that others have suggested, since I've never used lard and didn't want to make a trip to the store just for that.  We LOVED it - will definitely be in the regular rotation.

This was my first time making country fried steak on my own and I think it came out pretty tasty. I ended up adding too much salt, so next time I will reduce the amount of extra seasoning. All in all good recipe.

Wasn't as spectacular as I expected.  I prefer more breading on my country fried steak.  As a cube steak it was about right.

My husband loved this. Be careful of your temp I let my oil get a little too hot and almost burned one which made my brown bits in the pan a little darker than I like for making gravy.

My husband and daughter tend to be rather picky however they really enjoyed this dish. My daughter and I love the gravy but DH is a brown gravy fan. Will have to make some brown gravy on the side next time for him. Overall...a really good recipe. I am going to place in my recipe book and will certainly make again. Thank you.

Followed exactly as written except made the gravy in a separate pan using 2 Tb butter w/ the 2 Tb reserved flour and the milk.  My iron skillet burns after a while and the gravy wouldn't have turned out if I'd made it in there (the same pan I fried the meat in).  Maybe it's just because I'm pregnant and highly sensitive to tastes and smells right now, but I thought there was way too much pepper in this recipe.  The steaks are seasoned with salt and pepper, dredged twice each in a flour mixture w/ 1 teaspoon of pepper, then the gravy is made using reserved flour from the coating and you're supposed to add an additional 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  I added 1/4 teaspoon.  Like I said, WAY too much pepper.  Maybe all the other reviewers said this--I don't know because I didn't read any reviews--but future recipe triers beware.

I did not like this recipe. There wasn't enough flavor in the steak and gravy. I changed the recipe by adding salt ,pepper,paprika, and garlic powder to the flour and I added half chicken broth and half milk to the gravy. There still wasn't enough flavor. This is a bland recipe I wouldn't recommend it. There wasn't enough gravy for the steak and potatoes. I had to triple the gravy. I definitley will not ever use this recipe again.

This was good, not great but good.  I just don't think I am a cubed steak fan.  I had to add a lot more salt then suggested and I doubled the gravy, added some Kitchen Bouquet and more salt and pepper to give it more flavor.  Prob. won't make this again...

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS - worthy of 10-hundred stars!!! My husband and I both LOVED this - I'd go so far as to say its one of the best recipes I've found on this site to date!  I used Crisco in place of lard and added some garlic powder & paprika to the flour mixture.  Cooked it in a cast iron pan then added a can of mushrooms and some garlic salt to the gravy (sauce was a tad bland but some shakes of garlic salt plus a tab-sized bit of butter  made it fantastic).  Sauce cooked for about 5 minutes, with constant whisking, instead of 3-4.  Everything else was followed exactly.  THANK YOU, Likestocook - this will be a nice & low cost addition to our rotation now!!

We call this "Chicken Fried Steak" here in Kansas City. With the mashed potatoes you will need a lot more gravy than called for.  There is place here called Corner Cafe that has the best CFS I've ever eaten and I can't figure out what they do differently.

Loved this recipe. It had lots of flavor. We didn't have enough lard at the end to make gravy so we just added a bit more to the skillet. We also ended up needing more milk - just add as much as necessary to get the right consistency. All of this varies, of course, depending on your frying temperature, etc. So, everyone may not need to make these additions. Anyways, we loved it - thanks!

Extremely yummy.  I made two changes I made was to canola oil (I don't keep lard in my kitchen) and used top round for the steak.  Came out fabulous.  Paired this with biscuits, roasted root vegetables, and a good Merlot.  Yum, Yum.  Thanks for the share!

Made this last night and it was a hit!! I tripled the recipe to have enough for our family of 9 and it worked out very well. I mixed 3/4 tsp of pepper, onion powder, garlic salt, and paprika and seasoned the meat with it.  I also added extra onion powder and garlic salt to the flour along with the pepper. I used a stick of butter and added olive oil as needed during frying.  The key is to keep the temp high enough to fry but low enough to keep from burning the drippings. Depending on your stove you may need to adjust the heat up and down as you cook.  Whisk the flour into the drippings and cook for 2-3 mins. or until it smells nutty and it a pretty brown color.  My kids range from 2 - 13 and they loved the gravy.  It is well worth the effort! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Love it! I used canola oil instead of lard and it turned out fine except 1/4 cup was a little too much oil and I had to sear the steak on another pan on high heat w/ no oil to keep crispy. I also doubled the gravy by just doubling the ingredients.... 4 tbl spoon flour 2 cups of milk. I like my gravy really rich so I used 1 cup 2% 1 cup half-and-half and it really was rich!! Note that it might take longer to cook steaks and gravy then noted in recipe but overall I like this simple and delicious recipe!! Yummy!

This was soooo good!  I also substituted the lard for a stick of butter and it was perfect!!  My family loved it.  My only Problem was the gravy was super thick!  I think I needed more milk or I cooked it too long! But either way it still tasted great!

We made this last night and Oh My Goodness! We did add garlic and onion powder - we do to every thing, and a little adobo instead of salt alone, and it was wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. It was as much a joy to prepare as it was to serve. Felt like home should from start to finish.

I loved the flavour it gave to a cheap cut of meat. I did mess up the gravy somehow. I will definitely make it again minus the gravy.

Very good recipe, but to make it excellent, I highly suggest ditching the cube steak (which can come from any various parts of the steer and usually has a lot of gristle) and go with tenderized round steak.

So, so good! Had no problem with taste. I added about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder to flour. I used veg. oil and butter instead of lard. They were amazing. Had no leftovers which makes me sad :(

Very good comfort food!  I prepared the dish exactly as stated in the recipe except I cheated and used packaged white gravy.  I will prepare it again but I feel it needs more pepper.

I used cubed round ELK steak. It wasn't nearly as gamey as venison.  I would imagine the quality of your cubing or tenderizing would affect the final product greatly.  Make sure your skillet is HOT!  I couldn't hardly get my electric skillet (@ the highest 400 degree setting)hot enough and then killed the heat when I dropped in 2 steaks.  Use cast iron on a range top.  Simple recipe- easy to make- tastes great!

This recipe was too bland for me.  The gravy didn't come together properly for me either.  I'm not sure what the problem was.  The technique for cooking the steaks was fine, but they were still tough and we resorted to steak sauce to give them some semblance of flavor.

This was so good. I didn't have any problems making the breading stick..I made sure my oil was super hot. I didn't use lard and I didn't have any vegetable oil on hand so I used peanut oil and a little crisco. Also, I added breakfast sausage to the gravy. Yum! Served with mashed potatoes, buttermilk biscuits, broccoli and corn on the cob.

I still like my recipe for chicken fried steak the best, however, I will always dip in flour, egg, and then back in flour.  The coating sticks to the steak so much better.   Thanks!

My husband & I both love country, or chicken, fried steak.  I tried this recipe for the first time tonight and we were both very pleased. For me the flavor was heavenly.  I was a little too enthusiastic with the pepper, but it was still good.  I uses canola oil instead of lard, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We will try adding a little nutmeg to the gravy next time, to see what it does, as my husband felt there was something little missing.  He did still enjoy it, though.  For my money, this recipe is great as is.  I am delighted to finally know how to make this, and that I don't have to find a restaurant that does it well.  This recipe is a definite keeper, and will be in my regular rotation of recipes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Works great!  The steaks were nice and crispy with a great texture.  The breading stayed on the meat which is one problem I have had in the past.

Ok, to the people who said these were bland, I don't know where they got that because these have plenty of flavor atleast for us. I made the country fried steak just as it stated and on the gravy I only made half of it, as it is  just my husband and me. But for us even after I halfed it there was still plenty left over. I didn't have buttermilk for the gravy so I used 1% and it turned out just fine. I just had to add just alittle more flour than called for. My husband said not to even make the gravy because he's not to big on gravy period but he ate it on this. I will be making this again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

My first time making a fried steak like this and I was worried, but it came out excellent. Breading stayed on and fried up nicely. I did add additional seasoning to the flour mixture though such as garlic powder, onion flakes and a pinch of red pepper. Gravy even came out great! Good comfort food!

Really good... although I did have to spice up the gravy a little bit... I thought it was too bland, as I enjoy really flavorful meals.  But a little bit of mushrooms, garlic salt and Mrs. Dash and it was wonderful.  Will be using this again.  Thanks :)

My only suggestion for this recipe would be to grate some fresh garlic and rub it all over the meat and let it sit for about 30 minutes before cooking. This is how I have cooked it for a while and the garlic gives it so much extra flavor. When you first cut the meat after cooking you can smell the garlic and its wonderful! This is one of my favorite comfort foods.

I made this for my husband because this is the type of food he likes. I've never been one for anything with gravy on it, but I really liked this. The gravy was very good and did not overpower the dish. I would make again, but only in moderation.

I sprinkled the steaks with Dale's marinade prior to adding the salt and pepper and let them sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Other  than that I followed the instructions exactly as the recipe calls it. Everyone in my house was very pleased (especially with the gravy). Definetely a keeper recipe!

The flavor was definately there I just need to try this again to make them more crunchy. Maybe my oil wasnt hot enough or I didnt fry long enough but the batter was a bit mushy. The whole family still ate them all!! One of my all time favorites to eat.

I grew up on this and have been making it for years. I wanted to find a recipe to see how others made it. it was awesome! Don't be alarmed by the lard....Lard is just as bad as crisco or a lot of other oils! its ok in moderation! I think skimping on some sort of pork fat takes a lot of the flavor away from the steaks....Also i always add a tad more pepper and salt than others. 

As for the gravy.....I always use half and half along with milk to make my gravy. you need to add salt and pepper to TASTE!:) as you are whisking the gravy dip your finger down in there and taste:) this also helps if you have used to pork fat.....Gravy made with canola oil just sounds eww to me...lol....anyways this recipe is GREAT! just add to taste and make it your own! happy cooking!

GREAT recipe!  I substituted lard with butter flavored crisco.  Yum.  The breading turned out perfect.  I will make this again and again.

SO GOOD! I'm afraid my husband will be wanting this for dinner once a week!  I'll be huge!  He wanted his with a little more spice so I used cajun seasoning on his steak instead of salt and pepper.  I made mine just like the recipe and thought it was perfect.  The only change I made was to use canola oil and 2 Tbs. of bacon grease instead of the lard.  And I used unsweetend soy milk in the gravy because of an allergy.  My husband and I just loved this recipe.

Made this last night and it was delicious.  I used vegetable oil instead of lard b/c that's what I had, and it was still delicious.  The gravy was awesome and so easy.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch.

This recipe tasted like good ole country cooking! Don't over cook the cube steak when frying or it will be chewey. The ony complaint is that it did not produce much milk gravy, but I think I would add more milk next time..overall good dish.

Amazing recipe!!! I always make patties out of ground beef, eggs and crackers. Also, I add seasoning salt and pepper and garlic powder to the flour. The gravy is amazing. I made this in my cast iron skillet, it always comes out great. I burnt my tounge on this gravy, that's how good it is. I was literally eating gravy by the spoonfuls.

OK, I'm a Yankee, and this is the first time I've eaten or attempted to make country fried steak.  My family loved it!  I used a combo of onion salt and garlic salt in place of the regular salt and substituted Crisco for the lard, and the flavor was good.  Our only complaint was that the meat was chewy and tough.  I will definitely try again and hope for better results.

I didn't like it, but it was a hit with my sister's fiance, who is a southern boy. I think it needed more seasoning, but other than that, I guess it was fine because he ate it all up!

This is what I call a base recipe. Meaning that you will find the basic instruction but will need to add your own touches to it. My personal touches include adding garlic, onion and paprika to the flour and a few drops of tobasco sauce to the eggs. Not enough to make it spicy, just enough to make the flavors pop. Another thing I've done is use a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of milk. It makes for a richer gravy and in my house milk doesn't last very long.

Great recipe... it tasted just like chicken! lol... I used lard, and that was the first time EVER that I had used it... MAN DID IT GET ME NAUSEOUS! It smells really gross! But everything tasted good.. BUT! I couldn't use the recipe for the milk gravy because the lard burned so I had to search a milk gravy (or roux) and it was delicious!

I make this all the time ,I learned from a women in Southern Georgia how to make this over 5 years ago and still make it the same way. I never have any leftovers. In my experience with this, if you want a little more flavor what I do is have a sauce pan with beef bouillon and water simmering. After the steaks are cooked I take them and the droppings and put them in the sauce pan for about 5 minutes per steak (I recommend doing one steak at a time). The steaks will absorb some of the beef flavor. It makes all the difference, the meat comes out juicy and tender and can be cut with a fork. Enjoy Everyone!!

I have been cooking this for years. My mother used to make this all the time when I was a kid. 
 The only thing I don't do is use the eggs, and I use regular canola oil.
 For an added taste, I add 3 tablespoons bacon grease to the cooking oil. It just adds that flavor I like.

This was pretty good. I added a little worcestershire sauce to each steak, along with onion powder, garlic powder, sea salt & pepper. I also added a can of cream mushroom soup to the gravy. I used canola oil, rather than lard. This isn't a recipe I would make often, but we will enjoy it on occassion.

I used pork cutlets and followed the recipe otherwise. Nice crispy coating. I added more milk to the gravy once it was finished to thin it down a bit. Very delicious!

The only thing I changed was instead of using the heavy oils I used extra virgin olive oil for the healthier part of the recipe along with pure organic steak, mild and egss and it was a smash so much that it was requested the next night for dinnner!

I ended up using thinly sliced round steak (store didn't have cube steak).  I did have problems with the breading not adhering to the steak...  I also doubled the gravy ... and added a half of a large onion, minced, letting the onion soften in the grease before adding the flour.  The addition of the onion was a good move, although the half was too much.  I also added a healthy sprinkle of red-pepper flakes.  I may try one of the "chicken-fried steak" recipes next time.  Can anyone tell me the difference between COUNTRY-fried steak and CHICKEN-fried steak?

This turned out really well!

I used bison cubed steaks instead, and I bumped up the spices like other reviewers had said.  I used Penzey's Bay Seasoning, Shallot Salt, and Garlic Magic in the flour.  After the steaks were done, I poured all of the flour in the oil, added Herbes de Provence (I always add that to gravy) and more salt and pepper.  Even using Silk Creamer, it all turned out super yummy!

Ok, so what I did with this was a little different. I hammered my steak to make it tender ( I had tip breakfest steak) then in the flour mix I put Italian Seasoning, pepper, salt, a little sugar ( just experimented)  and I used olive oil instead of lard. I put about a tablespoon of Warchcure sauce in the egg batter, and dipped the steak a couple of times to make sure it was covered in the batter and flour mix. Then, for th gravey I just used a packet we had here "homestyle gravy mix" with about 1 and a half cup of milk and 1 cup water, the whole things turned out sooo good. My husband loved it! We had it wih biscut, has browns and corn. :) Thanks!

This was very good and tastey.  I also followed the advice of a previous reviewer and fried in a stick of butter.  I think it would be a better hearty winter dish, but it was tastey and I'll make it again, but not often....it is a heart attack on a plate!!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!!

FABulous!  Followed another users suggestion and cooked the meat in a stick of butter instead of lard.  Buttery delicious!  My husband raved about this too.  Would definitely make more often - if it was a healthier meal!  :)

Mmmm...I used pork cube steaks as I had those (I'd never tried them before) but used only about 3 tbsp. of flour (low-carb) after dipping in the egg. The crust actually turned out pretty of good. For the gravy, I sauteed about 2 tbsp. finely chopped onion, about 1 tbsp. of flour and used cream instead of milk. I have, however, decided that I prefer the beef over the pork cube steaks. Thanks Patti, this one hit the spot!

I give the original recipe only 3 stars because it lacks a lot of flavor.  I added spices to the gravy and the breading to make it taste better which I would give it a 4.  But even after that I would definately make a different gravy, because the gravy even after adding spices was really bland.  The steak was good though!

At first i was hesitant as to how it would come out.. but it came out great! I made it for my husband on valentines day, and he loved it. Will definitely make again.. although it was a little time consuming it was well worth it. Also like another reviewer mentioned, i used some garlic in the recipe as well and it added to the great taste!

This is very good.  I made a few changes only because my husband was really craving this and I had to use what I had on hand.  Instead of steak I used the frozen pre-made hamburger patties, and suprisingly, it was really good.  I also doubled or even tripled the gravy, and we used it on potatoes as well as dipped biscuits in it.  It was really good, next time I will use the steak as suggested, I'm sure it will be even better, but the patties do work in a pinch!

Yummy.  Good thick, light crust.  Suggest doubling gravy.  I served with hashbrowns and broccoli.  Apple slices would be nice compliment.  Beware!  I burned the holy livin' day lights out of the roof of my mouth.  That crust really holds in the heat.

Classic comfort food. I always add a bit of garlic and a bit of cayenne for a slight kick. I have served these to guest by cooking up the steaks and layering them in a crock pot on warm setting, whooping up a batch of gravy and pouring it over. Very good!

I have made this MANY times!  I use shortening rather than lard but that's the only alteration.

This was an awesome recipe. The only thing I changed was just like other people stated, I added a chicken boullion to the gravy and it turned out beautifully. My fiance and I enjoyed every bit of this and I still have leftovers. I am excited about lunch tomorrow. This recipe is definately a keeper!!!! Thank you.

Very good version of country fried steak, and it was so easy to make.  The gravy turned out perfectly.  To keep the steaks from getting soggy, I placed them on a cooling rack to drain, with paper towels under the rack.

I combined this recipe with another that was nearly identical and overall it wasn't bad. The bad case of diarrhea I developed I concluded was from buying the "managers special" package of cube steaks that was left out in the cereal aisle and not in the meat section. At least I think it was cube steak

This was just ok. I didn't use lard because I didn't have any so I used oil. Maybe the lard would give it more flavor, I'm not sure. Don't think I'll make this again I've had better ones from this site.

Although I did print out a couple of chicken fried steak recipes from this site I basically followed this one. Looking at all the recipes I could not find one that really put a good mix of spices in the breading that I really liked so I looked to the reviews and followed one reviewers advice to put in a mix of paprika/cayenne/garlic and onion powder/salt and pepper. It turned out pretty well, keeping in mind that as a reviewer noted, it is not supposed to be bursting with flavor. I also used canola oil in place of the lard and since I could only fit in two at a time due to the size of my pan I used 1 cup for the first two and added another 1/2 c. for the second pair which I did give time to heat up before resuming. One slight problem I had with the gravy, whose pepperiness I loved, was it began to separate after about 10 minutes in the pan. I do not have any experience with gravy so I do not know if this is normal but all I had to do was mix in some more milk. Next time though I think I will be more careful that I am only leaving 2T of fat just in case I left too much this time. Served with mexican corn from this site, a salad, mashed potatoes and rolls this was a very filling and satisfying meal.

Made this tonight for dinner.  Didn't turn out like I had hoped.  I like a nice, crispy coating.  However, I lack good frying ability so probably any recipe wouldn't be crispy.  Also, the gravy was not that great.  I make milk gravy for other things and it turns out fine, but I really do think the problem tonight was mine, not the recipes.  This was an easy meal to prepare and I will try again.

Couldn't be easier! I did add a little garlic powder as a matter of personal preference and I needed about 1/4 cup more milk to get my gravy to the perfect consistency. My husband loves his country fried steak peppery so this was really perfect. Also, this freezes and reheats well.

My husband loves chicken fried steak, so I decided to fix this for him just recently. He raved about it, though I added a bit more salt & pepper to mine. I have a large (14") cast iron skillet that was my grandmothers and used that to cook them in. Will definitely cook them again with a few small changes: double the amount for the gravy and spice the breading up a bit for mine.  Thanks for the great recipe Patti!!!

My husband often orders country fried steak when we eat at "mom and pop" restaurants as it is a favorite of his.  When I read the reviews decided to try it. I had never made a successful pan gravy until I made this. I substituted Crisco for the lard (bit lower in cholesterol)and used cubed sirloin patties.  My husband loved, said the gravy was like what his mother made on the farm when he was a kid. Will make it again, for sure!! Thanks, Pattie

This recipe is delicious. Even my husband, who is a very picky eater, loved it. The coating on the steak turned out very crispy. In parts of the country I have lived in, it is known more as "Chicken Fried Steak".

This was very time consuming and messy to make.  It turned out greasy tasting. I followed the direction so I am not sure what happened.  My family did not like the taste or flavor and I will not be making this again.  The only thing that we did like was the gravy.

I,tried this recipe twice giving it a fair chance however,it lacks flavor and the lard well tried it once with and one without and you really don't need to use it. However,you may want to add more pepper & salt for some flavor.

I'm not sure if I did this right... the gravy came out really bad so I didn't use it.  Luckily i had a gravy mix to use.  The steak was ok but needed more flavor.  Like I said, maybe I just messed it up here...

Yummy, yummy good!  I was afraid to try this (my first attempt with a different recipe was a disaster), but I was very pleased with the results.  My husband kept thanking me over and over for making one of his favorite meals.  I too added more milk.  Gravy... mmmmm....

This was really good. I will definitely make again.  Even picky, finicky, and pickier (my kids) ate it without a gripe. Thanks!

We've made this over and over since I first reviewed this recipe, and it's still delicious. We've also used it with boneless porkchops (pounded thin) and boneless skinless chicken breast.  The kids loved it with the chicken so much they now prefer it to McNuggets! Now THATS a great recipe! Thank you a million times! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!

This recipe was not good at all.  It really was a waste of good ingredients, especially the steak.  I will never be making this again.  I followed the recipe exactly too.  Maybe we didn't like it because we are from the west coast of BC and not the south, I don't know, but I do not recommend this recipe.

Yucky. The gravy tasted of lard and it took a LOT of seasoned pepper to cover the taste!

It also took a long time to make the gravy - be careful your steak doesn't get cold in this time.

I had never attempted gravy before, so I was somewhat skeptical.  However, it turned out great!!!!  Lots of pepper....just like my mother used to make.  Gravy was very thick, so I just added milk until I got the consistency  just right.

The gravy in this recipe is so easy and good. Watch you don't let it cook for too long or else it will get to thick like mine did. I just added more milk and my problem was solved.

It is exactly what it is described as - easy country fried steak.  I will likely make some changes for personal preference next time (a little more seasoning) but it was easy and turned out fine.

I put a teaspoon of Allegra, a pinch of garlic salt, a little sage and black pepper on each steak before flouring. Floured both sides. Cooked in hot iron skillet. Removed, put milk and more pepper in the same skillet. Whisked until thickened. Place steaks covered in gravy in a greased pan. Sprinkled additional milk, cooked at 350 for a hour. Served with green beans.

This is a fave in our house, but the cubed steaks from our supermarket are such a poor cut of meat I have get out my pointy meat mallet and pound the heck out of them or they are very tough. We like the gravy over rice.

Great basic recipe for chicken fried steak! I never know what to do with cubed steak and this always pleases the whole family. Thank you for using lard - I did also consider using bacon fat for frying. Maybe next time I'll try! Yum.

We enjoyed this.  I made a different sausage gravy and served the meat with hash browns.  I made a few changes.  I added a teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder along with just a touch of salt and lots of pepper.  I cooked it for about three minutes on each side.  It's not as good a greasy spoon deep fried but it was close enough.  I'll make it again.

First time making anything like this. My family enjoyed it. I used regular cooking oil instead of the lard. I didn’t have any and was not going back to the store. Turned out a little bland, but we fixed that with some salt. Overall a good meal! I’ll make it again.

These are good directions and ingredients to use. I did not go by the amounts of ingredients because the steaks were much larger than usual. I am saving this recipe for use in the future.

I am a fresh out on my own 20 year old, so I knew what I wanted to do as for the seasonings for the steak (Nature seasoning and Accent, It turned out wonderfully.) For the flouring however, I noticed by doing the way the OP suggested, it made the steak  breading thicker, so with thin cubed steak, you know  it takes away the flavor a bit. So One pass of the egg and one of the flour and in the oil it went.  This is is a good recipe.

Loved the taste! The steak could have been a bit more crispy. I substituted canola oil for the lard. I will definitely make again and make sure my skillet is up a few degrees.

The right temp to fry makes all the difference on the great finish to the round steak I cubed old style with my meat mallet!  I used a vegetable oil and a cast iron skillet for a perfect country fried steak...hubby said it beat any restaurant dish he has eaten!

I made it my family loved it. I did make some brown gravy by request of my daughter, so we had 1 skillet milk gravy and a skillet with brown gravy. Homemade mashed potatoes and cream peas was perfect side dishes with  of course biscuits. Thanks for a change up.
Will definitely most definitely  will make again.

This is a simple easy recipe. I did marinade in some wine salt and olive oil the day prior, then dry. But the lard made the difference. I’ve never used but wow, much better taste. No wonder most restaurants use it. I also cooked some chorizo and added to the gravy to make it super heart healthy!

The steak was great. I did not have any luck with the gravy. It was my first attempt at a homemade gravy and it turned out very thick and flavorless. Willing to try it out again. If I make it again I will add more salt to the steak.

Great recipe! I did add salt and pepper to one side as I took it out of skillet. Gravy was good, too, but I added more milk because I like a lot of gravy!

I've been making this for years BUT I didn't take that extra step of dusting the meat with flour BEFORE and after dipping it into the egg.  Now that I've tried it, THIS is the way I will be doing it from now on.  Turned out PERFECT and the milk gravy was easy peasy too.  Two thumbs up!

There's one caveat though, the first batch left part of the crust stuck to the bottom of the pan so I used a spatula to remove the next batch and viola, perfection!

Amazing recipe. I've wanted to prepare this for awhile for my husband. Finally did and he said he prefers this to my normal cubed steak method (just flour.) I left out the pan drippings (we were impatiently waiting & when I've included them before, it turned into brown gravy) but it still turned out great. Will cook again soon!

No lard (have never used it) so fried in vegetable oil. Medium-high heat was too hot- burned the first batch of steaks in under 3 minutes.  I ended up adding some garlic and onion powders for flavor.  Dredging and re-dredging made my meat fall apart before I could even get it in the pan (I let it sit 30 minutes in the fridge prior to cooking, hoping that the topping wouldn't fall off). Bottom line: tasted good but what a mess. I can't fry chicken either, so please don't take my criticism to heart; I just don't do well with recipes like this.

I prefer country fried chicken, but country fried steak is pretty good. I make it every now and then to change it up from the normal boring ideas. I don’t have lard on hand and don’t feel like going out to get it so i used coconut oil which left no coconut taste whatsoever. I’m not a huge pepper fan so I don’t use what they say, I used a pepper grinder a few times on each steak. Also when making the gravy same thing. I used butter for the gravy along with flour to make a rue. Thinned our with more milk to the thickness I was looking for. This is the 2nd time making it and with the changes I made after I did make original recipe. I feel it’s better. 1 some sort of oil verse “lard” 2 pepper to your liking 3 rue for the gravy. This is a simple meal yet delicious.

Would like to give this 4 1/2 stars. Pretty easy and straightforward recipe. My first venture into "southern" cooking. A couple alternations - I didn't have lard, but I had some goose fat in the freezer from Christmas, which worked very well. Also, had just milled some barley flour for another project, so used that instead of all-purpose. Both added some nice flavor and texture. As other suggested, I added a little garlic powder and paprika to the flour, too. Good flavor to the meat and the coating. The gravy was delicious (made 1.5x recipe), although needed more pepper than I gave it. Will definitely make this again!

Followed the directions to a T; did not work for me and wound up using a packet of country gravy (Thank goodness) but the meat itself was so I don't even know just no Bueno:( I'm thinking it was the lard.

This is pretty good as written but I had to add garlic powder and seasoned salt to bring it up to where we liked it. I've made this twice and had trouble with the gravy both times. It's probably me, but next time I'll use  a packaged gravy mix.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't measure anything except for the 2 eggs, but I used this recipe as a framework to make the country fried steak and gravy that I remember growing up with. I added a little seasoned salt to the dredging flour and cooked the steaks in olive oil instead of lard. I also made much more gravy than the recipe supplies for mashed potatoes by adding much more milk (a little at a time to avoid clumps). I thickened this by taking some thin, stretched gravy into a coffee mug and adding about 1:1 dredging flour to gravy in the coffee mug, mixed until uniform, and then reincorporated the rue back into the gravy as needed to thicken it the way I wanted. It came out perfectly and this recipe definitely comes out with the nice white gravy I remember. Remember to beat the meat out thin so it will cook right and have the right proportions of meat to breading. The more you stretch the gravy, the whiter it becomes and still has perfect flavor (as long as you are careful not to burn the flour when you first put it in the oil. Remember you aren't cooking the flour. You are just mixing it with the oil, giving it a minute to get incorporated properly, and then adding milk before it browns. Authentic recipe. Thanks!

This food is the bomb! I made it a year ago and forgot how good it is until tonight when I made it again. Doubled the gravy , cut the milK to 1 1/2 c and added 1/2 of whipping cream. That gave a little bit of sweetness. Also had potato and celery root puree and buttermilk biscuits from this site. Very, very delicious meal.I figured this is a  once a year meal so GO BIG. Still smiling.

I made this recipe but I found it very difficult to make the recipe with the cube steaks. I looked online a bit and found that some recipes can be altered to use round steak (cut and pounded thin) instead so I wonder if that would work better/be easier? Also, maybe it was just me, but I had difficulty getting the gravy to thicken.

This one surprised me.  I am not a fan of cube steak as it's always so stringy - however, my hubby loves them so I decided to give it a try.  Surprise, surprise it was good and very tender.

This is my first review here and I had to say Thank You ! My husband loved this dish and I enjoyed trying my hand at homemade gravy. I had some frying flour that I used for the dredging and actually had lard on hand that I had never worked with before but it turned out very well.

You need a little more grease and cook at 375,so it doesn't soak up grease while cooking. I use flour-eggs-cracker or bread crumbs then let rest. Also I get my Meat counter guy to tenderize a few round steaks ,if they're working in back they useally won't charge extra. You get lots more meat at a great price.I eat alot so I triple the suff for the gravy and may add onions,mushrooms , ect,ect

I didn't try this recipe; I got a stomach ache just watching the video.
I much prefer my oven-baked chicken fried steak which has less than a quarter of the calories, fat, cholesterol of this recipe.
I serve it with cheese grits & the meal is awesome!
Excuse me, I have to go to the kitchen & whip up a yummy batch!

I have been making this for years for my family. I have also used very thin round steak pounded out. The only difference is I use poultry seasoning in my flour. Amazing meal.

Good recipe but for authentic country fried steak, use crushed cracker crumbs instead of flour after dipping steak in beaten eggs. Makes a huge difference!

You don't have to watch the video to get the recipe.  Below the video screen at the end of the explanatory paragraph is the recipe name in blue.  Click on it.  OR click the light gray box that says recipe.

I used kernel flour. Found by the bread crumbs in your local grocery store. No need for any spices. It has just the right seasoning and makes a perfect gravy everytime!

This is a recipe my mother (from the panhandle of Texas) taught me to make when I was 10.  She said that, until she moved during WW2 to the east coast, this is what she thought "steak" was.  Kind of basic, folks.

I really liked how the cube steaks turned out but I was not a big fan of the gravy I thought it was too greasy and I used regular vegetable oil. My dad who doesn't like greasy food thought it was good and reminded him how his dad made gravy like that when he was a kid so in the end that made me happy so that is why it got 5 stars. I will make this again minus the gravy:-)

The steak part was ok, although I used evoo instead of the traditional lard. The gravy on the other hand left a lot to be desired. I felt as if I were eating flour paste... Ended up going without gravy. Oh well will know to kit up McCormick next time!

I'm giving this a 4 because I personally hated it but my family loved it. I made this for my grandmother and great-grandmother who are from West Virginia. They both gobbled this up and enjoyed it immensely but must be more of a dish for them because I found it way too greasy and tough. I also found that the batter fell off and didn't stick to the meat. On the other hand, the taste of the breading was really flavorful as well as the gravy. I will not make this for myself again, but possibly for them. I'll search for a better recipe next time.

this was indeed excellent.  made as stated but i added garlic powder to the flour, and doubled the amount of gravy.  easy and quick to make, but dont overcook, and a family favorite.  a real people pleaser. will definitely add this to regular rotation. served with mashed potatoes and green beans.

It's good, but I gave it average rating for 2 reasons. 1. It's very bland. Be sure to add a lot of salt and pepper.
2. (And the biggest reason I gave it 3 stars), it is an absolute mess to make. It took me just as long to clean up as it did to make the dish.
Again, when a lot of extra salt and pepper are added, it is a tasty dinner. But, I can probably only have the patience to make it once every few months, if that.

This was absolutely delicious! I am a vegetarian and used my meat substitute. Delicious! I then used the cube steak to make my husbands. He loved it and talked about it the rest of the night. I didn't make the gravy the first night because I cooked meat in the skillet. The second time I made this I made the gravy. It too was delicious! The gravy came out a little thicker than I like. Will adding more milk make the gravy thinner? This recipe ROCKS! Thank you.

This tasted very good.  The gravy came out a little thicker than I like gravy, so next time I will cut the flour in half and see if I like it better.  It didn't taste greasy, I patted the meat with paper towels, so grease disappeared. Will make this again.

good recipe.  Next time I think I will try to find a more tender cut of meat or pound it a little more.

This was very good. I just used olive oil instead of lard. I also added a tiny bit of gravy mix to the gravy. Very yummy! thanks

This was really tasty, and I will make it again.  Kids were not thrilled but DH loved it.  I will pound out the round steak a bit more next time to make it more tender.

great recipe.  husband loved it... only changed the recipe a little...used left over sausage grease, with  light olive oil & canola oil instead of lard. I also seasoned the meat & flour with a little onion powder, garlic powder & italian seasoning.  the gravy was delicious..I, too, made extra by leaving 1/4 cup grease in the pan...i plan to use this gravy recipe in the future...thanks for sharing!

This was so good! The only thing I had a hard time with was keeping the breading on the meat. Other than that, it was perfect.

Not my favorite, but the bf loved it.  I thought the gravy could use more flavor.  Added garlic and onion powder to flour.

Update: made this again. Added 1 1/2 t each of steak seasoning, onion powder and seasoned salt to flour.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed a reviewer by seasoning the steak/flour with Emeril's Essence. The seasoning worked really well minus the frying lard. I don't know if there's another frying subsitute you could use to cut the lard taste out like peanut oil. Too much flour so I dredged in batter than in flour. Will not make again.

I have bad memories of cube steaks being tough.  I have not had them in many years, but due to their deeply discounted price this week at the grocery store, I decided to try them again.  I found this recipe and modified it slightly (added garlic poweder to the flour and cooked in corn oil because I don't have lard).  I cooked 4 minutes on medium heat, turned them over and 3 minutes on medium-high heat.  They came out fabulous!  I did not make the gravy at all and I was completely satisfied with the taste of them dry.  They were not tough at all, in fact they were quite juicy.  I will definitely not be afraid of eating cube steaks any longer!

This was great! It was my first time making country fried steak at home and my husband and I both loved it! I took some suggestions from other reviewers and fried them in a sick of margarine and 2T virgin olive oil. I also added a bunch of paprika, garlic, seasoning salt and seasoning pepper to the flour. I will be making this for years to come!

This recipe is great I am 14 and I made it all by its self, but if you don't use the pre-sliced patties it is so much harder. i hope to make this sometime soon. Again.

Great!!  It tasted like my grandma's.  I did use a cast iron skillet to fix it in and this worked real good.  Cast iron always makes the taste better.  Will definitely make again.

Really god and easy. Add lots of seasoning the more the better. You almost can't add to much. Gravy didn't turn out milky....more brown. But that is my fault, not the recipes

I cannot wait to try this - I've been using gravy mixes my whole life because I've never been good at scratch. But I love me some country fried steak and gravy and looks like this is a winner!

My cube steaks must be thicker that what a person normally purchases in a store as we have our own beef butchered.  A lot of the coating crumbled off because it took so long to cook through.  Didn't look like much but was tasty.  I used garlic salt and vidalia onion salt along with pepper and did not make the gravy.  I used 1 stick of butter and a couple tbs of olive oil instead of the lard and had to add olive oil a few times so that it would not go dry in my cast iron skillet.

What a satisfying meal - I would dare call this dish a comfort food!  Served with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  It so hit the spot.  I did not fry in lard.  Instead I used about 2 T. canola oil.  That was plenty for the size of my pan/steaks.

I HATE CUBE STEAK! But this was excellent, nice and moist. Wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe to a T, but when I tasted the gravy it had a flour taste so I added one tsp. of beef base. Yummy. Everyone loved it, thanks so much. I will be making it again.

Very delicious recipe, very moist and tender!  I pounded the steaks more to make them more tender and added a little more salt to the flour mixture.  Will definitely cook this again!

A good recipe, however, if making in a frying pan, the flour becomes lumpy when making gravy.   Maybe transfer drippings to a small pot to make gravy.

This method was perfect and my steaks turned out tender and crunchy at the same time!  Perfect in my book.  The gravy was good too and I used non-fat milk.  I did use a lot less lard than called for but the flavor was still great.  Thanks for the great recipe Likestocook.

This was okay.  But, really kind of bland.  I probably won't make again.  It needs more flavor.

I did cut the flour to 2/3 of a cup and added 1/4 cup of panko (I measure by eyeball) to the flour and then seasoned heavily the flour mixture.  It turned out beautifully crispy golden brown.  Delicious.

This was my first time making cube steaks or any kind of country steak.  Everyone liked it.  I served with mashed potatoes.  I used butter and olive oil instead of lard.  I used garlic salt instead of regular in the gravy, which I liked.  The kids liked the steak but didn't like the gravy so much--it got very thick sitting on the dinner table.  I will probably make these again.

Really good. I used bacon grease instead of lard, and I cut way back on the pepper. Oh, and my cube steaks totalled a little over 1½ pounds. I found that the breading got a little soggy by the time the gravy was ready, and the gravy kept thickening (even with adding over ½ cup of water to thin it out) while I got the dinner plates ready. The steaks were awesome (although not so crispy) and the gravy was good (although a little goopy), but it was very yummy with mashed spuds and brussels sprouts. Thanks for sharing, LikestoCook!

This recipe was very easy to use. I just made mine a little lower fat! I used a large skillet to cook the cubed steaks in. I also did not use eggs. I used egg substiute instead (works exactly the same, just less fat and calories) and I used a couple table spoons of extra virgin olive oil instead of lard.  It all turned out crispy and the gravy was super delicious too!

Very good recipe.  I made it for supper with mashed potatoes, corn, and biscuits.  One of my children does not eat beef so after I dredged the beef and took out the 2 T of flour for the gravy, I dredged a chicken breast and cooked it in a different pan.  All 3 kids loved the chicken cooked that way better than the beef.  Thanks for a recipe that made my hubby happy.

This recipe is good for what it is.  That having been said, I was a bit disappointed.  I was looking for more breading than this provided. The result isn't quite what we're used to when we have country fried steak.  I'll continue my search for "THE" recipe.

This is a great recipe. I have been trying to do something with the cube steaks we get every year when we butcher our beef.  This is it.  I usually make this about every 10 days and my family loves it.  It is very quick and very easy.

I made this for my family tonight, and the only change I made was I fried them in canola oil, since I refuse to cook with lard.  It didn't really do anything for me, the flavor was lacking, and the gravy was bland, but my husband liked it, so that was good, atleast.

I was REALLY nervous about these being too tough but I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect.  The coating stayed nice and crunchy and the meat was fork tender.  I did oversalt it but that's no one's fault but my own.  Delicious!

Loved this! Made it with deer meat that was in freezer and just wonderful! I placed it in a slow cooker when it was done to keep it warm and the gravy stayed very smooth. Thanks for the share

I found an old packet of cubed steak in my freezer and looked up this recipe. This is my first time making Chicken Fried Steak and it turned out excellent. I used Goya Adobo instead of salt and added chili powder and paprika to the flour. This recipe is quick easy and tasty.

YUM! This is a keeper. Only one of my eight children didn't care for it. I had to triple it for my family of ten, but everything worked out great. It's a little time intensive, but worth the effort, especially the gravy. I did add some beef boullion since my children like "meat" gravy and I didn't want to turn them off. This was a perfect addition and made the whole dinner a real hit. I'm smilin'!!

Instead of using lard, I used bacon grease.  It added a lot of flavor to the steak and the gravy.  My husband and I both thought this recipe was delicious.

I have been making this recipe forever. I have been eating it since i was a child.I sprinkle a little garlic and pepper on the cube steak and drege in flour. I use no egg. Cube steak is a little plain but the gravy makes it wonderful.I use some canola oil, just as much as i need at a time, add more between batches if the steaks soak it up.You wanna see the browned bits in the pan that is what makes the gravy. Usually I have no oil to take off. Also if I have a lot of browned bits, I will take them out of the pan and set aside, so they dont burn. I put them back in when making the gravy. Hope this helps.

There was not much flavor to this recipe.  I even added some garlic seasoning to the flour mix.  I also added an extra 1/4 c. milk to the gravy and it was still too thick.  It tasted like a big hamburger.  I don't think I will make this again.

I followed this recipe pretty close and it came out fabulous.  I had never cooked with lard in this way so I was excited to do so.  Without reading any reviews at all I just went for it and after doing so, I wouldn't change a thing.  I served it with mashed potatoes, salad, and fresh home-baked bread.  YUM!!!

Conceptually, this would be good, but I wasn't getting a flavorful result.  Needs something more for crunch, maybe cornstarch.  I used an organic shortening with non-hydrogenated oils, so it was slightly healthier.

Good basic recipe.  I made double the gravy, and it was just enough.  I also used shortening instead of lard.

I had never made gravy and my husband is picky about his gravy. So I was terrified.  Let me just say that the first time I made this gravy my husband was so thrilled that finally someone made his gravy just perfect.  This recipe is great for a beginner like me.  Thank you!!

Excellent!  Just what I wanted.  I used veg oil rather than lard and seasoned the flour with some garlic and onion powder along with the salt and pepper.  I doubled the gravy and seasoned with Tony's and pepper to our taste.

This is a great recipe.  All recipes get tweaked.  Need a bit of garlic powder in the dredge.  Increase milk to get enough gravy.  You MUST have some good buttermilk biscuits on the side (sometimes under a layer of the gravy).

Quite good.  Prepared with Crisco in a cast iron skillet, adding spices as noted by other reviewers.  Had to add an additional 1/4 c. of Crisco to prevent burning, and to garner enough drippings for gravy.  Still came out short on gravy.  Will make again, with more gravy.

Great recipe!  Instead of dredging in flour a second time I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  And I fried it in some butter and oil, although the butter was probably not necessary.  We all loved it.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have lard, so I substituted butter and a little bit of vegetable oil. I had never made country fried steak, and this recipe was so easy! The ingredients are cheap, easy and the meal cooks fast. I had an entire meal made in less than half an hour!

This was great! I finally made gravy like my mom's. The steak was flavorful and the breading stayed on great. My husband and his friends really liked this- thanks so much!

Great! My picky 4 year old had two helpings! I tasted the gravy prior too serving and it was a little bland so I added extra pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to taste and that made it perfect. I also added some butter to the drippings before making the roux. My husband, 8 year old and 4 year old all said this recipe is a keeper! I served it with mashed potatoes and asparagus! Yum!

I wasn't crazy about the gravy. It came out kind of sweet tasting. I added  gravy browning/seasoning and it only marginally helped.  I just don't think a milk gravy goes well with country fried steak.

I searched everywhere to find a recipe for this.  This is good! I doubled the gravy, and fried in olive oil instead of lard.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was pretty good for making it at home!  I might play with it more when I make it again.

Hubb & guests loved it. Based on other reviews, I added salt, onion & garlic powder, baking powder and soda. I made the gravy from a packet, which balanced everything nicely.  I served with green beans, biscuits, green salad and potatoe salad.

This was decent - but I like other (similar) recipes for country/chicken fried steak a little better. I prefer adding buttermilk to the egg, along with a little baking powder and baking soda. I also mix my flour with the milk before adding it to the drippings so I don't get the lump. Good recipe as is - but I have made better.

This was yummy considering it's made with a less-than-choice cut of meat. I forgot to dredge the steaks in flour first so the coating kept falling off. Taste was very good.

My daughter kept asking for country fried steak, so I made this.  She loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.  (I used canola oil instead of lard being as health conscious as I could with fried steak) Will make again.

this is the first time I've had country fried steak and the last!!! Way , Way too much fat and not enough flavor.  If I'm eating something this fattening, I want to really taste it.

This was easy and very tasty. I didn't use lard but did fry a few pieces of bacon, then I added canola oil to the bacon grease to fry the steaks. To add more flavor I also added about 1 tbsp. of Old Bay Seasoning to the flour breading mixture and about a tsp. of it to the gravy. I will be saving this recipe to make again.

We made this for dinner tonight and it was great!  The only changes I made were that I added white pepper to the flour mixture and I deep fried it my Presto instead of using the lard.  The whole family loved it.  Bravo!

Wow!  This was sooo good.  I purchased cube steak not sure what I was actually going to do with it and read some reviews of other recipes, which were not that favorable.  A lot of people said cube steak was very tough. Well, not in this recipe.  I never made country fried steak and was so impressed with the results.  My husband loved it too. I did put some Essence (Emeril) in the beaten egg and garlic powder on the steaks and  I did take the easy route and used McCormick's country gravy mix which is also very good.  This is definately a keeper.

I have always loved country fried steak from restaurants but never thought of making it myself before I found this recipe. My history with gravy making is about as bad as it gets. But I followed this recipe to the letter (only using Crisco instead of real lard as I couldn't find any around here) and it turned out great! Even the gravy was delicious! This  is inexpensive, easy, quick and delicious! If it was a little healthier I'd fix this weekly!

This was quite good.  I used a packaged country style gravy versus making it from the drippings. Good if you want to be naughty for a meal. Definitely not a recipe for those concerned about eating healthy.

Wonderful recipe!  I've made this variation in the past, but enjoyed the twist with the eggs.  The only thing I did differently was instead of seasoning the steaks before dipping in flour, I put all my seasoning in the flour mixture.  I added a little onion powder as well.  It was tasty!

very good - used soy margarine instead of lard.  however, gravy was a disaster for me as the butter burned after cooking so many pieces of meat.

This was good.  I did end up using butter per PP's suggestions.  I definitely needed more gravy, though, b/c I made mashed potatoes to go with it.  If you're just having the steaks, the amount of gravy will be fine, but if you want extra gravy for noodles or potatoes, then plan on making more.  I would make this again.

Great recipe.  I've made minute steaks several time as this is one of my husbands favorites.  He loved this one.  I was even able to make the gravy!  This is a keeper.

this recipe turned out great.  My family liked it alot.  The only thing I changed is that i added lots more spices to the flour and gave it a kick.  The gravy needed alot more salt, but once I tasted it before serving it, and made the correction, it turned out GREAT!!!
Thank you so much for this great meal!!!

I didnt think this recipe was too bad but my family didnt so much care for it.  Makes one huge mess to clean up.  I probably wont make it again just because no one ate it but I would eat it again.

One thing that might help is to take out the sinu (sp?) the white that runs through the meat. That is what makes them tough and chewy. It is kinda hard to get out, but it makes all the difference.

I gave the recipe to my fiance to make, there was not enough breading on it for my liking but tasted decent. Probably will not make again though.

This was great!  My husband and son loved it.  I doubled the gravy as others suggested, and served it with mashed potatoes.  I will put this recipe into our regular rotation.

I must have done something wrong. I used oil instead of lard. However, the meat was very tough and no one would eat it. The flavor was good but can't figure out why it was so tough.

I am not a "cook" and I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great!  Since the other reviews said it was kind of bland I sprinkled some pepper in the flour.  Also the gravy was easy and turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Hubbie was hungry for some country fried steak, so I tried this recipe.  It wasn't as good as I had hoped.  I like the coating a little crunchier before the gravy is poured on, and it was most definitely soggy.  Flavor was good, but texture was not desirable.  Probably won't make again

I would actually rate this as 3 and a half stars - hubby didn't finish his but I thought it was pretty good.  I found the steak to be good but the milk gravy was a bit lumpy.  Served this with mashed potatoes, great accompaniment.  Will keep looking for the perfect recipe, but thanks!

I used half cup of butter, and added extra pepper for the sauce. The meat and gravy were very good. I'd definetly make this recipe again.

This wasn't very good. I don't know if it was the recipe or something I did wrong. The only thing I did different was I used crisco instead of lard. Other than that I followed directions to a T and it just wasn't worth taking a another bite. The gravy was pretty good but really thick.

Great recipe!  I also added Seasoning salt to the flour mixture and cooked the steaks a little longer for crispness of the coating.  Pretty good as leftovers too!

Delicious; tender and I love the gravy.  Very, very heavy. (As you might have expected.) Don't eat before any tasks requiring alertness. Tee hee!

I made this last night for my two roomates! It was good, the breading wasnt crispy enough and I think the recipe should call for more gravy. But other than that I would make it again for sure! THANKS Patti

Delicious! My mother always called this "Cowboy Gravy." We use the same technique for making gravy with fried chicken pan drippings. Yum-m-m.

We really liked this meal. My husband said, "oooh, that was GOOD!"  The gravy could use a little more flavor, but I used canola oil instead of lard, so maybe that would make the difference??  I definitely will make this again.  The coating on the steaks was very yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe.

We had this recipe for our supper tonight.....It was very good, and I will make this again...My husband's family is from the South, and my husband said this had that good old down home taste.. I didn't have lard, so I fried the steak in olive oil..Its hard to find lard in our area grocery store....Will I make this again????? You bet I will..Thanks Patti.

The steak was great, but it is hard to find lard in my local grocery stores, so I had to substitute it with crisco. Besides that the recepie was great.

This wasn't too good. It has no flavor. I used butter instead of lard for frying, other than that I followed the recipe exactly except I did cut back on the pepper but I don't think all that pepper would help. The crust on the meat was nice and crunchy, but this recipe definitely needs some seasonings. The gravy turned out fine, although it also lacked flavor. This needs some serious tweaking. I might try it again and jump start it with lots of seasoning, but as is, no thanks. I'm thinking maybe garlic, Italian seasoning, seasoned salt, or maybe a little Cajun seasoning.

i was not real impressed with the outcome of this recipe. the meat and even the gravy tasted of lard. the gravy also was very bland and i had to add additional spices to add flavor. however i am willing to try this recipe one more time and rereview it.
