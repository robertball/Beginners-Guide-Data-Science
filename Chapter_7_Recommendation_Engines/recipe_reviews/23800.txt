Super easy, too much salt for my taste. I used 2 tablespoons of mayo. It was ok but I won't make it again.

LOVED IT!  I think the cabbage needs to be in even smaller pieces than I did, and it probably would be a smidge better if left overnight but it was still excellent the way it was. I added quite a bit more mayo than suggested and only used half the salt. Next time I'd do more tomato and cucumber but this was a delicious, quick and easy slaw!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. The ingredient list is so simple I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I am actually not a very big fan of coleslaws and am very picky as to how they're prepared. I couldn't get enough of this - I almost ate a whole bowl by itself. If I was going to change anything I would probably use less salt next time.

Great slaw! I made this with tomatoes and cucumber that I had de-seeded (eliminated a lot of the water that can make slaw soupy). I found that I needed a lot more mayo than 1 tbsp - I used well over half a cup for 4 heaped cups of bagged slaw mix. Also, used about 1/2 tsp of sugar because I am not keen on sweet slaw. Finally, I used celery salt instead of plain because I like the flavor. This turned out to be a very tasty colorful dish that I am sure I will make again. Thanks, Bluewoulf!

I used a little more mayonnaise also and I added some dill weed and fennel seed. Great recipe and a nice changeup from the normal slaw.

This was a good mix of vegetables.  I like tomatoes and cucumbers in this slaw.  But the dressing needs something more.  I used 2 Tbsp of mayo, but I don't think adding more mayo is what it needs--maybe a litte bit of ranch dressing added to it or Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  I was looking for a slaw recipe without vinegar, so I'm trying to keep from adding that to it.  I'll definitely try this one again with some additions.

I'm not much of a coleslaw-type person, but this sounded good so I tried it...and I'm so very glad I did!  I seeded the cucumber (used 1 whole) and the tomato; used a purple onion and bagged mix that had a small amount of carrots & purple cabbage (also added  quite a lot more mayo than called for).  This made a very colorful mix!  I also don't like sweet slaws, so I tasted before I added the sugar, then tasted again after adding the sugar.  It wasn't sweeter but it was definitely better!  All in all, a great recipe and one I will make regularly!

I liked the addition of the tomatoes and the onion to the slaw, but the dressing lacked the oompf that I was looking for.  Think I will continue to look for another recipe.

This is a really good salad...may want to salt to your taste because it tastes good without any salt at all.  Even if you dont like "coleslaw" you may like this because it is milder.

This is a great recipe and it may sound crazy but the only thing that makes it better is ranch dressing. I actually used more mayo than it called for (mayo w/ olive oil) and added about a third ranch dressing to the mayo with a little sugar to tone the tartness down a little and SCRUMPTIOUS!!

this is my favorite version of slaw yet.  I have made it twice and my suggestion is select a cabbage that isn't rock hard.  The looser more green ones have a much sweeter flavor.  I did sprinkle a couple drops of red wine vinegar in the mayo, not more than that.  The first time I made it I only had the grape tomatoes so I used them cut in half, the second time I used regular tomatoes, I think I like the grape tomatoes best.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, though I did find it to be a bit salty, so I added some more sugar to try to balance it out more. I liked the addition of tomatoes and cucumbers. Overall, its probably not something I'll make regularly, but it was nice to try for something different.

8/13: The recipe lives up to its' description, it is a salad type slaw. I thought that this was a bit too salty for me (and I love salt!). This was good, but I don't think it will replace my other slaw recipes. I chopped the tomato and dried it on paper towels, cored 1/2 of the cucumber to remove as many seeds as possible before chopping and thus my mixture was pretty dry. I ended up having to use 2 TBS of mayo (reduced fat) to get this to bind together. A couple of hours later it was a bit soupy in the bottom of the bowl, but what slaw isn't? I used a 16 oz. tri blend bag of cole slaw with carrots and red and white cabbage. The presentation is very pretty. 8/7:My grandfather was a coal miner in the southwestern Virginia mines and I grew up in the Appalachian mountains. (Same guy that liked to eat squirrel cooked on the wood stove, honest!) Thanks for the post.

I love this recipe.  This really is an Appalachian recipe.  My grandmother used to make this and she lived in the heart of Appalachia in the coalfieds of Southwest Virginia.

This is how I make my slaw, with a couple of changes that make a big difference- omit the tomato and add a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.  Delicious!

This was very good.  There was very little dressing but that worked for me.  It was a little salty so would probably decrease the salt next time but will definitely make again.

I am from Appalachian Mts of VA. This slaw recipe is very familiar it was most of the time served in late summer after the fresh vegetables were harvested from the garden.. I have made this slaw many times and I will agree it has to have more mayo and also I add just a small amount of milk maybe tablespoon and maybe cut back on the sugar just a little .. It is a fun recipe to play around with .. and very good especially when the cucumbers and tomatoes are fresh from the garden!!

We are huge coleslaw fans, but weren't overly thrilled with this one.  I think it was because it called for chopped cabbage rather than shredded.  I wanted to try the recipe as written, so I chopped the cabbage.  We did liked the addition of the tomatoes and cucumber.  If I make it again, I will use a finer cut slaw.

For those that show the Saucy picture how much mayo did you use? I used 4 tablespoons of mayo just to make this have a little sauce. It was bone dry with one tablespoon and I only used 3 cups cabbage. Yikes! Flavor was great just wished it would have been healthier which was why I chose it.

This is phenomenal made with Miracle Whip and spicy mustard. I made it for a family BBQ and it was a hit. No complaints. 12 of the 13 guests complimented me on it and I have been deemed the "coleslaw person" for any and all dinners from here on out.

Good quick slaw. Next time I will use less salt as I thought 1/2 tsp was too much.

I added 2 tbs of Mayo, but it didn't taste well rounded. I ended up putting a splash of rice vinegar (I love vinegar lol) and some dill. :) I'll make this again.

This is just a dandy little recipe.  So easy, quick, and surprisingly delicious.  And, yes, one tablespoon of mayonnaise is just perfect.  Very healthy, and kids like it too!

They have this salad in my Safeway deli and they call it summer slaw, same ingredients.  I'm pleased to have the recipe so I can make it at home and for picnics this summer.

Great coleslaw! It is different than any other slaw I've had...like the author says "a salad version of coleslaw".  Will definitely make this again!

I love coleslaw and this was a great variation to it. I used lo-fat mayo and it turned out great and saved some calories, too.

I love this recipe.  I substitued Spleda for sugar and light mayo and it was a great low cal side.  I even sprinkled a few sunflower seeds and had as a snack.
