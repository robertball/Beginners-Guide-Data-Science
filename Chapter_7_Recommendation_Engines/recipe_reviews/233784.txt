Turned out great. I used my food processor with the shredding disc to grate the frozen dough. Cookies met with rave reviews at work and book club. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I thought this was excellent! I didn't have car to Mom, so I subbed in nutmeg and cinnamon. I used one teaspoon of each. I also used Christmas Jam because that's what I had. I made two 9 by 9 pans. Delicious!

This is a very versatile bar recipe as you could use any flavour of preserve and flavouring of your choice.
The recipe doesn't state pan size but I would think 9x13, I halved the recipe to bake in a 9x9 pan.
My grandmother tore the dough instead of grating it, which is what I did. 
I prepared the dough as written but mixed by hand instead of with a mixer, then I cut the dough in half, pressed the one half on the bottom, spread the jam on it then tore the remaining dough over the top. I used 8 oz jam for the half, I would use 16 oz for the full recipe or there would be barely any jam. I put the bars in the freezer while preheating the oven and baked for 35 minutes.
I found the bars a little too sweet and rich, I would reduce the sugar and butter to 3/4 cup each next time.
I love cardamom and would double it next time or I think lemon zest would be a nice addition if you don't have cardamom. My grandmother used apricot preserves and added silvered almonds to the topping.
Thanks for a tasty treat!
I made this recipe for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April challenge #ARFaceless
