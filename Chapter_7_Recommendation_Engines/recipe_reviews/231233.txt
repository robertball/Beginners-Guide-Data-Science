I'm embarrassed to say that I changed this recipe because normally I only make alterations after following the recipe at least once, but I think the integrity of the recipe was in tact even after my substitutions.  I used a full 16oz of spaghetti (broken in half prior to boiling), a can of Rotel (undrained) in place of the water, and added in 1/2c of onion and 2c of chopped spinach to the meat sauce.  I also skipped adding the cheese to the soup/sour cream mix.  I would never have made this type of dish without mmrswebb's base - so thanks for that because I have a LOT of leftovers which everyone in my house will be happy to eat!

This is even better than you could ever think it is! I love the creamy cheesy layer between the pasta and the taco meat mixture.  The corn and crunchy chips on the top add great texture.  All I can think is that this will be my new go-to casserole to take to friends and prepare for my family.  Loved, loved, loved it!

This was pretty good. Not as "kid friendly" as I had hoped. 1 out of my 3 liked it, but that is not unusual. It was an interesting combination of foods coming together. I made as is and thought it just tasted like tacos over spaghetti. My husband loved it. He loves any casserole dish.

My husband absolutely loved this spaghetti.  I added onions and red bell peppers to the ground beef.  I also included a can of black beans.  Scrumptious!  It did not need sour cream and lettuce in my opinion.

This was much better than I expected, and definitely better than it looked on the plate.  I didn't have taco sauce, so I used salsa instead, and it came out very well.  Nice creamy taste.

Really tasty dish. I didn't have any taco sauce on hand, so I used an 8oz can of Pato(mexican hot tomato sauce) instead. My husband loved it. I'll be making this again.

The only substitution I made was using black beans instead of corn. It was creamy and tasty but a bit too mild. Since one ounce of taco seasoning is what is typically used for one pound of ground beef when making tacos, next time I make I will use 1/1-2 ozs (3 tbsp). Also, if you like a lot of crunch on top, don’t stop with one cup of crushed tortilla chips!

Whoever made up this recipe and posted it should've mentioned that they have no idea what a good home cooked casserole is supposed to taste like and that they likely grew up eating generic brand Mac N Cheese out of the box. Although I think the Mac N Cheese is probably a step up. $30 not well spent.

I did make a few changes.  I put in salsa instead of taco sauce. I also substituted black beans instead of the corn.  Never have liked corn and hamburger cooked together.  I made my own cream of turkey soup as I cannot use canned soups. I did not have chicken bone broth available and I did have turkey .  It was quite tasty- even the leftovers warmed up well

This casserole is as good as it gets. I was leery of using noodles in a Mexican flavored dish but it just works. I took the advice of another reviewer and used elbow macaroni. It's just sooo yummy!

I followed the recipe but used elbows instead of spaghetti. I just thought it would be easier to eat.  It seemed weird  to add cream of chicken soup to a mexican recipe but it was so good. You definitely need to try this recipe if you haven't already! Loved it!!

This is excellent. Did not expect this to be that great. I found it when looking for a baked spaghetti recipe. Substituted hot siracha taco sauce and it made it just right.

Had to make ingredient substitutions...as everyone says this was great as written. However, we discovered we did not have taco sauce nor cream of mushroom soup.  Tend to make our own 'cream' soups, so we don't keep canned soup on hand.  We mixed some additional sour cream and chicken stock and sweet salsa and poured that over the top (before the chips layer) so it would not be dry. Worked out great, but my kids didn't like the salsa chucks in there--didn't stop them from having multiple helpings.  Also, from Allrecipes we have a taco seasoning mix that we LOVE. Way less salt and we can customize it so its not too spicy.   Great way to use up leftover spaghetti into a completely different meal.

I doubled the recipe as we have 4 teenagers in our home. So easy to make and there was only enough left over for 2 lunches the next day. That's a hit in my book. It was great.

I was a little apprehensive about this but....it sounded interesting and my 11 and 12 year old sons said " let's try it".  It's absolutely wonderful! I went a little lite on the noodles and broke them into 1/3 s before boiling.i also added a diced onion and some minced garlic to the ground beef while cooking and a little more taco seasoning (1/4 pkg). I probably added an extra hand ful of shredded cheese to the top as well as the filling, as well as extra crumbled tortillas to the top! I love it and both my boys do as well, they have both told me that this one is a keeper! I know it sounds a little strange....but some how it works perfectly!!

We all loved this! My 6 year old ate two servings both times she had it. We used light sour cream and ground turkey, both our normal substitutions to try to make healthier versions. This is definitely one to use for family visits.

I absolutely love this dish! It's one that all of my family loves...that is so hard to accomplish in my home...and it is so versatile! I could easily use any meat, frozen or canned or fresh veggies, and I can get it all done in less than an hour. It's great to make ahead and reheat too. It has become a regular meal! Thank you!

Three helpings for my husband, two for our son.  This was a hit.  Next time I will:
     use the 1.5 pounds of ground beef  (all I had at the time was one pound),
     add a small can of chopped chilies,
     leave out the sour cream,
     break the spaghetti into pieces of three inches or so before cooking and mix it in with the other ingredients, and
     increase the amount of crushed chips on the top.

I thought this was a unique recipe and exactly what we were looking for!  We like spicy so I added extra spices such as hot sauce and salsa and extra taco powder packets.  I used a bit too much pasta but that was easily remedied with extra sour cream and extra cream of chicken (so that it was all covered).  I made two large casseroles and my family of 4 made it through BOTH dishes by the next night.  It's also one of those dishes that's even better reheated!! This is one I will repeat!

Really good! Kids LOVED it even with organic whole wheat spaghetti. Great change of pace from tacos but similar flavor and the spaghetti makes it very hearty.

My whole family loved this dish, including my picky 4 and 5 year old kids!  I added red onion to the beef while browning, and used cream of celery instead of cream of chicken.  It was a hit.  I think next time I might add some red peppers to the beef and onion mix and possibly some black beans, but it was quite good as is.

I don't usually go for super cheesy, meaty recipes, but I decided to take a chance on this. I'm glad I did! It exceeded my expectations. I subbed salsa for taco sauce and used my own blend of taco seasoning. I also added in black beans, and that was a great addition.

The whole family really enjoyed this recipe!  Made it without the corn.  I cooked it for 30 minutes at 350 and it seemed over-cooked.  Cheese was slightly burned.  I'd start keeping an eye on it around 20 minutes, and I think next time I'll take it out at 25 minutes.

This was very easy to make and very good!  I did not add the corn or tortilla chips just because I didn't have them on hand.  My husband is a picky eater, and he had seconds!  I will make this again :-)
