If you're going to rip off another chef's recipe you could at least change one little thing about it before you claim it as your own. This recipe is from Anne Burrell's show Secrets of a Restaurant Chef on the Food Network and is a word for word replica of the recipe on that site. Shameful.

I do a lot of cooking from scratch these days and this is hands down one of the best recipes I have ever made. So incredibly good. The flavours are incredible the vegetable puree makes a wonderful thick sauce - even my little kids loved this one. Can't wait to make this for my parents when they are visiting.

Next time I will cut tomato paste by 1/2 and add beef broth. Flavor was quite good but consistency was too thick.

I used the exact recipe but modified it to make it in the instant pot. It was easy and delicious.
