This recipe turned out really good. This is the first time I made GF cupcakes, and I must say, it is actually better than regular cupcakes. It is moist and rising very well. I even make my own GF flour.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was my first try at baking gluten free and these were pretty tasty for gluten free! Made these for my sons birthday at school where some kids are gluten free. Nobody could tell they were gluten free and everyone loved them. I didn't put strawberries because they aren't available this time of year where I live. Did the banana slices in middle and also mashed up a little banana for the dough. Turned out great!

The taste is very good, but the banana slice was too large. The tops of the cupcakes overflowed, so the cupcake tops fell apart.
