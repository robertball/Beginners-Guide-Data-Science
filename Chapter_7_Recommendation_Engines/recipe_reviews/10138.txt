I should have looked at the ingredients more closely before I started this recipe, because the uncooked egg whites bothered me a bit.... so I changed things.  Instead of egg whites, I threw in some skim milk to soften the fudge up.  What I ended up with is a heavenly fudge frosting.  I am glad I found this one.

Years ago Nestle used to promote its "new" product, pre-melted unsweetened chocolate, with an outrageously good brownie recipe along with an equally good fudge frosting.  I think what made that frosting so exceptional was that I remember it included an egg yolk. I had  measured out half an egg from the "One Bowl Brownie" recipe, and rather than discarding the other half egg, I used it to replace the egg white in this recipe.  Just as that Nestle recipe with the egg yolk, this was creamy, silky smooth, fudgey bliss.  So easy to mix up you don't even need an electric mixer - just beat the heck out of it with a wooden spoon until it's smooth and glossy. I added just a dribble of hot water, then poured it over my brownies (one recipe is perfect for an 8 or 9" pan)  These brownies, frosted with this frosting, combined to make brownie PERFECTION.  I don't know if Nestle still promotes that memorable recipe anymore, but with this fudge frosting recipe it really doesn't matter.

Perfectly fudgy with just the right level of sweetness. Many frostings tend to be way too sweet. This one has a nice, full chocolate flavor. It develops a beautiful sheen and will do your cake, cookies, brownies or cupcakes proud. I didn't even use my mixer. Just beat it by hand for a minute or so. Be aware that it will thicken as it sets. I didn't have to add any water - the consistency was just perfect as is. No trouble with its being granular. Easy, too, with a minimum of ingredients. What more could you want? A surefire winner.

I used this frosting for brownies and it was delicious.  I think adding a bit of rum would be a nice touch also.

This is my new favorite frosting. I always stress over frosting because I don't like the store jugs of frosting and I don't like homemade frostings that taste too much like powdered sugar.  This frosting has a thick but spreadable consistency and it tastes like chocolate.  You can't taste the powdered sugar.  It has a lovely gloss like ganache but was easier to prepare and apply.  I haven't tried this cookie recipe but used it on cupcakes today.

Excellent! be careful when adding the egg whites.  Be sure to start beating it very quickly or the egg will cook and you'll have a white mess.

The taste of this frosting was fantastic - chocolaty fudge, exactly what I was looking for to top the Black Magic Cake I made for my husband's birthday.  (A double batch perfectly covered two 9-inch layer cakes).  My problem with this frosting was the consistency.  I followed the directions exactly, and even added more water to thin it out at the end, but it just wasn't very spreadable.  It hardened rather quickly and near the end of my cake, I actually had to apply it with my fingers because it wouldn't spread with my frosting spreader.  (Thank goodness I was only serving it to my husband & kids!)  I'm giving it three stars because the taste was phenomenal & it's quite possible that "user error" resulted in my problems, even though I haven't had previous problems with frosting.  I'd certainly be willing to give this recipe another try, possibly keeping it warm longer and adding even more water (or perhaps milk) at the end to thin it out even more, but I'd have to say that I much prefer the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe on this site.  It has a similar flavor, hardens beautifully and it doesn't use raw egg (if that bothers you at all).

This was my 14 year old son's first attempt at a cake and frosting.  He made this easy and delicious frosting for the cake part of the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cake I - FANTASTIC!  I saved the recipe for future use!

Not bad. I usually make a ganache, but had no cream in the house. Followed the hints from others - avoided egg white since I wasn't confident about undercooked egg, and added extra 1/2 square of chocolate. Is there any reason why you couldn't do this recipe in the microwave? Will try that next time.

My husband wanted a fudgey chocolate cake for his birthday so i went in search of frosting found this, he loves it!!! only down fall if you want to frosting a double layer 9in cake triple the recipe to get enough. Otherwise its amazing :) and to those who are worried about the egg whites just let it sit on low flame for a few minutes stirring constantly with the sugar and chocolate and the egg will be cooked into the chocolate no problem at all. My husband is lactose intolerant and has sensitivity to eggs too and he had to no problems.

Delish! I made this yesterday with a chocolate craving and two sweet-craving nieces, and I did everything exactly as it said, and it turned out perfect! Although I'm interested to try Beautsbelle's idea on milk, it sounds delicious!

I made this to frost the Dark Chocolate Bacon cupcakes from this site and it was an inspired choice.  I followed the recipe and added a tsp of instant coffee to my butter chocolate mixture and stirred til smooth before adding the rest of the ingredients.  The result was a smooth, rich, deep fudge flavor.  This is a keeper, thanks Martha!

This was pretty good. It wasn't really smooth though, even though I put some water in it like you suggested. More like grainy, as in the texture of sugar. The taste by itself was amazing though.

JUST FINISHED MAKE THIS FROSTING AND IT IS AMAZING!!! I FOLLOWED ONE OF THE OTHER COMMENTS AND LEFT THE EGG WHITES OUT AND JUST ADDED A SMALL AMOUNT OF MILK AND IT WORKED OUT JUST GREAT!! I LOVE MAKING CAKES AND HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A VERY EASY YET FANTASTIC CHOCOLATE ICING. I WILL FOR SURE USE THIS AGAIN.. BUT IN THE FUTURE I WILL DOUBLE OR TRIPPLE THE RECIPIE. IT ONLY MAKES 1 1/2C OF FROSTING. AND FOR CAKES THAT IS JUST A LITTLE SCANT!

I used this frosting to frost the "Chocolate Frosted Marshmallow Cookies" on this site and it is great!  Super-fudgey and a great consistency for frosting these cookies.  I think the egg white adds a little elasticity to make it easier to use.  I almost ran out, but just added a little water and powdered sugar to stretch it out to frost my last 3 cookies.

the taste was great I used a couble broiler and cooked at low heat the whole time.  I put in an extra teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 cup p. suger which might has been the reason it was a little runny and it was definatly not enought for a layer cake you would need to double it at least.  but it was a hit with the hubby on top of a black forest cake.

This was great!  I didn't use quite as much sugar as it called for (I live in a pretty arid climate) but I did go with the egg white.  The frosting was glossy And fudgie and yummy on my box (don't judge me!) Brownies :)

Meh, it was more like an icing or glaze than a frosting.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very runny.  The taste was good, but the consistency looked nothing like the picture shown.  Maybe if I had added more powdered sugar, it would have been better, but I was afraid it would taste too much like powdered sugar, so I left it as it was.

Since I'm a serious chocoholic the original recipe wasn't fudgey enough for me. I put in bitterweet 60% Cacao chocolate but it seemed too sweet and not dark and chocolaty so I added a 1/4 cup of Hershey's Special Dark unsweetened cocoa and bingo! It turned dark and lushishly chocolate! It cut down on the sweetness and gave it so much more depth. I will use this recipe again with the added dark cocoa. It's easy to make and spreads beautifully on cake.

PERFECT!!!  Exactly what I was looking for....EASY to make, fudgy, and smoothe.  I tempered the egg white while melting the chocolate by putting the glass I had it in in a bowl of very warm water for those who might fear "cooking" it...actually, if you just let the mixture sit a bit and after you add the sugar, not even sure the tempering was even necessary.  :)

the taste and texture were great....thin not too sweet, VERY nice chocolate flavor. But it was way too thick. I followed recipe exactly...but had to add alot of water to get it to pour/spread over my cake.

I just made this frosting for the Dark Chocolate Cake ll on this site. Great consistency, perfect for the cake! I made the recipe exactly as written; however, since I prefer dark chocolate I found the frosting WAY too sweet once I tasted it. The sweetness overwhelmed the chocolate. So, I melted 1 additional ounce of unsweetened chocolate with a bit of butter and added it to the frosting I had already prepared. It didn't change the texture and I like the flavor much better! Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy to make, but I was unsure if I should leave the frosting on the heat while beating in the sugar and egg whites.  I found it to be a little "gritty" textured, so I stuck it back on the heat to try and incorporate the sugar better, but it still wasn't perfect.  The consistency was perfect and didn't need any water.  I poured it on the cake when it was still a bit warm, and it spread very nicely over the cake.  I let it drip down the sides of the cake instead of frosting the sides and it gave it a nice effect.  It hardened up nicely and I topped it with peanut butter chips; everyone enjoyed it.

Very yummy indeed. I made it with exactly what what asked for in the ingredients. I did add a splash of water here and there in the first batch, because it seemed very dry. I beated that, and had my 13x9 cake sitting on the stove and I thought that this was not enough chocolate frosting. So, heated up the chocolate and butter and made a whole another batch! Added them both together and there we are, yummy frosting. Definiely delicious, but not something I would rave about to my friends. It seemed a tad bit grainy.

I like this recipe.  I used 2 squares of chocolate and milk instead of water.  Once I melted the butter and chocolate together, I allowed it to come to room temperature, as well as the egg white.  I added the amount of icing sugar I needed for the right consistency and it came out smooth and not too sweet.  I was using it to frost cupcakes and will definitely use this recipe again.

Really sweet.  Not very chocolatey and does not make very much.  There is definitely not enough to frost a cake inside and out.

I made this as a center layer for a chocolate and orange zest cake. I didn't have unsweetened chocolate so I used bittersweet chocolate chips. It wasn't as dark as the picture, but it still tasted great. I was told by one person that it was his favorite part of the cake!

Update: I messed up the second time I made this and dumped the whole egg into the recipe. It was still great!

Meh.  It was ok.  Not very fuddgy.  I followed exactly.  I ended up throwing it into the vitamix and adding more chocolate just to make not a waste.  It looked great but the taste was just as stated before, meh.

Just wanted to pass on a tip I picked up from another recipe: 3 tbs of cocoa powder +1 tbs vegetable oil = 1 ounce of the chocolate squares. works like a charm in this and other recipes. Perfect for Fudge cake!

Very good frosting. Once we had finished we added 2 tbsp of milk to help thin it out and that worked quite well.

I give it four stars, because it is really good, but with a couple of improvements it is AMAZING.  The raw egg grossed me out a little, so I just didn't use it. I didn't think it was chocolately enough while I was making it, so I added another oz of chocolate.  You need a double recipe if you want this for a two layer cake.  It also needed a bit of milk to make it spreadable since I didn't use the egg.  So, four stars as written and 5 with a few tweaks!

My husband and our close friend have the same birthday - I can't buy a birthday cake because our friend can not eat  dairy.  I usually hunt down a non- dairy cake and frosting recipe that he can eat and that still tastes like a normal cake.   I found a boxed chocolate 
cake mix that is dairy free but still needed a fudge frosting that would taste great for both their palates - this fudge frosting did the trick - it is amazing!!   

I didn't use the egg white either - I added an extra 1/2 chocolate square (as someone else did) and about a 1/4 cup of vanilla coffee creamer and it turned out perfect -  I doubled the recipe and realized I only needed 2 1/2 cups of the sugar.  All in all...great recipe that I will be using again for sure.   Thanks to all the comments here with substitute help is what made mine a success!

This is my new go to icing. I followed another reviewers suggestion and substituted unsweetened Cocoa powder as listed on the container and replaced the egg white with almond milk. Easy and not overly sweet. Thanks for sharing!

Super easy- 1 bowl if you use microwave. Used corn syrup instead of egg; had to add at least 2Tb milk, but once I did it got smooth and glossy. Beautiful! Double for 24 cupcakes.

Now THIS is fudge frosting! Quick, easy and sooooo delicious! My favorite frosting from now on. A quick tip: if you spread it on the cake while the cake is still warm, it will spread easier.

Delicious! & super easy. =)  I did not have chocolate squares so I used the conversion on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa powder.  It worked out perfect!  I did have to make two batches to cover a 9x13 sheet cake.

This is by far the yummiest frosting I've ever made. My changes: I used 2 squares of choc instead of 1.5, and added a bit of hot milk instead of the eggwhite while beating until I got it the consistency I wanted. It is very smooth, fudgey and delicious! Perfect on banana cake :)
