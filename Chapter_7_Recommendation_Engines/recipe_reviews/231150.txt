Works perfectly for more than just sandwich bread.  I use it for all my GF recipes both sweet and savoury.  It's better than those pre-mixed flours at the store because it doesn't have gums and especially all those hidden chemicals and additives.  Thank you Amy C. for sharing.

Buckwheat Queen suggested this gluten free flour to me and i;m so very she did. It is wonderful, i coated my fish with it and it stuck on the fish. Thank you very much Amy for this recipe!!
