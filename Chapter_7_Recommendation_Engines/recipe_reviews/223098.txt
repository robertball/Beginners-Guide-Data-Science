Hmm. My grandma used to grow tomatoes and I would eat them with mayonnaise as a plain sandwich. I like peanut butter. I figured "Why not?" This sandwich is certainly different and I'd venture to call it delicious. I don't know how often I'd want one but it was certainly worth trying. Thank you for sharing this family recipe!

I've been making this sandwich for nearly 70 years and have always loved it Peanut butter and tomatoes are so versatile they 'go with' everything. I especially like the combo with bacon deviled ham and even onions. It's a special treat with cheese as a grilled sandwich. So much flavor!

My wife introduced me to this combination 22 happy years ago the summer after our wedding. It does sound unusual but I easily fell in love with this simple sandwich. I noted that this updated recipe calls for a couple of extra ingredients (i.e.: mayonnaise & sugar); we have always just used the bare essentials - white bread a juicy tomato a pinch of salt and smooth peanut butter. We tried the recipe with the updated extras - it was indeed good and tasted similar to what we have always enjoyed; but we feel you cannot beat the original.

Well now this just sounded so off the wall I knew it had to be good so I tried it and it was delicious. Like another reviewer I added a leaf of lettuce. What an unusual but great combo.

As someone with a background in culinary arts,  this sandwich goes against everything I was taught. On a whim, I decided to try this after repeatedly hearing about it a few months ago. To my surprise, this sandwich is DELICIOUS! I have this sandwich at least once a week and enjoy it every single time!

I tried this because I love peanut butter I love tomato sandwiches and I love strange food combinations. Considering all that I was very surprised by how much I hated this sandwich! Well it was a fun experience trying it out so I guess that merits one star.

One of our favorite sandwiches in the summer. We add lettuce. Haven't tried it with sugar but sugar never hurts.
