I made this last night for DH and my mom.  The only change I made was adding italian style bread crumbs since I was out of crackers.  I used the last part of a bag of Cape Cod Sea Salt and Cracked Black Pepper flavored chips.  It was awesome!  My DH (lover of all things meatloaf) proclaimed this "the best meatloaf I have ever had!"  I swear there was a tear in his eye!  All evening after dinner he would sniff the air (it did smell wonderful) and say "boy that meatloaf was good!"  I suspect that at lunch time DH and my mom will be trying to outwit each other to make a sandwich out of the last piece.  I only hope that before they hurt each other they realize that I snuck it out in my lunch bag when I left for  work this morning. (insert diabolical laugh here)

Oh my gosh, this was incredible! I'm not even that much of a meatloaf person, but I am now. Sooooo moist and flavorful. I followed the advice of some of the other recommendations and slathered on a bunch of extra BBQ sauce under the bacon (heaven), used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crushed crackers (fabulous), upped the spices as I do with everything and only cooked it for about an hour. It was perfectly done, and everyone who ate it was obsessed about getting the recipe from me. Also, for a novice/fearful chef like me, it was super-easy to make, and hard to screw up which is always a plus.

Excellent recipe. My wife was so impressed with the way the meatloaf turned out that she wants me to continue   making it this way.I didn't use any liquid smoke because I didn't have any, but I did use both Lays BBQ chips and original Lays.And I also used Cattlemen's Classic BBQ sauce and cooked the bacon first separate from the meatloaf. Towards the last ten minutes of cook time I layered the bacon over the top and added shredded mild cheddar cheese.

This recipe rocks!  I tried this recipe three times b4 deciding on the alterations that I liked best.  I used 1.25 lbs ground Bison, not ground beef.  No onion, crackers or potato chips.  Used 1 cup plain bread crumbs.  Increase to 1.5 tsp liquid smoke flavoring.  Increase to 1 tsp ground black pepper.  Decrease to 1/4 tsp salt.  FYI for the beef lovers in your family: Bison tastes like beef only much more flavor, more intense.  Bison are healthier b/c they can't live contained.  They must eat on the free range.  Bison are leaner too.  The first two times I made this recipe, I used beef.  The meatloaf was great, but... then I did the same recipe with Bison, and the meat loaf was AMAZINGly tender, lean, tasty!  It was super great!  I bought my ground bison at the Whole Foods Market, an organic grocery chain store.

Recipe works great as is - but I use one pound of ground beef, bread crumbs instead of crackers, and no bacon to cut down on the calories. Hubby loves it. Note that you need to use a chip like Lays since higher quality chips don't disentegrate and get soggy.

WOW!, the whole family really liked this one. My husband is NOT a huge fan of meatloaf and he actually took leftovers to work. My four year old son also asked the next morning if he could have it for lunch.  I will absolutly be using this one again.  I did pour some BBQ sauce over the top then put the bacon on.  I have recommended this to many people.

Mr. LTH really enjoyed this meatloaf (me, not so much, but just due to personal tastes-I'm not much of a BBQ flavorish fan).  I made as is, except I made/cooked in a muffin tin, rather than in a loaf (cut bake time in half-about 35 min til they read 160 on a meat thermometer).  The meat mixture was a little wet/sloppy and I was concerned when forming the muffins, but they turned out perfectly.  If you enjoy BBQish tasting things, try this for sure!  THANK YOU for a great recipe!

Excellent! I doubled this recipe and used 1lb of ground pork to replce part of the beef. I did have to take the foil off the top about halfway through because my bacon wasn't browning. It still wasn't crisp by the end time (which was right on for the meatloaf), so I browned it under the broiler for a few minutes. I made some of 'that sauce' on the side in case people missed it. My guys approved!!! Thanks for the recipe!

My whole family loved it!  The barbecue sauce really makes a difference, I will add more next time.  I took off the foil and broiled it for a minute or so to brown the hamburger and it was perfect !!! A+++

First, I Didnt use Chips or Crackers, I used about 1.5 cups of Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs.  Second, For the BBQ sauce I used one called "Cattle Boyz Original BBQ Sauce".  It has a nice little kick to it.  For anyone who complains its "Too Greasy", try cooking the bacon about 1/3 of the way on a George Foreman grill and eliminate most of the grease.  I started cooking this when the lil' lady was at work, and it was about 20 minutes from done when she came in and I didnt even get a "Hello" I got a "What smells so fantastic?".  It smelled great, but the real question becomes... taste...  It wasn't dry, or moist, or crumbly.. it was perfect.  It was a bit greasy in the bottom of the loaf tray, but whatever.  This is going into my book of recipes for future use.  To recap, only changes:  Only used bread crumbs, not crackers/chips and I baked mine in a loaf tray, UNCOVERED..

Really good. I did add a tbsp. of worchestershire and 1/2 tsp. of rubbed sage. Everyone enjoyed it. I served it with Swiss Cheesy Cauliflower and homemade rolls. The leftover meatloaf will be good in meatloaf sandwiches. I'll make this again for sure. EDITED: We've made this a lot now and my kids really get into making this with me as they love crushing the chips/crackers and mushing up the mixture with bare hands. I've also made this with a meatloaf mixture I buy fairly cheap from Wal-Mart and I usually use a whole sleeve of crackers. My kids like to add about a half cup or so of shredded sharp cheddar, just because. This is for sure a family favorite.

THIS GUY APPROVES
I have always love beef but found it odd that I hate meatloaf, until now. After trying this I will never look at meat loaf the same, it was soo easy and the taste was incredible, I recommend this to anyone who doesn't like meat loaf.

I don't know if it was because we used organic, grass-fed beef (with a low fat content), but this was pretty terrible. On the dry side, very crumbly/chunky, and not very flavorful.

Love this recipe!  I used BBQ chips and Maple bacon.  I make a batch of 5 or 6 loaves, freeze them and pull them out whenever we need a quick meal.  I gave a couple loaves to friend and their families loved it.  Meatloaf haters will eat this one.

Very tasty!  This was the first meatloaf my husband and I ever attempted to make.  As a child, I really hated meatloaf night.  My mom made the "traditional" style recipe.  Yuck!  We chose this recipe because I wanted to try something different and my husband loves bbq sauce.  We followed the recipe almost exactly except we slightly cooked the bacon first and sauteed the onions in the bacon grease.  We used lean meat, bbq ruffles and added extra bbq sauce on top of the meatloaf before topping it with the bacon.  I really enjoyed it, although I'm still not a big meatloaf fan.  However, my husband LOVED it.  We both really liked the addition of bacon.  The meatloaf smelled great and the leftovers were good too.

Outstanding!  When I mentioned the word "meatloaf", my whole family wrinkled their noses in unison.  One bite of this dish changed their tune, though!  I've made this dish three times now, each with pretty substantial variations from the original recipe.  There's tremendous latitude for experiments and substitutions here.  I ditch the liquid smoke and onions due to family preferences.  Twice, I've skipped the bacon (we're dieting, alas!) and increased the spices to compensate.  The last go-round, I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I've added basil, used fresh garlic instead of powder, threw in a few pinches of cayenne pepper, and I've used BBQ chips throughout.  Every time, the results have been awesome and the family has pounced on their dinner like starving lions!  I strongly recommend making extra, because you will want seconds.  If any meatloaf survives the initial feeding frenzy, leftovers are great on sandwiches -- and they'll be gone the next day.  Yum!  A quick note: meatloaf is a greasy affair. Take a disposable tinfoil baking tray, punch a few holes in the bottom, and place another tray on the rack below to catch the drained grease.  It's important to let the 'loaf sit for a few minutes after cooking; if you cut into it right away it will be a little too moist and will tend to fall apart.  Letting it rest for a moment will give you firmer, more appealing slices.

Disclaimer: I am (was) not a meatloaf fan. Live on a farm and raise cattle, so we have a freezer full of Delicious ground beef and I am always looking to try something new. Found this recipe and I immediately liked it because it is not traditional. Made it for dinner (no changes) and WHAM, I am now a meatloaf lover. All the ingredients meld together in just the right way to give it great flavor and excellent, perfect texture. Took off the foil tent the last 15 min, then stuck under the broiler for just enough time to crisp up the bacon. OMG!  Made scratch gravy using beef bullion, garlic salt, cracked pepper, flour and water, and added the pan drippings. (there is very little fat in our beef so grease is not an issue) Wow! What flavor! Served with mashed potatoes. DH and I each had a couple slices, he took leftovers in sandwiches and I warmed up for my lunch. I am a convert and will share with everyone I know, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Best meatloaf recipe I have found so far. The only modifications I made were less onion(my husband doesn't care for onion too much) and  I used 1/2 cup BBQ chips and 1/2 bread crumbs. I will definitely make again!

This was such a great recipe! The loaf was moist and had great flavour. I used crushed croutons instead of crackers and didn't have any liquid smoke so I threw in some smoked paprika. Also, I tool the foil off for the last 15 minutes of cooking and the bacon got all nice and crispy.. this is definitely a keeper.

This is the most flavorful meatloaf I have made in a long time. The only thing I would do different is take the tin foil off 15 mins. before it is done.

My husband has said over and over that this is the best meatloaf he's ever had, better than his moms! (yikes) lol I omit the bacon (I know i'm crazy) and used breadcrumbs instead of crackers and chips. Also added a touch of worcestershire sauce and sauteed the onion before putting it in the mix. DELICIOUS! The combo of bbq sauce and liquid smoke...omg. You go girl ;)

This was very good. My husband was very pleased by it, and he normally does not like meatloaf. He had a friend over that night, and he too really enjoyed it! They both thought the best part of the entire meal was the bacon. Haha. All I did differently was to use Italian style bread crumbs rather than crushed crackers. I followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. My ultra-picky husband even went back for seconds! One thing I did was use BBQ Kettle chips, I think it added a great taste and texture. Will definitely make again!

Finally! A meatloaf with flavor! I took the suggestion from another review that used the Kettle sea salt and pepper chips and used Ritz crackers. Took it to a church meatloaf dinner. Everyone loved it! Next time might reduce the salt a little or try a lower salt chip. Overall very good!

OMG -- This is Great.  Love the liquid smoke flavor but be careful not to go overboard.

Esay to make. My first meatloaf and it came out perfect. I didnt use liquid smoke as I didn't have any. Instead of topping it with bacon slices I used bacin bits inside the mix and on top...my guy really did approve! This will be the meatloaf recipe I use from now on!

Guys, this one is very flavorful and moist!. I followed some of the suggestions of other reviews and used bread crumbs instead of crackers, and also used minced garlic instead of the powder (one full teaspoon, a couple of cloves). I also slathered on some barbecue sauce on top before the bacon. I used Famous Dave's sweet & zesty bbq (my personal favorite), and removed the foil and cranked the oven to 400 for the last 30 minutes. This browned up the bacon nicely, and carmelized the bottom a bit. Delicious! Hint for those who own stoneware: I always use bacon or meatloaf to season my new pans. You will never have to add grease or spray to them again! This recipe will definitely be requested by my family over and over!

I will admit, the smell is AMAZING, and the taste is ok. I think I prefer a more traditional loaf. However, my teenager liked it. I didn't get word from my husband, so I'm going to assume it was just "ok" for him too.

I will try to make it once more, perhaps adding some sauce to the top under the bacon, cooking the bacon a bit first, and not mixing it so much. I believe I made the texture such as it was by over-mixing. I've been told that is a no-no.

My husband had been out fishing all day and when he walked in the door and smelled the meatloaf cooking, he said, "Wow,what are you cooking?  It sure smells wonderful"  He was really pleased with it and had two helpings. I roasted potatoes with it and served with corn and sliced tomatoes. Delicious!!!!!

I liked it! I followed the directions almost exactly except I spread extra BBQ sauce on it before I put the bacon on, and I left the foil off for the last half hour (The bacon was cooked nicely).
 
Next time I will put more BBQ sauce under the bacon, maybe cut down a bit on the chips/crackers (texture wasn't meaty enough?) and maybe add a little pre-cooked bacon into the mixture itself! 

I will also put the foil on a little more tightly as the edges almost burned (When I took the foil off the last thirty minutes I placed a strip of foil around the edges to prevent them from burning.)

My husband does not like meatloaf, but he will eat this even leftover.  For leftovers I use gravy and mash potatoes and he eat every bit. I have never been able to serve him leftover meatloaf until this recipe.

This is the 3rd time I've made this meatloaf.  I found I didn't have any potato chips, but I did have tortilla chips and I used them along with the crackers.  Works just as good as potato chips.  I also upped the liquid smoke to a full teaspoon.  DH loves this meatloaf.

Very guy friendly!  The boyfriend didn't know that he liked meatloaf until I made this.  We usually use cheez-it crackers and either potato chips or sun chips (Harvest Cheddar flavor).  Turns out GREAT every time.

This was great!  I don't really like meatloaf, and I loved this.  I mixed a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground turkey.  I followed the recommendation to add extra bbq sauce under the bacon.

I made this tonight and my husband loved it!  I don't like onions though, so I used onion powder, also used italian breadcrumbs; and a pinch of crushed red peppers.  Will definitely use it again!

Great Meatloaf! I used 1.3 lb lean ground beef, 1/2 onion chopped (which turned out to be a bit too much), 3/4 c seasoned breadcrumbs (which ended up being not enough) instead of potato chips and crackers, and the rest was the same. I followed pursuit of the other reviews and slathered on bbq on top before covering with foil, and about 10 minutes before the hour was up, added some fully cooked bacon. Then put it under the broiler for a minute to crisp it! 
Came out too moist, like wet, i think due to not enough breadcrumbs. STILL Very good! Definitely will attempt again soon!!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I have had guests over for dinner and everyone raves about it.  I can't remember how many people have asked for the recipe - but a lot of my friends are single males, and a lot of them have! It's awesome!

This Was ok, but we like more of a traditional meatloaf.  I kind of look at it like if you want bbq, then eat a brisket, not a meatloaf.

I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out mushy in the middle, burned around the bottom & sides, and appeared under cooked on top. I took foil off at an hour and a half, then broiled for a few minutes. After broiling, the Bacon and top looked better, but for me the texture was still mushy. My husband liked the un-burnt parts though.

EXCELLENT! My husband finally told me he didn't like my meatloaf, so I was out to find something new.  This did it!  I only had 1 lb of gr beef, so I simply cut back a little on the crackers and chips and everything else I kept the same.  Simply the best meatloaf I have ever had...the bacon added a nice extra flavor.  Will make many many more times ~ THANKS

This was good, but seemed a bit 'soft', maybe it was the chips. I will try it again because the family liked it. I won't put the chips in next time, they didn't add much flavor and it will cut out lots of salt and fat too!.

My boyfriend and I loved the flavor of this recipe but would make some tweaks next time.  We followed the directions except to uncover it for the last 15 minutes.  Next time I make it I may put it on parchment paper because the bottom got a little more cooked than we like.  I would also skip the bacon.  It made it a little oily and the top didn't get the nice crust to it.  I will increase the cracker amount slightly so it holds together a little better.  The flavor was excellent and I can't wait to make it again.

Absolutely delicious!  I wasn't sure about the crushed potato chips and crackers, but it ended up being an awesome meatloaf!  The only thing I changed was after the meatloaf was cooked, I took the bacon off and added more BBQ sauce on top. Stuck in back in the oven for about 10 minutes and that was it!  Thanks for this recipe.  I will be cooking this again!

The best! I make mine without the liquid smoke, omit the salt because the potato chips and crackers have plenty, and increase the cayenne pepper somewhat. I've been making mine with Moose or Venison. They come out moist, hold together and ever so tasty. Also makes great meatloaf sandwiches.

My boyfriend said, "eh" when I said I was making meatloaf for dinner. Once he tried it, he had 2nds and then ate a 2 servings for lunch the next day! I also thought it was super delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! I did take the temp though and took it out at 160 instead of just going by the time.

Made this twice now. Added two dashes of worchestershire and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Also used Loaded Baked Potato-flavored potato chips. Left the bacon off. We love meatloaf and this is the best we have ever had.

The overall concept was interesting, but the recipe fell flat for our family.  I may try again using tips from other users (like cooking bacon beforehand).  Flavor was great but it fell apart and the bacon was not crispy.

I love this recipe though I left out the extra salt and crushed crackers, I felt the chips gave it enough salt but of course I try to maintain a low salt diet for my husband and I. He loved it!

Would have had 5 if it weren't for the saltiness...and I like salty.  Because of the potato chips and the crackers, not to mention whatever is in the BBQ sauce AND the bacon, there's PLENTY of salt.  Saltiness aside, it was delicious.  It had my boyfriend's eyes rolling to the back of his head in pure mouth pleasure.  =)

This is a very good recipe and a favorite.  Great meat loaf is moist and dense, tender yet firm. Other readers have mentioned that their meatloaf was greasy.   I found tips in Better Homes Cookbook a long time ago:  *  Key Point: Don't handle the mixture too much. Use your hands to aerate the meat. Excess handling will compress the meat, making the meatloaf tough. * For a nice crusty exterior and moist interior, don't use a loaf pan to hold the meat during baking. Use broiler pan or rack greased and lined with foil, top and bottom to cut on the mess. Cut slits through the top of pan to allow the fat to drain away as it bakes. Form the loaf first in a large round mold that your meat will fit in, flip it over and place on rack. When meatloaves are placed in a loaf pan, they tend to steam instead of bake. * Use an instant read thermometer! (You know why!) Cook beef and pork loaves to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F; ground chicken and turkey to 175 degrees F. * Cook chopped and diced vegetables before adding to the ground meat. The internal temperature of a meatloaf, while safe to eat, doesn't get hot enough to cook vegetables so you'll get a strong taste of raw onions, garlic, and carrots unless they're cooked first. * For best texture, don't use more than 3/4 cup of filler ingredients per pound of meat. Filler ingredients include chopped vegetables, bread crumbs, crushed cereal, oatmeal, etc.  Good Luck!  I hope this helps.  Meatload doesn't last at our house.

Wish we had more stars for this recipe.  I have a husband who loves to eat but refuses to give a compliment on anything.  He absolutely loved this meatloaf & in two days there was none left even though I made a pretty big loaf.  Everybody sit down...he said he really loved it & would I make this meatloaf from now on.  I about fainted...  Thanking you so much for this great great recipe.   Mary Jane

This may be a 5 star recipe, but I didn't have any potato chips or liquid smoke (can never find that in my store), so I used all crackers.  This was tasty and very moist.  I threw in a couple of cloves of real garlic too because you can never have too much garlic!!!

We stepped up the ingredients a bit since dealing with 2 lbs of meat. The biggest suggestion is to use a wax paper lined loaf pan and pack the ingredients into it. Turn it out on the baking sheet (with a rim) otherwise the juices will run off into the oven. I used mesquite BBQ and mesquite liquid smoke. To contrast the mesquite I used maple flavored bacon slices. The only drawback was the mess it made on the pan. I will use leaner meat on the next try.

Great recipe!  For a twist however try ground venison INSTEAD of ground beef!!  Also, try oatmeal instead of crushed crackers and potato chips.  Lastely, instead of plain barbeque sauce try a combination of Heinz 57 sauce, honey and brown sugar as your sauce!!  Oh, one more-FRESH crushed garlic INSTEAD of garlic powder!!!  That would be my only suggestions, the others ingredients I already use!!!

I love this recipe. I had never found a meatloaf I liked before and I wanted to try something for my husband and it was an instant hit! He loved the bacon and it was very moist. I found myself looking at the crackers and potato chips like what's that? So, I've since substituted the for about a cup of plain breadcrumbs so the texture is even.  I definitely recommend this recipe and every time I serve it to someone new, I get great compliments!

Everybody loved this. I didn't have that much grease and it wasn't really mushy. We used funyuns for the chips. Next time though I will sprinkle in some cheddar cheese.

Very tasty meatloaf, even better the next day! I used "Famous Dave's" BBQ sauce and even poured a little over the top. The only drawback was cutting thru the bacon on the surface. Unless you have a VERY sharp knife, the bacon kinda slides around while you're cutting. Otherwise, the guys in my familglia approved, too!

This was truly an awesome meatloaf!  I took the suggestions left by others and used seasoned bread crumbs and slathered the top with barbecue sauce.  Also doubled the recipe and added peeled, sliced in half russet potatoes along the side of the meatloaf (cooked in a big lasagna pan).  I think we've found our family recipe for meatloaf with this one!

Not to say this recipe was bad but it wasn't great, for that is why there are different colors in the world for peoples taste, but I enjoyed it none the less. It was moist and flavorful and little to smokey  but that could have been me I think I added a little more liquid smoke then I should have. goes great with garlic mashed potatoes and a side of green beans or corn on the cob. I recommend trying it. It just might be to your likeing. You will never know if you don't try it. ENJOY!

I have made this more times than I can count and it is a family favorite.  I always leave off the bacon coating (to chewy for my taste) and will often use breadcrumbs, crushed croutons or more crushed crackers instead of the potato chips (since we usually don’t have any.)  The smoke flavor seems to be the magic ingredient that makes this so yummy.  I have even made this for school potlucks and kids love it.

I'm with Marianneh on this one - I was expecting something really excellent, and was disappointed. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the loaf fell apart when I sliced it. I didn't think it was flavorsome at all, and ended up smothering it with bbq sauce. I won't be making this again, but thanks anyway.

This meatloaf is incredible!!  I top it with ketchup before cooking it, and then turn on the broiler for a few minutes right before it's done to crisp the bacon.  Can't say if it's "guy approved", but my 2 year old daughter and I gobbled it up, so it's definitely "girl approved"!!!

The barbecue sauce makes this meatloaf sweet. I left out the liquid smoke (family preference).

This meatloaf is really good. I used bq potato chips and cr.cheese nips for the crackers. It was really different from my usual meatloaf in a good way. I double the recipe and freeze one.

I HATE meatloaf but this was something else! It was so good and spicy and delicious that I didn't even know I was eating meatloaf. I usually have to drench meatloaf in ketchup to gag it down, but with this I ate it as it was...no ketchup needed. Definitely approved by this guy.

My husband loved this recipe! I mixed the bacon into the meatloaf as I used ground turkey and wanted to add the extra flavor in. I also baked the mixture in muffin tins; helping us keep our portion sizes in check. Thank you Angie for posting this recipe; my guy definitely approved!

I think meatloaf is one of those dishes that is a just a springboard for adding your own flavor flair. I really like this recipe because it introduces BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and bacon, (both big winners for the dudes in your life). The dry crumbs/chips can be substituted for whatever works for your tastes, I used cornbread crumbs and it was fab! Also we like a little heat so I added red pepper flakes, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, and 1 tsp creamy horseradish, also added a few tbsp of milk to make it easier to mix. Adding extra BBQ sauce on top is an absolute must!

Great, my family liked this a lot, better than a ketchup recipe.  The only sub I used was I added Smoked Paprika, as I didn't have Cayenne.  Loved this, will use a lot, I'm sure of it!

This was really good! I didn't have any onions, only onion powder, nor did I have liquid smoke, used Worcestershire sauce in place. I was a little short on Lay's chips too. So I have to do this recipe again. I only had Kraft honey barbecue sauce.
I will definitely make this recipe again with the ingredients listed here, since I enjoyed it, even though I was missing some key ingredients! Thanks a lot Angie!

This dish was delicious and moist.  I went back for seconds!  I followed the directions as indicated however I made the following substitutions/omissions:  2 lbs ground beef; omitted crushed crackers; substituted with seasoned bread crumbs; used Wise onion & garlic potato chips - the rest was the same.  I also cooked for a total of 90 minutes covered and 30 minutes un covered to allow for the bacon to crisp.  Served along with mashed potatoes (or yellow rice for me!) and green bean/corn mixture.  Perfect.

This was my first time making meatloaf and figured this would be great since my boyfriend LOVES barbecue sauce.  I made it almost exactly as the recipe states only I exchanged the crushed crackers for seasoned bread crumbs.  I was a little disappointed because I had lined the tray with tin foil and the bottom ended up burning and sticking to the foil.  Despite that, it was DELISH and I will definitely be making this again. :)

This was not good.  The crackers & chips made the meat the texture of cereal--could not really taste the meat.  The Smoke & BBQ Sauce was way too strong for Texans.  We could not eat it.  Different tastes for different folks I think!  I take 90/10 sirloin (good) meat, add about 1/3 cup Pace Picante sauce, 1 egg, crush about 10 saltine crackers--salt, pepper, garlic power to taste.  Mix.  About 350 for an hour and a bit--5-10 more minutes.

I gave this a 3, my boyfriend gave it a 4 star rating. Like others, I used bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I also skipped the salt, seeing as the kettle chips I used seemed saltly enough.  I also removed the foil for the last 10 minutes and turn the oven to broil for the last 5. The meat loaf was crumbly and didn't hold together well.  Also, I recommend the loaf on a rack, so it doesn't sit in its grease. I'll probably make this recipe over traditional, but I wasn't "wowed".

neither of us was crazy about meatloaf but in an effort to make ground beef into something more exciting than hamburgers, i tried this recipe. i really loved the idea of the smoke but i didnt have any so i found a substitute of 1part maple syrup 2 parts worshestire sauce works great and didnt have bacon or chips on hand so i used bread crumbs & melted cheddar on top. i really loved the sweet smokey flavor, i will be using this flavoring on beef from now on and he no longer hates meatloaf :)

I'm a meatloaf lover and this is now my very favorite.  I made it exactly as directed and it was perfect.  The flavor is smokey with a mild taste of barbecue.  I used ground chuck that was very lean but next time I will place the meatloaf on a raised rack so the grease can drip away.  I will make this many times in the future.

One of the best meafloaf I've made in a long time. The bacon really adds some nice smoky flavor. I used bbq ptato chips to enhance the flavor and this turned out great. I will definitely make again.

You have to try this recipe! I was a little unsure at first, but it turns out maaarvelous, darling! I used bbq kettle cooked chips so they were extra crunchy to start with. I also reduced the smoke flavoring by half bc I wasn't sure how potent the taste would be. Other than that, I kept everything the same. It was a huge hit around the table.

I really liked this recipe, but I'd probably change it a little the next time I make it. The liquid smoke taste seemed a bit heavier than I liked, so I'll probably eliminate it or put less in next time.  Also, if you cover the meatloaf with foil, the bacon won't cook very well, so you might want to uncover it the last 1/2 hour or so to make sure it cooks thoroughly. I just laid the foil over the top and it wasn't cooked, so I had to broil it for 5-10 minutes after the rest of it was cooked just to get the bacon to brown. I will definitely be making this recipe again though, we all loved it.

Sorry, WAY too salty. With 1 cup of potato chips, 1 teaspoon of salt and bacon on top, that's all I could taste was the salt. I even used bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers. If I had used saltines, I'd probably be in the e-room.

My hubby said it was ok but I thought it was bleck.  Needs much help.  Very firm and not very juicy at all.  It is the kind of Meatloaf that gives meatloaf a bad name in my book.

5 stars for sure. COOLMOUSE, I loved reading your review. "DH" HAHAHAHA. But seriously, this is the BEST meatloaf recipe I have ever found. As is (perhaps a LARGE pinch of cayenne) and broil at end to crisp bacon a bit. No need for the foil tent.

My husband doesn't really like meatloaf, but I wanted to give this one a try because of all the good reviews. We both thought this was just OK. To use my husband's exact words, "it's good if you're really hungry but it's still meatloaf."  I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good meatloaf...the best I have made so far.  I used dried minced onions and after cooking, I removed the foil and broiled until the bacon was crispy.  Be careful about cooking on a baking sheet.  The bacon grease dripped on the bottom of my stove and caused a lot of smoke.  I finished cooking in a shallow dish.

My first attempt at making meatloaf! I didn't have any bacon, so I left that off. My husband liked it and says that he wants it again.

This was both the easiest and hardest meatloaf recipe for me, considering that I have never before made meatloaf. In all seriousness, this stuff is awesome! The only things I did differently were to "start" the bacon and then put it on with about 15-20 minutes left. I also added some shredded sharp cheddar on top with about 5 minutes left. WOW, that is about the only word I can think of right now. Thanks for the great recipe.

I finally found a Meatloaf that my kids will eat.  My husband who doesn't care for Meatloaf either said that it was very good.  I did bake the bacon in a separate foil lined cookie sheet for about 15 minutes and then removed it from the oven and put on paper towel lined dish to drain some of the excess fat.  Towards the last 15 minutes of baking I poured some barbecue sauce over it and layered the bacon on top.  It was just a little greasy but most had already drained.

I am a Huge meatloaf fan and have tried several recipes, and I believe this is the BEST. The only changes I made, was using a mixture of ground pork and beef, A1 teriyaki in place of the BBQ and liquid smoke, bread crumbs instead of potato chips and crackers, and I added fresh Garlic, gound mustard, and I made sure the whole laof was wraped in the bacon which sealed in all the juices... also for crisper bacon I uncovered the laof for the last 15 min.  My best friend took seconds and leftovers, and she "doesn't like meatloaf".

I really liked this meatloaf.  The only changes I made: I used fresh garlic instead of powder and used 1 canned chipotle chile in adobo for the cayenne (next time I'll use at least 2).  I also did not cover with foil when baking since I like the outside very brown.  I always bake my meatloaves on a broiler pan with foil in the bottom for easy cleanup.  It held together very well but was somewhat dry.  I used a thermometer, so I don't think I over baked it but my meat was probably too lean.  This recipe could be very different depending on what beef (cut and percent fat) is used and the flavor of the BBQ sauce.  I also got WAY more than 3 servings out of this, more like 5-6.  I'll be making this again.

This ended up very greasy.  Next time, I think I'll skip the bacon and make a glaze on top instead.

i tried this meatloaf because it got a very good rating. but i have to say it had a lot left to be desired. neither my husband and myself really liked it. i followed the recipe to the t, but it was just bland. nothing special. i much prefer meatloaf that is a little more moist and with a saucy topping. plus with all the trans fat from the chips and the crackers and then the bacon on top, it's  not what you call healthy. sorry

This was a good recipe and my husband loved it!  He especially loved the bacon on top.  That's a good addition to the recipe.  The only down sie is that hours to cook it was too long.  I checked at an hour and it was well done.  Next time I'll only cook it 45-50 minutes.    Other than that it was great!

This turned out great the first time, and the third time. The second time I forgot to cover it losely with foil and, believe me, it sure did make a difference.   So, Ladies, don't forget to cover that meatloaf while cooking.

Wow!  This meatloaf made the whole house smell yummy!!!!  Easy to assemble and great tasting!  I will definately save this recipe! Oh, I used 1/2 pork and 1/2 ground beef, and didn't cover with foil until the last 30 minutes so it would brown the bacon and make the top crispier!  mmmmm   mmmmmm   good!!!!

This was packed with punch. DH made me swear not to lose the recipe!  Used Jalapeno Potato Chips,  Ritz Garlic with Butter crackers and Jack Daniels Spicy Western Chargrill Grilling Sauce.  Loaf held its shape very well without a meatloaf pan - placed it on top of a wire rack over 2" deep pan to let the bacon grease drain off.

I liked this recipe but I was out of potato chips & used crushed corn flakes. My husband wasn't crazy about it so next time i'll leave out the cayenne pepper & it will be great for me & to bad for him.

Well, this is interesting.  I know I reviewed this, 100% positive; but no review here.  Summary:  My "guys" weren't a fan.  I don't remember any more details except that I thought these might be better as burgers instead of meatloaf.

My husband and our friends from Italy loved this.
I was so glad to have made this for our dinner.  I wanted to make something authentic to America and this was perfect.

Made this last night for my men...they loved it and so did I.  The only change I made was to omit the liquid smoke. Used Club Crackers as one reviewer suggested, and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  The bacon was not quite done at the end, so I removed it and painted the loaf top with BBQ sauce, and crisped the bacon separately back in the oven....will definatly make this one again.

ok, been looking for a good meatloaf recipe.  I combined another idea to this one, made the recipe as is (loved the chips, adds calories but hey, this is meatloaf!) added some worstechire and apple butter to the mix.  Also didn't pre cook the bacon, put some BBQ sauce on the top and then laid the bacon over it.  Cooked for about an hour covered in foil and about 20 minutes uncovered.  Awesome!  even my wife liked it and she hates meatloaf!

Ummm... this is not one of my favorite meatloaf recieps on here (sorry!). Made this on Sun. to have for dinner last nite. My fiance pre-heated the oven & when I got home from work, all I had to do was pop 'er in. I must say, this is INSANELY easy to prepare (a HUGE +). I did not enjoy the texture (too dense / dry) or (lack of) flavor, however. So, here's a little history on this one.... I tried making this last winter. I asked my fiance to bake it (left instructions), but didn't tell him to remove the meatloaf from the dish I had set it in. I also didn't specify the need to allow "resting" time b4 cutting. Needless to say, our meatloaf was oily mush. :( This time, I had none of those issues, but regardless, I won't be making this again. I was hopeful that using a good quality BBQ sauce (Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy) & my favorite s&p kettle chips would take this over the top, but oddly both didn't matter. NOTE: Be sure to cover your meatloaf WELL!!! My bacon was nearly burnt! I think you could wait until the last 15 min. of baking time to add it, and in retrospect, I wish I would have. Oh, and be sure to cook your loaf to an internal temp. of 160 degrees. Upon sitting, it will continue to cook a bit, reaching it's well-done temp (170). Thanks for sharing, Angie. :-) I'm still a fan of Brown sugar meatloaf (tangastar) and think it is by far, the best meatloaf I've tried on here.

Have enjoyed so many recipes from here. We did not care for this at all. My guys- husband and son, certainly did not approve. Am rating after following the recipe to a T. Ho hum, bland, soggy bacon. Waste of time and money.

This recipe was very good. I have only ever made one recipe for meatloaf that was given to me by my mother. Pizza Meatloaf. But I was willing to try something for a little variety. Very good recipe.

I tried this recipe for my son who doesn't like meatloaf.  I thought it would be different but he said it tasted like every other meatloaf he's had.  I thought it was okay but my husband, who likes pretty much everything, didn't like it either.

My husband just loves this recipe and quite frankly, so do I. The liquid smoke adds a great smokey flavor to it and the barbeque sauce is so much better than using ketchup. It is so easy to make too! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delicious meat loaf recipe.  I decided to try it in my moms new bean pot.  I formed it into 2 small loaves and it cooked for just one hour that way.  I transferred it to a baking dish and broiled it for about 3 or 4 minutes after it finished cooking to crisp the bacon.  I used 1/2 cup crushed bugles and 1/2 cup crushed potato chips instead of 1 cup crushed potato chips.  Also, used italian style bread crumbs instead of the crushed crackers simply because I got tired of crushing things.  Otherwise I did not change anything.  I would say it is my 2nd favorite meat loaf recipe.  My first being one I just submitted to this site today.  Porcupine Meat Loaf

Gross.  Most disgusting "meatloaf" I have ever tasted.  Did not like the smoke flavor.  I would give this recipe zero stars but the rating system doesn't allow me to do that.

Just another recipe that proves my family and I do not like meatloaf.  I tried it because of the barbecue sauce and bacon, thinking it might be different.  I made pretty much as is except I increased the seasonings and put barbecue sauce on top and it still had pretty much a bland meatloaf flavor.  We had to spray it with ketchup to eat it.  Don't be fooled, my guy did not approve this meatloaf!

I made this last night and followed the directions to the mark, it was wonderful!!!  I won't say it's the best meatloaf ever, there are just too many ways to make meatloaf, but it is certainly up there with the best of them.  All I added was BBQ sauce under the bacon from some of the other reviews I had read and I used Lays BBQ chips...this is a great recipe!!!

This was the best meatloaf I've ever eaten! So much better than the plain old meatloaf that either tastes like just hamburger or like onion soup mix. The only change I made was I used 1# ground beef and a 1/2# ground pork.

I followed the recipe for this meatloaf exactly, and while the aroma when it was baking was amazing, the taste was a letdown.  Won't make it again.

My 15 yrs old son, who is not fan of meatloaf, gives this 5 stars!  We like it a little spicier and add a little more liquid smoke, but otherwise, leave the recipe alone.

This was a great recipe.  The guys loved it and me as well.  The BBQ sauce and bacon added flavor that everyone loves but hadn't experienced in meatloaf before.  For sure one I'll do again.  (Note: I didn't use the liquid smoke flavor).

I added 1/2 of a green bell pepper , chopped, 1/4 cup Ketchup and 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce instead of 1/2 cup. I used very lean ground beef , I have to say this was the best meatloaf I have ever made. I will definately be making this recipe for meatloaf , from now on.

Our family loved it (including 3 children)! I broiled it the last 3 minutes to make the bacon crispier. The house smelled amazing while it was cooking! Certainly will make this again. I'm sure it will be requested.

My husband loves meatloaf, so I wasn't really excited to try this recipe. I didn't tell him about the ingredients that give it such a good barbeque taste (one of his favorites), so it was funny to see his face light up when he took a bite!

This is the BEST meatloaf ever!!  YUMMY! I made exactly as recipe states except for seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crackers and put BBQ sauce under bacon.  One hour cooktime was perfect.  This is my new #1 meatloaf recipe!

Made it AS WRITTEN.  I am a BIG meatloaf and BBQ fan so I was disappointed in the results. Mine came out a bit mushy. It is possible I used a bit more than 1.5 pounds of ground meat since I was using two packages we had in the freezer. We might not have divided up the packages exactly evenly so it's possible I used closer to 2 pounds of meat. I don't know if that would have made such a difference or not. The texture wasn't horribly bad but it didn't hold together the way my wife's recipe does--hers is more 'solid'. The main problem was the taste. I suppose the brand of BBQ sauce might have an effect of the taste but we just didn't like it. I cooked it covered for 1/2 of the time and then took the foil off for the last half so the bacon crisped up nicely. That was a really good part of the recipe--we have never tried putting bacon on a meatloaf before. I think we will keep the bacon idea and go back to my wife's recipe. Thanks for posting though.

This just replaced our favorite meatloaf recipe.  OMG, this was excellent.  I didn't find any of the flavors overpowering (I did use a bit less liquid smoke but otherwise followed recipe).  Did need to uncover and put on top rack of oven for the last half hour to thoroughly cook bacon.  I was concerned it would dry out---not at all, and the crispy ends were everyone's favorite part.

I used seasoned bread crumbs in place of crackers, used closer to a cup of BBQ sauce and put more on top under the bacon. I also used more seasonings (as I always do) and used dehydrated onion as I was out of fresh. My husband loves my meatloaf but he loved this as well. He said it was a pleasant change and said he would like this made again. I loved it as well. I served with mashed potatoes and whole kernel corn. Very good recipe!

Too bad there are only 5 stars available!!!  My hubby & I LOVED this recipe!!!  Substituted cayenne 0epper with red pepper flakes, as I was out of cayenne.  Still came out wonderful!!!  I'll never make meatloaf any other way again!!!

I think I would use catsup (ketchup?) instead of barb. sauce.  It was a bit too strong to suit me.

WOW!  My girlfriend finally let me make meatloaf for her.  I made this recipe as listed and used Brooks Bros. BBQ sauce.  It came out AWESOME!  And since it met her approval as well, this meatlof is officially CHICK APPROVED too.

This was just ok for me not much for flavor in the meatloaf itself.  Didnt change a thing except for added more bbq sauce between the meatloaf & bacon.  Mom was right, she makes the best meatloaf & we'll stick to her recipe, although we will top hers with bacon & bbq sauce next time.

This was a big hit with my son and his friends.  I followed the recipe except i used pepperridge farm herb stuffing.  I used a sheet pan and lined with foil, sprayed then made my loaf.  I added cubed potatoes, seasoned them with salt & pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was my first attempt at making meatloaf and my husband says it's the best meatloaf he's EVER eaten. He ate it that night and made 2 meatloaf sandwiches the next day. I will definitely be making this again...and it's SO easy!!!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it lacked flavor. I didn't notice any flavor coming from the sour cream and onion baked chips and from the Ritz crackers. Husband loved it though. I ended it drizzling it with real maple syrup to enjoy it better.

Loved it!  I use baked chips, and they cooked up fine in the recipe.  It's a great twist on traditional meatloaf, and everyone I've made it for has loved it!!

This came out so yummy, family loved it. Made it with mashed potatoes and gravy, on the side. Although it did come out rather greasy. Made it with BBQ flavored potato chips instead of regular and you can really tell a difference. Next time I'm going to go a little easy on the onions though. Hubby was picking them out. lol.

It took closer to 2 hrs to cook, but was very tasty when it came out.  I ended up removing the foil the last 15 minutes and it came out perfect.  Worth the wait though

The only reason I'm giving this recipe two stars is for the bacon on the top.  Otherwise, this was bland, boring and a lousy texture.  My husband did not like it!

Good but definitely needs some alterations. 
 There was a ton of grease and I was glad I used a pan/dish instead of a cookie sheet. Next time I might try to lay down a little foil (lightly sprayed w/cooking oil)  loosely over a rack that overlays my broiling pan so that the oil will drip into the pan and not sit and soak the loaf.
    I don't think it needs the bacon.  My hubby agreed and requested next time I do it with the traditional ketchup or more bbq.  The loaf was a little mushy in some places, maybe from the grease.  I was able to salvage this by eating a baked potato with it and mixing my potato bites with the mushy bites. 
   I might try this same recipe one more time, but without the bacon and trying to manage the mushiness.

This was pretty good.  I thought that I would be blown away with all the awesome ingredients and textures but it was just ok.  I'm not a really big meatloaf fan so maybe that was the issue.

MY GUY DEFINTELY APPROVED :) The name says it all :)   
I didn't have a couple things so I substituted however I can't wait to try this again with the original ingredients.  We loved this.  My hubby ate almost the whole meatloaf in a 24 hr time frame..eek..he loved it and he's not crazy about reg.meatloaf.
Here are my changes:
 
1 cup crushed potato chips (I used corn flakes)
1 pinch cayenne pepper ( I used 2 pinches)
6 slices bacon (Omitted due to having none on hand)

This tastes so good fresh baked :)  Thanks for posting this.  It is our new meatloaf recipe.

My husband is not a meatloaf lover, but he really likes this recipe.  I used honey bbq potato chips and a sweet bbq sauce because that is his favorite kind but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was a real hit, even with picky kids!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was outstanding! Read the reviews and some said it was crumbly...so I used breadcrumbs instead of cracker/potato chip combo...I also used 1 pound hamburger meat and 1 pound of ground venison. I cut the bacon in half and browned it a little before baking the loaf. Cut in half and laying across skinny ways makes it easy to cut the loaf into slices to serve it! I also made a glaze of bbq sauce, ketchup and brown sugar and brushed it over the top and let it cook the last 10 minutes!!! Truly amazing! Didn't even have leftovers!!!

I really was excited about this recipie and maybe it was my fault because I did not exactly follow the recipie to the t. That is why I am giving this one four stars. However, I just thought it was a bit too smokey for my taste. My fiance, however, loved it almost more than anything I have ever made. So I guess it is guy approved, but I think I like my meatloaf more on the sweet side. Maybe if I made this again, I would use Honey flavored bar-b-que sauce instead of Mesquite.

For Thanksgiving this past weekend, all the traditional meals were already being cooked so I decided to do something out of the ordinary and make the Guy Approved Meatloaf. Let's just say it should be called Everyone in the Entire Family Approved Meatloaf.

I followed this recipe to a "T", but was a bit disappointed. It was quite crumbly, had okay flavor but not great like I was expecting. The bacon was a nice touch, but probably won't be making it again.

Very yummy! My family loved this recipe, and I have two picky boys, so thats saying alot. Didn't have any leftovers. I couldn't find the liquid smoke at the store, so I just used a smokey bbq sauce, and I also forgot to cover the meatloaf with the foil and it still turned out good. I don't think ill ever make meatloaf any different after this one, its highly recomended!

This is really good.  I use 1/2 tsp pepper, but keep everything else the same.  My husband and I are not big meatloaf eaters, but this is a keeper in our house.

Hubby claimed that 'it was okay - for meatloaf'.  BUT, I noticed that he ate 2 helpings at dinner and warmed up a huge plate of it the next day for lunch!  Thats as 'guy approved' as it gets in my household.  Definitely a keeper!!

Even though my husband like this, the rest of us didn't care for it. With all the great reviews I had to give it a try.  It is different from any any other meatloaf recipe I've tried. Thanks anyways.

This had a great flavor. I was worried I wouldn't like it without a sauce on top but the bacon came out crispy and was very good. I cooked mine on a baking stone from pamperd chef. I will make this again for sure but will cook it a little less. I think it was probably done at 1 hour. Thanks for the new twist on meatloaf.

A keeper!  I added shredded sharp cheddar, cut back on both of the crushed items (I thought it made the loaf too moist), 2 tsp horseradish, 1 tsp mustard (dry) and fresh garlic.  VERY picky father-in-law ate 2 helpings and took leftovers!

I didn't have liquid smoke, but I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce which is kind of smoky and the bacon was rosewood smoked so I don't think I needed it. I forgot to add the garlic powder and  but this meatloaf still was terrific!! My huband and my brother were raving about it! This one has made it into my recipe box and into my monthly dinner rotation!

The name of this recipe is right.  My husband is not a big meatloaf fan but he really liked this one.  I did tweek it a little the first time I made it using jalepeno potato chips and more cayenne pepper.  The second time I made it I used store bought bread crumbs and cubed up some hot pepper cheese as well.  It was yummy..

Great meatloaf! I didn't like the fact that it didn't have a glaze. I took some tomato sauce, mustard, bbq sauce, A-1 steak sauce, honey, brown sugar and I mixed it all in a small bowl ~ spread that over the bacon during the last 20 minutes of cooking. Turned out super!

I don't like meatloaf, but this one I would make again!  I used part pork and part beef, but it really was a delious meatloaf!  Rave reviews and my husband thought it was a great twist to an old favorite of his.

Very good and very versatile.  I used jalepeno potato chips and this was spicey and fabulous!  Next time we'll use Tim's Cascade Cracked Pepper chips.  Although my meatloaf came out just a little dry, I think it was the type of hamburger I used, and maybe I could have cut down the cooking time.  Smelled wonderful while cooking and the shape held great on the cookie sheet.

Pretty good, but a little too sweet for my taste. Hubby thought it was really good. I'll make it again, but next time I cut back a little on the smoke flavoring. I really loved the bacon on top, that tasted great. Definitely a different kind of meatloaf. :)

The cooking time was off for my oven, so the bottom of the meatloaf burned.  I would DEFINATELY make this recipe again.  Everyone loved it, even my EXTREMELY picky 4-year old son.

Both my husband AND I approved!  :)  We grilled it (indirect) with charcoal and wood chips, which I think really enhanced the smoky flavor.  I can't say that I could taste the potato chips, but *something* in there was making it taste awfully good!

I found this meatloaf everything BUT traditional.  I followed recipe using Original Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce. I put it on a foil covered rack that was in another pan to keep it from sitting in any grease.  I found the texture to be different and I believe the next time I will omit the  potato chips & crackers and use oatmeal.  I turned on the broiler the last couple of minutes to make bacon crispier.  I thought it had great flavor but was not to my boring husband's liking.

I love meatloaf but sadly my 12yo doesn't. I thought he might like this, but it didn't win him over. I used the servings tool to reduce dry ingredients for 1lb of ground beef (4 servings). I kept the seasonings the same though. Mine was very loose and crumbly, but I think that was my fault. I didn't want it tough, and I think I just UNDER-handled it and didn't pack it quite tight enough. I would definitely make it again for me.

Followed the recipe, but with 3 changes.  Left out the liquid smoke, precooked the bacon and then cooked the meatloaf in an electric smoker for 4 hrs at 200F.  
Outstanding.  
Had to precook the bacon as past experiences with uncooked bacon in the smoker is it cooks, but not crispy, just sort of flat and soft.

My meatloaf recipe is very similar to this one minus the chips.  One meatloaf night several years ago ( we were in the middle of a move hence being out of staples) I realized I was out of anything to use as a binder. No bread, no oatmeal, bread crumbs or crackers. The only thing I had on hand was a bag of Nacho cheese Doritos. What to do?? Crush the Doritos and use those of course! It was one of the most spectacular flavorful meatloafs I've ever made.  To this day it's one of my 3 primary meatloaf recipes I make.

So, my mom and I love meatloaf, but my dad hates it. Oddly, he still loves meatballs, and meatloaf is basically a large meatball, but that's besides the point. Anyways, I ran out of BBQ sauce while making it, so I made my own, and it turned out pretty well. I used club crackers and cape cod potato chips. This meatloaf had raised my appreciation to a whole other level, but my dad still hates it. Oh well. While the meatloaf didn't live true to it's name, I love it, and will definitely make in again (When my dad isn't here =])

This meatloaf was great. Like others, I used Lays BBQ chips. My husband ate almost the entire loaf in one sitting!

I've made this a couple of times now.
The first time I used ground venison instead of beef - definitely something I'll do again the next time I have a chance to get my hands on ground venison. As a lean meat, this preparation with the bacon wrapped around it made the whole meatloaf nice and juicy and flavourful.
The second time I made it with a ground beef & pork mixture, and since I was planning to use it for work lunchboxes, I portioned it into balls, wrapped each ball in a slice of bacon, and baked it in a muffin tin (baking time was about 40-45 minutes this way).
Other than the substitutions on type of ground meat above, the only changes I made to the recipe were that I brushed additional barbecue sauce over the bacon layer and used kettle-style potato chips because I happen to prefer those over regular potato chips.
Both preparations yielded nice results. This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe idea thank you for sharing!

I used 2 pounds of meat.  Eliminated the bacon. Reduced the BBQ sauce to 1/3 cup. Added a teaspoon of adobo seasoning,  1 teaspoon of mustard, 1 more teaspoon of garlic.

Great recipe, approved by this guy.  I used half-85% and half-93% ground beef  for a bit less fat and spread some Jack Daniel's original bbq sauce on top.  Cooked the bacon partially before baking meat loaf.  And, after making a special trip to the store for Liquid Smoke, pulled a typical duh-hh and forgot to add it to the mixture. The meat loaf still came out great.

I've made this for the BBQ and it was so good. I didn't have liquid smoke so I used a smokey BBQ seasoning and I also lined the foil with BBQ sauce and a sprinkle of smokey BBQ seasoning over sauce before laying down bacon and meatloaf roll on top. This created a yummy BBQ glaze over it. Was devoured at dinner and leftovers went missing thru the night-no one will own up to eating it.. Making two next time:)

It was OK, but my family likes traditional meatloaf better.  I am surprised to read that "most guys" don't like meatloaf!  I find they gobble it up!  Anything with catsup...

First time around, I made as stated only leaving foil off last 15 min. to crisp up bacon...it was amazing, and Picky Teen Son & The Hubs raved!  Made again tonight, only doubled entire recipe & added some crispy FF onions and 4 good dashes Worcestershire. So, SO GOOD!  Am hoping there is some left for lunch tomorrow, but...terrific recipe - thanks, Angie!

OMG, this was a great tasting meatloaf.  I followed the ingredients to a T.  I did double the receipe and still used 1 onion and 6 slices of bacon.  I doubled the rest of the ingredients.  For the last 10-15 minutes I removed the foil and broiled the bacon so it was crispy.  My husband is not real fond of meatloaf and we have a lot of ground beef that needed to be used so I was looking for something different and this was it!!!    Yummy!!

We tried this recipe months ago and it has become our family's first choice for meatloaf. I only had bacon bits for the top, but it was still excellent. Just had it last night and my husband commented on how tasty it was. Definitely a KEEPER!!

This was my very first meatloaf. I made a few minor adjustments according to some of the reviews (italian bread crumbs, bbq & regular chips, and slathered bbq sauce under the bacon), and it was a HUGE success. I am just getting around to this cooking thing and this really boosted my confidence! My hubby DEVOURED his serving and, I think, is already planning his attack for tomorrow! :o)

I made this for my fiance because it was the only way I could get him to eat meatloaf (I knew he couldn't say no to bbq sauce and bacon). It was the only meatloaf he's ever liked! I didn't use any liquid smoke b/c I didn't have any. I also forgot to cover the loaf with foil ... oops! I covered it the last 35 mins and it turned out just fine. Bacon was nice and crispy. I do think I'll use a little more bbq sauce next time. Great recipe!

Like many, I have a very picky family.  My son and I loved this meatloaf.  My husband isn't a big fan of BBQ flavor and my daughter turned up her nose before trying it. I put sauce under bacon, and cheddar cheese on top.  I'll make it again for my son and me and the picky ones can eat grilled cheese:)

My husband said this is the best meatloaf he has ever had (and he is a big meatloaf lover and has had many years of experience).  I made exactly as written. (with the exception of removing foil half way thru cooking)  My crackers were Cheddar Jack Cheese-Its and BBQ sauce was Kraft Spicy Honey.  My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe!

This was really good but I think it was too moist and soft. Maybe next time I won't use as many crackers or potato chips. But I also sauteed the onions in garlic which I thought was a great idea. The BBQ was a good change to the traditional meatloaf and it had a lot of flavor. My "guy" really enjoyed it. A good side dish that we made with this was "Chuck's Favorite Mac & Cheese." Try it!

Thought this would be absolutely wonderful and it did smell great cooking.  But it didn't have the finished taste I was thinking it would!  Dissapointment!  DH said he likes our other 2 meatloafs Much Better.  (Brown Sugar Meatloaf & Divine Meatlof)
Soo won't be making again!  Sorry!

YUM!  I love my mom’s meatloaf, but I have to say I’ve got a new fave!  The liquid smoke scared me, only because it’s been overpowering in other recipes, but this was perfect!  I had leftover sweet-n-sour meatball sauce (chili sauce and grape jelly), and chose to use that over Cattleman’s Ranch; also skipped the bacon (I had to buy 80/20 meat and was worried about the excess fat), but used the extra sauce w/ brown sugar to coat the meatloaf every ½ hour.  I used Ritz crackers and Pringle’s Cheddar chips (stale – had to get rid of them!) and I LOVED it.  Would use the bacon on a better ground meat, but as it was – AWESOME.  Thanks!

This meatloaf was guy and gal approved in my house! I followed the recipe exactly using ground pork and it was delicious.  I would recommend removing the tin foil for a few minutes at the end of the cooking time to brown the bacon. Thank you for a great recipe

This is definitely GUY approved...hubby loved it. Of course, as with most recipes, I couldn't make it as is...I changed a few things to go with what I had on hand and our personal tastes: I used seasoned bread crumbs in place of the crushed crackers, I didn't have the full cup of potato chips, & used less liquid smoke & pepper.  To tweak next time, I will coat the outside with a thin layer of BBQ sauce before laying on the bacon.  I also didn't cover with foil since I cooked it convection.

We're a family that likes to occasionally have meatloaf, and this version is a big hit.  My brother was visiting, and he's a meatloaf fan.  He preferred this version and took the recipe home with him.  I may not fix it any other way again.

The bacon didn't crisp, so that was disappointing. I also didn't care for the flavor of the bbq sauce. My husband enjoyed it better the next day as a meatloaf sandwich.

Didn't care for this dish. The liquid smoke was the only flavor that came through. I will stick to my regular recipe with a homemade BBQ glaze on top.

My husband loooooves this meal. None of it goes to waste. He'll eat leftovers with the same gusto as the first serving, and especially likes a meatloaf sandwich on whole wheat bread.

I don't eat beef, but I made this for DH and he liked it a lot, he said it reminded him of brisket? But because he doesn't like ketchup this recipe worked out great, I had the same problem as some of the others-it did not hold together very well but I guess the taste was good because all of the leftovers got eaten!

This was "okay"...wanted to try somethign a little different then my tried and true recipe. I used one pound italian spiced ground turkey (as I did not have regular) and one pound ground chuck. I also substituted Mesquite Doritos for the chips thinking the mesquite would add a smoky layer to the taste. Leftovers were much better then the day of!

Better than some I've had, but I think I'll stick with my own recipe. I followed instructions exactly, and although it did smell great, I was disappointed with the flavor and texture. It was dry and the bottom burned. Also, it didn't hold together very well.

This meatloaf recipe is a keeper!  All 3 of my kids LOVED this meatloaf recipe and they're not big meatloaf fans.  I didn't add the crackers or potato chips, but used bread crumbs instead and it turned out great.  Something about crushed crackers and potato chips didn't work for me.  :)

Good meatloaf!  I made this with Elk burger that my father gave me from a hunting trip in Montana.  I was afraid the loaf would come out a little gamey but the flavor was fabulous.  My one tiny little complaint was that it would kind of fall apart when I cut it.  Didn't make much of a difference to me or my husband, but presentation wise it wasn't the best.

Guess I was hoping this would be better than the meatloaf I had growing up...I love all of the ingredients, and it smelled wonderful in the oven...but in the end it was still meatloaf. Oh well.

This meatloaf was just average. I thought it would have a smokier flavor. I would make this again, but I would add a layer of american cheese and then cover it in bbq sauce before laying the bacon on it. As is, it was just kinda bland. It definitely has potential though.

I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday because he actually loves meatloaf.  I used jalapeno potato chips, a very large sweet onion, more cayenne, and omitted the bacon.  I made a sauce for the top of yellow mustard, ketchup, and extra bbq sauce, and I cooked it in a loaf pan with no problems, although it did take the full time.  I don't eat meatloaf, but he really enjoyed it and said it made the best cold meatloaf sandwiches the next day.

This recipe is great. I didn't have enough chips (only 1/4 cup) so I also added a 1/2 cup of oats. Mixed it using my Kitchenaid mixer. Didn't use the bacon because I didn't have any. Cooked it for about 50 minutes, topped the loaf with more BBQ sauce (Bulls Eye honey smoke), then cooked it uncovered another 10 minutes. I usually hate anything with ground beef but not this recipe.

The best meatloaf ever the bacon is exellent on the top. I added barbeque sauce over the bacon 15 minutes before it was done.

The fatty content is scary but it is a delicious meatloaf.  I tend to like my meatloafs sweet but decided to try this very manly flavored loaf.  Good stuff, very boyfriend approved.  I didn't use the bacon.  I don't think it needed it, it was flavorful enough as is.  And I didn't crunch enough crackers so I threw in some seasoned bread crumbs on the top to make the measurement even.  I don't think that made much of a difference, I just didn't want anything to go wrong because I decided to experiment too much.

This just didn't seem to blend well.  It was fair and edible, but I wouldn't do this one again.  The bacon on the top was a good idea though.

Maybe my expectations were too high.  I think less onion and more bbq sauce or spice for flavor would be a big help.

I thought this was good, but kind of greasy.  My "Guy" didn't rave about it but it was a nice change from the normal meatloaf recipe.

This turned out very well.  I could have done without the bacon, but that was easily picked off.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, which worked well in this recipe.  Next time I think I would make some sort of glaze.  Overall, this one was a hit at our house.  (My picky Bf loved it.)

My husband and I both liked this recipe but the kids didn't.  It was definately different than a "normal" meatloaf - much more flavor!

My husband loves meatloaf and I have never made it before. This recipe was easy to follow and it turned out pretty good. I would definitely make it again.
