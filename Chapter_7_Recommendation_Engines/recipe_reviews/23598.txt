This recipe was great! I don't know why the person halved their sauce and said that was even too much (maybe they used the sauce to dip in instead of cook in?) You do need all of the sauce. I only used this alternative recipe because I was out of chili sauce, and didn't really expect much from it, but it was very good. I did have to increase my cooking time because I used super thick hickory bacon. This is a keeper for me!

This recipe was a big hit at a recent party. The combination of flavors along with the crunch of the water chestnuts was truly unique.  Since there were no kids to try it, I can't attest to how kid friendly it is, but I would imagine many would like it.  Definitely a "keeper".

Our family always marinates the chestnuts in a mixture of soy sauce & garlic, wraps in bacon & broils, for another way to do these delicious little treats.  Try them for a change.

I've never tried these with mayonaise.  I have had delicious success with just rolling the chestnuts and bacon with brown sugar, then broiling them.

Made these a few times,once instead of making the sauce for them,I used a bottle of honey garlic sauce,just as delicious and it gives it a new flavour.

These were OK.  Kind of putzy to make though.  I thought the amount of the sauce ingredients sounded like quite a bit so I cut them in half and it was still too much.

I used tartar sauce with ketchup as the sauce for this recipe and used only 1/2 piece of bacon per nut. Family wants these everyday.
