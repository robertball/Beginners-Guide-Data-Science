I have found that there are 2 secrets to this recipe that have to be followed or disaster strikes as so many have noted.  First, it has to be BUTTER... and nothing but butter.  Margarine cannot be substituted for butter. :)  The second is the beating time.  Personally I abide by the following method: Beat butter by itself for 5 mins.  Add icing sugar and beat another 5 mins.  add flour in 3 equal portions (1/2 C at a time) beating for 2 minutes after additions 1 & 2 and then 10 mins after the last addition.  So thats 14 more minutes than this author says but thats what works for me every time!  As well I bake at 300F for 5-7 mins.  These are absolutely fabulous cookies... they usually never make it to the serving plate! Yummy!

I make shortbread frequently, and I will say that these cookies are definitely -not- shortbread cookies.  They taste like shortbread, but the butter to flour ratio leans on the butter side, they act much more like a drop cookie than a shortbread. If you're planning to make festive prints or patterns with your press or cutters, try a different recipe.

They are a good, no fuss alternative to traditional shortbread.

My experience with the procedure:
The dough forms crumbles at the beginning like shortbread.  The color lightens and it becomes more "fluid" when enough air has been introduced.  Just keep whipping, you'll be hard pressed to hurt them.  Slow/stop your mixer every minute or so and scrape down the bowl with a spatula to make sure the air-introduction is relatively uniform.  When it's done, it will be about the consistency of a nice buttercream frosting.  You can get fancy with your piping tools instead of cutters or a press.

Shortbread cookies, in my experience, are always a little delicate.  I've made big ones before and you always get a few breaks, but there are generally enough people around the house to dispose of them.  

Someone mentioned the "puffy" cookies in the picture.  I think those are either a different recipe, or the person who made them tweaked this recipe by added flour to bring the ratio closer to traditional shortbread (generally 3-4 cups flour per cup of butter).  I don't think this recipe cannot produce cookies like that.

Wow. When other reviewers said "melt in your mouth", they weren't kidding. These little buttery gems really DO melt in your mouth...almost disintegrate. The flavor is wonderful, but a warning: they are VERY delicate. I followed the recipe to a tee, but baked them for about 14 min (which was perfect for my oven), used parchment paper (helped with easy removal), and added chocolate chips to half the batch. Definitely wouldn't recommend traveling with these cookies, but they'd be great with tea or milk! *EDIT* I made these cookies again and again, and after a lot of experimenting I found that, in order to make it look like the picture, you have to add an extra 1/2 to 3/4 c. of flour to your mix (still beating it in 1/2 c. per 2 min intervals). I tried it first with 3/4 c., but they were a little drier than I would have preferred. I believe a 1/2 c. extra will give just the right consistency with them still keeping their shape. Hope this helps!

The cookies are amazing! But  I do tweak the recipe by adding 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, and baking on parchment paper at 325 for 9 minutes (my oven runs a bit hot). Be sure to dry the cherries between paper towels or the color will bleed into the cookies. Yummy topped with a Hershey's Kiss or Hug, or a dollop of apricot or raspberry jam as well. These are easy crowd pleasers.

After reading all the other ratings and some trial and error, I finally succeeded!  The cookies are great!  I whipped the butter on high speed in my kithcen aid seperatly first.  Then I slowly added the dry ingredients and whipped them again on high speed.  I don't think it's possible to over whip them...  The first batch I cooked for 10 minutes(after reading the reviews) but the cookies just fell apart.  So I cooked the next batch until the edges began to turn a slight golden color.  Yummy!  I drizzled milk chocolate over them once they cooled.  Great Recipe!

Oh, yummy!  

I added about 1/4 cup more confectioner's sugar -and- a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used butter-flavored crisco instead of butter, due to a milk allergy in our home.  

After putting them on the cookie sheet, I wet my finger with some water & made an indent in each one, which I filled with some blueberry jam.  

Yummy!  Next time, I'll have to make a double batch!  

You really do need to beat them for 10 minutes, though.  The dough will change consistency over the course of those 10 minutes from crumbles to a whipped up dough.

Well these shortbread cookies turned out excellent... you CAN USE MARGRINE I don't use butter in my house for cooking/backing and I had margrine and it worked great... I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract I think that is a must have... and I first took 2 squares of margrine and placed it in the micro for about 25 seconds to soften only a little and I wipped it in my electric mixer for about 2 min first ON HIGH and then added the icing sugar still beating on high and 1 cup of the flour on hight and then I sewed in the remaning 1/2 cup flour with my spatula... these really do melt in your mouth... I did'nt think they were difficult... but sometimes when you are new at baking shortbread may not be the best choice... but all in all I love them can't wait to share them with everyone! great recipe william! and thanks for sharing

Great recipe! Very easy to make. I used a cookie scoop to put cookies on parchment paper and flattened them slightly with my fingers. After cooling, I dipped 1/2 of each cookie in melted chocolate. They came out great! Thanks for the fast, easy and tasty recipe...

Excellent!! I took the advice of someone and whipped the butter alone first for 5 minutes then slowly added the sugar and flour and continued whipping for 5 minutes. I rolled them a little to make them into balls and they look fantastic! Definitely worthy of giving to guests at Christmas!

this is the best and easiest shortbread recipe I have tried. The cookies are so light and buttery. I omitted the cherries for alternate red and green sugar sprinkles. It cooked in my oven in 9 min. at 325 deg.

Oh, YUM!! These just melt in your mouth! I took the advice of several reviewers and whipped the butter first for about 5 minutes...added the sugar and whipped another 5 minutes...added the flour and whipped for another 5-10 minutes. I also added some butter and almond extracts for a little extra flavor. I used a piping bag with a star tip, piped the dough into rosettes, and sprinkled with some edible glitter. 

WOW! These cookies turned out so pretty and tender! They would be a great addition to any cookie tray - for Christmas, a tea party, etc!

I will be making this recipe again and again! I plan on trying my cookie press next time (as I've never cared for the spritz dough I use).  

Delicious cookie recipe!

I wish I could say that this recipe worked for me, but it didn't.  I added 1/2+tsp of vanilla to this recipe, and beat the butter first, added the conf sugar and beat that in, then the flour and beat for 10 minutes.  Cookies looked great and tasted great, but I could barely get them off the pan before they would fall apart.  I figured they would be easier to handle once they were cooled, but they weren't.  They fell apart the minute you tried picking them up. They tasted great, but I definitely can't make this to serve to people or they would get a plate of crumbs.  What a bummer!

Slightly sweet and very rich but nevertheless still yummy. I added 3 tsp of cornstarch, so tht cookies can better retain their shape. My kids like the melt in mouth texture!

Great recipe. Absolutely tasty -- the secret really IS the beating. I did exactly what the first reviewer indicated and beat the butter first with vanilla flavoring, added sugar and beat for 2 min., then added the flour in 1/2 c intervals. Thanks for this recipe!

Wow!  These are awesome!  I didnt change anything except that we used colored sugar to decorate as I had no cherries.  Definately the key was in the whipping.  I whipped the butter first for about 3 or 4 minutes then slowly added the icing sugar over the course of a minute and whipped that for about 3 minutes.  Then added flour a half cup at a time taking at least 3 min for each half then whipped for about another 4 or 5 minutes and wow...they are fantastic!  I used a piping bag and made very small cookies about the size of a Canadian Toonie and because they were so small they needed only about 8 minutes in oven to get golden.  First batch I over cooked slightly and they are still amazing!  Thanks, this is a keeper!

I LOVE these cookies! so feathery and melt-in-your-mouth-like! its worth all the whipping I had to do. I followed a reviewer's advice and beat the butter for 5 min, then added the icing sugar and then beat it for 5 more min, then added 1/3 of the flour and beat for two min, another third of the flour and beat that for another 2 min. then finally the rest of the flour and ten min. The only thing bad thing about these cookies is that they're a bit sweet for me. I think i will cute the sugar back a bit next time.

These were awesome cookies!  My 12 year old son made them for his classmates and he used sprinkles instead of the cherries, and he baked them for 9 minutes.  They were melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! EDITED TO ADD: Just made these again this holiday season and they were far too thin. In checking other shortbread recipes, I see there is not enough flour. They were extremely greasy, crumbly, and thin. If I make these again, I will use a full 2 cups of flour.

The instructions do not mention that you must "whip" the batter for at least 10 minutes with an electric mixer (I use my Kitchen Aid)to make it light and fluffy.  Then you can drop it onto a cookie sheet by teaspoons without any difficulty.  I would cook less than 17 minutes - more like 12-14 if you have "whipped" the batter.

Hi Uncle Bill!
Very, very close to my Mom's recipe...you want to beat the batter at low speed, by my method and the cooking time might be reduced with the change in altitude (?) that mine do fine at 9 minutes, yes they might not be as brown and crispy, but rather "melt in your mouth", and I split the cherries in half, rather than quartering, but there you go...amusing to see us come this close with recipes and this one of yours won't be that far behind!

I omitted the cherries, as I didn't have any on hand. Also, I whipped 1 cup of salted butter by itself for 2 minutes on med speed with my kitchenaid, then I added the powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla and whipped it again for another 3 minutes.  I added the flour, 2 level cups, all at once and whipped it for about for 3 more minutes. Then I added 1 TBS milk and I whipped the entire mixture for another 7 minutes, stopping only to scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally.  I used a melon baller to shape the cookies and I baked them for 18 minutes at 350, until the bottoms were golden brown. I removed the cookies to a paper towel lined rack and dusted them with powdered sugar. They melt in your mouth.  Even with the small size, this recipe only made about 3 dozen cookies. My advice is to double or triple the recipe. They will not last!

This is an incredible and very old shortbread recipe.  This same recipes has been in my family for over 200 years.  I DO NOT add any extra icing sugar or flour and they never crumble or spread.  The key is whipping until it looks like buttercream icing.  I always use a piping bag and they turn out spectacular every time.  The only thing I add is almond or vanilla extract.  The almond extract keeps the cookies really white.  People love them so much I have started selling them this year!

Fabulous. Don't be scared of this recipe, it's so easy and delish!  My teenagers love it, and their friend just came over and said it was 'like eating snow'.  I think they will devour the bunch tonight.  Thanks for the recipe!
Now down to basics... whipped butter and sugar first for at least 5 minutes, then added flour at intervals.  Total whipping time, 12 minutes.  Baked at 325 for 15 or so minutes (my cookies are big).  Judge for yourself.
Merry Christmas, Happy Hannukah, and a Blessed holiday to everyone!

Try adding 1/4 cup of cornstarch to this recipe.  That's how my Grandma Graham always made it and they are PERFECT.  You don't taste the cornstarch, but it gives an extra bit of firmness to the delicate cookie.

These are absolutely amazing.  I did what another reviewer suggested and whipped the butter for 5 minutes first, and added the sugar and flour mixture in a bit at a time, and whipped for 1-2 minutes after each addition.  This resulted in a literal melt in your mouth cookie that my fiance described as "If I took a bite out of a cloud, this is what I imagine it would be like." So, weird endorsement, but these are wonderful cookies, easy to make, and I will most definitely be making these again!

Excellent! As others suggested, beat the butter by itself for 5 minutes, add sugar, beat 10 minutes, add flour in thirds and beat 2 min after first and second addition and then approx. 8 minutes after last addition. Baked for 14 min and they were perfect. Melt in your mouth, delicate cookies. Everyone loved them.

Amazingly simple!  Lightly sweet and melt-in-your-mouth!  This is a fantastic cookie recipe and a new holiday staple for my family!  I've made 2 batches in less than a week and they were a huge hit with everyone! *UPDATE: I can't wait to make these again! They keep really well because a month after Christmas, they were still soft and had a great flavor. Wonderful recipe!

OH YEAH!  This is the one!  whip butter 5 min.  add dry ingred 1/2c at a time & whip 2 min ea time.  at end, whip approx 10 min.  roll with hands into golf ball size.  press decoration (eg candied cherry and/or shredded coconut) in, but not too hard as cookies will spread some.  bake approx 14 min at 325 degrees.  next time, I'll bake 13 min as tops were snow white, but I like the bottoms not so tan.  Absolutely no problem with over-crumbly at all and still genuinely melt-in-your-mouth.

Reminded me of this butter melt away cookie my mom used to make.  I refrigerated the dough for 2 hours first, then split it in half on two pieces of plastic wrap. then rolled dough out into 2 logs, and rolled the logs in green and red sugars.  Great for Christmas. Thanks.

I made this for some friends over tonight and they are awesome! I whipped the butter for a few minutes, added the sugar and about half a teaspoon of vanilla. I waited until the last few minutes to add the flour, and the dough was very, very buttery. I probably did a little more than what the recipe called for. Pressed with a floured glass as suggested, and they turned out GREAT! Really do melt in your mouth. I made an almond icing (1/2c butter, 1 1/4c powdered sugar, 1 tsp almond) and covered half the cookies with them. A HIT!

A great, simple cookie.  Loved the light texture acheived by whipping.  I added the vanilla as suggested (I add vanilla to most baked goods).
Also, I whipped the butter separately for about five minutes, then added the confectioner's sugar and whipped more.  I added the flour, 1/2 C at a time, but didn't beat long.  I've always believed that beating flour developed the gluten, and makes baked goods tough.  My cookies were tender and wonderful.  I only got 19 though, so each one had almost a tablespoon of butter.  One was enough to satisfy though. YUM!

Perfect light and crispy, melt in your mouth cookie.  I even cheaped out and used Becel margerine.  I think the key to this recipe is long wipping time.  I added chocolate chips after the wipping and used a floured bottom of a glass to lightly press for a uniform flat look.  I used a mini 1tsp cookie scoop to measure the dough.  The result were cookies that looked and tasted just like the Dad's chocolate chip shortbread cookies that my husband loves.  Thanks for the recipe!

I will return to this recipe and use cornstarch and vanilla - less time to whip and tastier.  Just add 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1 tsp vanila to a double batch of cookies.  Cook at 300, at 350 they got too brown on the bottom and crumbled.  300 for 10 mintues worked well.

If I could rate this recipe higher, I would! It was fantastic. I was a little nervous when making it because the dough really sticks in the beaters for a little bit, just keep mixing because that means you're almost there. I made two batches of this. One with the maraschino cherries and the other I dipped half in chocolate. I melted 1 cup of semisweet chips with a Tbs. of shortening. They freeze really well too! Absolutely Delicious!!

How delicious and easy. Possibly the yummiest shortbread I have ever made. 15 minutes is a bit too long for my oven, but I had and eye on them and they turned out great.

This was so easy!  I never bake and read through the recipe.  It sounded simple enough.  My daughter put the cherry bits on the centers.  Absolutely wonderful!!  I wouldn't change a thing, except that each oven is different.  I read the other suggestions and decided on 12-13 minutes for each batch.  Cookies came out just perfect!  Thanks William...

This was a wonderful Christmas cookie and a big hit at my cookie exchange party.  I read the previous comments and I, too, used my Kitchen 
Aid to whip the batter for 10 minutes and baked them for *TWELVE* minutes and not 15.  They were wonderful, melt in your mouth goodies!

The cookies came out so light and yummy! I halved the recipe but really wish I didn't because these cookies are so good! I added vanilla extract and omitted the cherries.

These turned out perfect... I followed the recipe closely for the butter and flour but added maybe a tbsp. more sugar. I only whipped for 5-6 min. total and they still came out fine.  I was looking for a basic but easy shortbread cookie recipe and this is definitely it!!   Alterations:  I omitted the cherries, added "smaller than chopped" walnuts and pecans and dipped them in confectioners sugar while still warm.  Yum!  And they do melt in your mouth.  You could also omit nuts and coating with conf. sugar at the end and instead ice with butter icing (like "melting moments") or dip half in chocolate... I will try both of these at a later date...  Thanks for the recipe!!

I loved this recipe, I DID end up adding about 1/4 cup extra flour, and about 2 tbsp extra confectioners sugar, just to make them stiff enough to hold up for thumbprint cookies. Rolled into balls lightly, thumbprinted. When they were done I filled half with homemade raspberry jam, and the other half with melted chocolate chips (mixed with a little heavy cream).When they cooled I dusted them lightly with shaved chocolate and confectioners sugar. AMAZING!!!!

I piped them into little rosettes - they're so cute.  Really delicate, so next time I'll make them smaller (one bite). I also used unsalted butter and wish I had added a bit of salt to the batter. Overall, fun to make and taste great.

i make these very year and even though the batter is a royal pain to work with and even though it makes such a small batch, I never leave them out of my christmas cookie plates. Lighter than air, melt in your mouth, not too sweet; they are worth the work!

This recipe was delicious! The only change i made was to add 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Also, I am not so sure about the need for such precise mixing times. I don't own an electric mixer so I whipped the butter by hand for a couple of minutes and then the rest of the mixture by hand also for about 2-3 minutes...and the batter came out beautifully with a wonderful texture.

I have been making shortbread every year for the last 10 years but was never happy with the recipe I had.  I tried this recipe this Christmas and it was exactly what I was looking for.  My whole family LOVED these cookies and I ran out very quickly, even before our Christmas guests arrived.  Next year I will triple the recipe.

these didn't turn out for me. they spread out too much in the oven. i tried them at 300 and at 350 (based on reviews), but neither way worked.
it must have been something i did, but i can't see what my mistake was.....i probably won't try again.

I was really scared to make these cookies as per all the reviews, but mine turned out fabulous (and not crumbly at all).  I whipped the butter until it looked like frosting (about 3-5 minutes) and then added everything else and whipped for about another 2-4 minutes.  I did add a little bit of vanilla (1/2 t).  I don't have a Kitchen Aid, so I just used my handmixer!  Don't be scared of this recipe, its very good!

These are delicious.  I've made them the last three holiday seasons, and instead of cherries, put either chocolate, jam or lemon curd in the center of each cookie.  They are light and delicate, yet rich and decadent!

Oh yummy yummy!! I actually made these for Xmas. I found it better to pipe them onto trays and make small ones that stay together, large ones are very crumbly. They were gone as quick as anything once they were out of the oven!

Great Recipe -- try skipping the candied cherries and dipping or drizzling w/ melted chocolate --the best is the new mint chocolate kisses -- a fave at the cookie swap at work

This has been my favourite shortbread recipe ever since I found it - very rich, but very good.  I either pipe them or use a cookie gun and they turn out really cute.  I've also added food coloring to the dough for a change.  They are truly melt in your mouth, and they are a staple on my christmas cookie list!

i think this batch lasted a whole 6 hours.  i added the skor toffee ships to the recipe and it turned out beautifully.  i love the texture of these shortbread cookies...so light and airy.  but make them small, otherwise you will eat them in no time!

Light and buttery!  I didn't use the cherries--just made them plain.  I think these would be beautiful piped with a large star tip or shaped with a cookie press.  Very delicious.

Amazing!  My first and last search for a shortbread recipe.  Have always liked the whipped shortbread variety but didn't realize how easy it was.  Made some 5 or 6 batches over the season.  Had to watch them as a shorter cooking time is adequate (seems to be common!) and didn't even finish the 10 minutes beating in some cases and they came out fine.

Excellent!  I greatly prefer these to traditional harder shortbread cookies.  They really do melt in your mouth.  The key here is to follow the recipe - when they write whip the butter for 10 minutes, they mean it!  I also add a bit of vanilla for more flavor.  I make them every Christmas and my family loves them.

Love this recipe! It's so easy that I can make it with my 2yr old. They key is to mix it until your arm hurts and use parchment paper to avoid burning. I've substituted butter with margerine and shortning and they were still delicicous. Have also added various extracts and food colouring and the cookies still turned out.

I have to say the only thing I did different was sift the flour and sugar and then just beat it on slow till it was all combined and then switched to full speed for about 10 minutes and then baked them and walla perfection. These will definitely be a staple cookie in my home :D

HELP! I actually got this exact same recipe from my mom who made these every year.  She told me the secret is in the whipping.  At least 10 minutes is the key.  They are my husband's favorites so I made a double batch and followed her directions which are the same as these here.  I knew they were fragile from when my mom made them but mine are so bad that you can't even pick them up.  They crumble to bits.  I whipped the dough up in my Kitchen Aid for 10 minutes and dropped the dough onto parchment paper covered baking sheets.  I guess one small change I made was baking them on the convect setting at 325 instead. (Manufacturer recommends reducing the heat by 25 degrees when using convect instead of bake.) Oh oh.  Now that I stop and think about it I measured then sifted the flour and confectioners sugar using a wire sieve.  So double recipe, Kitchen Aid, oven temp and sifting were my four differences.  None of which I would have suspected would be detrimental to the recipe.  Any advice/sugggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I am not even going to remove the remaining batches from the cookie sheets.  I am going to put them in the freezer then remove them from the sheets after they are frozen. Maybe we'll have to eat them half frozen!

This cookies are incredible soft and buttery! The recipe couldn't be any easier, you just have to make sure you beat them well for 10 minutes. They practically melt in your mouth!  I added two teaspoons vanilla and the taste improved greatly. :)

So, I lost my great grandmothers recipes when we lost our home, along with most everything else.  When I asked my grown kids what they wanted for Christmas dinner they said Great Grandmas butter cookies.  She was a German immigrant, and I remember making these cookies when I was a child, but had relied on what she wrote until it was gone.  I went looking on the internet for a recipe that 'felt right' and found this one because the proportions are correct.  My granny beat the h-e-double hockey sticks out of it with a wooden spoon, but they turned outs as light at air with a wonderful pure butter flavor.  The only difference is that she added some whole milk, right out of the cow.  So I used this recipe to the letter, but added a scant 1/4 cup of half and half, a  tablespoon at a time.  You will know when it is right because when you try to ball it in your hand it will just catch and not crumble.  I did as she did, spoon onto pan and put a thumb in the center to fill with whatever yummy jam is on hand.  DO NOT bake for 17 minutes.  With the added moisture mine took 7 minutes to be perfect. My son also added a hershey's kiss instead of jam and that turned out great.  Enjoy, and Merry Christmas.  T-

When I was a young thing of 22 I ate these at my neighbor's. This is the best whipped shortbread. I lost it and was delighted to find it again. I didn't change a thing but did find out years ago that you never never over bake.  There shouldn't be a hint of colour on these as you will have a cookied that turns to dust... crumbles easily.  I like to put 1/2 of a red cherry in the middle with 1/4 of a green cherry on either side or the red.  Or... I put a piece of pecan in the center with 1/4 of a cherry on either side.  I must say that this is one cookie I always loved to eat frozen too.  lol

These cookies are light and they melt away in your mouth.  I used one reviewer's instructions to whip the batter after each addition and we were awarded with some tasty morsels.  I needed to have my oven set at 350*F to give the edges some colour.  Thanks for posting William, this is the perfect size recipe for not wanting to indulge too much.

This is the most delicious shortbread out there! I have been looking for a recipe like this for a very long time. It's melt in your mouth buttery goodness. Obviously not the most healthy sweet treat but one of my absolute favorites. I followed the recommendation by kathleen with the constant whipping (this is key), however you can use margarine so don't be put off by the recipe if you don't have butter on hand. I have even tried this recipe with whole wheat flour and it was still great. You won't be disappointed!

My Mom used to make the best whipped shortbread cookies and when she passed away a few years ago I thought I would never have them again. Then I found this recipe! They melt in your mouth and are SO easy to make! I did do a couple of things to make them more like Mom's...I added 1 tsp of vanilla AND added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 cup diced red and green cherries RIGHT into the mixture at the VERY end of the whipping process. The nuts and cherries are throughout the cookie instead of just in the centre of it! They were DELICIOUS! I am bringing a platter of cookies to my boyfriends Mom's house for Christmas and I know that she is going to love them! :)

These were melt in your mouth shortbread cookies.  It got rave reviews at my boyfriends work place.  I only beat the batter for about 4 to 5 minutes as it looked like it could take no more.  It still did the trick and like I said it was so light and delicious.

Sadly, this recipe is a big flop for me. These cookies were so buttery that they never firmed up after taking them out of the oven.  They looked like I had cooked with margerine - they spread out so badly.

So fragile you can't even pick them up. Tasted like a mouthful of sand.

I added some cornstarch to this recipe...about a half cup...found it helps to bind the other 2 ingredients better...very tasty...always a hit!

These are great, even without the cherries. I beat the softened butter and sugar in my KitchenAid for 7-10 minutes before adding the flour. I roll the cookies before putting them onto the cookie pan and then press them with a fork to get a nice design. These melt in the mouth every time. If I want them to be even richer, I melt the butter completely in the microwave before starting the recipe. I find that with melted butter, the cookies barely stand up to the softest of chews... It's heavenly, no-fail recipe that I've used ever since I started doing Christmas baking.

This is a FANTASTIC cookie!  I made a few modifications however.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of Crisco.  Additionally, I added 1/4 extra confectionary sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  The taste is mild and not too sweet, but absolutely delicious.  I used cherries for toppers for half of the cookies and plum preserves topped with a toasted pecan on the others.

Awesome.  Had to tweak the baking time, but once they were golden brown on the edges, I took them out.  I added raspberry jam and apricot jam in place of the cherries.

While these cookies had a DELICIOUS taste, they were so crumbly that I couldn't even hold one in my hand without it breaking apart. They definitely melted in my mouth, and like I said, I loved the flavor. I don't think I'll make them again though - just crumbled in my hands.

Good flavor and very melt in your mouth cookies.  Unfortunately they are a bit fragile so they don't travel well.  I will make again since they were so easy to make.

I love shortbread cookies, but these were not good. I followed the recipe and the users suggestions to a tee. They not only fell apart when I took them off the cookie sheet, but they tasted like butter and flour. I'll never make these again.

These melted in the mouth alright but they also melted in the spatula and fingers.
I did the extra whipping as suggested and did different baking times for 3 batches with no luck. I even made little tiny ones and they still wanted to break. Oh well, I'm sure they won't last long, but won't make again.

These were just ok. I followed recipe exactly except for adding a tsp. of vanilla and baking for 8 minutes. I did beat them for exactly 10 minutes. The problem isn't with the taste, it is with the consistency. I couldn't even put these on my cookie tray....they literally fall apart when you pick them up. Impossible to serve. Thanks anyway.

If I could rate this recipe higher than 5 stars, I would!  This was my first attempt at shortbread and I must say...I'm pretty impressed with myself right now.  I made one change to the ingredients in that I added about 2 tsp of pure vanilla extract, but I followed the advice of my fellow Canadian ktardi when it came to the method.  The only place I deviated from her advice was that I whipped the cookie dough for only 7 minutes (instead of 10) during the last cycle of mixing.  I also baked my cookies at 350F for 9 minutes, and they were perfect!  The only 'complaint' (if you can even call it that), is that the cookies are incredibly fragile, so they're not really portable, nor are they appropriate for gift giving.

These little cookies are gems!  I followed the recipe except I added about 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract,2/3 c. finely chopped pecans, and, like other viewers, dipped them in chocolate.  Mine didn't fall flat as others did, but I inverted my cookie sheets and baked them on the other side so I don't know if that helped. I think that next time, I'll skip the chocolate because they detracted from the wonderful flavor, but I think that the pecans were a nice addition.  Thank you William!

This is the easiest recipe I've pulled from here by far! I got a little side tracked, and I left my Kitchen-Aid going for about 20 minutes on setting 4, and my batter came out lighter than most icings I make.  The cookies are delicious and buttery, and they're incredibly delicate.  I made these to send to a friend to put my homemade lemon curd on, and I have no doubt he will LOVE them.
Thanks so much!
***Edit***
PS: I've read some people have problems with them not puffing up in the oven. Mine had no problem, and, while they weren't perfectly round like in the photo, they got significantly taller, and even more airy. Perhaps it was my unintentional extra whipping?

So light and fluffy.  The easiest I've ever made.  I make so many batches of these because eveyone keeps asking for them.  I do not put anything on them.  I have even piped them and put them in a press to make them look nicer.

Quite delicious but very fragile and definitely melt in your mouth.  If anyone had problems with this recipe it's because they did not do the required 10 minute beating, that's the key. I filled with icing instead of cherries, but the second sheet came out flat so couldn't fill.

EXCELLENT recipe and so easy to make.  I can't imagine how anyone could have a problem if you follow the directions!  I can't imagine not using real butter.  My advice would be, if you don't want to use butter, find another recipe.  I do like prettier cookies for my trays and next time I'll try a pastry bag or cookie press.  However, nothing wrong with them the way they are!

I thought no one could mess up a three ingredient recipe, but, once again, the cookie gods proved me wrong.  I would rather they crumble in my mouth and not on the cookie sheet.

Great cookie! They are very buttery and  just melt in your mouth. Like others I reduced the baking time to 10 minutes and used a whole pecan placed on top in place of the red and green cherries. I will be adding this recipe to my permanent christmas cookie  collection.

I actually did not do anything different to the recipe, but I found that my butter was not soft enough. I had mixed all of the ingredients together instead of mixing each separately,  popped it in the microwave for 15 seconds,  then with the mixer, mixed for about 5 minutes until I felt it looked fluffy but stiff enough for cookie dough. 
I then formed each cookie and put in the oven for 14 minutes.
They came out BEAUTIFULLY!!!!
First time making shortbread cookies, and they were not crumbly, dry, or super delicate.  They were perfect!!
And MELT in your mouth delicious. Thank you for my must have recipe for any occasion:)

Very simple yet tasty recipe! I did however, take the advice of the comments and added 1/4 cup more flour to ensure they stayed nice and puffy like in the picture, as well as added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I also added my flour/sugar in 3 parts after first whipping my butter.  I topped with Toblerone triangles instead of cherries and they came out beautifully! Will definitely be making again

These are amazing! I followed Kathleen's suggested beating times and I NEVER bake without parchment paper! These are great as the recipe is but I wanted to try something different - so in the last minute of beating time I added 1 cup of chopped milk chocolate and 1/2 cup skor bits. YUMMY! This recipe is now a keeper!

These are the best, most delicious melt in your mouth butter cookies I've ever made. I mix them by hand and the dough is less fluffy but the result is the same as beating them with the mixer.

Shortbread is my husband's favorite cookie.  I have always used a different recipe but was unable to find it and had promised to make them.  This recipe ROCKS!  This cookie truly meets the definition of melt in your mouth!  They are way better than the recipe I had been using and I will never go back.  These are the best shortbread cookies ever.  Note:  we don't care for marichino cherries, so they were topped with chocolate melts.  Yum!  They are extremely delicate though.  I don't know how well they will hold up to the stress of transport or being included in a holiday gift plate.

I thought these were pretty yummy. They are super easy and quick to make too. The recipe yielded 28 cookies with a standard cookie scoop. I was surprised that a cherry cut into 4 was enough of a piece for each cookie, but it was. I think, they would be good with the almonds like in the picture. As they are so soft, some competing texture would be nice. These would look pretty on a Christmas tray.

Awesome, awesome, awesome is all I have to say!!!  The texture of these cookies is heavenly! I leave out the cherry though and either dip half in dark chocolate or else make a thumbprint and fill with raspberry jam...but they are terrific as is too!  I also took the first reviewers tip and whipped the butter for 5 minutes and whipping between the sugar and flour additions. Stellar recipe!

Awesome recipe but I had to add a little more confectioners sugar because it wasn't fluffy enough. Also the key is to whip them for a long time, until superrrr fluffy. I've made this recipe many times, just had to find it here to refresh my memory.

I'm a vetran cookie maker and these didn't just melt in your mouth they crumbled into pieces before you could get them to your mouth and the taste bland without depth. Will not be making this again.

I made a few changes to the recipe after reading the reviews. I didn't add the cherries, just made them plain. I highly recommend adding a half cup of flour and another 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to get the right consistency; not too runny, not too firm. Be sure to whip them really good! I also added a pinch of cinnamon and a little vanilla, but I do that with just about all my baked goods :) I rolled mine into small balls and baked them for about 5-7 minutes longer than what the recipe says. Melt in your mouth goodness, my boyfriend loves them!

Turned out great, I'm not a shortbread fan but I ate it and enjoyed. I used a pastry bag and made rosettes. Everyone was impressed. Next time I'll drizzle with glaze or chocolate. I could use it being a bit sweeter. Thanks!

Great recipe.  I agree with the previous comments for mixing time.  I shape the dough into a rectangular brick shape about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high, wrap in wax paper, chill for about 1 hour and then slice it into 1/2 inch rectangular pieces and bake on parchment paper - turn out beautiful.

I just finished making these cookies and they are great! They are exactly how my great-grandma made her shortbread cookies. I never got the recipe before she passed away and I think this is probably the same. The only change I made was to cook them for 10 minutes.

I have to agree with some of the reviews that said these cookies have a sand like texture. They crumble in your hand before it can even reach your mouth. It does melt in your mouth though but that's probably from all the butter and whipping. They are so fragile, I had my 2 year old eat this cookie outside because I didn't want "sand" all over the couch. For the amount of calories, I'm going to consume I want a better tasting cookie. Also my stand alone mixer, was really hot after whipping these cookies. It's a lot of work, not great tasting, not sweet enough and too fragile so I won't be making these again I will continue to look for a better recipe.

i made these cookies for the very first time for my husband, son and myself...needless to say i will DEFINATELY make these many more times! they are excellent!! my husband said they are light and airy!! the only thing i did different, i put a very small amount of apple jelly in the center..and they were AMAZING!! the ingredients to make these cookies is so simple...i always have these things on hand!! the people that are having problems with them might need to go back to using an easy bake oven- SERIOUSLY!! these cookies are fool proof!! the only thing you need is a good mixer!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!

So buttery and smooth they just fell melted in my mouth. They are a little crumbly so be very careful with them.

EXCELLENT!!! I remember the first time i ever had these i fell in love with them and i couldn't find any recipe close to it. but this one is definitely a keeper. i love it so does my 18 month old daughter. i followed the other review by adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour and beating at 5 mins interval and then at 10 mins with the last portion of flour, they came out excellent.

WARNING: Handle with EXTREME care! These cookies are VERY, VERY delicate. Don't consider giving them out as gifts. They'll break when you put them into the box. But well, its weakness is also its strength: these buttery cookies literally melt in your mouth.

Excellent recipe - simple, quick, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  Did add some vanilla extract.  Made them for the holidays and gave them to friends and family.  Great as is but also great when drizzled with chocolate, have added pecans, pistachios, cranberries, etc., to a batch, rolled them in confectioner's sugar - turns out great every time.

This is a really rich and awesome cookie.  The flavour is just like shortbread, but the texture is not - it is so much lighter.  I made the cookies as written and rolled them into balls with oiled hands and baked (no cherries).  Once they had cooled I half dipped them in chcolate.  Yummy.

Always up for a challenge, I thought I would try this recipe.  I give it a 4 because while the flavour and texture are scrumptous, you can not pick them up with your fingers as they just dissolve.  I would re-name them Cherry Sand Cookies because of this. By the way, I added 1 tsp vanilla and for some I used cherry jam, some I used marsh. cherries...  I would make these again, if I can figure out how to firm them up.

great recipe- if you substitute jelly or preserves for the cherries, be sure to  use parchment, wax paper or even foil- the jelly drips stick like nothing else.  Im soaking my cookie sheets tonight.  (Cookies still come off, just leave 'rings')

OH WOW!!  I have never made shortbread b/c all the recipes I had ever been given were for the more dense version.  I'm munching on a cookie right now and I can't tell you how happy I am that I found this recipe!  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and beat the batter for a few minutes longer...couldn't have been easier!  Perfect for when younger chefs want to help out.  I baked mine at 325 degrees for 9-11 minutes as I have a very hot oven.  Everyone wil be getting these babies for gift occasions :)  Thanks!

Very rich and tasty cookies. I only made the cookies without using any cherries or sauce (I don't have any at home). The plain cookies are great with vanilla icecream. However, it is really rich and you can feel it with your fingers when you try to pick it up.

These cookies are festive and tasty.  Although they were light and crisp, they broke apart and crumbled too much when they were bitten into (had a bit of a flour taste).  We love desserts but these ended up sitting on the platter for several days, untouched.  The recipe is simple and the cookies are done in no time.  Good, but not great cookies.  We prefer the more traditional shortbread, which is denser and has a richer flavor.

I took one of the review's advise and added a touch more flour than recipe called for and they turned out great. I also added a tsp of vanilla but not sure I tasted a difference from other shortbread I've had. 
Good recipe!

This is a flawless recipe.  I took others advice and creamed the butter for an extended amount of time and then blended the flour at 2 minute intervals.   It was so easy and came out so nicely I have added it to my Christmas cookie repertoire!

Stellar recipe. Simple and fast. I added a bit of Vanilla and teeny tiny chocolate chips. Be sure to beat it until its soft like frosting. This is the recipe I've long sought. If you mess this up... you didn't beat it long enough. Mine only took 10 mins in a 325 oven on silicone sheets. Perfect!

I made 2 batches of this, the first batch was a little too tender but tasted amazing! The second batch I added just a touch more flour and Wow! perfect texture and flavour. I whipped the butter alone for 2 minutes, then added the flour whipping that for another 2 minutes and then added the sugar and whipped that  out of all of it for about 8 minutes. I could not stop eating them!

I'm not a fan of the cherries so I skipped that step. The trick of whipping them for a few minutes did the trick. These cookies melt in your mouth. I just spooned them onto a pan but I'm making them again this morning for Christmas and I'm going to try them in my cookie press.

This recipe was a good start for something that could be great. ( I double the recipe) I took the advice of others and whipped butter for 5 minutes by itself, then added icing sugar and whipped for another 5 minutes. I then added flour one cup at a time, and whipped for about 3 minutes after each cup. I added 2 tsp's of Pure Vanilla extract. I also added about 3/4cup more flour to make the cookies easier to shape. ANOTHER THING---15+ minutes is waaay too long! I baked them for about 8 minutes and they were perfect! For the topping, I switched it up a bit and put some with cherries, some with sprinkles, some with raspberry jam and some with nutella!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. I've made it 2 times already within a month, and I'm about to make it again this weekend! The second time I made these, I altered them a bit just to enhance them. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a bit of strawberry jam in the middle and some slivered almonds on the top, and can I say, they were DELISH!!

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I followed suggestions of fellow reviewer "kathleen" exactly and they turned out excellent.  I used parchment paper and had to bake for 9 minutes.  They really did melt in your mouth.  "kathleen's" suggestion about whipping were perfect.  This is a keeper!

Good cookies. I added a tsp of vanilla and following someone else's advice beat the butter for 5 min, then added icing sugar and beat for another 5 min, then added the vanilla and some food coloring for something different, and then flour in 3 equal parts beating for 2 min in between each addition. I then beated the mix for another 4 minutes, spooned onto cookie sheets and added a chopped cherry to each. I baked for 10-12 minutes and they came out delicious!

To.  Die.  For.!!!!  I didn't add the cherries, just made the cookies plain.  Plain is an understatement...plain perfection is more like it!  I have shared this recipe with so many friends since and they've all had rave reviews.  Five stars without a doubt.  Melt in your mouth goodness.  You must try these!

These are awesome shortbread cookies.  I did beat the butter for a couple minutes before adding sugar, then beat the sugar and butter mixture for another couple minutes before adding the flour in 3 equal batches as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for another great addition to my baking recipe book.

These cookies were really light and airy. They tasted really good, except they fell apart really easy. Half fell apart when I transfered them from the baking sheet to the cooling rack and about 1/2 the survivors fell apart afterwards. I made them into trees, but they didn't even break in the weak spots. I might have forgotten something? Either way I really liked them =)

Should have noted the review comments prior to trying. Baking time is definetly shorter. My result was tasty but cookie's 'fell apart' as described in some reviews. Probably due to the whipping procedure I used. Probably won't use again.

I don't know how others screwed these up. mine turned out perfectly and i only added  another 1/8 of sugar because the dough seemed not sweet enough. 15 mis was perfect on my old gas range. Like others have stated there IS a sandy texture but i can get over that... and they are VERY delicate, but i haven't destroyed one yet(save the one that fell into my mouth). They definitely taste like shortbread and i will use this simple recipe again!

These cookies have totally made me the star in my family! Like so many other reviewers, I too shortened the baking time to account for my oven which tends to run too hot. And, I take them out at about 6 minutes.

My super special tweak to the recipe is that I ice them with Betty Crocker French Vanilla Frosting while they are still warm. This way, the icing melts into the cookie and makes them that much more melty!

I have used this recipe for years now and I have never had a batch that didn't turn out well!

yum- i made these yesterday- foolproof- they taste like viennese shortbread. i popped sliced almonds on the top for extra crunch with the cherry. I made double sized cookies the kids loved them. Never used icing sugar in a recipe before. Always used caster as in uk. Really easy and fab

Honestly the cookies taste great. As so many have noted the secret to a perfect consistency is the beating time of the ingridients. You can also use this recipe and just add more flour and powder sugar to make a stiffer dough that can be used to make a thicker cookie and also can be used as a pie crust.

I love shortbread and was looking for a fluffier version.  This worked out great!  I wasn't all about the cherries, so when I took them out of the oven I sprinkled some semi-sweet chocolate chips on top and waited for them to melt then spread them like a frosting.  They were tons better the next morning!  The chocolate made them really moist.  The salty butter and chocolate is so good.

This recipe was delicious. I didn't have any cherries, so instead I made a well in each cookie before I put them in the oven, and filled  them with a mixture of black raspberries, flour and granulated sugar. They came out great. I'll be sure to make them again!

After altering the recipes quite drastically, these cookies turned out perfectly.
Based on the suggestions of other users, here's what I did differently:
-Whipped butter, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of almond extract together for 5 minutes. Then creamed together butter and sugar for another 5 mins, then slowly added a mixture of 2c. flour and 1/4 corn starch. Rolled the dough into balls, and flattened slightly.
They did not flatten too much (almost not at all, actually), or fall apart. Hardly sweet at all. Made very nice shortbread.

These cookies are excellent.  I used margarine instead of butter and they came out great.  Because this is a cookie dough and on the dry side, I used a dough hook when mixing, and I didn't have any problems combining the ingredients together.  I will difinitely bake these again.

Thanks. Follow the instructions and you can't go wrong. I must be making mine a bit bigger though. I've had no breaks, although they melt in your mouth. My husband LOVES them. We even melted some chocolate and dipped half the cookie, letting it dry on parchment paper. Yummy and they looked beautiful too.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times, and it's never a fail. You definitely would increase the flour to get the look of the cookies in the picture. I usually add an extra 3/4 cup. Either way you do it though, (melt in your mouth of firm) the cookie is soo delicious. I always get great comments. Note: when adding flour, it doesnt make a difference how much you add, just do it a quarter cup at a time, and stop when you've reached the consistency that you want. I achieve the look of the cookies in the picture with an extra 3/4 cup. (Beat it in 1/2 cup at a time though) and make sure you roll the douh in balls, so keep the dough in a cool spot.

I wish I could give these cookies 0 stars.   They were absolutely horrid.  They fell apart when you touched them, had the consistency of sand in your mouth, and tasted even worse!

Great cookie recipe. Have used it numerous times and keep forgetting to rate it. Had to reprint again today. It's our family's favourite christmas cookie.

Very quick to make.  They were surprisingly tasty for how little ingredients were needed.  I made these for President's Day (the red cherry is for the cherry tree that George Washington admitted to cutting down as a boy). 
Tips: Use butter only-room temp.
Beat ingredients for a full ten minutes (I didn't need to add each individually as others did).
Add a tsp. almond extract - it goes well with the cherry.
If using convection oven, 15 min. works.  Bake until golden edges.
Use parchment-they will volunteer to come off the sheet.
Kids loved them.

I made these cookies to pass out to family.  I must say that I was a bit discouraged when I took these cookies out of the oven.  Luckily, I put them on parchment paper.  I tried to scoop one off after waiting 5 minutes and boy was that a disaster.  The cookie just crumbled to pieces!  I was horrified.  So, I waited patiently until they were completely cool before I tried to move them.  The taste was very good but I didn't really like how they just crumbled once it hit my mouth.  But my sisters' loved the cookies.  They thought they were great.  Not sure if I would make them again.

Awesome.  I have been making these cookies for three years now for our friends & family to give away at Christmas.  The dough is nice enough where you can use it as a Spritz Cookie.

Taste is great but they are very crumbly. I can't think of what I did wrong... I followed suggestions by AMMYBUG and KTARDI ... and beat, and it was fluffy... but they are falling apart at the first bite, and they flattened out completely in the oven :( 
I tried another of William's recipe before and it was great! Might give them another go when I have a stand alone mixer, it seems to take too long (and almost burned the motor) of my cheap hand held mixer :) (maybe that's the problem... Hey! Santa! I need a nice mixer!!! *grin*) - they taste yummy though... I can't help but eat the ones that crumble!!

absolutely wonderful -- literally melt in your mouth, no chewing required! i made a half batch to try them out, and dipped half of those in melted semisweet chocolate, and drizzled the other half with ganache. both were outstanding. these will definitely have a permanent place in my repertoire!

This are delicious! The best whipped shortbread I've made. Be sure to beat for 10 minutes as suggested. I reduced the sugar slightly so they weren't too sweet. I put a large chocolate chip in the middle of the cookie instead of the maraschino cherry.

I don't know what's wrong. I do whip it til creamy but it doesn't turn out like cookie. It's so thin that I cannot pick it up as a piece.  Since everybody said it's good, it must be I did something wrong.

FANTASTIC!!!  this is SUCH a simple, yet tasty recipe! i would also give it more stars if i could!  easy to whip up if you have guests & fun to experiment with "toppings"!  i put a bit of strawberry jam on each just before serving - scrumptious!  use a good jam - nothing too sugary!  thanks to william!

A good delicate cookie.  The only change I made was to use one-half maraschino cherry on each cookie & sprinkled with powdered sugar when they were cool.

These tasted great and were sooooo EASY to make!!  I didn't have any cherries on hand, so I topped with pecans on some, and Christmas colored M&M's on others.  Then I baked for 8-9 minutes.  Will definitly bake again.

These are ok. I had to reduce the baking time by 5 minutes, and I did leave out the cherries, as I don't like them at all. I will try adding some flavouring, or skor bits. For me,they are a bit too plain otherwise.I don't think that they would turn out piped or put through a press---mine flattened to a very thin cookie while baking, so I don't think that they would hold a shape very well.

Not too bad, I also sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, but I think they could stand to be a tad sweeter, I will add more powdered sugar next time.  Also, I only needed to cook them for 8 minutes.  It may be because of my higher altitude in Colorado?

As far as shortbread goes, this is a great easy recipe. They melt in your mouth and don't crumble. Just make sure you make them small. They don't taste as good when they're too big. I am keeping them in the fridge so I can serve them to visitors over Christmas. I will continue to use this as my "Shortbread Cookie" recipe.

Made these on December 20,2016 just as recipe shows only doubled the recipe, make sure you beat for at least 10 minutes and they definitely do come out 'melt in your mouth' delicious! Also I soften the whole lb. of   Room temperature butter in microwave at power level 50 for about 1 minute, depending on how soft butter already is

i made one batch (Had to split it in half) and put it in the oven, one part, was a little too gooey and not firming like normal shortbread
The other got burnt
The last.. i failed miserably while mixing and ended up terrible.
Its probably just me but either way, burnt, gooey or not mixed properly, still tastes delicious!

Despite what some reviewers have said, you can, in fact, overwhip these. I followed one reviewer who said to whip for 5 minutes after each ingredient and those cookies practically turned to liquid when they baked. I've never seen a cookie do what that batch did. I do, however, beat the butter for a solid 5 minutes alone, then add the remaining dry ingredients slowly. Beating time ends up a total of 10 minutes, as the original recipe states.  These cookies melt in your mouth, and they are VERY DELICATE, but they taste amazing.

I've made these twice now and they come out perfectly! I haven't found the extra whipping time necessary. I replaced the overly-sweet cherries with pecan halves and the cookies were an amazing accompaniment to sorbet for a brunch dessert.

I've made these a few times and each time they've been a hit. They definitely melt in your mouth. I usually pipe them with a 1M tip but this time I rolled them in balls, then pressed them with a fork and they were still delicious. In terms of baking, I bake mine for about 8 minutes, until the bottom edges are slightly golden.

I made these little "JEMS" today.They are by far the best butter cookie created! The recipe called for whipping for 10 min.'s,, I tried that for a couple of min.and decided to knead the dough instead. Perfect results. I didn't add cherries just made them plain... Next time and there will be many next times, I will add preserves in the middle. These are #1   YAYYYYYY!

Good basic recipe, whipped my completely soft butter for 5 mins before adding dry ingredients. Cookies came out soft & melty but with a slight floury taste. Next time will use 1/4 cup more icing sugar for little more sweetness.

I tried this recipe and it was amazing. My only problem was that if you put it in for the suggested time then they will burn (believe me) so my advice is just watch carefully and take them out of the oven when edges are golden brown. The way I did it was not exactly the way the recipe suggested because I didn't add the cherries in the middle, instead I shaped the dough using my Christmas cookie cutters and baked them that way.

I've made this recipe a few times and decided to try it again today. To my utter surprise, it worked! They didn't fall apart and they melted in your mouth. I whipped the butter then added the flour in two parts mixed and then added the sugar.I whipped until it was a sticky ball of dough. 

I think the reason they stayed together this time is that I put this thin layer of butter across the baking sheet before adding a teaspoon, not heaping, worth of dough to the sheet. I let them bake for exactly 15 minutes. The bottoms browned perfectly. 

My boyfriend devoured a dozen within minutes of them coming out of the oven. This is definitely a winner.

I use this recipe every single year, and it never fails! It has an amazing melt in your mouth taste. I use a cookie scoop and a half of a cherry or a Hershey kiss in the middle.

I like to think of myself as a pretty good cook, but when it comes to baking I am terrible. I love shortbread cookies but find them exspensive. So when I found this recipe I was hoping, and wow! THANK YOU! They were great and very easy for me. Thats my kind of baking!

These are a family fav and I've been making them for about 4 years now exact recipe. I usually use margarine though and they are still just as good. I don't usually beat them for as long as it says maybe only 5 minutes with my kitchenaid. We keep ours in the freezer so they don't dry out and crumble.

Melt in your mouth yummy! I had to take the cookies out of the oven at 10 minutes or they started to burn. I added candy cane bits instead of maraschino cherries and that worked wonderfully!

I made these last week and they were AMAZING. One thing was that i found it to be too crumbly so i added, not even, 1 tablespoon of water and it got together right away. Overall an amazing recipe and my mom loved them.   Going to make this again. no doubt.

I have never had a cookie like this - they don't just melt in your mouth -they dissolve. Good flavor but way too delicate.  Break apart too easily and nothing but crumbs on the plate.

these are the best, most melt-in-the-mouth cookie, they're more like a european Viennese biscuit than shortbread which is much heavier - they disappear really quickly around here and I'll be making LOTS more! I also followed the user who beat the butter first and total beating time must have been about 20 mins but the results are really worth it.

Really good cookies. I made them a bit different though. Instead of cherries I added a walnut halve to each and once out of the oven, I added a small amt of Fudge to the top. They were very yummy!!

This was sinfully DIVINE. And thanks to Kathleen for sharing the steps she follows cause they were 2 good. I can't believe I can bake this good. I followed it to the tee as Kathleen suggested, I baked it at 350 for about 15 mins. It came out perfect. Definitely will make this again.

This recipe is super easy and definitely melt in your mouth as the description says! I did take the advice of kathleen in the preparation, mixing after each addition and baked at 300 F for 16 minutes. I brought them to a family Christmas party and everyone loved them. My brother-in-law told me it was the best texture in a shortbread he's ever had. Yummy!

I'm a fan.  These were delicate and delicious.  No problems with the cooking--am enjoying every bite.  I found them a little delicate for a cookie tray, but that said, I wouldn't hesitate to share them with friends--just be careful!

wow......thats all i can say.  i really didnt know that the longer you beat shortbread the more tender tey come out...so i tried it.....beating the butter alone for 5 mins then adding 1/2 cup of flour at a time and beating 2 mins in between additions finally adding the sugar and beating 10 mins more.  they are by FAR the most tender, beautiful shortbread's I've ever made and ive made a LOT of them always wondering why i couldnt get that same consistency! Now I know!  I tried piping them....umm, unless you're she-woman dont try...the dough is thick and it took all my strength to do one tray.....i rolled the rest lol this is DEFINITELY my new shortbread recipe.....thank you so much!

These are some of the easiest and best tasting shortbread! I did as some suggested and whipped the butter on it's own first, then added the sugar and whipped that, and then added the flour 1/2 a cup at a time, and whipped after each addition.  Then whipped the final mix for about 5 more minutes.  I baked them at 325 for about 10 minutes and they came out so amazing I'm wishing I had made a double batch.  Yum!!

The taste is 'melt in your mouth' good but they turned out so flat and thin that even when they cooled, I can't pick them up! They break into tiny (deliscious) pieces! Not sure how you all made such thick and rounded cookies as the above pictures!

OMG these are absolutely delicious !!!!!!! I did follow one of the ladies advice and I whipped the butter for 5 minutes then put in the confectioners sugar and whipped that with the butter for another 5 minutes and then put the flour in 3 parts for 2 minutes each except for the last one of the flour whipped it for 10 min. I was worried that these would fall apart but following these directions they did not butttt they were melt in the mouth good. These are officially my shortbread cookies recipe. Enjoy everyone and thank you so much for this recipe !!!!!!!!!!!!

these are excellent!  they did break apart easily even after i let them cool, but then i decided to leave them out overnight and that seemed to help a lot with the handling.  i dipped half of each cookie in baker's chocolate instead of doing the cherries.  everyone liked them and i will be making these for christmas.

They were good, but I did find them to be quite dry. Looking at all the previous reviews, it was probably something I did wrong. I don't have a mixer (not even a hand mixer!) so I had to do all the whipping by hand, and maybe it just wasn't enough? Regardless, I won't be making them again.

I have used this recipe several times my kids love it. So do my co-workers.. I have even went a step futher with this recipe and added almond extract to it. It gives it a really nice taste and they still melt in your mouth. Sue

These cookies really are "Melt in your mouth" - they have a wonderful buttery taste but they are SUPER fragile (no good for traveling). I also omitted the cherry and they were still wonderful!

Very delicious shortbread cookie even though the first time i butchered the recipe due to shortage in the pantry. Used 2/3 cup of white sugar for baking (too lazy to make my own confectioner sugar), added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and drizzled chocolate on top. Either way, i think i got the essence of the cookie and achieved light cryspy airy shortbread cookies. Will make again.

Um, WOW!  I tossed butter, powdered sugar & flour in mixer, added a spash of vanilla, turned on & walked away.  15 minutes later, I piped the very soft batter onto parchment lined baking sheets and baked around 11 minutes.  Cookies were lightly browned.  I slid parchment off and let cool on counter.  They are addictive and melt in your mouth.

This is a simple and wonderful recipe!
The only suggestion I have with this recipe, is you must be patient when whipping the batter.  At first it appears crumbly and you just keep on beating it.  Eventually, it whips up nicely.  I put it into an icing bag and used the largest tip to pipe it out.  It held it's shape very well.
A very good recipe!  Will make another batch tomorrow!

This is the absolute best whipped shortbread cookie recipe ever!  Every year at Christmas time I get asked to make these over and over again, and I have been asked for the recipe countless times.  I have made them drizzled with milk, dark, and white chocolate, and covered with coloured sugar and silver dragees, but I still prefer them just with a maraschino cherry on top.  I always add about a teaspoon of almond extract to the dough for a little more flavour.  These absolutely just melt in your mouth!  My favourite Christmas cookies!

Wonderful recipe!  I doubled it, beating butter x 5min, added sugar and beat x 5 min, added l cup flour x 2 min, next cup x 2 min and 3rd cup x 10 min. I scraped down the bowl, put it in the fridge while I lined the pans with parchment paper, and did dishes.  I dropped by teaspoon, added a cherry, sliced almond and baked x 11 minutes at 325. I froze them on cookie sheets when cool, then packed gently in cans with parchment paper between.  (Mark the can as fragile)
They have held together perfectly and really do melt in your mouth.

This is my first 1 star review on this website.  I did as some reviewers suggested with the whipping and whipping and whipping.  Upon removing from the cookie sheet, 90% of them broke in half.  When I tried to pick them up, they turned into dust and tasted chalky.  I tried to leave them on the pan longer, shorter, make cookies bigger, smaller...nothing worked.  These would have been a storage nightmare if I had kept any of them.  All 4 trays of cookies and the remaining batter went in the trash. (something else I have NEVER done.  I always figure "someone will like them".  Not these.)

Cookies turned out great. I followed the advice of others and whipped the cookies between additions of sugar and flour. The cookies turned out light and fluffy.

YUM!!!  So good.  I followed the reviewer suggestion to first whip the butter for about 5 mins, then add the dry by 1/2 cup measures, whipping for 2 minutes after each, and then a full 10 minutes after the last addition.  I made them pretty small as I expected them to be delicate and baked them about 10 mins @ 350.  They are delicate, melt-in-your-mouth, DELICIOUS!

I followed the recipe to these cookies but took suggestions submitted and whipped the butter for 5 mins, and again after adding the powdered sugar, and about 3 minutes after each flour addition. I added almond extract and vanilla. The taste is good but these cookies fall apart upon handling, to the point where I am wondering how I will store them for the holidays without them turning into crumbs. There are so many suggestions on how to change this recipe to make it work for everyone, it just doesn't seem worth it to me to make them again in hopes they turn out.

WOW. My mom was big into Christmas baking when I was a kid. Every year we would have TONS of Christmas cookies - and these were always on her list of things to make. This recipe is AMAZING. Memories of my childhood came right back to me as soon as I took a bite. Wow - very, very good.

Wow!  This recipe turned out great with margarine, I don't know why they said it would work.  My wife told me it was just about the best cookies I had ever made.  11/10 and so easy to make!  I had to stop myself from eating too many, they were just too delicious.  Turned out nice and solid too, not chewy.  Just enough so when you bit into it it all crumbles in your mouth and melts away, wonderful!

One of the BEST Shortbread cookies that I have ever made.  Just a suggestion, whip, whip, and then whip some more.  I made only one change is this recipe, I added a few drops of vanilla when the batter looked like frosting.Thank you so very much for posting this one.

These are the lightest, melt-in-your-mouth cookies I have ever made! I have made them twice now and they could not be easier.  The first batch was as per recipe.  The second batch I topped with 1/2 tsp of strawberry and cherry preserves.  This was just as good and a great substitute if you don't have maraschino cherries on hand.  They are also great as plain shortbread cookies.

These cookies are flat and just break apart. I did what others suggested, I used butter, mixed the butter for 5 min, added powder sugar, mixed another 5 min, added flour in 3 parts, mixed for 2 mins after each part was added. Then 10 mintues with everything together. Cooked at 325 for 5 mins, cookies were not done at all cooked another 10 mins let cookies cool and they crumbled as I tried to remove them from cookie sheet.

i found them difficult to deal with.  They didn't come out very well as drop cookies, I ended up using a pastry bag to get them to be round.  It was more trouble than it was worth.

This recipe is sinfully delicious.  I did modify it some.  I basically followed the recipe exactly as stated in the original recipe.  Once I got to a frosting like consistency, I added 2 tbs of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup extra confectioners sugar, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar.  Beat it another 5 minutes until the extra ingredients were incorporated.  I used a 2 tbs ice cream scoop and just dropped them onto my parchment lined cookie sheet.  15 cookies on the sheet lasted 12 minutes in oven on 350.  They are undeniably perfect.  Just the cookie I had dreamed of.

the texture isn't too bad, but mine turned out tasting bland, and it wasn't sweet (which isn't necessarily a bad thing)enough for me.

Delicious! I whipped them into complete submission. And cooked them for a shorter time. Wonderful!

I was disappointed in this recipe, not only was the flavour mediocre, these cookies almost turn to dust in your mouth, like you were just eating a spoon of powdered sugar, it isn't very pleasent. They are also too delicate to withstand transporting around in a cookie tin.

These cookies turned out amazing.  I am more of a cook then baker but everyone was raving about them.  The only thing I added was a half teaspoon of pepermint extract.    My hubby and in-laws eat them as soon as they are placed on the table.

Thanks again

They were a little bland and really crumbly. They definitely weren't good enough to get past the sand like texture.

Fantastic!  This should be rate 10 not a 5. I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time, as my cousin made this type but never showed me how to make it.  So needless to say it never worked.  I adjusted this recipe according to another viewer.  Whip butter for 5 minutes, then the icing sugar for 5 minutes.  Flour 1/2 cup at a time beating for 2 minutes, with the last addition for 10 minutes.  Then I used a pastry bag with a 20 star tip and piped rosettes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Divide the cherry into smaller pieces. You need a mixing machine for this recipe.  If you use a handmixer you man burn out the motor. I place the cookies in the freezer and take them out as needed. They taste wonderful cold.  This is definately a keeper!

This recipe worked out great.  The only thing that I did different was I added a little almond flavouring.  Also I only set my oven to 300 degrees and cooked them for 18 minutes, I found they weren't as fragile.

Great shortbread cookies. I used almond exract in half the batch and plain in the other half. We all prefered the half with the almond in it!! All in all though a great cookie that literally melts in your mouth. Thanks for the great recipe.

What a disaster these shortbread cookies were. The first tray was in the oven for 15 minutes (as per the recipe) and they burned so badly -- and I mean CHARRED -- that I had to throw them out. The second tray was only in for 7 minutes, which seemed about right, but the cookies flattened out so much that they look terrible. I threw out the recipe card along with the cookies because I know I will never use it again.

This recipe brought back a flood of memories from when my late grandmother sent us a batch of these delicious cookies from Scotland every christmas in the 1950's. Whipping time is a key to these, I added another 1/2 cup flour as suggested + 1 tsp vanilla extract. Watch your butter temperature, if your kitchen is very hot your butter may melt and may not whip very well. Everyone in the house loved these, they were gone within hours.

My grandnmother made these and they were so delicious.  She used a bit more sugar, which is not necessary, but she added 1/4 cup cornstarch, which seems to make them melt in your mouth even more.

These were super easy and taste like a dream.  They dont travel well but I had to mail some of them so I just mixed by hand and rolled into balls and baked the same amount of time.  They were great either way.

My first mistake was not reading the posted reviews. I would highly recommended this. I love this website because I rely on others for hints and tips already tried. I now wonder if I would of had another experience if I did read them, I just simply forgot to this time. I read the recipe and thought it would be quick and easy. I had a difficult time whipping them to the point my mixer was hot to the touch. They did turn out white and fluffy but found that they tasted like sugar. They looked good on the tray and that was about it and in fact they went last. I will try again but read the tips and hints first this time.

Turned out fantastic. I dropped dough from a teaspoon in small piles. Had no problem with them flattening when i made them on the small side and used a completely cooled cookie sheet lined with parchment (make sure the cookies are lightly browned on the bottom to make them a little sturdier).

I took the advice from a few people ... I added a splash of vanilla & beat the butter for 5 mins.  I added 1/4 cup of cornstarch to all the dry ingredients & added to the butter & beat another 5 minutes.  I also used a cookie press with this recipe & it worked out well.  With the cookie press I baked them at 325 for only 11 minutes (will try 300 degrees next time though - turned out too brown on the edges).  They still melt in your mouth with these 2 modifications ... they just don't crumble before you can get it in your mouth!

Very good. 15mins is a little long to cook though -- bottoms were browner than I liked, which took away from the taste. Next time I'll shoot for 12-13 mins. Other than that, they were wonderful!

There has to be a better shortbread cookie recipe than this.They fall apart in your hand and turn to sand in your mouth. The taste is just ok but the texture is unforgivable.

Mine did not turn out like the picture at all.  They were very flat and thin.  They tasted delicious right out of the oven but not quite as good once they cooled.  I may not have whipped them long enough and I used margarine instead of butter (all I had) which probably was a mistake.  Will try again and see if I can do better.  I don't think that I cooked them long enough either.  They seem a bit tempermental, and apparently by the other reviews I am not the only one that had trouble.  But I think they would be great had I done it right!

This is a great recipe! I baked at 325 degrees for 15 min. For easy removal, use parchment paper to line cookie sheets. I mixed just until fluffy with a wooden spoon - no need to wear yourself and your mixer out. Butter MUST be room temperature when you start mixing dough.

These are soooooo great!  I had no problem with them falling apart until we put them in our mouths.  I did use a cookie scoop (or small ice cream scoop) to put them on the cookie sheet.  Maybe that helped them to hold together.  Anyway - I made them 15 minutes ago and there are only 8 left....7...6!

Yum, yum.  I just got done making these - followed the recipe as written but didn't add the cherries.  I added a chocolate piece in the middle and on others added a bit of strawberry preserves.  After trying the first one, I'm thinking the flavor comes out better when they are just plain.  Baked for the entire time - slightly browned on the bottom, and they did not crumble at all.  Thanks for sharing!

These were wonderful!!!  Make sure you beat for the full 10 minutes.   I lowered the oven temp. to 325 and baked for 10 minutes.  Also, I added 1 t. of vanilla and did not put the cherries on top.  We loved them plain!  Delicious cookie!!

terrific recipe!! i heeded the advice of previous posters and reduced the temperature slightly (about 325). for a gilding the lily version, i pressed chopped pistachios into the top before baking and drizzled some melted semisweet chocolate over them as soon as they came out of the oven. seriously yummy!

I thought this was a great recipe, and had no trouble with it at all.  My first batch was made sans cherries, as I was trying to make something with what I had on hand, but I did add a touch of almond extract.  Not sure if altitude plays a part in the variations in cooking times, but I used a gas oven at 350 degrees for 12.5 minutes.  I'm hoping to make more today!

This cookie was very easy to make and is very tasty.  I added a little cherry juice to the dough and it gave it a pink color.

The best! So easy and delicious.  Using a stand mixer would help with the long mixing time but these are worth it.  I merely added some almonds to the top of a few for a variety.  Watch the cook time!  I only needed 10-11 minutes or they were too dark (but still very edible!)

Hmm... can you say butter?  Very good, but very fragile.  I might add some cornstarch to keep things together, and some vanilla for an extra kick next time.  The recommended cooking time is too high.  I cooked for about 10 minutes at 350 for a nice golden bottom.

Where I am from, we always add 1/4 cup cornstarch into the recipe, after whipping in the sugar, but before beating in the flour.  I also beat until it starts looking like whipped cream, then set the timer for another 5 mins, and beat for that time before cooking.

This recipe is sooooo easy, I started making these cookies when i was about 18 yers old and ive made them every Christmas. Everyone comments on how light and fluffy they are. Along with the cherries on top I also add red and green baking sprinkles to add to the festive look THANKYOU FOR THIS RECIPE!

Excellent cookie. I added a 1/2 t. vanilla and chopped pecans instead of the cherries. Then I dipped some of them in chocolate and some in powdered sugar like a tea cookie.They made a beautiful cookie tray and everyone wanted more! Thank you for sharing!

Beautiful, so tender and delicious.  They do not travel well, so eat them the day they are made and don't try to take them anywhere.  My mom made them too and added mini chocolate chips, they tasted great that way too.  Thanks.

This is such a wonderful recipe for shortbread.  I did have to adjust the baking time, and I substituted Christmas Smarties for the cherries.  My family loves them, and I know that I will have to make quite a few batches this holiday season.

I think I was expecting more of a "whipped" cookie, one that could be dropped 
from the spoon as the recipe stated.I ended up rolling them into balls and 
pressing them down with a fork, and that worked out just fine.  Very easy to make.

I followed the recommendations of beating the butter alone first for 5 minutes, then again with the sugar, and dividing the flour into 3 parts with 2 minutes beating after the first two, and ten minutes after the third. Decorated with dried cranberries ( a real treat on the other side of the world ~ China!). They are a Christmas gift worth giving! Excellent!!!

Very good but as many others suggested they broke apart when you tried to take them off the cookie sheet.  1st tray cooled, chilled, crumbled. 2nd tray cooled slowly on the tray stayed together a little better.  After freezing they can now be picked up without breaking.

These are really good! Especially with a stand mixer that you can set the timer and let go for 10 minutes. Definitely worth the extra beating time.

I made the recipe and probably won't make it again.  Like others have said, they fell  apart!  I used butter too.  I also added a two vanilla thinking this would flavor it nice and keep the dough together.  Oh my goodness, they are delicious and would be great over a bowl of vanilla ice cream.  As a cookie no I don't think so.

Wow, great recipe! The secret is to really whip it, whip it good! Pardon the Devo reference.  The cookies came out light and "fluffy" and almost melted in my mouth. I am a chocoholic and while I know I would have thoroughly enjoyed these little gems with a maraschino cherry in the middle I opted for a nice chocolate ganache drizzle instead. They were well received be family and friends alike.

Delicious shortbread flavour.  I did add 1/2 c flour and a tbsp of white sugar as well as chocolate chips.  Will use this recipe over and over.  I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes and this worked for my oven.

these are very light! I followed the recipe, put the batter in the fridge for an hour. Then with melon ball scooper made balls and put a hole in it (chapstick), filled with cherry pie filling. They held up nicely.

Nice recipe, and if you beat it properly it comes out beautifully.  15min too long, and my oven doesn't usually run hot. 13 on second batch was perfect. 
I'm trying to find my mom's recipe, and this isn't quite it.  Hers was richer somehow, not quite sure what's missing.  Won't make again as I'm on a cookie hunt, but very good :)

This was a great recipe, but I did follow some other suggestions:- You have to WHIP forever, but SO worth it. - I doubled the recipe and added an extra cup of flour. - I didn’t add all the ingredients together. I whipped the room temperature butter and vanilla for about 8 minutes and then alternating flour / icing sugar while whipping constantly. - I formed them into walnut sized balls and then flattened slightly and sprinkled red & green sugar on top. - I baked at about 12 minutes on an insulated pan lined with parchment paper.

not totally inedible, but that's the best we can say about this recipe - flavor is flat, cooking time was way off (burned around the edges after 15 mins) and they spread out way too thin.

I wanted to like these. I really did. I made the recipe exactly as stated, including beating for the times listed. The cookies were SUPER soft so I put them in wax paper and made a roll to slice later. After chilling overnight, I sliced them and baked them. Yuck. They just tasted like flour and the texture was gross. Almost chalk-like. Not anything like what the other reviewers described in their glowing reviews. I tried baking a second batch adding some baking sugar on top. Didn't help. Bummer.

Followed the recipe to a T.  Been using this recipe for a few years now and it's a crowd pleaser!  I make these cookies and give them away as presents--people actually ask when they are getting their tin of cookies from me!  So good.

I followed some of the suggestions to beat the butter separate and beat for longer (I didn't do the full 5 minutes after each addition however) and it turned out great. 
I ended up using a piping bag and tip because the mixture was very sticky and soft. I cooled the cookies on the pan outside,  (no fridge space left this time of year!) and while they didn't keep the full shape, they had a nice little swirl in the middle of them once baked. 
These were for sure, the favourite cookie of the ones I made. I'm going to save this recipe and add it to my repertoire for sure!

I follow the recipe exactly and the cookies were melt in your mouth  crumblies.   The only changes I made to the original recipe ,  I whipped the butter to a near foamy state (maybe five to seven minutes, then I added everything else gradually and kept the mixer  on high speed as I added.  I have been doing this recipe for four years and end up selling  more than the local stores sell. -Oh yes, I added a table spoon of home made vanilla after the butter & sugar are fully whipped.-

Easiest: toss in stand mixer, scrape down 2-3 times over 10mins, pretty hands off. For super fast cookies I use a spoon to drop them or I mostly go fancy and use a cookie press: nobody believes I make these at home, have been “accused” of buying them at the bakery and putting them in a Tupperware when I brought them to book club. I make them dozens of times a year, best cookie ever for Christmas cookie swap. Ever.

I tried making these three different ways to see what would get the best results. Like kathleen mentioned, I whipped the butter for about five minutes and then added icing sugar and let it whip for three minutes more, before adding the flour. I baked at 300 for 5-8 minutes as she suggested...it did not work for me. I ended up baking them for longer because they were definitely not cooked, and then they were crumbly. I also tried two batches at 350 for 15-20 minutes...this was ideal, but you need to press the spoonfuls down (haha). I used silver balls instead of maraschino cherries, and these were great! Held together, buttery...delicious!

Loved this recipe.  First time making it.  I did whip about  10 minutes longer than recipe called and I doubled the recipe. Shortbread was delicious but very fragile even if a little warm.  Next time I will let them cool completely before removing from pan. Absolutely wonderful right out of the freezer as well.  Will make again for sure .

This was a wonderful recipe!!! They really do melt in your mouth!!  A big thank you to some of the reviewers out there for your suggestions.  I added some cornstarch, a little extra powdered sugar and a little extra vanilla extract.  Also, per a suggestion, I made sure to whip the butter for 5 minutes first then whip the heck out of the whole mixture till it had a creamy texture.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe and for the suggestions!!

Made without tweaking ingredients, but added some vanilla extract for flavour. Beat as much as I could stand to beat the ingredients, after each addition to get as much air in them as possible.
Baked at 300 degrees for close to 20 minutes each batch to dry them out nicely.

I followed the recipe as written and the cookies turned out perfectly. The only thing I changed was i baked them for less time - I made a triple batch and after the first couple, I found they really only needed 8-10 minutes to bake.

Not too shabby. Butter turned out to be a bit  too cold still so had to heat it on the stove with the flour etc and then add some more flour and sugar and I added a TB of vanilla. 350 for 12 mins, perfect

Cookies came out flat and almost burnt after 10 minutes. They tasted like flour even though I added vanilla before beating.  Pretty disappointing with how much ingredients it used up.

I followed reviewer KATHLEEN'S review instructions. Though I increased my oven temp from 300 to 325 and baked them for 12 min. Just until the edges were toasted brown. I topped the cookies with mini chocolate chipits before baking. They are melt in your mouth AMAZING! So whip your butter for 5min then add powdered sugar and whip again for 5min.  I also added about a tbsp. of vanilla powder cuz I like it.  Then in increments of 1/2 c. at a time add flour whipping 2 min between ea. increment. Scrape the sides of the bowl down into the batter regularly as you whip.  Then I whipped for another 5 min after all the flour was added.  I really don't think you can OVER whip these cookies so don't worry about that.   Now you could pipe the cookies onto a cookie sheet but I just dropped them by spoonful onto a PARCHMENT PAPER lined cookie sheet. I also DOUBLED the batch and it worked out just fine. They are really good.  The taste of Christmas. Gosh there are so many tastes of Christmas aren't there? LOL! Merry Christmas bakers and chefs of allrecipes.com !

This cookie tastes delicious, but the texture was completely off. We followed the measurements and everything else verbatim, but the seemed to melt in the oven and when we tried picking them up, they crumbled. Disintegrated on my tongue, it was weird. We tried it again the next day with granulated sugar and the cookie was more substantial, but still "melted" in the oven. We subbed peach preserves for the cherries, that was great!

I followed the recipe except for adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I beat the dough after each ingredient was added.  The cookies were extremely light and fell apart in your hand, before getting to your mouth.

I followed this recipe to a T, except I added about 1/3 cup extra flour and they turned out perfect. This is my first time making short bread and they are exactly what I was looking for! I did NOT follow other reviewers recommendations on the whipping and mine turned out super fluffy and melt in your mouth. I simply whipped for 10 minutes in my kitchen aid mixer and every couple minutes scraped the sides of the bowl and cleaned out the beater a bit. This will be my go to recipe for short bread!

I made as recipe indicated and I couldn't even pick up the cookies as they literally almost disintegrated in my hands! Do NOT beat for 10 minutes - taste was very nice, but way too flaky!! Unfortunately I will need to make another batch as these just won't work for a baking tray - I guess I'll go back to my own whipped shortbread recipe!

Followed the recipe to the exact directions on recipe. unfortunately I seemed like I was eating a mouthful of butter.
Crumbled before got off the cookie sheet. Also only baked for ten minutes and were browned. One or two minutes more it would have burnt. I keep a thermometer in my over to double check.  Disappointed! Am surfing the internet from another recipe.

I followed another posters suggestion and whipped the batter for about 13 minutes total, gradually adding the  flour.  I baked them at 325 degrees F for 10 minutes and that was enough.  I tried one batch at 350 degrees and they were brown on the bottom after 8 minutes.  These are not very sweet and are very delicate.

These are really really good. Only 4 stars as they are very fragile. I used colored sugar on top which is pretty but might use jam next time. Don't "throw"these around!

I followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed these on the day I baked them.  However, I stored them in tupperware to take to my Grandma and the next day they had a strange chewy texture, the dry melt-in-your-mouth cookies that I loved had changed.  
I'm not sure why this happened, I'll definitely make these again and maybe try storing them a different way

These are just like mom use to make. I followed the tips of the others, adding a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, whipping the butter 5 mins, adding the sugar and whipping another 5 mins, then adding the flour a 1/2 cup at a time and whipping 2 mins inbetween followed by 10 mins. I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour and they puffed up just like the picture. Instead of cherries, in the last minute of whipping I added about 1/2 cup of Christmas coloured sprinkles to keep with the theme of my Christmas baking. Adds a nice texture. I piped them into little piles and called them 'snowman poop'! Finally, I baked on parchment paper on convection at 325F for 12 mins. Perfect!

Followed the 10 minutes of beating. Turned out great! Have made before and not whipped for very long and they crumble.  Would add a bit of salt or maybe vanilla next time.

My cookies turned out nicely and look much like the picture...BUT they taste like sand! I'm so disappointed too, as these were a lot of work especially when using a hand mixer. I'm trying to decide if I should take them to work. After all, there are a lot of good reviews here so maybe it's just a preference. Wish I would have read a few of the negative reviews.

Have used this recipe with both butter and margarine, both turned out perfect but still prefer using butter. There is nothing that tastes better than real butter, quality is important when you are treating your family! I opened up this site for the recipe which I have used for the past few years and, lo and behold, exactly one year ago to the day was the last time I looked for it! Highly recommend this one, best of all the whipped shortbread recipes, bar none.

Followed Kathy's recommendations about whipping and these truly melt in your mouth.  Added almond extract after creaming butter, but before adding sugar.  I was concerned about the frailty issues, so I refrigerated them for an hour before I scooped them out with a small ice cream scoop.  This allowed me to have them in a mound, to which I added a thumbprint and seedless raspberry jam, but I only got 24 cookies that way.  Might try to add some butter flavoring next time, just to try to kick up the butter flavor a bit.  Allow to cool thoroughly, and use parchment paper.  Still fragile, but very good!

Yet another sparkling review... I was petrified to make these because I am in Montana **HIGH ALTITUDE** and my cookies (especially store-bought dough log) always turn out like puddles because of the altitude. But I gave it a shot and instead of adding more flour to the dough right off the bat, as one could do to make cookies stand up to HA baking, I decided to make the batch as suggested and then bake a test cookie to see if the extra flour was needed. Well I rolled the dough into a little ball and made a well for some blueberry jam, baked it for 10 minutes at about 325 and it came out perfect!! With some powdered sugar on top it you really don't miss the fact that this is not a super sweet cookie. I am so happy this worked, thank you :)

3 and a half stars the flavor of these cookies is to die for after you add some vanilla. unfortunately they are so delicate that when i went to put them away in a container three quarters of them broke so now i have a container of shortbread crumbs.

15 minutes at 350 pretty much cremated these cookies, I adjusted the time but they have almost no flavor. I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

These were too soft for our altitude. They went flat in about one minute even with adjusting the cooking temperature. They tasted great but not something I would put out for company.

These are super easy for my three year old to help make. She measures the ingredients (with the addition of vanilla extract) and tops them with a whole red marachino cherry and sliced almonds. Yum!
They are flaky but not dry. Not too sweet, but I like small cookies with a whole cherry.

Easy to make, great recipe! One of the lighter Shortbreads, not too dense at all. We made ours with Hershey's kisses in them, instead of Cherry and it was a great substitution.

I made this recipe tonight and the cookies are truly delicious. I followed some of the tips posted in other comments (like whipping the butter before adding the rest of the ingredients) and they came out beautiful and they taste better than they look. Thank you so much for the recipe and thanks Kathleen for the good tips.

These are delicious. I only baked for 9 minutes and they were very brown on the bottom already. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and whipped the butter for 5 mins with the icing sugar before adding the flour.

These are delicious! Made with butter they go all crumbly and melt in your mouth. I didn't have any marischino cherries so I put a teaspoon of strawberry jam or a few chocolate chips instead; which turned out great.

wow, these are sooo good! I didnt add any jam or anything, just made the cookies by themselves. Beating the butter first by itself is key. So good! possibly the best shortbread recipe I have found so far.

AMAZING Shortbread, more like a drop cookie, incredible, the only thing I altered was instead of cherries I alternated between semi sweet nestle chocolate chips and crushed walnuts.  I also put on a little granulated sugar after they were out of the oven.  My batch only made 24 instead of the 36 mentioned, but that was based on size of spoonfuls.  All in all, this has become my new shortbread recipe.  My neighbours, friends and husband loved them!!!

These are are so delicious!  I did mix the softened butter and sugar together first and then gradually added the flour. I also added vanilla extract.  Instead of using the cherries I used a dollop of jam in the center of each cookie.

These taste even better than Knott's shortbread cookies. WOW!!! THANK YOU for posting this!! I didn't have cherries so I used a couple of jams I had in the fridge. Note: for those of you like me that can't wait...and just HAVE to taste the dough...do NOT be disappointed that the dough isn't that tasty. Be patient and wait until they're finished you will not regret making these!

These are the best cookies ever! My husband took them to work and the guys called to rave about them. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and took the advice of one review and staggered the beating times and the addition of the ingredients. They do melt in your mouth!

I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, as previously suggested, and I beat the ingredients one at a time. I didn't have maraschino cherries, so I put used seedless raspberry jam instead - so good! Next time, I'll try adding melted white chocolate as well. They are verrrry crumbly, so be sure to let them cool a bit before transferring from the cookie sheet.

I'm really kicking myself because I should've taken time to read the reviews before making these.  I attempted to whip everything together all at once and all I got were crumbs of dough and flour everywhere!  I will definitely try these again because while the directions didn't work out for me this time, they still taste great.

I have made these cookies for Christmas for years; did not have to tweak, alter or change the ingredients, made them with butter or marg when I didn't have butter in the house.  They turn out every time. No, they are not the shortbread that you can make into shapes, but all my friends, family and neighbours love to receive them as gifts.  Easy cookie for the last minute and they never fail.  If you fail at this recipe, then you are trying too hard.

These are addictive.  I couldn't stop nibbling.  The dough is very forgiving if you have little helpers who want to shape them.  The recipe makes a small batch so I'd definitely double it because these go very quickly!

OMG - these are delicious! I made two batches. I did not have cherries on hand - so I made a little indent and used smuckers low sugar strawberry jelly. On the second batch i just added about 1/4 more confectioner sugar. As the other review said - mix longer. First cream the butter for 5mins then I added the conf sugar and mixed for another 5, then adding the flour alittle at a time mixng more - good thing i had the kitchen aid mixer - LOL  This Is one of my favorite cookie recipes - very easy too! Thanks

Very easy to make and delicious!!  Melts in your mouth.  I omitted the cherries as I didn't have any on hand, but I did add some green food coloring to the mix to make them Christmasy....turned out great!! Mmmmm! :)

I rated four for my changes but I would've likely rated the original as a five.  I used margarine, added a touch of vanilla and more flour (due to the softness of margarine).  The margarine didn't change them nearly as much as I thought it would.  They're delicious but don't have that "you're eating straight butter" dairy taste.  A very easy, good cookie.

Not the melt in your mouth style shortbread I was expecting. Tasted ok, but for all the whipping....wasn't as good as I thought. 10 minutes is the best cooking time, and I think more flour would have made these better.

This is a nice easy no fail recipe.The cookies are very light a tasty.Having a kitchen Aid mixer makes this even easier as it is necessary to beat the mixture until light & fluffy.I used a pastry bag to pipe the filling & it came through nicely.

After reading some of the negative reviews, I wasn't sure if these were going to turn out for me (since I am no expert baker!).  However, these were excellent!!  My batter was not crumbly at all, and after baking they easily retained their shape.  No cookies broke at all.  These were very easy since the mixer does all the work for you!   Which is a good thing, since I think I mixed them for about 20 min.   This will definitely become a Christmas  favorite to bake!

DO NOT MAKE THIS.  I normally don't like things too sweet, but this recipe isn't sweet enough. It also did NOT work. After whipping for 5 minutes, I just had a bowl of crumbs. I added a few drops of water and the dough came together. Also, I only baked them for 10-12 minutes at 325. What a disappointment. I'll never make these again.

Very good!  I used a melon ball scooper instead of a spoon.  This worked great.  I used sprinkles instead of the cherries.  Great warm right out of the oven.  My 8yr old ate 2 right away.  12/7 - I am editing this after reading some of the more recent reviews.  You must beat this batter for at least 10 min. non-stop.  It will be creamy and fluffy.  It's best to use a stand mixture.  Use the paddle attachment and a speed of 5-6.  I don't like a real sweet cookie so these were perfect.  My sons have eaten all most all of them.  I will need to make more tonight.

These are delicious and easy, although somewhat time consuming, to make. After reading many of the reviews, it seemed that long whipping was the key here. What I did was whip the room temp butter for 5 min, then whipped for 5 min after adding each 1/2 cup of additional ingredients. This totalled 25 min whipping! (I wish I had a stand mixer!) The cookies were so tender and tasted perfect. I skipped the cherries, as we don't really like them, and put coloured sprinkles on instead. Thanks!

This recipe didn't work for me. I followed the first reviewer directions. Beating butter for 5 min, then icing sugar for 5 min, then flour in equal portions etc...and they wouldn't even form into a ball. I keep checking to see if I forgot an ingredient. My batch was VERY crumbly, and had to keep in a ball, that never seemed to cook.

I'm not much of a baker, and since every other shortbread recipe I've ever tried BOMBED, these were pretty good.  I will definitely make another batch.  (this is the only shortbread recipe from this site I've tried--all the others have come from cookbooks, family, & friends)

I have made this recipe several times and find that the cookies are extremely delicate (hence the 4 stars instead of five).  I add a teaspoon of vanilla to mine.  My sister can't get enough of these cookies!  She asks me to bake them all the time.

These were alright...  Really a bit to delicate for my family's taste; in both taste and testure.  Really did melt in your mouth like alot of other reviews had said; the issue was getting it to your mouth in one peice; ended up having to use a spoon to eat them at all.  Ended up making twice; added a tiny bit more flour like some people recommended; added the vanilla, too; and with one batch ended up adding half a teaspoon of baking powder; and they did end up a bit puffier (a bit more like the picture) and it didn't alter the taste noticeably at all.  We tried both jam and nutella (my kids are going through a nutella phase right now); and we did all prefer the nutella one more than tha jam; the marachino cherries would be nice but we don't get them readily here in Aust.  There are other cookie recipes that we enjoy much more than this one; will not likely be making this again...

I may come back and re-rate it because the failure of the cookie probably had more to do with the user... the flavor is great -- I made the mistake of using the food processor.  Don't do that.  Mine got really hot and by the 3rd addition of the flour (following the advice to beat and beat...), the butter broke down and it started cooking in the food processor.  I baked 'em anyway -- for 20 minutes(!) and they were delish, but I had to eat them with a spoon because they just fell apart.  So I mashed them up in a pie tin and made a no-bake chocolate mousse and put it in the fridge!  YUM!! I will try again with the traditional hand-mixer... cuz I love shortbread.

This recipe is amazing...my husband and kids loved them . The cookies melt in your mouth. I followed some of the  recommendations to beat the butter on its own for 5 minutes. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I  only baked them for 10 minutes. I am doing this one again.

Although these cookies taste like shortbread they should be called something else else because they are not shortbread cookies. The batter is very wet the cookie melts in your mouth which is not common with traditional Scottish shortbread.

These cookies are delicious!  They truly melt in your mouth.  Be careful about how long you bake them, mine took about 10 mins at 350.  I didn't add anything extra but I did beat them for about twice as long as was recommended.  The cookies in the photo are DEFINITELY not these!  To make mine a bit fancier I used a piping tool to sqirt out swirly shaped cookies and place the cherries at the peaks.  yum yum yum, all my friends are begging for the recipe!

I added vanilla extract because the batter was bland. The flavor improved, but the cookies were so fragile that I couldn't even pick them up without them crumbling! It became so frustrating that I canned the cookies and the recipe!

I made these last night. Very easy. I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract for additional flavor. I was unsure if I was doing it correctly because while whipping, the dough was crumbly - not smooth then all of a sudden - Smooth! Baked the first batch for 15 minutes until golden brown. The cookied looked good and smelt good. However the texture was hard to get adjusted too. Both my kids and Husband said the cookies had the texture of sand in the beginning and then paste towards the end. The flavor was great, but the texture was too hard for them to get adjusted to. Oh well. I really enjoy shortbread cookies.

Died and gone to heaven!! These are the BEST shortbread cookies ever! i did follow others in saying to mix, mix, mix. They slid off of my cookie sheet ( I inverted the sheets) and baked at 325 till edges golden. I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/4 cup more of con. sugar. Superb!

Yummy and melt in your mouth, but you definitely need something to drink while eating these! I changed them into jam thumbprint cookies instead of using the cherries. They stick to the roof of your mouth slightly... that's my only complaint other than they don't brown much >.

These tasted pretty good.  I think i didn't whip them long enough, but the dough ended up being tiny little balls that i had to squish together to make large enough for cookies.  They get a four because it was difficult to make them.  (Adding a little milk helped)

Good taste, but the whole concept is pointless.  Whipping it only makes it fall apart and the taste is just the same as any other butter/shortbread cookie.  Not worth the 15 min at the mixer.

Too buttery/oily for me.  I don't know what I did wrong, but my cookies didn't turn out like the ones in the picture.  All the cookies turned out flat.  I didn't have a beater, so that could be why.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  The cookie had a great taste, but I didn't like the sand-like texture as it crumbed in my mouth.  Maybe I'm just not a shortbread cookie fan.

I have made whipped shortbread in the past but lost my recipe.  I tried this one based on the high ratings, but the recipe was just average.  It should melt in your mouth not crunch. Also this did not hold its shape in the oven.  I won't make them again

Very good and easy to make. I used cherries for the centers and the neighbors said these were their favorite cookies (that's saying a lot since I baked for 3 days several types of xmas cookies). They are not too sweet but do tend to break easily. My husband and kids ate the ones that broke so they loved them.

These are just melt-in-your-mouth good! The only criticism I have is that the cookie is too delicate and half of them broke in half when I was taking them off the sheet - despite me following the recipe exactly. I made them a second time doing what someone else recommended and whipping the butter separately, etc but this did not help. My cookies also didn't turn out big and full like the picture. Both times I made them they looked 'full' in the oven but flattened as they cool. However I'm giving this recipe 4 stars for taste alone!

I just finished making these and they turned out fantastic!! I took the advice of whipping the butter first, adding the tsp of vanilla to it, then slowly adding the sugar and then the flour. Whipping between add more ingredients seems to work out great. I also added crushed pecans to the mixture and rolled them into balls. Delicious!!! Next time I am going to dip them in chocolate.Yummmy!!

Followed the recipe to a tee.  Cookie not too flavorful, once it melts in your mouth it is sandlike.  Would not make again, but will finish eating them so they don't go to waste.

Yummy. I creamed vanilla with the butter. These cookies are pretty fragile so I let them cool on the sheet. They were better the next day after they had time to set.

This was very easy and delicious! Like the others say, "it melts in your mouth". I used an electric mixer and cut the time for mixing. You can put almonds, cherries or evern peanut butter on top of this cookie.I love trying new stuff and this one sure will be in my cookie list. Thanx :)

This cookies came out flavorless and too dry (sand-like texture).  I even try to give them some flavor with almond extract, vanilla extract, ginger, cinnamon, strawberries...  I baked almost 10 batches of them.  Unsuccessful attempts, all of them. 

I'm a latinamerican, so I seek flavor.  Maybe this is the problem.

Am seeking a GOOD shortbread cookie recipe... so if you know of any other, please let me know.

These are good but a little weird.  The texture is very different.  They crumble very easy but they kinda melt in your mouth. We will see how they go over at the party I am taking them to.

Great recipe, but how do you whip them? I ended up using a beater. Better instructions would have been useful!

Great for christmas...You can leave off the cherries if you don't like them- try jelly beans, christmas smarties, but don't cook with jelly fruit slices, because they bubble and look gross!

Excellent cookie!  I found it easier and looks much nicer if you roll into balls and then flatten slightly before putting on cherry.  comes out nice an round
