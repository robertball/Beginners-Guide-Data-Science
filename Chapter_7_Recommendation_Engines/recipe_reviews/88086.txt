Enjoyable, especially for a recipe I picked to use up what was in the house! What surprised me most was that DH liked it too. He did say that it was too rich to eat a lot and suggested turning it into tiny turnovers for an appetizer. I only made one ingredient substitution, which was to use sour cream (added off the stove with the cheese) instead of heavy cream (didn't want to go to the store). I did have an issue with the recipe instructions. Putting the onion, bacon and mushrooms in the pan all at once resulted in the bacon staying quite unappetizingly flabby and pink and streaked with fat. I had to cook the mixture WAY longer to get the bacon to render most of the fat. I'd suggest cooking the bacon a few minutes, then adding the onion, cooking again for a bit and finally adding the mushrooms and cooking until they are done. Also, puff pastry rises and gets crisp better at 375 than the 350 the recipe calls for. I'd definitely recommend trying the recipe with puff pastry. The crispy lightness is really nice.

Oh my gosh this was awesome. I didn't use the dill and I had to use sour cream because I was out of heavy cream. Also, I baked in a pie shell because that's what I had. Will definately be making this again and again.

This was the best recipe...everyone that tastes it wants the recipe.  I made it a little lower fat the second and third time I made it and still got rave reviews.  I omitted the bacon and used fat free half and half.  An excellent recipe.

This was quite good!  Like other reviewers, I used a pie crust (both top and bottom) in place of the puff pastry, and increased the filling amounts by half again to fill the pie (i.e., 15 oz of mushrooms, etc).  It was quite tasty and filling.  If using a pie crust, here is the baking time/temp I used:  Preheat oven to 425 degrees and bake for 40-50 minutes until golden.  Cover edges of pie with aluminum foil for the first 30 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

The combination of the ingredients is fantastic! Thank you very much for the idea of how to put all my favourite things together! Next time I might try frying onion in butter first, adding 2-3 cloves of garlic and sour cream instead of cream like my Russian grandmother does. My boyfriend said the pie was immense and then ate it all, so I don’t even know if it’s better cold or not, must be equally good though

This was pretty good but it wasn't enough food for my family for dinner!  I ended up adding broccoli to the mushroom, onion and bacon mixture.  Mixing that mixture with swiss cheese and four eggs and baking at 300 for about an hour.  I omitted the pastry but I bet that would have been good too.  This receipe as is would probably make a great brunch or party dish!  It just isn't large enough for a family dinner.

Absolutly wonderful! I used Monteray Jack cheese instead of swiss. I also added some white wine and a little minced jalepeno pepper for some bite. Great! :)

I made this as a tart, omitting the top pastry sheet, and it turned out great! Friends loved it, and it's easy and quick to make. It will definitely be part of my repertoire of recipes for any occasion.

This was WONDERFUL!  I followed the recipe as written, except to add 3 cloves of minced garlic.  For the reviewer who thought the bacon would be raw - the  bacon cooks with the saute and finishes in the oven.  For the reviewers who found it runny, you didn't let it cook down enough.  When the cheese is added it firms up beautifully.  It was easy and delicious.  Thank you, and your mum Gatoula.  This will make a regular appearance on our dinner table.

YUM....I made this for Christmas and it was a big hit with the family.  A definite keeper!  The only change I would make next time is to reduce the cream slightly since I had quite a bit left over that I couldn't fit within the sheet of pastry without it leaking out.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Gatoula, this is delicious! The puff pastry takes it over the top!
Once, when I had none in the house, I used Pillsbury Crescent rolls. Baked them up first in an 8x8 Pyrex, making sure some of it went up the sides (you'll need 2 rolls for that method.)Added the mushroom mixture and baked about 20 minutes longer @ 325. It was outstanding that way, as well. My husband would even eat this stuff right out of the frying pan. Thank you so much for the recipe! He has requested it a dozen times since I first made it!

I have made this before, but I cooked the veggies until tender, added 1/2 tsp. black pepper, and stuffed the mixture into those large croissants and baked until just hot through...OMG!!  YUM, YUM YUM!!

This was wonderful.  I used a combo of mushrooms (shitake,cremini,white,portobello)and tarragon instead of dill. Used the puff pastry shells and filled them with mushroom filling.

This was very easy to make and yummy.  I used a pie shell for bottom and folded down the edges to give a peasant look.  Also used half sour cream and half heavy cream.  Turned out perfect, thanks for recipe.

The first time I made this, I thought it was too oily and heavy.   This time around, I made a few changes-- increased the amount of mushroom to ~14 oz, coarsely chopped the mushrooms before adding, added 3 small chopped scallions in addition to the onion, subbed sour cream for half the heavy cream, and added half a large cube of soft chicken bouillon during the reduction phase.    I also cooked the veggies down until past the phase where the mushrooms give off water, so the tastes were fairly concentrated by the end.  It turned out very savory and not nearly as oily as before.  Tasted great both hot from the pan and cooled in mini phyllo pastry shells.   I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic!  I doubled the filling recipe but only used one package of pastry. I rolled the pastry out just enough to fit a 10" quiche pan.  I took this to a party and before I turned around, it was gone!  Everyone loved it!

I cooked the bacon until it was almost crisp and then added the onion and mushrooms.  I fear that if I had not done that the bacon would have been fatty and unappetizing.  My husband thought that this was good with the puff pastry; I, on the other hand, will make this again but I will give pie crust a try and report back.  Something about the puff pastry did not hit my head right.

I left out the bacon as we've vegetarians but did use the cream.  Made the mistake of using 1/2 and 1/2 rather than heavy whipping cream.  I assume that is why my sauce ran out all over the baking sheet but it was still... soooo good.  Would suggest letting the mix cool a bit before adding to pastry dough.  Will make again!

This was SO good!!  I added a few small chicken breasts with this, cut up and mixed with the mushroom/bacon mix.  I used maple flavored bacon which gave it a good flavor.  I also substituted a leek for the onion, and used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 light sour cream to make it slightly healthier..  It was excellent!!!

This is AMAZING!  I didn't have any puff pastry so I used a frozen pie crust and it worked perfectly - I did add some extra mushrooms to fill it completely.  I also used fat-free half and half and a combination of swiss and havarti cheese.  I will definitely make this again!  INCREDIBLE!!  Thank you for sharing the recipe for a mushroom-lovers dream!  :)

This was a fabulous savory pie. I used blue cheese instead of chedder, and cooked some spinach with mushroom and onion because I wanted my hubby to eat greens. I used sour cream like other reviewers suggested. It looked so festive too because I made lattice pattern on the top. Nice vegetarian main dish!

My husband and I LOVED this!  I added 1/4 of white wine when I added the cream and cooked the bacon about 5 minutes before I threw in the onions and mushrooms.  The puff pastry was light and fluffy...the perfect comfort food!  Leftovers were amazing too.

I ended up draining some of the sauce before I placed the mixture on the dough, and then we used that as a nice topping when I served it.  :-)  

Next time, I plan to add spinach to the mix!  Yummmmo!

This was okay. I only had 1/2 a package of puff pastry, so I filled it and folded over the edges. I used bacon cubes and didn't brush the top with egg (there wasn't much of a top...). It ended up a bit runny, but had a rich flavor.

I made this for Thanksgiving with my parents (my first as a married hostess!) and it was a huge hit! I made a lot of changes the first time because I didn't have a lot of the things on hand, and it actually tasted as amazing or better than when I followed it to the T! My changes: subtract the bacon (to vegitarianize for a Friday), use 2% milk instead of heavy cream, add 1 tbsp butter to melt in after the milk, use a roll-out pie crust, and mozarrella instead of swiss (about 1/2 cup more than required, for good measure)! It's delicious!!

RICH but delicious!  I used fat free half and half and it was still rich!  I would reduce the cheese a bit also.  I'll definitely make this again.  *Update* I reduced the cheese just a little and it made all the difference!  Yum!

This was excellent.  Just make sure you bring the cream up to a boil, so it will thicken enough.  Otherwise it will run down the sides of the pastry.

A standout dish, and the mushroom filling is superb. Olive oil is not needed as the bacon produces plenty of grease. Like others, first cooked the bacon to assure it being crispy. Used 50% more mushrooms since filling an extra deep ceramic pie dish, and subbed 8 ounces sour cream for heavy cream. Extra ingredients were also added . . . 1 fresh jalapeno pepper (minced), green onions and about 1/ 4 cup dry white wine (sauvignon blanc). When made again, replace the puff pastry with a pie crust, and don’t lattice the top with dough. Bake at 375 degrees.

I have a very similar recipe and use fresh morel mushrooms when around in the spring instead of buttons.  It is to die for!  I have used buttons and it just isn't the same, but still very good.  Fresh morels are hard to come by so use what you have.  I am planning on making with a combination of buttons and adding some of my dried morels to add that special flavor.

MMMMMMMM!!! This recipe is great! Very filling and heavy but just so tasty! I have made this twice. The second time I didn't have fresh dill so I used dry dill from the bottle, it tasted good this way also. Great dish!

Wow!  Exceptional... My son is allergic to egg, so this recipe was perfect for his birthday party.  I read the other reviews and followed some of the suggestions and came up with my own version that was easily a favorite amongst my guests.  I doubled the mushroom and bacon, instead of dill I used tarragon, used white wine, increased the heavy cream to 1-1/4c and used 1-1/2c Jarlsberg cheese.  I baked it in a large glass pie dish until golden and puffed.  I made this the night before the party and just reheated it in the oven for approx. 20-25min.  Like I said, it was definitely a major hit and was the first to go.  Easily my new favorite recipe and recommend it to all.

This was SOOO GOOD and baked so beautifully! I took it to a potluck dinner; my dish was the only one to be completely cleaned and everyone wanted the recipe! After adding the cream, I cooked it until the cream was reduced... After placing the mixture on top of the first sheet of pastry, I brushed the edges with an egg/water mixture and then after placing the second sheet of puff pastry, crimped the edges with a fork. I didn't have any problems with run-off.

This is great. I didn't have dill or bacon so I used basil and proscutto instead. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the onion & mushroom.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I used Portabella mushrooms, Half and Half instead of cream, and dried Dill (couldn't find any fresh).  I doubled the Dill since it was dried, but will add more next time as I really liked the taste and think it could use some more.  The only other change I made was to deglaze the pan with some white wine and add it to the final mix.  Outstanding flavor and easy to make; I'll be making this again.  UPDATE:  We have made this several times now as it is often requested.  We mistakenly picked up fillo dough once and it might even be better.  We discovered that we like to add some extra grated Swiss cheese on top of the filling before putting on the top.  This makes a nice chewy crust that everyone loves.

I am so glad that I tried out this recipe, it was a huge hit! I used reviewer's suggestions and made this in a 9" pie crust, with a lattice top, I also followed the suggestions to make 1.5 times the filling and it was too much, I ended up filling a large ramekin with the extras. I sub'd dry dill for fresh, but kept the rest the same. I served it with a green salad and the three of us almost finished the whole thing. There was just enough left for one person for lunch.

So good! I used portobello mushrooms and added a bit more cheese. I also used a regular pie crust (that I made myself) because I forgot to get puff. Really great! My family said to add more bacon LOL! Tastes like what you'd get in a pub with gravy and nice salad. A definite keeper. Thanks!

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would.  I made a five course meal for my wife and mother, believing the leg of lamb would be the highlight of the evening, but the mushroom pie by far and away stole the show.  I used a blened of white, bella, and cremini mushrooms.... the differing types I believe added to the richness and character of the dish.  Speaking of which, be prepared for a RICH dish.  Very heavy, but very worth it.  This will quickly become one of your favorite dishes, as I know it has with my family.

Delicious recipe that I will definitely make again. I wanted to cook mushrooms that I had and found this recipe.  Because I didn't want to go to the store I substituted Cheddar cheese for swiss, ham for bacon and sour cream for heavy cream and made my own crust.  While the original recipe is likely even more delicious it turned out really well!

This  should have been an exceptional recipe considering all the great ingredients.  Guess again?
It just did not turn out well and cannot put my finger on why it did not turn out as expected.
So sorry as I had great expectations and I even bought fancy mushrooms.......

This was a great hit at Thanksgiving. I have given the recipe out 3 times since. I added green onions. In the future I will try this stuffing in filo cups and wonton wrappers. Mixing it up I'll always have a new hit with one basic recipe.

There were way too onions in this.  I cut up a whole onion as instructed, but I think that's what ruined the dish for me.  Also, for those who used raw bacon, I'm pretty sure you'r supposed to cook the bacon first.  I will not make this again.

Top Notch! Try subbing 1/2 ea Emmental & Gruyere. Very subtle flavours. You may want to increase the dill by just a tad.  
Try to get your mixture well into the corners so you don't end up with just pastry there. If you've used flour to roll out your pastry, you might want to moisten the edges for a good seal. 
Ovens vary so keep an eye on it the last 10 minutes or so.
There is a raging debate on whether they are better warm or cold.

I loved, loved, loved this! I only used 1/2 pkg of puff pastry, just folded the four corners over the filling. I subbed sour cream & a splash of reg. milk for the heavy cream. I sauteed the onions with the mushrooms but removed them since I only wanted the onion flavor. I love mushrooms and this was a great recipe! Thanks!

This is amazing.  I found the first time i made it, there was too much liquid.  The next time I made it, cooked the bacon crisp first, broke into pieces and added to the onions while they were cooking.  Also added some fresh asaparagus cut up at same time and cooked until barely tender.  Thank you for this great recipe. It's a keeper.

This made an excellent appetizer! I love most anything that calls for puff pastry and this was no exception. I used fat free half and half and some white wine for flavor. Sherry would have been really nice, but I didn't have any in the house. I cooked the mushrooms until most of the liquid evaporated so I had no problems with "run off". Absolutely delicious and thanks so much!!!!

Made this twice within 3 days.  First time followed the recipe but used tarragon instead of the dill.  Second time made it into a meal by adding browned ground beef.  Both came out great.  Really like the idea of making individual ones for snacks.

Delicious!  I followed some feedback from others and used 1 pie shell, added shitake mushrooms in addition to criminis and substitued cream with part reduced fat sour cream and part half and half.  
Hubby loved it!  Will definitiely make it again!

Turned out really nicely. Will make again.  Also froze very well. Im just cooking for one, so I froze about half the pie and re-heated it later.

Fantastic! We love the flavor combination of the filling. My husband digs the dish so much, he eats the leftovers for breakfast and takes some for lunch. The first time I made this with the puff pastry, following the recipe exactly. The second time I used a pie crust because I didn't have any phyllo in the freezer. Both ways it was fantastic!

This is incredible!  I have made this many times now as a side dish, an app, and also (added extra meat) served as the main event. This is one of my new fav dishes.

I will be making this again soon but will cut down on the "richness" by using less cream.  Overall it was a hit with my husband and company.  Pretty presentation too.

This was excellent!  Only change I made was to add 1 cup chopped red peppers to the saute.  As I didn't have any puff pastry, I used regular pie crust.  Very tasty.

GREAT RECIPE! I added spinach to the mix of onion and mushroom; added a bit of black pepper and used chicken broth while sautéing the onions for some extra flavor also used 2% milk- it turned out great!

We all loved this pie...my three year old kept asking for more and she is a very picky eater. I made it with a bit more mushrooms than called for and next time will try adding spinach. I would also recommend using the puff pastry while it is still a bit firm.

A keeper!  Made in tart pan with filo.  Doubled the filling and used 2/3 cup sour cream in place of heavy cream, 3/4 pound bacon, fried then the fat removed, 10oz baby swiss. Many thanks, GATOULA!

This mushroom pie was actually quite nice. After reading some reviews, I decided to add a few changes: sour cream, no dill, and frying method. Even though it wasn't such a big hit but it's still worth to make it again. Thank you for the recipe and thanks for the useful reviews.

Absolutely gorgeous!  My husband was not at home so I made a small pie for myself by using half a sheet of puff pastry and folding up the four corners. Will make it again for both of us

I have tried so many recipes from this site but have never taken the time to rate them.  I think it is time I did. We really enjoyed this and I'm sure anyone who likes mushrooms will definitely enjoy this too. I did fry up the onions along with the mushrooms before adding them and used a combination of swiss and chedder. I am always looking for something new and different and this was very nice. Thank you for a great new recipe.

Amazing!  We used pre-made pie crusts and mozzarella cheese it turned out wonderfully.  It has a kind of carbonara flavor that is just excellent.

I added ground beef seasoned with garlic salt because my family ate so much of the filling - it was delicious!  The puff pastry was a bit too much for us because it overshadowed the wonderful flavors of the mushroom mixture.  Next time, I will try a thinner crust (pie crust) so that we can enjoy the yummy mushroom filling more.

I was worried about making this pie as I am not that confident a cook.It was unbelievably simple to prepare and boy is it delicious! I have made it three times in as many weeks and will continue to do so.It freezes well and my husband loves taking a slice to work for his lunch. I usually have a little filling left over which is really tasty on top of some wild rice. This is a superb recipe. Thank you for sharing!

My family enjoyed this very much. I did use diced ham instead of bacon, and chopped fresh spinach leaves.I will try it again with asparagus and different kinds of cheese. Don't count on feeding many hungry people, it was enough for three but wouldn't have fed four.

We LOVED this, especially my wife.  I used 2 pillsbury pie crusts (top and bottom), and didn't have Swiss cheese, so I used an overfull cup of cheddar AND a third of a cup of mozzarella. Also, didn't have fresh dill so used dried dill weed. Lastly, threw a little grated cheddar over the top crust when there was 15 mins left on the bake timer. Came out GREAT! Fragrant and full of flavor. And EASY!

I think it might have gone better with regular pastry rather than phyllo.  Nothing wrong with it but with a mixture of gourmet mushrooms, heavy cream, fresh dill and Swiss cheese, it was not as good as anticipated.

Made it yesterday. It's good but a little bland. We used a couple extra slices of bacon and substituted Jarlsburg for the Swiss. Also added some ground cayenne pepper to perk it up. Oddly enough, the leftovers were pretty decent for breakfast. Still, every time I take a bite, it makes me want a piece of apple strudel instead.

Bottom line: delicious. Hubby asked that it be put into our regular dinner menu rotation.
Details: I'm not a fan of dill, so I swapped it out for fresh thyme and sage. Couldn't get any puff pastry in time, so we used pie crust. And I didn't have any Swiss cheese, so I used the lite Havarti I had in the fridge. I also threw in a clove of garlic, just because. Absolutely heavenly. Can't wait to try it again with the puff pastry! Although, if I do, I won't be able to use my adorable woodland creatures cookie cutters on the crust. ;)

Love this, it is so good. Not complicated and has the high end resturant look and taste. I used multiple types of mushrooms. Best eaten the same day, left overs are good just the puff pastry is not as crispy.

This recipe is fantastic! I make it all the time when it's cold outside, it makes you warm! I follow the recipe except I don't normally have Swiss cheese on hand. I use half a cup mozzarella cheese and half a cup Romano cheese instead! It's a weird mix but the pie comes out absolutely perfect every time!

Too much filling for the puff pastry, but could be just right for a pie pan.  Adding some other veggies would make this a well-rounded meal.  Let the cream (or whatever substitute) cook down before taking off the heat.

Very Good!  The only thing that I did differently was to double the amount of mushrooms. I used both button and baby bella mushrooms.  Will be sure to make again.

I didn't have a success with this recipe. The filling was too liquidy and was spilling everywhere, and also the puff pastry didn't cook all the way because of how liquidy it was. The taste was fabulous, but it just didn't work for me as a whole.

I had high expectations, but for me, this did not deliver. Not sure, but maybe the quality of the swiss cheeese I used was not good, so can't blame the recipe for that.

This pie was easy to prepare and so delicioius. I used half of a large onion so that it wouldn't overpower the more delicate flavors of the mushrooms and cheese. I used the recipe as a side dish with scallops in a light garlic butter sauce and it went very well. I found it serves 6 and not 12 as my guests wanted two pieces it was so good.

Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe! It was utterly delicious! Only variations were that I used Pillsbury pie crust and added two strips of bacon.. I scored high points with this meal :-)

I forgot to add any salt and pepper and it was still delicious. I used a regular pie crust on the top and bottom and added some green onions and about a cup and a half of fresh spinach as well as two extra slices of bacon. I plan on seeing how it tastes with feta cheese in the future.

As most others, my wife and I loved it.  My first time trying to cook with pastry.  I used a frozen pie crust, and sour cream in lieu of heavy cream.  Next time I will eliminate bacon so my two vegetarian sisters-in-law can also enjoy it.

AH-MAZING. I made this pretty much as the recipe calls for, but skipped the dill and added more bacon. Even good day #2. Held up amazing well in the fridge. EASY, EASY and it's being added to the Christmas day recipe list.

Easy to put together and delicious. When I told my husband what we were having for dinner, he looked shocked. Once he tasted it he raved about it and said definitely put it on the "have it again" list.

Wonderful!  I didn't have heavy cream but I did have a spray can of real whipped cream so I generously sprayed  in mounds of that so I probably used less than the 3/4 cup called for.  I think it was just enough.  Next time I won't use the Puff Pastry just because it was costly and I can make my own pie crust.  It sure was good though!

My husband enjoyed this very much.  I added spinach, which he loves and which I don't, so I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have without the spinach, but I will definitely save this one.  I ended up making it with canned mushrooms as my husband misunderstood my grocery list, and I used a refrigerated pie shell instead of puff pastry, but everything came out fine.

I made this dish over the weekend using fresh baby bella mushrooms.  It was excellent!  To make this a little lower in fat, I used decreased the heavy cream to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 of fat free sour cream.  Since I didn't have a pastry, I also used a pie crust as suggested previously and with about 10 more minutes of cooking time, it still came out great.  My boyfriend raved!

This is a keeper.  Tastes great and you can do so much with it.  I made it as is, but I can see where this recipe is so easily changed to what you have on hand.  I will make individual ones for party snacks.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!  Made in shallow, ceramic, French tort  pan and used regular frozen pie dough.  Backed off on the dill to about half.  A holiday favorite now going on 3 years!

The only changes I made were milk instead of cream  and pie crust instead of puff pastry ( don't have either in the house). It was Ok but not spectacular.  Not on my keeper list.

Very nice. I had a lot of mushrooms to use up. Stuck to the recipe but added 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce for umami flavour.  Smelled lovely while cooking. I just used a bottom crust, so it was a tart more than a pie. I look forward to taking a big square in my work lunch tomorrow!

I used 16 ounces of mushrooms and I added 5 triangles of Laughing Cow cream cheese.  I also cooked it at 375 degrees so that it would brown nicely.  It's a beautiful recipe - definitely a keeper.

Added a package of creamed spinach and turned it into a veggie lasagna using a  pumpkin or squash bottled spaghetti sauce.  Wow was it good. Will make many times if I can get the bottled sauce.

This was just ok. I followed the instructions as written. My filling never got thick so when it was cut it was kind of a soupy mess (this was after letting it cool for an hour). I also wasn't a fan of the thick puff pastry.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Like most other folks, I used pre-made pie crust. I also substituted sour cream for the heavy cream and dill, since my wife doesn't care for dill.

This filling is very good.  I used puff pastry and put it in a 10" pie pan.  I cooked the bacon before adding the mushrooms and onion to the pan, and substituted half & half for the heavy cream. I will definitely make this again.  I like the idea of increasing the filling.  Next time I plan to double the mushrooms to increase the filling volume and decrease the fat content per serving.

This was wonderful! I did make one change--when I tasted the pie filling, it seemed rather bland to me, so I sprinkled in about a 1/2 tsp rosemary. Perked the dish right up! Tasted so fantastic.

I thought it was pretty good! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I hardly ever add salt to things though and I felt this needed it. I'll definitely try it again, but maybe add in some garlic salt or something. It was a tiny bit bland.

First of all anything with mushrooms gets my attention. I made this recipe last night and I used a lot of the tips I go from everyone here, specially "the bouillon", absolutely needed. I enjoyed  very much making this delicious recipe, the end result was fantastic. I used the pie crust instead of  the puff pastry, I wonder how will it go with the puff?. This recipe can open your imagination for future dishes. Next time I will like to do something similar but with fish.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Oh my goodness,this is delicious. I read the reviews before I made this and one said it was tastless, NOT TRUE!! I did use sour cream in place of the heavy cream so it would not be as runny, then I followed the recipe. When it came from the oven it looked like a beautiful French pastry,it was so pretty I did not want to cut into it. The taste was so yummy, my husband made a pig of himself. And he says he does not like mushrooms! The other wonderful thing it is quite easy. Thank you GATOULA for sharing your fantastic recipe.

REALLY TASTETY!!!  I will definately make again.  The flavor is hard to describe.  Revisions made:  halved the muchrooms and onion.  Not as good with cressant roll dough.  Definately use a pie crust!  Also I only ever use just one- on the top of the pie.

Insanely delectable. I substituted sour cream for the heavy cream, but it was still a touch thin. A bit of flour or starch would help thicken the mushroom liquor. Make sure to use fresh dill, it really ties the flavours together.

Really tasty, but extremely rich and filling.  Also, I think 1 sheet of puff pastry would be plenty for the amount of filling called for.  Next time I would probably increase the dill to about a tbsp.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. I added a cup of sour cream with the cheese instead of using the heavy cream, and I used vegetarian bacon slices. It was very easy and looked nice. I will make it again.

I used several suggestions from reviewers and didn't follow the recipe and was disappointed! With the results I got, I would rate it only 2 stars but I gave it 4 since I didn't make it as written. I used pie crust and increased the ingredients by 1½.  I used tarragon instead of dill.  Husband and I thought the dish just ok.  I will try again and use the recipe as posted.

Edible, but only barely. It was incredibly bland. We ended up nibbling and making something else. Great idea, but no flavor to back it up.
