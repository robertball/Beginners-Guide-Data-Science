I made this cake for someone, and they thought it was the best. I did substitute coconut extract for vanilla in the icing. It was great, and I have to give the recipe to my friends.

This cake was really delicious.  I worried it would be oversweet, but it really wasn't, though I might try it with less sugar in the icing next time so it will have more cream cheese taste.  This was one of the moistest cakes I've ever eaten; I think that's because of the sour cream and coconut cream in the batter.  (I used light sour cream.)  My icing turned out a little runny, but I think that also added to the moistness, and it was kind of nice the way it dripped over the sides.  This is a fabulous white cake, and I will make it again.

I simply love this cake!!!!!!  I put it in a Bundt pan which I think turned out fabulous, especiall when you ice it and then sprinkle on the coconut.  At first, when I took it out of the oven I thought it would not be that good, then when I flipped it onto the plate, and iced it, it was not only pretty, but tastes Delish!  I will most certainly make this again and again.

I made this recipe for Easter to make bunnies cakes for hospital staff. Everyone raved. You need two inch high round pans - makes a lot of batter. I used fluffy cream cheese frosting from a can. Would suggest an apricot or raspberry filling for layers. Yummm! Excellent!!

I love to bake cakes and I'm always looking out to try new flavors.  This one's a sure winner!  It bakes beautifully and has a great flavor.  I did go on quite a hunt looking for the cream of coconut in my town, though.  I recommend baking this one the day before your event, the flavor is much stronger once it's been in the refrigerator overnight.

I made this cake last week and it was very good.The cake was very moist,but the topping was too sweet,one of my friends really liked it cold right out of the fridge.I would probably change the topping to something less sweet next time and add coconut.

I made this cake last night & served it today for a birthday party for my Mom. She loved it! My only changes were to the frosting: 1 tbls milk & 1 tbls coconut cream, & I added 1 tsp coconut extract as well as the vanilla.  I had to add a couple of tablespoons of butter since I only had two 3oz pkgs of cream cheese. Everyone LOVED this cake & its so easy to make. It should be called, Easy coconut cake. I will be using this recipe for a long time. Thanks for submitting it.

This cake tastes a bit strange. I used Pillsbury Moist White Cake, and I'm a bit disappointed with the flavor, especially after reading the wonderful reviews. Even after the sour cream and the coconut cream, I taste the boxed cake in here, I might try to make it with a different brand, as this Pillsbury has its own particular taste maybe due to the pudding already added in the mix.

Well I don't know if I did something wrong but I didn;t taste much coconut flavour at all. I just thhought the flavouring would be pouring out of it.  The only cocnut taste I got was from the cocnut I sprinkled on the top. I even added a teaspoon coconut flavouring to the cake mix. Next time I think I will add the whole tin of coconut cream and 2 teaspoons coconut flavouring. The icing on top was excellent. The presentation was beautiful.

I made this cake, for a sunday dinner I was having.  The cake came out great, I did change a few things about this recipe,  I use 1 cup coconut milk, instead of the cream of coconut and I also had 1 tsp vanilla.  In between the layers I used a mixture of 1 cup sourcream, 3 oz condensed milk, 2 tbsp sugar and 1/2 cup shredded coconut, by the way it taste really good.  For the frosting I used 1 (8oz package of cream cheese), 1 stick of butter, 6 cups powder sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla.  After frosting the cake I sprinkled it with shredded coconut, and added fresh strawberries to the cake.  Next time I think I will add some coconut extract.

I made this cake for my dad's 75th birthday because he loves coconut cake.  It was great!  Everyone loved it, and my family can be quite critical of my cooking at times.  I followed the recipe exactly. The only difference was that I had to cook it a little longer than the recipe called for.  I will make this again, and again, and again.  Loved it!

This was very pretty, and held together nicely. But it was really really sweet. I made it as dessert for Christmas dinner, and there is still some left on the counter today.  Will not make this one again. I will probably stick with Emeril's Coconut Cream Cake recipe.

Everyone, loved it.  I couldn't find cream of coconut so I used 3tsp coconut extract and a cup of heavy cream.  I also made it the night before, so the flavor really came out.

This cake was OK, but I have had much better. The icing just didn't go with the cake and was very sweet. The cake itself was not very moist. And 1 cup of coconut on the top didn't begin to cover the cake (I used a full 7oz bag, which is 2 2/3 cups). Not bad or anything, but I won't make it again.

Very easy!  Not as good as others I have had but it was very moist and thick.  Not what I was expecting.  I really didn't taste much of the coconut flavor at all.  but it was good.  Tastes better after sitting in the fridge for a while first.

This is a tasty, moist and tender cake.  I made the recipe exactly as written other than needing to increase the baking time by 15 minutes.  For me, the box cake flavor still peeks through.

Easy to make, very moist and not overly sweet.  I made it for an adult get together and received kudos - even from the guys.  The cooking time was closer to 35-40 minutes.

Great recipe and very easy.  Super moist and the coconut taste was great.  Everyone in my family loved it so much, I did not have time to frost it.  They eat it like pound cake. Will do again now that summer is almost here.

This cake was good, my family absolutely loved it and could not stop eating it (including my dad who rarely eats sweets unless he thinks they are "worth it" to him).  I, on the otherhand, thought it was good, but it was a bit sweet for my taste.  I couldn't eat very much of it before I felt a little sick.  Overall though, I'd say it was good.  It was extremely moist and had a good flavor.  I aslo baked it as stated in a 9 by 13 inch pan, but baked it a few minutes longer than called for.  Good recipe and VERY easy!

My book club group always request this cake when it is my turn to host!  My modifications: I make it 3 layers, baked for 25 minutes.  I add 1 tsp of coconut extract to the cake mix and to the frosting.  The 3 layers require 1 1/2 times the recipe and I always add extra coconut right into the frosting and pat more on the outside of this cake.

This cake was very good- super easy and super moist. I made as a Bundt cake (baked 40 minutes). I also added a macaroon filling that I got from the Chocolate Macaroon Bundt Cake on this site. Next time I would double the filling as that recipe was for a 10 cup Bundt and I have a 12 cup. The filling was tasty but there wasn't enough. I also used coconut extract for vanilla as I had on hand. If you love coconut, you will love this cake. I served it to our pastor who was visiting for our son's pre-Baptismal meeting and he raved about it!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I don't know if it was the coconut cream that added to a mix made it overly sweet. I even cut in half the sugar of the frosting, but it didn't help much. I learned to be careful with recipes using cake mix, because the mix is already too sweet for my taste. Any extra suggar added will be already too much.

Made this for my mother-in-law’s birthday and it was a huge hit!  Very moist and a pretty cake. After reading that others thought it was too sweet I decided to use unsweetened coconut cream and it was perfect. I also substituted coconut milk and coconut extract in the icing. If you have trouble finding coconut cream look in the Asian section of the grocery store.

My cake came out perfectly. it had the entire house smelling delicious and it was the hit of the occasion.   i will definitely be making it again.   not a fan of the coconut flakes,  it's just as delicious with just the cream icing or without.

I read most of the reviews before making this cake .  I noticed many people talking about how sweet this cake was so I decided to only use half of the cream of coconut and condensed milk mixture.  It turned out perfect!  Not too sweet like a cake you would get at a grocery store bakery but just sweet enough.  It was even better the next 3 days and didn't turn into a tres leches cake.  Thank goodness because my family hates the milkiness of tres leches.  The bad thing is I still have half of the milk mixture so I guess I will be making this again real soon.

My husband loved this!  He asked for a chocolate coconut cake, so I used a packaged Devil’s Food cake.   Everything else was the same, except he wanted toasted coconut also, so I toasted some of the coconut flakes and sprinkled them on top.  There is a huge piece missing from the picture-hubby couldn’t wait.

This is excellent and easy.  Per other reviews, I added coconut flavoring to both the cake and the icing, and due to some of the comments about the cake being too moist, added about 10-20% less oil and coconut cream to the cake batter itself.  Just fabulous!

The flavors of the cake and frosting were just perfect! The only challenge I had was in frosting the cake. The frosting stuck to the cake and didn't spread well, so it looked messy. But we all agreed it still tasted great!

This was a wonderfully moist and delicious cake.  I've been looking for a good coconut cake recipe and this is it.  I made it for Easter and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I decorated it with colored coconut nests and Hershey M&M eggs.

Cake has the coconut flavor, but really a dense and heavy cake. The cream cheese makes a good icing for the cake. I did add coconut flavoring in the icing also.

I was in the mood for coconut cake and am thrilled I found this recipe. Yum! I made the cake as directed and used two (2) 9" round pans. Be sure to grease / flour the pans well. I substituted coconut extract in the icing for the vanilla. I also used raspberry filling in the center. (Be sure to bank frosting around the outside of the lower cake, so the filling stays put.)  To the reviewer who complained that her frosting was too runny, to fix this, add more powdered sugar until you achieve the consistency you want. My frosting was too thick, and I added a bit more milk to thin it down just a pinch.  Overall, excellent recipe!

This was just okay for us. Baking time was 40 minutes, & I actually liked the texture of the cake, but the coconut flavor was nowhere to be found, & we did not like the frosting at all. After baking & frosting as written I actually removed the frosting & coconut to "fix" the cake. My coconut cream came in a 15oz. can so I poked the cake & poured the leftover cream over, allowing it to soak into the cake. Then, I mixed the frosting & coconut together then folded in an 8oz. tub of cool whip & frosted the cake with that mixture. I then toasted another handful (maybe 3/4 cup) of coconut for the topping. MUCH better, probably how I'd make it again - IF I make it again.....

This cake does have good flavor but I didn't care for the texture.  I actually found it to moist-a bit like a bread pudding.  The changes I made were to add 1tsp of almond extract and about 1/2c of coconut. For the frosting I used store bought cream cheese frosting and added about 2oz of cream of coconut.  Oh and this is a very sweet cake.

This is a great and yummy recipe.  I made it the first time for a birthday cake. It was so popular, everyone loved it. I made it again as cupcakes for a Mother's Day brunch and everyone asked for the recipe. I make one minor change - I use 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the oil. The cake is so moist and holds up well with the frosting. Love it!

OMG.  This is sooo good.  I used it to make a rabbit cake at Easter.  It was a perfect choice.  Moist.  Smells wonderful while cooking.  The family loved it.
