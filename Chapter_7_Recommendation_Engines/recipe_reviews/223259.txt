I tried this ceviche because there was an addition of red and yellow peppers which I had on hand. I really liked the addition of the peppers- it gives an extra crunch and color. This is first time that I've seen a ceviche recipe where it calls for poaching the scallops first, so I decided to give it a try. This method particularly is good if you want this dish right away, but I am fine either way (marinating the fish in lime juice for a while, so the flavor can be enhanced by the lime & orange juice). I ended up using pre-cooked fresh, not frozen tiny shrimp which worked well and aided in the quickness of the recipe. Overall, great appetizer to share with friends or inhale on my own with a side of tortilla chips!

Made a few modifications... Use fresh caught Sea Bass instead of Scallops, plus added a seeded Jalapeno. I also chose to not parboil/blanch and let sit in citrus for 6 - 8 hours and it was LOVED by all.

THANK YOU for this delicious recipe! My husband and I have searched AND eaten at various Mexican and Seafood Restaurants trying to find just the “right”Ceviche recipe. After living on a border of Mexico town for years, I’m sort of picky. The only suggestion we have is to “amp up the deliciousness” by adding some jumbo lump crabmeat.

Any hot pepper will work, just be careful how much you put in. Everyone loved it!

I made this for a party and everybody loved it!  I just did all shrimp, though and no scallops.
