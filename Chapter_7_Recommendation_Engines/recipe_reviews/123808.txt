A great gelatin salad for Thanksgiving.  I didn't really care for the skins on the cranberries and think I may try using the jellied stuff next time.  I didn't have a Jell-O mold so I used my bundt pan.

This is an old favorite at our house. I use Raspberry or Cranberry gelatine for the base. When I feel like some crunch texture, I put in a half cup of finely chopped celery.

This had a little too much sugar but was really fantastic otherwise.  Next time i would 1/2 the sugar but leave everything else the same.
