Very nice and easy to put together. I used baby beef liver and threw in some sauteed onions.

The whole family loved this recipe! My kids raved about how good it was & how tender it was. It was then that I told them it was liver. They didnt believe me! I ran out of bacon grease at the end, so added some olive oil. I also threw in some sliced onion & cover the skillet while I cooked it. Awsome!

Phenomenal!  I didn’t have the seasoning, so I dredged in flour with some garlic salt. Then I added chopped onions to the bacon grease.  Sooo good.  Best liver ever.

Made it with very fresh pork liver but followed the recipe exactly as per the instructions. Boy howdy was it good!! Made rice and Pork and Beans to go with it with some buttermilk biscuits. My family inhaled it in very short order while protesting that they did not like liver. Shut up and eat. It has actually been requested by one of the anti liver kids. Good stuff.

This was really good!  I did add onions to the bacon grease after taking out the bacon but otherwise followed the recipe.  We were not sure we even liked liver prior to this.  Would definitely give it a try!

I wanted to try a different kind of meat, so I purchased liver. This recipe gave that liver appeal. I made it twice already and will continue to make it.

Since I used turkey bacon I added Ghee and Coconut oil, bread it with Shredded coconut with spices (Italian seasoning, salt, bit of pepper, turmeric and shake it keep adding until gets color and taste in bag as desired, then add the liver) ENJOY! :) it was so delicious my 4 yr old eat it all.

I read how liver is high in choline and other essential nutrients but never tried making it. This recipe is fantastic! I also didn't have shake-n-bake so I used seasoned flour like another reviewer suggested and it was perfect!
