Wow! Okay, I know what needs to be done to make this recipe perfect. After reading the disappointing reviews, I made the following changes. In addition to the 1 ounce of semi sweet chocolate, I added 1/3 cup of cocoa powder. I also reduced the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup. I refrigerated about 4 hours & baked at 350 for 12 minutes. I also did not grease the pan and the cookies came off great. These turned out perfect! Great sweetness, nice and chocolately, chewy and moist, yet crispy.

I followed HEIDI's suggestion to add 1/3 cup of cocoa to the dough, but I still added 1 cup of mini- chocolate chips.  I cooked them 10.5 minutes and I was very pleased with the intense chocolate flavor and the chewy consistency.

We used to make these as kids, and this recipe was just what I was looking for!  I did make a few modifications, though.  I reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup; omitted the chocolate chips and added 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder to the flour mixture instead; and then added 1/2 teaspoon instant espresso coffee powder to the flour mixture as well.  I chilled the dough for 2 hours, but would refrigerate for more like 4 hours next time.  They came out great and my family wanted more...Thanks for a great recipe!

I may have missed something in the other reviews but ... this recipe seems to be missing some flour.  I couldn't roll these cookies, after leaving the dough in the refrigerator overnight.  I am still waiting for my first batch to come out of the oven and it has been over 15 minutes - they just look goopy!

The only change I made was using 1 1/4 cups of chocolate chips instead of the bar chocolate and melted it all in with the butter.  Turned out PERFECT! Delicious!

These were truly terrific!  I also adjusted the recipe by adding cocoa powder to the cookies (1/3 cup) and I think it was a fantastic choice.   I also made the cookies a little bigger than one inch after the first batch was a little too small. I cooked them for ten minutes and although they seemed way underdone, they firmed up marvelously. They were the perfect chocolaty consistency.   I was told "They're as good as Grandma's"! Great compliment!

These cookies are heavenly!  Soft, delicate, and very chocolatey! I didn't change anything (which is rare) I have made similar cookies before, but the addition of chocolate chips, really puts this recipe ahead of the others.

These are one of my brother's and sister's FAVORITE cookies!  Be sure to add the chocolate chips or they will not turn out, they will still be dough no matter how long you bake them.

These cookies are really very good. They have a little bit of a strange texture, kind of a cross between a brownie and a cookie, but the taste is so good that you don't mind. It is true that the batter looks like cake or brownie batter when you first mix it, but I put mine in the freezer for two hours before rolling it into balls, and it worked out fine-- although the dough did break my pampered chef cookie scoop. It warms up and gets sticky quickly. I rolled 12 balls at once and dropped them into powdered sugar, coating them thickly. I took another reviewer's advice and baked the cookies, one sheet at a time, on the second slot from the top of the oven. It took 12 minutes, then I let them sit for a full minute on the cookie sheet before moving them to a wire rack with a cookie spatula. None of the cookies broke, and none were thin. They puffed up nicely and look gorgeous. I got 60 cookies total using a teaspoon measurement, but the yield would have been higher if my husband and I could have stayed out of the dough- it was so good we kept eating it! I will keep this recipe and make these for Christmas, and I might just add some LorAnn Black Walnut flavoring to the next batch. These cookies are so good, and I think they'll make a beautiful and tasty addition to the Christmas cookie assortments I make for friends every year. I suspect that the previous reviewer either had dough that was too warm, or cookie sheets that weren't cool enough before use.

Well, this recipe only gets stars because the end product tasted great, but otherwise it was a hot mess. I agree with another reviewer who said these are not crinkle cookies-they aren't. They're more like a chocolate cookie with chocolate chips and some powdered sugar on the outside. I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was a flat, very light brown cookie that spread like wildfire-and I refrigerated the dough overnight. As you can see from other reviews, A LOT of people have made revisions to this in order to make it a true crinkle cookie and while I understand why, I don't understand rating this recipe 5 stars if I have to alter half of it. Great tasting cookie, but not a crinkle. It needs more flour-or possibly cocoa based on some of the reviews-to be a crinkle.

The name of these cookies is misleading because these don't taste like any chocolate crinkle cookies I've ever had.  The reason I used this recipe was because it called for butter rather than oil, but the chocolate flavor is not rich enough, the color isn't even dark enough.  Not only that they baked flat.  I knew that 1 C of flour just didn't seem like enough.  If anyone knows a recipe that is more a "traditional" chocolate crinkle cookie, please post it!!

They were really good. A little crunchy on the bottom, I think they baked just a minute or two to long. I think we needed to put more powdered sugar on them otherwise they look like more chocolate then with a white effect on the top. All in all it was a good cookie

A chocolate lover's dream cookie , and pretty too. But it needs changes to reach five stars. I added 1/3 c. cocoa, which is important for both the flavor and consistency, cut the sugar to 2/3 c. (more would be sickly), and cut the choc. chips to 2/3 c. If you're in a rush, stick the batter in the freezer for an hour. Then they're fairly easy to roll.

I made this recipe as directed last year and they did not turn out. The dough was a total mess to work with even after chilling for 3-4 hours, the cookies baked out really flat and didn't taste that great. 

This year I took some of the suggestions of other reviewers. I added 1/3 c cocoa and cut the sugar to 3/4 c. I also chilled the dough overnight (almost a full 24 hrs). I made sure to be VERY generous with the powdered sugar to get a good crinkle affect. Much less mess and I ended up with very delicious, very chocolately cookies. My only mistake was rolling the balls quite small based on last year's problem of them baking out so much. They did not do that this year so next year I will roll them a little bigger (at least 1 in if not a little more)

I've made versions of these for 30 years--but this turned out the best ever. I subbed 1/3 cup cocoa powder for the squares (darn--I was out) and used 1 1/2 cups melted choc chips. I made them a lot larger and they are PERFECT. (I also had to use 1/3 cup whole wheat flour--ran out of white!) Thank you so much!

These are not the chocolate crinkle cookies I usually make; a friend gave me the recipe a few years ago; of course, I misplaced the recipe card.  This version was not even close; the cookies were flat.

Delicious cookie which is only made better by using a very high quality coca such as Valrhona. The freezing for half a hour really works. Confectioners sugar should be put on as thickly as possible.I would make again and have added to recipe box.

I followed the recipe exactly. Except when my son dumped in the sifted flour all at once instead of letting me add gradually. The flavor was good but the cookies were very flat and all the powdered sugar was absorbed during baking so there wasn't any on top.

I had a recipe for these without the chocolate chips but they were too dry.  I like these much better.  However, I think they would be better with the mini choccolate chips.

They were pretty good. Kind of crunchy on the outside. I like chewy cookies, not crunchy. But they were very chocolatey and the powdered sugar on top was tasty too!

I lost my tried and true chocolate crinkle recipe, so I tried this one.  It was not as good as the other one I had.  The cookies were too dry and did not 'crinkle' very well.  I still gave it 3 stars because the flavor was pretty good.

They tasted fine but they are not normal chocolate crinkle cookies. They were very gooey and tasted like a basic chocolate chip cookie. They don't look like, taste like, or are the same texture as normal crinkle cookies. Would not recommend.

These cookies were delicious! They baked longer than we thought but they came out perfectly. The chocolate took a little long to melt so I would suggest a different method for the chocolate melting. Overall the cookies were great, I highly recommend them!

Great cookie!  I too added the cocoa powder and also 2 tbsp of espresso powder.  Refrigerated over night and they turned out perfectly!  This is definitley a keeper for the cookie exchange!

I tried these.  Hated them!!  They were too runny when I first made dough, but thought it would firm up when chilled.  Was firm out of the frig but spread out way too thin when baked.  Cookies fell apart.  Will NOT make again.
