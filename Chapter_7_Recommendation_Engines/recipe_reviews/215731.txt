Changed this a lot, made it much easier and still wonderfully tasty.  Used slices of sun-dried tomato polenta (off a roll) instead of lasagna noodles. I packed in as much spinach between layers as the pan could hold.  Instead of making my own,  I used an admittedly expensive bottled pesto and (because I'd forgotten to include them) spread ground walnuts fairly thickly over the top.  The result was super delicious and, I figured, a real meal:  reasonable protein and vegetables.

SO DELISH! I do not have a food processor or blender so I just made the pesto by roughly chopping all the ingredients and added to the ricotta cheese mixture.  The walnuts added some crunch and made it so yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome!  This was delicious!  We used whole wheat lasagna noodles.  The top ones were a bit crispy, but they were actually really good that way.  This could have another vegetable layered in as well - like asparagus, zucchini or eggplant.  Outstanding as is!

This was so good!!! I used jarred pesto and instead of ricotta, I used greek yogurt for health reasons. I sauteed onion & garlic along with the spinach and added mushrooms. I served this with cheesy baked cauliflower II from AR.

I didn't use all the pesto and it was still very strong. Next time I will use half the pesto, double the tomato sauce and maybe a little bit less garlic.
Anyway it was still a very good dish.

Great recipe! I followed recipe but added an extra 4 ounces of mozzarella and a layer of grilled sliced zucchini. Also used uncooked wheat lasagna noodles. I made this for a baptism lunch for a bunch of meat eaters...it had them asking for the recipe! YUM!!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I wanted to tweak my regular lasagna to add some spinach.  This one fit the bill.  I used jarred pesto instead of making my own because my husband doesn't like walnuts.  I used my food processor on fresh spinach leaves, which made it blend really well with the pesto.  I liked the way the tomato sauce balanced out the pesto/spinach combo, although I thought the amount of spinach and pesto it called for was a little overpowering.  I added mushrooms and 1/2 lb of ground sausage and 1/2 lb of ground beef because my husband doesn't call it dinner unless it has meat.  I gave it 4 stars because of the overpowering taste of the pesto and the noodles on top got pretty tough.  I advise just skipping the last layer of noodles and putting the cheese on top of the last layer of pesto.  It was a nice change.  All in all though, I think I'm going back to my usual lasagna recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as listed and it was to die for.  I typically do not care for lasagna but I couldn't get enough of this!

this is 5 stars for a couple reasons:
1. EASY
2. minimal prep and therefore minimal clean up
3. quick to make

I used prepared pesto, and nixed the walnuts (those are expensive! _ but have tried with them and it is delish) and frozen spinach (2 packs).
Also used packaged grated cheese (i buy several packages when they're on sale and freeze them).

my meat eating boys (husband and son) didn't even miss the meat... in fact they requested this dish!

Used 2 packages of frozen spinach, defrosted in the microwave and did NOT squeeze it. The extra liquid is necessary because I used dry noodles. Also used 1 tube 4oz of Basil Herb Blend because that's what I had in the fridge. Used a gigantic roasting pan as a 9x13 is not big enough. Added 1 box of fresh mushrooms sauteed with 1 chopped onion. 1 whole jar of tomato sauce on the bottom and 1 jar on the top. 1 hour in the 350 oven.

I used regular noodles that I cooked first. I omitted the garlic as the pesto has plenty. I used fresh onion and herbs. I doubled the sauce and mozarella cheese. Lasagna is one of those dishes that you just have to go with what you are used to and according to your taste. I put sauce and mozarella on top. This is a good recipe that I will make again.

This was really yummy and my guests enjoyed it too!  I used four cheese pasta sauce in place of the sugar free tomato sauce and used 2 boxes of frozen spinach in place of fresh.  I also used the no-boil noodles and I think that is why the only change I would make is to increase the tomato sauce because the tops and sides of the lasagna were too crispy (I actually ripped off the top pieces, they were so hard and inedible).  So next time I would add another half jar of sauce or maybe even the whole jar.

We enjoyed this!  It would work probably just as well with premade pesto from the store for a faster recipe (but that's personal preference, of course it was great homemade) and I didn't use as much spinach as it called for because I didn't have it and it was still delish.  Will make again!

Good recipe. Walnut pesto was the rockstar, very yummy. I changed the recipe, used one lb of Ricotta cheese instead of two, doubled the spinach, and used very less cheese.

Pretty good but could be bettered with a few changes. For us, the basil overpowered the mild and subtle flavors of fresh baby spinach and walnuts, and for that reason, we would cut back on the 3 cups packed fresh basil (i.e., 6 ounces) to around 2 cups (i.e., 4 ounces) or a bit less. If you prefer a pesto with a strong basil flavor over a less intense one, then make the walnut pesto as written. Unlike most vegetable lasagnas, this recipe tends to be dry, especially the lasagna noodles around the edges of the pan. To counteract that tendency, increase the amount of tomato sauce and squeeze out less water than usual from the spinach as the pesto itself was dry. Basically, half the sauce (12 ounces) is spread at bottom of pan, with two subsequent layers of sauce (6 ounces each) which is really thin when covering a 9" x 13" pan. In spite of placing foil over the pan per the instructions, donâ€™t waste putting oven-ready noodles on top as they harden and curl up at the ends, and not appealing to look at or eat.

I don't add the walnuts (cept in the pesto), but I add lots of spinach. I like this recipe much better with ricotta than a substitute like cottage cheese.

I followed this recipe to the T -- and the result was a great big dish of watery slop. The taste was only so-so after all the prep time, but the appearance was awful. Never again.

This was a lot of work and ended up costing a lot of money.  I only made 1/2 the recipe but still ended up spending $12 on 15 oz. of fresh spinach.  My fault, I didn't see until later I could have used frozen.  Would have saved a ton of time and cost a whole lot less.  There seems to be way too much pesto and not enough cheese.  One-quarter pound of cheese for 1/2 the recipe isn't very much.  I ended up using a half pound.   Putting non-boiled noodles on the top layer was not good.  After 40 min. of baking covered in foil, they were still hard as a rock.  I ended up putting more sauce on top, then the remainder of the parmesan cheese.  I ended up using more sauce than was required, which I think helped.  I think there is a mistake in the directions.  It states to use 1/2 of the sauce on the bottom of the pan, yet you are supposed to repeat all the layers 2 more times.  Shouldn't that be 1/3 of the sauce at the beginning?  I used my favorite jar of Trader Joe's marinara and it was good but not enough to cover the heavy taste of pesto.  Sorry, none of us cared for it.

It was a bit tasty, and I didn't get the third layer on because my dish was not high enough, and though I had used fresh spinach once I cut the lasagna, I had a watery dish. However, I am giving 4 stars because it was absolutely delicious!!! Will make again.
