Very simple, very tasty. Thank you. 
BTW when you change a recipe by decreasing the spices in it, well it's not quite fair to call it bland, now is it?

Excellent and simple. The Chinese 5-spice was a nice and I used fresh ginger instead of powdered.

The Chinese five-spice flavor was over whelming. Unless you want a very strong flavor of 5-spice cut the amount added. I will make it again and add only enough 5-spice to taste a hint of it.

I used the full amount of spice with white quinoa. What a great dish! Oops, I used my garam masala instead of Chinese 5-spice. Sorry...I just have to rate it because it was so fragrantly good. Both of these mixtures have many variations, so that will affect your outcome. I have seen 5-spice with cinnamon as the first ingredient, and others with szechuan pepper as the first! I like the garam masala on this site, and it is probably milder than most 5-spice recipes. I plan to make this on a regular basis.

Not for us. Decreased the amount of 5-spice and it was very bland. Could only remotely taste a bit of cinnamon.

Very tasty! My husband loved it too. I added some roasted carrots and onions in the final few minutes of cooking. I served this with pork tenderloin and it complemented the pork wonderfully. So easy and delicious. Thanks for this great recipe.

First time making quinoa and I followed this recipe exactly as directed. I used Inca Red Quinoa, which came out perfect and delicious! My hub and I both had second servings, even. I did add a couple dashes of turmeric b/c it's good for the heart, but no modifications other than that. Great recipe!

Fantastic! Even the two little kids love it! Instead of water, I added some bone broth that we have going in our slow cooker 24/7 during the winter months. As a result, ours was not as salty as I think it would have been had I used bullion, but this was easily rectified by adding a couple pinches of salt after cooking. I also used freshly grated ginger so there's a little extra spicy kick.
