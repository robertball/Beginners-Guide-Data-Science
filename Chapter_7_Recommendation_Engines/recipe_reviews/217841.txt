This was a great dip but I gave it four stars because I didn't like it as-is. After making the recipe the flavor wasn't quite right for me so I added about 12 oz of cream cheese and that made it soooo good! Next time I think I will skip all the seasonings and just use taco seasoning. Also cut out the mayo reduce the sour cream to 1/2 cup and add 16 oz cream cheese. Finally I love love love green chilies but could not taste them so I'm going to try 2 cans next time. Another thought I had was replacing the can of regular corn with roasted corn. Would give it a smokey kick!

This is yummy! My girlfriend Brandy taught me how to make this and she calls it "Crack Dip". Instead of sour cream you can sub in cream cheese and taco seasoning can be subbed for the adobo seasoning. We like it chilled but I bet it'd be great baked too.

I've made this twice now on successive days for bbq's over the Memorial Day weekend. People can't get enough of it! I took some of babygirl77's tips and added a few more tweaks: -No mayo -Two pkgs cream cheese softened -8oz of sour cream -1 packet of taco seasoning in lieu of the other spices in the original -1/2 can of black beans -1/4 cup medium "thick and chunky" salsa I cut the cream cheese into smaller bits to make it easier to mix. Use a whisk to mix cream cheese sour cream and taco seasoning. It's so good. I even topped my steak with a hefty dollop. Yum!

I made this for Memorial Day weekend and it turned out great! I added 2 cans of green chilis but kept the rest the same. I think it was great like that! The only way I'd add cream cheese would be if I was going to serve it hot because I would think the cream cheese would make it too thick. I will definitely make it again! Everyone loved it!

This was excellent with dinner. Then the next night I was craving a "chips and dip" snack. Fat free tortilla chips and this dip were almost a guilt free afternoon snack.

I taught a group of K - 4th graders to make this. The process was great for kids to do - lots of components to it so a lot of action for them. Although in my opinion it didn't look all that appealing it tasted delicious and the kids ate it up.

This dip is amazing. At first I went light on the spices just because it seemed like a lot but after a quick taste I added the rest. It made a huge difference. My son said this was the best dip I've ever made and it was the first thing to disappear at the work potluck. Always a compliment! I wouldn't really change a thing with this recipe. It's great as is. Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe for an office party as well. I made some adjustments by adding another can of chiles a little extra garlic adobo seasoning and chili powder. It was a huge hit. Had to make a little extra for my kids at home and they fell in love with it too. It's one of our favorites!

This is a nice dip for something different. We definitely thought it needed the 24 hours for the flavors to develop and blend. I took this as one of 2 dips to a lake party and one of 3 dips as a birthday treat to school. It was well received by both groups. Rather than use adobo seasoning because I didn't have any I used canned adobo peppers and the broth instead. This worked well. I served this with tortilla strips but think it would work very well with celery sticks too.
