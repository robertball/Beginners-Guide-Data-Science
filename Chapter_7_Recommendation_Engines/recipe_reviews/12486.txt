Oh my, oh my! When I found out that my dinner guest was going to be delayed, I decided that I would try to find a QUICK pie to fix, knowing chocolate pie was his favorite. When I came across this recipe, I decided to go for it as I happened to have all the ingrediants called for. I almost thought it was a mistake when it called for the ingrediants to be put into an already baked pie crust and baked again, but it's not. It got RAVE reviews, and is simple as, well, pie! I suggest that you try this recipe AS IS before fooling with it...it TRULY beggs for some rum extract, I think, but a FABULOUS and impressive pie all on it's own. Am making three for a funeral dinner tomorrow. P.S. If you have brown sugar, use it. This is the one of few recipes I've made that I really believe would be noteably downgraded by a substitute. FABULOUS. This is going to be one of my new favorites to make and take. One you can really be proud of.

This was a disaster. I baked longer than recipe called for on bottom rack and the next morning when I cut the pies to take to a pot luck they oozed out of the pan in a gooey mess.
A waste of time and money.

Very rich tasting pie. Cool whip would work well too instead of the whipping cream.

This was yummy!!  I thought it was going to be really dense but it was nice and light, just the right amount of sweetness.  I used plain whipped cream as I didn't have any cream on hand to whip so I'll definitely make it with the flavored cream next time.

This was great.  Not sure how you can mess this up...unless you don't put the spice whipped cream on it!

This is a very tasty dessert, but mine came out more like a giant cookie than a pie, so I was disappointed.  I might have done something wrong, so I'll review this again when I've made the dessert a second time.

I was worried about this recipe, but I promise it works out well!  The spiced whipped cream is an especially nice touch.  I also used more chocolate chips, less walnuts, but that's just my preference.

I was a little leary when I saw no butter or shortening.  I'll go back to my own version of this.
