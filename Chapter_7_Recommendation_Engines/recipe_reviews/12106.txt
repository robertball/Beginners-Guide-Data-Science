My best friend introduced me to this pie when he entered it - and WON - a company-wide baking competition! It was sooo delicious that at least 20 people begged him for the recipe. Since then I've been hooked! I make it whenever I have company, serving it hot out of the oven with a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream! I am always flustered by the overwhelming compliments.  Warning, though: this pie is messy - don't expect a clean slice!!!! Also, I usually end up filling 2 pie crusts with the filling (it makes a LOT) then double the topping recipe. DEEEEE-LISH!!!!

Finally, an apple pie recipe I can give five stars to!  I've made this three times now,
tweaking it a bit each time and this last time was the best.  
Notes: 5 and a half granny smiths instead of 7 okay.  May want to lower tartness by using a couple
apples of a different type.  Add 1/3 cup brown sugar in the filling along with the 1/2 cup
white sugar.  Add 1/8 tsp allspice, 1/16 tsp ground cloves.  Cut apples really thin and spiral when laying
it out in pan.  Crumb topping is a bit powdery, needs work... turns out crispy and sweet which works well
with the tartness of the apples.  May lower heat a bit since topping was dark.  Didn't affect taste, just the look.

I have made this pie twice now, and both times it came out fantastic.  The first time I did not use all of the topping, nor did I pat it down, thus, it created a wonderfully crumbley texture for the top.  The second time I patted it down and it made more like a crust.  Both are great, just different effects.  Everyone raved.

This was a great apple pie - the taste was perfect: tangy and just sweet enough.  I must have sliced my apples a little too thin because the filling came out like applesauce (after all that work of spiraling them!) and I like a little stiffness to my apples so you can tell they are apple slices!  The topping was great - beware to not pat it down too firmly or it becomes very hard. Can't wait to try the topping just crumbled on top.

Awwwwwwwesooooome. I made this for my roommates tonight and we loved it. The said it was better than this pie restaurant that we love. :) I think next time I will cook the crust longer before I put the pie filling in so it doesn't get soggy on the bottom.

Easy to make and delicious!  You can even use two prebaked regular crust instead of one deepdish.

Absolutely delish!!  This pie is my hubby's favorite pie.  We love the crunchy texture of the topping coupled with the perfectly sweetened apple filling. I am able to fit all of the apple filling with all of the topping in my pie....I'm not sure why others are having problems with fitting all of the ingredients in their pies???  Please try this recipe...you will not be sorry!  Thanks for submitting this great recipe.

Perfect!  I baked in a 9" square pan and followed to a "T" The only thing I would do next time is to add only 3/4 of the topping. This is a yummy apple crunch delight!  Very sweet, goes great with ice cream.

I have made this recipie many times and it always turns out great.  I received losts of compliments. Try substituting northern spy or machintosh apples, instead of the granny smith apples, for a sweater filling.

I only had granny smith apples and thought that the filling needed to be a little sweeter even though the topping did add the extra sweetness.  If I make this again, I would follow the suggestion of using a few sweet apples in addition to the granny smith apples.

Great and easy pie! First time making it. Baked for a total of 50 minutes and it was perfect. Made three modifications:  1. Added chopped up pecans to the topping 2. Added 1 tsp vanilla to the apple mixture 3. Moved oven rack to bottom position and covered edges 15 minutes in w/foil to prevent burning

This pie is a winner!  I make it all the time for dinner guests, church potlucks, etc.  About the only variation I do is adding some pumpkin pie spice to the apple mixture for a little more flavor.  Do be sure to slice your apples thinly unless you like a lot of crunch.  I suggest covering loosely with foil when you turn the heat down to avoid getting the top too dark.

My hubby and sister said that this is the ultimate apple pie and I should never use any other recipe!! I changed nothing this time, but next time I will cut the topping in half because it boiled over onto the baking dish that I (luckily) had underneath the pie! It was way more topping than necessary and I actually had to throw some away! I just sprinkled it on top instead of patting it down and the presentation was gorgeous. My sister ate it warmed in the microwave with butter pecan ice cream, yum! Thanks a lot for this easy and delicous recipe

I thought the apple filling and crunch topping were excellent, but did anyone else burn their crust? I think the low rack position and high temperature gave a little too much heat. Did this happen to anyone else?

This recipe is good.  My family liked it more than me.  I just didn't like the topping as much I thought it would be crunchier.

This was really good. The reason for only 3 stars is because my pie started to burn immediatley after the initial 15 minutes at 450. I would rewrite it so you cover it with tinfoil either right away or after 10 minutes. I used Fuji apples and next time I would add a half a cup of oats to the topping as it was very sweet. I will make this again with these changes.

Very good. I used all granny smith apples, which was a little tart. Next time I will use a mix granny smith and sweeter varieties.

Great!  Made as written except I didn't bother with the whole spiraling thing -- mixed the apples with cinnamon, flour, etc. and dumped them in the pie shell, jiggled a little, put on the crumble, and there was dessert!  Yum.

This was my first attempt ever at baking an apple pie & it was a success.  I did find the topping a little difficult to work with, it ended up being more a ball of mush than crumbly, I am sure this was inexperience but newer cooks should be aware of it.  I added walnuts to the topping which was great.  They are less bitter than pecans but gave it a wonderful crunch.

I tend to make a one crust apple pie with a topping.  The rating is for the recipe as is.  I did not add the lemon juice and had only 5 cortland apples on hand.  I added 1/8 cup crushed cornflakes to the bottom, before adding the apple filling.  I had to cover the pie after the first 15 minutes, as the topping was getting too brown.  Very tasty with a super crunchy topping.

This pie was fabulous! Very easy to make...my 10 year old daughter made most of it for Thanksgiving dessert! It had a sweet crunchy topping and the apples were cooked perfectly!! I did lower the temperature a bit to 425 degrees as one reviewer suggested and I didnt put all the flour in the topping which another reviewer suggested. All in all I will definately be baking this pie again very soon!!

This was very good.  The only issue is that the grown ups seemed to steer clear of the pie because the topping was a bit intimidating--all that sugar!  With kids, this doesn't seem to be a problem : )

This tastes like regular apple pie to me (which is good)but I think regular apple pie is easier to make, so I probably wouldn't use this one again. Thanks, though!

I thought the filling came out very mushy.  It looked like dark apple sauce rather than apple pie.  Maybe I cut the apples too thin because the recipe said not too thick.  I give it 3 stars because my husband liked it and the crumb topping was very good.

Could taste the molasses just a tad from the brown sugar.  Recipe even worked putting apples in pie shell first and then moving apples to work flour,sugar,spice mixture down.  Liked subbing quick oats to 1/3 of topping mixture.

I couldn't find my receipt for this and am so happy to find it here, thank you...my daughter wanted me to make her favorite apple pie for Easter..   For nut lovers, I find that if you chop up 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pecan's and add it to the crunch topping it makes it even better.

Very good flavor.  My husband really liked it.  I thought the topping was a bit too thick so will reduce the amount next time.

I've made this recipe twice and it was great exactly as written. The first time I made the crust hard and crunchy by patting it down well before cooking. The second time I didn't pat it down, and it was looser but still had crunch. Loved it both ways!

I could not take a pic because it is all gone.  I used red Delicious apples because they were going to go bad.  Since they r sweeter I doubled the lemon.  So Good!

I made this for Christmas dinner and wanted to thank all my peeps on AllRecipes.com!  Your reviews have NEVER steered me wrong.  :)

This pie was a hit with the MIL, SIL (who is super picky about her food...) and my husband (who hates apple pie, no joke). The recipe was great, I didn't modify it all, but I did jack put he temp to 400 the last 15 minutes to get those apples to fall down and the juices to get thicker and bubbly.  Perfect.  Won lots of compliments and preserved my cred.  Thank you for posting it!!!

Everyone Loves this pie & the crunchy topping.  I used a regular pie crust, 5 apples & piled the apple filling higher in the middle. I patted about half of the topping down over the entire pie and put the rest on more by holding one hand along the edge of the pie to catch the crumbs that fell over the side while sprinkling the crumbs with the other hand. It cooked down and a bit of crust was pushed over the side of the pan. I didn't have granny smith apples so I used Braeburn. Any tart apple will work. I used a little more cinnamon (1/2 tsp or so) in the filling and added a bit of vanilla extract (1/2 - 1 tsp) to the filling. This pie held together really well after slicing when it was room temp. Even when I cut it early, though the piece I removed didn't look perfect, the filling stayed in place. Other apple pie recipes I've used have had filling that was too runny unless completely cooled. Tip: I couldn't find my pastry blender to cut the butter into the sugar mixture so I sliced the butter into pats (a cheese slicer with the wire & roller works great) and then just used my fingers to pinch the butter & sugar mixture until the butter was all pebble sized. Not all of the sugar mixture blends in with the butter, but the topping works nonetheless.

I reduced the amount of topping in half and thought that was plenty of crumble for the top of the pie. Just so you have a weight for the apples, 2 to 2 1/2 lbs of apples is a good amount.

I think I might owe my boyfriend's parents fondness for me to this pie.  I brought them one when I first met them and his dad didn't stop talking about it for weeks.  Everyone I've made this pie for has LOVED it.  The brown sugar crust really makes it something different.

The apple pie was delicious! The only thing I changed was leaving out 2 apples.  My Granny Smith apples I bought were big.  The topping came out a little hard and I think got over baked so the next time I'll put foil on top of it for the first 30-40 minutes and see how that works.

This is the only apple pie recipe I will ever make again. The crispy topping is such a nice change from the regular two-crust method. It only takes about 6 good sized apples to make a mile-high pie. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.

I am not an experienced cook and this was the first pie recipe I have ever attempted.  I have to say that this was by far the best apple pie I have EVER tasted and I was astounded that i'd cooked the thing myself.

I subsituted Granny Smiths for English Braberns as I felt that UK Granny Smiths don't have enough tartness for my liking.

this is very good, however, i felt there were too many apples.  maybe mine were too big to start with.  the overall flavor was wonderful.  i think i will use more sugar in the filling.  needed a little more for my taste.  overall, worth the effort of peeling all the apples!  :)

A definite winner!!!!  Easy to follow directions and the result is awesome!!!  Everyone I fed this to loved it...the perfect combination of tart apples with a sweet, crunchy cinnamon topping.  Don't be put off by the 1/2 cup butter...follow the instructions exactly and you'll be pleased.

"This is the best apple pie I have ever eaten. It was excellent.  I believe that's the best damned pie I've ever had." That's what my Dad said and apple is FAR from his favorite pie....I thought this was very easy to make and the directions and recipe were right on....Thanks Lisa for my new recipe!!!

Wonderful apple pie recipe. Have never found one that I liked. This one is it! Even the non apple pie kid liked it. I did as one other reviewer suggested and added 1 1/2 cups sugar not 1/2.

Nothing too fancy about this dessert. However it did seem to make a big mess in my cookie sheet. Be advised use a cookie sheet.

My husband' parents and grandparents went nuts over this pie!  It was easy to make, beautiful to look at, and tasted fantastic!  It wasn't runny like some pies can be - held it's shape beautifully.  Thank you for this recipe!  It has become my all-time favorite apple pie!

This pie is fantastic!  It's the first time I've ever made an apple pie, and the instructions were easy to follow.  The filling turns into this ridiculously delicious caramel apple mix and the house smells amazing while baking.

The only change I made was doubling the topping recipe as someone else suggested and making two pies, though be careful with the depth of the crust:  this recipe is perfect for one deep dish pie or two shallow pies (when you make a bit more topping).

I also pressed the topping down a bit as others suggested so it formed more of a crust, and that worked out well.

This is probably one of the best apple pies I've ever had (or made)! I doubled the recipe so that I could use up a bunch of apples from our morning of apple picking, and I have enough crumb topping leftover to make an apple crumble later this week.

After about 30 minutes of baking, I did cover the pies with aluminum foil with a big hole poked in the top for venting, but I do this with all pies because I don't like the flavor of an overly browned crust.

The recipe is excellent!

Great recipe for pie filling and topping. I added a bit more cinnamon to the apples and a hint in the crumb topping too. I love cinnamon, so maybe what the recipe called for is in line with what most folks like. I also added a splash of vanilla. If I had it on hand, I would've added allspice instead of nutmeg. Anyway, very minute changes to a nearly perfect recipe. I always get compliments.

I made two apple pies this weekend from apples we picked, not Granny Smith. This pie was devoured!!  The family was literally bidding on the last piece!  The other pie was only half eaten. The only change I will make is this was a little too moist, I will bake it a little longer next time, which I was informed will be Thanksgiving!

I've been using All Recipes for years and years but just now created an account to rate this pie!  O-M-G best apple pie I have ever had or made!  The only thing I did different is I did not lower my over rack (because that scared me...afraid it would burn) and I added an extra TBSP of Flour to the apple mixture (because I hate a runny pie), but other than that followed it to a T and it was perfect!

I have made many apple pies in my time, but this recipe is 10 thumbs up.  The topping is delicious, and with a few preference tweakings, I think this is the best apple pie ever!  Also turns out pretty as a picture.

Simply, Easy & Impressive! Saves you money because you only need 1 ready-made pie crust!  So  when I buy a 2 pack of ready-made pie crust I can make 2 pies since you only need 1 pie crust for the bottom of the pie & the topping is crumb!

This is absolutely wonderful pie. This is the first time that I've made an entire pie from scratch (crust and all). I used half granny smith and half jonagolds since they are fresh this time of year. There were so many apples that it seemed like too many but they shrunk down and the crust was perfectly filled. It cut beautifully too. Everyone was happy. Wouldn't change a thing!!!

I was looking for a apple crunch recipe like my mom used to make and this one is as close to it as it gets. My family liked it so much that it dissapeared in a flash. My daughter came home from school looking for another piece but nothing was left. Now I am making a second one!

I have never made apple pie before and thought I would give it a try.  I only had 4 apples and did not think that it would be enough... I was wrong.  Even with just 4 apples the pie turned out GREAT.  I loved the topping, and the filling was absolutely delicious, my friends loved it.  I will definately be making this pie again.

I tried this recipe because it looked delicious and I had a one crust pie crust already prepared.  It turned out to be the best pie I'd ever made.  Thank you so much!!

It turned out great. The top crumb crust made it look really special.

Great old-fashioned look with pie heaped high in the dish.
Recipe has a mistake -- one of the half cups of white sugar needs to go in the crumb topping.
