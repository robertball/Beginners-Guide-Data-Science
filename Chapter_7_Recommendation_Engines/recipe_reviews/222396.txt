I did this as an accompaniment to Chef John's Steak Sandwich and WOW! We loved both. Did not change a thing. This will be a frequent side dish with beef in our household. Thanks so much for sharing!

We thought this was delicious! I actually had some leftover 'garlic and herb' breadsticks to use up, so I used them in place of the Italian bread (which worked out great), and omitted the thyme (we don't care for it). I added no other herbs b/c the bread had enough. This was very nice and super simple to put together. Hubby said that it sort of reminded him of stuffing, but more 'gourmet', and I agree! I think that you could use any herbs that you like and come out w/ something delicious. I didn't really have anything to serve this w/, I just made it b/c I needed to use up the bread, but I could totally see this going great w/ a steak dinner, as mentioned. I will def use this recipe again, and I can't wait to play around w/ the herbs/spices! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great side dish for grilled/broiled/baked beef meals. Made it like stuffing in a 9x13 in the oven. Used Blue Cheese since that's what I had and added a few baby bella's. Just make sure you add enough stock to keep it from drying out.

I have made this a couple of times and it's amazing.  One ounce of cheese is not enough if you like it. Made this with 60 second brussel sprouts and a nice steak.  Yummmmmmm!

This was wonderful.  Such easy prep-work for such a rich and delicious sidedish.  As a huge blue cheese fan, I'd have this any night of the week, not just with steak, and I think it would make a unique alternative stuffing option for holidays.

The only thing I did different was used multi-grain bread instead of Italian. It tastes great and is easy to make, but as another reviewer said, it is more like a stuffing than a bread pudding.

OK... Made a double batch of this as a side dish for Easter dinner. I made it in a large casserole dish instead of ramekins. It got rave reviews!  2 things I may try to modify in the dish for the future.  The bread puddings I've made in the past used some eggs to give it a bit more "body" so I may try to go in that direction a little bit. Second, leave it in the oven a little bit longer to get a bit crispier on the top and sides. Other than that, this is a great idea!?
