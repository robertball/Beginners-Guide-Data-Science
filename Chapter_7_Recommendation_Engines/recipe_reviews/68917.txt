My family loved this recipe, I'll definately make it again. I didn't have any stone ground mustard, so I used regular, and I skipped the hot sauce because our kids are small. It was great! Thanks for the recipe!!

I liked this- it was so easy and had a really good flavor.  I've never had Basa before- it's a very mild fish.  I made the sauce a few hours before dinner (using light mayo).  I brushed the olive oil on the fillets and coated them with regular dry bread crumbs- I didn't bother spraying any more olive oil on.  These baked up with a nice coating that was pretty crispy even without the extra olive oil.  The lemon and garlic on top is a nice addition.  Served with Parmesan Noodles from this site and a green salad.

This recipe is super easy and quick to make!!  I used panko (japanese breadcrumbs) instead of the melba toast and I amped up the sauce a bit with extra hot sauce, some lemon juice and a dash of cayenne.  My husband and I really loved it and will use this recipe on other white fish like tilapia and sole.

Great technique but use cod or another white fish - basa can originate where fish farming practices are questionable (eg China).

This recipe was very yummy.  We had never had basa before but it is a tasty fish.  Just a few revisions to the original recipe: I used 1/8 c. light mayo and 1/8 c. light sour cream (instead of 1/4 c. mayo), used chipolte mustard and omitted the hot sauce and also used breadcrumbs instead of the toasts.  Turned out fantastic!

My husband and I took one bite of this and agreed that it tastes like we ordered it at a restaurant.  We didn't have Melba toast so we just used crushed bread crumbs (shake and bake).  I also couldn't find any capers at my grocery store.  The sauce tasted great without them.  We will definitely be having this again.

Sensational! I made this a few nights ago and the fiance loved it! The sauce is very similar to "fry sauce" that Americans love. To lighten it up however, I used half mayo half plain yogurt (next time I'll stick to the recipe because it became a little runny). I didn't have any Melba toast or crackers on hand so instead I used finely crushed corn flakes. It tasted great compared to the usual bread-and-fry. This is the standard now for making Basa at my place!

First of all, perhaps it’s just a personal aversion, but I did not, would not, could not use basa, “Vietnamese catfish.”  Halibut was a much more appealing option to me, tho’ any mild flavored white fish such as haddock, cod or orange roughy could also easily be substituted. (Would not, could not, use tilapia either) That said…this was so good it was memorable.  The sauce, in my mind, was exceptionally delicious, the ideal complement for the crispy, delicately flavored fish.  I did incorporate my own tweaks – extra capers in the sauce, and Panko crumbs rather than Melba toast – not that I necessarily have anything against Melba toast.  More important than the type of crumbs used, I moistened them with olive oil, then added the minced garlic and fresh, chopped parsley. I just placed this atop the halibut rather than rolling the filet entirely in the crumbs.  I think all of this ensured they were extra super crispy and I don’t think using essentially half as much crumbs was any sacrifice at all.  I served this with simple pasta with Parmesan and garlic and oven roasted asparagus.  This meal, this fish, was absolutely, positively exquisite.

Very tasty, with a few alterations.  I substituted half sour cream/yogurt for the mayo and eliminated the paprika in favour of Italian seasonings.

Excellent fish.  Scaring the hell out of U.S fish farmers who are spreading lies about the safety of this fish.  
Also known as Pangasia, check out the following website.  http://fis.com/fis/worldnews/worldnews.asp?monthyear=&day=26&id=37400&l=e&special=0&ndb=0

So Tasty!
We used regular ground mustard, and skipped out on the hotstuff (for the kids). It was great!! Easy, served with spiced rice...healthy and tasty.

I cut the Basa into "sticks" and coated then baked them for my daycare children.  A much healthier option to store bought fish sticks and they loved them.  They are so cheap here, they are even a better deal then fish sticks!  It is on our weekly menu now.  I use ketchup instead of the mayo since they are just preschoolers.

Excellent sauce. I followed some other reviewers' advice and spread the sauce on the fish fillets (omitting the oil) before coating the fish with panko bread crumbs. I have to say it did take more like 20 minutes to bake the fish to flakiness but it was very delicious! Thanks!

what i did was i dipped the fish in the sauce instead of olive oil then in the batter. so the fish was cooked with the sauce right on it.  i can't compare it to the other way but it was really good and great flavour.  i also added a lot more hot sauce to the mixture, just personal taste

I thought this was wonderful.  I used Panko crumbs like others suggested.  I also put some lemon juice in the sauce.  I will definitely be making this again.  I served it with some fresh asparagus and a cabbage salad with ginger dressing.  YUMMY!!!

He LOVED it - even made the "could get in any restaurant" remark another reviewer made.  Used Panko - cuz that's what I had - and mashed it up with the back of a spoon.  Subbed Frank's Hot Sauce & the last of a bottle of Sriracha for the Pepper Sauce - again, just because that's what I had and needed to get rid of.  And I didn't measure anything, just did it to taste. I was skeptical of the side sauce and it really went well with it, but I'd advise making it first and letting it sit in the fridge till ready to serve.  And I also took the Wine suggestion and opened a bottle of Chard.  This recipe turned what was supposed to be an easy, quick, weeknight meal into date night!

I had never bought this fish before so I was glad to find such a good recipe. My husband was leary as men can be.I followed the recipe exactly except used Panko crumbs. The result was a winner, great flavour and the capers we a great idea. Will make this again!

While this recipe is great, I'd like to recommend using sustainable alternatives to basa: catfish, cod, halibut, flounder, tilapia, scrod, or whiting will all work well in this recipe.

The fish was very tasty cooked this way, and the sauce was very good as well.  I did not have capers for the sauce, so I omited that and I used panko bread crumbs on the fish!  I served the fish with fresh steamed broccoli.  YUMMY all the way around!

This was quite yummy.  I did't have any melba toast but had some kind of spanish type toast and it worked just the same.  I will definitely make again.  Husband and kids liked it too!

First time I've made swai/basa. Not great, probably won't make again. I increased the garlic and used  smoked salt but there still was little flavor to the fish. The awesome sauce saved it from being completely flavorless.

This recipe was great! My boyfriend and I really loved it. Instead of using the Melba toast, I substituted it with Japanese Panko and placed parsley and sliced lemon on top. Mmm

This is a wonderful dish.

I just made it for dinner.  The key is really in the sauce, which sounds spicy but is not.  Double it if you can, as it is thick and a little hard to spread over the fish.

Also, do not put ay garlic between the fish and lemon slices, it turns blue somehow, hehe.
Finally, if using bread crumbs, I recommend you toast them 5 minutes in a frying pan beforehand, otherwise the fish looks uncooked, even if it is perfectly done.  

This really is a wonderful recipe, sevre it with something like green beans and potatoes, you will not regret trying it.

The sauce tasted real good but was a little on the thick side. I think thinning it out with some lemon juice would work great. The fish didn't get as crispy as I would have liked but it tasted great. Served over a bed of rice with some orange zest tastes good as well. Overall a good meal.

Hubby really enjoyed this.  Me not so much.  A little too soggy for my liking.  The sauce was really good.  Will save recipe for that for future use on something else.  Had to bake much longer than the 15 minutes (almost 30 mins total) for fish to be flakey.

This was my first recipe using Basa - good fish, very light, a little meatier than a tilapia.  The sauce here, I found, was a bit heavy given the light fish - I prefer a lighter flavor on my fish to keep things healthy.  Hubby gave this a 4 star rating tho.  Loved the Basa fish itself and would definitely try again, maybe with some additional spices in the breading and skip the heavy sauce.

Basa is great for people like me who don't really like fish but eat it because it's healthy. I'd never had it before, and would compare it to tilapia. I was expecting it to taste muddy like catfish, but it really didn't. The only changes I made were to use crushed saltines instead of Melbe toast, and I added garlic powder to the crumb mixture instead of using fresh. I'm still not a fish fan but this turned out great. Thanks!

Not bad.  Normally don't eat basa, but this method was pretty good.  Used panko breadcrumbs instead and it came out nice and crisp.  Didn't use capers in the mayo/ketchup sauce, but that didn't effect the taste.

The only change I made to this excellent recipe was that I used a bit more tabasco sauce than called for as my tastes lean to spicy food.  I also used spiced pepper.

The fish was a little soggy on top. I would recommend leaving the lemon off and flipping halfway through. The sauce was amazing. Will definitely make again. Like others, I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of the Melba toast.

It was okay. The main photo (and title) makes this recipe seem like the breading would be crispy. It still comes out thin and not very thick or crispy, though you can tell this just by reading the recipe, it will not look like that photo. 

The sauce looks just right.

All that being said, as rated, this recipe was “okay”. However my 13 year old raved about the fish and sauce. He loved them both.

Fresh garlic & the sauce were a little spicy for the 5yo & I used packaged breadcrumbs & Basa fish. Delicious & easy. It’s on rotation to make again with oven baked chips

I had some haddock to use up and found this recipe. Like so many others, I used plain panko instead of melba toast.  I seasoned (salt and pepper) both the panko and the fish. Instead of misting the breaded fish I tossed the panko in a bit of oil (to help with more even browning) then baked the fish on a wire rack above the pan. I was quite confused with the instruction to top the fish with lemon slices before baking. Wouldn't a wet fruit on the breading keep it from getting crisp? I simply served with lemon wedges at the end.  That sauce though, oh my. The fish itself is a fine, no frills, 4 star recipe but that sauce puts it over the top. It's like tarter magnified! I didn't change a thing, except adding extra capers. All-in-all I was really happy.

Delicious, fast and simple recipe. Substituted Breton whole wheat crackers for melba toast (all out) & slightly increased the  olive oil. Another family favourite.

This will be on of those reviews where the recipe was not followed to the 't'.  That being said, I did follow the spirit of the recipe in using a light breading of potato chips (love using the crumbs at the end of the bag!).  Also used hot mustard in place of stone-ground and hot sauce.  Turned out very tasty.  Experiment a bit with this one or try as directed. It's a flexible recipe as basa (like tilapia) is a fish that needs to be doctored up.

Excellent fish recipe.  I used "responsibly farmed" Basa.  I didn't use capers (I didn't have any) and I used panko. I coated the fish with the sauce and dipped it in Panko. After reading the reviews that said their fish turned out soggy, I decided to brown the fish in a little olive oil before baking for 20 mins.  Came out nice and crispy.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Great Recipe and the sauce is AWESOME.  Baked it and served with steamed mixed veggies.  If you're cooking for 2, I suggest doubling the recipe for the sauce, if you don't you might run out...  seriously.

Made this recipe with just a couple of modifications (due to not having the exact ingredients on hand) and LOVED It! The only changes I made were: seasoned the fish with salt, pepper and garlic powder before rolling it in the crumbs, and I used crushed up flavored croutons because I didn't have any melba toast. Also omitted the hot spice in the dip because I have a 5 year old...but even he loved it! It was delicious and I like the fact that this is baked and not fried! Thanks for sharing. It will be a regular in the rotation when I make fish.

Made the sauce for fish tacos.  It was excellent.  For lack of ingredients used Tabasco Sauce instead of hot sauce and had to omit the mustard.  Also increased the paprika and capers.  Will definitely make this again.

Made it just like it was written.  Loved the taste, and sauce as a side was great.  Basa by itself is a very bland fish, but it takes on flavors wonderfully.  Next time, I will experiment a bit, maybe cut out the mustard and replace it with some Wasabi instead.  It will require some tweaking.   Overall, it was a hit.

I was so skeptical of making this dinner, as me and my boyfriend really dislike seafood. But I am so glad I made this, this recipe is perfect, the fish is light, airy, and best of all NOT STINKY! The sauce was a great compliment. I served this up with garlic angel hair pasta and a side salad. A winning dinner.

This was pretty easy. Like other reviewers, I used dijon mustard. The sauce was not at all spicy. The fish was ok, sauce was ok. Was nothing special for me so I will not make again.

My family just loved this!  I made a few changes based on what was in my fridge.  Instead of melba toast I used cheddar french fried onions and substitued the mayo for sour cream. And I didn't have any capers so I left them. It turned out wonderful!

This was great; flavor and texture.  My dinner guests all thought it was delicious!  The sauce was a hit as well.

I use Kikkoman bread crumbs instead. This is great whether you use regular catfish fillets or Basa.

I really liked this recipe. The sauce is great and goes well with the basa. I used whole wheat crumbs and they worked fine. The fish didn't crisp up when baked but it was delicious all the same.

My family loved this (even the one who hates fish went back for seconds)  I didn't spray with olive oil, and that may be why it was a little soggy, but the second time I made it I left the lemons off and used them as a garnish.  I also used sesame melba toast which made it delisious.  This is on it's way to being a family favorite.

Followed the recipe, but added crunchy salad topping for the last five munutes. Never used allspice with fish, but it was suprisingly delicious!

Not bad, not great. Right in the middle. Probably won't make again, but more because of the basa itself and not the way it was cooked.

Best way I've had basa so far.  Nice crust, and the sauce was the perfect compliment.

I couldn't hardly eat this and neither could my husband.   I would prepare something extra on the side just in case this recipe isn't to you liking.
