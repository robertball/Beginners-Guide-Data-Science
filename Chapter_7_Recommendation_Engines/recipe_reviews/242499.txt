OMG...these were so simple and so delicious.  Added a few chopped up pickled jalapenos to the filling mix because we like things spicy.  A winning meatless lunch or dinner!  Thanks for a great recipe Holiday Baker!

These were very good. The recipe is great as it stands. I used medium salsa and added some hot sauce. I will definitely make these again, and the only ingredient change I would make is to use yellow onion instead of green onion. I was a little lazy, so I just mixed in the 1/2 c salsa with the other ingredients instead of putting on each one--worked fine. My tortillas were a little smaller than called for, so I was able to make 6 that were stuffed with filling. I served with additional sour cream and salsa.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it is a great to eat as written but also a great base to build upon. I easily added a sprinkle of taco seasoning and tomatillos. You can also add in more fresh vegetables such as avocado plus sour cream, and hot sauce!

I didn't have lettuce, and added mild jalapenos but thought it was very good.  Yes, I'd make it again.

As a base recipe, this was very good, but as I started mixing things together I was not thrilled with the rice to beans ratio. I ended up doubling every ingredient except the rice and it was great! The kids loved it and asked for seconds. The seasoning from the rice itself gives this a lot of flavor without being at all spicy, which works for wussy me and my kids! You could definitely kick up the heat of that's what you like. This is one of those recipes that is a great guideline but can be customized to whatever you like.

Absolutely delicious. 
Simple, quick, and cheap for a poor college student like me. 
It would be good with chicken in it, but even without any meat it's still a winner. 
Will make this again, I will just be more careful to not overstuff them haha

This was really tasty.  It was so good that my husband and I each had two, so the recipe might need to be doubled for a family.  I used Medium salsa, not Mild.  That was just right for me.  Others might consider their preferred heat level when making.  Five stars!

Made it according to recipe. Good taste, easy to do. I ate 3 and still have enough left over rice mix to make 8 - 10 more. Not very spicy, so you can add more heat as you like. This meatless meal is super inexpensive also.

Flavourful? Pretty bland, I thought. Needs some seasoning, avocado, and done on lower heat so as not to blacken the tortillas at all. You don't need a recipe for this. Skip it.

We loved the flavor and the ease of preparation.  I used Vidalia onion because I didn't have green onions on hand and  Hatch chilies just arrived at our grocery store so we added two freshly roasted chopped chilies.  We'll definitely be making this again soon.  Thanks for the recipe.

My first review and I had to say this is a great recipe, and easy to make.  If I made any changes is I used three toppings, sour cream, salsa (recommended) and guacamole.
