This is exactly how I grew up eating squash from a very young age. Not just spaghetti squash, this works for acorn squash, too. I do add a couple tablespoons of light brown sugar in with the butter mixture before I schmear it on the squash and I go a little lighter on the spices. This is serious comfort food for me.

The squash turned out bitter. I added brown sugar but, since I uwas guessing on the amount, it still was not very good. I tried to rescue it by adding 2 chopped apples and more brown sugar and butter and still wasn't happy after baking about 15 more minutes. I put it in a container overnight and put it in the fridge. I had a flash of inspiration to make it into a quick bread. I found the recipe Summer Squash Bread on AR and used that as my starting point. I made the bread per the directions, adding half a cup Greek yogurt, cut the oil to a quarter cup, anning a half cup applesauce, and a cup of chopped pecans. It made a large loaf and a smaller loaf and the texture was like coconut had been added from the spaghetti squash. Wow, it was a big hit at my house and it made me feel so much better because I was able to salvage the squash and apples and my time and come up with something delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was bitter.  Not sure if I would make this again, but might try it if I used more brown sugar.

First time using spaghetti squash. Everyone liked it which was a surprise to me. Mild flavor with just the right sweetness in this recipe. My squash wasn't done until at least 60 minutes but whose counting. Will make again.

The spices were overwhelming and made the dish bitter.

Too much of a clove/bitter taste. Maybe my ground cloves are old.
