I tried this using imitation crab and canned tiny shrimp.  It worked well.  I had many compliments about the dill and crab flavors together.  I did find that I had to put the 9x13 pan on a cookie sheet.  As the pan sat in the refrigerator overnight, the strata rose and some of the liquid oozed over the side.

I served it with seafood sauce, and put some parsley on the plate for cooresponding color.
