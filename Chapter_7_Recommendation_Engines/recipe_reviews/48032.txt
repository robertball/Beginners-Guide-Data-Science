Quick and easy resipe!  I also added diced avocado, halved cherry tomatoes in place of the red pepper, and fresh cilantro.  It's really great if you make it early so that the flavors blend.  Another great tip is to squeeze out the remaining juice from the pit of the mango -- it adds tons of flavor!

I had high hopes for this salsa, as I have never made or eaten a fruit salsa before!  I made it the night before for poached halibut and I was quite impressed!! Cut way back on the cilantro (personal preference) and did 1/2 Walla Walla onion and 1/2 red onion instead of the green onion because I love the crunch and flavour of raw onion!!  Otherwise, this ROCKS!!!  Will use again on crab cakes and other fish. Thanks for the recipe!!

This stuff is great - I make it all the time. I like to serve it with chips and alongside some fresh, homemade guacamole. This mango salsa is colorful, sweet, spicy, cool, surprising. I made this in June for a luau and people STILL remember it and ask me for the recipe.

Tasted very fresh. I like chunky salsa but would recommend to the people who thought it was "too chunky" to refine their knife skills a bit as they are the one in charge of the "chunkification".

I only used the ingredients the recipe called for since they are all my favorites!  It's now become a frequent request at work.  Definately make it the night before for the flavors to blend.

I loved this recipe, it is so colorful!  I added 2 ripe nectarines, diced. I used sweet red onion instead of the green onion and I added a dash of balsamic vinegar. The result was very good.

Good recipe.  I though it needed a little salt to bring out all the flavors. I let it set  up for about 4 hours before serving over some pan seared fish.  If you don't want it very spicy seed and remove the membranse from the jalapeno

Wow! What a delicious recipe.  I doubled the recipe ingredients since I had two ripe and very sweet mangos on hand and served it over my spicy grilled salmon with couscous and it was a huge hit with my dinner guests.  A tip I learned many years ago is to let the lemon/limes juices sit with the onions first for about 10 minutes, and then add other ingredients.  I didn’t want to use the jalapeno chile pepper, so I used two dashes of red pepper flakes instead and it just enhanced everything without the added heat.  I’ll be saving this recipe in my “recipe box” to use again!  I definitely recommend this recipe!

I made this for a picnic and everyone loved it!  I mixed red onions in with the green onions which gave it a little extra flavor.  This is an easy recipe to make that is healthy and colorful at the table!

Love this very easy salsa!  I added black beans for an extra touch and it's still delish!  It's now a staple at all my Spanish themed dinner parties and I've had several requests for the recipe. Excellent!

Really nice salsa/relish to complement our grilled fish. I ate the rest with my favorite blue corn tortilla chips. The only change I made was to add a tiny bit of sea salt, which helps balance and round out the flavors.

Too chunky and not good at all. Everything was too raw and didn't taste like anything but cilantro and mango. I was expecting the lemon and lime juices to break down the salsa into more of a salsa consistency. It did not. Will not serve this again.

This was wonderful.  I 4 xed this recipe as I can't imagine 1 mango for 8 people for really work.  Others at the party asked for the recipe.  I didn't add the red bell pepper, simply becuase I forgot to buy it.  I also only  used 2 jalapenos because I'm a sissy, but I know others would have liked it.  Like I said, this was great and I will make it again and again.  I consider this a great Diet food that everyone will like.  Thanks so much.

Delicious!  I subbed a red onion for the green onion because I had one on hand.  Make sure you make this ahead of time to allow all of the flavors to marry.  I served the Mango Salsa over a blackened chicken breast.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful flavors!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because it didn't taste as good the next day - I think the citrus juice "cooked" the mango and made it a little slimy.  But it was AWESOME that first day!

This was good, but finding the timing was a little tough--30 minutes wasn't enough, overnight was too much; it lost a lot of flavor and the mango lost its sweetness after a night in the fridge.  I'll try it again.

This is so wonderful.  After making it I used it with seafood, pulled pork and a multitude of different kinds of meat recipes and fajitas.  It also kept in the refrigerated for quite a while.  I live alone so sometimes it is hard for me to finish a recipe while it is still good, not so with the this salsa.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

this reciped was okay. not what i expected. i added too much red onions to it and it overpowered the taste. Don't go overboard! Also, added too much cilantro. i will try not to get carried away with the ingredients.  peaches and mangos were great though.  ginger wasn't too much at all.  i also scraped the seeds from jalepeno peppers because i am not much of a spicy-food person and it wasn't hot at all.

I've fixed this salsa for years except I use sweet red onion.  It also goes well with pork tenderloin, or any pork dish, in place of applesauce.  The longer it sits in the fridge, the better!

One of my go-to recipes that I bring with me to showers or potlucks or whip up when people are coming over.  It's to the point where people just expect me to bring it!  While it is a fruit salsa, it is not a sweet salsa.  It tastes so fresh with just the right amount of spice.  I really don't stray from this recipe at all unless I am short/long certain ingredients in the house and don't have time to go to the store so I improvise a little.  I recommend following this as closely as possible, you can't go wrong!  One little hint, mangos can be hard to find the perfect ripeness for salsa.  Too ripe and it gets too soupy, not ripe enough and it lacks flavor.  I have no words of wisdom as to how to find the perfect mango, I usually just get lucky.

Crack, there she goes over the fence! Delicious over some red snapper I pan seared. Had to catch it first though!

I liked the Salsa a lot, but I DID make some changes to it.  First, I didn't have any red bell pepper, so I added a chopped Roma tomato.  The colors were nice, and I think it added nice flavor too.  I also added 1 clove of garlic, finely minced.  The flavors were great and I didn't feel there was too much cilantro as others had stated.  My family liked it so much that I had to hide some in the fridge for myself for later!!

I'm making this recipe for the third time tonight - for a work party.  This is such a nice change-up from the same old same old red salsa with chips.  Teamed up with BBQ chicen it is the best!!  Be sure to buy plenty of mango - that pip is so huge!!

great recipe!  I love the spicy/sweet combo.  As the originator said, it is awesome over fish, we have used this over salmon and mahi-mahi and it is fantastic over both.  I followed the recipe exactly, no changes.

I made this last night and it is awesome!! We prefer more of a salsa flavor than sweet so I used the 1 mango the recipe calls for and doubled the rest of the ingredients. I added 1 tomato and an avocado (highly recommend, it gave it so much more flavor!)   Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper :)

I thought this was just okay.  I did add garlic, as suggested in other reviews and also added some salt.  I thought the recipe was bland, like it needed something.  I probably won't make this again.

Awesome! I served this as an appatizer with fresh shrimp and it went over well.  Very flavorful and refreshing.  I also used red onion in place of the green and threw in a little fresh ginger that I had lying around.  Great recipe!

the freshness of this dish impressed us.. i almost subbed canned pickled jalapenos but grabbed a baby jalapeno from our little pepper plant instead (seeds/vein and all).. i used half of a red bell pepper.. the equivalent of three grape tomatoes from our garden and 1/4 of a red onion for the green.. i'm sure we doubled if not tripled the cilantro and used the juice of one lime for the lime and lemon juices.. added a garlic clove and a few shakes of salt.. very good with tortilla chips.. ty for the recipe

This is more of a pico de gallo than a salsa as it is not pureed, so if you are expecting a more salsa-like consistency then use a food processor or blender.  It also is better when it sits overnight.  One thing I have found that if the mangos are too mild tasting/underripe, adding a second one helps and also if you want a lighter cilantro flavor, cut it back by half.

Amazing! I used cubanelle peppers instead of red bell pepper since they were what I had on hand. To tried to restore the sweetness of red peppers by adding a little pineapple as well. Did a great job balancing it out. Also, word of warning, use gloves when dicing jalapenos!

Bravo! I did serve this with blackened fish and in-law was very pleased. I didn't have green onion, added 2 tbps chopped red onion, used 1/2 jalapeno as it looked big to me (it was like 5 inches long). It looked dry after 30 minutes in fridge, so I added another tablespoon of lime juice and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice. Then it became a bit sour so I grabbed some fresh grapes and squeezed some juice on it :-p  I think it makes a wonderful accompaniment with fish or chicken.

I officially joined allrecipies.com just so I could officially rate this recipe.  This is by far my favorite recipe I've found on this site.  It is light, crispy, healthy, soooo flavorful and the crunch and bite is phenominal!  I put this on my caribbean jerk chicken but it is good to scoop and eat plain or with some chips.  Can't get enough.  Double the recipe every time I make it!!!  My only alteration to this recipe is adding salt to get the flavors mingling and i add tomatoes.  BEST RECIPE EVER!  Thank you for sharing it!

This was so delicious! I did add just a bit of hot pepper flakes (to my portion only) and it was so good. 

No matter what it went well with everything! Some items I served this with were rice, with chicken tacos, with sea bass. with just some tortilla.

Love this recipe so much!  I took it to a reunion this past weekend and everyone loved it.  I didn't use lemon, but instead a little more lime - I find that they have such a fresh summery flavor.  I will for sure make this again, and again, and again!

Awesome salsa! Made it today for the 4th of July. It's definitely chunky, so I puree'd 2 spoonfuls of the mixture and then mixed in with the rest. Added avocado and it was great. Don't add the avocado until you are ready to serve it.

I added 1/2 tsp. cumin, 2 tsp. honey, 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar, juice from 2 lemons, and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. I used chopped grape tomatoes instead of red pepper. *UPDATE* I made it again - This time I followed the recipe exactly, i just added 2tsp. of honey. It was delicious. I served it with breaded fish tacos. Delicious!

I make this a lot in the summer. My only change is to add a garlic clove and I use red onion for a bit more color. Be sure and let it sit for a few hours or even overnight. Delicious with halibut tacos or just with Hint of Lime Tostitos. Also a margarita!

Served with fried tortilla triangles, and Husband loved! We have also used on fish tacos which was excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

Darn good! Some of the reviewers thought it was missing something, and I wondered at first, but then I thought it was best to let the mango and other ingredients stand on their own. I served it over fish I baked with Jamaican jerk seasoning. My husband loved it!

This recipe is the best!  I'd never had mango salsa before, and I must say this is a favorite for me now.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe because it's perfect!  I do use mango from a jar to make it easier.  I served it with the Jamaican Jerked Chicken and caribbean sweet potato salad recipes from this site and it goes perfectly together.

Yummy! I served this with grilled tilapia. So good! I used fresh basil in place of the cilantro since I don't care for it and fresh lemon and lime juice. Great! Even better two days later! Thanks!

Very good basic recipe.  I ramped it up with the addition of a nectarine, used sweet Vidalia onion instead of green onions, and used canned jalapenos rather than fresh, added 1/2 tsp. salt, grated some fresh gingerroot.  It got raves from my guests and my non-fruit salsa-lovin hubby!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would. I absolutely love it and made it again today. The only change made was to use a couple tablespoons red onion instead of green onion (what I had on hand). The quantities are flexible - add more or less of what you like. Today, I put a few tablespoons on a piece of salmon, wrapped it in parchment paper, and baked it in the oven. When it was done, I added more of the raw salsa on top. I can't say enough good things about this recipe - it tastes great on salmon, other fish or chicken breast or with tortilla chips as a snack. It's quick and easy to make. It keeps extremely well in the fridge for a few days. It's addictive and healthy. Use fresh lime and lemon, if you can. Love - Love - Love - Love - Love this recipe.

Definitely wakes up the taste buds! Great over pork tenderloin and/or charbroiled chicken - yummilicious for sure! Also added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper; couldn't help myself  - better if you let the flavors mingle in the refrigerator overnight.

Excellent recipe. I cut the jalapeno in half and removed the seeds and it was perfect for those not wanting too much spice. Tasted better the next day as well. Made this for fish tacos, then used as a topping on pork chops the next day. Excellent!

We love this recipe and so does everyone that tries it....I usually have to buy the mango's the week before so that they have time to ripen. At the last minute I had to double the recipe so I had to add frozen mango's...still was not disappointed. I follow the recipe but grade the lemon and lime in addition to adding their juices. 

The flavor is unbelievable !!!

I just made this with all fresh organic ingredients and it is amazing. I did however swap the jalapeño for a habanero to get an extreme spicy and sweet flavor. Again!!! Amazing!!!

Made this salsa according to recipe, but traded 1/2tbsp sweet Thai chili sauce for the jalapeño. Has received rave reviews in chicken breast and cheese wraps, served over green salad with tuna and as an accompaniment to grilled chicken mixed in with rice and vegetables.  LOVE it!  A summer staple in my house

Very easy and very good. I used regular onions, and pickled jalapeños (all I had on hand) still very good. I also used about 1 TBSP of jalapeño juice. Perfect and easy.

I used it on chops for dinner! My husband loved it- couldn't stop raving! I omitted the cilantro; didn't have any. But added a little Italian Salad dressing for instant "zip." It's a keeper!

I made this recipe last night and followed the ingredients as listed but used champagne mangos. It was excellent!! I served it on top of grilled blackened tilapia. My husband said it was the best meal he's ever had (and we eat at some top restaurants all around the country!) The combination of the heat (blackened fish) and the sweet mangos, it was a burst of flavors and so delicious! I'll definitely be making this again!

This was awesome!  We served with Macadamia coconut crusted white sea bass.  My husband tried the salsa and wasn't thoroughly impressed until he put the two together and announced the mango salsa made the meal.  I will be making this again and again.  It was easy to make and we'll eat the leftovers with chips.

This salsa rocks! It's so wonderful and fresh. Great for dipping or on fajitas! To make things a bit easier I used my food processor for everything except the mango (i wanted the pieces in nice big chunks!). I also ended up only using lime juice since I didn't have any lemons around. Still turned out great :) Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was pretty good minus the red bell peppers plus cucumbers. :D Delicious way to use up ripe mangoes you have lying around.

I used half a (large) jalapeno pepper instead of a whole. This is a super-easy and delicious recipe. The most difficult part is wrangling the mango.  I'm also impressed by how healthy it is.

I've never had a fresh mango before & perhaps I'm not a fan of it but my husband and I did not care for this at all! the combination of lemon lime didn't help! I put this over grilled chicken.  Will not make again. :-(  I've never given this bad of a review to anything I've tried on this site & I followed directions exactly!

Tasty recipe, for sure! I use a whole red pepper, throw in some red onion, and use 1/4 cup cilantro. Love to serve this over lightly seasoned mahi mahi or ahi tuna.

I LOVE this salsa... I am not a fan of cilantro so I replaced it with parsley... A nice topper to my homemade turkey burgers.. The jalapeno adds a nice zing to the salsa..  Really nice!

Awesome recipe - I came in second at a local salsa cookoff. The colors in this recipe are amazing and beautiful. Added a little bit of lime juice and roma tomatoes. Also used red onions but a bit too much, and that's with only 1/2 an onion. May decrease it a bit for next time.

This recipe is excellent.  It went perfect with the grilled fish my husband did for Mother's Day.  It was a big hit and everyone loved it, EVEN THE KIDS!  This will always be served when we have grilled fish, looking forward to trying it with chicken,

This was a GREAT recipe.  I took one reader's advise and added the lemon/lime juices to the onions first.  I placed that in the refrigerator for approximately 15 minutes prior to adding it to the sweet/ripe mangos and jalepeno/red pepper.  I believe this cut down the twang from those juices (I freshly sqeezed the fruit for the juice) I also used my Pampered Chef food chopper for both the jalepeno and red pepper.  In doing so, it created a lot of juice, of which I disgarded (I did not want it to be too spicy).  I also only used only 1/2 of the jalepeno to make it friendly to all of the dinner guests.  This was a very tasty salsa which went perfectly with the baked talapia.  This was definitly a keeper. ***3/5/2009...made this again.  Still a great recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  However, when I was ready to eat it with my talapia, the salsa was a bit tart, so I added one pack of "Equal".  That was perfect!

I loved this! SO GOOD! I served over blackened tilapia and man, was it ever gooooood!
I used about a half a jalepeno pepper finely minced and I found it had a lot of heat, so next time I will crush the jalepeno and just add the juice to taste. Awesome! Will make again, again and AGAIN!

This recipe was really good served with pita bread or tortilla chips.  I added a few black beans to make it more hearty and omitted the lemon.  Very good I recommend this to everyone!

Delicious! I served this with shredded beef tacos and it added an interesting twist. I would love to try it with fish tacos. I doubled the recipe because I had company and I was worried that it still wouldn't be enough, but I found that a little goes a long way. I have a LOT left over. I'll definitely make it again, but in the original proportions.

I tweaked this a bit, and it turned out okay, I guess. Substituted the scallions for actual onion, and used canned jalapenos as I could not find fresh - and they are probably cheaper. Served with tortilla corn chips, with mixed reviews.

Delicious!  In my opinion, you can never have too much cilantro!  My mom gave me a very similar recipe that has fresh mint instead of cilantro, also delicious!  I have some cavemen coming over for dinner and plan to serve this with roast duck! LOL!

It really needs salt.  The salt brings out the flavors...it’s really kind of bland without it.

I didn't experience a WOW factor.  I thought it was bland (definitely needed salt).  It was a lot better the next day.  First day, ate it on homemade venison hot dogs and they looked so pretty.  I will finish it off on top of some tilapia.  Maybe since I love spice I would not call it a salsa more of a garnish of sorts?!

Took this to a Super Bowl party last night and everyone loved it.  I don't know how, but I forgot the last ingredient, the lemon juice.  I did add a pinch of salt and served with blue corn chips.  I personally didn't like the green onion in this, it was overwhelming.  The next time I will use some red onion, or some Vidalia sweet onion instead.

Followed recipe exactly except I had no green onions.  I finely diced red onion instead.  My intent was to serve as salsa with Tostitos.  I thought it was good but comments were made that you could only taste the mango (which was kinda true).  I will make again because I liked it and will double the red pepper.

It's decent, but not to my liking. This is my first time trying it so I guess it's an acquired taste, but to me it seemed like nothing really blended well together. I either got a big bite of mango or a big bite of onion, and I had to stuff my mouth with more chips to get rid of the taste. It's beautiful to look at, but not appetizing to me.

I would give this recipe 5 stars. I loved it, but my husband did not. He said it was only "OK".  I only added a tiny bit of hot pepper. It was just enough. Don't go over board. He said there was too much onion ( I only used a single slice!) Be sure to add the cilantro, it really does bring it all together.

While out to dinner a few nights earlier, I was torn between a fish dish with a salsa mango and having a rare treat of a filet.  I had the filet.  But the mango salsa stayed in my brain.  

Last night I found this recipe, made it and put it atop salmon that was over a bed of spinach and mash, and it was fabulous.  Will be using this recipe again.  And not only was it a hit with my wife and I, but my 8 year old son LOVED it too, and my picky 11 year old daughter thought it was pretty good too.  

Highly recommend, can't wait to try it with avocado, and I would suggest a bit more lime juice than the recipe above calls for.

It's great!!I made it and let it marinate for an hour before my husband broiled tilapia and then we put it over top. He's not one to love mango but he added more on his fish after he tasted it! I chopped everything very fine, that helps a ton.

I have made this three times and it is great. I used a quarter cup finely chopped red onion instead of the green onion. I am not a fan of cilantro so the last time I made this I substituted fresh mint and it was awesome. Thank you for sharing a fail proof great salsa recipe.

This recipe was visually appealing. Taste-wise, not so appealing. The mix of raw crunchy vegetables, combined with the soft mango, just didn't go together. The mango and cilantro were both overpowering, making me wonder why the other ingredients were necessary. I would have loved to taste the great assortment of flavors, but unfortunately, that wasn't the case. It was edible, but I would not make this again.

This is great! fresh & flavourful. I used my favorite mango: Ataulfo, and purple onion vs green.Instead of jalapeno, I just added habenero hot sauce to the lemon juice. only used 2 tsp of the lemon juice, otherwise it would have been too runny. Great with jerk chicken!

I love mangos but am not really a big salsa fan. This salsa, however was really good. I chopped the fruit and veggies quite small,and we served it over some home made crab cakes for a party and it was a big hit with everyone.

I added finely chopped red onion in place of the green onions and a dash of salt. The flavors really come together after it rests for at least an hour. After 4 hrs, it tasted even better.

Simple n delicious. Thinly sliced 2 shallots paper-thin to replace all the other onions, soaked them in ice water for 5mins, drained water n squeezed out excess so the smell isnt as pungent. 

Forgot to get red bell pepper so didnt use. Chopped cilantro n seedless birdseye red chili (for color) into the tiniest possible- then toss over 1/2" cubed mangoes n add to other ingredients, color contrast over the yellow mango looks like confetti n very pretty!

It was a bit of a strange recipe (my boyfriend would only try a couple bites), and it was definitely different from any mango salsa I had ever had before, but I loved it.  I just added a little salt to it and ate it with tortilla chips.

A great base recipe. I added tomatoes, corn, and banana peppers to add variety. I also added a little bit of white wine vinegar. Very good for summer!

Great salsa made it to serve with chips.  Next time I will try it with chicken, loved the taste but it was the combination of colours that appealed so much to me.    Just the recipe I was looking for, thank you for sharing.

I made this with a mango that was a bit soft, but it still worked.  This was really spicy though.  The next time I will use a fresher mango, only add 1/2 the jalepeno pepper and maybe add some fresh pineapple chunks to sweeten it up a bit.  I put a  bit over a piece of Mahi Mahi and it was great.  I used it as a salad dressing (similar to how I use regular salsa), but it lacked flavor, so over meat or with chips is great.

This was really good, I made it for a Margaritaville themed birthday party and it was well received. However, I would have doubled or tripled the recipe, because there was hardly enough to go around. For my first time cutting up a mango, I found it to be a bit time consuming (and slippery). I'd make this again, though.

mmmm, a delicious and fresh salsa!  I added some red onion, left out the jalapeno, and added some crushed red pepper.  Next time I will cut down on the lemon/lime (too strong), and try out some balsamic vinegar as someone previously suggested.

Yummy!!  Took advice and doubled the recipe to use up the produce I had, glad I did. Served on top of baked salmon and it was fantastic.  Can't wait to use with homemade tortilla chips or fish tacos. Will add avocado next time. MMMMMMMMM. . . . . . . . .

Yummy!!  I have made this recipe a few times and have also tried it on catfish and love it as just a dip with tortilla chips.   It's a nice refreshing change to the usual chips and salsa. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Awesome!  This is the first time I used mangoes but it turned out great.  Make sure you get really ripe mangoes.  I learned that they should be soft and give to the touch.  I used the salsa as a topping for bruschetta.  I sliced frech bread and brushed the slices with extra virgin olive oil then baked for about 10-15 minutes at 350.  The I topped the bread with the salsa.  I ommitted the jalepenos because I was concerned it would be too much heat.  The green onions took care of that.  I plan to cook with the left over salsa.  Will definately make again.

This is fabulous!  I tried it on fish as suggested but it was cold on hot fish so it was just OK.  However, as a dip with blue tortilla chips, there's none better!!!  Have already made twice and plan to make m ore tomorrow!

Made this tonight for my Aunt and Uncle from Los Angeles.  They absolutely loved it and immediately asked for the recipe.  Went extremely well with Shish Kebabs and jasmine rice.  Excellent recipe.... only thing I did extra was squeeze the juice out of the pit as recommended in another review.  Thanks!!

very good as the recipe describes.
The second and third times I made it I added more pepper to heat it up and once I added sliced avacado and knocked back on the cilantro a bit.  Good either way, especially with fish tacos

I found this recipe to be great except next time I will use only 1 Tablespoon of cilantro. A little goes a long way in my book. We served it on top of grilled tilapia.

This recipe is to awesome. I used Dole frozem mango (unthawed and diced) in place of fresh mango. This salsa can be used for anything. Our freinds were my guinea pigs and they loved it. I will use this recipe over and over.

I made this recipe with just a few variations.  I substituted 1/4 cup chopped red onion for the green onion and added 1/4 cup peeled-seeded-chopped cucumber and it was wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.

How do you say addictive? Mango Salsa!  This is absolutely to die for!  I bought a huge box of mangos from Sam's Club and everyone was getting tired of eating them just cut up for breakfast.  Before they went bad I thought I would make this salsa to serve with fish.  My husband is not a huge fan of fish and I thought this might make it more enticing.  I ended up grilling some fish and serving it with this salsa and he ate made fish tacos and LOVED the fish.  I truly think it was because of the salsa.  If you want it spicier, turn up the jalapeno and add more salt, if necessary.  I also added a little cumin as someone mentioned and I could eat this everyday.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I am not a huge mango fan, but I loved it in this recipe! Made a few changes- Added a can of black beans, some thawed frozen corn. Ommited the red pepper as I just didnt have any. Added half a can of rotel instead and a little cumin. YUM YUM.  Served with shrimp fajitas! Was a great mix of spicy and sweet! Will be the new "salsa" I bring to parties!

I love this recipe.  Every time I make it I get tons of compliments.  It's best to make the night before you plan to serve it so that the flavors can marinate and blend overnight.  I usually add a little more mango and a little more lemon and lime juice than what the recipe calls for but otherwise I follow it exactly.

I'm giving this 4 stars but I also changed it and I liked what I did. I added some red onion and some green.  I added some chopped cucumber.  Some chopped tomato, bananna pepper and some pineapple tidbits. I omitted the red pepper because I didn't have any.  I put this on tuna steaks.  If it hadn't been for overcooking the steaks (my fault) it would have been awesome.

This recipe was okay, but not great. It called for too much cilantro, and I think the green onions overpowered the mango flavor.

I made this and didn't change a thing.  It  was spectacular.  I made it to top some blackened grilled grouper, but we ate the leftover salsa with chips later on. So good. A new staple in the house. I plan to add a bit of pineapple next time around, should be good!

I did not include the jalapeño pepper just as a preference. This salsa is absolutely delicious! I served it as a side dish to crab cakes and it was a perfect complement.

Thanks for posting this recipe. I kept seeing recipes for Mango Avocado Salsa, so I added an Avocado to this as I had some on hand.  Reminder - you really need to let this sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before tasting. I kept thinking it was missing something and the remembered it needed time for the flavors to marry.  After sitting in the refrigerator overnight, it was AWESOME!!! Will definitely make again.

Suuuper good! We had it on breakfast burritos and as a dip later on. I added a Serrano instead of jalapeno, I added two tomatoes from the garden, I added a pinch of salt and pepper (The flavors come out so much better) I didn't measure it, just went by eye.... I did half a lemon and half a lime. I processed it because cutting herbs and the Serrano are such fiddly little jobs. SOOOO GOOD!

Really tasty with a nice zing.  I used frozen mango as its difficult to get fresh mango where we live and it’s more economical.   Also added a little pineapple

I served this salsa as a side to grilled swordfish and alongside Basmati rice and steamed broccoli florets.  I followed the recipe for the most part except I don't measure - generally go by sight and personal preference.   I left the mango in larger chunks but  minced the red bell pepper and a bit of red onion along with the green onion and jalapeno.  I added a small handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley and cilantro mixed from my herb garden.  It marinated in the juice of 1 medium lime and about 1/3 of a large lemon.  The presentation on the plate was quite appealing with the brightness of the salsa next to the swordfish  and the brightness of the steamed broccoli and the rice.  Will absolutely use this salsa many times in many different ways.
BTW:  some of add-ins suggested by previous reviewers sound quite yummy - black beans, tomatoes, peaches/nectarines, splash of balsamic - endless options!

I used only half of a green jalapeno pepper, the taste was mild and next time I would use a whole jalapeno.

I made it just once. I wasn't able to change the number after needing to edit entry.

The proportion of jalapeno to mango was way to high for my family, but even halving the amount of jalapeno just didn't give it the the fruit/kick combo my kids and and husband like.   On the their advice, I added a 1/2 Cup pineapple and a little ginger for more of a sweet spice kick.  It was excellent on fish, but it wasn't the original recipe.

I think mine didn't work out because the fruit was lacking, however I didn't care for the recipe itself, I have made better fruit salsas

I did change the recipe a bit, but they only reason I'm knocking off 1 star is because like another mentioned, it needs a bit of salt to help bring the flavors out. 
Because I was using this in fish tacos, I did make a couple of adjustments. Replaced green onion with red onions and added tomato, and added salt. 
Turned out great! I'm eating the leftover salsa with fresh baked tortilla chips now!

Thanks for sharing :) I forgot to buy the cilantro but we still loved it ..i used regular onions, fresh lemons but  I used concentrated lime justice and added tomatoes... I'll try it your way next time.

I've never tried a salsa like this before and I was pleased to have finally tried such a great mix of flavors! My wife and I found a spicy mango brats one night and cooked it up with some peppers. We realized that the hint of sweetness of the brat and the peppers was just not enough. So we found this recipe for the next time we do brats. Unfortunately we never found the spicy mango when we last went shopping, but we improvised with a spicy chorizo. The flavors were perfect together! Super simple, tasty and inexpensive to make! I should mention, we got some perfect mango and my butter fingers dropped one of the perfects cuts I had onto the floor. A little disappointed, but still, great mix of flavors!

Made this salsa to go with swordfish and used what was left to go with chicken the next day . Delicious... A very bright and flavorful way to liven up a meal. The only substitution was a red chili pepper instead of a jalapeno

One of our favorites. Very refreshing and colorful. Didn't change a thing. Perfect with fish or tortilla chips. We prefer finely chopped rather than chunky. Used a Pampered Chef food chopper to make quick work of it.

This is a good simple classic mango salsa just the way it is.   And easy to adjust to own taste.  I added a little salt and replaced lemon juice with orange juice.  But it really would have been OK to leave out the salt, since there is plenty of salt on the chips, and orange juice just happens to be  more liked by the many kids I tend to feed.   Left out the green onions because I didn't have them and they weren't really needed in this recipe, for color (cilantro does the job) or flavor (plenty of sweet and sour onion flavors already). If you don't want a chunky salsa, just put it in the food processor (will become like pico de gallo) or dice it smaller.  If you don't like it raw, roast some of your vegetables first.   If you like a softer onion flavor, switch with red onions.  Many reactions to this recipe made me scratch my head a bit.

Sorry to say this recipe was so disappointing. I love using fresh fruit and vegetables but this really was nothing but chopping and it's more like a bland chutney. For a mango salsa recipe it really should have called for more mango. I tried to alter it but gave up trying.

Amazing! Everyone loved it! I literally heard someone say that this salsa tasted like happiness :-) My daughter was so upset when she went back for more and saw it was all gone. One thing I suggest was that I made it the day before so it could set and then the next day I drained most of the juice off after giving it a really good stir. Definitely going to make this again!!!

This salsa is PHENOMENAL. My brother made it for Christmas this year and since then I've made it twice, once in a double batch for New Year's (it was a huge hit!!). I love this salsa so much, and it's even a healthy snack, so that's a bonus. I will be making this many, many more times in the future.

We put this on the Lori's famous crab cakes (on this site). Yum!  Leftovers are good with chips or just eating plain.  A very bright healthy and summery taste.  Good as a seafood sauce if you are not in the mood for creamy/heavy sauces.

I found it inedibly acidic when I made it as is. I had to add a tablespoon of sugar, and saute it in 1/4 cup of orange juice in order to be able to eat it.

This was really good. I made it exactly like this but I did throw in a few cherry tomatoes I had that needed to be used up. This will be my go to summer salsa I make. I added this on top kf steam baked chicken with rice on the side. It was delicious.

Great recipe.  Sweet heat,  I'm serving with grilled chops and white rice.  My jalapeno was really hot and I wish I had only put in half of it.  Next time I'll taste test the pepper, lol.  I may add some tomato to bring the heat down.

Made a double batch exactly as written.  Made it about 9 hours ahead of time and glad I did, as it was much better after allowing the flavors to blend. Mild, but would be delicious with more heat as well.  Delicious as is.

Great recipe, one that is used in our area of Southern California to top fish tacos. More jalapeño is used along with fresh minced garlic to taste.

This recipe is as good as it is versatile.  I use red peppers rather than green for color and taste.  But I always make larger batches simply because I love the stuff. Whenever mangoes go on sale.

This is an outstanding basic mango salsa that I will be making throughout this mango season.  The first batch was gone in 24 hours!  And that in a family that is not that crazy about the spicy dishes I create.

It was delicious! I omitted the red peppers because I'm not a fan of bell peppers but it was good without it. Put this with some guac on a burger and it's heaven!

I made this to eat with lightly blackened flounder.  One reviewer said this wasn't a sweet salsa and they were right.  It also wasn't a savory salsa...it was a "twangy" salsa.  I wish I tasted it before adding so much lime and lemon juice.  Even though really ripe lemons and limes are a little sweeter, they are still tart.  To remedy the tartness, I added some salt, which helped a little and then added some Splenda which I keep on hand just for times like this.  It doesn't take much and dissolves quickly in a dish that's already prepared. I ended up making it sweeter because, because at that point, I thought it tasted better (and less tart) the sweeter it got.  Next time I'll try using a lot less lime/lemon juice or maybe just go with orange or pineapple juice instead.  I also used red onion because I didn't have any green onions and I used only a few sprigs of fresh cilantro instead of the amount called for.  I've found it can be overpowering in large amounts and I don't like it as much as I once thought I did.  I would make it again because I still ended up liking it, but I'll try just using less lime and lemon juice first next time.

This is an excellent mango salsa, and it's fast and easy to make. I've made it several times and it never fails. It's become my go-to salsa for fish tacos.

I rated it 4 Stars because I hate cilantro. I used Broad leaf Italian parsley fresh from my garden. Also used chives instead of onions. No lemon juice because I thought that the mango was sour enough. I did use lime juice however. I also used fresh avocado. This is my first go at mango. We'll see how much I like it.

Quick and easy. I used it with a grilled pork roast rubbed with Cajun seasoning. Great contrast. Company loved it. I have also used it with a Grilled Cajun Mahi Mahi which was equally good. I have found that other fruit works well with the mango-try peaches.

I made this salsa to go with a thick cut of cod and it was a tasty accompaniment. I added an avocado and chopped red onion instead of the green onion.  Perfect blend of flavors!

Very easy recipe. It's excellent as written or easy to personalize according to your own taste. After first making it as written, I added a little pineapple and some minced garlic.  Well worth the effort and makes a pretty presentation.

I know it would be great with bell peppers, but I did not have any. I just used Roma tomatos instead (not really a 'substitue' for bell peppers at all!) and it was still delicious! I give it a 5-5. MAKE IT NOW!

I really like this salsa. I can't have tomato so this is perfect for me. It's great with chips or added to a main dish. I can't have citrus so I swap all of that for about a tablespoon of distilled white vinegar.

This is very tasty however it did not have the heat I expected.  I added a tablespoon of Cholula sauce (probably any hot sauce would work).  Also added about 1/2 tsp salt.

I used a half of habanero instead of a jalapeño and it was definitely spicy! Really liked it, but I used my food processor to cut the ingredients up which helped make the salsa creamier. It's wonderful with chips, pita bites, bagel crisps--- anything you want to scoop it up with!

Boyfriend followed recipe closely. It was wonderful. Wished we had doubled quantities; could use more jalapeno if desired; think he added a bit extra red pepper & cilantro. ¡Delicioso!

Delicious salsa! A friend has a mango tree and gave me some so I wanted to try this.  I prepared it exactly as written...my son and I like spicy food so I used 1 whole jalepeno with the seeds and oh boy it was spicy!  So if you don't care for that, definitely remove the seeds as the video suggests.  I served it over grouper and got many compliments....will definitely make again!  Thank you IYENGAR21 for the recipe :)

Two things missing when I made this last night.  The mango was pre-peeled and sliced so wasn't as ripe as it could have been. And even though I know I bought a jalapeno pepper last week at the store, I couldn't find it when I was preparing this salsa last night. I used crushed red pepper flakes instead.  I will make this again when I can find ripe mango. It just wasn't that good when the mango is hard and tasteless.

I added more mango since I had tons and it seemed to need it. I only eyeballed the lime and lemon but that's only because I'm lazy. And I added red onion instead of green. My family loved it!!!!!

My first recipe Ive website I think.  Instead of using red pepper, I used orange pepper.  I also felt the onion was excessive, so I didn't use all of it.  Just tried the results, and it was great.  Using this for Cinco de Mayo celebrations at work tomorrow, and on my fish tonight.  I even through the salsa in the blender, and mixed it into a Salsa Cheese Dip, with a Bread Bowl.

I made this for dinner but it was a bit bland (perhaps mangos weren't ripe enough). I added some balsamic vinagrette to it and it made it a lot better.

Awesome!!!! I added some pineapple tidbits (about the same amount of mango pieces) and about 1.5 tablespoon of the juice from the can, but kept everything else the same. I think the sugar from the pineapple juice helped combat the spicy from the jalapeño (got a super hot one) and helped mellow the cilantro.

I made this recipe as an appetizer served with tortilla chips. I doubled the recipe, used red onion instead of green and finely chopped everything except the mango which were bit-size pieces. The mixture was refrigerated for 6 hours before serving. I impressed the adults at the party but the younger children didn't go for it. You definitely have to like cilantro to enjoy this recipe. I also have to say that the mangoes I used were of exceptional quality. My local grocery store was featuring them and I was able to sample a piece before buying. I will make this recipe again.

Complimented citrus marinated chicken well. Served it on a fresh bed of mixed greens. I'd probably use this on fish (tilapia, salmon, ect.) from now on though, I think the flavors would mend better.

AWESOME!!! So deliciously refreshing...served it over baked cod after spooning some into my mouth it was so tasty ;) I didn't have a jalapeno pepper at the time so instead I added some chopped poblano pepper and sprinkled a small amount of crushed red pepper for some heat. I also added a chopped avocado. Great, thanks for sharing!!!

Fantastic!  We have this with grilled or pan-fried fish, and it turns a plain meal into a favourite!

I omit the jalapeno, and replace the cilantro with basil, just to suit personal preferences.

Wow. Part of an all-star line up for my son's baptism lunch. This salsa was great. The heat was just right (not overpowering) and the sweet mango set it off perfectly. Make it as is and you won't regret it.

Delicious! I did have to make some slight adjustments due to what I had on hand and my taste preferences. I didn't have any red peppers on hand, so I omitted those and I replaced the cilantro (yuck) with parsley. I served this w/ grilled pork chops and the flavors went very well together. I can't wait to make this again and serve it w/ tortilla chips-YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Don't forget to add about 1/2 tsp salt to this recipe to make it Much more flavorful. I also added 1/4 tsp of fresh grated ginger (I used the microplane, but finely chopped or grated would certainly do). Served warm on top of phyllo wrapped brie, it was gone in about 4 mins flat!!

Great looking, great tasting. I, too, thought it needed "something" so I added salt, plus a tablespoon of vodka, which helped. (Got the vodka idea from a chef in Bermuda, but he never told me exactly how much to add.)

Loved the texture of the celery and the refreshing flavor.  This would go great on chicken.  Easy, easy, lemon peasy!

Delicious and so pretty to look at.  The only changes I made were to use 1/2 a jalepeno pepper and red onion instead of green.  This was fabulous with fish tacos and cilantro lime rice.

Very easy to make and able to adapt for what I have at home.  I used a white onion instead of green (not at home) and I didn't have any red pepper so that didn't go in either.  I added a clove of minced garlic as well since everything is better with garlic.  It went great with pan seared mahi mahi and rice.

This was a great recipe! Made this for my wife for a special occassion. It turned out better than I ever expected. Very easy to put together. My wife is allergic to green onions so I substituted red onion. Can't wait to make it again.

Awesome!!  Super easy, very healthy, and delicious!  I doubled it and added a can of crushed pineapple.  Served with homemade tortilla chips (7" flour tortillas brushed with lime juice, sprinkled with coarse salt, cut into wedges and baked at 400 for 10 minutes).  Can't wait to make it again!!

like some others i used red onion rather than green.  It just made more sense to me that way, and turned out wonderful.  After some fridge time it will be served over grilled chicken tonight.

This is an excellent recipe. I agree with the other posters in doubling the marinade. I also make a mango salsa to accompany the salmon. Fantastic! This is a keeper for sure!  Thanks ("

Wow!!  What a great recipe.  I added a pinch of kosher salt and subbed walla walla sweet onions for the green onions.  I also seeded the jalapeno so it wouldn't be too spicy.  DELICIOUS!  I served it with fish along with the white sauce from the "Lime Fish Tacos" on this website.  Wonderful combination.  At the end of dinner, we were putting the salsa, white sauce and fish on tortilla chips.  Excellent appetizer idea.  My husband who was a little apprehensive about a fruit salsa in fish tacos had TWO tacos!!  This is our new favorite way to eat fish.

This was yummy. I tried to see if I could alter this slightly to make it more like a mango salsa recipe given to me by a Brazilian woman. (I lost the recipe!) I substituted red onions for green and added a dash of white vinegar and some avocado (just because I had one on hand). I also added some garlic powder and salt. Everyone liked it, but to me there was just a tiny something missing, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

You have made me a hero with my in-laws! My family loves this so much that I made it for my In-Laws when we went back for a visit.  I always add triple the jalepeno peppers, my Mother-in-Law hates spicey food but loves mango so she couldn't eat it ;) but the rest of the family loved it.  Thank you!

I changed a few items in the recipe but it came out wonderfully.  I used red onion instead of bell pepper and green onion I added a little bit of salt and ginger, garlic and 2 kiwis.  The flavors were great and just enough different from the normal "salsa" recipe.

This was the BEST salsa we've ever had! Excellent topper for seared Ahi Tuna. A little too spicy for my crowd when I followed the recipe, but I just added some additional mangos to tone it down a litte. EXCELLENT SALSA!!!
