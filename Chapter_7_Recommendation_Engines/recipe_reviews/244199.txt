Loved the concept but as written I found this too salty. No, I didn't use onion salt or garlic salt but I made as written. I made 2 batches today. One as written and one with my own tweaks. As written 4 stars and with my tweaks 5. My own batch I did 1 pound of ground beef to 1/2 pound of ground pork, 2 tsp salt, 2 tsp paprika, and 1 tsp of smoked paprika and the rest the same. LOVED this as a way to use up those extra hotdog buns you get in the package. Thanks Chef John and I will  make this again!

I made these tonight and they are good but way too salty. Next time I will cut the salt by half and the pepper by half. Update to come
