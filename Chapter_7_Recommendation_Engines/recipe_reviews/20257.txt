Very tasty, althought not very creamy, next time I would substitute the milk with cream. I also added chopped maraschino cherries and walnuts. Gave 2 pints away to my neighbor & she loved it as well. Would definatley make this again!

A keeper at my house for sure. I did modify the recipe a bit, used a quart of half & half instead of milk. In the end I did not have enough room in my 4 qt. ice cream maker to add any chocolate milk. Maybe next time I will try a pint of each? Wonderful recipe!!!

Tastes just like Banana Split.  Couldn't believe it.  It was a little more involved making than I planned but well worth it.

GREAT RECIPE!  MY FAMILLY AND FRIENDS LOVED IT!
I HAVE MADE IT SEVERAL TIMES.  I DIDN'T USE ALL OF THE MILK LISTED IN THE RECIPE - TOO MUCH "STUFF"! - BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER - IT WILL TURN OUT GREAT HOWEVER YOU DO IT!  THE LAST TIME I MADE IT THE NIGHT BEFORE AND PUT IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND THEN FROZE IT IN THE ICE CREAM FREEZER THE NEXT AFTERNOON.  WORKED EVEN BETTER!

Yum!  I have a small ice cream maker so I cut the recipe in half and still had to make it in two batches.  It did NOT go to waste, however! I agree with trying cream or even half & half instead of the milk next time.

I took it to a church ice cream social and everyone wanted the recipe.  They said it was the best and waited by the freezer to see who had brought it.  

I did substitute half and half for the 1 qt. of milk. I also used frozen sliced strawberries from which I drained the syrup since the fresh strawberries have not been good this year.

This recipe sounded yummy but for me was too icy and the banana flavor overpowered everything else.

This is delicious! It is very sweet.  You can probably cut back on the amount of sugar.  This recipe makes a whole gallon of ice cream.  Keep that in mind.  My i /c maker is only a half gallon size, so it was a double batch. The serving size is 1/2 cup and nutrition values are accurate.
I simmered the custard, stirring constantly, to assure that the eggs were cooked. My grandchildren love it too!

Haven't made this yet, but instead of adding the quart of chocolate milk I think I will go with adding chocolate syrup when it's done & dished out, just to be sure my freezer will be large enough.  Banana Split ice cream is a favorite, but have always made it in the past with no recipe.

Great taste.  It made too much for my 4 quart machine.
