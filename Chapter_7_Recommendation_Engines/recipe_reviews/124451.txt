Par-boil the potatoes first to help it along...For the topping combine some Panko bread crumbs, parmesean cheese and paprika with a little melted butter and put on top -- makes a nice litle additon..We also use more onion, at least 1/3 to 1/2 cup -- we like a real onion flavor.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was really good; but as always, I did change some things.  First, I added a lot more onion than the recipe called for (probably 1 medium) and I added a large clove of minced garlic as well.  I made the white sauce and added grated cheddar (1/2 cup), grated swiss (about 2/3 cup) and a good sprinkle of fresh nutmeg.  Lastly, instead of using just cheese for the topping, I mixed more grated cheddar/swiss with some buttered Ritz crackers.  We really enjoyed this dish and it heated up really well the next day for lunch.

I was looking for a recipe similar to the one I grew up with and this was it!  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I sliced the potatoes thin, but did have to leave it in the oven for over an hour.  Next time I will put foil on it for the first part of baking and then uncover it to get the crispy top layer.

Homey and hearty. Four and a half stars would be more accurate. I felt more onion should be used, about 1/4 cup (4 Tb) to enhance the cheese flavor. It should be sauteed until lightly browned in the butter, as raw, crunchy onion lends, to our taste, an unwelcome distraction in flavor as well as texture.  Parboiling the potatoes (about 6 minutes for 1.5" cubes) before folding them into the sauce will ensure that everything is adequately cooked within the stated time. In order to amp up the flavor, I used half chicken stock in place of 3/4 cup milk. The sauce tightened up considerably while waiting for the oven to preheat, so another 3 Tb of milk was needed, stirring to incorporate evenly. Thinning it this way allowed for the perfect texture in the finished casserole. All in all, a very good, solid recipe that with a few minor tweaks can become a memorable meal. It's comfort food that will bring 'em running to the table.

Easy and Yummy!  We all loved it(including a picky 3 year old)!  We doubled the recipe and it needed to cook about 1 1/2 hours for the potatoes to cook.

This is a great recipe! I cooked the onion in the butter before finishing the roux sauce. I also added 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp. mustard powder, and a large clove of garlic minced to the onion while cooking. The flavor reminds me of scalloped potatoes; "hunny" doesn't like  thinly sliced but really likes the cubes instead.

Very tasty.  My only problem was that some of the potatoes weren't thoroughly cooked after 40 minutes in the oven.  The next time I make this I will microwave the potatoe cubes first to speed up the cooking process.  Good flavor, made a nice dinner with a green salad to accompany the casserole.  Good way to use up left over ham.

YUM. YUM. YUM-this recipe was awesome, the only thing is I doubled it and used a 2 quart casserole dish and it was too small, my dinner spilled over in my oven-the taste makes the clean up well worth it though!

This is very similar to a recipe I have made for years.  Only difference is the amount of butter used in the roux.  This time I did make this with more butter so I could accurately rate it.  But I do not notice a big difference, so if you are looking to cut calories...using 1/2 the butter would be a start.  Also, 40 minutes is not long enough cooking time...75 minutes was about perfect.  I did cover with tin foil for 1/2 of the cooking time and it turned out great...not dried out but brown and bubbly on the top!  My girls gobbled this up!  If you want to cut the cooking time slice the potatoes add a few sliced onions in casserole, cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 5-7 minutes...add ham and sauce and then bake 40 minutes. One of our favorites!

Mmmmmm...so good. I used colby jack instead of cheddar cheese because thats what I had on hand, and I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream into the sauce when it was done cooking. I accidentally left out the onion, but this was very good and I will be making it again.

Very good and flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only change I would make in the future would be a reduction in the salt - it was too salty with the ham I used.

I sliced the potatoes into 1/4" slices using my mandoline slicer, and they came out a little crunchy even though the cheese was nicely browned.  I think I'll try a shallower dish, parboiling the potatoes, cooking for longer at a lower tempurature, or thinner slices of potato next time.  Flavor was excellent (used half pepper jack and half cheddar - it added a nice kick!)

Loved this recipe! I sliced the potatoes instead of cubing them. I used the ham that comes in the cans (found next to the SPAM since that's how my boyfriends mom made hers). I fried up the ham cubes to crisp them up a bit. I sauteed the onion in the butter (used an entire onion) and then added the flour to make a roux and then the milk. I added more than a cup of the cheese. I shredded half of a block of cheddar and half of a block of pepper jack....and those would be the 8oz blocks you get next to the already shredded cheese.  Added pepper, paprika and some cayenne for kick. Thanks for the great recipe! Brought back some good memories for my boyfriend of his childhood! We'll be making this again soon.

Pretty good.  A little soupy the first day.  I liked the look and taste better the second day.  Definitely had to bake it longer.  I baked it for about 45 minutes covered and about 30 more uncovered.

Wow what more do you need in a ham and potatoe casserole!  Only changes I made was to use turkey ham, skim milk, less butter, and velveeta cheese slices (melts wonderfully)---all in an attempt to lower the fat content.  Has an old-fasioned fantastic taste.  Reheats in microwave beautifully the next day.  Novella, you're Grandma had a good one here.  Will make again and again over the years. Thanks.

This tasted great!  I thought the ratio of potatoes to sauce was off, so I doubled the amount of sliced potatoes and it was perfect.  I also diced 1/4 of a large onion and sautéed with butter before adding the flour.  Reminds me of my Mom's scalloped potatoes.  Yum!

Very good recipe. Like most I made some changes. First I doubled the recipe. I par boiled the potatoes based on the comments of some other reviewers and I left the skins on the potatoes (highly recommend this). I also increased the white pepper from a couple of pinches to a couple teaspoons. When it was all assembled and about to go in the oven, I covered the casserole with 8 oz. of Panko bread crumbs.  Also, the ham I used was leftover from one I had made at Thanksgiving - bone-in butt that had slow cooked for eight hours so that really added a lot of flavor.  The outcome was five-star but I'm giving it four stars based on the original recipe.

This recipe was VERY good!!!!  The only reason I did not give the original recipe 5 stars is because I like many of the other reviews modified the recipe a tad bit.  First, I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 glass casserole dish and baked for 50 mintues.  I added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a pinch of paprika to the cheese mixture.  I reduced the salt by HALF and could have done more as they were a tad bit on the salty side.  I finished it off with a topping of potato chips mixed with cheddar cheese and parmesan cheese that I added during the last 10 minutes of baking... then broiled for the last 5 minutes to make it golden brown.  It was an awesome dish and my husband loved it!!

This was so good, I did slice my potatoes so they cooked all the way through.  I also baked for longer than the cooking time stated.  I used green onions instead of white because it's what I had on hand.  Really delicious and I think I'll use this as my Potatoes Au Gratin recipe  even without the ham!

Made this tonight and it was great... added a Saltine cracker crust ... I would boil the Potatoes for about 10 mins before mixing them in the casserole to help them along... My husband went back for seconds and that is always a good sign..~smile~

My kind of recipe. Relatively simple but delicious. This is my third review and my first with five stars. It is what I consider a terrific foundation recipe, one that can be altered and built upon according to taste. Drawing upon past reviews, I doubled the recipe and increased the chopped onions, perhaps 1/3 cup. I sauteed the onions and two minced cloves of garlic. I, too, parboiled the potatoes to ensure they would be cooked Using food on hand, my topping was 2 cups of crushed corn flakes with 5 crushed saltine crackers. This I mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted margarine and 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese. Excellent. The crispy topping provides a nice taste and texture contrast to the body of the casserole. And a variety of such toppings are usually on hand. Like others who doubled the recipe, I cooked the casserole for about an hour at 350. Thank you Novella Cook.

YUMMY. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Agreed that parcooking the potatoes helps.

Fabulous.  Everyone loved it.  I used a mennonite farmer sausage instead of ham and my family couldn't get enough.  This is a great dish to bring to a potluck!!

I am not a huge fan of ham, so I kinda of picked the delicious potatoes out and left most of the ham on my plate.  The rest of my ham loving family gobbled this up.  I do agree with other reviewers that this is better the second day, or even made earlier in the day and left to sit.  The sauce thickens up and the flavors really come together during that time.

I made this according to the recipe given, however it took much longer to bake before the potatoes were done.  Tastes very good, I will make this again.  Probably baked it for one hour, COVERED.

What a simple and yummy recipe!
A couple of things to note:  I used a heavily glazed honey baked ham and didn't care for the sweetness it added.  (Just something to think about.)  Also, I was doubling the recipe, but didn't have enough milk, so just used a can of cheddar cheese soup and that worked well.  
Thanks for the recipe!

A great base recipe.  My husband asked that I save this and he doesn't do this too often.  (meat and potato guy).  I didn't have fresh onion so I used some onion powder and garlic powder which was great - I think it needs that added flavor!  I used a mexican blend cheese and added some more after baking so my children could see it.  I also parboiled potatoes in salted water so the process would move along faster in the oven.  Highly recommended!  Even with this step, it took me 30 mins or so in the oven.  I used leftover ham from Easter and it tasted delicious - even better the next day.

This dish was good but not something I'll add to the regular rotation. It took a much longer time to cook so if I try it again I'll turn up the oven temp a bit. Onions or onion powder will also add a lot.

Good eats! The whole family liked this one. I added some chopped celery which was good. The recipe didn't say whether or not to cover the casserole while baking. So I left it uncovered for the first 35 minutes and then realized my potatoes were still a little hard so I covered it with foil and baked another 15 minutes. Perfectly done potatoes then!

This tasted very good but the measurements were a little off.  I used a 1 qt cassarole as stated and measured everything exactly but the cassarole was overflowing.  This is right between 1 and 2 quarts.  The potatoes didn't cook through, next time I will nuke them first.  The cheese sauce was excellent however-one of the better au gratin sauces I have eaten.  Will make again with a few measurement adjustments.

This recipe was delicious, but it took MUCH longer than 35 minutes to soften up the potatoes as they were still raw at that point. When I made this recipe, I had to bake the dish for 90 minutes to get the right texture.  The dish is a bit greasy, but that was easily mitigated by draining off the excess oil as it pools on top.  Because the dish is a bit bland, I like to season it before serving with extra salt and pepper or creole seasoning.

This has excellent flavor, but the recipe needs some modifications.  First, for raw potatoes, the cooking time is about 2 hours at 350 degrees.  This is fine as long as you know it and plan ahead.  Second, you will need to double or triple this recipe to feed your family (the original recipe is for about two servings).  If you triple it, you will need to triple the ham, potato and onion portions, and you will need to **double** the sauce.  If you triple the sauce, there will be too much liquid and oil.  Again, the flavor is wonderful, and it is a good way to use up leftover ham.

This casserole was wonderful!  I tend to not measure when I cook and I put more ham in than called for, but it came out fine.  I also had to bake it for more than an hour for the potatoes to cook through - next time I may pre-cook the potatoes.  I also added thinly sliced carrots, as well as herbs from our garden: basil, marjoram, fennel, lovage (tastes like celery), and rue.  I forgot to put in salt and pepper but it didn't need any. I also used a mix of cheddar and colby/jack cheese and it was perfect!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Excellent!! I served a spiral ham the day before and had plenty left over for this recipe. I took the advice of some other reviews and par-boiled my potatoes for about 12 minutes. Also added Italian style bread crumbs to the top (add during the last 15 minutes to keep them from burning)and some paprika. I also added a little green onion mixed in with the sweet onion. Magnificent!! I added a few things to this recipe, but for the most part stuck with it. Plan on this being a frequent recipe.

After 45 minutes my potatoes were still hard. I suggest cutting the potatoes in very small cubes (mine were about 1/2 inch) or cooking them slightly first.

i doubled this yummy recipe using the leftover spiral cut christmas ham that was in my freezer. after parboiling my potatoes i peeled then sliced them about 1/2" thick, layering them on an slight angle with the ham tucked inbetween for a scalloped effect. no other changes were made to this yummy dish aside from using sharp cheddar cheese & twice as much onion & white pepper. thanks novella!

Pretty good...but I think I've made it better...
1.  Double up on the cheese
2.  Use canned sliced potatoes. Eleviates the "potatoes weren't done" dilemma I read from others.
3.  Add 2 cups +/- frozen mixed veggies (corn, carrots, green beans) to the ham mixture
4.  Sprinkle bread crumbs on top. 
AND
5.  USE IT FOR BRUNCH THE NEXT DAY!
a)   Coat a skillet with butter or butter cooking spray
b)  Fill half of the skillet with leftovers, so there's a 1/2" layer
c)  Cook on Medium heat until golden on the bottom, then flip and do the same on the other side
d)  I also added chopped sliced jalapenos as it was cooking on the 1st side (to taste - just to give it wang, but my husband likes it with more japs)
e)  when it's cooking on side b, butter the other side of the skillet and cook an egg or two on that side.
f)  place mixture onto a plate, then the eggs on top of that

oh-my-gosh! :)

It took a little longer for the potatoes to get to the right texture, but this is a wonderful comfort food. It's perfect after coming in from a cold winter day at work.

I had a left over ham steak that I cubed up for this, it was perfect. I liked this recipe so much that I have made it two times now. My two small Grandkids loved it and it is really good as left overs too! I also doubled the recipe and used a little more onion.

This was so awesome!!! I doubled the recipe and did make a few changes. I thinly sliced the potatoes instead of dicing. I also sauteed the onions in 2T of the butter needed for the sauce, then added the rest of the butter and continued as directed. I used 1 cup of mild cheddar and 1 cup of colby-jack cheese as well.  Baked for 1 and 15 minutes at 350 covered with foil and then uncovered for another 30 minutes til nice and brown. Soooooo good!

good recipe but I continue to be frustrated when recipes dont allow enough time to cook potatos.  either parboil or add at least 20 minutes to the cooking time.

Awesome! Pretty tastey.
Next time I would probablyl use less butter in the sauce.. andeven use corn starch to thicken it as it was a little soupy when it was finished.  I used 2 cups of potatoes, and 2 cups of ham.  I would definitely make a double batch next time to cook a second meal with the leftovers, and use a biscuit topping... :) Yum.

My husband loved this. I did too, but he REALLY loved it. I doubled the recipe and we had plenty of leftovers. I also took suggestions about topping it with panko and some cheese. The slight crunch added a nice dimension. Another keeper recipe in my house.

Just made this tonight. Took others advice and added more onion, maybe 1/3 cup, minced small in a mini processor. So if you are an onion person (i.e. loves onions) then this amount is perfect for you. I also used monterey jack cheese and it was pretty creamy. The current servings fed our family of 6, and we plan to use the leftovers as a side to our scrambled eggs in the morning. Thanks for the great eats!

I left out the onion due to personal preference but other than that followed recipe.  I was wonderful!  UPDATE:  I have made this a few more times and wanted to add to my review.  I have tried this as written without onions, with a bread crumb topping and with a cracker crumb topping.  Let me tell you, the cracker crumb on top is wonderful and makes this recipe even better.

Loved it!  Changed some things based on what I had on hand.  1/2 cup cream cheese and 1/2 cup shredded Mexican cheese mix.  Shredded the potatoes so they would cook faster.  My 2 year old even loved it.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the share!

This was excellent! I had a lot of potatoes so i made two casserole dishes (essentially quadrupeling the recipe). The first i made as the recipe stated and it turned out quite yummy! On the second, for the sauce i added parmesan cheese (no cheddar) and garlic and some crushed red pepper and poured that on top of the potato and ham mixture (i did not mix the sauce around, just let it sit on top) then i put a few slices of swiss cheese to cover the top. I put them in the oven for about an hour and they both came out great but the family RAVED about the parmesan one. Just an idea if you want to change the recipe up a bit!

I sliced the potatoes with a slicer.  It was tasty, I just thought it was a little rich for a main dish.

Loved this recipe!  I sauteed 1 chopped onion in butter instead of the minced onion.  I also used "generous" amounts of cubed potatoes and ham.  Cooked for about 1 hour.  Delicious and I will make again.

I used thinly sliced potatoes and a thinly sliced onion. The sauce was great. I used a package of minced ham, which I don't recommend because they ended up like little pencil erasers. I'll make this again, I'll just be sure to use bigger chunks of ham.

Delicious! I would recommend thinly slicing the potatoes rather than cubing them, adding about 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 garlic powder to the sauce.  I cooked it covered for 1 hour and then 10 minutes to brown the top.

I doubled the serving...grated cheese over it, covered it with foil paper whilst cooking, then when done uncovered and put the top grill on to make the top layer nice and crispy. Everybody LOVED it

This was very good.  It did take longer to cook than suggested.  Around 1 hour 15 minutes.  I used the Vidalia onion chopper to cube my potatoes and that worked great.  I put the potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes prior to cooking in the oven.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added some breadcrumbs as well as paprika on top.  Also, I used 1 whole onion. I also took the cover off for the last 15 minutes to brown the top a little.  Over all a very good recipe.

Very good recipe, a keeper! But as written, it definitely needs a crumb topping. Next time I'll try the panko topping--sounds perfect! But the roux tonight was creamy, delicious, with a light texture. We really enjoyed it!

This dish was very delicious, I did make a couple of changes, I used a package of Simply sliced potatoes, cut the butter back to ¼ cup, and I used Asiago cheese! Because I made some changes I gave the recipe 4 stars. Very easy I will make again!

This is a great recipe!  I had to take away a star though because the cooking time is off.  I ended up baking mine for 40 minutes, covered, then another 40 minutes, uncovered.  It would probably cook faster if the potatoes were thinly sliced.  Otherwise, we loved the cheese sauce and how the flavor of the ham permeates the potatoes and sauce.  I will make this again!

My idea of comfort food. I sliced the potatoes instead of cubing, because gratin potatoes don't seem right if they aren't sliced. maybe because of this they took a little longer to cook than stated. I made these a couple of weeks ago and whilst I can't remember what I served them with, I do remember the potatoes. Thanks so much Novella.

Pretty good. I used packaged diced potatoes and cooked for 45 minutes. Could have used a little longer cooking, but not much.

Just a great, simple meal which my husband & I loved.  Potatoes were a little undercooked so I may parboil next time.  We also love lots of onion so sauted one onion and added in with roux.  Leftovers heated up in microwave are #1 as well.  Thanks for recipe!

This was very greasy but delicious! I sliced my potatoes and mix them with the onion, ham and cheese sace in a big mixing bowl then poured it into the 2 quart dish. Since I double the recipe I set the temp to 400 and baked for 45 min-hour, it was perfect! The leftovers were okay but not as good as they were just after coming out of the oven!

This is very good.  A great comfort dish on a cold day.  I did tweak it.  I parboiled the potatoes for around 6-7 mins.  I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 mozz..  I used 4 Tbls. of onion and I cooked the onion and 2 cloves of garlic, minced in a some butter for a few mins. before adding them in with potatoes and ham.  I took another reviwers suggestion and made a topping of Panko crumbs, parm. cheese and paprika mixed with some melted butter.  My husbands only suggestion to make it better was more topping!

Would give a 5 for taste but a 2 on the timing of the recipe.  Goodness, I baked for 45 min and the potatoes tasted raw.  I baked another 20 min, still very very crunchy.  Finally, after 95 minutes, the potatoes were done and it was delicious.  I'd make it again soon but definately par boil the potatoes.  I followed the recipe exactly, doubling as suggested.  There are plenty leftover so I'm anxious to taste the leftovers tomorrow for lunch.  Thank you!

I've made this with and without ham and it's yummy either way. The proportion of sauce to potatoes is very nice so it's creamy and delicious, never mealy. Reheats wonderfully and very filling. I like to add chopped green onion, broccoli or washed baby spinach. I only took off a star because of the issue with the cooking time, which parboiling the potatoes does take care of nicely.

I sliced the potatoes as was suggested and used a 9 x 13 pan and kept everything else the same. It was awesome. I made it the day after Easter when I needed a recipe to use the ham leftovers without just doing more ham sandwiches. I will be using this recipe more than just after Easter and Christmas. It was great!

This is my husband's favorite recipe from this site and he asks for it every week.  I love it, too.  I agree with the previous review that the potatoes need to be par-boil or they won't be done in the time span.  The sauce makes a very generous amount.  I now adjust the amounts of the sauce ingredients to make less sauce but I don't change the ingredients themselves.  Why should I?  It tastes great.  Try it as written - you'll like it.

This recipe turned out really good.  I tried a few variations that I read from other reviews, I added chopped garlic to the melted butter, more onion, reduced butter and added a can of drained corn.  I'll definitely make this again, but next time I may add broccoli...it cries for something green!  Thanks a lot!

This was just "okay." I may make it again with some more changes, but I tried it twice as written, and it takes a very long time to cook (over an hour), it's rather bland, and the butter + melted cheese combo makes it almost greasy. The second time, I added some more onion, tried Velveeta instead of cheddar and chopped some fresh garlic, but it was still pretty "blah." I had to go 4 stars, though....because my 9 year old LOVED it.

Very well received by my guests.  I also added some diced fresh tomatoes and liked the added flavour.

F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S.  I used leftover smoked ham.  I also doubled the recipe, but instead of 2/3 c. butter, just used 1/2 cup, which was more than enough.  I increased the onion to 1/2 cup and added one clove of minced garlic, which I sauted in the butter before adding the flour.  I parboiled the potatoes, as suggested by another reviewer.  I topped the casserole with some bread crumb topping that I make with a sliced of toasted wheat bread that I put in the food processor with some oregano and parmesan cheese.  DH was ready to lick his plate clean.  Talk about some great comfort food!

Sauce was not the best, bland and way too much butter, it sort of pooled around the edge of the dish.  This took about 25 min. more to cook than recipe said.  I am giving this three stars instead of one, only because my boyfriend cleaned his plate (I think he was really hungry)  Sorry, but I won't make this again.

This one is a keeper!  My husband and fussy toddler loved it.  Excellent comfort food for the winter season.  Potatoes took an extra half hour or so to cook.  I also used half a sliced onion and a little extra cheese.  Excellent recipe!

Great, filling recipe. This took longer to cook than the recommended time. I doubled the recipe, using a larger dish, but it took almost twenty mins longer. Otherwise, it was a great dish that could stand alone, though I served it with steamed yellow and green squash. Could also use leftovers for breakfast or lunch the next day!

Love this recipe! Only change was boiling the potatoes to soften them a bit. Otherwise, there's nothing to improve on. Fast, easy and even a beginner like me can't screw it up.

Delicious! I also like to add broccoli or spinach, and, like other reviewers, more onion. I've also made this substituting chicken broth for the milk (I was out), and it was really good like that too.

Followed the basic recipe, with the exception of par boiling the potatoes first as I tripled the recipe. I also added a little more onion than called for as that is a family preference. Good recipe!

Prepared as written the other night. I did  not bother with the GARNISH this dish was gone too quick!
This is a great use for leftover ham.  On one aside, I used GOLD YUKON POTATOES..which made me increase the cooking time 10 minutes.
This is deleesh.....

Thin sliced the potatoes and parboiled. No salt, pepper or parsley. Weren't needed. Topped with some extra cheese before baking.

fantastic!!!  I'm not new to making potato ham bake but never thought to add the onion...made a huge difference...wonderful.  My husband who is a chef said that he'd be taking this recipe to work with him...I also used one of the reviewers suggestions to add the panko breadcrumbs on top...awesome!!!

Very good.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and parboiled the potatoes first.  I might have used a bit more cheese, I just eyeballed it.  Bread crumb topping gave it just the right amount of crunch.

Great flavor but I think the potatoes needed to be pre-cooked.  Mine were still hard when it came time to eat.  Microwaving a small bowl did the trick.

This is an easy, great tasting recipe.  The thing I really liked about it was that I had everything on hand and did not have to run to the grocery store!  I did substitute havarti cheese for the cheddar cheese and it was absolutely awesome.

Very good.  The family really liked it.  I agree that parboiling (or even pan-frying) the potatoes for 5-7min would be a good idea (maybe parboil the potatoes, then make the roux in the same (dried) parboil saucepan/pot ).  Even though I had a pretty uniform 1/4" dice, some potato bites were perfect and some were quite underdone.

Wonderful comfort food.  I sliced the potatoes rather than cube them.  Creamy.  Cheesey.  Easy.  Even with fat free milk it was rich and wonderful.  My husband and I ate the whole thing.  No leftovers.  Next time I will double the recipe.

This dish was delicious! I have a hard time finding things that my family all love and this one was a hit! I did have to double the recipe for my large family.

Simple and very good.  I did not have any trouble with the cooking time, so I'm not sure why so many others did.  I cubed mine somewhat small because of the other reviews...that may be why.  I also tripled the potatoes and ham and doubled the cheese sauce.  Came out thick and delicious; not soupy at all like others experienced.  Although I reduced the amount of cheese sauce, I followed ingredients exactly (oh, I add one glove of garlic finely chopped)...next time I'd like to add some herbs and I think that will make this recipe over the top!  You wont got wrong - try it!

Not gourmet, just good-ole-fashioned hearty food!  A great way to use up leftover ham.  I had to make it with Velveeta and it was still good.  Imagine what it would be like with REAL cheese!  I cooked it longer since we weren't ready to eat yet.  I think the leftovers would be awesome with a little milk added to make a very tasty potato/ham soup.

I followed the recipe exactly.I used thinly sliced potatoes and still  had to cook for an hour and a  half. The only thing I will change next time is to add a little garlic. Great family recipe.

Very good.  Not sure where the time frame is coming from, though.  Definitely have to cook potatoes longer than the recipe states, even diced potatoes!  I baked covered at 375 for an hour then uncovered and baked another 30 minutes.  This was perfect.  I added some seasoning--garlic, onion powder, basil, oregano--to the roux.  I agree this is a bit greasy--perhaps less cheese or butter next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

A great winter dish! I use a mandolin to slice the potatoes. I also find that it takes about 30 minutes to make and about 1 hour or more to bake. Don't know why it takes that long - maybe slicing the potatoes slows down the cook time.

This was delicious!  The only problem I had wsa that I tried to double it and it did not cook up quickly.  I had to increase the oven temp and after about 2 hours it was ready.  We have a large family so I need larege recipes.  Next time I will try putting it all in the crockpot, so we aren't eating so late while waiting on this to cook in the oven.  Great taste though!!!

I used a bit more potatoes, a bit less ham, half of an onion, a teaspoon of minced garlic, only 2 Tbsp. butter, slightly less cheese, and cayenne instead of white pepper.  Covered and baked at 375 for about an hour.  Turned out great!

We did not care for this recipe.  I followed the ingredients to a T.  After reading the reviews I decided  par-boil the potatoes for 5 minutes.  Even then, they were still not cooked after the recomended baking time.  Also, it was a fairly bland flavor.  I would have thought with the cheddar and the onion it would have more flavor.  We tried to eat more of it for lunch today but will not eat the rest.  Next time I will just make scalloped potatoes with ham added.

I followed the recipe to the tee, the only difference is that I doubled the recipe (the originalone is only for 2 servings).  I made sure that the potatoes were cubed really small so they would cook evenly. The recipe made quite alot of sauce, so I had to cook it longer to dry it out a bit. Easy and good.  The only thing that I would change is maybe adding some seasoned salt or garlic salt into the recipe.

This is a good recipe. It's great to use up leftover ham from the holidays that has been sitting in my freezer. I made a few adjustments: 1. I used cubed hash browns available at the freezer section. They were perfectly cooked after 30 to 40 minutes. 2. I added 2 cloves of garlic and sprinkled some red pepper flakes in the cheese sauce to give it more flavor.

I had leftover ham to use and no potatoes but I did have some frozen hashbrowns.  They worked quite nicely.  With the hashbrowns the 35 minute baking time was just right.  I doubled the recipe and it was just right for a 9X13 pan.  I think it was a little on the bland side and would have given it just 3 stars but my 4 year old liked it and had seconds hence the 4 stars.  Maybe next time I'll add some garlic.

I've been making this recipe for a while now and my family loves it. Like others, I have had to bake it longer than stated to get the potatoes done to my liking, but it is YUMMY!  This is easily transformed into soup by adding 1-2 cups of milk at the end. I will often make soup with our leftovers!

Such a comfort food!  Very good!  I did what other suggested and boiled the potatos first since I didn't have over an hour to cook it.  I think the only suggestion I would have would be to cube the potatos smaller than what I did.  More cheese to potato ratio!  I also used fat free milk and it worked great (hey...whatever helps!)

Fabulous !!!!! This is a wonderful dish. I had a lot of left over ham from Easter that I froze in individual zipper bags and needed an idea for a meal. My family really loved it. The only thing was, it certainly didn't cook in 35-40 min. It was over an HOUR. The potatoes were hard as rocks after 35 min. So plan ahead for a much longer cooking time. But, it certainly is worth the wait.

Very delicious! I was amazed at how good this sauce was. There was actually more sauce than I thought there would be, but we liked it that way. A couple baking tips: as other reviewers said, it needs to be baked longer. Also, I put it in a casserole dish a little larger than what was called for, and the sauce still boiled over and made a mess out of my oven. I suggest using a 2-quart dish just to make sure you don't get spills in your oven.

Very yummy.  The sauce was really thick and good, but I did add a bit more cheese.  I also added a topping of bread crumbs and parmesean.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was average.  I sliced my potatoes, so I didn't have a baking issue like other reviewers.

The blend of the flavors was excellent, but even after an hour, the potatoes were still a bit hard.

Very yummy! Great for potlucks. To save time, I used frozen diced potates instead of fresh. The one change for next time would be to use less salt.

This was okay.  I cooked mine for 1.5 hours and it was still not done.  I gave it four stars because the sauce is great and I will use the sauce again for something.

This was tasty.  Just basic cheesy potatoes and ham, which is just what you want sometimes. :)

My family loves this recipe, I usually cook the potatoes a little before I bake it. Also, this time I didn't have flour so i substituted 2 tbls cornstarch and It worked very well. This is definetly a keeper in my house, with a side of veggies of course.

One of my hubby's all time favorites, I did cut back to about a 1/4 tsp. salt though, because the ham was salty.

Great Recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used about 4 cups of cheese which only asked for 2 cups with doubling it, and added  1 tablespoon garlic to the butter like a previous person had advised.  I only used 1/2 cup butter so it wouldn't be too greasy.  I also microwaved the cubed potatoes for about 6 minutes in a shallow-long dish.  I cooked this in a 9 x 13 pan for about 30 minutes.  My kids and husband loved this and they even had seconds.  My daughter asked if I would cook this tomorrow!  I will definatley cook this again soon.

Very good. I used thinly sliced potatoes instead of cubed, and I added an entire sliced medium onion layered between the potatoes. And then poured the cheese sauce over everything and baked. It was delicious.

This was an excellent meal for two.  Instead of using the cheddar cheese, however, I used Velveta Cheese and it was even better!  GREAT RECIPE!!!

I tripled this recipe. I precooked the potatoes to make the cooking time faster. I used green onions instead of regular. And I used sharp cheddar cheese.
This turned out great! Everyone loved it!!
