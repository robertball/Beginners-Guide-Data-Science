I could not in all conciousness serve this recipe as is to my family....at 1000cal/70grams fat per serving!!!!
I made the following changes,I used fat free sour cream,98% fat free/low sodium cream of mushroom soup and 50% fat reduced bacon bits, I did not serve all the sauce. I'm sure it wasnt as good as the full fat version, will not make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I did make some changes to it.  We don't eat mushrooms so instead of cream of mushroom I used cream of chicken.  I also cooked half of an onion with the bacon and that added a nice flavor to the dish.  I also sprinkled some fresh-cracked black pepper over the top of the dish.  I will definitely be making this again!!

My husband tasted this and said "Wow!" The combination of flavors is delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I broke the cooked bacon into bite-size pieces and sprinkled them on top of the chicken before adding the sauce.  I also sauteed the mushrooms (on the same griddle as the bacon).  Thanks for this terrific recipe...will definitely make again for both family and company.

This has been a family favorite for years. I place the chicken breast in a glass casserole and place a strip of bacon on top, then ad the sour cream/mushroom soup mixture and back with no foil for an hour....great with egg noodles to soak up great juices.

Simply Delicious! I made this last night and my husband said it was soooo good, he overate and his stomach ached! The only change I made was to add black pepper and garlic powder to the chicken, and I added some Worstershire and pepper to the sauce. It is "Company deserving" serving for sure.
I really enjoy your recipes. I have made all of my meals for the last 3 days from these recipes. Thanks, Terri

This is very similar to a recipe that my sister-in-law always brings to family gatherings. In her version she adds a slice of dried beef (not Budding pressed beef-the stuff you want to look for is in the canned meat section, by the tuna etc.)under each chicken breast. I have found 2 ways to improve her/this dish. #1 I precook the bacon and chop it up, I cannot stand limp bacon! #2 Roughly chop the dried beef and mix in with the soup/sour cream mixture. While I agree with one reviewer who complained about the high calorie/fat content, I also understand that we can't eat this every night. Save this for a special occasion and indulge once in a while.

I didn't like this as much as the other reviewers.  There was way too much sour cream/soup sauce and the mixture curdled. I used a slice of bacon for each chicken breast and that was plenty - I can't imagine using 3 slices for each breast!  I also used cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  The sauce was okay, just too rich and way too much - a waste!

This was pretty good! My husband and I like a lot of different flavors, so I made a few revisions. I added one chopped fresh medium tomato, half a medium onion, a few table spoons of ranch dressing, and I also sauted fresh mushrooms in the bacon grease, drained and added it to the soup/sour cream mixture. Another change that I made was using only 8 slices of bacon instead of 18!! 18 seemed a bit much for me. Crumbled 4 over the chicken slices and 4 into the soup mixture! Tasted excellent!

This tasted great, but for some reason the sour cream curtled.  It looked gross, but we still ate it.

The sauce is very tasty and indulgent, but the chicken is the star of this meal. The chicken breast itself had such great flavor. While I find it is easy to have the chicken come out tender in a casserole like this, it usually lacks flavor. Must be the bacon. If on hand I will use boneless chicken thighs with the same great results.

I live alone, so I try to scour the internet for easy recipes and today I made this and it is by far the best thing I have made in my little apartment...and it's easy! The only thing I did different was I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I added a little water and a little more sour cream, and it was still good. I also used mushrooms I bought fresh and ended up freezing instead of the canned ones. Thanks for sharing!

i just put this in the oven so i will update afte we eat. ive made very simlar recipes before like the smothered chicken breast recipe on here which is always good. im not sure if rating this is the right thing because like always i doctored it up a bit. i only used two chicken breasts, and four peices of bacon. i sliced each breast in half to have four pieces that i flattened, layed one piece cut in half of bacon on each and rolled it up, securing with a toothpick. to the sauce i added white wine,garlic, some milk, and about 1-1`1/2 cups of italian blend cheese. im very excited and anxious to try this. the sauce tasted great cold, so im hoping it will be a hit!

My family and I thought that the Deluxe Sour Cream Chicken was great and also
thought that the sour cream over powered the taste of the mushroom soup and 
the mushrooms. I hope this is not to harsh of a review.

-changed the soup from mushroom to cream of chicken-added some tarragon, chopped garlic. Used less sour cream and added a little milk instead to reduce the fat content- family liked it very much- served it over noodles..

This turned out so delicious!  I had enjoyed something similar at a pot luck recently.  The only thing I added was a layer of the sliced dried beef (comes in a jar)underneath the chicken, as I remembered in the one I'd tried before. A big hit!

If there was something lower than the 1 star thats what I would have chose.  This recipe sounded good but wasn't.  it was very runny and tasted like nothing but sour cream.  I love everything that has sour cream on it, but I did not like this dish at all!  I will never make it again!

I used only 1 slice of bacon per chicken breast and fresh mushrooms not canned.  The sauce was tasty if a little bland and was very runny.  I would thicken it up next time.

I'm sorry, but this turned out to be a soupy, white, runny mess.
The bacon turned soggy, the sour cream curdled and overall, very unappealling; sight and smell wise.
I was embarrassed to have served this to my family for dinner.

This was pretty good for a recipe I already had the ingredients on hand for!  I added some fresh rosemary because I had it on hand too.  I also added a little red wine to the sauce. I used only one piece of bacon for each breast based on what other reviews said.  Unless you're a big bacon fan, I would reduce the bacon.
