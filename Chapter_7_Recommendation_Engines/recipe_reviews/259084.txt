I didn't use the 1/2 teaspoon of jalapeno pepper seasoning and it didn't need it. It was plenty spicy without. What it did need is salt. Other than that I have no complaints and this was super simple.

I love spicy foods and chicken! Good flavor, I made this in the instant pot, I didn’t have pepper jack but did have jalapeño velveta, that worked great. I also had jalapeño garlic seasoning so I used that instead of jalapeño seasoning. Served on Hawaiian rolls, delicious
