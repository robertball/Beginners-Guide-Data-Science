I scaled this for 1 lb loaf for my machine and used Genoa salami, left out the mushrooms, added a bit more mozzarella. The loaf deflated a little as it cooled but the taste was very good. Had some lightly toasted with some extra mozzarella melted on top, yum. Next time I think I'll add some Italian herbs and maybe try using some pizza sauce for part of the water. It just needs some little something to give it that extra zing.

This is truly a great bread recipe. I've only had my bread machine 2 weeks, and had no problem with this recipe. It camoe out fine. Also, I didn't think the ingredient preparation took too long, nor made a great mess in the kitchen.

Great bread, Jill! I sub'd Asiago for the Mozzarella and garlic flavored olive oil for the butter. Yum! The recipe produced a high rise and a wonderful texture. Tastes good toasted, too!

This bread was very light, rose high, and had lots of flavour. I substituted cheddar for the mozzarella and didn't put in the mushrooms. I used the dough setting and then put the dough into two small loaf pans and let them rise for one hour before baking in the oven for 35 minutes.

I made this bread today in my breadmaker and baked it in the oven. The only problem I had is that there didn't seem to be enough flour as the dough was sticky and I ended up adding about 1/2 cup more,  but it still turned out excellent!

Everyone loves this bread.  It seems to work best if started in the bread machine and cooked in the oven.  It takes extra time and work to make it, but, it is well worth it!  I use turkey pepperoni to lower the fat content, it still tastes the same.

I tried this today with just a few modifications.  I thought it called for a bit too much water for 3 cups of flour so I reduced the water to 1 1/4 cups (warm water).  I used 1/2 cup cheddar in place of the mozzarella and about 1/4 cup parmesan.  Omitted the mushrooms and added about 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning.  I baked it in my breadmaker and it turned out perfect.  Some reviewers felt it was missing something and I also thought it was somewhat bland on it's own.  It is best sliced, topped with a little pizza sauce and cheese and broiled.

This wonderful 'bread' is a full meal in our house.  It is also wonderful with soup or salad's.  I realy loved it but it takes a long time to prepare the stuff that goes in it.  Makes a big mess in the kitchen to :) Was a great bread and i will make it again.

Fantastic! I changed this a little but it's fundamentally the same.  I only added pepperoni and mozzarella (no mushrooms, etc.). Don't use a bread machine so I made it by hand, then formed it into rolls.  Before baking I sprinkled garlic salt on top. They were so delicious our Bible study group gobbled them all up.

I added less yeast...I have fast rising refrigerated type and it does't require as much.I also added 2 fresh garlic cloves,fresh basil, thyme, oregano and chives from the garden.I had to add about 3/4 cup more flour as it was sticking to the bottom and sides.

My husband made this and took other reviewers suggestions. He used cheddar, did not add mushrooms, and used fresh onions. It turned out really yummy! Thank you!

My family loved this bread. I added 1tsp italian seasonings to it, and used fresh onion instead of dried. We served it toasted with mozzarella cheese...and as mini pizzas with pizza sauce and mozz. cheese. My kids love it and have already asked to have it again.

Very good bread!!! I exchanged low fat milk for the water and powdered milk,also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I used my KitchenAid mixer  proofing the yeast and milk heated to 110 degrees and all the rest of the ingredients mixing them than adding the liguid.   After rising for 1 hour pounding it down placing it in a bread pan letting it rise another 1/2 hour than placing it in 375 degree oven for 35 minutes.

I made a few adjustment.  Used ground pepperoni and added cheddar cheese and removed mushrooms.  Turned out great!

I truly liked this bread, turned out perfect. This is my forth loaf with my bread machine. The pepperoni and mozzarella were light flavors, which was perfect with my pasta dish. I used turkey  pepperoni as I don't eat yucky pork. Otherwise, I followed the instructions exactly.  I do not yet understand the magic used in bread machines or ovens so I am afraid to experiment. When  I have a choice,I only buy the best organic stuff or use food from my garden so I am not wasting on "what if I..."
BTW, I would give this 5 stars except that means I love it.

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because that's what I'd really like to rate it.  It's excellent, and very hard to stop eating... with a few changes.  My breadmaker came with a similar recipe for a pepperoni & cheese bread, so I wound up taking a few ideas from that recipe, as well as from other reviews.  

On the advice of my other recipe, I added about 1/2 tsp of dried oregano flakes, and used 1 tsp of yeast instead of the 2.5 tsp this recipe calls for, which wound up being plenty--but keep in mind that I let the breadmaker do the actual baking instead of removing the dough to rise and then baking it in an oven.  More yeast may have been needed if I'd wound up going the route this recipe suggests.

I took a reviewer's idea of adding pizza sauce (about a TBSP) in place of some of the water, as well as the idea of using 1.25 cups of water and 3.25 cups of flour.  Since I was completely out of onion in dry or fresh form, I chopped up a small clove of shallot, and since I like cheese, I added about 1/8 cup each of provolone and of a shredded "Fiesta" mix of cheeses such as colby, cheddar, quesadilla y asadero cheeses.  Since I love garlic, I added about 1 tsp of garlic paste, and since I hate mushrooms I left those out.

The end result was very tasty, although a bit light on pepperoni.  It was also a bit too moist, no doubt from all the fat in the ingredients, so I think that next time I make this recipe I'll add more pepperoni, and leave out the butter entirely.

Massive failure. Too much garlic and onion, way too much. Mushrooms, don't bother they get pulverized to nothing, same with the pepperoni, which was a real bummer as I had some most excellent locally smoked pepperoni it was reduced to specks.
Not enough mozzarella or parm to even bother putting it in. It sinks in the middle, mine went down while it was still baking.
 Epic fail, will not make again. 
Total bummer!

This bread is delicious! It is so soft and flavorful! I read lots of the reviews and added some Italian seasonings and mixed some cheddar in with the mozzarella. I also used less pepperoni because I didn't have enough. I will definitely be making again!

I had some pepperoni that I wanted to use, so found this recipe.  So glad I did, as it's a keeper in my recipe box now!  I had to use cheddar, and didn't use the mushrooms, but followed recipe otherwise.  It rose up so quickly that I put it in a 9x13 cake pan, in a "free form" style.  Smelled divine as it baked......I just had to have a slice when I took it out of the oven.  Mmmmm!

The bread had a very pretty reddish orange hue to it because of the pepperoni.  I did not need to chop any of the ingredients because the bread maker breaks it up all on its own.  We ate a few pieces of the bread when it was fresh out of the bread machine and the rest sat in the fridge for over a week before we threw it out.  I agree that the recipe appears to be missing flavors.  Will not make again.

Loved it. Just did it on white bread in the bread maker. As long as your bread maker can handle a two puund loaf it should work.

So, here is my spin on this....used olive oil instead of butter, 1 1/4 C water, used cheddar instead of mozzarella and did not use mushrooms, added cilantro,basil and oregano, garlic and onion powder.  Used dough setting then lightly pressed into rectangle.  Filled the middle with very thinly sliced pepperoni and mozzarella, Baked 30 minutes in oven.....AWESOME!!!!
