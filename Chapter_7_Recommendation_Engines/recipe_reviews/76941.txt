This simple recipe is almost exactly the recipe that i've used for years.  Except we add 2 packets of Sweet & Low to tone down the tartness of the limeade.  Also, try and use a quality tequila as this will make a huge difference in the  taste.

Great ratio of ingredients, better than the similar recipe with far more ratings...Made a double batch per recipe (substituted Triple Sec for the Cointreau) & stuck it in the freezer on a Wednesday....well, these are so GOOD (translated STRONG) that they were barely slushy by Sunday! Everyone loved them, neither the limeade nor the triple sec over powered, they tasted great & did the trick ;-D

Yummy! And you can change the flavor really easily by adding any Pucker flavor to the drink. Strawberry, Watermelon or Island Blue are my favorites!

Very easy and good.  These are just the right amount of sweetness.  I used Triple Sec, instead of Cointreau, since the Cointreau is so expensive.  They are so simple to whip up for a gathering!

Very good recipe! Make sure you don't put too much ice in the blender at once. I had to remove some in order to get it crushed.

The perfect margarita.  We use regular triple sec and it tastes wonderful.  Not as expensive to make as the premade store bought mixes.  Thanks.

These are soooo good! I have made them twice now and each time I've loved them! They're better than any I've had in restaurants. ?

I have frozen leftovers of the margaritas in a large plastic containter, too. They freeze well, not hard, but into a slush which can be enjoyed anytime without having to make a new batch!

I use a similar recipe.  Instead of the cointreau I add a corona.  Gives it a little fizz and an extra kick!!  A winner EVERY time!!

Simple ingredients, easy to make, and produces a great tasting margarita. A high power blender makes the blending task so much faster and the drink super smooth.

I love a good margarita and am very picky! These taste exactly like the margaritas they serve at the local higher-end Mexican restaurants in my area. I can't even tell you how many dollars I have saved with this recipe, but it's a lot!

I adore Margaritas and these were amazing!! Here in N.J. we're getting April weather in May (chilly and rainy) and I guess I'm just used to sipping my Margaritas in the heat of the summer when the drink starts to melt quickly. It was pretty brisk today and one little "schluk" of my drink sent my brain into a very painful freeze; YIKES! No matter, loved 'em anyway. Gracias!!

Very good frozen margarita! Just made a pitcher and I'm on my third glass now. You know, I've always used cheaper Triple Sec but now I know why people say Cointreau is the best! Nothing but delicious on an 85 degree day! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

this is a similar recipe I use but I add 1/3 can of frozen lemonade.  Equal that with triple sec (so 1/3 can of triple sec).  These are better than any restaurants.

I used Curaco instead of the Cointreau since I had it on hand.  Very yummy!  Quick and easy to make!  I found using adding 1 quart of ice added to the blender first followed by half of the Limeade, Vodka (or rum or whatever hard liquor you choose) and Curaco worked well for the ice to grind up properly.  I then mixed it all in an ice cream container for storing in the freezer.

This is a great and easy idea for making frozen margaritas.  I happened to have MINUTE MAID limeade in the freezer already.  Made it with 8 oz of tequila and 6 oz of Hiram Walker 60 proof triple sec in a single batch.  Yummy!

Super easy. Made it in 2 batches just like it stated. Very tasty and good consistency. I put it in an ice cream bucket and placed in freezer. Take out of freezer about 10 mins before using. I take out what I need and place the rest back in freezer. Great for summer shindigs!

We made this tonight.  I'm not a margarita drinker.  At all.  I generally hate them.  But we tried these for cinco de mayo for everyone else, and I decided to taste it.  Everyone else loved them, and I actually drank half of one (without the salt).  It was good.  If you're a hard core margarita purist, you might not like them, but everyone here really enjoyed them!

I've made Margaritas a few times now with this recipe.  The first two times I made it, I enjoyed it, very much.  But then I had it on the rocks, it was a little too sweet, very strong, and I thought that maybe I should go for a more traditional recipe using only lime juice and a bit of sweetener, but that proved to be too sour for my taste (not to mention a little more work in squeezing all the limes.)  As a rocks drink, it is a little too on the sweet side for my liking.  But as for a frozen drink as the recipe states here, this is by far my favorite.  I also like to add a little bit of frozen strawberries, which adds a little zing to the flavor.  But even following the recipe letter for letter, it is awesome! Bravo!

We recently moved into a new home and decided to invite all the neighbors over for tacos and margaritas.  Everyone enjoyed the tacos but it was the margaritas that were the hit of the evening.  We went thru 6 batches for 10 people.  So good and so easy that we are doing it again next party! Of course my husband took all the credit for being an awesome bartender.

This is the best frozen drink recipe I have ever found - the alcohol and sugar ratios create the best slush consistency even after stored in the freezer for over 24 hours. I say drink because I have used this with more than the margarita version (which was great). I have done lemonade concentrate and vodka, pineapple juice concentrate and dark/light rum, limeade and white/coconut rum all using different liquors

My husband loves margarita but we have not been able to find a good recipe that isn't too syrupy.   This was great.  He really liked it and was so easy to make.   Will be our margarita go to recipe.

Perfect simple recipe on a hot day. My husband has made these a few times over the last couple of weeks and they always come out perfect. I must admit he has altered the recipe slightly with triple sec instead of the Cointreau, added a 1/4 cup of sugar and about a tablespoon of the dimmer salt into the blender. We don't rim the glass, so this gives a little saltiness to the drink to bring out the flavors.  Thank you!

These were amazing and so easy to make. I added a pack of sweetener to each batch (made it in two batches, like the recipe suggested) which made it even better, in my opinion. Definitely going to make again.

Our go-to margarita recipe. Very tasty. But all ingredients can't fit into a normal-sized blender, though.

This is the perfect 'rita to make at home. We used Grand Marnier rather than Cointreau. I know it's $$$, but we don't have these everyday! I only add enough ice to make it the consistency we prefer. I never measure. Like the idea of adding some lemonade to it. Next time I will give it a try. Oh, and we never use salt. Just a preference.
