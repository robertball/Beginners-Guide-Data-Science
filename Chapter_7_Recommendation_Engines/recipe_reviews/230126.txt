I am sorry, I hate to be rude.  But this was disgusting.  Don't waste your ingredients, even if they are only leftovers.

Do not waste your time on this. They tasted terrible. The frosting tasted alright though. ??

I was looking for a recipe for leftover turkey and when I read this one, I must admit I was very skeptical.  I just had to try it. The frosting is tricky. I used much less gravy than the original to make it look more like a fluffy frosting rather than a glaze.  It was good.  I gave one cupcake to my dog, minus the frosting.  She loved it.
I will definitely make more of these for my granddogs and my pup.
I am serving them to my hubby, along with other snacks, a veggie tray and dip while we watch the Browns/Steelers game today!
