Loved the flavors in this and how easy it was to prepare and I know it's called 'sweet' in the title but it was just TOO sweet for us as written. I reduced the basil and added in a bit of oregano which was good. I am still giving this 4 stars because it's a nice easy tasty sauce but I will adjust the sugar next time. Thanks for sharing.:)

Nice and easy sauce.  I only had a partial can of tomato paste and made up for it using some gochujang and then skipped the hot pepper flakes. I also used only 1 tablespoon of sugar and also added half a teaspoon of oregano. Next time I might put in half oregano and half basil. The family loved it.
