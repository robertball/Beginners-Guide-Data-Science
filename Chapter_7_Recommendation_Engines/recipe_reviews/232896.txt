It turned out quite nicely, however it turned a little soft throughout the day and it had a distinct condensed milk taste. I personally like the taste, but I found it a little overpowering. Overall however it was a delicious treat to share with friends over the holidays.

This is a really good recipe. I didn't have 3 cups of white baking chips so I substituted 1 cup of the white baking chips and 2 cups of white chocolate chips. I also added about a teaspoon of peppermint extract and it turned out amazing. It's a little thick during pouring, but it's sets up good.  When you bite into the fudge you get a smooth bite of peppermint perfection. Definitely will continue to make this in the future.

it was delicious and creamy but almost too buttery or something, just not quite the right taste, i think next time i would add a teaspoon of mint extract to enhance the peppermint flavor. i'd name this vanilla-buttermint fudge..

I didn't have the andes mints, so I used chocolate chips and a lot  of pepermint extract (as much as I dared while keping the same consistency). I could not taste the mint. I asked a friend to make the same recipe, using my modifications but adding more mint - in any form - to taste. She said she could never get enough mint either. If there was a way to get the flavors to come out, I would like to try it, but the white cchocolate was used in too much quantity, and since there are not a large variety of ingredients, changing them for something else would alter the fudge beyond recognition. I would call this white chocolate fudge.
