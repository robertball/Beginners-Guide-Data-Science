It was a wonderful recipe. I live in Mexico so we use a lot of chillies and tomatillos. The only change that I made was to roast the chillies and tomatillos before in put them in the blender. Great recipes. I have never been disappointed with a recipe by Chef John.

Made this last night and everyone loved it. However I did make some changes. I roasted the garlic, jalapeno, poblano and tomatillos and rather than combining and blending with the chicken broth I used the broth to deglaze the pan after browning the pork and onion. It was an excellent meal with lots of flavor!

Living in a remote area, with not a lot of fresh produce available, this recipe has a lot of personal firsts in it.   This is my first time making, or even tasting, chili verde.   It's also my first time using fresh tomatillos and pablonos.     Having said that, I love this recipe.   It's easy to make and it tastes so fresh and has just a bit of a bite.   I love the suggestion of using pickled red onions on top.   The meal does not need them and is exceptional on its own, but they add another level.   The onions are also great just on their own.   My blender probably isn't on par with the one that Chef John uses, because I had to blend for a much longer time to make this creamy.   Otherwise it was a bit grainy.    So make sure you have it very blended before adding it to the meat.   Also, my potatoes took significantly longer to become tender than what the recipe states.    I like this recipe just as written.   Thank you CJ for another fantastic recipe.

This was my first attempt at chili verde and we loved it.  My husband orders this a lot when we eat out. Mexican food is our favorite! I used pork chops  rather than pork shoulder and Hatch green chilies instead of a poblano since they are in season. I roasted all of the veggies, including an onion, as others suggested. We made sopes ( corn masa type crust that is grilled on a flat top and then edges pinched to form a rim and then it is fried so it is crispy) and put the chili verde on top. This is as good or better than any restaurant. This is a keeper recipe. I froze the leftovers because my husband will not eat leftovers --- this will be a quick meal next time we eat it.

I can't stop tasting it as it cooks! Made this to use up some pork loin leftovers. I didn't have any coriander so I substituted garam masala mix. Only used 2 1/2 jalapenos and a sprinkle of cayenne. It's the perfect amount of heat for me. I also roasted the tomatillas, peppers, and garlic. A tip: if you roast garlic unpeeled, it's really easy to get out of the shell afterwards.

This is amazing. I followed the advice of others and roasted the peppers  and tomatillos first. I took it to my neighborhood chili cook off and came in first place!

Far surpassed expectations. Because my tomatillos looked less than ripe, I went ahead and broiled them for 8 minutes on the skin side and 5 minutes in the flesh side, and tossed the peppers and garlic in the pan to roast too. I omitted the cilantro because I can’t personally stand the taste. Will definitely make again!

It was delicious. Because I didn't want to spend $13 on pork shoulder, I bought a 2.5 pound pork sirloin roast. I dry roasted the garlic, and did as others suggested and roasted the poblano pepper. As a time-saver, I substituted canned mild Hatch chillies for the jalapenos. Instead of simmering on the stove, I moved everything to the crock pot after bringing the stew to the boil. The long slow cooking made the pork meltingly tender.

I used ground pork and a jar of tomatillo salsa instead of fresh. It was very easy and it turned out great. The salsa had some chili peppers and cilantro already in it. I did add some local Habenero chilis that were hybrids raised to have the smokey flavor and not the hotness.

I also cut up the potatoes small, since I had ground pork and had browned it, I didn’t want to over cook it by having to cook thicker potatoes for a long time. 

Served it at our Halloween party. Everyone loved it!

Fantastic!  I'd never had chili verde with potatoes, but they were a great addition!  I needed a mild version, so left out the 3 jalapenos.  Everyone who ate it loved it.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would!!! 

This is the best Pork Chili Verde I have ever had and I love love love Mexican food, I followed almost exact the recipe but accidentally forgot to take out the seeds from jalapinos and I didn't have poblano pepper either and I used 2 pounds of tomatillos ...I also roasted the veggies before blending too. I used pork loin country style ribs so the bones gave out richer flavor and it came out perfect!!! (I love spicy food so I didn't need to deseed the peppers) 

I can't wait to try with poblano pepper next time.  I'm going to try more of his recipes now, THANK YOU!

CROCK POT VERSION??:   I seared the meat well in Avacado oil (takes high heat & retains nutritional advantage) then added to crock pot after doing the recipe the same.  I added the chunks of potato to the crock pot  without adding more water or broth & cooked on high for 1 hour, then switched to low for 4 more hours.  Excellent flavor.  I agree with Chef that searing the meats always adds a lot of dimension to your dish. Remember to deglaze the searing pan with a quarter cup of liquid then adding to the rest of ingredients.

This is a good recipe for a beginner to use for a Mexican dish that isnt a Taco.  I'm not a fan of peppers, so I only used  2 jalapenos.  and zero poblano (couldnt find at Lucky's).   I enjoyed the flavor and the amount of heat this provided.  I only had small yukons so I weighed out 1 1/2 lbs and added to sauce.  Took longer to cook potatoes.  All in all I liked this meal.

Giving this 5 stars even though it hasn't been eaten yet, it's still simmering.  But the taste test gets an A+.  Plan to serve this with some Lime infused rice, a plop of sour cream, skipping the onions but I'll bet they are great.

Hint:  Rather than pulling out your food processor, I had good luck blending all the ingredients with an immersion blender.  Saves 'wash up' time, blend, rinse and you're done.

Will update once the friends chime in on the results.  Oh, btw,  I'm doing this in the slow cooker.  Didn't change a single thing to the recipe, just the cooking style.  I've never known a braised dish that didn't do well with long, slow, cooking.

This is our new family favorite Verde recipe.  Wow! Very good and easy.  The spicing is excellent--don't skimp.  The savory flavors with the chiles, tomatillos and fresh cilantro is superb.    Initially, I was concerned it would be too hot for some family members, so I substituted potatoes and served it over rice instead.  To compensate for that change, I cooked down the broth by about  one third.  Next time, I will use potatoes per the recipe.  Thanks 'Chef John' for sharing this!

I made it!!! And it was spectacular. I did roast the peppers and garlic before tossing it all in the food processor like one of the viewers suggested. Also, I had to cook mine a little bit longer because it was still tough after the tidea stated but I think it's because my cubes were a bit chunky. Thank you so much!! I love your recipes.

This was really good.  My husband had smoked a pork picnic so I used that meat in this.  The only thing I would do differently is add less peppers as it was a bit hot for my mom.

I feel like a broken record with Chef John's recipes and how good they all are,  it was really close to my recipe of this dish, with a few different spices I have not used in this dish, it was a very nice change.  Thanks again.

I had as bit more pork and added about 1 1/2 times the spice and an extra jalapeño and an Anaheim chili since  I couldn't find a poblano. Everything else was as written in the instructions. Good stuff

This is one of the best Chili Verda's recipes out there. I don't like cilantro so left it out. Will make this again, my husband is Puerto Rican and doesn't like overly spicy foods so this dish was great for him. Will make it for my Mexican friends next time we are in PV.

I made this with a pork shoulder I had smoked earlier that morning. Admittedly it gave it a little BBQ flavor on the bites with pork. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing. I took it to a lunch at a friends house and it was a big hit. It's good as is but I highly recommend adding a scoop of sour cream as you serve it. (I didn't have time to make the red onions. Next time...)

Chef John never disappoints!  We've been following him for some time now.  He is so entertaining and such a great teacher!

On to this recipe!  I would also give it more stars if available!  

I followed the recipe to the letter (almost), with my only deviation being using suggestions from other reviewers to roast the vegetables first.  

My goodness, it was so delicious that my husband couldn't stop talking about it.  He said this was, by far, my best dish ever!

Thanks Chef John!  And as always........ENJOY!

We don't care for too much heat, so used a couple pablanos and a couple Anaheim chilies, and added a tablespoon of masa before simmering helps to thicken and a great flavor.

I used this Chef’s recipe and made it in my pressure cooker as I do for my mutton stew.  It came out awesome. The key was to finalize with a little, salt, pepper and I added a little more cumin.

Just a few  changes in Spices n no potato. Turned out really good. Not as many tomatillos n a bit more peppers. I used Anaheim n 1-2 jalapeño. Pretty much every thing else was close. Blending was key

I really hate to review recipes which I have changed, even in the smallest ways. But, here goes!  
I used pork loin, because that's what I had. I used all the tomatillos I had on hand. I used the jalapenos I had on hand  also. 
Long story short, I agree this is a top notch recipe. I adjusted it only because I had slightly different ingredient and/or different amounts of same.  It turned out great anyway!
I would, and do, like to follow recipes like this, when I am able. But this was not one of those times.  It still means that all the ingredients and all the process was good. It just means mine tasted just a little bit different than what was intended.
Good all the way!

I made this stew as per Chef John with only one change.  I took the trouble to broil the tomatillos and chile peppers, til blistered, in my oven before I swirled them in the blender with cilantro and broth.  I cut the Yukon Golds a bit smaller but they still soaked up the flavorful broth beautifully.  I served it the day after I cooked it and it was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make it again!

Followed exactly and loved it. Spicy but not uncomfortably hot. Excellent blend of spices and the pickled onions were a surprisingly nice touch. I did not think my husband would even try the onions on top but he did and loved the entire dish.  It's more like a stew than chili but no matter what you call it, it's good!

This is a go-to recipe for us, especially when cooking for large groups. I make a LOT of this using extra tomatillos, poblano peppers and cilantro.

Excellent, but not for the faint of taste buds.   Guests who like spicy foods loved it (me too).  Too hot for my darling wife.  Will continue to make with alternative for spouse.  For me, it is too enjoyable to give up — full flavored, just-right heat, foolproof if  followed carefully.

I've made different variations of this recipe several times. 
 Overall its a great recipe as written although I usually omit the potatoes and use either pork or chicken, depending on what I have on hand.  I prefer the thinner, non-starchy consistency.

This is a winner! Easy to assemble. Made according to directions except no cilantro and only used 1 jalapeno (since I made it for company) and it was PLENTY spicy and still delicious. Served as directed with a scoop of rice to temper the spice.  I will be making this again.

This was so good! I couldn't find tomatillos sadly but I DID find a salsa in the fridg section and got three cups of that added 2 cups of the broth and stirred that in the pot with the pork and only half a onion sense there is onion in the salsa. WOW was it good. Next time  make more cause the left overs were devoured.

It came out with much more of a stew consistency than I liked.  I added some more chicken broth when I added the potatoes but it was still very thick.  I would cut the pork and potatoes into smaller cubes next time.

I should’ve used more tomatillos for the sauce.  I also broiled the peppers, tomatillos, and onions for the sauce mixture to give a smoky flavor.  Also the potatoes were very tender after 45 min.  I loved this especially on a cold day.  Chef John you’ve done it again!

This recipe's a keeper. Very, very good. Do yourself a favor and make a double batch. And definitely make the pickled onions too!

A couple of Chef John's other recipes I've made that include spicy ingredients call for way too much of the spicy stuff (IMHO, and I _like_ spicy food). Well, I took a chance with this recipe, and made it exactly as written, and it was delicious. Even my sometimes picky wife - who has a low tolerance for cilantro and spiciness - really enjoyed it.

The only thing I might change when I make this again is to add a little corn masa to thicken it up a little.

This stew is fantastically flavorful. We made it during a power outage so couldn't use a blender. Instead we chopped up the blender ingredients and let them simmer in the chicken stock for about an hour to break down further before adding them into the meat mixture. We also followed others' advice and charred the tomatillos and peppers on a grill before chopping. Next time we'll try with an uncut pork shoulder and let it stew all day in a slow cooker. Great meal!

I chose this recipient as it was made with pork and all natural ingredients. Of course, i messed with it.

I made this last night and it was great.  I left out the cayenne pepper and poblano pepper.  There was just the right amount of heat with two large jalapenos.  I roasted the tomatillos in the oven on a lined cookie sheet before blending to add more flavor.  I served it with rice to make it less of a soup along with sour cream, chips and salsa.

Everyone had seconds and thirds! So good. I added a can of white beans and a handful of shredded cheese to thicken it up a little. Doesn’t need it, but it was tasty. I will make this one again and again! It was my first time cooking with tomatillos. I did roast the peppers and tomatillo like others had suggested. Yum!

I didn't add jalapeño peppers or cilantro as my husband doesn't care for them, but it still had a wonderful flavor.  It makes a great fall or winter meal. Serve along with warm  flour tortillas.

I made it exactly as the recipe states except I did not add the potatoes. My family loved it and there was nothing left at the end of dinner. I am planning to make it for a party - it is that good. Don't be afraid of all of the peppers - not too much heat at all.

I thought this was delicious!  Unfortunately, my hubby doesn't like tomatillos...who knew??  Its a bit time consuming, but totally worth it.  I wonder if this could be made in the slow cooker?  Thanks Chef John!
