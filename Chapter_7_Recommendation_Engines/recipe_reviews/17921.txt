These are as close as I have ever found to the girl guide cookies - it is important to let the dough rest in the fridge for about half an hour before forming into balls. I added  more peppermint flavouring, and have come out with excellent results for the past several Christmases. Give this a try if you love chocolate and mint!

I'm sorry, but I have to agree with others that didn't care for this recipe.   I could not even mix it with the called for liquids, I added 3 T. of water to the recipe and another T. of oil, but I still had a sticky, gooey mess.  With flouring my fingers, I managed to roll the dough into balls.  I bake as directed and got a mediocre chocolate cookie that wasn't anything like the dark chocolate cookie in the Thin Mints.

This recipe was certainly NOT easy or wonderful!  It was a sticky, gooey mess!  I tried freezing the dough to make it easier to handle and that hardly helped.  I ended up flouring my hands as well.  The cookies tasted merely decent.  Tasted NOTHING like the Girl Scout Thin Mints.  Will NOT ever make these disasters again!

This recipe was incredibly simple to do, and the results were delectable. My husband, who does not like the Girl Scouts' Thin Mint cookies absolutely loved these cookies. I didn't have peppermint oil, just peppermint extract, but the results are great! My eldest and I love chocolate and mint, and we love these cookies. Thanks for the easy, great recipe.

I couldn't get these mixed up due to the lack of liquid ingredients.  What a mess!  I couldn't get my beater out of the bowl and the batter kept climbing up and around the beaters and all over the bottom of my mixer.  What a mess!
