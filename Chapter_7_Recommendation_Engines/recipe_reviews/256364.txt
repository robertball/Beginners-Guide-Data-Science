I made some slight changes, out of laziness. A bag of coleslaw mix instead of cabbage, canned black eyed peas (rinsed due to salt) and lemon juice out of a bottle. Turned out great!

I let this sit in the fridge for 2 hours and it helped the cabbage soften but still have a nice crunch. It is a very light salad with the soft flavor of lemon. Great salad to start off the new year being healthy!
