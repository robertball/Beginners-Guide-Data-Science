Meat was tender.   25 minutes on high pressure seems like a good amount of time.

Flavorful, cut with a fork ribs. I used an Instant Pot for 25 minutes and quick pressure release. For a quick and easy meal this one will work.

I rubbed it down with stonehill savory vegetable seasoning and let it sit in fridge for a hour before continuing with recipe. It turned out great!

I made this today using bone in pork spare ribs.  The rack was almost 3 pounds.  I cut it into 3 chunks to fit in my pressure cooker.  Used a whole vidalia onion.  Made the sauce as instructed.  Layered as instructed.  Plenty of sauce for the extra pound of meat.  Pressure cooked 25 minutes as instructed.  Meat was tender enough to eat but not fall off the bone tender like I expected.  Put back in and pressured another 5 minutes.  Much better.  The flavor is very good but when I make this again using ribs with bones I will increase the pressure time by 10 minutes (35 total) and hope for more tenderness.  Overall, pretty good for my first attempt and not having the type of ribs recommended.  Will make this again.

This is good and easy. I browned the meat on all sides first, and therefore 25 minutes in the pressure cooker might have been a tad too long. The onion was really good too.
