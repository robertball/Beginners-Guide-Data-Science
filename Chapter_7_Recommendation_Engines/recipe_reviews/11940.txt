Made this recipe and didn't really like it.  I found the sauce didn't stick to the pasta which is what I generally like to see happen.  I did add more bacon and more cheese.  Don't think I'll be making this one again.

We didn't really like the carrots and bell pepper in this recipe.  I am going to try it again using an onion and Velveeta.
