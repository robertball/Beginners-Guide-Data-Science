I frequently prepare fish with this method – because I love it.  And I frequently eat halibut, both out and preparing it myself – because I love it.  (Get your fresh halibut now! The new season has just begun!)  So I knew this recipe would be a sure thing, not likely to disappoint us.  And it didn’t.   It is a true gem and I know I will return to it often; not something I generally say about ANY recipe.  After drying the filets I rubbed them lightly with olive oil, then salted and peppered them.  I did not add salt to the topping, nor did I measure the olive oil, just added enough so the panko crumbs were lightly coated.  Duncan, you have outdone yourself.  This is a fresh tasting dish that allows the flavor of the beautiful halibut to shine.  No heavy seasonings, no heavy, rich sauce.  Excellent, especially served with a wild rice pilaf.

This recipe turned out great.  I used cod because that is what I had on hand.  I also used dry herbs because I did not have fresh herbs.  I will definitely make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly except for subbing green onions for the chives.  I was surprised at how mild the fresh dill is!  I've only used dried before.  We also liked the lemon zest in this.  The cooking directions are right on target!  My only suggestion would be to start with only half the salt and taste it for seasoning.  It was way too salty for us.  Thanks for a new variation of cooking halibut!

This was light and super moist--I think it's important to rub in some olive oil before the panko to keep it from drying out. I also broiled it for about 30 seconds right before serving for an extra cripsy topping. I just used dried herbs, whatever I had on hand, and eyeballed the measurements. It was delicious!

This was delicious!  I first peed the olive oil on the filets and seasoned them.  I used dried herbs and our was great.  Squeezed lemon juice overt the coated filets and poured some white wine in the baking dish.  Cooked for about 30 minutes and it came out perfect!  Seriously rivaled restaurant quality halibut I have had thanks!

I added parmesan cheese to the herb mixture and more olive oil than it called for.  I also smothered the halibut with olive oil first and a pat of butter then put the herb mixture on top.  I also put the fillets in a shallow pan filled with wine at the bottom. It was amazing!  Best halibut my family has had even in a restaurant.  Will make again!

Delicious.I did not have chives and that was fine.  I squeezed in a bit of fresh lemon juice.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Really good.

Everyone was very happy with the crusted herb topping. My Roommate said "this is better than a restaurant" For me, I like simple recipes and this one fits the bill. Plus I didn't want to risk ruining HALIBUT ... We were very pleased.

Made it with gluten-free bread crumbs and enjoyed it very much! Kids said they would eat it again, so I know it's a winner.

I didn't have any of the fresh herbs, so I substituted some dried ones, but it still turned out well for a first try. My husband liked it, which is a plus. Will definitely do it again, but use the fresh herbs. Had a thick piece of halibut, so I had to cook it 20 minutes, so cooking time could vary. Panko crumbs are key here.

This is a keeper. Pretty much stuck to the recipe with just a few tweaks. I used cilantro instead of parsley, and added some parmesan cheese to the mix.  

Very easy and tasty. Perfect weeknight meal.

This recipe was both easy and delicious.  I substituteed a lemon/citrus infused olive oil and cooked it on the gas grill. The panko topping was so flavorful. This will be new favorite at our house!

My family said best fish they have ever eaten. Loved the texture contrast of crunchy and smooth. My husband is usually the cook and asked me to forward it to him.

This was very good! I had to use all dried herbs and lemon juice instead of zest, because thats all I had and now I can't wait to try this with fresh. Yum This will be on rotation from now on. Thanks for posting.

This was simple but delicious!  I used tilapia instead of halibut but still turned out great. I didn’t have fresh dill so I used dried, but used fresh for the rest. I also added some olive oil and melted butter to the bread crumbs before I put on the fish so they adhered to the fish and stayed better. They also crisped up very nice with that addition. My 13 yo son rated it a 10, and coming from a fish lover, that is high praise!

This was delicious af. I only had dry herbs - dill, herbes-de-Provence and thyme. I did add shredded parmesan (1/2+ cup), powdered garlic, plus double the amount of olive oil to the mixture. First coated the fillets with EVOO and a little Tumeric for the health benefits. Misread the instructions and baked for 30 minutes but it came out nicely browned and was quite delicious.

I made this for our Easter dinner, and it was delicious! Make sure to season the fillets with salt and pepper before adding the herb/crumb topping. I served it with lemon wedges and a side of mayo, and everyone loved it. My fillets were pretty thick, so I ended up covering them with a piece of foil toward the end to avoid excessive browning on the panko crumbs. Definitely a keeper!

I used this recipe for Salmon and Halibut. Instead of just regular oil unused blood orange infused olive oil and lemon juice. It really brings out the flavor. 10/10!

I liked it, but it was nothing exceptional. Although it was extremely easy to prepare. Next time, I will probably use less salt and possibly some hot pepper flakes to make it a bit spicy.

A little to salty for me, I will admit we made the full recipe even though we only used three filets.  If made again I would probably use 1/2 the salt and more pepper

I have made this every year for Mother's Day. My family loves halibut and everyone loves this recipe. I make this recipe as written, without elaboration and it consistently impresses everyone I serve it to. 

I have to chuckle at those who say they made it "only used (insert other ingredients here)...but wouldn't make it again." That's so strange. If you don't try the recipe as written, don't write a crummy review!

I love this recipe, I must have made it at least 5 times in the last month!  The only change I made was to place the fish in a baking dish and then pour in enough white wine to cover the bottom of the pan.  Very tasty!

This was perfect as written! Didn't have fresh herbs so substituted for dry, can imagine it's even more delicious using fresh herbs!

This is a great recipe! I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter except I seasoned the halibut with pink sea salt & fresh black pepper Before topping them with the panko mixture then after adding the panko mixture I drizzled olive oil over all of the fillets. The halibut  was cooked perfectly! I love the fresh herbs especially the dill & lemon zest. In the future for a different flavors, I may add a thin coat of Dijon mustard before adding the panko mixture or squeeze fresh lemon juice over the halibut.

We liked this recipe very much, I have to work some on the panko crust though. I added a pat of butter to each piece and generously covered with the panko crust, however I had a had a difficult time getting it to stick to halibut. Even still, the panko crust flavor was delicious and did not take away from the halibut . Will try this recipe again.

Really really simple and the blend is spot on! Really nice. Only comment might be a tad less salt. My wife loved it as is, I thought it was a bit salty. But that is a nit picky comment - sooper good!

I used regular breadcrumbs (didn't have the panka) and substituted onion powder for the chives (didn't have any) Oh... and I skipped the lemon zest (you guessed it, didn't have any) but this recipe is so good it didn't matter :)

My husband has made this recipe twice-- once with the halibut, the other with rockfish (a type of cod). We substituted the regular olive oil for garlic olive oil. Both times, it was amazing! We did prefer the halibut (it has a milder fish flavor) but it was just as good with the rockfish. The garlic olive oil definitely made the dish and tied it all together. We served it with some fresh bread and lemon wedges.

My family didn't love it. I used fresh parsley as the sole herb, and they found it way too bland.

This was quite a good recipe I only changed one thing I  used halibut  And encrusted all of it with the breading halibut can dry out very quickly.

This recipe was excellent! All of the spices blended together perfectly. I kept my Halibut in the oven for an extra 10 minutes for a more well done fish, but changed nothing else. So delicious.

The teenage boys & the spouse love this and it is a great way to use the 200+ pounds of halibut we brought back from Alaska.  Grow the herbs easily in your garden.  I bake it 5-10 minutes more than the recipe says.  Maybe our halibut filets are extra thick.

This recipe was EASY, fast and tasty.  Might want to pre-season the fish before the crust goes on it.

Just caught fresh halibut in Alaska.  Used some for this recipe. Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit at my house.I did have a couple of fillets left over so the next day for lunch we made a fish sandwich (topped it with cheddar cheese and put it on a bun). Very very good! Thanks for a great recipe Duncan!
