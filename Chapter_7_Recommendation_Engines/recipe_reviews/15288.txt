I only needed 3 1/2Cups of flour after the first 6 cups.  Also, I would only use 1TBS. of salt; otherwise, this is a nice dense bread with a good taste...

I did not need as much flour as the recipe called for, however it was still delicous and fairly easy to make.

This was my first time ever making bread and I cannot say enough good things about it! It's yummy, rich, and substantial enough for sandwiches. I ended up using the 3.5 cups of flour to knead the dough and get it mixed in that way and it worked out perfectly. I also used one of the three portions of dough to make some hamburger rolls. Brush the top of dough with beaten egg for a pretty, shiny crust. SUPER EASY RECIPE!

amazing! only bread recipe I've tried where it doesn't turn out too heavy and it is easy for the kids to create their own creatures out of it and they keep their shape! Very moist, not hard at all!  Will keep this recipe for holidays and on cold days when you want some soul food!

This recipe took a lot of work (my arms are still throbbing) and I'm not sure it was worth it. The recipe was easy to follow and the bread was moist, but it didn't have much flavor. It was rather plain. I prefer a bread with a bit more taste. It did give me experience in bread making though.

This bread came out perfectly. It's exactly right. The only thing I did was use half and half (I had no milk) and I did an egg wash. Fluffy, light and a beautiful texture. Perfect sandwich bread. FANTASTIC with butter and jam!

Throw away all other sandwich bread recipes.....this is the best! I've made it a dozen times and the only change I've made is to add more water. Very easy, very forgiving and very easy to eat the whole loaf while standing at the counter with the butter dish !

The bread tastes great, but every single loaf had a crack down the side. I'm sure it's the fault of the baker, not the recipe.
