HELPFUL TIPS THAT WORK FOR ME: These never go wrong, but I find cookie recipes turn out different as far as thickness by the ingredients and temperatures you use them at.  They turn out SO MUCH BETTER when you use eggs AND butter that are at room temperature.  I always increase the vanilla, and you'll notice almost all other chocolate chip recipes on here have more as well because it tastes better! :)  I also blend half chocolate chip&half semisweet chocolate chips.  Makes a huge difference in the blend of flavors! MY SECRET: Add 1/8-1/4C andes mint chips in place of some of the cc, and everyone will beg for more!! Always hand mix recipes like this! No mixers or your cookie will be flat!  My husband likes to microwave the cookies a tad & then of course eat w/a glass of milk.  Now my son copies him. :)  Though this is the recipe I've turned to for years, when I tried "Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie" on here & followed the advice of some reviews ...I switched.  They found the secret to the biggest, chewiest cookie with the right mixture of sweetness!

I tried everything in the world to get these cookies to not spread.  Adding extra flour made them dry, combining crisco and butter didn't help and even baking chilled dough didn't make much difference.  Then...I saw an article in the Sunday paper about why I was having trouble.  This recipe was developed in the 1930s and flour was milled differently back then.  If you use a heavier bread flour and chill the dough for at least 24 hours you'll have the best cookies ever!  My husband raves about my chocolate chip cookies and so does everyone else who has them.  It'll be our little secret---ssshhhh!

I've tried many chocolate chip cookie recipes (especially from this website) and my favorite is still the one on the back of the chocolate chip bag!  This is the one I grew up with and the one that I love.

I do make one modification.  I use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening to keep them puffy.

I grew up near the Toll House in Whitman , MA and have Ruth Wakefield's original recipe. It calls for butter, not shortening as one reviewer said. This recipe is almost identical, but Mrs. Wakefield dissolved the soda in 1 tsp hot water. Also, the Toll House always chilled the dough overnight to prevent the cookies from spreading too much. This recipe is my favorite choc chip recipe.

NOT cool. These cookies have the worst presentation in the WORLD! SOOOOOOOOOOOOO flat!! I should have added more flour than the recipe called for. Maybe they wouldn't be so flat. The chips are elevated above the rest of the cookie. This is bad. I will NEVER make these again! Try "Best Chocolate Chip cookies" those are my all time FAVORITES! These are just not cool.

Flavor is ok, but I have gone back and tried these year after year thinking it just must be me, but these cookies are sooooooooo flat once they cool.  I quite using this recipe a couple of years ago because I got tired of wasting my time and ingredients.  If you like fluffy and chewy chocolate chip cookies - this is definitely NOT the recipe for you.  I am still in search of the perfect cc cookie recipe!

These cookies will always be the best!! I always make mine a LITTLE different.. I used 1 crisco butter flavored stick, 2 cups of flour and no nuts.. I cook at 350 degrees and always preheat the oven with the cookie sheet inside so you start off with a warm pan!!

Really good chocolate chip cookies- perfect with a glass of milk.
I did find however I needed to add about 2/3 cup of flour once everything was mixed in or it was too sticky. Really good once baked.

I have been using this recipe to make cookies for my family and my husband's family for Christmas for over 10 years. Everyone loves these cookies! The only problem I ever had was the cookies used to come out flat. I eliminated this problem by making the dough the night before and leaving it in the refrigerator. I also recently started using parchment paper on my aluminum baking pans instead of baking spray or butter. The cookies come out perfect now and cleaning the pans is a snap. Since parchment paper comes in rolls and tends to curl up it can be a little tricky getting that first batch on the paper (an extra set of hands is very helpful). Once the pan has been in the oven the paper flattens out and is very easy to work with.

For best results refrigerate the dough overnight.  Our local newspaper ran a story about the recipe and said that was one thing the lady who invented the recipe always did but it wasn't mentioned in the directions.  When you do refrigerate them, they come out really well.

I love this recipe when anyone else makes it, but when I make it the cookies come out cake-like and puffy rather than chewy.  I have tried adding more brown sugar and cutting back on the white sugar with no success.

These cookies are delicious but turn out flat if you use butter.  I used Smart Balance and they keep their shape, are better for you and taste great.  I also used egg whites instead of eggs.

Best cookie recipe EVER!  I've been making it for over 30 years!  If you tend to get flat cookies w this recipe, just add more flour.  I generally add about 1/2 cup more.  Let your butter sit at room temp but not for too long.  If your butter is too soft, your cookies won't be as thick and the texture changes (best to cream by hand, not with a mixer).

I always start with this recipe and make the following changes...my cookies always get lots of compliments. First, use half butter, half butter flavored crisco. Instead of nuts, I add 1/2C oats and increase the flour by 1/2C. This makes them sit up a lot better and adds some whole grain to them without anyone knowing!

This is a classic recipe.
I have found that the key to greatly improve this recipe is to add at least 1/2 cup more flour (or even more) at the end of mixing the dough so it's really stiff - before adding the chips and nuts.
Sounds counter-intuitive, but adding more flour makes for cookies that are not flat, and they stay deliciously soft and chewy over time.
Agree with other reviewers:  Use real butter and real vanilla.

My 13 year old daughter just made a batch of these.  She asked for the milk chocolate chips instead of the semi sweet because she thinks the semi sweet are bitter.   I have never had them with milk chocolate chips.  Boy are they good.  There are hardly any left.

My aunt used to make the original TH Cookies when I was a kid in the 1930's. She used redskin peanuts. I saw the recipe and decided to give it a try. I tricked the instructions up a bit. I added the baking soda to the creamed sugar and butter and beat until it was really creamy, then added the eggs, beat after each one, Added the flour last ,all at once and beat until the dough came together----perfect. The original recipe was formulated using the flour of the time which was mostly hard wheat, high gluten. The final beating using the flour of today requires more working to incorporate the liquid and develop whatever dough conditioner is in the flour. For those of you who have been getting a dry, flat and crumbly product, just beat the batter a bit longer.

This is the best easiest recipe.  Its not fussy on measurements, and the cookies come out fantastic.  Kind of cakey and soft, rather than hard or crunchy.  I wanted to follow another suggestion to use room temp butter, but I forgot to take it out, so I zapped it in the microwave for 15 seconds.  I used the stand mixer on the slowest setting and only until things were just incorporated, so I wouldn't over mix.  I also doubled the vanilla as another suggested.

I baked for 12 minutes, cooled for 1-2 minutes on baking sheet before moving to cooling rack.  Excellent.

People who have trouble with getting flat cookies may be over mixing the ingredients.  Try mixing by hand, or using an electric mixer very sparingly.

The recipe that comes w/butter flavored Crisco is much better - it produces a light, flaky, lumpy cookie that is beautiful and tasty.  These cookies (because of all the butter) will be flat and a little too brown around the edges.

These are edible, but they don't look as nice as those made w/butter flavored Crisco and they don't taste as good either.

Also - what's the point of posting a recipe that's been printed on every bag of Nestle's chips that was ever made?

This recipe on the Nestle Toll House bag used to have crisco, instead of butter.  The crisco makes a "less flat" cookie. Give it a try, you'll love 'em

I have fond memories of baking these cookies with my older sister when I was a little girl and now I’m making memories with my own kids using this same recipe.  This recipe has never failed and it’s the only one I’ll ever use for chocolate chip cookies.

I love these cookies! This is my go-to recipe for cookies. To make sure it doesn't go flat, first, make sure that you cream the butter when the butter is room temperature. If the butter is cold, it will not cream correctly and it will leave big butter chunks in your batter, which will melt and flatten your cookies during baking. If you notice that your batter is too sticky, put the batter in the fridge for about 15 minutes to firm up. The cookies will come out perfect every time.

This is a good recipe, but instead I used 1/2cup of crisco shortening and a 1/2 cup of butter instead of soda ,I used baking powder and cut back on each of the sugars by 1/4 cup. bake 9-11 minutes and cool on wax paper with 4or5 sheets of newspaper underneath the wax paper.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies were a bit too flat. I increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups the second time and they came out fluffier. I also use butter and eggs at room temperature. That seems to help. I like to use Guittard semi sweet chocolate chips to make these.

I've never have a problem with this recipe since I started WEIGHING the dry ingredients...AP flour, sugars and nuts.  There were a lot of comments about the cookies spreading TOO much.  This means you are using TOO much butter or too much white sugar.  There are sites online that show the various ingredient changes needed to make (1) Cakey, (2) Soft and Chewy or (3) Thin and Crispy versions of this cookie.  This Original Toll House recipe is slightly different from the three mentioned.  This recipe has equal amounts of white and brown sugar.  The final product is only as good as the ingredients you put into it.  Make sure your Toll House Morsels and nuts are fresh.  Thanks, All Recipes, for always giving both the US and Metric measurements.

I consistently only get 3 dozen cookies. I think these taste best when you use salted butter. Also, I often need to add 1/2-2/3 cup of flour to the dough before making the cookies. This cookie recipe wipes the floor with all the others.

I followed everything in this recipe except I took the suggestion of using crisco butter instead of regular butter. Everything turned out perfect! Tasted just like Nestlé  toll house cookies! No refrigeration needed. Made the dough and Baked it at 375 for 11mins. They didn't turn out flat at all!

These are a staple in my household! They never last long. I don't think I will ever try a different chocolate chip cookie recipe. One thing I do have to say is that I only used to use light brown sugar and the cookies seemed to turn out very flat. One day I switched to dark brown sugar and they seemed to come out thicker and fix the problem. Make sure to use dark brown sugar so you don't come across the same problem!

Great recipe! I thought the dough was a tad too loose with the initial 2 1/4 cups of flour, so I added in about another 1 cup and the cookies came out beautifully fluffy! Would recommend adding that extra flour. And 9 minutes of baking time seemed to do the trick. The amount of chocolate chips was perfect though. :)

This is probably my favorite cookie recipe of all time. I usually add 1/2 cup coconut and that make them nice and soft. I also take 3/4 cup oats and grind them. They make the cookies have a slightly chewy techture which I crave! I make them for my parents who always give me complements. I would recommend this recipe for any one who has never tried it. Yummmm!

I made this recipe with Splenda Sugar Blend (50% sugar, 50% Splenda), and SmartBalance 50/50 Butter Blend, to try to be a bit healthier, and they turned out great!  I was nervous, but really happy when they were done.

My family and I love these cookies! The only changes that i make are to use margarine in place of butter and I heat oven to 350 and bake the cookies for 14 minutes. It makes them a little softer and not so flat.

This is the recipe I have ALWAYS used when I want plain ol' chocolate chip cookies.  The only change I make is to cut back the butter to 3/4 cup, as the cookies tend to be too flat and crispy with a full cup of butter.  The biggest difference between this recipe and other chocolate chip cookie recipes (and the thing that makes it so good IMHO) is the fact that there are equal amounts of white and brown sugar.  Most other recipes call for more white sugar than brown sugar.

This really is the best cookie recipe.  I have used this for years and ALWAYS get rave reviews.  The ONLY thing I change about it is that I use a little more vanilla and salt and then I ALWAYS chill my dough for a few hours before I make the cookies. They are always SUPER soft that way and stay soft for WEEKS.  I sent some to my brother in the service in Iraq and he said when they arrive (two weeks later) they were STILL soft.  :-)

I made these with a few changes based on other reviewers ratings...to help decrease the flatness I added 1 tsp of baking powder (along with the 1 tsp of baking soda). Also, to keep them soft, the best trick is a large package of instant vanilla pudding (I use sugar free)and I've found that realllly keeps them soft for days...if they last that long! I just tried with 1/2 butterscotch 1/2 milk chocolate, but my husband and I agreed that all chocolate chips is really the best!! Make sure all your eggs and butter are all room temp, these turn out great every time! :)

The original Nestle recipe from the bag called for shortening, not butter. I always make my chocolate chip cookes with shortening. They turn out less flat. The cookie sheet makes a lot of difference. I prefer a flat aluminum sheet, not the layered sheets. I made these at Thanksgiving and had some leftover cranberries. Threw them in with the chips and nuts. Everyone raved over them. If you like cranberries, try it. My grandaughter said, "yuk" before she tried them. Afte she tried it, she said, "how come you didn't put them in all the cookies?"

I make this recipe often, but with a variation.  I change the sugar and brown  sugar both to 1/4 cup and add a box of instant vanilla to replace the rest of the sugar. Makes the cookies moist and chewy.

I loved it! These remind me so much of Otis Spunkmeyer  Cookies! If you make them without nuts, they turn out totally fine. I cooked them for 9 minutes and they turned out soft, (just the way I love them). You definitely NEED to make  them.

I would like to specify on what type of flour should be used. When Ruth graves Wakefield invented the chocolate chip cookie, she was actually in England at the time. She used a more local flour which was high in protein. Flour consists of two proteins glutenin and gliadin, these protein like to suck water, but butter greases up the flour causing the cookies to be crumble and flat! Which is why if I use more my local flour (USA) the cookies end up not spreading! I recommend to anyone else having this problem to either use unbleached or more of a bread flour!  

Next problem 

The cookies should be stored in the fridge overnight! In the original recipe Ruth stated how she always made the batter the night before! This is crucial!

When baking the smaller the ingredient used the better. Like it would be better to use small kernels of salt rather than big ones because big kernels will through off the balance of the cookie.

Also there is more time for the enzymes in the batter to help break down sugars. The smaller the sugar the better the browning!!!! 

Furthermore, overnight the cookie has more time for the proteins to soak up the liquid.
(excuse my grammar)

it took me a year to perfect this recipe and I would love to share how I did! My cookies do not spread and come out so delicious! People ask for the recipe all the time!  First, do not pack the brown sugar. You want the white and brown sugar to have the same amount. It helps them not to spread! Next, I use crisco shortening instead of butter. Add 3 tsp of vanilla. It's amazing! When you are mixing the dry ingredients in, do not over mix! Only mix until you can not see white. Stop once white is gone as you will be mixing the chocolate in as well! Also, I use mini chocolate chips. For some reason the regular sized always, ALWAYS cause my cookies to spread more. Last, I put my rolled cookie dough balls in the freezer for about two hours before baking. They bake so much better out of the freezer! I also only bake at 350. 
I promise if you follow these steps you will have people begging for your recipe!!!

This uses 1/4 of a cup more butter and an extra egg.  Cut the butter to 3/4 cup and down to one large egg.  For some reason they say this is the toll house recipe but it's not. This will make very flat cookies where the chips end up melting out.  It sucks, make sure if you are using a recipe to goto the source. Look at nestles website. A one pound Hershey's dark chocolate bar broken up works well when making a big cookie.

This is still my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe! I don't care for the nuts so I keep them out, however I will add some more chocolate chips to make up for it. I like a little extra vanilla as well. Happy baking!

I love this recipe! I usually make a double batch when sharing with others. My single batch also makes 60 cookies, though my double can only reach 100-110. I like to line the cookie sheet with parchment paper (Reynold's precut cookie sheet liners) to prevent the underside from getting scorched, (also, I usually set the temp at 360-370° instead of 375°. I find that a little undone cookie is better). I dump the cookies 5 down, 6 across on the sheets (using the pre-folded lines for guidance) so that 30 cookies can be made on a sheet. I like to use light brown sugar instead of dark, and I find that adding cinnamon sugar enhances and improves the flavor of the (already wonderful) cookie. The really important part to me is the parchment paper, though. It's very useful in not burning the treats!

Can't argue with a classic like this.  I always up the vanilla a tad.  Using parchment paper and a cookie dough scoop are pluses.

I haven't yet found a cookie recipe better than this! I always use this recipe whenever I'm in the mood for cookies. I wish they wouldn't come out so flat, but they are still yummy :)

I didn't have enough chips and I didn't have time to go to the store so I chopped up the ones I did have and they spread nicely throughout the batter. I think I just might do this every time from now on because they tasted wonderful!

These cookies are so good. I tried the "best chocolate chip cookie" recipe here and they turned out awful despite the 4.5 star recipe.  They are crispier and denser. I rested my dough for 18 hours to get better flavour and used more white sugar for a crispier and more spread out cookie. love these.

this recipe is great, my husband loves these cookies that i make them every week.  i even started handing them out to the doormen.  it is true that the cookies come out flat (my husband's preference), however they have a wonderful consistency and are very tasty.

Classic and yummy BUT I have recently discovered that the real secret to the best (5 star) chocolate chip cookies is to use high quality chocolate. I've actually started coarsely chunking semi-sweet baker's chocolate in lieu of chocolate chips. I like the large chunks that melt in your mouth and the little shavings that give the cookie itself a more chocolatey flavor. There are a variety of options you can use, but basically a higher quality chocolate will taste better and melt better than cheap chocolate chips.

There is a reason that this recipe has been around for so long.  They are wonderful and it wouldn't be Christmas without them.  They are the first cookie that I learned to make.  I sometimes make my own butter toffee ( 2 sticks Land O Lake butter, 1 cup sugar, and 1 tablespoon water. bring to 300 degrees and pour out into a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and let cool) I crunch it up and add.  The will spread a lot but I can never make enough and they have always been the first cookies to go at a cookie exchange.

Everyone always compliments me on my chocolate chip cookies.  When I tell them it's the recipe on the bag they don't believe me!  I've tried other recipes in the past, but have never found anything as good.  These really are the best chocolate chip cookies!

It is Friday night and my husband is having a get together with some old friends tomorrow and I planned to make these cookies for a treat and I am using a completely different recipe now!  These cookies are cakey and crispy but in a bad way.  You can barely tell they are chocolate chip cookies... NOT a  good cookie.

This is my "go-to" cookie, with one change. I add about 3/4 cup of quick cooking oats to the batter. This helps them keep their shape and makes them very crisp. They freeze well, if there are any left over.

We made these cookies for the neighborhood kids who helped us chop down our trees after Ike. They were delicious and a big hit; I didn't change a thing about the recipe. We'll definitely make these again and again. 

I think I made them a little larger than what the recipe called for. I had to bake them 12 minutes and didn't get nearly as many as the recipe stated, but they were delicious.

I did add a few more chips to my cookies.  When I store them, I  put a piece of bread under  the wax paper to keep them soft. I prefer soft and chewy to crisp cookies.  This works!

Preoven to 325-350 instead of 375 it will burn the bottom. Just leave it in oven longer or until golden brown

Recipe was easy to follow and delicious. I used a melon baller to make the cookies a consistent size. I can’t wait to make them again.

This recipe is on point! The cookies came out perfect. I made some soft and chewy and some crispy. OMG! Love,love,love. You can achieve chewy and crispy y how long you let them brown before removing them from oven. They will continue to cook once you remove them so if you want chewy remove when edges are brown and top is light brown. For crispy  when they are light brown just turn oven off if you are done baking. That's it. Enjoy and experiment to get what you want from this recipe.

Good recipe.  Classic.  I did make a couple changes on the second batch.  Used unsalted butter, seasalt, 1 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup granulated white sugar, 2tbsp more flour and doubled the vanilla.  I thought the second batch was better.  But either one was great.

For everyone saying their cookies come out flat, read on. I'll let you in on a couple secrets.

My great-grandmother's chocolate chip cookies were a family treasure. They were thick and soft and wonderful. She swore up and down that she followed the recipe on the bag and just added one secret ingredient. But every time we tried, they came out flat and chewy. It has taken me 17 years but I finally figured out how to make those perfect cookies.

Tip 1: Use a mixer and beat lots of air into your wet ingredients. Don't just mix until they come together, beat them on high speed until they look like frosting.

Tip 2: Pack your flour. We've all been taught to scoop the flour into the cup with a spoon, but when making other recipes of hers we've come to realize that she just stuck the measuring cup in the bag and scooped that way. It adds a little extra flour but not so much as to make them dry.

This works with pretty much any cookie recipe anytime you want thick, soft cookies. Try it, you won't be sorry.

Oh! And her extra secret ingredient? A pinch of nutmeg.

I’ve always had trouble keeping these from being flat. I’ve discovered it’s important to not soften butter (I use imperial butter because it’s soft to begin with and leave it out for maybe 10 mins), to cover and chill to dough for 30 mins before cooking, and add 1/8 c to 1/4 c extra flour for extra fluff. Hope this helps anyone having the same issue!

These cookies are close to the original.  The original Nestle Toll House Cookie recipe from the 70's (even tho the current package says "Original" on it) used 1 Cup of shortening, 1 Cup of granulated sugar and 1/2 Cup of brown sugar.  I made these cookies so many times, I can make the cookies without a recipe.  And I don't remember them ever being flat or spreading very much.

I followed the directions and double checked them, but the “go“ came out like better. I ended up dumping more flour in to get something that was somewhat don’t like, but the resulting cookies were weirdly fluffy and not good. I don’t know what happened.?

I've tried other recipes, this is my favorite & my families.
Butter is more expensive but you can get it on sale and stock up.  Use all butter, don't let it get too soft, I've even used it straight out of the fridge. Don't soften it in the microwave
Don't melt the butter either, there are recipes I've seen that melt the butter but that's not this recipe.
I read once somewhere that the butter becoming too soft causes them to flatten why I don't know, but when I follow the above they come out great.   I used to get so upset when mine would come out flat, but my family didn't care they still loved them!
I scoop them out right away onto my pans and start baking,  
Don't grease the pans!! Not necessary if you are using butter.  
Some changes I like to make, 
For the 3/4 cup white sugar I like to mix in some of the cane sugar, 1/2 cup white, 1/4 cup cane to me it makes it a little less sweet, I tried using all cane and it changed the texture.
I use unbleached white flour and for me.
I also like to mix up the chocolate chips, using mini & regular, sometimes after holiday if I have chocolate squares (dove dark!!) or bars I'll chop them up and mix with chips.  I don't like white or peanut butter chips, but if you do that would be fun to try.  Hope this might help someone!  :)

Wonderful. Used bread flour as suggested in a review and refrigerated the dough over night. I will use this recipe again for sure.

Great recipe,  since it's take directly from the package of the Nestle Toll House semi- sweet morsels. However, if you are opting for the Pan Cookie Variation, be sure to preheat the oven to only 350° not 375°. And yes, I agree that if you rated this lower than a 5, its not the recipe's fault. And it appears some do not know what a Toll House Cookie is or they wouldn't be surprised by its texture.

*TIP: USE BAKING POWDER! Baking Soda spreads your cookies to look thin and flat. Baking powder puffs the cookies to look thick and chewy!*
In love with these cookies! I use all brown sugar instead because it retains moisture resulting in a moist cookie. I add more vanilla extract because more is MORE (lol).
Bake exactly at 9mins regardless of the look because once they cool, you’ll have the perfect cookie texture that will last for days!
Happy baking! :)

This is the only recipe you should use for chocolate chip cookies. HINT: to improve cookie consistency, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup to the flour measurement.

Good cookie. Mine still flatten and I’m not sure why. I’ve used room temp eggs and butter, cold eggs and butter, put batter in frig to chill before making cookies, baked cookies unchilled. They still flatten...but they taste good.

A great basic recipe, but I'd suggest the following changes for thicker, store-bought-looking cookies:
Half the quantity of egg. 
Use 75%-80% of the sugar in this recipe, with a 2:3 ratio of white sugar: dark brown sugar. (Less sugar = less spreading)
For an even, gold color, 365  degrees F for about 12 min , but I'd set a timer for 9 and check for JUST when the middle gets golden (by then the sides of some cookies should start browning).
Everything room temp. You can do this by submerging an egg in lukewarm water for five minutes. But dry off the egg!
Hand mixing is better, but a stand mixer can be fine as long as you don't incorporate too much air. So medium setting for creaming butter and sugar, lowest for egg incorporation (and stop when it's goopy and slightly unincorporated so that the flour mixing will finish the job), and medium low for flour and choc chip additions. 
When you form the cookie, the scoop will incorporate air that'll give it that thick, broken appearance. If you form them with hands, you'll squeeze out the air and the cookie will be smooth and flatter. 
AFTER SCOOPING, freeze the dough for at least three hours, ideally overnight. Gluten will develop a bit. Flavors will mix/hydrate. 
Also I'd highly recommend buying cheap or expensive 70-80% dark chocolate bars to break apart on your own to decide the size of the chunk.

This is my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe. I use dark brown sugar and a gluten free flour called Cup 4 Cup so my daughter with Celiac disease can eat them. I just throw all the ingredients in my kitchen aid mixer to make the dough (no separating and mixing different ingredients.) Not only does it save time, but there is only 1 dirty bowl.I gently mix in the chocolate chips last. Always a favorite of everyone...no one can tell they are gluten free.

My family always brags about me making the best chocolate chip cookies in the world. There are two reasons why they’re the best and it has nothing to do with me. First, they’re not doing the work so they taste better and two, I use See’s chocolate morsels (the WHOLE bag!).

Great traditional cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the cookies did not spread much at all.  I did bake them on parchment- maybe it makes a difference.

We have a dairy allergy so I use butter flavor crisco and dairy free chocolate chips. I actually prefer them to using butter. They are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. People often ask for the recipe and are surprised that it is the classic toll house with butter flavor crisco. Yum!

Good basic recipe for chocolate cookies, but I fall back on the "true" original recipe devised by Ruth Wakefield of the Toll House Restaurant. She combined the baking soda with an equal measure of hot water and added it alternately with the flour. She also chilled the dough over night to enhance flavor. When ready to bake she used teaspoon sized balls of dough, rolled into balls and after placing them onto the cookie sheet flattened them slightly with the her fingers - to prevent spreading. She also removed the cookies to cooling racks right away. She stated the cookies should be "brown all the way through and crispy, not white and hard as she sometimes saw."

To reduce the amount of butter use 1 stick of butter, 1/4 cup flax seed meal, and 1/4 cup olive oil. We love these cookies, even without chocolate chips in them.  They turn out great in a mini muffin tin--I usually get 24 mini muffins plus 3 cookies.

I dunno what went wrong but these came out quite salty and the batter was really sticky.  Other than the salt they tasted ok but the texture wasn't chewy enough for my tastes and they kind of fell apart.

DONT LOOK AT ANY OTHER REVIEW AFTER MINE BECAUSE I TOOK ALL OF THE REVIEWS SUGGESTIONS AND MADE IT PERFECT! I love the original recipe but made small changes like I added 2 tsp of vanilla instead of I. Instead of baking at 375 I did 360 for 11 minutes instead so they wouldn't burn on bottom of cookie. I used a small cookie scoop and put on baking sheet but then slightly flattened it down on top to make it puffy after I formed it around the edges with my fingers. I did not use parchment paper, I sprayed lightly with pam so it wouldn't stick. Once the pan came out of oven I put it on cooling rack for the duration of the next batch I put in oven. I made some with walnuts and Ghirardelli morsels and also others were made with xtra semi sweet morsels alone. Im telling you there is nothing flat about these babies! They are sooo delicious, moist and tall.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever had. The first time I made them I used mini chocolate chips they went flat. This time I used regular size chocolate chips and they were perfect. I don’t know what else could have been different

Tip I learned a long time ago when my mother made these. You have to hand mix them if you want them to come out puffy and chewy. I had the issue with them being flat and realized I was using my stand mixer to make them and she always mixed them by hand. I tried a second batch mixing by hand and they came out perfect.

I have never had any luck with this recipe using butter and not being flat. Instead i use butter flavored crisco, and 1 egg. Also, I add a box of instant vanilla pudding and a heaping tsp baking soda to dry ingredients,  works every time !

These cookies are wonderful!  I made them with bread flour per other reviewers and they stayed nice and thick.  I also let the dough chill overnight.  The flavor is buttery and incredible.  I wish I could remember the reviewer's name who did research on bread flour - THANK YOU!!

Worst cookies ever. Followed recipe to a T   They cane out flatter than a pancake. My elevation is 3600 feet. Maybe they need more flour.

It's the classic you remember from your childhood. For a good bake, make sure that you use room temperature butter and eggs. Also, check the expiration date on your baking soda; fresh is best.  Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer until they lighten in color. Add the eggs slowly. Beat in the flour a bit at a time. Hand mix the chocolate and nuts into the batter. Use a small cooking scoop to get equally sized cookies.

I recommend doubling the amount of tablespoons per cookie. They looked pretty small when I put them on the paper, so I recommending doubling it. Otherwise, amazing cookies! :)

I don’t know if i did something wrong, but these were NOT RIGHT. something was very different than the ones my mom made for me as a kid. On another note, a really great add in is chopped up werthers chewy or soft caramels.

Did not make 4 dozen cookies. I don't bake often and when I do I want it to be worth while. It says this will make 4 dozen but it doesn't. I even used a cookie scoop and only got 2 and 1/2 dozen. Recipe is a normal chocolate chip cookie recipe nothing special, but not bad either. I give it points on being simple. I just wish it made what it said it would.

Very good recipe! I suggest putting them in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill, and spreading them 2 inches apart on greased, wax paper. I bake them for 10-15 minutes, but that may just be my oven. I also changed the temperature to 325 F, as I feel that allows it to cook more evenly. Hope this helps!

I substitued 1/2 c of shortening for part of the butter in this recipe, makes the cookies nice and soft days after baking. Tasted just like what grandma used to make. Can't keep them in my house, they get eaten in a matter of hours. Definitely have to dunk in a glass of milk.

I've made this recipe dozens of times and it's always a hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out perfect--crispy on the edge, soft in the middle and a bit flat as I don't like the thick doughy ones.  Other times they come out soft, soggy and tall. Butter and eggs at room temp. Don't over mix.  I even tried the high altitude recipe yesterday and that was the worst!  Any suggestions?

Love Toll House recipe. Always my go to. This time I just made it Vegan. I just used Enjoy Life Chocolate Chips instead of Toll House, Bob's Redmill Egg Replacement instead of eggs. Earth Balance Buttery Spread instead of butter. Delicious!

I found this exact same recipe from Nestle as a bar pan cookie. I baked it in my Pampered Chef Bar Pan at 375 degrees for 15 minutes. I like the cookie much better, plus it's much easier and less time consuming.  5 stars made as a bar cookie   11-12-2017 I made these exactly according to the recipe and agree with all the other reviews: the cookies are flat and not as good as other recipes out there.

Worst chocolate chip recipe!! My cookies turned out so Flat! I couldn’t even move them once they cooled without them breaking. I used real butter so maybe that’s why. But I will never use this recipe again, waste of my time and ingredients..

The cookies were pretty good. They were super fluffy though. It was like I was eating cake honestly. I was hoping for Nestle Tollhouse cookie copycats and these didn't really do it. Maybe I did something wrong in the recipe, I'm not sure. They tasted fine though.

This is the original Toll House recipe....so I am trying to figure out why some people not only rated this 1 star along  with horrible comments. My guess is that some people just live for being AS horrible as their own attitude. I lost my copy of Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookies and found it here....which I stated before, is the original Toll House recipe w/ the same amount of ingredients and steps. So please to all out there, do not let the negative comments stop you from making these. Who knows why they did, but this is the original Toll House recipe for which this person was kind enough to post up for people like me who lost the recipe.

Health nuts out there :) I hope I can post this ...guess I'll find out
Toll House has always been my favorite growing up. Well this is the first time I have made them in 4 years I've been following the Paleo lifestyle. 
In place of the white flour, I use Cassava Flour
In place of brown sugar, I used Coconut Sugar
In place of white sugar, I used Maple Sugar
In place of chocolate chips, I used Enjoy Life Chocolate Chips
I used Organic Pastured raisedEggs as well as Organic Walnuts and Grass Fed Butter. 
The one thing about Toll House is they have a tendency to spread on the cookie sheet.  These don't! 
You actually will have to press them down a bit with your fingers. 
I cooked them less time/lower temp as they will burn. I think because of the root flour and sugars I used. 
I cooked them 350 for 7 min using a tsp mellon ball scoop.
I THINK WE HAVE A WINNER! And yes, I can eat the cookie dough raw like the original. Amazing! I give it 5 stars just because it's healthier and the taste is SO close to the original :D

Use butter flavored Crisco. Makes a great cookie (and the cookie won't spread, still tastes buttery).  :-)

My family loves these cookies! I have had to make three batches in the last week. Twice I have subbed m&m's for chocolate chips, and they were and even bigger hit. I only cook mine for 7- 8 minutes so they stay nice and soft.

I think this is the recipe from the bag I have used for many years, it comes out perfect every time. For the person who had trouble with them spreading, I can only think of the normal things that makes this happen; not enough flour, too much fat or sugar, butter too soft or melted or the room too hot?

Been making them for years.  I use  Crisco butter sticks instead of butter.  It makes them more puffy and tastes better.

My favorite recipes to use, but I like to tweak a bit to taste. I always add a little extra brown sugar and vanilla to make a richer cookie, but my latest tweak is adding about 1/3-1/2 cup extra flour and chopping the walnuts extra fine. The cookies come out big and chewy with an old-fashioned taste.

This calls for  way too much sugar. I would only use 1/2 C light brown sugar and no white sugar. Then I'd love this cookie.  I never use anywhere near the amounts of sugar called for in most recipes.

This is the ONLY chocolate chip recipe I use. The original.  And I get rave reviews about my cookies. 

I cook them on a completely flat tin sheet and that gives me the the thin crispy texture I love as opposed to thick and cakey, which I don't like. 

Also, I prefer to use Nestle Milk Chocolate Chips instead of semi-sweet. They're super rich that way. 

Lastly, I have screwed these up in the past when I melted the butter in the microwave. It's best to use room temperature butter. When the butter is totally melted, the cookies spread too much and just don't come out right, in my experience. 

If you don't like thin and crispy like me, and want thicker cookies, chill the dough before cooking.

Love love love these cookies. I doubled the recipe, only got 84 cookies tho. I used a size 40 (?) Ice cream scoop. I will find a smaller scoop for next time. Family loves em. I did add 1 extra tsp of vanilla & sifted the flour. Seemed much easier to mix using a hand mixer

This is my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. Always a hit! Easy and quick to whip up as well as modify to keep things interesting. Most recent modification: added a slice of Mars Milky Way bar in the middle of each cookie. So gooey and delicious!

This is the classic chocolate chip cookie recipe.  Oh, and to the people saying they spread out too much -- the key is DON'T grease the pan (its there in the directions, use an ungreased baking sheet).  The cookies provide their own grease as they cook on an ungreased pan.  If you grease the pan, they just spread out flat.

No matter what you tell me about how you’ve added something and think it’s better, I still like this original recipe the best. I follow the recipe exactly and am never disappointed.

I found that using butter flavored Crisco sticks allows the cookies NOT to spread.  I don't use butter anymore.

I didn't care for these.  They fell apart in our hands. I think they were raw, but we cooked them for 9 seconds just like they told us to.

You can make these Gluten Free!!!! Just found out that I'm allergic to gluten and was soooo upset that I'd never have these cookies again but I just successfully made them! I used Better Batter All Purpose GF flour (I used 1/4 cup less flour but you could probably do a 1/1 ratio). Instead of butter I used shortening (I've always done this even before GF) and added a tsp of water. I didn't use nuts and cooked at 350 for 8 minutes. After you put the cookies on the tray FREEZE FOR 5 MINUTES BEFORE COOKING! I didn't do this the first time and the cookies spread out all over the tray but freezing makes the xanthium gum react in the flour and the cookies hold their shape. They are amazing!

My 11 years old  enjoys baking , she made them last night using just one stick of butter as she thought it was way too much of it (love how kids now a days watch what they eat!) , I just have one this morning with my coffe, let me tell you I"m impressed , perfect cookie...they are not flat , I really think cutting the butter helps with the thickness of the cookie. Enjoy!

When creaming the butter with brown sugar, I use an electric mixer to cream  and add eggs and vanilla extract last. Beat on med. speed until creamy.  I find that adding chopped pecans works better than walnuts. This hint is helpful for bakers with arthritic fingers.

Make sure your butter and eggs are at room temperature (and always use real butter) and chill overnight. I use a tablespoon of vanilla. This is the only recipe I ever use, and I have tried many others. This is the best cookie recipe!

The flavor of these cookies is heavenly. I will definitely make them again. Tonight was my first night making them and I followed the recipe exactly, or so I believe, but they spread out super flat. I'm not docking the recipe though, I've seen the pics of how they should look, and like I said the flavor is amazing. Just wish I knew what went wrong so I can correct the error.

This is without question my favorite cookie of all time. I like some walnuts in the recipe. Always hide about a dozen for yourself because they will be gone several minutes after they cool down but are still warm if you have anyone in the house. I prefer something less than crispy like a store bought cookie.

So easy, and family aproved. My son loves them, and my boyfriend that has always been an Oatmeal/Raisin cookie guy. It makes so much I fill a gallon ice cream tub to store them, and they will last for days. They stay moist without drying out. I think the only thing I did different was add an extra tsp of vanilla. This is my go to recipe for chocolate chip cookies.

I have tried a variety of different chocolate chip recipes and this one is my favorite by far. This is my go to chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I have tried several recipes and this one is my favorite by far. I follow the recipe  exactly as written and my cookies always turn out perfect. These cookies are so easy to make and they are just the right amount of sweetness.  They are amazing, especially right out of the oven. I have  refrigerated the leftover dough and they come out good too, but I think they are just a little better on the first day. Sometimes if I don't want to make too many cookies I just cut the recipe in half  which will yield  1 sheet of  12 perfect extra large cookies.

I'm never good with baking cookies but this recipe is so easy that I worry for nothing :)
I used margarine instead of butter and found out that it's somewhat salty for my taste. My suggestion would be if you used margarine it's better is you only used 1/2 or even 1/4 teaspoon of salt(don't know if I'm the only one who makes this mistake).

LOVE these cookies! My biggest concern is I think it calls for just a bit too much butter, but I haven't made them yet where I used slightly less. I tried them with milk chocolate chips-good, but not my favorite. Definitely need those semi-sweets.

These are a big hit at home. They're gone in maybe 48 hours, tops. I make them for potlucks at work and they're always the first things gone.

What can I say, I love this recipe. My Mom made these for us all the time growing up and it's the first cookie I ever learned to make. I'm 36 and still making them. I don't change anything except leave out the nuts and chill the dough for a couple of hours. When I don't chill it they tend to flatten out more than I prefer.

My kids and I were in a baking mood. We seen this recipe and decided to try it. The cookies tasted fantastic, but needed more flour, thus the 4 stars. After we added more flour, they looked and tasted great. Thanks for sharing!

These have been our absolute favorite chocolate chip cookies forever! If I ask my DH how many cookies to pack in his lunch he will say 'at least 8' and most often more than 8 due to his co-workers drooling over them.  I remember my mother baking these cookies for my brothers and me over 50 years ago.

These cookies were pretty good, i think i was all "cookied out" by  the time they were actually done being cooked.  

It makes many batches and the cookie dough is tasty itself!  It was fun to make with the kids. I deffinatly recommend this recipe to cookie lovers

I used slightly more flour than specified and they came out as poofy as cookies ought to. I made chunks out of a Baker's semi-sweet chocolate bar for the chips and this came out fine. I also used twice the vanilla. I've not tried it with the regular amount but these tasted great.

This was the second chocolate chip cookie recipe I tried from this site and this was by far THE BEST!!  Took the tip to let the butter & eggs get to room temp. & I think that made all the difference.  They spread perfectly, browned wonderfully & were just SUPERB!!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!  Will DEFINATELY make again!

I've been using this recipe since I was old enough to sit on the counter by the mixer.  Over the years I've made a couple changes that just make them pop.  Instead of vanilla, try almond extract.  And I use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.

THE BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE RECIPE EVER.  Make sure your eggs and BUTTER FLAVOR SHORTENING (instead of butter) are room temperature.  (I always put my eggs on top of the oven when I preheat it, it gets warm enough to warm them up but not to cook them!)Add extra vanilla (like, another tsp), and play around with the chocolate chips, I haven't found a bad combo yet!  I prefer 1 cup milk chocolate, 1 cup white chocolate and 1 cup chopped pecans.  Wow.

This is the way MY FAMILY LOVES their cookies.  I read some of the reviews where they say that the cookies are too flat, but I think those are the best kinds.  My family even perfers to have this WITHOUT the chocolate chips!  This is a great recipe!  Wouldn't change a thing.

I have tried to make these cookies twice and both times they turned out flat and cakey.  The chocolate chips sink to the bottom.  I use real sticks of butter and beat the ingredients with a hand mixer.  The dough turns out really creamy so I'm wondering if that's my problem.  I got the impression you were supposed to blend it with a mixer from the instructions though.  Big disappointment!

Do not melt butter and they will not turn out flat. take 1 cup of cold butter in coffee cup and stir it with a spoon then then put it in your mixture. turns out great

These cookies are superb! Is suggest refrigerating the batter while you wait for another batch to cook. It keeps the batter from melting and letting your cookies go flat.

This one was one of the first cookies I made by myself, without help. I think we all learn this one first, don't we?

Sometimes, I'll change it up and do 2 c. of flour and 1/4 c. of cocoa powder. 

This is also great if you freeze it in little balls and then stir it into Five Minute Ice Cream!

This really is the best ccc-recipe I've tried until now. I didn't have any nuts on hand and they still turned out great. Will be adding them the next time though (which will be very soon:-).

I followed this recipe to the tee and I still think it came out tasting like I added too much flour. Def not the best cc recipe. However, my husband said they were the greatest cookies he's ever had.
