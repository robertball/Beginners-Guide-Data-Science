Wondering if you couldn’t roll the dough into a log, chill really well,  then slice and bake.

These are phenomenal! So easy to make and they taste like something you’d pay a fortune for in a specialty shop. Perfect with wine for the adults, but my kids love them too!

Very good recipe! Quick and easy, there’s no need to rest in the fridge for an hour, it’s actually easier to roll the dough when it’s room temperature.

These were very easy to make, just as the video said. But they are the driest, most bland cookies I have ever had. They might be labeled a cracker instead of a cookie. If they had some sugar, nuts, chocolate chips, etc. mixed with them then they might be worth preparing.

Blame it on my having a major sweet tooth but these were very disappointing and dry. I was very skeptical considering the ingredients but my curiosity got the best of me. I also didn’t think they were easy since the dough is so crumbly and falling apart the whole time. I could only work with it by adding a little water on the second roll out. After tasting the first batch out of the oven, I decided to sprinkle sugar on the second one which helped a little. I will rescue them by putting a dollop of my homemade raspberry jam on them. I’m not including a picture because they look just like those in the recipe. I was wondering if the amount of cheese was wrong in the recipe? Maybe if it was cut in half but not interested enough to give it a second chance.

Make sure you roll them as thin as the recipe says to get a good crispy bite
I also used shredded asiago  since it was what I had
Very tasty

I agree about pairing this with a glass of wine.  I did find the dough a little tough to work with.  It was very dry and crumbly.  I sprayed it with water.  I also got 50 servings using a 2 inch cookie cutter.  I think I might put more butter in if I make it again.
