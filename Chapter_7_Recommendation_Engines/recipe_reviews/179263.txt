I am only giving this three stars, because it didn't turn out to have the texture that I was expecting, after reading the title of it.  Also, I found I needed a much larger than 2 quart dish.  I ended up putting it into 2 casserole dishes and before I filled the second one, I pureed it in the blender, but still did not come up with a 'pudding' consistency.  People were, however, impressed with the overall taste.

This recipe is superb! this recipe was a family favorite for the last 100 years. I continue to make it in memory of my beloved late mother who passed last year.
