My husband flipped over this...5 stars he yelled after the first sip.  I followed the recipe to the letter, using plain Greek yogurt.  I typically like vanilla yogurt, but the plain gave it a little more tang & really worked well.  However, I do think that the vanilla would work equally well.  Although the calories were more than I'd typically look for in a breakfast smoothie, the "1" serving indicated is VERY generous in this house, and it actually served two today.

Very good smoothie! I used Greek yogurt which gave it a nice tang. This was a good way to use the chocolate Ovaltine I had on hand in the warmer weather (usually have it hot with milk). It makes a lot - more like 2-3 servings for me. Could add vanilla protein powder, as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Delish!!! 
To make it more nutritionist, I added 1 tablespoon of flax seeds.
