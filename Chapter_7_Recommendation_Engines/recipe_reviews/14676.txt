The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as is.  It was good, but the meatballs were a bit dry and tough.  I tried it a second time, but added half a can of the soup to the meat mixture, and baked the meatballs 40 minutes at 400 and then drained off the fat, and topped it off with the sauce and baked another 20 more minutes.  The meatballs were very tender and my 11 month old son could eat them!

I definitely thought this was 5 star hit!!
I always like to prepare a recipe the first time exactly as it has been given. I prepared this recipe for dinner tonight and it was a hit, just as written and prepared. I enjoyed the fact that the ingredients required were things that are pretty much staple in the kitchen, nothing fancy, expensive, or hard to find. The ease of preparation and cooking were a *family friendly* combination that made this even more appealing. The ingredients combine to create an extremely tender, juicy meatball with wonderful flavor that is accentuated by the sauce. I loved how the worcestshire sauce zested up the tomatoe soup, it made a wonderful sauce.  The rice was perfectly done inside the meatballs. As the contributor suggested I served with hot rice. It was a family pleasing hit. My picky 18 month old loved the meatballs which was something..she doesn't care for beef very much. However, she loved these meatballs. My equally picky husband isn't much for anything different and even he loved these. I would strongly suggest that anyone try this. And of course, because everyone has individual tastes and preferences you may want to may some adjustments, but please give it a try just as it is first. Thanks Michelle for such a wonderful recipe. This will be a keeper for our family!

This was easy and tasted so good!  I made the meatballs all one size by putting the meat mixture on a cutting board and the cutting the meat into squares.  A great technique I learned from a friend.  I also baked the meatballs in the oven instead of browning tham, I find it much esier.

This recipe helped me with the porcupine meatballs my mama mada.  The only difference, I think is that Mama used tomato sauce as opposed to the tomato soup called for in this recipe.  It really does make a big and better difference.  I'd also encourage you to make extra sauce in which to cook the meatballs. You can NEVER have enough sauce !

These are so good.  My 17 month old daughter loved them and ate two meatballs.  The meat has a really soft texture that was great for her.  The sauce, while simple was really very taste.  I will make again for sure.  I do not buy instant rice and used about 1/2 cup of cooked long grain rice.

Nice, basic recipe for a beginning cook.  A quick, easy and satisfying supper that will appeal to a variety of taste buds.  4 stars as my son loved this recipe, however I found the meatballs to be dry and in need of extra seasonings, and the tomato soup mix to taste, well, like tomato soup.  Not sure how you can "jazz" it up, but definitely worth tinkering with.  Thank you for posting Michelle.

What a great recipe!  I cut back a little bit on the worcestershire sauce as suggested.  I also, after forming the meatballs baked them in a glass dish on 350 for about 20-25 minutes to save on time from pan-frying. It came out delicious!! Will definitely make again.  Thanks Michelle!!

This one is going into the rotation!  I made it with ground turkey, a little diced green pepper, reduced sodium/fat soup and instant brown rice.  I also tried baking it as some reviewers did. It took 35 minutes at 350 to cook thoroughly.  Served it with mashed potatoes.  Delicious!

After reading the reviews on this one I was skeptical. It seems like half cooked in the skillet, half went with the oven. Half had issues with the meatballs falling apart, half didn't. I couldn't make up my mind to use the skillet or the oven so I decided to do what I usually do with my meatballs...the crockpot! :) Here's what I did" The only change I made to the ingredients was I added and extra 1/4 cup of instant rice to make 1/2 cup (glad I did!). Everything else I kept the same. I first browned the meatballs in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes just like I do with my other recipe. Mine were pretty greasy so I was glad I did this otherwise the sauce would have ended up greasy, too. While the meatballs were in the oven, I poured the soups and Wor. sauce in the crockpot and mixed. I took the browned meatballs from the oven and gently placed them in the crockpot. I added just a couple of splashed of water to the sauce to make just a tad more to cover the meatballs. I cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours. Not a single one fell apart and they were deliciously moist and tender! I loved the sauce, very tangy. My husband said it reminded him of a BBQ-type sauce. My 6-year old devoured his!! I served with mashed potatoes on the side. A definite keeper, thanks for posting!

Thought these were quite tasty, made with hot rice. Next time I will try using Tomato sauce instead of Tomato soup as another reader suggested. I baked the meatballs in the oven for 30 minutes then transferred to deep skillet and added tomato soup mix, simmered for 20 min.

"Nummy Nummy!" Said my 18 month old after eating this treat! It came out great, I added garlic powder. Also I had a half of green, red and yellow pepper left over from a pasta salad I made so I tossed them in and they added great flavor and color! But nothing really needs to be changed. So easy to make! My mother used to make this when I was a child, but I don't remeber it being nearly as good. A real kid pleaser!

Haven't had these for years.  I thought this was an excellent version.  Kids liked them also. I used regular rice which I pre-cooked since I didn't have any instant. Will definitely make these again.

I used a splash of BBQ sauce instead of Worchestashire sauce and they turned out great.  I also added 1 cup of rice to the meat mixture because my family likes rice and the meat still formed nice balls that stuck together.  Yummy!

My husband and his coworkers were feeling the winter doldrums so I decided to send a double batch of these delicious meatballs to work to celebrate Groundhog Day. I figured these porcupines would make a nice substitute for groundhogs. LOL ;)  These were served with brown rice and some toasted French bread, and this dish was a HUGE hit.  The only problem is that the folks at work have already told me in no uncertain terms that they expect "groundhogs" again next year. LOL =)

I grew up on these. Only thing different is I put uncooked meatballs with sauce in a large casserole dish and bake at 350 for 1 hour.  Serve over mashed potatoes.  YUM!

I love these things.  I grew up eating them once a month in the 70s.  I had to precook regular rice also, as I do not have minute rice in the house.  I believe you must use tomato soup, not tomato sauce.  Mom always used Campbells' which was perfect with the Worcestershire (I used 2 T) and meatballs.  I used homemade tomato soup i froze in august and it was very good.  
I did bake the meatballs as they looked pretty tender. even though i added 3 T of bread crumbs.  A great dish with fried canned potatoes.  A real ride down memory lane.

I was searching for an old family recipe, my mom made these in a pressure cooker. I  couldn't find her recipe, but I found this one!!! The tasted just like hers! Her recipe was from the 1930's, thankful that I found this one. we have always served these with mashed pototes and salad. The "tomato gravy" is delicious on top of the mashed potatoes! Again, thank you!

I modified this recipe based on the other reviews and was very happy with the results. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, doubled the rice, used garlic salt instead of onion salt, cut the Worcestershire sauce in half, and added about 1/4 c. of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs so they would form into balls. Yum! These were zesty and flavorful and I will definitely make them again. This is the porcupine recipe I was looking for!

Tweaked the sauce recipe, substituted 57 Sauce with the worcestershire sauce.  Didn't use the whole amount, just a dash and a bit of vinegar, but it turned out great!!  Also baked it, as I couldn't cook ALL the meatballs at once in a pan.  Was fantastic, not a single leftover!!  Great recipe!!

This was pretty good but my meatballs did not stick together....halfway through cooking I ended up crushing the remaining meatballs that did not stick together and made a hash....served this over rice and it did taste like the inside of a cabbage roll.  I'll make again but probably won't make the regular rotation.  Next time I'll add breadcrumbs to the meatballs.

I remember having these growing up and I still love them now.  I actually make the meatballs and then put them in my slow cooker.  I pour the sauce over and let them cook on low for about 7-8 hours.  They are moist and flavorful.  I serve over brown rice with a side of broccoli.

My family loves porcupine meatballs. I made this recipe last night and they were the best ever. This is definately my new porcupine meatball recipe. My family likes more rice so I did use 3/4 cup rice. Also, I never brown my meatballs first...just put them in a dutch oven, pour the sauce over them,  cover, and bake at 350 for about 45 minutes. I use extra lean ground beef so I don't have to worry about grease in my sauce. Thanks for a great new variation on a family favorite.

Good recipe for basic meatballs that can be used in many different ways. Also, a good way to use left-over or take-out rice. I choose not cook them in the tomato soup because I am going to freeze them to pull out when I need a quick meal. A tip for those who are in a hurry and need to speed up/ease the cooking process is, boil water in a large sauce pan. Add your shaped meatballs (you decide the size) to the boiling water and wait till they rise to the top (about 5 minutes) then cook another 5 minutes or so in the sauce of your choice or until internal temp is around 165-170 degrees.

Saucy - perhaps even a bit too saucy (there was lots of sauce left-over) due to the recipe using 2 cans of soup, when all other porcupine meatball recipes call for only 1 can.  I will return to Better Homes & Gardens classic porcupine meatball recipe.

Delicious.  Both toddlers ate with gusto compared to their normal pickyness.  Definitely added to the week rotation.

the flavor was good but our meatballs totally feel apart. Needs some bread crumbs or something to hold together.

Yum. Just like mom used to make.  I added half a can of soup to the meatballs to make them nice and tender and a bit of extra rice to soak that up. I also wanted more sauce so I used the other one and half cans of soup and added a can of tomato sauce.  A few extra shakes of Worcestershire and some hot sauce and it was great.

Followed recipe I really liked it had a little bit of a zip to it. My family  did not care for it. Its all personal taste. Next time made meatballs 2 cups of tomato juice mixed with 1T of cornstarch and baked. Everyone liked that better.

I also added some garlic and green pepper and fry up with onion until translucent since I don't like crunchy onions. I use an extra can of soup so I can add more to the meatballs too. And I pre-cooked the rice (and added a little more) as the first time I made  the rice was still a little hard in some of them.  With some modifications to personal taste they're delicious!!

This was overall a great recipe. However, The first time I made them, I found the suggested size of the meatballs a little too big, meaning that the centre of the meatball was a bit bland. The second time I made them I added a clove of garlic and a teaspoon of oregano to the meat mix, and added a little bit of home dried chilli to the sauce to give it a bit of a boost. The chilli's I used are one's I grew myself and dried myself, so they are not overly hot, but gave the sauce just a little bit of a pick me up. Will definately make again using a smaller meatball.

Very good. I added crushed garlic since we all love garlic with beef. I will add more rice next time. I wondered why others served them with rice or noodles. No complaints, though. These are delicious. I don't think other recipes I have used in the past had Worcestershire sauce and that's what puts this over the top. Thank you!

Made them last night.  I really, truly wanted to follow the recipe exactly, but it was Italian night, sooo - I used a jar (gasp!!) of good-quality spaghetti sauce instead of the soup, and threw in about 1 1/2 tsp. of mixed Italian seasoning.  After sauteing the meatballs I put them into the simmering sauce and finished them there.  Turned out great, and a bit spicy, too.  Oh, no need to use "instant" rice - there is enough cooking and simmering time to cook regular long grain rice all the way.  In fact, I think instant rice might become soggy with this long-ish cooking time.  Meatballs were a bit soft and kinda fell apart in cooking.  I don't know how to fix this

This was not a porcupine meatball.  Browning the meatball forms a crust so when they cook the rice can't poke out.  the sauce was ok, but I think I will stick to my old recipe

Great home-style recipe. We made the following changes: 1/4 cup cream instead of an egg in the meatballs, 1/2 cup instant rice, added 1 can water to the tomato sauce and only 1 1/2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce.

I know some reviewers said it was bland, but not after I was finished! Holy Moly! I bought super lean ground beef.  (There was no fat whatsoever when I pan fried them).  I added finely chopped mushroons, red onion, carrots and garlic (all precooked.  Very lean meat needs the addition of vegetables to keep it moist).  I only added 2 T W sauce and 2 T brown sugar to the meat, plus 1/8 c Italian bread crumbs.  I added generous Italian seasoning, a little bit of Emeril's, 1/2 c cooked rice and a small amt of black pepper.  I omitted the parsley and onion salt.  I shaped them in 1/8c amounts and fried in a pan with Pam to brown and carefully turned them over w a spatula.  I then put into a baking dish with the rest of the soup, plus 1 T each W and brown sugar.  Covered and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  Outstanding!  Served with rice.

When I made this recipe I decided to make it slightly healthier by adding finely chopped carrots and celery to the meatballs--this did not affect the flavor nor the appearance- my family did not even know.  I added a dash of salt, figuring there is plenty of salt in the tomato soup & worcestershire sauce.  I served the porcupine meatballs over Quinoa, which is healthy & tasted really good with this dish--in fact, my finicky husband liked it better than when I make it over rice.  The last change I made was to put the formed meatballs in my casserole dish, cover them with the soup/sauce mix, & bake them in a 350 degree F oven for 45 minutes covered & then I uncovered them & baked for 15 more minutes. This way, no browning was required & it simplified the preparation!!  They were so tasty--my entire family went back for seconds--definitely a family favorite!

Growing up in the 70's/early 80's, this dinner brought me down memory lane. A quick scan of the ingredients told me I'd need to spruce up the seasonings in the dish, which is always an easy fix for those of us who like spices. I "spiced up" both the hamburger mixture as well as the soup mixture with eyeballed amounts of onion/garlic powders, black pepper, and Lawry's (in the hamburger mix only), as well as 1/4 c breadcrumbs. I subbed out an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce since I only had 1 can of tomato soup (I used Campbell's Tomato Bisque), but I'd prefer using only the tomato soup next time. I also used the entire 1/4 c of worchestershire since I love it, and added a few pinches of brown sugar to my tomato mixture. Served over white rice, along with a quick green pepper & onion stir-fry. A tad more time-consuming than I'd like for a busy weeknight, but a delicious change-up for weekend meals. Thanks for the throwback meal memories!

This made for a great weeknight dinner that everyone enjoyed. I used tomato sauce rather than soup, leftover rice rather than instant, and added a little mustard to the meat and sauce. I served these with extra rice, garlic bread and green beans. Hubby made the suggestion to try them with a BBQ style sauce next time, so we'll see how that goes. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellente!  I made them *almost* exactly as the recipe showed.  But I didn't have onion salt, only onion powder, so I added some onion powder and about 1/2 tsp. garlic salt.  I also used dried parsley.  I'll definitely make again!  Will probably bake them next time, then transfer to a pan to simmer.  I made a double batch and it was quite tricky turning them to brown on all sides...but the end result was wonderful.  I served over white rice.  The sauce, as simple as it was, was a nice tangy zip.

We didn't really care for the sauce. I would rather just stuff these into green peppers or roll with cabbage. Probably won't make it again. Rather blah.

Loved the meatballs. Big hit with the entire family. wasn't sure if I was crazy about the sauce, everyone else but me liked it. I think next time I will try tomato sauce instead of soup or maybe cut back on the Worcestershire sauce. but the meatballs are fantastic!

Easy and delicious!  I chose this recipe because I was looking for something budget friendly, but not the same old stuff we always have.  The addition of the worcestershire sauce to the tomato soup really adds alot to the meal.  Don't skimp on it!  Served it over rice and with some crusty bread.  It was a hit with the whole family.

Per advice of scoutweese, added 1/2 can of the soup to meat and baked at 400 - almost 40 minutes, which was too long.  By then, they were charred.  Added 2 cans petite diced tomatoes for more sauce to serve on noodles.  Pretty good, but too much Worchestershire even for me.

I followed the recipe exactly and the meatballs just fell apart.  They need some more binder, maybe bread crumbs.  I have made porcupines for years but will never use this recipe again.

Yum. I use ground turkey, about a half pound, and double the rice to make them more porcupiney. I use regular short grain rice cooked less time with less water (about 1 part to 1 part). I bake in a glass 9x13 pan at 400 for 20-25 min than add the sauce mixture and cook another 10-15 min.  Delish. Sometimes I sneak finely grated carrot into the meatball mixture or some v8 instead of soup.

This was a great recipe thank you!!! Used it as more of a base and then built off of it. I made them for my boyfriend, he doesnt care for tomoato sauces so I subbed that for cream of mushroom soup. I followed the recipe added a 2 tbsp of bread crumbs to the mix and 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix instead of the onion. I also used cold cooked rice, and then rolled and browned. Had no problems with them falling apart. I added the 1 1/2 cans of soup and 1 can of water. Simmered for 20 min, they came out PERFECT!!! thank you... This is now in out rotation.

my family enjoyed this recipe. I did, like other reviewers use more soup. I also added garlic, more pepper, chili powder and some italian seasoning. It was really good and I had all of the ingredients in the pantry.

My mom used to make porcupine meatballs when I was little, but I could swear the sauce was creamy, not tomato-based. These are good - lots of flavor, and my kids really liked it served over couscous (added a bit of the parsley and the onion salt to the cooking liquid).

I was going to make this with one can of tomato sauce and one of soup, but because I'm a goober and forgot to hit the soup aisle I used one can of seasoned tomato sauce for meatloaf (yes, it's actually called that - a Hunt's product, I think) that I had kicking around the back of the pantry for who-knows-how-long instead. It did have a meatloaf-y hint to it, but it was very tasty and very homey. This would be great comfort food on a chilly evening, but we enjoyed it just fine on a warm Texas night, too!
Be sure to really finely chop your onions  because even 1/4" dice looks huge when the meatballs are barely over an inch! Next time I'll get the Pampered Chef handy-chopper out and just go to town on that little chunk of onion! Oh, and be very generous with the tomato-whatever - I used the seasoned sauce - in the egg. That's the flavor on the inside of the meatball, and more is better (as long as they still actually hold together, that is)!

Excellent recipe, and SO easy to prepare!
I followed the instructions for the most part, only changing one thing.  I used 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of tomato sauce.  The blend was perfect, and the flavor was excellent.  I also browned the meatballs in a skillet, and then baked them in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes, covered with foil. *Perfect*
We complimented the meal with 5 cheese texas toast and fresh green beans.  
This is definitely one to save!

For me these were great tasting.  All three of my picky children enjoyed them, so for sure will make this again.  The only problem I ran into was they were literally falling apart on me.  I think next time I will add a little bread crumbs.  Other than that, I precooked my rice since I didn't have any instant rice, and most time when I add uncooked rice it never cooks to the consistancy that we like.  I still added it in as the recipe said, and it was wonderful!  Thanks for this keeper

This recipe is great! The zesty sauce is so good that I often use 3 cans of tomato soup just so we have extra. I also use a full cup of cooked rice in the meatballs.

I thought these were good.  My fiance said "They taste like meatballs."  I did think they should've been porcupine-ier.  I made a few minor changes -- 1 T dried onion flakes for the onion, 1 t dried parsley for the fresh, and garlic salt instead of onion salt.  Could increase the ratio of meatballs to sauce by about 50% -- it makes a lot more sauce than we needed.

I made this with ground lamb - added some minced garlic and dried rosemary to the mixture.  I didn't have condensed tomato soup, but used regular tomato soup and mixed it with a small can of Hunt's garlic, oregano, basil tomato sauce and added some minced garlic and red wine to the sauce as well.  Served it with mashed taters and greenie beanies - Hubby loved it and said it was a keeper!!

I was unable to find my Mom's recipe for porcupine meatballs so I decided to try something different and I can't say it was all that wonderful.  I followed the recipe as written (although I only used 2 Tbsp Worcestershire since I'm not a fan). They started to fall apart immediately, I wasn't even able to get to the pan with them.  As a result I wound up making a sauce rather than meatballs and I served it over pasta.
The taste was nothing spectacular but not the worst either.  It actually reminded me of when my mom would brown some hamburger, add some onion and celery, and add a couple cans of Spaghetti-O's to throw together a very quick dinner. 
I did look around and found Mom's recipe which is the one I'll use going forward.  Mom's recipe uses slightly more rice, some additional liquid in the meatball mix, and holds together much better with a more flavorful sauce.

Easy, budget friendly, and kid friendly.  The meatballs are good, but the sauce is kind of boring for adults.  I'm glad I didn't make this on a night when my husband was home.  The kids loved it, zero complaints from these picky eaters.  I followed the advice of baking the meatballs.

I don't usually like to change recipes, but based on my experience of eating porcupine balls growing up, coupled with many suggestions from reviewers, I had to change from the tomato soup to spaghetti sauce.  I also added 2 eggs, instead of 1 and 1/2 cup bread crumbs, to help the meatballs stay together - this worked very well.  I used 1 1/2 cups of lean ground beef, mixed all ingredients together, including 1/4 cup of spaghetti sauce in the meatball mixture.  I didn't have instant rice on hand, so I used 1/2 c cooked brown rice.   I put the meatballs in a glass pan and covered them with Prego spaghetti sauce & sliced green peppers.  Then, going on the advise of many reviewers here, I baked this in the oven at 350 degrees in a glass pan, covered witih foil for 30 min., then removed foil, cooked additional 30 min.  Meatballs stayed together and turned out perfect!  I haven't had porcupine balls in so long - thanks for the idea, it was such a treat!

I make mine using ground pork instead of ground beef, and I just use salt, pepper,onions,minced garlic,regular rice and I use three cans of soup,(has to be Campbell soup tastes so much better!) I usually water down the soup a little. I brown my meat balls first and then add the soup and bake for about an hour at 375C

This is a great recipe.  It is the insides of stuffed cabbage or stuffed peppers. My husband doesn't like peppers and the kids do not like cabbage so this recipe is perfect for the meat only that everyone agrees on.  Thanks!

This was very tasty, the whole family loved it.  The only addition for next time is about a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to bind the meatballs a little more.

I have been eating these since I was a kid. The only thing is that I don't add worcestershire sauce to the gravy and I serve it over mashed potatoes...DELISH!

This recipe was good and child friendly. Only problem we had was there was not enough sauce.  **My initial changes were to substitute 2 lbs of grnd turkey, to double the rest of the recipe, use garlic salt instead of onion salt, and added an additional 1/4c instant rice-grnd turkey is more wet. **Next changes were to add another can of soup and a medium size can of diced green chilis-they make everything good. **Next because my toddler has an aversion to vegetables I added 1/2c finely shredded carrots, 1/2c finely shredded Parm-Regg, used 50oz of Prego Original Italian sauce (was out of soup) and about 1/4c prepared alfredo sauce-very good. TIP: I used a #16 (2.25" wide) ice scream scoop-much easier to form consistently sized meatballs.  Hope this helps. Enjoy the original or the modifications.

I think this recipe is just a really good fill-you-up meal all in itself.   I think it could have used more zip and I'll add some ketchup and brown sugar to the sauce next time just to give it a little more kick. I did not make enough sauce even though I made extra.  I will definitely make more sauce next time.

This recipe was just ok for my family.  We thought the meatballs were pretty good, but, the sauce had a little too much "tang" - it was a strange aftertaste.   Probably won't make this again.

The meatballs themselves were great, but I much prefer to use tomato sauce + seasonings or pre-mixed spaghetti sauce rather than the tomato soup for this.

Very good!! My whole family enjoyed it & all had seconds. I doubled the recipe for my family of 6 and tripled the sauce. On the suggestion of another reviewer, I added extra soup to the meat mixture. Baked in oven at 420 for 15 mins, drained fat, then added sauce & baked again for 10 mins. Served over rice. Next time around, I may add extra instant rice, as they weren't very 'porcupine-y'.

This recipe was easy and also tasted pretty good.  I did not cook my meatballs in the stove.  I made up the meatballs with the egg,seasonings, rice (1 cup), and 1/2 the Worcestershire and baked them on a cookie sheet for 20 min on 350.  I then soaked the grease off them with a paper towel and transferred them to an 8x8 casserole dish and put 1 can of tomato soup, 1 can of tomato sauce, and the remaining worcestershire over them and cooked them for 40 more minutes.  I served them with mashed potatoes.  They were okay.  I will be making these again... just not once a week.

I have made this 2 different ways. First was with the canned tomato soup. The second was with tomato sauce and it was so much better in my opinion. I doubled the instant rice and my meatballs stayed together nicely in the skillet. I added garlic powder, italian seasoning, and more salt and pepper than called for. I served this over rice, with broccoli and corn. I definately recommend making more sauce than the recipe calls for. All in all, a very good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I didn't use chopped onions, I just added extra onion powder, seasoning salt, and 1 cup of cooked longgrain rice (I don't use instant).  I also took the suggestion of adding some bread crumbs, I just dumped some in, I didn't measure them.  I would probably add some more breadcrumbs however, becasue the meatballs were very soft, and when I went to stir the meatballs and sauce, the started to fall apart a little.  I baked my meatballs as well.  The meatballs were very tender, and I thought the sauce was wonderful.  I didn't measure my Worscher. sauce, I just "eyeballed" it.  Served with rice. Made a very "kid-friendly" meal. Definately a keeper.

I've made these twice in the past 10 days! I doubled the recipe and made a few changes on the second try. The only changes I made were to double the rice, add 1/3 can of water to the sauce, and put in a handfull of oatmeal. It really did help them hold together better. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I thought these were just o.k. Instead of pan frying I baked them in the oven, this way they will not fall apart. I think two cans of the tomato soup was a bit much. Sorry, but we didn't much care for this recipe. May make again but with some changes.

We thought this was pretty good.  I made twice and want to warn that if you turn the meatballs too soon or too roughly you end up with a pan of ground casserole instead of meatballs. The second time I made, I cooked at a slower/lower temperature and did not turn until almost totally cooked. In other words, I let the meatballs SLOW STEAM to cook. I also added another 1/4 cup of rice to soak up some of the liquid. This way there was no sauce but, we had a rice side dish to the meatballs that tasted great! Adding green beans as a side dish, you have a pretty quick meal. Oh, I also used brown rice (not instant)instead of white, to make it HEALTHIER (white rice, canned sugary tomato soup and ground red meat is not exactly the healthiest of ingrediets).  It also added a little more flavor to it and my family didn't even know it was brown rice. Will make again, but will use brown rice. Thank you, for the recipe.

Fantastic flavor.....reminded me of my mom's porcupines, although mine fell apart as I was cooking them, so I had more of a porcupine casserole thing rather than meatballs....I think that was my fault however, and not because of anything in the recipe, so I will be making these again.

My husband and I thought these were really good.  My 5 year old wouldn't touch them, but she doesn't like anything anyways so I wasn't suprised.  I also baked the meatballs and I agree with others that it is much easier than frying them.  Served them with stuffing and green beans.

The first time I made these, the meatballs were a little dry, though very good.  Since I like spicy, the next time I made them, I used one can of tomato soup and one can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilis.  I also used a little of the Rotel liquid to moisten up the meatballs.

My husband loved the meatballs in this recipe, but not the sauce. I found the meatballs to be fantastic, but didn't like the sauce too well. Try adding garlic and rosemary to the meatballs and serving them in a tomato sauce over spaghetti instead of rice.

Woah, way too much worcestershire sauce for our taste. DH didn't like the combination of tomato soup and worcestershire sauce. I didn't think it was too bad but the WS was just way too overpowering. The meatballs themselves had great flavor, perhaps with a little tinkering this will be a keeper...I think next time I'll cut the WS for sure...maybe a few teaspoons or so but not 1/4 c.

Meat balls fell apart at first. Made them smaller than suggested and cooked them in the oven rather than on the stove. Next time I would also try browning them in the oven. Too much time to brown them in a pan. (I was making a triple batch.)

Only change was had no fresh parsley, so that didn't go in.  I accidentally scooped out a little too much soup to mix with the beaten egg, but that made the meatballs nice and soft and tender.  Used the recommended measure of Worcestershire Sauce, browned as directed, then simmered for about 20 minutes or so on low...they were the BEST EVAH! Fro years I've been making them with way too much rice, and not enough soup, they always came out like rocks..these are soft and sorta fall aparty...but soooo good.

Great recipe.  I used the full amount of Worcestershire Sauce, and added a couple of shakes of hot pepper sauce to the meat mixture.  I used regular rice, browned the meatballs and put everything in the slow cooker.  Meatballs were very moist and the rice was done.  The only thing I would do differently would be to add a can of water to my soup mixture.  Because I used a  slow cooker, my sauce was too thick (though very tasty).

Having grown up on tomato based porcupine meatballs, as well as the mushroom soup variety, I was excited to find a recipe that brought back a childhood staple.  This was a great recipe.  Used tomato sauce instead of soup as that's what I had and added garlic powder out of habit when it comes to ground beef. This was a big hit with my husband too.

this is so similar to my mom's recipe that i can attest that it does work. she never used the seasoning (parsley and onion powder, altho i do sometimes). she always used 1 can of soup, which was always too little, i always doubled it. never used the worchester, because it causes hubby indigestion.  mom's was always done ontop of a double boiler and she cursed that recipe, cause she'd be slaving over the stove for 45 mins and the  thigns wouldn't cook. then i came across recipes that browned them in the skillet, like this one.  which worked great, but i always had an issue with them sticking to the skillet and falling apart..then i discovered putting them in the oven..*lightbulb goes off*.  so i stick em in 400 degreese on a silicone baking mat, they brown perfectly.  u can either then throw them in the sauce and simmer, or let them cook thru, add em to sauce, and freeze or save for later. will only take mins while your cooking the spaghetti to heat ;)  I also don't recall if her recipe added an egg, i think not, so i did. I think that's another reason why they tend to fall apart.  I'm making some now with an egg, but lately i've been using half ground pork and that seemed to help hold them together. i'm out of ground pork, so back to basics. :)

WOW. The best ever!!! My grandma is a very good cook and she could never top this... the right texture, rice was done and plenty of sauce at first you think you have to much sauce, but when you break the balls open, its very good for dipping.

Thanks....that will be on my menu,,,

I ended up using one can of tomato soup and one can of tomato sauce, cooked white rice instead of instant, and hamburger that had been thawing in the fridge all day - many of the meatballs fell apart but who cares?  It is still delicious!  We served it over the rest of the rice that didn't make it into the meatballs.

I have made this twice it always seems to go over well. I always double it and freeze some. I use slightly less Worcestershire sauce than it calls for. One time I made it and substituted 1 (soup size) can of spaghetti sauce - because I was short on the tomato soup and it tasted good that way too. I served it with rice.

I love this receipe.  Definitely needs more sauce, maybe 4 cans of soup and 1/2 c worchestshire sauce.  I also mix, put on a chopping board and then cut out my meatballs.  20 minutes at 400 without sauce, then add sauce for an additional 10 to heat up and voila!

not sure where all the great reviews came from on this one. My meatballs didnt hold together very well [this could have been my own fault, however] but even if they had, I wasnt crazy about the taste. Just tom soup and worcestshire sauce was nothing spectacular and tasted a bit sweet. i added red pepper flakes and more black pepper on top and it still didnt really do anything for it. And thsi is despite the fact that I used seasoned meat for these (I have frozen meatballs that I defrosted and added soup, egg, and rice to)--the meat itself was the best tasting part and that has nothing to do with this recipe. In the future, I think I will sautee a bunch of garlic, and also add red pepper flakes, white pepper, and black pepper to the sauce before throwing the meatballs in and allowing the spices to really cook in. Also, cooking these on a skillet was really difficult and my meatballs started spreading apart, so then I baked my next batch instead of cooking them on the stove and it was better.

My picky kids loved it and so did I.  My 6 year old told me to write that she ate 3 big meatballs and loved them.  She finished her whole plate which she never does!  This one is a keeper being it's also very simple to put together quickly.

This recipe is excellent.  I searched for it because I had left-over rice from a previous meal and wanted to use it in a meatball.  I changed this recipe to include the already cooked cold rice instead of instant rice.  I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  It turned out very good even with the changes.  Tomato soup with Worcestershire sauce is delish.  Served over noodles it made a great meal.  Thank you.

Brought back childhood memories. I didn't have 2 cans soup so substituted 16 oz tomato sauce. Also added some diced green peppers to the sauce. I baked in a casserole dish at 350 for 45 minutes. Served with low sodium beef Rice-a-Roni and corn for an easy meal on a busy day.

Great easy recipe.  I love that all the ingredients are things I usually have on hand.  My entire family loved it. They even ate up all the leftovers.  (that never happens in my house) I only had one can of soup so I used a can of tomato sauce in place of the second can.  I also didn't have instant rice so I boiled 1/4 cup regular rice for about 10 minutes.  It turned out great.   I will definitely make this again.

My family and I liked these.  I asked my husband if he liked them and he replied, "I can't stop eating them."  I thought the sauce was a little too zesty.  I asked my husband if he thought they would be better with brown gravy, but he liked them the way they were.

My 4 year old and I loved this dinner! I used 2-3 cups leftover white rice, and 2 cans diced tomatoes, and fresh basil since I had no soup or parsley available. Yummy! Served it with steamed broccoli and french bread.

This was uber deeelish... in my meatballs I used rice leftover from the night before about 1.5 cups and 2 TBS of breadcrumbs to make my meatballs hold a bit better. I baked then in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes while I prepped the sauce. I served over a sort of garlic infused fried rice I whipped up (again using the leftover rice) very quick & very tasty!!

Doubled the recipe using 2# ground turkey. Didn't have tomato soup so I used 1 can of pureed tomatoes and 1 can tomato sauce. I misread the recipe and added a whole can of sauce to the meat mixture, realized it was too much before I mixed it in and tried to pour off as much as I could. Put the meatballs in a casserole and poured the sauce over, baked for about 1 hr 15 min ina 350 degree oven. They turned out perfectly and were very flavorful. No one flavor overpowered them, just nice, tasty meatballs. Very easy to fix. Thanks for the recipe

first time i ever tried making meatballs and they came out great. i used some suggestions from other reviews -  -used tomato sauce instead of the soup, and added half a can to the meat instead of a tablespoon.   -added an extra can of sauce & an extra 1/8 cup of worcestershire to the additional sauce to cook in; looks like alot, but it was the right amount.  -cooked in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes then drained the fat, added the rest of the sauce & cooked for an additional 20 minutes.   i toasted up some sandwich rolls & added sliced mozzerella to the top to make amazing meatball sandwiches.

5 stars for ease, 4 stars for taste. Very simple and yummy recipe.  used reviewers suggestions..added extra parsley. put 1/2 can of tomato soup in the meatball mixture, and added a clove of garlic. I love Worcestershire but was worried about it for the kiddies. So I did 2 smaller casserole dishes ..one with sauce as written (LOVED IT) and one with a jarred tomato sauce (very good too!) Served with mashed potatoes. Easy family dinner everyone loved.

Ok - here's the deal with this recipe.  The amount of liquid as listed in the is not enough to cook the meatballs for several hours in a crock pot & still have the desired amount of "gravy".  Increase the fluit by adding a can of diced tomatoes and more beef stock. Also, I chopped up a big green pepper and added that to the sauce for more of a "unstuffed pepper" stew.  If you prefer a thicker stew, do not add much more beef stock &/ or use a thickening agent. Secondly, the meatballs are very bland if made exactly by the recipe.  Add garlic powder, onion powder, definitely more salt to taste and pepper.  I serve this dish over buttered noodles and it is very well received.  Explosion of flavors when seasoned properly and the house smells delightful while cooking. Easy to master - no fuss - family loves it.

Made this for our family night supper.  ALL attendees gave it rave reviews.  One thing I did differently when I doubled the recipe was to put all meatballs into a large baking dish and heat in the oven with the sauce rather than do it stove top.  I sprayed the pan with Pam, put the meatballs in, added the sauce and covered with tin foil.  I cooked for 25 minutes @ 350 degrees.  I will definitely make this again!!!!  Served it over rice.

I saw 'Porcupine meatballs' and flipped, I make this all the time...sort of.  I use two cans tomato soup and 2 cans of water - bring to a boil (seasoned with salt, pepper and a little rice thrown in) - form all the meatballs with eggs and various seasoning and put them right in the soup & water and cook for a couple hours, toward the end I mix a slurry of corn starch and water and add it and 1/2 soup can of milk.  Makes a WONDERFUL meal, tons of delicious gravy for your mashed potatoes and over the meatballs.  My Mom made it all the time as did HER Mom.

These were easy & inexpensive to make, and were very good!  I made them because other reviewers stated their toddlers loved them -- mine still wouldn't take more than 1 bite (which is typical!), but my husband & I both enjoyed the meal.  UPDATE: Doubled the sauce, added extra worcestershire, baked at 350 for an hour (covered last 20 mins,) served w/ rice & broccoli.   Yum!

I changed the seasoning for the meatballs to 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp minced dried onion and pepper with the ground beef, egg and rice. For the sauce I used 2 cans of soup, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp minced dried onion and 1 tbsp beef better then boullion. I didn't precook the meatballs, I whisked all the sauce ingredients in my dutch oven, added a little water to thin, then placed raw meatballs in the sauce. Covered and baked for 30 minutes at 350, stirred and cooked for another 30 minutes.  Served with green bean saute and mashed potatoes, was enjoyed by the whole family.

I thought these had good flavor; I tried to cut the recipe in half (only had 1/2 lb of ground beef & 1 can tomato soup in the house); for some reason, my meatballs fell apart, so it was more like meat sauce.  I made extra rice & served it over that.

These were excellent!  I ended up having to double the recipe as I had last minute guests coming over as well.  I used well over 1.75 cups of minute rice, eyeballed the onion, and added minced garlic as well.  I also added chopped onion and garlic to the sauce.  I followed other suggestions of partially baking, draining off fat, then adding sauce.  I added Lee & Perrin's to taste and increased the pepper.  EVERYONE loved these meatballs, from my 62 year old dad to my 4 year old son.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and a salad.  This is SO a keeper!

I LOVED this recipe! When I make it again, I will probably add cracker crumbs, as my meatballs broke up a little during browning, but otherwise, it was very "zesty", & full of flavor!

I made these with ground bison, and they were great! My mom always made these (with beef) when I was a kid and I have been looking for a decent recipe. This might be even better than hers. I add a little Splenda Brown Sugar Blend because that's how mom used to do it. I've made these twice, and the first time I accidentally doubled the Worcestershire sauce, and although the flavor was a little strong, hubby and I still had seconds! I like to put the extra sauce on mashed potatoes...yum!

Mmmm mm meatballs.  Love 'em.  Used 1# chuck roast that I fresh ground, and garlic salt (on hand), and jarred spaghetti sauce that was lingering in the fridge.  Flavor is really good, but I messed up in the meatballs.  First, I forgot to add the rice.  The balls don't like to hold together very well without something to suck up all the moisture.  My stuff came out more like chunky meat, rice, and spaghetti sauce...BUT oh man did it taste good.  Determined have some meatballs this weekend, tomorrow is a trip to the grocery store for tomato soup (rarely have that on hand).  I'll try them again.  Something else I learned, that onion needs to be chopped very fine.  When I make this tomorrow, I want to saute them before adding into the meat mixture.  Wish me luck...  Recipe gets 4 stars because the flavor is very good and this is quick and easy.  -LJ

I added a clove of fresh garlic to the meat mixture and also an 1/8 of a cup extra rice. I did not have the issue of the meatballs falling apart in skillet but I made sure that that the bottoms were crusty before I turned them. Overall this has an interesting flavor. It is simple and easy to make (after a long day at work.) This recipe (although good and kid friendly) is not worth five stars. I would consider this an "average" meal.

Delicious and moist meatballs - good even without the sauce.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce but that may be my taste buds and not the recipe.  But the meatballs themselves would work in several different kinds of sauces and those were absolutely delish.

This is really good comfort food.  I doubled the recipe but only had 3 cans of tomato soup, so I used 1 can of tomato sauce to make up the difference.  Even though it was delicious, I think next time I will use 1/2 tomato soup, 1/2 tomato sauce.  I used 1/2 the amount of the worcesterhire, but DH said he would like more next time.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes, which were awesome topped with the sauce.  Will make again for sure!

My first and only other experience with 'porcupines' was at a summer camp I went to. I'd been remembering them and wanting to recreate them, so I searched for recipes and found this one. It tasted a lot like the porcupines I remembered, but looked a bit different - the ones I had had more rice 'spikes' and looked more porcupiny. Maybe they were rolled in rice before being cooked?  I left out the egg because my daughter is allergic, but the meatballs still held together really well. I substituted celery salt for the garlic salt and found the celery flavour a bit strong - will use garlic salt next time.  They tasted great. I served them with mashed potatoes, sauted mushrooms, peas, corn and carrots.

this is a new staple recipe in our household! My meatballs have never stayed together. the first time i browned one side but they tried to fall apart so i just poured the sauce in and let them cook until they were done and it was good. the second time i attempted to brown them again and gave up. I put them in the oven as others suggested and crumbled up the ones that had fallen apart and added it to the sauce. I think i might crumble one up every time and add it to the sauce because it made it sooooo much better. I also have always precooked regular rice. I let my little sister help me make it and she loved getting her hands dirty and squishing it all together and gobbled it up. I serve it over rice yummmmy. OH and definitely make extra sauce!!

they fell apart! I had the meatballs in the pan on a low heat setting, and when I turned them to brown them they just crumbled apart. I ended up just browning all the meat, adding the sauce, and using this as a sauce for pasta - but the taste still fell short. Glad everyone else had luck with this, but I sure didn't.

I got this recipe years ago through a friend who was helping me learn how to cook. Only difference is I omit the garlic salt and use minced fresh garlic.

This one is a comfort food for me and never fails to disappear when I make it for my husband and kids. It's best with 
mashed potato casserole and a fresh green salad.

These had a pretty good flavour.  I used 1 cup of freshly cooked rice.  I cooked it until not quite done, poured it in a collander and rinsed with cold water to cool down and drained it well.  I was worried when I added it to mixture because it looked like it wouldn't come together, but it did.  It was really soft, but held the ball shape.  I'm sure it would have been firmer with the minute rice, but I never cook with it.  Next time, I may put a bit less rice in.  I also added some bread crumbs, maybe a third of a cup.  When I flipped them, I used 2 large spoons from my silverware set as I couldn't navigate the spatula in the pan.  It was too full.  I kind of flattened them too and just cooked on the two sides.  After I added the sauce mixture, I just shook the pan back and forth instead of stirring and they stayed together well.  Waiting to flip until they are nicely browned on the one side helps keep them together.  These would be great with mashed potatoes.  We just had potato salad.  Saw people used with regular tomatoes.  I think they would be good this way too, but I already use a recipe like that with hamburger sized patties so wanted to try with the soup.

I tried this recipe last night and it turned out really good. I used spaghetti sauce instead tomato soup, added fresh cilantro and doubled the rice. Also, I just dumped everything in a bowl (only a blob of spaghetti sauce) mixed it up and then covered with the remaining jar of sauce. I also greased a 13x9 pan and baked at 350 degrees covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for 10. It was very yummy! It is the closest I've gotten to our old tried and true recipe from when we were kids.

These are savory and delicious. I prefer mashed potatoes and spinach along with warm french bread.

These were excellent.  They were a big hit with everyone.  I doubled the recipe and used 2cups of rice.  I thought they would be more filling that way. I also used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup.  I will definately make these again.

Good recipe. I do prefer mine better, but this was really good and definitely worth making. The worcestershire gave this a nice zip. I used basmati rice raw and it cooked up fine.

Very good.  My husband loves them  I usually make a little extra sauce, as we usually have potatoes with them.  I always bake the meatballs instead of frying, and when I take them out of the oven I always drain them, and if they are extra greasy I will put them in a strainer and run a little hot water over them to rinse some of the grease off.

This recipe is good. The first time I made them we thought they were a bit too dry so the next time I cooked the rice before adding it to the meat. I also bake them in the oven instead of frying, once they're browned I drain off the grease if there is any, pour the sauce over the top, cover with foil, and throw them back in the oven until they're done. I usually serve with mashed potatoes.

These meatballs came out pretty good.  I used only half of the Worcestershire sauce on the basis of the other reviews, but I think next time I will add the full 1/4 cup since I like my food very spicy and flavorful.  I used brown rice rather than white rice and doubled the amount.  Adding 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs kept the meatballs together nicely.  Thanks!

The sauce was off. Maybe the worcestershire was a little heavy. The meatballs were saved by the fresh parsley, which gave them a very interesting texture and flavor. I just wasn't into the tomato soup + worcestershire sauce. Will look for another meatball recipe.

Very easy to make, and tasted great. Even great as leftovers. I added an additional 1/4 cup of rice, and baked it in the oven, covered for 35 min at 350. Turned out great!!! Loved the extra little kick that the sauce had!

This was really pretty good.  I added a little more rice but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I had no trouble with the meatballs falling apart.  Will back off a little on the worchestershire sauce next time, though.  It was a little strong with 1/4 cup. Will probably go with 3 tbsps. I served it with mashed potatoes, which we really liked.

My husband has asked me several times to make these, but it was a recipe I had never made.  It was great!!  I added breadcrumbs to keep the meatballs a little firmer, and I baked them instead of pan frying.  I also added a little chopped garlic.  The only complaint my husband had, was that he would have liked the meatballs to have a little more rice in them.  So next time I will adjust the rice. Its a keeper!!

Didn't care for this receipe at all.  The only thing I did different was baking the meatballs.  The texture was dry..not good.  I've never had porcupine meatballs and I never will again.

These were ok. I made them a while ago and have not had a chance to review them yet. I have not made them again since. Im not sure what it was, but there was too much of something. I think it was the worcestershire sauce. I will make these again someday and change them up a bit to suit my tastes.  may add 2 tbsp of brown sugar.

This is getting 5 stars from me because everyone in our house ate it and liked it, which is really rare.  Its easy, economical, and tastes good.  I had to leave out the onion because of the kids, and I put in a little onion powder for flavor.  The worcestershire sauce really adds something to this.  Definately not gourmet food, but great for families.

My entires family ADORES this meal!  It is now part of our regular rotation.  I make it exactly as the recipe states and it is WONDERFUL, very flavorful and filling!  The ingredients are usually found in my pantry.  Just the thing for those nights when I "forget" everyone expects an evening meal!  :)
Michelle R. thank you for sharing!

These meatballs taste wonderful served with cornbread.  Using dried parsley works just as well, or just omit it altogether...it tastes just fine without.  Even if you use instant rice, it's a good idea to pre-cook the rice about half way before adding to the meatball mixture.

My family liked this recipe and requested I make it again. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I even doubled it hoping to have some left over but we ate them all and licked the pan clean. Only changes I made was in the cooking. I cooked the meatballs in the microwave instead of browning them in a skillet and then baked it in the oven after adding the sauce.

I would definitely suggest zesting up this recipe.  Try some cut Mancini peppers, Jalepenos or minced garlic.  Dill, taragon...something.  These were very ordinary.  Try kicking up the sauce by using BBQ sauce instead of tamato soup and Wches.

We thoroughly browned the meatballs and then simmered them in the tomato soup as stated in the recipe, and they turned out great.  They're definitely going to be a family staple.

I've made this twice. it is so delicious. After you add the tomato soup mixture to the meatballs it cooks down into this thick flavorful delicious sauce that doesn't taste anything like tomato soup. it is amazing.  try following the recipe as written the first time, then tweak according to taste the second time.  making them in the skillet as per the recipe is so much easier than baking them if you have a large enough skillet. I served it over cheesy grits the first time and the second time i served it over mashed potatoes. both are delicious!  i will be making these regularly!

Instant Pot! Surprisingly FANTASTIC. I am not a fan of canned tomato soup but this was delicious. Prepared this recipe as written except for the addition of some favorite seasoning (Cavender's) and I made it in my Instant Pot which was super easy. Just 4 minutes on high pressure and then let it sit for 6 minutes before you remove the lid. Perfect, moist, delicious!

I've been making this kid friendly dish for 50 years. It's basically the same recipe as the one I've always used from the BH&G Cookbook, circa 1968...which I borrowed from my mom when I married and never returned. :) If you make these in a pressure cooker, you'll see why they're called porcupines...the rice puffs up and sticks out all over the meatball like porcupine quills.

I made this as written except I didn't measure the worcestershire sauce since I made it to taste. These meatballs were outstanding. I did not have a problem with them falling apart but, I did brown them on the stove first and then throw them in the oven because my iron skillet browned them too fast. I covered them with foil and finished them in the oven. I will be using this exact recipe to make cabbage rolls next!

I use this as a basic step and add to it as we like too. The egg and breadcrumbs make a different on how well your meatballs stick together. I add extra seasoning, powder mustard, paprika and ketchup and milk to make sure they are not too dry. I brown my meatballs in a skillet and then bake them covered in the tomato soup sauce. In my soup I add the worcestershire, a can of tomato sauce and water to make a thinner base.
A good starter recipe but don't be shy to add what you like. You can't go wrong.

Its pretty hard to screw these up as they are such a simple and flavorful dish.
Rather than pan frying them, i bake them in the oven. I added Italian seasoning and crushed crackers to firm them up a bit

I have made this the first time exactly as written, a couple of times in the crockpot and a few times browning first and then finishing in the oven.  All versions are great! It's so easy and lends itself to adding any flavors you like.  I like to add garlic.  Whole family enjoys the meal.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls and it's a good base but definitely bland. My meatballs kept a fine texture - some say theirs fell apart but I didn't have an issue with that. The issue was the sauce. It was just "ok". It tasted mostly like tomato soup because that's what it was. If I were to make it again, I'd add a lot more spices, maybe some garlic, soup to the meatballs or maybe make a different sauce all together. It's a good concept though. Maybe good for kids.

Yes, these are easy to make and are  tasty if you like this type of meatball. The sauce, when left to thicken is a nice addition also. Give them a try for dinner and the kids in the house will love them also. To the lady who said her meatballs fell apart, did you brown them well enough on all sides. These are delicate and should be handled as such when turning them during the browning process.

I made this and it was delicious! I followed most of the instructions, except I didn't have "fresh" parsley, but I used Italian seasonings, and cayenne to add a lil spice to it. And instead of using the rest of the soup, I used spaghetti sauce. It turned out great!

I enjoyed these. The rice was pre-cooked. I baked at 400 for 40 min, drained the fat, added rest of soup and baked for 20 min. more.  They were dark on the outside and soft in the middle, yum.

ok, gave these a try and was quite surprised.  I did add a little extra spices to my meat mixture.  I ended up adding about a half of a cup plain bread crumbs to thicken up the meat.  My husband did not care for the sauce, but he did like the meatballs.

Quick and simple recipe with a lot of zip! My husband and I both loved the zesty taste so the worcestershire sauce was the right amount.  I used regular long grain brown rice, so I cooked it beforehand, added the amount called for to the beef, and served the meatballs and sauce over the rice.

My boys went crazy over these.  One said I should make this recipe every night.... wow, that is the best review he's ever given!  I read many of the reviews and took away my own set of enhancements which are: 1. added 1/4 t garlic powder for flavor, 2. added 1/2 t crushed red pepper for zing, 3. added about 2 T of bread crumbs, just because I thought it would make it go a bit further, and many people recommended this to help keep together, 4. added 1 1/2 t Worcestershire sauce to the meatballs (did anyone else notice the mistake in the recipe, where she says add "remainder" of Worcestershire sauce to the tomato soup, but she never mentioned how much to add to the meatballs in the first place), 5. reduced amount of Worcestershire sauce added in the soup to 2 T, because most said it was overpowering.  Also, I thought it would be easier to bake, so I did at 350 degrees, covered, for 35 minutes (just poured the sauce over my 1 inch meatballs).  Many reviewers seems to have grown up on these and from those reviewers, I learned it is traditionally served over mashed potatoes, which was awesome.  Try the soup before you jump to substituting tomato sauce... the flavor was really good, slightly different than old standard of bathing them in tomato sauce.

I wasn't too thrilled with these. I used the entire amount of Worcestershire sauce, but the sauce was still a bit too sweet. I wouldn't use the word "zesty" to describe these. Maybe a bit tangy, but not really zesty. Also, I didn't have instant rice, so I used 1/2 cup regular cooked rice -- because I looked online and apparently, 1/4 cup uncooked instant rice will equal 1/2 cup cooked rice. Mine didn't turn out dry, but I did add an extra Tbs. of sauce to the meat mixture. But one mistake I did make was to brown the meatballs in a pan coated with olive oil on high heat. They burnt very quickly. So then I transferred them to a casserole dish and baked at 400 degrees F for about 50 minutes. I had to cover them with foil towards the end, though, because they started to burn a little. I will make these again only if my toddler likes them. That's the true test. :D

This is a good recipe as is.  Try adding minced garlic, another spoon of soup, and a splash of worcestershire to the meatballs.  Brown them very slowly over low heat.  Add another can of soup, green pepper strips, minced garlic  and carrot slices to the meatballs and simmer until done.

Nice flavor.  I used ground turkey and the meatballs fell apart a bit when cooking them.   I also substituted tomato sauce for the soup and the combination of sauce and worchestershire was great.

This was ok.  It wasn't like I thought it would be. I will try this again to see if it was just the mood I was in.  When I do I will do another review.

My husband and son loved these.  They were very tasty, and it is a must make again in my home! I followed the recipe exactly. I think next time I will just put it in a loaf rather than make meatballs just to cut out a step or two. Overall, very yummy!

I don't know why but the meatballs were good but the sauce was bland, really surprised by the way it turned out, maybe if tomatoe sauce was used it would be bettter.

Not the hit I expected.  Used less than half the Worcestershire sauce called for and it was still overpowering.  Will modify tomato sauce next time - not hard to customize tomatoe sauce.  But otherwise a quick and easy dinner.

Lovely recipe! I made this for my mom, who has made these for several years, and she approved! I was nervous that they'd be too onion-y with the chopped onions, and onion powder (I didn't see the need for extra sodium).  I doubled the recipe, and served the meatballs over rice I made with vegetable stock.

Wow!  I did not expect much as I was making this recipe - it was too simple!  But these came out fabulously.  I followed the recipe exactly, I would not cut down on the Worchestire (I don't know how to spell it).  Even the BF loved this!

I make a version of porcupine meatballs every Groundhog day, and we call them Groundhog meatballs. I don't know if it was just this recipe, or if I'm getting better at meatballs, but this was my best time yet. I followed the recipe exactly, except used garlic salt instead of onion salt because I didn't have any. The meatballs came out moist and yummy. I served them over mashed potatoes.

Everyone enjoyed this dish which doesnt usually happen in my house. The sauce was what made it tasty. The only changes I made were I cooked the meatballs in the oven and then transfered to stove top, substituting tomatoe sauce for the soup. I thought the meatballs were a little dry and might have added more tomotoe sauce in the meat before cooking next time. I will probably make these every two weeks.

LOVED them! I only used 1 can of tomato soup and a bit of regular pasta sauce - i think they could have used more rice becuz I had to add bread crumbs since I couldn't get them to hold together - either way, a definite keeper!

These were pretty good, nothing exceptional but I would probably make them again. I made them with spicy sausage--ground beef is a little too bland for my taste buds--and they were pretty good.

I'd never heard of porcupines until a couple of days ago, but apparently my husband grew up on them, so I had to try it out. I added 1/2tsp of minced garlic and subbed a can of tomato sauce for the second can of soup. These are much better than I thought they would be! Am considering this recipe as filling for stuffed peppers or cabbage rolls since I think the seasoning is great.

The flavor was not too good and there was no stirring involved - only ginger rotating of each individual meatball. Kind of a pain. The rice was undercooked inside and there wasn't enough. Thanks for the recipe, but won't be making this again.

Totally awesome!  I made this two nights ago and my family just finished the leftovers for lunch today.  I have a 5, 2 and 1 year old and everyone LOVED it.  I followed the recipe as given and also served the Meatballs over rice- yummy! Thanks for the great recipe- it will be in our weekly dinner rotation for sure:)

My family really enjoyed these.  I followed the recipe as written, but the next time I make these I will increase the rice to either 1/2 cup or even 3/4 cup. As they were, they had a good flavor and we did not find them dry at all, just not enough "porcupines".

I read many reviews for many meatball recipes, and went with this one!  I have made it many times now, and it has become a staple in our house with three young children.  I really like the tomato soup.  It adds a lot of flavor and is great over rice!  I did make a few changes, to please the kids.  I don't add onion.  I also only do about 1/8 cup of Worc sauce, as the kids like the milder flavor.

Rarely would I bother making this type of dish, admittedly I am a "fresh ingredients snob".  However my crockpot died and dinner went with it so I took some meatballs I had made ahead out of the freezer.  Looking for a quick fix I came across this recipe and saw the great reviews.  I was skeptical but tried it anyway.   I don't know how to put this gently  but I did not care for this recipe. The sauce has a salty weird flavor.  My children would not eat it and after trying it I had to agree.

I couldn't get the ingredients to stay together in balls, but the taste was great. I just ended up making some macaroni noodles and mixing it in with the meat mixture and my family loved it.

I took your advice and served this over hot rice and it was fantastic! My husband and I love this recipe and the sauce is so good! We'll definitely be making this again! Thanks!

I substituded one of the cans of tomatoe soup for tomatoe sauce, and it still tasted a little bland to me.

Good new meal to add to our rotation.  We added extra worcestershire sauce to make the sauce tangy and served over mashed potatoes.  Will make again.

My husband and one daughter (14yo) loved this recipe.  My other daughter (6yo) didn't really like it, but she ate it without complaints (so I guess that does say something in itself!)  As for myself, I thought it was just OK.  The only change I made is that I added a dash of cayenne pepper, a dash of black pepper and a dash of garlic powder to the sauce.  Even though I didn't like the recipe, anything that both kids and husband will eat should get 5 stars.

This recipe was pretty good, everyone ate it up, but mine did not come out very porcupiney, they were just meatballs with rice in them, I might try this again with more rice in it.  Pretty good basic recipe though.

Maybe because I used 7% lean ground beef it turned out so dry? It really wasn't the greatest, I have a Russian recipe for meatballs that is so much better!

These are by no means healthy or gourmet grub but these are great!  Excellent family meal -  quick, easy and budget friendly.  My toddler LOVES ground beef and I was fed up of making spaghetti and chilli for him so I tried these and they were a hit.  He ate 4!  Husband and I liked them too.  Will be making these again for sure :)

I made these last night for dinner and both of us thought they were really great.  I added green pepper which gave a great flavor and left out the worcheshire because I didn't have any.  I did have some trouble with them falling apart, but I think that was more my own fault because I forgot to spray the pan.  Oops!  They were still really great though and I'd definitely make them again!

Really enjoyed this and it was quick to make. I browned the meatballs in the same pot as I cooked them with the sauce. Sort of a sweet n' sour taste. The only thing I added was a sprinkling of Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning mix.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe. Similar to my grandmother's, but with more zest. I added a little more Worchester sauce to give it more flavor. The end result tasted wonderful but next time (and there will be a next time)I will going to add more rice.

This is good--a very interesting flavor.  For those users who have had trouble with their meatballs disintegrating, I suggest adding oats or bread crumbs to your meatball mixture.  I added oats and had no problems.  We'll have this again!

These were good, but I found the sauce to be a little salty. Next time, I would either use low sodium soup or not add so much worcestershire.

I must admit I was skeptical about this recipe, but I followed it pretty much as is (omitted onion, added garlic) and my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I served the meatballs over white rice, which was very good, but then I realized that it did seem kind of pointless to have gone to the trouble to put rice in the meatballs... lol. Good recipe, will make again. Thanks!

This has gone into our weekly menu. It reminds me of what my mom used to make when I was younger but with a little more kick. I used a little over 1/2c of instant brown rice and cooked this covered in 350 oven for 30 mins and uncovered for about 10 mins to brown a little.

I took the advice of some of the other reviews and made a few changes.  I added 1/4 cup breadcrumbs and more rice (boil in the bag brown rice, uncooked, worked just fine).  I used 1/2 tsp TWO SISTERS brand Seasoned Salt and 1/2 tsp Outrageously Garlic instead of onion salt.  I sprayed a glass casserole dish with Pam, covered it with foil and put them directly into a 350 oven for 35 minutes.  It smelled great while it was cooking and my husband really enjoyed it (I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it).  Thanks for posting and all the suggestions!  I'll be making this again.

These were wonderful! I did not have parsley so I left that out, but made the rest of the recipe as it asked. My husband and I both enjoyed these very much. The only bad thing was that they slightly fell apart, but I expected that from other reviews. Great recipe though, a definite keeper.

As is, this is a great recipe.  The only change I make every time is I bake the meatballs.  They turn out more solid this way, I find that pan cooking them causes them to break apart.  I also occasionally substitue onion flakes for the chopped onion, depending on what I have in the house.

I did not like this, but my husband did. When I said I didn't like it, he pointed out that it really tastes like a meatloaf made into meatballs. I don't like meatloaf, so that may give you an idea of why I didn't like it. I did make a few small additions...I added a little oregano to the soup mixture. Also, the meatballs are soft, but if you handle them only minimally before cooking them, they'll stay together. I used about a 1/2 cup of cooked, regular white rice instead of instant, since I didn't have any instant. I MIGHT make this again if I was in need of something fairly quick. But maybe next time I might use egg noodles?  Overall, I would say edible, but not great.

I doubled the recipe and these turned out pretty good.  I did make a couple of adjustments though as I went along.  I only used three cans of tomato soup and if I make this again as a doubled batch I'd only use two with the quater cup of Warcestershire sauce.  I did double the W sauce to a half cup to only the three cans of tomato soup and did find a little too overbearing.  I also only used about a tablespoon of dried minced onion instead of a quarter cup fresh.  And instead of onion salt I used about about a teaspoon to a table spoon of onion and herb salt free seasoning and salt free garlic and hearb too, with a little salt put in by its self also.  And also used about 3/4 cup precooked jasmine rice and did add about a tablespoon or so of bread crumbs and had no problem with the meatballs falling apart.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband went nuts over the sauce. I was pleasantly suprised as well. I thought the sauce might just taste like tomato soup, but it was nothing like it. I also added my own spices to the sauce (spike, and a couple other things) My only complaint is that the meatballs fell apart very easily when cooking.

Very good.  The only thing I changed was I did not brown the meatballs first. (I do not think it is necessary)  Mixed everything together and shaped into six medium meatballs.  Put in a pot with the tomato mixture and let it cook under a medium-low heat.  Be careful when you turn them so that they do not fall apart and make sure to get the sauce all over the meatballs so the flavor cooks in.  They did not come out dry at all and the taste was very good with the sauce.

These were so-so.  There was something wrong with the flavor that I just couldn't put my finger on and they crumbled during cooking.  My husband thought they were "enh" so I probably won't make them again.  If I do, I will make some serious modifications to the recipe.

This is kind of a mixed review.  I thought they were fine...not something to rave about but good and something that should be very family friendly.  I tried this recipe in the hopes of finding something that my extremely picky 2 1/2 year old would eat that didn't come out of the frozen food aisle.  This is where the recipe failed...sigh.  He won't eat anything with a sauce on it, especially tomato, so I wiped off his meatballs with paper towels before I served it to him.  Even so, all he would do for 20 minutes was try and pick out the grains of rice one by one to eat.  I finally gave up and gave him a serving of rice with one meatball crumbled up in it.  I think he accidently ate a few bites of meat.  Carol

This was sooo good.  I live in Sweden where meatballs are very common.  These were a great treat not to mention that they have a great kick to them.  My guest loved them.  I couldn't keep them in stock.

Best meatballs I've ever had! I used jarred parsley instead of fresh & cooked the meatballs with nonstick spray instead of oil - fantastic! REALLY easy!

This has become my standard recipe for porcupine meatballs.  They are a true comfort food, and my toddler loves them.
