This recipe was super-easy to make.  If you have a food processor use it instead of the blender, which required a lot of intervention when mixing.  I didn't think the original recipe would be enough for a dinner party of 8 so I doubled it, but now I'm stuck with plenty of extra.

I made this for a party and it was great! The pesto adds a nice zippy flavor and it complements all the fresh vegetables.

Oh, so yummy!  I used the whole brick of cream cheese, which after being in the frig, made it more of a spread than a dip, but it did soften up after sitting out.  Great with veggies and pita chips.  I heated up the leftovers and used it as a sauce on tortellini and that was wonderful, too!

I just have one word for this...WOW!!!  I am so glad I found this recipe!  I had some pesto that I didn't want to go to waste, and I was so tired of the traditional spinach/ranch veggie dips!  It is simple yet very elegant, and most likely you will have all the ingredients in your frig.  I did use a whipped cream cheese, and low fat sour cream, just so I wouldn’t feel so guilty.  I served this at a dinner party with assorted veggies and wine and cheese for an appetizer…but after the dip was devoured no one was really hungry for the main course ;)

Found this veggie dip while searching for something "different" to bring to a work social to go along with my veggie tray.  Wow!  So good, i mean, really good!  If you are looking for something other than french onion or ranch, this is it.  Might be too strong of a flavor for some, but i enjoyed it.

This was just a little salty for my taste. But otherwise very good with veggies. Lots of compliments...

Really good and different from the same old dips you see.  Mine was served with crackers and chips instead of veggies and I thought it went over very well.

I was looking for a nice change of pace from your typical veggie dipping sauce and I found it in this recipe.  I also put out a more traditional sauce.  People were digging into this one.  I even saw people dipping cocktail shrimp into it!  Definitely a keeper.

Really good!  The cream cheese adds nice body to it but after refridgerating, it hardens so much my cucumbers can't really grab any dip, so next time I will use cottage cheese instead.  I'll repost if that works/doesnt work.

I tried a variation on this recipe using fresh basil, garlic and a little olive oil. It was excellent with pita bread!

Easy low carb dip.  Delicious with peppers. Didn’t care for it with shrimp.

This was a very pleasant change to the standard Ranch dip!  I used light sour cream, and it was just fine.  Note that there is a lot of garlic in Buitoni brand pesto - it's wonderful tasting, but be careful not to talk right in someone's face!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was a hit at my Christmas party.  Everyone thought it was delicious.  The green colored dip looked festive with my red and green veggies.

Not bad, but not great either. A little bland for my taste.
