Mmmmm, mm!  If the fact that I made what I thought would be for two nights ended up being only enough for tonight says anything, then it will speak to how much Hubs and I enjoyed this.  Bland?  Not for us, but we appreciate the flavor of the food itself and don’t like masking it with a lot of distracting seasoning. For that reason, I didn’t even use the ginger, which neither of us cares for.  The sesame oil adds just what is needed for complexity of flavor and I also added a dribble of mirin (sweet rice wine) to the cornstarch/soy sauce/ chicken broth mixture.  While it wasn’t necessary, I knew it would be a good fit.  Instead of garlic powder I tossed in some fresh, minced, tho’ I don’t think the dish would suffer using the garlic powder as directed.  For the “cut up fresh vegetables” I used what I had in the fridge – zucchini, mushrooms, sweet onion and baby bok choy.   As for the shrimp, I used the big guys, 16-20 count. I tossed them in the hot pan straight from the freezer and they were done in just a few minutes – in other words, don’t even bother thawing them first.  I’m sure I’ll make this again – exactly the same way.

I love stir fry and I love shrimp so when I saw this recipe I got excited.  To my dismay this recipe was very bland.  My 12 y/o daughter didn't care for it either.

This was really good, not too much spice - the flavor of the vegetables and shrimp is the focus. I'll make this again.

I had to add a bit more soy sauce and ginger at the end to save it from being bland. Good start to a good recipe. Sauce worked out well, this is easy to make :)

I had no cornstarch so I used two tablespoon of all purpose flour, I was out of chicken broth so I made a 2 cups of  very mild chicken boullion from the Knorr's grandule. I boiled the water for the boullion with the shrimp tails that I removed from my frozen shrimp. Cooled then strained the broth. The  fully cooked tail-on package cost less. I only made 3 cups of rice and combined everything together.  I used cabbage and asparagus and onion. I added the shrimp only after everything was done. Covered and let stand about 10 minutes...yummm!

I doubled the soy sauce and sesame oil. Also, I added a tablespoon of Teriyaki sauce. I used two cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. It was really good.

This was bland.  I decided to make the sauce, and marinate the shrimp and veggies in it, and grill them.

I didn't have seasame oil-which made it more bland, I did use fresh ginger which helped. It was a great way to use up shrimp from a shrimp ring

I didn't like this one very well. Like some others have said it tasted quite bland to me. Although it was cheap and easy to make- I already had all of the ingredients in my refrigerator.It would be better if you added some of your favorite spices in- if you like a stronger flavor. I substituted chicken in for the shrimp, and I put a bunch of black pepper on it.
All in all it was decent for a quick fix,& that's why I give it 3 stars.

I tried this, but made a few changes. I used fried garlic oil with some sesame seeds put in oil, and added about 1/2 cup peanuts. It was the best stir fry I've fixed so far.

I used fresh ginger and garlic to cook the shrimp in, I also used fresh garlic and ginger to cook with the vegetables and I doubled the amount of ginger. I was out of corn startch as well and subbed flour which never really makes a difference to me. It was decent, but I have had better :)

I've made this a few times. The family loves it, with the exception of my daughter not liking shrimp (She picks it out). Only thing I did differently was use different veggies once or twice according to our taste.

Too much broth in the sauce for our tastes, even with the thickener it was closer to a thick soup than a stir fry. The flavors were good though. Thanks for sharing.

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and made sure to add some extra seasonings for flavor.  It was very tasty and a very good looking dish. I will be making this again.

I used this recipe last night, with 1/2 lb of shrimp and carrots, green beans and mushrooms for the vegs.  It was tasty, simple and easy to do and served over white rice.  It could use a little bit more zing to it, but I will use this recipe again. I will read a few more reviews to look for tweaking ideas others have tried and had sucess with...

This turned out well! It definitely could use some spicing up though, it was pretty bland even adding more of the spices then called for.

This was bad.   Three tablespoons of cornstarch made the sauce way too thick, and the taste was terrible.

I thought this was a great dish...I upped the ginger and the garlic (well I am not sure on the garlic...I just eye balled it) but it is fantastic...I am eating it right now for lunch the day after and it is still incredible.
REALLY good.

My first stir fry and this was easy to pull off!  I did find it a little bland but some fresh cracked pepper did the trick. I omitted sesame oil as I didn't have any so might add that next time.

Never made a stirfry before and I found this to be easy.  Needs some spice so next time will increase soy sauce and add black pepper

Used red, yellow and orange peppers, carrots and broccoli. Added 1/2c onion and 4t minced garlic and still lol found this very bland. It definitely needs salt. Black pepper too. Next time I would add 1/4c soy sauce, maybe 1T hoisin, some red pepper and more garlic.

This was a really good, quick recipe. So easy on a weeknight. It allows you to use the veggies you have on hand. I will definitely make it again. I only added sesame seeds and green onions  to the top. I substituted arrowroot starch for the corn starch.

We enjoyed this dish a lot.  Yes, the sauce is a little bland, but that is easily remedied on your own.  I had a lot of veges to use: Mushrooms, fresh zucchini, 2 tomatoes seeded and chopped, bok choy, 1 green pepper, carrot matchsticks, and broccoli.  I will add more shrimp next time, just because SHRIMP!!  Served over a bed of Schwan's rice pilaf.  I will be making this again.  I may add more sesame oil, ginger and garlic next time.  This is a great recipe.

It was easy but the sauce didn't get very thick and could have used a bit more flavor. We just added soy sauce on our plates and that helped.

This was the best shrimp recipe I found.  The meal was excellent.  I fed 11 people (I 4Xed the receipe) and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  
P.S. I used extra large shrimp I found on sale in Albertson's.

Awesome!!! I used sweet soya sauce and teriyaki sauce with the regular soya sauce. Also added a little more sesame oil to the vegetable oil when I stir fried the vegetables. Then added toasted cashews when I served the stir fry over the rice 
YUM YUMMY!!

I did the same thing as MonicaK did because I was reading a lot of reviews saying it was too bland. I doubled the soy sauce and sesame oil and added 2 gloves of fresh garlic (minced) instead of the garlic powder. Also added 1 tablespoon of Teriyaki sauce. Salt and pepper to taste. It was great! My whole family loved it!

I added just a bit more soy sauce.  Did not use carrots or peppers; instead I used zucchini, yellow squash, napa cabbage, and scallions.  Came out great.
Yes, I believe this recipe did not have strong flavors, but this gave your veggies and shrimp a chance to enjoy their flavors rather than burying them under a strong sauce.  My son added a shake from the soy sauce bottle to his serving, which beats making the entire dish too salty.

A very quick and tasty dish! My one big tip: DON'T skip the sesame oil. In fact, double it.  IMHO it is not optional. It gives the essential nutty flavor to the dish. I love garlic, so I doubled the garlic. This recipe is good by itself,  but if you like a little heat, a teaspoon of Sriracha chile garlic sauce. It really amps up the flavor. And if you have some folks who are not adventurous, you can even add it to individual portions. It is not necessary, the original recipe is delicious; it's just my little tweak.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Love - Love will make again. I used red pepper, white onion and snow peas for my veggies. I did a few changes use 2 1/2 cornstarch in sauce and toss the rest on shrimp before cooking. I finds this keeps the shrimp moister. Also added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flake.

This was great. The only thing I did different was sprinkle some sesame seeds on top. I think the sauce could easily be adapted to chicken or pork stir fry as well.

I agree with other reviewers, this is totally lacking flavor.  I even did what others recommended, increased soy sauce, ginger and sesame oil.  And used real garlic.  I added a little seschuan bottled sauce to it to give it a little kick, otherwise very bland.

Love it. The flavor of the sauce was amazing. I added cilantro, gave it a even better flavor.  It does not take long to make. Next I will make right before I need for dinner, made it a little to early so the veggies got soft, but still tasted great.

This was a good beginner recipe. We made it exactly as it was written. My husky and I both agreed that it could have used more flavor. We will be making this again, but kicking up the soy sauce, ginger and garlic a bit.

We loved this!!!  To those who found it bland...I did add 2 extra tablespoons of soy sauce, another half teaspoon of sesame oil, a full teaspoon of ginger and several cloves of fresh garlic rather than the garlic powder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was delicious.  We served this over a "multigrain medley" we found that had brown rice, red rice, wild rice and quinoa so I'm sure that helped make it more flavorful too.  Such a nice healthy recipe!

Once on the plate I had to add more of all seasonings plus red pepper flakes to give it flavour because it was VERY bland.  Will double all seasonings next time and see how that is however I anticipate even tripling the seasonings.  Then I think it'll be a good recipe.

I make this recipe all of the time.  And here I thought that I had invented it.  Sometimes I make it without any sauce at all and it is still delicious.  My combination of shrimp, garlic, onions and mushrooms with mild seasonings over rice can easily stand alone.
