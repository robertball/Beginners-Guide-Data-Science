This is my go-to recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I hit it with the immersion blender to make it extra smooth and creamy.

This was a bit too sweet for my family's taste. I used 1/3 less sugar and it was perfect. I'm definitely going to be making this again

Halved the sugar.  The allspice and clove threw us off a bit, but the end result was nice!
