I found the recipe when I plugged in a couple of ingredients I had on hand. I made it for my MOPS group this morning and I got RAVE reviews from many women in the group (about 50 women in all) that also asked for the recipe. I did substitute colby cheese, but the rest I did by the recipe.   I felt like it was fairly easy. A few steps but nothing very hard, and it looked very impressive once it was done. I'll for sure be making it again for other get togethers.

I thought this was a lot of work for a not very special result. Plus, it calls for lots of ingredients I don't normally have on hand - leeks, gruyere cheese, ham slices, cream. So it ends up being pricey.

Somone made this at a women's brunch and it was sooo yummy!  I went back for more but they were all gone so I asked her for the recipe so I could make my own.

I liked it, although the leek layer was a bit too mushy.  My kids did not enjoy this recipe, no matter how much Dr. Seuse I quoted at them.

Was able to just barely use TWO thin slices of ham per cup and would do that again. Everybody loved these! But I don't cook much so it felt like a lot of work.

I used ingredients I had already. Therefore, I used pastrami instead of ham, smoked gruyere and added portabella mushrooms (yes I had those on hand, I am a foodie). My 4 yr old and 16 yr old ate it all in one sitting. Suffice to say it was pretty good. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I'll post a pic.
