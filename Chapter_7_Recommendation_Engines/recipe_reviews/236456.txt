Very tasty!  Make sure you use gluten free corn flakes if you are on the FODMAP diet.  I made 1/3 of the recipe and made a few changes. I added 1/8 tsp. cinnamon and did not add the sugar.   The cinnamon spiced it up and it is sweet enough to eat without the sugar.  

Thanks, All Recipes for having a FODMAP recipe in your collection.  I would love to see more.

I made this exactly as stated, but I thought it was too sweet.  EVen my husband who loves sweets thought so, also.
