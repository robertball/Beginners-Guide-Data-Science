This was a very savory, spicy, tasty chili.  I used extra lean ground beef instead of the turkey because that's what I had in the house and a bottle of ale because I didn't have beer.  I've never added sugar or cinnamon to meat before.  It really was delicious.  This is a keeper.  I put it over white basmati rice.

I made this as written except I halved it. I used crushed tomatoes. While it tastes good, I only wish it looked half as good as it tasted....

I thought this was a delicious chili recipe. I personally prefer slightly sweet and spicy chili, and this one fit the bill. I had never added beer to a chili recipe before either, but I honestly liked the flavor it added. I did add a little less chipotles though, because 6 are way too much for any dish. I added 2 chipotle peppers, and 2 teaspoons of sauce. Also I upped my chili powder to a 1/4 cup. I also did not have whole cloves, but I did have them in powdered form, so I added a few dashes. I also added some smoked paprika, which was delicious. I will make this chili again, but I will tweak it a bit.  

**EDIT**

After serving it to my family, it was a HUGE hit with them. I changed my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars. My hubby begged me to save the recipe.

Sorry, but that's not really chili. Cinnamon sticks and cloves???? Frank X. Tolbert would be rolling in his grave
