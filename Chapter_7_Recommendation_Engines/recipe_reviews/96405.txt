Quicky, easy to prepare and delicious! I cannot wait to make this again. Used jarred Alfredo sauce instead of refrigerated and added a couple of tablespoons of red wine, fresh minced garlic (you cannot have Italian without garlic), used dried parsley and olive oil. I cooked the sausage in water and then sauteed in olive oil and added the rest of the ingredients. Used sliced black olives from Trader Joe's and also added some ground cayenne pepper. I have never had an Italian sausage dish without tomatoes and this was superb!

This was OK. It needed more sauce which I will add if I make it again.

Very good, although I used a spicy italian sausage instead of the Jennie-O turkey sausage.

Delicious! I would use more sun dried tomatoes next time though.

Both the boyfriend and I were "wowed" by this yummy recipe.  He loves the alfredo and I usually like red sauce, so I was really impressed with how much I liked this recipe.  I added a clove of crushed garlic to the sauce as it was warming on the stove.  I used about half of a 1 lb. jar of light alfredo sauce... could have used more, but didn't really need to.  This was a very filling dish, thanks so much!

Love this recipe!!! I did use the gound sasauge and crumbled it, which worked great. My kids really enjoyed this also.
