I absolutely loved this recipe!  I was cooking some pork (a huge amount) for another recipe and pulled some of it off to do this one.  This one took a lot more steps than the other one, but oh boy was it worth it!  I made half of this recipe as written with a couple of minor exceptions--had no lemon pepper, so just used a little zest and more pepper, no granulated onion so used fresh, chicken stock was from carcass of Roast Sticky Chicken, no goat horn peppers, so used red jalapenos.  This was so very good!  And it gave me a chance to use the beforehand unknown Garlic Basil Spread.  Yum!  I'll be doing this one again for sure!

This was a very good recipe except for the large amount of salt and pepper it calls for.  I would probably half both of them.  I didn't half them at first.  Instead, I make it as the recipe stated.  But when I saw how much the spice mixture made I opted not to put it all on the roast.  Also, I didn't have any wine so I just put extra chicken stock in the bottom of the pan.  I don't think it needed that much liquid either.  It didn't seem to serve any purpose.  After shredding the pork I put it in the liquid which was very peppery and salty.  Then I took the pork out and put it in the onion/pesto mixture without the Marsala wine.  The sandwiches tasted really good but were still quite salty.

Lots of steps and ingredients, but SOOO worth it. I followed the recipe to a T, except I didn't have granulated onion and garlic, so I used onion and garlic powder. It was delicious and extremely flavorful. It was a tad too spicy for my husband so next time I might use a little less red pepper flakes, but I loved it as is. Will definitely be making this again!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

I simplified this quite a bit but was really good. Cooked chopped mushrooms and added leftover pork roast (cut in small pieces), onions I had also cooked in the slow cooker with the roast, halved cherry tomatoes, a bit of bbq sauce, pepper and Italian seasoning. Spread hot mixture on a sub bun, topped with mozzarella and popped under broiler until cheese was melted.

This tastes better than my grandmother’s porketta.  We followed the recipe exactly and WOW… We have made this several times and are amazed at how much my family loves it.  Thanx for this recipe.

I used 1/2 salt and pepper. It's still too salty and too many spices that overpowered the pork. Spices did not mix too well together.
