This recipe was great! I cooked it for my mother and sister and they seemed to enjoy it on a nice cold day. I might suggest to let it cool before you eat it ... of course ir was a little hot. I really recommend it for a small family dinner.

i liked this soup but I added a few things to it. It need more ham, and more flavor. I will make it again but a little more.

I am not sure about what side of the Mississippi the recipe author is referring to and being on the West Coast, I wouldn't know a good one from a bad one. 
I added garlic and some chili flakes to this, didn't use the canned ham. I did use beef broth (chicken broth would be good too) It fills the belly,  and tastes good too.  Would I make it again, yes I would!
