This salad was really good - of course, it was mainly due to the dressing!  I have to admit, though, I subbed olive oil because we don't have grapeseed oil, and I only used half the amount.  I think using a half cup of oil would have actually made it way too oily.  It wasn't until later that I realized I left out the carrots, too, but it was still excellent without.  I decreased poppy seeds to 2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons and think that was just enough, too.  A thought on the apples - if you don't plan to serve the salad immediately and put the dressing on the salad right away, you might want to shake them with some lemon juice ahead of time to keep them from turning brown.

This salad is awesome, especially the dressing.  I used pomegranate instead of blueberries to make it more festive for a Christmas Eve get-together and everyone loved it. I also toasted the walnuts.

This was great summer salad! I skipped the lettuce and added some snap peas, craisins, and red onion. It was yummy, light & refreshing!

Sensational dressing!  Blended the dressing; used half of the ingr: EVOO, mustard, honey; added the red walnuts, garlic, black pepper corn to the blender; kept the acid amount the same.  Added beets, red onions, fennel, garbanzo beans and my salad was copiously fab!  Thanks Christine!

Great idea for a salad.  I was trying to find a salad for a party.  This was perfect, I substituted what I had on hand.  Spring salad mix, strawberries, almonds and no cheese.  Much more exciting than the spinach and strawberry salad I first planned.  This salad has inspired me.

Great salad dressing.  I only had lettuce, tomatoes, apples & carrots, so I used that.  Also, I didn't have feta cheese, but I had some sliced emek cheese to use up.  I just cut it up and added to the salad.  Made for a very tasty and different salad.

This is very good. Lots of chopping but well worth the effort. Only substituted toasted almond slivers for the walnuts because of personal preference.

Made it for guests this weekend and everyone loved it .. I omitted the poppy seeds.    The flavors and how they blend are amazing.  Perfect salad for this time of year when the blueberries are so good and readily available.
