I would recommend making this the day before you eat it.  I ate it right after and found the mint overpowering.  When I had the leftovers the next day, the flavors had blended beautifully and it was delicious.

This salad was Really terrific!! I liked that it was mildly sweet. The vinegar was just a good balance. I did add some nice plump shrimp and mild peppers. Excellent summer fair! The other lunch ladies loved it as well:)

This was fabulous!  I made it twice this week and am considering making it again for the weekend!  Very refreshing. I used sugar instead of Splenda.  The fresh mint really makes this salad exceptional.

Delish! I didn't have splenda or mint. Substituted 2 packets of Stevia and dill to taste. OMG!

So refreshing and a great way to use garden fresh mint and tomatoes. I used regular sugar.

Very refreshing and flexible. Used regular sugar instead of SPLENDA and it was great. I will be making this with fresh basil on Italian night, with oregano on Mediterranean night, and with dill on fish night. Gotta love a recipe like this!!! All those cucumbers from our garden will find a home besides the pickle jar this year.

I really liked this salad. It would go perfectly with simple BBQ chicken or pork. I only had a teensly bit of red wine vinegar left so I filled out the rest with cider vinegar and it still tasted great. Will make again, good way to use up fresh mint!

It's nice with cilantro too.  I tried it when I didn't have fresh mint on hand.

This was a refreshing salad that we really enjoyed.  I used sugar instead of Splenda and I added crumbled feta cheese to the top.  Definitely like the mint addition, although I used chocolate mint from my garden and I think next time I will use the regular mint from the store...chocolate mint was not "minty" enough for my taste.  You could also easily substitute fresh dill in place of the mint.  Simple salad I will be making all summer long!

Out of this world. Make sure you remove all seeds in cukes and tomatoes. Ok that evening, but so much better the next day. Making this for Labor Day weekend. Good the first day, but being able to make it a day ahead GREAT!

Very nice!  Only had 1/2 a cucumber so I had to scale recipe WAY down, but it turned out perfectly for hubby & I.  Light and refreshing.

This was a lovely, light salad;  I served it with an Indian dish of fish in a yogurt sauce and a mushroom rice.  I used grape tomatoes and left out the salt.  This was the perfect accompaniment to an Indian-inspired meal.  Thanks!

Made this tonight for a special dinner for my brother. I served it with Black Beans and Yellow Rice, Rotisserie Chicken and French Bread. Everyone loved it. I did make a couple of changes though.Used a Lg. red onion. Left the mint off and added Oregano and Mozzarella Pearls. Also left the salt off due to needing it to be low sodium. Will be making it again for Labor Day.
