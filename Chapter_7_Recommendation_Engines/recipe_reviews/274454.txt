Drained the diced tomatoes as recommended, which made a nice sauce for the pasta. Didn't have penne so used rotini, which held the sauce really well! Omitted the salt - it didn't need it!  Next time I will add capers as well. Also think I may use EVOO instead of butter...healthier!

Not the prettiest of dishes but it was full of flavor. A couple of things I didn't like is that there was way too much liquid so it lost its sauciness. I recommend draining the diced tomatoes. The other thing is that there is way more "sauce" than chicken so I really think it would be better served over pasta instead of on its own. Overall great flavor though and one I would make again with the changes I mentioned.

I am not a cook. Most of my recipes are disastrous no matter how hard I try. This recipe was perfect. My husband had two servings which is rare for him. Thank you.
