AWESOME SOUP!! While browning the italian sausage, I added the celery/carrots/onions, which slightly sped up the cooking process and used (the wonderfully convenient=my personal favorite) pre-shredded/pre-packaged coleslaw mix.  I had to add a little more liquid (I just added additional water) as it started to get a little too thick towards the end but the taste was spectacular!! A few family members garnished with some shredded cheddar cheese over each bowl. Would make again and highly recommend!! Thanks Behr for sharing this recipe! Perfectly satisfying!!

This has become a staple in my house and now both my brother-in-laws make it as well. We always season the soup with red pepper flakes and sometimes other italian seasongs...but never without the red pepper!

I doubled the amount of sausage (I used spicy instead of sweet) and added red, yellow and green peppers and onions when the sausage was almost done browning. Before I added the celery and carrots I pulled half the mixture out to make sandwiches with for tomorrow. I did not add the pasta and used tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes. Oh so yummy on these cold winter days.

Was only fairly tasty - so I zipped it up a bit with some herbs and seasonings.  I would advise against cooking the pasta in the soup as the residual starch makes it too thick.  Continue to simmer the soup while cooking  pasta in a separate pot. Obviously drain pasta before adding to soup.  Also, since we have our own herbs, I used a good bit of fresh basil leaves, parsley and even a bit of rosemary- and it was fabulous.  Decided to use the mini farfalle (bow ties) considering that the tomatoes were huge already. Next time I will use diced tomatoes instead as well.  Everything is easier to manage with bite sizes when eating soup.  Serve with crusty Italian bread and real butter. Great comfort food on a cold day. :)

It's a VERY TASTY soup! But, be aware that if you're not going to consume the entire pot of soup in one sitting, consider separating out the pasta for storage or it will absorb most of the liquid and you'll be left with gigantic mushy pasta and little broth.  Would have given 5 stars otherwise. Unfortunatey, I didn't have cabbage so I substituted fresh spinach leaves, added at the last few minutes just to wilt it.  This helped maintain the bright green color and was a fine alternative.  Satisfying meal.

I loved this soup!   I made it for my husband and daughter, and they both agreed that it was great.   This is what I added to the soup, though:  1 clove garlic, finely minced (sauteed with the onion), 1 cup corn, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 4 tsp salt, a few twists of freshly ground black pepper.  Oh, and I used 12 oz. chopped Polish sausage because I had no Italian sausage. I just sauteed it in 2 Tbsp of olive oil.   I did not use any garlic salt.

Outstanding for a cold winters day.  I too used spicy sausage, substituted beef for chicken broth, used elbow mac (only thing I had on hand), threw in a small piece of parm cheese rind, then served with shredded parm cheese on top.  Hubby (who rarely enjoys soup) loved.  Very nice - thank you for recipe.

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!  I followed the recipe with only one change.  I only had a 14 oz can of whole tomatoes, so I used that and added a small can of tomato sauce.  Everyone loved this soup.  Thanks.

Excellent flavour.   If reheating leftovers, the macaroni gets very mushy and falls apart - perhaps cook separately and add to each individual bowl.

Absolutely delicious exactly as the recipe is written.  One note for the less experienced cooks like myself... Mash the whole tomatoes before you add them so you don't have to fish around for them after all the ingredients are added.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this soup.  It's a keeper.

This soup was excellent and only gets better the day after.  I substituted Trader Joe's spicy Italian chicken sausage and wheat noodles to make it healthier, and it was great.  I also followed others' suggestions of adding 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, a bit more salt & pepper, and spinach instead of cabbage (added at the last 5 min).  I also used two 32oz boxes of chicken broth and the extra liquid did not thin out the taste, but did give me more soup.  This was so fast, so good, and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks Behr!

This soup was phenomenal!! I used beef broth because its all I had, it was great even as left overs. I made it in the slow cooker so it was even easier to prepare than the directions and it turned out great! I think the next time I might try rice instead of the pasta because it had fallen apart and was mush by the time we ate it. Great soup! Thanks for the recipe!

Delish! So quick and easy! Altered the recipe due to what I had on hand. I had beef smoked sausage,onions, 14.5 oz can stewed tomatoes, 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes with juice, chicken broth, italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, garlic, onion, chicken stock, 3 cups of egg noodles, celery salt, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, cabbage and potatoes. Next time, I will follow the recipe exactly. :) Thanks so much for sharing. This is a keeper.

This was outstanding.  The only thing I did differently was to start I heated up olive oil in the pot and used lots of real garlic.  I'd also add in more broth.  Great for several days.

This soup came out great with a few changes: beef broth instead of chicken, omitted the cabbage, used diced tomatoes (what I had on hand), and added some rosemary, parsley and black pepper. I also cooked it in a crockpot (low for 6hr) and kept the pasta separate so that I could freeze any leftovers. Tastes great!

This soup is AMAZING! It's very easy to alter this recipe to your taste. I did a few things to change it up. I added more cabbage and less celery than called for. I found I needed to add more chicken broth to make it a soup. I used diced tomatoes and spicy sausage, added some diced garlic and garlic powder. I also added some rosemary. Yum!!!

This is a soup that not only tastes great, but looks great and smells wonderful. I didn't change a thing, and probably won't the next time I make it. It's the perfect soup for a cold winter's day.

Wow - so yummy and easy! I followed a suggestion that I read in which the author included red, yellow, and orange peppers with the rest of the soup, and my friends and I loved it! I did not include the pasta - my roommate can't have gluten - and it was just fine. Delish with crackers and some parmesan cheese on top :)

Mmm so delicious! I served this at a small New Years gathering I hosted and it was a huge hit! I did make a couple modifications though. I put in 2 cups of cabbage rather then 1 1/2 and took out the celery which gave the soup a much more interesting texture. Also I used 6 1/2 cups of broth to balance out the veggies more. Amazing soup, very easy to make and tastes great reheated ;)

This soup was awesome.  We ended up adding some chopped green chile, which gave it a nice spice.  The soup was savory and delicious, and easy to make.  I'd highly recommend this!

This got such rave reviews that I went ahead and doubled it because I had alot of  Italian sweet sausage to use up.  My family has decided that they prefers hot sausage in just about everything.   I have to say I was very disappointed.  It was extremely bland.  I don't know what I did wrong.  The sausage didn't seem to flavor the broth and in an effort to get it to do so I ended up cooking it on low for hours.  I added pizza sauce, hot Italian sausage that I cooked separately, crushed red pepper flakes and 4 cloves of garlic.  It helped a lot but I still don't see what everyone is raving about.   I didn't dare add pasta because I think that would have marginalized the flavor even further.  Update:  I originally gave this 3 stars because the broth became more flavorful with my alterations.  Unfortunately, cooking the sausage for so long, while making the broth more flavorful, made the sausage tasteless and mealy.  I think that the sausage is the problem and would probably resist any soup recipe calling for sausage in the future.

This was delicious.  I used turkey sausage and replaced the cabbage with zucchini.  I also used organic diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. Light, but hearty, and very tasty.

Delicious! I added chopped green/red/yellow pepper and fresh sliced mushrooms. Used hot Italian sausage instead of mild. And replaced the whole tomatoes with 2(14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with garlic and basil. I cooked the macaroni separately and added it to the soup in the individual servings.

Pretty tasty! My advice- use cheese tortellini instead of the Bowtie pasta, add fennel seeds, and use medium size onions or more chicken stock. If you like spicy- use spicy Italian sausage. Yum! :-)

Very tasty! Mine ended up more like a stew than a soup as I added only about 4 cups liquid (I planned it that way). I used beef broth as suggested by others. 

I added 2 lbs sausage, only 1 small can diced tomatoes and used a combo of slow cook rice and orzo (equaling 2 cups). I also added thinly sliced baby zucchini, garlic powder, parsley, black pepper and salt as I did not have garlic salt. I absolutely loved the cabbage on this. 

I know my variations would not have mattered had the base recipe not been great. Thanks for sharing this with us. Can't wait for leftovers tonight!

My ultimate reviewers are my kids, and they liked this one! I used less tomato-a 14.5 oz can of diced... because of a picky kid.  Used one garlic clove minced instead of garlic salt. Lots of flavor, easy and nutritious. We had it with cornbread and a salad, on a wintry night. YUMMY.

I just made this a few days ago.  This soup is awesome.  We like spicy, so I used spicy italian sausage.  I tried to freeze the leftovers for another night...I should have put leftovers in the fridge, because my hubby has asked for it every day this week.  I guess that's what will be for dinner tonight! :-)  Thanks for the great recipe.

This soup has amazing flavor. I did use leeks instead of onion. but other than that I followed the recipe. Love the flavor the cabbage brings. We topped the soup with shredded parm cheese.  Next time I might try stewed tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes.

i tasted  this before i added the pasta and it was a little on the bland side so i added crushed red pepper, onion powder, and italian seasoning. i decided to cook it another 30 mins before adding the pasta and it turned out really great. fresh grated parm on top w/ the french bread recipe from this site made a comforting meal on  a cold snowy day. i will make this again in my slow cooker next time.

This was unbelievably good!  I had to leave out the pasta because my diet won't allow it, so I added a couple extra cans of Italian diced tomatoes and a can of green beans.  I used a pack of pre-cooked zesty Italian sausage which saved time and tasted awesome.  We served it with a generous dollop of parmesan cheese and it was so amazing!  I printed this out and put it in the very front of my cookbook's soup section.  I can't wait to make it for family and friends.

This recipe is delicious as written, but it's also a great base for variations. My favorite way to make this soup is with link andouille sausage browned and sliced into coins. I've also tried red potatoes instead of pasta, chard instead of cabbage, and so forth. This soup is always delicious! As other reviewers have mentioned, the texture the following day is much better if the pasta is cooked separately and added to each bowl when serving.

This is a GREAT soup, I used the italian sausage in the casings.  Put the Sausage in the stock pot with about 1 incah of water, covered and cooked untill almost done.  Cut the sausage in to slices. used the juices from the sausage and the water with the chicken stock for extra flavor. Browned the sausage the rest of the way according to the directions. I used Cheese Tortellini instead of the bow tie pasta. Cooked it with the soup at the end.

This is currently our favorite thing for dinner!  I have tried it with a few other sausage flavors, but Italian is by far the best.  It is a large recipe and lasts several nights!  I used rice noodles to make it Gluten free and the substitute worked out great.

Maybe it was the sausage I used, but this wasn't nearly as flavorful as i'd hoped.

Made as written...but omitted cabbage (I forgot).  Husband enjoyed it more than I did...I felt it needed something but not sure what.

I used the little ball pasta (can't recall the name) and it was excellent.  Almost like a stew.

Surprisingly good and satisfying. I found this recipe while looking for things to do with a bunch of veggies in my CSA box (cabbage).  I did not have carrots so I substituted with a bunch or shredded radishes.  The whole thing was positively excellent (and I am not a fan of Italian sausage nor of cabbage, but this soup really rocked).

I tweaked this with just minor changes based on what leftovers I had on hand.  Added sliced radishes, yellow squash and leftover ground beef and diced baked potato...then some beef broth for more liquid - I think it tastes really great!  Glad I found this recipe!

Very tasty soup! Husband and kids loved it! I did brown the sausage with 4 cloves chopped garlic, omitted the garlic salt, and used frozen zuccini instead of celery.  And used only half of 1 med. sized onion (2 whole onions was too much for me!).

I thought this soup was very yummy! I would suggest using diced can tomatoes instead of whole, and I also added 2 chicken bouillion cubes, 1 teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes, and a cup and a half of frozen lima beans.

A very nice, tasty soup. Will definitely make again. I've used the regular italian sausage, the turkey sausage and keilbasa with it. It works deliciously with all three!

A good tasting soup...  I modified the recipe a little.  I left out the cabbage & basil & I didn't have canned tomatoes so I food processed some cherry tomatoes & added some left over tomato sauce.  I grated some Locatelli cheese to sprinkle on top when serving.  Next time I might try adding white canellini beans.

I added zucchini and sweet red pepper. This was a hardy, delicious soup that we'll be making often this winter. I'll probably add a little more sausage next time.

This is one of the best soups I've ever eaten store bought, restaurant, or homemade. I agree with others to add more seasonings. I don't like the taste of basil but I loooove garlic! So I did 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp parsley, 1 tsp. garlic salt, 1 tsp. garlic powder, and a dash of rosemary. I found the combo really nice! Flavorful without being too much. I don't think the recipe said this, but I sliced the sausage into little "coin shaped" pieces. I cooked all veggies listed plus added 2 green zucchini and in the last 10 mins of cook time added 1 bag of spinach as well. I think if you are going to cook carrots and zucchini all the way through, it is necessary to cook the soup more like 20 mins. Boil for 10, simmer for 10. This works out well because it gives you a chance to make some garlic bread to go with! Also, if you like lots of broth, you may way to add 3 more cups of chicken broth but again that depends on your preferences. AMAZING soup! I will definitely be making this on a regular basis!

We just had this for dinner tonight and now have a new soup that we like!  I made a few changes, but mostly stuck to the main recipe as a guide.  We used rotini in place of the bowtie, I dislike celery so we skipped that, and I didn't have cabbage onhand, so we skipped that, too.  I also used a roll of regular breakfast sausage, some diced garlic in place of the garlic salt and some ground black pepper, cooked the sausage into crumbles, then drained it well.  Also, I wanted to note that the rotini pasta took about 15 minutes, instead of 10.  And topped the finished soup with some shredded parmesan.  Delicious!

Just a few changes... I didn't have canned tomatoes so I added about 4 or 5 fresh chopped tomatoes. This was delicious!  My husband, daughter and I all loved it.  Very filling and its just a good soup!  I will definitely be saving this and making it again!

This soup is excellent!!  I added a red bell pepper to this.  I also added diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes, and I didn't have any tomato sauce (like some others added) so instead I added a can of tomato paste.  Tastes great!!

I enjoyed this very much-made a great fridge cleaning dinner.  I used 2 hot italian sausages, and two cooked bratwurst, one head of cabbage, an onion, and essentially a can of crushed tomatoes.  I sprinkled in hot peppers and cinnamon, with a dash of creole spice.  Very yummy--crazy yummy, really!

This soup was excellent. I had 3 hungry construction workers over for supper (as well as my family members) and everyone enjoyed this soup. I didn't have bow tie pasta so I used spiral pasta instead. Also, I added 2 cloves of minced garlic in with the onion, Celery and Carrot step. It was delicious. I will definitely be making this soup again.

This was a wonderful soup and fits with the cold winter chill months starting to make their way towards us.  I substituted the cabbage for zucchini and added two teaspoons of Indonesian Hot Pepper Sauce for some extra zing.  Perfect!

This is a really good soup. I have made it a few times and always add whatever vegetables I have on hand that need to be used. I also always add cheese torttelini (sp?) instead of the bow tie pasta.

This is wonderful.  I had extra carrots, celery and onions from another soup I made.  This was an excellent choice.  I made it exactly as stated-no substitutions.  I will definitely make it again.

Delicious soup! This could easily become a "comfort food" favorite in our house. I added fresh garlic and romano cheese to it and it came out excellent!

This recipe was extremely disappointing.  I followed the recipe and made the suggested additions in other reviews, but it just didn't work for us.  The soup had a nice substance, but the flavor was flat.  Since we did not want to waste the soup, we dumped a jar of salsa in to liven it up.

this soup was good, not great but good.  It was a bit bland for my liking but my children loved it. I chopped the cabbage so fine my children thought it was onion (which they love), if they had realized it was cabbage they would not have even tried it. I used precooked mild Italian sausage, perhaps fresh sausage would have helped it not be so bland. I also used fresh garlic (3 cloves), fresh tomatoes (3 1/2 cups chopped) and added 3/4 c white wine. I wish I has used fresh basil as well. I will definately make it again.

Absolutely delicious! Made this recipe gluten-free by using 2 cups of brown rice spaghetti (broken into short pieces). Added 3 cups of chopped yellow zucchini (It was one large zucchini that had to eaten). I had 2 types of sausage in the fridge - Spicy Chorizo and lamb & Rosemary sausages. Both went into the soup and the results were very yummy!

Great recipe, very savory. I did use scallions instead of onions, that is what I had on hand. Also, did not have tomatoes so I threw in a can of classico spicy tomato sauce. Turned out perfect!

Awesome soup!  I only had ground sweet sausage, so I used that instead.  I think next time I make this, and I will, I will use mezze or mini penne instead of bowtie, as it will stand up a little better.  The recipe says "serves 6".  Six elephants???  But I was glad for the leftovers!

Didn't have the right shape noodles, used what was on hand. Not sure if its because of the noodles used, or if thats how its supposed to be. But my noodles were too mushy. Next time I will cook for a shorter time.  Also, I found that salt is a must.

This was delish.  I changed and added a few things.  I added about 2 teaspoons minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  I also added parsley, oregano, red pepper flakes and Italian seasonings.  I had some yellow squash which I chopped.  I didn't put any celery in.  I also used tomato sauce as well as stewed tomatoes.  I used smoked sausage, cut into 1/2 inch pieces.  We loved it, it is now a favorite.

I absolutely loved this soup.  I did make two l changes.  I omitted the cabbage because I forgot to get some from the store, but I will make sure to get some next time.  And I used fresh garlic because that is something I always have in the house.  Very enjoyable on this brisk fall day.  And it was very quick to throw together.
This seems like a very versatile basic recipe, and would be tasty with any combination of substitutions (change up the veggies, beef or chicken broth would probably both be fine, add some herbs or spices, you could even change the type of protein used).

I made a vegetarian version of this using vegetable broth and vegetarian sausages.  I added quite a bit of extra water because it seemed more like a casserole than a soup.  It turned out delicious and everyone in the family ate theirs.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Just a wonderful, easy soup!  I used a smoked kielbasa sausage as thats all we had.  Still turned out great.  I also threw in a handful of soup beans at the beginning for more substance.  Hubby still raving over leftovers!

This soup had a combination of ingredients that really complimented each other. My husband loved it! It's hard to make really good soup, so this was a pleasant surprise!The second time I made this it tasted ten times better and it was already good to begin with. We "kicked it up" a little and added hot Italian sausage,garlic, and a few other spices we love. I change my mine and give this a 5!

I used a hot Italian sausage made locally at Costanza sausage. I used a medium onion and 2 bunches of green onions 4 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups vegetable stock and a can of crushed tomatoes. I followed all other ingredients and directions and it was fabulous. We had it for lunch and we’re going to have it for dinner too.

this soup was really good. i made it last night and put it in the crock pot. I browned the Italian sausage first. the only changes I made I added one bell pepper instead of one of the onions.  instead of whole tomatoes I added 2 cans of dieced tomatoes one of the can of tomatoes had green chillies.
I left out the basil and added a bay leaf after soup was done. I took out the Bay leaf. I cooked my noodles separate and the noodles to my bowl. 
I will make this again

I'll make this again! Didn't have cabbage, so did as someone else suggested and used spinach--a bag of frozen spinach added near the end. Used ditalinin pasta cooked separately i stead of bow tie. Used one can diced, and one can stewed tomatoes that I cut up with my kitchen scissors, because that's what I had on hand. I should have sauteed the veggies longer, but the soup was delicious!!

Outstanding! Thanks to over reviewers, I added a chopped red pepper and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Grated Parmesan topped it off wonderfully. Will definitely make many times this winter. A great way to use veggies with some pizzaz.

I do not use pasta, ever. Even so, the seasoning in this soup was adequate. I used cauliflower pearls instead of pasta. Did not use celery because I forgot. I also used grass-fed loose sausage. I also added worcestershire. I know, I know, people hate when you review but change. The dish was still a good starting point.

This is good.  I used half of the pasta and added an extra cup of broth.  Also used fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt.

Awesome recipe! my family loved it. although I used bell peppers, didn't use the tomatoes or pasta. I preferred it that way. I also used spicy sausage instead. it's yummy! will definitely make it again.

This recipe is awesome. The only thing that I changed was leaving out the celery because I didn't have any on hand. Also, I used preshredded coleslaw mix, saved lots of time. I will make again.

I omitted the celery and added an extra cup of water along with oregano and parsley. It came out really well and instead of bow tie pasta I used Ruote or Cartwheel pasta.

Yes, will make it again. I didn't make any changes, but it's the kind of dish where you could easily do so either to taste or if you're missing an ingredient.

This soup had the best flavor! It's a keeper!! Had this tonight and it was a hit with the whole family.  I reduced the onions to one and used real garlic cloves instead of garlic salt. I'll be making it again.

I added a pound of spicy sausage, sliced (with casings removed); substituted chopped kale for the cabbage and used canned petite diced tomatoes with chilies.  Some additional spices made this an amazing soup.  I served this at our last dinner party and everyone loved it!

We loved this. I make a lot of soups but this was a bit different than what I've made before. I did add fresh garlic and used diced tomatoes and added about   14 oz additional tomatoes and 1 c. Extra chicken broth. Then I added the mini farfale and it was perfect. It actually had more broth to it than it looks in the pic. Great recipe. Adding it to our favorite soups!

I made a huge amount of this recipe on my first time trying it for my family & our neighbor's. It was super easy & tasted great. I hate leftovers (husband normally eats them up) but I enjoyed several bowls of this recipe. Very much a comfort food. Loved it & will make it again. Good luck making it your own. :)

Had celery carrots and Italian sausage on hand and it was a snowy night. Didn't use the cabbage since we didn't have any so added a little more pasta.  My 6 and 8 year old loved it and gave it the 5 stars!  The adults loved it too.

This is a keeper. I'd say I made it as is, but I didn't. I used tortellini instead of bowtie pasta and cooked it separately as many have suggested. I added real garlic and regular salt and used fresh basil instead of dried. I have to say that the basil really made a different to the broth. I also used diced tomatoes and tomato sauce that I canned and a couple of pepper pellets I made from roasted peppers pureed and frozen in muffin tins (and later moved to freezer bags) and also added zucchini, because why not. I can't wait to eat it again tomorrow.

I made this soup yesterday and I love it!  Love at 1st taste.  I did not change a thing...keep the org recipe. I did buy ground It sausage and made small meat balls. I really didnt want to use the links.  It was perfect. You could also use any type of meatball really. I cant wait to make it again.

Overall, I liked this soup; the textures and flavors came together nicely, the whole apartment smelled lovely while it simmered, and it provided that sense of hearty satisfaction you hope for with a wintery soup. I can't give it five stars because it seemed to require a lot of modifications; the original recipe would be severely lacking in flavor. Here are the changes I made, based on our own personal preferences... I used a combination of spicy Italian chicken sausage and turkey meatballs for the meat to add flavor and reduce calories. I added the better part of a carton of sliced baby bellas when I put in the onions (1 white, 1 red). I added a little extra tomato sauce, greatly increased the basil, and added salt, garlic powder, chopped garlic, onion powder, cayenne pepper flakes, paprika, and poultry seasoning blend. I also added some red wine vinegar with the pasta, and towards the very end I included frozen corn, fresh spinach and several tablespoons of creme fraiche. I know I deviated a lot from the original, but I was very happy with the end result!

I was planning to make sausage, peppers and onions for dinner since I had some leftover sausages from the day before, but I thought a nice soup would be perfect for such a cold and windy winter day.  I googled "sausage soup" and this recipe came up.  I had all of the ingredients on hand, so I made it.  I'm glad I did.  I sliced the sausages thinly, an obvious step I guess, but not on the recipe.  I sauteed them in olive oil and made the rest exactly as the recipe calls for.  The results were outstanding.  I served it with some homemade bread and with the garlic salt on the side.  Delicious.

Good recipe. I followed the recipe except that I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, and cooked the pasta separately. I think that soup improves with time, so I prepared it with everything except the pasta earlier in the day and let it mellow. Near serving time, I added the pasta and cooked until hot. It was easy and very flavorful. I will make this again.

Delicious! I made it without pasta and used chicken sausage and fresh basil and parsley from the garden, with a few red pepper flakes as suggested by others.

This is my family's favorite soup. I make it with smoked sausage instead of italian sausage (tried it with italian the first time & it was good but smoked is 100x better) I also put in a can of corn at the end instead of cabbage just because I know my family will eat. They also don't like the chunky tomatoes so I usually substitute tomato sauce instead. I have put zucchini in this soup too & it was delish. With this soup you can afford to change out the vegetables for whatever your family prefers & it will still be amazing!

Very nice. I used 2 (14 oz) cans of diced tomatoes. One was a fire roasted tomato and the other a diced tomato with fennel. I also added some extra fennel seed and dries thyme leaves to the soup for more flavor. I did not add the pasta at all. This was hearty enough without the pasta and I was trying to keep this low carb. Very tasty with some pecorino romano cheese on top. Thanks!

Fantastic recipe! Even my seldom-adventurous brother had three bowls! I didn't have any canned tomatoes, so I substituted tomato sauce. Instead of garlic salt I added a clove of minced garlic. Just for kicks I also threw in red kidney beans.

This was amazing. I used sodium free broth, and sauteed some garlic with the vegetables and left out the garlic salt. Otherwise I didn't change anything, it was soooo good! I would recommend simmering for at least a half hour after adding the tomatoes.

Just finished making it and wow it's pretty amazing! I've never made a soup with sausage and cabbage before and they go really well together especially on a fall day.  I did spice it up quite a bit because I didn't need to make it kid-friendly. I added about 5 cloves of minced fresh garlic, about two tsp of chili powder, dashes of oregano, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, as well as more galic powder... I like garlic. :) I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Next time I think I don't need to use as much sausage or at least do half turkey sausage to cut down on the calories. But very easy, very quick and stores well. 

Thanks!

This was really good the first time so I'm making it again today. The only change I make it just to add A bit more heat. Other than that "if it ain't broke don't fix it".

I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and put extra shreadded cabbage into the mix.  Added a can of corn and left out the pasta....  Excellent soup... Next time I'll put in an extra pound of sausage.....
