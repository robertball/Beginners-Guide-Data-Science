Substituted pepper jack for the cheese and I loved this salad. I do think it needed more of a dressing other than just the drippings but other than that this was perfect.

I increased the cumin to 1/2 teaspoon and included bell pepper chunks to the veggies before roasting.    I agree with another reviewer that additional dressing would be helpful so I used some good salsa instead of an oil based salad dressing.  Yum!

So easy. I just marinated the meat with my Sunday meal prep so all I had to do was cut the tomatoes and onions and bake it. Made it a quick 25 min meal.
I wasn't able to find the flank steak so I used some thin cut ones and lessened the broil time
YUM!
