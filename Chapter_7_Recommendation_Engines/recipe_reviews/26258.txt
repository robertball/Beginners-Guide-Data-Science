This recipe is really delicious. I have to say this is relatively simple. I'm 18 and I don't exactly know how to cook. However my parents are away at the moment so I cooked this for 5 of my siblings. They love it too!

I gave this a 4 star because I seriously think that it contain WAAY TOO MUCH BUTTER! I think 1 cup of butter is all you need for cooking the fettuccini and the chicken. I'm finding ways to make the chicken have more flavour though.

This turned out kind of gritty in my opinion and a little too cheesy if you ask me, but cheese lovers like my boyfriend thought it was delicious.  I probably would've added some more chicken too to help balance the noodles out.

I cooked the chicken with some minced garlic and substituted fat free ricotta and reduced fat parmesan chese. There was a slightly grainy texture, but it wasn't a big deal. There was plenty of sauce, and I was told it heated up well the next day.
Overall, it was a wonderfully rich dinner, though if I was making it for someone who didn't love cheese as much as my boyfriend and I, I would likely reduce the amount of ricotta. I will be making it again!

I fed this to my husband and 2 other Marines and they LOVED it.  It tasted JUST like the Crab Alfredo from Red Lobster, only with chicken.  Maybe next time I'll try it with crab meat.  The only bad part is it is REALLY fattening, but good for an occasional treat.

This recipe is so good and so easy I now use the sauce as my base to many, many recipes.  I saut√© veggies and make primavera, or I add broccoli to make a one pot meal.  This is a versatile, versatile recipe and my guests always love it no matter what I do.  It is so fast I can make it without missing too much of the party!

Nearly a five star... Bonus points for ease!  Sauteed the chicken in olive oil and seasoned with basil and garlic.  Halved the sauce, using one stick of butter, part skim ricotta, lots more (Asiago & Parmesan blend) cheese, and seasoned with nutmeg, Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle, parsley, red pepper flakes and loads of pepper.   Those who had a problem with "Grittiness" didn't cook the sauce long enough.  (I actually boiled mine for a couple minutes).  Next time I will add broccoli.

This was pretty good but I had to make some changes as I felt it would have been too bland otherwise.  I seasoned the chicken with lots of spices and then I cooked the chicken in olive oil and garlic.  Then I took the chicken out and cooked the sauce in the same pan, added the chicken back to the pan with the sauce and when the noodles were done put the noodles in the sauce.  I didn't use cream but whole milk and it was still very yummy!.

This is my favorite recipe from this site.  The flavor of the sauce is different, and thicker than most Alfredo's, but I LOVE it.  Anyone I've made it for has enjoyed it also.

Not the greatest thing ever. I had to dump a lot of garlic and salt into it to give it any flavour at all. Another reviewer commented that it's grainy and it is, but you can't avoid that with ricotta. I didn't care for it but I'll give it three stars because my husband said it was okay. I won't make this again.

I made this the first time and was very bland.  The second time I made this I cooked the chicken in olive oil and sauted a clove of garlic with the chicken.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and some red pepper flakes, and it was definetly not bland this time. Will make again with the above modification.

When I first read the recipe, it sounded so good to me. I absolutely love ricotta cheese and thought that it would be a great addition to the alfredo sauce. I followed the recipe exactly, only added some garlic with the chicken. But I could not get the sauce smooth and creamy like an alfredo sauce should be. The sauce had an okay flavor even if it was a bit bland. But when I put it mouth, it felt like someone had poured sand into the sauce when I wasn't looking. I had tons of leftovers, but couldn't even bring myself to eat them because of the texture. For me, the texture was a deal breaker. Alfredo should be smooth and silky, not gritty.

It was much tastier than most alfredo sauces I've had in restaurants, but it still wasn't quite what I was looking for. The recipe didn't call for any spices; I salted, peppered, and herbed mine up (but forgot garlic). I'd add garlic next time and more parmesan, less ricotta, and it might just be perfect.

This was very tasty, but I did need to add a little salt and a lot of garlic (about 3 cloves of fresh crushed & chopped) for it to taste like alfredo.  I don't understand why people say it's too bland.  I know people have different tastes, but the #1 rule of cooking is "taste as you go" so you can adjust accordingly.  If you follow this rule, there's no way for almost anything, especially sauces, to be bland.

If you are having trouble with curdling, here's what's happening: you are cooking it too long/too hot.  The curdling is NOT from the ricotta but from the cream.  I know because I had a stroganoff curdle on me a while back.  If you let the mixture boil, chances are it will curdle by the end.  If you see little boil bubbles on the surface, remove it from the heat for a minute or two, stir constantly, and maybe lower your stove a little bit.  Also, it's done pretty much the moment it is well integrated and smooth.  If you cook it longer, even a few minutes, it can curdle then also.  You can always add salt/pepper/garlic/etc after it's off the heat.

Next time, I think I will quarter everything - there ended up being WAAAYYY too much sauce for one box of pasta.

The Ricotta is a weird addition to this dish, didn't add much except in grainy consistency, and that I'd rather not have. Stick to just parmesan and I think it would be better. Also, a cup and a half of butter?!? I used less than half that and I still found it too buttery.

It wasn't very good. It was dried up, gritty and no flavor. It was a little better after adding onion powder, garlic and lots of salt.

It was okay. The sauce came out liquidy and grainy. The taste wasn't bad either. I used a garlic and herb fettucine, which made a huge difference. I'll try to tweak this recipe until it comes out perfect.

It looks NOTHING like that picture. The taste is AMAZING. The texture is very gritty! I don't normally like Alfredo, but this I love!
It was so easy my 12 year old son was able to make it for his friends!!

The texture was wrong, more like a baked ziti-afredo with all of the ricotta cheese.  No matter how much I heated the sauce, it remained grainy.  Based on suggestions by others', I used half the ricotta and 1.5 lbs of chicken.  It calls for way too much butter too.  The final product was just OK.  Edible, but I wouldn't make it again.  Even after I added roasted peppers, garlic, and various herbs, it was actually still quite bland.

I made this a couple of times following the recipe to a T (adjusting only for smaller portions). But after trying the similar recipe Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo on this site I've tried seasoning it a little bit more, reducing the butter content, and using the part-skim milk ricotta cheese. I also saut√© the chicken with fresh garlic, salt-pepper, and Italian seasoning. It still turns out perfect and never disappoints. This is my favorite Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo recipe - I will never loose it this recipe.

Just tried it tonight with high expectations and was really dissapointed. The sauce made it gritty and it was too thick and rich with cheese. My father-in-law asked me if I made it with cottage cheese (which I can thankfully say, no I didn't get them mixed up, I fllowed the recipe exactly and used ricotta) just to give some of you out there a better idea of what I mean.

My family loved this recipe. We added a 16 oz. bag of frozen broccolli in mix. I boiled the broccolli seperately and added it together at the end for about 5 minutes. It was fabulous.

This dish was tasty, but I didn't like the grainy gritty consitency the ricotta gave it. My family liked it, but I'll be looking for another Chicken Alfredo recipe.

I made this tonight for dinner and we loved it! I will definitely make this often. I used only one 16 oz. of the ricotta and that was plenty..

The pasta was good, but didn't quite have the traditoinal fettuccini flavor.  Perhaps some more Parmesan and a little less Ricotta would have done it.

Just tried this recipe for the first time.  Delicious!!  The only complaint that I have is that the ricotta cheese seemed to make it appear a bit grainy but the flavor rivals any that I've ever had anyplace and that includes upscale restaurants.  My kids are both picky and they enjoyed it very much.  Highly recommend.

Creamy and Delicious! This recipe is more time consuming than opeing up a jar of alfredo sauce but if you are organized and enjoy cooking, you'll be fine. Advice, give yourself a good 30-45 minutes to measure & chop ingrediants and poach your chicken before you begin. Enjoy!

Turned out very well.  My only complaint was too much ricotta so I'll be using half as much later.  I also added mushrooms, minced garlic, and basil leaves when I sauted the chicken.  Very, very nice.

I tried the other chicken alfredo recipe on here that used cream cheese, even though it was more complex it was so much better then this one, this one came out to grainy and it didnt really have much taste, I had to add alot more salt and then I added garlic salt and grated a stronger white cheese to give it some taste, I will not make this one again.

This was a good starter dish.  We followed the recipe fairly closely, only added some mushrooms and broccoli for texture and to add some oomf.  It was alright.  We had a TON of sauce left over though and decided to use it to stuff jumbo shells the next day.  With some tomatoes, salt & pepper and fresh basil stirred it it made FANTASTIC filling for the shells.  We cooked the shells, stuffed them with the sauce, topped them with cheese and stuck them under the broiler for a few minutes.  Superb!  We'll be making this sauce again, just with the additions of mushrooms, broccoli, tomatoes, chopped fresh basil & pepper, and all of it mushed into jumbo shells instead of topping fettuccini.  So that's why only 3 stars, way too many modifications to make it yummy.

I first used this recipe for a spread we were having for a fellow co-worker's birthday. I was reluctant to try it because of the reviews of so-called "grittiness" of the finished product.

Let me be the first say that this recipe is the BEST recipe for Chicken Alfredo. BEST! The amount of people asking me to make it again is astounding!

It's perfect. Not gritty. It's actually delicious cold! Leftovers are rare, haha!

I thought this recipe was great. Although, you need to use half as much parmesan. Use alittle less salt. I also put a cup of mixed veggies to add alittle somethin to it. Use with wheat noodles! Add some pepper and garlic!

Great recipe! Instead of a traditional Easter dinner this year, my family decided to do a pasta theme. I used this recipe and everybody loved it! Even my "meat and potatoes" brother!!  The only thing I would suggest is adding some fresh, chopped garlic to the chicken in the skillet.

The sauce was too liquidy.  It taked great, but it didn't really stick to the noodles.  Next time I think I'll try less cream.  But it was still a pretty good recipe.

Was pretty good. Cost like 25 bucks for all the ingredients though. Granted I bought them at Sendik's. Personally, I thought there was too much ricotta and butter. Will I make it again?..probably not but it tasted good. I could have just ordered out from a family style Italian restaurant for the cost. If you have the hookup on the ingredients though I wouldn't tell you to not make it....

My son made this for Valentines Dinner for 6. It is delish! Best alfredo I've had anywhere, including any restaurant. It's very rich, cheesy and full of taste! The sauce does have a texture, but that is from the ricotta and parmesan. This is now printed and in my recipe box. :D

I found it to have a grain like texture and lacked that creamy alfredo consistency.  We also thought it was a little bland.  It was very easy to make, but we will not be making it agian.

Taste good, but texture is liquidy, and doesn't reheat well, because of cheese clumping.

To help with the graininess, I would suggest using room temp ricotta to avoid curdling and use a bit less than recipe & add a little at a time; otherwise its not that bad. Thanks

I liked the easiness of it, however, like others have said, too much ricotta. I followed directions exactly as it said. It turned out gritty. I had to soak my pot for days in order for it to get cleaned. I would suggest reducing ricotta and more seasoning! I had to keep adding salt and pepper to get any taste. I'm sorry, but I think I'll be looking for something else next time.

I did like the recipe, but the other reviews are right- the sauce is WAY too bland on its own. The last time that I made this recipe, I added basil paste ( the tubes of basil that you find in most produce aisles), and minced garlic. I also cooked the chicken with onions and green bell peppers before adding it to the sauce, and I have to say that these little modifications made a world of difference.

this turned out really good , also it saves and reheats for really good leftovers. i substituted the ricotta for cottage cheese and it turned out great too,(my grocery store was out of ricotta) you just have to heat the sauce longer if you do this. also if the sauce gets too runny just add flour as needed to thicken it (in small increments)

I didn't care for this recipe. It is my daughter's favorite dish and looked easy--I thought it would be a big crowd pleaser at dinner. Wrong! The ricotta cheese in the sauce just ruined it. I would not make this again. It did not taste like any chicken alfredo dish I ever had.

If you want traditional Alfredo taste, dont make this dish. Ricotta cheese lovers only. maybe use a third of the recommended amount of ricotta and you'd be good

Definitely an unhealthy treat, but full of flavor!  I added pepper to the sauce to change the flavor up.  For the chicken, I breaded it with breadcrumbs mixed with herbs du provence and cooked it in a greased pan (olive oil).  The spices in the chicken really shone through

Not your average Alfredo sauce, mine tasted heavy on the ricotta, even after using a 1/4 cup more parmesan. This isn't necessarily bad, just different. The only downside is ricotta congeals if you let it cool, so it can be a bit difficult to move from container to container if you put it in the fridge. Also, ricotta is not to everyone's taste, so it may be better to go with only ONE container, and maybe sub the rest with a cup of milk. Thank you! :)

This was absolutley awful. It's like putting grits on noodles, and way too much butter and cream.I did suspect that ricotta would make it grainy, but didn't expect it so tasteless and heavy. I have so much leftover now, and since I hate throw away food I put the sauce in the freezer, thought I'll use it in a lasagna. I do NOT understand this rating at all.

it seems like a good basis for fettuccini, it was way too heavy though. too much butter, too much heavy cream, and too much ricotta cheese. i might try it again, but maybe with half of what this recipe asks.

We liked the flavor, but it was pretty gritty.  I halved the recipe and followed it to the letter.  It was tasty, but gritty and it started to get pretty clotted after a few minutes on the plate.  Not going to make again. I suspect that there is something missing in the instructions...

this was fabulous!  being a new orleanian, i had to kick it up a bit spice-wise with some creole seasoning (cayenne, salt, black pepper, thyme, onion and garlic powder--tony chachere's or emeril's essence) and there was none left!

I tryed this recipe and it was very good, did what one of the other reviews said to cut down to one cup of butter and less ricotta cheese, garlic powder instead of salt,but turned out dry, but I added water, that helped a lot, next time, I will try using less pasta, my Husband loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  I will cut down on the ricotta next time, 32oz is a bit much.  I will also add some garlic salt to the sauce instead of regular salt to add more flavor.

The flavor was pretty good according to six of the seven of us, but it was rather grainy. Hubby felt the ricotta was too strong. It is easy to make, and was cooked by a supervised eight year old. Adding garlic to the chicken while sauteeing, as some suggested, is an excellent idea.

Used bowtie pasta and reduced the ricotta down to one container as well as reducing the amount of butter. I added the ricotta slowly and didn't have any problem with grittiness. Added garlic powder as well as black pepper and ground nutmeg. Also used a little EVOO when browning the chicken.

I was disappointed with how this turned out.  The noodles and chicken were great, but the sauce seemed much too grainy.  The taste of the ricotta cheese was good, although it overpowered everything else.  It tasted more like a liquid lasagna.  It definitely did not have a creamy texture that I enjoy in alfredo sauces.  Maybe it will be better as a reheated leftover.  I'd suggest using less ricotta in the future, but I will be looking for other alfredo recipes.

This was a very easy Alfredo sauce. I did make some adjustments. I used a 16 container of ricotta, 8 ounces cream cheese and only one cup heavy cream. I also added one teaspoon of garlic powder. I will be making it again, with the adjustments, of course.

I made several changes to this recipe. I made the chicken as directed but I added fresh chopped garlic and 1 small shallot. I saut√©ed the garlic and shallot first and then added the chicken until done. I used full flavored Philly cream cheese instead of Ricotta and whole milk instead of heavy cream just out of personal preference.  I also added 1/2 packet of Knorr Creamy Pesto sauce mix. I love the flavor it gives to the sauce. After I added the chicken, garlic and shallot and pasta to the sauce mix I added Oscar Mayer real bacon bits for a little extra protein and flavor. Boy did it work! We had to put it away to stop eating it. Probably best pasta I've ever made!

So delicious! I used rotisserie chicken. Also I recommend browning the butter before adding the cream and cheese. I also added one teaspoon minced garlic to the sauce. My husband says it could have used two teaspoons  of garlic but we really love garlic. I also think this recipe would be good with a sweet onion or some spinach but I did not try that.

This is my favorite dish to make. However I mix it up a little, instead of Ricotta Cheese I substitute with 8oz of Cream Cheese. The ultimate trick to this dish not being bland is WHITE PEPPER- very little. its amazing.. Try it.

This went together easy and tasted good.  I added a clove of garlic.  The sauce was just too thick for my liking.
I realize Alfredo is not a light dish but the ingredients were so heavy and I couldnt finish a serving of this.  I will try another recipe.

HOLY RICCOTA!!!   How much riccota?? Not one but 2! 16oz bottles.... it was good.. it was thick WAY to think.. it was bland.. and you MUST add 2 pounds of chicken NOT ONE. You need 2!  I suggest less ricotta, more heavy cream, more Parmesan.. garlic, basil and your favorite spices..

I wouldn't even give this a star. It was absolutely dreadful...waste of money and time. Too much cheese wasn't even creamy. It makes my teeth feel gritty and chalky with each bite. Hoping I can salvage it by adding more cream.

This turned out really good! I made it to spec the first time, but the next time I make it, I am going to make the chicken separately, and pour the sauce over the chicken and the noodles and pasta. Regardless, the sauce was amazing and really easy to make!

Too much ricotta. This cheese does not melt. It is better to use Parmesan and Romano. One dimensional. I tried it because this is a cheaper recipe than the usual. I don't recommend.

Excellent recipe.  My girlfriend and I  did make a few adjustments.  We cut it in half to begin.  I also used about 1/4 cup of milk instead of heavy cream.  Also added 2 tsps. of chopped garlic.  Then we kept the chicken at 1 pound.  Turned out GREAT.  I will make this again

Definitely a keeper recipe with a couple tweeks.  It would have been bland as is.  I added 3 large cloves of garlic (minced)to the butter and cooked it over low heat for a few minutes before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.  I also added some white pepper to the sauce.  I didn't have cream, so I used 2% milk.  The sauce was still very rich.  Only use full fat ricotta if you want a smooth sauce.

Made this for my family for dinner and they loved it.  It is very rich, and very filling........I did however saute some Garlic cloves and asparagus,   It was absolutely delicious.

It was delicious and for a new cooker like me, it was a really easy recipe. It is super cheesy so if you're a cheese lover it's perfect for you!

I made this recipe tonight, and halved the sauce but kept the same amount of chicken. There was so much sauce, I can't imagine what it would have been like if I had made it with the amounts listed! And the sauce....it was bland, had a strange texture, and was much too runny...although I will admit, I used whole milk instead of heavy cream, which I'm sure was part of the issue. I needed to thicken it up a bit, so I whisked in about a tablespoon of flour. If I'm going to indulge in some serious calories, it better be amazing....and this didn't even come close. Sadly, I won't be making this one again.

I added some Garlic Salt for more flavoring, and used room temperature Ricotta cheese to keep it  from clumping and becoming grainy.

This recipe was awesome the day I made it, and even better the day after! I reccommmend adding garlic powder or garlic salt and it has an even better taste, I used garlic salt.

This recipe was amazing!!! It was easy to make and turned out just like something served in a fine dining establishment. I have 4 year old twins and a 2 year old, they couldn't get enough. All plates were cleaned. I will definitely make it again. I added seasonings to taste (garlic & onion powder, pepper & salt). Served with cooked broccoli & garlic bread. It will be hard to go pay money at Olive Garden or Red Lobster now for this when I know I can make it better with this recipe by myself!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

It was rich and flavorful, but regular Alfredo is much better. The ricotta seemed out of place in this dish, and therefore, I'd never make it again.

This was very good.  However, I think it had a bit too much ricotta and was bland.  So I seasoned the chicken well before I sauted in butter.  Family loved!

i think this was a very generous rating of "alright".. made for bf's lunch.. was going for a light one since i didn't have any chicken thawed and was trying to use up the ricotta.. i can see where those who complained about the gritty consistency of the sauce were coming from.. but my major complaint would be that this was on the bland side.. i added some garlic powder and fresh parsley.. im sure bf won't complain but i wouldn't be surprised if he added a heavy shake of S&P

Awful! Gritty sauce and inedible!  There are much better recipes out there. I wish I hadn't wasted the money on these expensive ingredients and made the sauce from scratch using a white sauce with cheese instead! :(

Overall this recipe turned out really good. Not only did we end up making some tasty pasta but also the recipe was very easy to follow. We did end up adding some basil and garlic to the dish, which added some great flavor. The final product really did look like a professionally made dish. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys pasta. The recipe was very simple and easy to follow and it produces very tasty pasta!

We really liked the flavor, but not the graininess.  I made this a second time to make sure I had done it right before, kept cooking it till everyone was starving.  It was less grainy than the first time but still not smooth.  IF I try it again, I'll cut the ricotta and butter in half (I used 1 c butter in the sauce and still had a ring of it floating on the edges).

This recipe is OK.  Does not make good leftovers.  The ricotta cheese adds a very grainy and not-so-saucy texture to it, but I guess that's my fault for not putting two and two together before making it.  Will not use this recipe again.

The flavor is pitch perfect once I added a little more salt and pepper but the quantity of alfredo is TOO much for one pound. I ended up having to cook another pound of fettucini. If I had to make it again I'd use far less quantity of ricotta than the recipe called for.

Chicken Alfredo was pretty good. The sauce was a bit dry but it could have been a fault on my part.  Otherwise, plan on making this again in the future.

Last minute meal, so I had to use cottage cheese that I swirled smooth in the food processor instead of the ricotta. Added 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce also. Loved it! Can use the leftover sauce later since I didn't blend chicken, noodles and sauce all together.  Our 14 yr old said it was "pretty darn amazing!"

I just made this, and I followed the instructions just as they were stated, yet ended with a chunky mess. The ricotta made it lumpy I think, but definitely NOT trying this recipe ever again

I have never cooked Alfredo as I heard that it was rather difficult to make the sauce. Last night tried this recipe and was quite excited about the prospect of being able to make this dish as its one of my favorites.   I have to say this was a very easy and quick recipe. Even with having three pots going saut√©ing the chicken, making the sauce and boiling the noodles, it was easy to keep up with all three.   I did make a couple of additions; four minutes before the pasta was done I added broccoli it and I added minced garlic and onion powder to the chicken while it was cooking.   There was more than enough sauce (just like I like it) to coat the pasta, chicken and broccoli with plenty left over for sopping up with the homemade garlic bread.  The sauce was very good and everything went very well together, however there is one drawback. I found the sauce came out way to gritty for my taste; I like my Alfredo nice and creamy n smooth.  I don‚Äôt know if it was the Ricotta cheese or something I did, or did not do in the preparation of the sauce.   If anyone can offer some advice I to correct this grittiness I would greatly appreciate it as I like the taste of the sauce but not the texture.

This recipe was extremely bland and mine also turned out gritty. There are simpler and better options out there for great chicken alfredo. I didn't find the ricotta to be worthwhile in adding it to this dish. That being said i did use low fat ricotta and low fat parm. That may have taken some of the flavour out.

Great receipe. Cut back on the ricotta cheese. It was a bit too cheesy and really thick. Add a little garlic powder to the chicken when you saute it. Overall, quick and very easy meal that anyone would love!

I just made this recipe for dinner.  We loved it!  After reading reviews of others, I made the following changes:   Cut the sauce recipe in half (there is plenty of sauce), except the parmesan, keep it at a cup or more. The better the parmesan the better it will taste.  I sauted 2 cloves of garlic in the butter before adding the other ingredients.  Just before the pasta finished cooking, I tossed in some fresh broccoli florets. I grilled 4 chicken breasts sprinkled with cajun seasoning.  Mixed the sauce with the drained pasta, broccoli and grilled chicken.  So good!  You can change this up a thousand ways...shrimp, salmon, pork...grilled veggies.     Some complained about a grainy sauce, but I cooked mine for several minutes giving the ricotta a chance to breakdown.  Perfect!   Thanks Gregory!

Very delicious recipe! It tastes like the Fettuccini Alfredo at Olive Garden!! The only thing I did different is add 1 16oz container of ricotta as opposed to 2, and I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I will make this over and over!!!

I did not like this ... I had some ricotta that I needed to use, so I thought this would be good ... the taste wasn't awful, just bland ... but, as several people have said, the texture was absolutely grainy ... I don't know if that was due to the ricotta, the parm, or what, but I followed the recipe exactly ... I don't think there was anything *wrong* with my results ... I just didn't *like* them ... will NOT be making this again, but thanks, anyway ... :)

This recipe was good. The chicken was a little bland, so next time I might try cooking it in garlic. The sauce was nice and cheesy! YUM! At first it seemed to be very watery, but eventually thickened. Also, my fault, but I didnt realize that this recipe made 8 servings and left alot of leftovers. I will definitely cut the recipe in half next time.

I used prepared (cooked) chicken from the supermarket as a shortcut but otherwise followed exactly. I did not feel it had a grainy texture as some said, but I used freshly grated cheese not the dried stuff on the store shelves . My husband loved this. I thought the Ricotta was a great idea and not overpowering at all. So easy too- definately will make again

This recipe was "ok".  It had a very wierd texture to me with the cheese.  I guess it just wasn't what i had in mind.  I was thinking of that "Olive Garden" kind of Chicken Alfredo.  All in all it was edible and my kids ate it so no complaints.

This is sooooo easy and came out really yummy.  A bit of a heavy meal considering the cheese and cream but you can balance it out with whole wheat pasta and fresh parmesan.

My boyfriend and I decided to make this dish one night for his family, and it turned out delicious! I didn't end up using as much cheese, and I'll probably add more chicken next time. Simply delicious!

VERY GOOD. I am 16, and I made this for my family, The sauce was very rich, had no problem with the sauce being grity like others had said. Definatly will be making again, Except next time I will not add the chicken into the noodles and sauce, it seemed like no one had very much chicken. I did add some garlic powder to the sauce along with some salt, gave it more flavor. Very easy to make, and my loved it. Thanks alot(:

My Grand-son requested Chicken Alfredo w/Fettuccini Noodles and never having fixed a recipe like this I was uneasy about doing it.  They were so pleased with this recipe they ate all of it in two settings. I will be fixing this for them again.  Even the 18mo old ate it.

Wow! I made this for my son and his girlfriend for their Senior prom. I normally don't cook like this because of the fat and calorie content, but I gotta tell ya - this was delicious. I did cut down my ingredients some and still had plenty of sauce. I also used skim ricotta cheese. This one's a keeper, especially for a romantic dinner!

Very very good!! I made only half of the recipe since I was cooking for only two people and added a few cloves of garlic to the chicken pan. Served it with garlic bread, my fiance and I loved it. I think next time though I would use about half of the ricotta as it made a lot of sauce.

This was a very good recipe, the only thing to keep in mind is that this makes ALOT of sauce so make sure you either cut the amount of ric/milk & cheese in half (if it's dinner for 2) or make sure you use a very big pot. The only changes I made were that boiled, seasoned then shredded the chicken followed with adding steamed broccoli and mixed everything together with every bite you get a combination of chicken with noodles and broccoli. Definitely a keeper!

This was a wonderful recipe, I took others advice and only used about 18 ounces of the ricotta cheese.  We also cooked the chicken on the grill seasoned with a bit of garlic salt and then cut it up and added to the sauce later. I chopped 4 cloves of garlic and browned it in butter before adding the rest of the ingredients to the sauce and I added the ricotta a little at a time.  It was a tad gritty but definitely a yummy sauce that my family all loved.

I made this last night for my family.  It was alright, but not something I will make again.  Definitely did not taste like alfredo sauce.  I used much less riccota cheese, as recommended by other reviewers, but the ricotta was still very overpowering.  The texture was nice and creamy while it was hot, but as soon as it started to cool, it turned back into a ricotta cheese consistancy.

I didn't find this grainy as others did.  I added the ricotta slowly, and only used 1/2 the amount.  I didn't use all the butter either.  I sauteed the chicken with garlic and olive oil, and also added sauteed zuccini.  My family thought it was good.

This was a hit with my family! It was easy assembly for a working mom. I will take Shelly's suggestion, however, and maybe cut the ricotta in half next time as it was too much liquid. Thanks Gregory!

We didn't like the odd texture or the over-powering taste of the Ricotta cheese.  It never really blended well either..and did I mention the odd texture?

This recipe was ok. I think I'm not a big fan of ricotta cheese so I didn't like the texture. I did add more heavy cream, butter and added some garlic. Probably won't make again.

It was a different kind of alfredo. i added 1/4 tsp of minced garlic & threw in some parsley. the sauce had too much riccotta & was gritty in texture. the riccotta cheese didnt seem to melt well. flavor was ok but couldve been better.
