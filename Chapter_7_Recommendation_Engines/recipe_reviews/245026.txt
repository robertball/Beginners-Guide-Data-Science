Meh - this was not very interesting, even after adding sage, thyme, basil, salt, etc.

I didn't care for this recipe. I made it according to the recipe, but the sauce was really bland, and the pumpkin taste overpowered everything. I tried adding anything I could think of that would give it more flavor - sauteed onions then more garlic, even sauteed mushrooms, and finally some spices, - but that pumpkin flavor remained the single flavor not of the whole dish. Won't be making this again.

this was really good. I added onions when I cooked the garlic. I had some left over cauliflower that I added to it for lunch the next day which went well. I have a ton of sauce left so I will probably roast some more cauliflower and cover it with the sauce.

We enjoyed this recipe!  I used fresh pumpkin puree that was a little stringy so would try blending it with the milk next time in a blender.  I also added some garlic pepper salt and Penzy's  Sunny Paris seasoning.  Smart idea to infuse nutrition in the sauce in this manner.
