Delicious! The second time I made this (to make it more of a “one pot meal”) I added another can of cream of chicken soup and 1 cup each chopped mushrooms and fresh cut green beans. Thanks, Janet, for a great recipe!

I made this with lowfat milk and about 2 teaspoons of tarragon.  The tarragon flavor is still a bit strong (and I love tarragon).  I'm going to add more parmesan to the leftovers and see how it does after the tarragon mingles in the sauce.  I will use a lot less tarragon next time, but the consistency is good.

I was looking for something to make because I had tarragon on hand, and this was simple and good!

I have never had Tarragon before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I used what I could find in the pantry. I used cream of Celery instead of cream of Chicken soup and Mozzerella on top with a bit of Kraft greated parmesan (in the green container) instead of grated Parmesan cheese. And also I was getting sick of using Spaghetti noodles for my pasta dishes so I used Fettucini. I think that the next time that I make it I wont bake it like a casserole, instead just use the tarragon sauce like an alfredo sauce on my fettucini noodles on the side of a chicken breast. But overall it was a fantastic, simple dish that seemed like it would take allot more effort than it truely did. Everyone was amazed with me!

I made this for my mother one night when the kids were gone and my wife and father were working. Between the two of us, we ate about half of it in one sitting. I did most of the eating. 

We did go light on the Tarragon and still tasted it easily. We pretty much halved the amount. My wife suggested substituting other herbs to suit taste.

Our family eats chicken a lot and this was a great variation. The alfredo-like sauce was an easy sell to our finicky kids. We have made it several times since.

This was really good. I used a whole pound of spaghetti though, it seemed like a lot of liquid for a half pound, and it came out very good, plenty moist and gave us leftovers which we find convenient. The only other change I made was to use cream of mushroom soup, I don't care for cream of chicken.  I will probably add onion next time too.

This was great!  I did make a few subs, just because of what I had in the pantry, but I'm sure it's just as good (probably better) with the original recipe.  Instead of cream of chicken soup I used cream of mushroom, I swapped out 1 cup of half and half for milk, used fresh tarragon instead of dried, and I added about a tsp of garlic powder (I can't live without garlic!).  I also added salt, which I found it needed at the end.  
This was so good!  My boyfriend even enjoyed it, and I wasn't sure he would like the tarragon taste. I'm definitely going to make this recipe again - I want to try it with cream of chicken soup next time.

After reading some of the reviews, I made this recipe more as a sauce for chicken and pasta, and not as a casserole. The sauce tasted wonderful, but needed to be a little thicker.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  Next time though, I will cook my chicken with sime garlic and onions before adding to the recipe.  We are BIG fans of garlic.

My third chicken dish from allrecipes.com in seven days and another hit.  This was very easy to make.  This dish plus a salad makes a simple meal to put on the table.  Will make this again.

I first saw this in one of my Taste of Home recipe books. I tried it and my family loved it. I used 99% fat free soup and light half and half. It didn't take long to put together. It's a keeper!

I needed a tarragon dish since a neighbor gave me some, and it turned out good. Put 1/2 the tarragon in though.

This is a great busy day meal.  I cook the chicken using the Moist Garlic Chicken recipe that is also on this site.  This also freezes well.  Reheat at 350 for 35-45 minutes.  I like to keep one of these on hand for others.  New moms, those who have had surgery, etc.

Excellent...company would think this is a "fancy" dish!  So easy to make, too.  I used fat-free half-n-half, whole wheat spiral pasta, and 2 generous tablespoons of chopped fresh tarragon. On the suggestion of another, I reduced the pepper by half as more pepper can always be added by those who like it.  For me, I do not think the 1/2 teaspoon is too much but my husband would.

I sauteed the chicken in olive oil with salt, pepper, salt-free lemon pepper and some garlic powder to taste.  Then I added come chopped up celery and onions to the chicken as it was cooking.  The chicken just really needed a little something.  I also added about 1 tbsp of butter/margarine and I mixed about 1/2 cup of parmesan into the mixture...as well as sprinkled some on top.  This helped.  This was the 2nd time I made it.  It was good the first time but for us, it just needed a little something extra.  I love this idea!  Tarragon!  Was great!!!

I usually love the flavor tarragon adds to dishes. However this was just TOO MUCH! It was soupy, and there was just nothing to balance the overpowering tarragon flavor. I will not be making this again.

I made this just as directed except I added sauted mushrooms. This was very good but, a little dry. Next time I a little extra water to keep it more saucy. Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I like others was not all familiar with Tarragon, but after experiencing this dish, found I like it! I used milk instead of Cream and cheddar cheese in place of Parmesan. I'm looking forward to making this again!

This was just okay for me.  I thought the tarragon was overpowering.  I did like the texture and heartiness of the casserole.  It  needs much less tarragon and some other flavor added that I can't put my finger on to give it more kick.

This is the first time I have ever used tarragon, and I learned that I do not like it!  Even with reducing the amount of tarragon in the casserole to 3 tsp, it was still very strong.  This recipe is not for anyone who does not appreciate this ingredient.

I used fat free half & half as well and it was just fine. Also, I noticed that the casserole tasted considerably better after sitting overnight. Very easy recipe.

I added a small amount of sauted celery and onion.
Which it really needed.  I would use a more substantial pasta next time.

I didn't particularly care for this; the tarragon was too over powering. Easy recipe though. I plan to take the good from the recipe and recreate it without tarragon.

I had never had Tarragon before but I think this recipe called for too much. I made this dish when having my best friend over for dinner w/ our family and we all agreed, a little much. The dish itself also seemed like a lot of work. Won't be making this again but glad I tried it.

Good, quick meal. The only thing I did differently is shred the chicken rather than cubing it.

Really good - I did add a can of green chilis to give it a little more spice - my family loves it!

Made this last night, and was a little dissappointed.  Followed others suggestions and used Fat Free Half and Half, cut back a little on the pepper and tarragon--it was bland.  Maybe I should have left the spices as stated in the recipe? I did add mushrooms, which was a plus...but still not the rich alfredo-like taste I had maybe expected from reading some reviews.  I had a crowd to feed, and there was WAY too much left over.  Have to admit, it was easy to prepare, but don't think I'm going to be trying again.  Thanks tho!

The first time I made this we thought it was just okay and that it had too much tarragon.  I tested it again adding sautéed mushrooms and onions.  I only used 1 cup of half and half, but I added 4 oz. softened cream cheese and 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Topped it w/ a Ritz cracker/butter crust.  We liked it much better!

I love tarragon, so I didn't cut any of that, but if you just like a little bit I can see halving it and still getting great flavor. 
I did however make a lot of changes. I used roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and spiral pasta instead of spaghetti. The chicken, I oven baked earlier in the day with lemon slices and then added about a tablespoon of lemon zest to the mix. Then, because I love cheese, I tossed it all with about 2 cups of shredded mozzarella. It helped thicken it up amazingly well and ultimately was deliciously gooey!cheesy.

So yummy! I sprinkled it with an Italian cheese mix as well as the parmesan. I'm not a huge tarragon fan so I only used 1/2 the tarragon and substituted the rest with basil and oregano. Super easy recipe!

This was so good!  I loved the tarragon and parmesan flavor, and the creamy texture.  I can't wait to try it leftover - I have a feeling it will be even better.
