Followed the recipe as written, the only difference was I used boneless chicken thighs as that is what I had.They did not disappoint, I baked them in the oven and they took 25 min. at 
425 degrees.
They were very tasty and moist, and I will make them again.
 Thank you for another great way to make chicken thighs.
