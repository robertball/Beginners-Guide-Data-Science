This recipe was a lot of preparation!!! I made it for the first time for a party of 12 (the reason being some of them were vegetarians) I had people going back 2 and 3 times for more! I used the fresh mushrooms option with one cup of water and I had way too much liquid so I drained all the veggies and layered the lasagna as directed. Even though it was a lot of work it was worth it - definitely one of the family favorites. I will make it again for sure. My husband raved about it!!!!!

Overall a very good recipe.  I left out the green pepper, and used zucchini, instead.  I also used fresh mushrooms, so I didn't add water to the recipe.  I did find the finished product to be a little runny, but still good.  Angela

Great recipe,  I think next time I'll use more ricotta cheese.  I also used no boil noodles.   To easy!
