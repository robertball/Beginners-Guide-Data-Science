My boyfriend and I loved this.  The only thing I did not like was there was not enough sauce.  My boyfriend LOVES sauce of any kind & he puts it on everything.  So I had to add extra wine, beef stock & cornstarch to make more sauce.  Other than that it was fabulous!!

I made this recipe using venison back strap and increased the portions a little. It was great & my husband loved it. The baby bellas are best & next time I'll try a different variety of wild mushroom. Wild rice is an excellent side dish!

This was delicious!  Like some of the other reviewers here, my boyfriend and I are big gravy fans so I increased the sherry to 1 cup and subbed out the water for 1 cup of beef stock.  Plenty of tasty gravy for pierogies on the side or a heap of mashed potatoes!

This was so yummy!  I have been eating venison all my life so it is difficult to "wow" me with a venison related recipe.  I really enjoy sauce so I added additional sherry, and a bit more water.  For venison lovers such as myself, do not be concerned with what seems to be a long amount of cooking time that is recommended.  The meat was still tender.  Thanks!  We just loved it.

I had to make a few changes based on previous reviews and my own experience, but it was so worth it. This is the best recipe I have found for tenderloins or backstraps. I used 2 pounds of backstraps (to make enough for a family of 4-6), 16 oz. of mushrooms, 1 large onion, and then quadrupled the sauce. Yes, quadrupled (remember, I about doubled the meat). The first time I made this, I doubled the sauce, and had to make more at the last minute. It was incredible. My family and in-laws (all hunters) raved about this recipe even when we ate the leftovers. With these minor changes, this recipe is AWESOME!!!

Best venison recipe yet for any cut - would be good with other meats.  Sherry and butter combine to make a sweet flavorful gravy.  Elk would be even better!  Some changes helped after several meals. Marinate the meat in some sherry.  Double the amount of gravy ingredients - there won't be enough for everyone.  I use a whole onion (white are better) and 8 oz of mushrooms, just for the wife and I with lots more butter. I add onion and garlic powder to flour mix. Portabellas and Baby Bellas have more flavor.  The cooking time is too long for my prefs.  Venison should be medium rare to pink.  Saute the meat on both sides to medium rare and remove.  Reduce the sauce separately and remove from heat, then add the meat without simmering, stir to coat meat and cover the pan till serving.  The Sherry is great, not tried Marsala yet. Thinking same amount of Marsala might be too strong - so add more water and less Marsala.  I add couple teaspoons of the leftover flour from bag to thicken sauce.  Fabulous!!!

This was easy and really good.  Smells amazing while you are cooking it.  Since I was cooking 8 butterfly chops, I doubled the recipe.  I added extra sherry and beef broth instead of water to make more gravy as some of the other comments suggested.  Gravy with onions and mushrooms was good over potatoes too.

Excellent!  I could see using Marsala instead of Sherry to change it up a bit.  6-7 minutes of searing per side seemed too long.

Holy Butter, Batman! It seemed like a lot of butter when I was cooking the recipe. The butter flavor was very noticeable. If I make this again I will use half as much and sprinkle on some salt. This reminded me of chicken marsala, only with red meat. This would probably go well with noodles.

Good recipe overall. Couple things: Do not sear the steaks for 6-7 min on each side. Turn the heat up to high and cook each side just long enough to get it a little brown. It took me maybe 2 minutes total to sear it. Also, we felt that it needed a lot of salt on top of what the recipe calls for. We added a lot of salt after cooking.

The only thing I changed is the cooking time for the venison.  I seared it and then put it back in with the sauce for the last few minutes of the simmer.  It was incredible!

We did not like the flavor of the sherry in this at all.  The sherry was very strong.  It was the first time I've made anything with sherry so maybe we just don't like sherry in our food.  Also, the venison was still a little dry.

Yes, I'd serve this to guests. I don't like game, but this was very good and, as promised, didn't have a gamey flavor.  The ONLY reason I didn't rate this a five star dish, is it tasted like stroganoff, which is boring.

The only thing I differed from the recipe was I used venison shoulder steaks that I marinated over night. I think the recipe has possibility, but in my opinion, the meat was over cooked. I am going to try this again and when I do, I will just brown the steaks. Probably about 4 minutes on each side, and then let them finish cooking during the simmering step. If I make it again, I will try to remember to come back and update this.

This was amazing! I left out the sage, and used elk instead of venison. Scrumptious!

Fantastic!  This is a nice way to fully cook your venison tenderloins without making them too tough.

I made this tonight - WOW! My husband is an avid sportsman so we always have venison on hand, and after cooking it in almost every way imaginable, I needed a change. This certainly hit the spot! I did make a couple changes. Since I didn't have the full 1/4 cup of sherry, I stretched it with a bit of high quality balasmic which imparted a nice sweetness to the dish, and I used tarragon in place of the sage since I was out of that as well. My husband and father-in-law both raved about this dish. Will be serving this again and again!

I did not like this recipe, although I did make a modification.  I did not have sherry so I used Marsala wine instead.  I used shallots instead of Vidalia onions.  There was a VERY strong wine taste!  Not sure if it would have been better with sherry. The meat was very tender though.
