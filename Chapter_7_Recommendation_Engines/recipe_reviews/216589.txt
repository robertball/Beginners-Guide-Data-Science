Let me begin by saying that my family loved this recipe. I thought it was good, but for some reason I felt that it needed something else to give it 5 stars. I added a bit more oil to vegetables b/c they were sticking to bottom of pot, also I added scallops when I put the shrimp at the end. I substituted redfish for the snapper, b/c of price, but everything else I left the same until the end. After I did one last taste test, I added in about 2 tsp of garlic powder and left it that way. Thank you for this recipe.

Hailing from Veneto, and having a home in Puglia, on the Adriatic, Brodetto di Pesce, is a staple holiday and special occasion dish for us. I had just encountered Jason´s recipe this morning, thus, since we are travelling, preparing it would be impossible tonight; however, I am going to prepare with Lobster, on the 31st for New Year´s Eve.
BUON NATALE, MERRY CHRISTMAS, from new member: Margaux Cintrano.

Really awesome recipe! It was so delicious. I was nervous about making it at first because I had never really made a stew before let alone something with this many ingredients, but it came out really tasty. I used swordfish instead of snapper because they did not have snapper at my local grocery store here in St. Louis, MO. I also added short neck clams, and medium size shrimp. I left all the shells on the shrimp and I'd recommend doing this because they were so perfectly cooked, but the downside is that you have to peel them which can be hot and messy. I added some pre-cooked lobster claws as more of a garnish than anything, but they didn't have any raw ones in the store. Instead of white vinegar I used Yellow Tail Chardonnay and it was perfect. I added a little more wine than necessary because I like my broth kind of runny. I used 3 organic bay leaves instead of 2, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Don't omit red pepper flakes. I am scared of spicy foods but just a pinch is enough to give it the necessary flavor and some of the spices cook off. I couldn't really find fish stock but there was something called "seafood broth" in the store so I used that. Clam juice would have worked too, maybe diluted with some water. I added more garlic than needed too. I might experiment next time with other spices but this is a perfect recipe! Use the freshest ingredients possible and follow the directions closely, you will not be disappointed, and there will be many left overs!

Wonderful—something I'd happily order in a restaurant. I had some homemade salmon stock that I wanted to do something special with. I used snapper, clams, and shrimp, and used the variation detailed in the footnote: saffron and white wine instead of pepper flakes and vinegar. Terrific meal.

So, let me first say that this was a pretty big hit at my house. My family loved it. I agree with Suyen below.

I used white wine,  large shrimp,  pacific sea bass and halibut… it was spot on deliciousness!  Trying to decide on what seafood for the next batch!

This is a great dish.  However, the recipe needs modification.  When I made it with Red Snapper ($27 per lb) the fish disintegrated in small crumbles.  Obviously the recipe's 23 minutes of cook time for the fish is WAY TOO LONG!  

Recipes for poached Red Snapper call for cook times ranging from 8 to 12 minutes in broth at a low simmer.  Next time I will use a shorter cook time.
