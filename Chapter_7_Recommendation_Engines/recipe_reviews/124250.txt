Yummy!  I wasn't too sure about the blueberry/rhubarb combo, but I'm glad I tried it!  I don't care for flour in fruit pies, so I used 1/4 cup quick cooking tapioca instead. :) Also less sugar and I added lemon zest to bring out the fruit flavour. This works well with a full top crust too.  I will make this again!

Really good!  I made this two ways.  One, primarily the way it was written with just a touch less sugar and a crust using all-purpose flour, and then with the second pie, I made a mistake.  I used white whole wheat flour for my crust and then on accident doubled both the blueberries and the rhubarb, but not the flour and sugar!  A lucky mistake, though, as we ended up preferring the "accident" pie!...although the filling could have been slightly thicker, since my flour ratio was off.  As the recipe was originally written, it was a little sweet for me and the fruit didn't shine through as much.  Sprinkled both crusts with raw sugar before baking, which I love.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is soooooooooo delicious!  I wasn't even expecting to like it.  I made it for a friend who kept asking for a rhubarb pie.  I happened to have extra blueberries left over and thought this would be a good recipe to use them up on.  I thought it would be too tart but it was absolutely delicious!  The two blend together to make the most amazing flavor.  I used strawberry rhubarb (the good stuff that's red all the way through) and I did an egg wash (egg white, slightly beaten w/about a T of milk & brushed over crust) and sprinkled some sugar on top before baking.  I hope my rhubarb plant has enough left to make this again.

Awesome pie, not a slice left.  A little too sweet though, cut the sugar down next time.

One heck of a great pie.  Nobody could stop at one piece.  If I had taken the time to make a homemade crust it would have been phenomenal.  Easy too!

I used fresh fruit and instead of flour, King Arthur's pie enhancer. It was super delicious!!! The blueberries really went well with the rhubarb. Really a great pie. I also used the pie crust recipe from this site, which was also good.

Yummm............  I tried it, and made three more pies.  As suggested by others, I used double the amount of rhubarb, and blueberries, and only 3/4 cups of sugar.
