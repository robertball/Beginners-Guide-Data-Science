This icing recipe worked SO well - dried hard and kept it's colours. I used a piping bag and various tips and they all held their shape.  It did take more than 2 tsp of milk to make it smooth, more like 2-3 tbsp. I left out the almond flavoring and used vanilla instead.  We frosted 'Soft Christmas Cookies' (from this website) and I was really pleased with the results.  I am going to try it next time with orange or mint extract for a change.

This was quick and easy to make & creates a nice, glossy, hard coating.  However, the recipe, as is, makes enough for TWO dozen 2" x 3" cookies.  I'm not sure why the recipe was written to make so much simple syrup when you only need 2 tsps of it, so I halved that part of the recipe....1/4 cup white sugar mixed with 1 Tbsp of water & used what was left (yes, there was still extra!) for a glass of iced tea.

I followed the directions exactly and the milk and powdered sugar didn't come out smooth and adding the sugar syrup only made hard clumps. I added all the syrup 2 tsp. at a time and then more milk to get a bit of a glaze with hard sugar balls in it. If it wasn't so late & I didn't have work in the morning I would have tossed the stuff out made a glaze without graduated sugar.

This icing works very well.  It stays nice and fluid while working, and dries firmly with a nice sheen.  Love the almond flavor!

A couple of tips - SIFT your powdered sugar.  I didn't use my electric whisk (but if doubling do so)  I sifted the sugar and used a small hand whisk.  If the icing seems to thick, thin with more sugar syrup - a little at a time.  Whisking well after each addition.  These dried glossy and it was really easy to work with.

This recipe has always worked out perfectly for me but I have to double or triple the recipe for all out Christmas cut out.  I'm never measuring exact and it is smooth and glossy every time.  The key is the sugar syrup.  Be sure it simmers long enough that it is completely dissolved, then add it to the confectioner's sugar and milk when it's just short of the consistency you want.  The sugar syrup with thin it more.  If it becomes too thin I add more confectioner's sugar.  It hasn't failed me yet and even my 12 yo daughter make this recipe easily!

The recipe given for simple syrup is incorrect. Based on my experience at culinary school, it should be equal parts sugar and water. Doing it their way will only result in clumpy sugar crystals with zero water remaining. Adding that to the milk and sugar solution will result in clumpy and unappealing icing.

This was perfect! I was out of corn syrup while we made Valentine cookies on a snowy day, so I didn't want to go to the store. This worked great for our cookies. It spread nicely and was the perfect consistency. It does dry very quickly, so ice cookies as soon as it is ready, so that you can spread it. I needed 3 tablespoons of the syrup and about 3 teaspoons of milk for the right texture. Everything else was perfect! Thank you for a great recipe!

I didn't have any corn syrup on hand, so gave this recipe a try.  It was very good, but it's worth noting that I needed 2 tablespoons of milk, rather than 2 teaspoons, to be able to even form a paste with the powdered sugar and milk.  I think all in all I used 3 tablespoons milk and 3 tablespoons of the sugar syrup, and it was the perfect consistency for the kids to brush it thickly onto their cookies, and it hardened pretty quickly.  Nice and easy to make icing!

For the most part, this recipe worked for me. I sifted the sugar like someone recommended. I added the ingredients exactly, but still the powdered sugar mixture was too thick. After adding 4 tsp of white sugar mix, I added a bit more milk to make icing easier. Also, I didn't have almond extract so I added coconut extract. Hmmmm...nice flavor.

It didn't make as much as it said it would. Double it.

Seemed to work great. I recommend using a small spatula to spread and doing so quickly before icing sets. I love that I had all the ingredients and didn't need to use yucky corn syrup.

I needed to make a frosting/icing that would harden and didn't have the Caro syrup that every other recipe called for. Once I started this recipe I realized that making my own sugar syrup is mimicking the Caro syrup in other recipes without me having to go out and buy it. PERFECT! This was super easy to make, to dye, and to use. Hardens perfectly. I will definitely do this again!

Well I took this recipe at the last minute. I thought it would work. I did it exactly what the instructions called for,, unfortunately it didn’t work for me. The icing was nice while it was hot! Once I started to want to frost or coat the cookies,,,,,the sugar started to crystallized! I don’t think I’ll use this recepie again. However the sugar cookie recipe from Allrecipes.com is very delicious

I followed exactly as what the recipe says. It didn't turn out well. 
Thus i added more milk and made adjustments to the consistency that I wanted, it turned out perfect. If it was too watery, I added more of the confectionery sugar.
The ingredients are awesome. It's just the quantity stated is not accurate.
Another downside of this recipe is the sugar syrup, i used very little but in the recipe amount is too much.

This worked well and decorated easily.  However, I think that having so much leftover syrup is a waste.
