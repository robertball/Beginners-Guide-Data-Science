I made this, following the recipe to a T- Which I normally do the first time I make something. I have to say it's very good but too strong! I like a strong drink but a whole bottle of 151 was a bit much. Next year I will only use half of the bottle as we had to add regular egg nog to this to be able to drink it and make it through the night without passing out LOL ;)  Great recipe other than that.

Correction to recipe!  the amount of rum should be a small bottle of 151 proof rum (200ml). Not 750ml.
