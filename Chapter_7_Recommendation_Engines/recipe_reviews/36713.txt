Sorry but we did not enjoy at all.  I decreased the potatoes by about a pound, added more chicken, doubled the spices(and my spices are fresh) . . . and still my family was commenting on not enough chicken, too much potatoes and not enough seasoning - in spite of my endless tweaking.  I LOVE to cook, and have been experimenting with Indian recipes for a few years.  I should of known, 2 1/2 pounds of potatoes and rice?  I guess I liked the idea of the seasoning mix.  Won't be making this again!

This is yummy! It takes awhile but it is worth it. It's not super curry flavored though, but definitely spicy. I reduced the water by 1 cup and simmered for less time, and added carrots and peppers to replace some of the potatoes. It does make a lot! Very good, highly recommended!

This recipe had very little to no flavor. I tried adding twice the spices and it still lacked a taste - especially a curry flavor. I love curry and this did not taste much like it. I would not try this recipe again.

I like this recipe because it's a great way to make a very healthy, yet very flavorful meal. But I do make several changes now. First I made it exactly like written, and both my boyfriend and I felt the red pepper was way too overpowering (and he is quite the firehead.) The modifications I made this last time were: half the amount of red pepper and cinammon, a little more ginger (if using powder, if using fresh do same amount), and different vegetables instead of potato. Another great thing about this recipe is you can use any veggie you want and it will cook very nicely in the sauce. I now use carrots, bell pepper, fresh spinach, or whatever I have in the fridge. Next time I'm going to take other reviewers suggestion of red pepper flakes in place of plain red pepper. Also, be sure to simmer the curry for quite awhile to get the thickness in the sauce.

This curry taste pretty good. It uses yogurt instead of coconut milk, so it very healthy for you.  It was so easy to prepare.

Make sure to use red chili flakes, not red pepper powder.  We LOVED this recipe.  An excellent curry.

This was a little too spicy for me, to tone it down I added a small can of plain tomato sauce and a large spoonful of yogurt (in addition to what is listed in recipe).  This made it taste very similar to my fav restaurant's chicken curry!  Would def also put in more chicken and less potato - I will make again!

Very tasty and delicious with my friends who adore curry. I think we could eat curry 3 times a week and this recipe would be at the top of the list. I used red potatoes and cooked them separately then mixed with the rest of the ingredients. It was a true winner in my books.

Very Good a bit too spicey not enough curry. I'll make it again. Just next time i will put half the amount of cayenne pepper and add more curry powder instead. I also used half the potatoes that the reciepe called for. I thought this receipe was very easy and pretty good. I will definitely make it again. Just need to add more curry. My 4year old liked it my 3year old hated it..My husband liked but said it didn't taste like curry..

I find this recipe to be all spice with very little character, it's very thin in consistency, not like a traditional Indian curry at all, a dissapointment

This takes a lot of different and exotic ingredients to make, and quite some time.  But the final product is well worth the effort.  The curry tastes very authentic (assuming that what's served at restaurants are authentic).  However, there were too many potatoes, and not enough chicken for my taste.  If you make this dish, you should probably cut the amount of potatoes in half, and add 50% more chicken.  Also, make sure that the curry is gravy-like consistency, not watery.  You will have to boil the curry for quite a while.  Serve over plain rice.

Easy and delicious.  This is a fantastic recipe, I could not believe I cooked such a fantastic chicken curry.  It's better than some restaurants and it's light!  Also good to double recipe and save for later when curry flavor really gets in the chicken.
Thanks All Recipes!

I made this recipe twice now. It is so good. I did add 1 cup of coconut milk and reduced the water by 1 cup as well. Oh, I played around with the spices, too as it was too much cayenne pepper for my tastes. I was disappointed at first because it looked very watery, even after cooking for 1 hour, however as it cooled it really thickened up. It tastes great the next day, too!

Pretty good considering you're not at an Indian restaurant. In itself, it tastes great but you can't compare it to something you'd get at your favorite Indian place. In the interest of saving time, next time I want Indian food, I'll just go out for it. That doesn't mean this isn't a good recipe though. It's just a little time consuming and doesn't taste quite the same.

this recipe was easy and a tasty alternative to traditional curry w/ coconut milk...  i added more yogurt, trippled the spices, and did not add any water.  also, i used only a few potatos... it wasn't the thickest... but, it worked well over rice.  i will make it again.

This was a fun dish to make, it takes some time to prep before you get to simmer for an hour but it was worth it.  I did do some adjustments; 50% more curry and instead of 4 cups of water I added 1 can of coconut milk and 1 can of chicken stock.  This may have made it more creamy but it was good and thick.  I followed the potatoes but next time I will add eggplant, carrots, and maybe some asparagus or peppers.  I will also add more chicken.  People called it bland, if anything it had a bland texture not a bland flavor.

Awful.  I'd give it zero stars if possible.  To make matters worse it is a bit time consuming as well.  If your after a "lite" chicken curry try the African chicken curry and use lite coconut milk w/ double the curry spices.

I've made this numerous times with great success.  It's got a kick (I use hot chili powder and hot curry)I used only 3 cups water as 4 made it too watery for my liking.   A sprinkling of golden raisins on top gives it a nice sweet/spicy taste.
I also have made the spice mix packets for gifts and attach the recipe(great for those who love good food but don't have the ingredients or desire).

Although, I made this dish for a friend who requested the recipe, she probably just wanted to be nice!  Considering the number of spices in this dish it is surprisingly bland.  I nearly doubled them all (less the red pepper!) and was still disappointed in the flavor.  Save yourself the time and pick another recipe!

This had great flavor, but too much potato.  I added a bell pepper and next time I make it I will use some fresh tomato and less potato.

My husband who is VERY picky said that this was the best meal I had made in our 5 year marriage!  haha - I sauteed a green pepper with the onion and garlic and did not add the potatoes - It looked too soupy at first, but after an hour the consistency was perfect - OUR NEW FAVORITE

I made this about 2 weeks ago.  I used turkey breast instead of chicken, which may have made this a little drier than it should have been. I also measured the rice wrong and have a huge pot of rice which consumed most of the moistness in the curry.  I enjoyed making this because it was my first ethnic recipe I've tried.  I will make it again and use chicken and measure my rice correctly.  Also, this recipe will definitely clean your system.  And for those having trouble finding the spices for this recipe, visit an ethnic grocery store. They're all over the place and the spices are much cheaper there.

This was nice for something different, but it would be better with some vegetables other than just potatos.  Also, it makes a lot!

Very good curry recipe for boneless chicken lovers.  My husband who is a big curry fan would not have known I used yogurt and tomato paste if I hadn't told him!  I will definately make this recipe again. C.Ferris in China

I think the end result of this recipe was a 5 star, but I modified it a bit.  I left  potatoes and tomato out.  I used less cayenne and only  a half cup of water  The spice blend was very good and I have some left over for another dish.

Delicious, but forgot to mention that I only cooked the chicken pieces in the mixture for 10-15 minutes; they were cooked through and still tender.

You should cook this the night before and store in the fridge. The flavours will be much stronger (and better) the next day instead of right out of the pot after it's cooked.

Great taste, I used 1/4 of the amount of ground red pepper and was just right.  A little soupy, will add some flour next time to thicken it up when I add the water.

I used light coconut milk instead of yogurt and sub. about 2 cups chopped carrots for the potatoes. We love it on jasmine rice. A family favorite. It is even better the next day - but it gets hotter.

This was excellent, easy to make, and made enough to fill my husband up and have plenty of leftovers.  My picky kids ate it up and had seconds!  Indian food isn't spicy unless you want it to be so don't shy away from this just because it's Indian.  Great way to introduce new culture's foods!

Spicy hot, but particularly flavorful.  My kids enjoyed it. I wouldn't exactly call it a curry, though.  Next time I would reduce the tomato paste and increase the yougurt.

My husband really liked this recipe.  I didn't have any yogurt so I used 8oz of heavy whipping cream and whipped it by hand using a wire whisk until it was thicker like yogurt. We will definitely make this again.

Mmmm... this recipe was soo good.  Be more liberal with the spices though, when I tasted it initally it needed more curry and I dashed more of all the spices.  Very good.  Definitely a keeper!!!!

The hardest part of this recipe is buying all of the different spices.  It is a bit spicier than other curries I've had.  tIt's very easy and I ate it for lunch that next week.  Overall I really enjoyed it.

A good solid recipe, if you are looking for something different.  A nice blend of spices makes this recipe worth trying. May be a little "too spicy" for children.

Amazing that it's so fast and tastes so good - usually making an authentic-tasting indian dish takes 3-4 hours of preparation and cooking.  One note:  when the recipe calls for ground red pepper, in my mind that's cayenne, and rather than a tsp I added about 1/4 tsp which worked out perfectly.  I also added some sliced carrots with the potatoes.  This recipe is now one of my top 5 indian cook at home meals.

This was a very tasty dish. After a full hour of simmering, it was a perfect consistency. I would cut the recipe down next time, I had more than half left over.
