I made this for Thanksgiving and it was incredible!  The entire family loved it and it was actually the only pie that was completely gone at the end of the day!  The only thing I changed was to double the amount of crumb topping, I just didn't think it was enough, it didn't cover the entire top of the pie.  We warmed each slice in the microwave for 35 seconds and topped with Cool Whip--excellent!!  My other apple pie recipes will be deleted from my recipe box!!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Beautiful and excellent pie! I did (accidentally) increase the butter in the crumb topping! I also, based on other reviews, increase the flour in the filling mix to eliminate runniness. I had made this pie for a friend, but my dear husband refused to let it leave the house! Smelled so wonderful he could not resist. Cool completely before slicing! I know it is hard...you can also zap it in the microwave to serve with vanilla ice cream!

This is definitely in the top five of pies that I have ever eaten. Needless to say, that says a lot.  For two pies, I used six granny smith apples, or seven with light snacking.  I also double the crumb mixture. The crumb mixture tastes even better with ground cloves, allspice, and nutmeg.  mmm...nutmeg
This is a keeper.

I just had a couple of forkfuls of this so that I could review the recipe and I could quite possibly be in dessert heaven right now. This is one of the best apple pies I've tried in some time. I don't normally make a crumb topped pie so this was a nice departure. Because hubs and I wouldn't be able to eat a whole pie before the topping became soggy, I scaled this down to three servings to make two individual pies in shallow, round ramekins. I used "Butter Flaky Pie Crust," also from this site. I skipped the raisins and nuts, and subbed an equal amount of cinnamon for the nutmeg, which I'm not a fan of. The apples are perfectly sweetened and spiced (use more or less depending on the sweetness or tartness of your apples) with a perfect amount of rich, cinnamony syrup - just enough to mix with the apples. The crumb topping is light and "crumbly," just as it's supposed to be (a recent baking experience showed me that's not always the case). And just the right amount of topping too. Not only is this one of the better recipes I've tried, it's also one of the easiest with no top crust! This would make a terrific presentation for a dinner get-together, as these individual little pies are very charming. I definitely have another favorite with this pie!

This recipe was very easy and I liked everything about it except that it was very very watery when I sliced it. I had baked it as directed just before the meal and it cooled for about an hour and a half and was still warm when I served it. I'm pretty sure I didn't forget to put the flour into the filling (but it's possible). Later, after all the guests were gone, I picked up the pie plate and the juices had thickened upon standing. So I think I may have to let it cool completely before serving next time, and maybe bake it uncovered longer.

This pie makes a beautiful presentation. I followed the recipe exactly and added the optional raisins and nuts.  I followed other reviews and doubled the topping.  I think next time I will NOT double the topping because this pie was WAY TOO SWEET.  It was good, but too sweet for an apple pie. The Cool Whip on top sort of saved it, but I'll know better for next time.........UPDATE: The next day the pie was incredible. I don't know what happened.  I still think doubling the topping was a mistake, but boy was it good the next day.

I must admit when I saw all the great reviews about thus recipe I could not wait to make it for my family.  I have been baking for a very long time so I am very famialiar with how to make pies.  This recipe was just plain awful.  I followed the directions completly.  It looked great when it came out of the oven.  I don't what could have happened.  My husband said it was the worst pie I have ever made.  So this will not be a tradition in my house.  Maybe everyone has different taste.

I have to say this was one of the best Apple Pies i've had in a very long time.  I used granny smith apples, and did cut down on the sugar and it was absolutely delicious.  My husband raved about it!  I found the amount of crumb adequate for the recipe, and I used a lot of apples!

This pie got top marks with my family. They totally devoured it! I made only one small change which was to sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of minute tapioca into the bottom of the crust before adding the apples. It absorbs the extra juices and keeps the bottm crust from getting soggy - something my mom taught me to do years ago.

This was a delicious pie! I would use a little less sugar depending on the apples you use. I used cortland apples. Amaretto soaked raisins also added a little extra zing to this recipe!

I ALWAYS follow any recipe EXACTLY as stated, and to be honest, this pie came out delicious on my first try! I often read reviews of people who CHANGED so many things and still give the recipe a bad review. I don't know why people do that! They shouldn't complain it was bad UNLESS they actually followed the recipe exactly. ANYWAY, sorry for my rant. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it was delicious. I definitely recommend it. I DIDN'T change anything. The walnuts and raisins are optional, but I added the walnuts only & I'm glad I did because it gave the pie a nice crunchyness. I used 6 granny smith apples.

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I made it last year for Thanksgiving and it definitely will be on my table again this year.  I use a combination of granny smith's and mac's and it comes out delicious....A real winner!

I've made this pie twice so far.  Both times, I used the same combination of apples:  3 each of Mutsu, Golden Delicious and Gala.  The woman at the farm where I picked them suggested that combining the three different varieties would give the best taste...not too tart, not too sweet!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with too much liquid gushing out when I cut into it. It also took a great deal more flour to make the crumbs than stated.  And the apples were slightly more crisp than I had expected.  The second time, I doubled the flour in the pie to 4 tbsp, doubled the crumb recipe, adding as much flour as needed to perfect the crumbs, and cooked for 50 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered.  It came out PERFECT!  I let the pie cool for 24 hours before serving at a party.  I also topped it with caramel and chopped pecans.  It was absolutely delicious and got rave reviews from the party guests!  Will definitely make this pie again and again!!!

This was the first time I had ever made any kind of pie, and it turned out great!!  I used granny smith apples (it took 4 to make 6 cups) and used the amount of sugar called for.  It was very sweet, but that is how my family and I like desserts!  I can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving and impress my in-laws.

The family loved this pie!
I did use the lemon juice, to keep the apples nice and tart, but did not use the raisins or walnuts.  I found the crumb topping to be just the right amount - completely covering the pie, but not overpowering it.
A note about apples: the few negative reviews I've seen on this recipe indicate that the pie was either "tasteless" or "watery".  This is most likely because of the type of apples used.  I recommend Jonathan apples - they are nicely tart (so the pie has flavour and the amount of sugar used doesn't make it too sweet) and they are not very juicy (unlike, I've found, Granny Smith varieties).
Also, I recommend rubbing your pie crust with a little bit of softened butter before adding the filling.  This will build up a little barrier between any moisture from the apples, and let the crust get nicely cooked.

My husband was very quiet while he ate this, and then he said, "I think the might be the best apple pie I have ever had." That said, it was wonderful the first day but it does tend to get a bit soggy if you save it for a few days. It still tastes pretty good though.

Great Great recipe! I made it for my boyfriend and he ate the whole thing! He loved it so much I ended up making a second one for him the next day!   I used 6 medium sized apples, 4 Granny Smith and 2 Golden Delicious, to get a little different texture and taste for the pie. I made 1 and 1/2 of the crumb topping. Doubling the topping would be too much.   My changes to the recipe: I used 1/2c of white sugar and 1/4c of brown sugar for the filling.  After mixing the apples with the sugar and spices, let it sit for a few minutes. Some of the liquid will be pulled out of the fruit and you can drain it off. I also added about a 1/4c of white sugar to the topping and baked it under the broiler at 525degrees for the last 5 minutes of baking time. This helped get a nice topping that won't get soggy. Be sure to slice the apples thinly and to a uniform size or else they won't cook correctly. Cool it for 30minutes-1 hour to allow it to set properly.  I'll be making this pie again this weekend!

Excellent recipe.  But, the first time I made it using freshly sliced apples, it came out extremely watery and ran everywhere.  When I made it again, I first par-boiled the apples (1 1/2 minutes in boiling water, then a cold water bath to cool them), then I laid them on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels to drain.  (By the way, if you want to freeze your orchard-fresh apples for pies, treat them with Fruit Fresh first and then do them this way as well and then pack in freezer bags) Came out perfect!  Not watery, stayed together when sliced--amazing!  I did not add the nuts or raisins, as my boys don't like them.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is delish! Picked this recipe b/c I only had one crust.  I'm sooo glad I found it.  The crumb topping (which I doubled) was soooo good!  I didn't find it too sweet probably b/c I used very tart granny smith apples.  I did double the flour and still found that it was slightly liquidy after cooling ALL day.  However, it wasn't so liquidy that it ruined the pie.  I also packed the apples in there so that could have been part of it.  My guests also LOVED this pie.  Will be making this my standard apple pie recipe.  It's soo EASY!  (I love the taste of Grandma Opel's pie on this site, but that's better left when you want a more involved recipe.  As far as taste, I like them both a lot, but MAY prefer this one b/c of the topping!)

I used "honey crisp" apples. They are the best apples I have discovered in a long time. The crumb topping was just enough because I like more filling. I used a teaspoon of cinnamon and even added a dash or two of pumpkin pie spice. Made it very flavorful.  The filling is unbelievable, so rich! I never use pie crusts anymore so you can omit that if you want and when it’s baked just scoop and add vanilla ice cream. Try the golden raisins and walnuts mixed in, I promise you will love it.  Perfect for the holidays!

Very easy to make and modify according to your preference.  I always end up making two pies at a time because I chop way too many apples. Two medium / large Granny Smith apples are enough for one pie.  It needs a longer baking time so that the juice from the apples and the flour you toss in will gel together. For the topping, I increase the measurements by another 50% just so that I'll have a thicker topping. I cover the pie loosely with foil during the first 45 minutes of baking and then bake it uncovered for the last 30 minutes. Enjoy!

I soaked the raisins in hot apple juice before I used them in the apple pie filling. I just made sure to drain them really well before using. I used organic Granny Smith apples and I tripled the spices in the apple pie filling. (We like a really spicy apple pie.) I used pecans in the topping only because we don't like walnuts. The directions didn't say to pre-bake the bottom pie crust which I did at 400 degrees for ten minutes. Halfway through baking the pie, I did cover it with foil so the dutch topping would not burn. Baking at 350 it took just under an hour and twenty minutes to bake. This turned out really well. I'm glad I doubled the spices. Next time, I might add a little spice to the topping as well and I'd cut back just a touch on the sugar in the filling, but that's really just a personal choice. I really liked the combination of the apples and the raisins and the nuts in the topping was a tasty addition. This is a really good dutch apple pie recipe made a little more personal with our own family's favorite touches.

Excellent! I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup and made 1.5 times the crumble. Yum!

Yummers! The only changes I made was I omitted the nutmeg, nuts and raisins (didn't have any on hand) and I replaced the 3/4 cup of white sugar in the apple mixture with a 1/2 cup of brown sugar (highly recommended!). I used the 'Healthier Pie Crust' recipe found on this site for the base. Made this for my boyfriend and I as a treat one night and he begged that I make it for our dinner party the following weekend. It was devoured! I'm super picky and I would absolutely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!!!

This is an excellent pie recipe.  If your apples seem to be extra juicy like mine were, add up to 4 TBS more flour - until the apples are well coated - this prevents a water pie.  I used an equal amount of apple pie spice in place of the other spices.  Also, you should always taste your apples before you make your pie - if they are on the sweet side, cut back on the sugar; and if they are unusually tart you might want to add an extra 1/4 cup of sugar.

I'm 15 years old. I love to bake, but neve rin my life have i tried making a pie. I found this recipe and i tried it out. and everyone LOVED it. It was fun to make, delicious, and even looked great. I doubled  the crumb topping after reading a former review and that worked out well for me too. thanks for this recipe! my family will never buy a store bought apple pie again. :D

Fabulous recipe.  I did cut back a bit on the sugar to 1/2 cup and felt the filling was sweet enough especially with the crumb topping.

I fixed this exactly as posted and it was very tasty. My filling seemed way to liquidy but that could have been due to the fact that I used frozen apples (thawed). That made the bottom crust soggy and it was more like a crisp with a crust. But good!

Love this recipe !  I just made my second pie.   Based on the reviews and personal taste, I made some small additions:  I added Pecans in the apples and in the topping.  I also added a little cinnamon and a smidge of nutmeg into the topping.  I like to cut the apples into smaller than normal pieces, thet seem to cook a little better and are easier to eat rather than pulling out large chunks with other bites.  Always use homemade crust!  It's quick- only 4 ingredients to make and Far better than store bought! The recipies for it are all over this site.

I would only suggest that you make this pie on the day you plan to serve it.  I made it the day before and the "crunch" topping was soggy.  Wish I had made it the day I planned on serving it.

This was really good and easy.  I skipped the raisins and nuts as it was for my daughters class for her Thanksgiving lunch. If you like your apples soft, cut them thin and they will soften up nicely.

This pie is to die for!  I didn't put the raisins in, but did put the walnuts.  It was different, but very well worth it!  Took one pie to work, they devoured it!  Thanks for sharing.

I had an abundance of apples and only 1 pie shell.  I left out the raisins and nuts as my husband doesn't like them and I probably shouldn't be eating whole pies by myself, though with this one, I don't think it would have been hard to do.  This was great hot or cold, with or without ice cream.  We had unexpected company the following night and served them this pie as well.  One guest said she could have eaten a serving of just the crumb topping it was so good.

While it was good, I found it to be WAY too sweet. I'll definitely try it again, but there will be a huge reduction in sugar.

Absolutely wonderful pie.  I have it made twice in a week and had rave reviews.  Used Granny Smith apples, they were perfect.  Second time I put in a tablespoon of flour, won't do that again.  Perfect the way it was.

I made this recipe (for the first time) on the fly the day before Thanksgiving. This was by far the best apple pie recipe I have ever made. Of course I did make a few changes according to some others recommendations. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and replaced the 2 Tablespoons of flour for 1 1/2 Tablespoons of corn starch. I didn't add raisins or nuts. The pie was simply wonderful, not runny, not too sweet.

Very tasty! I enjoyed the final product very much. The top was nice and crispy. I left the raisins out though, I just don't like raisins much. I also left out the optional lemon juice. I did not find the filling runny or too moist as some others did. I used Fuji apples, which I thought might turn out a little too sweet, but they were perfect! Also, I sliced them super thin which turned out amazing. The only mistake I made was cooking it on a cookie sheet, the bottom didn't cook well. My mistake though! Next try will be perfect, I'm sure!

I've been wanting to bake apple pie with crumb topping coz it's my absolute favorite and I'm so glad that I stumbled upon this recipe!! This is delicious!  I used Granny Smith apples and added walnuts to the filling but to also add more textural appeal to the crumb topping, I mixed around 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts! I love the extra crunch it gives to the topping!  I also followed the suggestion of sprinkling the bottom of the crust with flour which helps prevent the juices from making the crust soggy.   I also initially thought that 6 cups of apples would be a bit too much for a 9 inch crust as it made the pie mound so high.  But as the apple pie bakes, the mound became smaller because the apples have cooked inside already.  When I removed the foil cover after the initial 25 mins I had to lower my oven temperature to around 350-325 because I felt that the heat was too much and would char the topping before the next 25 mins was over (which was already starting to happen around the edges). I think the method suggested by the author is relative to the oven of the baker.

Great pie.  I did make a few changes just to suit my family.  My husband likes oatmeal in his crumb topping so I added 1/3 cup quick cooking oats and an extra 2 tbsp butter to compensate.  Plus I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the crumb topping and 1 tsp to the filling.  I omitted the nuts and raisins because I didn' have and I also doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg because I really enjoy the flavor.  I also added a lattice top because my hubbing also really likes pastry, so by adding a lattice top it still allows the crumb topping to get crisp.  After it came out of the oven I brushed the pastry with a watered down corn syrup and sprinkled with demarera sugar.  It was very delicious and everyone loved it!

Amazing!  Got rave reviews when I took it to share with our Young Married's group.  I used Golden Delicious apples and doubled the crumb topping.  One suggestion - be sure to put something under this while it's cooking...it was so juicy it spilled over into the oven!

This is a delicious recipe. I like it because it has relatively few ingredients. My trick: cut the apples into tiny slivers. It makes the pie more moist, juicy, and tender, and more fully coats each apple slice.

This pie was fantastic.  The only thing I did was after reading the reviews - to counter the two major complaints, runniness and the "sinking" of the pie. I increased the flour to about 3/4 cup and I used about 8 apples total and piled the crust really high, that the pie didn't sink that much.  I used red delicious apples because that is what I had on hand.  Don't omit the raisins and the walnuts because they only add to the delicious flavor of the pie.  One last tip, let the pie cool for a few hours before serving, this will help decrease any runniness.

This pie was delicious!!! My boyfriend asked me to make it for him all the time...it was pretty runny on the bottom, though, I would definitely recommend adding another tablespoon or two of flour to the apple mixture. The crunchy topping is phenomenal!!! I will definitely be making this pie for a long time to come!

This was my first pie ever, and it was so easy and DELICIOUS!  Wow.  This one scored me lots of points with my husband.  We especially liked the crumble top.  I used four different kinds of apples for this--get big ones.  I found that if you mix the crumble with your hands, it's easier to get the right consistency.

I don't eat apple pie, but I made this for my hubby and he loved it!  The only problem I had was that it was the consistency of water when I cut into it, however it thickened up later when it cooled completely.  Maybe I will add a little more flour next time.  All in all, a prizewinner according to my husband!

This was my very first pie ever (made it for Thanksgiving) and it turned out perfect!  It was soooo pretty, I almost didn't eat it... until we got out the vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce to drizzle over the top.  'Not eating' the pie was no longer an option!  Thanks so much.

I have had to make 2 of these pies within the last 5 days!  My 12 year old niece keeps gobbling them up.  My honey loves it too!  I didn't add raisins and instead of walnuts I added pecans.  The pie came out great!  I'm not an experienced pie maker and not a great baker - but this pie was very simple!

This has been my exclusive apple crumb pie since last year when I spotted it here.  I get nothing but raves.  I always have to make two at a time...one for whoever I'm "thanking" and then another for the family.  It's great!

while this pie was delicious, the presentation was awful.  didn't look appetizing at all.  I doubled the crumb topping as per other users' suggestions, and I'm glad I did, otherwise there wouldn't have been enough, but still, it wasn't a pretty sight.

Awesome! I kept this pie basic and did not add the raisins or nuts for the kids....we all loved it even my non-fruit eating hubby had a sliced and liked it! Easy, juicy and pretty much perfect. Crumb topping was so good on this pie.  I did increase the cinnamon to a full tspn. A keeper recipe, thanks!

Did not work out well for me. It was very soupy as many of the reviews warned me about. I even increased the flour by a couple of table spoons to avoid this possibility but it was still runny. I thought it would be better the next day but it was the same. I doubled the topping and that ended up being the best part. I think I have to give up on this one.

This is probably the best tasting and easiest apple pie ever. I actually bake it in a reduced-fat graham cracker crust, and it is delish.

I have made this pie a few times and it always turns out great!  I omit the nutmeg, since I am not a fan.  I also increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Also, I do not add the optional ingredients(lemon jc, raisins and walnuts.)

Love this recipe.  I'm not a big apple fan but this is a great pie.  I did double the topping and add nutmeg, clove and cinnamon to the pie and a dash to the topping.  Yummy.

This pie was very easy and absolutely delicious. I made it for my family on Christmas then again for New Years. It will definitely become a staple in our home. I made a scratch crust and brushed an egg wash around the edge for a little extra flakiness.

Super easy to make, and tasted great. My apple ended up a bit runny, so I overbaked it a few minutes. That made the crumbs on top too crispy. Next time I'll just take out the pie and let it cool down and come together. Overall, very tasty pie.

Made this on Thanksgiving and it is excellent and easy to make.  Followed the recipe and only left out the nutmeg & optional items.  I would definitely make again.  I used 5 Granny Smith and 2 Honey Crisp apples and it was plenty and very tasty.  The baking time however was much longer than stated, but that could be oven related.  Definitely will make again.  Thanks Jackie Smith

This was so good! I loved the addition of the raisins, I would never thought to add them! I used golden raisins and my kids didn't even know they were in there. the only thing I did different was double the crumb topping since it's my favorite part of the dessert. served it warm out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. making again this weekend for a friend!

This was absolutely divine! I have butchered so many apple pie toppings. This was fool proof. Not too sweet and just the perfect amount of everything. I did do an 8 inch pie shell however and 5 small apples. Everything else was just perfect as written in original recipe.  I can make apple pie now!

FANtastic! This was the first pie I've ever baked. My husband now thinks I'm a culinary genius. I used more cinnamon in place of the nutmeg (didn't have nutmeg on hand) and yes, it was runny at first, but it gets better as it sits. I used a frozen pie shell...kept it frozen until I filled it and preheated a cookie sheet to bake it on. Thanks so much for sharing. Fabulous!

This is an excellent recipe, and my family really liked it.  For health reasons, I used 1/2 cup of Splenda instead of 3/4 cup white sugar.  I agree with slicing the apples thin (I slice them about 1/8" thick) because this gives the pie a much better texture, making it a little crispy and fresh, but not overly crunchy and raw like some apple pies that slice the apples in larger sections (like 3/4" thick).  Personal family preference led to me using twice the cinnamon and walnuts.  I also replace the raisins with dried cranberries instead.  The pie was a winner.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This was very good for my first apple pie (first any kind of pie). A little too sweet so maybe cut out some of the sugar. I know the nuts and raisins were optional, but totally use them - they were great. I agree with other reviews that it needs another 1/2 or 1 tablespoon more flour in the filling.

I don't even like apple pie and I find this pie incredible.  I get so many compliments when I make it.  The only thing I would say is to add 1/2 to 1 extra tablespoon of flour in the filling cause it's a little watery.

This was a delicious pie, yum....  However, the crumb topping was soft and mushy the next day.  I recommend eating this pie on the day you bake it.

Oh my.  Add some vanilla icecream to this while it's still warm and prepare yourself for a heavenly experience.  SO good.  

This recipe is so easy to prepare...we used small apples from my parents' orchard and the result was fabulous!

Great Recipe! This was the first pie that me and my girlfriend ever made and even with simple novices like us we were able to make this taste great. We went apple picking and decided to try this out. I will say one thing though you definitely need to double the amount of crumb topping otherwise you wont have enough to cover the whole pie.

This pie was really good.  I did like other reviewers and upped cinnamon to 1-1/2 tsp, nutmeg to 1/2 tsp, flour to 4 tablespoons and doubled crumb mix.  Looked like it was going to be too much topping but i packed it on and it turned out really good.  Also used deep dish pie dish.  Hubby loved it

This is an AWESOME recipe! This was my first pie I have ever made, and I recvd SO MANY compliments! I used 2 kinds of apples, Macintosh and Granny Smith. I also put more flour for the filling so its not runny and it works! The topping was crispy and GOOD! I have made this 3x already and everytime I am asked for the recipe! :) THIS IS THE APPLE PIE RECIPE TO MAKE! GUARANTEED! (side note: I did w/o the raisins and nuts, not a big fan)

A-MAZING! I doubled the flour going into the apple-sugar mixture as suggested by other reviews. Also, I added a 3 Tbsp white sugar to the crumb topping mixture to make it crispy since other reviews said the top never got crispy - this worked really well. I sliced the apples very thin and they all came out quite soft. Great recipe, especially with the Basic Flaky Pie Crust on this site.

Apple pie is my youngest daughter's favourite dessert so when I saw this reviewed a couple of days ago I had to make it. I upped the flour to a quarter of a cup and I didn't have any runniness. I also reduced the white sugar to just over a quarter of a cup as I was using eating apples and it was plenty sweet enough. Daughter asked if we can have this again soon. Thanks.

LOVED this! Served it to two couples (plus my husband and me) and they all commented how good it was (one friend went home w/the recipe in hand.) I used both granny smith and golden delicious (3 and 4 of them, respectively) and added a bit more cinnamon and some ground cloves to the sugar mix. Cooked it a good 5 hours before we planned to eat it, to aviod the soggy issue I read in other reviews - just microwaved it briefly when ready to serve (w/ice cream, of course!) New apple pie favorite!

No question the BEST applie pie I have ever had. It tastes WAYYY much better than any they have in those fancy restaurants. IF YOU ARE ON A DIET STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!! By the way, I used the recipe I founf here for the flakiest pie crumb MMMMMMMMMMMMMM I can't tell you enough how deliscious this came out. I also accidentally doubled the portions on the crust so my apple pie came out with the flakiest thick crust and not wet at all.

This apple pie was outstanding! I made two of them for Thanksgiving, one with the raisins and nuts and one without. My family preferred the one without, but we still fought for the last piece. This will definitely be added to my holiday menu.

I love this! I just made it tonight, and it is awesome! I made it just like the recipe, but used pecans instead of walnuts. And I doubled the topping. It is delish! Not juicy what so ever. Definitely will be making this for the holidays! Thanks for sharing!!

This was one tasty pie! The only changes I made were in some of the spices (I used ginger, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg,) I added a little cinnamon to the topping, and used an addition 1 Tblsp of butter in the topping. I have made this twice and it has been a hit both times.

the first time i made it with the exact quanitities was too sweet for me but still really good so the next round i cut down the sugar to a little less than 1/2cup to mix with apples with a little more cinnamon and nutmeg and the topping about the same. it turned out perfect!

Great pie!! So quick and easy, the only thing I did differently was use a vegan butter to make it a vegan apple pie. Everything about this pie is so right, quick, easy, and super delicious. love the crunchy top.

great! rave reviews from my family! i made 2...one exactly like this recipe and one with my own twist...the recipe pie was great everyone loved it with vanilla ice cream. I added pecans and crasins in the 2nd one and was told it was MUCH better than the first, the bitter pecans offset the sweetness of the pie...will DEFINATELY make this again : )

I canned my own apples this season, so I used two quarts of apples for a thicker filled pie. And since I canned Cortland apples which are already sweet I subbed the 3/4 C of white sugar with 1/4 C white and 1/4 C. brown. I also used 1 tsp. apple pie spice instead of nutmeg. I also tapped the apple spice bottle ten times into the topping before cutting in the butter. I like my pie spicy and this was so good!!! Rave reviews even from someone who doesn't care for pie but had a sweet tooth the night I made this!!! Thank you so much! This is def a keeper!!!!

This was great, and I've been making apple pies for a long time.  I took some others' suggestions to double the crumbs and use half brown & white sugar in and on the pie, and I added more seasoning as well.  Omitted the raisins and put the nuts in the topping.  Yum, this will be made again in our house

Phenomenal.  I didn't add walnuts or raisins but followed everything else exactly the way the recipe called for and I must say that this pie is the most delicious apple crumb I have ever tasted.  This was my first time making it and I was told that it tasted better than other apple crumb pies that were baked by experts.  Thumbs up!

This was a Great recipe...I rated it 4 stars because I feel it needed a few alterations.  This is what makes this recipe a 5 star one.  First of all, definitely double the crumb topping which is delicious.  If not, there's not enough to cover the pie.  I also only use 1/2 C white sugar because the topping is soooo sweet that you want the filling to be a little less sweet.  Overall, definitely a keeper for my recipe book!!

Absolutely fantastic. I only needed about 4.5 cups of apples to fill my pie pan but besides that made it exactly as written and it's probably the best apple pie I've ever had. Will definitely make for Thanksgiving.

This pie is wonderful...I used Splenda white sugar in the filling instead of regular. I used Splenda brown sugar for the topping. I sprinkled the walnuts on top instead of putting it in the filling.My husband loved it.

This was super yummy!  I found that it was better after I had chilled it for a day.  It was runny when it came out and I wasnt sure if that was normal or what but I like it chilled.  The crumb topping was amazing!  The only thing I didnt do was add the raisins and walnuts just on personal preference. Overall really great pie.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good Recipe...though I had to revise the Flour amount to the sugar mixture from 2 Tbls to my usual 4-5 Tbls that I do for any fruit pie I make.  Otherwise you end up with a runny pie instead of achieving the correct glaze set consistency for the pie in the end.  Mine came out just perfect as a result.  I also think the 1/2 C of Brown sugar amount for the crumb topping makes it way too sweet and I would go with 1/3 C if made again.  Happy Baking!

I used 3 crispin and 3 granny smith apples which after slicing I realized was about 11 cups (no raisins or walnuts).  I still only used same amt of  sugar, cinnamon, flour & nutmeg.  I made 2 pies with this amount of filling.  I also tripled the crumb mixture and spread on the 2 pies.  Absolutely delicious and perect sweetness!

This was good.  Not spectacular, but a good, basic apple pie.  Next time I'll use more butter in the crumb topping.

Made almost exactly as stated, though I did add a little apple pie spice to the crumb topping too. The flavor was great, which is saying a lot for me since i don't normally like apple pie. The only problem I had though, was it was really runny and some of the juice spilled over the side when I took it out of the oven. That might have just been the apples I used though.

This is the third apple pie recipe I have tried and by far the best! I skipped the raisins, lemon juice and walnuts. I used three large granny smith apples for the filling. It turned out fantastic! The pie was the right amount of sweet and sour!

I made this and doubled the crumb topping like a lot of the reviews suggested.  I think it would have been better if I hadn't, it made it a little too sweet, a little too doughy.  The filling came out wonderfully, though.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 of a cup.  Used the Buttery Flaky Crust recipe.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe with the exception of some of the suggestions that other reviewers left. I doubled the flour to 4 tbsps and added in more cinnamon and nutmeg and I threw in some allspice as well. I doubled the topping. I also used Granny Smith and Fuji apples. I cooked it about an extra 20 mins to make it crisper. This is my first apple pie and everybody couldn't get enough, I barely got a piece for myself. Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful pie.  I used both granny smith and honeycrisp apples, I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 regular sugar in filling and I used 1 1/2 tbs cornstarch instead of the flour (thickens much better).  No raisins or nuts.  I don't like apple pie I liked this!

Excellent recipe! I used 5 Tbsp of butter instead of 3 to give it a little more flavor. I baked it for 45 minutes without covering the pie and the apples turned out a little more crunchy than I like it to be...although some friends liked the crunch texture. Maybe I'll try following the recipe as is the next time.

Delicious flavor, but a bit too liquidy until cooled completely. I will add another T. of flour to apple mixture next time I make it. I did not use the raisins or walnuts.

Really easy to follow this recipe.  I spooned the apples into the crust (just like it says) and left the juice in the bowl.  If you dump the whole thing in, your pie might be really soggy.  Your apples are going to make or break this recipe!  Mine may have been a little too bland but I'll add some lemon juice to bring out the flavor next time...and I will make it again!

This pie was fantastic!  So easy to make for a person that hasn't made too many pies before.  I followed the recipe word for word, except I did not add raisins or nuts.  Came out perfect, looked phenomenal, and tasted great!  Thanks!

Exceptionally yummy!  I agree with some of the other reviews that the pie is fairly runny coming out of the oven... definitely will use a little more flour next time.   Also, I don't know what type of apples people have been baking it with, but I made them with Braeburn apples and they held up well and tasted very nice and sweet.   I will be making this again soon, trust me!

This pie tasted really excellent.  It was a bit runny when I first cut into it.  This is a pie that has to have a bit of extra time to set up.  The only other comment I would make is to be sure to mix and/or sift the topping really well and distribute the butter evenly, or you will get areas of raw flour when the pie is done.  Overall a solid recipe, especially when you take the marvelous simplicity into consideration.

The crumb topping was very good, but I'm a fan of a more basic apple-tasting pie. I think next time I will cut down on the cinnamon (I had already eliminated the nutmeg) to let the apple flavor shine. The texture was wonderful and the crumb topping made the pie really unique.

I really enjoyed this pie!! I used Granny Smith apples, and they were the perfect fit for the pie. I did not double the crumb recipe as many others did, and I'm glad I didn't. I thought there was more than enough crumb to cover all of the apple mixture. I left out the walnuts and raisins due to my family's personal preferences, but I would love to try this with them some time! This was such a simple recipe, which I am always a fan of. The cooking time and temperature seemed just perfect. I do want to note you should peel your apples before using them in the pie. This was my first time making apple pie, and I didn't think about that until after it was completed. Peeling would just have made it easier to cut and handle, but the flavor was superb! Definately using this recipe again!

This was my first pie and it was sooo easy. It took about 10 minutes of prep before putting it into the oven. After trying this, I don't know why anyone would buy a frozen Sara Lee dutch apple pie. This so so much better!

My 9" pie pan is not deep dish, so it fit about 4 and a half cups of chopped apples. (I cut back a bit on the other ingredients to compensate, but not by much.) I used a mix of granny smith and others from a friend's orchard, and added raisins that had been soaked in boiling water for 10 min. The pie was a little on the sweet side, next time I might cut back on the sugar. The crumb topping was the right amount for my 4+ cups of apples, but if I made the deep dish version I would follow other reviewers' ideas of making more crumb topping. Overall, it was great!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I've only attempted to make apple pie twice before and they both came out so terrible that my husband banned me from baking desserts. I came to allrecipes in search for an apple pie without a top crust and one that was relatively easy. This was the perfect recipe for me! I followed this recipe exactly and it came out magnificent! It wasn't watery like other reviewers had said and my husband gave it 9 out of 10 stars! Thanks again for a delicious apple pie!

We used a graham cracker crust and that made it over the top amazing!  Omitted raisins and nuts - just used apples from the farmers market.

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the raisins because I prefer without it, I reduced the amount of sugar by half (again just a preference), and as suggested I doubled the amount of the crumb topping and added 1/3 cup of oatmeal.

Easy to prepare and I used other's suggestions: -doubled the butter in topping -made extra topping -added some allspice -doubled the flour in the mix to toss with apples it was sweet but then again, it's apple pie!!  Not runny at all with the extra flour added...yummy!

This recipe is delicious.  The filling was very runny because I made the mistake of doubling the sugar/flour/cinnamon since I had a 10 inch deep pie plate I used almost 11 cups of apples.  Even though it's runny it still tastes fantastic.  I was looking for more of an apple crisp so I didn't use a pie crust on the bottom.  Absolutely fantastic.

I've used this recipe twice already. It's delicious and the crumb on top of the pie is fantastic. My bf is very picky about his pie and he loved it. Note, the bottom shell you choose can improve the pie overall (taste and appearance). First time I made it, I used a generic pie shell from the grocery store. Second time, I used Keebler's shortbread crust which made it a whole lot better. They also have a graham crust which I think would be good as well.

Do not make this if you are on a diet! It's the most amazing apple pie you will have ever tasted. I did make a few changes based on what I enjoy in an apple pie. I doubled the flour in the mix with the apples and no problems with it being runny even when warm and because I used pastry that I made at home, I sprinkled 1/2 tblpn of extra flour on the bottom of the pastry shell like my Dad taught me, plus a sprinkle of Chinese Five Spice which has cinnamon, anise, fennel, ginger, licorice root and cloves. I also added a tablespoon of this spice to the apples. I didn't use the optional walnuts or raisins and this pie was the best pie I have ever tasted! I sliced the apples very thinly. I served it with thickened cream - KEEPER!!

I made this pie Thanksgiving of 2006 and just found it in my recipe box! Everyone loved it with a few changes I made based on other reviews. I added 2 T. of flour to the coating and used dried cranberries instead of raisins, Yum!! I also left out the walnuts since I don't like them and nobody was complaining :o)

This pie was very tasty! My only complaint is that the next day the topping is quite soggy... which I find kind of gross. But, if you are pretty sure that it will get eaten the first day then it is excellent!

Excellent pie! I made it for our Thanksgiving dinner and someone else brought a Baker's Square pie and mine was gone in minutes and nobody touched the professionally made pie. I didn't add any raisins or nuts just extra apples. I used granny smith and Macintosh apples. I also chopped up a handful of pecans to mix into the crumb topping. When the pie came out of the oven I drizzled just a little caramel syrup (ice cream topping) over the crumb topping. The pie was out of this world! I will never use another apple pie recipe again...this one is a keeper!

Great base recipe, I used half granny smith, half gala.  I used only a 1/4 cup of sugar and it was perfect for my taste. I left out the raisins and walnuts but did throw a half a cup of chopped pecans into the crumb mixture, which I made in the food processor.  I doubled the crumb topping as others did but it wasn't necessary at all, I had way too much. Served with vanilla ice cream YUMMY!

This is very good pie. I doubled the topping as another reveiwer suggested and I only ended up using half of what I made. So next time I followed follow the recipe.  The recipe is perfect as is.

This pie is wonderful!  It was my first ever attempt at baking a homemade apple pie, and my boyfriend & I are very pleased!    I did choose to leave out the raisins and nuts, though.  I know I'll be making this pie again and again!

Wow! Thumbs up!  This was wonderful. I did double the crumb mixture and add more cinnomon to the apple mix and a teaspoon of butter.  We all loved this.  Thank you!

The crust was soggy on the bottom, the topping wasn't crispy, and the filling was watery.

This is a great pie recipe. I also made this without the crust, but I did put the topping on it. Yes, I said NO CRUST. It was great. Thanks!

This pie is delicious! My family loved it and it was very easy to make. I definately think the lemon juice is necessary and not optional. It really breaks up the sweetness. I omitted the raisins and walnuts because my family wouldn't enjoy that. I did however add an extra tablespoon of flour to the apple mixture (as suggested by other Reviewers) and I also doubled the crumb topping for extra goodness! This is a keeper!

I left out the walnuts & raisins, and this was a good apple pie, just not the best I've had. The crumble didn't crisp up much for me, and (believe or not!) I thought it was a little too sweet. I still managed to eat 2 pieces--all in the name of research, of course.

I'm not into raisins at all but my husband loves them so I added them and to my surprise it was delicious... I only used 5 cups of apples and I still had leftover filling... it was a bit sweet so next time will probably use granny smith instead of red apples as suggested... WILL ADD THIS ONE TO MY COLLECTION.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

My first time making an apple pie and this turned out wonderful!  I didn't need to add any extra flour to this recipe and it was not runny at all.  I did use the raisins and walnuts along with granny smith apples.  My husband loved it, and he doesn't usually like fruit pies.  No need to look any further for a recipe, I'll be using this one every time.

This pie would have won 1st place at the fair! It was the best apple pie I have ever eaten. I made a few changes that perfected it. I used golden apples this time and I added 2 Tbs of melted butter and 2 Tbs of sour cream cover the apples before adding the spices and flour mixture. I omitted the raisins and walnuts. I baked it for 50 minutes uncovered, then put it under the broiler for a couple minutes to turn the crumb topping golden brown -Watch it so it doesn't burn.

I really wanted to give this a 5 stars. But one thing lead it to a 4 stars, maybe it was my fault, but it was very runny (liquidy) at the bottom. I would slice a piece and then a bunch of liquid would fill up the space. Other than that, my family loved it. The flavor was great. I made the Pie Crust IV from this site. Very good almost a 5 stars.

Excellent recipe, very simple and most of all fun to make. I omitted the raisins and walnuts and used granny smith apples. I also used orange juice in place of the lemon juice and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the filling. For the topping I doubled it and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture. For the crust I used the French pir crust recipe found on this site, GREAT crust recipe I might add. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I followed this recipie exactly, and diid not add the raisins or walnuts.  The pie filling was very gritty, for no apparent reason.  The taste was good, the crumb topping idea was good, but for some reason the filling was gritty, so I will continue searching for an apple crumb pie recipie.

Not much room for improvement on this pie, however, a little butter added to the apples before putting on the crumb crust makes it even better.

I was very excited to try this recipe. The reviews were all so high. WELL……..I hate to dampen those reviews, but I just wasn't all that impressed. I love my apple pie and have never ventured. I just thought with this high rated version it would be at least comparable- But NO WAY. Good, but nothing special. I will never make it again. Does not keep well for left overs- It gets a real bad taste.

Simple yet elegant! It was so easy to make and it looked beautiful with all the crumbs on the apples. I left a bit of the peel on the apples and when I cut into the pie, it looked beautiful with a tinge of pink. I also added a bit more lemon juice to add some flavor and it was a hit!

Instead of the tranditional sweet potato or pumpkin pie, we made this! At first, we thought of pecan pie but this was one of the TOP ten so... IT WAS AWESOME!

My daughter and I made this for her first grade teacher.  The teacher kept teasing the children after they went apple picking about making her an apple pie.

She raves about it every time I see her and asked for the recipe.  I was so happy to her she loved it because it was the first time I used this recipe, I usually try them out before making something for other people.

I have to make one this weekend for my family because she keeps saying it is the best apple pie she has ever had.

I preface this with I give it only 4 stars because I made it twice: the first was good but the second time I tweaked it: 

Doubled the topping:
1 cup flour
 8 tbl butter
3/4 c light brown sugar 
1/4 c white sugar
1/2 tsp cinnamon
pinch nutmeg
--- RAVE reviews!! 
BTW used Crispin apples.

I am a very experienced cook and baker and this one of the better pies I have ever made. I am anxious to make it again with the addition of raisins. Try it!!

Made it according to the recipe. The apples that I used where Honey Crisp, and as the name implies stayed nice and crisp throughout the baking process. Both, my wife and I loved it, worth trying.

My favorite apple pie of all time!  I first made this 3-4 years ago and have faithfully used it every apple season since.  I agree with adding a little more flour to the apples to reduce juiciness.  I also add 1/2c oatmeal to the topping to make it even more yummy.  9no walnuts or raisins for me)
One useful thing I discovered: the filling freezes really well.  One year I had a ton of apples so I made up some batches of this filling - apples, flour, cinnamon and nutmeg - then froze in a tupperware type container.  It was a great and easy way to make apple pies over the holidays - just thaw out your filling, fill a crust and make the topping.  Simple and delicious!

This was very good.  I baked it a bit longer than the recipe called for (35 minutes with foil and 35 minutes without) and I put an extra tablespoon of flour to the apple filling.  I let the pie cool right down and it turned out perfect... not liquidy in the slightest.  Will definitely make again!  :-)

This pie is delicious! I don't understand the negative reviews. I added an extra Tbsp of flour to the apple mixture (as some people suggested to thicken the sauce) and it was a perfect consistency. I also made 50% more of the crumb topping. What can I say?? I want every inch covered in crumbs! It was super easy to make and my 4 year old daughter enjoyed helping me put it together. You will definitely keep getting requests for this one!

Amazing! Soaked raisins in Amaretto as another reviewer suggested and used Grandma Ruth's pie crust. So very delicious!

The pie wasn't bad. I read the reviews and took the advice of others that I should double the crumb topping, I wish I wouldn't have. I used red apples so I cut back on the sugar but it was still too sweet (even when you scrapped most of the crumb topping off. I also think this pie would be better using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar or all brown. You will also need to add an additional 5-10 minutes of cooking time. Like many others have stated the pie will be somewhat watery.

This was the first pie I've ever made and it was delicious.  My husband said it was the best pie he's ever had, even brought slices to work for his co-workers. I used gala apples, which I peeled before using.

My favorite pie recipe!  Yum.  I use 1/4c white & 1/4c brown sugar.  I'll try even less next time.  More than 1/2t cinnamon & more than 1/8t of nutmeg. And just a small handful or raisins.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I had been using another recipe which after using this, I now deem so-so.  This one is so delicious I keep making and making and making apple pies!

This is the best apple pie I have ever had! It was gone within hours. My husband loved it so much he asked me to make the next day. I didn't use the nuts or raisins and only used 4-5 Granny Smith apples. But that's just my preference. The taste is amazing. Not too sweet, the nutmeg gives it a wonderful fall earthy flavor. Perfect.

First time making this "Dutch" apple pie and it was so awesome.  My father-in-law said it was the best pie ever and he's 87! Everyone else just raved about it. Served warm with premium vanilla ice cream.  Definitely an easy recipe that tastes like a lot of work!

I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.  For the topping, I added 1/2 cup oats plus 1 1/2 tbsp. butter and I used buckwheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  Brought the pie over to contribute to dinner with a group of friends and it was a hit!  Very tasty.  

I used MacIntosh apples (smaller), next time I'll add a couple more apples because I prefer a higher pie.

This recipe is great. However, for me, it was a little too sweet even though I cut back on the white sugar just a tad. I did double the topping though. Next time I may not double the topping and perhaps it will be better balanced. The topping was super tasty and crispy. The filling was wonderful and perfectly spiced. Very easy recipe. I used the 'Basic Flaky Pie Crust' recipe from this site and rolled it really thin and it turned out perfect. Don't forget to brush the crust with egg white, poke holes in the bottom of the crust and par-bake it for 10 minutes. Then let it cool somewhat and pour the filling inside. This will prevent the crust from becoming soggy, and will add a nice color to the crust.

This was my first time making a pie and I was a little intimidated. But the recipe was a breeze. The pie tasted amazing and I was surprised how well it turned out. Make sure you eat in within a day or two, otherwise it will become soggy and wet.

I've never made a homemade pie before so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. But it was delicious. I have no doubt in my mind that ill use this recipe again. In fact, Ill probably right it down just in case allrecipes vanishes. I wouldn't want to lose it!

Made this tonight and it was wonderful!  I did double the flour on the apples.  I also doubled the crumb topping but I had some left over. I think doing the topping x1.5 would work better.  I omitted the lemon/raisins/nut, which were all optional. I used half Granny Smith and half Pink Ladies. Definitely making this again!

Wow! This recipe really lives up to it's ratings. I make apple pie every year for Thanksgiving because my mom's thing is pumpkin. And haven't gotten it quite right until this year. I was excited to try this because I find a double crust to be too decadent after the meal. I used the pie crust recipe from How To Cook Everything by Mark Bittman. Then I used 7 granny smith apples, upped the flour (to be mixed with apples) to 1/4 cup. I found the amount of crumb topping to be perfect. I baked it 10 extra minutes because when I went to take it out, the juices still looked pretty liquidy and another 10 minutes did the trick- it was not watery whatsoever. Will definitely be making this one again!

This review is for the crumb topping only; I used a pre-made crust, and my home canned pie filling. I added 1/4 cup of quick oats and, with that addition, there was plenty of topping for the pie. In fact, I couldn't have fit more on if I tried. It's a delicious and easy recipe with less butter used than other recipes I've seen, which is a plus.

This is the best apple pie I've ever tasted. I only had 4 apples (I used Granny Smiths) and that was even too much to fit in the pie shell.  I actually used confectioner's sugar in the actual apples instead of regular sugar because that's all I had on hand.  I used the lemon juice but not the raisins or the walnuts.  I needed a tiny amount of extra butter to make the topping crumbly.  The crumb topping was the perfect amount to cover the entire pie.  For the little amount of cinnamon and nutmeg you use, it gives the apples a perfect flavor.  It was very easy to make and uses very few ingredients.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made this pie last night and it was quick, easy, and delicious. I had all the ingredients at home, except for the pie crust. I didn't add raisins or walnuts, but I must say the lemon was essential, and gave a tang to the pie. I mixed white and brown sugar for the pie mixture, I did sub all spice for the nutmeg, and I should have followed the advice of one of the reviews and doubled the crumb toppings. Great pie!

The pie turned out picture perfect, which never happens for me with pies, so I'm very happy! The crumb topping is very good; I doubled it as others have recommended. The filling (without the raisins, nuts, and lemon juice) is not overly sweet, but if you don't like sweet pie fillings, I would recommend reducing sugar to 1/2 cup.

This pie was a hit at our house.  I omitted the lemon juice, raisins, and walnuts, and used 1/3 Cup of Truvia baking blend instead of sugar.  I used Jonagold apples from the orchard.  I have made two pies already and plan to make a lot more, thank you!

First homemade apple pie, slicing and coreing, followed recipe exactly. Don't be afraid to get your hands in there and really mix it up. I felt every apple was perfectly coated. The crumb was my first time. I tried it once with butter spread and created a dough decided it was just flour and I should throw away and try again, even googled pics to see how it should look.  Second time, still wasn't sure because it was very powdery but said hey it's just butter it's gonna taste good! So I evenly sprinkled it over cook for said time. I was making soup at the time and had left over bacon crumbles, put those on top of the pie as we'll, although just half bc I didn't want to ruin it if back wasn't good. Turns out the whole pie was awesome. Great recipe. Follow portions but mix it up real good or it might get too sweet.

The apple pie was great. Easy to make and very tasty.  I adjusted the recipe slightly - I put the nutmeg and cinnamon in the topping instead of with the apples.  As per the suggestions of several reviewers I doubled the topping (excpet the spices) and the flour. It was not runny at all and we ate it warm.  My daughters don't even like pie (or cake for that matter) really liked it. I used Paula Red apples.

Love this quick and easy recipe. The only thing I did different was to top it with the other pie shell and top THAT with the streusel topping. I didn't add nuts or raisins because I like the old-fashioned apple pie.

This is the best apple pie I've ever made.  Apple pie is my favorite dessert so I've been searching for a great recipe.  I used a deep dish pie pan, a combination of Braeburn and Granny Smith apples, 4 tbsp flour, 1 tsp of apple pie spice since it's what I had on hand, 1/2 cup sugar in the filling since I don't like overly sweet desserts.  I also added in a big pinch of salt to both the apple filling and crumb topping since all desserts benefit from salt to balance sweetness.  I also highly recommend using the lemon juice since it will also balance sweetness.  For my tastes next time I will reduce the sugar in the crumb topping but as it is now it is still lovely and delicious.  The pie was not runny since I used two additional tbsp of flour.  Thank you for a terrific apple pie recipe!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. It was delicious and a big hit with everyone.  I used Winesap apples which have a great taste and, although they soften in cooking, they hold their shape and don't become mush; they're great for baking.  I didn't use raisins or nuts (don't like raisins and have folks with nut allergies).  I made a few alterations - doubled the cinnamon/nutmeg and increased the butter for the crumb topping to 5 Tblsp. Also, I mixed into the pie filling 2 Tblsp of instant tapioca, and let it stand for 15 mins before baking. I had no problems with the pie being watery/runny. Everyone was asking me for this recipe! Best apple pie I ever made.

I made this recipe tonight. I typically use jonathon's in my apple pie but I was looking for something different. After reading many of the reviews, I used 3 Jonagold's and 3 granny smith's. Excellent choice! I also increased the flour from 2 TBSP to 4 TBSP so that it wouldn't be too runny and it turned out perfectly. Probably the only thing was that my topping looked a little sloppy and not great for presentation (not sure if I did something wrong or maybe this is how everyone's looks)....but boy did the whole thing taste good!!! Really good! We LOVED it! And I did use the raisins and walnuts. Added great flavor and texture. This recipe is a keeper! And thank you to the other people who shared their helpful reviews and tips.

This recipe was wonderful!! I was looking for a pie recipe with a crumble toping and came across this one. I thought it was the best apple pie I've ever had. I made two pies. I had read some of the comments about there not being enough crumble topping so I made 1 and a 1/2 recipes of topping and it was perfect for the 2 pies I made. I had also read that someone thought the pie was kind of soupy so I added an extra tablespoon of flour to the dry ingredients that get poured over the apples. This recipe is definitely going into my favorites and I thought it was so good that i'm making plates of pie to take to the neighbors!

I loved this -- so easy- so basic- fool proof.  The type of apples really do make a difference- can be a wee bit runny---I  tried a bit of a  tart apple to help counter the sugar...--EITHER WAY-- still super Yummy!!!

I followed this recipe exactly other than I made enough to make 2 pies and it turned out amazing! The only thing I changed on this is I doubled the crumb topping because this made enough for 2 pies.. I highly recommend this pie recipe!

I loved the crumb topping, but the apples were dry and hard. I'd also recommend reducing the amount of apples to about 4 cups.

I found this to be overly sweet, and therefore if i were to make it again then i would definitely cut down on the sugar.
However I added the walnuts to the topping which gave it a great crunch..

Loved this! Made it for my husband who is fron England and loves a good crumble.  I left out the nutmeg, raisins and nuts to start...might add them next time.  I made double crumbs in order to cover all the apples. It was delicous!!

I have made this pie numerous times now. Every single time, my family raves over how delicious it is. The only changes I make is that I use an entire lime instead of 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  I don't add the raisins, although I have added the walnuts a few times.  This last time I added fresh cranberries for Thanksgiving and my family raved over it.

I used Cortland apples, and added Amaretto soaked raisins, and my pie was delicious. I think next time I will: use a more tart apple (as this recipe is quite sweet), cut the apples thicker, and move the pie from the bottom to the top rack for the last 25 minutes.

First time I made it - today - I added extra flour like the others suggested, I used Pink Lady apples, and I left it in the oven for longer than instructed because my husband likes the apples very tender. He and my son loved it!! Thanks for sharing, it is definitely a keeper ;0)

Wow! This was delicious and the BEST apple pie ever! I wish I could give this one a 10 plus. I even added a little more crumb topping and it came out great.  I only used 4 granny smith apples and it was just the right amount for one apple pie. YUM!! Think I will make this again soon. My hubby loved this as well n gave it a 10 plus as well.

This pie was outstanding!  I used a deep dish pie shell and 4 apples and it was just the right amount.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of topping.  Next time I won't double it, but will make one and a half the amount.  Doubling it produced just a bit more than I could fit on the pie.

GREAT pie!!! I used a homemade crust I got on here and omited the raisins.  I did use the walnuts but added them to the streusel instead of to the apples.  It was super easy and OMG delicious.  I actually got accused of serving store bought. But no store could top this.  I used the basic flaky pie crust recipe on here and it was easy and flaky and light.  PERFECT for this pie

I have used this recipe at least 10 times, and I must say that everyone who has tried it, love it! I normally add a teaspoon of tapioca to the recipe so that the filling is not runny, and substitute a little bit of white sugar with brown. At times, I also add a dash of rum to it. Great recipe!

I have never made a pie before.  I followed this recipe (minus the raisins) and my friends loved it. I was reallly worried about the apples coming out right but if you slice them thin and follow the cooking time, everything will come out great!

This pie was so easy!! I made it the morning before it was to be served and it came out perfect. I followed the recipe exactly except for the crumb topping. Some people said that they needed to double it, but others said they didn't. I decided to make 1 1/2 times the amount and that seemed like a very good amount.

This was delicious! However, I rated it a 4 instead of 5 star because it was very runny the day of baking. It firmed up the next day but I didn't care for the runny texture. If I make it again, I'll add more flour. That being said, the person I made this for is a pie-lover, and he told me it was the BEST pie he'd EVER had!!

I made this last Christmas and I was absolutely amazed!  I actually made a pie that was THE BEST PIE I EVER TASTED!!!  I was shocked because I have never made a decent pie before this one.  I am making four of them for Thanksgiving this year and I will be so proud to share what I created.  Absolutely, hands down, the best pie ever!  Thanks for sharing it.  :o)

So easy and sooooo good!  Used 4 granny smiths and 2 honey crisps, used brown sugar instead of white, left out the raisins and walnuts, but added a 1/2 cup of crushed pecans to the crumble mixture with an extra tablespoon or so of butter.  Usually i cut back on the sugar that a recipe calls for because i don't like things too sugary sweet, but the combo of the granny smiths gave the perfect balance of tart and sweet.

This was really good I did add a lil bit more flour to the filling, I would have given 4 stars but had slight issues with the crumb topping  but it was still delish especially when you add a scoop of ice cream ! will be making this again and again !

Tonight was my 19th wedding anniversary.  Made a special dinner and served this for dessert.   It was delicious.  Thank you so much for posting it.   I did add the extra 2 Tbs. of flour as suggested.  It was perfect in every way.     I also just went apple picking.  I am planning to make the inside of this pie several times over and freeze in individual freezer containers to have a quick dessert on hand.

Four stars only because it was incredibly runny; I put it back into the oven for 15-20 mins and let it cool. Only then did it congeal sufficiently.

This is hands-down the absolute best apple crumb pie I have ever eaten.  I followed the recipe to the letter, using Granny Smith apples, and it turned out beautifully.  We skipped dinner tonight and ate pie instead!

This is scrumptious.....and easy.  Definitely put in the raisins and walnuts.  I made it exactly as recipe, let it cool and then put into frig until a couple of hours before dinner.....not runny at all; just perfect!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  Any time I want apple pie.....this will be the one I make.

Delicious! I made this just as written except for doubling the crumb topping. It IS very sweet ... even with the very tart apples I used ... but then doubling the topping and including raisins added sweetness to it. This pie got better and better as it sat ... one of the best apple pies I've tasted. :)

This is the first time I make an apple pie. I made it while I was having guests, when it was all done the house smelled amazing. It was perfect, and the crunshyness from the walnut (I added more than what is listed in the recipe) completed this pie. Everyone loved it.

i love crumb pies.  i added a little extra crumb (not nearly double - just a little extra).  i didn't have walnuts or raisins, but i did steal some dried cranberries from my roommate and added those, along with 1/4 teaspoon cloves.  i also went heavy on the cinammon and nutmeg, and used only 1/2 cup white sugar.  i precooked the apples for about 10 minutes on the stove, drained the liquid, reduced that further on the stove, and added back to the filling.  the apples were still a tad crisp; next time i might precook them longer.  the smell of my kitchen while preparing this pie was spectacular!

This is my new go-to family get-together pie! Eeryone loves it. I have added more apples both times I made it just to make it larger, and everything still measures out just fine. An instant pie crust on bottom and the crumb topping makes this a quick homemade apple pie.

I made this at Thanksgiving, and around Christmastime, my fiance asked me why I hadn't made it again yet. Then he proceeded to reminisce about how amazing it was! It was a definite hit among the guests at Thanksgiving, even though it was my first pie experience. My only complaint is that it seemed like way too many apples to fit into one crust -- maybe my frozen crust was smaller than most? I ended up making 2 pies and putting half the apples in each, and once it baked, the apples had reduced in size enough that I wished that I had just tried to cram them all into one pie crust, after all. Maybe next time I'll reduce the amount of apples so that they all fit into one crust. Other than that, 5 stars. Easy and very yummy!

Excellent, easy pie. I used granny smith apples and cut the sugar from 3/4 c to 1/2 c. The pie looked very juicy when I took it out of the oven, but it was perfect after sitting for 30 minutes. I served this with vanilla ice cream. I will most definitely make this again!

Everybody loved this pie!  One thing I would change is maybe adding a little less sugar to the apples.  I will definitely serve this again.

I was extremely optimistic about this pie after all of the reviews.  I followed the recipe and also did double the topping like MANY reviewers suggested. I have been complimented before on my pie, and this was just bad.  I will NOT be using this recipe again.  I am very disappointed!!

Great recipe!  Used with "Best Ever Pie Crust", added nutmeg and doubled the flour and crumble, per other reviews, and it was fantastic!

Nice pie! I did however add about 3 cups more apples and 1/8 teaspoon of allspice. I also doubled the topping and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to that. By adding more apples, the apples were more crunchy instead of mushy.

So delicious!  Adding this to my permanent recipe file.  I recently made this and Grandma Ople's Apple Pie and it was a tossup as to which was better.

I cut this recipe in half and then split it between four mini cocottes lined with homemade pie crust, add lg chopped walnuts and dried cherries to the apple mixture and fine chopped walnuts to the topping and then cook them in the toaster oven.  They're delicious, but be careful not to burn them as they cook way faster!

very good!  I used a homemade buttermilk crust recipe in a 9.5 inch pie plate.  turned out very well would certainly make again.  omitted raisins and walnuts per request.  I selected this recipe over others because it does not call for crazy amounts of butter, like others I found and requires no precooking of the apples.  might have to add this to my Christmas baking list!  thanks for sharing!

My first pie ever and it turned out fantastic! I did add a tablespoon of flour to the pie filling. I also cut half the flour from the crumble and substituted oats. The nuts and raisins were a great addition.

This pie was excellent, and super easy.  I had some Granny Smith apples from our apple tree that I used.  I have never used raisins in an apple pie before but tried it with this recipe.  They plumped up with juicy pie filling and were a nice treat with the tart apples.  I also added one large handful of oats in my topping to make it a little more chewey.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  My family gobbled this pie up in one evening, and we will be making it again soon. :)

DE-LISH!  I didn't make it "as-is" because I was out of raisins.  I used a dried mixed berries (had golden raisins in it too).  I also erred on the side of caution and doubled the amount of flour added to the apples.  I used a mixture of Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples.  Kept the sugar amount the same.  And I doubled the crumb topping (although doubling was too much - I didn't use it all).  The pie turned out fantastic and it was a hit with the fam!

The pie tasted GREAT, especially with the addition of raisins and walnuts.  My only complaint is that there was a lot of water left in the pie pan.  I don't know if that's the kind of apple I used?  I had a lot of golden delicious left from an apple-picking expedition that were very good.  The crumb topping was delicious as well!

I was hoping for a bigger topping, but the pie still tasted great. I used the lemon juice & walnuts, but no raisins.

I added the walnuts and raisins. Before adding the raisins, I soaked them in 3 Tbsp. amaretto for about 4 hours. Also reduced sugar to 1/2 cup as others suggested. I'm not a fan of apple pie and I went back for a second slice :)

This recipe makes quite a good apple pie.  I added raisins and walnuts.  I also made it with a single HUGE apple!  Nothing beats warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream.

This was the first apple pie I have ever made and it came out perfect. I followed the recipe (left out the walnuts and raisins due to allergies)and doubled the crumb topping and it came out delicious. I took it to a family gathering and it got rave reviews. I will definitely be making this one again. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is my favorite pie recipe. It comes out perfect as is (minus nuts and raisins). I use MacIntosh apples for the best flavor and home made crust. It's worth the little extra effort. Fabulous!

I used extra paradise apples from my CSA and this turned out to be truly delicious. I've never liked apple pie, but this may have changed my mind. I didn't have raisins or walnuts so I just used a little more apple. I also added about 1.5 tbsp cornstarch in addition to the flour. The pie had a great consistency and wasn't watery at all.

WOW. This pie was amazing. The only thing we changed was to add only 1/2 cup of sugar rather than 3/4, and I added a little more cinnamon to suit our tastes. Magnificent, melt in your mouth pie. Thank you for the recipe!!

This turned out to be one of the best pies I've baked...ever. (And I've made a lot!) I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and omitted the walnuts and raisins as hubby no likey. It has a perfect balance of sweet and tart. Excellent taste, easy to make and makes a lovely presentation! What's not to like??

Very Good! It needs to be made in a deep dish pie crust. I made it in a regular crust and doubled the crumb mixture as suggested by others and it did spill over. But I lined my cookie sheet with crinkled foil. I did use 2 more tablespoons of flour with the apples to thicken it up. Very tasty. Everyone loved it. I will make it again.

Had a lot of Empire apples on hand so I decided to make this pie so not to let them go to waste - very easy to make however my family found this to be to sweet next time will try different apples and cut sugars back some - vanilla ice cream on top a plus for this.

Update: Made this morning for dinner later at mom's. I make it with the refrigerated store bought pie crust, 6 large granny smith apples, and I did add 2 xtr TB of flour to thicken the juice. I also put in the raisins and walnuts. I also added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and as usual doubled up the crumb topping mixture. It looks beautiful and I can't wait to taste!

I've had bad experience making pies in the past but this pie came out perfect. I wish I would have taken a picture- it looked award winning. It tasted even better. I made this months ago and now after thinking back, I'm drooling!!

This pie was excellent!  I had an extra pie crust, but just one, and some apples I didn't think I was going to use in another recipe, so I wanted to make an apple pie.  I selected this recipe due to the alternative to an upper pie crust.  I ended up using a spice mix given to me by a friend (in a gift set from Crate and Barrel) as I didn't think that the spices in the recipe would be sufficient.  I didn't add any of the optional ingredients either.  This is a classic pie with a twist that turned out wonderfully!

This was a very good pie, better the next day.  I added some oats to the topping and the raisens were a nice change.  Cinnamon added to vanilla ice cream makes a great topping! Yum!

Wonderful! I added golden raisins and walnuts and it had a great flavor! However, be sure to check that your apples are done cooking. After following the directions mine were still a bit raw.

I had a 5-star apple pie recipe that I always made.  Until one day I wanted to make an apple pie but only had one crust so I decided to try this recipe.  This is my new favorite and the one I always make.  Easier than a double crust pie too.

I don't even like apple pie and this was awesome.  Brought it to a party and the whole thing was gone in a matter of minutes.  I doubled the crumb-top ingredients as was suggested.  Next time however, I will definitely reduce the amount of sugar in the pie.  It was way too sweet for most.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used Cameo and Gala apples because it was what I had on hand.  My husband loved the crumb topping so much that he recommended doubling it for next time.

ABSOLUTELY Fantastic. This is an easy and Excellent recipe. First time I made it I made 2 pies, next time I made 6. I wouldn't change a thing. I used raisins in some of the pies- either way it's a good pie recipe!!

I really loved this recipe except it was a bit sweet but it came looking beautifully!

Perhaps one of the reasons mine came out sweet was the addition of craisins which have their own sugar, but the topping is super sweet but still very good.

I will be making this pie for Thanksgiving at my mothers with the addition of some caramel just under the topping. It is a request!

OMGosh!  Sooo good.  Can't keep it in the house.  I double the spices and also double the topping.  I made one the other night to give to my in-laws and my seven-year-old had a nervous breakdown when he realized that he wasn't getting a piece!

Hands down the best apple pie recipe! I did not add the walnuts, but it still turned out perfectly. I used roughly 4 granny smith apples. I also doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg with the apple mixture as well as doubling the crumb topping. For a couple minutes at the end I put the pie under the broiler on low to give it a nice crisp texture. Make sure to place a pan beneath the pie plate to prevent drippings from falling on the oven! I used the French Pastry Pie Crust recipe from this site and it was perfect. I made this for the Fourth of July and it was loved by everyone!

This pie was easy and great but needs more spice.  At least double or triple the amount cinnamon and nutmeg in the filling.  Like others I would also increase the amount of crumb topping maybe 1 and a half times what the recipe calls for.

I added 1/4c of flour instead of 2tbsp; no problems with runniness. (The suggestions to put the pie pan on a cookie sheet, with aluminum foil underneath were very helpful - I was glad I didn't get caramel all over my oven from the dripping while baking!) Also excluded the raisins/nuts, as I didn't have any on hand. Despite those omissions this recipe was wonderful! The flavor was good, the top was nicely crunchy, and the apples had a good texture. (I did decrease the sugar to 1/2c since I was using sweeter apples rather than cooking apples). There was plenty of topping, even though I made it as specified rather than doubling it. This recipe got a big thumbs-up from both my husband and I. :)

This pie was a hit for our New Year's Day celebration.  Absolutely delicious. I'm sad that I had to be polite and leave the reamaining piece at our hosts! I used organic whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and there was no trouble.  Also, I couldn't fit 6 cups of apples into the pie crust even with strategically placing them- so don't waste your apples! Only use 4 large/5 small apples.  Enjoy.

I just made this for the first time yesterday (my very first pie too) and WOW! I was having people over for dinner and this was dessert. Everyone thought it was great. I used Granny Smith apples, and added a little more flour to the apple mix (as others suggested here) I also doubled the crumb mixture and I'm glad I did. Thank you for making me look like I know what I'm doing, lol.  ;)

This recipe never fails me. My boss and others have even told me that this apple pie is better than those made by their mothers. One nifty thing I like to do with this recipe is add another pie crust (from scratch) on top of the crumb topping. I like this recipe for the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" - http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Basic-Flaky-Pie-Crust/Detail.aspx

this restored my confidence in baking. my baking attempts are always a failure. but when i tried this recipe, i made a successful pie. it was delicious and so easy to make. my mom loves it. i didn't use raisins or walnuts, just plain cinnamon and nutmeg. i doubled the measurement for the crumb mixture to completely and overfill the top of the pie. love it!

Added caradmon, skipped the raisins, and included oates in the crumble topping.  I used Granny Smiths, and it was still really sweet.  I think next time I'll use less brown sugar in the crumble.  It came out great and got rave reviews!

This was wonderful!  The only changes we made were to double the flour and spices and add a dash of ginger and cardamom and left out the raisins.  We used fuji apples.  Other than the flour, this recipe will work perfectly as written.  Try this with the canola oil pie crust on the site.

Wonderful!  Don't get too excited to cut into it.  It needs to sit and cool for at least 30 minutes.  The nuts and raisins made it.

This tasted very good.  I added the extra water but still poured off 1/2 cup of liquid before cutting and it was still a little juicy.  Maybe the difference in apples. Taste was Wonderful though.

I know I'm in the minority with this review, but was disappointed and embarrassed by this pie!  While this pie looked and smelled delicious, it was rather tasteless.  I doubled the crumbled crust and used more flour as other reviewers advised, but was still disappointed.

This was fantastic.  My husband has been bugging me for months to make an apple pie.  I choose this one because my good friend Kez recommended it.  I am glad I did, and so is my hubby!  I did double the flour in with the apples and left everything else the same.  So good, I am sure that I will be making this again!  Thank you so much for the great recipe.

Mine didn't turn out too great. The crumble topping wouldn't get crumbly for me; it was kind of gooey. And I cooked it for the full 50 minutes but the apples were still very crunchy. Not a bad apple pie by any means, but not the best I've ever had or made. I will be trying a different recipe next time. 

By the way, I followed it exactly except left out raisins.

This pie made my house smell terrific!  I heard somewhere that a pie might get runny depending on the types of apples you use.  I used Granny Smith.  I also heard you can add a Tablespoon of lemon jello to the apple mixture to thicken it up, so I did and it worked.  My pie wasn't runny at all.  This pie has a great flavor, especially with the walnuts in it.  Looks great coming out of the oven but after it cools it sinks down a little bit.

Excellent apple pie recipe.  Nice change from traditional apple pie with the raisins and walnuts.  I did as others had mentioned by adding 2 extra tablespoons of flour.  Very nice texture not runny at all.  Thanks for the tips.

This was perfect! I omitted the walnuts & nutmeg (only because I didn't have any). Other than that, I followed the directions exactly. Delicious! My new favorite Apple Pie recipe.

By far has to be the best pie I ever made!  I have been looking for different apple pie recipes to make with the crab apples from my trees, and this recipe makes these tart apples taste sweet! I used 1/4 cup of flour rather than 2 tbsp, 2 tsp apple pie spice, instead of the cinnamon and nutmeg, and mixed these ingredients with the apples, rather than layering them.
I over-loaded the pie shell with the sliced apples.  I also used the walnuts, and no raisins.  YUMMM!

This pie was amazing. I used little mini tart shells that i found in my freezer instead of the 9 inch shell and they made great individual pies. Will definatley make again.

WOW!  i made this for thanksgiving last year and it was excellent.  both my husband and i thought that it was better than my mother-in-law's double crust apple pie that he's loved since he was a little boy.  i used dark brown sugar for the topping to give it a little more of richer flavor.  also, i highly recommend making a butter crust instead of a crisco crust.  i think that was the key for making this pie as delectable as it was! i'll be making this again this wednesday for thanksgiving.

Excellent apple pie!  This was the fist pie I have ever made and it came out wonderful!  I used macintosh apples for the pie and for the crumbs used 3/4c flour, 1/2c white sugar & 5T of butter.  Next I am going to learn how to make a really good crust.  BTW ~ My husband loved it.  Big compliment, since his mom makes an incredible apple crumb pie.  Can't wait to make it again!

I substituted the apples with strawberries and omitted the raisins and walnuts. The pie was delicious! We were worried that cinnamon wouldn't go with the taste of strawberries, but it turns out that we could hardly taste the cinnamon. We only used 4 cups of strawberries and there was still way too much filling, which caused the crumbs to sink and the filling to ooze out and create a huge mess. Be sure to place an aluminium foil paper under the pie in case this happens. Also, the strawberry mixture became really 'watery' (even after draining it slightly); next time I'd squeeze all the juice out before putting it on the pie.

This recipe was so delicious! The choices for apple pie recipes can sometimes be overwhelming, but I guarantee this one is tasty AND easy! For a little extra crunch, I would suggest adding a sprinkling of oats to the topping! Thanks for then great recipe, Jackie! I love it! And so does my husband! And warmed up with some vanilla ice cream makes it to die for!

This pie is so good and SO EASY!  I followed the recipe but added a little cinnamon and some ground walnuts to the topping mixture.  Just delicious!  I used MacIntosh apples and they cooked perfectly!  It's like apple crisp in a pie shell.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great tasting pie!  the one reviewer who didn't like said her family recipe was better but she didn't submit hers so I still say this is great!  This many reviews can't be wrong.  My husband and son love love love it and so does anyone who ever tasted it! Don't hesitate to make it.

Yummy!!!  However, depending on the type of apples used, you might want to reduce the amount of sugar in the filling and the topping.  Overall, a winner!!

I followed this recipe to a T and got RUNNY filling. Sooooo disappointed. It sat OVERNIGHT as some mentioned (instead of eating right out the oven). I’m going to go back to my old pre-internet recipe. I should have listened to the others that mentioned more flour, but then I’d be altering the recipe, so as is, I give 3 stars. I baked this for my coworkers bday. So the pics I have are before cutting. Very disappointed.

Use fold-out crust. Free form it! 

Use 7-8 GREEN apples. Peel and cut into approximately 1/2 pieces. 
Be sure you mix all filling ingredients in bowl before stirring in cut apples. 
Use 1 cup sugar for filling. Too tart otherwise.
I used a bit more cinnamon. 
Double topping mixture. You’ll need it to cover.

Breyer’s vanilla ice cream on top! Otherwise, what’s the point?

Yes. Substituted white sugar for brown sugar. Also, precooked apples for 5 minutes on microwave to avoid a watery bottom pie.

I bake quite a bit, but never an apple pie. Went apple picking so figured I'd give it a try. This recipe worked perfectly. I omitted the raisins and walnuts, but added a couple tablespoons of crushed pecan pieces to the crumble for extra crunch. Winner!

Doubled topping, left out lemon juice And used a mix of apples - almost made it a little too sweet! Next time I might try sticking with a more tart apple or just using 1.5 times the topping....otherwise very tasty and will definitely make again!

This came out great! I used 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of 3/4 cup and almost 1 tsp of cinnamon because I did not have nutmeg. It was still sweet and I think I may reduce the white sugar to 1/3 cup the next time I make it.

The only change was that I reduced the white sugar to half  a cup. I used Granny Smith apples and I did not add nuts or raisins. It was delicious served warm with French Vanilla ice cream.

Easy to make & a perfect balance of flavors. Notes for a beginning baker: keep the peeled apples in a a bowl of water with a sprinkle of lemon juice until ready to slice. And make sure the butter is soft.

Fun and easy.... and oh boy! Delicious! Just ate my slice and I'm very satisfied. The crumble topping was quick and easy which was what I was looking for. 
I've never made apple pie before... this was my first time and it was super duper easy and yummy. Go for it

great recipe as is .. as far as timing.... it took me over 2 hours to get this pie done....for the first hour, I put a cookie sheet on the rack below to catch the drippings. that was probably my  mistake. advice to others...don't put a cookie sheet under the pie...

My husband gave this recipe a 10 out of 10. Together we made two changes to this recipe. I changed the white sugar to coconut sugar. My husband requested a graham cracker crust. I will be making this pie a lot.

Delicious but too sweet for my taste. Reduce sugar in both apple and crumb topping and it should do the trick. I followed recipe with one small addition... 1/4t. Corn starch to the flour sugar cinnamon nutmeg mixture the apples are tossed in. Was afraid of too much liquid based on previous reviews. It made for a lovely caramel-like coating around well cooked apples. Used mandolin for uniformly sliced apples, thin worked great as we like a well cooked apple in our pies. Will make again, just less sugar. Thanks for super easy recipe!

The hardest part was getting the apples ready. I used a potato peeler and sliced the apples after. Smells delicious and can’t wait to try it for thanksgiving. I didn’t add the extras just followed the recipe. Going to add a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with the pie.

I made it exactly as written other than the time it took to bake. Had to add about 15 minutes. It smells delicious!

This pie is so good! It is not too bland and a perfect sweet ness. It is also great with whipped cream. The crumb topping after it is cooked, is crunchy and delicious.

This has been in my allrecipes saved log for years. I have made this pie for the past 7 Thanksgivings and am reminded a few weeks prior to the big day that this needs to be on the table, and by several family members. I use Pink Lady apples, the tart blends well with the super sweet topping. I too double the crumb topping, because it makes the pie better than great & serve it with vanilla bean ice cream. I omit the raisins/walnuts per request after the first year of baking it. Its simple, its easy, its inexpensive and am so glad and grateful I have this recipe!!

My family are not really dessert people , but they inhaled this pie. I doubled the cinnamon and didn't add raisins or walnuts. This is now the only apple pie recipe I will use from now on.

Followed the recipe, except I had Apple Pie Spice in my spice cupard, so used that in place of the other spices and it was delicious.  Also covered the pie with Aluminum Foil for First 15 minutes, then removed foil and continued baking the remainder of the time suggested.  It came out a beautiful golden brown.  My guest said it was the best Apple Crumb Pie they had ever had. I also served with a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. YUM!

This is the first pie I have ever baked.  I must say, I have never been a big pie fan.  This was off the hook incredible!!!  And pretty dang easy to make.  I did not put in nuts or raisins.  I did not have nutmeg either.  I used Granny Smith apples.  it's a messy oh so good pie!!!  Thank you!

AMAAAZING RECIPE!! So many people have told me it's the best pie they've ever had. To add more crisp, I put a layer of crushed walnuts between the apples and topping. I also mix walnuts in with the topping. Serve warm with french vanilla ice cream... nothing better. :)

Since I never made an apple pie before I made a test pie before having the family over for Thanksgiving.  Followed the directions and found out that if let the mixture sit before putting into the pie crust the pie can be very runny (and that is why I did a test pie first, it was then taken to work where they eat everything).

The second one came our perfect and everyone loved it; and I found that it isn't difficult to make.  Will be making this again.

I did a bit of research on what kind of apples work the best and used 5 Granny Smith and 2 Honeycrisp.

I've made this pie multiple times and it's always turned out great. I've gotten great compliments every time I've made it and it's usually the first pie gone! The only thing I do differently is I use Honeycrisp apples instead of the Fuji. The combination of Granny Smith and Honeycrisp makes the pie tart and bright! I also feel the Honeycrisp apples hold up better to baking and retain a bit of their crunch. Overall a great pie though!

Used crust recipe I love and always use but this filling and topping were perfect. I used about 7 apples recently picked. Just juicy enough. Doubled the topping but it was too much so I didn’t use about 1/4 of it.

Excellent! I made the pie in the am and was gone by bedtime. It was a big hit at my house! I didn't add the raisins or walnuts.

I found the topping way to sweet.  Even though I let the pie cool completely and used an extra tablespoon of flour, the filling was still very watery.  I won't use this recipe again.

I made the pie as directed, with the raisins and walnuts added and really like this recipe.  My husband loved it.  I used half granny smith and half golden delicious apples.  The pie did come out a little more wet than I would have preferred; this could be from two things - 1. The pie needed to bake longer and boil out the filling more, or 2. the filling needed an extra Tbsp of flour.  Easy enough to adjust for next time.

This was ok, but gave a 2 because it was so sweet. I baked according to directions & the apples were still a little hard, & the crust on the bottom a little soggy. According to directions for the crust I used I even put some flour on both sides of the crust to help it not be soggy. (normally works). Thought about keeping & trying again with less sugar both in the pie & for the topping, but decided to stick with my regular apple pie recipe instead.

This is the first time making apple pie. Turns out very good. I did something first with the apple. I combined all the ingredients and I let the apple blanch so that it will be half way cook.. The crumb on top of the pie is very good too.

This pie was very tasty and easy to make.  It was enjoyed by all. I would have looked the topping to be a bit more crumbly like a Dutch Apple pie and next time I probably will  double the topping

This was superb!  A buttery, sweet, cinnamon delight.  I made this pie with store bought pie crust, skipped the raisins and nuts, and kept to all the measurements and cooked 50 mins.  Eaten warm, it only ran a bit.

My 12 year old grand daughter made this and followed the recipe.  I don't think she mixed the topping as well as she could have, but it turned out great anyhow.  Will make this again.  The flavor was really nice!!

I followed the directions exactly like it was shown and the first two times I made it, it came out great.  The last time though, it came out having a lot of liquid. I don’t know what happened. It tasted great like the other ones. I will try again though. Great recipe.

This is so easy to make and I think this was the only thing I wanted for Thanksgiving! Only thing I did different was add more topping for more crunch...not for everyone.

I made it exactly as written out. I think what the author fails to mention is what type of apples to use. I used Granny Smith apples because they are tart and I noticed that some people complained about the sugar. If you use sweet apples, it might be too sweet but with these apples, it was perfect.
I just remembered that I did do something different which was to toast the walnuts before putting them in. I just like the taste better that way.

I used Braeburn apples, which keep their shape in a pie, and don't turn to applesauce while they bake.  But they are a sweet-ish type of apple, and now I know to cut down on the sugar when using apples that aren't tart.  The brown sugar crumble topping is wonderful.  I used the  Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this website.  25 minutes under foil, and then 25 more minutes without the foil, is not long enough.  The pie was a little soupy yet when it came out of the oven.

I absolutely love this recipe. I used the lattice crust instead of the crumb only bc my better melted and I think I over mixed my crumb topping. It Created this type of dough or batter creation. I wasn't pleased with the results so again I did the lattice crust. It was easier. All in all a great recipe.

Very good and simple recipe - first time I've ever made an apple pie, and it turned out good! I added a smiden of cardamon, left out the walnuts (allergic) and forgot the raisins, but it still tasted fine. I chose this one because I'm not a pie maker and find the very idea of making pie crust intimidating; I bought a deep dish frozen pie crust and then sprinkled these crumbs on it and it was delicious! I think next time tho, I will peel the apples..lol - it didn't cause too much of a problem because they were thinly sliced, but, well, I can understand why they are peeled,

the first time I made it was on Thanksgiving I didn't say anything from the recipe. I use the amount of sugar suggested and found the pie too sweet. the second time I made it I did change the amount of sugar. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and it came out excellent

I followed this recipe but added one ingredient that put it over the top.  I thinly sliced a tube of almond paste and lined the bottom and sides of the crust with paste before adding the apple filling. WOW

Absolutely delicious! The recipes here are simple but great. I'm going to make a couple of these for Christmas. The crust burned on my first one, but I learned how to make a foil ring and the second one came out perfect!

Very good pie. I've made this several times, with whatever apples I received in my CSA share.  Every time it turned out delicious, but the softer, juicier apples were appealing to me - such as MacIntosh.  I have a pie in my oven right now, which I prepares with Pink Lady Apples.   I'm sure it'll be wonderful.

This apple pie was to die for. Simple to make and delicious. The crumb top made the pie. I made exactly as written and did not have a problem with excess water like other reviewers had. Highly recommend!

This will be my fourth  time making this pie, I increased the flour amount so the pie is not so runny and the crumble top(yummy), and I use granny smith apples, its the best and easiest pie I ever made. Thanks for sharing!!

Will make again as my husband loved it (and so did I)! Did not put in any of the optional ingredients, used a thawed store bought pie crust, and Granny Smith apples. Served warm with vanilla ice cream.

I didn't have a pre-made crust, and was too tired to make one. I made this like an apple crisp (no crust) for my 13 year old who was just craving apple pie. It was AMAZING! I did double the flour based on other reviews and also the topping.

This pie tastes  delicious! I used the lemon juice and walnuts as suggested and the nuts added great texture.  After reading some of the reviews,  I also decided to reduce the sugar and increase the amount of flour in the filling.  It was plenty sweet, even with the reduced sugar but still runny despite the extra flour. It made the bottom crust soggy. I still have a lot of apples left so I will try to make this recipe again and will double the amount of flour for the filling.

I made this twice and the filling part gave me no problem! It tasted amazing and would recommend this recipe to anyone! I used a pie crust for the bottom and added a little extra cinnamon for my taste. My problem is I can't get the 'crumble' to do right at all! The first time was my mistake because all I had on hand was Country crock spread and not butter. The second time was A LITTLE better, and I mean that lightly, because I used stick butter straight from the fridge but the crumb topping still came out soggy? HELP!!! Suggestions please?!

The pie is excellent, but the topping makes too hard a shell.  It makes it difficult to cut the pie.  I will make it again, but use oatmeal in the topping mix.

this recipe is deee-licious! I felt like a fancy baker after making this, its as good as any I've ever had in a restaurant! It is super easy to do too. My husband loved it. I've made it twice, the first time was a bit watery, but the second time was perfect--I think I just needed to cook it a bit longer! I'm not that great at baking, but this is fool-proof (and yummy, even when it was watery) :)

Just made this recipe yesterday (and followed the recipe to the letter), but circumstances didn't let us eat it until tonight. It was so watery that it spilled over the edges when picked up, and in a day turned all the crust to mush. I used Granny Smith apples. Don't think we'll be trying this one again.

My husband told me this apple pie was better than his Mom's!! I like to make some extra crumb topping - usually 1 1/2 times the recipe. I also use more cinnamon in the apple filling mixture. Fabulous recipe!

I placed a rolled-up pie crust in a small baking dish and used 3 thinly sliced medium apples. I would say I had four cups of apple slices. I went ahead and used the amounts of other ingredients as indicated in the recipe. The outcome is delicious! I am a crust/topping fan, so I usually prefer fewer apples in a pie. You can adjust to your liking, or to the number of apples you have on hand. Mine were pink lady and granny smith. Baking temp and time was about right. This would also work as a crisp, minus the crust!

This recipe was amazing. I made 2 pies. One as per the recipe and 1 as per recipe but added walnuts to the crumb and filling. I also added blueberries and raisins to the filling.  Both came out fantastic.

I went apple picking today and browsed the web for recipes... soooooo glad I found this one!!  My husband hates apple pie and I begged him to try it and he couldn't believe how great it was.  I did double the crumble topping amount and added the walnuts. This will be one of my desserts for Thanksgiving.

Delicious! I had some left over dough from the crust I made, so I put a latticework patten on the top! It called for more baking time to brown the extra dough on top, but I think it helped to soften the apples more too. Sweet apple pie, just the way I like it!

My family loved this pie. Only changes I made was using 3 tablespoons of flour on the apples because mine had been frozen and were really juicy. I added pecans instead of walnuts and doubled the topping. The pie was delicious.

changed it a little. Added Walnuts & Raisins Apple mixture. Then added about a Tsp. Butter Dices on top of Apple Mixture and then sprinkled it with ground cloves  (not much).  The extra butter helped for I made extra topping by increasing the sugars/flour to 3/4 Cup and 1/2 Tsp of Butter.  I didn't use all of this, but it made for a thicker topping.... Great base recipe!

Didn't add raisins or walnuts but did everything in recipe exact and turned out amazing. Will be making in the future. Didn't need to double the topping. And I used granny smith apples. Mine wasn't runny at all and we ate it warm.

I've made this pie several times and it's a big hit! The crunchy/sweet topping is much better than another crust, in my opinion. It wins over everyone who eats it. I use organic Fuji apples to make it a sweeter pie than using golden delicious or other tarter apples.

This is the best apple pie I have ever made. The only think I do is leave out the nuts add a little extra cinnamon and make 1 1/2 the recipe for the topping. Yummy. ??

Followed recipe as written with the exception of adding the walnuts to the crumb topping rather than the apple mixture (did not use raisins.).   Will definitely make again.  My 82 year old father told me, "This is good pie."  Enough said :-)

Excellent-we replaced the walnuts with pecans. We also carried through with an extra tbsp of all of the powders. Our thick pan let us use 2 extra cups of apples.

This is a great recipe. Of course I altered a few things here and there, I always do. Added brown sugar to the apples and made more crumb topping too. It came scrumptious~

I tried this and added the chopped walnuts, and used three heaping tablespoons of flour in with the apples.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half as I thought it was overly sweet.  I think the crumble would be better with 1/2 the sugar and add chopped pecans or almonds.

I am not a fan of any kind if pie but I made this for my husband. He couldnt waitfor it to cool because the smell was driving him crazy! so we dug into it after 30 mins and it was simply delicious, perfect really. You cannot mess this recipe up. This was my first attempt at baking a pie so I can say this was easy as pie ;)
I kept to the instructions completly did not increase the topping or anything else.  I used 3 granny smiths and 2 macs, and liquid thickened nicely onced it cooled. This is on the sweeter side of desserts so I might reduce the the white sugar by a couple of tablespoons next time.

This turned out wonderful. I didn't change it much, other than increasing the amount of flour from 2 Tbsp to 3 Tbsp and adding a half a Tbsp of cornstarch to ensure proper thickness as based on other reviews. I also sprinkled a bit of extra cinnamon into the crumb topping and was glad I did. Would make again. Thanks Jackie!

I don't like apple pie. Fortunately, this isn't pie, it's heaven!
I had never made a fruit pie before, but the gf's parents wanted an apple pie for Thanksgiving, so I gave it a shot. Left out the raisins and traded the store bought crust for a nice buttery home made crust. 1/2 and 1/2 Braeburn and Yellow Delicious Apples gave a nice combo of flavor, texture, and color(left the skin on.) Held good and firm but still melts in the mouth. Making again tomorrow for Christmas, but this time for my parents. mmmmmmmmm can't wait!

Definatly needs a little extra flour all apple pies do especially for granny smith apples...do not use lemon on granny smith a little to tangy...and do double the topping if you like things sweet....great pie WHEN COOLED COMPLETELY...follow the directions and your pie will be AMAZING;)

Awesome Pie !!
Only enhancement I made using another reviewer's idea was that I simmered the raisins on low-med heat in some Godiva Liqueur while preparing the apple filling.  It makes the raisins nice and plump while adding a subtle background flavor as well.

This was my very first apple pie I've ever made and it made me a hit! I enjoyed this recipe so much I baked 4 apple pies. I went apple picking with my son so I had a ton of Jonathan Apples. Besides adding a bit more flour to thicken the inside it was perfect. I didn't have the problem of not having enough tipping as others suggested at all.  It even fit my 7x11 casserole dish.

Needed a easy, no fuss dessert to use up all the local apples we had picked. This came out very tasty. With some good quality vanilla ice cream its even better.

This pie is easy and simple to make.  It was incredible!  I didn't use the nutmeg because I didn't have any, but it still turned out incredible without it.

The best apple pie I've ever eaten. Apple pie is not my favorite, but this was outstanding.  I followed the direction exactly, except I made extra crumb topping and did opt to add the raisins and the walnuts.  I think the raisins made the pie super sweet, but with some cold vanilla ice cream it balanced it out. Wonderful recipe!!!

YUM!! I didn't have lemon juice on hand and not a big fan or raisins, so I left those two ingredients out. This pie was delicious! The topping was perfect, no need to double, this makes plenty. The consistency was nice, cut and held together well. I plan on using this recipe at the upcoming holidays.

This recipe is so delicious, and definitely one of the best apple pie's I tried.  I did double the crumb topping as others have done.  I found it just wasn't enough for me, I like my pie to be totally covered with crumbs.  the only issue I did have (and maybe I should give it 4 stars for this) is it was a little to watery.  I made the pie on an evening, and didn't cut into it until the next day afternoon, and still found it to be runny.  So it did have plenty of time to cool off.  But with that being said the taste was still out of this world.  I think next time, I will try to use a little more flour in the pie mix to solve the problem.

It was very good. I used granny smith apples to reduce the sweetness and decreased the sugar a little bit. I found 6 cups of apples were way too much for a 9 inch pie.

I followed the recipe exactly as directed, and liked how the filling turned out (not runny, flavorful), but I didn't like the crumb topping. I think it made the pie excessively sweet, and that is the first time I've ever said that about any apple pie. I'd only make this recipe again as a standard two-crust lattice pie.

This was an awesome and easy pie.  I did make my own crust using the crust portion of the recipe from the "Homemade Fresh Pumpkin Pie" recipe also awesome and also on this site.  My bad for not having walnuts and substituting almonds, I will not do that again, matter of fact I'd probably leave the nuts out completely, but I would definitely make this pie again.

My boyfriend absolutely raved over this pie. We used granny smith apples and gluten-free flour and pie crust. The taste and consistency were perfect. I left it in about 5 minutes longer than specified in the recipe.

This turned out well, but the crumbs ended up pretty flat and powdery. I think next time I'll melt the butter rather than just cutting it in. Otherwise, it was very good.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out great. I used a butter based pie crust made with gluten free flours. For the filing I only used 1/2 cup of sugar, and increased the nutmeg and cinnamon amount, and added a tiny amount a ground ginger. I did the same for the toppping because I really like those flavors to be strong. Dark brown sugar worked great on top and I left it in my grandmother's oven to keep it warm after I baked it. I would highly suggest serving it warm like that with some vanilla ice cream. It was really yummy and has the classic apple pie flavor that I love.

Oooh, seriously good pie! My trick for really good apple pie (whichever recipe I use) is to mix up the apples in the filling. I use at least two, usually three, different types of apples in the pie. (Granny smith, macintosh, rome, gala, etc.) Don't be afraid to experiment with your apple selection. I have had great success with almost all apples that have even a hint of tart to them. I kept pretty close to the actual recipe with three exceptions... I never use lemon juice on my apples (I just don't like the underlying taste of it in my pies), I did make a bit more topping, and I always use corn starch, not flour to thicken my pies.

Amazing apple crumb pie. I added the walnuts to the crust and let it sit for a half hour before cutting it. Not runny at all and the walnuts in the crust were fantastic! No raisins. Great recipe!

Delicious! I didn't add any optional stuff, and I didn't have nutmeg, so I doubled the cinnamon. Amazing, everyone loved it and the house smelled great. I also doubled the amount of crumb topping, as per previous comments, but I had tons left over, so I'm not entirely sure if it was necessary.

I was comparing this recipe and another as I made my pie, so my review here is mostly for the filling. It's very good, but too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (which is what the other recipe used). I did like that the topping used brown sugar; I used the 1/2 cup packed brown sugar with 3/4 cup flour and 5 tablespoons butter, plus a few sprinkles of nutmeg, allspice, and ground cloves as another reviewer recommended. I had slightly more topping than I needed, and it was delicious!

I again had problems with the pie becoming very watery.  I used red delicious apples and even added an extra tbsp of flour, HOWEVER, it was still absolutely delish!  I will def try again and try to figure out how to make it less runny.

Wow! This pie smelled delicious from the start. The combination of spices, nuts, and raisins perfectly complimented the juicy apples. I had picked these apples at my parent's home. Home-made is the best! Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.

First pie I ever made and it was delicious! Couldn't be happier. Although my fiance used more like a tbs of cinnamon.

This is simply the best apple pie I've ever eaten.  My family loved it.  I doubled the recipe and made two pies.  There was plenty of crumb topping for both, as well as a for the apple betty I made with the left over apples and topping (I used a few more apple than I needed).

This pie was FANTASTIC! I chose this recipe last minute as I was responsible for the dessert at a small BBQ I attended today. This flavor is the perfect way to break into the fall season. The host just texted me that he finished the whole thing! Will be keeping this recipe for the upcoming holidays.

This pie was SOOOOO good and really, really easy to  make.  LOVE the crumb top.  The first time I made it for people...they thought I had bought it from somewhere it was so good.  HAHA.  I made it as-is and wouldn't recommend changing a thing!

Absolutely wonderful! This was my first apple pie I ever made and it was easy and delicious! However, the directions don't say to peel the apples and for someone who never baked an apple pie had no clue. All I have to say is I'm thankful this was a test run for my thanksgiving pie!  I did make some changes.  Like other people, I added 2 extra tablespoons of flour, and 1/4 teaspoon extra of ground cinnamon.  I made the "butter flaky crust" which was absolutely perfect for this pie!  I can't wait to make this pie again tomorrow.

I was extremely disappointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out watery, bland and the apples were still way too crunchy after the 50 minutes. The topping added nothing to the texture or the flavor. I will not be making this again.

I followed the recipe to the letter. I think it all boils down the the type of apple you use. I had some crispin green apples. I wasn't too impressed with the flavor. I think I would do a golden delicious. Oh and the crumb topping was WAY too mushy.

OMG! What a great recipe! Made two pies one with raisins and nuts (I used pecans) and one without, both are equally good. I followed the recipe pretty closely because this was the first time I was making it, but next time I will decrease the sugar by about 1/2. I did increase the amount of apples a little  because I have lots of apples to use right now. In doing so, I had to increase the cooking time (no surprise). FYI - The pies were so good - sad to say, no leftovers!

I used only walnuts and instead of flour for the crumb I used the cookies speculous, the one that they sell in Holland, I make crush them and then I mixed them with the butter and sugar. Te taste all together was really good, but there was a lot of liquid pouring down consisting in apple juice and caramel, next time I would use more flour and less sugar, because i didn't like all that liquid. Ohh more cinnamon and nutmeg it is called for, my boyfriend thougth that they were too sweet

Yum! I ended up not doubling the topping, but did have to add 1T more butter to work into the rest, but then had to add more flour to balance it out. So the proportions were a bit off for the crumbly topping... I also only used 1/2 cup sugar and it was plenty (though I was using non-tart apples). I used 4T flour in with the apples. I also used more like 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and I also sprinkled cinnamon in the crumb topping.

This was really good and easy to make. I didn't use the raisins but we added walnuts.  There was the perfect amount of topping, I would not change it at all.  Next time I plan to use 1 cup of walnuts instead because we didn't feel there were enough in each bite (we love nuts in our desserts!).

This pie tasted great!  Mine turned out runny, even after cooling, so I would say the flour needs to be increased to help combat that.

This is a well written and very easy to follow recipe. It was the first pie I ever made and remains the best I've ever eaten. Although I've tried variations, the original recipe remains the best (perhaps with a touch of cloves added.)

Simple to make. Tastes delicious. My husband says he likes it better than his favorite store-bought pie!  I made it without the optional raisins and walnuts. Also, I did not have nutmeg, so I used allspice instead.

My boyfriend made me make this again and again!  I increased the amount of topping a little, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (I'm sure the type of apples used would make a difference -- I used McIntosh), left out the walnuts and raisins, and added a bit of pumpkin pie spice.  I love it because it doesn't have too much crust, too -- not a fan of pie crusts.  Easy and delicious!

I needed a way to use up some apples that weren't suitable to eat by themselves anymore, and this worked perfectly.  I didn't use the raisins or walnuts because of picky eaters, and I used 1/2 cup of white and 1/4 cup of brown.  I also doubled the topping mixture.  This was pretty tasty and devoured quickly.  It set up well, and the crumb topping was delicious.  My only complaint was that it was almost too sweet, however this could be more at the fault of the gala apples that I had to use up, as they were not the usual tart apple used in most pies.

This pie looked great out of the oven. Alas, it was way too sweet. I used raisins, which I liked, but no-one else did. Next time, I'll either use sweeter apples and no suger, or cut down on the suger if I make this again.

I took this pie to my mother in laws for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Even after eating a turkey dinner, my husband loved it so much, he ended up having 3 pieces over the course of the day!  Will make this again!

Very good. My first home-made apple pie. I made a the "Basic Flaky Crust" using all butter. Although my pie was a little watery, I'm not sure if it's because I didn't store in the fridge but it was still really good.

Super superb!! My mom especially loved it because it was not buttery-  she has quite a oil/fat/butter phobia. haha.(Shhh...) We baked it for afternoon snacks, and it did not live to see the next day. By the way, we are only a family of 3! ohh.. just like other reviews suggested, I increased the amount of flour used to 4 tablespoons. Hope this helps! :)

This is a great recipe!  I use Ms. Smith's frozen pie crust which turns out great.  Used about 5 large Granny Smith apples but used 1 cut of sugar to help out with the tartness.  The pie yes is runny but adding 1-1/2 more tablespoons of flour to the apples definitely helps out with that (it doesn't matter how it looks, just how it tastes!!)

Well this pie did not turn out how I thought it would. It was very tart and the crumb part was not crumbly it actually turned out very moist so I was lost once it did that but it was not my husbands favorite so I will not be making this recipe again.

The pie is VERY liquidy as written, but otherwise the taste is fantastic. I really enjoyed the brown sugar crumbs on top. Typically in my apple pies I use the white sugar crumbs, but not any more!Thanks so much!

Love Love Love!  Decided not to use walnuts and raisins (more kid friendly) but this apple pie was hands down the best I have ever made.  I am not even a big apple pie person but was amazed at how good this was.  Also, I took the suggestions from others and added a bit more flour to thicken the filling.    This was so good that I made five extra pies for my husband to bring to his deploying soldiers!

Taste's awesome! Only downer is that it is watery and doesn't hold. Getting a traditional slice is not happening.  Certainly advise using more flour for the filling.  I used 1/4 cup.  May depend on apples but wonderfully sweet and just a little tart at the end, yum! Also, I didn't use the full 3/4 cup of sugar.  1/2 a cup is good.

AMAZING apple pie! So easy to make and so yummy. The brown sugar crumb topping makes this one of the best apple pies I've ever had! I try to use fresh out of the orchard apples whenever possible(Cortlands are great-not too tart and they stay nice and firm).

Tasty!  I used the raisins, but didn't have walnuts so chopped up pecans and cashews instead for the added crunch.  Pie was completely vegan with use of Earth Balance vegan spread and a Whole Foods pie crust.  So yummy!

This pie tasted fabulous.  It was delicious.  However, as the pie cooled, it progressively became more wet.  By the time I served it, it was impossible to take out of the pan in decent shape.  Luckily the taste compensated for the visual presentation.

Yum!  I had some apples I needed to use up.  Since they were a sweeter variety (I usually use Granny Smith for pies), I cut way back on the white sugar that is mixed in with the apples.  I was worried about it being too runny, so I made sure to let it cool completely.  It was just right.  My husband ate over half of the pie himself!

This was the first pie I've ever made and it turned out DELICIOUS! I used granny smith apples and followed the recipe exactly. I cooked it just a few minutes longer to get the top golden brown. This was the best home-made apple pie I've ever had.

Oh my gosh!!  What a wonderful pie.  This was the first apple pie I've ever made and boy was it a hit!  I used a homemade pie crust, you can find it here under easy pie crust. I highly recommend it.  It makes enough for the crumble on top which I added brown and white sugars, cinnamon and pecans.  Everyone raved about the pie and I will make over and over again!

Oh man...this is amazing!  This was my first fruit pie that I've ever made.  I like to bake and I've made a lot of other pies but I was still a little nervous.  I didn't put in raisins, or the walnuts because I dont like raisins and I didn't have any walnuts.  I doubled the topping and it was perfect.  I almost like this pie more than my Grandma's pie that I've had for years.  I will definitely make this over and over again.

I followed the recipe and I got a really tasty apple crumb pie. I served it to friends and family and they all loved it. Follow the recommendation to wait until completely cooled to cut the pie to allow juices to congeal.

It was my first apple pie I have to say it was easy and excellent.  I doubled the crumb recipe and I think it was perfect! It got rave reviews, I had used an apple slicer then cut them again lengthwise.  I used granny smith with a couple of gala thought it was a great mix. Can't wait to make it again

This pie tasted wonderful! I have to say though, that while it came out of the oven looking just beautiful, I left it on the counter and didn't serve it until 8 hours later and the topping was already getting soggy by then. When I cut into it, it was really quite runny. Next time, I will double the flour as others suggested. I did make twice the topping as others had suggested, but for me that was too much - 50% more would have been about right.

I must say this is a winner!  I first used this recipe last year for Thanksgiving.  When it came to planning for this year's holiday, I immediately looked for the recipe.  I increased the amount of flour in the filling to prevent runniness and also increased the ingredients for the crumb topping!  Perfection!  Thank you for the recipe!

Great, I used currants instead of raisins, added mored cinnamon on top of animals before the crumb topping.  Agreed, this receipe yields the correct amount of topping, I wouldn't have doubled it.

This was really good!  I found it a bit sweet but my family said NO WAY!  All ingredients are on hand at home so it makes it easy to just "whip up".   I added pumpkin pie spice because I had it on hand.  Will make again for thanksgiving dessert!!!

I had a bag full of fresh apples from our apple tree. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I took the advice from other's and doubled the topping. I also made the mistake of not tasting the apples before adding the sugar, because boy! was it sweet! I also forgot to up the amount of flour, so it was a bit watery. All in all, came out really good, even despite my errors. But it was very sweet. Next time I will add more flour to the apple mixture and use less sugar. It's a keeper tho!

A good apple pie..but nothing spectacular either.
It's too much work for an ordinary result for me. (all that peeling and coring and slicing). And if your apple is a bit sour i think it's a good idea to add little sugar to the apple mix.
The brown sugar mix isn't enough to cover the entire pie, so make sure you make more.

I made this pie as a compromise since my husband wanted an apple pie and I wanted an apple cobbler.  It's the best of both worlds.  I omitted the raisins and nuts and doubled the cinnamon to suit our tastes.  I used three large Granny Smith apples and added an extra tablespoon of flour and the pie was still too runny.  I'll probably increase the flour to 1/4c. next time.  I ended up baking the pie uncovered for 45 minutes and thought it came out perfect.  I didn't find the pie too sweet, but I did use very tart apples.  I would definitely reduce the white sugar and/or up the lemon juice if I were using sweeter apples.  I didn't see any need to double the topping recipe.

It was awesome and easy as pie! Used a combo (half and half) all purpose flour and wheat flour. The walnuts were the best part!(didn't add raisins-personal preference).

We loved this. It's a little unclear whether the recipe intended you to use a cooked pie shell or uncooked crust, but I used the latter (a rolled, refrigerated crust) and it baked up pretty well, but was a little soft at the bottom. Overall, great taste and texture and perfect for someone that doesn't like too much crust.

Made this pie for Thanksgiving. I can't tell you what it tasted like. It disappeared just as fast as I put it out. I was told it was "out of this world" and several people requested the recipe. Next year I'll be making 2

The ingredients were simple. I used the optional walnuts and used dates instead of raisins. The six cups of apples made a huge mound inside the pie shell but luckily it didn't burst or leak. Turned out wonderful! Maybe a little too sweet, but everyone else thought it was perfect. It baked much longer than suggested.

A bit sweet but next time I will use granny smith apples which will probably fix that.  Overall a great, easy pie that the whole family can enjoy.

Definately will use this one again.  I think it had a good amount of topping, but it didn't bake hard on top... more mushy but it could have been that I didn't bake it long enough...

Definitely not a 5 star apple pie recipe, but it was okay.  It was definitely too runny as written so follow other's advice and double the flour.

I attempted to make my first apple pie and I decided on this recipe, and I'm really glad I did! My entire family loved this. I was completely impressed with how easy it was to make and how delicious it turned out. I decided to cut down on the sugar in this recipe because I found that the apples I was using were alittle too sweet and added more cinnamon to suit my taste and it worked out really well. As many people have suggested DO double the flour on the crumb topping to have a consistent thickness. I will definitely make it again! It tastes amazing with blue bell's home made vanilla ice cream!

This pie is amazing! Very easy to make, and the ingredients were all on sale too, making it very inexpensive. I planned to make it and take it took work, but I'll be making another for thanskgiving! The topping is delicious, and goes perfectly with the apples that carmelize so wonderfully underneath.

This was really good!  I ended up using a pre-made pie crust, and it only took a few minutes to get the ingredients together and everything into the oven!  My family was thrilled when they had home-baked apple pie on a Wednesday night!

I almost never make pies, but was looking for one to possibly use this holiday season....and this one sounded great. I made it last Thursday...and it filled TWO pie shells, and is SO delicious!! I used the raisins & walnuts to make it more unique and I just LOVE the crunch of the nuts in it. The spices are perfect and the pie itself LOOKS so pretty!! Thanks for a great recipe for my collection! I plan to use this one for many holidays to come!!

This was a good pie, though not "the one" I've been lookin for.  My family loved it, but I wasn't crazy about the spices.  If I make it again, I'll probably leave out the nutmeg and add some allspice.

When I make a pie, go out for the evening and return to half a pie, well the proof is in the pudding, or the pie in this case. I made this without the walnuts and raisins because I wanted a basic pie. I'll make another soon, as my intended didn't get his fair share. The tasters' reviews ranged from "awesome" to "blazin!" Thanks for making my first apple pie a success, Jackie!

I made two pies last night with apples from my neighbor's tree. I especially liked the addition of raisins and walnuts. Served warm it is awesome!
