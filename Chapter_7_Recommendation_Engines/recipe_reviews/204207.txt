My grandmother made these for me when I was a kid and the recipe was in her head, unfortunately when she passed on it was lost! I am so excited to find this and relive a wonderful part of my past. These are so simple and so wonderfully sinful, words are lacking to describe their heavenly taste. I hope everyone who makes these enjoys them as much as I do. I am looking forward to sharing this recipe with the next generation in my family!
