I will rate this a four because I made changes... but with my changes I would rate it a 5!! The changes I made were 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla and half a bag of chocolate chips. So yummy! I made this in my belgian waffle maker and they turned our wonderful! I served this with Easy Whipped Cream from this site. I made the leftovers and froze them. I think I will try them for dessert with ice cream next!

These were fun for breakfast.  As other reviewers stated, but waffles don't really get crispy, but stay chewy.  We froze the extra and popped in the toaster for breakfast during the week and those got crispy though.  I didn't bother with the sauce, but using fresh fruit, jam and syrup.  If you are looking for something different, give these a try.

AWESOME!! This is a wonderful weekend treat. They were very moist. They texture is more like a pancake, not crispy on the outside. I also noticed I had to use slightly less batter on the iron than I normally would, or they overflowed. Great with strawberries and whipped cream. :)

yum yum! I used 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, 2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and oil instead of melted butter. I freeze them and then pop them into the toaster. Crunchy outside, soft inside with great chocolaty flavor.

Holy shamolies!  These things are GOOOOOOOOD!  I made them with a friend for "Girls' Day Breakfast" and ooh-ooh-ooh.  We topped with the hard sauce then added fresh sliced strawberries and cool-whip on top.  What a treat!  An easy recipe that looks and tastes so divine!  Thanks for sharing.

These were ok.  I didn't think the chocolate flavor was strong enough and I agree with other reviewers that they had a very pancake like texture.

Kids loved, loved, loved these.  I would consider these more of a dessert rather than breakfast, but let the kids pick what they wanted today.  I added in some mini chocolate chips and 2 of my kids had these with peanut butter and called them Reeses waffles.  Probably won't be something I will make them very often, but the recipe is very good.

Awesome taste! So good! Easy to prepare. A nice light chocolate taste and cake-like. This is a keeper! I served mine w/ butter and powdered sugar which tripled the yum factor. I didn't change a thing! Thanks Jenny69 for this perfect recipe!!

We loved these.  I did use 2 t baking powder and 1/2 t baking soda, and 1/4 cup cocoa as suggested.  I also used 4 T canola oil and 1 t vanilla.  They did not stick.  For breakfast I served them with powdered sugar.  I used the leftovers to make ice cream sandwiches - yummy.

I doubled the recipe, using whole wheat pastry flour instead of white, and added choc. chips.  Made them in a belgian waffle maker that makes 4 toaster sized waffles - ended up with a ton of waffles that were tasty, better for you than breakfast cereal, and we take directly out of the freezer, toast in the morning, and eat in the car on the way to school.  So good - getting ready to make a new double batch!

What a nice weekend treat!  These waffles are wonderful when made "as is".  I did not alter the recipe at all, to give it a fair rating and I'm glad I did.  Other reviewers did not like the consistency of these waffles, but this is what my boys loved about them.  They were soft on the inside, and mine did get crispy on the outside with enough time in the waffle iron.  Made the hard sauce to go with, and it was wonderful!  My sons loved the fact that they were "iced"!  The only change that I might make next time, after talking to all three sons: add a bit of cinnamon to make "abuelita/mexican" style chocolate waffles, AND add a bit more cocoa to make it more chocolaty.  These had subtle chocolate flavor, and not sickeningly sweet, which we all liked.  Even hubby ate it, and he's not a "sweet" eater usually.  Will make again, and again, and again.....

My family liked these.  The only change I made was I used sweetened cocoa powder - that was all I had on hand.  Kept everything else the same.  Made them in my begium waffle maker.  The first came out soft so I just increaed the time a bit so the outside was a bit crispy but still soft on the inside.  Served with sliced strawberries with choice of syrup or powered sugar mixed with sweetened cocoa or cool whip.  The kids tried all ways and voted for the cocoa and sugar mix with cool whip. Recipe is a keeper!

Made a few changes. An additional 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup cocoa, reduced sugar to 1/4 cup and added one mashed banana and reduced baking powder to 2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp baking soda. Changed all flour to whole wheat. Served with raspberry syrup and made the icing in the recipe self serve by putting it into a ziploc snack baggy and cutting a tiny hole. Huge hit with the kids!

My little ones were wanting waffles so decided to change things up by trying a chocolate recipe. We hit the jackpot. Followed the waffle recipe to the letter but didn't make the hard sauce. Some sliced strawberries and powdered sugar on top worked well for us. I'm thinking these would be good hot with some ice-cream for a Sunday evening treat.

I used WW pastry flour, raw sugar, coconut milk and coconut oil.  I also added some vanilla.  I know some people grip about giving 5 stars to a recipe you make changes to, but I always make changes.  We topped them with sliced bananas and coconut syrup.

How interesting - I don't think I'd ever even heard of such a thing before. I made them exactly as written, and they turned out pretty well. At breakfast-time, the waffles' flavor reminded me of "Cocoa Puffs" cereal, in a non-crunchy waffle form. I didn't know what the "hard sauce" was going to be - another new phrase to me - but it turned out to be kind of like the frosting or glaze that's usually on top of a batch of cinnamon rolls. Upon reflection, I think the hard sauce is probably a much better companion than maple syrup might have been. This didn't quite "wow" me, but it was very good, and a nice departure from the usual waffles. My yield was almost 6 waffles, by the way. I recommend this recipe, and just might make them again some time.

Really really really good.  I doubled the recipe so we can have left overs for breakfast over the next few days.  Kids already ate some for "lunch" today.  I did not make the frosting and it was still so good.  Thanks for sharing!

Good but not real sweet. I ended up changing a few things due to goodies we had on hand and all I can say is wow that was an awesome dessert! First I used coconut butter instead of melted butter in a silly attempt to make them slightly healthier. Then I used the new dark chocolate cocoa powder and made a syrup with it too by adding about 1T coconut butter, 1T cocoa, 2T Agave and some water to thin. We ate ours with whipped cream coconut shreds, the chocolate syrup, and a few pecan pieces. OMG to die for! My 2.5 year old ate 2 without batting an eye. I would say it was a hit!

Tasty recipe! Our waffles did not turn out like the ones in the picture and we added more milk as the batter was very thick and did not spread throughout the waffle pan. All in all though a good recipe

Very good!  Still relatively light and fluffy despite the addition of chocolate.  One of the kids topped hers with peanut butter--very clever!  I doubled the recipe and am going to freeze the remainder.

The taste was great and the icing made it even better! But for some reason the texture was all wrong. It was way to chewy. I won't be making these again.

These were a big hit with my kids. After cooking I spread them with butter put a dab of the sugar sauce in the middle and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Served with sliced bananas and strawberries. YUM!

My 9 year old daughter asked me to make chocolate waffles so i looked up a recipe on here...this was a very good recipe, we all loved it. Did make th glaze.   Topped with fresh strawberries, powder sugar and a drizzle of chocolate syrup..YUM! I did put in 1/3 cup cocoa powder, and separated the egg whites beat until stiff peaks and folded in the battter at the end...you won't be sorry for doing this step...makes for a light fluffy waffle.  As i was eating this i was thinking how good this would be with ice cream and hot fudge...next time :)

I followed LISSALU's suggestions and these turned out great!  I used peanut butter chips in mine.  I also left out the egg and added a bit more milk (egg allergy) and they still turned out nicely.  I served them with cinnamon honey butter syrup (twice as much honey as butter, zap it in the microwave to melt the butter, however much cinnamon you want to add).

For some of the people who said they couldn't taste the chocolate flavor, try using chocolate milk instead of white milk and also use the Hot Chocolate Sauce that came with the Gingerbread Waffles.  Update:  I made these waffles this morning and used a European Style of Cocoa, chocolate milk, and 1/2 t. cinnamon, to enhance the chocolate flavor.  I don't think I really needed that cinnamon.  The cocoa was strong enough added to the chocolate milk.  They were really cholatety.  But next time I will try it with white milk and no cinnamon to see if that cocoa is strong enough.

Really, really excellent! I have no idea why this recipie isn't rated five star. It's good just the way it is. I did sift the dry ingredients and mixed the wet ingredients before I added them to the dry. They are heavier than your average waffle, but so what! My kids are gobbling them down as I type this! I can see why you begged your mom to make these when you were a kid!

I made this tonight. It was just ok. I followed the recipe exactly, but only made the waffles. I did not make the sauce. Maybe the secret to flavor is in the sauce?. Really, the chocolate taste is lacking. It honestly didn't have much taste at all. However, after topped with cool whip and powdered sugar it tasted pretty good. Also, this is not a flae in the recipe as it most likelya calls for a standard waffle iron, if making belgium waffles it only makes 4-5.  I probably would not make this again.

I judged the waffles by the picture, big mistake. Sure when I made them they looked and smelled fantastic but when you try them....not so appetizing. The waffle tasted strange, it was sweet but in a bad way. So I rated this recipe 2 stars because they tasted like a bad chocolate cake.

Replaced the milk with soy milk.  The result was very heavy until I added an additional 1/4 cup of soy milk to get the consistency right.  The taste was very good.

I made this for breakfast this morning and thought it was amazing! I didn't make the hard sauce (too many calories in that), but instead just buttered them and used Aunt Jemima 100 calorie/serving syrup. My 3 yr old ate them up! As did I and my husband. We will be making these again! :)

I loved these. I like the recipe the way it is, though I skipped the chocolate sauce, and I like the softer texture of the waffles, while my husband likes them slightly crispier and leaves them on the waffle iron a little extra longer. These taste good with chocolate, butterscotch, caramel and strawberry syrups and would also taste good with peanut butter, powdered sugar, jams, fruits and berries.

Followed the recipe exactly & they turned out very well..made 3 7in. round waffles.  I would describe the texture as more pancake like but my kids loved them. I made the hard sauce which is basically an icing & they loved it. I would try them with strawberries & whipped cream next time. 
Very easy recipe & I will be making these again.

SO GOOD! Loved these! I followed the changes that the 2nd most recent reviewer posted and they turned out great. Not super crispy, but not just chewy. A good balance. The chocolate flavour was nice. Topped it off with some whipped cream and chocolate chips. This is definitely my new favourite waffle :) Thank your mom for us, Jenny!

These are great!  Nice chocolate flavor and so easy to make.  The batter recipe as is makes about seven waffles.  We double the sauce.  Have added orange or almond or coconut extracts to waffle batter with yummy results.  Thanks Jenny!

I made Lissalu's changes, but also added an extra 2 cups or a cup and a half of flour to the batter. It improved the consistency of the waffles considerably!

the family LOVED this.  it made about 5 belgian waffles, and i will definitely DOUBLE this recipe next time.  my husband was pouty that he only got 2 waffles!  yes, he's a pig, but he knows a good waffle i guess. i did not make the sauce, just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top.  i also added about 1/4 tsp cinnamon to boost the chocolate flavor, about a tsp or more of vanilla, added 2T applesauce and cut 2T of the melted butter.  yummy!

Good recipe! I agree with the other reviewers that they are not really crispy, but they are still tasty. Some don't like the light chocolate flavor & want more, but we like it this way. 

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the recipe states that it makes 5 waffles. With a large family, we tripled the recipe, hoping to end up with 15 waffles, but instead, got only 10 out of a triple batch. Others might want to know that if they are cooking for a larger group. 

We ate them with vanilla ice cream and did not make the hard sauce. We also used whole wheat flour and were pleased with the results.

These were good, made these for dessert for father's day dinner.  I didn't make the sauce, instead we made homemade vanilla ice cream, put it on top of the waffles and then topped that with chocolate syrup and caramel syrup.  I have to say that after that, they were great.

I make these all the time now. Great chocolate flavour. They are quite pancake like in texture, but my husband prefers pancakes, so everyone wins. Try it with ice cream for a really special Saturday morning breakfast the kids will flip over.

This has become our traditional "snow day -- no school" breakfast of choice!  Easy, delicious.  Leftovers keep well overnight to be reheated in toaster oven.  We just sprinkle powdered sugar (snow!) over the tops -- they are plenty sweet without the hard sauce.

Delicious! I made half the waffle recipe to try it out. I used just a pinch of salt and added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the batter. I made the icing as directed. Yielded 2.5 waffles in my Belgian waffle maker.

This was excellent.  I just made it for some stay-over house-guests, and everyone was very happy.  Let's be honest though, It's chocolate cake shaped like a waffle.  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips, and a piece of a dark chocolate bar chopped up.  I called them "Triple-chocolate waffles".

One complaint, the sauce seemed too thick to do anything with.  I added a splash more milk, making a nice creamy sauce.  I dusted the waffles with confectioner's sugar and then drizzled the sauce over them before serving.

We thought these were great.  I didn't get a chance to make the hard sauce, but I'm sure that would really gild the lily, I think we'll save it for a special treat (well, an even more special treat than chocolate waffles already are to begin with!).  My children really enjoyed these and they helped make a yucky morning more fun.  We didn't even need syrup!  The only change I made was to substitute white whole wheat flour for part of the ap flour so they would be a little healthier (you can't tell by the taste).  Thanks for the great recipe!  ETA:  I had a little batter leftover and used it to make pancakes with mini chocolate chips for dessert, they were great!  My kids asked for more and were really disappointed that we ran out of batter.  :)

I made these for my kids and while they liked them the true test is that they haven't asked for them again.  I did increase the cocoa to 4 Tablespoons.  They cooked up really nice.  Not sure if the kids will ask for them again or not

Perfect!!  I made these with whole wheat graham flour and they were so good that the kids ate them as they came off the waffle iron - plain.  No need for any other topping for these.  There is enough sugar in them to make them sweet enough to be eaten plain.  These are going to be perfect for mornings when we are too rushed sit down to eat.  Just grab one and go.  Thanks for this recipe!

I agree with others -- a little 'soggy' and not as chocolatey as I might have expected.  That being said, the kids ate them all up.  Not sure we'll make them again...

This was great, but i added a few changes to make it even better!  I used sugar substitute and upped it to one cup, only used two teaspoons of baking powder, and added a half a cup of chocolate chips!  I made a bunch and and froze them so i can warm them anytime in the toaster! YUMMY!

I was looking for a change to my waffle recipe.  I am so glad that came to this site and found this recipe.  My kids and I both love this recipe.

I stirred the batter as I as pouring in the butter in.  I had no problems with this recipe.  For a family of five you will need to double it.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I did different was separate the eggs. I whipped the egg whites to a peak and folded them into the batter. I have a feeling this will be a do over many times. Put some fresh fruit on top and enjoy.

Based on others comments and my previous experience with my Belgian waffle iron, I added 2 extra T of cocoa for more chocolatey goodness, used veg oil instead of melted butter, added 1 t of vanilla, 1/4 c extra milk and beat the egg whites separately to add a bit of lift to the waffles. They turned out crisp and moist. My teenagers smeared choc hazelnut spread and peanut butter before sandwiching two together. Topped with the best Canadian maple syrup, it was pure decadence.

I would add more stars but I didn’t follow the ingredients. I read the reviews before I made this and changed the ratio of cocoa powder and baking powder. Turned out great. Not sure about people saying it was chewy. I made sure it was on the waffle maker until it had a nice texture.

Waffles good. Sauce too much vanilla and more like what would put on cinnamon rolls. My daughter ate plain and I put sliced strawberries and a little whip cream. We put rest in freezer. Mine got crispy on the outside. Can see it with scoop of ice cream for dessert!

I made this with my eleven year old son this morning. We loved them! He added sprinkles to the batter and sprinkles to the sauce. My only extra comment is that the sauce was more like frosting and we spread it on like a knife. So good!

The first time I made it, the only change I  made was that I added 1/2 t cinnamon. They were good. The second time I followed someone's advice and used oil and added the cinnamon. We all felt they had a chocolate cake doughnut flavor. My oldest really likes them, so we will keep it like that. Very easy to make. However, next time I may try to incorporate buttermilk, sour cream or yogurt to help moisten them.
UPDATE: I  switched the milk to 1 1/2 c.   buttermilk and about 2/3 c. milk and it did help moisten the waffles, but my kids liked the cake doughnut flavor over the more moist waffle. (This was for a double batch.)
11/12- Okay, just follow the directions- for a Belgium waffle, cook 5- 6 min. MAKE THE SAUCE! You have oreo waffles - kids love them!

I had high hopes for these but they were just disgusting, I followed the recipe exactly. But once all the ingredients were added there were clumps of flour that didn't mix properly, I sat there and mixed forever and still nothing. I decided to try and make one and it tasted horrible. It wasn't thick at all it was as liquidy as milk. Wouldn't give this recipe to my worst enemy.

Delicious as a special Christmas Day breakfast!  I followed the recipe except added about 4 T of chocolate chips.  Everyone raved about them!  We added fresh strawberries and raspberries, whipped cream and more chocolate chips for toppings!  I think I saw some reviewers say it was too sweet or not chocolaty enough, and I disagree (but I did add chips!)  I thought the texture was wonderful and have saved this recipe and will definitely make again!  Would also make for a wonderful dessert.  You can make a several waffles and keep warm in a toaster oven so that you can serve a bunch at once.

So the best and easiest thing about making waffles is to follow the waffle recipe on the packaging of instant pancake mix to a T (down to using a measuring cup to measure out cold water) and using a waffle iron.  Perfect waffles are a snap — so easy and quick.  I followed this recipe in the sense that I just added 2 tsp cocoa powder and 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  Kids love it! Will definitely make again!

Good chocolate recipe. Added chocolate chips for an extra treat. Made recipe as is. My only complaint would be that they don't come out crispy on the outside like most do, but that wouldn't deter me from making again. Doubled the recipe and got about 18 waffles.

Excellent recipe!  Simple and delicious! My boys loved them. I love that I only needed to use one bowl and it wasn't a lot to clean up. The batter was perfect!  This will be my go to waffle recipe!  --I did not make the sauce.

These were so yummy, I will definitely make them again. I did make some changes, like suggested, I put less baking powder and then a teaspoon of baking soda. I also used a 1/2 C of cocoa powder and added some chocolate chips. These turned out really, really yummy.

These were yum!  I added 1/4 C more cocoa powder and subtracted the same amount of flour.  After I made one and tasted it, I added 3/4t vanilla and a little more sugar.  Also used oil instead of butter.  I skipped the 'hard sauce' and instead made simple syrup with sliced strawberries as a sauce.  The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 stars is it wouldn't have been chocolatey enough for me as written, and the vanilla was a great addition.  Hubby said it would be better for dessert than breakfast-but that was HIS opinion.  For a dessert, I'd also add fresh whipped cream!  My waffle iron gave me 8 or so waffles, so I wrapped the extras in parchment and put them in a freezer bag and froze them.

I love these waffles!  I have made them 3 times in the past week and every time they have turned out wonderfully.  I read the reviews before I first made them and took another poster's advice and used 1/4 cup of cocoa instead of the few Tbspoons that the recipe calls for.  I have a family of chocaholics that I knew would appreciate the chocolatier taste.  I ran out of cocoa by makin them so much and decided to swap out the cocoa for cinnamon.  I went by the recipe for them and kept to the 3 Tbs for the cinnamon.  They were wonderful as well.  A great recipe and a family favorite already!

Using a belgium waffle maker, this recipe only produced 4 waffles for me not 10. They are a dense, chewy waffle and not very chocolate flavored. I even separated the eggs and beat the whites before folding them into the batter (as I do with my other waffle recipes) but even that did not lighten up these waffles.

These turned out pretty good.  I added a little more cocoa powder (between 1/2 - 1 tablespoon extra) and sugar (around 1/8 cup) to the batter.  The waffles were extremely dense and heavy and tasted pretty good.  I think they would be better with a little more cocoa and sugar to up the chocolate taste.  I did make the hard sauce to go with it.  I realized as I was making it that it's basically exactly like my white frosting recipe, except when I make frosting, I melt the butter instead of using softened butter.  This makes the sauce very creamy; using softened butter resulted in lumps of butter and powdered sugar that did not break up even after I whisked it well.  We have several leftover waffles and will try them with vanilla ice cream next.  A decent recipe, but not our favorite breakfast.  Hopefully we will like it better as a dessert.

These were delicious!  The only thing I added was chocolate chips to make them extra chocolatey, and that did the trick.  They also froze beautifully...just pop one in the toaster and tastes just as good as when I first made them.  I will be making these again!

I found this recipe when looking for something a little different for breakfast, so glad I found it, my 8 yr old loved them, we didn't use the hard sauce, instead we had Redi whip on hand and it was awesome, these are not as sweet as I thought they would be which made them all the more yummy for breakfast.

This was a pretty darn good recipe. We just wished it was a little crispier. It tasted great with homemade whipped cream and strawberries though Mmm :)

Yummy... Made these for my four girls, they were great!!! Didn't make the hard sauce for the topping though! I used Organic agave nectar on top of the waffles & whipped cream! They are more of a softer waffle more like pancake softness, but they that didn't matter it is a great recipe!

Nice fluffy waffles, good texture, not much chocolate flavor though.  Made these for New Years Day breakfast! Will probably make again, but will add more cocoa and maybe some mini chocolate chips.

This was a hit in my house.  I made one variation, adding 1 additional tablespoon of cocoa powder, and found them plenty chocolately enough.  I didn't make the sauce, choosing instead to use powdered sugar and whipped cream.  My 5 year old liked them quite a bit, and my husband described them as "good" which is pretty high praise.  Mine were not crispy on the outside, but the texture was not unpleasant at all.  I used an inverted belgian waffle maker, and got 4 1/2 waffles.  I also did not have the difficulty with sticking that others described, but I do have a nonstick surface on my waffle maker and I used cooking spray.  While this recipe did not "knock my socks off" it is a good solid recipe that is going to become a regular part of our family menu.

Bravo!  Made recipe exactly as directed the first time using Belgium Waffle maker. They are soft (which I like), but I'm sure they'll crisp up nicely in toaster.  The second time, I tweaked by cutting butter to 2T and adding 1 tsp of coffee extract to enhance the chocolate flavor a tad.  I found the amount of chocolate to be just right ... Recipe makes 7 nice Belgium waffles which we thoroughly enjoyed.  Thank you so much for recipe.

After trying a different recipe that stuck to the waffle iron and made a mess, I was excited to try this one that got so many rave reviews, but I was disappointed in it. It did not stick, but they were so dry and crumbly that they fell apart as I took them off of the waffle iron, and we ended up eating inch square pieces that looked "pre-chewed." They were very dry, and even spreading butter on top did not help. I did not make the sauce, so I can't say anything about that. Overall, I was very disappointed, and I will not be making these again.

These turned out a little tough, and the chocolate flavor was hard to detect.  I love waffles, but I don't think I will be making these again.

We all enjoyed these, I did add more cocoa powder and the chocolate chips, these would make a good desert with a dollop of whip cream. Very good!

I loved this new recipe.  I used some of the changes from other viewers (more cocoa pwdr and a little vanilla).  I do think it would be 5 stars with mini chocolate chips and this would be an awesome dessert option.  My kids loved these for a special breakfast.  Didn't make the hard sauce, it was great with syrup.  Thanks!

I gave this 4 stars because I thought they were ok, but nothing spectacular.  I followed LISSALU changes.  I used half n half in place of the milk because I had some that I needed to use up.  My three year old loved them.  I could barely eat one as they were very heavy.  I think the chocolate chips helped.

My son that never eats ate 2!  No one else really loved them though. They were good and they came out crispy, they were dense waffles.  I didn't like the hard sauce and won't make that again.  I made these exactly as the recipe calls.

These were a huge hit at my house. I dumped half a bag of milk chocolate chips into the batter and I think that helped a lot too. I had planned on making the hard sauce, but changed my mind at the last minute and just served with syrup. Really good, tho.

I thought this recipe was just OK...as another reviewer said, it was lacking chocolate flavor.  I added chocolate chips which helped, but if I hadn't, you wouldn't have tasted much chocolate at all.  I didn't make the hard sauce so I can't comment on that.

These were a hit with my kids and husband. Nice change from regular waffles.  I did not like the hard sauce as it was in the recipe. It was stiff and tasted like pure sugar. I addded more milk and butter to make it runnier and drizzled that over the top. I think I might try strawberries and whip cream next time.  The waffles are not crispy no matter how long you leave them in the waffle maker. THey are a soft chewy consistency, which is ok for a change.

My kids snacked on the cold extras later in the day without anything added to them.

I will be making these again!
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Decreased the baking powder so they wouldn't get so "cakey." Also, didn't make the sauce but think I will next time. Instead I topped with a strawberry syrup and canned whipped cream. Think this would be perfect for a bruch. It has that "wow" factor.

I just made these for breakfast and really enjoyed them. I have to agree with the other reviewer who said the texture is more like a pancake. The hard sauce was a tasty treat, although it tasted just like frosting. Not sure I'll make these for breakfast again, but they would be a good dessert! Thanks for sharing Jenny.
