Great on a chocolate zucchini cake baked in a bundt.  I made the glaze in the microwave using a pyrex glass measuring cup, at 45 seconds for the chocolate chips, butter and corn syrup, stirring until smooth then adding the vanilla.  Tip:  spray the measuring spoon with non-stick spray before measuring the corn syrup and it will slide right out.

DO NOT USE A STOVE!  Microwave 45 seconds, stir, microwave 45 seconds, stir. If needed, microwave in 15 second intervals, stir. EASY, EASY, EASY.  Use it while it is warm!

I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted it with honey. I also didn't have a double boiler so I used a ceramic bowl in a saucepan of boiling water instead, and it still worked great! Easy and simple for amateurs like me!

This recipe is great!  I doubled the ingredients, tossed into a 4 cup glass measuring cup, microwaved for 30 seconds and stirred.  It took about three rounds in the microwave before being smooth.  The glaze hardens to a nice consistency.  Thanks!!!!

Excellent texture and excellent flavor. I had the impression this would be a thin glossy liquid type glaze, but its more along the lines of a frosting. BUT STILL VERY GOOD!
Thanks Ginger.

I am torn on reviewing this recipe. The flavor I would give 4 stars but the texture would be a 2. I am a baker and thought I would try this on my chocolate cake that I sell. I made this 4 times before rating this recipe. Satiny should not be the name of this recipe. It is grainy and hardens more than I would expect. I know that oer cooking choc will cause it to have this effect but that is not the case I would recommend doubling the corn syrup. Great flavor just does not make for a smooth "satiny" glaze.

I DON'T REVIEW RECIPES, BUT THIS ONE DESERVES TO BE RECOGNIZED! I've never made this any other way than this. Simply double the recipe, and put the chips butter & corn syrup in a 2 cup Pyrex measuring cup. Microwave on hi for 1 minute with a paper plate over it. Mix it well with a wire whisk, & microwave again on hi for 30 seconds. I use it on "Too Much Chocolate Cake" which is also on allrecipes. I've also used it to make the best chocolate covered strawberries anyone has ever tasted. (Dip them in the chocolate & put them on a tray lined with parchment paper or Reynolds Release non stick foil, & put them in the fridge to cool)  Those will make you famous!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site.  It is super easy and so versatile - I've used it on cakes (a boxed cake mix made in a bundt pan and this make a great, pretty, quick treat), doughnuts, ice cream, brownies, eclairs, cream puffs, garnish for chocolate dipped strawberries (using white chips instead of semisweets), and even cookies.  This is super!

Don't cook the chocolate chips with the corn syrup and butter.  Just melt the butter and syrup together on low.  Take it off the heat and add the chocolate chips.  Stir them until they melt.  Now you don't have to worry about the scorch that so many have had a problem with

This is a great, easy glaze. You can speed it up by melting the butter, chocolate, and corn syrup over medium heat, just stirring like mad so it doesn't burn. Add the vanilla last so it doesn't evaporate!

I made this yesterday to top the "easy chocolate chip pound cake", also on this web site.  This was a very simple and great tasting fudge-like topping.  I made it in a smal skillet over low heat and stirred like crazy.  My only complaint is that I was expecting something a bit thinner, more glaze-like.  Mine ended up being thicker, like a regular frosting.  I did add more corn syrup and vanilla to thin it enough to drizzle over the bundt cake.  I will make this again, maybe next time trying a mixture of chocolate and peanut butter chips.

Simple and yummy. Tips: When cooking with chocolate, the quality of the chocolate will hugely impact the quality of the finished product. In other words, USE GOOD CHOCOLATE! I used giradelli chips, but you could also use your favorite kind of baking chocolate in squares or chips. But a warning, there is no point using good chocolate if you're then going to use a microwave. Microwaving breaks down chocolate and hurts the chemical composition. If you don't have a double boiler, use low heat on the stove. It will still take only a few minutes to make this and the result will be far better.

I ADDED A PHOTO OF MY DONUT MUFFINS but I made them look like donuts by using a measuring cup and foil forming them into 'cups'. This recipe is delicious. I don't use light corn syrup. Instead, I use honey as a substitute. That was the ONLY thing I changed, and I followed the recipe exactly. I don't have a double boiler, so I just boiled water in a medium pot and placed a wok on top (or any saucepan/pot that doesn't sink down). I waited until it heated and then I pour the ingredients in there and it melted nicely. I did all that because we don't have a microwave. It was easy to do, and I'm very happy with the results. I used this glaze to pour on top of DONUT MUFFINS (recipe on this site). DELICIOUS!

Wonderful! My 20 year old daughter who is trying to learn to cook made this cake. She turns her nose up at everything. When she read sour cream in a cake she spat yuck. The cake turned out great. She was so proud of herself. Decreased the oil  and added milk like others said. Will make many more times. Love this site using it to teach her to cook.

This is FANTASTIC!  I used a sauce pan, and my "sure simmer" (very low) option on my stove top to melt this, it came out perfect!  I will use this often, thanks so much Ginger!!

I made this recipe once and it was amazing.  Definitely 5 star frosting.  My husband loved it so much he requested it on his birthday cake.  I didn't have any semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand so I used milk chocolate instead.  BIG mistake!  It turned out lumpy and very unappetizing looking.  Instead of drizzling beautifully over the edge of the cake it dripped in icky clumps off the sides.  Moral of the story -- only use the semi sweet chips and your glaze will be perfect.  DO NOT use milk chocolate chips for this recipe - it will NOT turn out the same!  Fortunately, it still tasted okay and hubby was satisfied, but I felt really bad about his ugly cake.  Had to make another and use the right chips to make it up to him.  He was okay with that.

Very good, and easy to do.  Poured very well over my chocolate bundt cake.  I have added this recipe to my recipe box. I also liked that it didn't make such a large amount.  Just enough for the average bundt cake.

I made this today to put on some chocolate baked doughnuts. I just melted it all on the stove on (low) or 3 on my burner and it was fine. I never use a double boiler unless I am making large quantities of melted chocolate. It tasted like a thin ganache. At first I thought it might be to thin for a doughnut, but better to drizzle on a pound cake. But, after it sat until the doughnuts were done it thickened enough to dip the tops of them in. And, it worked perfect, thanks!

I doubled the recipe (plus an extra tsp of corn syrup to thin out what was a rather thick glaze) and followed the advice of other reviews and microwaved the ingredients--stirring every 20 seconds.    The double recipe made the perfect amount to drizzle over the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe also on allrecipes--not completely covered, but not a light drizzle either.    Utterly perfect.  Will definitely use again.

I used this recipe to 'frost' a chocolate bundt cake. I did it in the microwave like others suggested, and it made it nice and syrupy. I put it in a zip top baggie, cut a corner off, and used that to drizzle over the cake. It looked so professional! I topped it all off with mini chocolate chips on top. It looks so decadent!I only wish I had white chocolate chips on hand to make a white chocolate drizzle on top of the semi-sweet. Next time for sure! Oh yes, and the taste is wonderful!

Very easy and very good.  I also made mine in the microwave, checking and stirring after 30 seconds, then again at two 10-second intervals.  It was done in less than a minute.  The texture was perfect for topping my chocolate pound cake, perfectly draping the sides.  It made an ordinary cake look kind of elegant!

This is an great chocolate glaze for Bundt cakes. For consistency, I give it 5 stars, but for taste I would give it 4 starts. It's good, but I like it really sweet. The glaze is great because it's not so thin that it all runs off the cake. It's thick enough to form it the way you like. It's also dries semi-hard and keeps a nice gloss.

It tasted pretty good but after refrigerating, even putting it in the microwave won't melt down the frosting. It's very hard if you put it in the fridge.

02.11.2010: AWESOME! :) 04.01.2011: I've played around with this recipe so many times and it's just the awesomest ever. Depending on the thinness (/thickness) of the glaze you desire, do adjust the butter and syrup. I usually use gloden syrup instead of corn syrup and only 2 tablespoons of butter. Thanks for sharing Ginger! (P.S. I even use left overs of this glaze with a slice of toast...Heaven!!) :D

Absolutely wonderful- make sure you use semi-sweet chocolate though- for some reason, when I used the milk chocolate or white chocolate, it just didn't work. I used this recipe for a cake glaze and also multiple times for chocolate strawberries.

Wow!  Really thick, rich, and delicious.  Great drizzled on a chocolate cake with ice cream on the side!  I made it for my daughters birthday.

This glaze is excellent especially if you enjoy a peanut butter/chocolate combination. Substitute peanut butter for the butter and microwave all at medium power for 30 second intervals, stirring each time. This was perfect with the 'Too Much Chocolate Cake' recipe on this website! A definite keeper. YUMMY!

Tasty. Thought it was better with shortening instead of butter for a more glossy, smooth, and silky texture. Also, deeper chocolate taste with some instant coffee granules/small shot of expresso.

I've used this twice now, and it's just perfect the way it is! I glazed homemade donuts with it as well as drizzled it over a cake with peanut butter frosting. I also put a thin layer of this in the middle of the cake on top of the frosting and it looked very pretty. This glaze sets up very nicely.

Hoo Hoo, we fought over who got to lick the bowl after this one.  I didn't change anything; I won't next time either, and believe you me, there *will* be a next time, boy howdy.  I had tasted our cake and didn't care for it too much plain, so I had to do something to fix it.  This is what fixed it, and how!

I'm sorry i couldnt give this a higher rating. It just tested liked melted chocolate chips. Which wasn't the taste i wanted for a glaze. Too strong!
To recover from this recipe i added 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar and a large scoop of peanut butter. It covered up the strong chocolate taste.  Im sorry.

My husband doesn't like icing on anything, but my brother wanted a chocolate pound cake with icing for Christmas. Before I take anything anywhere I make him taste test for me, as I am diabetic and he said it was great icing. That's a rave review.

Amazing! I won't be buying store bought frosting ever again. I made this tonight to go over a fudge chocolate cake , added some powdered sugar and strawberries. It was a hit, to say the least. I too used the microwave (30 second intervals at half power) to melt it down. It was perfect! Thank you for sharing!

Just made this glaze and am not sure how happy I am with it.  I noticed looking at the posted pictures that in some it looked rather thick - which I was hoping for - and in others it looked rather thin.  I decided to try it.  I followed the recipe except I heated it in the microwave.  It was too thin imo, so I let it sit to see if it would thicken any but it did not.  I decided to try what one reviewer mentioned and thicken it with powdered sugar.  Got it too thick and then thinned it with half & half.  Things were just not going my way!  The powdered sugar caused it to lose it's glossy look but that was restored with the addition of the  half & half.  The taste it okay but I'm not the biggest chocolate lover.  It's now on the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake I made from this site for my DD's birthday.  I'll update after I serve it tonight.  Sure wish I knew what accounts for the different consistencies.  UPDATE:  worked out fine, everybody loved it, said it tasted like fudge.

Tastes great, easy to make, but I have another recipe I would rather use because I think it drizzles better than this one, and that is important when you want the glaze to drizzle down the side of the cake and look nice.

I didn't have any corn syrup so I took another reviewer's suggestion and used honey instead.  Worked out great.  I microwaved everything in a Pirex measuring cup for 30 seconds, then stirred until everything was melted and spread/poured over my bundt cake (Too Much Chocolate Cake, also from this site).  It was the perfect consistency to run down the sides slowly, but it never reached the plate, so it was very neat.  Looked and tasted very good.  I even used the bit I had leftover on some strawberries.  Great go-to recipe for chocolate frosting.

Good recipe, will try again with more sugar OR a different type of chocolate.  Very satiny & good chocolate flavor but not sweet enough for me.

Excellent look and consistency.  Stiffens perfectly without being too hard, still very edible.  REALLY great for dipping cupcakes into, it coats them so nicely and holds anything you might put on top, i.e. fruit, sprinkles, etc.  Try it with the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe in either cake or cupcake form.  Wonderful.  It also stores very well.

Good for what it was, too thick and sweet for me but everyone else loved it and it did just what it was supposed to. I made it in the microwave, however, 45 seconds, stir, 45 more seconds, stir and drizzle.

OMG.  Incredibly easy.  Unbelievably quick.  I doubled the recipe and instead of Vanilla Extract, I substituted Kahlua and mixed the liqueur at the end.

and I cheated!! and used the microwave instead-  watch carefully as wattage varies between micorwaves-  mine is 1200 watts.  I placed ingredients in a glass measuring cup.  I zapped it for only 60 seconds, took it out and stirred it.  It was like SILK.  Beautiful glaze on top of my Espresso Fudge Bundt Cake.

I just made the glaze and it turned out great!  I had to make some adjustments. I didn't have any chocolate chips - so I had to use Bakers semisweet squares. I wasn't sure how many squares would equal 3/4 cup of chips. I went with 6 squares. In my uncertainty I used more butter - 4 tablespoons. And then added the 1 tablespoon cornsyrup. After microwaving 30 sec. and stirring, I felt the consistency wasn't going to be as thin as I wanted. So, I added 1tablespoon of butter. It turned out perfect - microwaved in 15 sec. intervals until it was done. Then I poured it over the bundt cake.
It looks beautiful!  And the flavor is great - I licked the bowl!

I made this to top the "Too much chocolate cake" recipe on this site. It was very easy to make & tastes good. I did not have light corn syrup so I substituted it with caramel syrup. I cooked it in the microwave as suggested by other reviewers & added the caramel syrup & vanilla after microwaving.  5 stars for how easy it was.

Excellent. Made exactly per recipe, and drizzled over a chocolate-butterscotch bundt cake.  This is the best chocolate glaze I've ever had. And ridiculously easy in the double boiler. Bravo!

Wonderful recipe and so easy!  I used a pyrex measuring cup and a microwave, which was much nicer than using a double boiler.  I also had semi-sweet bakers chocolate and chopped that up instead of chocolate chips.  This glaze is perfect to go on top of the Fluffy Cake Donuts recipe!

Perfect with the too much chocolate cake.  I've made this glaze twice - once in a double broiler, which was more time consuming, obviously.  I also made it in the microwave.  I followed one person's advice of microwaving 45 seconds, stirring, then microwaving 45 more seconds.  That was way too long, and I had to throw it out because it burned.  45 seconds one time is plenty.  Either way, it is a very good chocolate glaze.

Perfection!  I used 1 c. chocolate chips, 1/2 stick butter, 2 tbsp. corn syrup and 1/2 tsp. vanilla to make a little more-just enought for two dozen cupcakes.   Excellent consistency - thin enough to drizzle, but doesn't run off.  Great topping for the Black Bottom Cupcakes I from this site.  I just dipped the cupcakes in, and it was a smooth thick finish.

Perfect!  Just the right flavor and consistency for my favorite chocolate cake.  I also love that I don't have to break out the messy confectioner's sugar for this recipe.  I know, lazy!  But who doesn't love easy?  I simply placed the first 3 ingredients in a Pyrex glass measuring cup and microwaved for two 45 second intervals, stirring in between, as others suggested.  There is absolutely no excuse to use canned frosting when you can make this delicious homemade glaze in 90 seconds.  Another plus:  when the glaze sets it isn't as easily transfered to the foil or plastic wrap if you're transporting the cake w/o a carrier.  Less mess:)

WONDERFUL glaze!  Perfect for cupcakes!  I made the cream filled cupcakes using the Black Chocolate Cake recipe here and I just dipped the filled cupcakes into the glaze.  I did use some milk chocolate chips (a little less than half) with the semi sweet.  I ended up needing to make another batch because I made both jumbo and regular cupcakes.  The regular sized cupcakes were the easiest to dip.  The glaze is forgiving so you can use a cake spatula or spoon to cover spots that you miss.  It hardens like a chocolate genache..LOVE it!

Can't go wrong with chocolate and butter! I substituted corn syrup for 1 T sugar and 3/4 T milk.

Perfect and pretty. I used this recipe for my "Cream Filled Cupcakes" found on this site. The texture and taste was wonderful. I slowly melted in microwave (about 12 second intervals) stirring after every 12 seconds. I was able to dip cupcakes quickly and achieved nice coverage. When glaze started to get hard to work with (thick) I popped back into microwave for another few seconds.

I had a problem with this recipe.  I followed the directions and ended up with a sludgy chocolate mess.  I frosted one cake with it and then added about 3 Tbs of sour cream and whisked like a mad woman.  The glaze became thinner and smooth.  Both versions tasted great but the original was somewhat unsightly on one of the cakes.

This is an incredibly versatile glaze that tastes great. I used it to frost "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" for an extreme chocolate flavor. This recipe made enough for me to frost two 9-inch round cakes. I will definitely be using this chocolate glaze again!

This couldn't have been easier!  I put it in a 4 cup glass measuring cup, microwaved for 30 seconds, stirred, microwaved for another 20 seconds and added the vanilla.  It was perfect on homemade eclaires.

Super easy! Super tasty. If you want it to cover the whole cake you'll need to double it, but otherwise it looks pretty on a bundt cake drizzled! Like other reviews I threw it all in a pyrex safe bowl and microwaved for 45 seconds and then 15 and then 15 more and stirred in between. Super easy, super fast, super tasty!! I drizzled mine over the "Too much chocolate cake" from this site--it was to die for! :)

Today, I earned the titled of "World's Biggest Idiot."  Although I had this recipe printed in front of my face... I totally murdered it.  I doubled the chocolate chips (1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet).  But, that's where the doubling stopped... On accident here.  Only the 3 tbs of butter.  Only a tbs of Corn Syrup.  And then, I forgot the  vanilla... Halfway through frosting my cake is when I realized that I did this.  (Only because I was baffled that there wasn't enough to frost the sides of the cake - couldn't figure it out)  Ahhh, the perils of being a natural blonde.  Dying it doesn't make ya smarter.  However, the glaze was still awesome - so you can't mess this one up, even if you try.

I made this glaze to go with some doughnuts from this site and while we didn't care for the doughnuts, we loved this glaze!  I put the ingredients in a bowl and microwaved for about 25 seconds and stirred until it was melted.  I then added the vanilla and it turned out perfect.  I will keep this one to try on other treats!

I  tried this recipe as written. The glaze wasn't quite the consistency I was looking for. It was a bit too thick when set up. When I poured the glaze over the cake, it turned a little gloopy on top, lumps that set up too quickly. I used to microwave to melt 30 sec intervals. 
The next time I used this recipe I thinned out the mixture with a tablespoon of heavy cream, it was just the right consistency top pour on top of my bundt, getting that waterfall-like trickle of fudge over the sides, still satin like and easy to cut thru.

Make this in the microwave. It saves a lot of time, ensures that your chocolate won't burn, and is less of a mess. I like to put this over the "too much chocolate cake" from this site.

A double boiler can be made by just placing a metal bowl over a small sauce pan with 2 cups of water in it. I found it not quite sweet enough, but added extra corn syrup and vanilla to taste. Delicious and great consistency.

Perfect. Amazing. Like others, I just placed all ingredients in a microwave safe bowl, in the microwave and for about 1.5 mins, it was down- stir to see consistency and if too runny, then just add more chips. A big hit with the Too Much Chocolate Cake receipe from this site as well. Amazing!

LOVE IT!  I have used this recipe 2 times now:  once as written for cupcakes & once adding about a 1/2 cup of sifted confectioner's sugar (in order to thicken it to frost a layer cake).  Both turned out very well.  Will DEFINATELY use again.

Delicious and easy, not too heavy like icing usually is. Good made with half peanut butter chips as well.

Best glaze ever!  Easy, delicious, great sheen -- appearance brought raves then rich flavor brought more.  I can't imagine anything  that it wouldn't be good on.

Excellent, easy and quick to make. Tasty and drizzles quite nicely down the side of my Bundt cake. Make sure you follow the directions, trying to microwave the mix or having the double boiler too hot will cause disappointment.

I used the exact ingredients, but microwaved them.  The first time I did 45 seconds, stir, 45 seconds, stir, like one reviewer said.  The batter was lumpy and smelled a little burnt.  I tossed that and the next time I chopped up the butter a little bit and did 15 seconds, stir, 15 seconds, stir, and then another 15 just to be on the safe side.  The glaze was smooth and silky.  I used it on cupcakes.  All I did was dip the cupcake and lift it out.  They were oh so smooth and shiny.  Beautiful!  Much easier than smearing thick frosting all over 24 cupcakes.

Sweet and delicious tasting.  I know for next time, though... It hardens HARD when you put it in the fridge.  I used this on a Boston Cream Pie, and because of the custard inside, I put it in the fridge.  It was hard to cut when it was really cold.. but that's my fault.  This glaze is very good.

This recipe is very delicious when used on the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe from this website.  I thought it would be too runny, but when it cooled on the cake it held its shape without getting hard.  It also has a nice sheen to it.  It would be easy to adjust the quantity of ingredients if you need less or more glaze.

Very good.  Easily pours over cake, nice consistency.  I did it all in the microwave using 30 second increments.  I poured the glaze on top of Too Much Chocolate Bundt Cake from the all recipes site.

I followed this recipe as written and it worked well.  I used on a devil foods cake then put a raspberry sauce over it.  It was delicious.  My kids were happy to lick the bowl out for me so was my husband.

I've made this several times and it is perfect every time, whether done with the double boiler method given in the recipe or by microwave. I've also increased the amount by 1 1/2, depending on the size of the cake it's for.

I just tried this in the microwave. Did 30 seconds, mixed and 30 more seconds. The texture is completely GRAINY. It does not taste good. I just wasted 3/4 cup of chocolate chips and butter because this is going straight in the garbage. No good for anything.

Tried it, and loved it. It has a bitter-sweet taste that balances out any sweetness in the cake. And, it's very very easy to make. You don't need the double boiler. I just filled a sauce pan with water and placed a smaller one on top of it to melt the chocolate chips and the rest of the ingredients in, while the water was warming up.

This "glaze" is great over the Too Much Cholocate Cake.  I say "glaze" because it was pretty thick, more like a frosting-which I why I gave it 4 starts.  Not sure how it would run down the sides of anything! But it was very good and I got lots of compliments!!

Used this recipe, but used dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  Was wonderful on the sweet chocolate cake I made without adding too much sweetness.   Lovely!

This is such an easy, quick, delicious and beautiful glaze.  I made "Cream Filled Cupcakes" (chocolate) and topped with this glaze.  If you wait a minute or so it thickens and is quite easy to handle.  Today I made the same "Cream Filled Cupcakes" with Duncan Hines Orange cake mix and again used this glaze but used White Chocolate Chips and used orange extract instead of the vanilla extract.  So nice!!  I'm going to try it with other flavored Chips and combinations...Thanks so much!!  Edit on April 15...Just made this glaze to top the Cavity Maker Choc Cake but made as cupcakes...THE BEST CHOCOLATE CUPCAKES EVER!!

I made this recipe, using mini-bundt pans.  They turned out amazing!  They are a big hit at parties because they are so cute, and people love having their own little cake.  This recipe made 3 dozen mini-bundts.  They bake in only 16 minutes, but make sure you only put 1/4 cup of batter in each bundt.

I have made this twice with the Too Much Chocolate Cake and it gets rave reviews. I have substituted cut up premium chocolate bars for the chocolate chips, but that is all-oh and I melt it in the microwave.  Super quick, super easy, and the most important super delicious!

I topped the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site with this glaze.  It was a delicious addition.  Its very easy to make and was shiny and delicious.

Wonderful, easy glaze.  I made pumpkin cupcakes and didn't want to take the time to ice each one.  I made this glaze and just held the cupcakes upside down directly into the glaze and swirled.  All 12 done in under 3 minutes!  The glaze hardened just enough to be perfect.

Perfect!!  I made about another half recipe so there would be enough to cover the bundt cake.  Will be making many times I am sure!

This was very good - I've never used butter in a glaze before but liked it.  I don't have a double boiler so just melted on lowest temp and kept a constant eye on it - it came out great and was perfect over the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe that is also on this site.

Wow!!! This glaze is perfect.  I followed the microwave directions from one of the other reviewers.  I used this to glaze a Ribboned Fudge Cake (from this site).  I made this for a birthday at work and everyone raved over it.  I had several request for the recipe.

Yummy and so easy in the microwave.  I heated for 10 or 15 seconds at a time, stirring in between until smooth.  Get it on the cake fast, it sets up quickly.  Looks pretty too.

I didn't like this one at all.  The cake I put it on was much sweeter than the glaze and it tasted too bitter by comparison; most of the guests I served the cake to ended up leaving the glaze on their plates.  If I try it again, I will use sweet chocolate instead, maybe it will go better with the cake.

As many others, I don't have a double boiler, I took others suggestions and put all ingredients (less vanilla) in the microwarve at 30 second intervals, stirring each time til melted.  I added the vanilla afterwards.  I also sprayed the measuring spoon with pam, so the corn syrup would slide off.  I ussed them on cupcakes, and instead of spreading on, I found that dipping the tops of the cupcakes in the frosting worked best...but you have to work fast before the frosting hardens.  It is really rich and yummy!

Tasted quite good, but the icing went really hard when I refrigerated the cake.  If you're going to chill the cake, make sure to take it out at least an hour before serving so it goes back to room temperature, otherwise it will crumble.  Doesn't affect the taste in any way though!

I've always made a chocolate glaze recipe almost exactly like this (my mom's recipe) but I've never seen it written anywhere.  This one includes a tiny amount of vanilla, which my mom's doesn't have and I liked the subtle addition.

I omitt the butter and use 3 tbsp. corn syrup, and melt the rest of the ingredients in a microwave safe bowl in 30 second increments. I mix until it is of a drizzle-type consistency. I pour it into a wilton drizzle bottle (or you can use a heavy zip-lock bag and snip off the end) and drizzle it over cakes and bars. I also make it with white chocolate chips and caramel flavored chocolate chips. It hardens ontop of the bars and it makes all my baked goods so appealing!

Good glaze, perfect on the "too much chocolate cake".  Make sure to drizzle all down the sides of the cake, don't rely on the frosting dripping down as it dries very fast and will not make it all the way to the plate!

I used this to glaze a double chocolate bundt cake. I don't have a double boiler so I melted the ingredients in the microwave with excellent results. It was easy to prepare and a perfect topping to my cake.

satiny is the perfect word for this glaze!  it's too late to be whipping up frosting so i decided to try this recipe.  i scaled recipe down to 8 which was perfect for a 9x13 cake.  so easy to make and very delicious!  i used about 1/2 a cup of milk chocolate chips because i didn't have enough semi sweet chips - this glaze is very rich so you can't tell much.  just cooked right on stove in small sauce pan over direct med/low heat stirring constantly until every bit of butter melted.  poured very slowly right on top of cake which is still in it's pan careful not to not drip down sides where cake pulled away from pan.  i was able to use every bit of frosting because it thickens up quick enough.  my daughter is taking it to school tomorrow in the pan.  i licked the spoon - yum!  thanks for sharing and thanks to all the members for their wonderful tips and reviews.

Perfect.  Very easy to make, even without a microwave.  Takes just a minute, but really adds something to a cake.  I think about 1 1/2 times the recipe would be the perfect quantity for a bundt cake.  Thanks!

This frosting was so easy and tasted great! I especially liked it because I always have these ingredients on hand. I make brownies from a box frequently and like to put frosting on them. This will be the one I'll use from now on. It was perfect for a 9 X 13 pan of brownies.

Perfect for bundt cakes.  I make it in a large pyrex measuring cup in the microwave.  It's easy to pour over the cake using the cup.

This was a hit! I didn't have corn syrup and so used  honey and it still came out great! Try serving with either 'too much chocolate cake' or 'chocolate cavity maker cake.' I have used the glaze with both cakes with much success!

I have used this glaze several times and it always comes out nice.  I heat it in the microwave for about 30 seconds, stir, and then 10 more seconds.  It is not as thin as some glazes and does not set up hard but holds onto the cake and is very very tasty!!

This is a scrumptious cake topping, but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers--it's not what I was thinking of when I searched for "glaze". It's really almost too thick to pour, and I ended up using a knife to help spread it over my cake.

I followed recipe exactly.  It was perfect.  I was able to easily drizzle it.  For the people that said it was too thick - I think 2 more minutes in the double boiler will make the perfect consistency.

Very tasty and simple to make. I used 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips and 1/4 cup semisweet, then went the quick and easy route of microwaving my ingredients in a measuring cup for about 30 seconds. Gave it a good stir, zapped for another 15 seconds, then whisked it well to finish blending and make smooth. Drizzled it over the Too Much Chocolate Cake from this site - worked very well and was just the right amount for a bundt cake. Will have a picture up soon!

This is delicious!  I used 1 cup of chocolate chips (wanted to use them up) and used half milk chocolate.  Added an extra TBS of both butter and corn syrup.  I don't have a double boiler, so I used a good-quality saucepan over the lowest heat.  I added a few drizzles of honey because at first it looked like it wasn't going to work.  I used salted butter, to bring out the flavors of the chocolate.  This turned out perfect!  So yummy, almost like hot fudge!  I drizzled it over Whipping Cream Pound Cake, and it looked really beautiful, running down the sides and everything.  It clung to the sides of the cake well and firmed up so nicely too, without getting crusty.  Thanks for a great recipe!  :)

WOW!!!  SOOOOO easy to make and quite delicious.  Similar to fudge and chocolate ganache, but yet not quite like either of those.  I made Dark Chocolate Cake I and made 1 round cake and some cupcakes and made two bathces of this glaze to spread over it.  It made the cakes!!  It was the perfect complement to that particular recipie.  I made it in the microwave, just threw the ingredients into a container and zapped it for 1 minute, stirred and VOILA!  This will be a regular from now on!

This was really good!  I used it on a cake that was already sweet so it was a little too much.  The glaze is fantastic but make sure you don't add it to something already really rich!  Thanks a bunch though!  I know I'll use it again!

Yummy and gorgeous. I drizzed this over a chocolate pound cake, and one of my guests was surprised when I offered her a slice - she thought it was a decoration!

Made this recipe FOUR times in a day in different ways to prevent a grainy clumpy icing. The key is to melt the butter and Karo syrup in the microwave first until melted THEN add the chocolate chips and vanilla. Use a wire whisk to mix it up and it will be smooth and pourable. I did use the spoon to spread just a little and it worked perfectly and went down the sides. Pour while hot for best results. *I did use Nestle Chocolate Chips and it was good. For best results, use a higher quality of chocolate chips. Cakes were served at a wedding and were a hit!

Perfect consistency for a "controlled" drip. Used honey in lieu of corn syrup. Microwaved for 30 seconds, stir, 20 seconds, stir, perfect. Beautiful and tasty.

Great recipe for a nice fast glaze.  I also did the microwave method (45 sec, stir.  45 sec stir.  Pour) and it turned out great.  Looks beautiful and flavor was very good, but not the best. Only substitution was artificial maple syrup instead of corn syrup (it's mostly corn syrup anyway!) because it's what I had on hand.

This was fabulous on Black Magic Cake! I don't have a double boiler, so I just put all the ingredients in a small sauce pan and kept stirring until it because glossy - drizzled beautifully, and tastes divine! The recipe made more than I really needed, but I enjoyed licking it off the spoon : )

I followed others suggestions of micrwaving to melt.  I increased my vanilla to 1/2 tsp.  It was perfectly smooth.  I will try this again with dark chocolate as I used semi-sweet this time.

I just made this glaze and found the consistency was great but then I like that it's a little thicker.  I had to substitute honey for the corn syrup but you can't tell in the taste or consistency. I wrote the glaze recipe on the back of my Triple Chocolate Cake recipe, making it quadruple chocolate now.

One of the easiest glaze recipes I've made.  Don't mess with the double boiler if you have a microwave because it isn't needed.  30 seconds in my microwave then about a minute stiring and it was ready to pour on the cake.  It is not a super sweet chocolate glaze and goes perfectly with chocolate cake with chocolate chips added.  I used light butter and a touch more corn syrup and it was just the right consistency and sweetness.  Will definitely use again when I need a chocolate glaze.

Great glaze! Replaced corn syrup with honey as one reviewer wrote, microwave for 45 secs. and stir. Then microwave for 2 more 15 second intervals, stirring in-between. Noticed the glaze was thicker than what I wanted (for a cake) and added 1/4 tsp WARM water. Stirred again and that was it. It spreads beautifully on the triple chocolate cake I have and has this nice shine to it. Decorated the top of the chocolate cake with dabs of homemade whipped cream to cut the chocolate richness. Thank you for the recipe and for all your helpful reviews.

This came out amazing! So shiny & beautiful. I also microwaved it in 15 sec. intervals & used honey instead of corn syrup like some one else suggested. I'm a new baker & this was so incredibly easy, definitely will use again!

I wasn't impressed with this at all. I did the microwave method as many others suggested. I ended up throwing the first batch out as all I got was a mess of chocolate and butter that wouldn't mix together. When I attempted it a second time the ingredients mixed, but it was thick like a frosting, not thin like a glaze and definitely not pourable. I had to add 1 to 2 tablespoons milk to it to make it work. It tasted OK, but I've had better and for what I got, it was way too much trouble.

I agree with other users; I didn't know this would be more like a frosting, I assumed it would be a thin glaze. I also melted in the microwave in internvals of melting/stirring/melting. It looked too buttery at first so I added a bit more chips until I had the right consistency. It hardens up nice and is not greasy as it looked. It was so easy and tasted great, which is what I was looking for!

I wasn't crazy about this glaze.  It came out like it was supposed to, I guess but it was a bit too "rich" for my taste.  I don't care for semi-sweet chocolate (aside from chocolate chips in cookies) so maybe it was more a matter of personal taste.  There was no sweetness to this.

WOW!!! This recipe deserves more than 5 stars! It is absolutely delicious - the perfect balance of sweet and rich. Not too bitter at all. It lives up to the name "Satiny." It was smooth as silk, and looked absolutely beautiful drizzled over my triple chocolate bundt cake. My husband and I used the leftover glaze over ice cream - TO DIE FOR! I made it in the microwave as some other reviewers suggested. This will be made again and again, for sure!

5 stars!  It looks beautiful, exactly as pictured, and tastes as good as it looks.  Wouldn't have thought of the corn syrup which makes it shiny.

Made this glaze, didn't think it was too sweet.  Also made it and added ~1 tsp orange extract - chocolate/orange combination was so good.  Many compliments.  Thanks for the idea.

I made a double boiler out of a pot a ramekin (spelling?) and a cereal bowl works great!!
I also made the happy mistake with using only 1 tsp. of corn syrup and a 1 whole tsp. of vanilla. This made a great dipping chocolate for cupcakes. it cut my frosting time in half and then some! Tastes great!

This was a delicious glaze. I followed others advice and made a double batch for a bundt cake. That was WAY too much. Just make one batch and it will be the perfect amount of drizzle. I also accidentally forgot the vanilla...It was great without it, but I'm sure it would be even better with it!

After spending the day being snowed in I decided to make some red velvet cupcakes from scratch.  I used for the first time my newly purchased apple corer to fill them with the cream filled recipe of Grace W. from this website and topped it off with this satiny chocolate glaze.  I actually think this recipe is better than ganache.  I am quite pleased that I was able to turn out a bake shop  quality cupcake.  Sometimes I even surprise myself!! :)

So easy and delicious!  I microwaved the chocolate chips, butter and corn syrup stirring in 30 second intervals until melted and smooth.  Add the vanilla at the end.

Awesome recipe! I made this today to use on the Cream filled cupcakes from this site. I microwaved the ingredients and it was super easy. I also ran out of butter so I used crisco in its place. No one can tell the difference. Can't wait to use this again!

Loved this!  Made in the microwave just as easy as a double boiler but with less pans.  Used to top the cream filled cupcakes from this site.  Will definitely be using this recipe often!  Gonna try it with white chocolate next but not "chips" as they seems to melt differently - kinda soft.   Will use the bark instead.

This is an awesome glaze & so easy to make. Like most of the other reviews I did this in the microwave and it turned out great. Used peppermint extract insted of vanilla for a holiday treat!

Well, if someone can screw this up, it's I!  I carefully melted on low on the stove and it just became a gelatinous goop in which the ingredients wouldn't incorporate.  I decided to try it again in the microwave and it worked great!  Be careful how much time you use at a time as some microwaves are more powerful.  I did mine only 20 seconds at a time and I used milk chocolate chips due to preference.  Great recipe!

VERY GOOD!!! Came out perfect, didn't use double boiler, just paid extra close attention and melted choc. on low. Drizzled atop the "too much choc. cake" recipe....mmmmm. No complaints here....just a few extra pounds!!! This frosting is good for some things, but does dry & harden so I wouldn't use on cupcakes. Enjoy!

I tried it in the microwave like other reviewers suggested and it turned out horribly. I don't know if i overmixed it or if it was the quality of the chocolate, but it was instantly grainy and never emulsified. Completely wasted!

This is 5 star!!  Easy to make and does not run down (and off a cake). I put it on my cake at night and in the morning it was set perfectly so  I could cover it and the glaze did not stick to the waxed paper

I've made this recipe twice now - used it to glaze a butter bundt cake both times.   It's SO easy to make and only has a few ingredients (all if which I always have on hand).     It has a rich chocolate flavor.   Because it isn't real sweet, the glaze is fabulous with some coconut sprinkled on top.

Simple and very easy.  I microwaved in ceramic dish (15 second intervals) stirring with a chop stick and it worked very well.  I also added some almond extract which gave it a very nice flavor.

It's been said many time in the reviews how good this glaze is and I'm adding my two thumbs up as well! I used it on a "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site and the combination was to die for!

Excellent recipe!  Put it over the Too Much Chocolate Cake.  This would also be good using other types of chips (white chocolate, butterscotch, peanut butter, etc.).  This is going in my official recipe book.

I made this glaze to top the Too Much Chocolate Cake from this site. Didn't feel like going through the trouble of using a double boiler, so I microwaved it in a pyrex measuring cup. First for 30 seconds, then stirred it and added the vanilla extract, then microwaved it for another 30 seconds and it was done. It was definitely easy to make, but I thought it could have been a little sweeter. If I make it again I will use milk chocolate chips.

DIVINE!  Super easy, super tasty, very impressive!  I will say that ONE batch in plenty of glaze for a bundt pan size cake, I doubled this the first time based on reviews and ended up with WAY too much frosting for my cake.  The second time I did a single batch and it was plenty.   You could use this on pretty much anything...cake, cupcakes, cookies, etc. Good recipe!

I followed the reviews and made this in the microwave (added the vanilla last), used this on a "fudge marble" bundt cake and came out delicious!  I made the whole cake the night before, let it cool completely and refrigerated overnight.  Then I let it sit at room temp for about 2 hours so the glaze wouldn't be so hard.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best glaze ever for the bundt cake.  I put it in a ziplock with a small hole in the corner and piped it on my cake.  It looked so professional my husband said I should take a picture.  It has a nice creamy texture.

I wish there were more stars!!!! I put this over a very disappointing cake... the glaze was such a hit! For breakfast, we ate just the glazed portions of the cake and tossed the rest. Beautiful, shiny, and SOOOOOOOOO good. I'm going to be searching for other things to put this glaze on!

This was extremely tasty and so simple. My daugher loved this with the "Too much chocolate cake". The two recipes compliment each other. I will be taking this to work, and can't wait to see the reaction.

I greased my spoon before pouring corn syrup so it slips out easily and microwaved all ingredients, except vanilla on HIGH for the first 45 seconds, Vanilla was then stirred into the half-melted chocolate mixture and continued on HIGH again for the next 30 seconds and it's done! Such a simple, mouth watering yet really satiny glaze's ready for my topping with "Too Much Chocolate Cake" which has an uneven shape due to my trimming of burnt parts of cake but it has perfectly moistened my cake! It's another easy keeper for sure!

I Love this recipe, I always make this when I make "Chantal's New York Cheesecake". Or "Too Much Chocolate Cake" ....Even for Frozen cheesecake pops, the cheesecake always has leftover batter, so I bake the extra batter with NO crust, then freeze it. When I'm in the mood, I get the frozen cheesecake and use an ice cream scoop, make a ball, poke it with a wooden pop and dip into this glaze and refreeze (my kids roll in in sprinkles) It's to die for....

I used brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup but other then that I followed the recipe exactly. It was perfectly glossy and smooth and amazingly delicious. To keep the syrup from sticking to your measuring spoon grease it lightly with a bit of oil or butter. That way it'll just slide right out.

This glaze turned out perfect and was so easy to make.  I microwaved all ingredients together in 45 second intervals, stirring thouroughly after each 45 seconds - end result was perfect satiny glaze!!  This recipe is a WINNER.  Thanks for posting such a fabulous & easy recipe.

This was excellent!!!  While I had to sub ingredients due to food allergies, this recipe would still have turned out fantastic as is.  I used gluten-and-dairy-free chocolate chips, Smart Balance (dairy-free butter spread) in place of the butter, and agave syrup in place of the corn syrup.  My only complaint (which is not the recipe's fault), is that the Smart Balance doesn't quite sub 1:1.  I probably could have used 2 tbs. instead of 3, and it would have had a slightly better consistency).  I made the whole thing in a measuring cup in the microwave, and it was the perfect for drizzling on a chocolate zucchini bundt cake.  It set up beautifully, held up well even after a few days in the fridge and wasn't too sweet.  Awesome recipe!  Thanks!!!

This was perfect over "Too much chocolate cake" from this website. I used all the ingredients as stated, but I cooked the glaze in the microwave. Add all ingredients except the vanilla to a glass bowl, cook for 45 seconds (don't worry if not all chips appear melted, they will when you stir it), and stir in the vanilla. Viola. Delicious!

Wow, you won't find and easier or better recipe!!It takes about 1-1 1/2 minutes in the microwave and you have to stir it every 20-30 seconds. I don't measure the ingredients so I don't have to wash any sticky spoons and it always turns out perfect. I use it on the Black Magic cake also on the site. A slice of heaven! I made it twice now and will make many, many more times!!!!!

Very easy.  I doubled the recipe and microwaved it for 30 seconds, stirred and then 30 seconds more.  After it was all mixed I put it in the refrigerator for 5 minutes (3 times) stirring in between, and then put it on cupcakes. It looks beautiful.  It's not overly sweet, but it's very rich.

I just made this for the Too Much Chocolate cake based on previous reviews. I used 1/2 butterscotch chips and half chocolate chips. It was SO delicious and perfect with the cake (which, if you haven't made it yet, go make it right now!).

EXCELLENT! Going in my recipe box as a keeper. Used it on Too Much Chocolate Cake, also from this site...BEST COMBINATION AND NOT TOO RICH AT ALL! Other reviewers suggest that it hardened quickly but for me that was not that case. I put it in the microwave for 45 seconds, stirred it, then popped it in another 15 seconds, then beat again and just spread it on. Really beautiful application!

I used the microwave as suggested by other reviewers, and accidently put a full tsp of vanilla... it ended up not being a biggie as the glaze tasted great.  Mine came out quite a bit like what you would expect to find on a good, thickly frosted, chocolate donut.  Hubby certainly approved :-)

Not that this needed another rating.. but it was super yummy and super easy in the microwave, I used almond extract instead of vanilla and used it on teh Too Chocolate Chocolate Cake on this site.. it was wonderful!  Thanks!  Oh.. if you dont want it to get so hard.. add another tablespoon of butter.. wonderful!

I loved this glaze (had to double it for the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe as my cake turned out dry as a bone.  This is easy to make, had the ingredients on hand, and poured smoothly.  Thank You - can't wait to try it on a better cake recipe!

I didn't have any butter so I substituted butter-flavor shortening and had to really whisk it, as it does not melt as fast as chocolate...but it turned out great!  I also made this in the microwave as others suggested.  This glaze set up perfectly...not too hard, not too soft.  You have to work pretty fast because it will set up quickly, however.  I made a chocolate peanut butter cake and I got tons of compliments on the glaze itself. The color of your glaze will be the color of the chocolate that you use.  I did "work" the glaze onto the cake and so it was not super-shiny but it was still beautiful.  This recipe is a winner and a great substitute when you haven't any whipping cream to make a ganache.

Fabulous! I microwaved it, just seemed easier that way. Did 20 seconds and then stirred, 4 times so a total of 1 minute 20 seconds. Very smooth, poured so nicely over my cake and stayed where it landed! I poured it over a devil's food bundt cake and then sifted some powdered sugar on top for effect. A gorgeous and delicious cake made even better by this perfect glaze!

Excellent recipe for chocolate glaze.  This chocolate hardens to such a lovely glaze.  The taste is delicious!  I made this exactly as the recipe states and am quite happy with the results.  My family loved it.  I also, made a white glaze to drizzle over the top.  The nice thing about this recipe is that the chocolate takes a while to set up so you have time to add designs with other confectionary into the chocolate.  A+ thanks!!!

VERY easy to make and delicious.  Instead of the double boiler, I melted the ingredients in a small Pyrex bowl in the microwave, as suggested in some other reviews.  I melted it at medium heat for about 45 seconds, stirred it and then for another 45, and then it was perfect!  It was the perfect addition to the Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake (see my other reviews for this YUMMY recipe!).  Overall, a fabulous glaze for any cake.  Would also make a great hot fudge sauce!  I could have licked the bowl clean!!!

Yummy.  I have made several times and it always comes out perfect.  The consistency is thick and perfect for drizzling over pastries.  I especially like to use the "chocolate cavity maker cake" recipe from this site and bake it in a square pan.  Once done I use a biscuit cutter and cut out small round cakes.  I then drizzle with this glaze.  Garnish with a berry and mint leaf and you are looking pretty fancy!

I only had 1/2 cup chocolate chips, so I made a decreased recipe with 2 T. butter, 2 t. corn syrup and 1/8 t. vanilla. This was still more than enough to dribble over a bundt cake! And it tastes WONDERFUL--especially drizzled warm over a warm chocolate cherry cake!!!

This was delicious!  I do not have a double broiler, so I just prepared the recipe in a saucepan and melted everything together over low heat.  The consistancy and flavor were great.

Really super-easy in the microwave. Took less than 5 minutes to make and drizzle onto my cake. I used 1/4 tsp. orange extract and it was a huge hit.

This was a quick easy recipe but next time I will use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  It was a little to bitter for us.

This tasted great!! I used it over a banana chocolate chip bundt cake and my friends and family loved it! It didn't drizzle very well, but that's better than being too runny, so I can't complain.

Great recipe! This was very easy to make, had a wonderful glaze consistency and tasted heavenly. I don't have a double-boiler so I used a pyrex bowl perched on top of a small saucepan.

Maybe I'm being too picky, but while this was very good, it didn't wow me. It wasn't particularly "satiny". Just a yummy way to make a glaze of almost pure chocolate. I'm not sure whether I'll use this recipe again; I'll probably try out some others.

nice glaze but needs to be thinned in order to pour over the cake and flow nicely. I used evaporated milk. I microwaved for 40 seconds, stirring once in the middle.

I was looking for a glaze to put on top of the Chocolate Lovers' Favorite Cake (from this site) and this was perfect. The ingredients were on hand, the recipe was simple, and the glaze turned out perfect. It was smooth, rich, and delicious, and looked so decadent drizzled over the top of the cake.

This is the perfect chocolate glaze for donuts!  I have an automatic mini donut maker and used this glaze on some donuts that had some mini chocolate chips in the batter. Very rich! This would be perfect on plain doughnuts as well. Thanks for the recipe!

This glaze is the perfect consistency to drizzle over a cake-makes a beautiful Bundt cake.  It tastes like it's time-consuming to make, but it is very quick and easy. My sister loved it  drizzled over her chocolate birthday cake.  I'd definitely make it again.

Great taste. I added "salt to taste" for a contrast to the sweetness. I can see adding other flavors to this base for amazing flavors. The texture is not silky. I'd like to try this with different chocolates ( I used Toll House semi-sweet mini chips) and see if I can get a better texture.

If you add the vanilla extract after you have already melted the chocolate, it will cause the chocolate to seize. I'm pretty sure this is why a lot of people are complaining about a grainy texture. If you add the vanilla before you melt the chocolate, the glaze comes out okay. However it is not nearly liquid enough to actually drizzle over a bundt cake, and having to spread it out kind of ruins the satiny glaze appearance. It tastes good, though.

This glaze is fantastic!  I was making cream puffs for one of my kids to take to a church activity.  I was running short on time and the glaze recipe I usually use was too time consuming.  I found this and I will never go back to the old one.  I just microwaved the ingredients in 30-second intervals instead of using the double boiler and it worked beautifully.  I am excited to use this on cakes and anything else that calls for a delicious chocolate glaze.

This is my favorite chocolate glaze recipe.  I make it to put on top of cakes and pies.  I even wonder if it would work for eclairs.  It is wonderful as written, however I usually sub honey for the corn syrup because I don't keep corn syrup around and I have found that subbing heavy cream for the butter works just fine.  My only suggestion to others is to be sure you cook it at a very low setting so that chocolate does not burn.  Low and slow gives great results.

So easy to make and turned out great on my second try. First time added the choco chips first and melted together with the butter and corn syrup. Big mistake. The chocolate got too hot and turned grainy. Went back to the reviews and saw member Jae suggested melting the butter and syrup first then add chips and finally vanilla.  Bingo fast and easy and turned out great. Thanks Ginger for sharing.

This was the first time I made a chocolate glaze.  I microwaved the corn syrup and butter, then added the chocolate and let it melt naturally. I put it over a bundt cake and it was perfect.   Sets up nicely and tastes good.

Yum. Made this in a small non stick sauce pan. Came out GREAT! I used about a cup of odds and ends chocolate chips/chunks and minis that I had on hand. Also upped the corn syrup to about two TBlsp. It was a great consistency, not runny, (dumped on warm to a still barely warm cake) and it held up beautifully! I was really amazed by the finished product. It was kinda shiny, I was intrigued as I've never made a frosting/icing? like it. I'm usually a tub girl. It hasn't quite firmed up yet, I'm anxious to see what it's like when it does. I am totally gonna use this for chocolate dipped strawberries!!! Thanks to another reviewer for that idea. Give it a try, I think it's a pretty forgiving recipe.

I followed the directions exactly as the recipe states and the glaze came out perfect. I love my double boiler and I'm sure this makes the difference for those who have had success versus those who had difficulties with texture. Easy. Tasty. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Just made this glaze for a bundt cake I made for the 4th of July.  I followed other suggestions to put all ingredients in bowl (with a little extra corn syrup) and microwaved for 20 seconds, stirred, then remicrowaved in 10 second increments.  Took about a total of 50 seconds to get smooth, shiny, glaze that covered the cake and looks great.  I tasted the glaze and thought it was good; not too sweet.  It's a winner in my book and easy!

This recipe is amazing! I was sceptical because of the chocolate chips but it works just perfect and is a nice semi-hard glaze. It was smooth and rich and stayed chewy-hard at room temperature. I will use this all the time now! I didn't change a thing (but used a pot of boiling water and a bowl).

I am so disappointed with this recipe! I made it first in the microwave and it separated and failed and then I decided to make it in the doubleboiler which is a lot more trouble. It still started separating and the texture was lumpy. I thought maybe the first time I let the chips get too hot so didn't the second time. I have been baking all my life and would like to know what I did wrong.

Prepared this recipe as written, using a double boiler. It came out thick and grainy, wouldn't drizzle over my cake, and hardened into a matte shell. I was extremely disappointed and will not be using this recipe again.

I made this glaze according to directions except for the double boiler.  I added everything to a glass bowl and microwaved on high for 30 seconds, stirred, then another 10 seconds.  It turned out perfectly.  It poured nicely and clung to the cake just right.  It was not grainy at all.  Loved it!

This was delicious! I used milk instead of corn syrup and it turned out great. I only gave 4 stars because it calls for corn syrup, which is practically diabetes-in-a-bottle and almost guaranteed to be GMO unless it's organic. I also added some peppermint flavoring and it was super yummy. Will definitely be making again!

EXCELLENT even as Dairy Free!
I whipped this up in less than 5 minutes, using dairy-free butter substitute (stick kind, gold package) & dairy free (& soy-, gluten-, & everything-but-chocolate-free  chocolate nuggets. I was in a hurry, so heated everything in the microwave, 10 or so seconds at a time so it wouldn't scorch. I put it on some GF brownies that don’t taste so hot without the cream cheese swirl, & the glaze totally rescued them…this stuff would rescue anything! INCREDIBLE!!

This was so delicious! I added just a touch of almond extract which took it to another level. 
I took some of the suggestions here and simply prepared it in the microwave. Much easier!

This was a good recipe to work with, but needed some tweaking. I was using it as a glaze on chocolate cupcakes. As some of the other reviewers stated this recipe can be grainy. I made mine on the stove and it was very stiff, like a bad grainy frosting. I think it really depends on your quality of chocolate and butter, elevation and your overall climate. To get rid of the grainy or thickness, ADD about a TEASPOON at a time of shortening to smooth it out. It may take a bit til you get the perfect consistency, but you will get there. Don't over do it as it can make the chocolate not set up the way you want. You can test it by using a spoon and seeing how it comes off it back in the pot. Too thick and slow, add more shortening. Too thin? Add more choc. I was doing 12 cupcakes. This recipe would probably make 16. I dipped sliced apples in my left overs :)

YUM! This is a super easy, rich chocolate topper that is not a full on creamy frosting, but definitely not a thin seeps-into-your-baked-good liquid, either. I took the advice of my other reviewers and just melted the chips, butter and syrup together in the microwave in intervals, stirring in between, until everything was melted, then added the extract. The glaze doesn't really ever "harden"-it definitely achieves a firmer consistency when cooled, but it's still quite soft long after cooling. But, it's not a liquid, either-it's won't absorb into your baked good. It's somewhere between a syrup and an actual frosting and an excellent choice for a bundt cake, doughnuts, or possibly even piping on a traditional cake. It's absolutely delicious as well!

I really like this recipe for chocolate glaze ... you have to work fast because it stiffens quickly.  I didn't have chips, so I used 2 semi sweet 1 oz squares and added a little bit of milk.  Wonderful to taste and spread perfectly o my eclairs.

Great glaze. Made in Microwave for easy prep. It hardens after cooling. If you have leftover glaze, it heats up in microwave again.

This is great!  I made it in the microwave as suggested in other reviews.  Worked fantastic. Glaze is shiny and taste like donut glaze.  Will use this over and over for many things.  Today was bundt cake and I am thinking next will be brownies!

I've made this twice now, but instead of using a double boiler, I melt in the microwave. Half power, increments of 30 seconds, and keep a keen eye on it. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and was so impressed with the outcome and the ease of it, I decided to use it with a few twists to ice my boyfriend's birthday cake. I added a couple shots of whiskey and omitted the corn syrup for that. The outcome was a more shell-like covering, but still very good. This icing also looks great with a powder sugar stencil to decorate it (but do it just before you serve it, as the sugar will absorb any oil in the icing and get goopy).

Awesome recipe, although I don't use the vanilla. I found it was troublesome the last time I tried it, but I love the taste of this one. I microwave it or do in on the cookstove and love it. ;)

I had to use up 1 oz. each of a semi-sweet and unsweetended baking bars.  Melted it in the microwave using a total of 3 T. corn syrup to compensate for the unsweetened chocolate.  Very nice and not too sweet, just as we like it!  Thank you.

Very good glaze. I used it on the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe from this site. I got requests to make that cake again at our next family gathering. My daugher also took it to school for her colorguard banquet. I love how easy it is to make the glaze with no double boiler, one reviewer told us how to just pop it in the microwave for 45 seconds, then go straight to 15 second increments if it's still not melted when you stir it. Good tip because my chocolate never comes out right when I try to double boil.

I use this recipe all the time, especially over brownies with toasted walnuts on top.  I recently put it on a chocolate cake covered with a caramel topping, and drizzled this on top (also with nuts). So versatile and delicious.

Excellent, excellent! It is so simple to make and has a wonderful taste. I made it for a bundt cake and the glaze flowed in the right places on the cake. At first I thought it was going to remain soft and gooey. instead, it hardened somewhat and it was so glossy.  Love this. I will use this over and over.  Thank you for a inexpensive and impressive glaze.

I used this glaze on top of the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe on this site. It. is. amazing. I don't have a double broiler so I used a glass pyrex pie pan atop a small pot of simmering water. Stir, stir, stir! For some reason my glaze came out more spreadable than drizzly, but no matter! I just spread it on the cake and sank into chocolate heaven. This is AMAZING. I will make this repeatedly!!!

So. Good! It was a little too fluid and satiny at first, but hardened to a nice consistency later to my endless joy! Nice chocolate fragrance and taste... it was very decadent with the Too Much Chocolate Cake on this site!

Microwaved it. Perfect for the Big Top Doughnut silicon pan I have that makes a doughnut shaped cake. Very easy and DELICIOUS. I mixed semi sweet, milk and white and doubled the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This is so yummy!  It is so easy and more cost effective than store-bought.  I used the microwave, instead of the oven, as suggested by another reviewer.  My children loved it so much they made me make 2 batches to cover a bundt cake!

When this is warm I think this recipe would be better without the corn syrup.  It had a chemical taste that I just couldn't get past.  I may try it again with sugar.  After it cools, it does not taste as chemically.

I was looking for a glaze to drizzle over donuts and tried this one.  A reviewer mentioned it's too thick to drizzle so I cut back on the chocolate chips.  In the end it was still a little thick, next time I'll add more liquid to make it runny.  Overall great taste and easy to make in the microwave!

This topping is good, but it's certainly not a glaze.  It's more of a sauce, kinda reminded me of fudge ice cream topping.  I even added a little water or more water to it to try and thin it out. This helped it not be as thick, but it never hardened to to the touch. It tasted good, but wasn't what I was looking for.

Wonderful, simple recipe! I, too, had used this on the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe. I had used the microwave, but I will melt it the old-fashioned way with the double boiler method next time. Even if this didn't come out as melted as I'd wanted it to be, this is a very tasty icing recipe!

great glaze recipe! this recipe really compliments the too much chocolate cake recipe off this site perfectly. my ONLY problem was that i used white chocolate chips and the vanilla didn't seem to want to mix in - it just kept floating to the top. i was really worried because the mixture seemed really gloopy but in the end everyone loved it after it dried on the cake. my sister said it was her favorite part of the cake

I used the microwave method and it turned out great.  I also tried it with white chocolate chips, which was a huge failure.  While the semi-sweet chocolate turned out marvelous, wonderful texture and taste, the white chocolate turned out looking like melted cheese and was almost chewy.

This glaze is SUPER easy to whip up and it makes your baked goods look like a professional put it together!  I do not have a double boiler, but this also works if you heat it up in the microwave...just make sure that you take it out and stir every 30 seconds or so.  :~)

This is the best glaze I have every made.  I took a cake to work and was able to take the stuff for this glaze with me (measured out in baggies) and make it in the microwave at work.  - I just brought a large size glass measuring cup and fixed it up in that.  Then poured over the cake. -  It's Easy, Quick, and REALLY Good!!!

This is a perfect glaze. I used to top some banana bars I made. I did make two changes: I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and used the microwave instead of the stove top. This recipe is a keeper.

Very easy and tasty. Didn't change a thing except for using the mini chocolate chips for quicker melting. You also do not need to use a double broiler as long as the heat is turned down. As someone previously suggested, you might want to double this recipe because it doesn't make a lot.

This was recommended to use on the "Too Much Chocolate" cake. Great counterpoint to the sweetness of the cake, with the semisweet chips. Microwaved it for about 45 seconds, and used honey instead of corn syrup. Awesome!!!

Made in microwave.  Stir every 20 seconds or so until melted.  Very easy and very good.  Drizzled on top of Too Much Chocolate Cake from this site.

This glaze was perfect on my cake....may use half milk chocolate and half semi sweet next time though. The consistancy was perfect!

Easy and delicious! Used microwave method as suggested by other reviewers. Microwaved 1 minute and stirred. I used this to glaze a 13x9 inch cake. Suggestion: spray measuring spoon with cooking spray before using it to measure corn syrup. This allows it to come out smoothly and not stick.

Good and definitely chocolatey, but not quite "glaze-y" like I was expecting. I thought the texture would be similar to the glaze on a doughnut, but it was more like the shell on a chocolate-covered strawberry. I tried it on a chocolate bundt cake, but thought it was too hard and didn't go well. It'd probably be better on strawberries, pretzels, or as an eclair topping.

Simply decadent. I was making this to top Chocolate Peanut Butter Marble Cake from this site, so I added about 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter while heating. It urned out great; I will certainly use this again. Thanks! :)

I've drizzled over round and sheet cakes... doubling the recipe for a 9x13.  I don't have a double-boiler, so I just heat on the stove stirring constantly... butter first, and when it's half-melted, I add the chocolate and corn syrup.  I usually remove it from the heat before adding the vanilla, but as long as that happens at about the same time, it doesn't matter. Simple, easy, and very professional looking!

This was the perfect topping for my bundt cake. And I have zero artistic ability so it was nice to have something to just drizzle and let it fall.

Delicious! The only downside is that it was more of a frosting than a glaze, so I added milk unitl I got the consistancy I liked. I servied it over the "Too much chocolate cake" from this site...it was heavenly.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

We LOVED this glaze!!  Doubled it to pour over the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe here, so as to cover to whole top and sides of a 9 inch double decker .  Just a note to others, this hardens to a hard shell, but we loved that.  This could be because we refrigerated the whole cake due to it having whipped cream on it, as well.  Maybe it stays softer if it sits out the whole time!! Anyways, thanks a bunch for the terrific recipe!!

Perfect. I like the way it sets after pouring or drizzling. I used it as a drizzle for the One Bowl Chocolate Cake and it was perfect. To drizzle I pour the glaze in a ziploc bag and cut off a corner. The smaller the hole the thinner the drizzle. I'm sticking with this glaze!

Wonderful recipe ~ a keeper.  It was quick and easy, too.  Only change I made was using agave sweetner in place of the lite corn syrup because I didn't have it.  Can't get any better than this.  I used it on Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip cake from this site. Maybe it would even be good on a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I just made this Chocolate glaze and drizzled it over an Inside-Out Chocolate Bundt Cake.  It is awesome, fantastic consistance and flavor.  Will make this again for sure!  Only thing I did differently was I took the lazy mans way out and did it in the microwave....2 minutes at 50% power was perfect!  Thanks Ginger!

I totally loved the texture and consistency of this lovely glaze. It worked perfect for a devil's food cake that i made for a friend's birthday. It spreads and pours very very well! I used a microwave because Im very lazy. I substituted the corn syrup with molasses as I had a huge bottle of leftovers from gingerbread cookies. The semisweet was replaced with 70% Cadbury darks as I went for a heavy taste and it s more "glossy" + dark? I guess! Anyhow, this is a definite saver and I will use it again on other chocolate cakes! It tastes and looks alike to the filling of chocolate molten cakes!

BEAUTIFUL!  This glaze is so beautiful, and it tastes even better.  It was a little thick, but I just kind of piled it on the top of the bundt & shook the cake plate, and it fell down beautifully.

This was great on my husband's birthday cake.  I'm an amatuer baker and this was very easy!  I used semisweet chocolate chips for the main glaze, then made another batch with a few chucks of white bark chocolate to drizzle on to make it pretty! Used it on the "Too Much Chocolate" bundt cake from this site. So sweet and delicious!

Tip: If glaze is too thick use 2-3 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream to thin out. I did this and it worked PERFECTLY! This glaze is outstanding! I used it on the "Ribboned Fudge Cake" on this site and it was amazing. Will be adding this one to the recipe box for sure!

Wonderful! I made this as a light glaze for over my Pumpkin Gingerbread-so delicious! (I will confess, I did omit the vanilla though) Thank you for this keeper!

This is a very good glaze. Perfect texture. It was my first time making a glaze and it came out perfectly. I only had bittersweet chips and it still tasted great.

I made this in a glass measuring cup in the microwave and it came out perfect.  I microwaved it for about 30 seconds and then stirred in the vanilla.  It only needed about 30-45 more seconds in the microwave after that.  This was super quick and easy to put on the top of my Chocolate Eclair Cake.  Hardens with a nice shiny coat.  YUMMY!  Thanks.

I made this to top another recipe on the site (cream-filled cupcakes), and it was delicious! I love the fact it sets up quickly, but doesn't get hard/crunchy even after sitting for a night. I actually tripled the recipe and topped cupcakes, biscotti, and cookies with it. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a delicious glaze to go on nearly anything! A nice suggestion would be to add liquor or flavoring (orange, anise, or cherry) for just a hint of something extra.

This came together very well. I had a cup of mini chocolate chips so we added a little more of the other ingredients to balance out. Tasty and looked really nice on my chocolate bundt cake. I'll be using this again I'm sure. Thank you. I did cook it in the microwave and that was fine.

it was really easy to make.  the only thing is it came out a bit too sweet.  but i think its the chocolate that i used.  either way...this is a recipe keeper cause of how easy it was to make.  i made a bundt cake that kind of ruined when i took it out of the mold.  the chocolate sauce along with powdered sugar totally saved the day.  you couldn't even tell there was anything wrong with the cake!  thanks

Deadly and so easy to make!  Like others, I made mine in the microwave.  I first melted the butter and then added the corn syrup and chips and heated for 30 seconds.  I then stirred and microwaved for another 30 seconds and it was done.  Delicious on "Too Mcuh Chocolate Cake" recipe from this site.  Easiest frosting ever and one that will be used often!  Has a nice sheen to it and looks pretty.

This deserves five stars just for being the easiest glaze recipe ever! I made it in the microwave as others recommended and I will always follow this method in the future because it's so much less hassle than using a double boiler. It was very thick though so didn't drizzle well (looked more like blobs of glaze! LOL)The appearance didn't effect the great taste though! Next time I might try adding a little more corn syrup to thin it out, but I have no complaints with this recipe!

I didn't have any corn syrup so I used honey instead, which was fine, and I made it in the microwave. So fast and easy. The glaze had a nice consistency for pouring over a bundt cake - thin enough to drizzle down the sides a bit, but not so thin that it all slid off. I used it on a german chocolate bundt cake, then sprinkled the top with coconut and pecans. Yum.

Finally!  There's no need to look any further for a simple chocolate glaze icing.  This recipe has fulfilled my 7 year quest for a chocolate bundt glaze that's SMOOTH, non-clumping, easy to make, and can be stored at room temperature.  I've made dozens of variations on this, and this is the only one that I'll try ever again.  Perfect.

It's a keeper for sure!!  Made this to glaze the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe from this site (which is also FABULOUS!!!) and it worked out perfectly! Exactly the right amount of glaze and perfect pouring consistency.  I even copied the photo and sprinkled mini chocolate chips and chopped walnuts on top.      Have also made the "Easy Chocolate Bundt cake glaze" from this site...which is also tasty but in my opinion makes a bit too much glaze for 1 cake and needs to sit and thicken for a few minutes before you can pour it over the cake.

This is the easiest glaze to make in the microwave.  I put all ingredients in a bowl and microwaved on 40% power for about a minute.  I stirred the glaze and it was just beautiful with perfect consistency.  It looks just like the picture and is the right amount for a bundt cake. Terrific..

I make mine in the microwave. Adding everything but the vanilla and set on High for 30 seconds. Then I just stir until it is all smooth and add the vanilla. Depending on what you are using this with, you can be creative. Use different extracts or white chocolate. Perfect glaze for the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site.

I made this to top off a chocolate cake and it made a world of difference! I didn't have any light corn syrup on hand, so I had to use the dark, but I really don't think it would have made any difference to be honest. This was so rich and chocolatey and amazing!

This is THE glaze I've been looking for. This stuff is perfect!  I was looking for a glaze that wouldn't get too hard, but also one that would 'cling' to the cake and not run everywhere.  It firms up just enough - not too hard or too soft or runny.  I made it with white chocolate chips and put it on the Too Much Chocolate Cake (also from this site) and drizzled milk chocolate over it.  It tastes good, and looks great!  I'll be using this over and over again.

Excellent! Microwaved in glass measuring cup for 45 seconds. I used honey instead of corn syrup and it came out wonderful! I received many compliments on the icing and it was so easy!

Very delicious and super simple recipe.  Like the previous reviewer, my favorite chocolate cake is the Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Chocolate Cake that is on the back of the Hershey's Cocoa box.  I made that cake yesterday in a bundt pan and poured this glaze over the cake.  Delicious and decadent.  It just does not get any better than that!!!

I put this awesome chocolate glaze on the Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake (on the back of the Hershey's cocoa can.This is THE BEST chocolate cake I have EVER had.) This is a wonderful "frosting" and so very easy to make. I took the advice of the other reviews and put it in the microwave. Defenitely will make this from now on. Everyone loved it!!

This came out perfect! I was so tired of trying to find a frosting recipe that didn't use powdered sugar as the base, and here I am! I used it on my boyfriends double chocolate birthday cake and let it sit ontop (inside the pan) overnight and it firmed up just a bit. I also added in a tablespoon of milk to make it more smooth. I will def invest in a bunt cake pan and make this again and again.

This is so easy to make! There is no need for a double boiler when you can use a Pyrex measuring cup, and just use the microwave. The glaze pours on so easily, and the results are much better than just using microwaved chocolate chips (the lazy way).

This glaze is so unbelievably easy and delicious that I know I will use it over and over throughout the years. I used the microwave as opposed to a double boiler. I doubled the recipe, used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, cut the butter into pieces, added the corn syrup and tossed it in the microwave for one minute, stirred vigorously several times, put it back in for another 20 seconds and it beautifully smooth and glossy after a few stirs. I stirred several more times to cool it down and thicken it up a bit, then spooned it on two dozen chocolate cupcakes and topped them with an oreo cookie for my son's birthday party at pre-school. (There was a fair amount left over, too.) It sets up so nicely - it retains it's lovely gloss and the cookies adhered perfectly. Pure elegance on a dessert and it is sooo easy!

I put all ingredients in a microwave safe bowl and cooked in the microwave for 45 seconds and stirred.  Then drizzled over Too Much Chocolate Cake from this web site.  Very easy, very delicious recipe!  I get compliments whenever I make it!!

I poured this over a Chocolate Fudge Bundt Cake and it was soooo good!!  I had some left over and used it to pour over ice cream.  I found my fingers dipping into what went on the cake platter from the bundt cake, like a little kid.  I would reccomend this for many uses.  THANKS!!!

YUMMY!  Made this over the weekend for my brother in law's birthday (made Black Magic Cake from this site) and it turned out beautifully!  I didn't have any corn syrup, so made my own boiling together a sugar/water combo.  Turned out great and went on the cake so nicely!  With it being so cold, left the cake in the garage before eating and the glaze was a nice cold layer of chocolate on the cake, mmmm!

This has to be one of the easiest & tastiest 'frosting' type recipes I've ever made.  Used with Black Magic Cake & Rick's Buttercream Frosting (both from AR).  OH MY GOODNESS!  Excellent cake for the chocolate lover.

This was absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe and like another reviewer I did not have corn syrup so I substituted with honey. This did turn out more like an icing than a glaze but it was perfect and super shiny. It tasted wonderful and I will make this recipe before buying any store bought icing again.

Good. thicker than expected. I let it cool a bit too long since I thought it was runnier than it was. It ended up gobby on the cake (my fault completely). I would recommend pouring over the cake as soon as it is ready. It cools quickly and will look much smoother on the cake. Overall great taste and texture

Great recipe. And really dummy-proof.
I used this glaze for the top of the Eclair Dessert from this site. Worked out perfectly. TIP: If you don't have a double boiler, just use a pot filled 1/4 with water and place a glass/ceramic bowl that fits right over. Works like a charm.

This is really, really good. I made it to top a chocolate bundt cake, and this glaze was absolutely fabulous. I did use honey instead of corn syrup as I was out of corn syrup, but I can't say that seemed to affect the taste any. It's really chocolately, very nice looking, very easy to make, and just extremely good!

Really easy to make.  I doubled it (had a little too much) and poured it over Too Much Chocolate Cake.  I would highly reccomend both! Enjoy!

I made glaze to top a cake (Too Much Chocolate Cake) for my sister's birthday to have on 9/20/2008.  It went over VERY well!  I followed the recipe to a "t" - doubled - and it turned out perfectly.  Thank you for sharing!

Pretty good.  I didn't have corn syrup so I used honey.  I also made mine in the microwave using 30 second intervals.  It's definately MUCH easier that way!  Made a hard chocolate top.

I used this on the cream filled cup cakes, stays shiny and thick, sets up nice, a little on the sweet side so if used on a cake that is not to sweet it would be an excellant glaze.

I love this recipe! I made an espresso chocolate glaze for the top of my "Too Much Chocolate Cake" using this as a base. I used 1 cup of Guittard semi-sweet chocolate chips since they already have the vanilla. Instead I added 1 shot of espresso and kept the corn syrup and butter the same. It turned out a perfect glaze.

5 Stars for the aroma of this glaze alone.  I served over 'Double Chocolate Brownie Cake' from this site.  I too microwaved, no need for the stove top.

I followed another reviewer's suggestions about using the mircowave and it worked out great! I used 3 semi-sweet baking squares of chocolate instead of the chips. It could have been a tiny bit sweeter...next time I might up the corn syrup a little. I didn't make for a bundt cake, used with the Country Banana Bread from this site.

Made this in the microwave without any problems.  It was quick and easy.  I had to use milk chocolate chips as that is what was here but it was still wonderful.  Used it to frost the Too Much Chocolate cake on this site.  Excellent!!!!!

I needed a simple glaze for mini brownies that I baked for Valentine's goodies. This worked wonderfully! I prepared in the microwave, and dipped the brownies, then covered some with sprinkles, sliced almonds, toffee chips, and swirled chocolate chips. Excellent recipe, and tastes great! Thanks!

Fabulous!  I used on the "Too much chocolate cake" recipe from this site.  I also doubled the recipe.  So good - it never hardens but stays a rich fudge-like consistency.  I also plan on subbing out the chocolate chips for peanut butter chips.

I really liked this glaze. Thick and good taste. It was thicker than I expected so next time I would spread it a bit more to encourge it to run down the cake.

I decreased this recipe to about a third (1/4 cup chocolate chips, 1 tbsp butter, 1 tsp corn syrup, 1/8 tsp vanilla) and it was the perfect amount to cover a 8.5 x 4.5 loaf of chocolate banana bread. I felt that the glaze was rather sub-par on its own, but paired nicely with the bread. It also hardened nicely and was very shiny. All in all, it was ok, but I'm not sure I'd use it again.

It could have been the chocolate chips I used, though; they were definitely not high quality.

Perfect....just microwave for 30-45 seconds and stir.  Drizzle over a chocolate bundt cake and you have a super dessert!

I've used this recipe so much that I practically have it memorized.  Great glaze for "dripping down" the sides of a bundt cake.

I loved this recipe because it was quick, easy, and set up without becoming hard and brittle.  I microwaved mini chips, butter, and corn syrup for 30 seconds and stirred in the vanilla.  It was a little thick, which made it more of a challenge to drizzle, but it looked great and stuck to the cake.  The taste is superb.  I was worried that it would taste like plain old chocolate chips, but it didn't taste that way at all.

I used this per other reviewers' advice and put it on the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe from this site.  It was delicious.  I combined everything but the vanilla and microwaved it for about 30 seconds.  It melted perfectly!  I mixed in the vanilla and it was done. Turned out wonderful--so easy!

How is something so delicious even POSSIBLE?  This is by FAR the best thing I have ever made.  I made cupcakes with the "One bowl chocolate cake III" recipe on this site, and covered them with this...I am literally in heaven!

This is my standard chocolate glaze and I love it!  It is easy and delicious.  I used it most recently for a friend's birthday.  I made cupcakes, glazed them with this and spelled out "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" with melted white chocolate, one letter per cupcake.  It is very versatile and has a very nice shine.

This was good.  I substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup and used baking chocolate instead of chips. (can't get these simple things in Germany)turned out great though.  My husband thought that the maple syrup made it even more flavorful.

This chocolate glaze recipe was amazing!!! It came out perfect. I made it and spooned it over my cream puffs and it was a hit. Although mine came out more like a frosting, i wouldn't have it any other way. This will be added to my collection and will be used often.

Great glaze recipe, Ginger.  Glossy and not too sweet.  Mine didn't set hard but didn't run too badly down my cake (Too Much Chocolate Cake from this site).  I may have used the glaze when it was too warm though.

I didn't have chocolate chips and used 3 semi-sweet baking squares instead. So simple and incredible over a yellow Bundt cake. My family has already asked me to make this again!

I used this for homemade doughnuts.  I used trans fat-free, cholesterol-free Crisco shortening instead of butter, and left out the corn syrup entirely. This was fantastic drizzled over lightly glazed doughnuts.  I plan on submitting a photo as well.  Great recipe!

So Good!  I also used honey instead of corn syrup like another reviewer suggested.  It turned out great.  And since I have no double boiler, I just melted the chocolate in the microwave and then added the remaining ingredients.

Wow, this is great!  I followed previous suggestions and used honey instead of corn syrup (we avoid corn syrup and hydrogentated oils in my home) and for ease of prep used the microwave.  I put all the ingredients into a 2 cup PYREX measuring container, I microwaved for 30 seconds stirred and microwaved for another 30 seconds.  So easy and so delicious.  I drizzled it over my favorite all recipes cake (Lisa's Chocolate Chip Bundt Cake) and then sprinkled it with mini M&Ms.  Everyone thought it was a beautiful and rich cake.  Several commented that it tasted like fudge frosting. I will never mess around with my powdered sugar glaze again!! Thanks!

This is an excellent glaze, and has so many uses.  I have used it to dip strawberrys and raspberrys in.  I've also added almond extract to the glaze, which is wonderful, and drizzled it over Chocolate Lovers' Favorite Cake.  WOW!!  This makes a winning combination.  Next time I make this, I want to add maybe some mint extract to the choclate, or raspberry.  Thanks for this recipe!

Even tho I don't like chocolate, and did not like this glaze, the rest of my family were crazy about it. Very easy to make. It was just the right amount for a bundt cake. Every Christmas I make an amaretto cheese cake...I think this would be a great topping for it. My husband and children thank you for this recipe!

FANTASTIC !
My brother in law can't have any kind of milk what-so-ever.
Made him a special cake that he could have, and used this recipe instead of frosting over the top.
( no milk in semi-sweet chips )
Everyone loved it, so yummy !!!
I've since made the usual version of choc. cake with this too,
and I've come to like it BETTER than frosting !

This was good but it hardens when refrigerated.  I thought the corn syrup might keep it soft.  On another note, I'll try milk chocolate chips next time just because I don't care for semi sweet quite as much.

This is excellent on my new favorite cake, Hershey's Best Chocolate Cake (on this site).  Using this glaze makes a fast, easy and impressive dessert when the cake is baked in a bundt pan.  My husband remarked that it tasted just like a Hostess cupcake without the filling!  It made me laugh, but I have to agree!

Perfect compliment to "Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cake".   Smooth rich flavor and absolutely foolproof - I even did it in the microwave!  I'll definitely be using this one again!

I let it cool to room temp. I thinned a small amount of it with milk and then 'sauce painted' with it on a cake plate. Then (carefully) set a plain NY style cheesecake on the plate and drizzled the remained (unthinned) glaze over the top of the cheesecake. Beautiful, delicious and elegant!

This turned out great. I drizzled it on the too much chocolate bundt cake and it was perfect. I didn't use a double broiler just melted it in a sauce pan. Yum...

Great recipe! If you have trouble it’s because of the chocolate chips. You need to use semi-sweet. I read the reviews first and I’m glad I saw to make sure to use the right chocolate. I made another batch with white chocolate chips and that turned out all grainy and I threw it out. I wanted to make a white swirl design in the chocolate so I ended up microwaving 1/4 cup of white chips, stirring till smooth, then made tiny dots on top of the chocolate glaze, then swirling it with a toothpick. It came out perfect. The chocolate was definitely shiny.

It was thicker than I anticipated and not very shiny. I had to put it in a bag and pipe it on, as it would not spoon and drip down the sides. It was still nice looking, tasted fine, and set up nicely....just not really what I was looking for.

I followed the recipe except microwaved the ingredients as others had suggested. It turned out very well. The only thing is that there wears specs of chocolate chips that wouldn’t melt. This is probably because I used the mini chocolate chips rather than full size. Was still pretty and great tasting.

It was fine. I used the microwave to make it and I don’t know. It was almost like you could ball some up in a ball. I just didn’t like the consistency... any advice this what it look like. Taste wise it was fine.

Wonderful!! I topped chocolate cookies with this icing then crushed candy canes. The hit of the cookie exchange. This icing isn't gooey sweet, it is just chocolaty, and smooth. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

Made this to glaze a chocolate bundt cake.   Not only was it super easy to make,  it turned out great.  Nice and smooth, not grainy at all.  You need to move  promptly to drizzle your cake though, as it starts to thicken as it cools.  Its definitely going into my recipe file for a go-to glaze.

Use a double boiler. I microwaved based on some reviews and the consistency was very off for me, more like a thicker frosting than a glaze. I was so bothered by it after applying it to my Boston cream pie, I decided to make another batch using the instructions (which is what I’ve always done in the past). Lo and behold, it’s the perfect consistency I was looking for. I took a picture of both batches, microwaved and then using the double boiler method. I’m sure this birthday treat will be doubly good since it now has 2 coats of chocolate!

I made this glaze exactly as said in the recipe. Came out PERFECT. Drippy enough to run down the side of my cake, but not pool at the bottom. It made it look so professional! This is a keeper for sure.

Used this  on top of a chocolate bundt cake. Very easy and turned out excellent. Made it in a two cup glass measuring cup in the microwave. Stirred it every 30 seconds on high.  Could not have been any easier. Poured it right out of the  measuring cup onto the cake. Looked beautiful. Big hit with the family.

Easy to make on the stove top as long as you use low heat and constantly stir under a watchful eye.  I followed another reviewer who said to use honey in place of corn syrup which worked out very well. But I was hoping the glaze would harden better.

Super easy! I put the cream in the microwave for about 2 minutes until it was boiling and then stirred in the chocolate. I used chocolate chips...FYI, about 1 1/2 cup is 9 ounces. Came out perfect!

My first attempt with the glaze I used 50% Hershey's Dark chocolate chips and the microwave method, it worked beautifully. It does harden fast so for the satiny sheen finish work quickly and pour while it is still warm. Excellent recipe and very easy to make.

This recipe is fantastic! Perfect for the drip cakes. I used 4 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate bar (Baker's brand) in place of the semi-sweet chocolate chips. Melted it all together in the microwave at 20 second intervals and it turned out perfect. Tasted great, dried solid and made beautiful drips. This recipe will definitely be one I come back to time and again. Thanks for sharing it!

I’ve made many chocolate glazes and this one is grainy and not pourable over a cake. Microwaving chocolate chips and adding nothing is more satiny than this glaze.

Great recipe. For those who say it’s grainy, it’s not the recipe but the chocolate chips you’re using. The most expensive isn’t always the best in these recipes using chocolate chips. Try again with different brands until you find the one that works for you. I used a store brand after Ghiradelli didn’t work for me.

Made this to glaze brownies. Put it all in a glass microwave dish for 2×40sec intervals. Its perfect, satiny just like the title.

I really expected satiny smooth...almost a mirror glaze.  But, as much as it was tasty, it was grainy in appearance and not satiny at all.  I took off heat, added the vanilla and it seized up.  I ditched it twice and went to chocolate chips in the microwave.

It gets a bit hard when it sets or once it's chilled, so it is also perfect for making other chocolate dipped treats.  I have used it for cake pops, dipped krispy treats, and strawberries.  This recipe is easy to make, and looks beautiful.  The leftovers reheat in seconds and reuse well, so there is no waste.

I warmed in microwave for 45 sec and then mixed thoroughly to melt remainder. Our micro is hot so next time I’ll start with 30 seconds. The glaze is delicious and I served it drizzled over Rick’s Buttercream Icing from this site. Will definitely make again!

I do not know who are the people who find a fault with this glaze. It looks great, it is surprisingly delicious considering simplicity of method, it works with any chocolate cake going, it is easy to make. I do it all the time. For sure I could persevere with something extra specially special if I wanted to, but this is just so good, I have no need to dig for another.

I made it quickly in the microwave, stirring every 15 seconds and took only a minute of microwave time.  It had the consistency I was looking for. I simply dipped the mini cream puffs in the mixture and done.  Fast, easy and delicious.

This was fabulous. I also did not have light corn syrup and used honey instead. I also read what the professional baker said about not being “silky”.  I double the honey or light corn syrup.  Micro for 45 sec, stirred, micro another 15 sec, stirred and then another 15 sec.  when I took it out, I whisked the mixture until smooth. Perfection! Silky, drizzled on cake. Will use this recipe always!

Super easy, very smooth and pourable.  I used same ingredient measurements, but melted chocolate chips and butter in microwave for about 45 seconds.  Stirred, microwaved again for 15 seconds.  Stirred.  Added remaining ingredients.  Voila, instant chocolate glaze, with nice smooth shine.

I've made this glaze 5 times now. My favorite is the "chocolate eclair dessert" from this site. The first 2 times I did not microwave it quite enough and it did seem a little grainy but still delicious! I now have figured out to keep microwaving 15 seconds at a time past the melting of the chocolate until it turns perfectly satiny and pourable onto the top of the dessert. It hardens nicely, looks incredible on your dessert and YUMMY!

I put all the ingredients in a Pyrex saucepan in a 185 degree oven for 35 minutes. I stirred, let it cool a smidgen, and poured. Lovely consistency and taste. I would double next time.

I don't have a double boiler but followed one reviewers suggestion to put all the ingredients, except the vanilla, in a glass measuring cup for 45 seconds. I added the vanilla and let it sit for about 2 minutes because it was very hot. This glaze poured beautifully and is definitely shiny (for those who thought "shiny" shouldn't be in the title. A definite go-to. I only wish I could find a healthier substitute than corn syrup. I'll play around with this and report back!

Made this using double boiler as directed, but substituted  simple syrup for corn syrup, and used it to frost a Boston Cream Pie. Tasted great, looked great, but after refrigerating the frosted pie, the glaze was so hard that it made cutting and serving very difficult - had to saw through the hardened glaze causing the filling to squish out.

Very good glaze I used on a 2 layer cake, making it look dripping down the sides of each layer intentionally. Very attractive glaze, and I got many compliments on the look and extreme chocolatey fragrance and taste.

I need a quick and easy glaze/frosting and this was amazing!!  You can just put everything in a Pyrex container and melt it in a microwave to make things easier.

This was so easy. I microwaved the chips and the butter for 39 seconds and then added the corn syrup. And microwaved 30 seconds more. Stirred beautifully and added vanilla.

I thought this was great once it cooled and hardened! it was satiny, smooth, and delicious! I microwaved it instead of warming it on the stove and it was quick and easy.

Very, very simple to make. I was looking for an easy glaze that didn't need heavy cream since I didn't always have it on hand, and was happily surprised to find this recipe. Next time I make it, I might add some more sugar (I found it a bit too dark-chocolate-y for me) or even some espresso powder. 

As is, I would recommend this recipe.  (:

The glaze cake out thick and creamy. It was a little thick for drizzling over a bundt cake but I think that can be fixed with a little more corn syrup. Didn't have any graininess that others complain about. I think I prevented that by using high quality Ghirideli chocolate chips and by melting the butter and corn syrup before adding them.

This was a quick, easy, and great tasting topping for fresh baked donuts.  I followed reviewer "SOPHIESTWIN", who microwaved the chocolate chips, butter, and corn syrup.  I also did as she suggested and sprayed the measuring spoon with oil before getting corn syrup, so the corn syrup didn't stick (this trick works great for recipes with honey and molasses as well). 
I simply dipped my donuts in the glaze and set them on a cooling rack.  Worked great!

Best chocolate sauce I've tried!  Contrary to the review from the "baker" who claimed to have made this 4 times. The result was a deep, rich chocolate flavour with a silky smooth texture. Professional results with little effort. This is my now go-to recipe. Thank you!

5 Star all the way! Easy to prepare, and oh so good! I even dipped strawberries in the glaze and placed them around my cake! 
Took this to a dinner party, I'm usually the one who brings desert and this was a new hit,  from cake to glaze. Defiantly, I'll be doing this again and again!

This is my go to chocolate glaze for a wide variety of cakes.  Like others, I make it in the microwave in a pyrex measuring cup.  I recently drizzled it over an angel food cake I had spiked with amaretto and chocolate shavings.  I sprinkled toasted almonds on top of the glaze and it was a huge hit.

This cake is fool proof and delicious! I can easily see why it has so many 5 star reviews. I followed the ingredients with the exception of using mini chocolate chips instead of the regular size (per another reviewer). I also topped the cake with a chocolate glaze and mini chocolate chips.

Have used this several times and it is great. Only three stars because I use the microwave method and it is not a "satiny" texture, so it's not as pretty as I would like when putting on a bundt cake. But, still a wonderful recipe! Have it tucked away and will probably modify it next time in order to change the texture.

EDIT: I changed from a 4 to a 5 due to my guests feedback. One thought I had bought the cake since the glaze was so pretty. Another raved about the glaze aroma when I lifted the cake plate. It did smell heavenly!  My original review follows: I was looking for a dark chocolate glaze to top an orange bundt cake.  I had to use honey since I didn't have corn syrup, and added a little extra for more sweetness. I combined the butter and honey and microwaved until warm to combine, then added the chocolate chips and microwaved in 10 second intervals, stirring until smooth. I mixed about  3 tsp dark cocoa powder, combined with enough orange liqueur to make a runny paste and added it to the smooth chocolate/butter mixture, along with some vanilla and orange extract. The taste was just what I had hoped! I rated 4 stars since I never seem to know the right time to glaze a cake (my fault, not the recipes!) I either do it too soon and too much glaze ends up on the plate, or I wait too long and the glaze firms up too much and looks gloppy. I would like to learn to cut down glazing time and still have a pretty cake.  This glaze turned out a beautiful, dark glossy brown--quite pretty, but I had to add glaze in small amounts at a time to keep it all from dripping off!  If glazing had gone faster, it would earn 5 stars. I will make this again!

this was very easy to make. I put it on a chocolate bundt cake. it was thicker than I wanted. I heated corn syrup and butter on low heat then removed from heat to stir in chocolate chips and vanilla as someone suggested. next time I will try using the microwave with a bit more syrup. hope that this thins the glaze. hope my cake goes over nicely at our 4th of July gathering

I had a very hard time getting enough of this glaze to do the top of a cake I made. It also hardened wayyy too quick for my liking - I may try this again using more butter and perhaps more chocolate but I am not sure at this point. It does taste good however and tastewise it was received well by my husband,teenage daughter and toddler

I have used this "glaze" for two different recipes now.  I used it once in more of a drizzle fashion and once in more of the same fashion as the main pick (poured all at once on a cake letting it drip over the sides).  Taste wise it was good, not great.  Maybe I should try it with a different chocolate (maybe dark or something, Idk, i used semisweet as the recipe calls).  Both times, it seemed pretty thick though.  Not very glaze-y.  It's more like a runny icing or even a frosting than a glaze. 

Both recipes I used this on were various types of chocolate cake.  I might use this again on a strawberry cake or basically something not chocolate, but I'm not in love with it.

Yes, I used 4 oz of Bakers Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate instead of chips and Agave syrup instead of  corn syrup.  Turned out just fine and was a hit on my Dark Chocolate Mayonnaise Cake.

This chocolate tasted great, however it is not really the taste I wanted. I was looking for a chocolate that went well for doughnuts, but this would probably go better on a cake. I thought it would be good if it said it can be used for doughnuts, but it just does not go. I wish I was making a cake because I would have used this precipice for it. I used this in the microwave, and mixed the chocolate every ten to twenty seconds. It turned out good in the end, but the flavor just was not for what I wanted. My family agreed with me, and one of them stated, "My least favorite part to these doughnuts is the chocolate. It just doesn't go." Next time I make a cake, hopefully they will like it more.

My cake went from so-so to wo-ho!  This recipe is simple and delicious.  My advice is to work fast because it sets up quickly.  I didn't follow the recipe EXACTLY because I used the microwave instead of a double-boiler, but I don't think that really had any bearing on the outcome.  It's the ingredients here that make this work.

Made recipe as indicated.  I'd hoped it would be a little thinner for what I was utilizing it for.  Added a shade more butter, corn syrup, vanilla to get it to the desired consistency.   Flavor is great.  Combined with a chocolate cake and chocolate frosting, this was a **huge** hit with friends this past weekend and colleagues to start the work week...

This chocolate glaze is so good, it firms up and is a fudgy/chewy texture! I put it on my Cheesecake Swirled Brownies and keep it in the refrigerator.  I made this in the microwave as others suggested and it was so quick and easy that I would do it no other way! This makes enough glaze for a 13x9 pan.

So easy and so delish! I even forgot to add the vanilla and it was great!! I used honey vs corn syrup simply because I had it on hand and didn't want to go to the store. I will for sure make this again.

This glaze is excellent!  To me, it has the texture and taste of the chocolate glaze on donuts.  Mine seemed to be a little thicker than what it looks like in some of the photos but that could be because the cake I put it on was not warm.  Unlike others who said the icing turned out grainy, mine was perfect.  I followed the ingredient amounts exactly but chose mini-morsels verses regular size.  Because I did not have a double-boiler, I heated the corn syrup and vanilla extract in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirred, then 15 seconds, stirred, then 15 seconds again before adding the chocolate morsels and stirring again until all were melted.  That's it!  This was so quick and easy I couldn't believe it.   I put this on top of the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site.  It was perfect!  Just the right amount for a "topping."  I highly recommend this recipe.

If your chocolate seizes up (which mine did with both the double broiler and microwave method), you can save it by beating in 4 ounces of softened (full fat) cream cheese. I think it's the fat in the cream cheese that actually changes the gritty texture back to a smooth and silky delight.

I used this on my personal recipe (cherry muffin-cookies), and it is a great addition to them. They are now called chocolate covered cherry cakes! :) I added a bit more vanilla, and put a bit of cinnamon on top, but overall, this is a great recipe. The texture is surprising to me, and I think it is much better than your average melted-chocolate frosting.

You don't need to bother with a double boiler, easily done in microwave or on stove, just watch the heat carefully, chocolate burns so quickly!  This is an easy, quick and delicious recipe for a chocolate glaze which hardens to a shell, It was excellent, but remember it will only be as good as the quality of your ingredients, so use good quality good chocolate.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong? It didn't turn out "satiny."  I used a high quality chocolate and a very high quality butter. It still tasted great but was grainy rather than smooth looking.

I made 2/3 of a batch to drizzle over a chocolate bundt cake. I did not want to overwhelm the cake or have it piled up on the cake plate instead! It was the perfect amount. I did add a dash of salt. I had no problems with the crystalizing some people had and I used a stove top double boiler. I also had no problem with the "wrinkling" that some had. Again, that might have been due to using so much glaze and having the weight of it drag it down before it had completely set. I'll be using this recipe again. Thanks!

this glaze is ok, it has a nice taste but is just to grainy for me. It is not satin smooth like the recipe for "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze". the best thing about it is the ingredients are common and I always have them on hand. It's just not smooth enough for me.

The flavor is great, but the texture is a bit grainy once it sets up. I'd like to find something a bit smoother/thinner.

I used 3 oz bakers unsweetened dark chocolate, 3 TB light corn syrup and 4 artificial sweeteners. I microwaved on 50% power for 45 seconds and then stirred. I repeated; stirring every 20 seconds for another minute. Very smooth and tasty. Next time I will make sure I have chocolate chips in the pantry. Definitely easy, tasty glaze.

This is a delicious, very easy alternative to using store-bought frosting.  It pours wonderfully over a bundt cake, or any type of dessert of pastry you are making.  Tastes divine.  This has won its way as my go-to chocolate glaze.

I use this on top of bunt cakes. It cascades down and gives a beautiful effect. The flavour of this glaze is smooth chocolate and not overpowering or waxy. My go to glaze for years :).

I usually botch stuff :(  But THIS?  This I could handle!  It was very tasty.  I have some wonderful vanilla that I "remembered wrong" the amount and used 1 full teaspoon!! (see? I tend to botch) It was still fabulous!  Lucky lucky me I even had some fresh strawberries to use to clean the pan with after I glazed a chocolate bundt cake! PS.. It did seem thicker than I imagined for a something called a "glaze"

It's ok, but I've found better.  I have tried this with milk chocolate chips to get a sweeter glaze.  BIG mistake - don't do it! - I ended up with the grainy, sludgy, clumpy mess that other reviewers were talking about.  If you make the recipe as written, you  do end up with a smooth, satiny glaze...  But beware that it dries MATTE.  It does not dry shiny and satiny.  This is why I gave it 3 stars.

I just used this glaze recipe today and think it is excellent!!  I glazed a chocolate bundt cake, added chocolate chips to top of glaze.  I found the texture and the flavor much to my liking…..and there was the perfect amount of frosting for my cake!!  I put it in my permanent file.

I loved this recipe and didn't find it gritty at all, but smooth and silky. I used it for the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe found on this site. People raved about it and wanted the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Ohhhh, was this heavenly.  Tasty and beautiful, with that perfect shine I was looking for as a donut glaze.  I made my first batch in the microwave, and it was awful.  The second batch was made as directed, and it came out perfectly.  I am a cooking newbie, so I better just stick to the directions.  :-)

Absolutely loved it! Made it in the microwave and it came out perfectly. I used it on the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site as well and it was so good! No one ate the other desserts Christmas Eve, this was almost gone! The cake was so moist and the glaze was just the perfect for it. I will make this again, I'm sure.

This also makes an amazing dip--just keep it warm as in a candy melter/small crock.  Any little munchie tastes fabulous dipped in this! Pretzels are a fav, but cookies, chips, fruits, all work well.  Make sure your fruits/pieces are dry before dipping. I've already made this several times and always got raves.

I added 1 tbsp of butter and glaze was perfectly smooth. I also gave the cake a little jiggle after pouring on the glaze to get that satin look.  It looks gorgeous and tasted even better. Very rich chocolate flavor, not too sweet.

It's just as the title says:  shiny and satiny.  Made it over a double boiler and I was afraid it would be too thin and runny, but it firms up nicely as it drips down the bundt cake and cools.  And actually it started to firm up on the cold spoon I was using to drizzle it on the cake! Turns a plain-looking bundt cake into a sinful-looking, beautiful dessert.

I made it in just mins... it was so easy. I did the microwave suggestion that other reveiws had mentioned. It was a bitter sweet glaze, not my thing. I'll try it with milk chocolate, or even white chocolate chips. Maybe the mint ones in christmas? This quick recipe could have a lot of fun with it. Thank you!

What can I say? Four ingredients and about one minute in the microwave (in 30 second intervals), followed by a little stirring... if you're quick in the kitchen, you can have your Bundt cake dripping with shiny, chocolatey goodness in about 5 minutes.  I'm slow and did half the work with a toddler on my hip, and it still barely took me any longer than that.  My go-to topping for the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe, also on this site.  Want to make friends and influence people?  Look no further.

Added a little more corn syrup to produce a glaze that poured well. No issues microwaving it 20 seconds at a time until smooth. Poured it onto the cake about 20 minutes before serving so it was still warm and gooey when we ate it, and it had a nice, rich texture. I used high quality chocolate chips and the flavor is definitely semi-sweet chocolate, pretty intense, I felt like it was balanced out well with the sweet fluffy yellow box mix cake I poured it over. I will make this again when I don't have cream for true ganache.

Will never use this recipe again.  The flavor was good, but, it is definitely not "satiny".  Be very careful if you microwave to melt.  Even though I reduced the time, knowing that all microwaves cook at different temp levels, the recipe started to seize and it was a mess.

Wasn't outstanding in my opinion. Good, but mainly just average. Very basic.

I did not have any Karo or any honey for that matter. So I added some regular pancake syrup and it turned out just as well.  My husband liked it anyway! It is quite thick though.  I think next time I will use less chocolate or maybe more of something else to adjust the thickness.

Used on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III.  Made a double layer cake and covered both layers with it and refrigerated.  Perfect.  Also, I doubled this recipe to cover the whole cake - both layers.

I made this glaze today for a simple chocolate cake. A few adjustments: I used a microwave, stirring every 30 seconds or so, I forgot the vanilla, and I added about 4 Tb of smooth peanut butter. DELICIOUS! Totally made the cake, and so easy!!

It's pretty good, though I messed mine up. I used more butter than recommended and forgot the vanilla. It still turned out great. It was very thick and would cover an entire 13x9 inch cake. To those who couldn't get the butter in, just keep stirring. It takes a little while, but if you stir it enough, assuming everything is melted, then it will come together into a wonderful dark glaze.

It has a good flavor, though I did make some adjustments, so I'm not sure how the original would taste. I wanted plenty of glaze, so I used 2 squares of bittersweet baking chocolate and the semi-sweet chocolate chips and increased the corn syrup a bit.  The microwave worked really well for melting, at 20 - 30 second intervals.  It has a beautiful satiny sheen to it and tastes great!

I'm rating this a 5 because I was told it was great as is, but I caution you it has a strong chocolate flavor. However in the future I will be using milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. You also have to take it straight from the stove and pour over your cake or it will start to harden and become what others have described as lumpy.

I used this for the cream filled cupcakes elsewhere on this site. It was outstanding and would make a great ice cream fudge topping as well! I microwaved as others suggested and added the vanilla at the end.

I like this recipe.  I also put all ingredients in a bowl and microwaved on high for about 60 seconds, then stirred until all the chips melted. Nice chocolate flavor.

It comes out really grainy and much to thick to be a glaze. It wouldn't even drip off the spoon much less drizzle over the cake. I ended up having to add water to it just to spead it on the cake.

I used this glaze on the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe on this site and it was the bomb!!  What a fantastic combination!  This glaze is rich and thick and very chocolatey.  Delicious!

This simple topping is perfect! It gets better the day after, if you can keep the chocolate fanatics from devouring it! I made a double batch and poured the extra inside my bundt... oh yeah, perfect chocolate fudge. My husband complimented my cake immediately, and without any persuasion. Super easy, and I had plenty of time to make it while the cake cooled. If you love thick, fudgy chocolate, you will not be disappointed. I used Hershey semisweet and the brand DOES matter to me.

This is the easiest glaze to make. I put it all, except the vanilla, in a 2 cup Pyrex measuring cup and then microwave it for up to 2 minutes. Watch it and when it boils, take it out, stir and and add the vanills. After it cools a bit, you can pour it over the cake. Perfect every time!

I didn't have semisweet chips so I used milk chocolate.  As others have suggested, I microwaved the ingredients instead of the double boiler method.  The taste was good but the appearance and texture was very grainy.  I don't know if this is due to the recipe or because I used a different kind of choc. chips (and they were a cheap brand).  Next time I try it, I'll use the recommended kind.

This is delicious! It glazed my cake so beautifully and I topped it with white chocolate chips for a wonderful contrast. I will definitely make again. There's no need for expensive tubes and canisters of frosting; this is all you need.

this glaze is AMAZING! i followed one of the recommendations of sticking it in the microwave instead of heating it over the stove and had great results.   i also was out of vanilla, so i substituted maple syrup. can't even tell the difference!

Tasted great! I used 4oz of bakers chocolate instead of chocolate chips.  I would have liked it slightly thinner though - any suggestions?

When I melted all the ingredients in the microwave and then tasted it, it just tasted like melted chocolate chips.  I thought it would taste like a ganache. However, after eating it on my chocolate cupcake the next day, it tasted a lot better.  Will make again!

This was really easy to make. It was very strong, maybe I'll try milk chocolate chips next time. I didn't feel that it made enough. I was able to just barely frost about 30 cupcakes with it. I would have liked a little bit more.

wow, this stuff is delicious. i doubled it and microwaved it and used it for the one bowl chocolate cake. almost too rich, but if that's what you're going for then this is what you want. it's not what i think of when i imagine a glaze, but if you spread thinly while still very very warm i imagine it might be more glaze-like. i will use this again.

Super easy and looked great on our coconut bundt cake.  We used Agave nectar instead of corn syrup and melted everything in the microwave.  We tried a first batch on the stove and ruined it.  The microwave worked perfect!

This glaze is absolutely perfect on the Too Much Chocolate Cake, and it looks like it is store bought. I use honey instead of the corn syrup though...

We really loved this recipe - so easy to make and a delicious flavor and great consistency. I doubled the recipe and used it for the one bowl chocolate cake recipe that's also on this site. They were a great combo. We'll definitely use this recipe again.

Very easy - but microwaved.  Made the chocolate chip bars and put it on about 2/3rds of it (not everyone wants more chocolate - go figure).  Children immediately started dunking strawberries in the little bit of leftovers.

i have made this twice and each time I have used cocoa.  Using cocoa makes it a bit lumpy and so i have taken it out and added a bit more corn syrup and beat it with a mixture.  This makes a nice satiny glaze that goes fabulously with the black magic cake found on this site.

SO incredibly easy and delicious.   I made it in the microwave as others had.  It took a total of less than 5 minutes to gather the ingredients, microwave them, stir, and frost.  Thanks for making life easier!

This was really good.  The only problem I had was that it did not make very much.  I made a double layer cake and it was only enough to spead in between the layers and not enough for the top or even the sides.  It had great flavor and texture but will double next time.

This was a 30 second melt in my microwave! Simple-And I only had regular pancake syrup and it was perfect. NOT thick like other people have suggested. It's perfect and doesn't take more than 30 minutes to harden up a bit. Still stays soft enough to be creamy though.

What a great recipe! The glaze hardened nicely over the cupcakes I made, yet stayed creamy tasting! No messy fingers, and the kids loved it! Definately a keeper. I microwaved it and it took no time at all.

I made this to top chocolate chip cupcakes for my boyfriend's birthday and it worked perfectly! He loved them. I don't have a double boiler so I just used the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between and it worked just fine.

Doubled the recipe for an oversized Tube Cake... used the microwave, it took 2 mins, stirred well with a wooden spatula, generous glaze on the top and coated the sides.   Very nice, very easy. Would have all the other uses mentioned by others...eclairs, donuts, etc.  Dipping sauce for fruits if you kept it warm.  Yum and EASY

Couldn't be easier.  I've been fussing all night with a glaze that requires melting down marshmallows, butter and milk and then requires the sifting of powdered sugar and cocoa powder.  I bought a bulk powdered sugar that isn't very good quality and causing my usual glaze to become lumpy, even after sifting.  This one was so simple, melted well, and glided right over the top of my cake and almost looks like a ganache as it hardens.

I use this chocolate glaze for many things:  cake, brownies, drizzled over sliced strawberries on cheesecake, .... endless possibilities!  It is so, so easy and tastes fantastic!  I put ingredients in a large glass measuring cup in the microwave for about 45 seconds, then stir until smooth.  Grand!

Thanks for the great recipe!  I followed other reviewer's tips and combined the chocolate chips, corn syrup, and butter in a pyrex measuing cup, melted them in the microwave for about 45 seconds, then added the vanilla.  I made this as the glaze for the Too Much Chocolate Cake on this site...what a great combination!  For a bundt cake size - you could even double the recipe if you want a lot of glaze!

This frosting saved the day - I made a bundt cake, a version I had never tried before but promised great things, and it turned out terribly dry. I drizzled this over the top the morning of as a "last ditch effort", and it turned out beautifully. Many compliments on the frosting alone - ha! Saved the day! Thanks!

Great, easy recipe.  I substituted local honey for the corn syrup (which was fine).  I went by the recipe other than that and found it tasted a lot like melted chocolate chips...so I added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup powdered sugar to sweeten things up.  This was AMAZING!  I drizzled it over Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe from this site :)

This was very creamy and good.  The next time I may add some extra sugar because I like things just a little sweeter. That's just a personal preference. This was very good on yellow bundt cake that had chocolate chips in it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this glaze to go on top of some cream puffs and it was awesome! I just used a microwave-safe dish to make this because I didn't want to mess with a double boiler. It was very easy. I microwaved on a lower power setting for about 45 seconds and then stired before heating for another 30 seconds. The only thing I might do different next time is add a little less corn syrup and maybe a little more butter because the glaze came out a bit thick and it was difficult to drizzle it neatly on top of my cream puffs.

Excellent! The batter will be very thin but the cake rises very well.  I used chopped walnuts in the batter.   I made a small amount of white frosting for between the layers: about 1+ cup of powder sugar, 3 tbls butter whipped together then adding 1 tsp of 1/2 and 1/2 or milk and add more as needed. Put layers together. Use "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" on the top.

I used this glaze over the  Chocolate Lovers Favorite Cake and it is amazing!  I did double the recipe, and used 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips though. It is a faovrite and will be made in our home many times and passed around to friends and family so they can enjoy it too!!!

Amazingly simple.  I was looking for something quick and easy to cover a chocolate cake.  WOWZA.  Thanks to the other reviewers who suggested honey because I  didn't have corn syrup and to the one that recommended the microwave.  Worked perfect 45 seconds. We absolutely loved this.  It made my cake look professional!

Even though I made a mistake and used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, I was thoroughly impressed with this glaze. Two of the cake eaters thought it was store bought. If you use milk chocolate chips, expect a very, very rich frosting taste. Oh, and I microwaved this and added the vanilla when it was all melted down.

I didnt really "try" this, just licked the spoon as was very good. I used this to top the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" on this site - with strawberries - and sent to work with my husand. 2 hours later the cake was gone and people were following him around asking for the recipe and saying how awesome it was. Will make again for sure, and eat some myself next time too! Side note - I did in microwave too, easy easy!

Turned out very well. I doubled recipe and made in the microwave. Will use milk chocolate chips next time though instead of semi-sweet to give it better frosting flavor.

i microwaved...turned out great.  everyone loved it.  but i was just using dark chocolate chips, not a "good chocolate".  if i were to use a fancy chocolate, i'd make this on the stove top.

Great chocolaty glaze. Next time I may add just a tad more corn syrup so it doesn't 'glob' when drizzling. I drizzled this on the edge of the German Sweet Chocolate Cake I, and it was a lovely addition.

Yum! I didn't have corn syrup so instead, I used 1 tbs sugar and 1/4 tbs water. It worked just fine! At the suggestion of others, I also made this in the microwave. I put it in for 30 seconds then stirred, another 30 seconds then stirred, then another 30 seconds and used a whisk to ensure the smooth texture.  This glaze was a bit thicker than I thought it would be and when it cooled on the cake, it was almost like a fudge consistency. Because it wasn't as thin as I thought it would be, it didn't quite trickle down to the bottom part of my cake but that's okay! It still tasted great and I'll definitely use this one again!

I made my own double boiler using an oven-safe glass bowl placed over a pot containing an inch or so of hot water.  It was easier than I expected and tasted great.  I used it with the Black Magic Cake recipe from this site.

Perfect and delicious! Very easy to make and it had a nice consistency. Poured over a yellow bundt cake and it make this boxed mix more "fancy". Great glaze that sets up nicely. Thanks!

This glaze is amazing. I used it on a box chocolate bundt cake made with applesauce instead of the oil and everyone raved about it.  This glaze is so easy to make yet so great. No one ever believes me when i pass on the recipe.

I took the advice of other reviews and warmed the chips and butter in the microwave. Then added the vanilla and syrup. This turned out great for such a quick fix. It doesn't quite set up firm, but this allowed it to seap into the cake, making it even more delicious! I used this on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III from this site and will be using this glaze again.

Excellent.  I glazed "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site and used Hershey's dark chocolate kisses.  It set nicely -firmed up yet wasn't hard -great texture and beautiful presentation!  No double boiler needed, just used a glass bowl resting on top of a pot of simmering water.  I'll try milk chocolate next.

Put this on top of "too much chocolate cake" from this site. super easy to make. Going to add butterscotch next time! Used a trick with a pot filled with water and a Pyrex bowl floated inside since I didn't have a double boiler. Worked perfect and I didn't need to go out an buy another gadget.

De-licious! I made to pour over a 9x13 marble cake. A nice thin layer was all that was needed-hardened up nicely and was just the right amount for my cake! I needed something without powdered sugar since we were out and this was the perfect substitution. Super easy- Thank you!

Delicious. It tastes like eating straight up chocolate chips. It wasn't what I was looking for (I wanted something to go with the dark/dutch cocoa chocolate cake, this felt more like something... I dunno, for a lighter chocolate cake!), but it was still crazy good. Cooled off and became thicker and still made for a fine icing rather than a thin glaze. So long as your pour it while warm, it will still drip over the sides like a glaze.

This is good stuff!  Easy to work with right out of the microwave it had the consistency of hot fudge and drizzled beautifully.  After setting up, it stayed soft, never getting stiff or crunchy.  A great go-to glaze for lots of uses.

Was the perfect glaze to go on my chocolate bundt cake that I made for Easter. I read the other reviews about it being like frosting but I don't think they let it melt long enough. It was prefect to drizzle and even set up hard so I could wrap the cake in saran wrap. I didn't have to alter the recipe at all.

Easy and quick using the microwave. I added a little water based on another recipe I had. Everyone loved it. Next time, I'll know to work faster at pouring it on the cake since it sets up so quickly.

I put this on the Chocolate Lover's Favorite Cake recipe from this site.  It was to die for!  I forgot to add the vanilla, but didn't miss it.  I had actually planned on adding almond extract to complement the flavor of the cake more.  It's a great recipe that I will use often.

Great, tasty frosting.  I added about 1/4 cup cocoa powder for more chocolate taste and a dash of salt and cinnamon.  It's easy to thin with more butter.  Oh, I used natural unfiltered honey 'cause I didn't have corn syrup or standard honey, and it tasted pretty funky.  Use the processed stuff.

Yummy! Delish! And super easy. I used the microwave as suggested. Heated 45 sec and stirred till smooth! It does come out more toward the frosting end in texture, not a glaze- but that did not bother me...and it taste so good, who cares!!

Like the other reviewers, I heated this in the microwave for 45 seconds.  My microwave tends to take a long time to cook things, but when I took this out I was afraid I may have heated it too long!  I'd suggest trying for 30 or 35 seconds, stirring, then seeing if it needs to go in for longer because you don't want your chocolate to seize.

Perfect amount to pour over a bundt cake. Used microwave directions--perfect.  It drizzed half way down the sides and looked so amazing.  Next time I may try it with sweeter chocolate chips or another flavor chips--It's great

WOW! This rocks!  Like other readers, I used a Pyrex measuring cup in the microwave instead of the double boiler. Put it in the microwave for 45 sec, stir, then 45 sec, stir, etc until the mixture has melted. I poured this over the recipe Too Much Chocolate Cake and it was to die for!!!

Decadent, like a dark chocolate ganache you'd get at a good restaurant. I also microwaved this and it came out great. I used it on the devils food cupcakes from this site and the cream filling from this site. Absolutely wonderful!

Couldn't be eaiser! I don't have a double boiler so I just stir this in a metal mixing bowl over a sauce pan filled with boiling water. I hold onto it with a hot-pad. Turned out perfect and went DELICIOUSLY with "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site.

Turned out exactly as expected. Not too thin, but I wouldn't call this a frosting. Perfect for dipping donuts or cupcakes, or drizzling over cakes. I was out of corn syrup, so had to sub honey. Tasted great, but will get corn syrup for next time to see the difference if any. Thanks!

This was just okay. It shouldn't really be called a "glaze" because this turned out to be a spreadably thick frosting. I'm not sure if I did something wrong- I did microwave instead of do the stove because we were short on time. However, the cake I put it on was extremely rich, so I think next time I will stick with a different recipe. 3 stars for easy to make, but not true to it's name

It was great tasting.  I mixed dark chocolate chips with milk chocolate.  I rated at only 4 stars because it isn't really thin like I would have expected with a glaze.  It's thicker, but hardens to a nice consistency.

This recipe is so simple! I don't have a double boiler either; but, don't prefer microwaved things. So, I took a pyrex bowl and set it on top of a pan. It always works fine. I also doubled the recipe for a larger molded cake. It wasn't a thin frosting that revealed the intricacy of the cake. But, the frosting accumulated in the recesses and made nice extra-chocolaty bits. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this using 50% cocoa chocolate. I used the microwave method that a previous reviewer posted.  It turned out extremely well, but I wanted it to be a bit thinner of a consistency, so I added two tablespoons of heavy whipping cream, as well as a TINY pinch of salt.  It turned out delicious!

I like to follow what reviewers say so I put this on the "too much chocolate cake" from this site.  By my not being a big chocolate fan I figured it would be too much chocolate but was making it for my hubby and daughter cause they can't get too much chocolate.  It was a big hit.  Even I loved it.  Going to add some chopped walnuts to the glaze and maybe the cake next time.  Thanks for sharing.

Dark chocolate taste for certain.  I'm not a huge fan of dark chocolate so that is why I am rating as a 3 star.  It was also much thicker than I expected it to be.

This was yummy. I even forgot to put the vanilla in and still loved it. I microwaved everything for 30 seconds, then stirred it and poured it on the cake. Perfect!

this glaze is perfect! I used it on my cupcakes. I was afraid it would be all runny, so I put the glaze in the fridge (even if some reviewers recommended not to do so) for about 15 minutes and it was absolutely delicious with the cupcakes! And it took me about 1 minute to make this chocolate glaze, the easiest frosting/glaze I have ever made! Thanks a lot for the recipe :)

I microwaved it, like others said, and it was wonderful. Also, I used salted butter - the little bit of salt in the butter adds that much more flavor.

Perfect chocolate glaze for a bundt cake.  I just tossed everything into a bowl, microwaved for 1 minute and whipped it up with a wisk!  Poured on top of the Pumpkin Gingerbread recipe from this site - I make two bundt cakes out of the PG recipe - and I wanted to make the second one a bit different by adding the glaze!  Delicious!  Try them both!

Excellent topping for a decadent cake.  I doubled the recipe and microwaved like other reviews said to do.  This took me a total of 45 seconds to make.  Awesome!  Very good stuff.  It set quite nicely for me.  Thank you for this really good, easy to make recipe!

Good not great.  Like other reviewers have commented, it's really not a "glaze" - more of a frosting as it is thick.  Also, not that it needs to be, but not "satiny" like the name implies.

This was FANTASTIC.  As other reviewers recommended, I microwaved this in 30 second increments and it took no time at all to make.  It was delicious over the Too Much Chocolate Cake (also from this site).  Both were so easy to make and it was delicious!  This is a keeper!

Absolutely perfect!  I made it in the microwave as the other reviews suggested which made this so quick and esay.  I made it for Lisa's Chocolate Chip Cake - brought it to a picnic and the cake was gone before I could get a slice.  I did manage to get a bite from my daughter's plate though.  It was amazing!  

This was probably one of the easiest desserts I've made in a long time - and everyone thought I had slaved in the kitchen for hours!!

I really enjoyed the texture and flavor of this glaze when it was warm, and I drizzled it on top of the cake; however, after a day or two, it just wasn't as good. I probably won't use it again unless I keep it separate to warm before adding it to the cake.

This recipe was extremely simple and delicous.  I followed others advise and made it in the microwave, it made it almost too easy.  I used it on top of the too much chocolate cake recipe from this site and it went with it perfectly.  Will definately be making it again.

This is quick, easy and best of all, a delicious chocolate glaze.  I've tried them all, and this is simply the best! I don't bother with a double boiler, it works great in the microwave.

This really IS the best. I used Mrs Buttersworth as it is less expensive and has an extra depth of flavor than plain corn syrup.This is great!

I was looking for a chocolate icing recipe for a small 9" round cake I made that didn't have a ton of icing sugar. This was just perfect, so easy to make in the microwave and the right amount for a small cake. Perfect when you need a quick chocolate fix!!!

Experiment with different temperatures to get the thickness and the dripping that you like.

So easy!  I microwaved the glaze as other's had suggested and in less than a minute I had a shiny, tasty glaze to pour over my bundt cake.  The consistency is perfect.  The shiny glaze makes for a beautiful presentation.

This glaze has a great flavor, but was very thick. I will use this recipe again, but will add extra corn syrup to thin it a bit. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I used this on my Easter bunny chocolate cake that I made from in a mold.  Worked out great and tasted even better.  I frosted the cake a day ahead so that it would set up nicely.  Then I put the bunny on a pedestal cake plate surrounded by green tinted coconut and dotted with jelly eggs.  It made a great centerpiece for my table.  Everyone was very impressed.  Thanks!

Very good! I accidentally forgot the vanilla, but it still tastes YUMMY on a chocolate bundt cake.  I bet it would be even better with the vanilla. :-)  I microwaved everything for 45 seconds, stirred, and all was melted. It didn't need any more. Beautiful presentation!

awesome!  I also put this with the Too chocolatey cake and it was a beautiful addition.  Everyone kept telling me how gourmet everything looked.  :)  And tasty as well.  Mine hardened on the ice cream but I served it right off the stove onto the cake so not much setting time.  Delicious... will make again and again!

Wonderful! I had company coming over for dinner and used this recipe at the last minute after my frosting failed to perform!
I also used the microwave, threw everything in a pyrex measuring cup and stirred after every 30 seconds until smooth. Yummy!

Lovely!
I used this to frost a birthday cake, so I doubled the ingredients and I also added a little bit of almond extract, which gave a wonderful flavor.
Thank you!

Use the microwave! Just make sure to only put in for about 20 seconds at a time and stir thoroughly.  Otherwise you will scorch the chocolate.  DELICIOUS!!  I used it on "Too Much Chocolate Cake" but I think I will also use it on the zucchini cake as previously suggested.

Just perfect!  I used this to glaze Too Much Chocolate cake from this site.  I forgot to add the vanilla but did not miss it at all.  I used the microwave to melt the chocolate, and it worked perfectly.

Very good and easy to make. I microwaved for 45 seconds per other reviews and it was perfect. I put this on brownies but I think I would like to try it on a bundt cake.

This glaze was really easy to make. I followed everyone's suggestions and used the microwave instead - 45 seconds was perfect. I combined all ingredients except the vanilla extract (I added that at the end). The glaze went perfectly with the chocolate bundt cake that I made. I would definitely make this again.

This is the best glaze I've ever tried. I don't have a double boiler so I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave instead. I used this glaze in Chocolate Lover's Favorite Cake and Chcoclate Cavity Maker Cake from this site. This will be the glaze I use from now on.

tastes wonderful, however, mine doesn't seem to set. I glazed my doughnuts and I'm a bit worried it might stay gooey. I substituted the butter for yoghurt. Can that be the problem?

Awesome!  I used mini semi-sweet morsels just because I had them on hand - so they melted a little faster.  Perfect over the 'Two Much Chocolate Cake' from this site.  Great tip to first spray measuring spoon with cooking spray before measuring out corn syrup... it slides right out!

Very good flavor. A little thick, but I think I could add a tiny bit of milk next time. I liked it a lot better than glazes that just use (and taste like) powdered sugar. It was a hit on the chocolate cake I made for Father's Day (from this site). I'll use this again and again.

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I put it in the microwave instead of the broiler, and it came out awesome!  Super shiny, just the right amount of sweet, and so easy!  This was for a glaze on a chocolate bundt cake, but there was enough left over to dip some strawberries in.

Great glaze! I used it on a chocolate bundt cake I made (left out the sour cream by accident, so it wasn't very good), and it looked and tasted wonderful.  It saved my not-so-great cake.

This is the perfect glaze for everything! I've used it on cakes, as a thin alternative to frosting between layers, for more elegant cupcakes, and even drizzled on mocha chocolate chip muffins and bread! It's so pretty and at Thanksgiving I got asked repeatedly for the recipe. Three women told me "I don't usually like frosting but this was just perfect"!!

I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate because one of the people at the potluck didn't like chocolate.  I put some of the glaze over chocolate cake and some over vanilla icecream.  everyone loved it.

This is delicious and pretty - I just found it a bit on the hard side. I'm trying to figure out a way to get it a bit creamier.

Excellent. Thanks. I agree, it is too thick to drizzle, so I added a tablespoon and a half of Coffee Liqueur and drizzled it on the Cavity Maker Cake. Yummm!

Great glaze..Unfortunately the cake(chocolate cavity maker) I had put it on wasn't very good but I was glad I had the chocolate glaze to make up for the loss.  Will def make again and again for I'm always trying out new chocolate cakes.  And next time I will just throw all the ingredients in bowl and microwave-much easier.

The name says it all.  This is so satiny and delicious.  I drizzled it on the chocolate cavity maker cake on this site.  Use the mini chocolate chips and melt them in the microwave.  It is so much easier.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

It was difficult to rate this as written.  The taste and consistency definitely rate a 5+ - it doesn't harden, but doesn't run all over the place either.  It gets a 3, however, for unnecessarily complicated preparation - I made it in a double boiler and also microwaved it (30 seconds, stir, 30 seconds, done) in a Pyrex measuring cup.  There wasn't a difference in taste or texture at all, but the microwave method was a lot faster and easier, plus the measuring cup had the built-in pouring spout.  So I figured that averaged to a 4.  The microwaved version is a keeper!  Thanks, Ginger!

This tasted good but it was more of an icing than a glaze.  I followed the ingredients exactly and microwaved for 60 seconds, then stirred.

I used this glaze to top mini double chocolate bundt cakes.  It was waaaay better than anything at Starbucks.  Looked wonderful.  I then make used this glaze to top my homemade "Hostess" cream-filled cupcakes.  My husband and son are fighting over the treats.  I wasn't allowed to share any with our neighbors!

Outstanding! Made this to go with "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site. Just melted everything in the microwave. Stirred well and added vanilla. This was perfect! I didn't have trouble with it being too thick as other reviewers had, I think because I zapped this in the microwave. This is very delicious! I will use this again and again! Thank you!

Very easy and good recipe! I melted the chocolate in the microwave so it took no time. I used the glaze over a chocolate chip bundt cake. The next day when I went to have a cold slice the glaze on the chocolate reminded me of a ding dong. Yummy.

This is a great chocolate glaze.  I drizzled it over chocolate bundt cake and not only does it look lovely but tastes fantastic as well.

Delicious!  I used it to top a chocolate cake recipe I got on here as well!  It draped the cake well for a beautiful presentation!

This went very well with my german chocolate cake. I used the traditionall frosting inside but frosted the top with the glaze and it worked well. This was definantly thicker than expected- to me a glaze should be a thinner consistancy like the glaze used on doughnuts- but it tastes good and thats what matter most right!?!?

Wow, I just put this glaze on a bundt cake and it was so easy to make and apply!  It's texture was silky - not at all runny.  The flavor and sweetness are just right.  I will definitely make again!
