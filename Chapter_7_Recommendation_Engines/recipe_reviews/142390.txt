Great alternative to the overly sweet sweetpotato dishes!  I do suggest that you do not waste time in roasting the potatoes - way too much time and effort.


If you have a pot with a steam basket, try this: 

Fill pot with water (up to about 2 inches below basket) & start heating it up on the stove.  While your water is heating, peel and cut your potatoes into pieces - as uniform as possible - so it cooks evenly.  By the time you are done prepping, the water should be just about boiling.  Just fill up the basket with your potatoes and place the lid on.  It took me about 10 minutes to steam mine, because I cut it into about 1/2 inch squares.  You will be able to tell when they are tender enough to mash in the processor and you don't have to wait for them to cool down like you would with baking!  Makes the whole first step take about 20 minutes, versus 90+.

I also added about a dozen drops of red pepper sauce (tapatio or you could use tabasco) - not enough to make it spicy, just to impart more depth to the flavor.

I also dislike the all-too sweet and rich yam casseroles.  This was a wonderful and healthy change of pace! I wrapped the potatoes in foil and put them in the oven while my turkey was baking.  After taking out and resting the turkey, I popped the casserole into the oven to bake, making this so convenient to make and not taking up oven space.  I loved the subtle sweetness and the blend of flavor with the orange and ginger.  I did add some candied ginger to the food processing of ingredients and liked that alot.  With the addition of the egg, this puffed up nicely.  The crunch of the roasted pecan added wonderful flavor and texture.  I was tempted to sub out some of the oj for some bourbon but I decided I will try that next time.  I love sweet potatoes with a holiday meal but up to this point I usually baked them because of being so turned off by 'dessert casseroles'.  One could add honey if the sweet potato was not sweet enough.  *I also used fat free plus milk, which is skim but has the taste and appearance of 2%.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

I made this casserole for Thanksgiving and highly recommend it. I dislike over-sweetened sweet potatoes on the dinner table (too much like dessert). This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. It is similar to the old, standard combination of sweet potatoes and orange juice, but has some added body from the eggs and milk. I used the juice and zest from two whole oranges and the casserole had a nice, orangy flavor. Next time I might add more ginger, as I didn't taste that much.

The 4 star review is for the recipe, not the dish. I followed the recipe exactly, and I think it has a lot of unneccessities that could be removed to streamline it. For instance, when the potatoes came out after they were roasted the great roasted flavor ws there, but after mashing them with eggs, oj, and rebaking, it left so I think even microwaving it instead of roasting would make no difference to cut down on the time. Additionally, I don't feel the egg made any contribution. The sweet potatoes didn't taste any different or puff up for me...so I think they could have been omitted. And the ginger could be tripled at least to make it come out more( candied ginger sounds like a great idea) I'm a sweet potato freak, but I always only eat it plain with a little coconut or spicy onions and so I was expecting my first casserole to taste vastly different, but this was nice, subtly orange, mashed sweet potatoes. I love the orange flavor...in the morning, topped with leftover cranberry sauce...fabulous breakfast:) Oh, and I eat it cold...orange flavor's much more pronounced. I tried it few other ways...with butter( didn't like that) and with plain yogurt and a drizzle of molasses. Molasses was unnecessary, but the yogurt was very good with the potatoes...but then again, I'm a plain yogurt freak;)

Thanks for a lower-calorie alternative!  My quick tip?  Microwave the sweet potatos, let them cool a few minutes, and the potatos "shrink" from the skin, making peeling a breeze. Also, I whip my potatoes rather than put in the blender--gives a little more body.

This was the best recipe that I have ever made off of this website. It was AWESOME! I made this for THanksgiving with my family yesterday and it was a HUGE hit. I did make one adjustment. I doubled the Ginger, it was perfect as my family really likes the flavor of it.

This is a keeper! I have never liked the traditional candied sweet potatoes. All the sweet potato recipes I have tried are way too sweet. This is so much better! I didnt like the idea of milk and orange juice together so I used 3Tbs of butter instead. I used 2 large sweet potatoes and kept the amounts of everything else the same.  I used the whip with my stand mixer instead of a food processor. I served this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. Most of us agreed that leaving off the pecans would be better, but that is just a personal preference.

This was a great, healthy alternative to the regular sweet potato casseroles that are loaded with sugar. Since I made it just for me I used two cups of sweet potatoes and then kind of guessed on the quantities of the rest of the ingredients. I think it was even better the next day. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!!!

I took these to Thanksgiving dinner and they were a real hit!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using a whole egg instead of two yolks, and I used 2 tablespoons of ginger.  Really delicious.

Everyone at the Thankgiving table loved it. It went very well with cranberry sauce. I did add a little cinnamon to it and sprinkled the top with Spenda brown sugar along with the pecans.

It wowed everyone on Thanksgiving, and it was the first left-over to disappear from the fridge. Full of real flavor, not just sugary-sweetness.

I don't like sweet potatoes...never have...never thought I would. I only make them on Thanksgiving because of "tradition" and I usually end up throwing most of them out. These were wonderful.  I actually ate them and liked it!  The whole casserole disappeared.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe, but I just wasn't happy with the result.  It tasted like an orange creamsicle to me.  Others at the table were happy with it, but I think it needed nutmeg, allspice, or cinnamon.  It was way too orange for my taste.

Like others, I'm amazed there aren't more reviews!  This is excellent, classy, and easy to make.  I make it in advance and then just bake it for 45" or so before serving.  I used one egg, no milk, a little more orange juice, about double the amount of ginger and added some pecans on the top.  I also just mashed the sweet potatoes...forget the baking, cooling, peeling routine.

I prefer the sweeter version of sweet potatoes, but this was a good alternative. I added about 2 tablespoons of half & half to make it creamier, and used more OJ than written. I also added extra ginger powder and about a tablespoon of red pepper powder because it seemed like it was very plain. I used a potato masher to smash the mixture, and cooked the potatoes in the microwave. Much easier than the oven and a blender.

Wonderful dish added to our Thanksgiving meal. Since you ask about changes I will be adding some brown sugar or maple syrup.  My son-in-law devoured the casserole.  It’s a great dish and just love the ginger and orange zest flavors !!!

I make this for Thanksgiving with the hopes it would be a good alternative to the sickening sweet casseroles that are so prevalent. I liked the flavor of the ginger and the orange, yet somehow the end result wasn't satisfying and both my husband and I thought it needed "something" although we couldn't decide what.
