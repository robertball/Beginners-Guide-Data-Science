I altered this a bit, but it was wonderful!  I cheated and used a pre-made Nilla Wafer crust.  Because I had tons of peaches and plums on hand, I simply sliced these thinly and used them on top.  Great flavor, light and creamy!
Oh, I also added a dash of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture for just a tad more flavor...

Very tasty.  I found that the filling barely filled up the pie crust, I plan to double it next time.  I will definitely make it again!

All I really used from this recipe was the cream cheese mixture, put it into a graham cracker crust, piled frozen blueberries, strawberries and raspberries into it.  For a delicious flair pomegranate was added and my husband loved it!  Don't forget tons of cool whip on top!  Good basic recipe.

Wasn't really a huge fan of the pie crust as the "pizza dough".  Tried using a sugar cookie dough and was much better.  I did like the cream cheese spread after adding just a touch of vanilla to it.

Great recipe! I made it again but instead of the pastry bottom I used 1 pkg.of sugar cookie dough. Rolled it out and baked that, and for the filling I used 1 8oz. pkg. cream cheese and 1 8 oz. tub of whip cream and creamed them together, spread that over the cooled cookie dough and then put fruit on top.

I have done this twice, first time I used a normal pie plate, but didn't think there was enough cream cheese filling, but my guests really enjoyed it. The 2nd time I made tarts and put some dream whip in with the cream cheese, I did prefer it this way better. This is a quick and easy dessert for a hot summer day.

This is the easiest cheese cake recipe I have ever used. I was REALLY concerned that it wasn't going to really taste like cheese cake. I didn't use the fruit on top and like other reviewers stated made double the cream cheese part of the recipe, and added 1tsp of vanilla. My husband who is the cheese cake lover in the household LOVED it. I was totally shocked. He keeps asking me over and over to make it again. Thanks Lucy.

I made this pie for a very special dinner and it came out perfect!!! It was an easy recipe and with summer so close I found all the beautiful fruit that I could want.  My husband and guests RAVED about this fruit pie.  He told me it was the best pie he had ever had! I was so nervous I forgot the whipped cream but no one knew and it was still fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe!

We call this "fruit pizza" and use sugar cookie dough rolled out instead of a pie crust.  Super easy and always a hit!

With Pet Ritz pie crust, this came out great.  I have made this with the sugar cookie dough but I had one Pet Ritz 9" pie crust in the freezer and wanted to use it.  So I let it thaw, pressed it flat on my pizza stone and baked it.  I only needed to use 3/4 of the Philly cream cheese because the pie was small. I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla flavoring. I covered it with local strawberries, blueberries and peaches and then glazed with apricot jam thinned with a smidge of water.  It came out great.  (See my photos under Apricot20)  I think I like this better than the sugar cookie dough!  I gave it 4 stars but with a fruit glaze, it becomes 5 stars in my book.  The pie crust, after baking and refrigeration, tasted like Christmas butter cookie dough and the decorative edging gave it a finished look.  Thanks for this recipe.  It IS fun, summery, and easy.  A keeper for me!

This is also really good with a pre-cooked crescent roll "crust" or one of those Betty Crocker sugar cookie mixes made into a crust, though you'll want to double the filling and fruit ingredients if you choose to do a whole cookie sheet full. It's really quick and easy to make and everyone always loves it. Sometimes, if I have time, I toast coconut and sprinkle it over the top. It's a nice base recipe that you can bend and make it your own.

This is excellent but there is NO WAY the one 8 oz. cream cheese covers that much pie crust (or cookie dough which is what I used).

Love this recipe, but I always use sugar cookie mix for the dough.  I don't think I would enjoy it at all with a pastry crust, but maybe graham cracker.

It's a tasty recipe but not for a poolside party nor a hot, summer night unless you have this sitting in an ice bath or kept in the fridge until ready to serve.  The cream cheese softens in the heat and starts to mush up the crust.

Made this tonight.  Used sugar cookie dough as others recommended. Made it in a pie plate.  Definately needed 2-8oz. pkgs. cream cheese. Tweaked filling a little.  To 2 pkgs. cream cheese, I added 1/2 cup sugar, 3/4 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon lemon juice.  Topped with sliced fresh strawberries and kiwi.  It was fantastic!!  Will definately be making this again.  Going to try graham cracker crust next time.  Thanks.

I love this recipe! I did make one change though, and used a refrigerated pie crust instead of frozen. It was much easier. Just roll it onto a cookie sheet and bake....easy! It is so light and fresh tasting, but I think it tasted more like a pastry then a desert. I have no problem letting my son eat this for breakfast....its a great way for him to get his fruit!

This was a light and very fresh pie if you really enjoy fruit. I did the recommended amount of cream cheese filling and just pilled on as much fruit as possible.

Easiest cheesecake ever. I wanted a recipe to use up an excess of oranges. This is it. I added vanilla and orange rind to the cream cheese and only added chopped oranges to the top. Also, I didn't flatten the pastry.

I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  I made it with a graham cracker crust out of personal preference but then followed the recipe exactly.  The filling does not go all the way up but I prefer it that way.  It is the perfect balance of sweetness for the fruit and the fruit covers it up so you don't even notice.  It was so simple to make and looks beautiful. I will definitely make it again!

I made this over the weekend and it was a BIG hit and was eaten all in one night!  I did double the recipe for the cream cheese and sugar, and had a bit of difficulty in getting all the fruit on one single layer, so I layered it a bit.  Definitely will make again.  It was fantastic!

Nice light pie. Good for after a BBQ :)
