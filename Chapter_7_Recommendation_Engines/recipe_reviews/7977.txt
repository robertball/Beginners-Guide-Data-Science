This is a fantastic cheesecake...very elegant and rich. I used crushed Oreos instead of chocolate chips and vanilla wafer crumbs on the crust, and the toasted hazelnuts added a perfect touch! I also chopped up some Ferrero Rocher candies and mixed them into the batter before baking. Rave Reviews!!!

I wavered between giving this recipe 4 stars or 5.  Overall the cheesecake turned out fabulous and everyone loved it! My biggest problem with it is that there was too much semi-sweet chocolate flavor and not enough hazelnut.  If I make it again, i will not put the chocolate chips in the crust like it calls for.  Something else I was annoyed with was the amount of work I had to put into it (and normally I love a challenge).  Just make sure you have a food processor or blender before you start (as a college student, I don't have either of those luxeries so I had to crush all of the chocolate chips by hand which was redundant).  
Well, i focused so much on the negatives, that, i don't want to leave out any other positives.  The cheesecake itself is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous when it is all done.  However, instead of dipping hazelnuts into chocolate for the topping, i simply put the chocolate/sourcream mixtre on top of the cake and then sprinkled it with toasted hazelnuts.  The taste was outstanding and the texture was great.  Overall, I was very pleased...I will keep this one in mind for the future.

Be warned, everyone will think you had this cake professionally made. It's very easy to make and everyone absolutely loved it. I recommend using a blender for all crushing. I already have three more orders for this cake.

Great cheesecake. I had some fun, and used milk chocolate in the crust, semisweet chocolate in the filling and the glaze, and then drizzled it with dark chocolate. Check out the picture, it turned out great. I more than doubled the recipe, and made one 9" and one 10". The crust was a liitle tough to get to stick up the sides of the pan, but with a little work, I got it to stick. After it was cooked, it stayed up fine. I made this for an auction for the Young women's program at church. I'll let you know how much it went for.(I kept the 10" for my Dad's birthday party).

If you have never made a cheesecake, this is a great recipe for you! It doesn't require the daunting "water bath" that most cheesecakes require.  I'm giving it a 5 because of the fairly easy preparation (okay, the crust was time consuming and I didn't dip the hazelnuts in chocolate for the top), the great presentation (this looks fabulous and expensive), and the *delicious* flavor.  BUT, I must admit it didn't quite taste the rich hazelnutty way I expected.  I crumbled a chocolate hazelnut bar on the top and when I tasted a piece of the bar I realized that was the flavor I was hoping for (like Nutella) but the hazelnut liqueur just wasn't able to give it that flavor.  Next time I might spread Nutella across it the top instead of the chocolate/hazelnut liqueur mixture.  All that said, I still think this is a fantastic cheesecake and it is definitely worth trying if this is your first attempt at cheesecake!

When I make it again, I'm probably going to use mini chocolate chips rather than bothering to chop up the larger ones.  Other than that, a great recipe!

This cheesecake is average. First, the chocolate topping completely overwhelms the cheesecake itself. Second, the cheesecake part is really kind of meh, it's on the softer side and I don't really feel that putting in "chipped chocolate" really adds to it. In the end it just feels like a big chocolate, sugary mess in your mouth w/ a bit of cheesecake flavor towards the end. The hazelnut flavor gets lost in the chocolate as well. I won't make it again.

I made this for a dessert contest at work.  Only homemade desserts were allowed in the competion. I was so upset when I didn't win and later when I asked the judges why I didn't win or even place they said they skipped mine because they thought it was store bought!  This is SO amazing and SO rich!  It's a little time consuming but WELL WORTH THE EFFORT!

Absolutely Fabulous. I really loved the crust (sans chocolate), I think I'll substitute this crust for any graham ones I come across. Besides omitting the chocolate from the crust, I also used Kalua instead of the hazelnut liqueur, and on top I just drizzled a chocolate glaze over chopped hazelnuts - mmm. I also used regular chocolate chips instead of the chopped, which I think was a mistake. Delicious and beautiful - Thanks!

This recipe is amazing! My first ever attempt at a cheesecake and it came out perfect and got rave reviews. I substituted the hazelnuts with Macadamia Nuts and even found a Macadamia Liqueur(made by Trader Vic's) to use. Based on the fact that many people had substituted the way the crust was done, I also changed it by using Nabisco Chocolate Wafers instead of the chocolate chips and vanilla wafers. All the steps involved are well worth it! Many people will not believe that you actually made this cheesecake from scratch. I have a feeling this one will get requested many, many times.

This was very good - like a Nutella cheesecake.  I took the advice of another reviewer and left the chocolate out of the crust and just added a bit more to the cheesecake itself.  I bought a block of Ghirardelli chocolate and chopped that into small pieces, instead of using chips.  I couldn't find any Frangelico, so I substituted a Chocolate Hazelnut liqueur and it turned out very well.  Lots of compliments.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! Unfortunately I had to make a couple substitutions because my local grocers carried neither hazelnuts or hazelnut liquor. I used walnuts and hazelnut flavoring syrup. I added a dash of the syrup to the crust to help the walnuts pretend to be hazelnuts lol.

After making this recipe and reading the reviews about people who changed the crust, I can't see why. The only problem I had with the crust was it's somewhat dryness but I loved the chocolate/'nilla wafer blend, it looked beautiful and tasted great, I think people who leave out the chocolate or use cookies instead will just end up with a rather sucky crust.

My only recommendation for people using this recipe is to make sure the chocolate chips you mix in the actual cheesecake itself are finely chopped in a blender. The parts of my cake that didn't get much chocolate from the coarse chop, didn't have much flavor compared to the parts that did so it was kind of unbalanced. I would add a little tiny bit of cocoa powder to the mix to help evenly distribute the chocolatey flavor.

This was quite easy and I even got rave reviews from those who don't like cheesecake! Looked great without spreading chocolate on the sides, just let it trickle down.  I am new to baking and here are a couple things I learned ... 1)line the spring form pan with parchment paper, something leaked and caused a mess, possibly why the crust was so firm 2)couldn't find the required hazelnuts so it takes about an hour to peel enough for the recipe (quick soak in HOT water is essential).  Definitely making this one again!

This cheesecake was sensational!  I was able to serve 20 people with one cake since it is so rich so it's great for a group.  Also, I made the cheesecake ahead except for the topping and froze it.  I then thawed it in the fridge for a day and made the topping the day I served it.  A huge time savor and the texture/taste were as if I had made it that day!

This recipe is delicious.  I have made it several times and everyone devours it!  Many have asked me for the recipe.  Just a few variations: I use milk chocolate chips, I prefer them to semi-sweet.  And I don't use whole hazelnuts, so I skip the part of dipping them to garnish the cake.  I simply sprinkle some crushed hazelnuts on top of the chocolate glaze.  I highly recommended this recipe!

I love this website!! I really enjoyed making this cheesecake its quite simple. I did modify the cake somewhat. I excluded the semi chocolate chips from the cheesecake mixture and added 1-2 tablespoons of the hazelnut liqueur. (You can taste it to your liking).
I used a chocolate ganache to top the cake. While making the ganache I added 1-2 tablespoons of the hazelnut liqueur.
After pouring the ganache and allowing it to cool I topped off this beautiful cheesecake with Ferrero Roche chocolates instead of the toasted hazelnuts.
This was a pretty big hit with my family.
If you use the water bath method your cake will bake evenly and not run the risk of cracking, if not this is a great and simple method to bake an incredible 
cheesecake...Enjoy!

I have made so many cheesecakes over the years but this beats them all. It's delicious, topped with the best chocolate frosting imaginable. I had a bit of trouble melting the chipped chocolate chips but with a little added oil, it finally worked and then the sour cream made it so smooth! I was surprised that it didn't call for a water bath in the oven, but it turned out perfectly, just as the recipe was written.

After working my way through this recipe a number of times, I can say with certainty that it is easy to make and the return is great. At times I have followed the recipe to a T and have also strayed in favor of more crust and each time the result is good—very good indeed. This is a great, special cheesecake recipe even a bad baker can manage to taste great!

Simply the best cheesecake I've ever had! It was gorgeous and delicious and stunning for Thanksgiving dessert. Used Torani hazelnut flavouring, as I didn't have liquer. This recipe takes time with waiting, roasting, crushing, whipping, etc. but it is absolutely worth it!

I followed this recipe to a T and it turned out FANTASTIC! This was our Thanksgiving dessert and the whole family was amazed. It truly looks as beautiful as it tastes, and is up there with my favourite cheesecakes. It takes a bit of time with all the toasting, grinding, baking and waiting, but it is so worth it!

My family loved this! It did crack along the top edges and a little down the middle though because 1 hour was too long for my oven and it overcooked it (I should have watched it better), but the taste was still amazing and the chocolate glaze covered up the cracks anyway! I used about 2 cups chocolate wafers and 1 cup chopped hazelnuts for the crust because I didn't want to have to chop up chocolate chips and look for vanilla wafers :) Definitely will keep making this!

I've made this three times, already. I can't get hazelnut liqueur here, so I've had to use Nutella for all of my flavouring. Instead of putting it in the cheesecake, I put vanilla flavour and use nutella in the sauce. It works perfectly with sour cream, or double cream. Also, used chocolate digestives for the crust, as I can't get graham crackers or vanilla wafers in my part of the UK. I also used chopped hazelnuts, as whole ones were more expensive. Everytime I make this, it's gone within two days, as friends and other family find out and come over to eat some! Thanks for the recipes. It's gorgeous!!

I added 2 tablespoon kahlua to the batter and 1 tablespoon to the glaze and used chopped almonds in place of hazelnut.  It turned out great.

Yummy recipe. I suggest not adding the hazel nuts on top until serving time. They will lose their crisp if added more than a few hours a head of time. I have never had the hazelnut liqueur and it is great anyway. I've made this several times with different variations to lighten the recipe (different cheeses, low fat sour cream, less choc chips, some egg substitute) and all have been great!

Had to add extra butter to get the crust to be workable (may be the dry climate here).  My cake fell and had a huge crack in it.  Very unfortunate.  I think next time I will add the cheesecake while preheating the oven.  I think that helps prevent cracking.  The chocolate on top was a bit overwhelming, will go easier next time.  With a few tweeks, I'd give it 5 stars.

This was the first cheesecake I'd ever made and it turned out great. I didn't read the cheesecake tips before making, so mine fell, but i covered it with nuts and chocolate and nobody seemed to notice. I will definitely make this recipe again and even experiment on my own.

I have made this cheesecake several times, always to rave reviews.  It's the best cheesecake I believe I've ever had.  I initially tried the recipe so I could use up a bottle of Frangelico that I had.  I always use chocolate grahams for the crust, and I think this makes it better.  The hazelnuts are a pain to work with, but oh so good.  I don't think I used quite as many as I was supposed to last time, and I just put the chocolate topping on and then sprinkled with chopped nuts to make it a little easier.  Magnifique!

This was a delicious cheesecake.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I would change is to make a regular graham cracker crust.  I did not like the vanilla wafer crust.  I will definitely make this again!

This cheesecake was delicious and beautiful.  It got many compliments at the two Christmas parties I brought it to.  

When adding the chocolate glaze I forgot to add the sour cream.  The chocolate applied nicely, but after it hardened it was much harder than the cake under it, so it was impossible to cut!  My fault, I'll be more careful next time.  :)

I'll make this one again, I'm sure.

This cheesecake is wonderful!  My friends and I always try to out do each other when it comes to cheesecake.  I even got compliments from our semi-professional chef.  I only put the crust on the bottom of the pan.  The second time I made it, I opted to not put make the topping.  I just put shaved chocolate on top.  Delish!

My first cheesecake, I made this for a party.  It packs a lot of "presentation" punch, for very little work.  I added an extra Tbs of hazelnut liquer to the topping, and had to use almonds for the crust, but it was a big success!

Absolutely Fabuliscious!!! This is indeed a very simple recipe although it does take time, i.e. 1 hour to bake, 1 hour to cool. The result is a very pleasing dessert to all ('xcept those you can't eat nuts) with a good consistency and satisfying experience all around. I have relied on this recipe now for all special occasions and for guaranteed smiles: b-day, family get-together, parties, holidays.... absolutely a must in the tool-box. Also, many people always ask for the recipe. You could probably start your own business just selling these.... :-P

Delicious! The hazelnuts take time to skin,but definitely worth it. I used mini chips in the cheesecake and doubled the crust. I brought to a party and it was the last dessert to arrive and first to disappear. Thanks!

This cheesecake is fabulous!  I have been making it for at least 6 years as Christmas presents.  People don't believe I've made it, its so awesome.  I can't begin to count how many I've done, but these consistently requested year after year. I even by my hazelnuts in bulk!

this cheesecake is so amazing, and I couldn't have found it at a better time. I've been wanting to make a cheesecake, but they all take so much time to chill. Everyone absolutely loved it. I was frustrated when trying to get the hazelnuts, because the stores around here don't get them instock until next week, and I'm too young to buy the liquor. I used a chocolate bar with hazelnuts in it for the crust and topping. I used hazelnut flavored creamer instead of liquor. Next time I will try it with hazelnut flavoring so that it will stand out a bit more. THANKS for making my first cheesecake experience great!

Where I live there is no way I can get hazelnuts that are skinless.  So, the night before Xmas supper I had my husband cracking nuts while I got the rest ready.  Then I had to toast the nuts and rub the skins off.  (huge Job)  I wasn't impressed with the results.  We all ate more whipped cream with our dessert than cheesecake to try to counteract the very rich cheesecake.  Normally I like rich - but this was too much.  After, I overheard someone say that they wish I would have just had pumpkin pie.

Great recipe!  As other reviewers suggested, I added about a tablespoon of cocoa to the crust.  This cheesecake is delicious -- and it's so festive looking.  It's great for Christmas or any special occasion.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Also, like other reviewers suggested I crumbled a chocolate hazelnut candy bar on top instead of the hazelnuts dipped in chocolate.  Wonderful!

I made according to the recipe, but used powdered sugar for the glaze, and added 1 TBSP of flour to the cake. It was good, but the cake was a little soft. Not my favorite cheesecake, but very good.

Great recipe!  The reviews helped a lot. I  left the chocolate out of the batter and it was a perfect balance. I didn't have vanilla wafers so I used graham crackers. Simple, beautiful, and perfect for Christmas! I would make again in a heartbeat. The chocolate topping was very yummy!

This was pretty good but I would like to make some more adjustments to make it even better. I used chocolate wafers for the crust. I think I may make a different cheesecake recipe and then incorporate ingredients from this one to make a more hazelnutty cheesecake.

not bad very rich and a bit too sweet. people ate it but were not over joyed about it. does smell good bakeing though. no need to really use skinless nuts just chop them up really well and you will be ok
