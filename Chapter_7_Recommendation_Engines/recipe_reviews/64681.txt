I tossed all the vegetable ingredients for this in the slow cooker, put it on the low setting for about six hours, stirred in the butter and flour, and had a beautiful, healthy, delicious soup in the end.  For seasoning, I used a dash of cinnamon and clove to bring out the flavor of the squash and then a whole lot of black pepper and red pepper flakes to make it spicy!  I would have given this recipe five stars if I hadn't had to improvise so much with the spices.

Wow, FABULOUS!  Had requests immediately to bring this again next year!  Makes a SUPER Thanksgiving dish - fun and delicious!!  Also works great with vegetarian broths.  Easy to make, especially if you can find frozen cubes of butternut.  Chop the potatoes small enough for them to cook with the others (I had mine too large and had to cook it all a bit longer).
Thank you for sharing this!

Couldn't believe how good this turned out, and how much everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it! They sopped up the bottom of their bowls with bread when there wasn't enough left to get into a spoon. Soooo delicious. But if you're using hominy, add GARLIC POWDER to balance the flavor. Also, I let this sit overnight in the fridge to thicken, and then reheated to serve it on Thanksgiving. This made it even yummier! Major repeat!!! :-)

You can buy already peeled and cubed squash at the store which makes this a quick and easy supper.  The comments on it needing extra are right, but this soup comes from an old recipe.  The Iroquois would not have had access to spices.

I had some hominy that needed to be used, so I decided to try this recipe...it looked very different,yet yummy. I made it as written, but added a minced garlic clove and about 1/2 cup of chopped onion for more flavor. My family really liked this soup! This surprised me...I'd figured this would be another one that I had to eat up by myself. Thanks for sharing...we really enjoyed this!

My husband made this at a rendezvous in a 35 gallon kettle, yes 35 gallons.  Everyone loved it and we had requests to make it again this year. Excellent!

This is awesome!  Even my pickiest eaters love this.  I have 4 small children, plus my brother is living with us right now, so we eat a lot of soups (quick, easy, and can make large amounts).  We've made this 3 times already with our butternut squash from our garden.  We've been using yellow corn instead of hominy, and it's worked really well for us.  Thanks SO much for this recipe! It's my hubby's fave!  I'm off to make it again tonight.

I added a dash of salt, 4 chopped garlic cloves, and substituted chicken broth for the water.  The soup was a Thanksgiving Day appetizer.  The pot was polished off in a matter of minutes!

Great soup.  I used a mixture of chicken broth and water with some chicken bouillon.  That was only change. Not that it was necessary.  Added some salt to taste.  This is not a spicy soup, but it is very flavorful.  As much as I love spice, not everything has to be spiced up.  This was my first time to make it and there were no leftovers.  I will be making this regularly as it is so good, so easy, and even healthy!
(I buy the butternut squash fresh but already peeled and cut. I then dice to the size of cubes I want. Big time saver.)

Very good, but needed more flavor. I added salt, cayenne pepper, used homemade chicken stock and simmered it for at least an hour.

This soup was fabulous! No extra seasoning needed, it was perfect as is.  I used vegetarian "no-chicken" bouillon instead of the granules and I did take the immersion blender to it, since it didn't thicken as much as I wanted.  I left it plenty chunky, and blending did the trick.  I will definitely add this to my winter soup collection.

Ugh...I don't like giving bad reviews, I am really not a very picky eater but this did not go over well for us. I have never had Hominy before and I don't htink we are big squash lovers. I made this because it got good reviews and it was low calorie I figured I would give it a shot. I did omit the butter and flour and just pureed a big portion of the soup to thicken it up. It was good and thick. I added some extra pepper after tasting and a dash of cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe, it was worth the try but I won't be making this again.

Delicious and unique, a perfect combo! I love hearty soups and was looking for something to do with a surplus of butternut squash, and this recipe really hit the spot! I let it cook a bit too long, and had to re-ad some broth to find the right consitancy, but it tasted wonderful. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.I am looking forward to making it again soon.

We make this soup often with some modifications. We are vegan so we omit the butter and use veggie bouillon. We use an emersion blender on 2/3 of the soup eliminating the need for flour altogether. I often add onions and garlic for flavor. If the need arises this is a great soup to throw in all your veggies that need to be eaten right away. Thanks for a great base recipe.

This is a great recipe, and leaves room for editing if you wish to do so. I added two boneless chicken breasts, and replaced the 5C. water with 4C. chicken broth and 1C. water. Delicious and perfect for those chilly autumn nights! Enjoy!

This soup is fantastic!  I've made it twice in the last three weeks.  My husband, who isn't a squash fan loves it, and so do my picky eaters.  The flavors compliment each other so well, there's no need to add other stuff.  I love how filling and healthy it is.

This soup is awesome! I doubled the recipe (and only used 8 cups of water because that was the most the pot could hold) and it came out great! I didn't add any additional seasoning...I really wanted the flavors of the veggies to come through and I thought it was perfect. Will be making again!

I made this today and I'm really enjoying it right now. I used a carton of chicken broth as well as a couple cups of water with 3 boillon cubes. I then added white pepper, black pepper, Italian seasoning, and some white wine. I also had some chayote squash on hand so I added that to the pot as well. It's pretty yummy and hitting the spot on this cold snowy day.

This seemed so simple I worried it would be bland, but the flavor was very good.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it was something different from the standard Turkey Day staples.  Big hit.

I'm a very beginner cook and this was easy to make. My family enjoyed it very much, including my picky mom and grandma. I taste tested it once it finished cooking and I thought there was too much bouillon. However, after letting it sit overnight, it tasted just fine.

One of my little sisters is a picky eater, but I was very pleased to hear her ask for seconds on this!
A few spices would probably be good though, it could stand to be spiced up a little more.

I debated on adding spices, I was worries it would be bland. Im glad I didnt! This soup was fantastic the way it is written.  I did do a few alterations to make it vegan though, used vegetarian broth and olive oil. Fantastic,  will be making this again!

This splendid recipe is an example of how a few simple ingredients can blend together to achieve a truly greater flavor, taste, texture and quality than the sum of its parts. Three Sisters (corn, squash and beans) is a divine soup for Thanksgiving, particularly because it is handed down from the Iroquois Indians. What's not to love??

Made this to go with Thanksgiving dinner.  Best soup I've had in years.  I tweaked it a little by adding some garlic, carrots and chicken stock in addition to the boullion. I actually replaced the water with the stock.  Hands down, this soup has been added to my Thanksgiving dinner list to use year after year. I've never been a fan of Butternut Squash but thanks to this soup I love it now.

We were surprised at how much we liked this soup.  The ingredients seemed to be an odd grouping but the flavors worked very well together.  We did add a little more butter than it called for and it made it even better!!

wow, my son needed a recipe for his class thanksgiving feast, this with the story was perfect.  My family also loved it.  I agree that the frozen squash made it easier but I used fresh when I made it with my son.

I had to throw something together at the last minute. After making some cornbread, it was easy to get this prepared and cooking. Dinner was on the table in no time at all. We loved it.

Instead of using water and bullion cubes, I opted to use some fresh chicken stock, which added a nice flavor, and wasn't as salty as it would have been with the bullion.

I used canned green beans, and accidentally added the butter to the pot with the other ingredients.  So I acted like it didn't happen and did butter and flour as instructed.  It added more calories, of course.  This was delicious!

Used hominy, green beans, corn, potatoes from my pantry for a last minute good meal. I used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of butter and flour. Got good reviews from this house!

I made this and it turned out beautifully with a few minor tweaks (hence 4 stars and not 5)..  I did follow the suggestions of some readers who noted that it needed a bit of a punch, flavor-wise, and I added some finely chopped onion and minced garlic.  I doubled the amount of black pepper and added about 1 tsp. of dried rosemary.  Sprinkling some red pepper flakes in the soup at serving makes it suitably spicy for my guys who prefer a bit of heat -- but it isn't necessary -- the soup is flavorful and delicious, without them.  I made it in the slow cooker and it turned out beautifully after 3 hours on HIGH.  It's a keeper.  Many thanks to the contributor  for sharing this recipe.

Loved this soup! I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water and bouillon since that's what I had in my pantry. I also added a bit of Penzey's Brady Street Cheese Sprinkle that I needed to use up (mostly consists of Romano cheese and garlic powder). Delish! Hubs likes spice, so he added a sliced jalapeño to his bowl. I would definitely make this again.

I LOVE-Love Three Sisters Soup! I omit the white potatoes,  butter and flour. I use both sweet potato along with squash, corn, green beans and low sodium chicken broth and 2 cups of vegetable broth.  I also added one onion.  This is an excellent low sodium and low fat soup.

I thought this nice and comforting; a lovely fall soup. I can see where it would benefit from the addition of spices (and I love using all sorts of spices) but I enjoyed it without any additions other than increasing the black pepper. Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe for a mom trying to go vegetarian with a family that insists on meat.  I just added cooked 97% reduced fat breakfast sausage after I gave my self a vegetarian portion.  I also used pumpkin instead of butternut squash because that's what we had in the pantry.
