Boy, everyone seemed to love this, but, it was not a hit with my family.   Previous reviewers had issues with thickening their sauce, however, mine was very thick.  I ended up having to add more beef broth and it was still too thick.   The submitter just said to add two red onions and doesn't give measurements, so, maybe my onions were larger.  We also thought the sauce was very heavy and seemed overwhelming for the steak.   I think using a cup of cream was just too much.  I will not be making this again.

I thought this was a very good, classic steak recipe. I was looking for something with mushrooms and a good sauce for my steaks and mashed potatoes. This was simple and came together easily. The sauce had a very nice flavor and complimented the steak. I didn't have cream on hand so I used whole milk and just used some flour to thicken. Will definitely make this again.

This was quite good and easy.  I used a different kind of red wine, left out the broth and just used water, and used mushrooms I had dehydrated. I also added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce. I sliced the steaks instead of leaving them whole while they were partially frozen, so it cooked fast.  I'd make it again as an alternative to beef stroganov.

Had trouble getting the sauce to thicken up but it tastes amazing! I also used cremini instead of button mushrooms (what I had on hand), and I think it added a deeper flavor.

Very tasty. The cream sauce did not thicken up for me even after an extra 5 minutes. I'm anxious to try the recipe again to see it I can figure out where I went wrong.

This is a great recipe! I cut it to 2 portions and followed the recipe exactly. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium-rare, and the sauce, mushrooms and onions were delicious. The only complaint I have is that by the time the sauce sits 5 minutes to thicken, the mushrooms and onions are cold, the steak is luke warm, and even the sauce isn’t very hot. It would be much better served hot, so next time I’m going to have to figure out how to do that without ruining the otherwise excellent dish.

Made it without heavy whipping cream and added  more mustard. It turned out great even if it doesnt look so pretty as the picture. The hubby was very happy.

Added a bit of salt & pepper to the wine cream reduction. Served the steak with crispy baked potato fans and asparagus. My hubby says "Mmmmm!!!"
