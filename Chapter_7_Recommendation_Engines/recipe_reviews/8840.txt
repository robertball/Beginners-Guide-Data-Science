This is amazing and so easy to make. I've made this 4 times already and I must say, I prefer it better with Catalina dressing rather than French/Italian, which I tried out too. I made this with thighs and is just perfect (+cheaper, too). Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

           ***Just made this for a 5th time & was asked for the recipe by my own momma. 
TIP: Bake at 350 for 1 Hr, flip the chicken over, baste with juices & pop back in the oven for another 15-20 mins to get a caramalized effect. And definitely use Catalina over French/Italian, trust me***

Great recipe, especially if you don't have all the ingredients. I "improvised" and it turned out great. My husband wanted more! Here's what I did: A cup of apricot preserves, a cup of Italian dressing, and in place of the onion soup mix, I made my own. I used 1 tbsp onion flakes, 1 tbsp meat tenderizer seasoning, 1/4 cup of chicken broth, a pinch of pepper, and a pinch of sugar. I combined all the ingredients and poured it over my chicken pieces and dropped small spoonfuls of butter over the chicken to help brown the meat. I cooked it for 50 minutes. During cooking, I also spooned the marinade over the chicken a few times. Very easy, very simple. Just make sure you TASTE the marianade before using it. If it doesn't taste good before you put it on the chicken, it won't taste good after either. Get the sauce to your liking.

I have made this recipe for years, only I have always used Italian dressing in place of French dressing.  I will have to try French dressing for a change.  In recent years (now that we are more fat conscious)I always use the apricot jam, mixed with a package of dry Good Seasons Italian Dressing Mix and 1/4 vinegar (skip the oil).  This is a recipe I fall back on all the time.

I have made this recipe for many years using Wishbone Red Russian dressing (not as sweet as french dressing) using chicken thighs.  I found the breast meat too dry.  This recipe is always requested for "potluck dinners".  Yesterday, I did not want to use the oven, so I made it on top of the stove and it was just as good as oven baked.  I did the same as if I was going to bake it.  Placed the chicken thighs in one layer in a large skillet, added ingredients and simmered for 45 minutes.  Excellent!!

What a great recipe!  Incredibly easy to make and very tasty.  My husband and friends loved it.  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and used 4 skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I also marinated the chicken breasts in the apricot mixture for an hour before baking and then served them over brown rice. I will absolutely make this recipe again-- it is delicious!

OK, so I don't know why I am different than everyone else but I had some problems with this dish. This is not a recipe where you just pour on the sauce and walk away. I checked mine after about 10 minutes of cooking and all the sauce had slid off the thighs and was burning, because of all the sugar, onto the baking dish. Thank goodness I had lined the pan as a precaution but a novice cook may not have known to do that. I re basted and turned them several times during cooking until I finally thought some of the sauce was on the chicken, not just the pan. That being said with lots of tending the final product was moist and flavorful. I think this dish would be much better by first browning the thighs and then putting them in a crock pot. If you are using the oven, put them in the smallest possible dish so the sauce doesnt just run of the sides. Oh my gosh, DO NOT forget to line the pan with foil.

Made this when we hosted another couple for an evening of cards.  Used 4 drumsticks and 4 thighs and subbed 1 cup chopped onion for the onion soup (cuts down on the salt and the sugar as well).  Covered it the first 30 minutes of baking to keep the preserves from burning.  Served with brown rice and broccoli.

We loved this recipe! The chicken came out moist and tender with a wonderful fruity tangy flavor. I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it added a subtle earthy richness to the chicken instead.This is a keeper! Thanks Jeanne.

Very easy recipe that included only a few items that I had on hand.
I made the recipe with thighs and breasts and they turned out great. The extra sauce made a great dipping auce for the chicken. I added a salad and mashed potatoes to complete the meal.

this  is an old standby, I learned as Golfers Chicken, it's aka Babysitters Chicken and Onion Apricot chicken...  either way it's very easy and very good.  Serve it with sourdough french bread, the tang of the sourdough is perfect with the sweet of the sauce.  If you can't find french dressing, you may use catalina dressing.  It used to be russian dressing then California dressing, now in my area I find it as catalina.  It's the bright orange dressing (NOT thousand island) that you are looking for, it may different names in different regions and as social/political things changes (remember when sitting criss cross applesauce was called indian style?, same thing_).

This is a very good, solid recipe. I used organic apricot preserves and organic French dressing from Whole Foods. I couldn't find a dry onion soup mix there, so I bought a pkg. of french onion dip mix. I also used free-range chicken. I think because there are so few ingredients, the quality matters! Served with rice and green beans. Yum.

So delicious!!! I did use the Catalina dressing and I wouldn't try it with anything else.  I used "All Fruit" apricot spread, because I didn't want the high fructose corn syrup.  I used 1/2 package of Mrs. Grass Onion soup mix.  I think a whole package would have been too much.  I put in a couple large handfuls of dried cranberries.  Everyone loved it!  The only suggestion I got was to thicken the sauce with a little corn starch.  I'll try that next time AND THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME!  Thank you!

This was good, but the sauce seemed a little runny. However, it was very easy and a nice change from the typical chicken dish. If you like a slightly sweet, tangy sauce with your chicken, you'll like this. A good addition might be some serano or habanero chile peppers to kick it up a notch.

Very good. I used peach preserves because I did not have apricot. I used Western dressing instead of French (again, it was what I had).  I used a packet of Italian dressing and thinly sliced an onion and put on top of the chicken. Poured the mix over the chicken, I had 4 thighs and 3 breasts. Baked at 350 and about 35 mins into it I turned the chicken.  At one hour I turned the broiler on low for the last 5 minutes.  I asked my husband what he thought and he said to not change a thing.  We will make it again soon!!

This recipe has been handed down since about the 1970's. It is more than a winner if that's possible. I add some fresh  ginger. Once I put everything into a large zip-lock to prepare that night. It didn't happen ,but the next day I baked it after sitting in the'fridge overnight. It was great. Use it for pork chops or roast too. By DECY

What a treat! I didn't have any apricot preserves so I drained a can of apricots, mashed them w/ a potato masher, added 1 cup sugar and 2 T. cornstarch mixed in 1 T. cold water. I brought that to a biol, stirring constantly, then simmered to finish thickening. Perfect preserves! I continued with the rest of the recipe as written except I used Catalina salad dressing as suggested by other reviewers. I served this with red rice and strawberry and feta salad from this site. The next day I rolled the leftovers in Drakes fish batter and deep fried. It was 'finger-lickin' -good!'

I tried this last night for just my husband and myself for a quick, easy dinner in the midst of busy Christmas preparations.  I cut the recipe down for a smaller number of servings and used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  It was super easy with minimum of preparation AND it was soooo delicious!  I just put a couple of potatoes into the oven to bake at the same time, and added a quick tossed salad and some buttered corn and we had a beautiful and extremely delicious dinner.  This is definitely a "keeper" that is very good, produced very moist and flavorful chicken, and is worthy of being served as a company meal.

This was a HIT! We had 15 people coming for dinner so I doubled the recipe, using 28 skinless, boneless thighs.  I think I must have read all the reviews and here's what I did: I only used about 1/2 the onion soup packet and choose Russian dressing along with e apricot preserves (2 cups of each).  I marinated them overnight.  I baked them in 2 9x13 glass casseroles.  I cut up 1 large onion (coarsest chopped so they could be avoided if desired) and put half in the bottom of each pan.  Next, I took the pieces out of the marinade and divided between the two pans.  I seasoned the chicken with a little salt, pepper, garlic and paprika and then poured the rest of the dressing mis over the chicken.  Basted once during cooking.  Chicken was BEAUTIFUL but the juices were too greasy/ runny to serve in the dish itself so we transferred to a platter and served the gravy on the side.

This dish is fabulous!!  I prefer boneless skinless chicken breasts, so that is what I used.  I also wanted more "stuff" in the sauce, so I put sliced onions on the bottom of my dish and then placed the chicken on top before spreading on the sauce.  I am not a fan of changing a recipe and then rating it poorly, so I believe that this recipe is perfect as written.  I do like my slight alterations which lowers the fat content of the meat as well as adds a healthy veggie.  This will be a new go-to recipe in my kitchen.

OMG! This is my first review at allrecipes as when I cooked other allrecipe dishes, they came out well, but nothing to brag about. This recipe is different - I even had to create an account to review it, that's how good it was! SUPER DELICIOUS!
Using others' inputs and some inspiration, I used 12 chicken legs, removed the skin, brined for 30 min (soaked in salty water solution), rubbed with salt, pepper, onion powder. Mixed peach preserves, french dressing, 1 chopped onion & a pinch of curry in a bowl, poured the sauce over chicken and baked as intructed. It baked for 1.5 hours due to the bone but came out drop off the bone delicious. Will make more, lots more!!!

I love recipes with only four ingredients that taste delicious, and are simple too. As written, this produces a lot of sauce, so I'll make rice next time too and pour the mixture over it.

This was awesome and super easy!  I thought I had apricot preserves, but I guess it was orange marmalade - but it worked out great, and I think it's pretty similar.  Others said that they used Catalina or Italian dressing -- but I went with French, as the recipe calls for (the 'sweet and spicy' kind) and it worked out great.  I used proportions as directed and used chicken thighs.  It was a hit and I'll definitely make again.

I also have been making this for 10 yrs. I have always used Russian Dressing and so love it!! I also add pineapple chunks. I have used apricot-peach jam(preserves) and it is yummy.

We've made this twice and a nice change in our dinner rotation. Served over rice. If it seems too "saucy" just bring sauce to a boil and add cornstarch/water to thicken, lovely gravy perfect over rice or noodles would be good too! It's a Winner!

The crockpot worked great for this! I put the frozen solid boneless skinless thighs in with the sauce on low for 3.5 hrs and it was perfect. No knife needed. All my boys were upset there wasn't more.

Wasn't sure if I would like this combination of ingredients, but it is really good! And so simple and quick to throw together! Really good served with rice and a side of steamed brocolli.

This is a really good easy recipe that the kids will love. It makes a nice sauce that is good with rice. I had to use mango jam because that's what I had, and it was great. I think it would be easy to change it around a bit and still get a nice dinner. Would be very easy to make for a large group.

What a great combination of flavors! Add red pepper flake if you like some heat and take the skin off the chicken. It's sweet, oniony, and a little spicy..a definite try! Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  This is fantastic and SOOOO easy!  I used Catalina dressing instead of french because that's what I had on hand.  My son said it tasted like sweet and sour chicken but better - everyone finished their entire plate.  I also used 5 thin chicken breasts because of our taste preferences but seriously - this is now going to be a permanent part of our rotation!  THANK YOU!

This recipe was first published by a Taste of Home viewer in the Taste of Home cookbook Low Fat
 Country Cooking about 20 years ago.  It used boneless and skinless breasts however.  It is tasty and delicious.  However, there is a lot of salt in the soup  mix.  So, I substitute dried onion flakes in place of the soup and it is just as good.  I also sometimes use strawberry preserves in place of the apricot preserves and that works great too.  I use Catalina salad dressing as that is better than the French dressing, although both are quite tasty.  Yummmm....Once you try it you will love it.

I have made this for years. It is one of my favorites! I use the red or clear Russian (not the creamy Russian) dressing but I'm sure the French dressing would be delicious as well. I will be trying it soon with the french dressing. I bake some potatoes while the chicken is baking and put some of the sauce of my potato when I eat it - yum!

The whole family loved this.  I followed another reviewer's suggestions to cut fat and used 1 pkt dry italian season and 1/3 cup vinegar instead of the french dressing which I didn't have.  I also used bonelss skinless breast and let them marinate for an hour or so before cooking.  So good! And plenty of sauce left for dipping.

Wonderful! I took a reviewer's advice and used a cup of chopped onion instead of the onion soup and it was fresh and flavorful but  not too sweet. I added pineapple twenty minutes before done and served over white rice with plenty of the sauce. Coupled with a  lettuce, zuccini and carrot salad with honey mustard this was a divine meal.

Easy and delicious; I've been making it for years and it's always a hit. It goes amazingly well with rice and broccoli. It tastes even more amazing if the ingredients marinate overnight. I now put everything together the night before, refrigerate and pop in the oven an hour or so before dinnertime.

I used this with boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Turned out pretty good.  The sauce is good but the chicken didnt take on the flavors very well.  Next time I will marinate the chicken.

I had a hard time believing this was going to be good, given the ingredients and simplicity.  This was delish & my husband loved it too.  I would even make this for company.  It pared well with snap peas.  Next time I will reduce the onion soup mix by 1/2.  I'll also serve w/ a crusty bread to sop up the yummy juice.  Thanks for posting.

This recipe had a good taste with just a hint of sweetness.  I'd actually rate it as a 4.5 instead of a 4.  I reduced the recipe to two servings and used two medium-sized chicken breasts.  I pierced the chicken breasts with a fork and let them marinate in the sauce overnight. I made the recipe as stated and was very happy with the results.

Since I found this recipe in January, I have made it several times...much to the appreciation of my roommates and neighbors.  People always rave when I make it.  Adding a little soy sauce makes it great, too.  

Also, don't drown the chicken with the sauce.  The more exposed, the more thoroughly the meat cooks.  But keep spooning sauce throughout the hour to ensure maximum deliciousness!

I used apricot jam and Catalina with dry onion soup mix and it was delicious! I also took skin off the thighs and baked at 350 for 1 hr. Made it with the carrot rice also from this website and drizzled the chicken sauce over the rice... Yum!

Made this the other night and the whole family loved it. Everyone wanted seconds! The only thing I will do differently is skin the chicken next time. I left it on and the dish came out really greasy; which was a shame because I couldn't pour any of the sauce from the pan on the plated dinners. But the entire family agreed it is a good dish.

Excellent dish! Fixed rice as a side & put some sauce on top.  I used 6 chicken breast with bones.  I removed skin & pierced chicken with fork & let sauce marinate for 2 hrs before baking.  I did not add the onion soup mix, but added seasoning salt.  I covered with foil when I baked it.  Everyone loved it!

Very good. Was told it tasted Asian. Good with onion rice and green beans amandine. Update: made this again. Didn't have any onion soup mix so I used dried minced onion, a little sriracha, garlic, and oyster sauce to make up for the flavor. I placed a bed of cut up veggies(broccoli, carrots, red peppers, and mushrooms) on foil, then placed chicken drumsticks on top. Baked at 350 for 30 mins, turned over chicken and basted, cooked another 30 mins, basted, then broiled a few mins to crisp up skin. Served with whole wheat couscous. I plan on making this regularly

Yummy and easy - one of my favorite week night recipes. I use boneless skinless thigs and it cooks up so quick. I have also made this with cranberry sauce in place of apricot jam, but I like it with the jam better. Thanks!

Didn't have enough flavor for us.  Salt, pepper, and garlic powder before sauce probably would add a lot!

This was wonderful, so juicy, full of flavor and super easy. I will definitely be putting this in heavy rotation.
If I hadn't altered the recipe I would give this 5 stars. (I used four boneless, skinless chicken breasts and Italian dressing because I hate French and Catalina dressing!)

I did not care for this recipe. I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and used Catalina dressing - perhaps this was my mistake, although Catalina is quite close to French. My husband gave it two thumbs down as well.

I made this recipe as published. Since it did not indicate whether to use boneless thighs or not, I used bone-in thighs, removing the skin and fat. Twelve pieces fit perfect in a 13x9 pyrex. I turned the pieces over halfway through the cooking to ensure the flavor would fully penetrate the meat, and cooked a tad longer than an hour because of the bones. The flavor was good, although it seemed there was quite a bit of grease on top of the sauce when the chicken was finished cooking. Would like to try adding a bit of cornstarch to the apricot mixture next time in order to thicken it up just slightly and be able to pour a little over the chicken when serving. Overall, very good recipe.

This was really good! I used skinless chicken breast and it came out tender and juicy. The sauce was very good, but really doesn't taste like apricot. To me, it tasted more like a mild onion barbeque sauce.

I make this recipe with the bulk pack of thighs..I like the thighs because the stay juicier. I use the whole 500ml jar of Apricot jam, a big bottle of Russion dressing, 1 cup of sweet chili sauce, and 3/4 packet of onion soup mix. Great recipe to bring to a potluck because it serves alot. Very delicious, I am always asked for the recipe.

good recipe. I delte the french dressing and instead I also add a can of apricot nectar which i mix in the soup mix and tblsp flour prior to pouring over chicken pieces.  I also add sliced potato, this too helps thicken the sauce and makes more of a meal.  serve over rice.  enjoy

This was good and easy.  I used Russian as some reviews mention.  I did a test of the sauce with french and russian, but preferred russian.

Just putting my 2 cents in here. I found a very similar recipe almost 30 years ago in a weathered, old church cookbook I had picked up at an estate sale.   Everything was the same ....except for that it called for Russian dressing... and it always turned out really good.  I decided to take the advice of someone here and substitute Catalina dressing. Although it was good... please try it using the Russian dressing...it's way better and it stays put on the chicken as it bakes. It's a creamier dressing and carmelizes better than the French or Catalina. 
Wishbone makes it. If you can't find it in your store, a good runner- up would be Thousand Island dressing.

Thanks for reminding me of this recipe...I had forgotten about it over the years.  It's so easy and quick to throw together and it's yummy!

Good recipe. Didn't have apricot so I used raspberry preserves, added some minced garlic, Italian dressing and onion and chive dip powder as didn't have onion soup, also added some slice onion and chicken bouillon. Will make it again.

I cook at Abba's Tables, our local soup kitchen - or as we refer to it - "The Lord's Free Restaurant." We try to provide our guests with a pleasant bistro-type atmosphere - a pleasant hour in the day that they would not otherwise have. I first made this recipe for 100 guests on New Year's eve, serving it with Basmati almond rice, sweet peas, tossed salad with cake and ice cream for dessert. Because we are always trying to stretch our meals, we used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. We chopped the chicken into pieces and boiled them, using only enough water to cover the chicken - if you use too much water you can end up leaving the chicken tasteless. Into the cooking water I place lots of quartered onions, lots of green pepper slices, a big handful of peppercorns, 6 bay leaves, about 1/3 of a cup of squished garlic and 1/2 can of chicken flavor base. After the chicken is cooked, you remove it from the broth being sure to remove peppercorns and bay  leaves. Place the chicken into another pot. Now stir in the sauce made of the apricot preserves, the Lipton Onion Mix and I use Catalina Dressing. Keep it warm till ready to serve. In the meantime, I garamelize a gallon full of chopped onions with white sugar and a pound of butter and white pepper. After cooking (in Chicken broth)  the potatoes I intend to use,  I add the caramelized onions and a quart of heavy whipping cream, and about three pounds of shredded cheddar cheese mixed with Monterey jack cheese. This plates pretty!!

It was way too "onion" flavored to begin with. I would recommend starting mixing the sauce with only the preserves, then add perhaps a fourth of the soup mix and french dressing, and then add more soup mix and french dressing to taste. We started with the whole soup packet, and ended up having to buy an additional jar of preserves to put into it (and then throw away most of the mix) to get the balance of the flavors right.

This was a good recipe. It didn't blow me away, but it was quick, tasty, and I'd definitely make it again. Other than scaling the recipe down to 4 servings and using sugar free apricot preserves, I followed the recipe exactly. I served it with a green salad and some garlic and herb rice. Maybe next time I'll add some pineapple chunks per another reviewer's suggestion and maybe even some sugar snap peas and carrots to up the nutritional content.

Great recipe. This is one of my husband's favorites. I don't care for the onion pieces from the soup mix, so I use a sifter to remove them. Be sure to use a quality salad dressing.

I would rate this maybe 3 stars just for the ease, taste-wise I just didn't find it something I would make again.  My husband rated it a solid 3 for taste and said it was pretty good, but on the bland side.  He grew up eating really bland food so this may have been something he was used to.  I don't know - it just wasn't for me.

Outstanding !!! I fixed it according to the recipe except I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper to the chicken thighs before pouring the preserves/soup mixture over the chicken. . . . We will definately be having this many more times !!! p.s. my husband is not a big chicken fan, but he loved this !!

Amazing chicken!! Thought the ingredient mix a little strange but tried it because of the good reviews. So glad I did!
Used the recipe mostly as is, only used half the onion soup mix (another reviewer said too oniony with the whole thing) and added a splash of sweet red chili sauce. Sprinkled the chicken lightly with seasoning salt and granulated garlic before pouring the sauce over. Absolutely delicious!!
Served with rice, steamed veggies and a green salad.
Will most definitely make again and again!

This one comes out of my recipe box.  I made it last night for dinner and wanted to throw it away & go for takeout.  I used Catalina dressing as suggested by some reviewers - maybe that was my mistake.  In any case, I was very disappointed.

Have added this to the repertoire of my catering company.  Absolutely fabulous basic recipe, Shang!  I added a 1/2 tsp liquid smoke because in catering, a char-grilled flavor presents better, but even without the addition, it's perfect in its simplicity.  Thanks, Shang!

This recipe ok but I did NOT care for how it turned out from the oven.  I think I could be a fan with this idea:  Once sauce is made marinade chicken overnite in 3/4 of the sauce.  GRILL chicken, NOT bake!  As chicken grilling occasionally brush with remaining sauce.  When you bake in the oven the skin just does not get crisp, so then you get what seems like soggy.  Salt and pepper a must!!!  ingredient list does not call for it but needs that contrast, too sweet otherwise.  GRILL GRILL GRILL  My guess also would be to marinade overnite and place in smoker for about 2 hours :)  I'll try these this summer when it warms up where I live and I will repost and let you know ;)

SOOOOO freaking good!  I used a 3lb bag of boneless skinless thighs.  Also used creamy french cuz that's what I had on hand.  I had a 12oz jar of apricot preserves, so I added a few scoops of peach preserves to up the jelly content and it was DYNAMITE!  I did think that it was a LOT of sauce, so next time I think I will halve the jelly & dressing part, still using a whole packet of soup mix.  So easy and so tasty!  Leftovers were awesome too!

Very, very yummy and super easy! Probably won't make it too often because of the sodium issue with the dry onion mix and dressing, however, it really was tasty! I served it over organic whole wheat pasta and a green salad. The pasta, which normally isn't the yummiest compared to normal pasta, really soaked up the sweet sauce beautifully, and my twin toddler boys ate it all up! Will definitely make again!  ****NOTE: If you have little ones, make sure you don't make this recipe with skinless chicken as it will brown the outer layer of the meat and, though it's yummy, the tough outer layer is hard to chew for the little guys. Could be a choking hazard. However, when cooking with the skin on, there isn't any problem because the skin gets browned and breaks down easy as you chew it.  Make the adult ones without skin for less calories, however, keep the skin on, at least while cooking, for the kiddos.

I took the advice of some other reviewers and used chicken legs, Catalina dressing, a little chili sauce, a little dry Italian dressing,a dash of dry mustard and the onion soup mix! YUM-O! The sauce was very close to a homemade barbecue sauce. It's so versatile that you can make it as sweet and/or spicy that you like.  I couldn't find pepper jelly at the store I was in, but I want to try making it with pepper jelly next time.  My husband, 2.5 yr old and I loved this. My husband commented that this will be a good sauce for snack wings. We def will make this all the time from now on. BTW, I made it with Zatarain's Yellow Rice and French cut green beans seasoned with the rest of the dry Italian dressing. These sides complimented the chicken nicely. Please try this recipe.... It is good and not too sweet at all! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

I made this dish in a covered skillet to save some time.  I served it with brown rice, eggrolls  & hot & sour soup. My family enjoyed it & hubby went for seconds.   My 11 yr. old really liked the sauce.  Very simple & quick to make.  Next time, I think I will lightly salt the chicken.

I've made this recipe for over 30 years. It's a very good one!  So simple to make.  Can be made with all pieces of chicken....not just thighs.  It's definitely a keeper!

if you want to give it a little kick simply add some pepper jelly - its sweet and spicy. Yum. Definitely remove the skin - less fat and you keep the sauce on the chicken.

Good recipe!  My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I used a combination of skinless, boneless thighs and a thin skinless chicken breasts.  I used the recommendations from other reviewers and used Catalina dressing.

Very easy. That gets my vote any day :) If you don't like sweet things with chicken, don't make this recipe. It is pretty darn sweet. That being said, it was good for a change. I did elect to replace the dry onion soup mix for about 1/4 cup of chopped white onions. I also added a couple dashes of smoked paprika and some cracked black pepper to taste. Made it on the stove top,  on low/med so that I could taste and add ingredients as it cooked. Will be making again. Thanks!

I made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked uncovered for 45 min. I used apricot-pineapple preserves and served it with orzo. It was a HUGE hit for even my pickiest son, he even took seconds.  The sauce was great on the orzo.  You can't get any easier than this recipe.

This is in my regular recipe rotation; it's delicious and simple. I make my own french dressing, sub a tablespoon of granulated onion and dash of salt for the soup packet, and get the fruitiest apricot preserves. Can't go wrong.

I have been making this recipe for years now, only using chicken wings, everyone raves about them, I usually make them at Christmas time, the only thing different is, I bake them in a 300 decree oven, for about 2 to 3 hours, the sauce gets nice and thick and gooey, and they fall of the bone, I don't like chewy chicken wings, you can serve them either hot or cold, try it you'll love them. Remember watch them and turn them often.

For me it was just okay.  I think the suggestion given to check the flavor of your sauce before you put it on the chicken is an important one.  Perhaps it was the brands I used but it was a bit "funky" tasting.

Tasty recipe.  Used russian dressing as recommended by several raters.  We do not normally keep french, russian dressings or apricot preserves on hand. Think results do not justify extra expense in our case.  Nontheless, a different taste that most would like.

Wonderful for just about any event.  Doubles easily and chicken breast work just as well.  Add wild rice and green beans for a great meal.

I made this the other night using boneless chicken thighs, apricot preserves, onion soup mix and Catalina dressing. All I can say is that it was delicious. Every one wanted more. My kids loved it even after my son said he didn't like apricots. They all wanted me to make it again the next day. It was so easy to make. I'm next going to try it using boneless chicken breasts. Also, I may try using turkey at some point. Very delicious and next time I make it, I'll make enough so I can have some.

Good recipe, the husband thought it was awesome!
I used chicken breast instead of thighs because that's what I had. I cut the cook time in half to keep it moist. I thought I had apricot preserves but it turned out to be Apple Jelly. I know, not really the same but at this point I was not about to drive 30 minutes round trip for the preserves so I went with it and also added some dried garlic to the marinade. I put it in the oven covered with foil to get the chicken cooking without having the sauce get burnt. It worked a little too well because the sauce didn't get thick. 10 minutes before I took the chicken out I pulled out the dish and poured 90% of the liquid into a sauce pan and thickened it up with cornstarch. It really came out nice, the chicken was moist and the thick, sweet, onion flavored sauce complimented it. Served with roasted butternut squash and a salad. Will make again.

I was a little leary to try it because of my texture issues and combination of taste. But I change my mind quickly when I put the sauce on the chicken and I saw it bubbling in the oven and then I took it out and I taste a bit of the sauce, it was heaven. Thank you for the recipe!

This has been an all time favorite family recipe for 30+ years for me and my family.  Easy and delightful! My recipe calls for the Russian dressing also which I have always used and which seems to be enjoyed by everyone who's had dinner at our house over the years.  Love it and will continue to use!

Made this years ago with red Russian dressing.  I think Catalina would be a great substitute!  We used to call it Sticky Chicken in our family.   A real favorite,

New favorite in my house.  Didn't have soup mix so I supplemented with 1/2 tsp beef boullion, 1 Tbsp dried minced onion, and 3 deep dashes with the onion powder bottle.  Also used homemade apricot preserves and served with a mixture of 'forbidden' rice/white rice and random colorful veggies.

I made this but without the french dressing.  I used a little italian dressing instead, but not a full cup because I wanted the sauce to be thick and stick to the chicken, not run off like some other reviews I read.  It was very tasty.  Husband and son liked it too.  Definitely a way to change up chicken.  Will make again.

This recipe was good.  My wife really liked it.  It was very easy and we will definitely cook it again.  I cooked the chicken meat side up.  I think this was a big mistake.  It was my mistake.  It left the skin side of the chicken in the juice and not browned at all.  The next time I'm going to cook it meat side down.  Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent! I used a few of the suggested changes posted. We used Catalina instead of french, and added a full can of drained pineapple chunks for the full cook time. We made a large batch (using 1 full bottle of dressing--approx 16 oz, 18 oz of apricot preserves, and added extra onion powder to the soup mix over about 7 spear-cut, large chicken breasts) and it fed 7 adults with plenty left over. We served the chicken with brown rice and steamed broccoli. Everyone loved it. Super easy to make. I must add that the dish would not have been as good without the pineapple! It countered the sweetness perfectly.

This is a very tasty recipe! The version I have doesn't call for the dried onion soup, so  I sprinkle the chicken with lite salt, pepper, and paprika (sweet or smoked, if you like it spicy). Then I put several dried apricots on each piece, mix sugar-free apricot preserves with the fat-free Russian or Catalina salad dressing, pour it over chicken and follow the baking instructions.  No one has ever complained about this dish!

I followed this recipe as per directions and it came out perfect, the only thing I'll  do different next time will be try different types of dressings to see if there's any I would like better. I did follow one persons comments and turned the thighs over after an hour for additional 15 minutes. Great recipe thank you for sharing.

This was great. I will be adding this to my list of chicken dishes that I make often.  I used the apricot jam and dry soup mix but used a sesame ginger dressing from Walmart.  Tasted very Oriental and smelled wonderful while cooking. Try it, you'll like it.

This is just average, in my opinion.  I made per recipe, and even tried it a second time, but for me it lacks luster.  Something is off in the balance of flavors for me.

Excellent recipe!!  As per the family's request, it has been added to my monthly menu and they want it at LEAST three times a month (the kids voted for twice a WEEK but that's a bit much, lol)

We tried it with Catalina and also with French dressing.  We decided Catalina made it amazing whereas the French dressing made it "pretty good."  (We like it both ways though and so this gets a 5/5)

Very easy and tasty. I used chicken legs because it's what I had on hand and only made a half batch.  Would be great with rice.

Instead of dry onion soup mix, I used about one tablespoon of onion powder and one fresh onion chopped into half inch pieces.  I also coated the chicken and onions in the sauce, covered and marinated it in the fridge for over one hour.  The chicken and onions tasted great.  The sauce is good over rice.  I used a meat thermometer to make sure I didn't over cook it.  The chicken turned out very moist.  Will make again.  Overall, great taste for little effort.

Used 6 chicken legs, 1/2 cup of apricot, 1/2 cup of catalina, and still the whole package of onion soup mix.  Great mix!  Will have leftovers tomorrow and serve it with the sauce over rice.

I tried this and loved it! I did use the suggestion of using Catalina dressing instead of Italian, it was very yummy. I also used Apricot/Pineapple jam because thats what I had. I would definitely make this again.

Absolutely amazing!! i also changed the french dressing out for italian and I pulled the skin off the thighs before coating. After coating I put in the fridge for 4 hours then popped it in the oven just before my boyfriend came home. served with a nice lite green salad, made a truely enjoyable meal. this one will be a staple.

I am just cooking for two, so I just used 4 thighs, and eyeballed the ingredients. My wife raved about it. I did cover it for the first 20-30 minutes. Cooked about the same time as the original recipe to get it up to poultry temperature. Keeper.

EXCELLENT!!!!!! - among the best chicken dishes I've ever had! So easy - the combination of the sweetness from the apricot jam with the unique taste of the onion soup mix is made in heaven.  Inexpensive chicken thighs are perfect for this dish. Served with (box) chicken stuffing mixed with sliced, cooked breakfast (pork & Beef) sausages.

Wow!  Rarely does a recipe this easy taste this delicious!  My entire family - hubby and 4 children - all LOVED it.  (Seldom do we get a true unanimous thumbs up on new recipes)! The chicken was INCREDIBLY moist and tender and the apricot flavor was evident, yet not overly sweet.  I served it with a quinoa and brown rice mixture, along with broccoli and pineapple chunks (kids' faves).  Will definitely add this recipe to my favorites list.

I made this for dinner tonight for the 1st time. I used 5 split chicken breasts. My kids do not eat drumsticks or thighs. There was plenty of mixture for the chicken. I also had it marinated for 2 hrs prior to baking. I cooked it for 1hr and this came out perfect. We all loved it and they suggested I make it again. I served it with whole grain brown rice and a salad. My 4 yr old son who is very picky even enjoyed it.

This is similar to a recipe I've made for years using one can of whole cranberries, 1 bottle Russian or French dressing and 1/2 packet of dry onion soup mix.  I put all of this in the slow cooker on low and cook for four hours then serve over rice.  Wonderful!!

I used peach preserves (what I had) and Russian dressing based on a friends recommendation, but it was great.  I'm not used to eating chicken thighs (dark meat) so it was richer than I'm used to.  My husband loved it.  It can't get much easier either.  I plan on using the leftovers in Stir Fry and I think it will be great.

This recipe is fantastic and so easy, Ilove it soooo much!!! I followed the recipe to a T and used someone else's advice by covering the meat with foil during the first 1/2 hour of baking and them removed it when I basted it. The meat is so flavorful and it comes off the bone so well! I will be making this over and over again! MMMMM!!!!!!!!

This has a great tangy sauce to it.  Theres two recipes almost exactly alike on here.  So I kind of used them both by making the sauce with half the french dressing in this one, and half the russian dressing thats in the other one.  I made these with the chicken thighs and it was very good.  I do think I would like this better with chicken breasts.  Im not for sure if it was from the skin of the thighs or the oil seperating from the dressings, but the sauce was just a little greasy and was separating a bit.  But it still had great flavor!  I will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe!

This dish was good, but provided too much fat for my liking. The sauce didn't thicken as much as it should have. Very good flavor and I will make it again. Instead of French dressing I used orange sesame manderine dressing. Nice flavor.

Oh my goodness this is soo good! Thank you for sharing this recipe. My kids and husband loved it but I did a few changes. I went ahead and cut off the skin as the reviews had said. Then I seasoned it with season salt and pepper on both sides. Then I seared both sides of the chicken on a pan in olive oil. After I placed them in a pan and covered it in the apricot sauce. Using apricot jelly, onion soup mix, Italian dressing and a TBS of sugar. Yummy! Would make this again and share this. aloha!

Not a hit with our family.  The onions were over powering and the flavors did not blend together well for us.  Will not be making this again.

At first I was really apprehensive about trying this recipe; I thought it would come out sweet. But wow!  This chicken was so delicious!  I ended up following the suggestion of reviewer 'Shannon' and tasted the marinade before putting it on the chicken. I ended up adding a bit more dressing than preserves. The result was fantastic! I will surely make this again.

Thanks for the recipe!  It was quick and easy, exactly as advertised!  I have tons of trouble cooking chicken properly, but this came out great.  I added a sprinkle of cumin to the sauce, and it really complemented the apricot.  Served with brown rice.

I used only 6 chicken thighs but used the same amount of other ingredients. I mixed  the sauce at the bottom with white rice after baking.  I loved the easy recipe and my family  really liked the meal.  This one is a keeper.

I made this same recipe for someone back in 1971.  He married me, that's how good it is!  I add a clove of garlic to it and serve over Basmati rice.

First I have to say that this recipe was a starting point for me as I didn't have any of the ingredients needed for the complete recipe. I played with what I had and boy was I surprised by the wonderful result!  I didn't have any salad dressing so I left it out.  I didn't have onion soup mix so I found a copy cat recipe on the web. 4 t. beef bouillon granules, 8 t.dried onion flakes, 1 t.onion powder, and 1/4  t. seasoned pepper. Made a lot so I only used 1/2. I had halved frozen apricots from a tree that went crazy and produced more fruit than I knew what to do with.  I made a syrup with them with 2 c. of apricots and 2 c. sugar, 1 c. of water and 1/4 c. pinapple juice and cooked it until it was a bubbling mush. I then  ran it through the blender and a fine strainer. It was a thick beautiful jelly sauce!  I added 1/2 of the soup mix recipe to it. I only had chicken breasts so I sauted them a little in butter before baking in the oven.  To each chicken breast I ladled the onion-apricot sauce and topped it off with a pinapple ring and baked until done.  Wow it tasted great!  The kids and hubby asked for seconds. (for meat that is unheard of for my kids!)  Thanks for the great idea of using apricots and chicken!

I loved this recipe.  It couldn't have been easier.  The only thing I would change for next time is to purchase sugar free apricot preserves.  The dish was just a little sweet for me.  I also used Russian dressing instead of French.

Wonderfully tasty!  I had already started to make this dish when I realised I didn't have onion soup powder, so added a bit of soy sauce for saltiness.  I also added some chopped dried apricots as I had them on hand and wanted to use them up.  The chicken was tender and full of flavour.  Thanks Jeanne

I'm not a big fan of onion soup mix so I had concerns when I read MNERDAHL's review.
The other reviews looked promising though so I used the Lipton's Golden Onion Soup, which is geared toward chicken, sifted out the dried onion bits (hate those), and only used 1/2 the mix. 
I had a Catalina Honey dressing but not quite a cup so I added about a 1/4 C. of apple cider vinegar to the dressing jar to get all I could out of it.
Also, I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs. It baked uncovered for about 20-30 minutes and was just awesome!! The flavor was just amazing.
Will definately make this again, and will try it with the full package of soup mix (sans nasty onion bits).

Great recipe, I've been doing a variation of it for decades...my mom thinks she invented the concept! I've always used Russian dressing (if I can find it), and 1 1/2 cup each of dressing and jam per envelope of soup mix. Any chicken parts work great, with or without bones/skin. For variety, add crushed red pepper to taste. My family loves it extra extra hot. ALWAYS A HIT!!! Try it with garlic mashed potatoes and corn. The chicken's sauce is great as a gravy over everything. If you've never tried this, you'll love it for dinner tonight, sooo easy and yummy! Thanks Jeannie!

Finally getting around to rating this wonderful recipe.  I was apprehensive because we hated French dressing but had oodles of Apricot preserves.  "Aunt Betty's French" and this recipe have now both become household favorites.  Very moist, not too sweet and couldn't be simplier.  Thank you

The entire family loved it. I used 8 chicken thighs with skin. I made a few changes because my family prefers a more crispy skin so I browned the chicken in butter in a skillet first. I then cooked it in the crockpot. When the dish was finished cooking in the crockpot, I removed the chicken and placed in the broiler for 5-10 minutes to crisp the skin again. While the chicken was in the broiler, I thickened the sauce by returning it to the heat and adding corn starch. This is important, otherwise, you won't get the full flavor of the sauce. I then poured the thickened sauce over the chicken. Everyone loved it. Next time I might put 2 packets of the soup mix.

This recipe was awesome (I took off one star for the changes I made) and I will certainly add it to my regular rotation. I did make  a few changes however  First, like another reviewer suggested I used Catalina dressing instead of French. Second, when I was covering the chicken with the mixture I actually placed some of the mixture inside of the chicken. So I know this is hard to imagine but with having 12 chicken thighs  I had to sorta roll them a little to fit them all in my 8 x 12 baking pan. So I figured since I was rolling /folding them a little that i would place some of the mixture inside them and that was a fantastic decision since the flavor really penetrated the chicken. Lastly, I  made sure to leave about a 1/4 of the mixture for the end which I used to coat the chicken with after letting it bake covered for about an hour. So after baking covered for an hour I uncovered the chicken coated with the leftover sauce and baked another 15 mins. Now I know these are a lot of changes, but certainly with these changes the chicken was great!! It was so moist  and flavorful I would even make it for company.

This is an old family favourite  recipe that we have been enjoying since the 1970's and still enjoy today.  We prefer using thighs as they are consistently more moist. The juice went over top of the rice and [frozen] vegetables were served on the side in the day. It still works today, however we now have a plethora of fresh produce and wonderfully healthy grains to choose from. This dish makes a very colourful and flavourful meal.

Now having made it for the 2nd time, I love this dish.  It calls for few ingredients that make a big punch! I hate doing this, but I had to make a few moderations. 1. I seasoned the chicken with my faves seasonings and the onion soup. I allowed to marinate for a few hrs before sticking in the oven. 2. I covered mine and baked for about an hr and half before topping with the apricot mixture. I wanted the chicken to release most of its natural juices first. 3. once i poured most of the liquid off I added the apricot mix and baked for another hour uncovered. The result was moist, tender, and still very flavorful! overall Great recipe!

My family liked this and we would make it again. I made Onion Soup Mix from scratch using the recipe from this site. My preserves were Peach-Mango-Orange but it tasted similar to Apricot. I used Catalina dressing as others suggested. I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch/water slurry to the sauce before pouring it over the chicken. This alleviated the runny sauce that other chefs complained about. I cut boneless skinless chicken thighs into pieces, poured the sauce over the top and baked at 425 for 40 minutes. When it was done I stirred in a can of drained mandarin orange slices. Sprinkled toasted sesame seeds over the top.

Served with Egg Fried Rice from this site. It was delicious! Next time I will add water chestnuts to give it some texture. And maybe top with some sliced green onion.

This is a family favorite served over rice.  I usually add a cut up onion and a small bag of baby carrots.  Sometimes I use frozen skinless/boneless chicken breasts rather than thighs.

Ok my wife won't eat anything that isn't fast food or Mac and cheese and she LOVED this. It's fantastic. Swap for the Italian dressing, flip it over and baste after and hour and your chicken will be fall off the bone amazing. Like eating tiny sweet and sour rotisserie chickens!

I loved this. I cut the recipe in half, because my family is small; my wife is vegan  and my kids don't eat a lot. However, we loved it. Served the chicken with rice, and the extra sauce was delicious over the rice. Not a bad idea, as some have suggested, to brown the chicken first, or turn it over midway through.

Saw it in a magazine 
Made it because I had all the ingredients. So easy and so good.
I used skinless chicken legs, thighs and boneless, chicken breasts.
I served it with brown and wild rice. The sauce was great on the rice!
A definite keeper!

The sauce is really yummy. Next time I'll probably make it with boneless skinless chicken breast just cause I'm not a dark meat girl. But  really good recipe and super easy. Would probably be good on pork chops too. Only thing I did different was used sugar free apricot preserves cause I try to watch the carbs.will make again!

My family really enjoyed this chicken recipe as written. I will make this again, but I believe I will let it marinade a bit before I cook next time. The flavor is fantastic, I would love a little more of the taste throughout the meat.

Made this with only one change; I used Catalina dressing since that is what we had. It was really good, but very sweet. I might use chicken breasts next time.

I have made this twice, first time as writen and that way though it was 3 stars. Next time I added 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tbs of minced ginger and used Asian Sesame Dressing. I baked it for 1 hour, basted and then for another 15 minutes to get good caramelizing.

Delicious. Altered with Catalina dressing and turned over chicken then basted with 10 minutes to go, putting it in the top rack for those final 10 minutes. Served with white rice and orange slice garnish. It got good reviews here at home!

This was really, really good.  I followed the advice of a few others and used Catalina dressing instead of french.  Cut the sauce mixture in half for only 3 large chicken thighs.  So lots of sauce!!  Yum!!

I made this dish tonite and it turned out great! I made double the amount of sauce and poured it all in the pan with the chicken. After an hour, I turned the chicken and broiled for 20 minutes. The chicken was cooked through and moist. I used orange marmalade instead of apricrot and it was delicious!

My family has made this for years. The trick is making your own Russian dressing aka Thousand Island. Same thing. Have tried them all,(bottled), and always gone back to Mom's home made. 1/2 Heins Ketchup and 1/2 Miracle Whip. Trust me. Much thicker and tastier for this recipe.

Instead of apricot preserves, I used peach jam; for the French dressing, I used Italian; and for the dry onion soup mix, I used 2 T dried onion; and lastly, added some pepper.  I cooked the chicken in a skillet on the stove top with the dressing, turning the chicken a few times and basting it with the dressing.  I cooked it for about 1 hour 10 minutes and the chicken was falling off the bones.  I served it over rice and my husband, who will eat chicken if he has to, raved about how good it was.

My mom  made up a  recipe just like this years ago and named it Mrs.T Chicken for her last name. however, the only difference is we have always made it with Russian dressing instead. Always quick, easy, and delicious! This chicken dish is a keeper when you are in a squeeze for time.

I have made this exact recipe for years using Catalina Dressing and Cranberry Sauce... Thought I would try Apricot and French version. Very good and nice to have an alternative!  Either are delicious over rice, and even the pickiest of eaters will enjoy - if you don't tell what's in it!

It was a hit. I didn't have enough Apricot jam so I added fig and it was great. Next time I will skin the chicken as the sauce was very fatty.

i made this recipe verbatim and was thrilled with the flavor but disappointed in the thin sauce. I used chicken thighs, as recommended by some, and the sauce had so much grease in it that what didn't actually stick to the chicken, was very runny. Next time i'll try with breasts instead.

I really liked these thighs for something different.  Before I review it let me tell you I didn't have french dressing so I used "My Grandmother's French Dressing" from this site and omigosh....YUM.  Even if I didn't like this recipe I would have found another recipe by accident.  But I did. ....ok first I don't know who cooks 12 thighs at one time, if you have a family that big to cook for I'm jealous.  I only have 3 so I cooked 4 large thighs and changed my cooking dish accordingly.  I made the full batch of sauce because now I had 3 cups of french dressing and I would have had to use only 1/2 a package of onion soup mix.  Even though I try to save stuff like that I end up throwing it away and well I just made the whole batch.  I poured half over the chicken and baked for 50 minutes.  I removed them from their baking dish, put them on a foil lined cookie sheet, scooped some fresh sauce on top and baked them for 15 minutes longer.  Very tender, and a caramelized topping is what came out of it.

I was worried this recipe would be too salty with the dressing and onion soup mix, but it turned out great!  I served it over white rice, and my family seemed to really like it.  I used Catalina french dressing to give it a little extra flavor.  I like that I can throw it together in 5 minutes, then spend 45 minutes or so with my family before throwing together the rice and vegis (or, in other words, I don't spend an hour+ cooking on a weeknight).  Great recipe!

I went to get the ingredients for this recipe at the store, and when I got home I realized that I had forgotten the onion soup mix.  OOps.  So, instead, I used crushed red peppers just to give a little heat.  NOT A LOT. It was really good.  I would cook the chicken for an hour and a half to get the chicken more tender.  I will cook it again with the onion soup mix next time and see how that goes.  LOL

We have had this recipe for a long time thanks to my Aunt Ginny.  The only thing different is that  we serve it with rice and after the chicken is cooked, take the chicken out of the pan and thicken with a little bit of corn starch /milk.  Everyone likes the sauce on the rice.

I usually don't have luck when I bake chicken, it always seems to dry out. But this dish was so moist and juicy! I cut the recipe in half and put 6 skinless, boneless thighs in a smaller rectangular casserole dish. There was not a lot of space for the sauce to fall off the chicken, so it was baking in the sauce the whole time, yum! I baked it for a total of 60 minutes and flipped the thighs when there was 20 minutes left. I used 1/2 cup of creamy french dressing from Kraft, 1 packet of Mrs. Grass' low sodium onion soup mix, and 1/2 cup regular apricot preserves. My boyfriend loved it, I will definitely be making this dish again!

I substituted a lot over here! I did 4lbs of chicken wings and did 1 cup of Italian dressing. I mixed the dressing and preserves together in a both and poured over chicken. Then I sprinkled most of the onion soup mix on top. Baked on 400 for 55mins.

Great recipe, little to no prep time, minimal ingredients or you can add some as you please, and most of all delicious results.

I had none of the ingredients in the pantry so made a dash to the dairy got apricot jam, onion dip and there was no French dressing so the bottle of honey mustard had to suffice.
Threw the ingredients together with 50g of warmed butter and 2 1/2 Tblspns of black pepper for a bit of spice and it was amazing.

A massive thank you to those people who left reviews, very much looking forward to using this site as much as I can.

I followed another's advice and used catalina (French) dressing.  I had to scale back the ingredients because I had 2 big breasts instead of 12 thighs.  In doing so, I went heavier on the apricot to finish a jar of preserves.  It was quite tasty.  I presented it to my slightly picky husband as a sweet and sour sauce and he enjoyed it.  I want to try it with thighs eventually. While this recipe will not go into heavy rotation in my menus, it will be the one of the recipes I pull out when I'm sick of the same ole' same old.

This was awesome!  My kids (10 and 7) just loved it.  I thought I was making a lot of chicken but did not have any left over.  I made it exactly as listed except for the fact that I used Western instead of French dressing, as that is what I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I removed the skin on the chicken. The sauce was a bit watery but tasted very good over the jasmine rice. It was a quick and tasteful dinner. 
Thanks for sharing,

My mom has been making this for years - makes it in a big batch for parties & BBQs.  She always uses a red French dressing, like Catalina, and she lets the chicken marinate in the fridge at least over night.  It's great.  Recently she's been using boneless chicken breasts, cut into pieces.  You can feed a lot more people that way, just shorten the cooking time to about 30-40 minutes.

This recipe is really versatile. I had already started browning some chicken breasts on the stove when I decided to look for some inspiration.  I transferred the chicken to a casserole dish and used the pan to heat up the sauce and reduce it a bit. I used italian dressing, as suggested, and peach preserves instead of apricot. Poured the sauce over the chicken, covered with tin foil to keep moist and finished it on low heat in the oven. Served it with jasmine rice & green beans; it was delicious! Can't wait to try with chicken pieces; should be even better.

My mom cooked this for me for the first time years ago and I loved it, so I've been making it at least twice a month it since. We have always used pineapple preserves...so good! I also have used orange marmalade a few times when forced to go to a store that did not have pineapple preserves. Not as good as the pineapple, but very good. The chunks of pineapple in the preserves are what make it so good, so I plan on adding some fresh pineapple next time.

My review is for variations I made to this recipe based on ingredients I had on hand. Forgive me for tainting the review pool, but this is for cooks who make substitutions. I used thick chicken breasts (mistake) instead of thighs because I had them on hand. They turned out too dry. Maybe marinating them for a long time would have helped, or cutting them into strips like tenderloins. Also, I didn't have French dressing.. so I used what I had: a quarter cup of Italian and the rest of a raspberry vinaigrette. I didn't have apricot preserves so I used a jar of Orange Marmalade. The sauce smelled divine and tasted really good with my subsitutions, if only the chicken breasts didn't dry out. Don't do what I did unless you marinate for awhile or chop your chicken breasts into smaller pieces. In fairness to the original chef, I will make the recipe again as written and change my review at that time. I am hopeful it will be better.

We really enjoyed it...and this is despite some minor alterations.  I didn't have any french dressing, so I used a recipe I found on this site.  In addition, I don't have the patience to wait an hour, so I made it on a skillet instead.  Wonderful!

This is definitely a recipe to make again. Delicious! I made it with chicken legs and followed the other suggestions to bake covered for the first 30 minutes and turned the heat up to 400 for the last 15.

Love it!! This is the best "go to" chicken recipe ever! So quick, simple and delicious! I have two small children who don't allow me much prep time so this gets a home cooked meal on the table that my three year old will eat and husband loves!! I serve it with bob evans mashed potatoes and frozen brussels that are micro wave ready. Dinner in a snap and yummy too!!

Made this with chicken breasts in the crock pot. Didn't turn out as well as probably baking in the oven. The sauce was pretty sour, and the chicken too soft. I will try it the right way but still with chicken breasts next time.

Made this last night and was very happy! I added a few things just for personal preference like dash of garlic powder, crushed graham crackers to give "breaded" like so my 2 y/o would eat, and he did! Served over jasmine rice, filled house with awesome smell!

Very good, not too sweet.  The only extra thing I did was season the chicken with seasoned salt, pepper and galic powder.  Turned out great.  Will definitely make again.

I was a little worried about this recipe, because I thought the ingredients sounded weird together, but the recipe was super easy and super good.  It leaves a nice sauce to pour over rice too!

10 stars for being sooooo easy. I wish i could give 10 stars for taste too. Not sure what I expected from onion soup mix,french dressing, and apricot preserves, but was I was definitely surprised. Only had four thighs, so i reduced sauce to 1/3.  My husband, who doesn't like chicken very much at all, said he really liked it and wanted more. Next time I will make half recipe. I did turn oven up a little for last ten minutes to brown skin just a bit. YUM! YUM! YUM!

I actually used Russian dressing instead of French, and this was OK. I would have liked it to be a little sweeter, but it was great over rice. Definitely use thighs- they stay moist and tender!

This was a good recipe,and I enjoyed it...I have made chicken breast with just Sugar Free Apricot preserves and 2 large sweet onions browned the chicken a little and then added the presrves and onions.covered and cooked for about 45 mins.Low calorie and very good...I think it was a weight watcher recipe.

Couldn't be easier to prepare and absolutely delicious. The thigh meat fell off the bones. I served it over rice with a little of the sauce and some steamed veggies. It was a hit with every member of my family. Also, I thought it was very affordable to make.

ON A BUDGET? (arent we all nowadays?) WANT TO COOK TO IMPRESS??  WANT YOUR GUESTS TO THINK YOU COOKED ALL DAY … BUT YOU REALLY DIDNT?!?!?  THEN THIS RECIPE IS IT!!!!!!      Not only were the flavors absolutley amazing with this chicken, but it was so EASY, FAST and AFFORDABLE to make!!!  The chicken melted in my mouth and was so juicy and tender it just fell apart with a fork!! The chicken was the most expensive part at just under $6.00 for 12 boneless and skinless thighs!  The whole dinner (including garlic bread, cesar salad, and rice) costs less than $15.00 and easily fed 4 adults and had plenty of leftovers!!  I totally impressed my dinner party guests with this recipe and my 9 year-old son gobbled up some of the leftovers this afternoon for lunch!!  TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!    FIVE STARS ALL ACROSS THE BOARD!!!!   *****

Not bad, not great.  Somewhat similar to what I make.  Salt and pepper the chicken.  In the mixture I use thousand island dressing, double the amounts for preserves and dressing, brush on thights, legs or breasts, works on any cut of chicken, then pepper again and bake.  Have lots of sauce left over to dip the chicken in so have for the flavor for the middle, not just on the outside.

I've been making this for years.  I have even used it with pork instead of chicken.  It's great for company or just a family meal.  We make sure to have extra sauce to use as a gravy.

I was so excited to try this recipe based on the rave reviews of a friend, but I was saddly disappointed. This was way too sweet and not tangy at all. Next time, I will either add some cayenne pepper or hot pepper sauce and cut down on the jam......I may also use the Russian dressing suggested by another poster.

This was awesome! My kids absolutely loved it! I served it over rice. I didn't want to make changes my firt time making it but I kind of had to . All I could find that day was apricot/pineapple preserves...it was wonderful. I also had chicken breasts that I needed to cook, so I cut them in chunks and decreased the cooking time a little. So nummy! I would also like to try it next time w/ cut up pork and use a pince of cayenne for some sweet and sour pork...

I used boneless chicken breasts but otherwise followed the recipe.  The family liked it but it wasn't a huge hit.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for our liking.

We love this easy recipe. My husband is a "French Dressing" guy, so it has the taste he likes. I have made it with all thighs and with breast/thigh combo.

Great quick recipe. The kids loved it. I used chicken legs and thighs. I have also made in the past with sliced onions instead of soup mix which is also good. Thank you for sharing

I really liked this recipe even though the ingredients don't sound very appetizing.  My husband thought it was too sweet and didn't really care for it.  It only takes a few minutes to put together.

I made this recipe with Russian dressing and it came out excellent!  I baked the chicken pieces meat facing down for 30 min and another 40 min meat side up.  It was juicy and tender!  I will definately use this recipe again!

A very easy and tastey recipe. This would be good to bring to a pot luck. I used 6 large leg quarters and used orange marmalade because that is what I had on hand. The cooking time was about 1 1/4 hours. I also removed the skin before cooking and the chicken was very moist and the sauce was not greasy.

We love this recipie. I marinate it for a couple of hours before I cook it and it is so tender. I use chicken breasts instead of thighs and wings. We use it for small dinner with friends. Love it.

This made a nice meal. Everyone gave it a thumbs up. Very easy to make. I really like  the Chutney Chicken from this site but this was a nice change. I may add a little red pepper flakes &/or garlic next time to spice it up a little.

This was very tasty.  It has an almost Asian flavor to it, which could easily be played up with a little soy sauce and some creativity.  Yummy served with rice and sugar snap peas!

Turned out pretty good.  I used bone-in breasts, which were rather large, and it took a little over an hour to cook though.  I basted several times, and it made a nice glaze.

This recipe is super easy and THAT makes it appealing to me. I used thighs and removed the skins like some other reviewers did. The sauce cooked down, dark & delicious; I served it with rice. 
Next time I will try Russian Dressing to compare flavors. Adding fresh garlic is also good, as others have previously pointed out.
Thank you, Jeanne for an easy tasty family meal.

I only used 3 boneless chicken breasts.  I put the extra apricot glaze in the freezer for next time.

I've made it two times and each time it got great reviews.  Make sure that the chicken is a bit crispy on top.  I broiled the chicken the last 3 minutes since we like our chicken crispy.  It turned out great!

I made this today for Rosh Hashana. I made mine with Russian dressing. I used chicken tenders as I would have to be starving to eat thighs. Overall it is an okay recipe. I will probably make this again, esp. if I am in a hurry because it is so easy and fast.

This recipe brings back fond, delicious memories of when I was first learning how to cook many moons ago!  It's great to see it again.  Food doesn't have to be complicated to be delicious!  I've also made this with Russian dressing, with very tasty results.

Can it really be this easy? I used Catalina dressing and marinated the chicken drumettes for 2 hours in the fridge. It was deliciously sweet and apricot-glazed to perfection. We were licking our fingers! Thanks, Jeanne!

This was INSANELY good, and even better as leftovers -- the sauce just seemed to get tastier and tastier.  I didn't add or substitute any ingredients.  It also worked well in the crock pot.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for something new to do with chicken breasts.  My husbnad and I detested it, it was not what we were expecting.  The taste was strange, like something just wasn't right.  I gave it two stars only because our little boys liked it, they even asked for more.  Although, they ate it dipped in honey mustard. Just our opinion, but we won't make it again.

Excellent!  I was anxious to try this recipe after reading the reviews, but was hesitant to serve it to my husband & 2 kids.  I didn’t want them to see what the ingredients were since I knew they would form an opinion before tasting it.  Plus, I felt it was far too easy to be THAT good -- well… they LOVED it!  .  The only thing I added was a couple of cloves fresh minced garlic.  Also used a whole cut up chicken rather than thighs but only to cover my family’s taste preferences.  Thank you!

Apricot chicken that isn't too apricoty.  The french dressing adds a further dimension to the sauce, really quite good.

What could be easier and taste like you slaved over the sauce? This is excellent! I only use skinless, boneless chicken breasts, usually 6 to 8 of them, and there is plenty of sauce. (one hour at 350 degrees) I use Sweet Honey Catalina dressing instead of the French. We just love this! I usually serve this with fried rice although white is good too! Being a working mom I adore this recipe, even my teens can make this for us! Always line the pan with foil for easy cleanup.

A classic at our house. To cut down on calories, can half the sauce ingredients and still tastes great, and has less sodium.  Very tasty and easy: works for company but line pan with foil for easy clean up.

I thought this recipe was okay, but my mother LOVED it. Mom's opinion definitely weighs heavily, so I gave it four stars.  Keeping nutrition in mind, I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, fat free french and reduced sugar preserves (the sugar from the dressing was enough to compensate for the preserves while keeping it flavorful). Easy and good enough to make once in awhile, but not worth five stars...

This was quite good, but a little sweeter than I like chicken to be.  With steamed brown rice to sop up the sweet sauce it is good and we will make it again.  It is nice to make on a day when I have a lot of time to let it cook but not a lot of time to fuss with it in the kitchen. The actual "work time" is very quick.

Very easy and very tasty.  We used chicken breasts because we prefer white meat.  Nice with wild rice and a salad.

Very very yummy.  We make this all the time, it is fast and simple!!  We use breasts rather than thighs though, and serve it over rice.  I have made this for lots of gatherings and it is always raved about!

Incredibly delicious!  Have made it many times! Family and guests alike rave about it!  I serve it over steamed rice.  Sometimes I add green bell pepper and/or red bell pepper cut in 1" pieces.  Vegetables are not added until the final 15 minutes in oven.  Yummmm

I used thighs with bones and skin.  This was very good, and really easy, but I think next time I would use skinless chicken, because it was a little too greasy for me.  Probably 20 years ago I would have given it 5 stars cuz I wasn't worried about fat then.  hahahaha.  But I'll definitely make it again.

This is delicious! I accidently used catalina dressing, I only realized after I mixed it all up, and threw the whole lot in the slow cooker. Super tender with a great flavour. My toddlers couldn't eat it fast enough.

This is an oldie but goodie!  I used the French Dressing, but may try Italian next time to switch it up. I use an entire bottle of French, an entire jar of preserves, and the French Onion Soup Mix by Lipton’s.  Once it’s been well mixed, I separate 1/2 of it, put in a sealed container and freeze to make next time.  Great time-saver.   I start by putting the sauce in the bottom of a large Pyrex dish, then add the chicken ‘skin-side DOWN.’  I lift up the skin a bit so the chicken is almost immersed in the sauce. I bake for 15-minutes, and take some of the juices and pour over the chicken/baste. I did this twice = 1/2-hour. After the 2-times, I flipped the chicken over and cooked another 15-minutes, and again basted. I did this twice = 1/2-hour. At that point (1-hour), I put the chicken under the broiler for just a few minutes to get a lovely caramelization & crispier skin. I also add sliced onions and carrots to the bottom of the baking dish. Wonderful served with brown rice & steamed broccoli, pouring the apricot sauce over all. If it’s runny, add a bit of a cornstarch mix with some of the sauce to a pan, bring to boil to reduce & thicken.

Made exactly as directed. Had to cook it twice as long. I took it out of the oven after 60 minutes and it was raw on the bottom still. Not much flavor it could use some spices, and the sauce was too runny.

I've made this recipe many times since I first found it in 2014 & it's always delicious! I make it exactly as written, using bone-in/skin-on chicken thighs. I'm sure that it would be delicious with b/s breasts, as well, with a bit shorter cooking time & maybe covering the dish with foil for half of the cooking time so that the breasts stay moist. I've also made it with b/s thighs. A few times, when I've had it in the house, I'll mix  about 1/3 cup of pineapple preserves in with the apricot preserves.

I have been making this for 20 years. I use Russian dressing instead of French. My whole family loves it. The mixture goes great on a baked potato with some sour cream, too. Definitely the easiest, most tasty chicken recipe.

I have made this exactly as written and it was awesome. I have also made this in an instant pot using frozen chicken drumsticks (20mins manual plus 10min natural release) and it was perfect!

It was delicious! My family loved it. Instead of the red paper flakes I used cumin spice. My kids can not tolerate spicy food with the red flakes. I also added small potatoes that I cut in half. I sprinkled the seasoning over them too. Great meal and will make again!

Per other reviews, I used Catalina dressing. It was great! Very juicy & boiled the last 7 minutes to caramelize the sauce and crisp the skin. Browned the chicken thighs in a skillet beforehand. Added an almond-mandarin salad to compliment the apricot flavor.

Easy peasy recipe. Followed others advice: after cooking with Catalina, added toasted almonds and drained cubed pineapple for presentation. Also drained the sauce, and thickened it on stovetop with cornstarch, then served separately over chicken and rice. Very good. Only minor variations, skinless/boneless thighs, and apricot/jalapeno jam.  Will make again. Little leftover, so diced the chicken & pineapple for a nice lettuce salad on following day. Thanks!

In case anyone is wondering if you can use chicken breasts instead of thighs, here's the answer:  Yes, you can.  They were very tasty.  The baking time may vary, however, so use an oven thermometer with a probe to make sure they don't dry out.

I made this for my family and they said it was delicious. I used creamy Catalina dressing only because it was what I had on hand.  I will definitely be making this again.  Simple and quick.

Wonder Recipe! Super easy and delicious! Made with 4  large bone in breasts with skin. Marinated in Sauce for 1 hour. Placed on rimed sheet pan that was covered in Reynolds Non-Stick foil. Poured 1/2 sauce over chicken. Baked per instructions. Boiled remaining sauce for 15 mins. Used boiled sauce for dipping chicken into while eating. Leftovers were fantastic! Heated remaining two breasts covered in Casserole dish for 30 mins or so at 350 degrees. Nearly just as good the second time around!

I followed the recipe exactly.  Baked the chicken for an extra 5 minutes (65 minutes) as my family prefers it well done.  Everyone loved the results.  I intend to make it often.

I probably should not even rate this because I thought I bought apricot preserves and then realized when I was making it I bought orange marmalade. Hazards of shopping with three little ones. With that said, I was committed to this recipe and used the 1/2 c orange marmalade, 1/2 c Italian dressing, 6 chicken thighs and the onion soup mix. I served it over plain brown rice and my family loved it! It was like an sweet n orange chicken. I’ll make the correct recipe soon but this was good too!

One reviewer I previewed before making this dish stated ‘if you do not like the marinade then you won’t like the chicken recipe.’ I Totally agree! I love the Catalina dressing flavor and love apricot preserves, however after mixing this recipe together, I knew I was in for trouble. I did not care for this marinade and this did not like the  finished product. My husband kept commenting that he felt we were eating salmon as that is the color of the chicken- a pinkish salmon color. This one just wasn’t for our family.

This has been a go to recipe of mine for close to 40 years!  I use apricot preserves and for the last 10 minutes or so I put canned apricots and maricino cherries on top.  I serve it over rice with the sauce from the chicken. Yummy!

With only 4 ingredients, this was so easy to throw together! I didn't have Catalina or French so I improvised w Thousand Isaland and adjusted the other ingredients. I read the other reviews for tips and ended up using 8oz organic apricot spread (it had 8g sugar per serving - a lot less than more easily recognizable brands), 1/2 packet onion soup mix, 1/4 cup Thousand Island.  Mixed the sauce together, added 5 trimmed chicken thighs, mixed it well, dumped everything into a baking dish - uncovered. 45 min later, perfect, carmelized, browned on top, chicken. I would make this again exactly the same way! It was the right balance of savory with a touch sweet. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I was a bit skeptical due to the very few ingredients and how easy it was to make.  But it was SO good!  Very moist and tasty.  I used thighs with skin and bones (it looks like the recipe actually calls for boneless, skinless thighs), so it took a little longer to bake than 60 minutes.  But it was worth it.  Definitely a keeper - I'll make it again.

Delicious! I used sugar-free apricot reserves and substituted the dry Good Seasonings Zesty Italian dressing for the French dressing as noted by another. I added the requisite quantity of vinegar and excluded the  oil. Love this delicious and easy prep dish. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Shang!

the flavor was good, if a little too sweet.  I added a dash of wine vinegar, and then basted the thighs with more sauce as they rested just before serving.

I was excited to find this recipe as my mother made the dish quite frequently when I was a child. Very fashionable in the 1970's!  I always loved it but had totally forgotten about it. Tasted just like I remembered (I used French Dressing). I plan on giving it a go with the Catalina dressing. I did not have a problem with the sauce sliding off of the chicken but I also dried the chicken pieces well before coating with the glaze. I cooked the chicken in a 9x13 pan lined with foil sprayed with cooking spray. Clean up was removing the foil and tossing it away.

This recipe has been around for years. I first had it in the late 60s at a friends house. Coming from a Northern Italian family of great cooks, I’d never had anything like it before. When I asked for the recipe she laughed and was embarrassed to share it. She finally did. I was surprised by the ingredients and even more at how much I liked it because it wasn’t my style of cooking. I had been taught to cook everything from scratch with fresh ingredients.  
Years later, after I had forgotten all about it, I bought “The 3 Ingredient Cookbook” and this recipe was in it.  While I don’t make it very often, every once in a great while it’s fun to make if for no other reason than to bring back happy memories of old friends and old times.
 It still feels weird to use that orange colored French dressing, which I never buy unless I’m making this dish.  I’ve also used Catalina dressing, both good. I usually serve it with some kind of rice and fresh veggies.  You can make this with pretty much any cuts of chicken you want. If I was going to make it now, I’d probably Jazz it up with some fresh garlic and maybe a little soy sauce to give it more of an Asian flavor, since it’s almost like a retro Sweet & Sour Chicken anyway. It certainly couldn’t be any easier to make.

Love this recipe. It is great to have a chicken recipe with new flavors!  I cut the recipe down and made 4 chicken thighs. 1 of the things I did, was to put them in a baking dish that just barely fit the chicken thighs, I think this really helped make the sauce thicken up and not spread out on a larger pan and possibly burn. About 10 minutes before they were done, I basted them with some of the sauce. When they were done and I took them out of the oven, the sauce was so nice and thick.  I will make this again for myself and company, that is for sure!

Wonderful!  I used a peach/apricot jam because that is what I had.  Next time I will take the skin off the chicken so it isn't so greasy.

This was okay, not as good as I was expecting, but maybe that's because I made this over the stove as a stir-fry sauce with chicken breasts instead of in the oven. I used the red catalina dressing as others have suggested. I added veggies. It just tasted off somehow. I used a packet of onion soup that was a little larger than the one oz called for in the directions, and maybe that was the problem? Not sure but the flavor just wasn't that great and I probably won't try this one again.

I've been making this for the past five years and everyone loves it. I use skinless boneless chicken thighs and follow the recipe exactly and it turns out delicious.

The mixture turns into a nice sauce at the bottom for me that I spoon over the thighs.

2 stars for easy prep, but this dish was much too sweet for us.  Also the amount of sauce would be enough for double the chicken.

Very quick and easy recipe. I made it using Creamy French dressing, because I was shopping at Aldi and that was all they had. The sauce was surprisingly good! Could use a teensy bit of tweaking, maybe next time I'll try the Catalina like others have suggested. And brighten it up a bit with some fresh herbs at the end. Basted the thighs maybe three times during cooking. And I turned on the broiler for the last 5-10 minutes until the sauce got nice and sticky and just a bit crisp. Lined my baking pan with a double layer of parchment paper for easy clean up. You would NOT want to scrub off that mess later. Super easy dish that looks like a whole lot more effort than it was. Served with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli. The family deemed it a success!

Incredible. I used skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs and Catalina dressing. I cooked it at 425 for an hour,  basting it and draining some liquid off at halfway mark.

I've made this many times just as the recipe says except for 2 things.  The first time I made it I decided to do so at the last minute so my chicken was frozen.  I ran the chicken under hot water and put it in my electric frying pan I had heated to 350 degrees adding salt and pepper on both sides.  Then mixed the apricot preserves, French dressing and Lipton soup mix with my hand mixer and poured over chicken.  I covered and kept covered for an hour at 350 without lifting the cover!!  I served with rice and fresh steamed green beans and my kids LOVED it!!  Once I made it in the oven and the kids didn't like it as

I've made this sauce recipe many times for 4 chicken thighs, not 12.  That may be the problem 'Maddysmom' had with her execution of this recipe as written.  I made my 4 thighs with the same amount of sauce ingredients in an 8x8" pyrex casserole dish and it was delicious,...and I had plenty of sauce for the pasta, rice, or whatever medium you choose to serve it over. Depending on the size of the thighs,.. you can also use, a 9x9" casserole dish.  Update:  I made this again, this time, 6 thighs in an 11x7" pyrex casserole dish, and still have plenty of sauce,...as it was written.

I would definitely make this again. I was short on preparation time, made this according to directions, and served it with rice and broccoli. Dinner was ready with time to spare and everyone loved it! Only consideration I have is to use less dressing so the apricot flavor stands out more.

This is the only dish my mother knew how to make (she wasn't particularly domestic) and I still love it.  I make it with Catlina dressing now.  And I marinate the chicken in the dressing/preserves/onion soup mix mixture for about an hour before I stick it on the oven.  I serve it with rice and broccoli.   It's ridiculously easy and everyone loves it.

Very easy to make, and delicious. I seasoned the chicken before I put the sauce over it using a bit of rosemary, which worked great! Blended nicely with the sauce, but added its own flavor. Highly recommend.

I loved this recipe. 
My finicky daughter loved the sauce, but didn't like the texture of the chicken thighs.  Next time I'll use breasts.   This was yummy and I'll definitely make it again!  So simple and tasty!

Side note: I used light Catalina French dressing.  It turned out perfect in my opinion.

This was great.  I did not have the correct dressing so I subbed Kraft Fig Balsamic and it was excellent.  I was also short on some of the onion soup base so just added in some extra dried onion flakes.  Will do again.  Thanks!

While this is extremely easy, the French dressing taste was soooo strong, and I used an ordinary store-bought bottle, likely the same kind many other cooks would find. It tasted pretty good, but again, the dressing was very strong. Leftovers were also a big disgusting. The appearance of the sauce is not great to start with, and it smelled pretty nasty when I went to re-heat leftovers. 

I would not make it again. If you do make it, I really recommend using SKINLESS thighs, as the skin was not appealing at all. Soggy, not crisp, given how the recipe is made. I'd also suggest you try with Catalina, as some reviewers say it turns out better that way.

I made no changes but you know, it didn't need any. I made this recipe with homemade cranberry sauce at the same time, my wife doesn't care for as sweet a sauce with chicken. It too was just great, she absolutely loved it.

Everyone loved it!!!I made the recipe with the same ingredients as were listed on the site. I did use aluminum foil on the bottom and over the top. I basted the chicken twice--at the 1/2 hour and the hour mark. Then, I cooked it an extra 15 minutes with the aluminum foil off the top. So it was cooked for 65 minutes all told. I served it with a family size chicken Rice-a-Roni. My in-laws and my husband loved all the juice it made, but this was my one problem with the dish--it did create A LOT of juice which spilled on my shirt and in my car. When I make this again, I'll dump out some of the juice before I take it out of the house. All in all, though, it was very easy and  brought very good results. It will be in my rotation for sure.

This was delicious! And so easy! I did use chicken breasts instead because I have an abundance in the freezer right now. I baked the chicken for about 1/2 an hour first, drained the liquids, and then added the sauce and finished baking. Stays nice and thick that way. My husband was ranting about how good it was! Said it's one of his new favourite sauces, lol! 3 ingredients. I will try it with Catalina next time, but won't dare tell him I changed anything  ;)

I used apricot preserves, a wonderful Catalina dressing I found on Allrecipes, and as suggested, in lieu of onion soup mix I used 1/2 onion with chicken bouillon cube, onion powder and 2 minced garlic cloves.  I also added a few shakes of hot sauce for heat. I will definitely keep this one in rotation.

Excellent. But, instead of using French dressing I used a Pomegranate vinaigrette.

This was good!  I followed the advice of others and used a smaller pan and lined it with foil.  The chicken was moist and flavorful--thank-you for the recipe!

Made exactly as listed using boneless, skinless thighs because they are on sale often. Put it in an aluminum pan and cooked on the grill. My son said "it's a keeper

I've been cooking for three decades now and aside from desserts, I've never cooked with fruit. Just haven't been a fan of fruity dishes. So much so that I've never even flavored fish with lemon before. Well, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and this recipe was the guinea pig. I followed BRACKY189's advice and used Catalina dressing instead of French and I must say.........I don't know how the original recipe tastes but the tang from the Catalina mixed with the apricot preserves was AWESOME!!! Just make sure you DO cover the pan with foil during the regular cooking time then uncover for another 15-25 minutes to brown a little bit. This recipe has changed my entire perspective on fruit flavored cuisine.

Thanks for this recipe, it was so good that I ate too much of it, haha.. I used orange marmalade instead of apricots. I was skeptical three ingredients would be that good,but it was surprisingly delicious.

Much better with Catalina dressing than French!  I combine the dressing the jam and onion soup mix in a pot and bring to a boil and then pour over the thighs.

Easy and delicious! My boyfriend made this with California French dressing, and we didn't use as many chicken thighs--probably only 8 vs. the call for 12. Then we made baked potatoes and shredded the chicken to put on top of those. We're convinced that with a little bit of cayenne pepper this would make a rocking BBQ sauce!

This is pretty good, though very sweet and VERY high calorie. I think I would have liked it more with a little less of the sauce, and I recommend cooking it uncovered, maybe under a broiler, to sear it a bit.

I used what I had on hand, Orange Marmalade, Ken's Country French dressing, & Lipton onion soup mix. The really great thing is that it's quick, easy, & tastes great. Sweet & Tangy.

This was amazing.  I didn't have any issues at all.  The sauce was not too liquidy and didn't burn.  I used 5 large chicken breasts instead of thighs.  To decrease the fat and sugar I used triple fruit apricot spread and low cal Catalina dressing.  I added some salt, pepper and garlic salt.  It took only 40 minutes to cook trough with the breasts and was very moist.  We spooned the sauce over the chicken twice while cooking and turned the chicken once.  I will definitely make this again.

Hi, I just watched your video on how to make this lovely dish. I would like to know though, what you understand by french dressing, I only know french dressing as in salad sauce, i.e.: white and creamy. You pour in a dressing that looks like sweet chili sauce. Could you please write and tell me what ingredients are in your french dressing. I look forward to trying out your wings:-) thank you

I made this as per directions and with little expectations as apricot, French dressing and onion soup mix are not my favorite ingredients. We were surprised at how delicious this recipe was served with rice.  I even froze the dish, defrosted in the microwave then put it in a 325 oven for 30 minutes, wonderful!  Can't wait to make it again.

I have made this recipe many times over the years but have used Russian dressing instead of French.  My husband loves it and my grown children request it  when they come home.  Today I discovered that I was out of both Russian and French dressing but I had a jar of sweet and sour sauce which I used instead.  It came out great! My husband, who usually objects to changes in my recipes, didn't even notice the difference! This recipe makes a lot of sauce which we like to pour over rice.

This was OK. I saw the photo and decided to brown the chicken on the stove and took another reviewer's advice and cooked it for another 20  minutes on the stovetop in a dutch oven. I thought it was too artificial tasting with the onion soup mix and too sweet.

Although the flavors were wonderful I just could not get the skin to get a little crispy.  I even took and put on a cookie sheet to try and crisp but just couldn't without drying out the thigh. It was so moist and flavorful I would rather go without a crispy skin in favor of moist meat.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We really enjoyed this!  The sauce has a great flavor, it's very addictive. We used light Catalina dressing and cooked with pineapple chunks. The only thing I will have to figure out is how to get the sauce thicker. We used 6 legs and 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs and the meat was swimming in liquid. It was nice to have some extra to put on the rice though.  I'd say if you're making this with skinless meat, use less sauce. You could also make this in the crockpot and put the pieces in the oven for a few minutes right before serving to make the sauce stickier. Or make it on the stovetop the same way.

Definitely use boneless skinless thighs. Skin on is what makes too much clear liquid. It's too much fat. I left out 2 tsps of onion mix and 2 tbsp apricot preserves. Here's why. Baked as directed. Last few minutes switched to Broil and basted the leftover mix for few minutes to give it a nice browning. Love love this recipe.

Family loved this and it was so easy! My package of chicken thighs had nine pieces which filled the 9 x 13 casserole. I also took the skin off which was the most time consuming part. Followed the other ingredients exactly. Cooked about an hour. This is definitely going in the rotation (as requested by my daughter-in-law)!

A real kid-pleaser!  So easy - I baked as instructed but the family wasn't home, so continues to bake @ 250 for an addt'l hour - meat just fell off the bones and the kids loved it.  So you can technically make this ahead and just keep warm.  Keeper!

Very yummy!  The ingredients seemed to be a strange combination but we loved the end result.  Juicy and flavorful.  The only reason I gave a four instead of a five was that the onion soup mix gave it a little of a 'packaged' taste.  But, the convenience of using packaged ingredients is worth it.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!   I was out of onion soup mix so used finely chopped onion and mixed up my own simple spice blend of salt, pepper, paprika, garlic and a chili spice blend.  Was skeptical,  mixing french dressing and jam together, but it is so good. Served it with a side of roasted vegetables.   Perfect fall meal!  Will definitely make it again.

I make this on a regular basis an it has become a family favorite. I make it as written. The chicken is moist and it has a great flavor. I always have rice and a green vegetable with it. The sauce is great withe rice.

I made it with Catalina dressing ; the flavor was good it was very runny and the skin soft. I will try this recipe again. But with boneless, skinless chicken pieces.  I like that it was easy to make.

We tried this at our house but could not imagine the flavors working together: Catalina or French with the Apricot preserves sounded too sweet and the Italian with the Apricot just seemed wrong.  We liked the idea of the dish so we tried it using our homemade Ginger Soy salad dressing (though I am sure a store bought would work as well).  Thinking the Asian influence would work well with the Apricot and served over rice.  We choose Sugar Snap Peas and Carrots to round out the plate.  Even our picky eater liked this dish!

This is delicious!  I used Catalina and followed Bracky189's recommendations for cooking time and method.  I don't know why anyone would have a burned dish unless their oven is too hot.  I cooked mine a total of 1 hr. & 20 mins., turning after the 1 hr. period, and it was not over cooked, but tasty and tender.  I served over rice using the sauce for the rice.  I usually only like white meat chicken but this is just wonderful.  Thanks so much for a great chicken recipe!

My mother's been making this a long time, except she does hers in the crockpot and just throws everything in which is even easier! I've been meaning to try it with chicken breast to cut down on the grease a bit, because that's the only negative about this recipe! So yummy...even the kids like it! She serves it over rice. (Now I'm hungry lol)

I tried this recipe using boneless chicken breasts. Baked it for 45 minutes. A little dry, but the flavor was very good. Also, took the advice of one review and used Catalina dressing. Would try it again with thighs.

I liked the fact that it was quick and easy to prepare. and very tasty. I did taste the sauce before putting it on the chicken and decided to add a tablespoon of lemon juice to cut the sweetness. Served with rice and fresh green beans. It was a big hit with the family.

Great recipe, made better by tossing the thighs in seasoned flour (your choice: cayenne, chili powder, cumin, curry, paprika, tumeric--whatever)... Heat oil in a frying pan, brown & render the thighs... then follow the recipe as written -- or julienne onion & bell pepper, lay it on top of the chicken in the baking dish, pour the sauce (love the catalina) over the whole deal, (saving 1/4cup) ... Cook covered for an hour ... uncover pour over remaining sauce ... broil for 5-10 min... mmmmm... serve w/ couscous...

Followed the recipe to the letter and found that it didn't have the greatest taste.  I was surprised.  I expected lots of flavor from these ingredients.  Overall, it was rather flat and uninteresting.  I'd be interested in trying this again, though, and modify according to the suggestions of others.  So not bad, but just not wonderful.

The whole time I was making this, I was thinking, this is gonna be awful-even when tasting the sauce mix before putting it on the chicken-I must say I was pleasantly surprised!!  I used boneless skinless thighs, and some store brand sweet and spicy french dressing-delicious!!!

Made this one last night for myself and the kids.  Got rave reviews!  Took user suggestions and used Catalina dressing.  Halved the recipe for just the three of us.  Everything came out great and my lunch leftovers were awesome too!

Thanks for a great recipe to put into rotation!

Made with fresh apricots, and used 1 cup apricots to 3/4 cup sugar. Tasty but runny, so I add 2 chopped green peppers and serve over rice.

This is good.  I wasn't impressed, but it was a nice change anyway (and it takes a lot to impress me).  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and only cooked them for about 40 minutes.

Delicious and so easy!  Since I baked 8 thighs i/o 12 I cut back the time to 45 minutes then followed another reviewer's advice and flipped the thighs, basted and cooked an additional 20 minutes.  the sauce was a bit runny so may try adding some cornstarch next time.

Had been looking forward to trying this recipe for sometime and today was the day. SO disappointed.  I followed directions exactly but used Catalina dressing as others suggested.  No flavour and the sauce was way too runny. It would not stick to chicken. I ended up pouring sauce into small pot and adding 2 T of cornflour to thicken. Even with this addition the sauce was runny. Would not make this again.

This is a great recipe! I usually don't buy cicken thighs, but bought some on sale. I used this recipe as a base- I used Sweet Honey Catalina dressing, onion and garlic powder instead of onion soup mix, and added a splash of liquid smoke and worcestershire. I also chopped some dried apricots and threw them into the sauce. So good! My family of boys ate them up!

After reading the reviews i decided to use boneless skinless chicken thighs that I cut up. Then I made the sauce and let the chicken marinate for 2 hours and baked as directed. This was great diner that my extremely picky 2 year old even enjoyed.

Delicious Apricot Chicken!! I really enjoyed the flavor and tenderness of the chicken. I personally used boneless chicken in place of chicken thighs & I added some pineapple juice from a can, to give it that extra sweetness. Great Recipe!! Did not realize how well french dressing goes with apricot preserves. Awesome!!

I also used Italian dressing in place of the French dressing.  I did not use a package of dry onion soup mix, as I was out.  I did add cracked black pepper (to taste).
This marinade/sauce has a subtle flavor that does not overpower the dish.  I would say that it turned out very nice!

Tried this last night, was not sure of the unusal combiniation of ingredients, but it was awesome!! I substitued apricots for marmalade because I didnt have apricots, and I made the dressing from scratch since you only need a cup. I also pre-seasoned the meat with cayenne pepper, salt, pepper and garlic powder. I baked for 30 mins covered and 30 mins uncovered. I imagine if you marinated it, the flavour would soak in that much more, but I didnt have time and it was still soooo delicious! This is a keeper*

I subbed homemade orange marmalade, homemade onion dip mix and homemade Catalina dressing. Also marinated for four hours. This elevated the lowly chicken thighs I used to a high level of perfection. Served with risi y bisi. It freezes well, too. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Will def. make again and again. Impressive dish!

This was an easy recipe. I changed it from 12 to 6 so I did half of everything. I also covered the chicken for 30min and then uncovered it for 30min while it cooked. It was an easy recipe to cook during the week and my family really liked it, so I will be using it again.

I wish it the chicken would have taken more of the taste so maybe Ill try marinating it next time. Other then that I really liked it!

The sauce on this recipe is so delicious and easy to make.  I used 8 chicken thighs since that's all I could fit into my 9 x 13 pan.  I had plenty of sauce to pour over rice.  This also keeps well if you have any leftovers.  The only drawback is that chicken thighs are a bit greasy, but they sure are good with the sauce. :)

It was ok. I added pinapple towards the end as others had suggested and was a nice additional flavor.  My husband said he would eat it again, but it wasn't even close to a "favorite".  I probably won't make this again...

My great grandmother had a recipe just like this, but instead it calls for Russian dressing, my family has been making it for years! We enjoy it everytime! Another great thing- super easy, which is one of the best parts about it!

This tasted just ok to me. The main flavor in the dish to me was the onion mix, which seemed kind of overpowering. Maybe if I had halved the amount, it would have been less oniony. I was hoping for more of a sweet, tangy flavor.

Made similar and it is easy good and best with rice I use both the chicken breasts boneless and thighs and it blend well with both sides if company is coming.  I have doubled sauce before to serve over the rice.  Never had a complaint

I have made this dish a multiple of ways. Have used orange marmalade in place of the apricot preserves, and used Russian dressing.  Very versatile.

I ended up making this with Zesty Italian Dressing instead of French. It was great. The only reason why this got 4 stars is because I think I'm realizing I'm not a thigh fan.. I would definitely make this with chicken breast though.

I loved this recipe! I give it only 4 stars tho cuz I changed the dressing and the preserves, so it might have come out differently with the original. I used balsamic vinegarette and apricot pineapple preserves (and half a packet onion soup mix). I only made 6 chicken thighs, but used the same heat times, maybe 5 minutes less and added pineapple chunks to the sauce. It was very sweet but me and my husband have an insatiable sweet tooth so it was delightful!!

I love that this was sooooo easy to prepare!  I followed the recipe, using the Deluxe French dressing (my grocery store also had a Sweet & Sour French dressing... I wasn't sure which one to use).  The taste was good, but not "wow!", however, everyone in my extended family, including my 14yr old son, loved it.  I found that the inside of the chicken was moist but not very flavorful.  Otherwise, the sauce tasted yummy.

I've made this before to rave reviews..even my critical parents loved it! Lol  I tweaked it a little bit...used chopped onions instead of the dried onion bits in the soup mix, added some chili garlic sauce and rice wine vinegar to cut the sweetness...this is an easy and delicious recipe!

I'm giving this one 4 stars b/c my boyfriend really liked it, but I just thought it was okay.. I added chili paste to make it a little spicy, but that was the only thing I changed. I wasn't a huge fan of the color either.

Every year Rosh Hashana is at my house in the fall. It's the Jewish Newy Year so it's traditional to make sweeter dishes for a "sweet" new year. I get requests for this dish every year from my family. It's very easy, could be a weeknight dinner, so I'm happy to make it for the holidays! It always comes out moist and yummy.

Very good... good balance of savory and sweet in this dish.  I used apricot sauce and subbed individual spices for the onion soup mix (paprika, garlic powder, etc.).  I controlled the salt better that way.  Also added some worst sauce, a little red wine vinegar, and some sugar.  I also chopped up about 1/2 cup of onion and added it to the sauce.  I just wish there were some way to make the skin crispier.  Perhaps a higher heat or broiling?

Super easy and very tasty. We made this with boneless thighs and served with wild rice to soak up the sauce. I made a little more sauce than the recipe called for. The kids liked it too which is a big plus.

This is a wonderfully simple and easy recipe.  I used 3 chicken legs, took the skin off and separated the thigh from the drumstick.  I used 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix, and eyeballed 1/2 cup low fat California dressing and 1/2 cup of crabapple jelly as this is  what I had on hand.  Delicious!

Very tasty and simple to make.  I used homemade French dressing... I probably could have made it without the oil since the sauce was unnessarily oily.  I removed the skin from the chicken thighs, which I recommend.  It was great with rice!

I'd prefer not to rate this recipe because I twisted the original beyond recognition and don't think it would be fair to rate it (however, "n/a" is not an option).  I recently moved to a country where I do not speak the native language, and could not find most of the ingredients required.  I did use apricot preserves, but could find neither french or russian dressing, or anything remotely similar.  I ended up marinating the chicken in a sweet apple-viniagrette dressing (getting the idea from a previous reviewer who used a bit of apple cider vinegar), then mixing it with "yogurt" based dressing, and ~1tbsp of onion soup mix (I had to guestimate on what an ounce would be).  I used skinless, boneless, chicken breast strips, and cooked in a gas oven at 200ºC for 30 minutes, stirring once halfway.  I served it over brown rice and it was extremely nice, and reheated well the next day as well with plenty of chicken and sauce for rice left over.  I would make this again, maybe the 'correct' way once I move back to the U.S. or find somewhere to get the ingredients :)

I had high hopes for this one, but it was just OK for me.  I know some reviewers said it was better with Russian dressing, maybe that was the problem, I used the French dressing.  My son did not like it at all, but he's 10 and picky, so I wasn't surprised.

I used chicken leg quarters with this, and increase the temperature about 10 degrees, and cooking time to a little over an hour.  This was yum yum yum.  Chicken very moist, and my hubby, who is usually not really into leg quarters, went back for seconds.  Thanks for a great recipe I will use again!

Delicious & easy dish for weeknights. I have to keep my eyes open for sales on Apricot Preserves so I always have it on hand! 
I didn't want to turn the oven on, so i cooked it on the stovetop on med-low. Lots of sauce, Maybe I can do with less preserves & Dressing next time.

This was so quick and easy!  Any recipe that gets my kids to eat and ask for more is worth 5 stars!   Chicken was so moist and full of flavor!  I poured the preserve/dressing mixture over the chicken (pierced with a fork) and it sat covered in the refrigerator for about 5 hours before baking. Next time I will use chicken breasts.

I've made this recipe for my family several times.  Sounds gross but is very tasty!  We love it.  I've told many friends about it.

My entire family absolutely loved this dish, just the way it is!(french dressing and all)  Even my 20 month old said "mo" and had a second helping.  served sauce over rice and the whole family gobbled it up.

Really good.  I only had Western dressing and Peach Preserves, and it came out perfectly.  The chicken (breasts) ware juicy and tender, just right!  I served with rice on the side.  I think if you pour it over the rice, every bite would be too sweet, so the savory rice helped to balance it.  You'll enjoy this very fast/easy dish!

I thought this dish was very bland...not enough taste.  And the chicken skin came out rubbery...not crisp.

This was fast and easy to make and delicious. I made this for a cooking club that I belong to and it was completely gone when I went back for seconds. Everyone enjoyed it,  even the kids. My daughter is a picky eater when it comes to chicken but she sure enjoyed this. The sauce is excellent over rice. A keeper!!

Pretty good, but not great.  The onion soup mixed with the french dressing had an aweful smell.  It faded once it was baked, but still didn't smell great.  I cooked it for 1 hour, but the chicken was undercooked.  I ended up having to put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes.  I made it with chicken thighs, with the skin, so that could be why it took longer to cook.  I may make this again, but maybe try it with boneless skinless chicken breats instead.  It was definitely easy to make though, and that was nice.

Very yummy and oh so moist! Had this for a dinnerparty. Made a pan of thighs and a pan of breast (with skin) soooo good!-Doubled the recipe. Served it with steamed rice and creamed spinach. Got RAVES from my guests. 
I will try it again with Russian Dressing.
