This is almost perfect chili!  It's savory and tangy with lots of flavor.  The small changes I made were to use ground turkey which I cooked in fajita seasoning with a little chicken broth and olive oil.  Then I tossed the turkey mixture into the crock pot with the onions and the rest of the ingredients (did not use water and for beans I used one can of pinto, one can of black beans and one can of cannelini).  I also used one can of Ro*Tel with habanero and cayenne pepper with sea salt to taste.  After 30 minutes, I mixed the chili up then let it cook about 3 and half hours (you could do 8 hours but it isn't necessary).  It turned out so good the husband says I could win a chili competition with it!  Thanks for posting a great recipe!

I made this recipe 2 different ways.  I was on the hunt for a great chili recipe I could try as beans and no beans and using ingredients I had on hand. The batch with the beans I had to substitute the ground chicken for stew meat.  The second and no beans chili, I used ground beef.  I did amp up the spices to taste.  This was a fabulous recipe.  Both chili's came out most holy delicious!!!!  3 hrs high was perfect time in the crock pot for both.  I'm so glad I tried this and know I will be making this again and again!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing xoxoxoxoxoxo

Chilly Day Chili Haiku: "This was just alright. I'm not saying it was bad, just not outstanding." So I'll make and eat just about any variety of chili, and some blow me away, some are OK, but w/ a sprinkle of cheese, some fritos, and a squirt of Siracha sauce, I'm usually happy. This particular chili (which I followed as written, except using ground beef instead of chicken) was tasty, but not one that I think I'd make again, perhaps due to the vinegar/brown sugar taste, I'm not sure what it was, but it didn't satisfy my chilitch.

The only change I made was using 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb ground beef. 

I did have to add about 1 cup extra water during the cooking process (crock pot), but this recipe is really good. I enjoyed that it was a little bit different from the normal chili that I make. The chili powder gives it just the right amount of kick! And if you're like me, I add some cheese and sour cream on top to give it a little cooling sensation. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks for sharing!

This is the second time I've made this chilli for my family. I added a bit of garlic, chushed chilli and some pickled jalepenos for a kick.

The family loved it, and said it's better than beef chilli.

This is a keeper recipe.

This is a good recipe.  I did have to add more salt, chili powder and pepper.  I also added garlic powder and cumin.  And a can of tomato soup.  I always add that.

Excellent recipe. I omitted the tobacco; replaced with half a habanero pepper finely diced. Used 2 very small cans of green chili’s. Used 7 large cloves of fresh garlic. Used 2 cans white beans in mild sauce, 1 can chili bean in spicy sauce and 1 can chili beans in mild sauce. Omitted beer; replaced with water which was used to dissolve 4 teaspoons of beef base ( as opposed to beef cubes). Used 4 cans of diced tomatoes 14.5 ounces each. Used only 2 teaspoons of chilli powder because I used beans with seasoned sauce. I also omitted the cumin for the same reason. I doubled the salt, and bacon. Added a bit more black pepper. Omitted oregano; didn’t have it. Note: I bought ground beef in packs that were slightly over 1 lb each. And I used 24 oz of Italian sausage.  Many people have modified this recipe. I don’t think you can go wrong with this recipe. It’s a great base.

I made this chili and loved it. However, I deviated from the main recipe. I added chicken broth instead of water. One pound of ground chicken and one pound of  ground turkey. I doubled the amount of chili powder and cooked it for 5 1/2 hours instead of three hours it was very flavor and good. I absolutely loved it and would recommend to make it the way I made it. #Yummy!!!

I made this chili with ground pork but didn't put in the brown sugar (I'm diabetic so I can't have a lot of sugar) but I also used my -pot and this came out wonderful!!! My husband and I loved it! And I will make this again.

Made this in the slow cooker similar to Maralina's method. Browned ground turkey with a taco seasoning packet, then added everything else to a crocpot. Substituted chicken broth for the water. Cooked on low overnight. Turned out delicious!

Love this recipe, the flavour is homey and lightly tangy. Skip the sugar, double or triple the beans with a variety, add tomato sauce and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.

This is one of thoes great recipies that is wonderful exactly as written and also lends it self to customizations. I've made this over and over again and every time it's a hit with my family.  Our favorite modifications are as follows; replace the ground chicken with 1lb ground turkey and 1lb spicy turkey sausage. Then replace the Pinto beans with 2 cans kidney beans drained and rinsed and 2 cans chili beans with juices. We like our chili a little spicy so I add 1 or 2 chopped and seeded japlenos and keep the rest of the spices and tomatoes as written.  This is excellent served over white rice.
