I liked this recipe and plan to make it again.  It is a simple and delicious side dish.  I saut√©ed the brussels sprouts in butter (not margarine) and didn't use shallot or onion.  Instead, I just sprinkled some onion powder on them.

Hard to believe, but the Brussels sprouts I used on this mid-November evening were those Hubs picked from our Wisconsin garden just this morning. Tender and sweet, I didn't want to bury their delicate flavor with heavy sauces, cheese or spices, so this recipe suited them well.  I used shallots rather than onions and butter rather than the "spread," which probably elevated this recipe a star or two.

This is an easy and tasty receipt.  I made a couple minor adjustments.  My family like the Brussels Sprouts to have kind of a bit, so I cooked in salty water for 3 minutes (after halved) then put them in cold water.  I used a couple cloves of minced garlics instead of shallots/onions.  I also toasted 1/4 cups of almonds and mixed them with the sprouts just before serving.   Every one loves the veggies!
