Made these several times.  They freeze beautifully and after finding some after 6 months in the freezer, they were still delicious.  Wonderful dark chocolate cherry cookie for the Christmas Cookie Tray!!!

Really good cookie-I used a version of this recipe that makes these cookies chocolate by adding in 1/3 cup cocoa powder.  I also made the chocolate frosting by melting 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips with 2/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk which made it nice and creamy.  I will definitely make these again.

I just tried this recipe out today. I doubled it, but needed to add more butter and a third egg for there to be enough moisture. They turned out pretty nice. I have posted the first photo for the recipe, just waiting for it to be added to the site.

Very tasty cookie.  I put the chocolate condensed/ milk mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a star tube and "buried" the cherry that way.  Very pretty.  I included them on a cookie tray for a party and got lot's of compliments.  I will make these part of my Christmas baking tradition.  Thanks for sharing!

Made these last night. Instead of using cherries, I filled with blueberry preserves. An easy and yummy cookie to make. I doubled the recipe and came out with about 36 cookies so I think I need to make them smaller next time. Buttery and light and very sweet.

These turned out very good! A really good Christmas treat. Also made some with caramels instead of Cherries.

These cookies were really easy to make and I had everything already in the house which was nice.  My kids weren't 100% thrilled by this recipe but I definitely enjoyed a dessert that went beyond chocolate chips and the combination of cherry and almond was delicious.  Will be adding to my holiday routine definitely!!!

The cookies were pretty good, I did make some modifications to the frosting while I was making it though. I increased the sweetened condensed milk to at least 1/3 cup to make it creamier and more manageable, and added a bit more cherry juice. I also cut the corner off a ziploc bag and used that to pipe that the frosting onto the cookies which worked really well. Overall I think the chocolate was too bitter for me though, next time I will probably use semi-sweet chocolate instead!

These cookies are very good.  I used my 2 tbsp scoop, which really does make 1" balls, and came out with 55 cookies.  Even at that small size, I cooked them for about 18 minutes, probably because we like our cookies at little crispy.  I also used cherries that I bought at Family Dollar.  They are small, 36 in a 7 oz. jar, but where perfect for the small cookies.  I used more cherry juice with bittersweet chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk mixture to make a very thin frosting and drizzled it on top of the cookies.  Very pretty.

Maybe I did something wrong with this recipe, I'll try it again and make sure.  Thanks for the recipe.
