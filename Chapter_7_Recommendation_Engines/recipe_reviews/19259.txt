Very good cookie.  I'd say the best cake-mix cookie I've made off this website. It is an oily batter and I think the cooking time needs to be increased by 2-3 min. or else you get a very wet, moist cookie that collapses when you pick it up.  I use large walnut size dough balls and bake it for about 13 min.  Even with this cooking time, the cookies still comes out super moist and stays pretty moist for a few days. I think the recipe could take less oil - 1/4 - 1/3 cup should be enough.  Overall, very fudgy and moist and the only cake-mix recipe that actually taste homemade. I will make this recipe again.

While these can't compare to a homemade chocolate cookie, I'll give them four stars keeping in mind they're a cake mix cookie.  They're chewey, and definitely "moist."  I'm just not sure if they're "fudgey" or "greasy."  The taste is okay, especially since I added 1 tsp. of chocolate extract, but I find the oily dough off-putting to begin with, and the finished cookie is just a little more "moist" than I would like. Maybe cut back a little on the oil to, say, even 1/3 cup?

I made these cookies about a month ago and they were delicious! I tried making them again and substituting applesauce for oil, and they did not turn out.

I used the Betty Crocker Super Moist Devil's Food Cake mix, and cut up a Ritter Sport Dark Chocolate bar into small chunks and the proportions were perfect. The cookies were vert moist, fudgey and almost melt-in-your mouth good. Thanks for this quick and wonderful recipe!

I was craving cookies but had no Brown sugar.  I found this recipe and I used 1/2 cup no salt butter, added 1 Tbs. oil, a pinch of salt and 1 tsp. vanilla.  The batter is very stiff and you have to use some muscle if you mix them by hand. They turned out very good, but they are rich so make sure to eat them with a hot cup of java or cold glass of milk.

Made this cookie exactly per recipe.  They came out great.  The yield was approx. 32 cookies.  Wife and son both loved them.  Will deff. make again.  Maybe coat the dough balls with powdered sugar per other reviewers thoughts to make a chocolate crinkle type of cookie.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is extremely easy to make, and you can add a lot of variety by adding nuts and other ingredients like peanut butter chips, toffee chips, and white chocolate chips.  I had to bake them an additional 2 minutes (12 minutes in all) to get them to stick together.  They taste like a fudgy brownie when they are done!  I will definitely make these again.

This recipe was just what I needed.  I had misplaced my mothers "saucepan fudgie" cookie recipe.  It was a great replacement and I didnt even need to use a double boiler.  I just rolled them in powdered sugar and they were beautiful!

This was the first time I tried cookies made from cake mix, so I had no expectations. I was quite impressed. For the simplicity of these, they are a 5 star cookie. I left out the chocolate chips. Total, this yielded 30 cookies for me. 10 I left as is, 10 I added pecans to, and 10 I rolled in powdered sugar. I took them to a neighborhood party and the powdered sugar ones were gone in less than 30 minutes. I did half of the cookies in a ball, as directed, and half I smushed down a little with a fork. The ones left in a ball were more like cake, the others I smushed were more cookie-ish. All were delicious. I will absolutely make this recipe again.

I made them just as recipe calls for and the family loved them--liked how they just melted in their mouth!  Greasy to roll but not greasy tasting at all.  I think pecans or walnuts would make them even better.

Loved these cookies, but trying to cut calories, so substituted 1/2 c lowfat plain yogurt for 1/2 c veg. oil. Bake for approx. 12 min. on greased cookie sheet and voila! Recipe made 30 cookies at only 103 calories each! Thanks for the great recipe!

I first made this according to the ingredients listed, using just a little less than 1/2 cup oil.  They were just okay - I didn't care for the devils food taste.  I made them again a week later, same way, but used dark chocolate cake mix instead of devils food....WOW!! They are awesome!!!!  Definitely going to make these a lot!

I am not a baker much more a cook.  Nothing I ever bake turns out right.  These cookies are fantastic!!  I don't use all the oil usually 1/3 cup is fine.  I have made these added a little mint extract to them before.  I've also done similar ones with lemon cake mix and a peanut butter version.  I work with mostly men and have made bags of them to bring to work.  They are gone so fast I could barely get one to go with my coffee. Even my boss stole the rest of the bag to keep in his office.

So around Christmas time I was able to get my hands on a bunch of bags of the mint and chocolate chips.  Everybody LOVES them!  I just put a cup of them in instead of a cup of the chocolate chips.  Oh and I buy plenty of bags to last me well into the new year.

These were okay.  I agree with other reviewers to reduce the oil to 1/3 cup and increase cooking time.  For a "cake cookie" their fine but like someone else said, they don't beat a homemade cookie recipe.

Fantastic! I make these all the time now and get asked for the recipe often. The only changes I make is that I omit the chocolate chips (they're chocolaty enough without them) and when possible, I use melted butter instead of the vegetable oil. For some reason, the oil seems to make it more crumbly. I also like to add in a bit of coffee, a splash of vanilla or a bit of cinnamon if I'm feeling frisky. And since this makes a lot of cookies, I like to bake half the batch for 15 minutes instead of 10, giving me a crunchier cookie and more snacking options.  =)

I used less oil 1/3 cup canola oil, and I added peanut butter chips for contrast.  These came out great.  You need to mash them a bit before they bake.  They spread out instead of up.

I just wasted a bunch of perfectly good ingredients and a whole lot of time to make these cookies for last minute Christmas gifts. I made them exactly according to the recipe 20 minutes ago. They taste like clay and they smell like vegetable oil - nothing else. Allrecipes lets me down...yet AGAIN.

All I had was a Gluten/Peanut/Allergen free chocolate cake mix.  It mixed a little dry so I added 1/2 cup water and it was absolutely perfect.  I dipped each cooled cookie in powdered sugar and my family pretty much ate the whole batch!  Loved it all!

YUM!  Quick and easy.  I agree too that it needs less oil.  I like the idea of rolling them in confectioners sugar.  I added 3/4 bag of milk chocolate chips and would do that again.  I also pressed them down slightly with a fork.

Easy and an awesome chocolate fix! I made mine with white chocolate chips, added a little vanilla, pressed the dough balls down a little with the back of a spoon, and baked them for 12 minutes.  I was skeptical, but they taste rich and chocolaty with a soft, chewy texture.  Thanks for the idea!

I just made this recipe today and they taste great. Not greasy like other cookies are. I made them with chocolate chips. Also bought peanut butter chips to mix with the dough. So I had peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies.  You can also just mix almonds or walnuts. Experiment with your own toppings. It's great for kids can do too!

These are so very easy to make and they taste like heaven! We were eating them out of the oven. Since Christmas is almost here our next batch is going to be made with peppermint chips. You cannot go wrong by making these cookies!

Onolicious!  I always wanted to try a cake mix cookie and today I did.  I adjusted the oil to 1/3 cup per reviews and added chocolate chunks.  I also rolled some of them in powdered sugar for the crinkle effect as one reviewer mentioned they'd do.  Family loved it!  It's soft and sweet.  3 dozen in my batch.

These cookies were quite good. They were chocolately and perfectly rich and moist. I will definitely make again. I might even add some pecans or peanut butter chips.

I did not have a chocolate cake mix so used yellow and put 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa mix. Turned out so great! Would definitely make again.

The first time I made it I thought it was great, but more cakey and less fudgey.

My kids freaked. These were so good. Like brownies but cookie-ish. And SOOO easy to make. A friend made these for a church bake sale and they were the first to disappear. Seriously. Try them.

I think my main issue with the recipe was the vegetable oil. It could be I used a particularly pungent vegetable oil, but the taste and smell completely overwhelmed the chocolate, even after baking. I ended up throwing out the rest of the batter after the first two batches.   I gave the recipe another shot though, and used melted butter in place of the oil. They turned out great! They're soft, flavorful, and tasty. Yum.

ya... so this certainly calls for too much vegetable oil.  you can get away with just 1/3 c of oil.  I also rolled them in balls and then in powdered sugar to add the crinkle effect.  They came out good, my brother who doesn't have a sweet tooth actually enjoyed them.  Who knew all it took was a box of cake mix... kids...

Very easy, quick, tasty cookies. I agree with a previous note - the cookies do need to bake for about 13 minutes. it makes about 3 dozen cookies. I will definitely make these again!

Very good cookie recipe.  I was concerned at first at how oily it was once I mixed the batter but once it came out out the oven and cooled, it was perfect.  So soft even days later.  This recipe is perfect when you want to make cookies with very little ingredients.

very disappointed in this recipe, I thought I could use a short cut making cookies, but this was not worth it. the cookies looked better than they tasted, not chocolate enough and texture unappealing.

Great!  Made them slightly smaller than suggested, and they turned out nice and crisp on the edges, soft (but not gooey) in the middle.  The five minutes on the tray after baking seems to make a big difference.

My mom always used this recipe to make "Homemade Oreos" and put 2 together with frosting in the middle.  I decided to make my own version this time!  I didn't want them quite so greasy so I reduced the oil to 1/3 c.   I took the balls of dough (made them a lot smaller) and put them in mini muffin tins.  Then I used extra yummies in them to give some variety.  Here are some of the things I tried: Hershey's Kisses pushed into the middle, including a variety of minty holiday flavors, cinnamon chips, a sprinkling of cinnamon, sprinkle of sea salt...the possibilities are endless!  And the muffin tin size is adorable.

Delicious! I added 1 1/2 c of chocolate chips instead of just one. My husband asked me if I got the recipe from his mother- which means he thought they were fabulous, too! I like this recipe because there is so much less mess than making conventional cookies.

Simply fabulous!  These cookies are about the easiest things on the planet to make.  I would suggest doubling the recipe if you have more that about 3 people in the family because they won't last more that a couple of hours.  :)

Well this has been made in our kitchen twice in 2 days. First time was for one of the last minute late at night "mom, I forgot....I'm supposed to take cookies for a thing at school tomorrow"....never having tried these, but having everything on hand, I thought, 'why not?'....well let me just say, they were one of the best and the easiest cookies ever made. Glowing reviews are here for a reason. Next night, a little get together with friends...what to take? hmmmm... a no brainer, this is my new, go to, gotta have it now recipe.  I used BC triple choc. fudge cake mix and ghiradelli semi-sweet chips. Thanks Kalsmom!

I made this recipe for the first time today.  My husband really liked them and I thought they were good.  I couldn't find a packaged cake mix that was 18.5 oz.  The largest I could find was 16.5 so that is what I used.  I did cut the oil to 1/3 cup. They were not oily after I stirred it all together.  Also I put them on the cookie sheet by just dropping them by the spoonful.  That worked fine.  No greasy hands.  I baked them for between 13 and 14 minutes. Good, easy and fast with no mess!  I like that.

Very easy to make and really yummy! The batter was slightly too oily, making the chocolate chips difficult to fold into the batter. The baking time should probably be closer to 10-12 minutes as at 8 minutes, it is still quite soft.

Loved this! My only tweak that i believe many will enjoy is instead of vegetable oil, use applesauce. I followed the recipe and substituted 1/2 cup oil for the applesauce and they turned out PERFECT! The cookies were moist but did not fall apart and were not oily or greasy.

Great,simple recipe. Took these to a family reunion & they were a big hit. I chill the dough about an hour before baking so they don't spread so much. Quick easy bake sale item too.

These came out wonderfully. I didn't use the chocolate chips though. Instead I substituted them with Walnuts and rolled a tablespoon size of dough in some granulated sugar.

This cookie was a big hit at our house. It was very easy to make and inexpensive, too. The only thing I added was I rolled the finished, cooled cookies in powdered sugar. A kid friendly recipe, too for little ones to help. It was a huge hit with the family.

I changed the oil to a 1/3 cup and they tasted fabulous. I didn't add in chocolate chips because I didn't have any but they still worked out fine. I will definitely try this recipe with all the other cake mix flavours I got!

WOW!  I made mine with BettyC's Milk Chocolate cake mix and omitted the chocolate chips.  These are fantastic! The perfect mix between a cookie and a uber chewy, gooey brownie.  I baked mine 10 minutes and let them sit on the UNgreased cookie sheet for about 30 minutes. They came off perfectly and were so good!  Thanks!

If you are looking for a "brownie" type cookie, these are really good. I made mine with Betty Crocker's Super Moist "Chocolate Fudge" Cake Mix and they turned out great. I did NOT grease the cookie sheet (didn't seem to need it with all that oil). I make cookies from scratch all the time, but I tried this out on my kids and they approve....so I'll definately keep the recipe for when I need something quick. They are kind of crispy on the edges, and really soft/gooey in the middle (brownie like).

I followed this recipe's ingredients to the T, and these turned out lovely (baked for the 12 minutes that others recommended for 2 batched and decided to try 10 minutes for the third batch. I actually liked the shorter time better, much "fudgier" and less "cookie-ish", just like the title suggests! :O) This is a super recipe for someone like me who needed a last minute treat and didn't have lots of fancy ingredients on hand. It doesn't get easier than this, and the cookies are very pretty!

I tried reducing to 1/2 cup of oil, but they came out a little dry. Quick and easy enough, but nothing I would try and pawn off as "homemade". I think the cookies made with brownie mix are much better tasting.

This is the first time I have made cake mix cookies and they are pretty good, I was surprised. I added white and chocolate chinks and baked them for 8 minutes which made them gooey in the center. Not as good as homemade cookes but still a great runner up.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out a thin, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside cookie. Do not fear how oily the dough looks once you have rolled it in to a ball. They are not greasy at all once cooked. However, they do tend to spread out quite a bit. Make sure to leave enough room between each ball of dough. I would have to say this is a new favorite and will be made over and over. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

What a easy and delicious recipe!  My 14 yr old son was looking at recipes using the allrecipes dinner spinner app on my phone and came across this one.  With only 4 ingredients he said, "I can do this one!" and he did!  I don't think the cookies he made lasted 2 days. 

One word of caution... apparently not all cake mix recipes have the same ingredients.  My son decided to try a modified version of this recipe using a BC confetti cake mix instead of the devils food cake mix.  The results were fantastic -- super sweet and very tasty, but the batter was so unbelievably sticky it was impossible to form balls.  It was even difficult to get it to come off a spoon - stuck to the spoon and fingers.  We had lots of laughs while making this modified batch and will undoubtedly bring this up in the future.

I thought for a quick and easy recipe that it had good taste. The texture is cookie like, almost brownie like. I added some macadamia nuts, great contrast. I made 2 dozen. I will be making these again. Thanks. Happy Cooking!

I am usually a make from scratch baker but I was lazy this time so I thought I would give it a try. This recipe is much much better than I expected. The cookies came out very good, crisp on the outside and moist inside. I changed the ingredient a bit, I used Betty Crocker Super Moist Devil's food cake mix,  1/3 cup melted butter, 1 tbsp oil, 2 eggs and added white chocolate chips and chopped almond. I also baked them for 13 mins. It's a really easy recipe and worth a try.

It's pretty good! Ive made Them on multiple occasions and everyone enjoys them. I like to make them with white and peanut butter chips - they're absolutely delish and no one is able to deny themselves from eating at LEAST one! :) it's quick and super easy to make - and you can bring the kids in on making them! It's great. No complaints here. :)

Wow, I am usually a from scratch baker, but these were very good. For a very quick nice looking batch of cookies these are perfect.  It was amazing that in under 20 min I could fill my cookie bin! I used a red velvet mix with mini chocolate chips.

Definitely 5 stars for simplicity!!!  LOVE THAT!  I am MORE of a COOK than a BAKER so there you go!  I made two batches, one with chopped walnuts (approx. 1/2 cup), both with Dark chocolate moist pudding cake (cause that's all I had!), then sprinkled both batches (while hot) with powdered sugar.

The cookies definitely need to stay in the oven 12-14 minutes.  I wasn't sure if it was just my oven but they definitely need to stay in longer and my family LOVES "undercooked" cookies.  

First batch (without nuts) and right out of the oven were NOT a big hit.  After they cooled, my Husband and sons could not stop eating them.  After the second batch came out (with the nuts), they DISAPPEARED within minutes!!!  They are very rich but if you like sweets/chocolate as "My Guys" do, they will be a hit!

Oh, and I do believe that less oil definitely would work (even if you are adding nuts!)  The possibilities are ENDLESS~ ENJOY and THANK YOU for such a SIMPLE RECIPE!!!

These are soooo easy and they taste completely homemade!  They are fool proof as well, everytime I make them I can count on them coming out exactly the same.  They are easy and I can throw them together quick!  I have made them for many functions and they are always a hit! =)

These were great and so easy to make!! I added just a bit less oil then a half cup because of the reviews saying they were too oily and also increased the cooking time to 14 minutes and they were perfect. I also added toffee bits instead of chocolate chips but these would also be good with pecans or walnuts and white or chocolate chips. I will definitely be making these again.

My daughter loves these cookies. She paid about 6 dollars for 4 at the supermarket and ask me if I couldn't bake some. I searched Allrecipes (my favorite recipe site) and found this recipe. It was love at first bite : ) The recipe is a little oily and I may try reducing the oil in the next batch. Thanks for this easy, delicious, and inexpensive recipe!

Okay, I have made this several times and I love this recipe! It's super easy and so yummy. The first couple of times I made the recipe exactly as written, and it's perfect just like that. The last few times, however, I've replaced the vegetable oil with 3/4 c. of applesauce. This change makes the cookies more cake-like and I've decided this is my favorite way to have them! I also replace the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips, and needless to say, I'm never getting rid of this FANTASTIC, easy recipe.

Very, very yummy and easy to make! I made mine without the chocolate chips, because I didn't want the chocolate to be overpowering. Also I only put 1/3 cup of oil, and they turned out great!

I'll make these again! They go great with a tall glass of milk!

Very easy to make and soooooo good :) my kids loved them. The only thing I changed for my 2nd batch was that I cooked them about 2 minuntes longer so they wouldnt fall apart. These cookies are awesome!!!

These are pretty good cookies, especially if you're short on time as they're so easy to make. I found them to be a little lacking in flavor; however, everyone else that tried them adored them.

These cookies are really good and very soft. They are so easy to make I also made orange ones as well. These are always my go to cookies when I need something quick. I made them with heath bar and M&Ms and they were a hit.

These were good.  I used Pillsbury Reduced Sugar Devil's Food cake mix, substituted applesauce for the oil, added 1/4 c fat-free sour cream (because the batter seemed a little dry) & added 1/2 c chopped walnuts.  I rolled some in powdered sugar before baking -both were good.  The kids liked them and they were easy to make.  I've made plenty of cookies from scratch but never a chocolate cookie.  Next time I'll try one from scratch & see how it compares.

This recipe is so easy! If you want some quick cookies this is the best. I added a little more than the called for cup of chocolate chips and 2 tbsp. of brewed coffee to deepen the chocolate flavor and they were nice and gooey good.

I's just me and my husband, so i look for recipes that i can half easily. This one worked well. I used 1/3 c of vegetable oil and that was plenty for a moist cookie. I also added crushed walnuts, didn't really measure the amount of them, just poured them in. I added 1/2 tsp. of cherry extract for a black-forest-ish cookie and baked for 12 minutes--they were amazing. the husband ate three in about three seconds. i LOVE  them! will definitely make this again ^_^

Holy smokes. I'm in cookie heaven! Reduced oil to 1/3 cup, added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, cooked 2 minutes longer...sheer bliss. (Almost didn't get to the cooking stage -- my family kept "tasting" the dough!!) Super recipe.

Used other suggestions and I added the 1 teaspoon vanilla and used 1/2 cup butter and 1 tablespoon oil. Used milk chocolate chips.  Baked for 9 minutes.  Turned out perfectly, 5 stars for how easy it is and how good (it didn't taste like cake  mix to me).

oh man, these are so good! i added a pinch of salt and a bit of vanilla, and used pecan bits instead of chocolate chips. they are delicious! they don't spread out that much, so i sorta push 'em down a little bit. since they're so fudgy, i call them 'brownie bites.' a good mix of cookie and brownie.

These came out perfect!! I did not have high expectations as I usually like making things from scratch, but these taste like they are from a gourmet bakery. Nice and chewy and even better the 2 day! Any chocolate lover will appreciate these.

I used 1 stick butter instead of oil, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 of a small "ready-to-eat" pudding. I put walnuts on top.  My hubby loved them! Started eating them the minute he walked through the door and has been grabbing one here and there since..He did not believe that they were from a cake mix. I did use a MOIST Choc cake mix.  

I baked them for 8 mins. I like my cookies a little "crunchier" so I added another 2 minutes baking time to a small batch and they were just the way I like them!  

Quick and easy!  That's my kind of recipe!  Can't wait to try some other flavor combinations :)

Thanks for the great idea!

I believe this recipe is an original right off a cake mix box from back in the 70's.  I'm 47 now, but, when I was in my teens, I loved making this cookie adding all the different "extras" each time.  Peppermint extract, choco chips, peanut butter chips, walnuts.  A fun base recipe for kids to use!

This recipe was a breeze to make and delicious too! I substituted one egg for a banana; which worked out very well, Cut up sweet and semi sweet baking chocolate bars for chocolate chips and rolled in powdered sugar before baking. Yum!

These are to die for! I also used Betty Crocker Super Moist Devil's Food Cake mix and a little more than 1/2 cup chocolate chips. The cookies literally melt in your mouth. Three days later and they are still moist and delicious!! These will satisfy your chocolate craving with just one cookie.

These are a really easy, good tasting recipe. The kids did all the work, although I needed to roll them and place them on the cookie sheet.(the dough ws really greasy) 
 They came out pretty well, I made half of them as directed and the other half rolled in powdered sugar. Both batches were really moist and tasted great!

When I was dropping them on the baking sheet I was afraid that they were waaaay too oily, but they came out okay (I really like a chewy cookie). If you're not into really chewy ones, try using butter instead of the oil. Also, I used Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge mix. Yummy!

Wonderful!  So easy to make and tastes so good.  Instead of chocolate chips we used Hershey's Premium Baking Bits that had raspberry filled centers. They were super yummy!

This is a good recipe.  I made it with my kids today as a rainy day project. The dough mixes up quickly but did seem a little oily.  (Maybe I measure wrong with the help of my 3 & 4 year olds!) The cookies are soft. I used a german choc cake mix and frosted with canned vanilla frosting.  Make sure to bake them long enough so they don't fall apart after cooling.

Solidly decent cookies. Docked 1 star because they are't AMAZING by any means, but they're good!

These were nice chocolatey and delicious cookies. I made them twice because I messed up the first time but once I got it right they were very tasty cookies. I enjoyed how easy they were made and how good they were. All in all, these were easy fast and tasty cookies.

Great recipe!  Couldn’t be easier to make.  After reading other reviews I substituted melted butter plus 1 T oil in place of all the oil, used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips (because our granddaughter loves peanut butter) and used a Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix instead of Devils Food because I have never been a fan of Devils Food.  They were oily to roll in a ball but that’s no big deal with a little bit of shortening on your hands.  Also following other reviewers I baked them for 12 minutes and they came out great!  They were fudgy and not cakey at all.  This one is a keeper!

I made this recipe with a white cake mix, 1-1/2 cup milk chocolate chips, only 1/2 cup oil. I also added a cup of chopped pecans. I also used a cookie scoop to place on cookie sheet. These cookies came out perfect!  I will use a chocolate cake mix next time but I will keep everything else I did exactly the same!  Easy and delicious!

As others said they are not as good as homemade but still they are good and easy, too.  As others reviewed I cut the oil back to 1/3 C.  That was a good thing.  A bad thing was that I took  some reviewers advice and added 1 1/2 minutes to the 10 minutes and the cookies didn't come out moist at all.  They were crunchy which was not what I was looking for.   Too overdone for what I wanted.   Next time I'll take them out at 9 or 10 minutes.

I followed this recipe, except my mix was only 15.65 oz (or something close) and lessened to oil to just under 1/4 cup.  
I also added some cocoa power and some coffee. I added about a 1/ 3 of flour to make up for the missing amount in the mix.
They looked good but as they cooled they flattened totally.  I tasted one and it was mushy and undone (though I baked for much longer).  Not sure what happened!!!!

Tried using a spice cake mix for this recipe for the second batch. Not bad but requires a few more minutes for baking. Topped each cookie with a whole pecan piece and sprinkled sugar cinnamon mixture before baking. The result was not bad,but needs some tweaking. Need to add more spices, maybe some clove & nutmeg.

It was delicious!! The only thing that wasn't super was the texture of the cookie when it came out. They were kind of squishy and fell apart when we picked them up. Otherwise, this was an awesome recipe! :)

I followed other reviewers suggestions and only added 1/4 cup of oil. I did half without choc chips ( to make dairy free for me) and both batches came out nice and chewy. Easy recipe that's good.

I made these for 8/1/16. They were REALLY delicious. However, I decided last second to add some white chocolate chips (ghiradelli brand) and by far that was my favorite part of the whole cookie. It added a melt-in-your-mouth sweetness that really hit the spot. Would definitely make again!

I followed the recipe as directed but I was out of chocolate chips so instead, I cut Baby Ruth Candy bars into pieces and added those instead. Also, after tasting the first batch I decided it needed vanilla extract, and they turned out wonderful! I have a feeling that I will use this recipe with alot of different fun candies as an addition!! Thank you!
P.S. If the picture of some of the cookies is added to this review, I apologize! The photo does not do these cookies justice!

Delicious! However, they are better if cooked longer and definitely don't add 1/2 a cup of oil. I added 1/3 of a cup instead and cooked them for 15 minutes. They were perfect!

Delicious cookie! I did not make any changes, except making the cookie balls a bit bigger, and they turned out great! This was one of the first recipes I ever made by myself when I first started cooking, and it's super easy. Great for beginning chefs!

Was looking for a quick cookie recipe for cookie exchange for my daughters basketball team. I was a little skeptical about making these, but they turned out great. I only used 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup water and 1 egg. Put in semi sweet chocolate chips, although I did find the chips didn't want to hold very well in the mixture. I used a small cookie scoop perfect size every time, I baked mine for 15 min. @ 350. I definitely will be using this recipe from now on. Oh did I mention the Devils food makes an awesome combo with the chocolate chips!!!!! Total heaven at first bite. :)

My nine yr old grandson googled this recipe and we gave it a try.  As this was spontanteous, the only boxed mix in the cabinet was Duncan Hines Brownie Mix. I followed the directions, but added a little more than a ½ cup of chips and used rice bran oil. The result was fudgy and good. While I could still notice the "boxed" taste, for a quick cookie, this couldn't be beat.

As of this recipe, it is very simple to make, and maybe the simplicity of making the cookies was convenient. But the cookie, in my opinion, lacked quality. There was an over use of oil, the amount of oil residue on my hands was enough to wash my entire body with oil. Also another thing, I found that, the amount of chocolate chips was way too much. And for my taste of food, I like food that is sweet but not too sweet that it requires a glass of milk on the side to cancel out the extra sweetness. But I think the recipe would be great for anybody who has a sweet tooth, and I think the cookies would satisfy them, IF they were to reduce the amount of oil to 1/3 as others have suggested and if they were to reduce the amount of semi-sweet chocolate chips(but that's up to you and your preference). The recipe has potential to make great fudge cookies it just some adjustments need to be made for those who like less oily, and less sweetness. The good thing about the recipe was that it was easy to make and had a very rich taste. So Overall, the cookies were okay.

I found this while looking for a dessert that I could make at the last minute for some company. They really loved it and it took me barely any time or effort without them knowing how easy it was :) They were a bit rich for me, but overall a success.

I loved these cookies. I made them for my boyfriend and took them to his shop. The guys devoured them. Great recipe. I used the betty Crocker moist devils food cake mix. It was great. I also added in about half the bag of  chocolate chips instead of  a cup because I didn't read it...(: Still no such thing as too many chocolate chips..(:

I was having a chocolate emergency this morning. Made this with 1/3 c oil (as suggested), added 1 cup walnuts, and omitted chocolate chips because I didn't have any. Made them into cookies and into mini-muffins. Cookies really spread out--about triple size--so I will chill the dough next time. (cooked 12 minutes) Love the chewy edges! Muffins took 20 minutes. Nice and puffy. I think the chocolate chips would kick up the chocolate punch. Will double the nuts next time. Very rich and satisfying overall.

Too crumbly when fresh; better the next day. Also, don't just drop them on the cookies sheet. Tastier when pressed down a little bit (found out by accident when son was "helping"). Great in a pinch, but not as good as a traditional cookie.

These are stellar!  I was going to change up the recipe a bit by using butter instead of oil, as some of the reviews suggested.  However, I stuck with the original recipe, and I see no reason to change it.  They're awesome.

Made these last night start to finish in less than 30 minutes.  These cookies are fantastic if you need a dessert in a hurry, but I wouldn't make them again if I had more time to make a better tasting cookie recipe.  Used 1 stick of softened butter instead of the oil and they came out very soft and a little chewy - NOT at all greasy like other reviewers, but then again, I did not grease my cookie sheets.  There is no need to grease them, even if you add the oil to the batter.  Added some walnuts just because we like them.  Ended up with over 30 cookies.

Really good! I used white chocolate chips instead of regular and it was yummy! Yes the dough is greasy, but the overall cookie is not. But what do you expect when you just add oil and eggs?

A yummy cookie...very inexpensive & easy.  The only thing I would advise is to stick with the cooking time of 8-10 minutes.  The first time I overcooked them b/c it's hard to tell when they're done, so stick with the recipe time.  Also, my husband & I prefer to use white chocolate chips...it seems to taste creamier and not as rich.  Very good!!

These are so good and so easy! I use the sugar free Devil's Food mix, and like to vary the recipe with Reece's pieces, white chocolate chips, or a peanut butter filling mmmmmmm....

We really enjoyed these cookies.  In my oven 12 minutes was not long enough to bake.  I also added 1/2 cup of Craisins which we liked.

I love how I can add whatever I have to the base of the recipe. I have used M&M, toffee bits, walnuts... just to name a few :) It is sooo good... I do add a little vanilla though but that is just me :)

I made these the other day and I thought that they were pretty good. A lot less mess than making traditional cookies. I actually used a regular chocolate cake mix and had to add in extra oil. I also used chocolate chunks which is not adviseable as the chunks fall out of the batter. But they tasted good and didn't make a gazillion cookies that we have for weeks!

These cookies are very easy and very yummy.  I have found that they are better the day after they are baked.  I substituted white chips for the chocolate chips.  The recipe doesn't make too many but that my only complaint!

This is a GREAT recipe!! It is very simple and delicious!!I made 48 cookies from chestnut size balls.The first batch I made turned out great..I baked them for about 2-3 minutes more then the recipe called for..the cookies still turned out soft and moist...almost like a brownie.But I burned the second batch so while they were still warm a scraped off the burned bottoms and they still turned out great!!They were a bit crunchier, but my younger brother and sister finished them all in a matter of days and I gave my friends some and they all asked me to make more for them the next day!! All in all a great recipe!!

Make sure not to leave in too long.  I left it in for 8 minutes, checked it and it was super mushy so I put it in for 2 more minutes and when they cooled, they were over cooked.  Next time I'll take them out when they look slightly undercooked.  They do taste good rolled in powdered sugar before you bake them! :)

It is a little oily which is why it doesn't get full five stars. But It's a great, fast recipe. I use white chocolate chips and it always goes over really well.

Amazingly AWESOME cookies! This is a keeper recipe for sure. I will make these  again. I followed the recipe to a T. I got 40 cookies. A dozen of them I rolled in powdered sugar before baking and they got that nice glaze to them. The rest I  flattened them a bit before baking. And they came out wonderful. I have an electric stove and 10 minutes baking time made for perfect cookies. Thanks for posting this recipe Kalsmom!

Had to make something very quick to take to youth group last night and these cookies popped up.  I made them and they were delicious and fast.  I didn't have regular choc. chips so I used mint choc. chips.  Also ran out of vegetable oil so I used 1/4C oil and 1/4 C melted butter.  It worked out fine and tasted yummy!  Kids loved them.

I didn't have devils food cake mix, so I used Betty Crocker dark chocolate and used white chocolate chips. These are fantastic! I also had Duncan Hines red velvet, but those are almost inedible.

thanks for the recipe... These were so simple to make! They looked really pretty too. I used Betty Crocker triple fudge cake mix so it precame with chocolate chips. I felt they were a bit bland, so next time i'll add walnuts.

I'm not sure why but the cookies don't turn out as fudgy as I wanted it to be. Anyway, it still taste good (though not as good as I thought would be).
