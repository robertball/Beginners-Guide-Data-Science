Oh. Ma. Gawd. This was SO good. There were a couple of changes I made only because I'm really broke and have to use what I have. I used one pound of beef stew meat (pork was not on sale this week, but stew meat was) that I tenderized the heck out of and 8 oz. of quartered baby Bella mushrooms in place of the other pound of meat called for. When sauteing the onion, garlic and mushrooms together, I had to add a little butter in with the EVOO as the pan was a little dry with the added mushrooms. I served this with sour cream mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Insane flavor. I can't wait to try this with pork. NOTE: I had to use two different pans to saute, one for the onions, garlic and mushrooms and one for the beef. When I went to deglaze both pans, I used the cup of beef broth for one and the half cup of wine for the other. This way I didn't sacrifice any of the flavor because I had to cut the meat in half and use part mushrooms. Oh. Doi. I used beef broth instead of chicken.

We're still swooning over this recipe. In anticipation of making this today, I went out to get some rosemary and thyme. So glad I took the time! My only tweek was a spoonful of tomato paste, and I diced up store tomatoes. I used the very last of my home made chicken stock, so I started a new stock while making this fantastic meal.

We really enjoyed this. I had no problem with the sauce not thickening. I served it over mashed potatoes. It's going in my comfort food "file" to make again!

This is a very flavorful pork dish. I added one additional ingredient which sealed in the seasoning while the meat was being seared and browned. I dipped the cubed shoulder pork into flour. Dusted off the excess and then braised the meat in the pan. I used two cans of chicken broth instead of 1 can. This thickened the sauce beautifully . The extra sauce was then poured over my cooked egg noodle pasta. I had some Romano drated cheese, added that to the pasta sauce. A beautiful dish filled with flavor.

Delicious. Needed something to do with pork shoulder that was quick! This was perfect served over rotini with a little parmesan cheese and some vegetables on the side.

I served it over mashed potatoes and the whole family loved it.  I got a cheaper cut of pork meat and it still got so tender I could cut it with a spoon.

Delish! Made this last night for dinner and everyone went back for seconds.  I decided to marinate the pork after I cubed it. I just put the spices and olive oil in a ziploc - toss in the pork - close it up - and shake with love! Put it in the fridge to marinate. The longer the better (don't forget to flip the bag every couple of hours). I made mashed potatoes, haricot verts, and rosemary roasted garlic bread.  Wonderful comfort meal. Thanks so much. :)

This is seriously delish!! I loved it, however mine did turn out kind of greasy, but that's totally my fault because I always fill the pan too full of oil. I didn't use any wine only chicken broth, and I only had one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. I had mine up too high so my sauce thickened up nicely and actually almost dissapeared. I will be making this again.

Total comfort food. Just made this for dinner last night over yukon gold mashed potatoes with roasted garlic. YUM!!!! Reminds me very much of my osso bucco recipe that I make, only so much cheaper. This is definitely a restaurant worthy recipe. I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, rosemary, and thyme before browning the pork cubes. Then added 2 Tablespoons of tomato paste once the vegetables were done being sauted. These steps made the sauce a perfect consistency. I also used a pork picnic and cut it into cubes and added the bone in while it cooked with a sprig of fresh rosemary and thyme. Cooked on a simmer for 2 hours because of the cut of pork. This will be a keeper for sure, Enjoy :)

This was so good...I didn't have any pork and used a chuck roast I cut up.  It did take a bit longer than 30 minutes for it to thicken up, but well worth the wait!!!

This took hours and hours for the sauce to reduce and thicken to be considered a ragu. Even after that it still lacked body. I added some tomato paste which helped a little, but on the whole I wasn't too impressed with this one.

This was very good over egg noodles. I made minimal modifications, using and entire 14 oz can of chicken broth, and two tablespoons of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Otherwise, made exactly as directed, and got rave reviews! This one is a keeper. Thanks!

Average. Sorry. 

Unlike some reviewers I will not say "I adjusted this a nd that and I didn't like it after what I've done to your recipe".

I cooked it exactly as suggested, and here's where 3 out of 5 comes from: 

1. cooking time. way too short for ragou. Leave it to simmer for another 30 mins.
2. rosemary big no-no (ok, I suppose some ppl are gonna smack me here, but rosemary is for lamb only)
3. Do yourself a favor and use live, not canned tomatoes. Blanche them, peel the skin and dice. You will see the difference. Use meaty ones ;)

Great fall/winter weekend recipe! Very easy to make.  I took the advice of the submitter and served it with parmesan risotto----yum! (It's often difficult to be able to make risotto but with the simmering time on this, it was perfect.  I simmered much longer, just 'cause I could.)

This was excellent! I did add a tab bit more seasoning (garlic pepper) and used crushed tomatoes. Braised for approx 6 hrs. Comforting/tender. I did pair this with risotto alla milanese recipe from this site. A match made in heaven!

WOWWEE!!! My mouth was so very happy to keep eating this delectable meal! The flavors were delish and it was relatively easy to make! I added mushrooms to the mix and used fresh herbs - other than that, nothing else needed to be done. I served it over pasta and the hubby had three helpings! Super good - try it, you won't regret it!

This recipe is extremely addicting!  My sauce also came out too thin, but I attribute this to all the liquid that came out of the pork when it was cooking.  I used pork butt instead of shoulder, so maybe this was the reason?  Anyway, I compensated by not adding the chicken broth (since I basically had homemade pork broth from the extra liquid!), as well as adding 2 tbsp of tomato paste and pre-mixed 2 tbsp cornstarch/2 tbsp water near the end.  (You want to pre-mix with a small amount of water so that lumps don't form in the sauce.)  The sauce thickened nicely and the ragu tasted excellent!  I attribute a lot of that to the recommendation by the chef to serve on top of parmesan risotto.  I also added basil to the risotto, and they both complemented the ragu well.  My compliments to the chef - this is my new favorite comfort food!

Delicious!  We all liked.  I used pork loin and served over noodles.  Oh, and I added a zucchini since I had one in the frig that needed to be used and only used about 1 lb. 4 oz. of pork.

This was a nice hearty recipe. Like others, I dredged the pork in flour after it was seasoned. This thickened it nicely. Also used fresh tomatoes, rather then canned. 
I wound up cooking it far longer then the recipe called for - almost 2 hours - but it was really good and I think the stew meat needed a longer cooking time anyway to tenderize properly. Had leftovers but found that it was better the first day. The flavors faded too much. I'll be making this again!

Good recipe. I scrub carrots as nutrients are close to the skin and I prefered to use vegetable stock. Slight modification to suit me but recipe as written is just as good.

I have been dying for something to do with a boston butt other than roast it for hours on end in the florida heat! Served it over moscachelli & was a tovtal smash hit in my house.  Next to time we do this, we're adding Bella mushrooms & zucchini & squash.  Perhaps will do over risotto - have to convince the spouse.

I like to smoke pork spareribs, and I buy the untrimmed slabs.  I have discovered the secret of making good spareribs is to trim away all the excess meat.  I used this recipe as a way to make use of the trimmings, and the flavorful meat from the trimmings is incredibly good in this recipe.

We ended up having only 28oz of tomato sauce, and it ended up perfect!  I'm not sure if it's still a 'ragu' but the sauce was thick after about 1hr+ of braising.  It went great with parmasean garlic noodles.  Next time we'll go with 15oz of sauce and 15oz of diced and see if having the tomatoes add even more to the dish.

I followed the recipe exactly...not well received, used the leftovers to try to fix it...added sour cream, & it still needed something, I still haven't found what.
Tried it over noodles & potatoes..everybody loved and ate the hot bread..and had deli snack later that evening.

I thought this was very good but not amazing.  I used boneless pork chops (they were on sale) and only used about 2.25 pounds.  I, also, doubled the spices (I used fresh sage and rosemary) and added mushrooms, 2 garlic cloves, an extra carrot and a little extra wine.  I did not have a problem with the sauce thickening, but I probably cooked it on a low boil for about an hour.  I served over brown rice and it made a fairly healthy, satisfying meal.

This was a wonderful dish. They whole family enjoyed it. In fact we had enough left over for the next day and it was even better. All the flavors married and the pork just soaked it right up. The pork I used was pork loin and when cooked it was so tender and juicy it just fell apart. I did however use a little more stock and wine and it wasn't thickened I didn't need for it to be thickened, we just soaked it up with some thick cut fresh french bread. Will make it many more times. Thanks for the recipe

I thought this recipe was great!  I did have to add tomato paste to thicken up and I did let the pork cook for an hour as it was that much more tender.  I served it over rigatone.  Mmmmm.

This was tasty and filling- it went well with white rice. If I make it again I would add 3 or 4 carrots rather than just the 1.

Like many reviewers suggested, I let it cook twice as long as the recipe states to get more of a ragu-like consistency. I also left out the rosemary as I didn't have any on hand. Otherwise, I followed the receipe.

This recipe was very easy and super tastey as well!  I served it over mashed potatoes with a roasted root vegetable side dish.  There wasn't any problem with this recipe but I found the time needed to thicken the sauce and realy intensify the flavour, was closer to an hour. SO good, a huge hit!!

Very Yummy!  I liked it because it was tasty and it was different from the usual meals I make.  I made this exactly as written.  I had to cook this about 45min or so to make sure the pork was tender.  I actually had to add more chicken stock because the sauce thickened up so much, so no problem there.  I served this over mashed potatoes as others suggested, it was perfect.

WOW!  This is FANTASTIC!  I changed a few things based upon what I had and needed to use up!  Cubed Pork (was going to make schnitzel, SO glad I didn't), zucchini, celery and bell pepper.  My husband really liked it but the HUGE thing was my two year old, I was worried that she was going to throw it but she dumped the bowl on her tray and ate it all up and said "more"!  Definitely a KEEPER!

I used pork sirloin and roughly followed the proportions of ingredients except for using a regular sized can of tomatoes, despite which I still needed to thicken the sauce a little with some cornstarch.  Instead of wine I used red wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar.  I also used trio -- a blend of onion and peppers, and served the dish with mashed potatoes.  The dish has great flavor and I will definitely make it again.  It is probably better suited to rice than to potatoes.

Made this tonight...FABULOUS!!!!  The only one small change I made was...I used a 14 oz. can of fire-roasted chopped tomatoes, instead of a 28 oz. can of plain chopped tomatoes.  It was perfect!  Served it over egg noodles with Parm Cheese.  The whole family loved...will make this again and again!!!

This was just plain bland.  Made exactly how instructed but neither hubby nor I enjoyed our dinner tonight at all.  Very disappointing. Updated: January 2015 - made this again last week and although hubby still said it didn't have much taste, I really enjoyed it and took leftovers to work the next day for my lunch.  Unfortunately I can't put it on my regular rotation or hubby will get grumpy but I think this is a nice mild ragu dish served over egg noodles and a side veggie.

LOVE IT!  This was fantastic & is a keeper!  Followed directions as written.  Used Jargon Pinot Nior wine which added a great flavor, hate cooking wines!  Thanks for sharing - can't wait for my mom's next visit so I can make this treat for her.  She'll love it, too!

Phenomenal flavors. I used pork butt instead of shoulder and beef stock instead of chicken stock. It did take about 1.5 - 2 hours on a high simmer (not the 30 minutes mentioned in the recipe) to properly reduce but it was worth the wait.

I am using this recipe to approximate a wild boar ragu. I add to the ingredients mushrooms, truffle, kitchen bouquet and any other "dark wild" flavors I have. Tonight I will add chantrelles and duck fat. It works out great and makes a wonderful thickened sauce for pasta

I threw all the ingredients into my Instant Pot and let it go. When the roast was done, I removed it and used my immersion blender to puree the sauce. I served with mashed potatoes and broccoli, and it was delicious!  There was a lot of leftover sauce, which I froze to use another time.

Made some Modifications.. added tomato paste after sweating the onions and some others. Used Rosemary, Ground Cloves ( a tiny bit goes a long way) and some nutmeg. I used Polenta instead of Risotto. It came out good. I would make it again but try it over Risotto or Pasta.

Really great recipe. I didn't have tomatoes so I used some nice bottled marinara and tomato paste. Threw in some bay leaves and several cloves of minced garlic. Cooked in a pressure cooker for about 35 minutes.

Wonderful flavor, very tender pork. I followed one review that suggested dredging in flour after rubbing in the spices and before browning. Sauce thickened nicely, but it took a long time for the pork to become tender, over two hours. So I will begin earlier in the day. And that will be soon, our roast was 14 pounds.

Delicious! I left the dish on low (after the required time) for about an hour and it was tender and wonderful. I served it on top of homemade mashed potatoes and it was marvelous.

The flavors are great, but i would recommend a much longer cooking time to get the pork very tender. After reducing the liquids a bit, i put a lid on the dutch oven and put it in a 300 degree oven for another hour. The flavors really came together and the pork was just the right texture.

I was a little skeptical that I would have tender pork after only 30 minutes simmer time, but WOW - this was delicious!!  I didn't have an onion on hand, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. Very easy, and a hit even with the kids. Served over Parmesan risotto - would definitely make again!!

We made this as called for and served over rigatoni and it was very good.  I did find I needed to simmer for quite a bit longer then the 30 minutes, in the end it was about an hour. The recipe delivered a great taste and we will definitely make it again!

Very tasty. The rosemary added a very nice flavor to the pork. Served as suggested with risotto, and it was great.

Came out great! The only changes I had was I omitted the rosemary (not a fan) and used a little cornstarch to thicken.  Perfect for a cold rainy day. Served it over Parmesan Risotto with some warm crusty bread on the side.

I made two changes. One was on accident, but I think it made it a little more like I wanted. I had no wine so I deglazed with 1/2 cup of beef stock instead. I had read another recipe before selecting this one that called for shaking the pork cubes in a bag with flour to coat so I did that - OOPS! After realizing my error, I added the spices to the bag and shook again. Then I proceeded with the recipe. My Dutch oven was totally coated in brown deliciousness by the time the meat was browned, and deglazing made it all part of the dish. I made Risotto with Truffle and Parmesan from this site (omitting the truffle) to go under the ragu, so I probably let this simmer closer to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. This  dish is fantastic on its own, and heavenly with the risotto!

Followed the recipe all the way....turned out really nice. Served with pasta and again with rice. All the family loved it. Even my 2 year old fussiest eater. Now it's one of our recipes. Next time will try with lamb and see how it goes. Thank you again for a great recipe x

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I really didn't make any additions/subtractions, but I did break up the chunks after about an hour simmering (I doubled the recipe). I served over roasted cauliflower to stay away from carbohydrates.

Delicious!  I had to make a couple alterations because some of the ingredients I had in the pantry were not the exact items the recipe called for but it came out absolutely delicious!  I used an already open bottle of a sweeter red wine in place of the dry red and my diced tomatoes happened to have green chilies in it.  The only carb item I had was pasta so I cooked the pasta elbows then added them to the ragu 5mins before it was done.  These were no leftovers.

We made it with fire roasted tomatoes and  we reserved the broth because of  a few comments regarding thickening problems. We also floured the pork prior to browning to help with thickening.   This dish came to our attention because we had it with cheesy grits at Churchill Downs and liked it so much we wanted to make it. We are very happy with the result.

I made this using pork loin served over risotto and it was outstanding.  Did take a little longer than 30 minutes to thicken as other reviews noted but the wait was worth it!

Delicious! I cooked it longer....because it wasn't time to serve ;) so tender and a big hit at my birthday dinner party.  I dipped the pork in flour before browning , otherwise just followed the recipe. Thanks! Will definitely make it for parties (and me!) again.

This is an amazing recipe - everyone loves it!  I shake the pork and seasonings in a bag with about 1/2 cup of flour and then brown the meat.  This gives the sauce more substance.  I then follow the directions preparing it in the morning and throw it all in the crockpot on low.  Let it simmer for 5-6 hours and then serve with Parmesan risotto.
Perfect for a cold winter day!

Delish! Followed the recipe only replaced carrots with mushroom. My boys don't like cooked carrots. Don't know how the sauce is too dark in the picture like gravy so i put little soy sauce. It did not turned out as dark but it is awesome! I will use dark wine next time.

I cooked a 4 pound pork shoulder (doubling this recipe) except for the tomatoes.  Also, I cooked it in a dutch oven for 2 hours with additional vegetables ( potatos, carrots, onions, mushrooms).   Great one pot meal and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

This was delish!  I only had fresh rosemary and thyme so I added them with the liquids. I also added crimini mushrooms and broth intead of wine. Very tasty and very flexible! Pork loin is inexpensive and lowfat but very dry if not prepared correctly. Braising is the way to go! We loved it!

Fabulous! Rich, delicious and can be served in a number of different ways (over mashed potatoes [if you omit the potatoes from the recipe], as the filling for a potpie, etc.). I used elk since I didn't have pork or beef and added a little more olive oil, red wine and water (I didn't have stock either) to compensate for the lack of fat in the meat, and although the consistency was more that of a roast than of a thicker sauce, it was still amazing. I didn't sautee anything either. I threw everything into the crockpot and went about my business. My husband loves it and asked if we can keep it in a regular meal rotation. #win

As I never follow a recipe to the tee- here is some substitutions I made and STILL came out amazing! Along with rosemary and thyme I also threw in a few bay leaves. Instead of red I used white wine (dry) and chopped up some dill right before serving.

This was so good. I didn't have wine so I left it out. It was still great. I cooked it over low heat for much longer than stated. I wanted to have the work done early so i let it slowly reduce.

Yummy!  I used beef shoulder roast and beef broth.  I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, so I used fresh diced tomatoes and it worked just fine.  I let the meat simmer, covered, for an hour longer than specified, and added a little water two times to ensure it didn't get dry.  It was so tender and yummy!  Served over Pioneer Woman's cream cheese mashed potatoes.  Talk about comfort food!

This was a restaurant-quality entree.  I used pork tenderloin and did not have carrots.  I served it over the Rosemary Parmesan Polenta on this site and it was truly fantastic.  I will also try serving it with pasta, mashed potatoes or rice.  Fantastic!

This is delicious and hearty! I served it over spaghetti squash to keep it light but I think it would be wonderful with mashed potatoes, rice or pasta. I used pork tenderloin and it turned out nicely tender. Yummy comfort food!

Thank you, Kirsten, for this delicious recipe. I'll be making this often, just as you wrote it. Easy, yummy, and OMG, so fragrant.

Delicious!The only thing I did differently was I used fresh rosemary and fresh thyme.

I followed the recipe as is and served it over egg noodles.  It lacked flavor and as others have mentioned, didn't thicken much even after boiling it for well over 30 minutes.  I won't be making it again.

Made according to recipe.  Tasted great but didn't thicken much.  Next time I'll dredge the pork in flour before searing.

Made this tonight and everybody raved! Used country pork strips cubed but everything else according to the recipe. It took longer to get tender so after 45 minutes on the cooktop I baked at 350 for an hour. End result was a terrific flavor and tender meat. Will definitely make this recipe again! Thanks.

I've been simmering the cubed pork shoulder for over an hour and still not tender.  I may use a crockpot next time.  Also, I did flour my pork as well and ths sauce has not thickened one bit.  I guess I'm a bad cook or used the work type of pork. Any helpful hints?
