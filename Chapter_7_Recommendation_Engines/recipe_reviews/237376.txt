These are so good! The only thing I wouldn't do next time and for now on when I make these, is not line the pan with parchment paper. The krispies stick to it otherwise. The old fashion way just calls for buttering the pan anyway so that's what I'll do for now on.

I tried this recipe after I saw it on Facebook.  My family thought it was too sweet and said they like regular Rice Krispie treats a lot better.  I didn't use the bourbon--substituted 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract and 1 Tablespoon almond extract.  BTW, no need to line the pan with parchment--just spray with Pam and it comes right out.

These were ridiculously good. I think the bourbon is the secret ingredient to making these awesome. Everyone gobbled these up at work when I made them for a friend's birthday

Made no changes.   Very delicious.  At first I thought the cake mix didn't add anything but after a couple bars I think the cake mix sweetness gets rid of the fruity taste from the pebbles.  Very yummy.

Easy and fast to make. The finished product is pretty to look at. It is sweet, chewy and the flavor of cake batter is fantastic. Five stars.

Iâ€™m not personally a fan of how fruity the fruity pebbles make this recipe; and I only added 1 cup of fruity pebbles.

It is very easy to make and very delicious if done correctly. The only problem is it can be quite messy if you aren't careful, but I fully suggest making this.

Very good! I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 Tbsp bourbon and it was delicious. You could probably cut out the bourbon though if you wanted an alcohol free version.

When I was a kid, my mom once found a recipe using only Fruity Pebbles, so I thought I'd try it. I also substituted bourbon using whisky, since I was out. Also because, on its own,  I preferred the whiskey tasted better than the vanilla. Overall, results were delicious. The cake mix definately intensified the fruit flavor. I wander how it would taste if I went "all chocolate".
