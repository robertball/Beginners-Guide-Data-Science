Really was surprised how good this is. My husband really enjoyed this also. Leftovers were really good. Will try it with Cheddar cheese next time just for a change.

This doesn't sound like it would be that great.  I made it to a T and it  was amazing.  My husband said it was one of his top ten dishes that I have made.  The best thing...low carbs!!
