OMG! I only made half of the batch. I added about 1 teaspoon vanilla and about 1/4 cup sugar to the batter. I don't have a kitchen funnel so I used a ziploc bag with a corner cut off. These were awesome, really simple to make, quick to fry...delicious...what else? They are just great. I used two spatulas to flip them over. Whatever you use to flip them make sure you grab them in the middle because the corners will be crispier and break off easily.

A very good recipe. I have seen that some have used ziploc bags but we used an old mustard bottle and it worked perfectly! plus it is a good container to refrigerate any leftover you may have.

I don't think it was the recipie, but I'm not sure what happened...I halved this recipe, used a deep fryer and candy thermometer to make sure the oil was at 360.  When I poured the batter in the hot oil, it expanded and oil poured over the top of the deep fryer.  I unplugged the fryer and the funnel cake continued to cook....looked right in the end but we couldn't eat it - it tasted like it was saturated with oil (probably because the temp dropped).  Anyone have any ideas on what I may have done wrong?

I have used this recipe for three years. The original receipe is only a 3-4 star recipe. I've jazzed it up a bit:  1. Add about 1/4 cup of sugar  2. Add 1 tsp of vanilla   3. MAKE SURE YOU USE ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. I used self-rising once and got the same results as a previous reviewer...the cake sinks to the bottom, separates, and fries up as little, hard-to-serve balls/crumbs. It's a mess.  4. If batter is made the night before, and kept in the fridge, the flavors meld together and the funnel cake is even more tasty. Be sure to get it out an hour or so before cooking so it's not too thick...and give it a good stir.  5. I use this batter for deep-fried Twinkies, too. Just dip in your Twinky, place in the oil, and remove when golden.

it's a great recipe! the only problem i'm having is as soon as the batter hits the oil..it goes straight to the bottom of the pan, so i stir it..the batter sticks to the spatula then all the batter breaks up into little balls - i don't know what i'm doing wrong...after a few min, everything tunrs brown and we have mini balls of fyred dough...not exactly what we expected.. i must say i does taste like funnel cake...just doesn't look like it.

Good stuff! However, not advised for party of two. Otherwise, 1/5 the ingredients and you'll have just enough to satisfy your cravings!

The recipe used too much salt. I would halve it next time. At first, I thought that it was just me, but everyone was telling me that it tasted a little salty. We tried to cover it up with tons of confectioner's sugar though. Besides that, it seemed perfect. I used a ziploc bag, I cut the hole a tad too big but found a way to make it work. Will use again...with less salt.

Delicious...I added just a little bit of vanilla extract and it was just the right touch.  I don't have a funnel either, so I used a pastry bag instead.  Dust it with some powder sugar and that's all you need.  One of the best I have had.  Thanks for the post.

Oh my goodness!!  I cut the recipe in half, added 1 T sugar and only 1/2 t salt, beat egg and milk in a 4 cup glass measure, added sifted ingredients and a little vanilla to that, whisked with a small whisk, poured right into the hot oil and cooked as directed!!  Easy to clean up and found no need for the mixer.  Now, I need to lose this recipe.

The batter was rather bland for my taste. You'll need to add some vanilla and sugar for a kick.

LOVED!!  Our youngest (6) requested funnel cakes for his birthday.  This recipe was GREAT!  I took other reviewers suggestions and added a couple tbsp of sugar and vanilla - SUCCESS!    I'd recommend using an empty squirt bottle (like an empty condiment bottle) instead of the funnel to put the batter into the grease, much easier to control and neater.    I have a feeling I'll be making this special treat again!

These were great.  My kids were able to do most of the preparation, and I did the pouring.   I didnt have a funnel so I thought I would put it in a sports bottle and squeeze it out (dont do this) it didn't work, it turned out to small and crispy.  THANKS for sharing.

This was such an easy recipe and very good. I also used it to make deep fried twinkles. Just freeze the twinkle, oreo, candy bar etc. and put into batter before deep frying...delicious!

Let me start by saying I made funnel cake for the first time last week using pancake mix and a stainless steel pan, and it was a disaster. The cake fell apart, and the batter soaked up tons of oil. It was disgusting. Yesterday I decided a second attempt at funnel cake using this recipe with a cast iron pan instead. I also used a candy thermometer to make sure the oil was exactly at 160 degrees. My first cake fell apart into little clumps once again, but the bigger clumps had the exact taste and texture as fair funnel cake. I then got the bright idea to try and make a funnel cake ring using tin foil, and the second cake was AWESOME. It held together perfectly. It was exactly like funnel cake from a fair in both look and texture. If your cake is not staying together, it is definitely not the recipe. I am not sure if it is safe to put foil in boiling oil, but if it is not, then I would go buy a proper funnel cake ring. It's worth it!

This was delicious! I needed a bit more milk to make it run out of the funnel and added a bit of  cinnamon and vanilla into the batter. Yum Yum Yum! Would also be great with a scoop of cinnamon icecream on top!

I tried these for the very first time and took the advice of the reviews, namely adding 1/3 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract.  Wow, had a funnel that wasn't as large as I was hoping but heck it did the job and I got really artistic swirling and making these amazing objects and guess what after sprinkling them with icing sugar they looked phenomenal and the boys arrived and they're all gone!  So if you haven't tried these yet, now's the time to show off your culinary and artistic skills! Thank you for sharing with us.

I didn't have to be as meticulous in the preperation as was directed here. I didn't use a blender, I just whisked it up pretty good with a fork. The lightest, fluffiest funnel cakes ever! We sprinkled them with powdered sugar and fresh sliced strawberries. Can't beat it!

I went looking for this recipe on a request from my husband. I would not have a child help with this because of the hot oil. I didn't think that they tasted that great, I guess the topping makes the difference.Overall I was not that impressed with this recipe, and I will continue to find another one that I like better.  Thanks

How fun are these and super tastey! Felt really guilty eating something fried like this but I think once in a while you can get away with it. I pored mine straight from a measuring cup into the oil in a circular motion and they were perfect. Great recipe and thanks for sharing it.

Really good after I added a tsp of vanilla and 2 Tbls sugar to the batter. Sprinkled with powdered sugar and added some well-defrosted strawberries (with their juices & sugar) ...topped them off with Redi Whip! YUM! So, so filling...so make a light dinner if you're having these for dessert.  The kids love to help with this one!! Thanks!

Having lived in the Amish community I can tell you that, with the addition of a bit of nutmeg, this recipe is spot on. No need to add the vanilla & sugar (unless you REALLY like sweet stuff -- remember you're going to dust the funnel cakes with powdered sugar after they're fried).

This was very easy to follow.  I don't have a deep fryer,  so I used a cast iron skillet.  I also used a plastic keptch squeeze bottle which worked perfect.  I also did not have a a thermonater,  I just heated the oil,  dropped a small amount of batter in until it bubbled up and floated to the top. Then went ahead and made them.  I made mine the size of a saucer,  much easier to handle.  Great receipe

Wonderful recipe. I haven't eaten funnel cake in ages and they are so expensive to buy...almost 5-6 dollars for one. But these were so easy to make, the only changes I made was instead of normal milk I used a vanilla flavoured milk and added some grated nutmeg to the batter. Was just wonderful with the sprinkled confectioners' sugar. Thanks for the quick, inexpensive and easy recipe!

I found I needed 2c milk to make the consistency right. Also, I substituted Hershey's vanilla cream milk for regular milk. My family said they were better than the ones you get at fairs and amusement parks.

These are so fun & tasty to make.  My family asks for them regularly.  The guests we've served them to love them, too.  I checked out about half a dozen funnel cake recipes & this is the best one I've found.

Great recipe, made no changes and turned out perfect.  Tasted just like the funnel cakes at the amusement parks but now we can have them any time we want a special treat.  Simple to  put together and easy to make with ingredients on hand.  Delicious, thanks for sharing this recipe!

wow, i made this and half of it was gone before i was done. Bad idea to make them before dinner,but i also have some tips.Like everyone else is saying add vanilla it could make a huge difference. what i did was use and old ketchup bottle(washed, of coarse). depending on the size of the hole they might break up when you squeeze some into the oil, but all you have to do is get a spatula and pull it together. when i served it i put vanilla ice cream ontop with the strawberry syrup on this website. and dont worry if you have little bits inthe end just use it as a topping on ice cream, good luck!

great, easy and quick! my kids loved it! since I'm a diabetic, I try to avoid sugar, so I ate my funnel cake without the sugar. And they taste just fine! We thought it looked like spooky brains! Great Halloween treat *****

THis recipe is good. ANd very budget friendly, you can make a batch of these compared to what they charge for one at the fair. next time i will add some sugar to the batter though, to make it sweeter, but other than that, it was a hit with everyone, I added cherry pie filling to the top & powder sugar. yum~

What a fun family activity and at a minimum cost!  And we don't have to wait for the State Fair! It got to the point where the kids were making letters to spell their names!  Used a large mouth funnel for safety.  Lined the countertop with waxed paper for easy cleanup.  Thanks!

Awesome!  I added just a little sugar and vanilla to the batter. The first one I made turned out like a weird pancake - it's really important that the oil is hot enough before you start pouring the batter in!  Also, give the oil time to reheat to the right temp between cakes. The second one was perfect. I could actually feel my cholesterol going up with each bite! My hubby, who had never had funnel cake, RAVED about it!  I cut the recipe back to 6 servings and it made two HUGE cakes. Next time I will cut back to 3 servings and top it with choc sauce and whipped cream! *drool*

There's no need to look for another for this because this is IT. I never have to wait for another carnival and spend all that money on one of these ever again. I also added a tsp vanilla. I highly recommend this.

If you are looking for a great funnel cake recipe that both tastes good and has a good texture, here it is! I did mix in some vanilla and a little sugar before frying it. Also, I didn't turn them over just once - I found that it really helps to use tongs (not a spatula) to turn it over several times so that it will all cook evenly. They're fun and tasty!

My whole family raved about these funnel cakes! Soft & chewy with just the right amount of crispiness on the edges. I added 1/4 cup sugar & 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter as others suggested, using an empty ketchup bottle for easy pouring. Not that these need any additional fat but for authenticity, I brushed on a bit of melted butter before sprinkling them with powdered sugar & cinnamon....better than ANY I've had at the fair! AMAZING!

They were good, it was bit messy to make though. Be really careful with your oil make sure you don't get it to hot because then your sweet sweet delicious funnel cakes with be burnt. Which is a same. Unless you like crunchy burnt ones :)

Excellent!  I couldn't believe how easy it was to prepare these delicious funnel cakes.  The kids loved them.  I did add about 3 tablespoons of sugar and a half teaspoon of vanilla, as recommended by other reviewers.  These little cakes tasted just like the ones at the fair!  Thanks!

Looked this up on a whim one night when the kids were craving a taste of funnel cake. I added vanilla extract but otherwise left the recipe as it is listed here. Tasted delicious! My batter also went straight to the bottom so I made sure to stir the oil and drizzle the batter while it was moving. Solved the problem immediately!

This was exactly what I was looking for. I cut the recipe in half and added 1/8 cup sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla. I recently moved and couldn't find my funnel or my thermometer so I put about 1/2 to 3/4 cup in baggies and snipped the ends. I heated the oil on med-high heat and they turned out wonderful!

You can get the funnel cake sundae at Six Flags Great America for 9 dollars or you can make these, sprinkle with powdered sugar, scoop of vanilla icecream on top of the warm funnel cake and drizzle with Hershey's chocolate syrup.  Tastes just the same.  Yummy!  We made 4 homemade funnelcake sundaes, it was too much for a family of 4 and we couldn't finish it.  No need to double the recipe if you make the sundaes.  I did add 1tbsp sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla as suggested by others.  Thanks for the recipe.

Making these was hilarious fun. My kids loved them. The only problem was the recipe just didn't make enough! Next time I'll double it for sure.

I added vanilla to the batter and next time will add a little sugar to the batter too.  These were so great with powdered sugar and sliced strawberries atop.  
My girls and husband have conspired to eat these for every meal and change our name to the Funnel Family. Ha ha.

score!  this recipe is simplicity at it's best.  i too used a candy thermometer to measure oil heat, and it was around 300 degrees when i cooked the cakes.  they seemed to hold a lot of oil like  RBARTON70 mentioned, so will make the oil hotter next time and see if that fixes it.  very tasty treat =)

It took a while to get the hang of getting the funnel cakes to look right. I ended up using a large pastry bag and it worked better than the funnel. They tasted good and the kids loved dusting them with powdered sugar.  Would make again.

We really liked this recipe. I added some sugar and some vanilla extract, just like the fair. yummy. I didn't have a funnel so I cut the corner out of a sandwich bag, it worked good. Thanks for the recipe now I don't have to wait all year for the fair to get a good funnel cake.

These tasted like funnel cakes to me, my husband said they reminded him of pancakes but that they were really good. He had been craving funnel cakes and they cured the craving :-) Simple to make too :-) We also sprinkled our with cinnamon and some with chocolate icing and then the powdered sugar and cinnamon :-) Btw, our cinnamon is mixed with sugar in a shaker  for convenience when using cinnamon on stuff :-)

I made this for my sons bday weekend. The recipe was very easy to follow. We made one funnel cake, tried it and it wasn't sweet enough, so we added a half a cup of white sugar and we got the taste that we were looking for!

This is a good home made recipe for funnel cakes. I Did Not use the Deep Pan. All those who had problems with the mixture going to the bottom of that pan? Use a Regular Frying pan with 2"-3" of Oil. That will solve your problems.

These were delicious and perfect for my son's carnival themed birthday party! I added vanilla and had to tweak the flour to milk ratio a bit to get the perfect consistency because it was too thin at first and the batter kept scattering throughout the oil. But once I got it right they came out absolutely amazing and were a big hit! Also, I think it helps to let the batter sit for a while before frying.

I was craving a doughnut but had no yeast so I thought...mmmm, funnel cake!  The batter was too thick to go through my funnel so I used the ziploc bag tip. My first batch burned. These cook real fast! I did better with the second one which satisfied my sweet craving. It was good but I will need practice cooking them because mine didn't get as crispy as the ones at the fair.  Thanks for recipe!

These tasted great, but they just fell apart.  I think I might have needed more oil because they just hit the bottom, made a broken pancake, and browned.  I had to chase the little bits around the pan to retrieve them.  I'll try them again though.  Maybe I'll have better luck next time!

It took me a couple of tries to get the best cake shape, but no doubt this recipe was so good that we couldnt wait till the next cake comes out of the fryer so we can fight who will get it first. I just added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

Wow! This is a great recipe! I wanted to go to an outdoor festival today to get a funnel cake, but it was too hot! So, I decided to try to make one, and turned to all recipes, and SOO glad I did! I halved the recipe, and used 1 part whole wheat flour and 3 parts all purpose. I also took some reviewers' advice and added vanilla (1/2 tsp) and 2 tbsp sugar. Amazing!!! Tender on the inside, nice and crisp on the outside. Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipie and very easy!  I used 1/2 tsp instead of a tsp of salt. Also added the 1/4 c sugar & tsp vanilla as suggested came out yummy!!! took very little time to cook each one... about a minute on each side. ate most of them already so its time to make more!!!

These were great.  I only used one egg for the batter and one cup of oil for frying and it worked perfectly.  I also added one tsp of vanilla for a little extra flavor.  We will definitely be making these again.

This was a good recipe, but if youre gonna make it, you may want to us a funnel instead of a Ziploc bag. Much easier, or u can use a cup w/ a spout

My daughter ask me what I was going to make. She ended up making them. We also added sugar and vanilla to the batter. My husband asked for more. We put apple pie filling and cool whip on the top. Yum! I never had a funnel cake before, Thanks for the recipe.

I made this yesterday for my very picky mother who was craving carnival food.  I've tried a few other funnel cake recipes, and all were okay, but this one was really really good.  My batter came out a bit runny, but I had used extra large eggs, so I added another 1/4 cup of flour and it was perfect.  Per other reviewers suggestions, I added about 2 tablespoons of sugar and a dash of vanilla.  It was absolutely perfect.  In fact, she has requested that I make them again today!  Thanks for such a simple and tasty recipe.

I had a craving for funnel cake and found this recipe. Unfortunately, I didn't have any baking powder so I decided to use self rising flour since flour, baking powder and salt= SRF. I added some sugar to the batter and topped with cinnamon and sugar. It was very good. I'm sure it was because of the self rising flour but it didn't get "puffy" like it should have. Oh well, it still tasted like the real thing.

We love this recipe.  Shoot the fair's here charge between five and six dollars a piece.  My six year old grandaughter wanted these for her birthday party so we made up some big batches.  She had 50 kids.  We did use the orginal recipe and like another reviewer suggested used vanilla extract in half the batch.  Both adults and kids gobbled up the orginal as I think the vanilla added with the powdered sugar made it just a little to sweet.  I also don't have a funnel or pastry bag, so I put batter in a zip lock bag and cut the bottom corner edge. Turned out great.  Now we don't have to wait for the fair to come to town.  Thanks for such a great post.

I like this recipe... easy to make and it does taste and look like funnel cakes you get at carnivals. The only change I made was using bread flour instead of AP flour because that was the only kind of flour I had. Also, I used a clean, clear plastic bag (like the ones you see when you buy produce in the supermarkets), fill them with the batter, snip one of the edges and it made beautiful funnel cakes. I used tons of powdered sugar because we like out funnel cakes sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious!  I added swerve instead of sugar because I've been on s keto diet - (even though I totally cheated by having recipe with flour) and I added a teaspoon of vanilla & a pinch of nutmeg.

Very simple recipe. I loved that I could make this with ingredients I already had at home. I looked at the comments before I made the funnel cakes and decided to add 1tsp vanilla and 2 tbs. sugar. I'm not sure if it needed more sugar but it definitely needed something else. Even though it was a little bland it still "hit the spot" and is worth another try.

Love the way this turned out.  Made some strawberry coulis beforehand and sprinkled some confection sugar on top. Yum! Will try adding some sugar to the batter to this next time.

Excellent!  Be sure to have very hot oil before you start.  They should turn golden quickly, probably 30 seconds, then flip.  I used a funnel cake pitcher.

Like the others, I added sugar and vanilla. Without those additions, it would taste like bland fried dough.  I also used cake flour, which may have added to the fluffy and chewy texture

Followed the recipe without any changes.  It was my daughter's birthday and it was a HIT!!!  Can't believe how easy it was to make.  Only used my liquid measuring cup to drizzle the batter in.

Delicious! We needed to add maybe 1/4 cup more flour to the batter. I also added 1 1/2 Tbsp of sugar to the batter. It worked perfectly. I tried a regular kitchen funnel, but gave up because they were too thin of pieces. I was thankful that years ago (I'm guessing I've had this thing about 5 years now?) I bought a funnel cake pack that came with some mix and a yellow funnel thing. It worked a lot better.

Top with some powdered sugar and whipped cream? AMAZING!

The recipe was okay as written but rather bland we thought.  We also added sugar and vanilla and it was pretty darn good.  I use a sauce pan which makes a perfectly round portion for 1.

This was great!  I added my own splash of flavor too-- small, crushed bits of dried apples (about 1/2 cup)  and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, plus a few tablespoons of extra milk to the batter, and the funnel cakes turned out magnificent!   The extra bit of apple-cinnamon flavor really was great, plus the texture of this recipe was exactly what I remember from the fairs and amusement parks.  We used coconut oil, which is our mainstay in our household and dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon. I couldn't be more pleased!  Thanks so much for this basic recipe that we can use in many ways.  I can't wait to try this recipe plain and then drizzle dipping chocolate on it!

These are delicious- too delicious.  Luckily I had 4 kids in the house, so I didn't have the chance to eat them all myself.  I did add vanilla, but I don't think they need any sugar in the batter, the powdered sugar on top is sweet enough.

Great! Even better than the state fair.  I took someone's suggestion to add a tsp of vanilla to the wet batter and a tbsp of sugar to the dry ingredients.

I halved the recipe. As suggested, I added less salt, 2 tsbp sugar, 1 tbsp cinammon.  I think next time I will cook slightly less so it's not as crunchy and more fluffy.  All these ingredients were on hand, well done!

My son begged me to make these and they turned out perfect!  Now we can have funnel cakes whenever we want which may not be such a good thing. = )  They are easy enough to make any time so when friends come over we can whip some up!

OMG----just like the fair!! A little tricky using the ziplock bags, but next time I will try a ketchup or mustard container. I added a little more flower to thicken it---but next time I will leave the batter a little more on the thin side so it'll turn out less puffy. This recipe will be a nice treat since we only have these at the fair once a year.

I believe the recipe should ask to preheat the oil prior to combining ingredients. For those who aren't sure "where it went wrong" it sounds like the oil wasn't quite hot enough. I started to warm the oil before mixing ingredients and it came out great. :-)

Wow. I think I've had one funnel cake in my whole life because I can't see myself paying five bucks for one, and I'm not sure I even bought it. I just paid roughly 50 cents to make one for me and one for my wife and it was better than the one at the fair. AMAZING.

Delicious! Tasted just like I remember from the fair. We all got a little queasy after eating some. Nobody finished theirs. They are just very, very rich, but that's to be expected. So, these are yummy, but not for faint stomachs.

These were AWESOME but I have to admit I added 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla after reading reviews first. The recipe gave us 4 good size cakes that we sprinkled powdered sugar. I put the batter in a giant zip bag and cut tiny hole in corner to use for a funnel. I only made one the first night and the rest this evening. They taste even better. I ran out of veg oil so used a combo of olive oil and peanut oil(yes we were desperate for a funnel cake fix as are town is having a two week festival, LOL). The batter kept up perfect. Today i added some sliced peaches that had been soaking in sugar. MMmmmm YUMMYYYYYY!!!!!!!!! Just wish i had some vanilla ice cream LOL! A MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!

Yummy. I agree with the vanilla user. Also, you can use a squeeze bottle (like ketchup bottle) for dispesing in the oil. Great snack

Excellent!  Tasted just like funnel cake I had when I was a kid.  It was a little hard to get it to come out of the funnel fast enough (even when I thinned the batter), but maybe my funnel was too small.  So I put it in a pastery bag, held my finger over the tip to keep the batter from running out until I was ready, then squeezed it into the hot oil in a circular motion.  Perfect!

This was a huge hit! Everyone loved these funnel cakes. I did it a little different. I added vanilla extract and cinnamon. My dad and brother used pancake syrup on their's and as for myself, daughter, sister-in-law and Mother, we enjoyed it with sifted powdered sugar. They were great!!!

Fun to make with kids.    Turned out perfectly.  Use lots of powdered sugar, though!

However, I had a very upset stomach afterwards.  Too much oil, I guess.  Just a warning to the faint of heart.

Well, I did love these...but now my husband keeps bugging me to make them again and again.  Beware, they can be highly addictive, especially if you add some vanilla.

First off let me say that I'm not an authority on funnel cakes, its really not my carnival treat, but my hubby loves them, so when I prepared this recipe, he liked it, and so did I!  All in all we loved it, I gave it four stars only because of the batter, it was hard to manuever it in the hot oil, but once its done and sprinkled with powdered sugar(which is addictive by the way):) I loved it!
