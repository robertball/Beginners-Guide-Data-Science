I don't think I've submitted a review on the site before but this was so delicious that I felt compelled to finally write one. I didn't change a single thing about this recipe. It's perfect. Did everything and followed both the recipe and video- including the egg on top with spices, more sesame oil and green onion for garnish. Going to make it again soon but try out chicken instead of ham for something different. Thank you so much Chef John for such a tasty recipe!

Made this for my husband and I, it turned out  excellent. I'm a huge fan of fried rice and now I don't have to go to those buffet places to get it!

Used water instead of broth - still came out good but I think it would have been better with the broth. Also sauteed the vegetables beforehand as other reviewers suggested.

Excellent!  Lots of leftover ham from Easter and this recipe fit the bill. Easy, quick and delicious. Used mixed vegetables for a low prep version.

I made it using the exact recipe but I did add a tsp of dashi (soup base). The dish came out perfect and delicious.  I really recommend using the chili paste as it gives it a extra flavor profile. Dashi can be found on Amazon and in Asian groceries. This is a perfect solution when you don't have leftover rice.

Chef John hit another home run!  This is wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and we loved it.  I was a little worried about the amount of sesame oil but it was perfect.  I can imagine using rotisserie chicken or roast pork instead of the ham with the same results. This tastes better than home-made fried rice and there is very little mess to clean up. Hubby gave it a thumbs up and can't wait to have the leftovers with the poached egg on top.  Thanks for another great recipe.

This was very tasty and very easy to make. I did 1 tsp Chile paste because I was nervous 2 tsp would be too spicy, but it was not spicy at all.  I also only had canned peas, so I threw them in before the last 10 minute browning part. Thanks!

Being Japanese , I never would have thought of BAKING fried rice, but it turned out very well.  The only thing that I did differently was saut√©ed the carrots and onions a bit prior to adding to rice and meat.  Otherwise pretty pleased.

Fantastic method for fool proof fried rice.  I have also used this method for Indian, Middle Easter and Malaysian style as well.

So easy. I add in about 1/2 lb of baby shrimp w/ the BBQ pork and my kids love it. Every time I make it, they always ask for seconds.

This was SO easy and really delicious. I would definitely try it with different variations; this time, I made it as the recipe as described but omitted the peas.

Heed Chef John's wise advice--make Chinese BBQ pork ( Char Siu--recipe on this site )  and DOUBLE / TRIPLE the sauce that recipe calls for, for both the meat AND to pour ONTO your fried rice while you fluff it with a fork.  Char Siu and THIS "fried rice" dish are a pair that indeed work well together.  You'll get both that Asian restaurant fried rice texture and TASTE, that gets friendly with the Char Siu---and both together make one great meal.

Excellent- followed the recipe but cut it half for smaller serving. I did cook one omelette egg on the stove, cut it up and put in the finished dish. Will make again! Served with home made egg rolls!
