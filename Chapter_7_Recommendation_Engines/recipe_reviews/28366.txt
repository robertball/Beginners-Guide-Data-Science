We really enjoyed it! Instead of broiling, we put both chicken and marinated in a skillet and then let the sauce simmer. It made less sauce overall but the chicken was tender with flavor. Very good! We served with sushi, brown rice and mixed vegetables.

Perfect! By far the best chicken teriyaki I've tasted. Don't get rid of the ginger - I used 2T ginger paste, and it wasn't over-powering at all. You'll want to make a lot, because this chicken disappears fast. The sauce was so good we saved the leftovers to eat with rice once the chicken was gone.

My husband and I just finished having this for dinner and we loved it! I followed the recipe except for adding steamed broccoli and carrots into the sauce right before serving. We also served wasabi mashed potatoes on the side which was a fantastic complement. (The husband is still wandering around the kitchen nibbling on leftovers).

This was okay.  For those unsure of what you're getting here, it's a super sweet teriaki sauce.  I agree with other reviewers, double the sauce.  What's left after the marinating doesn't go far when using over rice.  I'm not sure about everyone else, but I had to strain my sauce after boiling for a little bit because the gross chicken juice/protein/whatever turned to scum and I had to get it off to make an edible sauce.  To make this really great, it needs some spice.  Add some hot pepper flakes or cut back on the maple syrup, it was just too sweet for me.

Great flavor! I used Mrs. Butterworth's because that's all I had, but I think real maple syrup would be a better, more distinctive flavor. I scaled this down to one serving, but I think next time I will make 3 times as much sauce and throw out what's left in the marinade bag, then use 1/3 for basting and 1/3 to drizzle over the top at the end (no need for the boiling/corn starch step). I also added rice noodles for a crunch.

I loved this recipe!  I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted dark honey for the syrup, regular cooking oil for the sesame oil, and powdered ginger for the fresh.  Was really quick and easy to make and tastes delicious!

I used this recipe as a sauce for traditionally stir fried chicken. I mixed the chicken in a sherry-cornstarch mixture and stir fried it and mixed the sauce ingredients to add to it when it was cooked through. This makes a very nice amount of sauce for you sauce fans. I cut down on the amount of water by 1/4 as I didn't intend to boil it down as the recipe called for. This is a nice easy teriyaki, and the maple syrup is a perfect sweet flavoring for it.

I don't know if Korean Teriyaki is supposed to be this spicy, but I was hoping for a sweet teriyaki sauce so I was disappointed.  I mostly tasted the pepper.  I might make it without the pepper or cut it way back.  It was edible, but there's better teriyaki sauces out there.

This is why I LOVE allrecipes.com... I read all the reviews and saw the one comment that said you could taste the pepper too much and I know I'm not a big pepper fan so I cut the pepper in half and I'm glad I did b/c even w/ half the pepper added you could taste the pepper it in the dish but it was a good amount for the recipe. I also doubled the sauce like others suggested and added some cooked stir fry veggies to the sauce before I served it over the rice and OMG.. This was DELISH! I gave it 4 stars b/c if I made it exactly as written I know we would not have liked it this dish. Even my picky teens loved this and asked me to make it again.

This was really good. I cut the chicken up into bite sized pieces just because I prefer to eat chicken that way when served over rice. The sauce is very good, but we like a little zing so I added some red pepper flakes after serving. Next time I will add some to the marinade. When thickening the sauce, make sure you mix the cornstarch with cold water before adding it to the marinade, otherwise you'll have clumps in your sauce.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I used pork instead of chicken, as it is what I had on hand. I served with brown rice and steamed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, and mushrooms). Delicious and healthy - thanks!

Just "ok". Needs some veggies and thicker sauce. I used vegetable broth instead of water.

We loved this recipe. I followed the ingredients but just added some scallions for a little added flavor. I sliced the chicken into strips and cooked it in a pan, served it over rice. I can't wait to use this as a marinade this summer for grilled chicken!

OH MY GOSH!  This is so yummy.  I tweaked the recipe a little.  I used less pepper.  Only 1 teaspoon.  I double the rest of the sauce as suggested by others.  I used boneless skinless thighs and grilled them instead of broiling them.  To thicken the sauce I used 3 tbls corn starch blended with 3 tbls water.  It came out perfectly.  I didn't make the rice the way the recipe suggested since I have a rice cooker.  I will be making this next week for the 4th of July BBQ we are having.

I think this was very good! To anyone who isn't using maple syrup - I ended up having to use a bit more than the recipie called for, table syrup isn't quite as sweet.

I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and marinated it in the sauce.  The only change I made in the marinade was to use chicken broth instead of water. Removed the chicken from the marinade, sautéed it in a large frying pan. Then I sautéed mushrooms, onions and a red pepper. Added back the marinade and simmered. I added a shake of Chinese spice, thickened the sauce and served it over rice. So easy and delicious!

I screwed up the recipe a little bit, but here's a warning for other people who might be thinking of substituting the syrup with fructose or other sugar substitutes--don't do it.

I enjoyed this recipe. I did think I overdid the pepper. I breaded and fried the chicken and then added the sauce with the chicken and cooked on the stovetop.

I didn't have any ginger so I left it out.  Like some others I just made up the teriyaki and simmered it with the chicken thighs.  I really enjoyed making my own teriyaki sauce, it was great! -thanks for sharing!

This was somehow too sweet and too salty at the same time. I love the base flavours of maple and soy, but everything was just too strong.

Too much pepper and way too much cornstarch. Probably 1/2 -1 teaspoon of cornstarch would have been enough. Sauce looks like gravy.

Made this last night with chicken wings and the sauce came out looking a little too thick and jelly-like.  The hubby wasn't sure if he wanted to try it.  He loved it!!  I guess I'll lower the amount of cornstarch next time.   Overall, delicious and will definitely make again!

I made this very simply with soy, Walden Farms Pancake Syrup, 2 cloves garlic, powdered ginger (didn't have the real stuff), and red pepper flakes. YUM!!! Just love it. I plan to use it as a dip, and drizzle over my chicken lettuce wraps!!! It's completely sugar free, and carb free! Walden farms makes dozen of syrups, dressings etc and this is by far my favorite!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so glad I made this. YUMMO!!!

I'd like to use seasame oil next time but couldn't find it in my cabinets! LOL! ;)

My (very picky) wife and I really liked this recipe. The only problem was that I couldn't find "dark sesame oil" and just used canola oil instead. We also doubled the sauce (since everyone here seems to like it so much) and used it on the leftover rice. Turned out perfectly.

This was OK. I cooked it on my indoor stove-top grill pan instead of the broiler. I reduced the amount of fresh ginger to 1 tsp. - as we don't like the taste of it that much but like a little bit of the tang.

Good, although could use maybe a little more something in it, and my chicken wasn't that tender.. But it makes a great sauce! I added green  beans to the sauce and it was good.
