We liked this.   We thought this was flavorful.   I made a few changes I used only 3 chicken breast and after marinating I sliced the chicken so it only takes a few minutes to cook before adding all the other ingredients.  I also didn't use all the salt, it doesn't need it.

The sauce was quite runny on this. I think the sauce needs to be thickened. I also thought this needed more seasoning since it was quite bland. Wasn't a fan of this one.

It was a very bland recipe. Needed more spices. DH doesn't want me to make it again unless I can add something to flavor it up. Maybe onions or diced tomatoes with basil. Lots leftover and had to throw it out.
