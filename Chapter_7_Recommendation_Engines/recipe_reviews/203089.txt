The peaches get 5 stars, the cooked cabbage get less.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand but I hobbled the salad together anyway.  The flavors were interesting and the plate looked beautiful.  I'll definitely try it again with the proper list of goods.

Yum! I found this recipe because I was craving peaches. I left out the olive oil and nuts, used red wine vinegar, and added some jalapeno for kick - turned out great. Thanks for sharing!

I thought it was excellent. Changes were (due to what I had on hand). I didn't have any squash, used frozen peaches.  Added a cubed chicken breast fried Italian style in a little olive oil. Used Romaine lettuce and used prepared raspberry vinaigrette. All in all it made a excellent light meal for 2. Thank you.
