Cajun Cabbage Soup Haiku: "Perfect spice for me, daughter said, 'eek! It's too hot!' Didn't like ketchup." I increased the onions, not having any leeks, and kept everything else the same, other than browning the slices of smoked sausage after the carrot step and b4 adding the cabbage as we like our sausage crispy around the edges. (I wish I'd used a full pound, b/c even slicing a 1/2 lb. thin, as the recipe indicates, didn't provide enough of a meat-to-veggie-bite ratio.) I found it to be both too sweet (from the ketchup), and too salty (from the Tony C. seasoning and the 4 bouillon cubes), and my daughter found it too spicy, and well, nobody requested the leftovers the next day, which is unfortunate b/c I thought it was pretty good, so I'm sad to say that this recipe probably won't be a repeat around here.

A great, hearty soup for a winter's night.  I made this pretty much as written - my changes being using a liter/quart container of organic chicken broth and 2 teaspoons of the Creole Seasoning Blend from this site (I try to avoid processed foods and additives as much as possible).  I also used an additive free turkey kolbassa for the smoked sausage.  The seasoning was pretty near perfect - a nice little kick from the creole seasoning and salsa and a touch of sweetness from the ketchup.  I would recommend caution and  don't add salt until the end (tasting first) - it was just about right without any additional salt as many of the ingredients already had salt in them.  I also found that I needed another 2 cups of broth - and it was still really thick (but we like that).  A definite "make again" and will try some of the variations suggested.

I’m guilty of reading reviews and the subsequent modifications to get ideas and suggestions for possible improvements. This is a great recipe, but I refuse to use ketchup on anything, so I used extra salsa, a can of rotel, chicken stock and water with  a spoon of”Better than Bouillon”, lots of Tony Chachere’s. We devoured this with fresh French bread smothered in butter and Parmesan. I’m looking forward to heating up the leftovers tomorrow!

I found this recipe while searching for more ways to use leeks.  I  lowered the sodium by using a cup of tomato sauce instead of salsa and ketchup. It turned out great.

I was looking for a way to get the odds and ends out of my fridge. This was perfect. I didn't have celery, carrots or leeks. I used a red onion and through in a half bunch of cilantro and 2 Tsp fresh lime juice. I also used kielbasa for the sausage. I normally always follow a recipe to the letter the first time I make it, but this is so versatile and the flavors meld beautifully. The best part was not wasting any food, It's way to expensive to let go bad.

I made some changes, 1 quart of chicken Stock in place of water and boullion,2 cans of diced tomatoes,used a whole onion as we love them,4-5 cloves garlic-we love them too. No ketchup per others reviews and used 1lb cajun sausage-we love spicy.No salt needed.used 1.5 cups of hot salsa. Added a bit more cabbage. the soup is more of a broth than a thick soup,but  we absolutely loved it.Had with crusty bread. Next time,I'll use 1/2 lb of chicken with the sausage.
This is really a keeper! loved it!

I browned the butter first then browned the onion and garlic in it. it added a roux type flavor to the base. I didn't have any leeks on hand so make it with 1 1/2 white onion and 4 large garlic cloves. I used canned diced tomatoe with jalapeno peppers, and added 1 1/2 tablespoons creole seasoning. Increased the catsup to 1/2 cup and added a bit more water. Sliced up 3 Evergood Hot Links....my husband loved it!

This recipe is a keeper - my husband said he really liked it. I made it as described, though it tasted rather insipid. I added 2 T of Tony C's Instant Roux and 1 T of molasses. This was for 2 servings.

This soup was excellent!  I had some leftover fresh cabbage and was searching for a soup.   I tweaked it a little and used hot 2 links of Italian sausage which I browned first then sliced, as well as some chicken andouille hot sausage. I also added a cubed potato toward the end.  I basically doubled the chicken stock to thin it out some. Will definitely be making this again.

Loved this soup!  Great flavor. Perfect for a cold or rainy day. Made as directed with a few minor substitutions. Replaced leeks with additional onions (personal choice because we do not like leeks). Following other reviewer's advice I omitted the ketchup and added extra of my homemade "mild" salsa.  Used my homemade creole seasoning, which has a little less cayenne pepper than some brands. Used the whole smoked sausage (14 oz.). Soup still had a nice "bite" without to much heat. Adding this to my list of favorite soups

Instead of bullion I used 32oz box of chicken broth and also used cajun seasonings. It was delicious, my wife had a bowl, I ate the rest for dinner and Lunch the next day at work! I will make it again! And next time I will use hot salsa!

I used 3 cups chicken broth instead of the bouillon because I'm gluten free. Great flavor still and just spicy enough but not too much. Felt like I was still eating somewhat healthy. I'll make it again for sure. Cures the winter blues!

I used tomatoes and green chili’s instead of the ketchup and salsa as previously suggested. I loved it right from the start but hubby took a couple times and then said it was better after it sat for a day! Definitely making again.

Cut the ketchup, add tomato paste, cut the carrots, add more celery, add greens, or peppers. Consider adding a half pound of chorizo. Great Keto recipe for us diabetics.

I made a few changes, and it turned out awesome.

1. I used Chili Sauce instead of Ketchup.
2. I used more liquid than it called for, as the amount called for in the recipe did not cover the cabbage for cooking, I added 3 cups of chicken broth on top of the buillion and water called for in the recipe.

Made with my instant pot. I usually try to follow as close as possible but my wife does not eat onions. I made it without onions. I used Uncle Johns Pride smoked sausage and Zaterans cajon seasoning. I also added 2 cups of chicken stock since it looked a little dry. It came out awesome. The next time I make it I will not sauté the cabbage and add only 1 cup of chicken stock. I set the instant pot for soup and set the time for 20 minutes.

I was surprised at how easy and tasty this was.  I had my doubts adding the sliced cabbage when there was hardly any room in the pot, let alone, room to saute at the bottom.  That said, I made some changes.  I used 4 cups of beef broth and one beef bouillon cube along with tomato paste instead of ketchup to make it more keto. I added a no salt Emeril Lagasse and hot smoked sausage. Except for chopping all of the veggies, it was easy and quick.  Almost fool proof if you don't oversalt it!

I liked this soup.  The only reason for the 4 star and not 5, is it was too salty for me, and I am definitely a salty kind of person.  I used veggie broth instead of the water, so it's all my fault.  The broth I used should have been unsalted.  I would make this dish again.  Live and learn.

Good flavor. Didn't add the butter. Next time will also omit the salt... Seasoning has enough on its own. Overall, really tasty. Perfect for a rainy afternoon.

I hate to rate recipes and then change them, but  Erin said we could mix it up so I used what I had on hand.  I browned 1/2 lb of regular spice ground sausage and set it aside to drain (this spread the meat out in the soup).  Didn't have salsa, so I used petite diced tomatoes and instead of ketchup, I used tomato paste.  The rest is per recipe and it was amazing!  Making it again this week!  Thanks Erin!

This soup was delicious! I added too much salt, I didn't consider the salt in the bullion cubes.  I added more water and a peeled potato to absorb the salt. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this! I made exactly as written except for the ketchup and salt that some others suggested. I figured I could add them both in easily if I thought the recipe needed it. I didn’t add either. It was plenty salty (And I like salt!) and I was afraid I’d like it less with the sweetness of the ketchup. But, it was SPICY! I don’t know if it was the creole seasoning, which I had never used before, or my salsa, because I do prefer hotter salsa. The salsa I used was medium hot.

The recipe left some room for interpretation as far as quantities, but I followed it as written for the most part. It got a bit spicy for me, but I think that was my own enthusiasm for the cajun spices and I used Cajun Andouille sausage, which is pretty spicy also. This will go on the list of winter soups for sure!
