This was great. I think the secret is the honey-balsamic sauce. I used regular pizza crusts and just baked them, and I also subbed bacon for prosciutto.

Absolutely lovely!  A fresh bright spin on pizza!

We made it with our favorite pizza dough recipe and baked it rather than grilling it, and it was still amazing!

I saw this recipe in the allrecipes magazine and thought it looked good. I was not disappointed! This was delicious! The only thing I changed was using bacon instead of the prosciutto (I'm not a fan) but the rest was the same. Next time i might use a little more bacon because, well, it's bacon! I used 3 slices of thick cut bacon. This is a quick recipe that I will definitely be saving in my favorites! I loved the sweet & savory flavors together.
