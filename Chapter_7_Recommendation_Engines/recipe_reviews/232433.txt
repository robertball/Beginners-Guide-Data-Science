YUMMY!  I used instant pudding instead of cook and serve (because that's what I had on hand) and Pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon (becaue I like the flavor better) and it was AWEOME!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was a hit at a party I brought this to, I just added dark chocolate and more cinnamon but other than that I am always going to make this for the fall and winter seasons. Thank you

I have made this recipe about 6-8 times now.  Its great because its a 2-loaf recipe, exactly what I needed.  My kitchen mixer can't handle 3-loafs.  The bread is very moist with the pudding mix inside.  Yummy.

This recipe is delicious AND easy! Super moist, I added a cup each of golden raisins and pecan pieces - yummy! It makes two large loaves, but I don't think either one is going to make it to the freezer!

Only had one pack of vanilla pudding so that's what I used. Also added ground cloves and nutmeg, vanilla extract and a drop of almond extract. Top with sifted confectioners sugar. Delicious !

This is the best  pumpkin bread ever!  I made it for my husband because he really likes pumpkin bread, but I really don't.  Now we are fighting over the second loaf - so glad it made two!

For my first time ever making bread, I followed the recipe (which I don't usually do). It's really easy and they came out great, just wish the pumpkin flavor was a little stronger. Will be making some modifications next time but all in all a good dense and moist loaf if bread.

Delicious! I also changed up the pudding to one box of instant white chocolate and one box of pumpkin spice. So moist and tasty and very easy to prepare!

So moist and delicious! I will definitely make it again. I also modified it to make a delicious banana bread. I just substituted mashed banana for the pumpkin, left out the cinnamon, added 1 tsp vanilla to the wet mixture, and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the dry mixture. It turned out fabulous!

It turned out great!   We ate one loaf and froze the other.  I did use 30% gluten free flower.

Excellent! I had both vanilla and banana cream pudding, so used both and threw in a small ripe banana for moistness and flavor.  Quick to mix and easy!
