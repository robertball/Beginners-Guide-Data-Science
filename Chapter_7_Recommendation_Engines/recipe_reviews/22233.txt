We often enjoy this wonderful coffee drink on cold nights in front of the fire. Leave off the whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles and add a scoop of quality vanilla ice cream. You'll think you died and went to Heaven! Thanks Renee

This is one of my favorite "dessert" drinks and can be quite special for company prepared tableside.  First, run a little lemon around the rim of a brandy snifter that will take the heat.  Dip the rim in sugar; pour in the brandy and liqueurs; set aflame so that the sugar is melted around the top of the glass; pour in coffee and top with whipped cream.

Though I'm not a big brandy lover, this was wonderful, even with 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipped cream! Thanks, Renee!

Very good and so relaxing!! I do have to add my usual amount of sweetener because I don't like black coffee. This is just very nice!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I expected a lot more after reading the reviews...I tried it both ways, with the cream as written, and with vanilla ice cream as suggested, and both were dismal failures.

One of my favorites, but it isn't original.  This is a classic called a "Keoke coffee", which I've ordered in bars/restaurants many times.  It's a bit of an uncommon recipe, so many bartenders don't know it.  Still, I've always liked it better than the more common coffee/liqueur drinks you usually see.  Fond memories of sipping one of these on a snowy weekend afternoon in Alaska... Mmmmm...

This is sooooo goooood! Made enough just for me reducing the ingredients down to 1 serving with the exception of using a full ounce of cr√®me de cocoa because I like the chocolaty flavor of it. This is the ideal after dinner coffee because it's like coffee and dessert rolled up into one. Nice blend of ingredients MADAMMOCHA!

Yum. I've always loved coffee nudges but haven't had one for a very long time. This was great and thanks for sharing it.

A friend from Oregon introduced me to this yummy cold-weather drink  several years ago.    Aside from calories, I have begun to being anxious while waiting for  cold weather arrived. This will definitely replace  the hot toddy we would fix when camping many years ago.  THANK YOU for posting this. I  had forgotten about the Coffee Nudge!. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
