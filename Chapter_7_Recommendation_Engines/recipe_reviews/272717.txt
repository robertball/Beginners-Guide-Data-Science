I scaled this down to 6 servings, and it still made 8 egg bites, using a standard size muffin tin. These are good, but just a bit too salty. I used Smithfield® thick cut bacon, and cooked it up myself. In hindsight, I would skip the salt in the recipe, as I feel that the bacon added enough saltiness. These would make a nice edition to a brunch table.

We loved them, I made no changes except I didn't add salt. I don't normally like tomatoes with my eggs, but they were very tasty.

Arugula is hard to find in my area and usually only comes in a bagged spring mix so I chose to use baby spinach instead. These turned out good and also re-heat well making them the perfect on the go breakfast for those busy weekdays. I think they could have used more cheese and will add some next time.

I agree with others that salt wasn't needed in these.  My store was out of the Smithfield cooked bacon so I used their thick cut bacon and baked it up in the oven.  Perfect!
I didn't have arugula either so I used romaine instead.  
My husband is going to love taking these to work in the mornings!
Thanks for the recipe !

Perfect breakfast bites for my wife to take to work.  I used spinach instead of arugula.   I will make these often.

Very convenient and delicious. I freeze a batch, put  a couple in a zip lock sandwich bag and bring to work. They thaw quickly!

I used the basic recipe and added ingredients that I had on hand, such as, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, pancetta, and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese.  I kept the cherry tomatoes as in the original recipe.  These came out amazing and now I have a healthy protein-packed grab and go breakfast.
I will be making these again.  Next time, I need to grease the muffin tins more thoroughly as I few stuck to the pan, but that is my error and easily corrected next time.

We love making egg cups - they're an easy, adaptable recipe that we can take on the go.  The pop of tartness from the tomato in these was perfect with the cheese and bacon.  I used a mix of spinach and arugula and I did the salt as written; we like our food salty!

My husband and I liked them very much. Perfect for a breakfast on the go, brunch or lunch. I read the reviews and didn't add salt as advice and I agree, it doesn't need it. I didn't have green onions so I substituted them with red onion. Added as well a little garlic powder. Very tasty!

We really liked these a lot!  They are easy to make and to eat!  I did have trouble with them sticking to my muffin pan, so I will try to grease them with Crisco rather than just use a spray and see if that helps.  Making half a batch I got 8 egg muffins!   I will definitely make these again!  Thanks so very much!

My family and I truly liked these, only thing I did was add a little bit of garlic  powder, I didn’t use salt and I added a little bit of fresh Parmesan cheese!

I didn't add the salt as the previous reviewer stated. I didn't have arugula on hand so I used cilantro. Great make ahead for on the go snacks and reheat well.

We love Smithfield bacon, so were excited to try these. It was so easy to make, and the kids had fun helping me. Great easy grab-and-go breakfast for the busy weekend! The only change I made (which was a great addition) was to add some chopped sautéed onions to the mix as well.
