With minor modifications, this is excellent.  Only 1/2 cup sugar (1/4 cup brown, 1/4 cup white), a teaspoon of cinnamon and butter rather than margarine.  The day before I'm going to serve I boil the carrots and puree them with the butter, sugar and vanilla, then refrigerate.  Just before baking, I add the flour, baking powder & eggs (if you add the bp too far in advance, it won't rise as nicely).

The new hit for the holiday table!  When my grandmother was alive, she'd have me go pick up the carrot souffle at Picadilly Restaurant. Now living in Texas, that option doesn't exist so I found this recipe and tried it for Thanksgiving. It was DELICIOUS...just as good as the restaurant...and is now officially part of our holiday menu. By popular demand, I made it again for Christmas. Try it! Weight Watchers...try the Splenda Baking Mix of sugar and Splenda to bring the calories down.

Like many other reviewers, I halved the sugar and added cinnamon.  It was more like a fluffy version of sweet potato pie filling than a souffle as I think of them, but it was amazing.  It does lose its puff as it cools, but it doesn't have the texture of a fallen souffle and I actually think the flavor comes out a bit more when it's slightly cooled.  I boiled my carrots until they were super-soft and used a food processor, but still had little carrot chunks; didn't hurt the end result at all though.  Would make a great holiday dish!

What a delightful way to prepare carrots.  I used about 2 pounds of carrots and a stick of butter instead of margarine. I threw everything into a large baking dish and gave it several good pulses with my hand mixer (hand held blender) until everything was nice and smooth.  My mom and grandmother went wild over this stuff and have since made it many, many times using Splenda.  I was even able to get my 5 year old to try some with cool-whip on top.  Very good recipe Carol.

My 15-year old son and I finished it all in one sitting!  Definitely use less than half the sugar (split white and brown 50-50) and half the butter.  It would also be nice with a topping of brown sugar and chopped pecans.  We topped our servings with whipped cream.  This could easily pass for a dessert!  Use all three eggs and the correct amount of baking soda and it will puff up nicely in a souffle baking dish.

This turned out incredible!  It melts in your mouth.  I did add a few dashes of cinnamon with the carrots and topped with brown sugar before baking.  My husband thought it was a bit sweet and should have been dessert, but I thought it made a great side.  Just be sure to cook the carrots until they are VERY tender, so they will mix well.  Definitely will make again.

This is marvolous. It has a nice light texture, excellent flavor and looks beautiful on a plate. I served it up in individual ramikens and that helped it cook faster.

I took the advice of other reviewers and only used half of the white sugar of the recipe.  Still turned out very sweet.  Got wonderful reviews.  Would add cinnamon or maybe nutmeg next time to give it more of a "holiday flavor".

the best way in the world to eat your carrots! i scrubbed instead of peeled & steamed instead of boiled the carrots (leaving the small amount of liquid with all the nutrients in it).  i halved the butter (instead of margerine) & the sugar (1/4 c white, 1/4 c brown) & added a tsp each of cinnamon, ginger & cloves! if u like carrot cake, u will love this so much u will want to save it for dessert! :)

I've been making this recipe for about one year now on a bi-weekly basis. My son and DH fight over the last spoonful every time. But I changed the recipe a little bit to make it healthier. I use 2 pounds of carrots, and I don't use any oil, butter or margarine. It just is not needed. It doesn't change the taste or texture at all and just adds calories. I also add a few drops of water when I puree the carrots. I also bake it in a loaf pan. If you are making this for a crowd you need to double the recipe or even triple it. Two pounds of carrots pureed isn't very much!Enjoy!

Wonderful basic carrot souffle.  I took it to the next level by using half white sugar and half brown sugar for more flavor (I only used about 1/3 c. of each and it was nicely sweetened.)  I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, extra vanilla, and a pinch of salt, as well as approx. 1/4 c. evaporated milk (half & half or cream would work as well).  The second time I made this, I added an extra egg, which seemed to make for a fluffier souffle.  BTW, since it's a "souffle," be sure not to grease your casserole, or it won't rise correctly.

I really did not care for this. It reminded me of sweet potato casserole, which I am very particular about. I don't like any side dish that taste just like dessert. I realized after mixing the sugar and butter that might be the case. The carrots have to be boiled almost baby food soft to blend easily with the mixer, otherwise it is very difficult to blend. I really hoped this would work at our holiday table, but it just didn't. Two servings were eaten and the rest got tossed. Carrot souffle might just be one of those things that you have had when you were younger to appreciate. Or, maybe I just need to find a recipe that suits me. I don't know.

Being from the south, I'm pretty familiar with carrot souffle and was excited to make my own. However, dreading the thought of peeling carrots, I went with a bag of baby carrots. Knowing that they would still take a good amount of time to boil down, I chopped them as well. They actually took even longer to boil than I thought, but I used the time to prep my other dishes. Unfortunately, I took the advice of other raters and cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. While the brown sugar was a great addition, next time I'll definitely use 1/2 cup of each. I think the people that thought it was too sweet must be northerners who've never had traditional carrot souffle before and wanted the carrot taste to be more prevalent. While it was still good, it just wasn't what a carrot souffle is meant to be. I also added a tsp of cinnamon, which I thought added a nice depth to the dish. I will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious!! I was a little sceptical about it at first but wow was I pleasently surprised!!  I did add about 4 Tbsp. of brown sugar over the top of the soufle before I put it in the oven.  It gave it a bit of a molassas taste to it.  It was delicious that way.  It slightly caramalized on the top.  It won rave reviews at my house.  A 5 star side dish you shouldn't pass up!

12/25/03 - Made it again for a Christmas Get Together.  Rave Reviews all around.  I did alter the recipie slightly though.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and then sprinkled brown sugar on top instead of powdered sugar.

This is an amazing dish! I made it for a potluck and now I am asked to bring it anytime we go to a party.  I used the other reviewers modifications (1/2 the sugar, used butter instead of margarine, and added 1tsp. of cinnamon) It is most important to use less sugar otherwise it is much too sweet.  This has been, by far, my favorite recipe on this site...but I am still looking!

I get rave reviews each time I make this. Just like the restaurants, I'm told!

Be sure to cook the carrots until they are very, very tender. Makes it so much easier to get everything mashed and mixed.

This carrot souffle is fabulous! It is light and fluffy and delicious! I halved the sugar and it tastes a lot better that way, you can actually taste carrots! The carrots would never get smooth so I processed them in a blender and they were perfect! Love this recipe!

I made a few adjusments to the recipe, I used butter instead of margarine and brown sugar instead of white (I also sprinkled some on top of the souffle before baking it), also I mashed the cooked potatoes before mixing with the other ingredients, it turned out nice.

Excellent recipe...very easy to make and my kids will even eat it!  I substitute all the margarine for an equal amount of applesauce to make it healthier and use half the sugar the recipe calls for.  It is delicious!

Great recipe! family was tired of the same ol' side dishes, so I gave this a try. I did use half brown/white sugar and added nutmeg. This was even better than Piccadilly's brand. Thanks!

Definitely a desert.  Very good at the end of a turducken meal.  Light enough that you don't feel like you are stuffing yourself, and sweet enough to hit the spot.

EXCELLENT Recipe I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and added pumpkin pie spice to taste.  I put all ingredients in blender to mix them till smooth.  The flavor is just out of this world - better than pumpkin or sweet potato

I absolutely HATE cooked carrots but I LOVED this recipe.  It's very sweet but the flavor grew on me.  However, next time, I think I'll take other's advice and cut back a little bit on the sugar.  I made a half recipe and my husband and I alone nearly cleaned up the whole dish!

This recipe is both excellent and versatile.  Prepare and serve as directed and call it a pudding or souffle, or pour it in a crust and make a pie. I suggest that you count o more than 15 minutes to cook the carrots, cut down on the sugar, and add a bit of cinnimon.

I love this recipe!!!  As do all of my girlfriends and family. It's easy to make and I love the sweetness.  I substitute the eggs with an egg substitue such as Egg Beaters (use a bit less egg substitute or it will be too eggy) to cut out unecessary fat, and it's still delicious!

Very good. Like other reviewers, I reduced the amount of sugar, using 1/4 cup each of brown and white sugar, and that was ample. I used half butter and half margerine, and also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the mix. Will definitely make again.

This is delicious!  I buy five lbs of carrots bi-monthly in my food co-op and needed a good carrot recipe.  This did the trick!    Just as others suggested, I halved the sugar and it is fantastic...thank you so much for giving me a recipe even my pick husband liked!

I used canned carrots that I drained & slightly heated for easier mashing.  I have also made it splitting the sugars 1/2 white, 1/2 brown and it is good either way.  My entire family will now eat carrots and I've had multiple requests for the recipe.

I added extra carrots, and it was fabulous.  When I first made this, I added a little extra vanilla and cinnamon; I would NOT advise doing this. It made the souffle taste more like french toast; you couldn't taste the carrot.

10 stars, hands down, this is the BEST carrot souffle recipe.   FOLLOW the advice of others and mix the extract and sugar (brown and white) one day ahead of time so the flavor will soak in.  --Boiled my carrots for an hour, used my blender/food processor for grinding the carrots, and then mixed in the rest. (saving the butter &  powders for the next day) ---This was so good, no one was even interested in my sweet potato pies because they were going on and on about this dish!

I want to make this recipe but have a question.  Can this be made completely today and served reheated tomorrow for a potluck or will it not be raised?  Some of the reviews suggest waiting to add some ingredients until ready to cook for rising purposes but if it is cooked how does it reheat?  I had something like this recently only with sweet potatoe, wow was it good

I made this for Thanksgiving. I did cut the sugar in half and use brown sugar. EVERYONE loved this. The kids ate it up and it was elegant looking. Do read reviews it does take some time to cook carrots to very well done. But so worth it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I did as most and cut the sugar in half, added a dash of cinnamon, but I also cut the margarine--for me real butter--in half.  AWESOME.  Actually easy, and the entire dinner party raved over it.

This was so easy and excellent!  It was a hit at a family holiday dinner. I did modify it slightly, based on other suggestions.  Instead of all white sugar I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown and it gave it a great rich flavor.  Made it the day before and saved the flour, eggs and baking powder until the day of-again based on a suggestion.  It rose beautifully!  Can't wait to make it again!

Wasn't the most beautiful looking but it sure was tasty!  I used canned carrots instead of boiling fresh ones to save time and it was still delicious. Even my husband was impressed!  I'll definitely be making this again... and I'll be doubling the recipe next time!

I love this recipe! I sprinkle it with brown sugar instead before baking. Even people who don't like carrots love it. You can halve the sugar and it is good as well.

I thought that this was way too sweet, and  it really wasnt like a souffle. I served it a Christmas dinner and nobody really touched it.    I can think of a lot of different ways I would rather eat carrots, so I don't think I will be reaching for this recipe again.

This was ok. The kids did not eat it and that was the reason I made it, my husband and I would've been fine with plain carrots with a bit of butter. I used 1/4c brown and 1/4 c white sugar and it was plenty sweet. I cant imagine it with a whole cup! I only used 2 eggs because I read reviews that said it was eggy and I dont like an eggy taste. I wish it didnt have a whole stick of butter, you could probably get away with less. I probably wont make again it wasnt outstanding and not very healthy.

This recipe was pretty good. My husband and 17 month old loved it. I mixed together some rolled oats, brown sugar, and melted butter and spooned it on the top before baking to add a sweet crunchy topping. A great way to get a serving of veggies.

I've never had a dish like this before, so I had no idea what to expect.The final result was delicious; light and fluffy texture (sweet enough to be pie filling), although not what I'd normally consider a souffle. I did have trouble with mixing the carrots. I boiled them until very tender, but with the electric mixer they still didn't want to break up and blend smoothly, instead flying in chunks all over my kitchen. So I moved them to the food processor, smoothed them out that way, then continued with the electric mixer from there. Could be they just weren't boiled long enough, but next time I'm just going straight to the food processor. Overall my family enjoyed it; happy to have a unique way to prepare carrots.

This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving table! I actually put all together in the morning and refrigerated it, and popped it in the oven about an hour before dinner ... it came out great! It is very sweet, so I may experiment with cutting down on the sugar the next time I make this.

I never had carrot souffle before, but decided to make this recipe for company. I was apprehensive, because I thought it sounded a little strange, but it was soooo yummy. Everyone loved it. It was sweet and had a custard-like texture.

I soft cooked 2 lbs of carrots I was meaning to par-boil.  Then I found this recipe to use them fully cooked.  What a pleasant surprise and a keeper.  My family was pleasantly surprised by this casserole.  The powdered sugar on the top is a very nice touch.  I followed the advice of 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup Splenda and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Perfect.

Piccadilly uses 1/4 cup of flour in theirs and no extract. Cinnamon is a great add to give more depth.  If it is too sweet you are not from the South.  You can take this anywhere and not be dissapointed with the reviews.  Somebody is going to ask you for the recipe!

So since I don't have anything to compare this to, I'm going to give it a mid rating.  

I think one should puree the carrots.  Before doing so, I recommend putting the drained carrots on a cheese cloth or paper towels to drain all excess water.  I didn't really get that taste of vanilla either, maybe dash more next time or add real bean in the puree process.




This was a bit watery, a bit chunky and not exactly what I was expecting.  It was delicious, as sugar & vanilla makes anything delicious.

Instead of 1 cup white sugar I halved it and used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Also, I halved the margarine and used 1/4 cup country crock spread.  I also added a little over 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I topped it with sprinkled brown sugar which created a nice little crust after the souffle lost some of its puff when it cooled.  Overall this is a great dish; not too sweet and everybody loved the cinnamon in it as well as the brown sugar crust.  I made this for a few family members for a dinner we were having and came home with an empty pan!  I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this...it was very unique in taste, smell and flavour. I thought I would stray from the usual type of boiled/roasted carrots. The only suggestion I have is cut the sugar in half.I used 2/3 of the suggested amount and I felt it would have been 5 stars if I had of used half. It's not to say I didn't like it, it's just that it seemed more like a dessert like other people say. I served this on Easter with ham, scalloped potatoes, and green beans:)

I followed sweet dolly's suggestions & used 1/4 white sugar, & 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also added a dash of cinnamon & nutmeg & ran the whole mixture through a food processor. It was absolutely delicious!

Hubby and I really liked this.  I did use 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup fluffy Equal (the kind you can cook with).  Next time I think I'll try 1/4 cup sugar/1/4 cup equal.  This is one we'll make again.  (Also I pureed the carrots in my food processor before I used the mixer.)

This was just OK for us.  It didn't taste bad but it's not something I'll probably make again since it was just a little bland.

Fantastic recipe !!  A BIG hit !!  The only change I made was not using all the sugar....went with 2/3rds cup.  It was sweet but not overbearing. Just my personal preference.

This was amazing! I have never made a souffle before of any kind, it was so easy! I read the reviews and used half white and half brown sugar. It was pretty sweet so I didn't add any on top as the recipe states. My friends raved as they scraped the remains from their dishes.

I have made this a few times with little adjustments each time i think i finally perfected it, at least for my tastes! I used 2 lbs of baby carrot ( so no peeling and cutting for me ;) . I do not have a food processor ( I am student on a budget) so the key to making this less messy was letting the carrots get really tender, that meant boiling them for about an hour. Also, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and only used 1/2 stick of butter and an extra tbs of flour. After baking i topped with marshmellows and i increased the temp for just a few minutes until the marshmellows nicely browned........It doesn't need them for sweetness but it compensates for how the souffle flattens after baking to make for a beautiful presentation. If you don't have as much of a sweet tooth as i do, just stick to 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar but I do believe i am in love with this dish!

Delicious and easy!   I reduced the sugar also and added cinnamon.  I will try a bit less butter next time to see how it affects the result.  It was very well received by our guests who are foodies.  We served it with vanilla yogourt on the side.

Outstanding with a few changes recommended by others. I used 1/4 cup white sugar and a 1/4 cup brown, instead of a full cup of white. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and crushed pecans on the top before baking. Delicious!

Very good.  My family really enjoyed this.  I knew it would be a sweet side dish so I served it with pork to complement the meat.  I did as some others suggested by using only 1/4 C brown and 1/4 C white sugars.  I also reduced the butter to 1/3 C, added 1 tea spoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  I put the cooked carrots in my vitamix to avoid lumps.  Really did not taste like carrots though.

Tastes very good but is too sweet. If I were to ever try this receipe again, I would use only half the recommended sugar and no powered sugar on top.

I absolutely loved this!!! Did 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar instead. I also added nutmeg and cinnamon. I baked them individual souffle dishes,m sprinkled powered sugar on top and served it as deseret. It was a hit! Everyone thought they were a cross between mini pumpkin and sweet potatoe pies. They were all shocked when I told them it was carrots.

As it is, I'd give this a 4, but with salt (I used about a tsp) and cinnamon (I didn't measure but just dumped a bunch in!), it's a 5.  I don't think it needs a whole stick of margarine/butter; I found that 6 T worked well, and I cut the sugar in half and used only brown sugar.  The end result is delicious.  It's great with chopped nuts and cinnamon sprinkled on top!

Really fun to make...does need the powdered sugar though to make it sweet enough to eat.  I don't have trouble getting my children to eat carrots so I think I will stick with raw and not go to the trouble to get carrots into their diet

Very yummy! I was affraid it would taste too "carroty", but to my surprise, it tasted just right. It was very easy to make, and I just called my mother to share this recipe with her too! I did sprinkle some cinnamon on top though before baking it in the oven. Once the hour was up, i added the confectioner's sugar and I let it cool down a little, and we put some cool whip on top...mmmmm!!

This is excellent! It is superior to most restaurant side dishes and makes a grand presentation at your table.  I baked it in a souffle dish that has "Kiss the Cook" printed in the bottom and I received several offers of a kiss after serving it for guests. I like the slightly granular texture. The taste is wonderful whether or not you reduce the sugar a bit. My family raved about it, even those you do not normally like carrots. It will remain on my "favorite's list" for holidays and family gatherings.

I am the worst cook in my family.  Really, I am encouraged not to cook for big family gathers. I am usually the designated drink and paper supplier.  This recipe made me the hit of the family Easter gathering.  Everybody wanted the recipe.  My family actually had the nerve to say that my cooking was improving.  Thank-you for your recipe.  I will use your recipes to plan all of my special meals.

This recipe is so easy and delicious, I reduced the measurements due to I was only making this for two people. My hubby asked for seconds and if i had really made this. It takes just like Piccadilly's.

Like so many reviewers, I decreased the sugar and used half brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon. I steamed the carrots, then chopped them finely because I wanted a chunkier souffle. My husband ate two large helpings of this dish. Thanks for posting!

This has become a Thanksgiving regular in our family.  It reminds me of a cafeteria dish at Pic-a-dilly in Houston.

I absolutely love this dish and so does my family.  I haven't tried making it with half the sugar like a lot of reviewers mention since I love sweet stuff.  I do add a little extra vanilla to it though.  As some have mentioned this could be served as a dessert and I have actually had something almost just like it for dessert at Indian restaurants (I don;t know what they call it but it was served as dessert for my brother's birthday by the restaurant).

This was great and the whole family enjoyed it.  I cut the butter and sugar in half.  Used a gluten free flour and granulated cane sugar since it has a lower glycemic value.  Could have cut back even more on the sugar and it would still be sweet.  Thanks for sharing!

everyone enjoyed this recipe but honestly i don't think any realized it was carrot and not sweet potato. i cut back on the sugar by half and it was still very sweet for our tastes. i used fresh organic carrots but ended up having to put them in the food processor to get the consistency right, even after boiling them for a very long time there were still large chunks that the mixer didn't seem to reduce.

It was still too sweet, even though I cut the sugar in half to 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also substitued 1/2 cup applesauce for the margarine, and that was fine. I added nutmeg and ginger, and I think that was a good touch. I also cooked it on the stove for a full hour to make sure it was soft enough to mix, and it was perfectly easy. My oven was busy, so I used my toaster oven for the same hour, and it was perfect! Just a bit too sweet, or I would have given it a five star rating. I can't imagine it with a full cup of sugar. I doubt any of us could have eaten it.

Excellent recipe. - Used brown sugar instead of white and cut sugar by more than 1/2 - used only a couple of tablespoons.  Also added 1/2 tsp of ginger - very tasty!

I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, and i wish i hadn't.  We like our carrots sweet.  I also used a combo of white and brown sugar.  Addedcinnamon.  It was great.

Oh my. Perhaps if I'd quartered the sugar, it would have been different.. but as it was all I tasted was sickly sweet sugar overload. It tasted like cake, but not in a good way. It tasted nothing like carrots.

After having this dish at "the restaurant", I decided that I'd give the recipe a "test run" before serving it at Christmas; it was an absolute hit with my mom (who's my worst critic). Therefore, I'll be bringing it as a side dish for the dinner with my extended family.

I finally got my 4-year-old son (who hates most vegetables) to eat carrots!  This came out wonderfully!  I made half a recipe and used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar and rounded up to two eggs since half an egg is hard to do.  My baby and husband inhaled the carrots and the 4-year-old ate all of his after finally tasting a first bite (we told him that they were "candy carrots").

I didn't have enough carrots on hand, but I had a couple of sweet potatoes in the fridge, so I added them.  I only used 1/4 cup sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  It was really delicious and not too sweet.

SUPERB!!!  My family LOVED this for Easter!  Beautiful color.  I cooked it in a flat 2 qt dish so that it wouldn't take so long in the oven.   Used splenda in place of sugar, egg beaters in place of eggs... FANTASTIC!!!  Did NOT put powdered sugar on top.... didn't need it.

I made this for Easter dinner.  Like others mentioned I halfed the butter and sugar, and the flavor was good.  One thing I will do next time: use canned carrots.  It would just make the process easier, and the souffle a lot creamier.  I gave it 4 stars since, once again, the flavor was nice, but I did modify from the original recipe.

Delicious!  I never had a carrot souffle before so I really did not know what to expect.  I replaced the sugar with Splenda and decreased the butter a little.  Next time I would use less Splenda.  But I think you should first try this recipe as written and then make changes the second time you make it.  I will definitely make this for Easter.

I have been looking for this recipe for a longtime. This is a excellent recipe. I made it for my dad because he had never tried carrots this way before and he told me that I needed to make it more often and that he never knew carrots could be used in such a way.  Great recipe!!!

I found this recipe as I was looking for a new way to serve carrot after ending up w/ a 50 lb. bag of them. I took it to our bible study potluck & it was devoured in under 10 minutes w/ rave reviews. We had pizza,fried chicken, cornbread & buffalo wings but the one thing that everyone couldn't get enough of was the carrot souffle, go figure! I did cut the sugar in half and used brown, but I probably would have done that anyway w/o even reading the other reviews. I added about 1 more tbsp of flour and ginger & nutmeg but overall it was basically the original recipe. Fabulous!!

Not bad. I didnt get the carrots real smooth, so it was a little chunky, but still good. My kids didnt like it.  I did cut the sugar in half. It was sweet but not real sweet. Definetly had lots of carrot taste, but sweet carrots. My husband and I liked it. Different way for carrots.

super easy!  I have never made souffle before, and this was awesome!  the only thing I changed was to half the sugar.  my 8 year old nomally don't like carrot much, he ate half of the souffle (that's 1lb of carrot!!!)  he stopped only because I made him save some of the rest of the family. thank you so much for such a great recipe!

Made this twice - once for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas.  It disappears quickly!  The first time I made it exact and the second time I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup but used Turbinado sugar instead of white sugar.  Delicious both ways.  I plan to make this often and again for Thanksgiving next year.  This one's a true keeper!

Made this again this year.  Again, a real winner.  I never have leftovers of this side dish.  It's wonderful with the sugar reduced to 3/4 cup.  This will be in my Thanksgiving lineup forever!

HEAVENLY! WAY TOOOO GOOD! DANGEROUS TO MY DIET!  I HAD CUT THE SUGAR AS OTHERS HAD SUGGESTED, AND USED 1/4 C WHITE SUGAR AND 1/4 BROWN, BUT I STILL THOUGH IT WAS REALLY SWEET AND MY HUBBY THOUGHT IT COULD BE A DESSERT. NEXT TIME I WILL CUT THE WHITE SUGAR OUT COMPLETELY AND TRY TO CUT THE FAT DOWN TO LOWER CALORIES. HAS ANYONE MADE A LOW CALORIE-FAT VERSION?

FAntastic!!!  Cut the sugar in 1/2 (at least) use brown sugar and dash of cinnamon.  I think you may even be able to get away with a little less margerine.  Excellent way to serve carrots or even squash or yams.

Sort of funny! I love carrots and I was the only one in my family that wasn't crazy about this dish. It was a texture thing for me I think. With that said let me stress again that my family loved it. I used splenda and halved the amount listed in the recipe. Also added a pinch of salt, cinnamon, ginger and fresh grated nutmeg. Reduced the amount of butter by half. I was trying to make it more healthful. Baked it in individual ramekins(just to look appetizing) at 350 for 40 minutes.

I made this for a group of people, and they all loved it and raved about it. I personally didn't love it, but it was pretty good. I used 2 lbs of carrots, did not peel them, and steamed them instead of boiling them. I pureed them in the food processor, added a bit of Cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  I halved the sugar and used brown sugar. It was still quite sweet with only 1/2 the sugar. I think this would be really good inside of a pie crust with cool whip on top.

Very yummy! I cut the sugar down to half & didn't top with the 10X and it was still very sweet. I think it needs more flour to give it more body.

Wow!  I don't even like carrots, but this was fantastic.  I had some leftover carrots in the fridge and needed to use them up.  I made half a recipe without difficulty.  I used half brown and half white sugar and used less than half the amount called for.  Four ramikens full cooked in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.  I will be making this for the next family getogether.

I thought I had botched this recipe because I didn't cook the carrots long enough. The (chunky) carrot souffle still turned out great! You know it's a good base recipe when you mess it up and it tastes great anyway! I did add a little bit of cinnamon as was recommended by other reviews. Everyone in the family loved it, even friends and extended family. Someone said it tasted like carrot cake.

Very good! Cut the sugar using 1/3 c. white and 1/3 c. brown, used frozen carrots, subbed oil for the margarine, and added a shake of cinnamon and nutmeg. Mixed it all in the food processor. Kids love this!

We served this at a celebratory dinner for our son. We followed the recipe exactly and we've had two very accomplished cooks ask for the recipe. Thank for posting it. I'm not known for my cooking abilities but this just might change my reputation.
Thanks again.

This recipe had great flavor, but was a little too sweet for our taste.  Next time I think I will cut the sugar slightly (maybe by a third).  

The only thing I did different than the original recipe called for was instead of mixing the carrot, sugar, vanilla mixture with an electric mixer (I had a very hard time reaching a smooth consistancy this way), I used my hand blender... this technique worked out quite well.  The carrot puree was very smooth and baked up to have a very nice texture.  The finished dish was very attractive even without the powdered sugar topping.

Quite tasty and a nice alternative way to prepare carrots

A perfect recipe for the holidays!  It tastes better than the cafeteria version, in my opinion.  I put the ingredients together the night before and refrigerated it and still came out tasting wonderful.  However, I think it would have risen a bit more if I had made it that morning.

This is a really easy recipe as long as you give enough time to let the carrots cook down. Also it has more of a carrot taste that the Piccadilly recipe.

We have a cafeteria called Picadilly's, and they serve carrot souffle which tastes very much like this recipe.  Terrific with chicken, or my favorite, liver.  Quick, easy, and full of flavor.

I followed others' advice in cutting the sugar to 1/2 cup and also making it 50-50 between white and dark brown sugar. In the future, I might cut out the white sugar and just use 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.

I also substituted squash for carrots and steamed instead of boiled it. Squash has more natural sugar and steaming preserves the nutrients better than boiling. 

Instead of one large soufflé, I made my in a muffin tin so I could take the mini soufflé muffins to a pot luck and serve them more easily. 

Finally, I garnished with bacon bits and minced onion instead of powdered sugar. The end result was a sweet-savory combination that got rave reviews.

Quite good.  I did think it was wayyyy too sweet, and I cut the sugar way down (1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar).  I'll definitely make it again and take the sugar out.  I might add a little salt and pepper, too.

Thanks for the recipe!

We liked this, and even enjoyed leftovers as a dessert. Spent most of the time chopping carrots really fine, and boiled them till super soft. First time ever tried a carrot souffle.

FANTASTIC recipe!!  I used to go to a Picadilly restaurant in Daytona that had the most amazing carrot souffle and I even found a recipe online from one of their cooks...it was not the same  :(  THIS was pretty much spot on!!  I did as everyone advised and used 1/4cup of brown and 1/4cup of white sugar instead of 1cup and it was PERFECT!  Unless you have a serious sweet tooth, use 1/2 cup  :)  I also added a little more than 1tsp of cinnamon, as others advised.  My step-dad made a face when I told him it was made pretty much entirely of carrots but he licked his plate clean!!  haha  And I kept telling myself "no more! last spoonfull!" and yet I ate and ate and ate!  GREAT recipe!!!

This was amazing! Tasted light and fluffy. I cut the sugar in half by using 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I cut the butter in half. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and I also crushed some pecans and mixed them with brown sugar and put on top. My husband and I ate the whole pan while it was still warm. Delicious!!!

I was kind of disappointed that mine didn't puff up like I thought souffles are supposed to.... but that could be because I cut the amount of sugar in half... I am glad I did though because I served it as a side dish and it was still very very sweet.. sweet enough to make it a dessert I think.... but everyone loved it and thought it reminded them of custard.... a little cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled over the top was good also so possible mixing in a little next time might be an option... not what I was expecting but a good recipe

Thought this was super easy to make, but a tad sweet. Perhaps I sprinkled a little too much powdered sugar on top. I kept thinking it would be good with some type of caramel or whiskey/bourbon sauce. It borderlines on the dessert side, but it is definitely tasty.

This was my first time making or eating carrot souffle. If you love carrot souffle, you will probably love this. I think I'm just not a carrot souffle person. Though I halved the sugar (using 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar), I found myself wondering why I had taken something that is so tasty without embellishment, and then mashed and buttered it beyond recognition. This was good, but I think I prefer steamed carrots with just a hint of butter and brown sugar.

My husband loved this but it was too sweet for me.  Maybe adjust the sugar level?  He would have given it a five and I a three, so that is where the four comes in!  :)

This has become my husbands favorite dish. It's not hard to make and it always gets rave reviews. We have added it to our Thanksgiving menu this year. I find it a little sweet but my family loves it just the way it's written.

I also cut the sugar down by half, and used 1/4 c white and 1/4 c brown sugar.  Used a blender to really puree the carrots with the butter and sugars, and the texture was perfectly smooth.  Still very sweet, bordering on too sweet, but very good.

I made this for Easter and took the advice of several reviewers by cutting the sugar to 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  It was absolutely the hit of the feast.  Everyone asked for seconds.  The next day my two year old nearly ate his weight in it because he kept asking for more every time he finished the portion on his plate.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I love this.  I cut sugar in half.  The sugar that I used was 1/2 white and 1/2 splenda brown.  Used margarine not butter.  My family LOVED this.  They thought it tasted like pumpkin pie.

This was okay.  I thought it was way too sweet to be used as a side dish.  I gave it 4 stars as I believe this would make a really nice pie.

Excellent!  Reduced sugar as suggested by others and added 1/8 tsp of salt.  Next time I will omit salt.  Very satisfying dish...it was a hit at Thanksgiving.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe. Everyone I served it to LOVED it. Even my more sceptical roommates. I only used 1/2 cup sugar and it was certainly sweet enough. I also dusted it with more cinnamon rather than icing sugar. Excellent. Could be served with whip cream as a wonderful dessert.

Like others, I cut the sugar in half and used 1/4 c. white and 1/4 c. brown.  Absolutely the best recipe - a staple for Christmas dinner!

I thought it would be smoother, and taste less like carrots, not being a huge fan of cooked carrots.  My husband LOVED this dish, couldn't get enough of it.

I used Firefigherswife's tip and cut the sugar down to half cup total - 1/4 cup white sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Also added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I made mine the day before Easter, and cooked it Easter afternoon.  It did not really rise like a souffle, but the texture was very light like one.  I actually just thought that this was OK - but everyone else at Easter dinner were crazy for it, so I will definitely make it again.

We loved the mixture with just butter, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract added. But once eggs, flour and rising agents were added and it was baked, it lost a lot of flavour. Didn't rise like it was meant to either. Maybe the fault is mine, though, and not the recipes. I intend to make this without the last ingredients added and without baking from now on and calling it "mashed carrots".

Based on the reviews, I made this recipe using 1/4 each of regular (white) sugar and brown sugar. I also used just the whites of the 3 eggs. Ultimately, It had a great flavor, but didn't hardly rise (like a normal soufflé) at all. I'll make it again.

I did 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar and it was still really really sweet. Even serving as a dessert, next time I'll do 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown. I live at about 7000 feet so I used less baking powder (1 tsp) and used the largest eggs we have (we have our own chickens and get all different sizes). At this altitude next time I'd like to try making with duck eggs.

Delicious with some of the modifications seen here.  Despite cooking the carrots for a LONG time, I could not get them smooth with an electric mixer.  Would probably try the food processor next time.  Am going to serve it, but with chunks of carrot :/

Very sweet, which made it seem more like a dessert than a side dish. I will definitely make this again but will take others' suggestions to cut the sugar in half.

This recipe is excellent.  4 stars when I followed the recipe exactly as written because it is too sweet just as other reviews have mentioned,  and it was more like a dessert.  It was perfect after I halved the sugar.  I also found that the vanilla Saskatchewan not necessary,  it tastes great with or without it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  BTW, I usually hate carrots,  but I love this recipe.

This is a dish I regularly make for holiday meals or the kids' birthdays. My 22 year old son just called me to get the recipe because he loves it so much, he wants to make it for his friends.

This carrot souffle was fantastic. I did find the sprinkling of confectioner's sugar on top while serving completely superfluous, but that was easily remedied. I am making it again(5 days after my first batch) with less sugar for less calories per serving, but the flavor is exquisite! Thank you SO MUCH for this recipe, Carol!

Although I must say that I was ignorant to the fact that this was supposed to be a dessert before looking at the ingredients(and, more specifically, their proportions...), I believe this to simply be a case of faulty naming than a faulty recipe, thus firmly contradicting Holiday Baker's review criticizing this aspect of my new personal favorite.
I might add that it took me 3 hours and 15 minutes to make this, having to boil the carrots for 2 hours and bake the souffle for 1, plus prep/assembly time.

All in all, though, I loved this dish! :) Such minor failings didn't deter me and they shouldn't deter you from trying this delight.

Very very good!  I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup and left out the powdered sugar and it was still plenty sweet!  I think I'll cut the sugar down even more.  Outstanding recipe and thank you for sharing.

I used canned carrots (drained), real butter and added a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg for spice.  Really good recipe and great side.

I made this with parnsips instead of carrot.  Felt adventurous and used 1.5 sticks of butter... too much.  Was a little on the greasy side, will cut back to 1 stick as called for.  I separated the yolks/whites and folded the whites in - still did not rise or make any difference really.  My family wanted it more "eggy" and custardy, so I will increase eggs to 4 + a yolk next time.  
1/2 white 1/2 cup brown for sure, and 1 tsp cin 1/4 tsp pumpkin spice 1/4 tsp nutmeg was the PERFECT amount.  Cook until top is brown, firm to the touch, and *slightly* jiggly.

OMG!  I'll eat carrots every day done like this.  I also (like some reviews) did a mix of brown and white sugar.  Glad I did.  I scaled the recipe down a third and used 11x5 pan.  Also glad, otherwise I'd be eating way more right now.  I boiled carrots for over 30 minutes till they were cut easy with a fork.  Like potatoes when making mashed version.  Yes, it's sweet, but carrots naturally are and I'm southern and like my carrots sweet.  The only thing that could make this better might be some pecans on top but my husband won't eat nuts in much.

I ended up putting the carrots in a blender and turned out great. It's sweet so next time ill probably use half a cup of sugar. The taste reminds me of casava cake.

It was an easy recipe to follow. I also changed the sugar to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I cooked it within two 1 qt pans for 1 hour.  Once cutting into the mixture, it seems like it could have stayed another 15 minutes.  
It was still very tasty.  Definitely would not use this as a main course.

I made this for church potluck and it was such a hit that I have been requested to make this every potluck and have been asked for the recipe by every lady at church. I eat this warm or cold.  I usually add a bit more vanilla to mine because I love vanilla.

I make this as a dessert dish.  We don't like super sweet desserts, so I upped the carrots to 2lbs.  Steamed until tender and used my immersion blender to blend it supper fine with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  Sometimes I do this portion a day ahead.  Then I add the flour, sugar and baking powder jut before baking.  Lovely, fluffy, melt in your mouth deliciousness.  Similar to a lighter, more delicate pumpkin pie, without the crust.  My kids and husband INHALED it.  And I love that I'm giving my kids "dessert" that's almost entirely vegetable.  WIN.  Two weeks after I made this, my husband came home with a 10 lb bag of carrots.  I guess I can take a hint ;)

I had a ton of carrot that I needed to get rid of so I had a luncheon and I made this recipe. It was a hit because we are sweet potato fans and it taste just like a sweet potato pie except it is carrots without a crust.

Guess I was expecting more of a rise?  Also, I should have read the reviews about pureeing the carrots - as mine were a slight bit lumpy.  Seemed like an awful lot of margarine and sugar too.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup - and I'm glad I did.  I probably should have reduced the margarine a little, too.  Nonetheless - this was delicious and my family loved it.

This was very good, tasted more like dessert to me (I made it intended for a side dish) but my husband liked it so much he had thirds!  Per others suggestions I also used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar....I would do that again.  I accidentally forgot the powdered sugar on top and it still had nice presentation, this dish is already so sweet I would make sure to very lightly dust with powdered sugar next time--it doesn't need a y help in the sweetness department!  Overall, very good dish!

This turned out great.  I used a food processor rather than a mixer to get the right consistency.  I also didn't use a full cup of sugar, maybe 3/4 cup.

I also reduced the sugars to 1/2 cup as one reviewer suggested (used 1/4c brown and 1/4c white) and the souffle still came out quite sweet - almost like a dessert.  I used a trans-free tub margarine for a healthier version, and also added 1 tsp cinnamon.  We really enjoyed the recipe this way, and I will surely make this again - but will substitute either egg white or egg sub to make it even healthier.

I don't have a food processor so I used my blender.  This was my contribution to a pot luck.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

I think this recipe has a great flavor- but is not at all a souffle. The texture is very smooth and light, but much more dense than a souffle.

I added nutmeg and cinnamon and served it with a chocolate sauce and pecans for a really wonderful light dessert. Everyone liked it, but we all agreed it should be called something other than a souffle.

I found it took me FOREVER to get the carrots soft enough. Like others mentioned, I used only half a cup of sugar, and I used brown sugar instead of white, also used butter and cinnamon. I liked the dish but my husband and 10-year-old only thought it was "OK" and my 7-year-old didn't care for it. Still, it was an interesting recipe and I enjoyed trying it, other than the carrots taking forever to cook.

I served this as a dessert using 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I expected it to be more like a souffle but it seems more like a pudding to me.  Regardless, it was delicious and different and was a big hit with my wife and the guests.  Kids were not so sure about it.  I would certainly do it again and maybe serve it with some whipped cream.

I topped this with brown sugar and it was oh so yummo!   No one would try it at first but after the first brave guest took a bite and announced it was delicious, it didn't last long.
