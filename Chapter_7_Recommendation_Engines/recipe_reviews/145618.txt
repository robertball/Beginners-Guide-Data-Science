This was quite good. However; hot dogs and cheeseburgers are a thing of my past. (High cholesterol has made them no-no foods in my world). So, I just tried this as a side dish, and it definitely has a sassy quality to it. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm trying to eat low carb, and this sauerkraut salad is perfect to keep in the fridge when a snacking urge hits!
