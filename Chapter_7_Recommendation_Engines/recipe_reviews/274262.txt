Turn out well; However I made changes, LOL!

Used adjustment feature for two. 

Looking at ingredients: List of spices is basically premade Curry powder.  So I looked at my curry packets and used Two teaspoons of Curry powder. Came out great! Omit cayenne depending on spiciness of curry powder.

I adjusted for one person, and chose to use the cayenne pepper as well. The flavors are sublime, and nothing overpowers the blend. 

However I'm on a low sodium diet, and I think the dish suffers a great deal by leaving it out (my fault of course, not the author). For others in the same situation, I suspect that if I doubled down on the spices per serving, it might be enough to bring out a stronger melody of flavor rather then sharing with the boiled potatoes.

I substituted coriander seeds and ground mustard because that's what I had. I use two potatoes, a whole chopped I onion and a half bag of frozen peas. Delish!

Really liked making this and it was super easy to follow!  I didn’t add any extras but did count calories when making this.
I used 600g of Russet Potatoes (I had to hand at the time) and around 100g of very finely chopped yellow onions.  I used the suggested amount of oil in recipe and same for spices.  For my family this stretched 4 servings and worked out at 225cal per serving.  Hope this helps!
Thanks for posting this recipe, we all really enjoyed it!

Loved this delicious recipe and even better, my notoriously " eat to stay alive" husband, as opposed to me, his wife, who LOVES food of all colors, ethnicities, tastes  and cultures, loved the recipe as well. The test of this was when he asked if there were any leftovers!! This was a great and flavorful potato dish.  Peas added another dimension. And best of all it was quick and easy!

Ok - if you don’t need this to be vegan I recommend adding a big  spoon of gee to the finished product. I found it very dry. Alternatively you could serve it with raita. Otherwise tasty. I added the peas, garlic and ginger. Would not omit them.
