We loved this, but I did need to add a bit of liquid to get it to the right consistancy...I also added a nice splash of evoo, and topped it w/ a drizzle of evoo, finely minced jalapenos, toasted pine nuts and paprika. This was a hit and I will be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was a nice twist on a basic hummus recipe.  The cilantro gave it a bright flavor which I liked.  It did seem very dry, so, I added a little more lemon juice and drizzled in a little olive oil.   If you are a fan of traditional hummus - you may not like this one because  the cilantro flavor hides the sesame taste you get from the tahini in a traditional hummus recipe.

I did add olive oil as I was blending it since it was a bit dry.  This went over really well with my picky husband! Next time I'm going to add more jalapeno for a spicy version.

Love this recipe.  Simple, fast and delicious. I agree with the other reviewers that it needs about 2T. of water to get it to the right consistency.   For a different taste,  I've also done it with a large roasted red pepper and 1t.  of smoked paprika instead of the cilantro and cumin.

Changes we made: added the juice of 2 small lemons rather than 3 tbsp, 2 oz of olive oil, and this was done in a nutribullet. It made for a thick hummus - my husband usually makes the hummus and adds a little water when using
