REALLY NO SUGAR 
thank you for actually posting a no-sugar granola with NO SUGAR!! It works well for me, I add whatever I have and use a generous handful on my shredded wheat every morning for a true NO SUGAR option!

This is a great recipe with NO sugar or fat!  You can add all your favorite nuts and some dried fruit.  I also put 5 drops (equal to 5 teaspoons) of liquid Splenda in the egg whites.  It turns out so crispy and nice!

I left out the coconut and added a little more cinnamon as well as a drizzle of honey before putting in the oven. 

Overall, it was decent for a sugar-free granola.
