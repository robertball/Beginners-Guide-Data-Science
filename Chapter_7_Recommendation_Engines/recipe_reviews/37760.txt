In a word, Awesome!  The family loved it.  I too substituted sour cream for the miracle whip and peeled the potatoes.  For convenience sake I used Hormel's real bacon bits and just threw in what I thought would amount to 6 slices.  These were excellent and a nice change from the standard fare.

I just did not like the taste of Miracle Whip...a bit too overwhelming for us.  Thanks for the post though.  I think I will tinker with this one to find a taste that suits us.

In the interest of saving time, I used 3 tablespoons of real bacon bits instead of actual bacon and this dish turned out great!

These were okay.  I don't like the taste of mayo and so thought it was too strong.  Other than that I didn't find anything special about them.

These are good, I was a little leary to use the miracle whip, as my two older children "don't like it" (baby is allergic to eggs, so he had plain potatoes) but they didn't even notice it.  They tasted even better with the gravy from Texas Ranch Chicken that we ate these with.  Thanks K-R-A-F-T

Not bad.  I think I'd like a little more flavor but I did enjoy them.  I will likely make these again.  I think I might try boiling the potatoes in a little chicken stock/broth next time for some added flavor.

I did find it useful to buy the precooked bacon to shop up and add instead of having to cook bacon in addition to the potatoes.  I prefer the Hormel black label brand.  There's much less fat than with the Oscar Meyer precooked bacon.  It's the perfect texture and doneness for this recipe.

I recommend this recipe.  It went very well with grilled steak and salad.

Yummy!  My whole clan loved these!  What a simple idea for a new twist on mashed spuds!  My only changes were adding a couple of tablespoons of dehydrated chopped onion to the potato water while cooking; substituting sour cream for the mayo; and using Oscar Mayer's Ready To Serve Real Bacon Bits to save time and mess.  Loved, loved, loved these!  My husband who's not a big fan of potatoes, declared that he couldn't remember ever enjoying potatoes this much. Thanks!!

very good. i used mayo instead of miracle whip. the flavor is much better. you might need to add some liquid or the potatoes will be too thick for most people. some people said this dish was bland, but half of them used sour cram. sour cream can easily turn something bland if too much is used, and that's very easy too do when the other ingredients used aren't very assertive. i thought this side dish was homey and tasty. thanks.

One word:  WOW!  So good that the hubby didn't even want gravy for the first time ever!  lol  I did add a touch more milk but that was the only change I made.  These were great the next day, also.  Super recipe!

Fantastic! What great comfort food! I didn't have Miracle Whip so I substituted the same amount of margarine and I used 1% milk and we loved the taste. I served it with ribs made in the slow cooker. It was a great meal for a VERY cold winter's night.

I just made these for dinner along with grilled steak.  Very good.  Our 2 year old loved them too.  I might add more bacon next time and also some green onion.  We had steamed veggies as a side dish and I heated up a can of cheddar cheese soup to go over those, but it was also very good over the mashed potatoes.  I will make these again.

These were really good.  I followed some of the other suggestions and just left the miracle whip out.  I used sour cream instead.  My husband isn't a big mashed potatoe eater but he liked these.  Will make again.

A nice alternative to the classic mash potatoes.  The Miracle Whip in the potatoes gave it a tangy taste which complimented the bacon.  I did make them a little to soon so put them in a corning dish, sprinkled cheddar cheese over the top and baked in the oven on a low temp.  When my meat was done, the cheese was melted and the potatoes were still hot.  Delicious!

The base for this recipe is great. Potatoes, Cheese, bacon, how can you go wrong? Add the salad dressing, that's how. Way over the edge for my tastes. I'll try it one more time but with sour cream instead of salad dressing.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated and they were yummy!  Even my husband liked them - and he doesn't particularly care for mashed potatoes or Miracle Whip.  As a note, to get the true taste of this recipe, you really need the Miracle Whip (mayo is NOT the same!)  It adds a little zing and extra flavor.

This was a GREAT way to serve potatoes.  I am sure I will use this recipe quite often now.  I had it with BBQ ribs that I had done in the slow cooker.  What a fantastic supper!

Thanks!

Not so tasty. Tasted very blah to me and my huband. Like it was missing something? We are not fans of Miracle Whip so I replaced that with sour cream. The reviews made it sound fantastic but unfortunately, we do not agree. I'm sure this recipe is good if you like Miracle Whip maybe??? Thanks for sharing though, it gives a great base to experiment with.

This turned out really good.  I omited the miracle whip, as we are not crazy about mayo.  I also used evaporated milk to make it a little richer.

LOVED this recipe! After reading other reviews I only used 1/4 cup of mayo so it wouldn't overpower the potatoes. Glad I did, they were perfect! Next time I'll peel half of the potatoes because there were too many peels for me. I'll probably add 2 more pieces of bacon. too. Everybody loved these as they were though. They didn't last long and I'll definetely make them a lot.

I liked the bacon and cheese idea, but not the miracle whip.  I only added 1/3 cup and it was still a little overpowering.  My husband is a miracle whip fanatic, though, and he thought it tasted just fine.

I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer regarding the Miracle Whip in this recipe - don't do it!! Sour cream is a great alternative, as is a little mayo or even Ranch or blue cheese dressing. Personally, I like to use extra-sharp Cheddar cheese.

I gave this 3 stars because the first time I made it, the taste of miracle whip was totally overpowering. However, I made it again and used sour cream instead...the results were awesome.  If you try this, DON'T use the M.W. unless you REALLY like that flavor.  Try it with sour cream instead.

These are soooo good!  I have never used any other recipe than my mother's, so this was living la vida loca for us.  Didn't have any bacon, but had bacon pieces (for salads) and "light" Miracle Whip.  Awesome!

This recipe was very good and had a delicious smell.  Like a lot of reviews, I changed the mayo to sour cream.  Sour cream is an excellent compliment to potatoes.  My husband thought it was excellent.  I'll add a little more bacon and a little more cheese the second time around.

I've never put Miracle Whip on top of potaotes, so why would I want to put it in them? I took the advice from other reviewers and used sour cream instead. With that minor change these mashed spuds were out of this world!

these were ok but not worth the extra effort. My kids left most on their plate.With gravy they would have been better, but not any better than regular homemade mashed potatoes.

We loved this recipe!  I used mayo instead of Miracle Whip, because we don't like it, and I didn't think the taste was too strong of mayo.

This recipe was good, but I think next time I will only use half the mayonnaise it calls for and a little more garlic.  It tasted a lot like mayo this time.  Overall great recipe!!  It's a keeper!!

These were very runny and "okay" at best. I took other's advice and used sour cream instead of the salad dressing. I think it might have been too much like potato salad to me the original way. I will not make again but it 'worked' for a side to "Aussie Chicken".

This was okay.  I used sour cream instead of Miracle Whip (I usually use butter, milk and Mayonnaise), and I wish I had stuck to the recipe.  Liked the bacon, didn't care for the cheese and garlic.

Left out the salad dressing and used instant potatoes and heavy cream instead. Turned out fine and pretty tasty. My kids wouldn't have anything to do with them however. Also, added some chives.  Tastes like a loaded baked potato.

These were delish! Very rich! My hubby went crazy over these! I doubled the recipe using 8 oz. package of bacon and used real mayo and a bit more cheese.I did peel potatoes parcially.    After I got it mixed they weren't hot anymore so I put it in a 350 oven for 15-20 minutes until heated through.I would serve these anytime and it would really be nice for any special occasion. If you like bacon and cheese you can't miss with this one!
