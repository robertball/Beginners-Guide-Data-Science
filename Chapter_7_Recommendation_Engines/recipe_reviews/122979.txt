I made these using my own recipe for the sloppy joe meat mix, then followed the instructions for freezing and thawing. They turned out great and can't be beat to instantly fulfill a craving for sloppy joes! I appreciate that you can just thaw one at a time. The buns did get slightly dry when reheated in the oven, but I think baking them for a shorter time would help that. I was worried about them getting soggy and that didn't happen at all. I'll be making this again!

Great recipe. It was so nice to find a sloppy joe recipe that did NOT include ketchup. We make this often. Thanks!

My husband and I really enjoyed these- they were very easy, and it's great to have on hand in the freezer! In trying to make them a bit healthier, I didn't use the sausage...instead, just doubled the ground beef. The buns do get a little crunchy in the oven, but I liked that. However, I found that if they come straight from the freezer they need  little more time to get warmed al the way through. Definitely will make again!

I love making these. They are very kid friendly, and I'll send them to work with hubby if we don't have time in the morning to make something up.

I did not freeze them. We ate them right away. I got mixed reviews on this one. My husband did not care for them. I thought thay were okay. My 10 year old daughter loved them. If anything they are kid friendly.

I don't know if I used a bad brand of sausage, but these tasted so salty. I will not make them again.
