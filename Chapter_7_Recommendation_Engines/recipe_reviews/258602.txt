These muffins were super simple to make and taste great!  I had some leftover pureed carrots (homemade baby food) that I needed to do something with.  I used this recipe because it was the only one I could find that DIDN'T call for grated carrots.  
My Modifications: 
1/2 wheat flour & 1/2 almond flour
8 ounces pureed carrots
