I looked at several Waldorf salad recipes before I settled on this one, based on other reviews.  I wanted to find a recipe I could throw all that leftover Thanksgiving turkey into!  

It's very good, I added a little more lemon juice to counter the sugar sweetness (a good idea is to chop the apples first and then drench them in the lemon juice to keep them from browning!), and where folks had either grapes or raisins, I used Craisins (sweetened dried cranberries) to complete the whole leftover turkey-with-cranberries, apples and celery experience!

I took the advice of other reviewers and tossed the diced apples in the lemon juice first in the bowl and I needed to add more to coat them.  I used Miracle Whip Light instead of Mayo and it was delicious, though I needed more than called for of this too, basically just put in enough to coat everything.  Sunmaid makes a bag of raisens called "mixed raisens", they are huge and extremely plump and moist and were simply perfect for this salad.  I also added diced chicken to make this a dinner salad and I served it on sandwhich croissants.  It was a huge hit with my guests, everyone just loved it!

This is a perfect traditional waldorf salad recipe.  Very good on its own, but I was trying to recreate a salad they have at a deli near my house "tropical waldorf salad" so I started with this as a base and added mandarin oranges, a little pineapple, cranberries and some coconut and it came out perfect.  Great either way!  Thanks

A very good Waldorf salad recipe.  I didn't peel the apples, I toasted the walnuts, and instead of raisins, I used 1/2 cup dried cranberries.  I added the walnuts just before serving so they would stay crisp.

This is good, a solid 4 stars, but it could be better.  First, there is too much dressing.  The apples and walnuts kind of swim in it.  I'd decrease the mayo to about 1/3 cup, and add an extra apple.  The amount of walnuts is fine, but make sure they're chopped very small or they taste a little bitter.  The celery is a fabulous addition, adds great crunch, and the recipe could actually use just a little more than it calls for.  The raisins I'm undecided on.  I didn't like them at first, but they're growing on me.  With or without, this recipe is a good one.  By tweaking it a little, and using very crisp apples, this is a five star recipe.  Thanks!

I omitted the celery, kept all the other ingredients the same. I used both red delicious and golden delicious apples---absolutely no need to peel them; the different peels add color and taste just fine. also used both golden and dark raisins; this made for a more colorful salad too. Excellent recipe, everyone loved it!

I added the chicken breast and also added some red grapes.  I served it over chopped romaine lettuce and made a meal of it.  I took it on a picnic to the zoo (I put the lettuce and salad in separate large ziplock bags to conserve space in the cooler), and it was a big hit.

There is no need for salt, lemon juice, or sugar.  Cut up the apples last and immediately mix the mayonnaise in.  It will do the same thing the lemon juice does (keep the apples from browning).  The salt and sugar just baffle me entirely.  Walnuts and apples provide plenty of sweetness.  

It's your standard basic Waldorf Salad recipe.  Easy, delicious, nutritious ... even tastier if you add cooked chicken to it.  Grapes and/or raisins are another variation, but I don't often use them.

Good variations would be using plain yogurt instead of mayo.  Slightly different flavor (a little sweeter, for those that want that) and lower fat.

So simple. So refreshing. We can't do nuts because of allergies, but it's great without. I usually toss the apples in the lemon juice instead of putting it in the dressing.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  Classic Waldorf Salad ... perfect!    Tripling the recipe, I used three Granny Smith apples, three Galas, and three red-skinned heirloom apples (wish I could remember the variety) from the farmers market.  Don't peel the apples (and resist the temptation to use barbarisms like cool-whip. yogurt, salad dressing or *gasp* marshmallows!).  I thought the proportions were perfect -- not too dry and not too goopy/runny, by the way  Thanks!

I love Waldorf Salad, but I used Miracle Whip here, and left out both the sugar and salt, opted for large pieces of walnut and celery, and added seedless black grapes. I also put the lemon juice in the bowl first, to coat the apples as I cut them into chunks. I don't want them to brown while I'm preparing the other ingredients.

This is a great, basic Waldorf Salad recipe.  I must have been confusing this with another recipe and I bought red and green grapes to put in this.  Well, when I realized my error, I put them in anyway instead of the raisins.  I toasted my walnuts (350 for 8-10 minutes, or until fragrant) to enhance their flavor.  The dressing for this is just right, not too sweet and not too lemony.  We enjoyed this one very much!

I made this the first time for a party. How risky.  Used all the ingrediants listed.  Made sure the apples were freshly picked.  For the raisins I used two kids of raisins, and several flavors of dried cranberries.  Because I made this for a very large crowd I upped it by 4xs.  With the Mayo I used enough that it just covered the ingredients.  The result of all the mixed flavors was amazing.  Different flavors were popping all over the place.  This is a very easy recipe that even the most inexperienced cook can make.  (I choose not to use any chicken.)  Because of the fruit this tasted sweet.  There are a lot of coolwhip recipes like this, but using the mayo was much better that coolwhip kinds of recipes.  I will make this often.

This is definitely 5 stars based on ease and apperance. I added purple grapes chopped in half about 1 cup) - it looked very pretty! I also didn't peel the apples - more fiber and they don't get discolored. My daughter and I really enjoyed - was good alongside some broiled chicken. I will make again!

It's better if the celery is chopped about the size of the walnuts.  Also, I prefer using about a cup of grapes instead of the raisins.  And do use part of the lemon juice to toss the cut up apples with.

BTW - if you add marshmallows, you no longer have Waldorf Salad, you have Ambrosia, or at least a version thereof.

I make this every Thanksgiving. Good as a side dish or a lite dessert. I do soak my raisins in water for about ten minutes-this softens them.

This was really good!!  I used golden delicious apples & substituted quartered seedless red grapes for the rasins.  Put the apples in water with a little lemon juice to keep them from browning.  I'll make this again.

A very simple salad that's great for lunch. I used splenda instead of sugar and apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice.  I also used a combination of lite mayo and lite miracle whip.

Just the flavor I was looking for. A wonderful holiday addition. There were no leftovers of this dish from Thanksgiving. Will take it for Christmas potluck at church and have again at Christmas dinner at home.

I used very ripe golden delicious that left in the fridge for quite sometime. Also, I used fat free miracle whip, toasted walnuts. didn't follow the amount of nayo suggested in the recipe. I just put miracle whip that's enough to coat all the dry ingredients. very yummy! Thanks Penny for the simple and nice recipe.

I don't care for celery, but leaving it out doesn't hurt the recipe a bit.  I used miracle whip for a sweeter tangier flavor, didn't use salt, and used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  I think a tart/sweet apple works best in the recipe - I really like Fuji and Gala.  My family is not a huge raisin fan, but if I put the raisins in boiling water for a few minutes to plump them up, I usually don't have any problems getting them to eat them.

I made this for a ladies lunch and it was a hit.  I added baked chicken, subbed red grapes for the raisins, and also used lemon juice to keep the apples from turning brown.  Very good.. will make again!  OH I forgot... I serve on croissants and the butter flavor added was awesome!

I made the following changes to this recipe to create a Waldorf Chicken Salad.  First, I reduced the apples to just one large apple, which I tossed with 1 tsp/ fresh lemon juice to prevent browning.  I used a single stalk of celery instead of the half cup and I diced it instead of slicing.  I substituted 1/3 cup of toasted, chopped pecans for the walnuts and a cup of halved seedless red grapes for the raisins.  I then added 1 1/2 cups of diced, cooked rosemary chicken (thigh and leg meat).  The result was amazing and better than the Waldorf Chicken Salad that I had enjoyed at a restaurant last week.

This was very, very good.  We made this for my baby shower and it was a hit!  We used the new mayonaise made with olive oil and added in some chicken.  We served on croissant sandwiches.  Didn't change anything else from the recipe.  Will DEFINITELY make again and again and again

It has been years since I've had Waldorf Salad this good....and so easy to make.  I chose to leave the peels on the apples...but followed the rest of the recipe exactly as it is. Very good! Thanks!!

I always enjoy this salad at dinner parties and luncheons, but have never made it at home. This is a keeper. I coated the apples in lemon juice, cut back on the mayo, cut out the celery all together, and added more nuts. Tasted just like my nana's salad when I was a kid! Thank you!

This is a delicious recipe. I would not change a thing.  I have been looking for a good Waldorf Salad recipe.  I mixed the mayo, lemon juice and sugar and added the apples first to coat and then added all other ingredients and mixed well.  The apples have not turned in 3 days.
Will definitely make again.

I have always wanted to try a Waldorf salad and after looking at all of them, I chose this one.  I am so glad I did.  It was perfect!  It was on my menu for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I only changed it a little.  I used pecans instead of walnuts because I don't like them.  I also used Red Delicious apples (didn't peel them) because I was making an apple cake with Granny Smith.  I read on another recipe that they used halved grapes instead of raisins and that turned out great.  The salad was a hit.  This will be a staple on my menues from now on.

Perfection!  I use red delicious and granny smith apples and leave the skin on. It looks very pretty and you get the nutrition of the apple peel. I am so glad I ran across this. It is going to be part of our Thanksgiving dinner. It is delicious and it is refreshing with all the other rich and caloric dishes on the table.

This is really good. You can use peeled or unpeeled apples (coat unpeeled in lemon juice to prevent browning). Add grapes for a little more sweetness and pecans are good as well. :)

This is a lovely refreshing salad!  It is such an enjoyable first course. My husband thought it strange to have an apple salad but now he's a convert...  I used Jonagold apples which is a lovely crisp but mellow tasting variety.  The dressing was perfect. Celery, raisins and walnuts complement it very well.   Thanks for such a delicious recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to leave the apple skins on. Why peel off the most attractive part?

Not mind blowing but worthy of 5 stars for being good at what it's meant to be! Being Christmas I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins & added 1/2 cup halved red grapes, & also used pecans instead of walnuts (because that's what I had). I not only tossed the chunked Fuji apples (skin on) in a teaspoon of lemon juice but also went ahead & added another teaspoon to the dressing. Assembled Christmas morning & this was a really good side dish at dinner later in the day, fresh & cold & not too sweet!!!

This is my dad's favorite dish and I chose this recipe to make for Thanksgiving.  It was a total success - he LOVED it!  

I made one small change and substituted cranberries for the raisins.  He suggested next year I use cranraisins.

Nothing earth shatteringly different here-- it is a simple Waldorf salad recipe.  But simple is often the best, and it deserves 5 stars. Delicious recipe. Even those not crazy about Waldorf salad liked it.

I love this forgiving recipe!  No need to peel the apples.  Add a bunch of halved red grapes and use slivered almonds if you are out of walnuts.  Replace sugar with splenda if you wish.  This is my favorite snack.

Fabulous!  I loved not having to peel the apples.  I used two different kinds of apples--one had darker green skin than the other, and I used dark raisins for contratin color.  I hate measuring lemon juice so I just squeezed in the juice of half a lemon.  It worked just fine.   

I'm serving it for dinner tonight on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce.  I need to stop eating it so there will be some left to serve!  :-)

Generally was good, but I felt it needed a bit more dressing which I added.  Also depending on the type of apples used (I used Honey Crisp) you might need a bit more sweetner and I used some honey.

Very good recipe. Followed recipe exactly but left out raisins, due to the fact I'm not a fan of raisins, and it turned out perfect. Not too much dressing, I had used 4 rather large apples and the dressing coated them perfectly. I will definitely make this again!!!

Very good, light and refreshing!  I used 2 yellow and 2 red delicious apples and subbed dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Next time I will leave out the celery, didnt need any more crunch and it gave off a weird taste and I will add more walnuts and possibly grapes.

PERFECT RECIPE! I used four apples instead of three and used craisins instead of raisins, but only because I wanted to, not because I needed to. This is the perfect classic Waldorf recipe, exactly as it is written. Thank you for sharing! :)

Great Waldorf Salad, and so easy to make. I used cranberry/raisin mix instead of just the raisins, which gave it just a little extra zip. Rave reviews from all!

Great recipe. Planing on doubling the recipe for Thanksgiving so I can use the leftovers and chop turkey to add to it for tortilla wrap sandwiches.

Absolutely excellent!  I added some cooked, chopped chicken and took it to a fish fry.  It was the first empty bowl on the table!  I have made this several times and it is excellent on it's own or stuffed in a pita pocket.

I thought this was delicious! I admit that I did not have everything on hand. So, I made some changes. I used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt. I used orange juice since I had no lemons. I used almonds since I had no walnuts. I used raw honey because I prefer it to sugar. Mmmm!!!

I doubled the ingredients and made this recipe for a baby shower and received lots of compliments. I added a pint of blueberries and substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. I made some little adjustments to the salt and sugar to my preference which I am sure everyone does. It was so good! Thank you for sharing!

Perfect!  I went to the bulk section of my local Sprouts and found just enough raisins and dried cranberries (yep, added some) to make this salad pop.  Also, I cheat and use the pre-sliced apples I get at Sams and just dice these up.  The lemon is important for my than just preventing the apples from browning, I think.  Great, fresh flavor.

I personally did not care for this salad mixture; too lemony & way too mayonnaise-y. (I prefer to use Miracle Whip in my Waldorf's, but willing to try new recipes.)

Very good! I used light mayo with lemon and honey for the sauce. I also left the peels on my apples for color and used cranberries instead of raisins. Delicious!! Could add chicken to make it a meal.

Great recipe, easy & pretty on the table!  I prefer a more traditional version & this was it.  I made a huge batch to serve a crowd & left skins on to save time.  I used a 50/50 combination of golden raisins & craisins just to add variety.  I coated the diced apples w/ lemon juice & only put about a cap full in the dressing part.  Will definitely make this one again.

Delicious recipe.  I did use glazed pecans rather than the walnuts and tossed the apples (unpeeled Gala and Granny Smith) in lemon juice before adding the other ingredients.  My grandmother makes a similar version adding miniature marshmallows...this is worth a try, too.  I look forward to making this again.

Simple and delicious! A big hit at the potluck. The dressing ingredients tasted just right although I didn't use all of the dressing. I used unpeeled Cameo apples (sweet and crisp). I used Craisins instead of raisins. Used walnuts as suggested.  Didn't have celery so used a crunchy mini-cucumber. Recipe proportions are right on.  I made a 'mostly' Waldorf salad. Quality produce is critical.

Hadn't had waldorf salad since I was a young girl until my 5 year old asked me to make, "make that salad with apples and mayonaise like grandma does."  This recipe is excellent!!!.  I doubled the recipe, except for the mayo and added some sour cream.  Also used a fresh squeezed lime because I did not have any lemon juice.  Will definitely make this more often.

OK I'm keeping this one.  I've only had waldorf salad better than this ONE TIME and it was at the Waldorf-Astoria - The waldorf salad there had champagne grapes in it and was piled high and wrapped in thinly sliced smoked turkey.  This recipe makes for an awesome healthy, delicious, and fibrous summer lunch or brunch.  PERFECT for work day lunch breaks!

I tossed the apples in the lemon juice first as others suggested, and then added the other ingredients. Don't make too much more than you need though because this only keeps for a day or two afterwards.

I don't like raisins so I used grapes (cut in half)instead also instead of the celery I used celery seed. The celery seed gave it a great flavor and a nice appearance. Nice holiday dish, will make again.

Excellent! I haven't had Waldorf salad since I was a kid and it's exactly the way I remember it. I added a little milk to thin the mayo - I like mayo but it was a bit strong. I also added a bit more lemon. It was so good! The whole family liked it - which is amazing considering there are 6 of us. This one goes into the permanent file - thanks!

The mayonnaise flavor in the dressing was too strong.  I don't reccommend this one.

Why do they have celery in these salads?  I think they taste terrible.  We put in vanilla yogurt instead of mayo and sugar, and had grapes instead of raisins.  The only bad part was the celery!

This is my first time making Waldorf salad. I had some walnuts I needed to use and thought this might be a great way to use them. It was easy, delicious, and a big hit at my dinner party. I even managed to convince a friend who hates Waldorf salad, with this recipe.

Thank you for the receipe.  The dressing proportion to fruit and celery is nice . . . not too mayonnaisey, as some can be.  I had to omit the walnuts this time, but I look forward to that addition next time I make this.

Good traditional Waldorf salad.  The only change I would suggest is tossing the apples in the lemon juice which requires using a little extra lemon.  Very tasty!

I doubled the recipe, except used 3 teaspoons lemon juice (two with the apples, one with the dressing).  This turned out so good!  Brought it to a group gathering and everybody loved it.  I ate what little was left over for lunch the next day.  Will definitely make again, very easy.

Crisp and yummy! I added about a cup of lovely fresh green grapes and it was an excellent addition. Also reduced the mayo just a smidge to about 1/3c. Still plenty of dressing. Thanks for the great recipe!

I looked around for a waldorf salad with added ingredients, but still came back to this one due to the great reviews. I made it and it was ahuge hit with the family! I guess in this case less is better. AMAZING!

Penny, thank you so much for this recipe - I thought it was delightful.  Such a refreshing change from your usual green salad.  My husband is allergic to walnuts, so I subbed smoked almonds.  They gave a lovely subtle taste to the salad.  I also had threw in a few dried cranberries as others suggested.  Will make again.

I used too much lemon juice (use less next time), and the mayo was not real tasty.  Use real mayo, not the kind with olive oil.

Great "base" recipe. Like others,I tossed my apples in the lemon juice (used 2 tbsp) before adding the other stuff. I also added 1/2 cup chopped dried dates and a 1/2 tsp corriander. Excellent! The whole family from my 60yo mom to my *horribly* picky 4 year old loved it! Will try adding chicken next time.

I also agree this is a fantastic salad!!!  I changed just a little as our family like things a little sweeter, I added a little more sugar, about a 1/3 cup of sour cream and a little nutmeg, omitted the raisins and added craisins!  Most Excellent!!!

This is a nice summer/spring time salad.  I didn't have alot of raisins, so I added Crasions (dried cranberries) and that made the salad even better.  I also added a little cucumber.  I think the recipe calls for too much mayonnaise, I would cut back on it next time.

This is a great simple recipe, but I do make a few changes. I add chicken and it's a great meal. For the dressing, I use lime juice and honey. Gives it a slightly sweet taste. Also, there is WAY too much dressing for the amount of ingredients.

This was a good basic apple waldorf salad. Used dried cranberries instead of raisins. It didn't have enough flavor for me, so I added a little pep. Added about 1 Tbsp of dijon mustard to a double recipe and sprinkled in about 1/2 tsp orange zest. Orange marmelade or frozen orange juice concentrate might also work. If you are looking for traditional waldorf salad this hits the mark, but you may want to enhance the flavor as I did. After that, I received several compliments at a potluck.

I used 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 Miracle Whip and our apples were so big that I only needed 2 but this was great! (Because of nut allergies I had to leave out the walnuts.) We will definitely have this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit as an appetizer for my families Thanksgiving dinner.....I used a mixed fruit blend (raisins, cranberries, cherry and blueberries- bought in a bag at Sobeys) which added even more flavour to the salad.  I will definitly make this salad again!!

This Waldorft Salad recipe tastes just like my mom's.  I didn't have any raisins but I did have dried cherries. Mom always told me to make due with what you have instead of running to the store.

When my daughter (6 years old) and I were making this, my husband said, "Oh, yuck! Who puts apples and mayonaise together?" Today, he had TWO bowls of it! I did alter the recipe just a pinch.  I added a little more sugar because I used 2 Granny Smith apples and a Pink Lady (my fav!) and didn't want it to be too tart.  I also did NOT use any lemon juice and we're on day 2 and the apples are still beautiful and not at all brown.  I did add chopped walnuts, purple and green seedless grapes, celery, and raisins mixed with cranberries and blueberries (I buy 4 bags for $1 at the Dollar Tree in my town!).  The colors are beautiful and very summer-ish!  Tastes great and is kids love to make it!!

Recipe was a great start.  I made according to the directions including added raisins.  I didn’t peel the apples, but used an apple core / wedge doohickey I have and then chopped the apples and tossed in lemon juice.  After tasting the finished product, I decided it needed something more.  I added about a 1/2 chopped orange, a handful each of quartered seedless red and green grapes, and a sprinkle of sunflower seeds.  The added flavor of the orange and grapes did the trick for me.  I like it with both fresh grapes and raisins together, and think other review suggestions of craisins (cranberry raisins) would be good too.  I don't care for the consistency of the chopped orange in the salad, and having now read other reviews I see one that mentioned using some frozen orange juice concentrate.  Next time I will try mixing some frozen OJ concentrate in with the mayo for the flavor of the orange and skip the fresh chopped orange.

My mother sometimes made this salad and I quickly threw it together for some drop-in company. I reviewed the recipe and made the salad. After making it I realized the recipe did not call for cinnamon, which my mother always included. I think it adds a nice flavor.

This is a tasty, basic recipe for the classic Waldorf salad. I used orange juice in the dressing instead of lemon juice, but soaked the chopped apples in water with a tablespoon of lemon juice while chopping and several minutes before mixing with other ingredients. I added halved seedless grapes and 8 0z. of cubed sharp cheddar cheese, and also used the jumbo three-grape mix by Sunmaid mentioned in other reviews. I replaced the white sugar with Xylitol part for part and used light mayo (plain lowfat yogurt with an additional tblsp. of Xylitol works well, too) to make this salad a truly healthy treat. I used much less dressing than called for in this recipe. With these supersweet, juicy raisins and the grapes, there is no need for anything but a very thin coating.

My first attempt at making a Waldorf salad.  Made this for Christmas.. Did not measure just eyeballed... I did not want it too creamy or full of mayo so just used a tiny bit of mayo mixed in with the sugar then added a little bit of Cool Whip.. Used Craisins instead of raisins.  Turned out pretty good.

I was given some rhubarb at work and a coworker said it works good in Waldorf salad, and she was right! This was a great basic recipe to try, substituting the rhubarb for the celery.  Adds a nice twist, kind of sweet and a little sour.

This is an easy, yummy salad!  Rather than add raisins, I add halved red grapes, and I toast the walnuts before adding them for little extra flavor.  I am making this again today for a party and will try tossing the apples in lemon juice since I have to make it a few hours in advance.

I haven't had a lot of Waldorf Salads in my life, so I'm not sure how to rate this recipe. I thought it was decent and I would make it again. I guess I'm just thinking about some variations because I think it was a little lacking.

Very good (that is, if you like Waldorf salad).  I used a combination of Granny Smith & McIntosh apples.  I omitted the raisins and used seedless grapes instead.  Also, I toasted the walnuts and added some toasted coconut.

Skip the sugar, you don't need it.  The apples and grapes along with the glazed walnuts I used gave it plenty of sweetness.  I added a can of chicken meat to the sliced grapes, apples, celery, glazed walnuts and a good squeeze of lemon juice with the mayo.  Skipped using the raisins and made a sandwich out of it on whole wheat bread.  YUM-YUM-YUM!!!  Will be making this Chicken Waldorf salad often!

Very good! I used more walnuts and added more lemon juice (probably 2 tablespoons) and i used sultanas instead of currants. Will definately put this on a regular rotation :)

Very tasty indeed. Thanks for the recipe. I used some tips from the other reviewers i.e. coating the apples in lemon juice and using the Sunmaid raisins.  I also added a wee bit more mayo since I added diced chicken. 
I took this to work and shared it with a friend who also loved this salad. This is a keeper for sure.

We really enjoyed this refreshing salad. The different flavours compliment each other perfectly. I followed other reviewers' advice and used lemon juice (2 tsp) to coat the apples. With diced chicken added, it becomes a five stars keeper!

I like this recipe a lot.  It is fairly easy and taste great.  I make it with no sugar and grapes cut in two instead of raisins.  I don't think it is necessary to peel the apples.

Very good. I suggest you get a very firm tart apple and add nuts just before serving.  I omitted lemon juice and added vanilla yogurt for added flavor as my apples weren’t very tasty .

Added 2 small cans of chicken (would have been better with cubed). Didn't have celery, wished I did. Seemed a bit bland so added about a tablespoon of horseradish dijon also (though was straight horseradish, I wouldn't have used as much). BE SURE to roast the walnuts as brings out flavor. Will definately make again.

Very good salad, not too mushy or saucy. I also added green grapes cut in half. I also put aside some of the mixture minus the lettuce (only a cupful) I ate this the next day as I wanted something sweet and it was perfect. Next time I may put granola on top. The salad itself was loved by  all.

Yum. this was made with a few changes.... I added 3 teaspoons lemon juice, one of sugar and maybe a 1/4 c mayo. Only one apple one celery stalk and a handful of walnuts and dried cranberry's. I love more lemon flavor in the dressing.

I made this Waldorf Salad at the request of my MIL for Mother's Day. This is a great base recipe which is perfect as-is!  

But just for personal preference, I made the following changes/additions:

Used 3 large Honeycrisp Apples (On sale for $2.49/Lb at Kroger right now)
*Used 1/2 cup Miracle Whip (in place of regular Mayo)
Substituted 1 tsp of lime juice (in place of 1 tsp of lemon juice)
Added 1 cup of green seedless grapes & 1 cup of red seedless grapes (cut in halves)
Added 2 tsp of fresh squeezed O.J.
Added 1 tsp of vanilla
Added 1/2 cup of raisins
Added 1 cup of mini-marshmellows

It turned out absolutely amazing! ??

*The only thing I might try different next time is to use 1/2 cup of Plain Vanilla Yogurt (in place of 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip)... which I will come back and update my review after doing so! ??

Delicious! I chopped the apples first and tossed them in some extra lemon juice to keep them pretty. Instead of raisins, I had some dried cherries on hand and I added halved red grapes and chopped turkey meat. It was incredible! I will absolutely be making this again!

I've been making Waldorf Salad for years and it's always a hit at Christmastime pot lucks. I prefer the holiday colors and flavors of Red Delicious and Granny Smith apples best. I use regular raisins, chopped pecans, chopped celery and I prefer Miracle Whip salad dressing. As long as every apple is coated, there's no need for lemon juice, but if in doubt or without, sprinkle a little Fruit Fresh to keep the apples from turning. There's just something about the combo of Miracle Whip and the Red Delicious apples that kicks it up a notch. For an extra treat, stir in a cupful of mini marshmallows before serving. The grandkids gobble it up!

I cut the mayo by half but it still needed a bit more sauce so I used a little sour creme.  That brought it together nicely.  I also added a tsp of tarragon.  Since I was out of fresh grapes, I used about a third cup each of raisins and craisins.  

I haven't had Waldorf salad since I was a kid and my dad made it.  It brings back memories and the flavor was just right.

I did everything exactly as it said EXCEPT I left the sugar out and used an 8 ounce container of Cool Whip. I'll definitely be making that again. Calorie-wise it sucked but it was sooo delicious.

I love waldorf salad but I do make it slightly different as I also added romaine lettuce.
Unless I did something wrong,I put the apples in a large bowl added the lemon juice then added all the additional ingredients.  I then mixed the salad dressing and added that to the bowl.  I felt the dressing was way to lemony! 
I have had a waldorf salad before with Balsamic dressing.  I will make it that way next time.

This recipe comes closest to what my mother used to make...almost identical! It is easy and tastes delicious. Due to the fact that my granddaughter is allergic to nuts, I substituted with grapes cut in half. (My mother used grapes also.) very pleased with results

Super easy. I toasted the walnuts mixed with the sugar until the sugar was melted. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out great!

I have made this a variety of ways using this recipe as a base. I made this with  raisins, some shredded carrot, and some sliced grapes.  I like to change things up, so I will adapt this again in the future, but even this classic recipe is delish.

I followed the recipe and it was very good.  However, the next time, I'll cut the mayo by a third or simply add more of the ingredients to reduce the fat.  We gave some to our neighbors and got a genuine thumbs-up.  A keeper.

This is a nice simple recipe. I added some shredded rotisserie chicken and a bit of cayenne to the dressing and this is lunch for the week. Even my husband liked it and he was incredibly skeptical watching me put it together.

I guessed at 3 apples. Picked two gala and one green Granny Smith. No raisins.  Used about cup of small red grapes. For main meal browned 1 lb of turkey breast fillets. Adjust mayo a bit for turkey. Add a little nutmeg to compliment walnuts. It was a hotweather main dish winner. To stop apples browning, tossed in lemon juice right away. Very tasty.

Love this refreshing salad. I grew up thinking my mom just made this up herself.  The celery combined with the crisp crunch of the apple & nutty flavor is a must combination.  The only thing I tweaked was adding a dash more sugar to counter balance tartness of apple.

I was slightly skeptical about this recipe, but now I am obsessed!  The celery is a must. It adds a great crunch. I cut up my apples that I needed to use up and eyed the walnuts and celery  and used two of the individual boxes of raisins. I also tossed the apples in the lemon juice because that seemed right, about 1 tbsp. Yum yum!

Good stuff!!  But I did increase the lemon juice to add a bit more "bite."  Used a mix of raisins and dried cranberries.  Also substituted local pecans for the walnuts, holding them out for individual use (or not) due to some family members with nut allergies. Went over well at a family gathering.  Will make again.

The lemon juice I doubled so we had a subtle hit of lemon flavour in the dressing. Took this to family Easter dinner to go with the ham and everyone loved it, even my fussy, hard to please father. Don't leave out the lemon juice, it's really there to add a bit of acidity and flavour  to the dressing. I left out the raisins as my husband detests them.  I used Jazz apples and they held up well and were very tasty. Leftovers were excellent two days later.

1) Used dried cranberries in place of raisins and left the peel on the apples. Nice crunchy salad
2) Per another review, added a little orange juice to the mix.  Again very tasty.

I choose not to put raisins in and I also garnished with red seedless grapes and walnuts. It added color. I also sprinkled a little cayenne pepper on the walnuts. The recipe is quick, easy and taste great.

Delicious easy salad. I used Honeycrisp apples and drenched them with the lemon juice. I can see swopping the walnuts out with sunflower seeds and  Craisins to change it up. Will definitely make again.

Like many reviewers, I needed to reduce the amount of mayo, which brought this otherwise 5 star recipe down to 4 stars. I often add grapes for variety along with cran-raisins (instead of golden raisins, but it's all good). I no longer add walnuts because they are rather bitter for my taste; instead, being a Southerner, I use candied or regular roasted pecans. When I don't have celery, I just toss in crispy romaine lettuce before serving. This recipe lends itself to many additions such as adding blue cheese. Indeed, a good basic recipe.

I made this salad and followed the recipe exactly, but I was very disappointed.  My husband and daughter didn't like the taste of mayonnaise in the dressing.  The combination of the apples, celery, walnuts, and raisins taste fine, but the dressing is nothing special.  Will not be making this again :(

It reminded me of my youth when mom made this salad; however, the mayonnaise flavor was intense and I made again substituting 1 cup Greek Yogurt and 1 to 2 tbsp Rice Vinegar for the mayo also used dried cranberries as an alternate to raisins .  Kids liked better, but the celery is the next challenge. Sigh, I will probably have to fall back to a fruit salad.  ;-)

Delightful! I used almonds instead of walnuts and added poppy seeds to the dressing. Very Good!

My Grandmother challenged me this Thanksgiving to make something I've never heard of before. When I asked her what a Waldorf Salad was, she said she knew I could figure it out, and it would be wonderful. So thank you for making a recipe that was exactly what she expected.

I've never even eaten this salad before! It was an easy way to use leftover apples for a Thanksgiving potluck party I was going to. My friends RAVED about how good it was! Also, I'm in Russia with limited resources so it was a quick fix and appealed to the taste buds of Americans and Russians alike :). Simple! Delicious! **I should also mention that I "doubled" the recipe, but ended up only using 4.5 apples because I felt that it would be too dry with any more. I also used 1/2 red delicious and 1/2 granny smith (the mixed apples added flavor!)

Not bad. This Thanksgiving, I wanted to try something new in place of my usual taffy apple salad. This fit the bill perfectly. I do feel this needs a bit more sweetness, but that's just my opinion. Other than subbing dried cranberries (i.e. Craisins) for raisins and not peeling my apples (personal preference), I made no real changes. For a bit of variety, I used both Red Delicious and Granny Smith apples. I'm looking forward to adding leftover turkey to this so that I can have turkey salad sandwiches for lunch all week long! Thanks for sharing Penny! :-)

Delicious! A perfect side to almost any meal I think. I tried making it once with cheaper apples and wasn't so keen - better apples make this amazing. Honeycrisp are my current faves. It's great made a day ahead too; flavors marry and apples look just as fresh as day of.
A few adjustments I make for my own tastes: I prefer it less sweet so take down the sugar to about 1/2 tbsp; I like pecans over walnuts.

I made this exactly as stated and really enjoyed it. The idea of the mayonnaise base was a wee bit off putting. At the first bite the overwhelming smell of mayo made me cringe, but after the first bite I was very well pleased. 

Next time I make this I will make a few additions. I will toast the walnuts briefly, add some cuties (tangelos) and  add a dash of salt. I think the addition of some citrus will really perk this up and give it a more complex flavor. However, this is a great starter recipe and is very good on its own.  Thanks Penny!

This is my go-to for my favorite chicken salad recipe. I just substitute the raisins for dried cranberries, only because I'm not a fan of raisins in cooking. Sometimes I'll also add red diced up grapes. I serve this with shredded chicken added on endive leaves. Delicious!!

Very good as is. Even better with a mixture of tart and sweet apples, cranberries, shredded coconut, red grapes, and half plain yogurt replacing half the mayo in the dressing.

I made this for the first time and it was delicious.  I tossed the apples in the lemon juice and cut the sugar to 1 tsp.  Used red grapes instead of raisins.  Next time I will cut the apples last to prevent browning.

Yum! I added some red grapes and I used sunflower seeds instead of nuts (due to allergies). I diced the celery into tiny pieces and just used one stalk. I will definitely make again. It was  fun change to have a fruit side at dinner in lieu of veggies. I served with stuffed peppers.

I reduced the calories and fat by substituting a 6 oz. container of lite vanilla yogurt  for the mayonaise and sugar.  I also added dried cranberries and cuties (mandarin oranges).  Yummy!

It was good but not great.  I used low fat mayo and not as much as said in recipe.  I used cranberries instead of raisins because of personal preference. I like the celery crunch to it.

YUMMERS!  I just made it for dinner tonight instead of veggies....I did NOT have the lemon juice but oddly don't even miss it.  Followed the recipe and added golden raisins and I fell short on my mayo so it's not a "saucy" as I think I would have preferred but even with all that?  5 STARS BABY!  Thanks...this super simple recipe is going in my recipe box.

This was so good! I did toast the walnuts, that really added something. About 10 minutes in a 350 oven. I also added grapes and substituted honey for sugar. VERY YUMMY.

This is just what I have ben craving.  I stopped making my regular recipe because it has frozen whipped topping (?!) in it, so I am glad I found this one.  I just made it for tonight's dinner and I can't stop sampling!  I used 1/2 Miracle Whip Light and 1/2 light mayo, and cashews instead of walnuts.  Yummy!  I'll be making this a lot this fall!

I recently made this salad for a baby shower .  It was very good--I used Honeycrisp and Granny Smith apples and they gave a sweet and tangy crunch.  It was quite tasty as it was but to wake it up a bit, I added about 1 to 2 tbs of Asian sweet chili sauce. Odd, I know, but it was excellent.

Keep the peels on the apples - its faster and also adds a red color. I made it with 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup craisins. Took me 12 minutes from counter to fridge...... and it tasted great. It's a keeper for us!

I really loved this and so did everyone at the picnic. I subbed a cup of grapes for the raisins and used only 1/3 cup of mayonnaise and thought it was fantastic.

Great recipe. I found it was very easy to modify. I used pecans,bananas(really good) and some small marshmellows. It was very much like my grandmothers old southern recipe. I left out the raisens and celery too.

Very delicious!  I did opt to use 1/4 cup real mayo and 1/4 cup plain yogurt.  So many compliments at a ladies luncheon!

Wow, this is so delicious as is.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It's time consuming but worth it.  Next time I'll use an apple/corer/peeler/slicer so it goes a bit faster.

This reminded me of the Waldorf Salad my grandmother made.  It was delicious.  I added a little extra sugar becuase my apples were really tart and a little extra mayo to make it more creamy.  It was a big hit with my family even the kids liked it.

I made this for a party a friend was having, and it was a hit! It is such an easy salad to make and is one most people love. I will definitely make this again, especially in the summertime!

Used ff mayo.  I think low fat would have better.  Substituted Splenda for the sugar and pecans for the walnuts.  Left the peel on two different colored apples.  Would have been better with mini marshmallows.  Left out the raisins.
