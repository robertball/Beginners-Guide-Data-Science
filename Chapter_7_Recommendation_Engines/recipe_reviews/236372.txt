I tried this recipe and it was great.  I fixed the tomato water problem.  I had a hand colander and gently slide it into the colander.  Once the water dripped through slide it back on the skillet.  Reduced the water issue by a great deal.

Made it just like the recipe! Excellent. I will probably cut the tomatoes in half next time, but loved it,

Just tried it.  Didn't have the fresh basil or Feta cheese but had some blended cheese and the tomatoes.  Came out tasting great and the time to cook helped me not overcook them.

I tried this recipe two days in a row. The first day I forgot to add the feta, tomatoes, and basil until after the eggs were cooked. Still turned out delicious! The second day I only had canned tomatoes, which turned the eggs a shade of red...still delicious. This will continue to be a staple to change up the breakfast food routine. Thank you!!!

so simple and delicious! I substituted pecorino romano cheese because I don't like feta. Definitely needed to add more than I did, but that was my choice. Also used roma tomatoes because that's what I had. A new staple breakfast food! Three eggs is a LOT for one person, so next time I'll use two.

Personally prefer the sheep's milk feta from Bulgaria.  Get it at an ethnic store.  If they don't have the Bulgarian then Feta from Komotini, Greece or Dodonis, Greece is just as good.  Maybe even better.  I've been doing this a long time but have used Oregano instead of Sweet Basile.  Yes I said Oregano.  Fresh is much
better.  But most folks prefer Sweet Basile.  
If I don't have fresh tomatoes I use canned.  Still has lots of flavor.  Black Pepper is a good alternative to red pepper flakes if you don't care for the heat.

I have been making this for years, I use whatever cheese I have in the frig, but feta makes it special.  It is also really good w/fresh oregano.  Cherry tomatoes are excellent, but any chopped tomato works as long as it is fresh.

This was super yummy! I didn't have any feta, so used a little Parmesan instead and dried basil instead of fresh. It was so good I can't wait to make it again with the right ingredients...it will only get better!

My goodness this was good.  Hubby loves tomatoes and feta cheese so I knew this would be a hit, however I am not a huge feta fan and I loved it too. How can you go wrong with summer tomatoes and fresh basil.
Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

This is a perfect Spring or summer breakfast dish. I used fresh goat cheese and super fresh eggs purchased at the farmers market. I wouldn't change  anything in this recipe.

This recipe is The Bomb!!  I added a little more feta cheese than this called for in order to tighten up the eggs.  The flavors were outstanding!  Pinning this recipe!

Thanks Chef John.  I followed the directions exactly as written, yes... stirred not folded, for the very best scrambled eggs I ever put in my mouth! The basil, red pepper flakes and Feta put it over the top. Don't change a thing.

I haven't tried this exact recipe yet, but learned to make something similar from my Greek sister-in-law, a fabulous cook!! She actually cooked the cut tomatoes a bit first, to get most of the liquid out, and it seemed to actually intensify the flavor of the tomatoes. She also used Greek oregano. I like to add Cavender's Greek seasoning when I make them. Very simple and tasty!

Breakfast was kind of a bust today for hubby.  He couldn't eat the eggs at all.  I liked this well enough to eat but not something I would repeat.  The cherry tomato/egg/basil mixture didn't really do it for us.  I used lightly dried basil instead of fresh as written so maybe that's on me. 

On a positive note, it was fast and really easy.

I did not have cherry tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and feta cheese on hand, thus i used normal tomatoes, black pepper and mozzarella cheese respectively. I didn't want to use oil, so i substituted it with a little salted butter, thus I forgo the salt since the dish is already salty. I unfortunately did not have basil leaves on hand tho. Overall, it was still really good and tender! Really loved the dish so much that i made it a second time the next day for my family. I solved the water problem by cutting away the juicy, liquid part inside the normal tomatoes, which left little to no water in the dish.

WOW!  This is terrific.  I made using cherry tomatoes and basil out of my garden and my husband's freshly made goat cheese.  Ate with rosemary olive oil bread, toasted.  What a marvelous start to the day.

Feels like a treat from regular scrambled eggs- very flavorful and filling! And the quickness of it makes it a convenient breakfast.

This recipe is very good. It is a nice change from the usual scrambled egg. I unfortunately did not have some of the fresh ingredients so I used dried basil, freshly ground pepper, and butter (1/2 tbsp). It was very good! Will make it again to continue mastering it! Keeper!

This was a wonderfully simple and delicious take on scrambled eggs!! Takes no time at all and if you stick to the basic recipe you wont be disappointed!! I added a touch more seasoning and used a herb/garlic feta as opposed to the plain version...the tomatoes added a juiciness to the eggs and was not watery at all. Will definitely make this again!!

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe, but kept the tomatoes amount the same, just a personal preference. Do take a moment and watch the video..it's very helpful. Thank you for Sharing.

I made this and it was  very good but I probably put in too much fresh basil and it was a little overpowering for me but I would try it again and it made the kitchen smell awesome!

This was very good. I'm part greek, so loved the feta. I had no problem with it being watery, because I used cherry tomatoes. Next time I will use some oregano and lemon pepper to see what happens!  If you like feta cheese, you will like this. Could use it as lunch in a wrap also, add some lettuce and calamata olives.

(1) What a fabulous dish! This is simple, quick and delicious. With a nice glass of rose and a couple slices of toast, it made a delightful dinner.  In fact, since I have three eggs left, I might just have it again tomorrow evening. I love eggs for dinner. (Truth in advertising: I used goat cheese, because that's what I had. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.) P.S. I had no water problem at all. There was just enough tomato juice on the plate to flavor the toast. (2) I have since made this with feta. I prefer the goat cheese, which has a richer taste.

I only had grape tomatoes, dill, and cheddar so I used that. It was still very good and easy. I love Chef John. He's my favorite!

I loved this recipe!  I sautéed some chopped canadian bacon and onion along with the halved tomatoes before I added the eggs.  The flavor was great, and it solved the problem of the water from the tomatoes.  I had some crumbly English cheddar in my frig, and that worked fine.  With cherry tomatoes and basil in my garden, I'll be making this a lot this summer!

I actually didn't have any tomatoes at the time so substituted lebanon bologna.  It was fabulous, but kind of heavy.  I felt like it would sustain me for the day!  I really want to do it next time with tomatoes.  The feta is the unique addition,  and gave the eggs a nice flavor which I think would also tame down the tomatoes.

I saw this recipe yesterday afternoon and made it this morning since I happened to have all the ingredients on hand; it is superb! Chef John's come through for us again (I always trust his recipes!). I used grape tomatoes since they were in the fridge and they were perfect for the dish.   I will definitely make it again since it was enjoyed by all.  It is truly scrumptious!!

Follow chef John's instructions - do not overcook or feta melts & dish is dry. I like feta a bit on the chunky side so it doesn't over cook.  Great way to use the bounty of summer cherry tomatoes & basil. Find one recipe is enough for two people when served with toast. When needing more than one recipe, have the ingredients all mixed & ready to go so there is little delay in cooking up the additional serving(s).

I enjoyed this! It had the flavor of a breakfast Caprese salad! The feta worked very well here. I just cooked it a little longer than the times specified.

Simple and delicious! This was very easy to throw together and perfect for a quick and easy breakfast. The flavors blended together very nicely - I wouldn't change a thing! This was great with a side of whole grain toast and fresh fruit. YUM!

I have made this 4 times. Once for breakfast the rest for dinner. My guy and I absolutely love it. I can't wait to have family and friends over to make for them. I followed the directions as stated but might have gone a little heavier on the cheese sand basil. Mouth watering good!

This was excellent. I cooked the tomatoes and basil for a few minutes first and then added the eggs and cheese. There wasn't too much liquid. Just delicious.

Simple and tasty. I did not have any trouble with the wateriness described by other reviewers. I would change up the basil for tarragon in the future for a better punch of flavor combos.

I have been making this for a long time but never used the feta cheese before so now I'm going to try it. I also add chopped green onion and a little bit of white pepper.

OMG this was so good. I made for a nice light supper for my boyfriend and we both loved it. So tasty and the fresh basil is a nice addition. Thanks again Chef John for another great recipe.
