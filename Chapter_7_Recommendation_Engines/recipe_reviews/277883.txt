I didnâ€™t have almond extract on hand but it turned out great. I baked it in a 9x13, for 25 minutes. I probably would bring it back to 22 minutes.

I think next time I will leave out the almond extract. Personal preference and to make it a true vanilla cake. Took 40 minutes to bake. It was a dense and flavorful cake. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this homemade Vanilla cake. It is delicious. I did not have cornstarch so I replaced it with cornmeal. I also did not have almond extract and instead, I used organic coconut oil.  It still came out good. It tastes like a muffin and a cake. I love both. So it is a win, win for me. :)
