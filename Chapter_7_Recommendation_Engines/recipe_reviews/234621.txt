Other half said he liked that it was juicy and I did too, BUT.....the flavor was so boring and the marinade smelled weird. The maple with the soy and mayo was pointless since it really added nothing of interest, taste-wise, and again, the smell of it totally put me off. I used steak sauce on mine and I NEVER use that stuff. Not happenin in my house again.

Am going to try this for supper tonight.  Wondering if the bad reviews came from people using Miracle Whip or spread instead of "real" Mayo. Mixed up the marinade and it smells fine, will see how it is after cooking.  UPDATE: This was the best marinade I have tried yet!  I used skinless boneless breasts and marinated for 4 hours.  Dried off the breasts, drizzled with olive oil and grilled in a cast iron grill pan as it was too windy and cold to do it outside.  Fussy husband says to say NUM!!!  He said 3 times, be sure and save this one, Hon!

This looked like an odd marinade, and it was. Personally, I think you'll get a better marinade if you leave out the mayo and maple syrup, up the garlic by two more cloves (and mince them) and add a TBSP of light brown sugar.

I made this last night for a family get together. It was too dark to bar-b-que, so I baked it.  It was sooooo delicious! I used chicken breasts(S/B)and thighs - put the breasts in first, then when half way done, added the thighs and basted the breasts with some of the marinade - oh so good.  Did not change anything with regard to the recipe listed.  Will make again and again - and bar-b-que (or bake) next time.

I thought this was actually quite good. I am a fan of Chef John and while this is different from any marinade I have made, my family really enjoyed it and I know I will make it again. Sometimes you just have to move away from tried and true and give a new recipe a try. This one is different, but it did not disappoint!

I decided to try this recipe, mainly because I had all the ingredients on hand.  We LOVED it.  I followed the recipe as written, and used the quick marinade method (on the countertop in a ziploc bag for an hour).  Served with fresh green beans and roasted butternut squash.  Delish!

Thought this was very good. Not sure what people are talking about when they say the marinade smells bad.....smelled great to me and tasted great! I used yogurt instead of mayo because I don't have mayo but that's the only change I made.

Easy to make. We thought it had good flavor. If you are expecting a normal barbecue flavor, of course this isn't for you.  A sweet, tangy flavor.  A welcome change for chicken. I broiled it.

Wow! This was the best grilled chicken I've ever made. It turned out so moist and juicy and the color was awesome. I didn't have the chile pepper sauce so I substituted some smoky chipotle hot sauce and as a compliment I added about a teaspoon of smoked paprika to the marinade. I also didn't have the maple syrup so I used honey. I always seem to dry my chicken out on the grill so I used my bone-in chicken thighs and kept the skin on. I grilled over indirect heat and it took longer than the time specified in the recipe - took 45 minutes but my thighs were large. The final result was worth it! So yummy that this will be a regular in our house.

I'm a big fan of Chef John, so I try a lot of his recipes. This one does not disappoint. I made it exactly as he suggested, except, (since I don't like dirty dishes), I used a gallon size zip lock bag to marinate the chicken in, instead of a flat baking dish. The chicken was moist and had a balanced flavor ... not overpowered by any of the contrasting ingredients. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks, Chef!

I consider myself a great cook, because I enjoy doing it and I get a lot of compliments. But with this recipe, you would have thought I was Emeril!! They loved it! And I didn't have enough time to marinate it and I baked it instead and it was perfect. If it was that good, I will marinate longer. Plus, I used sriracha for my Asian pepper sauce.

Made this in a 400 degree oven for hubby for Valentine's Day and he loved it. Moist and incredibly flavorful. The only change I made was I used my homemade Thai chili paste (chilis, garlic, vinegar, salt, sugar) instead of the garlic and Asain chili sauce. He can't wait to try it on the grill once the snow melts!

I used some green curry paste instead of the chili sauce, and I didn't have a lime. Instead of doing the thighs on the grill, I baked them at 350 F for about 50 min., until the internal temperature was 165 F. I like all the ingredients, but thought the mayo was a bit odd. The overall taste was good, though I'll probably look for a different recipe the next time I do thighs.

Chef John is a favorite of mine.  I am from a generation where we were encouraged to try all foods. I am glad I did try this recipe.  I recently had made an appetizer with mayo and maple syrup in it so I  wasn't too put off by some of the reviewers, as it was delicious.  I agreed with the guy who said this may be a different chicken marinde than you are used to, but worth the try. Full of flavor, I thought.

The first time I made it, yum! I pretty much followed the recipe (as much as I can ;) always more garlic and sweet to spicy balancing to my taste. I'm making it again tonight! But I've added fresh ginger more chilies, shallots extra garlic of course....so can't wait to try!  And this time I remembered the lime! I'm hoping for 5 stars! Thank-you Chef John, I trust your recipes and love your easy style :)

Love this recipe! So easy and it's delicious without the hours of marinating.  I'll toss this into my chicken and let it sit for 30 minutes then throw it on the BBQ, comes out great every time! A highly forgiving recipe that's great on all types of chicken!

Simple recipe with lots of flavor. This is now a staple in my kitchen. I followed the recipe with the exception of the cooking method. Rather than grilling the chicken I browned both sides in a cast iron skillet then finished cooking the chicken in the oven at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes, until done. Delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good made exactly how it instructs. I bought the sweet chili sauce sold in the Asian section that looks like a sweet and sour sauce because I was afraid the hot one would be too hot for me and this is spicy but mild. Not sure if this was the sauce he meant, but it was really good.

I was optimistic about the marinade because it smelled good. I wasn't able to marinade the the chicken due to time constraints. I wasn't impressed with the overall taste of the dish when complete. Perhaps it was due to my pure maple syrup has a cinnamon stick resting in it.

Very tasty. I want to play with the ingredients a bit, however I can see this being on the table several times a year. I did reduce the hot Thai sauce considerably in deference to our spice sensitivities and think a single tsp will be about right.

I and my family enjoyed this—it smelled and tasted delicious. I don’t usually write reviews unless I precisely followed the recipe, so my apologies to Chef John (a favorite!) and the rest of you, but I felt I had to share. I did follow precisely except I used 3 cloves of garlic because we love garlic so much that I usually triple the amount called for in a recipe. After marinade was finished, though, I just wanted a little more heat and a little more sweet, so I added 1 Tbls orange marmalade and 1/2 tsp Siracha and voila! Hubby took leftovers to work and his co-workers moaned about him bringing such a delicious smelling lunch. Thanks again, Chef John!! A keeper!

Everyone loved them.

This was a nice change of pace. I too subbed honey for the maple syrup. Used leg quarters and slashed each several times to the bone before the marination. Grilled up nicely  by searing skin side down for several minutes, then indirect method for about 45 minutes with charcoal kettle.

What a great quick recipe! This is a complex sauce that I would have thought would be served in a restaurant only.  But I was wrong, you can make it at home!!  I love making new sauces especially since I tend to cook the same things out of convenience.  I have to switch to a high protein diet due to health reasons, so I just bought some chicken thighs.  I already had all of the ingredients at home so it was great to create a new flavor with what I already had.  I just baked then broiled the thighs-no time to marinade so I had to throw this together and cook right away-and it turned out perfectly yummy! This is literally an awesome sauce!

Absolutely delicious! I made exactly as directed except I used skinless boneless chicken breast.  It worked out perfectly...the meat was tasty, tender and moist.  I loved adding the lime on top right before serving.  It brightens up the taste.  Thanks Chef John!

Very good recipe, thoroughly enjoyed it.  Next time, I'll bump up the Asian chili sauce a little, as we could have used a bit more heat, but they grilled up beautifully with great flavor.  Maybe our chicken thighs were not as large as others, but they were ready to come off the grill in about 7 minutes, and were juicy and tender.  Definitely will be making these again.

This was easy to prepare, common household ingredients for us except for the lime, which I did pick up, and the flavor was way beyond our expectations!  I did make one sub in the marinade since I didn't have any sambal, I used sweet chili Thai sauce instead and added a few dashed of hot sauce to replace the heat.  used skin on/bone in chicken (2 breasts, 5 thighs so I prepared a double recipe of the marinade) and it came off the grill looking like a picture and so fragrant! The garlic, soy and chili lend such awesome flavor but they can be over powering on their own. The maple syrup & mayo round out these flavors nicely and the rice wine vinegar I think just brings everything together. I do agree with some that the marinade smelled a bit weird but the chicken was divine!

The flavor of this chicken is amazing.  I doubled the marinade because that is something I would do.  I'm not sure that I needed to but it was so perfect the way I made it that I will probably always do it.  It isn't spicy and it isn't sweet.  It doesn't taste like soy sauce or mayo.  it is just a unique flavor of everything combined.  We loved it.

This is a great recipe.  The flavors are fantastic.  I like heat, so I use a little extra sambal oelek.  I've made this dish at least 7 times since I first tried it a couple of months ago.  Delicious!

I was anxious to try this even though I don't have a mortar and pestle.  I also did not have the chili pepper sauce.  So I had to improvise and it turned out really good.  I chopped the garlic, added red pepper flakes, and put it with the other marinade ingredients into my magic bullet.  The sauce came out smooth.  I marinaded it all day and we really enjoyed it.  I will make it again!

These were very tasty. The package I cooked weighed about 3 pounds, so I used 1.5 times each marinade ingredient. Instead of cooking the marinated thighs on the grill, I browned them on both sides in a cast iron skillet in two batches. Then I put all the browned thighs into the cast iron skillet and baked them in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 40-45 minutes.

My husband and I loved this chicken. The first time I made it the mayo separated into small lumps from the vinegar. I thought oh no this won’t be good, but we really liked it! I used my garlic press and put the marinade in a big bowl. I just made it again and mixed the mayo in before adding the rice vinegar and it looks much better. I used A Taste of Thai Sweet Chili Sauce because it was the closest ingredient I could fine to what was called for. The boneless chicken thighs on the grill were delicious!

I couldn’t get over how red it became. At first blush, while marinating, it didn’t look very red or appetizing. As the glaze set it became deeply red. It smelled and tasted great. Didn’t have a lime so employee lemon wedges which were equally (I think) a great addition to the dish.

I love this recipe - it's become a go-to favorite of mine!  Super easy and very flavorful.  I usually add a little extra hot chili sauce that I got when I was in China - it really spices it up!

Love, love, love! I have tried this recipe a few time, each with a different cut of chicken. Stay away from the  bone in breast cooked in the oven, but thighs or boneless breast (not as greasy) on the grill will win every time. I also like to take some of the marinade and caramelize it on the stove for an extra sticky sauce to brush over the cooked chicken.

I made this twice. Once with boneless thighs and then with chicken breast. I personally liked the breast much more when I usually prefer dark meat.  I made sure to marinate for 4 hours and it does makes a difference. 
 
Then!...this totally made for the best chicken quesadillas the following night for a left over dinner. Two for one! Used the food processor to shred the chicken. Love when things are easy. Thanks Chef John!!

Solid marinade, have used it several times now.  Substituted honey for maple syrup.  So far I've always pan fried the chicken and I pour in the rest of the marinade at the end to let it caramelize - makes a great sauce/coating.

This has been in my saved recipes for a while but I kept putting it off because some of the negative reviews were adamant about it being “weird”. I made the marinade exactly as directed and took a good sniff and I thought it smelled really good! I will probably double the chili sauce next time tho.  I let the thighs marinate for 4 hours before putting them on the hot grill. I did 5 minutes on each side then kept flip-flopping them for another 5 minutes on each side. They looked exactly like Chef John’s. Hubby said he loved them and to make sure to put this in our regular rotation.

I omitted the chilli , used 2 cloves of garlic and oven baked the chicken on 250 degrees Celsius for 15 mins , basting with marinade every 5 mins. I then used the grill (broil) for a few mins to add some colour. Delicious ! Well all loved it and will make it again

I baked this instead of charcoal grilling and I think it would taste better on the charcoal grill and that's how I'll be making it next time. It is a really delicious maranade. You might wonder if it's hot because of the sambal olek but it is not. Just tasty.

Very good recipe and will make again. Girlfriend and family really enjoyed the chicken. I replaced the maple syrup (as I didn't have any) with regular white sugar and it turned out great. I made extra sauce to pour over chicken and rice for final plating.

Yum! I did not have Asian chili sauce on hand so subbed buffalo sauce. Also included a chicken breast, both the breast and the thighs were moist and delicious. Will make again.

I upped the amount of garlic by 1/2 and used sriracha for the Asian chili sauce.  Marinated the the chicken thighs for right around three hours and then grilled for 10 minutes or so.

The family were big fans of the result.  I liked it but the flavor is somewhat mild.

Omitted maple syrup and substituted shrimp for the chicken for the first cook.  Unbelievable!
Second time, cut chicken thighs into strips and threaded on skewers and grilled on high for a nice char. Also fantastic!

These chicken thighs are perfect.  Not too spicy which was nice. If you want more heat just add more sambal oelek.  We absolutely just loved them.  Followed the recipe ingredients exactly except added 1 more clove of garlic.  Did not use the mortal and pestal.... not necessary.  Just minced my garlic then added the the rest of the ingredients to a small bowl to mix.  These will be made often! Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!!!

The only changes I made were the following:
1. I used yogurt instead of mayonnaise (forgive me!) and
2. I used a Moroccan Harissa sauce I had on hand rather than the Asian chile pepper sauce specified. 
In any case it was a big hit with my customer (wife), so I give it five stars!

I was a bit disappointed....recipe sounded great on paper, but flavor was not as bokkd as i would have liked. As others have said, not sure of the purpose of mayo.
I will try again, but next time i will increase the oleg sambal to 3 tablespoons, more garlic and leave out the mayo.

Since my name is Rusty, I had to make this recipe. First off, I used bone in, skin on chicken thighs.
The turned out so delicious, I can't even explain. The flavor and juicyness of these thighs were amazing. I wlill be making this recipe a lot this summer!!!

They were super easy to make. I marinated them overnight & they came out perfect exactly following the instructions. I doubled the quantity of chicken & doubled the marinade.
A perfect BBQ dish!

I omitted the mayo as we don't like hot mayo and did not add salt. Besides the saltiness of the soya sauce and the heat from the Sambal you couldn't taste anything else. Just expected more, something might be missing?

salt is not the only seasoning, add some all purpose seasoning, some oregano, parsley, chicken seasoning, bbq sauce, garlic powder. A really nice tip is to MARINATE. let the chcien sit. don't just rush. make sure there is some gravy in the pot so you can put it on the dry white rice :) ! hope this helps. :)

Very good.   Spice taste comes through but is not overwhelming.  Good do ahead dinner that only needs to be grilled in the end.

I didn’t have any mustard powder but the recipe was still a smash with my family. I’m definitely going to remake this one (with the mustard powder of course).

YES  a strange combo of  ingredients but so good! Marinated chicken  thighs for 24 hours (didn't mean to just happened that way).Grilled them on medium direct heat. Excellent! Used what was left for chicken salad the next day. Great flavor and soft and tender.

we really enjoyed this.  no complaints from anyone at the table. the only thing i might do if make it again is to cut back  **slightly** on the soy sauce.  i would have like just a little less soy flavor.  i will make again.  thanks chef john!

I made the recipe exactly as described. Very good! I made the marinade early and it sat in the refrigerator while my chicken thawed. Then I marinated for about two hours and grilled on the BBQ. Will definitely make again!

I used whole thighs (with skin & bones) in the oven rather than on the grill (since it was pouring rain) on a broiler pan. They came out "rusty" and delicious after marinating for about 30 minutes on the counter. I followed an earlier recommendation of adding another clove of garlic. I also used a blend of regular and dark soy sauce because I thought it would make it more "rusty," but I probably didn't need to do that.  I'll try to marinate it overnight next time. We loved the subtle blend of flavors. Hint: add the mayo to the crushed garlic, then add the chili paste. Mix well before slowly adding the thinner liquids.. (Mayo doesn't easily emulsify into the thinner liquids without whisking it in.)

I thought the maple syrup was good in the marinate. I didn't understand the mayo either but overall this was a simple marinate and chicken was tasty. I would make this again.

My husband LOVED this chicken, but I didnt think it was that great (I just personally wasn't blown away by the flavour or the marinade). I marinated it for about 5 hours and used minced garlic out of a jar, but it was still nicely balanced. Would make it again for my hubby :)

Did not make any changes and I really liked it.  Made a note of someone's comment that  used plain yogurt instead of mayo as an interesting alternative.  Second recipe in a week that uses mayo (not Miracle Whip).  Try Best Scrambled Eggs with mayo - they are very very good.  I think the mayo provides a base to all the flavors.
I agree with another comment about trying something new even if it sounds weird and not being stuck with the tried and true.

I have made this before just as the recipe instructs and grilled it, and it was great!!! Tonight about 2 minutes before I was going to grill, the skies opened up and the rain came pouring down. So I took the chicken thighs, my handy-dandy kitchen shears, and cut them into strips, threw the bone and a slice of bacon in a skillet and browned/cooked the chicken for about 15 mins. Delicious! Good to know it can be cooked indoors with great results too!

I used Boneless, Skinless Chicken Tenders, 4 + cloves of garlic and marinated over night in the fridge.  They were juicy and delicious on the grill.  I did the mortar and pestle thing but not sure how necessary that was to the recipe's success.  Next time I will just chop or mince the garlic.
Thanks Chef John!

Easy to make.  I used wings and home  made mayonnaise (egg yolks , mustard and oi).  I was making two chick recipes at the same time and got them mixed up.  So I cooked this in the marinade instead of grilling it.,   Still tasted good.

Excellent had it several times. Remembering to marinate is the only thing I forget. Tried the hour setting at room temperature, worked well. Not too spicy just right.

I veered off the recipe as follows with great results...
I used honey instead of maple syrup and a bit of apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar. I also blended all the marinade ingredients in my Nutribullet. 
I baked it in the oven (200 C) until it browned nicely and then covered it with foil to stop it from crisping up too much and possibly drying out. Left it in the oven for another hour  to ensure the chicken cooked through. Everyone loved it - Had a few scavengers in the kitchen that evening finishing off the left overs.

I wanted to try this because I was intrigued by the list of ingredients.  I used Sriracha hot chili sauce and apple cider vinegar in mine.  Loved the "smoky" flavor the maple syrup gave this.  It was a very good sauce that I will use again.

I made this and used sriracha for my chili pepper paste.  I didn't have limes so skipped the limes.  Served with a salad and garlic mashed potatoes. It was wonderful!  Definitely on the meal planning menu especially if we have our larger extended family over.

I made this last night for us - only I doubled the recipe for the amount of thighs I had. I am impressed! It was moist, flavorful and wonderful! I can't wait to take this camping with us (just keep it in a zip lock food bag). I noticed no funny smells, had the ingredients on hand, took a mere few minutes to whip up the marinade (chopped garlic helps), and clean up was easy. This IS my new go to marinade for sure. Normally I think chicken things are ugh- but this made me fall in love with them again. And the color- loved it! It is important to add salt and pepper on one side of the chicken as it cooks- also lay the smooth side down first on the grill or in my case indoor grill. You know it's done when it looks rusty. We allowed the chicken to set a few minutes like John says and boy was it good! Thanks John- it's something I never would have thought of myself as a marinade- but it is great!

This was a great marinade.  I left them overnight and used boneless, skinless thighs.  The mayo wasn't something I have ever put in a marinade but it helped to keep the chicken moist and kept it from sticking to the grill.  Delicious!!  The whole family loved it- even our five and eight year old boys!

This marinade has a very tasty flavor. I used everything listed above and at first I didn't think it would be enough. I was wrong. The marinade covered all my chicken. I didn't allow it to set for too long, so next time I will. It was still an enjoyable dinner. I will def make again and again. My big mistake was, I poured all the marinade over my chicken to cook so it didn't get crispy. I will re rate after the next time I make it  to see if it looks similar to the pic shown.

I make this on the grill in a shallow pan. Crisp the outside on the grill alone  first, turn heat to low, add to shallow pan with marinade crispy skin up, let the marinade cook to a boil. Chicken is wonderfully tender with a bit of crispness from the original grilling, great tangy kick with the sauce it cooks in.

Chef John says chicken thighs don't dry out. He's wrong about that.  At least when I'm cooking, thighs can dry out on the grill just as easily as breasts do. The mayo marinade curdled when I mixed it up. I don't know why. I used it anyway.  Hubby said he really like these but I was pretty ambivalent about the taste.  It was okay. It wasn't awesome and I won't be repeating.

If I could I would give it a 4.5 because it was just in between 4 and 5 stars. It wasn't the best chicken I've ever had but it wasn't bad either. I substituted the 2 teaspoons of Asian chile pepper sauce for 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I don't think it was enough because I like really spicy stuff but I think that overall it was enough to taste and know it was cayenne pepper. I noticed that when I was mixing up the marinade the mayo was very hard to mix in so I ended up using an egg beater. Honestly I didn't think the marinade would cover all the chicken ( I end up doubling the recipe by 1 1/2 because we had more chicken than the recipe called for) but actually it covered it perfectly! I'm not sure if I would make this recipe again but it definitely wasn't bad.

Interesting combination of marinate ingredients that turned out pretty tasty! I baked this at 425 till the skin was crispy. I also used boned-in thighs with skin.

So many comments on the marinade smelling weird! Truth is I substituted pomegranate molasses for maple syrup- and it was even better! Simple, delicious. Love you chef John.

I followed the recipe and it turned out great. If I had thought about it, I might have used honey instead of the maple syrup, only because I think it's better for you. I will make it again, we all loved it.

I had some 7 Stars Farm yogurt sweetened with maple syrup so I used that in place of the mayonnaise. I then just added another splash of maple syrup. It is a delicious marinade and I plan to make it often. Thanks much!

SUPERB!  I don't know what anyone would be complaining about, because this recipe was PERFECTION!  We grilled a huge amount of chicken thighs and legs so we could have left overs for a couple of days for the family.....except nothing was left for left-overs. The family DEVOURED this.  

I made the recipe exactly as written except I doubled it.  

Thanks chef John!

I used Korean chile paste and added additional chile flakes with bone-in chicken thighs & legs.  We cooked it on the grill and made some bbq sauce from the remaining marinade.  We added onions, red wine, tomato paste, brown sugar -- brought to boil and added a little flour to thicken.

Super great chicken! Easy and quick (marinated 1/2 hour in kitchen).  The marinade is The Bomb!!I made per Chef John's instruction and other than using organic Apple Cider Vinegar from a secret orchard in England (I have deep connections) for rice vinegar, everything was same. Chicken was fork tender and so tasty! Picky eater husband loved it and this will be on high rotation in my house. Thank you Chef John.

Everyone loved this - I used it to grill cornish hen and also for drumsticks (puncturing meat with a fork for marinade flavors to sink in). Next time I would start marinade with the mayonnaise and mix other ingredients into it for a more even mixture. Use it for any cut of chicken.

I couldn't rate this great recipe a 5 because I didn't grill it. I roasted the chicken, instead. At 425 F. At the convection roasting setting oven for 22-27 min.  I had 4.72 lbs of boneless skinless thighs. Changes in ingredients: Didn't  have: a. Asian chile pepper sauce-sabstituted it with some old chili powder-1 teasp., didn't have Maple syrop-used 2 Tab. good corn syrop (without high Fructose  syrop in it).  Right before putting in oven, I drizzled chicken with lime juice from lime and sprinkled with some chicken spice and salt with pepper. Next time, will use more salt-about 1 teasp. for 4.72 lbs chicken.   The result was awesome-truly "TO DIE FOR" -beautifully browned, juicy and tender.   Will make it again. Easy to make. No mess in cleaning and no unhealthy frying.

As usual with Chef John's recipes, delicious as written! I was skeptical of the Mayo (real Mayo, not miracle whip--they still sell that stuff? ;)), but the marinade tasted great! I only had bone in thighs, so I deboned and removed the skin/fat.  Marinated for roughly 3 hr and grilled. End result was a moist/tender chicken. Average flavor without the lime, but with lime absolutely delicious!

We found this to be REALLY tasty! I used Siracha sauce, 3 tsp, & will increase to 4 next time. Wasn't sure if this would be too sweet for my husband who does NOT like sweets but it turned out just right! I plan to marinate overnight next time. Will definitely make again!

I changed it just a bit, because we didn't have the sauce, but I think I made it better.  I say this because my son doesn't eat chicken, ever. We struggle getting protein into him. This,  he devoured. Instead of the sauce I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I used my griddle for 10 minutes on the smooth side of the thighs, then 5 minutes on the opposite side. I transferred them to a Pyrex dish and into the oven for 35 minutes on 375°. Super juicy, very good flavor! I will be making this again, and again,  and again.

Great job Chef John I loved this recipe! It was moist and tasted great! I used siracha because I did not have chili sauce but that made it really good, it added a little spice to it too.

This recipe is AWESOME! I made it exactly to the recipe.  Husband and visiting family loved it.  I did double the marinade because we like things saucy.  Very tasty......served with oven roasted garlic parmesan red skins.

I tried this recipe last night and it was DELICIOUS.  The tip in the video regarding putting the chicken "smooth side" down on the gill first really helped with cooking the chicken thighs which can be kind of messy.  Cooking smooth side down first allows the chicken to become firm on that side before flipping over.  
LOVED this and will make it again.

I just tried this tonight. It was nice & moist, but the marinade was just ok. I have other recipes that I've been using for years that I'll continue to use instead of this one.

The chicken was tender, but the sauce was lacking something. I just couldn't put my finger on it though.

Followed recipe exactly, except for the garlic and lime (didn't have any).  Marinated for 4 hours and grilled.  Wonderful!  Made it again, this time marinated for 5 hours.  So delicious!  It has a mild tang/spice flavor, but no where near "spicey".  It's so tender and juicy.  5 stars for sure!

I use this recipe all the time.   I usually put the marinade in a zip lock bag with the chicken, then throw it in the freezer.  That way the meat thaws and marinates at the same time!  Thanks Chef John, I love your food and your style!

I'm not a thigh lover, but my son is. Rave reviews and came back the next day to reheat the leftovers. (From a kid that doesn't like leftovers)

I had a really bad storm come in so I couldn't grill these. But I absolutely loved the recipe. I used bone in thighs, and pan sauted to  brown the thighs. I am making again tonight and doubled the sauce so I can add as I grill. Can't wait.

Chef John, although I made some slight modifications, your recipe was a hit!!  I was doing roughly 15 pounds of skinned and deboned thighs.  Followed your marinade recipe exactly but more obviously!  Can't BBQ where I live so I cooked the thighs in the oven on a raised silicone mat, 30 minutes at 180 C.  They came out GREAT! The next day I made up more of the marinade (minus the mayo this time), thickened it with corn starch and poured it over the chicken (just enough to coat the chicken not drown it) and put it all in crockpots on the "keep warm" setting. :) Drizzled it with lime juice just before serving! It was a huge hit with everyone.  No leftovers to everyone's disappointment!  Thanks, Chef John!!

My husband and I love this marinade.  I would choose a spicy chili sauce or just add red pepper for some zing but otherwise this is THE marinade we use for grilling thighs.  Leftover chicken is great for tacos!

I really liked this recipe. I was in a hurry so I used minced garlic. I also had to replace the vinegar for standard white vinegar as I did not have rice vinegar at hand. In addition I had to cut off the chili sauce because I can not eat spicy foods. Despite I had to cut off several ingredients this recipe turned out very well. My husband enjoyed it a lot. He even ask me to keep leftovers for later! 

I also used a cast iron pan, but put it on the stove top. It came out just good I do not see any reason not to keep this recipe! I had to cook it a bit longer because I had bone in chicken thighs but still it was good for a quick chicken! I sprinkled brown sugar while cooking them and squeezed half a lemon on top when close to the end. It was good!

Tried this recipe for the first time today and it came out amazing, even though I forgot the salt! The marinade smelled wonderful and added great flavor. Grilled it just like Chef John said and got great grill-marks while keeping it nice and juicy. Garnished with lime wedges for spritzing, which brought out the flavor even more. Served it with seasoned corn and wild rice.
