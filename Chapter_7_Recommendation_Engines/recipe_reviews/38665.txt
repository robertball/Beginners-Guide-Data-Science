I took a chance on this recipe and I don't regret it! The night before Thanksgiving I decided to make it for the FIRST time, my husband's entire family was coming over.  The turkey got rave reviews and everyone wanted to know how I did it.  Thank you so much for the recipe.
I do have to warn people of one thing.  I did not read the recipe thoroughly enough and ended up at two different grocery stores the night before Thanksgiving (not fun) looking for WHITE WINE WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE because I didn't see the "white wine" part beforehand.  I had never heard of it and discovered that it is the Lea & Perrins that is made for chicken (it says "blended with white wine and herbs").  Learn something new every day!  Can't wait to use it on some chicken soon!
Oh, the only change I made to the recipe was to use half oil, half melted butter.

I used this rub last year on a 12 lb turkey and it was so moist and wounderful!  The turkey looked like it could've been on a food magazine cover.  Easy too.

I took two big risks this Thanksgiving: I tried this rub for the first time and I smoked my turkey for the first time.  The scary part was that I had 14 friends to serve with this untested rub and smoker. 

One week later, I'm still getting incredible feedback on how this was the best turkey many had ever had!!!  Thanks.

This made my turkey the softest/juciest turkey I've ever eaten. 

Only comments would be... Use gloves (my hands smelt like this rub for like a week, not that its a bad thing or anything). and make sure to use a smaller blender/food processor. I tried putting it in a normal blender and there wasn't enough mix to get up over the blades. 

But the recipe itself came out AWESOME! Everyone loved it.

fabulous. I didnt have white wine worcestshire, so i used half white wine and have worcest. i also ran out of onion, so i used onion powder. 

In addition, i put 4 tbs of butter under the skin of the turkey breasts and i used my baster to shoot the extra marinade under the skin. 

I also used poultry seasoning, salt and pepper to season the bird in addition to the herb rub. 

It was fabulous. Really juicy and tender. Great rub!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was delicious!!!  It was not only my first time using this recipe, but it was my first time making a big Christmas dinner!!!!!  It got RAVE reviews!!!!  the only thing I did differently was I eyeballed the amount of rosemary, thyme, garlic, and onion.  I made it about an hour before I put it on the turkey as well.  I think it made the flavors mix well!  And I also read it wrong.  I put in 1/4C white wine, and about a tablespoon of worceteshire (sp??).  It still turned out fantastic!!!  Juicy, and flavorful.  Sadly I didn't make a gravy out of the drippings, but I will next year!!  DEFINATELY going to be used again and again!!!!!!!

I put this on our Thanksgiving turkey and I really enjoyed the touch of flavor it gave to our turkey and it added a little something extra to our gravy flavor as well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I liked it. It had good aroma, but didn't do much for the flavor of the chicken I cooked. I would suggest doubling it and using it as a marinade instead. Not bad.

Absolutely excellent! Would work on any poultry, or even pork. Used it as a rub to make my first ever smoked chicken, and it turned out to be lick-your-lips, mahogany-colored perfection. Massaged the rub liberally onto, as well as under, the skin. The flavor was stellar. Very easy to put together. I've had white wine Worcestershire in the fridge forever, using a few dashes in many sauces I make, so that was no big deal to me. White wine could be subbed, or even rum. Any which way you make it, don't miss this! Simple way to jack up the flavor all the way into the stratosphere.

We soaked our turkey in brine for 24 hours and then used this rub 16 hours before cooking and it was WONDERFUL.  Because we did use the brine I'm not sure how it would be standing alone but worked perfectly for what we wanted.  Rave reviews from everyone.  Thank you for sharing

We were very pleased with this recipe.  I made it for a rotisserie chicken.  We rubbed it underneath the skin and on the outside of the skin.  The house smelled great while it was cooking.  The results were very good.

This was a huge hit with my family. I wasn't able to make it as directed because I only had dried rosemary and thyme so I put in 1 Tbl of each; didn't have white wine Worcestershire so used 1/8 cup of regular Worcestershire; AND I didn't have a small food processor so I couldn't blend it so I used 1 tsp regular salt instead of coarse kosher salt. It was still delicious even though I'm sure it would have been better as posted. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. :)

I used this recipe to make a thanksgiving dinner and it was the BEST! I brined the turkey with a recipe for Apple Cider-brined turkey and I have never had a better turkey ever! Many rave reviews. Just know that if you brine your turkey the cooking time is cut so monitor the turkey temp and dont over cook. After brining for 24hr and using this rub for 16hr my 15.5lb turkey cooked in only 2.5hrs. No bag. Follow directions and you will have an awesome turkey!

I mixed this concoction up the night before and let it sit at room temperature overnight.  I used dried spices instead of fresh spices and used half olive oil and half butter.  I rubbed it under the skin of the turkey before roasting and it came out perfect!  After dinner when I was removing the leftover meat from the turkey I didn't even have to use a knife!  It was coming off the bone very easily - almost like a rotisserie bird!  I will use this rub every Thanksgiving from now on.

This definately a great rub.  It has a lot of the same herbs as a 'poultry seasoning' you can buy at the store. We brined the turkey for 24 hours, then rubbed the rub on it and covered it and let it sit in the fridge for another 24 hours before baking.  the turkey was very moist and the taste was wonderful.

WOW! That is all I have to say! This was a hit for our Christmas bird! We had 15 people over, and none of them could stop talking about our turkey! I did not have White Wine Worstershire Sauce so I used 1/8 cup (Riesling) White Wine and 1/8 cup worstershire sauce and it was incredible! I also didnt have fresh ingredients so I used all dried. Came out FABULOUS! I made sure to bast it often and I was told it was "the most moist turkey" they had ever eaten.

I've used this rub for 3 years, and will never use another.  I grow and dry my own rosemary for an added personal touch.  Excellent flavor and results every time.  I make the rub the night before and let sit in the fridge overnight.  This allows the rub to stick to the turkey ensuring perfect, initial coverage, especially on the breasts.  CHEERS!

Fabulous! I started with the Out of this World. Turkey Brine 24 hours.  Then used the rub. I placed under skin and made 4 injections.  I did not have white so I did the regular with a 1 to 4 ration of white wine.  Also I used half the olive oil and replaced with melted butter.  Then I wrapped by bird in bacon.  I butterflied one bird and placed it on the grill with a piece of oak via indirect heat while the other bird roasted in the stove.  Both amazing!!!

This was awesome! My family really love it. I used dried herbs since I did not have fresh and I did increase them to 1 tablespoon like to other review said. I could not find white wine Worcestershire sauce so I use white wine vinegar & low sodium Worcestershire. I came out wonderful.

Loved it.  I did not have white wine Worcestershire sauce in the house so I substituted half white wine and half regular Worcestershire sauce.  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh - about half the recommended amount.  Rather than a blender, I used an electric mixer.  I doubled the recipe for my 21 pound bird.  My guests all raved about the turkey, and I'd definitely use this rub again.

The wonderful smell of this rub coming from the oven made the wait for the Thanksgiving turkey sweet torture.  So worth the wait!  Grocery store was out of fresh thyme, so I substituted dried.  Made the recipe 24 hours ahead to allow the flavors to mingle.  Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.  Fantastic.

Very good. Used this on cornish game hens and made them flavorful & juicy. Definitely an all around good rub for all different types/cuts of meat.

One of the most amazing turkeys I have ever had! Yesterday was my first time cooking a turkey and I brined the bird before letting it marinate overnight. I didn't put salt in the rub because I had brined the bird. And I used white cooking wine instead of the Worcestershire sauce. I also added sage because I wasn't able to find rosemary by itself. So I ended up getting a package of poultry seasonings (fresh) and it had rosemary, thyme, and sage.   Amazing!

All I can say is... OUTSTANDING, OUTSTANDING, OUTSTANDING!!  My turkey, first one in our new home and after one heck of a rotten year, it made for an AWESOME turkey and a truly great Thanksgiving dinner.  I'm honestly not one for white meat but this was so darn moist that's the only part I took!  Wonderful, YUMMY, so tasty and fantastically moist.  Thanks so very much for a keeper of recipe! (On a scale of 1 to 5 this is a 15!!)

This turkey turned out DELICIOUS! My husband has told several people about this recipe and my brother in law asked for the recipe so he can make it for Christmas. The only thing I changed was substituting regular worcestershire sauce for the "white wine" variety, which I couldn't find. We'll definately make it again!!

I was a bit hesitant about making this turkey rub because I normally do my turkey rubs with all Spanish condiments, being Spanish myself. I have to say: I was AMAZINGLY impressed! Although I did not get fresh rosemary & thyme, I substituted with the dried ones instead (of course with proper measurements for the two). It still came out supberb. My husband loved it! And this must be said, I have a very, very picky teenage daughter when it comes to eating; this was the first year she actually tasted turkey & SHE LOVED IT! Now that I know she loved it & my husband & myself loved it as well, I WILL continue using this recipe.  Thank you :-)

I just tried this recipe for the first time and it won't be my last! I had a 13 pound turkey and it was more than enough. I rubbed it under the skin and over the skin and inside the cavity. I was concerned it might overwhelm the taste of the turkey, but it was PERFECT!!
I couldn't find white wine worcestershire sauce so I used one part regular worcestershire sauce and 3 parts white wine.
I cooked the turkey upside down in a roasting bag turning it over the last 30 minutes. It was the moistest turkey breast ever!!! My family loved it!

Followed the recipe exactly but doubled it for a 14 pound bird. It was a hit and we'll definitely make it again for roasted chickens throughout the year! I would recommend putting it into the bird via injection or at last under the skin in order to penetrate the meat. Still good just as a rub but just not as intense as it would be making the extra effort.

Excellent flavor imparted to a turkey cooked in a smoker.  Looking at other reviewers, I used half worstershire and half white wine.  I will use again:)

This is a great rub- I used it on a turkey breast in my rotisserie. I love to save some of the rub and use it to marinade oven roasted potatoes to compliment the meat.

We added some chopped sage to this and it was amazing!  We added it to melted butter for basting, as well.  I'd never enjoyed turkey before, but this Thanksgiving I couldn't get enough.

This recipe had way too much garlic....and I LOVE garlic. I think I have decided that garlic and turkey just don't go together. Could not find white wine worcestershire, so used some Reisling with a small amount of regular worcestershire, few drops of liquid smoke and a dash of tarragon.

This was perfect and super easy.  I have used it to roast turkeys and chickens, and simply rubbing it under the skin and all over the outside and then letting it marinade for a bit will make your turkey come out moist, seasoned and tender with a nice crispy skin.  Delicious!

Since the Worcestershire noted has been discontinued I used a stick of butter and skipped the olive oil as well. I used the marinade under the skin and over it too. I decided to put thick cut hickory smoked bacon on top for the last 30 to 40 minutes and we all agreed it was the best turkey we can remember!

This added a very nice flavor to the 14 pound turkey I cooked on the grill (which adds it's own nice smoked flavor).  I did use dried spices.

If you are going to use the food processor, mincing the onion and garlic is a fairly pointless activity.

I use this every Thanksgiving as step 2 of my 2-step turkey prep.  My first step is to brine the turkey overnight with a turkey brine recipe I found here by Sheri Gailey.  Then I prepare this recipe (double it) without the salt.   Both recipes have similar ingredients (rosemary & thyme), which helps enhance the flavor.

I've used this exact recipe for more than 5 years and will always use THIS rub.  It's easy and my guests ALWAYS rave about my turkey.  I even planted the herbs for this recipe so I always have them.

I've made this Turkey Herb Recipe 4 times and it's the best Turkey I've ever had! I grew up with oven Turkey, BBQ Turkey and even fried Turkey. I was almost ready to give up on Turkey because it always seemed dry and bland to me. I was scared when I first attempted this recipe because I didn't want a dry turkey like I'd had growing up. Not only does it come out juicy (I used a flavor injector) but it has an amazing savory flavor. I use a cooking bag and then capture the juices for the best gravy! I highly recommend this recipe!
