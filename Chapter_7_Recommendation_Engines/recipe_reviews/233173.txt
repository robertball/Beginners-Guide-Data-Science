I must admit, I thought the lone 2 star rating (without a review) was a fluke.  I've made many breakfast casseroles like this before and they've all been delicious.  However, this is missing two key ingredients:  butter and salt.  It took everything in me not to add them when I was prepping this, but decided to follow the recipe since I'd be the first "real" review.  I wish I'd added them...  I made this the night before and chose to forgo sauteing the veggies for a few reasons:  I'm lazy, we like veggies w/a bit of a crisp, and they cook just fine IN the casserole.  Other than that, I followed the recipe, though I did halve it for the two of us (and froze the remainder of the potatoes and cream of chicken soup together for another future half).  I took a small portion, and did not finish it.  It tastes strongly of cream of chicken soup, which is not a pleasant flavor (most of the other recipes I've made call for the soup, too, and I've never noticed it as prominently).  If you add 1/2C butter and 1 tsp of salt, this would be at least 4 stars.  THANKS for the recipe; I'm sorry it wasn't our cup o' tea.

I made it but used whole milk instead of sour cream.  It turned out really good. Crispy on the top.  Leftovers tasted good reheated next day

Made it only once but the family loved it.  Grandkids and adults loved.  Even though the recipe makes a lot, it was gone in one meal.
