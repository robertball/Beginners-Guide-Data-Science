This is the salad I grew up with my Grandma making with fresh tomatoes/cucumbers/onion out of her garden. Any onion is good, I like it best with red onion. Sometimes, she'd throw in some of her fresh dill, too. Keep in mind that the amount of salad dressing and sugar is purely dependant on taste--I'd add the mayonnaise a quarter cup at a time as to not go overboard.

Good way to use beautiful garden-fresh summer tomatoes.  As another reviewer recommended, do approach the salad dressing cautiously, as you can always add more.  I used Splenda and cut the dressing back about 30% which worked fine.  Add the dressing right before you plan to serve because if added too soon, it will be runny/watery.  Just a good old fashioned tomato salad, and there's nothing wrong with that.

The recipe is great, but I used sour cream with a dash of vinegar. I learned that if you take out the seeds of the tomato and cucumbers the salad will last longer because of less water.

This is a very good basic Creamy Cucumber and Tomato Salad recipe. I love it just as is but sometimes I add a pinch of dill and a little celery salt. For some of those that say it gets to runny, if you take the seeds out of the cucumber and tomatoes it helps a lot. I cube mine instead of slicing for this purpose.

My family really loved this one! A great way to use our abundance of cucumbers and tomatoes! I love it just the way it is and I've also sprinkled some dill and a little sour cream for a different flavor. Quick and easy!

Wonderful, but you don't need this much sugar--just a pinch!  Added sour cream as another reviewer suggested and so far this week, we've had it three times--LOVE tomato season!!  I've added lettuce, baby spinach and sunflower seeds in varying combinations, and it's always delish!!

Delicious and SO easy! I may try English cucumbers next time, and will blot the tomatoes  dry as I think that will help lower the water content a bit. Even BETTER on day 2! Thanks for sharing!

It was a little tangy. Probably use mayonnaise next time and a little more sugar. Salad dressing just too tart. Like the combination, so summery

This was a quick and easy salad. Very tasty!  I used mayonnaise and red onions, 1 English cucumbers and 2 field/beefsteak tomatoes. I also added about 1 tsp. of Apple cider vinegar. Everyone liked it, there were no leftovers.

Ok, I like to go by the recipe the first time around and rate just the recipe, so there the reason for the 3 stars.  If I were to make again I would first half all the slices as they are too big of pieces for a nice bite.  Halfway through eating the salad I thought it just soso, so I had to add some celery salt and some dill which helped it.  This brought it up to a 4 I guess.  I've add several other cucumber recipes from this site that were much better so I'll stick to them.

This is a great recipe; my husband doesn't care for cucumbers and he couldn't get enough of this salad. It is best when made a day ahead, and the dressing is very similar to a potato salad dressing my Mom made many years ago. I added 1/2 Tblsp of fresh lemon juice, a dash of wine vinegar and used Vidalia onions. I peeled the tomatoes and only used 1 Tblsp of sugar. It's a winner!
