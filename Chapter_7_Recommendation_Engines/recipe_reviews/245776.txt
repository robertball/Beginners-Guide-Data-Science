Focaccia came out INCREDIBLE!
I don't own a bread machine so I combined everything in my stand mixer and let rise for 1 hour.
Next time I will use only 1/4 cup of olive oil, as 1/3 was a bit too much ( I didn't use the whole amount  when dressing the dough, but had a sizable amount left over), cooking at 425 for 20 minutes was perfect for me.

This was really good! I warmed up the oil a little and steeped it with the garlic for a little while, then also used that oil in the bread. For the herbs, I cheated a little and used Italian seasoning. The texture and flavor of the bread was perfect, nice and airy with crispy edges. Thanks so much for a great recipe that is sure to be a repeat!

WOW, this is FANTASTIC!!!!!! It was super simple to whip up in the bread machine too. I did 'steep' the 6 cloves of crushed garlic in the oil, but when I was putting it on the dough, I decided not to use all of the actual garlic pieces b/c I didn't want it to be TOO strong of garlic flavor. I'm glad I didn't because it had the perfect flavor for us. I did follow the recipe exactly otherwise. The dough is so nice and easy to work with, and I loved all the little air pockets it created once it was baked. Mine did only take around 15 minutes to bake, so make sure you keep an eye on it while it's in the oven. I had just took it out when my mom came in, and the first words out of her mouth were, "What's baking that smells so good...I want some" (I did give her half to take home, lol). I really can't say enough good things about this focaccia... the flavors, the texture, it's just wonderful! This is one that I will be making again and again and again and...YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

It took my bread machine on dough an hour and a half. I did use 1 cup whole wheat and 2 cups white. Next time I will try with all white.
