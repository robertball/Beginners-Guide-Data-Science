This was so good.  I don't usually rave about my own cooking, but I did this time, thanks to your recipe.  My whole family loved it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

The sauce was tasty, but way too thin, like water, even though I reduced and reduced forever. The timing was way off, too, it took much MUCH longer. Will try it again and figure out how to thicken the sauce.

It sounded good but, I will probably not make it again.  I thought the spices were a little too much.

I thought this was a great quick supper.  I had 1" boneless loin chops, so baking was perfect, nice and moist.  I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover cranberry sauce I had in the fridge, so I used an equal amount of wine and 1 clove of garlic, fresh parsley, but just a dash of dried sage and thyme.  My husband said he'd like it even better with a turkey cutlet!

My family and I loved this recipe, the sauce was amazing.  I did cut the cooking wine to just 1 cup because some of the other comments noted that the sauce was too runny.  Also, instead of placing the chops back into the skillet I poured the sauce over the pork chops and cooked them for 10 min in the oven.  These pork chops were amazing!

This recipe was good. It wasn't my favorite pork recipe but it was decent. If I make it again I will cut back on the spices.

I used this recipe on a "center sliced pork leg".  It came out great.  Moist and slightly sweet, just the way pork should be.  I omitted the oven part as I saw no need for it.

I like fruit with pork and enjoy the flavor of wine in cooking so I thought I would really love this recipe. In the end it was just OK. Good, but not fabulous.  It does get points for easy prep and quick cooking though.

A nice different way to enjoy pork cutlets.  I didn't use the oven at all for the recipe.  I just used 2 pans on the stove top. I made the sauce in one pan and browned the pork and kept it warm in the skillet until the sauce was finished.  I then proceeded with the recipe using Pinot Grigio for the white wine.  I didn't have fresh sage, so I used fresh basil.  This was served with 'Onion Rice' from AR and a tossed salad.  Everyone enjoyed the meal.

This turned out great! I let the sauce reduce a bit which made it even more flavorful.

This time I took a 1 inch pork loin chop and put a pocket in it. Starting with a partly frozen chop. Then tenderized the meat and used some Montreal Chicken Seasoning on both sides. Stuffed them with Kraft Pork Stuffing. Then I follow the recipe for the sauce, but I put the spice in and cooked them down as well. Then they meld and mellow together. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

The ingredients were great. I didn't add the parsley. And I used dry spices instead of fresh. I cooked the sauce down so that it was more like a glaze. Next time I will take pork chops out after 20 minutes to keep them more moist and cook sauce alone till thickened.

I liked the sauce (did reduce the amount of thyme) but it got a mixed reception from my young kids. Very easy to make!

Very good, juicy and tender! I used boneless cutlets about 1 inch thick. I substituted 1/3 cup of apple cider instead of the wine. You could use orange juice and ground orange rind for a different substitution. There is too much liquid in the recipe as written. I also used fresh (frozen) cranberries not cranberry sauce. Instead of herbs described, I used ginger and cinnamon with 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. The spices can be adjusted or changed to taste.

I think it turned out very good. I used dried herbs instead of fresh, jellied cranberry instead of whole, and a little wondra flour to thicken the sauce because it was so watery. My 2 year old seemed to enjoy it as well. As long as approval from the other family comes I'll definitely make this again!

We liked this. I did not use the full amounts of herbs, knowing my family's preference.I used home canned cranberry sauce. I am sure I will make this again.

Used 2 c of frozen cranberries, 1 c of sugar. Cooked them separately to create a sauce. I also used only 1 c of wine. It was great!

I will make it again. It was over cooked (my fault?). The cook time should be about half of what is stated or maybe my pork cutlets were too thin? Anyway, pork does not have to be over cooked and is better served medium rare to rare. The  sauce was delicious and saved the dinner

Reduced serving for 2.  Did not have sage but replaced with Rosemary.  Turned out well. Served with Parmigiana Cheese mashed potatoes and peas and pearl onions.

Perfect easy dish for the entire family!  I didn't change anything except using the dried herbs I already had on hand.  Very tender pork paired well with blackened green beans and herbed butternut squash, and of course the a glass of the rest of the wine!  Even by kids loved this dish!

I made this and it was good but to herby for my family. If I were to make it again I would go with my instincts and only do a teaspoon of herbs instead of tablespoons.
