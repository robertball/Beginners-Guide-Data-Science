I was so excited to try this because I LOVE barley, and it did not disappoint.  I changed the raisins and almonds to peas and carrots because I had just had a bad experience with both (kidney stone anyone???) and we need our veggies!  I added 1/2 cup more chicken broth to help cook the carrots and added more curry per other reviews.  Also used oil instead of butter.  Fantastic taste - I really like the subtle allspice flavor.  Ate this with some tilapia - DELISH.

This looked great, but we found it disappointing - bland and boring. If you do make it, double the spices. You can also cut the butter to 2 tsp. oil.

excellent and so simple! Afraid that it wouldn't be enough curry flavor,so I added one tsp. Perfect. Also didn't have pearl barley and pot barley worked great. Thank you

Absolutely delicious!  I did, however make a few changes that I learned from the comments of other cooks on here (THANK YOU)!  To start with, I used a 1/8 cup more butter, added garlic, carrots and lentils to the onions as they sauteed and more chicken stock than the recipe called for, probably about a cup more to help cook the lentils and carrots.  I left out the raisins and almonds. 
I also added a cup of coconut milk and MORE THAN DOUBLED all of the spices.  I used it as a main dish with some naan bread and raita and it was SO hearty and filling.

With a few changes, I loved it!! Sauteed everything in olive oil; doubled the curry - could even take more. I'm not crazy about raisins and BF doesn't like almonds so I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added lentils - perfect with the spices! I also meant to add toasted pine nuts for a bit of a crunch but I forgot... next time!!

Doubled the curry, halved the allspice, cut out almonds and raisins.  Used regular barley so it took a bit longer to cook but it was well worth it.  This was the first time I had attempted to make anything using barley and I am kicking myself that I haven't tried it earlier.  Tender, flavorful, this makes and excellent side for the savory chicken broccoli I made for dinner.  Just what I needed.  Thanks for the great recipe!

What is old is new again!  I just got a pressure cooker--now completely safe with 3 safeguards--they don't blow up, no matter how hard you try!  The cooking time is at least halved for most things. Some recipe cook times are cut by ten!  This particular recipe can be done in 18 minutes! I am no longer spending my Sundays cooking. Bean soups, risottos, pilafs and even meatloaf with potatoes all in 10-20 minutes.  Consider the fuel and electicity you'll save.  Huge.  No longer do I consider that I don't have time to cook barley, for example.  It has revolutionized my cooking.

Excellent Vegetarian dish!  If you don't have allspice substitute equal parts nutmeg, cinnamon and ground clove.  I doubled the spices and used 1-1/4 teapoons of curry.  Great dish for additions - I added peas and will try w/ carrots also next time.  I only used 2T of butter to reduce fat and it was perfect.  Toasted pine nuts would probably be a nice substitution for the almonds - but they can be pricey.  If you add veggies - up the chicken broth by a 1/2 C - I used a 32 oz container of chicken stock and it was perfect.  Definitely a keeper and will be making again (and again!).

5 stars for the ease and simplicity and HEALTHFULNESS! I used quick cooking barley and it turned out great, if a bit soft, and added some finely chopped carrots and grilled chicken. I agree fully with increasing the spices, but this is great food that comes together with minimal effort.

Made this with non-fat/low sodium broth, doubled the curry powder, used a smidge over the 1/2 tsp. salt (kosher) and ground pepper. It was absolutely delish and so easy to prepare! WINNER!

I wouldn't serve this as a main dish, but as a side dish, it's a nice start.  I added 1/2 cup of lentils along with some extra liquid.  In addition, I added 1 tbsp each of ginger and garlic, more curry, and skipped the allspice.  I love the idea of barley instead of rice.  Thanks for the inspiration!

I made this recipe almost to the T, which I never do, and I regretted it.  There was very little flavor and the barley was undercooked.  I had to cook it much longer than the recipe predicted as well.  This wasn't a disaster as I was cooking to eat it later, but could have been.    This needs a lot more spices to get to tasting anything like indian.  I also added some diced chicken to make it hold up as a meal in itself.  After I did this, added more liquid, and cooked it a bit more I ended up with something I liked.    I love this concept though, and will try to come up with a recipe myself that does what I wish this one did!

I was looking for something my roommate could eat easily during Lent (he's Orthodox, so he has to go vegan, no olive oil, nothing like that during Lent) and I found this. Figured I might as well try it. I was wary, mostly because my roommate and his fiancee (who's my other roommate) both HATE most Indian foods, but I figured, hey, might as well try it. Add in the fact that the two of them are really picky and I was worried.

I used fake-Butter instead of Butter, low sodium veggie broth instead of chicken brother, added carrots and peas, and doubled the various spices per someone else's review, and it was AMAZING. Everyone loved it. I think when I remake this during lent, I might even fry up some seitan or tofu to toss in it. :)

Made this for the first time this evening for dinner and it was a huge hit!  In fact, this was the first time I ever cooked barley in my entire life, but now, thanks to this recipe, I'll definitely be making it again.  I followed the recipe exactly as wroitten except I didn't add the raisins or the nuts.  Thanks for posting this yummy recipe!

As written a 4, but if you double the curry and allspice a definite 5. So wonderful! I also think it would be great with lentils, rice, or quinoa. Also, I strongly recommend using the raisins and almonds. They really put this dish over the top. I even added chicken and made it into a meal in itself. Yum!

This was pretty good, but while cooking it I decided to add some more curry and some cinnamon.  Then I added in the raisins and nuts while it was still cooking.  My son on the other hand didn't care for it--I guess it's not really a kid thing....

Pretty tasty. But, I did have to triple the curry. 1/4 teaspoon is not nearly enough. The raisins are a MUST.

Tasty.  Probably didn't need to use all that butter but did anyway.  Had to add about 1/2 tsp. more of the curry and turmeric to "up" the flavor.  Used a scant half tsp. of salt.  Also needed to simmer a tad big longer which required about 1/3 cup more broth.  Overall was very tasty after making some minor alterations.

I like the flavor of this, and it is a nice change from the usual fast carbs.  I did have to change it for my food plan.  I used 1t smart balance and cooking spray instead of 1/4c butter.  Cut the almonds amount in half.  Also did not have curry powder so I substituted a mix of coriander, cumin and Chinese 5 spice.  The combo actually worked quite well.  The flavor is probably is much richer with butter, but since I'll never know for sure I will continue to enjoy as I made it.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! I make it all the time.  It's especially great to fool those who either a/don't like curry or b/don't like barley.  Highly unlikely to find someone who won't like it.

I think that all of the spices need to be eyeballed and are definitely a bit more than what it calls for, that is, if you care for flavor.  Additionally to that, I add a little brown sugar.

I omitted the butter, salt and almonds.  I subbed homemade vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  It smelled so good while cooking!  This is a delicious dish!

Wow, even the kid liked this!  A great alternative for rice. I usually make my curries with cinnamon, that was my only substitution. To make it a little more heart healthy I will replace the butter with olive oil when I make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Made some changes and tasted great:

(Take it from an Indian guy):
1) Heat some oil
2) Add black mustard seeds and wait till they start popping
3) Add onions, sliced serrano peppers still oninons brown
4) Add barley and spices (mix and match Indian spices) and cook.

Tastes great! I made it exactly as written, then added more of the spices until I liked it, which means a bit more salt, and a full extra tsp of curry. Fantastic savory side!

I wish I had read some reviews before making it but I was in a rush and wanted something new.  Instinct told me that the amount of curry wasn't going to be enough so I doubled it. I still thought it was on the bland side.  

I plan to add garlic and increase the turmeric and pepper and will probably quadruple the curry powder.   

I liked the texture and it is a good way to add a healthful grain to the diet.

My whole family loved it!  I added 1 full tsp of curry powder like the other reviewers plus a cinnamon stick, extra cumin and termeric.  I omitted the almonds and raisins and replaced with peas and carrots.   I served it with rotisserie chicken the first night and sprinkled it on a salad the next day.  Made me feel good to feed my family this meal.

This is a great alternative to a rice side dish. I had only ever used barley in soups, but after watching Chef Jamie Oliver prepare a barley dish, it inspired me to find this recipe here.  It went well with the Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala dish I also made, and of course, naan bread. Made it as written, though I didn't add the almonds or raisins.  After 30 min, I added about a tbsp of broth and let it continue for another 10 min. Expect the barley to be "el dente" after 40 min. I will definitely make it again.

To make sure you can follow this recipe "as is" especially with regard to cooking times and to achieve perfect texture, soak the barley for 8-24 hours (it will also be more digestible)   I tripled the amount of spices.  The whole family thought it was absolutely delicious, and as a health coach I am thrilled because it is also very healthy, satisfying and inexpensive! Not to mention it keeps for a long time.  Cannot wait to make it again-- and I will add a picture this time :-)

Amazeballs.  We had it as a side dish with dinner and then on a bed of mixed baby greens the next day for lunch with a light vinaigrette and sliced avocado.  Restaurant worthy, so easy and delicious.

Well it tasted pretty good. My 3 rating is not for the flavor of the food but for the actual recipe. I cooked it for 30 minutes and not close. 10 more minutes and the barley was still hard (and still simmering). One hour and I gave up.

This is a 4 as written a 5 with the changes.  The changes include doubling the spices. to 1 tsp curry, 1 tsp tumeric and 1/2 tsp allspice. I also added 1/2 tsp ginger.  I used bullion cubes instead of canned broth  and it was plenty salty so I omitted the extra salt.  I'd probably omit the pepper next time too.

This was rockin'! I cleaned the plate as well as spooned the leftovers into my mouth as I washes the dishes..   Yummy.  It could use slightly less butter, but only if you have a lean main course.

hard to know how this recipe would be on its own, as i followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled all the spices (with 8x the curry!...2 teaspoons, as i love curry). i omitted the almonds and put in cauliflower, frozen peas, and frozen corn). i also put in hot sauce. so, so, so good. the barley was so tender. i had never cooked barley before and found it to be like soft, yummy rice. it may very well replace rice for me in many dishes from now on. this dish is ideal for throwing in whatever vegetables you have in the house...spinach, peppers, etc.

It was good, however, my husband didn't like the raisins, and my children 5 and 4 didn't care for it. I thought the flavor was good, but apparently just not the right recipe for my family!

This was a very flavorful, change from your typical rice dish. I pretty much stuck to the recipe and I enjoyed the outcome. I didn't have almonds or raisin, so I left those out, but I imagine it'd be as yummy with them as it was without. I also added several splashes of hot sauce (since I love spicy) and it added a lot to the dish. For the person who thought it was bland, I'd recommend adding some heat.

Excellent - and very healthy! I substituted ginger for the allspice, and doubled all the spices. I added shredded carrots & chopped zucchini - and left out the raisins & nuts this time around! I also used 1 can of chicken broth - and water to make up the difference.   Very tasty!!! Now I want more! Thank you!!!

This is a great side-dish alternative to rice or potatoes.  I added more curry and cinnamon for a bit more spicy flavor.  The raisins add just the right touch of sweetness.  The barley does not get soft and mushy but retains a little crunchiness.  Perfect.  This one is a keeper for me.

We really enjoyed this, I just wish I had halved the recipe  because it made a LOT and there's just 2 of us. Next time I will up the curry powder a little (brands vary and I think the one I have is on the mild side of flavor). A nice change from potatoes & rice.

I really liked how this turned out, but I did make adjustments based on reviews so hard to say if the original would have been as good! 
I chopped up a medium carrot and threw it in with the onion. I tripled the curry powder, and used 1 cup barley and 1/2 cup of French green lentils. For the liquid, 2 cups of stock and 2 cups of light coconut milk was perfect. I actually forgot all about the raisins and the almonds, but it didn't matter! The dish was excellent without. The lentils and the coconut milk added a great creaminess next to the al dente barley. Served with roasted cauliflower, it made a filling vegetarian dish!  Will make again for sure.

Yum! To be honest I tripled the spices and didn't have any raisins so I left that out. As it's cooking, just taste to get the seasoning where you like it.  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is a great idea. But like other reviewers I tweaked it a little. I used 4 cups of broth instead of 3 1/2. I also doubled all the spices except the curry which I quadrupled (used 1 teaspoon). I also used cumin instead of turmeric which is just a preference of mine. Next, I added carrots, mushrooms & garlic in with the onions and barley in the beginning. I also used olive oil instead of butter, again just a preference thing. I didn't have almonds or raisins so I didn't put those in at the end, but I'm sure it would add something. Came out delicious!

Just like everyone else had to up the spices. I did about 1 tbs of cumin, allspice and curry. I didn't have any turmeric (hence the cumin) the flavour was yummy though. I ate it with a small amount of skinless chicken and it was very filling. My daughter (2 years) wasn't a huge fan even though she normally likes curry dishes, oh well!

I toned down the spices a bit to meet the palates of the whole family, including young kids: used 1/8 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp turmeric, and 1/8 tsp curry powder. Also chose not to add the dried fruit as the kids balk at that in cooked dishes so used what I had on hand: finely diced up some carrot and kale. This was delicious - I had to restrain myself from eating more when I was already full. Was also good left over. I served it with Maple Salmon and the pairing was outstanding.

Just superb.  Nice flavours, good mix.  Added more raisins and added toasted sliced almonds just before serving.  I love it.

Doubled all the spices and could probably use more.

We absolutely loved this recipe!   We did make a few changes based on previous reviews because we love spice.  Instead of 1/4 teaspoon of curry we added five 1/8 teaspoons of curry spices using Penzey's hot curry, sweet curry, Vindaloo, Garam Masala and Tandoory spice and doubled both the allspice and turmeric.  It was a great accompaniment to a roast chicken on a cold, blustery Saturday night.

I've done this with lentils when I didn't have barley.  Excellent.  I also doubled the curry and garlic as we like it a bit spicier! But great basic recipe to jump off from.  Any beans or coarse grains work, even a combo.  I use the pressure cooker.  I bet a slow cooker would work as well!  THank you!

I doubled the spices as somebody suggested and also doubled the butter. This came out so good! So I give it four stars for a good stars; Update the recipe with the above improvements and it's certainly a five-star.

I followed the other reviewers advice and doubled the spices, used olive oil instead of butter and added peas and carrots. It was delicious. My husband raved about it and I've added it to our dinner rotation. Wonderful served with Indian Butter Chicken recipe on Allrecipes. Only giving it a 4 due to changes that had to be made.

In addition to doubling the spices as most have recommended, I changed the ratio of barley to water (because I used a pressure cooker).  Instead, I used 1 cup barley to 4 1/2 cups water and cooked it on high for 18 minutes.  

When I made the recipe on the stove with the 1 1/2 cup barley to 3 1/2 cups water, I found that I had to keep adding boiling liquid - it took close to an hour with the recipe the way it is written.  The ratio pearled barley to water is not right.

Loved this--a great way to get in some extra fiber.  The recipe has a lot of flavor.  Only thing I would change would be to add some extra raisins.

I am glad I read the reviews.  I also doubled the spices, used carrots and corn with a few raisins.  I had about a half cup of cooked Italian ground sausage, so I tossed that in.  It really added alot of flavor.

This recipe is simmering now! It smells fantastic.
I used extra curry powder and turmeric. I also sauteed some tilapia with the onions and barley, just to add some flakey protein to make it a main dish. I didn't have any butter, so I used olive oil. Also didn't have ground allspice, just whole, so I had a fun time trying to chop it up with my dull knife! Can't wait until it's done, my mouth is watering!

Like most people I doubled the curry and I also put the raisins in with the broth (I like them that way).  It's not a strongly spiced dish as others have commented on, but the dish could take them if you wanted to add them.  But the flavors are lovely anyway.  I don't think anyone was trying to claim that it was Indian food, and for Indian-inspired it's fine.

I LOVE this recipe! Cut the butter and just use enough oil to saute the onions and barley, double the spices, replace chicken broth with vegetable broth, added mushrooms, zucchini, and cherry tomatoes. The raisins with the spices were amazing. Served with salmon.

My boyfriend and I both loved this.  However, I followed others' advice and double all of the spices.  I didn't have any raisins and forgot to top it with the almonds and it was still delicious.  I think it would be really bland without doubling the spices, but totally worth it if you do. Thanks for sharing!

This was incredibly easy and tasty. My 8, 5 and 1 year olds loved it, in spite of their supposed dislike of onions! We left the slivered almonds and raisins as sides so the kids could choose whether or not to top their barley with either of those. Everyone was happy!

my family loved this recipe...it was a great change from the regular sides. I did add more broth and curry, left out the raisons and nuts, and added spinach. I will make this again soon.

This was delicious! I need to make sure I have barley on hand now just to be able to make this dish. I'm not really a raisin-in-things person, so I didn't use any raisins, but otherwise followed the recipe. Soooooo good!
