I mixed this up because it seemed like it needed more. I used red onion and added red bellpepper, garlic, black beans and diced green chili peppers. Also for flavor added some cumin, red pepper and a dash of chili powder. YUM.

We have this fairly often.  My husband loves it even though the first time he saw it he had definite reservations. I sprinkle a little cheddar on top ours.  It's equally good over either chips or rice.  But my favorite way to use this recipe is as a quesadilla filler (again, with a little cheddar.)

This was very tasty. I just gobbled it down in a big soup bowl. I will probably make this again, and I will take the suggestion to serve it over steamed rice, and perhaps with tortilla chips. The dish was somewhat soupy, as a previous reviewer complained, but I'm sure that rice will nicely soak it up, making it very tasty too. Also, I used cubed chicken; next time I will try to take the time to shred it instead; I think that will give the chicken more surface area to absorb the other flavors. I also appreciated that this was a quick dish to make.

Incredible! I cooked the chicken (in tiny bite-sized pieces) in olive oil and Penzey's Chicken Taco Seasoning.  In a tbs of olive oil, I sauteed the (red) onion.  Didn't measure the cilantro OR the salsa verde (Probably used more than called for).  Taking heed of the "Soupy" warnings, I omitted the broth entirely.  (This DOES need salt - so don't forget to add that!) And, finally: I took TAMMYBYERLY's idea of using it as a Quesadilla filler, with Reduced Fat Mexican blend cheese.  (Set out Light Sour Cream & La Victoria's Cilantro Salsa for topping).

Excellent! I did add a clove of garlic during hte first step and cooked my chicken with cumin, garlic, and lime-infused salt to give the dish plenty of flavor. It was a tad liquidy, but that was fine with me because I served it over rice. Also baked up some corn tortillas and served those on the side. Definitely a make again. Thanks!

I added lime juice with the salsa and put tomatoes in at the end, then served the dish in tortilla shells. I think it would have been better with rice mixed in. I'd probably make it again and try it with the rice.

This recipe was a good meal to throw together when you are low on groceries because it didn't have a lot of ingredients.  However, it was a little bland as-is.  I added some cumin, garlic salt, and used green enchilada sauce and it helped with the flavors.  Good, but not great.

I was skeptical about trying out this recipe, especially when I put everything together in the pan. I thought I had cilantro, but I really only had GREEN ONIONS - which you can imagine is what I used as a substitution. Though, that was my ONLY change! I had marinated some chicken that I had frozen, so before I left for work I stuck it in the fridge to thaw it out. Cooked the chicken, set it aside and followed directions accordingly. I used "HERDEZ SALSA VERDE" for the green salsa and measured exactly 7 oz. We made our own chips with just flour tortilla and vegetable oil. Served it over jasmine rice seasoned with black pepper. A dish you MUST SERVE HOT! Despite that I didn't have cilantro and used green onions instead, it was still soo delicious!! Boyfriend and I loved it and both had fun making it! I'll be sure to use cilantro next time! I think for those who feel that this is lacking flavor, definitely marinate your chicken and make sure to serve hot! Thanks so much for the recipe!!

After cooking a whole chicken we always have enough leftover to make this recipe.  Great over brown rice.

We loved this!  Like most people, I  served it over rice. I added cumin, garlic, some black beans and frozen corn and additional green salsa.  All this simmered for a while longer than the recipe called for, so there was no problem with its being watery.  If it were, the rice would just soak it up and be even tastier.  Will definitely fix this again.  I would think it could be  modified for a vegetarian simply by leaving out the chicken and adding more corn and beans.

I love this dish.  My husband loves this dish.  I quartered a Cornish game hen and seared the pieces on both sides for about 5 minutes per side.  Then added the remaining ingredients.  Simmered on medium-low heat for about 20 minutes, then low for another 10.  Served over rice.  My husband raved with every bite.  This one's a keeper!

A great recipe but it definitely needs cumin. I made my own green chili sauce in place of the green salsa (canned green chilies, cumin, garlic). I cooked the onions until they were almost melting before I added the chicken, chili sauce and chicken broth. Then I cooked down the liquid and only added the cilantro after I turned off the heat since cilantro is a delicate herb. I served this nacho style. I lined up tortilla chips on a baking sheet. Spread a layer of the chicken mixture and then topped it with cheese and baked until melted. I served the nacho with sour cream and beans and rice on the side. Even my three yr old ate it up.

Awesome! Plain and simple. This is the first recipe I've tried off of here and it is wonderful. I love cilantro! I made 4 servings of white rice and just mixed it all together after all was cooked. It was simple and easy. I cubed 3 chicken breast halves and cooked them with juice from 1/2 a lime and some crushed red pepper. Very tasty!!!

I made this the first time because I was looking for something different and easy.  I'm not big on cilantro but I figured "why not?".  my husband loved it and a friend who stopped by (and had already eaten dinner), couldn't help but eat it as well :O)  I did change it a bit...I doubled the onion and added a hot pepper (red in color...someone gave it to me...chile perhaps?).  I also added a few cloves garlic, some cumin and a splash of lime and dry white wine.  I fried the chicken separately until almost done with a dusting of garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne and cumin so that it had a bit more flavor.  I did use the stock but I used butter/flour to thicken a bit so that it wasn't too soupy. And for health reasons, I always use brown rice! Will definitely make again!

This was very tasty!  I added a chopped fresh Jalapeno in with the onion.  To prepare the chicken, I rubbed taco seasoning on liberally and then grilled it.

Very good!  We seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, chili powder, and cayenne pepper before cooking.  Also used red onion.  We ate it over chips, which was good, but we thought it would also be great over rice or in a tortilla.  (Or even better, with rice IN a tortilla!)

Very delicious and easy to cook recipe! It's not too spicy, cause you can pick the spiciness level when you buy the can of green salsa. I picked medium spice.

This is perfect just the way it is!  I LOVE cilantro and so I love that is what you taste in this dish.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I will make this again and again.

Even my son who hates cilantro loved this dish. Used less broth and added unsweetened greek yogurt to make it a touch creamy.  Served on warm tortillas with a squeeze of lime.

This was yummy. I love the fresh cilantro, which is something I rarely ever use. I added some garlic cloves and cumin, otherwise I kept everything the same. I had no problems with it being "soupy" since I let it set for a bit longer than instructed. I used this mixture for burritos and it was very satisfying. I'm thinking of using the leftovers in a salad for lunch.

This was really good!  I used Embasa Salsa Verde which turned out to be really hot - and we like hot - but a little too much for us.  I will find a milder salsa next time.  Served over white rice but also enjoyed the leftovers in flour tortillas with a dollop of sour cream.  Easy and quick! Updated to five stars.  This is SO good; I've made it several times and stuck with Embasa Salsa Verde after all.  Yum!

This was a super easy recipe to make, but I was a bit disappointed with the outcome.  I didn't find it to be as flavorful as I was expecting.  While I did enjoy this recipe, it wasn't good enough that I will make it again.

This is great!  My husband absolutely loves it.  Cilantro is great anyways, but this is a quick and easy meal.  The only change I made is to add three cloves of minced garlic in with the onion.  We like garlic.  My husband eats it by itself with shredded cheese and chopped tomato on top.  I use it as a taco filling.  Either way we have it about once a week.  Thanks!

This recipe has become a regular at our house. The kids are skeptical, but my husband and I really like it. I have made it as written, but have also added thawed frozen spinach to the skillet with the  onions. We have used it with grilled chicken and with leftover rotisserie  chicken with equally  great results. Our favorite way to eat it is with whole-grain tortilla chips.

Simple, quick and delicious. This is a great way to use up leftover chicken or pork (a great substitute) and that half-bunch of coriander remaining after using the first half for some other dish.

I have been making my own version of “Salsa Chicken” for years but this one was even better! I like the addition of the onions and cilantro.  I used extra seasoning on mine: taco seasoning mix, cumin, chili powder, garlic, and salt and pepper.  I used Jardine’s Hatch Green Chili medium salsa and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese right before I pulled it off the burner. I cut down the chicken broth and just used as needed. It turned out super flavorful and crispy!

I made just as recipe was written. I let the broth reduce down so it wasn't watery at all. Next time I will add shredded cheese and use as a burrito or enchilada filling. Yum!!!

At first, we left out the chicken broth like some suggested.  After tasting, we added it in then cooked it down.  It helped with the strong tart taste of the salsa.  We seasoned the chicken with homemade taco seasoning prior to cooking.  Served it with tortilla chips, guacamole and refried black beans.  Everyone agreed that it was delicious.  Easy to make and will go in the rotation.  Only suggestion that I would make is to add the fresh cilantro in after cooking and let it wilt.  It's much more fragrant and tasty that way.

I made this tonight and the hubby and I loved it.  I served it over white rice with tortilla chips.  I made it just like the recipe stated.  I can see how others would want some cumin in it, maybe I will try it next time.  Since I make shredded chicken in the crockpot each week this is a great way to use some of it up.  So good!

I really wasn't sure about this, my husband found the recipe, and I usually don't like cilantro.  Not sure if I added a cup, but it mixed so well with the onion and the salsa.  I added a pinch of cumin, maybe a half a tsp of garlic powder, and red pepper instead of black pepper.  really good on chips!

I loved this!  I made it exactly as the recipe states(except for switching out the vegetable oil for olive oil), and it was delicious!  I used Pace's salsa verde and it was great!   I also browned my chicken with garlic, olive oil, & S&P.  I cubed my chicken, but think it would be better shredded.  Super easy and a great way to use up cilantro in your fridge.  I served over rice and it was perfect.  Husband loved it, and it will definitely become a regular at my house.  Quick note:  I am a cheese lover, but obviously trying to watch my calories, and I love this recipe because it really didn't need it, and I usually think everything needs cheese! ;)

Very yummy! I was a little nervous to try this one when I saw what it looked like but it was delicious! I agree, adding some chicken taco seasoning when you cook the chicken helps give it something extra. As for the "soupy" nature of the dish, it ended up being just fine once I let it set for a few minutes - made a nice sauce to pour over the dish and got soaked up by the rice. Made left-overs. Thank you for sharing!

I liked it. I left out the chicken broth. I didnt see the purpose for it. I squized a lime into it. I used it in tacos. Very tasty! Next time I'll chop up a fresh jalapeno & cook it in the chicken.

This is soo yummy! My husband is Spanish and asks for this all the time. I had never boiled chicken before, but decided to cook it real Mexican style and boil it. The meal turned out great! Spicy and authentic!

I loved this.  The tomatillo salsa I used had green olives in it.  I also added sweet red pepper and a cup of corn.  I cooked this all together and added my broth at the end.  I then lowered the heat and reduced it until it thickened.  I added shredded-grilled chicken at the very end and served it in a soft taco shell. This was fantastic!  Looking forward to the leftovers!

I cooked the chicken, as one reviewer said, in lime juice with crushed red pepper.
Found it best served over Spanish rice filled with lots of veggies.

This was pretty good, but I concur with the other reviewer that it was definitely missing something and I couldn't figure out what it was. I tried it with rice and with tortilla chips. Both were good, but neither were that secret missing ingredient.

This was pretty good. It worked for me and the ingredients I had in the house. Good, easy to make dinner. I cooked some white rice in the rice cooker and we were good to go in under 30 minutes.

this was a huge hit and my husband asks me to make it all the time. I don't handle spice too well, so I make it with half the tomatillo sauce and fill in the rest of the ingredient with recaito, and I love it!

I liked it. The family didn't. I'll have to find a milder green salsa and try it again.

This was terrific!  Thank-you Norma.  I added some serranos to "spice it up" a bit, but otherwise, no changes needed.  Highly recommended!
