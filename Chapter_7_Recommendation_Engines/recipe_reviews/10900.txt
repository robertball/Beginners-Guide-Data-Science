I like to add more of the fruit and nuts as well as extra oats for a slightly chewier cookie. But thanks Mary, I liked them.

These are very good cookies.  I used cranraisins instead of raisins and did not grind them.  To make life easier instead of using a pastry blender to cut in the shortening I put 4 cups of the flour into the food processor and gave it a couple of flicks and it was all cut in perfectly and quickly.  I did not use the egg wash either.  Cookies were good and will use the recipe again simply because it makes a big batch of good cookies.

Kids LOVED these! I made almost exactly (I didn't have peanuts so substitued almonds instead). The only problem I encountered was that it took 12 minutes to bake as opposed to 8-10 as indicated. Minor issue as my oven could just be a bit "slow". My kids told me that they taste just like Christmas cookies. A very good cookie indeed!

This is a tasty and "substantial" cookie. Since the raisins and peanuts are ground, they are beautifully disguised in this treat.  Makes quite a big batch.

I made these for Christmas as a part of my cookie gifts I give to friends and family ever year. I used only two cups of sugar and they were plenty sweet. I used yellow raisins and almonds instead of the peanuts and dark raisins. My husband loved them and he has still not noticed the raisins in the cookie. (Not a fan of raisins) Its a nice large batch for big family or giving out. Molasses flavor really stands out so if don't like that flavor, not your cookie.

I made a half recipe to try them out.  Used 1 whole egg and one egg yolk in the half recipe of cookie tough and then brushed them with just the egg white.  They came out nice and chewy with a somewhat shiny crisp surface.  I used a food processor to grind the peanuts and raisins and then again to cut the shortening in.  This was an interesting method for a cookie.  I did have to substitute 1/4 cup of butter for part or the shortening. Would like to try these again using apricots and walnuts for raisins and peanuts.

I know I shouldn't rate this because I did a lot of changing. I didn't grind the peanuts and raisins. I put the peanuts on top because I wanted my 1 year old grandson to enjoy them. (Mom could just pick them off.)I used my electric mixer to do most of the work. I did add raisins in the mix. Overall, they were delicious!
