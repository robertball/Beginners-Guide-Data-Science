I made your receipe EXACTLY as written but the yolks came out liquid raw. Gross! Later,   I viewed some other instant pot recipes for hard boiled eggs and they had 5 or more minutes of pressure cook time plus waiting 5 minutes before putting them ice water.

THIS IS KEY: Buy eggs about a week before prep. If eggs are too fresh, they will be hard to peel. My recipe is 5-4-5: five minutes for pressure to build; 4 minutes to cook; 5 minutes natural reduce pressure. (Pressure build may be longer â€” depends on model.) Quick release then move eggs to ice water bath before peeling.

I love making hard boiled eggs in the instant pot.  They are perfect every time.  I use the 5-5-5 method just to make it easy to remember.  Set pot on high and timer for 5 minutes and then the same as the instructions here for the rest except i put them in a bowl of ice water to cool.

My new way to hard boil eggs. Did the 5,5,5 and when I peeled the eggs, the shells just slipped off.

I found the 5-5-5 method the best.  4 minutes were not enough and 6 minutes too long.  5 minutes were perfect.

Perfect recipe for hard boiled eggs! I used 18 large eggs, for pickled eggs, and this was so easy and quick. From start to finish this took 20 minutes and the shells just slipped off. I'm going to tuck this one into my back pocket for future use. Thank you!!

Eggcellent! I was worried that these might be overdone or not done enough but they were perfect! I have chickens and have tried every trick out there as far as peeling goes and none of the methods have ever worked. The IP is magic and these peeled off in one small swoop. This will absolutely be my go to recipe when it comes to hard cooked eggs. Again....perfect!
