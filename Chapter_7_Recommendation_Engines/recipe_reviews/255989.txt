Really yummy! I cut the enchilada sauce in half and replaced water with 1 cup of chicken broth.

This was a nice easy soup.. I made half a batch but accidentally used the full amount of tomatoes, but it was fine. The only thing I would change would be the amount of enchilada sauce... of course this all depends upon your personal taste and how strong your sauce is  . My bottle  was actually even a few ounces short o what recipe called for and it was stil a bit much. I would use the sauce.. that was good, but maybe swap some out for chicken stock to make it more soupy ans less saucy

This recipe was simple to make once I found the ingredients.  Unfortunately the store was out of enchilada sauce so I substituted sauce.  It was delicious.

I cut the water in half, doubled the chicken (for my husband) and tripled the chipotle peppers (I love spicy food!). We loved it!
