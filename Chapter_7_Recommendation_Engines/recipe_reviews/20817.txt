This is a good recipe. For those who find that it lacks flavor, DO NOT ADD LIQUID. Pork shoulder/boston butt makes lots of its own liquid in the slow cooker (you only dilute the flavor when you add liquid). Just rub the spices over the meat and throw it in the cooker and you will have a flavorful piece of meat (with plenty of liquid) to shred and use for tacos, burritos or whatever.

We make something similar to this for "taco night" at our house.  The only changes I make are, I put the pork roast in the crockpot, season with salt and pepper and garlic and cook all day.  I don't use any liquid. We lightly fry flour tortillas and assemble the tacos!  This is a family favorite!

Rubbed the taco seasoing on the roast the night before and poked the meat several times.  Added a can of mexican chilies to the slow cooker.  Made excellent shredded burritos with the addition of cheese and refried beans.

Incredibly simple idea that made a great dinner.  I used "hot" taco seasoning so I left out the chili powder and red pepper;  but the pork didn't really soak up much of the taco seasoning.  Next time I'll try shredding the pork right in the pot, letting it soak up some of the flavored water, then draining and serving.  Our 1 1/2 lb pork shoulder was done in a little over 6 hours, and made enough for three large "chimichangas".  We put the pork in multigrain tortillas, wrapped them up and baked them for about 15 minutes to get them a little crunchy, then served over a bed of lettuce with chopped red bell pepper, chopped scallions, salsa, black olives, and a little cheese -- a great dinner!

Great recipe-my whole family loved it!  We've eaten this as soup topped with cheese, and we've had this as chalupa meat with lettuce, cheese, & tomatoes.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

This is fantastic!!!  I used the shredded pork to make flautas.  I dipped wheat tortillas in hot oil, rolled the meat up inside each one, then baked in a 350 oven for 25 minutes.  Top off with sour cream and your favorite mexican garnishes.  Everyone raved about em and they were eaten up quickly.

Didn't know what to do with large pork shoulder in the freezer til I found this recipe. Added a green pepper, 2 onions, 2 carrots with the seasonings and water and it was terrific! Made tacos and burritos with the delicious results. My teenaged boys couldn't get enough. Thanks!

The first time I only had one packet of seasoning mix. The second time was definitely better with two. Really easy.

I submitted the recipe a few years ago and THANK YOU for some of your suggestions.  I cut down the water to about 1 cup, used the taco seasoning 1 from this site, and then shredded the meat in its liquid and let it sit on warm for an hour.  Mmmmmmmmm!!!

Can't wait for leftovers tonight!  Everyone loved it :)  I also used 1/3 cup of water with a small bit of chicken boullion added in, one taco seasoning packet and some garlic powder along with the chili powder.  I left out the red pepper flakes for the kids.  Next time, however, I think I'll try this without adding any liquid...the pork seemed to yield enough of its own juices.  I took the pork out of the pot and onto a cutting board to pull it apart and remove any remaining fat.  Then I added the meat back in to simmer with the juices.  Really excellent!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe :)

I used about 1/3 cup vinegar as the only liquid and it was plenty moist at the end. I wanted a little more flavor so after shredding, I added some garlic, salt, pepper, and chipotle powder. It was fantastic on warm corn tortillas or a crusty roll. Will make it again for sure.

If you use the taco seasoning I here, the package mix is equivalent to 2 tablespoons of your homemade.

A very easy and tasty recipe. I put the 4 pound semi-frozen pork shoulder in the crock pot, added 4 tbl of taco seasoning and 1/3 cup of water, set the temp to low and went skiing all day. When I returned in the evening the pork had fallen apart, cooked thoroughly, had just the right amount of moisture and was delicious.

I prefer recipes not have "pkgs of mix" in them.  I keep "ingredients" in my kitchen.  The dish does look in the photo.

Taco Seasoning I...instead of store-bought made this wonderful.  The packaged seasoning always has too much salt and additives.  We did reduce the water by 1/2.  Moisture from CrockPot cooking is there.

This was last nights' dinner and when I took it out of the slow cooker it almost shredded itself! I served it with our favorite sandwich rolls from a nearby bakery and topped it with homemade cole slaw.  Really, really good and soooo simple!

The flavour was okay, but this cut is way too fatty.  I only added 1/4 cup of water (which ended up being too much).  Won't make again.

I really enjoyed this.  Had on hand country style spare ribs.  Followed suggestions to make my own taco seasoning (taco seasoning I from this site).  Coated ribs, put them in the slow cooker with one can of chicken broth and cooked on high for 4 1/2 to 5 hours.  The meat fell off the bone.  Made pork taco's. So, so good!

I cut the recipe in half. I used a half picnic. The pork was cooked perfectly but there was hardly a taco flavor in the pork. Perhaps using 2 packets would have been better, maybe even marinating as others have suggested.

To eliminate MSG, you can use this outstanding taco seasoning. We also put it on pork tenderloin - wonderful stuff!

This was very good and couldn't have been any easier! I let mine cook for 8 hours and then drained the liquid and shredded the meat. I added a can of black beans and a can of corn and put it back in the crock pot on warm until we were ready to eat. Made taco salads last night and are having tostadas tonite! Can't wait!

Easy and inexpensive meal!  I used the taco seasoning I recipe also.  Yes, a lot of liquid but it seemed to separate the fat easier. (Or so I would like to think).  I would make it again.

I didn't add as much water as the recipe called for - just a splash to coat the meat and cooked for 8 hours.  I pulled the pork 5-6 hours into it.  I layered tortillas, the pulled pork, spanish rice, refried beans and lots of cheese. I broiled it on low for a couple of minutes (to melt the cheese) and topped it off with lettuce, tomato, onion, olives, and diced jalepeno to make a mexican pizza.  It's a new family favorite!

This made awesome soft tortilla wraps!! I put this in my crock pot Sunday night and finished it up Monday morning.  A couple of the other reviews were very helpful; I did not add any liquid and the pork itself made plentu, and I did shred it in the liquid and let it sit for about an hour before removing it.  Very tasty and even better left over and reheated.  Two packets of taco seasoning definitely isn't too much.

It was a huge hit with my roommates.

I followed recipe but added two good Rachel Ray palm fulls of " McCormick Hot Mexican Style Chili Powder." I think it still needed more flavor so will do a rub overnight or something like that next time. Served with warm wraps, cheese, sour cream, salsa. Hubby added hot sauce to make his hotter! Will definitely make it again!

i made this last nite into tacos and even though it doesn't call for water i did put in 1/4c and it did turn out wonderful it was so much tastier then just the ordinary beef & chicken tacos i will be making this again. PS.... something tells me that the left over meat from this might be pretty good with the black bean burrito recipe that is also on this site.

This was fantastic. I only out a little water in the bottom of the crock pot, but I wouldn't fill the water over the pork, there would be no flavor.  I added a little minced garlic.  The pork was so tender, everyone went back for 2nds.  We made tacos out of it, will make again!

The meat just fell apart as I was taking it out of the crock pot, it was so tender.  I agree with some though, didn't have much flavor so I'll try it next time without the water.  We used it in burritos, tacos, and refried it the next morning until golden brown and had with eggs.  We all added our own spices to each wonderful dish.  Makes a lot and goes a long way if you are on a tight budget.

I picked this recipe out and my husband made it. After dinner, he said, "I'd make this again in a heartbeat!" We used 4 lbs. of pork and the 2 seasoning packets were the store brand lower salt taco seasoning packets. Super easy & satisfying!

This is an excellent meat recipe for any kind of Mexican recipe you can think up! I added 1/4 cup water with some of the spices to keep the meat from sticking on the bottom, added the meat & the rest of the spices, covered & cooked overnight. The smell was so delicious it woke me up an hour early & the flavor was just as good. A new keeper!

Super easy and the meat just falls apart.  It lacked a little flavor the first time I made it, so I doubled the taco seasoning the second time around.  Used the meat in soft tacos with shredded lettuce, salsa, sour cream.

This was sooooo good! We followed the recipe as is and used the recipe for Taco Seasoning I on this website. I covered the roast about halfway with liquid and once we came home from work, we shredded the roast with a couple forks. Had this as soft tacos and am looking forward to having it as enchiladas!!!

I liked the recipe for using in burritos.  Meat had nice flavor.
Hubby doesn't like texture of shredded pork so it wasn't a favorite with him.  Will make again though - great for freezing and taking lunch - 1/2 burrito, shredded pork, salsa, light sour cream, shredded cheese and shredded lettuce. Heat pork and put together at work.

My family loved this. I only had one package of taco seasoning mix. I increased the chili powder to 1/4 cup with a light sprinkling of cayenne pepper. I cut slits into the pork shoulder and pushed some of the seasoning down inside. My son and his friends finished it off last night as a topping for super nachos. Thanks!

I improvised this by adding a large can of whole green chiles with the juice, and a 14 oz can of fire roasted tomotoes with the juice and did not add any water.  It cooked on low in the slow cooker for 10 hours and was so easy to shred when we got home.  Served with low carb tortillas, cheese, salsa and fresh cilantro for a nutritious meals.  Yummy!

I had 4 pounds. Cooked on low for 8.5 hours added 1/3 cup of water and two taco seasoning packets. Went to work came home, meat was falling off the bone! My family loved it. So juicy and tender! 1/3 cup of water was perfect.

What an awesome recipe. Following other reviews, we cut the water down to nothing and it came out awesome. Used the meat to make great burritos.

Best pulled pork I've ever had--and I'm a novice chef!
Specifics: 
4lb of pork shoulder (because that is what they had)
1 tsp chili powder 
Coated with red chili pepper
Taco seasoning was Old El Paso "Original"
No water!

Update: This is the first recipe that my boyfriend is asking me to do again!! I am so happy I found it!

This pork was absolutely perfect.  I used a 3-lb. Boston butt roast and I did add the water as directed (usually I don't - the meat will give off a lot of juice on its own) and I used homemade taco seasoning (salt-free) and added about four cloves of crushed garlic, a quartered onion and a dried chili (whole).  When the pork was tender, I turned off the heat and let it sit for about a half hour in the hot liquid, then removed the pork and shredded.  It just melts in your mouth, so moist and tender! I did have a lot of juice leftover, which I discarded as I felt it was too fatty to use as stock.  The pork is tasty, but still a blank canvas, so to speak.  I;m going to add barbecue sauce to some for sandwiches, and use the rest for tacos. YUM!

I didn't add any water.  The meat made it's own liquid.

Nice recipe - needed tweaking.  I used a less fatty loin cut and only added about 1 cup of water.  I turned the loin over half way through cooking.  The meat shredded easily with some light pressure pushing down on it.  You can also shred it in your mixer on the low setting.  Flavor was good, method works but be careful if using fatty cuts as they produce lots of liquid.  This will make the meat bland.

4.5 Stars: I used a pork loin, trimmed of all fat and rubbed two packages of taco seasoning on it.  I only used 1/3 cup water and cooked it for 6 hours.  It made great soft tacos.  Super easy, but be careful with the time or the pork will get mushy.  6 hours was right for a 4 lb. pork loin.
