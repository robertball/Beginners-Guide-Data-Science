Excellent steaks!  Marinated 24hrs (ziploc bag) then pan-fried on med-high for 4 min/side.  Served with Pat's Mushroom Saute - we devoured it all!!

I think the name of the recipe is a little misleading. All of the flavor comes from the steak seasoning, which I love & use often. Dried rosemary & parsley?!?!? Not in this house. That's like an insult to tenderloin! I did however make a compound butter to melt over the top & no, it didn't need it but man, that took it over the top. I was a very bad girl tonight. Don't judge me:o):o):o)

Once again McCormick's gives me what I want. I used some 2" filets for this and I fresh picked and dried the rosemary, myself. Absolutely tops! A-one!

Threw everything in a Ziploc bag and let the steaks marinate that way. Added fresh cracked black pepper and reduced the amount of parsley (used fresh, not dried). My rosemary was not crushed and it turned out fine.
