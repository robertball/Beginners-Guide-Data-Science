OK, I have to be honest here, I really thought this would be rather  bland but after one bite I was sold. Instead of garlic powder and salt I used garlic salt along with the pepper for seasoning. This was so easy to make. Next time I will make extras for those lazy morning breakfast fares.

Deleted sausage and added spices. Don’t overfill before baking or you’ll have a tasty mess to clean up! :)
