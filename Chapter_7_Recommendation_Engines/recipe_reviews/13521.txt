I took a chance and tried this for Thanksgiving, a gigantic leap for somebody like me who grew up with butter-only glaze.  But I was so wonderfully rewarded with the most perfect turkey I’ve ever made.  It’s sweet, but not too sweet, and it really melts in your mouth.  And it beautifully roasts your turkey to a Hollywood Thanksgiving Turkey golden color that almost makes you feel guilty eating it.  The gravy… Oh, so tasty.  It goes great on the turkey, great on mashed potatoes, great sopped up with biscuits, pretty much a wonderful compliment to all of your Thanksgiving sides.  And this makes the most unbelievable stock.  Team this turkey with mixed bread sage sausage stuffing (find the sage sausage by Jimmy Dean), a shot of white wine, and you’ll amaze your family with the fantastic meal you’ve put together.

Here are some basic tips for Thanksgiving turkey though…  It seems that not everybody on this board has been introduced to the wonder that is Oven Bags.  I promise you, this recipe in an Oven Roaster Bag, and you’ll think you’ve died and gone to heaven.  It browns your turkey perfectly, and is much easier than foil.  Cut up 2 onions and throw them in the bag, sprinkle about a tablespoon of flour in the bag and shake until the onions are well coated…  Put in the turkey and this sauce.  Cut some slits in the bag, throw it in the oven, and every 30 – 40 minutes, stick a baster in one of the slits and coat the turkey.  Voila!

I agree with an earlier review... I've made this the past 4 years to rave reviews.  It was the first turkey recipe I tried as a newlywed, and now my mother and grandmother request little old me to make the turkey at the holidays.  What an honor, and all thanks to this amazing recipe!  I, too, serve with the Sausage, Apple & Cranberry stuffing and it's a perfect match.  I also serve with smashed yams with orange juice, Cranberry Sauce Extrordinaire (also from this site) and creamy mashed potatoes... it's a perfect meal!  We love Roasted Butternut Squash soup with rolls and salad the night before.  It's filling, but leaves plenty of room for the Big Day's Menu!  Thanks Ibby!!  (if you're a new cook I highly recommend trying this, it's simple to follow and always turns out)

I've made this recipe the past two Thanksgivings and plan to use it again this year. The turkey always comes out moist, and the gravy has amazing flavor! The only thing I do differently is add a lot more chicken stock at the bottom of the roasting pan (a lot of it evaporates during cooking).

Great recipe!  However I like to play around with things and found that a couple minor changes resulted in the best turkey I have ever eaten (my family agrees).  The sweetness was a welcome change and especially great since my son and my husband both have a huge sweet tooth.  I did add some brown sugar to the maple-butter glaze.  Also, I had a large turkey injector left from thanksgiving and made my own injector butter mixture.  I melted two sticks of butter, added 1/2C apple cider, 1/4C maple syrup and 1/4C brown sugar.  heated over low-med heat until butter was melted and sugar was dissolved then injected all of the mixture into the turkey.  Oh man, it was good!  Oh, and for easy suffing, just buy the boxed stuff and chop up a sweet apple (i use gala) and thaw some frozen cranberries.  Add the fruit to the stuffing when you prepare it, then stuff it all into the bird.  So good, and very easy.

I'm updating my review after several years because I could not have Thanksgiving without this recipe.  The turkey comes out wonderfully every time and the gravy it makes has become the stuff of legend in my family.  The flavor of the turkey is such a hit with friends and family, that I have been asked to bring the turkey to a Thanksgiving celebration at someone else's house!
------------
This didn't make for the juciest turkey, but the bird came out looking like it was right out of a magazine and smelling fabulous.  The gravy I made from the pan juices was literally the best I have ever had EVER!  And everyone else said so too.  Next time I would brine my bird before hand to make it juicy, because that's all it's lacking.

This is by far, the absolute best turkey recipe I have ever made! Everyone loved it for Thanksgiving! I used a little more maple syrup, but it didn't throw anything off. Gravy is to die for!!! The best I've ever had! I've never known a turkey to come out so juicy and perfect! Even stuffy friends who would've rathered "went out for Thanksgiving" (hey! we live in NYC, whadda ya want?) were thoroughly delighted and impressed! I highly suggest to anyone who plans on making a turkey for the holidays to make this! Bon Appeite!

The turkey did come out wonderful. Very moist.I am changing this review to give it 4 stars for the turkey ONLY. The gravy was not a favorite for us.  The gravy was very, very, sweet. I had 2 pkgs of McCormick turkey gravy on hand that I made and added to it, and still very sweet. So I added some white wine to it. That did take some of the sweetness away, but still left it very sweet. If I do make this turkey recipe again, which I probably will. I would not use the drippings for the gravy. I would use store bought or make some ahead of time.

This recipe was tremendous.  The turkey turned out juicy and succulent.  The only thing I did differently was to stuff a bulb of garlic and some sprigs of rosemary in the turkey cavity before roasting. The gravy was some of the best I've ever tasted.

This is an amazing recipe.  I brined my turkey first then used the apple/maple/butter from this recipe to smother it in before putting in the oven.  BTW, for those not living in USA apple cider is apple juice NOT apple cider vinegar! I didn't put veges in tray with turkey but did use the liquid at the end of cooking to make gravy - so delicious. Thanks.

I have made this recipe on two occassions.  Both times I got rave reviews. I never did get the gravy to thicken, but it is incredible just the same. For the second time, I put the Turkey in a roasting bag and it came out even better. I will definately make again.

I would give this 5 stars but the gravy was too sweet for my taste and my guest.  It sucked because we were all looking forward to mashed potatoes with savory gravy but it was more thickened maple syrup.  I will make the turkey like this again but will opt out the gravy.

This was my first year making the bird.  It came out great. Add more vegetables & cut them into larger chunks.  I think I might add potatos next time.  Using the amount of vegetables called for in the recipe, the 2 cups of stock were too much.  At the end I had at least a gallon of drippings even after making the gravy!  I'm going to use that to make a turkey soup.  This bird will now be my flagship bird for years to come & next time I'll add the sausage, cranberry apple stuffing I've heard so much about.  Oh the gravy only had a hint of sweetness to it, perfect for mashed potatos.

The turkey tasted good, though the maple flavor didn't really come through, except for in the gravy made later. That was quite sweet, so my mom added salt and spices to make the gravy more traditional. I made the maple/butter mixture the night before as well, and the next day it was all separated. The butter floated to the top and became hard again in the refridgerator, while the maple, apple juice and spices remained liquids underneath the butter. I had to break it apart, mix it as well as I could, and stuff the hard maple butter brickle under the skin. I rubbed the liquid part all around the outside of the turkey. Decent flavor at the end, just hard to follow through on.

This was the best turkey we ever made! We did make a few little changes. I added brown sugar, cinnamon and maple flavored extract to the butter mixture. I used chopped apples,lemons and onion to stuff the turkey with and covered the outside of the bird with maple cured bacon. WOW!!!! Try this you won't be disappointed!

I have make this my Thanksgiving Turkey recipe every year now and its wonderful. I coarsely chop the veggies that go under the turkey and then save them along with about half the dripping *before making the gravy* and use them for turkey noodle soup with the leftover turkey. The first time I made this, my family kind of turned their noses up, until they tasted it. Now they request this turkey instead of the traditional one we used to make :) Thanks Ibby look up her pumpkin stuffing recipe but make sure you use Ibby's pumpkin bread recipe to make the stuffing, its less sweet but is awesome!

I must start off by saying that I HATE turkey. Simply hate it for one reason...I have never tasted a turkey that wasn't so dry! Until now!!!
I changed the recipe a bit to fit my needs. I omitted the lemon zest all together and doubled everything else that I would have plenty for lots of gravy( expecting the turkey to taste dry!) I also added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar to sweeten the mixture.
I made the mixture the day before thanksgiving and stuck it in the frig. The morning of, I took it out and allowed it to reach room temp.
When it came time to prep the turkey, I added 3/4 cup under the skin. Cooked the turkey 30 min as directed and then brushed on 1 cup of the mixture before lowering the temp and finishing cooking. 
The roasting pan I have has a cover so I didn't cover with foil.
When we removed the turkey it looked like something out of a magazine! I have never seen a more beautiful turkey! Golden brown despite it being covered and not basting.
Every bit of the turkey was soooo moist. Not one piece was dry.
Everyone loved it and I can honestly say this is the first year ever we actually ate left-overs!

This turkey turned out great.  It was moist and the mixture you baste with is good.  The only problem I had was with the veggies you put beside the turkey in the roaster--they dried out, as did the stock I put in with them.  I had to throw it all out.  Fortunately, I was able to use the rest of the marinade in my turkey gravy and it was the best gravy I've ever made.

I have to first off say that this was my first time making a turkey.  Between the flavorful marinade in this recipe, brining the turkey, and the way I cooked it (breast side down and no foil), this was the most moist and flavorful turkey I have ever eaten anywhere!  I pretty much went by the ingredients exactly except I didn't use brandy and I only had margarine instead of butter.  Next time I will make sure to use butter because the sauce didn't set up to well and was a little liquid-y, so when rubbing on the turkey it wanted to drip off.  I also made a solution of apple cider and maple syrup, boiled it down, and used a flavor injector to inject a little more flavor into the meat.  I dont think it was really necessary but I thought what the hay, more flavor is always good!  Next time I wont do that though, because between that and the butter mixture, the gravy was a little sweeter than it should of been.  But it was still excellent!  Thanks for this great flavorful recipe!  When I have the chance at making a turkey again I will for sure use this recipe!

Delicious!  I had the dubious honor of cooking Thanksgiving dinner this year, and my husband declared it to be the best meal EVER.  This turkey was obviously the centerpiece.  I followed the recipe precisely and the flavors were absolutely yummy.  I will say though that I did not detect a maple flavor so much, but regardless I would not hesitate to make this again.

This recipe was absolutely awesome!! My turkey was extremely moist and the drippings made for a great gravy.  I was skepitical abut using the drippings only so I boiled a few turkey necks with onion and celery in a seperate sauce pan and then just added the turkey drippings to it.  Overall this was a huge hit for my Thanksgiving dinner and I will be using it again next year!!

I've made this the last two Thanksgiving and it is DELICIOUS!!  IT cooks up so beautifully and is sweet, but not overly.  Can't wait to Thanksgiving day this year!  I usually brine my turkey the night before.

Very nice subtle flavor! I made this in the slow cooker instead of the oven and it was extremely moist! the gravy was a little sweet so i cut it with store bought turkey gravy to taste and it was perfect.

This was my first time using a recipe to make my Turkey... Normally I just do what I know, don't have a set recipe I just cook how my mother showed me...lol  BUT I have to say that this turned out GREAT!!  Everyone that came over this year for Thanksgiving loved it, and said that it was full of flavor and very juicy... I also used the cranberry, sausage and apple stuffing which also got two thumbs up!

Followed the recipe and it was great.  The skin on the breast was very close to burning,  but that was my own fault.  Really excellent flavor in the meat.  I highly recommend this recipe if you like these flavors.

2 cups of apple cider vinegar is way too much.  The odor was so pungent that we had to open all of the windows. I would make it again but with much less of it.

I give this recipe 4 stars. The baste for the turkey, was EXCELLENT. I just happened to overcook my turkey a bit too much to vouch for the moist raves other reviewers gave this recipe. The gravy was also very easy (my first time making gravy) and had a very good, different taste. I will try this recipe again.

Absolutely Stupendous.

All I did was add a can of chicken broth to the roaster to keep the bird from drying out as there weren't a lot of juices.

The only exceptional thing about this turkey is that it was very moist. Otherwise, it was pretty bland. We couldn't taste the maple or herbs at all.  I won't be making this again.

This recipe is excellent and very easy to follow.  Before today I had never roasted a turkey before, so I was very nervous but it turned out great.  It was very moist and just slightly sweet.  I made this for dinner with my fiance's parents and it had great review all around.  Thanks, Ibby!

I brined the turkey before i baked it... but otherwise i followed the recipe fairly closely. (only gave it four stars because if brining directions had been included it would be even better =D) The turkey was very good, flavorful. The gravey was also very good. DO remember the foil...I had forgotten until AFTER the bird had been a bit burned. Still tasted pretty good though =)


Would definately recomend this recipe. My other friend made it once and it was FANTASTIC.

This is the best turkey I have ever had. It actually had an interesting flavor! I was so tired of putting all kinds of spices, etc. on the turkey and having it taste just like plain old turkey. I took your advice and stuffed it with cranberry, apple, sausage stuffing (I found an awesome recipe on this site submitted by Stacy M. Polcyn) I will definately make this again!! thank you so much for such a great recipe!

I loved this recipe! We used an injector to get more of the flavor in and baked it in a turkey bag. It was so moist and the flavor was amazing!

Not a winner.    Skin burnt almost immediately and the breast was too dry while the back was almost undercooked, this with an UNSTUFFED turkey.  Could not taste any of the maple flavouring.   Thank you, Ibby, for sharing this recipe, but I feel that it was too much effort for very disappointing results.  Next time I will be trying the brine recipe I saw in my local paper last week but didn't use this year in favour of this one.

This made the most delicious, moist turkey and by far the best gravy I have ever tasted. Definitely the best gravy I have ever made and it was SO easy!!

This year was my second time making this turkey, and it was delicious as usual. The turkey is moist but most important, it makes the best gravy in the world. I wish I had put more liquid in the bottom this year because we practically drank the gravy!

Last year was my first time cooking for thanksgiving and I wanted to try something different since my familys turkey always seemed a little dry....boy was everyone impressed this year. We loved this recipe and the gravy was phenomenal! I'm so happy I took a chance and tried this recipe. This is going to be our classic thanksgiving turkey from now on. Thanks for sharing!

To start with this is my first review. I have been using recipes from this site for years and finally found one I truly had to comment on. My cooking experience is minimal, I'm just past using measuring cups for everything. 
   This Turkey was outstanding I didn't make the gravy but followed the Turkey recipe to the T, the only change I made was to brine the Turkey the night before. This is definitely a keeper

Simply amazing recipe! Instead of using the fresh marjoram and thyme, I used poultry seasoning and it worked fine. For the gravy, I tweaked it to have more like 4 cups and used only about 2 tbsp of the maple butter mix so it wasn't too sweet. I added some poultry seasoning to the gravy instead of the bay leaf and brandy. It got rave reviews in my household and the turkey cam out perfectly moist and flavorful. It's going to be a new holiday tradition!

This was not a keeper for me.  I loved the way the apple cider butter tasted, but it made my turkey brown so fast that the skin actually turned black and I had to cover completely with foil which then steamed it.  I think the temperature was too high as my turkey was over cooked too.  Although the gravy was delicious, I could not taste the maple butter on my meat at all.

This was a good, and different way to roast a turkey.  I liked the sweetness of the gravy, but I would have preferred a little less sweetness.  Don't get me wrong though, it was still very good and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  The cider/maple syrup made the skin brown nicely.  I stuffed the cavity with about 10 garlic cloves and a very small apple, sliced.  After roasting, there was 6 cups of drippings left in my pan!!  So it took a while to thicken the gravy; I had to add more flour w/a water paste.  Good turkey, thanks for the recipe!

I have used this very recipe for the past 4 years.  I am starting my Thanksgiving planning early and thought I would drop in to thank Ibby for her fabulous recipe!!  My family loves it so much, we have adpoted it into our family as our own.  Each year before "Amen", I give a special little shout out to Ibby and thank her for sharing her recipe.  Happy Thanksgiving!!!

I made my Thanksgiving turkey with this recipe this year. The recipe for the maple butter was plenty to cook my 20 pound bird. The taste was sweet, but not overpoweringly maple. It received rave reviews from all of my guests, all who said it was the best turkey they'd gotten to eat! 

My maple gravy came out a bit too fatty, but cooling it in the fridge and skimming it made it perfect for potatoes, next-day sandwiches, and everything in between.

The carcass also produced a very nice flavored stock for soups and stews!

This was a delightful new flavor for our Thanksgiving turkey. The meat came out juicy, sweet, and tender. Just be sure to cover the bird in tinfoil while in the oven - the added sugars can scald the surface. We found making a tent out of the foil we extremely  helpful and kept the bird succulant! Brilliant! Deserving of 5 stars!

This was my first year serving Thanksgiving dinner as well as my first attempt at roasting a turkey. All in all it came out O.K. The breast meat did come out too dry but the dark meat was moist and delicious. I goofed a little bit with the gravy though. I forget to save the maple butter mixture, so, I made a paste out of 1/4 cup of the broth left in the pan and made a gravy with that. It was pretty good. Overall, even though the white meat came out too dry this went over pretty well! Especially for a first timer!

This is a great recipe.  I was looking for something that would add a little more flavor into the meat of the bird - and this recipe measures up to that.  We'll definately make this again!

Wow!  Best recipe to impress and this is so good I want to marry it!  It has become my stand by.  Do not omit the veggies as they are key.  In making a gravy, I puree some of the carrots, etc. and include them in the stock.  It just adds a depth that is unbeatable.

I have been making this recipe since 2002 every year for Thanksgiving since I found it and it is always a hit.  It's printed in our family cookbook and I adore it and save it just for TG.  This is by far the best turkey recipe I have ever had and once you try it, you'll never go back to making turkey any other way again.  For variations, try adding garlic and make sure you carefully pull the skin away from the entire turkey and not just the legs.  It makes a difference.

I've make this recipe a couple years in a row now and every year it gets better and better.  You have to make the gravy also.  It totally completes the dish.
Update: 11/19/16: I have made this turkey every year for probably 10 years now. My husband will not allow me to make anything else. I usually follow the recipe but make extra butter/maple marinade. It allows for extra rich flavorful gravy. I recommend making the butter a few days ahead of time. Saves a lot of time on turkey day.

excellent. Well worth the effort for a nice moist and mellow flavor. A great switch from the usual boring bland bird.

I tired this recipe for Thanksgiving this year..and it was WONDERFUL. I changed it a bit because I make turkey breast instead of a whole turkey. I use the baste to make gravy and to add to my stuffing. My family loved it so much we had the same for Christmas. This will be used many times in my kitchen!

This always turns out wonderfully.  I don't know that the turkey itself picks up a lot of the maple flavor, but the resulting gravy is wonderful...  and I don't typically eat gravy.

I made this for my family when they came out for Thanksgiving.  It was good.  I would suggest making the apple butter a day or two ahead of the big turkey day. It will give it more time to "set".  Otherwise very good recipe.  Moist and delicious!!

This was my first turkey, and it got rave reviews. It was very moist, but I didn't think it tasted very maple-y (except the skin). I liked the addition of the lemon zest (I read in some reviews that some didn't care for it, but I liked it). The gravy was outstanding - I included the apple brandy in mine.

i'd give this high marks for looking good, and staying moist, but lower ones for taste.  All the "extra's " kind of take points away from the healthiness of a turkey. Makes great stock, though.

The turkey smelled wonderful while cooking but it came out a little dry (and I cooked it less time than the recipe said) and I felt that all the butter that was used in the syrup glaze just didn't add that much more flavor to the turkey.  The recipe said to cook the turkey to 180 degrees.  Other recipes for roast turkey say between 170-175 degrees.  Next time I would definately cook it less time.

The turkey was delicious and wonderfully moist but the gravy was awful - way too sweet and nobody touched it.  This recipe is a bit time consuming so any steps you can do a day in advance would be a good idea.

What an excellent way to roast a turkey! So flavorful! The breat meat was very moist and juicy and the carrots picked up so much of the maple butter flavor! (I only used carrots because we don't like onions and celery.) I will use this recipe again and again and again!

I made this for the second time this year. I really like it!!! It's pretty time consuming & the ingredients are expensive. But I enjoy making it because it is so different. The gravy is very rich. I usually cut up the turkey and pour the gravy over all of it. Then I serve a different gravy along side the potatoes.

It was good, really good, and moist. Seemed to cook faster too. The syrup made my stuffing taste so different. :) Thanks.

This made an excellent bird! It was my first turkey ever and I got rave reviews from my guests at Thanksgiving. In fact, from the traditional turkey roasters, I got compliments that this was their best turkey ever. Quite good! I was afraid it wouldn't turn out, but boy did it ever! The gravy was outstanding as well!

Good flavor, but you do have to watch carefully that it doesn't over-brown, even covered.  Not as much cider flavor as I was expecting, and maybe a little too much lemon for my taste.  Maybe adding some apple to the veggies would help?

I found that this won't do much for your turkey but gives the gravy a different twist. When carving the turkey up, I tried a piece without anything added and really didn't notice the difference I was expecting. I can't say that I would go to all this work next year, I really wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be. The Cranbeery,sausage and apple stuffing yes, this no.

A different twist on the typical Roast Turkey. The taste was very good, the meat was extremely moist which was very nice.  The important part of this recipe to definitely cook down the vinegar and syrup until it reaches the 1/2 cup or it will not solidify completely making it more liquidy than a butter consistency when you rub it under the skin and on top.

Good but not great, although very moist. I didn't make the gravy so this may account for the lack of amazing taste.  A bit too much lemon in breast meat for some in the family.

Love it! Easy to make with simple ingredients. I made it in advance so and worked out great. Simply delicious. I am thinking about using the apple cider/syrup combo in other recipes or as a cake glaze!

This turkey was very tasty, moist and flavorful. I tried it before Thanksgiving to see if I wanted to change my regular recipe. While it was good, it was a little sweet for me. I prefer a more savory flavor to my gravy though. Thanks for a great recipe, I will certainly use it again, just not for the big day this year.

Without a doubt the best turkey I've ever made!!  And I've made a lot of turkeys!  Skin was super crispy & meat was soooo moist.  Yum!  This was the first time I've brined & would highly recommend it.  Makes a huge difference.  I was worried that the gravy would be too sweet cuz we like it on our mashed potatoes, but it wasn't.  It was savory.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  Will make it this way every year.

Very good recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The turkey was very juicy and flavorful.  The gravy has a sweet taste that I found very tasty and a nice change from traditional turkey gravy.  I made the maple syrup butter the night before and it was very easy to work with.

Made my first thanksgiving dinner a SMASHING success.  Friends are still raving about it (10 months later).  This year I'm making Christmas dinner for our families, guess what I'll be making.  Definately use the Cranberry, sausage and apple stuffing.  I cooked half inside the bird and half outside.  Makes for an interesting contrast.

Sexy beautiful color coming out of the oven and made the whole house smell incredible which could have upped our expectations of the flavor.  Which we found lovely, but very mild and easily lost.

It was good, but not worth the work.  The gravy turned out nice, and it smelled really good while cooking, but I didn't find you could taste the maple or any of the ingredients in the actual turkey. I won't be making this again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year and omg it was amazing! The gravy had the best flavor and it went so well with my sausage cornbread stuffing and garlic mashed potatoes. I will never use another recipe for turkey ever again! This one is definitely a keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly, except for taking one reviewers suggestion to use a bag. This was my first bag experience. Turkey was moist and cooked 1 hour quicker than the recipe or the turkey said it would and it was stuffed, so if you use a bag, keep an eye on your bird. I could taste the maple flavor just on the very top pieces of the breast. The gravy was somewhat sweet but I really think it was the lemon zest that was problematic. I would cut that in half as it really came through, and with the sweetness, the gravy had a faint lemon dessert flavor we did not care for. Otherwise good, moist turkey.

I made this for thanksgiving 2011 and my family was adamant that I would be making this every year whether I host or not! It was absolutely fabulous and I will make this recipe every year. 
Update: 5 years later and I am still making this every time I host!

I have to first off say that this was my first time making a turkey.  Between the flavorful marinade in this recipe, brining the turkey, and the way I cooked it (breast side down and no foil), this was the most moist and flavorful turkey I have ever eaten anywhere!  I pretty much went by the ingredients exactly except I didn't use brandy and I only had margarine instead of butter.  Next time I will make sure to use butter because the sauce didn't set up to well and was a little liquid-y, so when rubbing on the turkey it wanted to drip off.  I also made a solution of apple cider and maple syrup, boiled it down, and used a flavor injector to inject a little more flavor into the meat.  I dont think it was really necessary but I thought what the hay, more flavor is always good!  Next time I wont do that though, because between that and the butter mixture, the gravy was a little sweeter than it should of been.  But it was still excellent!  Thanks for this great flavorful recipe!  When I have the chance at making a turkey again I will for sure use this recipe!

This will be the 3rd year that I will making this recipe.  I "suggested" trying another turkey and my husband said no.  He wanted the "maple" turkey.  I used this recipe when I made my first turkey and it is a little work, but so worth it.  This year I will try brining my turkey first... to see if it helps with the juicyness.

I never received so many compliments!!  Not only did this recipe produce the moistest turkey I've ever had, but the meat was so flavorful!!  Be careful when making the syrup, I burned the first batch because I didn't watch it close enough.  Also, use fresh herbs.  It really makes a difference!  Thanks for sharing Ibby!

This is so delicious! The turkey comes out nice and juicy with great flavor. The gravy made at the end is wonderful. It's a bit of a shock as it's kind of sweet, but still amazing.

We love this and make it every year!  One question though, why can you only make the cider/syrup recipes up to 2 days before?  Would love to get an early jump on this!

Has anyone tried brining their turkey in this and frying it? or injecting? I really want to try this, but with a fried turkey.

Best turkey I have ever made. Thought it was going to be either too sweet or to vinegar tasting. It wasn't. Very flavorful. My only warning is when you reduce the vinegar it will smell up the whole house. I didn't mind but my husband was running around opening doors and windows. I little dramatic if you ask me. Next time I'll do that part when he is not home.

I made this turkey as my first turkey two years ago for my fiance's family. Best turkey we ever had. Thank you so much! 

I did this as a three day process to make it perfect.
Day 1-i defrosted the turkey all night in the fridge
Day 2-I brined the meat in a large soup pot with water and all the seasonings listed, including slices of lemon and orange. I then carefully put the pot in a large garbage bag so that nothing got inside, and left it in the garage since it was the coldest place at the time. Overnight.
Day 3-Turkey day! I actually did a plaid pattern with bacon ontop just for the heck of it. I basted every 15 minutes until the last 45 minutes. I covered with aluminum foil at this point and allowed it to cook.

Didnt do the gravy, wasnt a master chef yet, well...that year, anyway. I messed it up and it came out lumpy. was delish though!

Added a quartered Apple to the cavity, but pretty much followed the recipe. This ended up fantastic!!!! Bird was super juicy, skin was crispy and delicious. Would definitely make again. Ooo I also cooked it for the first hour breast down.

Best gravy I've ever had!  This recipe is fantastic.  I made the syrup/butter the night before and it remained pretty runny.  The turkey stayed moist - I use an oven bag so the turkey itself was good but not noticeably more moist than normal.  However the gravy was amazing and we all wanted to drink it!!!  I didn't remove the veggies at the end, just some of the fat and made the gravy right in the roaster.  Didn't add more thyme and forgot the bay leaf but it was still terrific.  Loved the cooked vegetables in it.  Also I chopped up one apple and the leftover lemon from zesting and put inside the turkey for some extra flavor.  Definitely a winner!

Prepared this recipe twice, the first time prepared as directed and the turkey browned too quickly. The second time I left the foil on the whole time and it browned beautifully. Both times the turkey and gravy tasted fantastic. Many comments on how juicy it was. I'll be using it again next Turkey time.

I found this recipe Thanksgiving morning.  It was easy and a big hit. My husband said it was one of the best turkeys he has ever had.  Very moist and favorful.  We used a fresh free range turkey.  Yummy! We didn't even have that much leftover.

Made this for Thanksgiving. It turned out very tender and lovely. I really didn't detect much of a maple flavor, but it just turned out very nice. I did brine the turkey the night before from a citrus brine recipe from this site...
I know that makes a big difference in the juciness of the bird.
I do recommend this and will likely do the same thing this Christmas.

This was simply the best turkey.  Be careful not to leave in the 400 degree oven any longer than suggested.  It will brown easily with this sauce.

So moist and flavorful! I didn't save the extra maple mix for gravy, I poured it on the white meat after it was carved. This is the best turkey I have ever made. Try it with a cranberry sauce made with orange juice and orange zest. The citrus flavors compliment each other prefectly!

First time making turkey--it was good for first time. it cooked under 3 hours  and it was a 14 lb. turkey--don't know what's up with  that. the maple syrup taste didn't really get through..i actually couldn't taste it at all. Next time, ill try another recipe, but easy for first try!

I know I'm out of sync with everyone else but I think I'll go back to my tried and true turkey recipe for Christmas.  This was OK but not what we were expecting.  It was jucy and sweet, but neither my husband or myself really enjoyed a "sweet" gravy on our mashed potatoes.

This was without a doubt the best turkey I have ever had!  It was a little bit of work (what turkey isn't) but well worth it.  My house smelled fabulous for days!

My first attempt at preparing the WHOLE Thanksgiving meal. What a success! The sweet maple flavor married beautifully with the comforting thymemarjoram - my house smelled wonderful for days! Being able to prepare butter portion of the recipe in advance helped a lot. I have returned the next year to repeat this amazing recipe!! Thank you so much to the contributor!!!

Good recipe. This was a trial run last week for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. I had never thought of roasting the vegetables with the turkey. But, it makes perfect sense, and it worked very well. There was no problem with the maple butter separating. . . I think the key is making sure to cook the syrup/cider mixture for the full time (making sure it fully reduces).  I removed the foil for the last 15 minutes (or so) of cooking, and this gave the bird the coveted red-brown, glistening skin. It was beautiful. The gravy that this recipe made wasn't a big hit. It wasn't terrible, but I don't think we can be sold on the sweetness, albeit slight.  I may have to commit the unpardonable and serve store-bought. . .  at any rate, I will definitely be using this recipe for Thanksgiving in a couple of weeks.

Delicious recipe. Made this with an 18-pound turkey, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I really had to tend to it. You need to ensure that foil is used the entire time and/or the heat reduced for all periods and the time lengthened. The skin was VERY dark, but not burnt. The butter underneath has both pros and cons in that it gives it the potential to burn, but also keeps it tender. The breast meat was extremely juicy and tender. Gravy was great...I love sweeter gravies with maple and the like, so this was perfect.

i try to do our thanksgiving turkey different every year and this year i chose this recipe coz i had previously tried it with chicken and it was great. i soaked the turkey in brine water overnight so i think that accounted for the very moist meat.
