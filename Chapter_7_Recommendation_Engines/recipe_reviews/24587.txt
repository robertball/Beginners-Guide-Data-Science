This is fantastic! I love the black beans in place of refried. I have made this several times, and it was the hit of every party - everyone requests it now. In place of mixing the cut avocados with the salsa, I actually cut thin slices and laid them out on top of the dip to make it look extra appetizing.

I absolutely love this seven-layer dip!  It was the first one I've ever made, and absolutely everyone loved it...I've never had so many people ask me for a recipe!

This recipe is the classic. It was scrumptious and had six adults and several small children hovering over it until it was gone....

I've been using this recipe for years, and it always disappears fast, whether at a gathering of high school or college students, a group of friends, or just a family dinner, where it's one of the few vegetarian meals the kids will eat.  I generally leave out the avocado, the chiles, and the olives and if you use hot salsa, the recipe tastes fine without the chiles.  I don't miss the avocado or the olives either, but that's really a matter of taste.

I liked this, but not as much as I thought I would. I think I would use less lettuce next time, and more beans (maybe even the more traditional refried beans, instead of the black beans), and more avocado and cheese. The flavors were great, though - especially the fresh jalapenos and cilantro.

This is a great recipe for football games.  I leave out the sour cream because I don't like it and add guacamole as a substitute.

Was really good!  I thought I had black olives but didn't, so I didn't use it, but I will make sure to have them next time around.  Was soooo very tastey and fun!

Made this for a carry in at work and everyone loved it. I was in a rush making it and forgot the avocado and cheese, but they still liked it. I couldn't find the red chile peppers so I left those out. Will make this again with the cheese and avocado. Very good!!!!!
