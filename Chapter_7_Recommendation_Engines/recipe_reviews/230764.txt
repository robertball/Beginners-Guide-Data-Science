YUM!  I am so glad I made this.  I cut the chili paste to two large teaspoons instead of Tablespoons - figured that I could add more if needed but it was just perfect for us.  I used a 10 oz package of dry yakisoba noodles and it was perfect.  I don't really understand the recipe calling for 2 lbs cooked noodles - none the less the 10 oz package was just the right amount.  Hubby says I can make this every week.  One of the best, if not the best Asian dishes I have ever made. Delicious!

This was delicious but WAY too salty and I didn't even add the tablespoon of salt to the vegetables that it called for!  Next time I am going to cut the soy sauce in half too.  That being said it was REALLY good and I will make it often cutting out the saltiness!

This is awesome! I've made it twice in the last two weeks. Couldn't find Yakisoba noodles so I used thick spaghetti noodles...turned out great!

Made this for the first time tonight.  It was actually my first time cooking with sesame oil, and it really made it wonderful. 

Like another reviewer, I used low-sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt with the vegetables, and we thought it was just the right amount of saltiness.  However, we don't do a ton of salt in our house, so your preferences may vary. 

I scaled back the amount of chili paste (I actually used Thai Kitchen Red Curry paste because it's what I could find...it was great, but I am going to check out my options next time I'm at the Asian market).  Next time, assuming I use the same paste, I'm adding the full 2T because it was still very mild the way I did it this time (approx 1/3-1/2 T). 

I also used soba noodles instead of yakisoba noodles, which are actually different.  But I had them and I like them...I thought they worked just fine in this recipe.  Based on my past experiences cooking with soba noodles, I added them at the end and just cooked until they were heated through.  Otherwise, soba noodles can get too soft.  If anyone else uses soba noodles, the ~10 oz pkg (3 bundles of the kind I bought) is plenty of noodles. 

Really delicious recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this last night using the ingredients we had at home. I had to substitute the chili paste with red curry paste and the noodles with thin thai noodles, but it was still very delicious! A keeper recipe for sure!

Thought this was a great recipe! I used the reduced soy sauce as the other reviews had said, and that was good. Instead of chopping up those vegetables, I just used a pack of tri-color coleslaw mix. You could add onions if desired. It turned out great!

Family loved this, I reduced soy sauce per reviews and all I had was the chili paste with seeds so I reduced that by 1/2 and it was still spicy.  Added zuchinni in place of onion because I was out of onion.  Will make again and add more veggies, the cabbage wilts and softens more than expected - add it last.

Great recipe. The only change we did, was to only add a tablespoon of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce instead of the Asian Style Chili Paste. Just enough kick. Enjoyed it a lot.

Great recipe! I created an account just so I could review this. I made it on a whim and now it has entered into my regular rotation of dinners. It is easy, healthy, and delicious. I use whatever vegetables I have on hand, which have included sugar snap peas,carrots, edamame, and peas. Sometimes I add scrambled egg. I add a little less soy sauce than the recipe calls for, since as other reviewers noted, it can turn out a little too salty. I use sriracha sauce for the chili paste and the flavor is amazing. I usually drizzle a little extra sesame oil on the soba noodles to keep them from getting sticky and to add a little more flavor.

This was really tasty. I added zucchini and omitted the carrots because I didn't have any and needed to use up the zucchini. The chicken on it's own had a really nice flavor. Next time I will add a whole head of cabbage and double the sauce, but we will be making it again.

Loved it!  Followed recipe except I wasn't sure what the chile paste was.....I used chinese garlic chile paste, maybe that is the same thing......I'm not sure.  It was spicy but good.  Instead of match sticking the carrots I just shaved it with my veggie peeler.  I used spaghetti noodles instead.

I cooked the veggies longer so the would be soft. Also, added some sauce to the whole mixture at the end. 1 tbs of sesame oil, 1/4 of sugar, 1/3 soy sauce and 1 cup of water. Sauce can be adjusted to personal taste.

My family really like this and voted to put it in the "rotation." I didn't add the salt as others suggested. Husband remarked that it is really good the next day. Double the recipe!

This was my first time making Yakisoba and I'm happy with the results. I followed the recipe exactly and I just wish it had a little more flavor. The chicken was perfect but the sauce wasn't quite strong enough to flavor all of the vegetables and noodles. I'll definitely be making it again though!

I couldn't find yakisoba noodles so I used rice noodles. Other than that followed recipe exactly.  I loved it. Just enough spice for me.

Just made this (no adjustments to the recipe) and loved it! We lived in Japan and this was the real deal. Will make again and again!

This was so good! The first time I pretty much followed the recipe with exception to the salt and I thought is was a little too salty so the next time I used low sodium soy sauce. Perfect! You can through any kind of veggie in there, they all work. I also warmed the noodles up in the microwave before tossing them in. Good stuff, this recipes going into my recipe box!

This recipe is as close as it gets to a little Japanese shop we used to go to when we lived in Japan. We love it. Didn't change anything.

Super easy and super delicious.  This is a great way to use left over meat.  I used a little less of the chile sauce than the recipe called for (about 1 1/2 Tbs), and used low sodium soy sauce.  It was perfect.  This just became a "regular" in my house!

This is a great basic chicken yakisoba. I substituted the onion for broccoli crowns for some vibrant colour and more crunch. I also didn't have soba noodles so I used chow mein noodles instead. I like my dishes spicy so I put in 3 tablespoons of chili garlic sauce/ paste from  Huy Fong Foods Inc. (the one with a green lid). Delicious!

My family really liked this, as did I. I was excited to find yakisoba noodles in my regular grocery store. Anyway, I followed advice of other reviewers and did not add the tablespoon of salt and decreased the soy sauce (used reduced sodium) a bit. It was still plenty salty. I added only one tablespoon of the chili paste and it was perfect. My husband told me to put this "in the rotation." I also added bean sprouts. Yum.

This dish is very tasty.  However, if you use the asian style chili paste, use caution.  That stuff is really HOT!  I smelled it first before I used it and it smelled hot so I only used 1-1/4 tablespoons instead of 2.  WOW, I could have used only 1/2 teaspoon and I'm sure it would have been plenty.  The flavor was very good and the noodles were delicious.

This was really good, just as good as take out... I added a can of LaChoy stir fry vegetables (because of my love of water chestnuts and bamboo that comes in a takeout order)... left out the salt.. soy sauce is salty enough. Very good! I think the seasame oil and the chili paste is what gives it that authentic flavor that I also seemed to be missing when attempting this kind of thing before. Thanks!

Sorry, but it was VERY bland!  I was really looking forward to trying this but was very disappointed...ended up smothering it in sweet Thai chili sauce just to get some flavor!

LOVED this, and it makes great leftovers. I didn't have the noodles it called for, so I used 1 pound of linguini noodles (I didn't half the rest of the recipe.) and it turned out great. It is a bit spicy so next time I might ease up on the chili paste. Oh and I didn't use as much salt because I used regular soy sauce. This tastes just like what I get at Chinese restaurants. Thank you Thank you!

This was Delish!  I took the advice I read from one of the reviewers and reduced the sesame oil to 1 tsp, and found that gave it plenty of sesame flavour.  Also, I did not find yakisoba noodles, so I used half a package of rice vermicelli - that worked well.  I also love how quickly and easily this dish comes together.  Definitely going to be making this often.

Awesome.  I used extra chicken and less noodles than called for.  I also cut the added salt since I thought adding the soy sauce would have enough, especially after reading some other reviews of the dish being too salty.  I came across this recipe when looking for something to do with a head of cabbage after recently already having halushki and halupki, so looking for something different.  It was a hit and I'll surely be making it again.

Little to no salt needed.  1/2 to 3/4 of called for chili paste.  Good!

Made it as written and I found it to be too salty.  It was also a little too spicy.  Next time I make this, I will omit the salt and use only one tablespoon of the chile paste.

it's a good recipe, a bit salty and I didn't add salt. so when you are going to buy soy sauce get the  sodium less version.  other than that I followed the recipe and it came out good.

Love it! Used sweet chile sauce in place of the paste. Like many others, I used low sodium soy sauce and only  half the amount. Will be making it many more times!

This recipe is really flavorful. Grade A to me! I've seen a reviewer say it's very bland, and yet another says it's too salty. It's best to adjust the sodium and spiciness to your taste. I reduced the sodium on mine.

The recipe is good.  With soy sauce and lots of salt gave it a very salty flavor.  And I like salt.  However, after a day in the fridge it wasn't as bad.  I would recommend cutting the salt down though.  The taste was very flavorful, and it's easy to make without a wok.  So, we will be making this again.

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't have any cabbage, so I julienned a zucchini and yellow squash to take its place.  I also added some sliced mushrooms and minced about a half tablespoon of ginger, leaving off the pickled ginger garnish at the finish.    Cut the chili paste in half (my husband would like even less).  When it was done it didn't seem quite there to me, so like someone else, I added about 1/4 C. sweet chili sauce and that really seemed to elevate it the flavor to where I was really pretty happy with it.  

2nd time I made it added  about 1/3  C. cilantro and leftover corn.  Really good!

Yummy dinner! Never expected it would turn out to be really good. My partner loves it and even packed it for his lunch the next day. I used Hookien noodles since I couldn’t find any yakisoba at the store. I must say, it was indeed a good substitute. Also, to save up time, I used packed coleslaw veggies  :) and I didn’t use the regular soy sauce but low sodium soy sauce instead. Will definitely cook it again!

I didn’t have the right amount of soy sauce on hand but I had half. I don’t know what it would’ve tasted like if I had the right amount but I sure loved the spice! I loved the recipe. I substituted chicken breast with chicken thighs bc it’s more tender.

It's alright.  A bit lacking in depth of flavor. After tasting it I added a few drops of fish sauce and a few drops of dark soy sauce with mushroom flavor. Maybe I would add an Asian seasoning or some ginger to give it more flavor.

Made this one a few times now. It's pretty salty, so I skipped the tablespoon of salt and used a smaller amount of reduced sodium soy sauce - but a delicious recipe that even I haven't been able to ruin.

Fabulous! I couldn’t find Yakisoba noodles so I used egg noodles. I also didn’t use any salt as I felt there was enough with the soya sauce. Will definitely be making this again!

Way, way too salty! It was practically inedible. If I make it again, I would definitely cut the soy sauce in half and use a low sodium soy sauce.

I doubled the recipe, but still only used 2 lb of pasta, and only stirred in about half of it!!! It was a TON of pasta. And also only used 3 tablespoons of chili paste and it definitely had a bite, but very good still. Excellent dish all the way around. Very quick if the chicken is cooked and veggies are cut (you could almost use a prepackaged Cole slaw mix for quickness.)

I liked the recipe . Family thought it was too spicy . I would cut back on the chili paste next time. Noodle qty was way to much . I think 6oz would been better . 4 stars because the whole extra bunch of noodles I had leftover. 5 stars for the flavor and cabbage use .

I changed the canola oil to extra virgin olive oil. I used fettuccine noodles instead  
of Japanese noodles. I went out of my way (to Walmart actually) to buy the sesame oil, and Asian Chile. It came out great, in fact I thought it was delicious. I did put a little extra sesame oil (1 t) and chile (1/2 t). After cooking the noodles I let them cool before mixing into the pan. I saw the video several times before I tried it. So I did my best to copy it.

Very good I read the reviews about being too salty so we use low sodium soy sauce. Great flavor

I thought the soy sauce and salt were just right. However I made a few changes. First, I didn’t have a skillet large enough to hold all that cabbage, so I used about 1/3 a head of cabbage.                                                   Second, I forgot to buy the Asian style chili sauce so I made some with chili powder+ ginger paste + 2 pinches of cumin.              Third, I used 2/3 white onion with 4 diagonally sliced green onions for a difference in texture, color, & flavor.                                                      I really enjoyed the aromas from this recipe. Do Note: you should start boiling the water and start cooking the noodles first.

This was very good, but I agree it is too salty, even without the T of salt (which I did not add).  I will cut soy sauce in half next time. I originally thought it was a lot of cabbage for the recipe, but it really is not--don't cut back on the cabbage!  I also added a package of fresh bean sprouts to the leftovers (cooked them first), and I think they will fit in nicely.  I used buckwheat soba noodles, and the flavors were strong enough to handle the buckwheat, as long as you use a good hot Asian chile sauce.  .

Made without the carrots as I don't like cooked carrots.  Added extra spice after it was done for those who like it super spicy.  A winning dish in my house!

would have given a 5 star but came out a little salty and I never even saw the part about adding tablespoon of salt  to vegetables. The 8 oz. noodles enough for 2 people plus leftovers for one more serving. 2 LBS noodles would feed an army and then not enough chicken. I also added some pea pods for some additional color. Yum.

I made this with red pepper instead of carrots.  I agree with the reviewer that you only need 8-12 ounces of noodles (I used Lo Mein because I couldn’t find the other).  I also only used 1 Tablespoon of chili paste and it was just right for us.  I agree that you should add the cabbage last so it doesn’t get too wilty.

I thought this recipe was really yummy but it was a little spicy for my kids so keep that in mind.  Also, the noodle quantity seemed way off compared to the other ingredients so I doubled everything  but the noodles.  Next time I will double everything and cut the noodles to 1.5 lbs. Also, i used linguini and it worked great.

This was very tasty, but next time I would reduce the noodles, maybe by a third or perhaps even by half.  I also added half a red pepper because I had it on hand.  I think it was a nice addition.

Tasty, but not quite a traditional Yaki Soba recipe. This is more of what I would call a Japanese fusion recipe as it draws from Japanese heritage but the techniques and flavors are imparted from the broader spectrum of Asian cooking.

This was a little spicy for my family. It has a very good flavor. I doubled the recipe but after finding the first batch was pretty spicy, I used 1T Siracha and 1T honey in the 2nd batch. The honey tempered the heat, but there  was still a nice kick. Didn't have onions, so I used Zuchinni instead. Also used purple cabbage. Husband didn't care for it but the kids said it was worth making again. It was quick to make after pre-chopping everything earlier in the day. I couldn't find Yakisoba noodles so I used a 10 oz pkg of Udon. Also used Siracha Sauce in place of Asian Chile Paste.

This is one of the best things I have ever made.  And easy to make. I used a different noodle and I didnt add oil to the cabbage prep bc calories, but this still ended up a good healthy meal I would serve to other people.

This meal was great! A better, healthier option for Chinese food, yet still unique.  And everybody went back for seconds! I reccomend not putting the salt into your recipe, since it already calls for a lot of soy sauce. Overall, 5 stars the whole way. Great addition to the recipe book!

I love this! I made it for myself and a group of 5 big guys, and the "4" servings was enough to fill everyone up, and still have leftovers! Everyone devoured it like it was their first meal lol. Making it again for myself tonight for dinner :)

This was really good added snap peas and mushrooms used shanghai noodles. Other then that followed the receipt as written did not find it too salty at all. Delicious!

Pretty good!  I omitted the extra salt AND used reduced sodium soy sauce but still found it a bit salty so I used a little bit of water and hoisin sauce to cut the saltiness and it turned out pretty good!  I used onions and cabbage for the veggies (wish I had carrots on hand!) and this was great.

I'd definitely make this again. Easy to alter with adding or subtracting veggies (I added bean sprouts and broccoli), as well as some rice vinegar to cut the saltiness of the soy sauce. Next time I would cook the noodles right before adding it to the mixture as the noodles only take 3 mins after the water boils, otherwise, it all congeals together as you drain it and set it aside.

I've made this recipe multiple times and I quite enjoy it.  I do adjust the soy sauce amount but it's mostly just something I eyeball.  What makes this recipe great is that you can omit and add vegetables to your own tastes and what is on hand.  I've added snow peas and edamame at different times and it's always come out great.  This is a great starter recipe that you can make as is or use as a jumping off point to let your creativity go as far as what ingredients you want and what you don't.  It's a good no fail recipe!

Wooooooooweeeeeeooooooo!! Added minced ginger when I threw in the Sriracha sauce to the chicken. Added sliced mushrooms. Threw in mung bean sprouts at the very end with some sliced green onions. Added a touch of dashi, black pepper, and splash of worcestershire. Topped off with toasted sesame seeds. Next time I will cut the salt or leave it out altogether. Skuz.

Like many others have said, this recipe is insanely salty if made to the letter. I used about half of a Tablespoon and it was still too much. Next time I will probably try omitting the salt altogether. I made this with Pork instead of Chicken and it tasted great other than the overboard salt level.

I omitted the additional salt. It was still so salty that it was very nearly inedible. I also didn't care for the flavor the sesame oil added.

Very, very good. We used low sodium soy sauce, omitted the extra salt, and substituted sriracha sauce for the chile paste (had it on hand). I'm so glad I read reviews before making--it would have been far too salty and spicy for us as written!

Great recipe...I went with others claiming that it was too salty and used the low sodium soy sauce instead.  Omitted the extra salt and it was delicious.  Thanks...I've passed this recipe on to several people since I've tried it.  My husband couldn't stop talking about this dish.

Tasty, quick and versatile. Adjust soy sauce and chili paste to your liking (I halved them and found it very flavorful). Add the cabbage last because it wilts quickly. Serve with Sriracha and grated ginger if you want more kick. We've got small kids so I kept the spicy to a minimum during cooking and doctored some for me and the hubby afterward. Home run. No leftovers.

Not a bad recipe. I used a bit less soy sauce then the recipe calls for. Also I used siracha sauce for the chili paste and a sweet chili sauce also that I found that you mostly use for dipping in asian eggrolls. I added about a tablespoon and a half of hoisin sauce. It adds good flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was too salty. My family liked it and I will absolutely make it again but will omit the 1 tablespoon salt. Very authentic. 
Thanks for the recipe.

We used udon noodles and grated the carrots instead of match sticks.  Turned out wonderful.

Excellent. I used low sodium soy sauce and it was still plenty salty.
