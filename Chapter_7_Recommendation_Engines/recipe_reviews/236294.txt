It's true that haldi ka doodh is a traditional drink, but this recipe has a couple of major errors that will make it ineffective.  In ayurvedic medicine honey is NEVER cooked.  EVER.  If you must use it, add it after the drink has cooled a few minutes.  All sugar is processed, even honey.  It was simply processed by bees. There are mystery ingredients ion honey, yes.  But they should not be cooked according to ayurvedic medicine.   Just use regular cane sugar.  Also, the kind of milk used absolutely matters.  It must be whole cow's milk from a pastured animal, and it must be boiled.  The LAST ingredient you ever want to use is coconut.  It has the opposite effect of all the other ingredients, and will render their medicinal propertires useless.  If you are having a problem believing this, just ask yourself if you think an American blogger has done five thousand years worth of study, observation and testing before swapping out ingredients, or if she did it because she heard coconut milk was really trendy...  Coconut milk is good, but not in a recipe such as this.  Ever.  If you don't drink cow's milk, go spend five thousand years on your own medicinal beverage, and leave this one alone.

I don't have a cold or a sore throat but all the pollen in the air has kicked up my allergies and asthma. I made one before  bed last night . I noticed I had far less wheezing and the tightness in my chest was gone. One dose has made more difference than the 2 weeks of using my Ventolin puffer I've been using. I'm so impressed! I will make again.

I have felt AMAZING well since starting this nighttime beverage! Did you know you can change the serving size in your recipes on Allrecipes.com? I have adjusted to 100 so I can make up a jar-full to make the evening ritual a breeze! We have found that we actually like this drink cold, rather than hot; definitely filtered; and made with unsweetened coconut milk for smooooothness! Another hint! 100 pinches equals just about 2 T! After five years of pain from a nasty fall, I am SO very thankful for tumeric!

My husband read an article that discussed the benefits of turmeric milk, so I found this delicious recipe. Reminds me a lot of Indian Tea/Chai. Committed ourselves to drinking every night for a month. Day 3 - already noticing health benefits; psoriasis improving, cold symptoms long gone, less inflammation, etc. Told many friends and family to try it out. I strongly encourage anyone to try, even just for a couple of nights. You'll definitely notice a difference!

I'd had a version of this once or twice in north India. I loved it but could not figure out the spices, so I was so happy to see this recipe. Delicious, subtle flavors, and energizing. I use whole milk. TIP: Assemble all of the spices, do not omit any.

Very delicious drink!!! I am not a huge fan of tumeric flavor by itself, but this particular blend of spices reminds me of chai tea! I am actually using this to treat a cold and it really seems to be helping. I have also read that it is extremely helpful for menstrual cramps too.

Really good transportation to get your daily dose of turmeric.  It's nice to have at bedtime; it seems to give a feeling of relaxation.  Instead of ground ginger, I buy a liquid ginger from Ginger People and added a splash of that.  From my internet research on turmeric, it is claimed, in order to absorb it properly, the whole milk (a fat source) and black pepper are essential in order to get turmeric's health benefits..

This is a very interesting drink. Reminds me of a drink I have tried in Indian restaurant. I didn`t strain the spices too. Next time I will try this drink with coconut milk.

Since I wanted this on hand and easy, I multiplied all of it, stored in a canning jar. Instead of milk, I used powdered milk and dry honey crystals instead of honey.  All powdered ingredients.  So now, all I have to do is add hot water to how ever much of the mix I want.   Love it and will be making it again.

I liked the flavours and the concept but found that the black pepper overwhelmed everything else. Maybe my black pepper is especially potent?! I'll try with 1/16th tsp of pepper next time.

I didn't strain the milk prior to drinking it...and it was the perfect and most healthy substitute for hot cocoa...I really enjoyed it! And quadrupled the recipe to use in the future! (1 tsp per 1 cup of milk-heated, then added vanilla and about 3 tsp honey)

I've heard about the health benefits of turmeric, so I thought I'd give this a try. It will also warm you up on a chilly night. I only gave it just a light sprinkle of the black pepper after reading some of the reviews, and I wouldn't want any more. The cardamom spice does pack a punch here, too. I found I needed a little more honey for my own taste. Also, I did not strain it, and it was fine.  I made this with 2% milk, but I would like to try this with coconut milk. Something different and very soothing. Thanks, kaymende!

I've never had anything like this for wellness or remedy, but it was absolutely delicious and easy  to make! I'm hoping it will help my husband recover from his head cold soon-- which is why I tried this in the first place. But even if it doesn't, it's definitely the perfect drink (other than tea) to have curled up on the couch before bedtime. Loved it!!

I'm so surprised because I did not think I would like this as much as I did.  I was looking for a replacement for hot chocolate when I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I made it exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious.  Even the pepper adds a kick that works well with the mix.  So I made a large batch and store it in an airtight container.  Now it's ready to go whenever I want a cup.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is delicious. All my favorite things combined in a bedtime drink. I love Coconut blossom sugar - not the same as Coconut sugar. It gives it a delicious flavor and has slightly less calories than honey or sugar.

I used 1% milk so the fat could help the turmeric do it's thing. I also don't have honey on hand at the moment so I used pure maple syrup. It was a little too hot from the ground pepper so I may only add a pinch next time. But it is very relaxing, and I can feel it melting away my monthly cramps without the heavy stickiness of hot cocoa. I'll be making up a larger batch of this mix to have it ready for future uses.

I was so surprised at how good this tasted. Very happy as well because I have been searching for different ways to consume turmeric without taking the expensive capsule pills. Instantly felt calm after consuming. Will be making again

This is delicious!  My 17-year-old son and I both enjoy this at bedtime, and we didn't even realize it's traditionally used as cough/cold medicine.  Wonderful.

I love this!  I didn't have cardamom so I used cinnamon and a little nutmeg, and I also only had tricolor peppercorns instead of black.  I mixed triple the spices in a mason jar to use as needed.  I added some to my morning cup of matcha tea using almond milk and wow!  The flavor profile is awesome!  It literally dances across my tongue every time I take a sip!  I will be using this spice mix in everything!!

I added the honey at the end per the suggestion of one of the comments. I also used oat milk and added a half stick of cinnamon with the rest of the spices, then topped it off my drink with a pinch of cinnamon and black pepper. Very tasty!

First time, I'm sure some of my measurements were off since there were pinches involved... Turned out great! I'm going to make a a larger mix of the dry parts for future batches.

Thank you for sharing! This is unlike anything we've ever had before but it was surprisingly delicious. I cheated and just heated the milk in the microwave in my cup as to make this drink in less than 2 minutes. I was concerned about the amount of spices but it is surprisingly well balanced. Definitely a keeper recipe and a soothing evening drink.

So tasty. Haven’t used it long enough to see if it lives up to the reputation re health benefits.
I use .5 tsp organic maple syrup instead of honey and I heat the milk with fresh ginger. Love this.

I really like the taste of this, it reminds me of a chai without being too sweet. Only thing I have to change is the amount of pepper, less works better for me. The pepper is to help I handle the bennies of the turmeric. Thanks for this tasty beverage

OMG! First of all this drink is delicious. Allrecipes allows change of servings to make a batch. I could not find cardamom so I queried Google that stated combining cinnamon and nutmeg is a good substitute. Other than that I followed the recipe which is sitting in my refrigerator ready to heat each evening. By the way I’m so relaxed after drinking it I go straight to bed. This is a must try and well worth spending money on fresh spices.

I'm fighting off the beginnings of a cold, so I thought I'd try it. It's a wonderful chai-like mixture. It's a little bit of work to put together, so I'm reading all the comments to find ways to make it more "instant".  I don't have a strainer, so I strained it in a french press. Worked like a charm, but most of the spices were passed through. I think it might have removed any pepper grains.

Made this for my daughter for a bad cough, on the advice of a coworker. She had no problem drinking it, as it's very tasty; we'll see how it does with the cough. Omitted the pepper, though, because the brand I have is very hot.

Yuuuummm. Very soothing and comforting! I reduced the amount of black pepper quite a bit and did not strain it (personal preference). I used regular 2% cow's milk and it turned out great, although I think that this recipe would also go very well with other types of milk like soy, almond, coconut, cashew, etc! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and comforting. Made with unsweetened almond milk and maple syrup. Did not strain the spices. Yummy!

This was great! I add a lot more honey (a couple tablespoons) and did not strain the spices. My family loved it.  Thanks!
