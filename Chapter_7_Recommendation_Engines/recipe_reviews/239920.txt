I didn't have wheat germ and I left out the seeds so that my toddler could eat it. I think it's a great base recipe with a lot of ways to make it your own. I added more cinnamon, 1/8 tsp allspice, 1/8 tsp cloves, and 1/4 c semisweet chocolate chips. Made the house smell delicious and were enjoyed by all members of the family. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I liked these a lot. They weren't too sweet (my teen thought more sweet would have been better). I followed the bones of the recipe, but I increased the spices (1 t cinnamon, 1 t pumpkin pie spice) plus 1/2 tsp salt. For the dry ingredients, reduced the sunflower seeds to 1/4c and also added pumpkin seeds (1/4c), 1/4c sliced almonds, 1/4 c chopped pecans, 1/4c shredded coconut, and 2 T ground chia seeds. Additionally, I added 1/3 c dry cranberries and 1/3 c chocolate chips. Yummy! Thanks Hilarybear!

Not bad, though to be honest I don't taste the pumpkin much. I accidentally switched the amounts of flax seed and wheat germ, but it still tastes fine. I added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, which was a good addition, and substituted chopped pecans for the sunflower seeds. I'll probably make this again if I have pumpkin to use up, but I may experiment with increasing the amount so I can actually taste it more.

Excellent. Delicious flavor - restaurant quality. We like thick, heavy pancakes and these were perfect! We will definitely make these over and over again!

These are very dry and bland. I am going to make them again and make some changes.
