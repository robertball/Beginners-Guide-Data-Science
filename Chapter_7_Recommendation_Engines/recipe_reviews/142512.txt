I really loved this recipe. However, i switched things up a bit and used store bought spaghetti sauce and then made my own polenta that had spinach, garlic and cheese in it. Polenta is sooo easy to make and by making it yourself, you can make your own flavors

Searching on this website for a way to use Polenta, I checked this recipe out. My rating reflects my changes.  Seemed like the ingredients were a little unusual, but it looked like something I could work with. I used 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes with garlic.  I’m still not sure where all the salt is coming from…don’t add any more. I used grown up Cremini’s…Portabella’s that is, homemade pesto, dried basil and oregano and twice as much reduced fat Mozzarella. Also, I prefer more like a third of my daily protein intake per meal (3 meals per day), so added less chicken than called for. No point wasting protein, it is one of the more expensive aspects to required daily needs. I also added a can of healthy choice cream of mushroom soup for flavor and “creaminess” as well as some white wine during the reduction process. I didn’t cook the tomato mixture as long as recommended and added the onion and ‘shrooms early. The polenta was “Original” on the bottom and “Garlic Basil” for the upper layer. What I’m saying is I’m not one to respect a recipe on the first go ‘round.  It was a lot of work, what with “searing” the polenta…2 patches in a big pan…blah, blah, blah...but it was DARN good in the end and a change of pace from the whole grain/wheat pasta’s that I LOVE.

This is a good one!  I tossed the chicken chunks in the pesto sauce instead of trying to smear it over the pieces of polenta, and used canned tomato sauce for convenience.  I couldn't find pre-made polenta, so I made my own, nothing is easier!  Next time I'm going to try broiling the polenta in the oven instead of taking the time to fry all those pieces in several batches.  I really liked the polenta in place of pasta, it gives it such a good texture.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is really nice, i didn't put 6 cloves of garlic in i only put in 3, and it was ample.  i also didn't need to cook the sauce for 45minutes, i just cooked it until the sauce began to thicken as the liquid evaporated.  i would definately make it again as the whole family enjoyed it.

This is WONDERFUL.  My husband has begged its permanent residence in my recipe box.  I did leave this a vegetarian dish, omitting the chicken, and I added a couple of layers of flat noodles in addition to the polenta.  All else remained the same.

This was my first time eating polenta, and it was pretty good. I used a little more chicken than the recipe calls for and it turned out great. I'm a sucker for pasta, though.

I too was searching for a polenta recipe and came across this.  My husband has a gluten intolerance so thought I'd give it a try.  I used canned, no-salt added tomatoes as I had no good fresh ones and used fresh oregano/basil from the garden.    I did simmer tomatoes with mushrooms, herbs, and onions to meld the flavors and reduce the liquid for about 40 minutes.  I liked the addition of the pesto and as some previously suggested, tossed the chicken in the pesto before adding to the lasagne.  The combination of flavors is good, with an overall lighter dish than traditional lasagne.  Hubby loved it as it was easy on his GI.  I will make again, but will also try broiling the polenta to save a little time.  Overall, a really good and healthy recipe.  Thanks for posting, chickuh4you!

I didn't change a thing; this was very tasty and simple; I'm not much of a pasta fan; first time trying polenta; and I loved it.  I will definitely be making it again.

I made this a little differently based on circumstance. I didn't have an onion, but it was still fine without it. I just used canned tomato puree, tossed in some extra rosemary and sage with the basil but I didn't have fresh oregano. I probably needed like 4 tomatoes and 6 mushrooms, though 10 would be good, too, for mushroom lovers.
I used Quorn "chik'n" strips instead of real meat, which were delicious. I'd definitely put in much more pesto and cheese! I also added some sauteed spinach and eggplant in the sauce. With adjustments by preference, it was really, really good but takes a LONG time!

This was good, but the polenta gets a little slimy. My husband loved it, but the kids didn't like the texture.

This is an excellent twist on lasagna. The flavors are so much more exciting. The pesto is a great addition, and I was afraid the polenta would get too mushy, but I ended up actually liking it better than noodle texture. I used a spaghetti sauce in a jar instead of making my own to save time and used regular mushrooms and onions. I also threw in some carrots, zucchini and red pepper that I needed to use up. My only complaint is that frying the polenta is both time consuming and painful (oil gets very splashy). Not really sure how to fix that, but might try baking next time...

This was wonderful. Be sure to use roma tomatoes or the sauce will never thicken properly. As another reviewer suggested, I tossed the chicken with the pesto for ease of assembly. To make it a one dish meal, I also added veggies. I sauteed chopped onion with a bit of olive oil before adding and sauteeing the chicken. Then I removed the chicken from the pan and added a cubed zucchini and the rest of an eggplant I had leftover along with some sliced mushrooms and minced garlic. When the veggies were done, I proceeded with the recipe as written. I did top with a bit of freshly grated parmesan. Any veggies you have would work as would the recipe written as is.
