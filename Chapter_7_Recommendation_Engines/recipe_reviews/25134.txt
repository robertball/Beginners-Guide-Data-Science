I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was indeed delicious.  My only complaint is that they don't store well.  A second attempt with 1/2 cup less oil and one extra egg made them perfect!  No more crumbling cookies!!

I made this recipe with a few alterations (semisweet instead of milk chocolate chips, and extra peppermint extract to taste).  I took them to a baking contest, and won first prize in the chocolate cookie categories.  The mint makes these cookies less heavy tasting than they would be otherwise.  There were no kids under the age of 21 present, but all the kids above that age loved them.

these chocolate mint cookies are the best! i'm a super fan of gooy, chocolaty things and these definately are both!  i did make some alterations, though, i don't know how much they affected the outcome- i had the recipe scaled to make 48 servings; i used only 1/2 teaspn salt, 1/3 cup vegetalbe oil, 3/4 cup light brown sugar, and a little over 1/2 cup white sugar, with 1 egg and 1 egg white; 2 teaspoons peppermint extract; and used about 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  oh and to make sure they were nice and gooy, a baked them for about 7 mins. and only let them set on the pan for about 2-3 minutes.  usually i only like cookies when they're straight out of the oven, but these were even addicting after they had completly cooled- i don't know how well they store- they didn't last more than a little over a day at my house!

These are awesome.  I took the advice of one of the reviews and added the 1/2 cup oil and two eggs.  I also changed one other thing, instead of the using peppermint extract and reg choc chips, I used 2 cups of mint chocolate chips (i got them at the bulk barn).  Turned out really well!

These cookies turned out perfectly - I think they are the best cookies I ever made.  Just the right amount of peppermint, although I didn't think it would be enough.

This recipe is really good if you use 2 eggs instead of 1 and store the batter in the refrigerator when not in use. I took the cookies to a picinic for work and won best cookie! My dad, who doesn't like chocolate, even liked these cookies.

I didn't get why you needed some white and some wheat flour, nor did I get the importance of powdered milk  but regardless,  I really liked this recipe.    I used 2 eggs instead of one and 1/2 c. oil instead of 1 c., as many reviewers said they did.  I also used mint choc chips.  These were hard to find, I was told stores usually stock up during holidays but not year round.    I got extra packs of the chips b/c I will be making this recipe again.  Highly recommend.

The flavor of these cookies was delicious.  But the texture left much to be desired.  They came out flat and crumbly.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I wish I had followed the suggestion to use 1/2 the oil, and an extra egg, and maybe even more flour?  Also should have  refrigerated the dough for a bit before baking

I loved this recipe and they tasted even better frozen. I don't know why people were saying it was crumbly when frozen it was perfect for me! However I gave this recipe a four because when I ate them when they were cooled the crumbled then. Next time once they are done cooling I will freeze them. They tasted great with cold milk. I will be making this again

For a healthy yet delicious alternative use wholewheat flour/wholewheat pastry flour, soymilk for those that want to keep them non-dairy, 1 cup olive oil (much better for you when heated), 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 cup brown sugar (they are plenty sweet with 1 cup, 2 cups completely unnecessary!), 3 tsp peppermint, dark/semi chocolate chips. They came out soft and delicious! Enjoy!

I just tried this recipe, and it turned into burned flat blobs.  Beings it was a new recipe for me, i made sure to followed it exactly.  It seems to me that there was not enough flour in it.  I was very disappointed.

Not a bad cookie recipe.  I gave it four stars because they don't store well.  I didn't have any whole wheat flour so I used all white flour.  Also used semi sweet chips cause that's what I had on hand.  Took the suggestion of others and added 1 more egg and less oil as well.  Might make again at Christmas but don't think I'd find myself craving them.

Awesome cookies. Made them for New Years and they're amazing fresh. The only down side is they don't keep too well, even in my cookie tin. They eventually turn out dry and crumble. I'll try these again...maybe with a few modifications for moistness.

These cookies are awesome.  I am very critical of cookies, very picky, and these are definitely 5 stars.  I did change the recipe as someone else recommended (1/2 c. veg oil instead of 1 cup, 2 eggs instead of 1, deleted the peppermint extract and instead used 2 cups mint chocolate chips) and I am SO happy I did.  I am definitely planning on making these again!

I thought I could make these cookies so they would prove everyone else wrong who had problems with them.  I couldn't.  The taste was really good, but when they fall apart in your hand, they just can't cut it.  I am planning on using the crumbs as part of an ice cream pie.  The first pan I baked was as per the recipe except for using mint flavored chocolate chips in the mix, and then I tried adding a little flour for the second pan.  I gave it my best!

Instead of one egg, I used two and kept the oil at 1 cup. They came out soft and amazing! Definitely making this recipe again.

I went with other reviewers and used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup oil. Can anyone help me with a way to make them not crumbly because the change of those ingredients didn't help! Id love to make them again!

These have great taste, but are very crumbly.  Maybe its because I didn't have any wheat flour and just used gold medal flour?  I would definitely follow another reviewer's suggestion by reducing oil and adding another egg--that might make it perfect.

This cookie has a great texture and taste. It seems to fall apart pretty easy though. People really loved the taste. I plan to make these again.
