Perfectly moist, not too sweet, this was such a hit. 

I took a few liberties:

Because I didn't have ginger, I sprinkled a little rum, maybe 1 tablespoon, over the chopped apples.

I didn't peel the apples, I liked the rustic texture.

To the flour topping, I added 4 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup of rolled oats to give it more crunch.

I baked it sheet pan-style, for about 35 minutes, and it made for an easy way to serve it to a crowd for a morning birthday gathering. With a strong cup of coffee, naturally!

Lots of cinnamon flavor--I especially love the spice-centric topping, and if you're in the mood for apple cake, this is a quick way to satisfy your fall cravings! Delicious!

flavorful and moist. The step of creating the topping alongside the flour mixture is clever and saves time.

I made this recipe today. The only thing I did differently was that I used sour milk instead of buttermilk. I added 2 1/2 teaspoons vinegar to my measuring cup and then added the milk to equal 3/4 cup. I let that set while I mixed the other ingredients together, then I whisked the egg into it and added it to the flour mixture as stated.  I baked mine for 45 minutes.  Delicious!

This was so good, I could not stop eating it. It was exactly what I was looking for when I searched for apple spice cake, and it came out perfectly.

One of our favs!! I mix the crumble with all four tsp of cinnamon just to keep it simple. Easy and DELICIOUS!! I use an 8” pan and notice it takes 65 mins for 8”.

This a a very East nice moist coffee cake. I added nutmeg 1 tsp. 
And used brown sugar instead of white. Also put some walnuts in the batter. I’ll use this again for sure.
