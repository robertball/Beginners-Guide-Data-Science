We loved this!  I followed the recipe as directed, except I used portabella mushrooms (they were on sale). I also mixed the melted butter with the crackers in a zip lock bag for easy distribution.

My husband went back for thirds and fourths.  I will definitely be making this recipe on a regular basis! #AllstarsClassico

Super yummy! Doubled the recipe as I wanted leftovers. My hubby and daughter were very happy. My daughter doesn't care for mushrooms so I made a mini one for her without them. I took advice from another reviewer and mixed the cracker crumbs and melted butter together. Great tip! Ritz crackers would be good too.

We loved the taste of the creamy alfredo sauce blended into this rice casserole mixture - such a nice change of pace from a typical "soup can" recipe. I love the suggestion to add broccoli and will definitely have to give that a try soon! :)

A really great comfort food dinner!  I simplified by using rotisserie chicken breast and pre-sliced mushrooms.  I took other reviewer's advice and added broccoli and onions and used Ritz instead of saltines.  I didn't use the full amount of butter to cook the veggies in and I didn't think it needed butter on the top.  Delicious!  doesn't make a ton - might use two boxes of rice next time.  Will definitely be one to make again and again.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I thought this was very good! The only thing that I did differently was to use crushed Ritz crackers rather than saltines. It was great, and I'm sure I'll make it again...next time, I think I will try adding broccoli!

Next time I am going to make this with all wild rice, broccoli rather than parsley most likely I will leave the crackers off.  It is a good recipe and a great one for personalizing.

We all enjoyed this and I will make it again. We do several potluck dinners throughout the year and this would be great! I added a bit of shredded cheese to the top before and used Ritz craCkers instead of saltines.

I am overruling my husband on the rating of this.  He gave it a 4,  but he doesn't ever want me to make rice.  I, on the other hand, loved this!  I followed the recipe pretty exactly.  I would not add any salt to this because the wild rice mix and the Classico sauce both have enough for those who tend to be salt-sensitive.  You can always add more later!  In other recipes I've made using cracker crusts like this I've always mixed the butter and crackers together, and I did that, too, but it does take a little more butter.  This would be pretty good sized servings for 4.  Thank you so much, Sandra!  This was really nice!

Delicious.  My kids devoured it!  Added  one box of publix frozen broccoli with 3/4 onion.  Doubled recipe with 2 boxes of long grain rice and wild rice mix.  Added extra 1/2 cup of long grained white rice.  Topped off with 23 ritz crackers.

LOVED IT!   I threw in some broccoli because for one, I wanted some color and two, it was a suggestion from another reviewer.   HOME RUN!!!    Thank you sandra_92083 for the recipe!   I will be making this one again!

Made this for my son and fiancé and they loved it.  There were only two things I did differently.  One - we do not eat mushrooms, so after taking the  advice of another viewer, I replaced them with broccoli.  Second was I used ritz butter garlic crackers and crushed them up and added them on top.  It turned out perfect.  Great recipe and will be making this again and again.

Simply great flavor.  My variation was to double the recipe but use 1/4 of the required mushrooms and only one jar of alfredo sauce.  We don't like a lot of mushrooms but it still turned out completely delicious!

If you love Alfredo this is a easy quick recipe.  My husband prefers rice over pasta, so he loves this dish.

This was an awesome dish! I followed the recipe but did add some sautéed onions along with the mushrooms. Also added spinach to it since I had it in hand. Be careful on the salt because like other reviewers it does have enough salt from the rice and Alfredo sauce. My guys loved it and went back for more! Definitely a keeper!!

Wow! Delicious. I used a small jar of sliced mushrooms, and put some LAWRY'S Seasoned Salt in the wild rice before all the liquid absorbed with a little stir. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This is wonderful comfort food!  Served with green beans and a salad.  I was concerned that the alfredo sauce would overpower the rice, but it blended so nicely for a great change from ordinary mushroom soup sauces. It had much more kick and flavor!  Like other reviewers, I added the melted butter to the cracker crumbs and shook in a plastic baggie to coat, mostly out of habit. It gave it a nice crunchy topping.  The only thing I changed was to sprinkle some shredded mozzarella cheese on top after it came out of the oven...and that is just because we are big cheese lovers.  :)   I will definitely make again, with broccoli or peas or carrots added in... Tons of possibilities to use leftover veggies!  Thanks for a simple yet delicious recipe to add to my supper rotation!

I made this according to the recipe with the addition of broccoli which I can't imagine changed it too much! It's definitely tasty- I love the idea of Alfredo rather than cream of mushroom soup. It's not knock your socks off, but it's go-back-for-seconds comfort food. And so easy!

This was absolutely delicious. Pretty much made as listed but no butter on top and no olive oil. Just 2TBSP of butter to start with. I do not think I would like broccoli in it so will make it as listed again in the future.  Maybe something crunchy - pecans?

The only change I made was to the chicken. I cook chicken beforehand via my Instant Pot and shred it. This way, you have an easy way to cook up any recipe that can use shredded chicken! Otherwise no changes. Kids loved it. Husband loved it.

Absolutely Delicious!  Even my extremely picky husband liked it.  Only recommendation he had...he wanted the mushrooms cut up more then just sliced since he doesn't really like the texture of mushrooms.  Cutting them up a little more then just a slice would fix that for him.  Great recipe!  Thank you for sharing. :o)

Followed recipe other than the much needed addition of broccoli. Myself and family just weren't big fans of the Alfredo mixed with wild rice. Not going to be making this one again.

Super easy and yummy. I don't like mushrooms so I replaced with broccoli. Other than that I made it as directed. Thanks for a great meal.

Added a small-ish fresh, uncooked, diced zucchini. Delicious.

This is soooo good! I doubled everything except the cracker topping (mixed with 2 T melted butter). I also added chopped onion and garlic when I sautéed the mushrooms. My store doesn't carry the Classico brand so I used Prego Artisan Three Cheese. Delicious!

This was simple and very tasty! I added some sliced pepperoncini for a little acid/mild heat. I may try topping with shredded cheese instead of crackers next time as we are GF.
