I made two of these breads. One with 2% milk and one with soy milk, since one family member can't drink cows milk. The one with 2% was okay, but better toasted. The soy milk bread was wonderful! Since soy milk is thicker and slightly sweet, it carried over to the bread. The soy bread was moister and a tad sweeter then the 2% bread. Everyone in the family was fighting over the soy bread. This bread recipe is going in the file but with soy milk.

The bread is very good. I made a loaf of white bread last night and wanted to try something different. I noticed straight away that it was too dry, so I actually put a splash more milk in it and about a teaspoon of oil. It turned out great- fluffy and yummy.

I just got my machine and this is the 5th and by far the best bread recipe I have tried. I heated my milk in the microwave until just warm. I put the milk, yeast and sugar into the bread pan. I let that sit for 10 minutes, until the yeast started foaming,then added the flour and salt. I baked this on the light setting and it didn't last 5 minutes after it came out of the pan! This recipe is definately a keeper!

I used my breastmilk to make bread for my child who is deathly allergic to traditional forms of milk. The bread turned out great!

I made this with half whole wheat flour and added 2 T. gluten and 2 T. dry milk powder. It rose really well at first, then fell a bit. Good taste; not much to look at.

I really liked this bread.  It is extremely easy to make.  It reminded me of the bread you can buy at St. Germaine Bakery or what I consider Japanese style bread.  This bread is on the  chewier side.  The crust is thick and chewy.  I set my bread machine for 1.5lbs and light crust.

My 5-star version modifications  11/8 cup 1% fat milk instead of 4% -- 3.5 tbs brown sugar instead of 3 white -- 2 cups white, 1 cup whole wheat instead of 3 white -- a dash of salt less than recommended -- dried sweetened blueberries and walnut pieces at "add" beep on bread machine -- very important**, 2 tsp of unsweetened applesauce.   stellar bread, easily one of best ever..

The preparation for this recipe is SO easy!
I found the bread a bit "coarse" inside and the crust was a bit thicker than other loaves done in the breadmaker, but the tasty and slight sweet flavor of this bread quickly makes you love it!

I've been making this consistently for over a year.  It is by far the best bread to come out of my bread machine!  No changes to recipe.  Works at high-alt.

I tried this but I added a tablespoon of cold butter and because I thought the dough was a bit stiff when it was mixing, I added another tablespoon of milk, and used bread flour in place of all purpose. It turned out so good! I will be using this one again!

Very simple, soft white bread that made hubs happy.  He prefers softer breads, and this fit the bill.  I had to add more liquid, so I added 1 1/4 cups milk for each loaf (I doubled this recipe) and the consistency was slightly dry even then, so it probably does need adjusting most times.  I usually make the dough in the bread machine, then bake it--we just prefer the crust that way in this house.  I baked at 40 mins for 350 and it was a perfect consistency for my husband's taste.  This is just a basic bread, so if you want more flavor, you'll have to add spices or add ins like dried fruit or nuts.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe was really super easy. Made it as is. But ended up making a 2nd batch because the 1st batch was gone with in 10 minutes after I removed from the bread maker. It was so delish. It really was impressive. I'll be making again and again. The 1st time. I didn't pay attention to the recipe's loaf size. That truly is important when setting your machine. I put on the light white bread setting on the 2nd batch and it came out darn near perfect! Will have to make another batch in the next few days. TY is was fabulous!

First bread machine recipe, ate half a loaf!  So delicious and moist.  I will be trying this again with bread flour to try to get a better rise, but either way I am hooked on this simple and tasty recipe!

This is definitely my go to bread recipe.  However, I like the texture when I use bread flour instead of all purpose.  I also need to add a bit of olive oil in the machine once the ball starts forming.

Love this bread, perfect taste, I added extra milk to make it even more moist. This is the easiest bread, I also like the fact that I don't have to add any oils, I reduced sugar to two tablespoons, this one is my favorite  Thank you for this one, Marzena from Utah

This is amazing, I have tried four different types of recipes before this and failed, but this was super easy, the only difference was I used coconut milk instead or cow milk and I don’t have a bread maker so I make the dough in my nija processor with the dough blade and turned it out in a bread pan and allowed I to rise for 2hrs and it was light and fluffy. Even my judgmental parents enjoyed it

Home made Bread doesn't get easier than this! Tastes great! 
I followed the recipe but changed the technique a bit. I heated my milk and sugar in the microwave for 30 seconds then added the yeast to it. (Not too hot or you'll kill the yeast)
Made the dough in my bread machine and watched to add a tbsp more flour or milk if it needed it. (It really depends on the weather where you are.) It made a perfect loaf. You can do this recipe in your stand mixer too and bake in your oven instead of using bread maker.
Found it so easy I made 2 more batches the same morning to surprise family with cinnamon rolls for dessert! To make the cinnamon rolls I mixed the dough in my bread maker then let it rise for 15 minutes before rolling it out adding the filling, (just slather on a layer of butter then brown sugar then cinnamon) cutting in 2" pieces etc. and then letting it rise a half hour more before baking. (275F for 20 min)

I just bought a new bread machine 2 days ago. The first loaf I made was this recipe. It turned out great. I read alot of reviews about the bread sinking. I was so afraid mine would too. I don't know what I did, but the loaf was perfect. My husband ate 2 slices as soon as it cooled. I will be making this alot.

I love this recipe. I am allergic to milk so I used soy as the person below recommended. Great, I didn't have regular yeast so I used quick rise and added another 1/2 tsp. Just great, everyone in the family loved it and two loves where gone in  a day.

Very good -- a bit sweet for me, but my husband doesn't think so. I used bread flour and added a bit more milk, as did many others. I'll make this again. ****************************************** Makes GREAT toast! (1/12/11)

Delicious, soft and light. I made it with 1 1/2 cups skim milk (I've made variations before & have always had more liquid than what's suggested), and followed other ingredients as written. Cooked on regular 1 1/2 lb setting. My machine recommends liquids then flour then yeast, and came out perfect!

My hunny and I both love this bread!  It's perfect for so many different uses.  Everything from bread and butter to bread pudding and italian cheese bread.  We use this recipe at least once a week.

I've only recently bought a bread machine and this is the first recipe I made.

The bread tastes amazing and I love the fact that it doesn't have all those preservatives that shop bread has. It's also denser / chewier than shop bread, so a normal sandwich fills me up!

I substituted All Purpose Flour with White Bread Flour since we don't seem to have All Purpose Flour in the country. Still worked great!

I'll definitely be saving this recipe and I highly recommend it!

we add more liquid and a little oil. we do the scoop and scrape method for the flour. perhaps if you do the spooning method you would not need more liquid.

I made the dough in my bread machine running a dough cycle. I then put the dough in a normal loaf pan (I HATE the shape they come out of a bread machine) and let it rise covered by a cloth for 40 minutes. After the second rise I baked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes, worked like a charm.

Made it all according to the recipe warmed the milk & bread mixer pan.  Turned out great. Spongy bread. Going to try it again in my bread maker overnight  for morning fresh bread. Hope it also turns out.

I used sour milk.  It came out great.  FYI for you who said that the bread fell flat:  The temp of your liquid is critical to good bread so if your yeast didn't make the dough rise properly then I'd invest in a yeast thermometer.  I literally wore out my bread machine but my Kitchenaid mixer does a great job with the dough hook so I just use that now and bake my bread in the oven.

no bread machine.. no problem mix it in the mixer, let it rise in a warm place for like a hour then take out punch down, knead and place in to a greased (with butter) bread pan. let that rise in a warm place for a hour or until the bread reaches the top of the pan by a inch. also my trick I use bread flour it makes it less dense. also once your done to make the crust soft rub it down with butter trust me it works wonders!

This bread is delicious! I used vanilla almond milk (half sweetened, half unsweetened) because that was all I had, and it turned out great. I also used bread flour instead of all-purpose (what I had on hand), and brown sugar instead of white (my preference). I set my bread maker to 1.5 lb with the light crust setting. I did not have issues with the bread sinking.

It's a very good bread for the family. Mom and Pops love it. and for me, that's the best. Yes I made a change I add a 2 Tbsp of butter and paint the bread with butter and milk, 30 minutes before it was done, that add a great flavor as smell to milk.

I like the recipe - great flavor and texture. I added about half white whole-wheat flour in place of half of the white and substituted bread flour for the other half, otherwise exactly the same proportions with the exception of a tad of water b/c the dough was too dry. However, I would like to address the "sinking" or collapsing bread that others have discussed in their reviews. I have burned out 2 bread machines and am on my third and have discovered that each machine is different. The reason bread collapses is because the rising cycle is too long, creating an over-inflated loaf. If your bread machine is guilty of this, see if you can change to a different setting to shorten the rising time. Otherwise my best suggestion is to use the "dough" cycle of the bread machine, then take it out and bake it in your own oven using a bread pan or free-form loaf. Maybe 375 for about 30 minutes for this size loaf would work. You will know if the bread has a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom. Internal temp of about 190 if you're inclined to use a thermometer. Mine collapsed, but next time I will do the dough cycle and bake it in the oven to see if that is better.

This is one of the tastiest loaves I have ever made. Had to add a couple of extra TBSP milk and I prefer to use the dough setting and bake in the oven otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Sooooo good!  This has become my new go-to.

I have a new Cuisinart bread maker and have been looking for a perfect, everyday bread recipe for my family. This recipe was probably the 10th one I had tried and it didn't last a day! My family asked that I only make this one from now on and everytimem they'd hear the machine going for the next month they'd double check with me to make sure I wasn't trying something different. I did try another reviewer's suggestion of heating the milk and mixing the yeast in to proof for 10 minutes, then I read on my bread machine yeast that you're never to let it touch liquids so I tried it the traditional way of layering ingredients per the machine's instructions and both ways worked but I do believe that the 2nd version turned out a better loaf. I think sometimes the issue that people have with recipes, especially ones this simple are either a low functioning machine or lower quality ingredients. The only time this has turned out less than stellar for me is when I subbed in some wheat flour and didn't set it on the wheat bread setting. I use King Arthur brand flour, Fleishmann's bread machine yeast, Zulca Marena sugar, Kosher salt and Braum's milk (which isn't available everywhere), point being that a better quality ingredient with almost always turn out a better quality item unless there is a flaw somewhere in the recipe. IF you're a budget shopper it may be harder to spend a little more but in our case, this is the only bread we eat so it's worth a few $$ more to get it perfect!

I used honey rather than refined sugar. The bread was absolutely beautiful and delicious.  I used the white bread setting on my bread machine that doesn't adjust the timer less than 3 hours, so I just set the oven timer for 2.5.

This is my first bread and I mainly followed the hold recipes.  However, after go though the reviews, I also added extra milk(about 10ml) and a small piece of salted butter (get a wrong one in supermarket).  I use 1 tea spoon quick-rise yeast.
