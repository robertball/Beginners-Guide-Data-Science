So easy and tasty, hubby and I like this as a simple weeknight meal.  I always pound the chicken breasts thinner, and season well with S&P, garlic and onion powders, and a little crushed rosemary and thyme before browning.  I never have blandness probs as another reviewed stated and I think it's because I season well before cooking.  I've been using this recipe for years, cut from off a Swanson broth can! I like anothers suggestion of adding diced onion and apple...will try that next time!

This turned out really well! I did make a few adjustments. I started with the 2 xlg yams (as advised, but I used 3 cups of green beans, and 2 1/2 c. of stock. When the veggies were ready, I took out the yams and a little more than half the stock/herbs and hand-blended them, adding a little butter and maple syrup. I figured this way, I could save the mashed yams and beans for tomorrow's side dish. Since I cook for two, I like to stretch out recipes as much as I could. The remaining stock in the pan with the green beans and chicken made a nice au jus. My husband gave it a nine out of ten!

The chicken did not absorb as much of the herb flavors as I thought and was bland though it was juicy and tender.  If I make this again I will slice some onion and maybe some apples to cook with the potatoes.

Excellent! Like Lissa suggested, I seasoned chicken first with s/p, garlic and onion powder. I used Trader Joe's frozen French green beans. The sweet potato chunks took longer than 15 mins to soften, so I added a second cup of chicken stock and let them cook awhile longer.  Great leftovers today!

This recipe is easy, healthy and tasty. I knew just by looking at the recipe that it would be wise to season the chicken with salt and pepper before browning. I used EVOO instead of veg. oil and I used yams instead of sweet potatoes. I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup dry white wine before adding the broth. I just might make this again as a quick and healthy weeknight meal.

We really enjoyed this.  Used regular potatoes since my husband won't touch sweet potatoes.  I put s&p on the chicken before browning but that was my only adjustment.  I liked this recipe as it is, but it's also a good base recipe to experiment with.  I'll be using this often - a quick and tasty way to get a good dinner on the table during the week!  Thanks for sharing!

I really screwed up making this dish (used bouillon cube in hot water for lack of chicken stock, no rosemary, forgot the onions till the end), and it still turned out pretty tasty! I took another's advice and seasoned the chicken first with s&p and garlic powder and browned it in sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil. Can't say I'd crave it, but I will certainly try it again (hopefully with ALL of the ingredients). A nice, light meal.

So simple and very tasty. I felt great eating this. I didn`t even find it necessary to season the chicken.

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle a bit of seasoning salt on the chicken before browning. I was afraid it might be too bland without it. It was perfect! Next time, I think I'll try the footnote ideas by adding wine, lemon juice and mustard. Sounds wonderful!

I did some of the alterations others suggested - added onion and apples, however this dish was very bland and tasted only like the thyme.

My family is very picky, and everyone really liked this dish! (My kids still won't eat sweet potatoes, but they LOVED the beans and the chicken.) It was easy, tasty, and added such a wonderful aroma throughout the kitchen. I will definitely make this again!

Great flavor.  My chicken was a little chewy.  I probably let it cook a few minutes too long.  Next time I will try using thighs with skin browned in olive oil vs. these bonesless, skinless breasts.  I am saving this recipe for future use and enjoyed the taste and the veggies.

Chicken needs to be seasoned.  The sweet potatoes and green beans turned out wonderful, but the chicken was bland.  I will try it again, but will pound and season the chicken before cooking in order to get the flavor into the chicken as well.

Really flavorful.  Kids ate the chicken. My daughter even ate the sweet potatoes. I’ll definitely make again especially to use up sweet potatoes. I added half an onion and doubled up on the chicken, which I cut into strips so that the kids could eat it readily. I also added steak seasoning on the chicken during browning to add flavor.

Definitely pound out the chicken and season it with SP, onion powder and garlic before browning. I make this often and discovered that substituting the green beans with a large green and yellow squash works nicely. I also add a bit of extra broth and cut the chicken into medallions.

Made this tonight.  Only changes were seasoning the chicken with pepper, garlic, onion and thyme before browning and added an onion to the veggies.  It turned out great.  Super easy, and quick.  Will definitely make again, though I may try something other than green beans since the hubby didn't seem to care for them.

This was a really odd combination but I was looking for an "Autumn Chicken" dish. I knew it was lacking something and the broth just looked lackluster so I added in some powdered gravy mix reconstituted with water and cooked together for the last 10 minutes. The gravy was a hit and the flavor in the gravy really filled out the flavor in the dish. You can play with this depending on your tastes - use a country gravy or creole gravy to make it fun.
