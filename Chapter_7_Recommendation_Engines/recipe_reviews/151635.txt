My mom used to make a variation of this recipe. however, she would just brush the fish with butter and then sprinkle chicken stuffing mix on the top. It is amazing!!! We even use it with just fresh bass after a freshwater fishing trip on the farm. You can add whatever herbs and spices you like, but we usually just sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Really enjoyed the delicate flavors. I did substitute 1 grated carrot, 1 rib diced celery and 1/2 cup diced onion instead of the sliced carrot and green pepper. I dusted the fish with lemon pepper before drizzling with the lemon-parsley butter. Then baked at 450 for 12 minutes and on high broil for 2-3 minutes. Whole family loved it.

I really liked this recipe. I made it more simplistic, due to the ingredients I had. I just used stove top chicken stuffing and I didnt add any vegetables. I used Talapia fillets.  Who would of thought chicken stuffing with fish??? It was really tasty!

Not a drop left in the dish. The sauce that this makes all by itself is very tasty. I had petite carrots so I just sliced those in half. I added onion also. Fish used was pollock because that is what my husband caught fresh during his deep sea fishing trip. Had to give him the credit here.

This is a great combo of flavors! I simplified the recipe and didn't add carrots or peppers. I used sage stuffing. Cooked the stuffing according to directions. Then put fish over the stuffing. Used the butter mixture. My only negative is that I think there was too much lemon juice! It was a bit overpowering.

Not a favorite for anyone in my family.  The stuffing and fish just did not taste good together.  It was quite a bland recipe.  I will not make this ever again.

We added a small onion and clove of garlic, chopped everything fine, then cooked in the butter until softened before adding the water and stuffing mix.  Cooked the fish on top of the stuffing.  Really, really good.

My family will revolt and block allrecipes if I ever make this again.  They ate leftovers instead of this fish dish.

I liked this recipe.  I used haddock fillets, Chicken Stove Top Stuffing, I added the carrots and celery AND I drizzled oil olive on the fish.  I also sprinkled the fish with parsely and a lemon and herb seasoning.  The timing in the recipe worked for me too. Good recipe for a quick meal during the week - just add a vegetable or green salad.
