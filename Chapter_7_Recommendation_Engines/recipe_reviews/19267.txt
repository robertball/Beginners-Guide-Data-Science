Delicious!  Light, fluffy, airy with a hint of orange flavor.  It's a quite lovely little cookie.  Wanting a stronger flavor for some of them I also used the the Orange Cream Cheese Frosting from this site which was fantastic.  My changes:  I used butter flavored shortening (that's all I had) and I after reading other reviews I doubled the orange zest as well.  My batch also made a little over 6 dozen.  I did scooped them with a cookie scoop right out of the bowl - no refrigerating, no rolling, no cutters.  I'm not a "pretty cookie" maker.  Also, please remember this is NOT a super-sweet cookie.  Not all cookies should cause cavities.  This one is a little different, a little special, and very very easy.  That's 5 stars in my book.  Thanks for the recipe!

Although I received several compliments for these at a cookie exchange, I felt they were very bland. :( They puffed up alot with baking and were very airy, even after the dough was rolled out to 1/4 inch thickness. Next time I will double the orange zest, maybe substitute half of the shortening for butter, and roll out the dough as thin as possible! Icing was definitely a good addition to these. :)

These cookies are great -- not too sweet, and they taste fresh with the hint of orange.  My batch made OVER 6 DOZEN 2-inch cookies.  I actually chilled my dough for about a week, because I got sidetracked, but it was still easy to work with.  You can put the cookies right next to each other on the baking sheets -- they puff but don't spread.

These cookies were alright in terms of flavor.  Not the best I've ever had.  They were, however, very easy to make and excellent to roll out.  Infact I only refridgerated the dough for 3 hours and I mixed everything in my kitchenaid and I added a little extra orange juice and I had not a single problem rolling and cutting the cookies. They also baked very nicely and were very tender to eat.  Not very sweet, so they do need an icing.  I will probably turn this into my new "holiday cookies for school" recipie.

very good!!! I did double the zest called for but thats what my orange had on it, lol. I did not refrigerate overnight simply because I did not plan on rolling them out. I used a scoop and they maintained the same shape in and out of the oven. They do not spread, do not puff, and taste great!!!!!!! Thx for the recipe =))

I cooked this recipe for 9:30 and turned out pretty good. I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and while stirring the mix i added a little more orange juice and a tad bit of milk and it turned out pretty good.

the flavor of the dough was good but it was INCREDIBLY soft and impossible to use for cut out cookies. the cookies bake up to nearly twice the size of the dough. it was VERY frustrating to try and make cut out cookies with this dough. i even stuck the dough in the freezer as a last resort with no different results. i recommend using another recipe if you're looking to make cut out cookies.

Loved this recipe. I always taste the dough when making cookies to make sure I like the flavor. The taste wasn't quite as strong enough for me so I added extra orange peel and added some orange extract. The flavor really popped and was very good.

These cookies are totally lacking in flavor.  I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with bland and bread like results.  I covered them in sugar and cinnamon to try to rescue them but ended up throwing them all in the garbage in the end.

These cookies came out to a cake-like texture. The orange taste was nice and subtle. Like others said, the cookies were not sweet enough on their own to be considered cookies (maybe biscuits), so I added an orange cream cheese icing (from this site) and it brought out the orange flavor with a bit of extra sweetness it needed. They did, however, stay fresh for about 6 days in sealed tupperware.

Great recipe over all...  The dough was a bit dry and crumbly when I went to roll it out after resting in the fridge all night, but after moistening it a bit with damp hands it was fine.  Great cookies!  And the Orange Cream Cheese Frosting from this site is perfect with them!
