I didn't actually try this recipe, I just wanted the address the apple question of another review...I bake 10-12 apple pies a year and always use the same apple mixture: 2 large Granny Smith, 2 large Rome or Golden Delicious, and 2 misc. apples such as Gala or Fuji. The different textures and levels of sweetness really make the pie incredible. Also, I always thinly slice the apples and slightly overstuff the pie.

I am giving this 4 stars because the first time I made it I followed the recipe to a "t" and it only turned out OK, but it had the potential to be much better.   I love making my own crust, I use the Crisco crust recipe (the one that is included here) but I like to add 2Tbs of brown sugar, 1tsp of cinnamon and 8Tbs of ice water instead of 4.  (HINT: place Crisco and ice water in freezer at least 30 min before use- if your ingredients get too warm it will yield a chewy crust, not flaky.) When I divide the dough, I make one ball slightly larger for the bottom crust; this allows for your crust to fully cover the bottom of the pan and makes it a little thicker.  I then pre-bake the bottom crust in the pie plate at 425 for 5min then lightly sprinkle the bottom crust with flour before adding the apples, this helps with sogginess. I use Macintosh apples and then sprinkle the apples with 2Tbs of whiskey before covering with the top crust.  I didn't use the egg wash because the crust really doesn't need it.  This made an awesome pie.

Two attempts at this and still trying. Both times I followed the recipe to a T and both times, it turned out beautiful. The only problem is I have not been happy with the taste of the apples. I do not like a tart apple pie. The first time I made it I used Jonathan...very tart. The second time, I used Granny Smith...a little better, but only because I doubled the sugar content. Can anyone tell me the right apple to use for a sweet apple pie??? I was so disappointed to have beautiful pies almost too pretty to even cut, only to taste how tart it was and have to pitch the whole thing!

Although I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating I have to say that it is based on the filling only.  I was pressed for time so I ended using a ready to use crust.  It is excellent though.  I used 5 very large Granny Smith apples and it was a little bit on the tart side.  So I'd increase the amount of sugar just a tad if using these types of apples again.

It is absolutely amazing how simple yet delicious this recipe is. What takes time is slicing the apples and it is worth it!

The only thing I did different was to use 1/2cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (I like the taste and texture brown sugar adds).

Excellent recipe! The only changes I made were to use one of those all ready rolled out pie crusts, I used a mix of granny smith and honey crisp apples,and when I egg washed the top crust, I sprinkled it with coarse white sugar. This is the only apple pie recipe I will use from here on out, the filling was perfect!!!!!

Very delicious! It was my first time making apple pie and this proved to be an easy recipe to follow. Only thing is that the directions say to add salt to the filling, but salt isn't mentioned in the filling's ingredients, only in the crust. Hmm...

Easy and delicious, this recipe is great!  I did have to tweak the amount of water for the crust, 4 tablespoons was not enough.  I ended up using 8 and it was perfect.

This was my first time making apple pie from scratch and thanks to this recipe it won't be my last!

I use McIntosh or a combination of McIntosh & Cortlands as my family and I prefer a softer apple filling that holds together (I NEVER use Granny Smiths).  I pre-cook my apple slices, tossed with butter, with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, a pinch of salt and 2 Tbs. flour.  That way you don't get a "tunnel/cave" between the filling and top crust after baking the pie.  After allowing the apple mixture to cool completely, I pour it into the bottom crust, place the top crust,  and egg wash it after fluting the edges.  I make steam vents in the top then sprinkle it with some turbinado sugar.  I bake it in the lower third of the oven for 40 to 50 min.  Perfect every time.

I cheated and used a storebought crust, but the filling was awesome!  My fiance's been wanting an apple pie made with fresh apples, and this one did the trick. Yum!

Following review and rating based on FILLING ONLY- 

To be honest I actually used the "Aunt Carols' Apple Pie" recipe from this site to make me pie, HOWEVER, I had both this and that recipe in my box and the reviews on Aunt Carol's recipe were suggesting so many changes (turns out those changes were much needed) that by the time I made the pie , the filling turned out being almost identical to this recipe instead of Aunt Carol's. 

I've heard a lot that the best apple pie is made from dfferent types of apples, mixed. So I used 2 Granny-Smith, 2 of this red/yellow type (forgot the name), and one red delicious for this recipe. 5 Apples was a perfect amount for my dish. Sugar amount on this recipe is spot on, as well as the lemon juice, flour etc. 

I used the 'French Pastry Pie Crust' pie crust recipe from this site and it was FABULOUS. Normally when I purchase apple pies store-bought I Never eat the outer layer extra crust , even if the pie is warmed up, but not with the flaky delicious crust that recipe makes! Look it up and Try it! 

Baking times for me in this recipe were also perfect and made the apples in my pie cook flawlessly. Not mushy but not too firm. 

I can't speak for the crust in this recpe, but try the filling in this recpe, you cannot go wrong and you wont regret it!

My first time making apple pie from scratch, and it was the most amazing apple pie I've ever had. My family was shocked at how good it was. I did not have shortening, so I used butter for both crust and filling, and it turned out just fine.

My review is for the pie only as I chose to make a different crust. The pie was good, but not special. It called for more apples than I'm generally accustomed to using, so I found it took quite a long time for the pie to be baked long enough.  I found I much prefer a recipe with a few less apples which would then have a more reliable cooking time to see the apples cooked through and the juices bubbing, to ensure that the pie would not be watery. In addition, the recipe reconfirmed for me that I don't particularly care for nutmeg in my apple pies.  I'll continue, once again, to make mine without it.

Two thumbs up! This was super yummy. I didn't have any nutmeg and since it would have added 5 or 6 dollars to the cost I skipped it. I did add half a cup of brown sugar though. I bet the nutmeg would have gone nicely with the pie. I found that 5 large granny smith apples was about 7 cups, however I feel like I could only fit about 5 cups in the deep dish pie crust I bought. I piled the apples about as high as I could have and couldn't use all 7 cups. It did leak all over my oven so I recommend putting some aluminum foil underneath to catch any drippings. Next time I will add the nutmeg...

This is so close to the apple pie that I've been making for close to 50 years. The only difference in the crust is that I use part butter for better flavor. 
For the apples, I like to use Early Golds but realize that they are not readily available everywhere. The others that I've been successful with are combinations of zestar, jonagolds, ginger golds, pink lady and jonathon. I've never understood the Granny Smith recommendations.  They do not cook well and always seem crunchy and sour tasting after the pie is done. If that were my only choice, I would not make apple pie. I also use part  brown sugar for a yummy caramel-like  flavor.

This was my ver first apple pie from scratch and it was Very good, I used a different recipe for the pie crust.  I made this recipe trying to find something similar to my grandmother's apple pie, well it was not my grandma's pie, but it was VERY good.  I used the recipe for Pie Crust I with it.  Would recommend this recipe to anyone who has never made a pie from scratch before.

I think there is a misprint for the crust recipe - I had to add more water than stated and checked other recipes for a single crust and found for two cups of flour that 8 - 10 tbsps of water are required - After adding more water, the crust was so flaky and yummy -

Excellent.  I made alterations based on the reviews, and the pie was incredible. The flavors married perfectly.  I also added a tsp of vanilla to the filling. Alterations are thusly:

Added 1-2tsp. cinnamon and 2 Tbl. of brown sugar to the crust. Used butter instead of Crisco, and 8-10 Tbl. milk instead of water. The filling used 3 types of apples (granny smith, golden delicious, gala). The sugar consisted of equal parts of white and brown. The filling also included a small amount of maple syrup (1/3 cup approx.) and a 1 tsp of vanilla to help "marry" the flavors together (note the nice caramel syrup on the plate (look at photo with a slice of pie and ice cream). Got rave reviews.

I made two of these and they were very tasty. I cheated and used store bought pie crusts for the bottom of the pie and then topped it with the dough from this recipe. I'm not a big pie baker, but this was very easy to do and resulted in very tasty pie...snacking on the one from yesterday at this moment; second one is in the oven right now.

This was my fist attempt at making an apple pie. I wanted a simple recipe. I cheated and used a ready made crust. I followed the filling recipe . I used some really sweet Fiji apples. And it turned out wonderful.

2 Large Rome or Golden Delicious 
2 Gala or Fuji (or 1 Gala 1 Fuji)

This pie was delicious and looked spectacular with a lattace crust.  First time I had tried a lattace top and it had to turn out perfect as I was making it for our Family Christmas Dinner.  It didn't let us down.  I changed nothing except for more water to make the pastry (8 tbsps.) and a sprinkling of sugar over the egg wash just before baking.  Times and temperatures were also right on.

Excellent apple pie filling! I used a combination of Jonagolds and Granny Smith's, and I used the pie crust recipe from Barefoot Contessa (brushed with egg yolk per this recipe's instructions)--turned out perfectly! .html

Oh my goodness this is my FAVORITE recipe for apple pie now. I have tried a few other ones (including Granny Ople's) and by far this the best one! The only thing I did different was follow other reviewers and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and it came out Perfect thus giving credit to its' name. Deleting all other apple pie recipes from my box!

It was great. and I just realized i forgot the lemon juice... (it was still good) The crust was crispy, but I did bake it for 5 min first, as one suggested :) There was slightly not enough dough to cover the pie, so I made stripes... My Friends liked it and told me I should make it again and again :)

This recipe is great! It was my first time making the crust from scratch, and it was absolutely delicious! I did add about 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the apple mixture. I also sprinkled a little bit of sugar and cinnnamon on the top crust. This will defiinitely be a go-to recipe!

The crust for this recipe was nothing special. It was neither light nor flaky.  I even used butter instead of shortening as people recommended.  The filling was even worse.  It was so sweet it was inedible. I felt like my teeth were rotting after one bite.  The sweetness overwhelmed the apples dramatically.  I would not recommend this to anyone who likes apple pie.  It is more like caramel apples in a shell.

I followed the recipe pretty close and it was INCREDIBLE! For apples I used 2 large Granny Smith, 2 large Golden Delicious, and 2 Fuji. I substituted the crust and used the Pie Crust IV recipe on this site because I know that is an incredible crust. The final pie was absolutely perfect.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Was wonderful and the guests destroyed it in a matter of minutes. Next time I will only add one TBSP of butter to dot the pie and lay down foil on the baking pan beneath the pie due to some overflow. the 7 cups thinly sliced apples is around 8 apples (I used 4 gala and 4 honeycrisp).

Best apple pie ever.  The perfect mix of everything.  Not too much and not too little.  Not too heavy or too syrupy.  We used Jonathan apples and it was perfect.  Its my new go to recipe for apple pie.

Excellent!  Made just as it (but used my own crust recipe) - times were great and I used freshly picked red apples from a nearby orchard... I can definitely see how Granny Smith's would be way too tart, so just use red or a blend.  YUMMY!!!!

The actual pie was WONDERFUL!  So tasty.  The crust was awful.  It fell apart, cracked, and was way too dry and crumbly.  I ended up using my normal pie crust for it.

This is the best apple pie recipe I've found.  The crust is ALWAYS flaky, (I add 4 tbsp. of water all at once) and it's just yummy!  The only complaint I have is, I have to double the crust to I have enough dough.  My dad and husband ate almost the entire pie (except 1 slice that I had) in an evening!  It was that good.

This pie filling was delicious, though I actually used a different recipe for the crust.  I added a little extra lemon juice, as well as a 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves, and the flavor was wonderful.  The only thing I wished that this recipe had mentioned was to wait for 15-20 minutes before cutting the pie; it needs to cool a little before being cut to avoid it being soupy.

My first time making a homemade apple pie and it came out perfect! I used all granny smith apples and the "best ever pie crust" recipe from this site. (i love that flaky pie crust recipe!) I added the 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to a bowl of water and let the apple slices soak while I got my other ingredients together. The changes I made to the filling mixture were: 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar as others suggested, 1 tsp. of vanilla and a 1/4 tsp of salt.  I sprinkled some of the dry ingredient mixture on the bottom of the pie crust before I added the apples and vanilla to it. I did not brush the top with egg yolk.

Like dessert at an historical New England inn in late October. It is, indeed, almost too sweet; you could drop the sugar and still have a five-star pie. My one mistake was that I tried to cut it right out of the oven and thecrust collapsed a bit. Let it cool (this will take great self-restraint). Magnificent with whipped cream.

made granny opals and this pie, and really loved this one!  granny opals isn't bad but you have to like the caramel type sauce in the pie which i'm not a fan of.  when I made this the other night it was gone in no time!  making another one in a few minutes and i use Pillbury ready made crusts which are simply amazing for box crusts!

I am only reviewing the crust of this pie as I had gala apples and didn't want to add too much sugar, so I had to change things around a bit. The crust is the PERFECT one for apple pie. I used 8-9 tablespoons of cold water though, not 4 and did it all in my food processor. I had enough left over from half to make a lattice top and still have half left over for another pie. Thankyou! My search for the perfect crust ends.

So, so very good!  This is by far the best apple pie I have ever had.  I made this for Thanksgiving & everyone raved about how good it was. I made just a few changes to the recipe-used 2 Fuji apples, 2 Granny smith, and 2 Golden Delicious.  I ended up having a little bit of extra apples-but the different kinds turned out tasting great!  I will def. be making this one again!

the name says it all. it is a perfect apple pie. I hadn't made a pie in years. this year I got a bumper crop of apples, so I made this recipe for a church function, was a little nervous, but the pie was a hugh hit.

This is quite likely the only recipe for apple pie that I'll ever use again. I did not use the crust recipe, but the filling was so simple and just tasted amazing! I love Dutch Apple Pie, so the only thing I might do differently in the future is to make a crumb topping to cover. Thank you for sharing!

This really is a wonderful recipe. I followed a previous user's advice on how many of which apples to use (2 granny smith,2 Fuji and 2-3 golden delicious) and the filling is perfect every time. One of these days I'll actually make the crust and not cheat with the pre-made!

This is perfect! I didn't have time to make my own dough,so I used a store bought pie crust for the bottom. And I toped it with a crumb mixture of 1/2 a cup of brown sugar,1 cup of flour and a stick of softened butter. Thanks Judy! :)(:

I made this pie again tonight -- I always seem to come back to it after trying other recipes (including ones on this site) that don't come close to matching this one.  I added 1/4 t. salt to the filling (salt is mentioned in the directions, but not the ingredients list in the recipe) and used Barefoot Contessa's pie crust, but I will never again make another apple pie filling besides this one.  This is it!

My first apple pie, and it turned out perfect!  in fact, my DH told me that it was the best apple pie he's ever had!  I used refrigerated pie crust and 8 apples (1/2 granny smith, 1/2 honeycrisp).  I also sprinkled sugar and cinnamon over the top before baking.  The only negative about this recipe is that I can't stop eating it! :)

I split the sugar: 1/2 cup white, 1/2 brown and included a tsp. of vanilla. Unfortunately I forgot to add the butter. 7 apples were plenty = 5 stars.

The all-time best recipe for apple pie! I have made this time & time again and always get compliments. This recipe is SO good, you can even make it with margarine in place of butter and it turns out just as fantastic!

I am a few changes.  I added 1/4 tps of  ground ginger.  In addition, to make the recipe "no sugar added", I used 1/2 cup sweetener and 1/2 cup brown sugar substitute sweetener (because i am diabetic) in place of the sugar and brown sugar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  The pie came out perfect and was delicious.

This pie was amazing.  I usually don't bake pies, but my family liked it so much I cooked it fro my grandparents.  Anyone who loves a traditional pie but also loves to be unique, they should definately bake this pie.

My 1st try at apple pie and it came out beautifully! Many said it was the best apple pie they'd ever had! I used Granny Smith apples fresh off our tree. Knowing our tree grows them a bit tart I added 3 extra tbs of sugar and it came out ust right. I also cut down the butter to 1 tbs. Great recipe with some fresh whip cream!

To the reader who wants a sweeter apple pie, honeycrisp apples stay firm and cook well in a pie. Most sweeter apples turn to mush when cooked.

First time I have ever baked an apple pie and it came out wonderfully.. (with the help of a reviewer below who added her ideas as well.).  I'd like it to be a little bit sweeter - and to this end I'd just say to add another type of apple.  I used Green and Gala - but not in equal portions...more Green.  Use more Gala or Red Delicious or whatever is sweeter if that's what you like.  Sure it will be great. Oh yeah, I cut out the butter too (just forgot it really). But having said that, it came out just perfectly fine without.  Why add the extra fat?  It's not necessary at all.  Good luck!

This pie is so easy to make! I don't always make the crust and use store bought depending on the time I have. I also sometimes add a crumble mixture to the top.

This is the easiest apple pie I have ever made.  I have had more requests for this recipe than anything I have ever baked.  I do add more cinnamon and use a store bought crust to save time.  I have frozen so many apple pies to see us through the winter months due to the abundance of apples on our trees.  Try it; you won't use any other recipe.

This recipe makes little to no sense. A cup of sugar is an absurd amount, it made the pie watery. Really, really watery. Cooking on a high temp and then a low made the crust burn. The pie was so watery and heavy that it made my pie pan collapse into a mess on the floor. Even if the pie had survived, it was so soggy and sugary that it wasn't even appetizing.

This is delightful.  I switched it up with 4 cups of apples and 3 cups of blueberries.  Everything else was the same. My wife told me that it's hands down the most delightful pie that I've ever made (and I like making pie).  I would recommend it!

I was hesitate to try this recipe because it doesn't use a pre-made crust. Luckily, the crust was delicious! It was a little dry which made it pretty hard with but, it still came out. Aside from that, it was incredible!

I do not know what to say. It seemed easy enough untill I need to roll the dough out. What a pain! OMGosh I have never had problems like this before. Could it be something here in Houston? URGH! I tryed (after following the recipe to the "t" more ice water more flour...nothing seemed to work. Instead of the normal time it takes to put together the pie (with rolling the dough) I could have made 2 more...(a little funny but still just fustrating).

I made this pie last night, using danielle's suggestion of 2 Granny Smith, 2 Golden Delicious and 2 Fuji apples.  I used my own crust recipe, but did everything else the same, and served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. My husband remarked that it was the best apple pie he'd ever had.  My gourmet chef mother-in-law agreed.  That's quite a compliment!  I will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

When I first started putting the pie together I was not sure I would like this recipe, because the pie crust was a little difficult to work with. However, after following the recipe to the T, and it did come out PERFECT. This recipe has the correct name of "Perfect Apple Pie." I made this for dinner guest and each one commented on how wonderful it tasted. The crust was flaky and perfect, and the filling had the perfect amount of sweetness. I served with Vanilla ice cream. Also, I used Granny Smith apples, and it was delicious!

My boyfriend loves apple pie.  I made a similar recipe to this one and it came out watery and soggy (even after baking it 20 min longer than directed).  So, I was determined to try again and salvage my dignity!  This recipe turned out much better with the following adjustments:  I added almost 3/4 cup flour, substituted 1/2 dark brown sugar, and added 2 more T of butter.  It looks beautiful, is not too sweet and ISN'T soggy.

Excellent!  Used a store bought pie crust as they generally taste as delicious as homemade and are decidedly easier.  Used 4 Granny Smiths and the rest Fuji apples and added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg--you can never have enough!  We will definitely see this at future fall family gatherings.

OMG where do I begin!  This was my first apple pie and it was fantastic.  I admit I cheated and used a rollout store bought crust but the pie itself was delicious!  My family couldn't get enough.  They used to love pumpkin but I think we have a new favorite one!

Loved loved loved the crust. It just melted in your mouth. The filling was very good but as others would say a little tart. I used 3 granny smith and 3 golden del., next time I will just use 1 or 2 granny smiths and the rest something not so tart next time. I also did not have any nutmeg so I through in some all spice instead. First time and it wasn't as hard as people warned me. Very messy though!!!

This is a wonderful basic apple pie recipe.  I've made it several times now with excellent results.  I normally use a blend of Granny Smith and gala or Fugi apples.  Also, I find the crust to be very easy to assemble and work with (usually I'm terrible at crusts).  This is definitely my "go-to" recipe for pie.

I always make 2 apple pies,some family like tart and this is it. In answer to others the trick to a good pie is to mix golden or yellow apples with red more tart apples together. The sweetness of one offsets the tartness of the other and less sugar. My family likes cheddar cheese slice melted on top in mirowave just before serving.

OMG!  Such a good apple pie recipe!  The only one I will ever use.  In fact this is what I am taking for my dessert for Thanksgiving.  I used 4 different types of apples, 2 each.  And the sweetness of some balanced out the tartness of the other......

This is the best apple pie I have ever made. followed the recipe exactly.  Did not use the crust part though I was pressed for time.  I used store crust. We went up to ellajay (north GA Mtns.) to the apple farms and brought back a heepen helpen of apples.  I used Arkansas Black apples which are a perfect baking apple.  Turned out wonderful.  Thanks

Yay! This recipe turned out perfectly for me (and I'm not the most experienced piemaker in the world). I used 1/2 Granny Smith and 1/2 Honey Crisp apples and really liked the way it turned out.  Great consistency, not overly sweet, perfect with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first attempt at baking an apple pie and it was a complete success.  It was very easy.  Be sure to put a cookie sheet covered with foil under your pie to avoid a mess in your oven and for easy clean up of cookie sheet.  I used gala, empire, and granny smith apples.

This pie turned out perfect!  I had about a dozen small green apples off our trees, the only thing I changed was I used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Topped with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream...perfect summer time dessert!

I make about 12-14 apple pies a year for our church Bingo and have quite a "following".  I never use only one kind of apple - always a mixture. I have an 85 yr-old man at my Farmers' Market that bags me up a mixture of various apples and I always get rave reviews.  I don't like nutmeg, so I only use the 1 tsp of cinnamon (heaped up a little). Other than that, this recipe is quite similar to mine.  I always make my own crust.  I only ever made one pie (strawberry)with store-bought crust and it went right in the trash can.

I made this pie in my culinary class and it took me nearly half the day and made me skip a few classes. It was one of the hardest things fo a begginner like me to make, but I came through as some friendly girls in the class decided to help me finish it. It ended up coming out spectacular and it was shared among a large group of people.The girl who helped me in making it said she's tasted better but I thought it tasted absolutely delicious! I wouldn't recommend making it in Culinary class if you don't have any experience making it (since the recipe made it kind of tricky for me as I messed up the dough multiple times), but if you feel like baking something speacial this would be a good choice!

I've always wanted to make an amazing apple pie that would "wow" the family. This pie was above and beyond what I expected We all LOVED it, and I will definitely be making it again. The only thing I did differently was use a ready-made pie crust.

I used 2 and a half cups flour, 2/3 cup vegetable oil,  2 tablespoons butter and 2/3 cup cold water, 1 tsp salt and 2 tbsps sugar..This makes a tasty flaky, crunchy crust.  The filling is perfect as is.  My family loves it!  I also made lattice crust to make it more appealing!

This was the first time I ever made apple pie, I actually do not bake much at all and was a little nervous.  My family LOVED this pie!  I used 3 Golden Delicious and 3 Empire apples and it was perfect.  This will definitely be my specialty for years to come...thank you!

This is the first time, I make an apple pie.  I enjoyed it Only thing that I would like to know is what amount of salt to include to the recipe.  This information was forgotten.  I put in 1/2 tsp.

Only used recipe for filling since I used another yummy recipe for the crust. Instead of adding cinnamon and nutmeg I used an all spice seasoning. Loved adding the lemon juice, it really added a zing to the pie. Absolutely delicious!

yum yum yum yum yum!!!!  I have made apple pie only one other time than this recipe, and it was just ok, so I didn't bother trying again.  But I am sure glad I tried this recipe.  Perfect flaky crust and yummy inside.  I followed recipe exactly except I added about 1/2 cup brown sugar to the filling.  And I didn't put salt in the filling although the directions say too yet there is no measurement for it. I used Jonagold and cameo apples leftover from the apple orchard.  I will definitely make this again.  It will be a favorite!

Even though the crust did not look great (First time making pie crust) the pie tasted AMAZING!! I did do the 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, but otherwise followed the exact recipe. I will be making this again very soon! There is no need to look further for an apple pie recipe, this is it!

This pie was AMAZING. I wasn't sure what apples I was using (boyfriend and I had gone to the apple orchard) but the filling turned out PERFECT! (Although, side-note, at first it was quite runny and soupy, but as the pie cooled it gelled up perfectly. But who has the patience to wait for that?)  I'll also use this crust recipe over and over for other pies - it was just the right amount to make a top and bottom crust.

I just used this recipe this past weekend and it was my first time ever making an kind of pie from scratch and my husband said it was the best apple pie he ever had!  I used Golden Delicious apples though.  I made two pies one I used Granny smith and it was a bit too tart even though I added about 1/4 cup more sugar (from suggestions).  So I used the Golden Delicious for the second pie and added the 1/4 cup more sugar and it was super perfect!  Thank you for your recipe.

FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe for the crust with all my pies and it is perfection. It crumbles so great. I used Red Delicious, but it was too rich for me. When I used Granny Smith, it didn't even need vanilla ice cream! I bring them to the school I work at and bribed everyone!

Nice...  Good spice blend, nicely crisp/softened apples, nicely juicy/firm filling.  Altogether excellent.  Used 50/50 Fuji and Granny Smiths, as suggested by another review, but used my own crust recipe.  Thanks Judy!

This really is a perfect apple pie! I used pie crust sheets instead of making my own but used the filling recipe AS IS - you can't miss with this pie, it's delicious!

IMPORTANT NOTE - I've made this pie EXACTLY as the recipe is written several times since my 2010 review - ALWAYS with perfect results. The only thing I've altered is the amount of sugar - if you're using a sweet apple, Gala is my preferred, you can  reduce sugar amount according to sweetness of the apple you're using. I reduce by approximately 1/4 cup when using a "sweet" apple. Still absolutely perfect pie!

This is my 3rd time using this recipe and Followed Recipe to a T. The first time i made my own crust just because I hadn't before. 2nd time I bought pillsbury boxed dough, and this time (for those who dont like the mess)  Pre rolled, which still tastes wonderful. I use 2 big Granny apples and 3 of these beautiful reddish/yellow ones... For those not wanting too tart a pie:  mixing the apples made sweet and tart.  *Also, last time around to my horror I was out of nutmeg and in desperation substituted with "Allspice". Nobody noticed and I still got raves!

This was my first apple pie and I have to say it turned out really good! I used red delicious apples (for a sweeter pie) and I also omitted the lemon juice and the nutmeg (because I didn't have them).  It was very easy, but very messy to make. The only part that gave me a little trouble was the crust and I think that was my fault because I used more on the bottom and didn't have a lot for the top. All in all, I will definitely make this again.

For the love of pete... this was a great pie.  I recommend using Pink Lady apples for a sweet apple pie with a hint of tang in which the apples still hold their texture well.    I totally cheated and used Pillsbury's pie crust, which worked out just fine.  After dabbing on the margarine, I sprinkled on a couple TBSP of brown sugar. and then after washing the top crust with the egg wash, I sprinkled a little white sugar on top, but not much.

Very good apple pie flavor! I did not use this crust recipe, but rather Ina Garten's Perfect Pie Crust, which is my all time fave crust for any pie, so I cannot rate the crust. The filling was perfect, though, and this will be my "go to" recipe from now on :)

This pie was an extreme disappointment.  It is the pie crust that is difficult.  I followed the directions and the dough came out crumbly and so I decided to give it another try and dumped the first batch.  Second try, same exact problem.  I tried everything to get this to work.  I should have just stopped and bought pillsbury pie dough in the sheets- That might have saved this apple pie the day before Thanksgiving.  Right now cooked but NO top.  Managed to mangle together the bottom crust-

I don't like apple pie, but my husband does.  He now requests me to use the same recipe as last time. Always WONDERFUL so he says.

Lowered sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar.  (I'm not a member of the "sweet apple pie" club!)  When you slice the apples this thin, it creates a lot of juice and the pie may may cook down in the center.  Overall, very solid apple pie.

This pie is perfect, great crust and filling.  And for those that say it is too tart- If you are using tart apples omit the lemon juice, and if you are using sweet apples follow the recipe. Simple as that.

This really is the perfect apple pie.  I made my crusts using the recipe on the shortening package and followed the pie filling recipe to a T.  It was a total hit. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed other suggestions and ised a mixed variety of tart and sweet apples.  I also used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar, which provided that right amount of sweet for my family.  This is the best apple pie I have ever made and will be my go to receipe from now on.

To all those that do not like TART! pies, like me.  I use a combination of Tart & Sweet apples.  Last time I used 4 Jonamac and 3 Honey Crisp.  I am trying this recipe today with all Jonamac.

This turned out great!!  I made it the day before and baked it the day of.  I had to add just a little more water, very little to get my crust right, and I sprinkled a little cinammon on top of the crust.

This was enjoyable. Simple flavors in my opinion always work best. I ran out of nutmeg and used pumpkin pie spice instead, which was actually a refreshing change. I did add more cinnamon to taste to make up for not wanting to overpower the apples with the pumpkin pie spice. I could see myself making this again, it was the perfect pie for my dad who doesn't like things too sweet!

Very good and simple. I used a ready made crust to save some time and effort and sprinkled it with crystal sugar after the egg wash to add some crunch to the crust. Used a combination of Granny Smith and golden delicious apples which produced a perfect filling for us in terms of sweetness. Thanks for the recipe!

This apple pie is perfection personified !!  It is truly awesome and the best best best apple pie I have ever had.  The crust is super flaky.  I made some changes to this recipe and did the following:  I added a teaspoon of white sugar and a teaspoon of brown sugar to the crust ingredients to give it more flavor and a zing.  I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the apples for thickness. I did not use nutmeg and replaced it with 2 tablespoons of cinnamon to apple mixture.  I did not brush the top of the crust with egg yolk.  I used canola oil for the shortening and I used McIntosh and Granny Smith Apples and the flavor is incredible. I would highly recommend this recipe.  You will not be disappointed in the least.  I applaud Judy for this wonderful recipe...whether it is her own or someone else's !!  Happy Eating !

This recipe is fantastic.  I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 a cup of brown sugar(packed) instead of just the cup of white sugar.  Was extremely good and now I am the go to guy for apple pies for partys.

I've been trying different apple pie recipes for over three years and this one is definitely a favorite.  I have finally settled on using Braeburn apples in my pies, which are delicious.  I use a little less sugar than 1 cup when I use the Braeburn though versus Granny Smith.

The apples tasted nice, but the filling was too watery and the pie fell apart as soon as I cut into it. Also, the crusts were soggy..maybe one should precook them first.

Absolutely, this recipe produces the best apple pie that I have ever eaten!  My husband could not wait to eat it after lunch and he ate a large slice before lunch today.  Also, I did listen to the advice given by two reviewers in which they recommend to replace one of the two cups of white sugar for one cup of brown sugar.  I also added a teaspoon of salt to the apple filling.  Fantastic!

DELICIOUS! I usually forgo making the crust and buy the ready-made roll out type and it works just as well. I also use a combination of different apples and slice them thin. Make sure you let the pie sit for a few hours after removing it from the oven - has a tendancy to be a bit watery inside if you don't let it sit long enough. I love this recipe and make it often. Yum!

Not even sure if I've rated this before... but I have made this in the past and gave it to my boyfriend's family. He left for a few days and told me he never got to try it. So, since today I'm bored I went hunting for a pie recipe and realized that I've made this one. So i figured I might as well thank you :)

This recipe was SOOO good!!!  I did make a few changes though...we didn’t have any apples so I used a quart of homemade applesauce.  I had to add an extra ¼ c. flour to thicken it just a little.  I also didn’t use the egg yolk and water on the crust...After I pulled it from the oven I spread just a little bit of melted butter on it and then sprinkled it with just a little white sugar...all I can say was it was DELICIOUS!!

Making the pie crust was difficult for me because I'd never done it before. I think I'll opt for refrigerated crusts from here on out. Faster, easier and not THAT different in taste. But the filling was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I used 2 Honey Crisp, 2 Granny Smith, 1 Gala and 1 Fuji apple. I found that the mixture of textures and flavors made this recipe really awesome!

I've always been pretty reluctant in making anything but apple crisps in store baked pie shells. I finally worked up the courage to try a full apple pie from scratch. Well, this IS the PERFECT apple pie!  Crust was tender and flaky and filling was the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. I used galas and cortland apples. Mmmmmm mmmmmm gooood to the last bite!

I made this for Thanksgiving, followed it exactly, and when I cut into the pie it was full of liquid!  I've never made an apple pie before so I'm wondering what I did wrong.  I followed one review and used 1 honey crisp, 2 granny smith, 2 golden and 2 fuji.

This was my first time ever making an apple pie, and it was awesome. I've never even liked apple pie, I made it for my husband, and I ate half of it! I used Granny Smith, Fuji, Gala, and Braeburn apples, and added 2 tablespoons of whiskey as another recipe suggested. I also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, and a premade crust.

My husband committed to cooking an apple pie for thanksgiving so of course that meant I had to make it... my first EVER.  I did cheat and buy pillsbury pie curst tho, so my raiting is just on the filling.  I took others advice and added brown sugar ( I added 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and my 2nd attempt I used 1 cup cane sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar).  RAVE reviews came from both my mother in law and my aunt whom are very strong food critiques!

This is almost identical to the recipe my mother has used for 30+ years. The only difference is that we always use McIntosh apples because they are much softer and have more sweetness to them. They are a little bit smaller, so we use about 8. Other than that, this recipe is top notch!!

This was the first time I had ever made a pie, and this one turned out just okay. I probally wont make it again it was not sweet enought for my family even though I added more sugar and no lemon juice. Also you must use at least 8 tablespoons of water, four just doesnt cut it.

If you want a sweeter pie, use red apples.  Also, you can switch to Splenda which is sweeter than sugar to make it less tart.  But if you switch to Splenda, you need to follow the conversion chart to see how much Splenda to use.

I've made this recipe twice. The differences that I think made the recipe work well for me were to chill the dough as a whole, remove it, cut the dough in half, roll each ball to about half an inch thick and chill it again. I also used a convection oven once as opposed to a conventional oven which of course gave me a more evenly cooked crust.  Everybody knows crusts can be tricky but you cannot go wrong with this filling!

Great recipe!  I used 4 Granny Smith and 4 Gala apples as I think a pie with all Granny Smith is too tart.  Yum!

I'm not a fan of apple pie by any means but we went apple picking on Saturday so I had to do something. Plus DS loves apple pie. According to him as well as a few others that had this, it was delicious but a little too heavy on the cinnamon. That may be my fault since halfway through making, I realized I was out of nutmeg and tried substituting pumpkin pie spice instead. I also used a a ready made Pillsbury crust. Will be making another pie this week since we have a ton of apples and this time will make sure I have nutmeg and may also cut back on the cinnamon just a little bit. Overall got rave reviews and the bonus was how nice the house smelled while it was baking!

This was my first time making an apple pie from scratch and it turned out incredible!! I used fresh apples from my grandmothers tree and the flavor and sweetness was superb!! Although the crust was a little hard to maneuver. Other than that-  5 STARS!!

Awesome Recipe!  I did make a few changes though. It needs more water to the crust for sure.  Also I added a pinch of ground cloves made for a great taste!

This is a great recipe. My mom is famous for her apple pie recipe and this is quite comparable. I didn't add enough flour though so the filling was a little runny. Otherwise very good.

This was super easy and SUPER DELISH!  This was my first homemade pie since home ec.  I used a 10" pie dish and it worked fine.  I used 7 apples:  2 Granny Smith, 2 Breaburn, 1 Fuji, 1 Jazz, and 1 Cameo.  Grandma always told me to mix 'em up, so I did.  This recipe is a keeper!

I confess I purchased a rolled pie crust.  The filling was divine.  It was a little sweet--not over the top.  Perfect.  I used two huge granny smiths, two gala, and two cortlands.  My pie pan is a 9" deep dish.  I could have used another apple.  It was just barely level below the fluted edge of the crust.  After the pie baked, I let it rest uncovered until almost cool. Then, I covered it with aluminum foil.  The next afternoon we ate the pie. Everyone loved it.  Next time I'll try the crust.

Perfect - just like the name says! I know there has been some debate about what apples to use, and I love things sweet, but I used Granny Smith and thought it was excellent. Very straightforward, not runny - which I always seem to have a problem with... Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe!  I used the 'Perfect Pie Crust' recipe for the pie crust and this recipe for the filling.  Also I used 3 different types of apples - 2 granny smith, 2 golden delicious, and 3 honey crisp.  It tastes great!  I may add another apple the next time around.  I let it set for a couple of hours before I cut into it and the filling wasn't watery at all.

This was the best apple pie ever.  Everybody loved it.  I used fresh Melrose apples from an orchard.  I will experiment with different types of apples and see what else works well.

First Apple Pie that everyone really liked....Still getting compliments. I made my own crust from another recipe. If you can find Large Honey Crisp Apples, use them, they are a newer variety, but soooo much better to bake with. Usually find them at a Country Market Store rather than grocery store. Enjoy!

I have no idea what I did wrong... I'm always careful to follow new recipes to the "T"... But... My crust was so dry it was falling apart. I had to piece it together to cover the bottom of my pie pan, and it looked horrible when I put it on the top in pieces... The filling tastes fine, but the crust even after baking was not what it should have been... I will use this recipe again, but maybe just buy a crust. My husband loved it, but thought I was going crazy  crying over a pie crust lol... Good recipe, I just can't figure it out.

I put the yolk into the pie mixture because the apple from my tree tend to be very juicy!  I rubbed the top crust with butter and then baked it!  It was great!  This will be my new recipe for sure!
