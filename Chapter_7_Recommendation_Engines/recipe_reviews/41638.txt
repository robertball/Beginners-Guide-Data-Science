I loved this recipe, even my strictly carnivorous boyfriend enjoyed it.  I brush the outside of the tortillas with a olive oil-lime juice mixture before throwing them in the oven and left them there for a little longer than the recipe called for.  I garnished the tacos with some pico de gallo, chili peppers and sour cream.

This is a good idea, but it's a little boring as is. It's not much more than guacamole in a tortilla. I love avocados and eat them plain all the time, but if they're in a taco, I'd like to have other ingredients, such as tomato, lettuce, and maybe some black beans.

I thought this recipe was bland, but fun to play with. I added some shredded cheese to the tortillas and then warmed them. I added some chopped onion and tomato, and lemon juice to the avacado mixture. I also serve them with mexican rice. my hubby, and 16 month old love them, and so do I!!

While everyone else was eating their beef tacos, I was thoroughly enjoying the avacado version. I'm addicted to avacados and thought these were terrific. I used green onions, a can of mild green chiles and topped it with shredded cheddar. Delicious and thanks Karyn!

My husband and I love these tacos! I had some plain, with just the avocado mixture and I had some with stir-fry steak strips, just 2-3 strips per taco, and less than 1/2 pound if steak altogether. I also added more like 1/2 cup of onion. Very tasty!

This recipe is so light and perfect for a warm summer night.  I would definitely make sure to use the jalapeno pepper sauce, it brings out all of the flavors wonderfully, but without it, the dish is very plain.  However, I gave this 4 stars(which it really was a border line 3-4, but since i personally liked it, i bumped it up to 4)because my family wasn't very impressed.  My husband felt that there was something missing, and didn't think that guacamole smeared on top of corn tortillas with a little sauce, was a gerat meal idea.  I could definatley see his point. Although I had no qualms making a meal of it, my girls hardly touched it. I really can't see myself making an entree out of this dish either, mainly because I think the key to this dish being successful is completely reliant on who you're serving it to. If you love avacado and are perfectly happy with a simple, light dish, than I would recommend it.

all things considered, with modification, this could be much better. sorry - i just wasn't impressed, and as a vegetarian married to a carnivore, i'm always on the lookout for things i can make for myself when i cook up tacos.

This recipe has fast become a favorite of ours, I have made it 3 times now since I found on the site.  I have utilized some of the tips from other members.  I add lime juice, garlic powder, cumin and 1/2 can of mild chili peppers to the avocado and the other 1/2 of can to vegetarian refried beans.  I heat the shells over a flame on the stove, then stack like a taco with beans, avocado mix, fresh cilantro, tomatoes, onions, black olives, lettuce and ranch dressing or hot sauce.  My husband asks for these weekly!  Quite a suprise since his first response was very questionable.  Easy to make for a quick and easy dinner!

This is a nice starter for a recipe, but for me not complete. I followed the recipe (minus the jalapenos) but then added tomatoes, cheddar cheese, black beans and some fresh squeezed lime. With the additions to it, I thought it was great.

Wow, this was great!!  We just finished dinner, and I had to write a review.  My husband, a meat and potato kind of guy, really enjoyed this!  I did make a few adjustments.  After reading some reviews I used pinto beans, I added garlic salt to the beans instead of the tacos.  I also used green onion, instead regular onion.  I chopped the avocado, I think next time I will mash some of it.  We also squeezed a slice of lime over the top of the taco.  Oh, and after reading one review, I took olive oil, about 1/3 cup, and the juice of one lime, and a half teaspoon of salt and mixed it together, then brushed that over the tortillas and warmed them in a cast iron skillet.  This could also be done in the oven.  They were not greasy, but they were soft and had wonderful flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!  We served fresh watermellon with it, and it was a wonderful cool dinner on a hot day.

I thought this was awesome. As a new vegetarian, it was so filling and I didn't miss the taco meat at all!! The avocado mixture was delicious. I coarsely chopped romaine lettuce and made pico de gallo with tomatoes, red onion and cilantro and black beans with garlic salt. I made it look just like the picture- even though that was not in the recipe. DELICIOUS!!!!! Your family will love it too!!

Really delicious--a nice vegetarian alternative to tacos with meat filing.  The fresh cilantro is really the key to this.  I added a bit of chopped tomato to the avacado mixture and it turned out great!

This was delicious! I laughed at first when I saw the recipe and thought, big deal a tortilla topped with guacamole minus the tomatoes. However, it tasted great! I scaled it down to about 2 servings. I used 1 large Nature's Promise brand tortilla, 1 mashed avacado with the garlic salt, about 1 Tblsp. of "minced" onion, and the cilantro garnish. I didn't add the jalapeno sauce at the end. I also didn't see the point of heating up the oven to warm 1 tortilla so I microwaved it until lightly warm. It really didn't need any other ingredients either. It reminded me of the guacamole on the cheese quesadillas at some Mexican restaurants. Simple but flavorful.

This was really, really good. I had some leftover Cilantro Tomato Corn Salad (from this site-a good pico) and added that on top along with some cheese. Excelent!

I love avocados, but this is pretty boring. I have ordered guacamole tacos at our local taqueria but they throw in cabbage, pico de gallo, and queso fresco. If I try this again, I'd definitely add to it.

I give it 5 stars for the idea; however it was the picture that grabbed my attention, which is nothing like the recipe.  The picture shows black beans and tomatoes, ingredients that aren't called for.  So, I created my own veggie tacos and they were insane.  Topped it off with cilantro lime dressing and even my meat-eating husband liked it.  So thanks for the idea!

Yummy!  I fried my corn tortillas in a little oil instead of baking to make it more tostada like, and didn't have the jalapeno sauce so I used some habanero tabasco I had.  Delicious and simple!

Pretty plain and why doesn't the picture match the ingredients?  Black beans and tomatoes..? Ok as is for an appetize,r but with beans and a few other typical taco veggies, plus cheese, sour cream and lime juice makes a lovely meal.

I have to agree with other that this recipe is rather...basic. I didn't feel like going the healthy route by heating them in the oven. Rather, I deep fried those suckers ( the corn tortillas) to get them crispy. I also added canned (rinsed and drained too) black beans, lettuce, and diary-free mozzerella cheese substitute (Follow Your Heart Vegan Gourmet- which is available at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's). My non veg husband helped himself to 4 of them! We thought this was a great base recipe to give us endless possibilities.

These were yummy and a great alternative to the basic taco. I fried my corn tortillas for a minute on each side and I cooked some black beans and onion with a little cumin. I put the beans, avocado, tomato, cheese, cilantro and some spinach on each tortilla and baked for about 5 minutes, just long enough to warm it all up. I will definitely make this again, maybe add more spices to zip it up a bit.

These were great, but you can’t have just avocados and onions on tortillas all by itself.  It isn’t even guacamole unless you add the tomato!  I added tomato to mine and then warm refried beans which made it excellent!

Yummy meatless tacos!  I love the hint to warm the corn tortillas in the oven.  I thought the only way to get them not to tear was to give them a quick dip in hot oil.  I will be using corn tortillas more from now on.

This recipe sounded a little bland, but it was delic!  I split the call for garlic between garlic salt and garlic powder, used quite a bit more jalapeno sauce, and topped with shredded cabbage.  Will definately make this again- so quick, easy, and tasty.

I added a little Rotel and lime juice, exed the cilantro only because we didn't have any. Made beans and rice for the topper and grated some cheese. Everyone really liked it!

I made these last night. I followed some of the suggestions and made a few substitutions to the recipe. For seasoning I added cumin and chilli powder, and heated the tortillas in a frying pan coated with cooking spray. These came out yummy.

I really loved this simple dish.  You could add jalapenos to it to give it a kick.  I added a dash of rooster sauce and it was perfect.  This is a great vegetarian find.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I used canned seasoned black beans; cubed, not mashed, avocados, diced tomatoes, cilantro, and sour cream. Very basic, but a great combination of flavors. Definitely a new favorite!

These tacos are a great idea, and excellent in theory, but it didn't translate well to my tastebuds.  Meaning, I wasn't THAT impressed with the actual recipe.  But I WOULD recommend starting with warm corn tortillas, slathering with your FAVORITE guac recipe, then adding all your favorite taco toppings.  Enjoy with a nice cold margarita! :)

Back when I was eating meat, tacos were one of my favorite dinners.  Now that I'm a vegetarian, I've been looking for a suitable replacement, and found that here!  I did make some changes to the recipe.  I sliced the avocado instead of mashing it, sliced the onion instead of dicing, and added diced tomatoes, jalapenos, and shredded monteray jack cheese.  I also left out the garlic salt.  The resulting dish is now my FAVORITE summertime meal!  This recipe is a great base and very versatile, so it's easy to change each time you make it (sometimes, depending on my mood, I also add some black beans or refried beans).  Definitely recommend for any vegetarians!

This dish needs something extra. Throw in some leftover chicken, refried beans, or tomatoes to liven it up. A great dish to have on hand for the vegetarian at your next taco dinner.

VERY AMATUERISH RECIPE, BUT A GOOD SPRINGBOARD.  THE PHOTO DOES NOT MATCH THE RECIPE THOUGH.  IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BLACK BEANS AND TOMATOES, WHICH I WOULD RECOMMEND. ADD SOME LITE SOURCREAM AND SOME CHEDDAR CHEESE AS WELL AS YOUR GOOD TO GO. ADD SOME LEMON OR LIME TO THE AVOCADO TO PREVENT IT FROM BROWNING.

Pretty good-it is like guacamole as taco filling so I added some Mexican cheese to make it more filling and I may add some beans or something next time.  As is, I think it makes a better snack than meal.  Very tasty though-thanks!!

Good recipe, but too much like guacamole. I added a little lime juice and tomato to the tacos as well. Instead of making the the tacos filled with the avocado spread alone, I did a 50/50 mix where I made half like a guacamole dip and then kept the other half of the avocados sliced and not mashed to give a little more consistency to the taco. My fiance is a meat-eater, so he appreciated the sliced avocado, making it seem like he was eating something more "hearty"!

I loved these.  Avocados are one of my fave foods.  I only had about 5 minutes to throw dinner together and these were perfect.  I didn't have time to chop an onion (and I'm not a big fan of raw onions anyway) so I used a sprinkle of dry onion flakes.  I did use the cilantro and sprinkled the hot sauce right into the avocado mixture.  I lightly fried some chipotle tortillas in a little canola oil insted of using corn tortillas.  Served with shredded cheddar, chopped tomatoes, and nice crunchy romaine.  I really enjoyed this meal.

Firstly, I'd like to say that this recipe has a lot of potential. I followed the recipe exactly when making the avocado mixture, and it's definitely not bad. It's pretty much guacamole, and while it's on the plainer side, it's still enjoyable. After trying it as is, I added hot sauce, tomato, & lime juice. I couldn't really get behind having tacos with only guac for filling, and I knew that going into this, so I  made a corn, spinach, yellow squash, onion, and black bean fajita mixture and used that & some cheese to accompany the avocado mixture. Really delicious!

This is basically a taco with guacamole as the filling. Its quite good as a very light lunch or snack but it doesn't have a lot of heft...the flavors are quite good but If you want this as a meal I would recommend adding some black beans to make it more filling. Thanks for sharing!

As is, I would rate the recipe four stars - but it does make a great base recipe to adjust to individual taste. I made these for lunch today with a  blend of tomato and onion (basically a pico de gallo once the cilantro was mixed in), with some garlic powder and salt. Definitely a keeper of a recipe for its flexibility.  Yum!

I enjoyed these. Yeah, you may have to "dress them up" to your liking, but for someone who is watching calories, this is a nice, healthy option. I had to improvise and used dried cilantro, as that is what I had on hand. I also added sliced grape tomatoes. Thanks for sharing, Valkaryn.

My husband & I are vegetarian....i personally loved these tacos for a meal.  Hubby thinks they're more appropriate as an appetizer. We set these up as a taco bar w/ black beans, corn & all the fixings, everyone can make their own tacos the way the like.  Only rule: NO MEAT ALLOWED!

This recipe is okay as a base. As a full recipe, it's a bit dull for my taste, basically a mild guacamole in a corn tortilla. After trying the recipe exactly as written, I made it again but added roasted corn and black beans, along with some Jack cheese. Keeps the recipe healthy and easy while adding some flavor and texture.

I only give this 2 stars because I added black beans and yellow rice, which make it worth eating.  This was so bland and the Corn Tortillas overpowered the mild flavors.  I ended up just mixing everything together minus the tortillas and had myself a yellow rice/black bean salad.

Awesome. I took the advice of other reviews and made them my own. I added a little Joe T Garcia's salsa and some leftover Spicy Black Bean Salad. This took 5 minutes from beginning to end...mmmm.

This was pretty bland, make sure you use really ripe avocados to maximize the flavor.  I still give it 4 stars though, just because avocados are so darn good!

The cilantro was good with it, but other than that they are a little too bland for me.  I didn't have jalapeno pepper sauce (maybe that was the problem) so I tried hot sauce.

Kind of average, but I liked how easy and quick they were to make. I had to serve several different guests so I made the avocado spread sans onions, and instead put out small dishes of various toppings for my guests to custom make their tacos - bell peppers, onions, black beans,  cilantro, cheese, hot sauce... It went great with the Hot Corn Dip recipe. Some even put the dip on the tacos!

I would give it 10 stars if I could!  This is awesome!  My entire family loved it.  We even shared it with my cousins family and it is a hit with that family as well.  Even with a three year old!  We add black beans to the avacado mixture, put tomatoes on top with a smidge of cheese, put back in the oven for 3-5 min. or until the cheese is melted.  Excellent!  Recommended for sure!  :)

This recipe served as a great starting point for my girlfriend and I to elaborate on. We added shrimp that we cooked with garlic, butter, red onion, chili powder and lemon. Then, for the pico de gallo, we used tomatoes, jalapeno, red onion, cilantro, lemon, garlic salt and pepper. And last, we warmed up a can of black beans and put corn tortillas in the toaster oven. Splashes of Tapatio filled in a very nice part of the palate. Cheese was a great topper as well.

This was really simply and delicious! Avocados are one of my absolute favorite foods, so this really hit the spot for my hubby and me. I added black beans and sharp white cheddar cheese. 
Thank you for sharing! This will be a regular for us.

I thought this was excellent! I followed the recipes as stated, and added about 1/4 to 1/2 of a freshly squeezed lime to the avacado mixture.  I also had some baby spinach on the side to put on the taco as well.  What I am going to try next time is add some corn to the mixture and maybe some red pepper.  I was really surprised at how filling this was.

Simple and tasty. I omitted the onion and seasoned the mashed avocado with various Mexican spices, salt, pepper, half a teaspoon of chicken bouillon and added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (although lime juice might work better.) Great vegetarian dish, but probably would have tasted even better with shredded chicken.

This was really good, but I think I put too much onions. I love avocados, so I was looking for a light dinner recipe with them and it was really helpful! I made it with lettuce, sprinkled cheese and put a little salsa. YUM! I'm going to try it the other ways listed in the reviews. Thanks!

The recipe is a good start, but it needs a bit more. I added diced tomatoes to give it more texture, mozarella cheese, and dripped cholula sauce onto the tacos for some great flavor.

Avocado mix was really good. Did not use hot sauce and added 1/4 squeezed lime.   Added cumin and a little green chili to beans.  Served with tomatoes, lettuce, salsa, cheese and lime slices to squeeze over taco.  Nice and Fresh

These were amazing. Easy and quick to make. I followed another reviewer's advice and brushed the tortillas with a mix of olive oil and lime juice. Mixed some of the cilantro in with the avocado and garlic salt. Paired it with sour cream, hot sauce, tequila lime salsa, and monterey jack cheese. 

So good we made more for lunch the next day! Definitely going in our favorites folder. I'd love to try them with other toppings in the future, maybe some beans or even a little meat. I imagine they'd be a good appetizer or party snack as well.

A good base, but I added reduced fat fiesta blend cheese, light sour cream, olives and tomatoes. I thought it was awesome. I'm not sure I would have thought so with the original alone, but definitely a keeper.

If you're looking for a quick, on-the-go snack, make the recipe as is and you have a good low calorie snack (I would add some diced tomatoes). However for a more filling option for the dinner table, add a good heap of refried beans, and you have a tasty, healthy meal!

Very good, the reason I rated it 4 stars is because I omited the garlic salt, added lemon juice and used parsley instead of cilantro.

We eat this all the time! Our favorite mixture is black beans sprinkled with a little garlic and cayenne, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, olives, sour cream, cilantro, salsa and cheese. It's so fresh and quick and easy. It's also great with a fresh pico de gallo! Thanks for the wonderful idea.

I have to agree, this was GREAT!  After reading some of the reviews, I too made a few adjustments. I added some cheese and a dollap of sour cream.  And instead of adding the pico de gallo to the avocado mixture, I topped it with my homemade salsa.  I also used store bought tostadas instead of toasting the tortillas in the oven.  It saved lots of time, but next time I think I'd like to follow the suggestion of the others and add lime juice & olive oil and toast the tortillas in the oven.  My DH, who thinks he needs meat in every meal LOVED these!  It was the perfect meal on a rather hot afternoon.

Definitely a good side-dish as-is. But add some black beans, some cheese, and whatever else you might like in a taco and these things are awesome as a main dish!  Everyone liked the guacamole, which was the star of the dish.

Really good! I didn't mash the avocadoes, just cubed them- included some lime juice, and a 1/2 a roma tomato finely chopped.  They were delicious- husband and kids enjoyed them too!

There's something to be said about simplicity, and while I didn't eat any of the avocado tacos I made, my fiancee enjoyed them, and she said they were good. I guess what I'm driving at is that a recipe with four ingredients (not counting the tortillas) gets an extra star for being so easy and simple, partly since it serves as a great base recipe to tweak and add ingredients to.

This recipe is great!!  I would never have thought that an avocado taco could taste so good or be so filling.  I had to make a few slight changes because I didn't have some ingredients, but it's close to the original.  I used 2 avocados, half a small onion, 1/2 t dried cilantro, 1/4 t salt, and some dried garlic (being lazy!).  My husband likes spicy food, so I gave him some Tabasco sauce.  We ate them on flour tortillas with shredded cheddar cheese.  These are cheap, fast, and easy, too.

As is, this is a little plain for me.  I think it is a good base for vegetarian tacos though.  I dressed them up with salsa, cheese, sliced peppers, and flour tortillas.

This is a good basic recipe for avocado tacos and good to play with. The recipe is a little plain as is, or you have to use jalapeno sauce to give an extra flavor. I added lime juice and jalapeno pepper into the mixture, because I didn`t have jalapeno sauce. And I used 2 cloves garlic instead of garlic salt. Turned out good and delicious. This recipe is a good idea how to prepare interesting and healty meal with avocado.

This was a great basic recipe! So easy to expand on! I would suggest a few things... Put some lemon juice in with the avocado mixture, gives it a nice zip. I cooked some TVP (textured vegetable protein - a ground beef substitute) with some taco seasoning, and my family didn't even know they were missing the meat! I also love this recipe with some chopped fresh tomatoes and cheddar cheese. Lettuce, black beans, corn, sour cream etc. would also make nice toppings for this recipe - I might just put them in little bowls and let the family serve themselves! Also - 1 bunch of cilantro was too much, I would have said half bunch at most.

Super easy and excellent! I did add a little bit of lime juice but this is a great recipe.

Very easy and filling. The jalapeno sauce sets this dish off

I made these like the potato tacos and put 2 tbsp filling in each corn tortilla and fried them. It was to die for!!

Was really good but not enough food for a main dish. Needed more to fill my husband and I up. Plus next time I'll add tomato's and salsa to the top. But so good.

These were delicious. I put my oven on 400 to crisp up the tortillas, and that worked great. I served this with salmon patties. The freshness of the guacamole and cilantro went very well with them!
