This recipe is almost the same as the one I've been using for years--minus the carrots and cukes.  
Helpful hints:  Wash quinoa before cooking. Qunoa has a white powder-like substance on the grain that needs to be rinsed off before cooking.  
To speed cool quinoa--put in frig or freezer. 
To successfully chop rinsed (wet) parsley:   remove stems and throw in food processor OR cut using kitchen scissors in a small tall-sided bowl. 
Another hint:  remove seeds from tomatoes before dicing.

I thought this was a nice, fresh, healthy salad. I took another reviewers advice and subbed the parsley for cilantro, and used halved cherry tomatoes for the tomatoes. It seemed like it was missing something so I threw in a dash of cumin. That added the complexity I was looking for. I'll make this again often.

This was fabulous with just one tweak.  I found it was slightly bland and missing something so I searched my pantry to see what I could add.  I found a jar of pimento-stuffed green olives which I sliced and mixed in and it made all the difference.  I would imagine feta would work too, it just needs some kind of flavor punch.  I would definitely make this again, as it is a great dish to bring to picnics or potlucks where there will be a vegetarian.  Soooo good!  Even my meat-and-potatoes boyfriend who shuns anything either ethnic or vegetarian loved it!!!!!!!

A real favourite - I take it to pot-luck parties, or use it for lunch during the week.
My additions: - soak the quinoa overnight, then rinse thoroughly before cooking; add the lemon zest from the lemon used to produce the juice; add 8oz cubed/crumbled feta cheese.  I often use dried parsley instead of fresh and it still tates great.  Bonus that it tastes better & better as it "ages"!!

Great recipe - gotta love quinoa.  I used half the oil (lower fat) and added 2 tbsp of apple cider vinegar and used only one bunch of onions.  Turned out great.  It's also suitable for a Candida-free diet if you use sea salt.

This recipe was refreshing and absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe precisely, except I did not add salt into the pot.  Two pieces of advice are to rinse the quinoa before cooking and cool the tabbouleh before eating... it tastes very refreshing when it's cold!

Had a hard time getting the veggie pieces as small as they have them at the Arabic restaurants I've been to, but it was really tasty and healthy!  I love how the quinoa adds so much protein, too.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, minced.  Will definitely make again.

quinoa is my new favorite food! i substituted celery for cucumbers, since i don't like cucumbers. i like to use less green onions and only 1/8 cup of lemon juice for a more subtle flavor. the longer it sits, the better it tastes.

This is a great recipe, and a nice twist on traditional bulgar tabbouleh.  The quinoa gives it a very nice texture, and the addition of shredded carrots gives it some sweetness, which complements the lemony tang.  I used half the olive oil to lower the calorie count a little. I'll make this one again!

It is like a salad.  I will double the quinoa next time, cut the oil and add a little vinegar.  I have had several people taste it and everyone really likes it.  I made it with dirty rice and they complemented each other for a tasty meal. This was my first introduction to quinoa and I am now looking for more.

I made this for Passover seder last night.  I was very excited to discover that quinoa is kosher for passover while other grains like rice and couscous are not.  Anyhow, I had 20 people so I tripled the recipe.  I had a ton of it.  People ate at least half and I still have lots leftover.  It says that it serves 4 but as a side dish, I'd say it serves more like 8.  It got rave reviews from all of my guests and several people asked for the recipe.  I did tweak it a bit as per recommendations from other reviewers.  I tripled the quinoa but only doubled the vegetables.  I also cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth and added a teaspoon of cumin.  I also added two large cloves of garlic.  Keeping in mind that I tripled the recipe, two cloves were very strong and prounounced.  It tasted good but one large clove would have over-powered a single recipe.  If were to make a single recipe, I would be very conservative with the garlic.  A little goes a long way.  I also did 1 cup parsley, 1 cup cilantro and 1 cup mint which tasted awesome.  The only complaint about this recipe is that it involves a TON of chopping and took a long time to make because of it.

This is delicious the way I made it! You will be much happier if you make this dish in advance and leave it in your fridge overnight or for a day before serving/eating. Here's how I made it: I cooked the quinoa in homemade veg stock. I only used 1/8 c. olive oil, which was plenty. I used the juice from 1-1/2 lemons (didn't measure). 1 cucumber (could have used more) and about one bunch of green onions (it was enough). Left out the carrots. Subbed cilantro for parsley and was very glad I did. I don't care for tomatoes so left them out, but if you like tomatoes I would definitely add them. I also added some cumin and could probably have been more generous with it. I used quite a bit of sea salt, adding more the next day. I meant to add a can of garbanzo beans but after opening the can, I noticed they were soybeans so threw them in anyway. The addition of feta or kalamata olives would definitely be delicious as well. Don't be afraid of adding lots of sea salt and lemon juice!

A PLEA TO THOSE WHO USE CHICKEN STOCK TO COOK THE QUINOA: If you're making this for a potluck/picnic, please consider using veg stock or water, because by using chicken stock you have just turned this awesome vegetarian dish into one that vegetarians can't eat. Of course if it's for your family or those you know don't care, then it's fine, but sometimes some dish like this is the only thing vegetarians can eat!! Thank you.

This tabbouleh is very good. In the past I have used couscous in this recipe, but it's very much worth it to use quinoa. The quinoa is substantial enough to stand up to any extra liquid that comes out of the tomatoes or cucumbers, especially after a day in the fridge - it's still delicious and not soggy. 
Tips:
Cooking the quinoa in chicken or vegetable broth gives the tabbouleh a heartier flavour. If the lemon is too tangy, take the edge off with 1/2 tsp of honey or sugar. For a little twist, add one clove of minced garlic.

This was very fresh tasting but we didn't love it.  It just seemed like it was missing something.  It would have been good in a wrap or pita with something more flavorful...chicken, falafal, flavored tofu, feta.

This is one of our fav salads! Best with a simple baked chicken dish. Sometimes I need a little bit more dressing, but not much. I found quinoa at Trader Joes or Costco sells organic quinoa in a 5lb. bag. I always wash the quinoa and soak it. Some studies say if you soak it for an hour (so the white part is visible) it's healthier because it has had time to germinate prior to cooking. All in all, make sure to at least wash it. I always cook my quinoa in chicken broth (or vegetable broth) to give it a little more flavor. Also cherry tomatoes cut in half are sweeter and less messy than regular tomatoes and adding an orange bell pepper really makes this dish colorful and super healthy!

Delicious, and fresh.  Those complaining that it lacks something must be use to eating MSG, or other fake flavors.  This dish is so refreshing and the taste is amazing.  Fresh top notch produce will ensure the best results, especially the tomatoes.  I dropped the olive oil from a quarter cup to just a few tablespoons- no need for all that oil, just a smidge.  I also added a generous splash of rice vinegar.

Yummy, I LOVE quinoa! My 5 STAR TIPS: Rinse the quinoa, like you would rice. Add fresh raw minced garlic. Seed tomatoes and cucumber. Add splash apple cider vinegar. Use fresh squeezed lemon juice, even lime juice in a pinch, especially if you sub cilantro for parsley! Leave carrots out, unless you require sweet taste, we don't like it. Cut the oil in half. Use only sea salt. And finally...add fresh mint! That mint is the flavor you are missing, when you wonder why this doesn't taste "right". Cool the quinoa overnight, before you add all the COLD ingredients the next day, right before serving. And adding feta cheese and avocado is never wrong! This dish is eaten COLD. I am not sure this was clear for those trying something new.

This has the potential to be an outstanding dish. I don't normally like tabbouleh that much, but now I've discovered it's just because I don't care for bulgur that much! This was the first time I made quinoa, and it seems really easy to overcook. Be careful with the instruction for 15 minutes and watch it when it gets close to 10. I think mine turned out a bit on the mushy side because I cooked it for the full 15 (along with rinsing and soaking for 4 hours before cooking). Other than that, I halved the amount of oil and that seemed to work well. Added some chopped fresh mint in with the parsley - somehow, it just wouldn't be tabbouleh to me without SOME mint in there. I too seeded both tomatoes and cukes. I liked the addition of carrots. Will definitely try again with some of the cumin and feta variations mentioned in other reviews. Thanks!

Loved it!  I served it with pita bread and hummus, and it is super filling.  If you serve it immediatly, it will taste like something is missing, but if you wait a day , the juices soak up and it is great!  This definatly serves more than 4, I got about 8 servings out of it.

I loved this recipe!  So easy to make!  I am a big fan of tabbouleh made w/ bulgar so I was especially happy to find a recipe that used quinoa,  a " super grain".   The FoodLovers Companion says its a complete protein b/c it comtains all eight  essential amino acids.
  And its an especially colorful dish w/ all the veggies in it.  I took the seeds out of the cukes and did the same w/ the Roma/Plum tomatoes that I used, so the dish would not get watered down.  I also added more lemon, EVOO and salt.  Next time I may add a dash of cumin but all in all this dish didnt need improvement, other  then a slight adjustment of seasoning.

I just made Quinoa Tabbouleh the other day, but w/o tomatoes, cucumber and carrots.  That sounds delish!  Since I think the taboule is already so good without these ingredients, I am going to add them for my lunch and it will probably be even better.. BTW.. I only used 1 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil.  It actually is better with 2 Tbsp, but I am on Weight Watchers, so keeping the points down enables me to eat a larger portion.

Oh Wow. I just loved this. I used seeded roma tomatoes, cut olive oil by half and used an English cucumber. I brought this to work with a little cold sliced chicken on top. All I added was a dash of spicy salt to the mixture. Perfect lunch. This is going into permanent lunch rotation. :)

Delicious and healthy. I used cilantro instead of parsley and added a little cumin and it turned out great. Very clean and refreshing taste. We stuff this in pita bread but it tastes good on it's own too.

Left out carrots and green onion.  Cooked the quinoa in 1 3/4c chicken broth for a bit more flavor, added 1 tsp cumin as recommended by other reviewers and added 1/2tsp garlic powder & half a diced red pepper as well.  Was very good a few hours later, but was fantastic the next day!  This is now one of my favorites!

This is amazing! I used red pepper instead of tomato (I'm allergic to tomatoes), left out the carrots (same), and chopped the parsley myself. The first time I made it, it wasn't so good since I used dried parsley. Chopping it yourself makes a huge difference!

I loved this even though I made it my own just a tad. :) I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth, used half cilantro for the parsley and added a bit of feta. Yum!!!

I halved 10 oz. cherry tomatoes, cooked a little bit of white onion in olive oil in the same pot I cooked the quinoa instead of green onion, added a bit of black pepper and didn't have any parsley. Still perfect, though I may cook some garlic in w/ the quinoa next time.

Loved this! I made slight modifications, of course, but can't understand how others are complaining about blandness. I found it extremely bright and fresh. My mods: cook quinoa in veg stock, sub red onion for the scallions, add 1 tsp of cumin, add zest of one lemon, omit the carrot, only used half the oil. Be sure to seed both the cuke and tomatoes before dicing. Would definintely be great with some added mint, kalamata, and/or feta.

I used half the oil (1/4 cup seems to me to be way too much) and added a healthy dose of apple cider vinegar as well as salt and cumin.  I also left out the carrots because it's more traditional that way.  I love this salad, it has a very unique taste.  It's not for everyone, but for me it's a great low-cal healthy lunch option.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't have much time to cook but this recipe is well worth the time involved. I followed the recipe for all ingredients, plus took the advice of other raters to add cumin and 1/2 jalapeno pepper. This makes a very large salad so you must add the proper amount of oil called for. Similar to others, I thought something was missing and tried adding just a bit more lemon juice. The lemon juice must be fresh squeezed (bottled will not have the zing). I have made the recipe three times in the last month and am now purchasing quinoa in bulk because of this recipe alone. I have never rated a recipe on the Internet before ... that's just how good this recipe is. My husband loves it, can't get enough..it is light, refreshing, and yet satisfyingly filling. Follow the instructions (olive oil contains healthy fats - even if you are dieting, do not deprive yourself of essential fatty acids). Enjoy!

This was far better than I thought it would be!! I had no green onions, parsley or carrots and now I'm wondering how much better it would have been if I had these ingredients.  The lemon really made this dish great so if you don't have that on hand, I wouldn't recommend making this.

This was really good; the only complaint I think would be between the lemon dressing and the cup of parsley, this salad was very lemony. But still very good and will be a staple in my kitchen.

Instead of doing all quinoa, I used half quinoa and half brown rice. I used half the amount of chopped parsley and I thought it was more than enough. I also added about a 1/3 c. of chopped green pepper for some added crunch. I absolutely loved this dish! It is so much better than traditional tabbouleh with bulgur.

I was out of bulgar wheat and was glad to find a good grain substitute.  I normally don't add carrot to my tabbouleh.  I actually finely decided my carrot, and it provided some sweetness and a nice crunch.  Good recipe.  I can see myself making it again.

I made this for a potluck tonight and it was very well received.  Kids even liked it!  I am not a huge fan of parsley, so I did 1/4C parsley and  1/4C cilantro.  I also reduced the olive oil just a bit.  It did seem a little bland (probably improves overnight) so I put it a few twists of Trader Joe's Everyday Seasoning with the built-in grinder.  That did the trick!  I do think adding a bit of feta and /or garlic would be tasty, too.

Great recipe, but I added my own flare!  I added green pepper, yellow onion (and the green onion it calls for), and fresh garlic.  I also added feta cheese as another reviewer mentioned.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh and omitted the carrots.  Easy and delicious!

this was good! i didn't find it bland and i basically followed the recipe (with some eyeballing of amounts of everything) excluding the carrots (the texture didn't seem to fit in my head). i squeezed a whole lemon, used extra virgin olive oil, and probably did more than a 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt (after reading a couple reviews that said the flavor was a little bland, i decided to go for several dashes of sea salt :P). i'd definitely make it again, but i'm only giving it 4 stars because i feel like it's lacking substance... i.e., it'd make a great side, but i couldn't have this as a meal on its own (and i love vegetables and salads and make meals out of them all the time!).

So good! And so fresh tasting! I followed it to the letter and it was fantastic. Later on, I added a wee bit more salt, and to make it more of a meal, I added some crumbled feta cheese. It is delicious both ways!

mmm mmm mmm! love it.  I used white, black and red quinoa in my salad.  I halved the oil and added a little garlic and a small amount of fine black pepper as I felt it needed a little something extra, but other than that it's a lovely salad.  The quinoa gives it a beautiful texture that you just don't get from bulghur wheat.   I think I will always make the quinoa version in future.

I just made this yesterday for a family get together. It was absolutely delicious. I had doubled the recipe to be sure to have enough as we have a few vegetarians in the group and I wanted to be sure they had a protein source. People were fighting over leftovers!

Awesome!  My favorite quinoa recipe.  Not sure why anyone would say this did not have enough flavor.  I am a vegetarian and tend to eat different foods than the typical American.  I tried this out on a couple of my non veggie friends and they both loved it! I will be making this again.  The only change I made was that I did not add the carrots and cooked the quinoa in vegetable stock.

Delicious recipe! Other recipes usually have red onion and mint in them--I'm glad this one doesn't. I cooked my quinoa in veg broth, so I left out the salt. I also cut back the olive oil to 1 TBSP and subbed a can of very well-drained diced tomatoes for the fresh. We had this with hummus and whole-wheat pita on the side, and it was a perfect light lunch. We'll definitely be making this again.

Really good!  I took suggestions from other reviewers and mixed in about 1/3 part cilantro with the parsley and added some red wine vinegar.  Next time, I think I'll try adding some cumin and cayenne for a kick.  Will definately make this again.

Our family liked this a lot.  I'm a carbaholic, so I made half again as much quinoa as the recipe called for, and will probably double it next time.  I also added an orange bell pepper that was on its last legs in my frig.  There is a pretty high vegetable-to-grain ratio in the original recipe, and our tastes run a little more to the grain side (since I wasn't trying to recreate Tabbouleh, I didn't feel the need to try to stay as authentic as possible).  My quinoa cooked just like rice.  I think there must be quite a variety of quinoa available on the market after reading about the woes of other reviewers.  Using Bob's Red Mill brand, there is no rinsing necessary, and you don't have to soak it, either.  It wasn't mushy, and had a nice al dente bite to it.  This salad reminded me quite a bit of a Mediterranean-style salad I used to make with couscous.  This is a much healthier option!  Thanks for the recipe!

First time cooking quinoa. I did not even know it existed until my sister in law served it for dinner recently.  I made substitutions only because that is what I had handy.  First... I cooked my quinoa in vegetable buillon, used dried parsley and basil, I did not have green onion so used regular white onion, no lemon so used lime, no carrots. Still turned out quite tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.

Quinoa actually tastes a lot better if you soak it at least 8 hours first, 24 hours is even better, it gets rid of ALL the bitterness and actually tastes kind of sweet. I tried just rinsing and I tried soaking for an hour, but I have a sensitive pallate and I could still taste the bitterness.

AMAZING! So nourishing, delicious, and surprisingly easy and fast to make. 
I did make some adjustments: I halved the amount of grated carrot, I used red quinoa (mostly because I already had some on hand), I substitute the cucumber with zucchini because I can't digest cucumber, and I used two instead of three tomatoes. 
The zucchini lends a subtler more filling quality to the tabbouleh; try it out!
Thanks for the recipe!

I cannot stop eating this refreshing salad. I added a tsp of cumin and only 1 tomato because that is all I had, but it was the perfect amount! This will be my new go-to recipe for bbq's this summer!

I used quite a bit more parsley than the recipe called for as this one is light on the parsley.  I also subbed minced fresh garlic for the onion as I am not a fan of onions.  Lastly, it was a bit bland, so I added 2 add'l tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar- that did the trick. I will also remove the seeds from my tomatoes next time.

Always looking for an easy side that's a good make-ahead - this is perfect.  Make up a large amount of quinoa and this is good for in a packed lunch, dinner side, and good for a few days ... as well as being incredibly healthy!

By FAR one of the best Tabbouleh recipes I've tried from this site.  My family LOVES it and I find myself making it several times a month.  Doubt I'll ever go back to using bulgur wheat again. As a couple of other reviewers noted - I reduced the oil to half and added some Apple Cider vinegar to give it some tang.  YUM!

I add this to pitas stuffed with falafel, tzatziki and hummus.  I have found the green onion to be a little overwhelming and eliminated it from the recipe for my use in the wrap.  Great way to add and extra health boost to a vegetarian diet

I didn't care for this - I think it is very overrated. I prepared as instructed and it came out VERY bland.  Ended up adding balsamic vinegar, feta cheese, and some more salt just to get it to a point where I wouldn't throw it away.

I'm sorry to say we didn't really like this recipe. We first had it in pita bread with falafel and a yogurt cucumber sauce, and it was okay. When we had it on its own, it wasn't that good either despite following the recipe exactly. We won't be making it again.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe, but I think next time I'll use less oil and lemon juice--it was pretty wet. I added cumin, as another reviewer suggested, and used sliced grape tomatoes instead of large tomatoes b/c that's what I had on hand. OK, I'm not gonna lie--I ran out of lemon juice (only had about 1/8 c) and used lime for the rest. It tasted like it would be better with all lemon, but in a pinch, lime was good, too! Thanks for the recipe!

Sooo good! The only change I made was to cook the quinoa in chicken broth instead of just water oh and I also reduced the oil amount a bit. Will make maney times in the future! Thanks Syneva for a healthy and delicious recipe! Elvira Silva.

I used 2 Cups Quinoa and 2 tomatos, 1 bunch Onions. It takes less time and energy if you cook the Quinoa in a rice cooker. 1 Cup Quinoa and 2 Cups Water and a pinch Salt.

This was a good start for me, but I will be making a few changes next time. For one, I don't care for cucumber, and I was hoping the flavor would be masked, but it isn't. I will leave that out next time. I also feel like garlic and white onions are an important part of tabbouleh, which I will probably add next time. Lastly, adding a can or two of garbanzo beans adds the protein you need to make this a healthy, vegan dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  It was very flavorful and is easy to  put together.  Great salad/ side dish.  Extra virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice are the keys to the recipe.  I also added some fresh garlic for some punch.  It will be a part of my rotation.

Absolutely astronomical! I use a can of hunts diced (undrained) instead of fresh, and I boil the onions with the quinoa, but otherwise, everything else the same.  Best tasting tabouleh I've had, ever!

This recipe was pretty good.  I seeded the tomatoes and the cucumbers.  I think the dressing needed a bit more oopmh - maybe some garlic and/or onion.  I added some feta cheese to about half of the tabbouleh.  Other than that, I enjoyed this dish very much.

I seeded the cucumber and tomatoes, and I halved the oil and lemon juice, so I didn't find this watery @ all.  I did substitute cilantro for parsley based on other reviews, but next time I'll stick w/ parsley.  This recipe is really good and makes a lot more food than I thought it would.  It does get better the longer it sits.  I'll make this again.

I took the advices of other reviewers and cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and used 1 bunch of onions.  I also used cilantro leaves instead of the parsley, which added that wonderful, slightly bitter herb taste that most of us enjoy in salsas and other Mexican dishes. Excellent!

I pretty much followed the recipe except for the green onions - I didn't have any. I thought that the recipe was good and chocked full of fresh vegetables. The only change I will make next time is I will half the amount of oil - it seemed a bit more oily than necessary.

I make this every Sunday and eat it for my work lunch all week. I add other veggies I have in the house ( chick peas, olives, peppers, green beans) to sneak in extra veggies. I set the dressing aside and add it when I'm eating it. Super tasty, I don't feel heavy or bloated, and very filling. Perfect side or meal

I NEVER use water in a grain recipe. I use chicken stock or mushroom stock as a vegetarian alternative. I also prefer zucchini to the cucumber. You can't add to many vegetables to a dish like this, so I usually add any extra vegetables I have lying around from previous meals. You can soften the vegis by boiling them in the broth for a few minutes before cooking the quinoa

This recipie is especially tasty after a couple of days, when the flavors more completely combine.  I added three tablespoons of Sriracha Chili Sauce prior to serving.  The freshness of the salad remained but there was a subtle heat at the finish.

I loved it with the addition of 3 minced garlic. I have used a full bunch of parsley and cider vinegar in place of lemon juice and it still tastes great! It was excellent on a sandwich!

I just used this recipe as a guide. I cooked one cup of quinoa with two cups of chicken stock in my rice cooker. I chopped 1/2 cucumber, 3 tomatoes, 1/8th cup of red onion, 1 tablespoon of green onion,  1/8th cup yellow bell pepper, 1 cup of parsley, 1 teaspoon of fresh dill, used only about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the juice of 1/2 lemon (plus the zest), a dash of red wine vinegar. It is amazing!

Before making this Tabbouleh I read some of the reviews and noticed there were several comments about how bland it was. There are lots of suggestions for adding some flavour to this recipe. My variation includes more salt, ground cumin, cilantro, extra lemon juice, vinegar and red wine :).

The only thing I did differently was add some fresh crushed garlic. This keeps very well, is filling, healthy and economical as a side dish or main.

2017 Update! I use a red onion,  finely chopped and that was even better! I also stopped using olives and switched to just capers. I have made this at least 20 times and I mix it up with whatever is on hand. I do not use salt in the beginning and I do rinse the quinoa first. It takes time for the Quinoa to cool down..about 30 min. Then I add the EVOO, I don't measure, as I eyeball how wet the mixture is. I add red wine vinegar,  balsamic , apple cider or rice wine vinegar.  I use whatever kind I have in the pantry at the time. I do not use lemon juice as I love the tang of the vinegars. I use whole grape tomatoes and chopped cucumbers with the seeds scooped out. I do not use carrots but it is a must to use fresh parsley! I add feta cheese and hefty dashes of red pepper flakes and fresh ground pepper. I add sea salt to taste at the end. With the saltiness of the feta and capers,  you don't need much. I have added black and Mediterranean olives. Again, whatever I have on hand. This is so versatile, you can add in pretty much whatever you have in the fridge. If I am out of feta, I add chopped string cheese or mozzarella. Also it is true if you serve it hours or a day later- the flavors have a chance to meld together and it tastes much better!

Quinoa is amazing! and so good for you.  I make my base Quinoa starting with roasting it in the pot with 2 Tsp olive oil, 3 tbs pressed garlic. Once it starts smelling good I add the water and 1 tbs  chicken better than bulion. Let that boil for 1-2 min on high...then turn down the heat to low and cover for 15-20 min.
It adds a grat flavor to savory dishes and made this recipie using this method, it was wonderful!

My first encounter with quinoa did not go well.  So I was hesistant to try again.  I'm so glad I did.  This was delicious. I did make a few changes only for personal taste.  I added minced garlic, used celery instead of cucumber used cilantro instead of parsley and omitted the tomatoes.  WAS SOOOO GOOD!

This was my first experience with quinoa.  It is a different kind of texture.  I thought it tasted okay, but if I make this again I might add a little less parsley.

For my first time cooking quinoa I decided to make a tabouleh since my family likes it and it seemed to be an easy substitution. I found the quinoa made the salad lighter and easier to digest than with cousous or bulgur. This recipe was very good. I tend to use more parsley and add mint and a shake of dill to the dressing.  I've never used carrots and may give it a try one day.

Fantastic recipe. I did add 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion, 1/4 tsp cumin and 1/4 tsp garlic. Following a previous reviewer's advice, I removed the tomato seeds first. Next time I will sub cilantro for parsley.

So delicious!  A PERFECT side dish!  I made this to go in hand with mini turkey meat loaf & it was a perfect balance!  We had left overs and I had it for lunch today....still SO good!  I may try this with Israeli cous cous and see how it all turns out that way.
I eyeballed the OO & lemon juice to my prefernce & still turned out great!

Excellent!  I will add more parsley and lemon juice next time for a bit more of those 2 flavours.  A very satisfying recipe though all around.

This was awesome! Made 2 servings... and ate them both in one sitting! Need to make more very soon. Like tomorrow! I did not change anything. I used the curley parsley, and did not care for the texture, will try another next time. But one of my favorite recipes on this site!

Delicious!  Easy to make and a hit for Passover when grains cannot be eaten (Quinoa is the seed of a grass).  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This recipe was wonderful! I added garlic and onion powders and left out the carrots due to allergies. This was incredibly refreshing and flavorful and I look forward to using fresh vegies from my garden this summer. Thank you Syneva B!

This is delicious! My fiance is a vegetarian so I am always looking for recipes we can both enjoy. I had never had quinoa before, now I can't wait to try some other recipes for it. We added extra lemon juice and a tiny bit of hot sauce to give it a little more kick.

This recipe was awesome! I followed other's advice and doubled the quinoa for this recipe and it turned out great. Very refreshing and light. I omitted the carrots and used a mix of red and white quinoa to add some color (and because that's what I had at home). A little extra lemon juice to brighten up the flavors and this is a new favorite.

Very filling and delicious. Will def do again. thanks!

This is really great!  I had leftover feta (about 2oz) that I added. I only had one bunch of green onions, so I added a little regular onion too.  I took the advise of one review and used half the oil and added some apple cider vinegar, I liked the zing it gave it. Hmm I think that's all I did different - but I'll make this again, I really love it!

This was a great recipe!  I left out the carrots and the onions.  A piece of advice, add the oil mixture to the quinoa to ensure best ratio and avoid getting too much oil liquid.  And, I toasted my quinoa cooking.

With modifications, this tabbouleh recipe can be a "10".  I prefer a more mediterranean version. You need either about 1/4 cup less water or a little more quinoa so that you don't have to strain it after cooking.. nothing worse than ruining the flavor with soggy grain. One bunch of green onions was plenty. I omitted the carrots and used salt and pepper to taste instead of the sea salt. In addition to the listed ingredients, 1 can of garbanzo beans/chickpeas, 1 pkg of feta cheese, and 2-3 minced cloves of garlic make this salad absolutely sublime.  It is also imperative that you let the salad sit for several hours or overnight to allow the mixture of flavors to develop. Serve with tortilla/pita chips, over a green salad, or on pita bread or a tortilla with hummus..  Amazing!

I was first introduced to tabouli by a Lebanese friend.  He had made up the salad, and it was great. After that, I bought the commercial prep occasionally for several years, added chopped tomato, etc.  and it was fine.  Those contained bulgur wheat, and have always had a unique flavor.  I made up this quinoa variation, and am totally disappointed.  Have tailored and experimented with this product, but cannot get the flavor.  Is it the bulgur wheat?  Must try other ways, for this just isn't IT for real tabouli.

So delicious and light!  Added feta and used cilantro.  Great summertime salad.  Had a bbq and this was the perfect side to a great big burger!  Healthy and didn't add more weight to the meal!  Loved it so much made it again a few nights later just as it's own meal.

I added about 1 tsp of cumin and 1/2 tsp of pepper.  It gave the tabbouleh the warmth needed and leveled out the lemon.

LOVE THIS!  I did everything pretty much as the recipe went, except for cutting down on the olive oil to 2-3 tablespoons and used 1/2 cilantro, 1/2 parsley.  The carrot in this was very unconventional but made it so unique and good.  I couldn't stop eating it and found myself craving it during the day.  I am gonna be making this for all my summer BBQ potlucks.   Thank you for contributing a new regular dish into my rotation.  You rock!!!!

I added an extra cucumber since my kids and I love them. I also added mint and cumin after reading the suggestions.  I must say that everyone in my family was pleasantly suprised. We really loved it. Well, dh, who is by far the pickiest out of the 7 of us, said it is not great but edible for something healthy. He said he might get used to having it regularly. LOL.

This is great! I also added a zucchini. The recipe is great as is but I have been experimenting by adding different spices each time I have a little bowl of it. Cumin, cayenne and garlic taste great in this so does a little bit of apple cider vinegar as others have suggested! Thanks for the recipe!

I made it 5 stars (I give stars for the recipe as stated, sorry) by adding a glug of white vinegar.  Gave it a tanginess I prefer.  If you try this, add a small bit at a time as a little goes a long way.  Great recipe for getting more quinoa and fresh veggies into your diet!

Great for Gluten/Wheat Free diets!   This is delicious!  I followed the recipe as written, but added more lemon juice (2 lemons worth).  I will definitely make this again, maybe adding some red onion too.

This recipe is excellent!  I took it to a Mediterranean potluck dinner and three people asked me for the recipe.  Thanks!  Also, quinoa is a great alternative to grains for friends who have to eat gluten free.

This was very good. Made it a few times by following the recipe to the T then decided to venture off trying different flavors. Great with tiny shrimp, chicken and fish! Thanks so much for sharing! My husband LOVES it!

This stuff is SOOO good!  I'm a new veggie and have been looking for ways to include more vegetables and healthy grains so that I won't miss meat.  This recipe tastes like summer in a bowl.  It's great.  I did make one change - my bunches of green onions were 6-8 onions per bunch, so I only used one.  Also, I wish I'd used 1 1/2 times or even double the quinoa for a little more substance.  The taste can't be beat, though.  This is definitely a new fave for me and my sister.

This was very good.  I had never tasted Quinoa before, but had wanted to.  The only changes I made were to omit the parsley (because I didn't have any), and I use finely diced red onion instead of green because I prefer the taste of red onions.  I took some into work and several co-workers who tried it loved it!  The leftovers were still good several days later, but the tomatoes were a bit soft, so next time I'll probably leave those out and just add in as I eat it.

This was an excellent recipe. I added fresh crushed garlic and a large can of pitted black olives.(Diced) Stuffed in a warm Pita bread half with feta cheese made a delicious sandwhich loved by guest for a poolside party. Be using this again. Thank you

This was very good.  I cooked the quinoa in the rice cooker with vegetable broth, and after it cooled (in the fridge) I added the vegetables.  I used cilantro instead of parsley and I only used about 2-3 tablespoons of oil and increased the amount of lemon juice to suit my taste.  I ate this for about a week and it got better each day.  I also tried it with some feta and that was great too.  Overall an A+ recipe.

This is a tasty, festive, and gluten-free take on tabbouleh.  It's so colorful, it would make a good party dish.  I stirred in 2 tsp of minced garlic but otherwise I made no alterations to the recipe.  My only complaint is that it makes a LOT and I didn't want to try freezing it to preserve it.  I had to throw some of it out even though both my husband and I were eating it for lunch for three days!

An excellent recipe. I replaced the onions with 3 cloves garlic and it was still good. One minor quibble: it takes much, much longer to prepare this recipe than 30 minutes, since you have to let the quinoa cool after cooking. You should budget at least 3 hours, and preferably overnight.

Delicious. I used vegtable broth in place of water (I did not salt the water therefore) and red onion instead of green. I added fresh ground pepper to taste. Just another note: the recipe calls for "parsley" and flat Italian parsley is far superior in tabbouleh than the curly variety. I had never heard of/ tried quinoa before this recipe. I can't say I like it better than bulgar tabbouleh, but definitely as much.

Mmmm, so yummy!  I used a bit of minced garlic in place of the green onion due to allergies, and I also cooked the quinoa in low-sodium chicken broth in place of plain water.  (Obviously this negates the vegetarian aspect of the recipe, but boy, is it great on flavor!)  I will definitely be making this again, and experimenting further.

I'm not sure if Tabbouleh was meant to taste like this, but it was just okay. Very fresh but not a lot of flavor and the use of green onion and parsley was weird. The flavors clashed causing this blan-ness. Again not sure if it's meant to taste like this but won't make again.

I made this minus the carrots, but it's not a recipe we liked.  It wasn't disgusting, it just wasn't for me.  I think it was a texture issue and I didn't care for the mixed flavors.  I tried adding some black pepper and garlic powder, but still didn't like it.  Thanks for sharing, but I won't try this recipe again.

Not a fan, although I did use cilantro instead of parsley.  Too dry.  Didn't like all the leaves of the cilantro.  Used food processor for carrots and didn't use tomatoes.

super tasty, but needs salt.  wash quinoa before boiling it.  Added crumbled feta and sweet corn...could switch parsley to cilantro for a southwestern feel.

Made 1.5 times the recipe for a 4th of July potluck and it was just the right amount.  I liked the proportions of everything as they were - well, I did actually add more quinoa; used a full 2 cups for the 6 serving portion I made, and liked it this way.  The key is to buy very good tasting tomatoes!  I used small organic cherry tomatoes bursting with flavor and halved or quartered them; didn't bother to seed them.  Did not seed cucumber either.  Fresh lemon juice in the full amount.  I used all parsley and it was fine; again, use good quality parsley.  I left the carrots out; couldn't picture in Tabouli but may try another time; would also like to experiment with using garbanzo beans to make it a full entree.  I did add a small amount of mint. I think it's best if you cut the tomatoes and cucumbers pretty small.  Another person brought a quinoa salad with black beans and people enjoyed them both.

We enjoyed this dish, but we'll try cilantro in place of parsley next time. This was my first experience cooking with quinoa...and had to buy a double mesh strainer to accommodate those tiny little grains!

Lose the carrots and cukes and add 1/2 tsp. or more (according to taste)
of allspice - that is the secret ingredient!

It's tasty but i must clear 1 point it's nothing close to tabouleh. I am lebanese and tabouleh is traditional dish in lebanon. This is more close to fatoush from tabouleh.

Per others' suggestions, I used veggie broth to cook quinoa, grape tomatoes sliced in half, and added feta. I think this will be much better when we actually have garden fresh veggies again, especially tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

This is good enough for company with no changes, or you can vary it a bit with veggies you have on hand. The dressing is nicely balanced. It is also a fast, beautiful and tasty side for family that even the little ones like, and also contains a fair amount of protein.

I reduced the quinoa to 1/4 cup uncooked, reduced onions to 1/2 cup and increased the chopped parsley to two cups plus...it makes it more like the tabboulleh you get in Lebanese restaurants. I prefer the parsley dominant type of tabboulleh. The dressing is good. The carrots are a nice idea.

Great recipe I had never cooked quinoa before so that was interesting but I've since made this about four times this month. I added 2 minced cloves of garlic because I had garlic in my other dishes and wanted to carry it thru. It's really good.

Good recipe but I found it lacked depth of flavor.  After adding the below suggestions, it was much better:
1.  Add some garlic
2.  Cut the amount of lemon juice by 1/3rd
3.  Add Feta cheese
4.  Add a can of black beans

Absolutely delicious!! I sprinkled a little cumin on top and mixed in for more flavor. It tastes better after it sits a day or two.

This was so delicious. I didn't have a whole cup of quinoa,I had to add 1/2 cup of barley, but it was still very good.  I omitted the carrots(no other changes) and served it stuffed in a soft warm pita with sliced avocado sprinkled with feta. I added a can of garbanzos to the leftovers. This recipe will be a frequent meal in our house.Thank you for posting this!

I had to write a review on this recipe. I've been making it for a couple of years but have recently stopped eating meat & rediscovered how much I LOVE this recipe. Sprinkle with a little feta and wrap it in a whole grain tortilla. Yummy!

Great recipe.  I skipped the carrots and added a can of rinsed chick peas. I really like using quinoa instead of bulghur wheat. but I only used 1/2 c because I like taboulleh loaded with veggies.

Love to make this recipe, the 12 of us like so much.  The aroma goes right through the house from the green onions, garlic and parsley and I added crumbled feta cheese.  I could eat this every day.

I used less quinoa and more of the vegetables: parsley, cucumber, green onion and tomato. I've never seen carrots in tabouli, so I left them out. I also used more lemon juice and Himalayan Sea Salt to bring the flavors together. It was amazing!! Love that it's gluten-free, and tastes almost the same as regular tabouli!!

I love this fresh salad. I did make some changes as well. I did not put carrots in mine. I used red onion instead of the green onions, and I added some garlic for zing!

There are a lot of suggestions here that are great:  cut back on the oil, add cilantro, add lemon zest, add chick peas, add minced red onion, add a bit of garlic.  I also liked the suggestion to add cumin.  In my haste, I reached for the curry powder rather than the cumin.  I discovered what I was doing about 1/4 tsp into adding curry powder.  This however, is what really made it.  I went back and grabbed some cumin too, but altogether really spectacular.  Funny what mistakes can do for you sometimes!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe and I make it at least once a month and for potlucks and bar-b-ques.  We live in Hawaii, so this tabbouleh is refreshing for us all year.  Hubby makes sure to request it if I don't make it soon enough.  I NEVER measure any of the ingredients, I just do it to taste.... Plenty of lemon and a little more salt.  YUM!

Excellent recipe, I chopped everything very small and served it with pita and feta cheese. My favorite way to eat it is to chop the pita bread into strips, spoon some of the tabbouleh on each piece, and sprinkle feta on top.

A great recipe. Make sure to dice the tomatoes and cucumbers as small as possible. Mini-cucumbers are even better. And add some crushed garlic for  more taste.

This was really good and tasted very fresh.  I added black beans to my plate just before serving as a vegetarian meal and others had it as a side dish. Great both ways. Also would be good over salad for a protein hit. I Reduced oil and lemon to 1/8 cup -- still seemed a bit too oily for me. Left out the onions because I dont like them. Thank you for a very nice dish using quinoa.

I loved it, I did not have a fresh lemon but I did have a fresh lime so I used that instead, I cooked the Quinoa in chicken broth and I chopped up the veggies very small with a small electric chopper to make them less noticeable to my boys.  It turned out delicious.  My boys gave it a good try some liked it, some not.  but I will definitely make again for myself.  Next time I may not add so much olive oil, I don't think it needed a full 1/4 cup.

Since I'm not a fan of parsley, and I'd never even tasted quinoa before, I wasn't sure how this would turn out. Have to say that I absolutely LOVE this super easy, super flavorful, refreshing little salad! Made it exactly as written, and it was superb. Next time I think I'll use a combination of parsley and mint, and add some goat's cheese or feta. Thanks so much!

Very good recipe! I did have to make some changes based on what I had in my pantry and reviewer suggestions - didn't have parsley, had only 1 carrot and Japanese cucumber. I also thought I'd pump up the flavor so I dumped a small packet of feta cheese with Italian seasoning and the accompanying oil. Woohoo! That hit it out of the park. Should be a staple in my household for a while.

This is spectacular.  I needed to spice it up a bit, so added a dash of cumin, cayenne pepper and turmeric.
Awesome dish.  I think it's the combination of smooth, mellow quinoa with the more crispy, crunchy vegetables.  IMHO I'm think that's the key to any good recipe.

This was a huge hit.  So refreshing too, and gets better the longer it sits.  Used canned tomatoes instead of fresh but it was still great.

Excellent.  As suggested from a few other reviews, I added a splash of red wine vinegar, cilantro instead of parsley and garlic. I also removed the seeds from the tomatoes. 
I could eat this everyday!!

I took this to a pot-luck at my church and the bowl was cleaned out! so many people asked for the receipe we ended up making copies to go around. i will use this one many more times! I only had one change which was to add 1/8 cup red wine vinegar - gave it a zing that everyone loved.

A very easy, healthy recipe.  I agree that the flavor can be kind of bland, but that's basically how traditional tabouli tastes, so if you add other stuff to it....feta, beans, etc. I don't think it classifies as tabouli....just my opinion.  Love it just as is.

Very good! Followed the recipe exactly and added crumbled feta to individual servings. The 3 yr old and 9 yr old both loved - it's a winner!

This was good, but I found that I prefer a traditional tabbouleh to this one. The flavors were all there, I just prefer the texture of bulgar wheat to the quinoa.

Tabbouleh is a favorite summer dish at our house, and I was pleased to see that quinoa works so well in substitution for the bulgar wheat.  It will make a good wheat-free dish to take to summer parties.

I made a few substitutions and a few additions, based on what I had in the house.  I used up an over abundance of cherry tomatoes, substituted red bell pepper for crunch of the celery,skipped the carrots and used red onion instead of scallions.  I also added feta cheese, black olives and fresh mint from my garden, in addition to the parsley.  All this boosted the flavor considerably, besides adding protein to make this a wonderful main dish.

I made this as is, and it was bland. Something was very missing. I even put in the chicken broth, and cumin as others have suggested, but to no avail. Bland, bland, bland! Made this for a party, and there was A LOT leftover!!!!!!

This was pretty good. I like the texture of bulgur in tabbouleh better than the softer texture of quinoa, though. Dressing was very nice. Thanks!

This is a fantastic salad or main dish. It's a light and healthy lunch. I've made it numerous times as written and have been nothing but pleased each time. I've also started playing with this recipe and found that I prefer it with only 1/8 c. olive oil and now always add feta cheese.

LOVED this recipe!! I put most of the veggies in my food processor which makes it a fairly no fuss recipe that results in a decently impressive dish. It has an exotic flavor without being too bizarre for timid tasters. It's a fun dish to bring to a brunch or potluck because it seems rather gourmet, but it's really quite easy to whip up.

I made this as is the first time around, and it was fantastic.  The second time I only had one bunch of green onions on hand.  I liked it even better with less onion.  The other vegetables were more flavorful.  Either way, this recipe is wonderful.

This took a long time to make.  It is a cold refreshing dish with all of the veggies **but** is too bland for all the work involved which is disappointing.  When I make it next, I am cutting out 1/2 the olive oil and adding balsamic vinegarette & some spices.  Also, the carrots just didn't seem to meld.  I'll omit them next time.  Overall, with some tweaking - this is a great healthy recipe especially for my little vegetarian.

Awesome cold salad.  I used 1/8 cup lemon juice and 1/8 cup champagne vinegar and it was amazing.  Left out the carrots because I didn't have them on hand.  I added grilled asparagus and corn shaved from the cob to the leftovers and it was incredible.  Would eat it every day!

I love this!  I omitted the tomatoes, and used all organic ingredients (including fresh squeezed lemons!).  Quinoa is a great food and this is a good way to have it.  I've made it twice now and the second time I used my hand powered food processor (forgot the name of the durn thing, but they sell them at state fairs and such).  This will become a staple recipe for me.

Very yummy when you first make it, and even better after it refrigerates for a few days.  My husband was not a quinoa fan until I made this for him.  Now he eats all the leftovers.

How can something so healthy be SO GOOD?!  This will become a regular in my recipe rotation.  I can't wait to see how it is with red quinoa.

For those who crave some meat (or extra protein), I added three boneless skinless chicken breast halves.  Lightly sprinkle them with salt, pepper, cumin, cardamom, and turmeric and cook them on the stove top.  Cool them in the fridge and cut into small cubes, then add to the other ingredients.

I love this recipe and keep a dish as a staple. I have celiac disease so its great to come by delicious and easy recipes such as this. I do like to add a pinch of salt per serving as it really brings out the flavors.

I used 2 tomatoes, dry parsley and purple onion instead of green onion - it still turned out very good.  Sliced black olives will go nicely in this recipe too.

My husband and I made this thinking it was going to be really good bc of the high rating.  It was really bad tasting.  If you don't know you already like it, I wouldn't try it if I were you.

Very good! I took someone's advice and added feta cheese, but only to each individual serving--didn't want it getting mushy in the frige. It also needed cumin and freshly ground black pepper. I've made tabbouleh with couscous before, and it would work great here, but the quinoa is so healthy that it's hard to justify the swap. I think this would be excellent with finely diced fresh jalepeno and cilantro or mint leaves (leave out cucumbers and parsely).

Very "fresh" tasting!  I made exactly as written, and thought it was very good.  However,  I thought it could use just *bit* more flavor, so added some feta - which I thought made something that was already good, even better!  It makes A LOT - and since I'm the only one in my house that will eat it, next time I'll halve the recipe.

I suggest adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint!  - This is a key ingredient in all tabbouleh recipes!  Also, this serves a lot more than 4.  I'd say 8-10!

Excellent dish.  This was my husband's first experience with quinoa and he loved it.  I did tweak it a little by adding kalamata olives and feta cheese, but it was great without either as well.  I also cooked the quinoa in chicken broth as others had suggested.  I served it at a family dinner, with three young children and one teenager, and everyone thought it was a keeper.

As written, this is three stars but has the potential to be five.  I followed another reviewer's advice and let the quinoa soak overnight, rinsing it a few times before cooking so it was nice and fluffy when I was ready for it.  I didn't have broth, so stuck with the instructions and cooked in water (oops, forgot to put salt in water).  Used 1/2 the oil and didn't have tomato so added two ounces of crumbled feta and minced garlic.  I only used 1/2 bunch of green onion and eyeballed a cup of parsely.  Definitely needs something so I added a tbspn vinegar (next time I'll use balsamic for a kick) and pinch of sugar since I had to use the concentrated-type lemon juice and that can be bitter.  I made the dressing separately so I could taste it (put the garlic in the dressing).  This makes way more than four servings (I ended up with six cups w/o all the tomatoes!).  My version brings the calorie count down to 175 per cup.

This is one of our favorite dishes.  I can't believe I've waited so long to rate it!  I've made it multiple times, and it's perfect.  I add a few cloves of garlic because it just seem unnatural to have garlic-less tabouleh.  We smother pita with hummus, add the tabouleh, and sprinkle feta on top.  Delish!  My only hesitation in making this is all the chopping that goes into it.  I am planning on purchasing a food processor just so I can make this more often!

I substituted the green onions for leek. The salad didn't have much taste so I added generous amounts of garam masala.

First let me say that quinoa and tabbouleh (separately) are two of my favorite foods.  Then let me say --- I NEVER thought about using one to make the other.  BRILLIANT!  I changed the recipe to fit what I had on hand (fresh tomatoes and basil) and ended up with sort of a Tuscan version of this dish.  With a drizzling of olive oil and balsamic, a dash of kosher salt and a bit of fresh cracked pepper -- this has become one of my favorite weekday (actually ANY day) lunch!  Thanks for an easy, healthy and super-delicious recipe!

This is such a great light dish.  I used cherry tomatoes, only 1 or 2 tablespoons oil, and a 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, which added a ton of flavor to this dish. I topped with feta too and ate this for lunch many days in a row! It just keeps getting better tasting!

YUM!!  This does make a lot and since I'm single, I will be eating it all week.  I used fresh basil instead of parsley since I bought for another recipe.  I also added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and 1/2 a can of chickpeas, since I love those.  I think I will sprinkle some feta on it for lunch tomorrow. This is my first time making quinoa and I'm very happy with this recipe. I've actually made pretty much the same thing in the summer using whole wheat rotini.

Fabulous!  I love the flavor of tabbouleh but was never crazy about the bulger.  This is so good and the high protein content of Quinoa makes it a great meal all by itself.

This is my first review. I feel that I owe it to the site to write one or two reviews since I use these recipes everyday. This is a wonderful recipe and I have made it with quinoa, white rice and brown rice. It turned out great all three ways. When I make it for company they ask what is the dressing and are always suprised to find out that olive oil, lemon juice, salt and I add garlic (1 clove grated). Thanks for such a great healthy recipe to use such an unique grain.

Great recipe!  Based on another review I swapped out cilantro for the parsley and it was delicious.  I was out of green onions, but I'm sure they would have been perfect.  It did feel like it needed more zing so I added about 5 cloves of garlic - no joke - it had a good bite, but probably more than most people would like.  I'm excited to add this to my regular rotation!!

From now on, I'm making my tabbouleh with quinoa! Added goat cheese, which worked well with the salad. I may add garlic to the next batch. Thanks for the recipe!

I found this to be kind of bland, not worth all of the effort of chopping and grating.

The quinoa adds a much nuttier taste to the salad than bulger, but both ways make a great tabbouleh.  I substituted red onion for the green onions, left out the carrots for a more traditional tabbouleh and added one clove of garlic minced to the dressing...YUMMY!!!

I added a splash of quince white balsamic vinegar, which gave a really  subtle sweetness and clean finish of the flavors.  I had never had quinoa before, but my fiance and I loved it - more mild than bulgur - and it is a complete protein on its own. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I added some lemon zest, used only one large tomato and had no scallions so I used about 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion.  I also had a few sprigs of fresh mint left over so I chopped that up with the parsley.   Made a tasty lunch with some toasted pita bread and hummus.

This was my first quinoa recipe and it is delicious and full of flavor.  I used canned petite in garlic/onion, well drained.  It added just a bit more flavor.  The quinoa is easily cooked and I did not soak mine, but did rinse well.  Added a few diced water chestnuts and gave it a bit more crunch!  Yummy!

I give this one a 4 1/2!!  Excellent using the quinoa-much better than the chewy bulgur...the only thing I did different was to add one vegetarian boullion cube to the boiling water dissolving it before pouring it over the quinoa. I also added some fresh ground black pepper.  Great recipe!! My husband loved it too!!

Excellent! My whole family enjoyed (husband and my 3.5 year old daughter) I tossed it with a few tablespoons of balsamic vinagrette and it was perfect.  Great light summer salad.

I LOVE this! Tabbouleh is one of my favorite salads, but I had never made it before.  I cook quinoa a lot. So, I had to try this.  It has quickly become a family favorite.  I took it to a potluck brunch and I lost count of how many people wanted the recipe.  The only change I made was to use a whole bunch of parsley instead of just a cup, but that's just because I like my tabbouleh with a strong parsley flavor.

GREAT, GREAT! GREAT!!!!  If I could, I would give this a 10 out of 5!!!!!  I use cilantro instead of parsley.  I think this added a touch more flavor.  Next time I might try a bit of shrimp in this.  One of the best recipes off this sight.  I served it on Pita bread and baked Vidalia onions as a side.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

Really good - my first experience using quinoa.  I have to say that I am a novice at cooking it though...needed more time and was still a little wet.  however the tabbouleh was good.  I used less oil and added some basil for additional flavor.  thanks for the post!

Mmmm... sooooo good.   I actually ended up adding some roasted red pepper vinagrette dressing to it.   Not too much... just to give it a little kick.... it needed it.   With this addition and sitting over night it was amazing and didn't make it through the next day.    I did not use as much oil as called for... perhaps half the amount.  I also cooked my quinoa in veg broth seasoned with garlic powder.  So fresh!!!

yum! It's been extremely hot here, and I needed something that was light and didn't require a lot of stove time. This was perfect. I didn't have quinoa, so I used couscous instead. It worked perfectly. I had to makes some subsitutions just because of what I had on hand (I didn't have any parsley, and I forgot to buy olive oil last time I was at the store so I used sunflower oil instead), it was still delicious. This one is a keeper! Edit: okie I tried it with the olive oil, and the parsley and it was awesome!  A have a huge bowl of this that I am going to eat for days.

This is a very light and refreshing salad for summer and my first attempt to make anything with quinoa.  It is a VERY healthful grain and contains a lot of protein.  I ate a small bowl of this and was full for hours!  Great for dieters because it tastes good, too!

So delicious and simple!  I used cilantro in place of parsley, and chopped the carrots instead of grating them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This will become a new regular on my menu!  

This is my first experience with quinoa, and I'm looking forward to finding new ways to use it.

Great recipe. Made in advance and took camping with us. Feta cheese made it awesome. Only change is that I would reduce the oil and juice next time -- got a little watery. Light and delicious, though -- resulted in "happy campers," for sure.

this is light and refreshing and delicious! I used a slight variation on the veggies, cucumber, green onion and red pepper... otherwise I did the recipe exact. I think it needs some freshly ground black pepper. That would make it a 5 star in my book.

Thank you for this great recipe!  I've been trying to find a way to work more whole grains into my diet and this was perfect.  I did cut back on the olive oil to save on fat and calories but the lemon really brightens the flavor.  Also this will store in the refrigerator for a good 3-4 days and still taste great.  Also, I didn't have any fresh parsley on hand so I used dried and it still tasted great.  I'll be eating this all summer!

Delicious! I used 4 carrots, only 1 bunch of onions, and the whole bunch of parsley.  Fresh lemon tastes much better on this than the bottled lemon juices I made the recipe with it. 
Will definitely make this again!

This was great!  I did make some changes based on the previous reviews (and what I had on hand) -- added Feta and Kalamata Olives, used red onion instead of green onions, added a splash of Apple Cider Vinegar, used cherry tomatoes -- it turned out great!

I made this this morning to go with dinner.   I have been stealing spoonfuls all morning!   I finally got a bowl of it for lunch - as it is soo very good.  I did use 1 1/2 cup quinoa - per others suggestions.   I added a little fresh cilantro, but prefer the fresh parsley.   I do not think it is bland, or lacking as some other reviewers suggested.   I tasted the dressing before adding it to the rest of the ingredients and I was doubtful, but decided to make it as written the first time.   Thanks for a healthy and delicious recipe!   Oh - I did use chicken broth instead of water.

I added about twice the parsley, two rather than one cucumber, one rather than two carrots, plus about half a cup of diced fresh mint. Also I heated a couple more Tbs olive oil in a skillet and slightly toasted the cooked quinoa with additional sea salt and a bit of pepper before letting it cool and adding it to the dish. Served it as a side dish along with tzatziki and loved it! :-D

I used cilantro and parsley since I had both and and it tasted great. I also just used whatever I had in the fridge which makes this recipe so flexible. I used cucumber, cauliflower, radishes and sliced black olives, I just wish I had feta. The dressing is great. Thanks!

I really liked this salad. I added about a teaspoon of cumin and somed halved kalamata olives as others suggested. This recipe made way more than I anticipated, not that that's a bad thing; I just had to get out a bigger bowl. However, I must take issue with the "Ready in 30 minutes" assessment. The chopping alone took me nearly an hour! For this reason, I think I will only be making this very occasionally for a potluck or something.

This was a fresh tasting healthy salad!  I used cherry tomatoes and one bunch of green onions instead of two.  I highly recommend organic parsley.

BTW the traditional tabbouleh, which is the best, doesn't include neither carrots, nor cucumber! 
Simply mix parsley, tomatoes, geen onions or even normal onions, here the recipe calls for quinoa instead of burghul (buglur) which is also good. Add some salt, a lot of lemon juice and some olive oil, you will never try anything else after tasting!!

Nice light flavors. A little lemony but I like lemon. Would be very easy to add other ingredients. I used cukes and carrots and feta. I'm sure the green onions add a nice bite, too.

Fresh, healthy, and almost anyone can eat it it. (gluten free people, non dairy people, vegans, etc.) I read a lot of the reviews and I added all the suggestions; cumin, fresh mint, a little honey. But it still seemed to need something. For me, that something was chopped walnuts. A handful really made this dish better.

This recipe was fabulous!  I added cumin like another reviewer recommended and also doubled the quinoa and added more of the vegetables and a little more olive oil.  We ate it with pita bread and some hummus.  I will definitely make this again.

I, too, subbed out the parsley for cilantro like others. I also used grape tomatoes and cut them in quarters. I thought about adding feta cheese but between the strong flavors of the lemon juice and cilantro, it didn't need anything else. It turned out really well!

I've made this recipe a number of times, each time I felt like it was missing something.  This recipe is great if you add feta cheese.

One time I didn't have Fetta Cheese so I added apples and raisins, and it was pleasantly wonderful!

Delicious. I made this on a Sunday afternoon to have on hand for the coming week's lunches, but can't stop taking a few more bites when I go past the fridge!  Kids loved it and requested it in their lunches also. I added halved, pitted kalamatas. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I loved this recipe thought it needed a little something and ate it with pita chips.  I'm on a 21 day Daniel diet and looking for great recipes to get lots more vegetables and grains.  My daughter asked if she could have some of my diet food and ate it in a pita pocket. I told her it wasn't diet food I was just eating healthier. She loved it too. I'm totally sharing it with friends.

I think it is great as it is. I did add a little chopped celery, bell pepper and mint. Great with chummas and home made pita bread!!!! Do not listen to the reviewer that said to wash the quinoa.Uncooked you will loose it through the collander and most screens. Even with minimal processing it comes washed. I've never had bitter quinoa! I prefer Vidalia onion to green but its good both ways. Avoid adding garlic or spices if it is to be served the traditional way with spicey Chummas. The combination of cool and lemmoney goes well with the earthy flavour of a zippy chummas.This is better than bulgar wheat and has more protien. It's my go to recipe for tabbouleh!Thank You!

I made a few substitutions out of necessity .. didn't have lemon or vinegar in the house but i do have mild vinegary hot sauce so i used a good bit of that .. came out spicy but not too and delicious. I feel like i must be doing something wrong though because not only did i not find this filling (I ate a good sized cup plus portion) but I felt even hungrier afterwards than before! Still delicious though and even better with age as stated.

This is a perfect base, but could use a boost.  I added lemon zest, 2 cloves of minced garlic, and chopped fresh mint.  I found all the original proportions worked well for me.  These additions makes this a five-star recipe and a keeper.

The cilantro feta substitution makes this perfect. A touch more sea salt to combat the previously notes blandness and seriously one of the best side dishes ever.

I tried this recipe and it was quite good as a quick , healthy meal. I added some chicken slices and I like to add more olive oil and lemon than required in the recipe, but it makes for a great dish! Also, the parsley makes the dish.

As a big fan of Quinoa and Tabbouleh, I really wanted this recipe to succeed! I used chicken broth to cook the quinoa like someone else had suggested. I didn't have cucumber or green onion but I did use zucchini and summer squash which I sauteed in olive oil until tender. I also didn't add carrots because I've never had Tabbouleh with carrots and it didn't sound good. Everything else I followed exactly and it turned out amazing!

I loved the way the quinoa came out using this method!  I will do it that way from now on.  I'm not sure if I liked the carrots in this salad, they kind of took over (I grated them finely) and it seemed inconsistent with all the other neatly diced vegetables.  They tasted good, though!

I did not like this recipe.  It had no taste sorry. I had to add almond slivers and currents also more salt.

I thought this was very good. It is such a healthy recipe! I followed the advice and cut the olive oil and added the apple cider vinegar. The only other I do, is sprinkle a bit of feta cheese on top when I eat it. It gives it a nice sharpness.

Finally found something vegan that my daughter and son-in-law really loved.  This is a really good salad.  I used a little more lemon juice and I used the Far East brand of quinoa.

I just made this recipe and couldn't wait for it to "age" and ate some right away! Very good! I omitted the carrots, and added zest from the lemon. Also seasoned with fresh ground black pepper. Also, I just topped it with some cottage cheese. Really good and healthy!

This was very yummy.  I didn't think I would like it as much as I did.  It was also very simple to make.  Supposedly, quinoa is good for you, so I will definately make it again.

This recipe was a total winner. I used leftover quinoa that was made with vegetable broth. I also added a couple tablespoons of currents that I softened in raspberry vinegar for 10 minutes. My family loved it and I will make this again and again. Easy and delicious and healthy.

Wonderful! I did not use the carrots and only used 1 bunch of green onions. The cucumber I had was pretty large so did not use all of it. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was great!

So after trying this recipe once and liking the fresh light taste I've now gone back and made it more to my style while adding depth of flavor.  My changes to the recipe were to add in two serrano peppers, minced, sub out one bunch of green onion for a medium red onion, chopped.  I also added fresh ground black pepper, to taste.  Now it's like a light pico de gallo with quinoa, for protein, and other veggies.  I'm really happy with the way it came out, and it's good to eat by itself or with tortilla chips just like pico!  Nice, light, healthy, and pretty cheap to make.

Very fresh, very tasty!  We did, however, miss the consistency of couscous because quinoa is much lighter and fluffier  :)

This is a great recipe!  I've been looking for quinoa recipes that are kid-friendly, and this fit the bill.  I started light on the lemon and parsley so my kids wouldn't find it overpowering, but I think I will make it just as the recipe calls next time.

I have mint going crazy in my garden and was looking for recipes to use some of it.  I haven't had much quinoa, but it works in this tabbouleh (have used bulgur before.)  A nice, healthy snack to eat with pita bread.

This was just lovely... I made a huge batch, and it came out slightly bland for my tastes. However, I remedied that by making a small concoction of lemon juice, olive oil and salt to add in my individual bowl. I will be making this so often it'll become slightly unhealthy. (btw, I omitted the carrots)

Update: America's Test Kitchen advises you de-seed tomatoes, put them in a colander with salt and let them sit for 30 min or so to draw out the liquid. It's a little time consuming, but it's an excellent way to keep those tomatoes from getting too mushy... Also, remember to de-seed cucumbers as most of their water is in their seeds... 

This dish astounds me every time I make it, it's awesome!

Liked it, but will love it with a little tweaking. I wouldn't say it was bland, but a tad more simple than I thought it would be. Next time I will add garlic & some green peppers. I'd rather add more veggies than keep it super close to tabbouleh I guess. But it's still pretty good. Also~ if you have super juicy tomatoes I'd put them in a strainer for awhile. Mine turned out quite sloppy, but I know it's not the recipe it is th tomatoes!

The combination of the lemon juice and tomatoes gives this a very acidic taste which overpowers anything else.

An excellent healthy salad. I took reviewers advice and really tweaked this. I cooked the quinoa in lite chicken broth, so it needed no salt. Only 1/8 C. of olive oil. 5 green onions, finely chopped. My greens were a mix of cilantro, parsley and mint. I think I'll increase greens another 1/2 cup next time. They are so good and healthy. (YUM!) Cherry tomatoes, sliced. Two heads of crushed fresh garlic, a dash each of cumin, cinnamon, curry. WILL make again!

Delicious! But I kept reading in the reviews that it was missing something, so I used 2 c. vegetable stock to cook the quinoa instead of water (and no pinch of salt). I also added a drained small can of sliced black olives, and a container of crumbled feta cheese. Amazing! And it's for a friend's wedding tomorrow, so I'm looking forward to how everyone says it gets better the longer it sits...

This is the first time I have cooked with quinoa and is quite easily the most delicious guilt free food I have ever made!  I didn't have green onions; substitued shallots and added lemon zest.  All reviews seem to say "refreshing" and I would agree!  I will make this again and again and try suggested variations (feta, cumin, less oil)  I love love this dish!!

Fist time cooking quinoa and it was mushy, so I subbed in whole wheat couscous.  I left out the carrots too.  This was very light and flavorful.  Not too acidic or sharp.  Try with hummus and falafels.

Great recipe!  I used more tomatoes and cucumbers than called, added approximately 2 tbs each of dried parsley and dried mint and added 4 oz crumbled feta, and omitted the carrots. Vey good!

I'm a new fan of quinoa and have been experimenting with it every time I find a new recipe.  I found this to be a bit bland, so I added 3 T curry, 1 t. cumin and 1/2 t. cinnamon.  Also, I prefer onions cooked, so I browned them with some garlic, then proceeded with the rest of this recipe.

Had 2 C quinoa left over from dinner a couple days ago. Followed recipe, except substituted zucchini for cucumber and added finely chopped radishes--needed to use up veggies, cut oil in half. Loved it! Took samples to WW meeting to share with friends, they loved it too!

Different, definitely a texture that I am not used to. This was my first attemt at using quinoa in a recipe or at all for that matter. I did like the fresh taste and I used both parsley and cilantro, mostly cilantro. The flavor combination reminded me of a fresh tomato salsa or the ceviche that I buy at a local Hispanic market.

I made this today as an app w/ multigrain pita chips & it was a hit! Such fresh flavors.  Followed recipe as described except: added 1/2 tsp ckn bouillon to the water when cooking quinoa.  Only used 1 bunch scallions...I love onion, but 2 bunches would've overpowered!  Didn't include carrots b/c of time/didn't feel like grating them...didn't really miss them.  I used 3 plum tomatoes (author didn't specify what type of tomatoes) & removed seeds.  This was delicious!  No need to add garlic, cumin as others mentioned...fresh flavors were enough!  Make a few hours ahead of time to let flavors meld.  Will make this again as a side dish or app...love that it's tasty, has great protein/is healthy!!  Makes a lot, but will eat left-overs for dinner when my husband travels.  Yum!

What a delicious substitute for bulger! I always have quinoa on hand too! I added olives instead of carrots as another reviewer suggested to appeal to my salt tooth.

This is a good base recipe. Obviously salt and pepper to taste. I added some grilled chicken and feta cheese. I also added cumin and cooked my quinoa in chicken broth with sauteed onion and garlic. Without my additions it would have been quite bland I think.

I enjoyed this more than traditional tabbouleh.  The only suggestion I have is to cut down on the parsley, but that was just a personal preference.

I halved the lemon because my husband is very sensitive to lemon flavor, but I think it would have been fine with the full amount. It needs something else for more flavor, perhaps a little crumbled feta or some sort of herbal additions.

Loved it. Just wish I had let the quinoa cool a little more before adding it to the veggies. 3 out of 4 of my kids ate it up and it was so colorful!! Will be making it again.

I have made this recipe many times since I discovered it this Spring. I absolutely love it. I usually add some crumbled feta and sliced black olives for a bit of saltiness. One question, the recipe calls for 2 bunches of green onion that seemed rather excessive to me. I use 4 or 5 single scallion and it seems just right. Thanks for sharing.

tastes like tabbouleh! I didn't have cucumbers, but added a bit more lemon juice and extra parsely and pepper. Its refreshing on its own, and can't wait for it tomorrow!

I gave it 5 stars beacause it is awesome, but you will need to spice it up a bit.   Add a bit of red wine vineger, perhaps some mint, maybe a few other things, it is  a bit bland, but YUMMY ant the same time......

I used red quinoa for a change of pace, skipped the carrots and put in mint rather than parsley - delicious!

I made this just now for a get-together tonight. I followed the recipe except for carrots (didn't realize we were out) and I used a little over a third of a cup of dried parsley since my grocery store seemed to be out of fresh. I always cook my quinoa with a chicken boullion cube (even though it kills the whole vegan concept) I did that instead of the pinch of salt. I was sketchy about this recipe and I had a back up plan just in case, but I think it turned out AMAZING!! I'm excited to see what the crowd thinks tonight.

This recipe is awesome!!!  This was my family's first experience with quinoa and they loved it.  Other reviewers commented on the fact there wasn't alot of flavor...seemed kind of bland.  Keeping that in mind, I cooked the quinoa in 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I substituted cilantro for the parsley and added some feta cheese before serving.  I omitted the sea salt completely.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  It's a keeper:-)

This might be my favorite quinoa recipe!
Didn't have cucumbers or carrots and substituted cilantro for the parsley. Also, added some mint. Used 2 TBLS OO and 2 TBLS lemon juice and sea salt to taste.

Really good although we thought it needed just a little something to kick it up a notch. Some crumbled feta did the trick for us. I think in the future I'll follow the advice of other reviewers who used red onion instead of green for the extra bite. An easy and delicious way to get some great veggies and whole grains.

First time I made tabbouleh with quinoa (I normally use bulgur). It was good! I added a few cloves of garlic because I can't have tabbouleh without garlic.

I love the texture that the quinoa gives this dish!  I knew I wanted the taste of tabbouleh, but didn't have any bulgur wheat in the house. I left out the carrots and cucumber, added diced red onion. Didn't have lemons so used limes instead. My tip is to add the tomatoes with the individual servings. I find that the tomatoes get mealy in the fridge, so I cut fresh tomatoes before serving. Also, I added a few cubes of feta cheese. OMG good!

I made this using couscous instead of quiona, I cook the couscous with 1 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup water.  I also seeded the cucumbers and tomatoes.  I  omit the carrots and add in 1/2 c. of feta cheese.

I really wanted to like this. It looks so good & Quinoa is so good for you. But neither me nor my husband liked it. I only make things with high reviews so maybe it was something I did wrong because a lot of people seem to like it. Unfortunately we didn't and we will not be making it again.

This was good, it just made so much! I made it for a lunch for two, but it would be better suited for a potluck or large meal, as others may have mentioned. I also used a food processor to chop everything together, which I thought made it more like traditional tabbouleh as well as saving time.

This was excellent.  I only used one bunch of green onions and didn't use the carrots, just because that is more my taste.  It was also a hit when we hadnieghbors over - I am making it again this weekend!

I can't get enough of this!  I didn't think I liked Quinoa before finding this recipe.  Make sure you rinse the quinoa before cooking to remove the bitterness.   This is great as is, but even better with Feta Cheese and Kalamata olives added in.   Also, make sure to add some fresh chopped mint.    LOVE IT!

Since I deviated from the recipe, I can only give it 3 stars.  I tried a similar recipe a friend had made a few weeks ago.  LOVE IT!  I got the recipe and between this recipe and her's, I came up with something awesome! A squeeze of lime juice makes the dish POP!  :)

I'm giving it two stars because it was easy to make; however, I didn't enjoy it.  Perhaps if I had left out the parsley or halved the amount, it would have tasted better.  As it is, I have a bowl full of this stuff, I really don't want to eat any more of it.

After finally finding quinoa, it was too expensive to use.  I subbed instant brown rice, and it worked beautifully.  I added a can of garbanzo beans, cooked the rice in chicken broth, used only 1 large bunch of green onions and added lots of garlic salt.  My husband said it was the best salad he had ever eaten.  We couldn't stop eating it.  I served it with falafal, hummus, and warmed flour tortillas.  Great recipe.  Thanks!!!

At first I made the recipe as is and it wasn't very flavorful. But I added fresh garlic and italian dressing, then put it into a wrap with cream cheese and avocado, it was amazing.

Made this into a lunch by adding feta cheese and a couple tablespoons of olive tapenade I had on hand. Added just the flavor boost I wanted. Never liked the traditional taboule with bulgar wheat, but this is great!

This recipe has potential, but is kind of boring as is.  It is very refreshing and a nice summer salad, but I agree with others who felt it was missing something.  I could definitely imagine it with cilantro and/or cumin.  I would have given it 4 stars, but my husband, who likes everything, really did not care for it.

Was easy to make and had wonderful flavor with the tomatoes and olive oil. I would use less parsley next time, but a terrific and quick summer dish!

An easy way to make tasty quinoa.  I left out the carrots.  Next time I would increase the tomatoes and decrease the olive oil.  I feel fresh parsley really makes a difference.   I added a little cumin as others suggested.  This will go into the rotation.

I used red quinoa (sometime cooked with a bit of chicken broth) and took some of the suggestions to add a little cilantro.  I've used various amounts of cucumbers/tomatoes and it's always a hit.  This is definitely a new favorite!

I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth for added flavor and I added two cloves of roasted garlic. I was trying to get rid of some cilantro so I used it instead of the parsely and it was a nice change. The flavors are good in this recipe but I did miss the chewiness that a traditional bulgur wheat gives to tabbouleh.  I didn't bother with the carrots or green onions. I added feta to the leftovers and it was really good that way.

Absolutely delicious and easy to follow!  of all the few recipes I've tried from allrecipes, this is definately the fool proof one.  The only change I made was adding a bit of apple cider vinegar (it keeps it healthy, but adds an extra punch).  Thank you for posting this, you're awsome!

The fresh parsley in that quantity is very strong.  I liked everything else about the salad but will probably substitute cilantro for the parsley next time.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  It is a refreshing change from my Lebanese grandma's bulgur tabbouleh that goes heavy on the parsley.  I make this as a side for falafel or stuff it in a pita with a little feta cheese and hummus or Lebanese style garlic sauce.

Fantastic!  So quick and easy to do and such a healthy snack for anyone - vegetarian, vegan, pregnant, diabetic, etc!  You can make loads and save it in the fridge to have over a few days - even better!  I love olives and pine nuts so have also added those!

This was also my first time cooking with Quinoa...and there is no turning back now.  What a great recipe.  Like some of the other reviewers I used just about half the oil, instead of lemon juice I used the juice from one lime, and I added chopped red pepper and feta.  It was just delicious.  Thank you for giving me the courage to use a new healthy grain!

This is the first time I cooked with quinoa, so I wasn't sure how the texture should have been after cooking. It turned out a bit mushy rather than grainy. But no one noticed! I brought it to a potluck BBQ and they enjoyed it. I too, added some cumin and garlic because I thought it needed more flavor. This is a keeper for me!

I was confused about the amount of green onions...it seemed like way too much.  There was also too much parsley...I only used 3/4 of the required amount.  We added celery and green bell peppers and omitted the cucumber (didn't have any on hand).  Delish first time with quinoa!!

I followed other reviewers advice and replaced the water with broth.  I left out the leek, added extra parsley and a tablespoon of vinegar.  It was a real crowd-pleaser.  It makes a ton- so have a big dish ready for it!

I made this last night and I chopped the carrots instead of grating them to make the Tabbouleh more crunchy. My mother and brother really liked this recipe. I found it a tad bit too lemony but if that's what you like, you'll really enjoy it. I will probably make it again but with a little less lemon juice.

This is my first recipe made with quinoa - YUM!  I love it!  I did not have all the ingredients for this recipe but what I did have was leftover pico de gallo which was very similar to what this recipe calls for.  Cucumbers, tomatoes, olive oil, onions, salt, jalapenos, limes and pepper.  Just a lovely combination of things.  Great recipe, although slightly modified I'm sure the original is even better!

I had never heard of quinoa and have recently been experimenting with different grains.  I have to say that this recipe has me looking for many more using quinoa. It is absolutely delicious with the fresh lemon juice.  The only difference I made was using chicken stock instead of water and then eliminating the pinch of salt used to boil it.  I will be making this recipe many times over!  Yummy!

Thanks for the suggestion to use Quinoa instead of the traditional bulgur wheat. I used less olive oil, but essentially the same ingredients--very good.

this was my first attempt at quinoa, and it was delicious. I made sure i rinsed it first, and i used chicken stock instead of water. I liked it warm and cold (leftovers were great!) Now I am trying more quinoa recipes from this site- I am hooked!

This was the best quinoa recipe I have ever had. I didn't have the parsley and it was sooo good. My son who hates quinoa asked for more. Will make it again without a doubt. For lunch I am going to add grilled chicken and make a meal out of it. Thanks

We love quinoa, but we thought this was just...boring. I make a tabbouleh using lentil sprouts, which is one of our favorites, but for us it didn't really work with the quinoa. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't great. Thanks, anyway.

I enjoyed this recipe very much. I actually liked it better than the tabouli sold in the large supermarket deli. I also recommend topping it with a little feta cheese.

Healthy, high-protein, and great flavor.  An excellent use for an idea-craving grain such as quinoa!  Also great for us gluten-free folks who can't eat the standard tabbouleh.

This was a wonderful, light meal for a hot day! I was about 2 tbsp shy on the lemon juice, so I went 2 tbsp less on the oil. That, coupled with draining the chopped tomatoes, gave it just the right amount of liquid. We are garlic lovers so I added 2 small cloves of crushed garlic. Otherwise, followed to the letter. I think I may try it with some fresh mint next time, but had none on hand. Used Italian, flat leaf parsley. This is a keeper as I'm always looking for meat-free items for Friday during lent. Thanks for posting!

This was awesome. I made this for Passover and everyone, including my Mother in Law, raved about this dish. My son's girlfriend asked for the recipe so she could make it for her family. I made a variation by doing about a third cilantro to two/thirds parsley, and I think it might be nice topped with some Feta Cheese.

This was very, very good...thanks for sharing the recipe. It's not difficult to make and has a lot of flavor.

This is the best recipe I've tried using quinoa.  Guests rave about this and people always ask for the recipe when I serve it as a side dish. I always use cilantro instead of parsley and it makes it taste so fresh.  Try it, you'll like it!

I just had tabbouleh for the first time at a middle eastern restaurant and I wanted some at home. This was pretty good, although I did sub fresh basil for half of the parsley out of personal taste. I think there was maybe just a bit too much lemon, but it really wasn't bad with the amount it called for.

The name is misleading, as this is not like any tabbouleh I've ever had.  I found that it was much too wet, and did not enjoy the combination of flavors.  I believe it has potential for improvement, and would consider trying it again with additional spices and leaving out some of the vegetables.

I excluded green onion, added a little bit more salt and 1tsp of ground cumin. Next time I will add cilantro and mint along with parsley. It tastes so delish today, I’m excited to have it tomorrow when all the flavors meld.

Made as written (I rinsed the quinoa as others suggested, but that was the only deviation).  I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of days before trying it and I was pleasantly suprised by how tasty this was.  I did, eventually, add more salt (I've been slowly reducing my salt intake but I'm not to this point yet).   I love onion, so the amount of green onion was perfect for me.  Thanks for posting!

We loved this recipe, my boyfriend is Lebanese and he especially loved it since it has the flavor of traditional tabbouleh, he requested that I make it at least once a week :)

Excellent recipe. I use the tricolor quinoa and added a bit if cumin to add more complexity to the flavors. I let it mature overnight and it tastes even better.

Wow! This is great. I followed someone else's advice and added the zest from the lemon that I used for the juice. When I went to my garden to cut the parsley I also grabbed some mint. We loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Love at first bite!!!  Definitely will make again... and again and again!!!  And easy too!  I made it with red quinoa, as a main course for lunch.  Some reviews say it was missing something; I say no way.  If you're like me and enjoy eating vegetarian recipes, I think the oil and lemon juice will work just fine... gives it a little bit of a bite.

I felt there was something missing.  I have company coming in a few hours and am happy I prepared it in advance so I can play with it to give it a boost.  It needs a bit of zip or something....may be better with cilantro over parsley?  I'll try again though because I like the idea.

I like tabbouleh and this version with quinoa is delicious. We ate it over a few days.  It would have been better to add the tomatoes when serving.  I will do that next time or make a smaller quantity.

I toasted the quinoa, and used 1 3/4 cups veg broth instead of water. I seasoned with lemon pepper Mrs. Dash, minced garlic, and some cracked pepper. Next time I'll add feta or perhaps goat cheese.

I cut down on the parsley because my family are not big parsley fans.  That said, I think it would have been better with the full amount.  I also used red quinoa which changed the flavor slightly.  I really liked it.  My wife however, wants me to make it again with couscous so it has a lighter grain.

Definitely will make it again.

This dish was very refreshing, but lacked the brightness of flavor I was expecting when I originally read the recipe. I highly recommend using English cucumbers since they retain their crisp and are less bitter.

I followed the recipe exactly, but ended up finishing the dish with a sprinkle of feta and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. I would definitely make again on a nice warm day.

Used instant quinoa. Omitted the olive oil and cucumbers.
Substituted the onions with green onions and used white wine vinegar along with the lemon juice.
Everyone loved it and will make this again.

My litmus test for a good recipe is whether I’m tempted to keep stuffing my face with it after I’m already full, and this passed.  I’ve been trying to find more healthy recipes that actually taste good and are easy for dopes like me to make, and this fits the bill perfectly.

I skippped the canned tomatoes and used fresh cherry tomatoes cut in fourths  instead.  Used one bunch of onions. I also added two of my favorite greek ingredients, olives and feta cheese.  This added a lot of flavor. Fresh & Delicious.

I used the same basic ingredients minus the carrots and green onions. I did add Spanish olives and mild banana peppers and it was delicious.

Very good.  I never bother washing the quinoa and have never noticed a bitter taste.  Followed the recipe as is except that I cut back a bit on the carrot and cucumber.  I would make this again, though my favourite quinoa recipe is the Quinoa Veggie Salad with Zesty Vinaigrette here on AR.

This was a fresh Summer meal which we served on a bed of lettuce.  I added some chickpeas.  I have a plain eater in the house so I didn't play with the spices.  But, I agree with other reviews it seemed like it could a bit more of something.

My family had never had quinoa before so we're not quite sure of the texture but said it was ok.  I like the fact that it can be a complete vegetarian meal so will make it again.

I made it for supper and I liked it. I do think I will change a few items like 1/2 cup less water to cook quinoa, change lemon juice to fresh squeezed orange and 1/2 tsp sugar.  Just play with it to your liking. Good.

My first time making tabbouleh - trying to use up some parsley and cucumbers!  Easy to make, flavor is good.  Wasn't my favorite recipe - maybe I'll try adding mint next time?  I'm going to explore other recipes, this was good but I feel like it could use something more for the sauce!  Oh, and I used couscous instead of bulgur/quinoa.

This is a delicious summer salad. I plan on making it often for times when an instant meal is needed. I added about  a tsp. Of fresh ground cumin and I just love the taste of Quinoa. I also used chopped cherry tomatoes.

This may be the best quinoa salad I've ever tasted!  So flavourful!  I rinsed, then  cooked the quinoa in my rice cooker to simplify things and added the zest of one of the lemons for an extra burst of lemon.  I also substituted chopped fresh chives (because I grow them) for the green onions and had to omit the cucumber because I didn't have one on hand.  It took a little time to prepare this dish, but well worth the effort!  Yum!

Absolutely delicious! I used very scant 1/4 cup of oil and cilantro instead of parsley because it makes me happy. Lots more salt needed for my taste. Makes quite a bit.. and that's good!

This is amazing for a light weekday lunch dish! I made a couple of changes based on a combination of other reviews:

- sub half the cooking water with low sodium chicken broth, I always do this for quinoa.
- Used 1/2 cup fresh parsley, 1/2 cup fresh cilantro
- added about 1 - 1/2 tsp of cumin
- added about 6 oz crumbled feta
- used a couple handfuls of grape tomatoes instead of full size ones
- cut back slightly on the green onions as 2 bunches seemed excessive in proportion to everything else. I'm glad I did, I used about 1 - 1/2 bunches and it's still a pretty powerful onion flavor (not a problem for me as I love onions, but could definitely be a turnoff)

I'd recommend letting it sit in the fridge overnight before eating/serving so all the flavors can really meld. This is a perfect work lunch for me to portion and grab in the morning to eat at my desk.  Great beginner recipe for exploring quinoa, and wonderfully customizable.

I liked it but not for picky eating kids...
Didn't add onions and substituted the carrot with a yellow bell pepper. Will absolutely make again...maybe add something salty to it cause it was a little on the bland side.

I make a version of this all the time.  I started off with the recipe that was written(which was pretty good), but have slowly evolved the recipe to better suit my tastes.  I rinse the quinoa before cooking, and I add a dash of cumin to the boiling water.  I don't use carrots, I seed my tomatoes, and I substitute about half the parsley for fresh mint.  I also substitute about a splash of the lemon juice for the same amount of apple cider vinegar, and add one minced garlic clove to the dressing.

We liked this at least as well as and maybe even better than the bulgar version. I made it with all the veggies (except the parsley) fresh from my garden, added 3 cloves of garlic and left out the carrot just because I didn't have one. It is delicious!

This is great at parties and potlucks, especially in the summer. I have an Israeli friend who really likes this variation because of the quinoa :)

Wonderful salad, I've made this several times now with not that many changes. I add red peppers, zucchini, spring onions, cuc's, carrots, lots of parsley, any veggies I have on  hand, sometimes I'll throw some feta cheese in the mix.  It's sooo good!  Great, light  salad for lunch or dinner!

This is light fresh salad. I increased the lemon juice a little, skipped the carrots, only used one tomato and added feta cheese. It went wonderful with the kabobs I made. I will make this again.

I wanted to love this.  It looks so beautiful in the picture, so fresh, healthy.....but, I didn't love it.  I found that all I could taste was an abundance of lemon and scallions.  I do love quinoa so I may try to improve it by cutting back on the lemon juice and scallions which were soooooo overpowering.   1/4 cup lemon juice....ya think that was a mistake?  That would put 1Tablespoon in every serving.

This recipe is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!  I did make some small changes, based on others' comments.  I added cumin to the recipe, used cilantro instead of parsley, and added a can of chick peas and some sliced black olives.
It tasted as good as any you would order at a Mediterranean restaurant......

I added juice of one lemon but may do less next time (1/8c).  Added cucumber, cherry tomato halves, only one bunch of green onions, and chopped carrots.  I only did a handful of parsley and cilantro, but would omit parsley in future.  Mint would be good.  This made a crazy amount for two, next time i would make half at most!

I made this for a church dinner and it was a big hit.  I took another viewers tip and made it a day ahead.  It made a difference after sitting overnight.  I am making it again for a family get together, who are all vegetarians.  I know they will love it.  I prefer quinoa over couscous and this is a perfect recipe!

Very good.  I added the vinegar, garlic, and cumin as suggested in other reviews.  I also cut the oil in half and it worked fine.  The recipe definitely makes more than 4 servings if you are using it as a side.

Followed recipe exactly, except I substituted cilantro instead of parsley.  Several reviewers felt it was missing something, and what I found is adding about a teaspoon of honey really pulled the flavors together.  I've done this too with adding baby spinach leaves and love it as a healthy snack with a side of avocado.  Gotta try this recipe - it is good :)

Best lunch to make - I've been eating this salad for my lunches at least every couple weeks. I do not add the carrots and i add a tablespoon of Feta on top. Also really delicious to add some Chickpeas. YUM!

Next time please provide a specific measurement for the green onions.  Reference to "bunches" is vague.

Absolutely wonderful.  Made it exactly as written.  Added the quinoa while it was warm to the rest of the ingredients (minus parsley) in order to help the flavors meld as I was short on time.  Added the parsley then stuck the whole deal in the refrigerator.  Had to sub 1/2 of a regular onion for the green onions as I was a space cadet at the grocery store and forgot them.  Tasted great only 1.5 hours after making, can't wait to taste it tomorrow when things have had time to blend together.

This was pretty good. I happen to really like quinoa so I didn't miss the bulgur at all. I prefer a little more grain in my tabbouleh. This was very veggie heavy. It was more like an Israeli salad with a tiny bit of grain added to bind it together. Flavors nice and simple.

this was so good.. i cut this down to 2 servings and made a few minor alterations.. subbed 1/2 tsp garlic salt for the 1/4 tsp sea salt.. used 1 roma tomato that i deseeded and one small persian cucumber for the 1/2.. only had 2 green onions.. my carrots were large so i cut one in half and used my veggie peeler to make strands and then chopped that up.. subbed cilantro as i almost never buy parsley.. added 2 T lime juice and 1/2 tsp cumin.. SO good! feta cheese would go great in this.. bf also suggested adding shrimp.. ty so much for the recipe

Being new to cooking with quinoa, I needed a side dish quinoa recipe and found this one.  It is absolutely DELICIOUS and mimics the original tabouli almost to a tee and oh so much easier to make.  I would highly recommend this recipe as one to keep on hand for company or for just a family dinner at home.

I just made this, and gave it three stars, because as written, it seems like it would be terribly bland. I'd give it four or 4.5 stars with the addition of garlic, cumin and cilantro (per others' reviews), and I used a spicy flavored vinegar in place of the lemon juice. Perhaps it will improve with age after a few hours in the fridge and some feta tossed in before serving, but as is, the ratio of quinoa to veg seems out of whack (too heavy on the quinoa), and it needs a briny element, like the feta and/or capers. It's a good base recipe, and I'm sure I'll keep it in the summer rotation, but it definitely benefits from tweaking per your family's tastes. UPDATE: I liked this just fine, but when I asked him what he thought of it, my husband said he could understand why the fresh mint was in there, but he didn't like it. I was sorry, cause I added it right before serving. Maybe it will mellow with time, and I forgot to add the feta; maybe that would have helped balance the mint flavor. I'll probably make this again, but I think I'll skip the mint.

You definitely have to put chopped fresh mint in this salad!!  Tabouli is always made with parsley and mint!!! I added the mint and it was delicious.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! I used cilantro instead of parsley as suggested by someone else, and threw in half a green pepper too since I had one to get rid of. The leftovers were great for lunches!

This is amazing!!! It's exactly what I was looking for -- but BETTER! I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it so it would feed more people. After taste-testing I did add more olive oil and lemon before serving but that was personal preference, it's perfect as written. Enjoy this amazing dish with friends, they'll thank you for it!

Great recipe. Loved by all as Passover side dish.   Added the mint and cumin at the end like the video suggest. I also made a double recipe, one would be enough.  Received lots of compliments tasted really good!

Terrific!  I had been purchasing this salad already made up and was happy to find a recipe that gave me the same great taste.  I did a few tweaks though... I went a little more traditional and used fresh mint leaves instead of parsley, skipped the carrots, and added minced bell pepper and 1 clove of crushed garlic.

This wasn't flavorful, and I felt like it was "off balance" - too much carrots, too much parsley, too much green onion. It needed cheese of some sort or another spice. My fiance who eats ANYTHING told me to never make this again. That's saying something! :( I noticed a lot of the people who liked this made changes to it. Maybe that's why they liked it. They didn't follow the recipe!

This spin on Tabbouleh works great for me. I have been looking for creative ways to eat Quinoa. I felt it was missing a certain 'bite' and added the juice from two limes (all I had, but I think it needed more). Not that I want to upset the delicate balance of flavors with over powering citrus though. No carrots were used in mine. Just a smidge more olive oil and one bunch of onions. Next time I will use 1-1/2 bunch as I felt it needed more. I also added cilantro and much more tomato. Awesome eats, think I could live on it.

Great recipe but could have used a little more flavor. We plan to use pesto on a pita with this filling next time. We are just starting out experimenting with quinoa and this was a great recipe. Made way more than 4 servings when made according to the directions.

This is definitely a summery-feeling dish.  My husband, daughter and I liked it but we still felt like it was missing something.  I'll have to make this again and see if I can improve upon the flavor based on our tastes.  Definitely worth trying...it's a nice healthful dish.

Yummy and Vegan. Yay. This is the first time I actually enjoyed quinoa. I used a little too much cooking water and thus added a little whole wheat couscous to the mix and that really seemed to improve the overall texture. I changed up the veggies a bit, including sauteed onion, zucchini, yellow summer squash, cucumber, parsley, and tomatoes. reduced the salt for heart health. Added some extra spices like Mrs. Dash Blend, salt free Spike, Magic Seasoning Blend, ground celery, tj flower pepper, white pepper, garlic powder, a little real salt, and a little melting pot garlic and wine seasoning too. Sounds like a lot of seasoning but that is how I always cook. This recipe is Awesome starter dish for eating quinoa.

This was absolutely fantastic! I am trying to eat healthier and stay away from wheat products and this is a fantastic alternative.  I didn't have carrots or cucumber or raisins, but I added an ear of corn, some fresh basil and I reduced the amount of olive oil by about a third.  I was generous with kosher salt and only used one bunch of onions. I seeded the tomatoes and added the quinoa while it was still hot to the vegetables.   i also added some steamed shrimp with old bay seasoning on them.  It was a huge hit!  The lemon was such a nice addition.  5 stars!

This was amazing! I didn't have grated carrots so i diced them instead. I also added cumin, two cubed chicken breasts and mint. I subbed the parsley for cilantro. I used chicken stock for the quinoa so I didn't have to add any extra salt.

We love this recipe. It is so colorful, flavorful, light but still filling. We served with fresh Pita and avocado slices and my husband slathered his pita with hummus before filling it up with the tabbouleh. We did make some changes based on another recipe we had looked at and what we had on hand at home: we used only 1/8 cup oil, used "grape" tomatoes instead, added about 1/2 cup canned garbonzo beans (deskinned), instead of parsley which I hate we used 10 leaves of chopped mint, also a dash of cumin, 2-4 cloves of garlic and some crumbled feta. We will probably make this for the rest of our lives we love it so much. Thanks!

I thought this was super-delightful. I didn't put in the green onions because I didn't have them, and I think it would have been better with them. But even without, it was nice, light and refreshing.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good, but a tad bland so I added some sun-dried tomatoes and a tsp of cumin and that made it perfect.  I'll be making this often, thanks for a yummy quinoa recipe!

Love this!!  This was actually my first time using Quinoa and it was a great introduction.  I took some of the other reviewers advice and added a bit of feta and some kalamata olives.  Excellent!!

Loved it!  I was a huge fan of bulgur tabouli then learned recently that I'm gluten intolerant so this is a great replacement.  I made it exactly as directed except I cooked the quinoa in my rice cooker.

I'd never made anything like this before. It was quite good, but didn't stand out as being a dish I want to make frequently. I may add a bit of garlic next time.

This was delicious!  Easy to prepare and great to take to work for lunch, as it doesn't need to be refrigerated.  I added feta cheese, substituted cilantro for the parsley and reduced the olive oil to 1/8 C.  I will make this again and again!

Quite a good salad, I like to add lots of other veges, whatever I've got on hand usually works well in it, the only thing I did differently was to make the vinaigrette separately so I could taste it first.  A good way to use quinoa

I liked this very much. Very good.  It was a big hit with my husband, he wanted it in his lunch everyday.  He said it was a refreshing change from a sandwich.  Quinoa is hard to get here and really expensive.  I would make it more often if it was easier to get.

Very good, used the food processor, and made everything tiny dice....easy to scoop with tortillas or pita.  Fresh lemon juice only, not the bottled stuff! I added some garlic also, and a handful of mint. Yummy!

I did not love this recipe. I felt that the lemon/olive oil dressing was too.. sharp.. I guess is the correct word, you tasted them too specifically - it did not blend with the rest of the dish. I like the idea and simplicity of the dish - but I don't like the mixture of flavors it provides.

I didn't like it. Too sour. I would put less lemon juice in it, but maybe it depends on the brand.

I absolutely loved this when I made it.  I didn't use carrots and I think I used more cucumber.  It's so delicious, really light, and somehow refreshing.  I think it's the cukes and lemon juice.  I think I could eat bowls of this stuff on it's own!  It is definately a 'season to taste' type dish.

My husband and I liked this recipe, with a few modifications.  I added some vinegar, didn't use the carrots, and used a little less oil and a little more quinoa. I did find it to be a little bland...may take some other reviewers' suggestions to spice it up a bit next time, but otherwise, it was a nice, light dish.

Despite being a huge fan of Tabouli, I found the initial recipe quite bland.  I added about 2 tsp of cumin & 1/2 tsp of cayenne to add some flavor.  It tasted quite a bit better after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Next time, I'll add jalapenos, cilantro, and garlic to add more flavor.

I made this recipe and not being particularly fond of parsley, used cilantro instead.  I found that mine needed a bit more bite than the lemon provided and since I didn't have any more lemons, I added a dash of red wine vinegar.  To punch up the protein content, I added a can of black beans to the mix.  Excellent!

Very tasty, perhaps a little too much parsley. I made the mistake of making this in January: this is a summer dish -- eat in warm weather to really appreciate its fresh flavors.

Very filling and delicious!  We ate the entire bowl, and were too full for the main course.  I added a little more lemon, just because there was some extra juice, and left out the carrot, just because I'm lazy.

An excellent wheat-free tabbouleh!  The only changes I made were:  No carrots (my fiance doesn't like them), only one bunch of green onions, and about 3 T. lemon juice (instead of 1/4 cup).  I also added some chopped fresh mint and cracked black pepper.   This is delicious!!!

I used the chicken stock, cilantro, and added some red pepper.  Pretty good.  Although I still thought it was a little bland.  But my husband thought it was the best quinoa dish he's ever had.

ETA:  I made this with the parsley & it was even better!

My first experience with quinoa, and it was a great one.  Made a few changes to add flavor.  Cooked the quinoa in chicken broth, adding cumin and dried parsley.  Used smaller amounts of the vegetables listed and added chunks of zucchini.  Also chopped up about 5 figs and thought it added another very interesting layer of flavor.  Gave this 4 stars instead of 5 'cos the recipe might have been a little bland for me without the changes.

GREAT recipe! Thank you very much for sharing. I'd recently become interested in trying quinoa, and this was a great way to serve it. I've never had tabbouleh, either, so this was all a fantastic experiment. I read someone's comments about using cilantro instead of traditional parsley... I may try that next time, but in any case, this was perfect as is!

Very nutritious and tasty, but still a little on the bland side for my tastes. I had no fresh parsley to add, so this may have made a huge difference in the overall taste. I added a bit of feta fresh ground pepper and dried parsley which livened it up a bit.

Even my 18 month old loves this, which is great because it's chalk full of protein for him.  I've made this a few times and I added a little more lemon juice for more of a kick and recently tried feta which was great.  I'd love to add roasted pinenuts too.  I cut down a bit on the green onion and used cilantro like some of the other reviewers recommended.

This is a very healthy yet very filling dish. I used red quinoa and added a little extra tomato and also cilantro and let it sit overnight. I will definatly be making this one again.

This is a good recipe; I like it better than the traditional bulgar tabbouleh. It is lighter and tastier, I think. With this recipe, I would suggest decreasing the amount of lemon juice, adding salt & pepper, and adding small cubes of firm tofu. I enjoyed this very much -- thanks.
