This is so amazingly good. My husband said it was the best thing I ever made, and he is a tough critic.  I think he thinks I made the crust from scratch but I used the pillsbury ready made crust in the long red box, it was so good.   I also used both of the cans of soup and half of the thyme and did not put the cookie sheet under it when baking per another reviewer and the crust was perfect.   Even my ten year old said how much he loved it, and had leftovers later that night for a snack and I don't think he has ever done that willlingly!  I have been coming on this sight for two years and I have tried many recipes, some good, some not so good and some really good that made it into my recipe box but this is the first one that prompted me to write a review!  Three of us ate the whole thing in one night.  I have been on a quest to find good recipes that stand the test of time to hand down to my kids and this will make the cut for sure! Thanks so much for posting it!!

Thank you for a GREAT starter recipe!  Like others have said, my Hubby doesn't like pot pies, but he liked this one!  I did tweak it ... two full cans - one mushroom and one potato (I HATE celery!) - garlic powder, and I didn't blanch the veggies.  Oh, and in the spirit of being someone too lazy to blanch veggies, I also used canned chicken - one 13 oz from a warehouse store.  (Told Hubby it was boiled, and then he thought it was really good!  LOL)  I would suggest you let it sit when you take it out of the oven for at least 5 minutes before cutting ... it will solidify a bit that way.  Really yummy!  Sent it off to a friend in the hospital and they asked for the recipe.  UPDATED:  Thought I would point out an easy way to cover the edges of the pie ... have a square of foil that is big enough to cover the pie, fold it in half, and cut a half circle out ... this will leave just the sides covered.

Thank you for sharing....as most good cooks who have a tendency to add/subtract from recipes, I did too.  But the basics were right here in the original recipe.  I used Marie Collanders Deep dish pie shell (frozen)for the bottom crust and Ritz regular crust for the top crust.  Put an egg wash on the bottom crust before adding the chicken mixture. To recipe I added mushrooms (small can), garlic powder, onion powder, a little Lawry's Seasoned Salt, black pepper.  Covered with top crust and brushed on egg wash.  What a wonderful pie this makes.  Baked 350 degrees for 55 minutes.  Beautiful golden brown, top and bottom.  The basic recipe is so good that you can add whatever your heart desires to it or leave it as it is.  Either way would be DELICIOUS!  This is a keeper, so I threw out all my old recipes.  LOL. Something was not done properly if it didn't turn out as above.  The filling was great....not soggy or runny.  Everything held in place.  I let stand 10 minutes after I removed it from the oven for the filling to settle down before cutting.  This is a no-brainer recipe.

This recipe was very easy and very tasty. I used a Pillsbury crust. My only problem was that by placing the pie dish on a cookie sheet, the bottom layer of the crust didn't cook properly and was gooey. Next time I will not put it on cookie sheet.

I did make a lot of minor changes to this, but used it as a basic idea, especially for the length of cooking time.
I used fresh carrots and potatoes cut up into small pieces, 1/2 a can each of green beans, corn, and peas.  Also I used the "veggie pot pie crust" on this site which was amazing and added great flavor to the pot pie.  I also used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup instead since that is what I had, but this was AWESOME!! Will be making almost weekly, keeps well and is great reheated for lunches.  Thanks so much! :)

My 9-year old said to give this recipe "six stars!!"  The only changes I made was to add one can of diced new potatoes, use both cans of soups, reduce the thyme, and add a little garlic salt.  I actually doubled the recipe and froze the second pie for another meal.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe!!

This was very good--it didn't knock our wool socks off on this chilly November day, but it was a quick and hearty meal after a long hike. Honestly, I was skeptical about this recipe, but it looked so easy to prepare that it begged my attention. (I used to make the Barefoot Contessa's recipe and it took over an hour to prepare!) I prefer boneless chicken thighs in pot pies--the higher fat content retains moisture and flavor.  I poached them in chicken broth for some additional flavor, a trick I learned from Eating Well. Other times, I've used leftover roast chicken. Instead of cream of celery, I prefer cream of chicken soup. I use a full can with the full can of cream of potato. At first I thought the thyme was a bit overwhelming but when I reduced the amount, I realized I liked it better with the original recipe's full teaspoon. This is even better reheated the next day! Truly great comfort food.

I have made this for several years. I use cream of chicken in place of the cream of potato. I also add a little (light) sour cream, mayo & shredded cheese to the mixture. I also add a little garlic & onion powder to mine. A real hit in our house, especially in the winter time!!!

This is a wonderful and tasty recipe and so easy but I did change a few steps which appealed to my tastes . Rather than boiling the chicken, try roasting chicken breasts on the bone in the oven. I coated with bit of olive oil and salt, pepper, garlic powder and sprinkled a bit of thyme on them. Forty five minutes at 350 degrees and they are juicy and so much more flavorful than just boiling them. I also used cream of chicken and cream of broccoli soups. Frozen veggies are fine but to give the pie a more home made appeal, I did par boil very tiny new potatoes which I cut in half and added to the mix. I will be making this a lot in the future as it was well received by my family. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good! After reading lots of reviews, I realized that most people said 3 things: 1) 1 tsp. of thyme is too much, 2) The recipe is a little bland as written, 3) Substituting cream of chicken for cream of celery makes the pot pie a little creamier. 

I boiled the boneless skinless chicken breasts (3 of them, because my husband is a meat eater) with Mrs. Dash original, onion powder, and garlic powder. Next time I will use chicken bouillon also. I also used 1 can of cream of potato and about 3/4 can of cream of chicken (to make up for the additional meat). 

As far as the spices, I reduced the thyme to 1/2 tsp. and still thought it was too much. Next time I might omit it completely... I'm not really fond of the taste. I also added 1/2 tsp. of Mrs. Dash and a pinch of garlic powder and onion powder to the mix. Finally, I baked on 350 for about 55 minutes, keeping the edges covered the entire time. The crust came out perfectly brown. I plan on making this one again.

If you don't like the way a recipe is done that's OK. But if you haven't even tried it, don't tear it down. It was simple, fast and has good flavor and texture 

Wrenna's recipe sounds great, but also looks to be 2 to 3 times the prep time, something a lot of folks just don't have. 

Worried about wholesome? pick low fat/ reduced salt soups, and Frozen Veggies are definitely better than canned.

yummy- easy to make.  I added my own fresh veggies as I did not have any frozen and all of both cans of soup in this.  I also used a refrigerated crust, so I baked the bottom one for a little bit first before filling it and adding the top layer to cook.. This way the bottom was cooked and not soggy!

awesome starter recipe! I modified slightly for our tastes. I used a roasted chicken breast from costco, added 4-5 sliced baby bellas, 2 cups still frozen mixed veggies and two full cans of low sodium condensed mushroom soup. mixed everything with onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, parsley, and basil. Added some parmesean cheese and put it in a 9 inch casserole dish (deeper than a pie pan, to accomodate the extra veggies!), covered it in the remaining pie crust (I used pillsbury and rolled out slightly larger), and baked for 55 minutes. so so good! next time will try fresh spinach in there for added vitamins :)

My husband took a bite and asked what the overwhelming spice was.  The recipe had called for 1 tsp Thyme. I used only 1/2 tsp, and it was still too much. This recipe is a good comfort food that I will make again, this time with only 1/4 tsp of Thyme.

Mine's in the oven right now. I live in Dallas and we just experienced an arctic blast like you wouldn't believe so I was very excited to try this recipe tonight. I used a whole can of cream of chix and cream of celery and subbed three medium sized potatoes, a small bag of carrots sliced 1/2", and about 4 sticks of celery sliced the same way for the frozen, blanched veggies. Boiled those in the broth left over from boiling the chicken until al dente. Mixed the chicken, veggies, and soup together and threw some salt n' pepper, sage, and basil to the mix in addition to the thyme. Smells good. Looking forward to eating it with some warm biscuits!!

I love this recipe, have been making it for a few years now.  This is my go to recipe for leftovers of chicken and mashed potatoes.  I add my mashed potatoes to the vegetables with a jar of chicken gravy instead of the canned soups, Yummy!

I made this recipe the first time as written, and in my opinion it needs  tweaking.  I started by slicing and sauteing an 8 oz container of fresh baby bellas with half a red onion and a couple of cloves of garlic.  I added that to 2 cups of veggies (I used canned corn and beans) and 2 cups of cubed cooked chicken.  I also used 2 full cans of the soup (cr/mush and cr/chix) and really cut down on the thyme.  I'm glad I did because I thought the full amount was overpowering for me the first time.  I really like the flavor and texture of the sauteed mushrooms/onions/garlic in this.  It gives it a more full texture and more of the flavor I was looking for in a pot pie.

A very good basic recipe. For those cooks that used a frozen pie crust, it is a good idea to bake the bottom crust until lightly brown before u add your filling. This takes care of the soggy crust problem. Bon Appetite!

I've made this recipe many times over the past seven years and its a family favorite!  Some tips, I use frozen peas and carrots but canned corn since the canned corn adds a nice sweetness to the dish.  Also, I use 98% FF Cream of Celery and 98% FF Cream of Chicken soups to reduce the fat in the soup.  I'll frequently use Italian seasoned leftover chicken and just omit using any additional seasoning when mixing the ingredients together.  For a fun treat, I take off the extra pie crust from the edges of the pan to make a smiley face - always a winner! Enjoy!

I don't eat meat but my husband and kids LOVED this! I used Pillsbury ready made pie crusts & lots more chicken then the recipe called for but the rest of the directions I followed to a T. Fabulous (So they all claimed). I will definitely make this again! SOOOO easy to make too!

This was really good. I made this last minute with what I had on hand - it was made after I came home from an out of town trip to a hungry husband and no groceries in the house. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup in place of the celery and potato since that is all i had in the cupboard. I also used canned chicken and fresh carrots and broccoli - which I steamed before adding to the mixture. I added garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne for an extra kick. Was really yummy... will make again for sure!

Made this yesterday and with the exception of a mistake on my part, it went over well with my family. I usd ground thyme and used less than a half teaspoon, but the flavor overwhelmed the dish. I also used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery due to personal tastes. I will make it again and will probably eliminate the thyme all together and utilize garlic powder, onion powder and pepper for seasonings. The basic recipe is easy and very good. Thanks!

I think people need to lighten up a little. Chicken pot pie isn't exactly the healthiest recipe whether you're using canned soup or making the sauce from scratch. I think this is a great basic recipe. I used a full can of cream of chicken and cream of celery. I used fresh veggies instead of frozen (celery, carrots, onions). I also halved the thyme, because I only like it in small amounts, and I added a little black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. Also with the chicken I didn't boil it all the way. I left the breasts a little pink in the center so they could cook through in the oven and not dry out. Overall delicious and easy dish!!

I have been trying to perfect the chicken pot pie and this is the best recipe I have found. So many pies have turned out sloppy, so I used a generous 1/3 c. flour- not necessary. The proportions as listed seem perfect. No leftovers!

One of our family favorites. Good to take to potlucks. Good to freeze and have available to take to friends who need comfort food. I make with Cream of Potato and Cream of Chicken soups. I stir fry the chicken in chicken broth and poultry seasoning which gives it more flavor. To make it even quicker I have grabbed a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store!

I follow this recipe as an outline.  I like to throw a bit of everything in it. It's great for leftovers after a big chicken dinner.  I will mix mashed potatos, green bean caserole, cream of mushroom soup, left over chicken, and even a little cheese. Sometimes I will freeze it and save for a rainy day.  Everyone loves it.

I have made this recipe numerous times. Extremely easy. I use the 98% fat free cream of chicken and 98% fat free cream of celery. Organic corn, carrots, peas and lima beans. Three organic boneless skinless chicken breast boiled in vegatable broth. I add one cup of shredded mozzarella, a pinch of sea salt, fresh groud pepper, garlic power, thyme followed by a dash of brown sugar and cinnamon. I cook at 350 degrees for one hour without the cookie sheet. Delicious.

I have never baked a chicken before, let alone made a pot pie but following the recipe my pot pie came out AMAZING and is one of the best I have ever had, if I do say so myself. I made it for my bf for dinner and he absolutely loved it. Changes I made: I used canned, not frozen veggies, a whole cream of potato soup can and I switched the celery with cream of mushroom.

I have made chicken pot pie many different ways and this is by far my (and my family's) favorite.
I omit the Thyme and added a little celery seed and salt and pepper to taste as my family are not big fans of thyme.Perfect chicken pot pie. Thanks for the recipe Leslie.

So good!  This is a really simple recipe for a classic, comforting dish.  Only change I made was to use 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of potato.  I like the extra creamyness.

This is an amazing recipe, especially if you are short on time! Thank you also to everyone who added additional tips in their reviews. I am not known for being a very good cook, so when my husband tasted this pie he did not believe that I made it. The tips that I used to tweak the original recipe were: use full can of cream potato & full can of cream of chicken, add 1/4 cup milk, salt/pepper/garlic powder/onion powder to taste. egg wash top of pie & bake for 55 minutes at 350 directly on rack (take foil off edges after 30 min of banking). THANK YOU!!!

I decided to try this recipe for my high school speech team potluck after eating an amazing version of chicken pot pie at Mel's Drive In, and i am happy to say that most of this dish disappeared quickly (although it may have been part of the fact that it was the only hot dish there. What can i say - high school students+potluck = not Iron Chef). I used one can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, can of corn and cut up green beans, and that red box of pie crust. It was pretty good and easy, looked like it took a long time and pretty delicious. I would not make this again for my family, but if there was another potluck, sure, because its fairly cheap and looks like it took a lot more effort than it really did :] If i would make this again I would add more salt to the chicken mix.

I have made this 2 times now.  The first was made exactly according to the recipe.  Then the second one had some changes.  I did as others have suggested...I used 2 cans of soup, one cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom.  I also added about 1/2 cup or so of mushrooms.  I do not like thyme, so I used Ms. Dash instead, with 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning and some pepper.  I added about 1/3 cup of milk also.  My Husband the first one was way too thick and wasn't like anything he had ever had as far as the consistency went.  He said chicken pot pie is suppose to have a creamy inside to it and the first one I made did not.  The second time I made it with the changes in the recipe and he LOVED it.  He said it was smooth and creamy.  He compared it to his Grand Mothers and that was good enough for me.

Excellent recipe.  My family loved it.  Added some garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt and pepper as one of the reviews suggested.  Also, did not bake on a sheet as suggested.  Turned out great with these suggestions.  Will definitely make this again.

I tweaked the recipe a bit.  Used 2 full cans of soup, added mushrooms, added chopped uncooked potato, and i added the mixed veggies still frozen. I used leftover store bought rotisserie chicken.  turned out very good. The Husband wasn't too sure about it to begin with but he had a second helping and said i should make it again. :)

Super good.  Made some changes to suit my taste preferences.  Such as chicken soup and no thyme.  I also add canned potatoes because I like my chicken pot pie with potatoes.  I cut the mixed vegetables down to about 1.5 cups.

I thought this was delicious and super easy!  Even the left overs the  next day were good.  My bf thought it was a bit dry, but that may have been my fault from boiling the chicken a bit too long.  I may add a bit of milk next time (as some recipes call for) to help make the pie a little more moist.  Overall, I am a fan and will, without a doubt, make it again!

It was good. I wish there had been a little more information in the ingredients section as well at the directions.

I didn't use a cookie sheet or tin foil. I used fresh veggies, boiled. I also baked it at 425 degrees for 35 minutes. I found another pot pie recipe on here that seemed similar and those were their baking instructions so I figured it would be fine. No need to wait 60 minutes.

If I make this again, I would reduced the amount of cream of celery (adding more cream of potato) and maybe the thyme. It was just a bit strong.

Unfortunately, I used pie crust instead of puff pastry.  The texture, taste, etc., would have been greatly improved.

So yummy and I don't usually like pot pie!! I made this recipe because I had all ingredients on hand and was trying to use things up. I actually used a full can of the cream of celery and the mixed veggies had carrots/green beans/peas/Lima beans. I used Safeway pie crust and rolled it onto the pie dish. My 8yr old son loved this so much and had 2 large helpings and said it was the best dinner ever!

KUDOS for Ms Leslie Brown, author of this incredible, easy family recipe.  The BEST part, you can modify to your individual taste & desires.  Bricks & stones to the writers of negative reviews.  If you prefer "X" so be it, don't take it out on the recipe or the author.  I prefer to use chicken thighs w/skin that I pan fry for color, dilute 1 chicken bullion w/cup of water, pour in pan and oven roast 12 minutes, cooled, cut and used in the great recipe.  Followed instructions.

I liked it but too much "store bought" ingredients. Definitely not like Grandmoms, which is just as easy to make.

I made this for my boyfriend, while i did not actually get to try it I am giving it a good rating because it is SO easy.  I made it, then froze it without cooking and just left him directions.  He thought it was delicious and i liked that he had some 'real' food that was easy for him to just toss in the oven.  I added more veggies and less soup (1/4 can cream of celery and 1/4 can cream of mushroom) and also added fresh mushrooms.

OMG! One of my favorite recipes of all time. It is a warm, creamy and filling dish perfect for a fall evening. I use California veggies, beans and corn in mine, and add garlic powder. My mother raved about this dish and has repeatedly begged me to make it again!

This was FABULOUS and easy to make. My sister, husband and I loved it. We can't wait to make it again. I didn't have the celery soup, so I used brocolli cheese soup instead. YUM! Thank you for sharing.

This was very easy to make.  I'm all about quick,  easy and meals.  The only changes I made was I bought the pillsbury ready made crust and the roll out pillsbury dough for the top. I also used canned mixed vegetables instead of frozen ones. In place of the cream of celery soup, I used cream of chicken with herb seasoning. I had an awfully hard time wrapping the crust with foil. Hope it turns out great!

Made this for dinner last night and my son and his fiance raved about it.This is the first time that I've made a pot pie and this recipe was very easy to make. I also used the Pillsbury pie crust and the crust was very flaky and done to perfection.Took the advice from others and did not use a cookie sheet and using all the soup.A+++++

I try new recipes just about every time I cook but this one is by far the favorite amongst my family members and I end up making it fairly frequently.  I don't change anything about the recipe at all...great as is.

This was absolutely fantastic!!! We used leftover chicken from the grill and it turned out great. The only thing that i will do different next time is to use half the amount of thyme. Thank you for the great recipe Leslie.

I love chicken pot pie and always have.  I substituted 1/2 can of cream of chicken for the cream of celery and added salt and pepper to taste to filling.  The end product was wonderful!!

I thought this was  very easy, very quick to put together and very good meal.  I used store bought pie crust and baked the bottom crust for 5 min so it would not be soggy.  I also used a can of mixed vegetables instead of frozen (cheaper).  I boiled my chicken, but if I were in a rush I would use a chicken that was cooked in the deli at the supermarket! It smells wonderful while baking and it looks beautiful when finished.  My family enjoyed it and I will make it again.  I have 3 adult daughters that I am going to forward this recipe to, their families will enjoy it also!

I needed a starter recipe & this was great for that. I made some changes so that I could call it my own- Started with only a pinch of thyme. I used 1 whole can of cream of chicken & 1 whole can of cream of potato. Also added diced potatoes, used both canned & fresh. I added a bit of season salt or poultry season to the chicken. I have used both canned & frozen vegetables, both work great. I brushed the top with egg whites, which made it perfectly flaky! I did not place the pie on a cookie sheet & turned out perfect. My family loves it! Thanks for a great start!

This was easy and delicious! I had cream of chicken soup and used that instead of cream of celery soup and now that's how I'll make it every time. I was concerned about using cream of potato soup but this is really good. Right now I'm trying to keep from eating the whole thing!

This recipe relies too heavily on canned and frozen products, and will taste that way.  Yes, its quick and easy, but so are the many frozen pies that are available and equally as tastey.

Amazing and pretty easy! I use one small package of the steamed vegetables instead of having a bunch of left over vegetables. But I've found that this recipe makes about 1 and a 1/2 pies, so I save the leftover and make another batch a few days later and freeze those. I don't like to see it go to waste :) I also omit the thyme and add garlic powder. Also don't boil the chicken, I just buy rotisserie (saves me some work!)

I make this all the time with a few changes.  I use cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery.  I also sautee my chicken with garlic and onions instead of boiling it.  My husband and my teenaged son can't get enough of this.  There are never any leftovers.

I made this a few nights ago at my house and it was a hit. I made a couple adjustments though. I sauteed a diced onion and some mushrooms in a little bit of butter, and instead of the cream of celery and cream of potato soups, I just used a whole can of cream of mushrooms. My family loved it. However, I will go a little easier on the thyme next time because it was a little overwhelming. Next time I will use a pinch of sage too.

This was tasty.  I used cream of chicken & celery, added pepper, garlic pwdr. to taste.  Baked in glass pie dish(no pan under) at 350 for 40 min. then 400 for 15 min. to help brown bottom & top crust.

This is the one I'll go to because it is quick, easy and tasty. My husband  and kids love it. I don't boil the chicken because I think seasoning it with salt and pepper then cooking in a pan with olive oil and a little butter makes the chicken have good flavor, not bland.  This I do ahead of time so I can mix all the other ingredience together when I'm ready to bake it. I also add garlic and onion powder, a little salt and fresh gound pepper. I go for one can of mixed veg so no need to banch. Takes 5 minutes to mix and get it into the oven.  Also, I only cook it for 50 minutes at 350. I don't egg wash the crust and it comes out great. My husband says don't change a thing. This is right on.

To save time, I use a large can of Veg-All Homestyle (drained). The veggies are big and chunky and taste great! (It's  different from regular Veg-All; for instance, no lima beans. There are potatoes, carrots, celery, pearl onions and I think peas.)

Yummers!!!! I used this recipe with a refigerated crust from the store and it was wonderful. Even my hubby, who is not crazy for "casserole" type dishes, liked this. He begged me to make it again. So much better than anything frozen!! Thanks, Leslie!!!

Wow!! I love pot pie and this was amazing. I used 1 can cream of potato and 1/2 can of cream of chicken, next time I will put in the whole can.  I cooked at 375 instead of 400 to accomodate other dishes in progress and it was perfect. I will make this again and again!!

Great recipe.  Used cream of chicken and potato (don't like celery) and used thighs instead of breast (not a breast fan).  It was fabulous.  The mixture of the ingredients to liquid is great.  I did mix my veggies in with the soups on the stove before adding to shell as others and it worked and tasted great.

Followed this basic recipe to make chicken pot pie for dinner.  I only made a few changes and this came out super good.  I used two chicken breasts and two thighs that I've been trying to use up.  I used two cans of cream of chicken since that's all I had.  I also don't have thyme so instead, I mixed in a tsp. of garlic, 1 tbsp. of parsley, a dash of rosemary, and 1/2 tsp. of oregano.  I used two bags (12oz. each) of mixed frozen veggies.  I cooked this as directed and it came out really flavorful.  Definitely will make again.

Another winner. This was an easy, no mess, no fuss excellent meal. We had one for dinner and I froze a second pie.  I always follow recipes as presented for the first time. I used a frozen pie crust and the only thing I will change next time will be to thicken the sauce. It was a bit runny. The flavor was very good.

I love chicken pot pie but have not made it for years because it is so high in calories.  This recipe was wonderful and got 2 thumbs up from everyone in the family.  Including the picky eater 9 year old.  The only thing I changed as suggested was to use cream of potato soup.  I just though that would help my family like it better.  I was happy to see that this could be frozen.  I made an extra pie for another day.

Wonderful! Comfort food at it's best!!
After reading other reviews..I left out the thyme, but added a couple of shakes of poultry seasoning. I used cream of potato and cream of chicken (what I had on hand) and added fresh mushrooms (12 oz) to the veggies as they were being blanched. OH MY..this is just wonderful on these cold fall evenings. One other thing another viewer mentioned was egg wash. I put it on the bottom crust and the last 15 minutes, I added some to the top crust. Wishing I would have taken a photo. Many thanks Leslie...

This was amazing and very easy to make! My husband loved it and he is a very picky eater. I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of celery since I had it on hand, then added some celery salt for flavoring. I posted a photo on Facebook after I took it out of the oven, and now everyone wants me to make it for them. I will definitely be making this again. Might have to have a chicken pot pie party!

Good starter recipe- I added a can of diced new potatoes and substituted one full can cream of mushroom instead of the half of cream of celery.  I also added a small can of mushrooms along with the bag of frozen veggies.  Turned out yummy!

So easy! I didn't have pie crust like I thought I did, so I improvised.  I used a baking mix and made biscuits and put them on top of the soup/chicken mixture.  I also added cream of chicken soup and omitted the thyme (couldn't find that either!)  It had rave reviews! Will definitely make again!

Have been making this recipe for years. Used one family sized can of Cream of Chicken condensed soup, and one small can of Cream of Celery to cook the chicken in first (with some dried minced onion, salt, and garlic powder). I also added one small box of chicken stuffing (cooked first) into the blend of cooked frozen veggies, chicken, and creamed soups.

Excellent quick and easy recipe. Used two cans of soup (mushroom is all I had on hand), one can of carrot/peas mix well drained and chicken leftovers from the Busy Day Chicken  recipe also from this site, and everyone gobbled it up. Thank you for a great recipe!

Pie was okay, but the recipe called for WAY too much Thyme.  ... I'll try it again with a lot less next time.  (I made this recipe exactly according to directions.  No modifications.)

Great recipe foundation! Added some things to enhance flavor: 1. Used whole can each of cream of celery and crem of mushroom. 2. Added sauted onion & gralic, black pepper, thyme, rosemary, poltry season, salt and fresh diced potatoes. 3. milk to loosen filling (you will have left over filling) 4. Baked @ 350 for 1hr. (the last 20mins move pie to lowest rack to ensure a cooked bottom crust.  Friends and family loved it

This was very simple to make and was good to eat.  I would add some salt & pepper next time and maybe some pearl onions.  it just needs a little more flavor, maybe a little more sauce.  Add milk?

Love this recipe! Here is what I do: use the pillsbury crusts in the long red box in your grocery store fridge section (with the biscuits), I use the whole can of cream of celery and the whole can of cream of potato. Everything else I do the same. I just made this for the FIFTH time! This time I was lazy and used canned chicken and it was awesome!

DH says it's the best potpie he's ever had.  Used cubed leftover Costco roasted chicken, Cream of celery + cream of chicken condensed soups, a splash of white wine.  Instead of frozen veggies, I sauteed minced garlic, onions, chopped celery, chopped carrots and peas. I would've liked more thyme, but DH says this is just perfect.

It was quite good I made it exactly as stated here except I cooked the pie empty pie shell first to avoid the bottom being improperly cooked. My boyfriend ate many vegetables he wasn't fond of in this recipe and enjoyed it.

Fantastic just the way it is, but if you use canned veg and chicken, (I use the Veg-all home-style, big can) you can have the ingredients on hand for up to six weeks, prep time takes ten minutes and there's only one bowl to wash for clean up. Simple enough for my twelve year old to make (and clean up after) and bonus of LOTS of campbell's soup labels (if you use Swanson's Chicken breast and Campbell's soup) to clip for school.

You will love this for substitution.  Had a pound of steamed shrimp in the fridge (go figure).  Cream of mushroom and cream of brochli, can of VegAll.  Only used half the cream of broch as it was pungent. Added tarragon, garlic. Oh yea no pie crusts.  Had a pkg of cresent rolls.  Rolled those out sticking them together. Actually covered the bottom and top.  It was great.

Super easy and tastes just like the premaid frozen ones!!!!  Just better!!!! Two cans of soup really fill up the pie crust (if you use ready-made frozen crusts) - so be sure to get deep dish frozen crusts if you are wanting to have room for the filling. Definitely a 'keeper' recipe for ease of use as well as taste!  I can make this so quick - and with three young kids - that is saying a lot!!!!

AMAZING ! Let me first say this was my first time making a pot pie & i could not choose a pot pie recipe from here to follow, so i decided to use this as my base recipe.I did make changes, first i boiled 2 boneless skinless chicken breast in a shallow pan and i seasoned the water  with salt,pepper,garlic powder & a dash of cyanne pepper.I boiled for about 10-15 minutes until they were half cooked.Then i cut them into pieces.I peeled one potato chopped it and boiled the pieces for three minutes.I salted the water and also added pepper,garlic powder and a dash of cyanne.I added 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables into the boiling potato pieces and i cooked them for 3 minutes.I used 1 1/2 cans of cream of chicken soup,1/2 can of cream of potato soup and 1/2 of a can of cream of celery soup, I added in some salt,pepper,garlic powder and a dash of cyanne pepper.Then i added the veggies and the chicken and stirred it all up.I used Pillsbury pie crust & lined the edges with foil to prevent burning and put it on a cookie sheet to bake.I cooked it at 400.The cooking time did take a little longer than i expected it took almost an hour to finish,but it was well worth the wait.IT TURNED OUT AMAZING my family loved it and with it feeding a family of 4 it was gone in 5 minutes.This could have made two pot pies but i only had one pie crust so i had to save the other half of pot pie filling until tomorrow when i buy another pie crust & its a good thing it makes so much because my family all wa

I make this recipe often when I have leftover chicken or turkey.  I use cream of chicken and potato soups. The potato soup in my opinion is key to making this taste so good!!!  I do add a bit of garlic salt because I add it to almost everything.  My friends have asked for this recipe, it's a hit with us!!

Easy recipe.  I added some other spices, and reduced amount of thyme as per other reviewers.  Hubby, who is not a pot pie fan, actually ate a nice chunk (seconds too!)

It came out very good with a few changes.  (I'm sure the original recipe is good but I can't help myself)  I only added one can of cream of chicken & mushroom.  I added a little of the broth from the chicken (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 cup.  I boiled chicken in grill seasoning, salt and garlic.  I added only 1/2 tsp of thyme but will add 1/4 tsp next time.  For veggies, I used 2 sm red potatoes, 1/2 an onion, 2 carrots, 2 stalks of celery and about 1 cup frozen green beans cut into 1 inch pieces.  I nuked all the veggies together in a bowl for about 4 minutes before adding to chicken mixture.  I poached chicken by placing in cold water with seasonings and heating to a boil, and then turning off immediately and letting sit a few minutes to cool.  My PICKY family all gave it a thumbs up!  It only gets 4 stars because I think 1 tsp of thyme would be very overpowering.

SOOOOO good! I made this tonight and it's a big hit. I was looking for something with a little "something special" in it, as regular pot pies can be boring. Thyme was just the ticket! I do, however, cut the amount of thyme in half. This will be a regular in our house.

I bought a roasted deli chicken and picked meat from it instead of making my own from raw chicken. Saved some trouble and tasted wonderful. Will make again!

This was great chicken pot pie! I've been looking for a two crust recipe and this one was really good.  I misread the recipe and put in a whole can of celery soup.  I also put in three chicken breasts because I wanted the extra protein and also cut half off the thyme as some reviewers suggested.  It was very, very good and very, very easy to make.  I will definitely treat myself to this again!  Thanks!

Great recipe.  Here are some minor changes we made:  used frozen puff pastry dough for the crust so that we could bake in a rectangular casserole dish; used white wine instead of chicken broth; threw in a bit of broccoli cause we like it as well; added 1 tsp. curry powder to season it a bit.

It came out perfect! I doubled the recipe using 2cream of potato and 2cream of chicken. I used poultry seasoning instead of just thyme. I followed other reviewers and added garlic powder minced onion black pepper. I stirred in chicken broth to thin out the mixture so it could be stirred. It was very thick. I used a 10x14 glass dish, ungreased, laid two rolls of pie crust down making sure it went up the sides. Scooped the mixture in the dish and covered with the last two rolls. I wiped with an egg wash and it came out beautiful and tasted awesome!

Absolutely amazing! I use recipes from here all the time, have never reviewed before. When your picky 8 year old daughter who would love to live in Mac n cheese n hot dogs says you should make this every night, you just have to say something! And like others, I used this as a base recipe. I boiled the 2 chicken breasts with 2 bouillon cubes; I set out the frozen veggies while doing so; I mixed 1 can Cream of Chicken with Herbs and 1 can Broccoli and Cheese, as well as approximately 1/4 cup of milk with the called for veggies. I added garlic/pepper to taste. Did not do the cookie sheet thing, but did everything else as far as cooking. Did let sit for about 15-20 mins; came out perfect and still hot! Just absolutely amazing!!

Easy and a hit with the family. Next time I will cut back on the thyme though. Just a personal preference. I added a whole can of celery soup only because I didn't read close enough. It was great!

This was excellent and will make again.  The only change I would make is to use 2 full cans of soup.  Mine turned out a little dry but it was still delicious.  I also added sauteed onion and a little minced garlic.  Great basic recipe!

Made this last night for the husband and it was a hit! It's a super easy recipe to follow. I did make a few changes, I used 1 can f cream of potato and 1 can of cream of chicken because thats what I had at home. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone!

My picky husband had two servings. Thank you, Leslie! Store had no potato soup, so I bought small bag of instant potatoes, made it up and added milk to a cupful to soup consistency.(and had leftover potatoes for another meal)Always do my chicken in microwave with little olive oil,seasonings, covered for about 5 minutes(only had one chicken breast on hand) Fresh thyme from garden, so used more. Followed the rest of the recipe. Will definitely make again! So easy!

Family just loved this. Son finished off the last 2 pieces last night. After reading all of the reviews I thawed the veggies and let Pillsbury pie crusts come to room temperature first. I also preheated cookie sheet and used a glass pie plate.  I think I'll use just potato soup along with 1/2 cup of milk next time as was a little too salty with celery soup. But other than that it was perfect!

I added salt and pepper, diced a potato and green pepper from our garden. Next time I will be sure to add carrots from our garden. I did brush the bottom crust with an egg, and the last ten minutes of baking time I brused the top crust with egg wash too. It gave it a golden brown top. I used cream of mushroom soup and added a bunch of fresh sliced mushrooms. Very good.

The entire family LOVED it!  I used crm. of chicken and crm. of potato soup.  Cooked the chicken in chicken broth (as another reviewer suggested), and added some pepper and season salt.  My step daughter (well almost a step daughter) gave the dinner a "10"...and she is very hard to please!

A little blah. Would have made two if I'd realized it had that much filling before I was done making it. But my wheels are turning as to what I can do to tweak it to make it pop. It wasn't bad. Just needed something. Not sure what yet.

I made this for me and my son, it was all gone.  It was so good.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of celery and on 1/4 teaspoon on thyme, perfect, even my 2 yr old grand daughter loved it and she is very picky.  I will make this again and again!!!

Frozen vegetables do not make a very tasty dish.The lack of onion or garlic and spices are also missing. I prefer fresh veggies and fresh potatoes. Maybe a splash of Worcestershire. This was a tasteless rendition of pot pie. There are plenty of variations on this site with far more taste.

mmmm! This was yummy and easy. It was a little blan but with some "doctoring" up I think I can make it perfect!   I boiled the chicken and mixed the ingredients the night before. Then after work I just had to put the Pillsbury pie crust in the pan and I was all set. Overall, I thought this was an excellent. Next time I will add some seasoning to the chicken because it was a little blan.

This is by far the very BEST recipe that I've ever seen! Living alone, I can make this and it'll last me at least five days! When my kids come up, they always want Dad's Chix Pot Pie. My sister-in-law refuses to come up, her hubby, my big brother, says I cook better'n she does! LOL I love this recipe. This has become almost a tradition, now!

Very simple, very tasty recipe that's easy to customize. I used two whole cans of soup, swapped out leftover turkey from Thanksgiving in place of the chicken, added onion, garlic, and some spices, and it was delicious. Serious comfort food!

Great recipe! I too sauted the veggies (steamed the carrots and potatoes) then added the soups. Next time I'll add 1/2 cup of stock, make it a bit more saucy.

I am giving this 5 stars. I made it last night and it came out amazing, but I hardly stuck with the same recipe. First of all, I made a roux using butter and flour, then I added in diced and minced onions, celery and carrots and sauteed them until they were soft (not brown) this smells amazing!! Next time, I will add fresh garlic and sautee that as well. Then I used cream of chicken and cream of potato (half can), next time I will use Turkey gravy instead of the soups. Add in a bunch of spices - salt, pepper, garlic, white pepper, and added all of that to the roux. Then the frozen vegetables, I chose corn and peas.  Then I cut pie crusts in half and scooped up the filling into the pie crust and folded it over and baked it at 400 for 20 minutes and it came out delicious! Definitely a keeper!

Tried this one for something different than the one I usually make and the family loved it. They said I should use this recipe from now on. :)

Pretty good recipe for my first time attempting a chicken pot pie. I used the 2 full cans of soup and added a can of diced potatoes to the mix along with the frozen veggies. I omitted the tyme simply because I didn't have any. I used the Pillsbury refridgerated pie crust too. It was pretty tasty and even my 3 yr old ate it.

This was easy, but all I could taste was the Thyme.  I will never make this again.  The filling wasn't good either.  If you do want something easy, this is a good recipe but cut the Thyme out completely and add another can of cream of potato.  Lots of salt and pepper too!

I made this for myself, husband, and daughter(8), and while they aren't big veggie eaters for the most part there were no complaints!  I loved it myself.  I think I would do canned veggies, because I do not like the frozen as much.  But other than that...it was delish and easy!

Excellent and so easy! I took previous reviewers tips - used cream of chicken & cream of potato, egg washed the bottom crust. I didn't have thyme but added garlic salt, chopped onions and a pinch of chicken bullion. Terrific! I will be making this quite a bit throughout the Fall and Winter seasons.

This was a great place to "jump off from" I also used dark meat as well and Cream of chicken soup in place of cream of potato and we had a few potatoes left so I cooked them up, cubed them and added them in as well.  It was super!

Everyone absolutely loved this.  My husband said it tasted even better the next day.  I made two pies and used 1 1/2 teaspoons thyme and even with this, it had quite a strong flavor of thyme.  Next time, I will add just a tad less.  I also used a rotisserie chicken and deboned it for the meat because that seems easier.

great recipe. I used both full cans of cream of celery and cream of potato instead of just using the 1 1/2 cans. It turned out delicious and I will definately be making it again.

This was fantastic!!  I gave it 4 stars because we REALLY didn't like the thyme, but I am definitely going to make this again and use a different seasoning (maybe a poultry seasoning?).  I used the pre-rolled refrigerated crusts, canned chicken, frozen veggies thawed in the micro, and the full two cans of cream soups.  Couldn't be easier or more perfect for a winter supper.  Love it!

This was delicious.  I made a few adjustments based on the previous reviews-- I used 2 cans of cream of potato and one can of cream of celery, since we like a creamy sauce.  I also baked it directly on the oven rack (as opposed to on a cookie sheet in the over), and the crust came out perfectly.  Every single family member enjoyed it!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I prepared this last night.  I boiled the chicken in chicken broth and added a little poultry seasoning, onion powder,  and garlic salt. I added a bag of frozen par boiled stew vegetables (carrots, potatoes, celery, and onions) and half a can of peas.  Everything went in with the chicken to pick up the flavors. I also used an egg wash on the crust. Next time I'll add about a 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid to the soups before mixing it with everything else, just cuz I like it a bit creamier.  Wonderful Recipe!! I can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

For being so easy and tasting so amazing, this recipe is great. You can fool everyone because I have made homemade pot pies and I wont bother again, this is just as awesome. The bottom pie shell should be brushed with eggwash (1 egg, 1 T water mixed) before adding the mixture or it wont stick as well. Also, the pieshells should be defrosted just a little or you wont be able to crimp them together with water and a fork. Remember to brush the top pieshell with eggwash for nice even browning.

There may be cooking snobs out there who turn their noses up at recipes with cans of soup, but this recipe is great. Sometimes a quick and easy recipe is just what you need. It was easy to prepare. I boiled the chicken for about 10 minutes (actually, be careful to simmer and not boil). I heated up the veggies in the microwave for a few minutes first instead of blanching. It turned out fine. We just had leftovers, and they were just as delicious! I'll be using this for years to come.

This was so easy and my husband loved it! I couldn't find the can of potato soup, so I used cream of cheddar and broccoli. As well I didn't have any thyme so I used oregano...worked out amazing! Be sure to have the baking sheet under the pie plate, as it does tend to over flow a bit! Excellent!!

This recipe is quickly becoming a TG tradition. One of the early reviewers suggested using half turkey gravy, which absolutely changes the taste and makes this a truly memorable pie. My daughter and I now get together and make up lots of pies to freeze from the leftovers. They take about 1-1/2 hrs to cook, but just popping them in the oven on a cold night turns into great comfort food.

We love this recipe. I use a can of cream of potato and cream of celery which does the trick. We've used a variety of different frozen vegetable blends and all have tasted fine. I added potatoes that I had boiled so they were partially cooked and it turned out really well. My kids love this one too.

I made this with one can of cream of celery, one can of cream of mushroom and used poultry seasoning (I didn't measure, sorry) instead of thyme alone.  I had about 12oz of chicken picked off the roast chicken we had the day before.  I used the Pastry for a Double Crust Pie from this site.  My whole family loved it!  So simple and super tasty - this will be in my regular rotation.

I used Cream of Mushroom instead of Potato and added 1 can of well drained mushrooms.  I diced 1 potato and cooked it with the chicken in chicken broth.  My husband loves it! Additional revision: I drop my frozen veggies in the broth for just a few seconds and add shredded cheese to the filling.

Excellent pot pie!  I used what I had in my pantry -- Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken soups.  

The thyme was a little bit strong -- will likely reduce the amount by 1/2 next time.

I will certainly make this again, though.  My husband and son loved it!

This was okay. The flavor was good (I used 1 1/2 t. thyme), but there was no gravy. My family thought there were too many vegetables.  I will not make this again.

This one got a WOW from my husband.  It was fast and easy to put together- and a great use of leftover chicken. I did not have cream of potato soup in the pantry, so I used cream of chicken- and added potato's that I nuked and cubed. Next time I will do the prep the night before or in the morning,and then just dump everything in the pie crust and bake it after work!

Great recipe.  It's become a standard in my house.  If I have it, I substitute some leftover gravy for the cream of celery soup (my husband loves it this way).  I mix up the filling beforehand and refrigerate, then put it together with pillsbury crust an hour before dinner and bake.  It's perfect for company because I can clean up the kitchen and leave it to bake!  I add a bit of garlic and onion powder, and I've experimented with other herbs (sage and rosemary along with the thyme) but the basic recipe cooks up well every time.

AMAZING!  I used 1 cup frozen mixed veggies and 1 celery stalk, a quarter yellow onion, and a boiled potato.  The Thyme flavor is distinct and great!  I ended up using the second half of the cream of celery to spread on top of the filling.  I used the "Best Ever Pie Crust" recipe... Topped it off!

This was fantastic! My husband and I loved it. I also just used 1/2 teaspoon of thyme as mentioned in other reviews. I didn't have frozen veggies on hand so I diced three small potatoes, one carrot, and 1/2 an onion and threw it in. This will become a regular in our house. Thank so much!

Used cream of chicken soup and cream of potato soup and only 1/2 tsp thyme - this was just awesome.  The kids loved it and we had no leftovers!  Thank you.

WOW!  Delicious and EASY!!  I used 2 whole cans of soup (cream of mush. and cream of celery) and it was perfect.  1/2 tsp. of Thyme was plenty too!  Definitly a keeper!

I have made this 2x.  The first time I didn't have cream of potatoe soup, so I used cream of mushroom.  And I used the full cans of both.  And I made it with Turkey.  It was fab!  The next time I followed the directions - better my first way.

This was very good considering it uses frozen veges and pre-made crust! I used cream of chicken soup instead of celery, and used 2 cans, not 1 and 1/2. Good quick weekday recipe.

Just made this for our family and everyone enjoyed it. I was surprised that there were no complaints from either of 3 boys about the vegetables. Used mixed vegs (beans, corn, carrots) and leftover roast chicken. Skipped blanching of veggies and thawed them in fridge all day. Also cut thyme in 1/2. Used cream of chicken instead of cream of celery soup. Great recipe! Thanks!

I love this recipe!  I have made it twice already and my husband and son love it.  I put in both cans of soup instead of 1 1/2 cans, and used 1/2 tsp. thyme instead of 1 tsp.  I used canned vegetables, pre-cooked packaged chicken strips, and prepared pie crusts so it was even faster to make.  Absolutely delicious!

I wanted to try this because I had a frozen pie crust to use and this recipe only required a very few ingredients. It's not going to blow your mind but it's super easy and basic. I didn't use frozen vegetables or precooked chicken so I sautéed them with thyme, garlic, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper. I didn't measure the meat and vegetables and so I ended up using whole two cans of soup. I'd never used Cream up celery or potato soup cans before and I was imagining to taste celery but I didn't taste it at all. I like celery so the next time I'll add some celery seeds. I'll also try it with cream of chicken and mushroom soups next time.

Delicious! Didn't use cookie sheet and only used 1/2 of thyme. Otherwise, made as directed. Wife agreed that it needed more filling, so next time I will add cream of chicken soup.

This is certainly a keeper. I followed the advice of others and used 2 cans of potato soup vs 1 can of potato and half a can of celery. I diced and sauteed the chicken and used 2 cups of canned vsfrozen veggies. This tastes great but even better the second day.

Followed the advice of others and used two whole cans of soup. I put the frozen vegetables in a collander to defrost and drain and dumped a 13oz. can of  "warehouse store" premium chunk chicken on top to drain as well. I also added garlic, and pepper to the recipe.   The pie came out beautifully and was delicious. My husband and I loved it! YUM!

This was pretty good. My boyfriend took it to work for the last two days so that's proof! I do think the thyme needs to be cut down to a half a teaspoon though. I also added seasoned salt, garlic powder, salt, and pepper along with a half a can of corn. I put it directly on the rack and the crust turned out perfect but it took longer than an hour. I also used left over rotisserie chicken. I'll be making this again. Thanks

My first foray into the pot pie - this was very good! I made my own crust (allrecipes 'pot pie crust') and this filled a 11x7 dish perfectly.

I think that the cream of celery flavor (I have never really used it in anything) came through a bit too strongly for me... I did use the Healthy Request version.  I don't think it was the thyme, though I did reduce it a bit.

I'll use this as a template for sure, but I don't care much for the full fat (+MSG) cream of potato that I used.  Considering the amount of prep time and quality of product, this was a solid four stars and a great beginning.  What more could you ask for in a recipe really, other than a full tummy and a great place to start tinkering.  THANKS!

I made this the other night and everybody loved it. I did leave out the thyme for no other reason than I didn't have any on hand and I didn't really miss it. I used 2 10 oz fl cans of cream of potato soup and 1 10 oz fl can of cream of celery soup. I also didn't put a tray under it while it cooked and the crust turned out great. It was really quick and easy to make. It's a great meal if you don't have a lot of time at dinner one night provided you already have some pie crust because that can be time consuming.

We have been making this for the last few years but this is my first time reviewing it. This is my go to recipe for chicken and smoked turkey pot pies. However I use two and a half cans of cream soup,one chicken and one mushroom. Totally bypass the celery and reduce Thyme on this recipe. I also pull out frozen rotisserie chicken (Roast Sticky Chicken from this site) previously made for it. I use ready made crusts and add 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mixture. We also add 1/2 cup of sliced portobello frozen mushrooms. I also add 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/4 cup of diced sautéed onions to the seasoning list. This makes two pot pies, it feeds our family of 6. All my kids eat it, which in and of itself is amazing. Updated: I also use an egg wash on the top crust to make it shine. We will be making this with our homemade cream of mushroom soup.

I like this simple recipe, but made some adjustments. Two cans cream of chicken, one can cream of potato, about a cup of milk. Also, I add garlic, onion powder, a pinch of cayenne and sage. In addition to those changes, I use fresh veggies and blanch them before baking. My family loves it!

Very good! I boiled my chicken breasts in chicken broth to give it more flavor. Thyme is a bit strong, use about half. I used more chicken than they called for. After I boiled the chicken breasts in the broth, I took them out and used the same broth to blanch the frozen veggies. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

When I saw the instruction to boil the chicken,I said no way so I dusted the chicken with flour and fried the chunks of chicken in butter with poultry seasoning. It tasted like fried chicken and made the pie so delicious. Other than adding fried fresh mushrooms I followed the recipe.

This was very good.  I did not boil the chicken but poached it instead with some thyme, sage, and lemon pepper and used some chicken bouillon for flavor in the poaching water.  I used steamfresh frozen veggies but did put them on ice to blanch them afterwards.  I messed up my bottom crust (completely my fault) but it still came out wonderful--I can't wait for the leftovers....and appreciated the few ingredients and how easy it was to make.  I will definitely remake this again!

Yummy. I use cream of chicken and cream of celery because that's that I had on hand. I also added black pepper, minced garlic, and a chopped and sauteed onion to the mix. Yummy.

Very good chicken pie recipe.  I used a full can of both cream of celery and cream of potato soup.  I added poultry seasoning, old bay, and some chicken bouillon powder for flavor.  Only used peas and carrots for vegetable.

I loved this pot pie!  I want to make it every week.  Used the "store brand" frozen pie crusts that come 2 to a pack.  Baked a few frozen chicken breast tenders and cut them up into pieces.  Just added the frozen vegetables, which were cooked a little in water beforehand.  Used about an 1/8 teaspoon dried thyme and just one can of cream of chicken soup.  Put it all in one of the pie crusts and took the other pie crust out of the tin pan and placed it on top.  Was a great "comfort food"!

My family LOVED this recipe! Next time I make it though, I am going to lessen the thyme flavoring. It was a bit overwhelming for my taste.

I made this for my family recently and they all raved about how much fresher it tasted than those store-bought pot pies! I love the fact that the ingredients are simple yet taste very good. I made it with the thyme but didn't think it was necessary so I won't put it in next time.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I made a couple of small changes.  Instead of frozen veggies I used a large can of All Veggies drained, because all of the frozen veggies in the store have a sauce with them.  I used 2 pkgs. of oven roasted chicken that Butterball makes that is very good.  Next time I would leave out the thyme.  I just didn't care for the earthy taste that it  has. The baking time was perfect. I will definately be making this again!   Thanks so much for sharing!

This was really yummy.  I used rotisserie chicken and cream of chicken soup instead of potato.  I would cut the time in 1/2 next time as it was a bit strong.  Will definitely make again.  
Oh, also added "Garlic Garlic" from Tastefully Simple.

Great recipe! A hearty, healthy pot pie. I followed the recipe as is with the following exceptions:
1. I halved the thyme. 2. Added mushrooms. 3. Used a frozen pie crust for the bottom and a refrigerated one for the top. 4. Added a little garlic powder. I'll make this again and again...incredibly easy and good!

delicious, and so simple!! i added 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of potato...my husband so it was as good as Marie Calender's frozen pot pies. Oh, for the crust, i used the Pillsbury premade crust in the red box. The top and bottom crust turned out crisp. Will definitely add this to our dinner rotation.

This recipe was a big hit with my family.  Only a few modifications were made: used two cans of cream of chicken, omitted the thyme and made my own simple crust using flour, shortening, salt and water.  My husband can't get enough of this dish.  This will be a go to recipe for a long time.

THIS IS AMAZINGLY GOOD....WITH THE FOLLOWING CHANGES.
I roasted bone-in chicken with olive oil, herbes de province & S&P. Blanched the veggies in chicken broth. Left out thyme. Used frozen deep dish pie crust for bottom, roll out pie crust for top. Egg wash top crust. Baked without cookie sheet for crispier crust. I have made this many times and its a NO FAIL recipe!!

What a wonderful recipe, real comfort food. I had to make changes, as I didn't have everything on hand. I used one can each of cream of chicken, and cream of mushroom soup. I also used green beans, I had frozen from our garden. I wanted more vegetables, so I also added two diced carrots, and one stalk of celery. I added thyme, and topped with pie crust. With a salad, this was the perfect meal. I'll make this again for sure.

This was a great starter recipe and we really enjoyed it.  We did what others said by not putting on cookie sheet, baked at 350 degrees for approx 55 minutes and it was very good.  However, it was a little dry and next time I think I will try putting in 2 full cans of the soup.

Very easy to make but tastes like you spent a longer time in the kitchen preparing it....my kind of recipe. Did use a store bought pie crust - Pillsbury to be exact, and I used entire can of celery soup. Used Pyrex pie dish and place it directly in oven - did not use cookie sheet or aluminum foil. Brushed top of crust with a little butter before putting in oven. Cooked up yummy.....highly recommend this recipe!

One of the things I have learned is too short cut something with a lot of flavor. I use a roasterier chicken and just cut it up. I make a huge one so the whole chicken gets cut up. It flavors the pot pie nicely.

Sorry but I'm one of the few who didn't care for this. There was too much crust & not enough spices for my liking.  Even though I added pepper, cayenne pepper, & also some parsley, it still was bland. My 11 year old son ate it & my husband said it was good, but I think he was just trying to be nice.  My older son wasn't interested in it at all.  I think I'll stick to chicken & dumplings or chicken & biscuits, but thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe exactly, including blanching the veggies. Used the legs/thighs and a little breast meat from a supermarket rotisserie chicken. Came out awesome! Brought it to my sister-in-laws and there wasn't a crumb left. Seemed like it was a little long to cook and next time I will only cook it for 20 mins after taking off the foil. Used someone's suggestion and folded some foil in half and cut a large half circle in it and then opened it to cover the edges. Will be making this again!

My grandmother's rolling over in her grave, because I made this, but she's gotta understand that her grandbaby's got a 9-to-5 and just doesn't have the energy to chop vegetables, make pie crusts, and butcher a chicken after work. I had a chicken pot pie craving (it's 90 degrees here, so why I'd like to turn the stove on and eat anything heavier than watermelon is beyond me). This really hit the spot, though. It turned out better than some scratch recipes I've made from this site. The flavor of the thyme is very prominent, when the pie comes out of the oven, but after sitting overnight, it's just right. I added both cans of soup, which made for just enough moisture in the pie.  I probably could have added the whole bag of frozen vegetables, too, because this doesn't make for a heaping pie filling. I shredded the chicken, because I hate the texture of cubed, and boiled the chicken with a few bouillon cubes for added flavor. I didn't even bother to blanch the veggies (too tired and lazy). Adding some garlic powder or other flavorings wouldn't hurt, but as written, this is a solid recipe, when you're craving chicken pot pie, but you don't have the energy for all the bells and whistles.

This one came out EXCELLENT for me!  I sauteed the celery, onion, then added to the soup mixture which I heated on the stove.  Not boiling, just gentle heat.  Added the chicken, and all the veggies to the soup mix and continued to heat through before pouring it into the baking pan.  Try using Campbells Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic!  I used 1 can of that and 1 of just the cream of chicken.  YUMMY!  I, too, 'cheated' and used the Pillsbury pie crust from the dairy section...Really good on a cold evening for supper! Thanks for this one!

this makes a bland pot pie and with thyme being the only spice, it is overwhelming. This is OK but I won't be making this again and I'm taking it out of my recipe book.

This turned out great!!! I diced up some fresh carrots and boiled them quickly along with some peas. I also sauted some diced leeks and added to the mixture. I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom along with a little bit of garlic. Yum!

Excellent !  I made two six inch pies, one was enough for my husband and myself, and one to freeze.  Made exactly as the recipe states.

Not my favorite recipe. In the future I would cut the thyme in half. It was a bit much. Left-overs were dry. I mixed in a can of chicken rice soup to add some moisture. I probably won't make this again.

Amazing recipe. It's so yummy, simple and easy, and a great way to use chicken leftovers.  My fiance, brother and dad all absolutely LOVED it when I made it for them. In my view it really can't be improved but just tweaked for personal taste. I like to make my own pie crust (it adds a little sweetness) and some poultry seasoning to the filling.

Even my picky father-in law ate this and complimented me on it.  The thyme really gives it the little something extra that was missing.  I have already made this three times (once for a family member) but will make it many more times in the future.  I think any type of "cream of" soup will work.  I experimented with cream of broccoli and that was a hit.  I also used a bunch of different frozen veggies and it was delicious and plus had TONs of veggies.  Beware of using low fat soup, it does take a bit of the flavor away.

Easy recipe.  A little bland so I added 1 tsp of Bell's Poultry seasoning.  That made the taste perfect!

It was a hit. I used cream of chicken and cream of potato and used about a half of cup of shredded cheddar as well. Used a little onion powder and garlic salt to jazz it up. Did not place on cookie sheet. Brushed a little egg on top. It was beautiful and delicious.

This recipes was oh so good.  It was the best chicken pot pie I had ever tasted.  I used store bought pie crust and added an egg wash to the bottom to keep the filling from making the crust soggy and added to the top also to give it a nice golden crispy crust.  It even looked great!

I used cream of chicken instead of cream of celery, and I used leftover Cornish game hen meat that I cooked in the crock pot for the previous dinner.  Mu husband loved it.

I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of Cream of celery and liked that.  Unless you REALLY love Thyme, I would not use it.  I thought it overpowered the chicken pot pie.  Next time, I will not half of the Thyme, or none at all.

This was SO easy and SO delicious! I opted to leave out the cream of celery soup as I was afraid it would be too soupy, (plus I'm not a fan of cream of celery). Next time, I think I will use 2 cans of cream of potato so there's a bit more "gravy". I chopped fresh carrots and fresh potatoes and added them uncooked. Next time I will also add some pearl onions, which I think would be great, too!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is okay. We all have different tastes. You have to love the taste of celery soup. I would of rather used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom.

This recipe is so delicious! My mom got snowed in with us during a blizzard so I wanted to make something extra yummy for supper. My eight year old son suggested chicken pot pie so together we found this recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly. For the chicken, I used two cups of Schwan's diced chicken meat that I thawed in the microwave. I used frozen beans, corn and peas. I also added a dash of Mrs. Dash Table Blend and garlic powder. The cream of potato soup is a great idea because it really seems like I added diced potatoes! This recipe is so easy and yummy! My mom asked for the recipe to make for my dad and brother! I think we found a new family favorite!!!

I love this recipe!  So quick and easy and always turns out fabulous.  I have found that Cream of Celery and Cream of Chicken Soup are the best combo (I have tried them all (potato, mushroom, asparagus, etc.).  Also a a teaspoon or so of garlic salt and pepper added to the filling are needed.  This is the perfect go to!!

My picky family loved this dish!  What a tasty way to hide some veggies!  I didn't have potato soup so I just baked a large potato and cut it into cubes like the chicken.  The thyme was the secret ingredient.  Will definitely be making this again!

The whole family loves this pot pie especially my 4 almost 5 year old.  I really didn't need to tweek the recipe, I just added some of our favortive salt seasoning to the chicken as it baked vs. boiling it.  Super yummy, easy home-cooked meal!

This recipe was excellent.  I don't really like pre-made pie crusts in fruity pie, so I didn't want to try it with this recipe.  I used the Veggie Potpie Crust recipe on this site which is excellent and paired it with this recipe.  I also used a full can of cream of potato soup as well as cream of chicken.  1 cup of potatoes, 1/2 cup carrots, 1/2 cup peas.  I used 8 oz cubed dark meat chicken.  I thought this was SO delicious and great comfort food.  The thyme was a nice change of flavor for me (seeing as I had to buy some!) And the possibilities (like adding mushrooms) are endless with this excellent base recipe!

My whole family loves loves loves this recipe! I make it about 2x a month and when they hear that's what were having for dinner they get very excited. I keep to the recipe, but this is one of those recipes that you could probably add anything to it and it would still be great.

This is a great recipe, and I love how easy it is.  I suggest using canned mixed vegetables, rather than frozen.  And, I don't have time to make crust, so I use frozen pie crust and buy the refrigerated pillsbury crust (red box) for the top.  And, I always have too much filling, so I make two pies at once.

This was good, but my husband did not go back for seconds. I followed others suggestions and sauteed some onion and celery and added to the mix, used a cup of frozen peas and carrots, and added a diced small potato. The onion made it kind of sweet, so won't add in the future. I will make as suggested, but use a frozen pea, carrot, potato mixture if I can find it. If not, will poach potatoes before adding to pie because they didn't cook even though I diced very small.  ALSO...place pie pan on cookie sheet so if pie boils over it doesn't mess up your oven.

Loved this recipe - I also used all of both cans of soup and thought it was just right. I typically LOVE seasonings but my husband and I both agreed the thyme was WAY too strong in this recipe. It was the only thing that kept us from saving the leftovers for later. Will definitely make it again (making one for a friend that just had a baby and one for us at the same time) but omit the thyme this time.

You can't go wrong with this recipe. I substituted cream of chicken for the cream of potato, which I couldn't find in my grocery store. As was suggested, I brushed the top crust with a little milk before baking and covered the edges with foil to prevent burning. A beautiful presentation, but I was not able to save any leftovers. It lost its appeal when all the filling oozed out into the pie plate. Darn! :)

I'm a college student with my first ever kitchen and got a craving for a home-cooked stick-to-your-ribs kinda meal last night.  So I made this for my fiance.  He's not a huge veggie fan, so I used canned peas, carrots, and new potatoes so they'd be mushier in the end.  For the crust though, I bought two cans of pilsbury crescent rolls.  I was really afraid it wouldn't cook through properly, so I mixed the filling in a large pot on the stove to heat it through before popping it into the oven.  That way, it only took 15 minutes to bake on 375.  It turned out perfect and he said he'd like to have it again!

This is such a good recipe because it's quick and easy, yet everyone thinks you spent hours preparing it.  I usually only use about 1/2 teaspoon thyme.

I made this recipe last night and I thought it was REALLY good. Thank you!  It was very easy too. I (like the others) added the whole can of cream of celery. I also added a LITTLE bit of milk and sherry to the sauce. I added pepper and garlic powder. EXCELLENT.

This recipe was very easy and very good!  I used Pillsbury crust and it was so good!  Per other suggestions, I used the entire can of Cream of Celery Soup and an entire can of Cream of Potato, and also added some more canned, diced potatoes (not sure it really needed that), but either way, I will definitely make this again!

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!! I used a little over 2 cups of frozen veggies, which I blanched, 1 large potato cooked in microwave and then chopped, 2 cans of cream of chicken, 1/2 t thyme, a lil garlic salt & onion powder, 1/2 C milk for creaminess and I used 3 quarter chicken pieces, which I had cooked in the crock pot. All of this made enough for 2 pies (you can easily freeze half of it for later), but i used a large pyrex pan and it all fit perfectly. AMAZING! Definitely will make many times!

This was excellent!  I did make some changes though.  I used fresh veggies (carrots, potatoes, and celery) and cans of green beans and corn.  I blanched the fresh veggies first for 5-6 minutes, then put the others in for the last minute or two.  I also ended up with enough for two pies, so I used a can of cream of celery, and two cans of cream of potato.  It probably could have used another can of soup.  This was very good, and easy to make.  I will definitely be making it again!

Really bland overall.  I think it would be better to use one can of cream of potato and one of cream of chicken for better flavor.  Also, eventhough I used the whole can of cream of celery, it still didn't have enough juice for my hubby, adding a 1/2 cup of milk or so would be good and lastly, if I ever make this again, I would use rotisserie chicken to add additional flavor.  Not sure if I will keep this one.  It was super easy though.

This is really excellent. I made a couple minor changes -- added an additional can of soup (cream of chicken) and some milk for more sauce. Instead of pie crust, I topped with biscuits from the "Kentucky Biscuits" recipe on this site. Used a rotisserie chicken for more flavor.  Tastes amazing!

Very simple.  I used 1 15oz can of  veggies and 1 can of white potatos cut up.  Cream of roasted garlic mushroom soup amd Cream of broccoli, onion powder, garlic powder and 1 crushed bullion cube an 1/4 cup of milk.  The refrigerated crusts ad viola...a meal you're family will love.  I think you could use just about any variety of soups to switch this up and it would still be great.

I used a Pillsbury roll-out pie crust (the kind in the long red box) and frozen mixed vegetables for soup, added some oregano, and used 1 1/2 cans of cream of celery soup rather than 1/2 can celery + 1 can potato. As other reviewers said, the thyme was a bit much, but not enough to keep my family from pigging out on this pot pie! It was incredibly delicious. My husband isn't normally a fan of chicken or mixed veggies but he raved about this pie. My four year old son, who has shunned every single chicken pot pie anyone has ever given him, said, "Mmmmm, this is yummy, Mommy!" I doubled this recipe and froze 1/2 of the chicken/veggie mixture so when I want to make it again, all I have to do is thaw it and put it in a pie crust to bake. I can't wait to have it again, and I think I'll make this next time I bring a meal to someone.

If you love thyme then you will love this recipe.  It was all we could taste!  I cut the thyme back to a little more than 1/2t and it was still way too much.  The pie was also very dry.  I like the filling to bubble out of the crust.  It was very easy to make and I didn't have to cook it nearly as long as suggested.

This was fantastic! My husband said I can only make it once in a while though. He ate too much! I also used the cream of chicken instead of the celery soup. I removed the thyme and just used some of my favorite seasonings I had in the cabinet and bought the always fabulous pilsbury roll out pie crust. When i am feeling ambitious, i'd like to try with fresh veggies and home-made pie crust.

Not a showstopper; quite bland, and perhaps using the frozen veggies was my mistake. They turned limp and soggy inside of my pie. I actually prefer the frozen pies and will pass on this recipe next time! Sure, it was cheap and easy, but not at all delicious.

This was very good. I used the Pillsbury crust but didn't cover the edges w/ foil (next time I will). I also used about 2/3 tsp of thyme and still felt it was a bit much. And I think next time I'll add a bit more vegetables too. All in all it was a great recipe w/ great flavor and little preparation.

My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  The thyme seems like it will be a little much when baking, but ends up flavoring perfectly in the end.  I didn't have any difficulty with most of the preparation, but the ready-made pie crusts I bought gave me some trouble.  The top one tore a lot when I tried to add it, however, it still came out great after being patched a little.  Overall this was very easy and tasty -- we will make it again!

I love this recipe. It is always a hit, and I can always count on this to impress friends, and it doesn't take forever to make. I usually buy frozen vegetables and potatoes, put in cream of chicken and potato and top the top shell with egg to make it brown, as suggested before, and everyone always loves it.

This was a great hit with my husband!  I substituted cream of chicken soup for the celery soup, kept the potato soup and used all of both cans of soup. I used 2 1/2 + cups of frozen mixed veggies and added about 1/4 cup chopped onion; did not use thyme. It filled the Pillsbury dairy crust in a deep dish pie pan. Awesome! Thanks for sharing it.

Excellent recipe, quick and easy and very tasty.  My husband raved about it, and requested it again the next night.  I used a deep dish pie pan, so I added both full cans of soup and another 1/2 can of cream of chicken and another 1/2 cup of veggies.

What a great recipe.  I fixed this for my husband and ten-year-old daughter and they loved it.  We ate almost the entire pie!  I did not alter from the recipe, and plan to fix it again.

I used leftover chicken and a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of celery (both reduced fat and sodium) and used only 1/2t thyme and it was fantastic.  We restrained ourselves from eating it all at once so we could have it again tomorrow.  Thanks for an easy and great recipe.

I didn't have potato soup so I diced and boiled 5 small ones, and added one can each cream of mushroom and chicken, added some diced fresh veggies from the garden and it made a 10 x 13" double crust, but it was awesome.

Simple and REALLY good!  I actually didn't even cook the chicken before mixing all the ingredients together because the chicken cooks right in the pie!  We have this a lot!

This was so easy and yummy! The only change I made was to buy refrigerated pie crusts, and I used 1 can cream of potato soup and 1 can cream of chicken soup.  My boyfriend hates vegetables, and he said this was delicious!

This was very good.  I used a store bought pie crust and I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and substituted sour cream and a touch of milk for the half can of soup. I also added a partially baked diced potato. My husband didn't care for the thyme so will decrease or leave out next time.  Very quick, easy and delicious.

A really good pot pie but seems to need a more creamy texture inside-I would add more soup or dilute it with milk next time.  I'll make this one again, there was just nothing stellar about it.

This is delicious as is. Been making this for years...and naturally it has slightly evolved. I use 2 full cans of cream of potato soup and a half cup of milk. I add a little extra thyme as well as salt, pepper and garlic. And if I am short on time, I use a store bought rotisserie chicken that I debone and shred/dice. I always pre-bake the bottom crust while making the filling and brush the top with an egg wash. I have never had to cover the crust with aluminum foil. This typically makes 2 pies for us. I bake one and refrigerate the other, then bake the other a few days later. (Just 2 of us and we don’t mind eating the same thing for several days) Thinking I might try it with a mashed potato topper like shepherd’s pie.

I made this last night. Only changes I made was used the whole can of cream of celery soup and added a little garlic powder. It turned out so good! Even my son who isn't a big veggie eater had seconds and ate the leftovers for lunch today. Next time I'm going to use cream of mushroom soup and add mushrooms. Great recipe & so easy!

Super easy! And super inexpensive. I use both full cans of soup and Wegmans brand pie crust and the timing is perfect on the recipe! Make sure to use the tin foil for the first half an hour.

This was super easy and very good. *The only changes that I made~I used a 14 oz. package of mixed vegetables (3 c.), added a diced medium potato, added about 3 T. of minced onion and I used the full can of cream of celery soup.  I also used about 1/2 c. of the chicken broth to thin the mixture a little. It made a nice full pie. A KEEPER for sure.

I made this recipe exactly as it shows....it was OK. Like others the bottom crust did not bake properly due to the cookie sheet.  I will add less thyme on my next attempt and omit the cookie sheet. I believe with these tweaks this recipe will be 5 stars.

Everyone loved the pie! But I do wish I would have come to the review section before I cooked it. I agree with what others that said about not using as much thyme. The thyme was a bit over powering. Also the pie edges browned more than I wanted them to. Next time I'll keep the aluminum on a little longer.

My family loves this recipe. I only make two changes - black pepper instead of thyme and cream of mushroom instead of celery. I buy the two pack of frozen deep dish pie crusts and the refrigerated two pack of rolled pie crust for the top. I always make two pies at a time and freeze one if we don't need it immediately. But, my guys love it, so I usually cook both. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this for years and love it! The only thing i changed is i used a can of cream of potato soup instead of celery. I also add a can of diced potatoes to it. I make my own crust recipes. I also make about twenty at a time and freeze them.  Some big size and most  individual  size. They freeze well too.  I have used already cooked rotisserie chicken and left over turkey at thanksgiving. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I have made this a couple of times.  Last time I used 1 can of Cream of Chicken and 1 can Cream of Celery soup - I didn't have the potato soup.  I did not Blanch the vegetables.  Divided it and made 2 smaller pot pies.  Very easy and we enjoy it.  Very Good!

This recipe is easy and a family favorite.  I made a few changes;
I used an entire can of the celery & potato soup not the 1/2 can called for as well as added another chicken breast (3 total). It is not to soupy it is a great consistancy. I added a tsp of salt and a tsp. of black pepper. I found there was no need to blanch the frozen peas and carrots just put them in  as is. If I want to make it a little creameries for the kids,  I add 1 cup of shredded jack cheese and 1/4 cup of milk.

Only change was using rotisserie chicken and adding a few tablespoons of evaporated milk.

Used Pillsbury premade crust, i cooked the bottom crust to ensure it was cooked, 350 for 10mins  Added my own spices, garlic powder, onion powder, Caribbean citrus(dash) all to taste. I also boiled the chicken in the same spices. I did not use any thyme. Used an entire can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of potato.  I put a little bit of cheese (it could have propably used more if you like cheese).  I also put about 2 tbs of mayo and 2 tbs if sour cream.  It turned out delicious.

Very simple and delicious recipe. My husband and I love pot pie and I had some leftover biscuits from the night before. I halved them and put them on top of the filling. Foe the filling I couldn't find cream of potato so I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery. I added the thyme and salt and pepper. I mixed it all together while my chicken was boiling. I cubed the chicken once done and mixed everything together with about a cup of frozen veggie mix. Then I put foil on top of my pan and baked for 30-minutes. Then the final two minutes I placed my already cooked biscuits on top. Cover with foil again as to not burn the biscuits. And done! It was delicious. My husband loved it. He said it was full of flavor and not salty. Will definitely make again. Next time I want to try putting biscuits at the bottom and then the top too.

Was tasty, and looked beautiful. I also used the Pillsbury prepared crusts (red box). Next time I will probably cut Thyme in half as I thought that was a little overpowering but my Wife had no complaints. I also added a half can of cream of chicken, partially to mellow the Thyme a bit. I'll probably still add the cream of chicken next time even if I cut Thyme in half. Still, a good and easy recipe that we try again.

I'm giving this 5 stars not for taste but ease. It did not have a "from scratch" taste but my kidlets are sick. I did not want the hassle of making dinner like usual so this recipe accoplished my goal. I did like the thyme flavor. Also, I would add maybe 1/2 cup more veggie, chicken, or a mixture of both just to fill the pie more.

This was a huge hit with my family. I used the refrigerator pillsbury pie crusts. I used my left over chicken that I cooked in the crockpot the day before. I also added some left over diced potatoes. Added salt and pepper to taste and subbed poultry seasoning for the thyme. I used 1 can cream of chicken and cream of celery each.

Tweaked it a little by adding garlic and onion powder, black pepper and sautéed onion.  The last 30 minutes I moved the dish along with the cookie sheet to the bottom oven rack and the bottom crust came out well done, crispy like.

This is one my kids ask for over and over.  I would give it five stars, but since it's better with a few small modifications, am only giving it four.  Here are my modifications: (1) I use cream of mushroom instead of celery, (2) I cook 3 chicken breasts in a frying pan in about 3/4" of water and season with Slap Ya Mama and Worchestershire sauce, then shred rather than dice the chicken, (3) I bake the bottom crust for ten minutes before filling the pie, (4) I paint the top crust with an egg wash before baking, (4) I cut the thyme in half.  On occasion, I will mix in a half cup of sour cream and/or a half cup of shredded mild cheddar cheese for when I want that extra richness.  All in all, a wonderful, easy, dependable recipe your family is sure to enjoy and ask for again.

I loved this recipe. The crust was flaky.  The inside was great with the veggies and creams of celery and potato soups. All I changed was cooked the chicken on a fry pan, added more seasonings, and used the whole cream of celery soup of soup.

I was nervous about making this recipe...I kinda combined two recipes in one.  Like other reviewers I added potatoes and cream of mushroom soup (that's what I had on had).  I didn't use the potato soup or the other one it calls for.  I added some onions to it as well.  To give it just a tad more liquid I added some milk and chicken broth.  It came out great!  Oh and I only added a tiny amount of thyme, because I think it can get overpowering really fast!

I didn't have tyme and I love garlic, so I added about 1 tsp. of minced garlic and it turned out really tasty! Perfectly golden and crisp crust. However, I followed directions eactly other than the tyme and my filling was very soup like. Tasted great, but runny runny.

A delicious warm meal for Fall. You might want to season your chicken with your favorite spices to give more flavor. I diced up the chicken and browned it in olive oil with salt, pepper, garlic and basil instead of thyme. I thought the serving size was a little off. My family of 3 ate more than half of it.

why did the chicken cross the road?  TO LINE UP TO BE IN THIS POT PIE! It was a dream in my mouth, soo delicious! The vegetables mixed with the skinless chicken and soup was just unbelievably SCRUMPDIDLIUMPTIOUS! It totally converted me from being a vegan and now all I want is meat 24/7, I'm now 100% carnivore!

This was a great base to start with and add as you go!  I added 1 can of cream chicken/mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken and added a little water.  I used a frozen vegetable's and pie crust but used the Pilsbury roll out crust for the top.  I added Onion, Parsley, Salt, Pepper and Thyme.  It came out perfect!

i really like this recipe, it is so easy and actually yummy. i made it yesterday and my husband's comment was "it's really good." i rarely get "it's really good" when it comes to cooking. the only thing i did was that i spread biscuit mix on top instead of a pie crust. i love biscuits!

Good basic recipe, but unless you REALLY like thyme, 1/2 teaspoon should be plenty.  If you don't like thyme, just substitute something else.  Almost any seasoning will work.  Instead of boiling the chicken, I drizzle a little olive oil over it and sprinkle it with salt, pepper and garlic and then bake it.  I think it gives the whole thing a lot more flavor.

I did this for a chicken throw down (Like with Bobby Flay) with my mom. We just had to use the chicken in one way of another also like an Iron Chef battle. I came looking for a chicken pot pie and got this one. Wow, it was great. I beat my mom and enjoyed a great meal. The only problem was that it needed more spice but that may have been my fault. Amazing!

I used 2 already made frozen pie crusts, the healthy request cream of celery, and some canned and fresh veggies and it was great.  My husband has already asked me to make it again!!

This was wonderful!  I added just a touch of thyme when I was cooking the chicken and that was a perfect amount.  The crust was perfect.  The only thing I would change next time is I would a add a few tablespoons of milk to the filling.  I would have liked it just a tad creamier.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was such a quick and easy meal! Great basic recipe....easy to add and take away to your family's liking! To avoid the 'bland' flavor, I sauteed chicken and our fav. veggies with seasonings. When veggies almost to desired consistency I added cream-of soup then placed in pie pan. Delicious! * I also like the idea of individual portion potpies...great for families with picky eaters~may let kids add their favorite veggies to their own pie next time! :)

I am a beginner cook (forced into it because I became a mother!) but I made this recipe because my son loves pot pie.  I would have to agree that this recipe is a little bland but not being an expert cook I don't know what's missing.  I will say that it is an extremely easy recipe.  I also made it a little more fun and dealt with the important issue of portion control by making individual pot pie muffins, using a 12 cup muffin tin.  My son loves them and he even got to help cook with mommy.

I was worried this Chicken Pot Pie would be bland, but went ahead with directions as written. I was right. It's pretty boring as written. I think some sauteed onions and garlic would do wonders for this recipe. However, it's basic, easy and tastes pretty good for a soup based recipe.

This was a very good recipe and would be especially good on a cool fall day. I used the whole can of Cream of Celery and I substituted 1 can of Cream of Chicken.  I also used a refrigerated roll-out crust and the results were very good.  Will definitely make this again.

This was a great, easy recipe...my boyfriend almost died when he saw how good it looked and again when he tasted it. He thought I spent hours cooking ;). I did add some garlic powder,onion powder and pepper per one of the suggestions. The only thing I would do is add the 2nd half of the can of soup...it would be better a little creamier IMO and I only used half the Thyme (dried) and it was still a bit overwhelming. I also did an egg wash which made the crust just beautiful and flaky. Will definitly do this one again!!

This was a great base recipe to build on. I hardly ever follow a recipe. I used cream of mushroom, left over pulled chicken, and left over vegetables from the fridge. My pie turned out so good even the kids ate it!

I'll surely make this again!  Used fresh veggies (onion, green beans, carrots, celery, potatoes) and subbed cream of chicken for cream of potato soup.  I also used a roasted rotisserie chicken from the store-- great flavor!

Super easy, great dish. A new staple in our house. I use carrots, potatoes, celery, peas, and it makes it really chunky, which everyone loves and makes the dish stretch. Yum!

My boyfriend raved over this one - even from just the smell coming from the oven. I personally thought it was very good and held up well, didn't get too soupy upon cutting but we waited about 10 min for it to cool. I next time would cut back or eliminate the thyme, but I did add a teaspoon of both poulry seasoning and garlic powder. And I used the pillsbury premade dough from the red box and it was perfect. Was delicious to eat on a cold and stormy night in Feb!

Definitely 5 stars with a few alterations.  I used 1 chicken breast cubed.  I drizzled 2 T. EVOO, garlic powder, poutry seasoning, salt and pepper over chicken and mixed thoroughly.  Then sautee'd until chicken was nearly done.  Meanwhile, I I cubed 2 medium potatoes and  microwaved the frozen vegetables with the potatoes in chicken broth for 6 minutes on high.  I mixed 2 cans cream of chicken soup with a 1 cup broth from vegetables and a 1/4 cup milk.  I put the vegetables and soup mixtue into the pan with the chicken and simmered until heated through.  I egg washed the lower crust the poured the chicken mixture in, placed the upper crust over the top and egg washed it.  Covered the edges with foil and baked at 350 degrees for 55 minutes.  Delicious, creamy filling with a slightly crispy crust.  I will definitely make this again with the changes above!  This is my new Chicken Pot Pie recipe...no more store bought frozen for us.  Thanks for the recipe Leslie.

This is my husbands absolute favorite dish! We do not eat meat, so I substitute the chicken with with two diced potatoes. I also use fresh veggies instead of frozen- carrots, peas, and mushrooms. I will sometimes add broccoli if I have it. This is simple and perfect!

I used a Pillsbury Refrigerated crust. Didn't know what I would do with the other 1/2 of the can of soup, so put the whole can in. Also, didn't have any thyme, so used the same amount of Poultry Seasoning. Very easy to make, and tasty.

Great Recipe, although I did add my own touches to it...and extra seasonings...the Betty Crocker Pre-made crust was wonderful and easy...the hardest thing about this recipe was opening up the soup cans! I did add milk to the soups...and I used full cans. Also...this would be great using turkey!

This was a good recipe, but I gave it 4 out of 5 because I made some changes. I added fresh, cubed potatoes, carrots, and I replaced the peas with edamame beans (thats all i had). I also used a full can of cream of celery soup & a half can of cream of chicken. I also used a store bought pre made pillsbury topping that another user suggested, but I think next time I will make my own. Other then the changes this was my first time making something like this and it was simple and good!!

Much easier to make than I thought. I'd never boiled chicken or blanched vegetables, so I was concerned that I'd encounter some problems, but I had none! I followed the recipe exactly (except I did use less thyme after reading the other reviews), and I used the  Pillsbury refrigerated crust in the red box. Everything turned out great. My husband gave me a round of applause after cleaning his plate, and we have leftovers that we're actually looking forward to having! I'm very pleased with my first chicken pot pie and will make it again.

My husband loved this recipe. It is so easy to make. I would recommend this to anyone who is just starting to cook. I did change the cr of potatoe to cr of chicken and added 3 small cubed potatoes. It was just like a swanson pot pie but much better.

This was a HUGE hit in our house! I did make a few changes. I used 1 can of cream of potato soup and 1/2 can of 99% fat free cream of mushroom to try and lower the fat grams. I also added a splash of milk to make it a little less thick. And I left out the thyme bc we didn't have any. It turned out GREAT! We ate from it 2 nights in a row and I can't wait to make it again.

We all loved this recipe!  I didn't think there was too much thyme at all.  The only things I did that weren't in the recipe are I added a dash of milk to the soups before mixing them for a smoother consistency, and I sauteed the chicken in a little butter instead of boiling it.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

5 stars for ease-flavor&consistency ok. Next time I'll reduce the soup as it was thick, salty and gloppy. Like condensed soup.

This dish was fantastic except for the Thyme-1 tsp is a little too strong.  I'm not the kind of person who is afraid of seasonings, but it just didn't seem to fit well.  Next time, I will omit that and add salt and pepper to taste.

This recipe was so easy and the family loved it!  All of them! which is a miracle. I hate peas so I substitued with package of steamfresh broccoli, cauliflower and carrots and added some corn. It was a huge hit and I will definitely make again.

This recipe is so simple, so quick, but looks like you spent all day on it.  Instead of regular mixed vegetables I used 1 cup of succotash and 1 cup of carrots and peas.  There are never any left overs!

Very very tasty and easy. I used 2 large and 1 small chicken breast halves, store brand pie crust (in the long box)two cans of mushroom soup (all I had on hand)and I first very lightly browned the chicken breast and then boiled them in water with some chicken boullion thrown in. I used frozen brocolli,cauliflower and carrot mix thawed out (probably more than two cups!) and I splashed some of the chicken broth into the mix to thin it out to my taste. For the most part, I just used the basic recipe with what I had on hand and it was REALLY good, my husband loved it too. I will certainly make this again. I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow!

I LOVE this recipe!!  The crust doesn't always look pretty when I make it, but it sure does taste GOOD.  I usually make 2 pies at once because it calls for only 1/2 of a can of cream of celery soup, but I've found that you can use the whole can and it tastes pretty much the same... just be sure to use a deep dish pie crust.  YUM!!

didnt like it much, no reviews from my family about it, maybe because i didn`t have the celery soup so it wasn`t exactly the same recipe.

This was a very good pot pie. It was also easy to prepare (when using a pre-made crust). However, after making it I've decided that I like the Bisquick style chicken cassarole with more bread on the top better.  That isn't the fault of this recipe though, just a prefrence on my part.

So good, my family might not let me get away with serving store bought pot pies anymore... I used 2 cans of cream of potato as it was what I had available. Also used fresh carrot and celery as well as frozen corn and peas blanched in the microwave as suggested by another reviewer. I made the the pastry for a double pie-crust on this site and it was wonderful. I didn't have thyme, so I substituted it for poultry seasoning,a little garlic salt and pepper. We also prefer a little "runnier" consistency, so I did add just a little chicken broth to the sauce. I had no trouble with the crust browning.  Will definitely make again. The results were well worth the effort, but to be honest it wasn't nearly as time consuming as it sounds to do all from fresh... about 30 for me with distractions from kids...

You have to try this recipe! I always add some milk to the mixture to make it have more "sauce" and add the whole cans of potato and celery. Definately worth making!

Very good overall, but I think it needed more soup as it turned out a bit dry.  I would use 2 cans cream of chicken and half a can of cream of celery next time and it should be perfect.  The flavor was great, and it was easy to make.  This will be a staple for me in the wintertime.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  By far the best chicken pot pie I have ever had.  Although I did add a ton of fresh vegetables as per another reviewers suggestion (onions, mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, celery, etc), so I ended up with enough mixture to make two pot pies, which is excellent. I didn't blanch the vegetables, but I threw them in a pot with a bit of garlic and some oil and sauteed them for a bit. The Thyme adds a great touch, I did add some black pepper and cayanne pepper because I love it in everything. Great right when its made and just as good the next few days for leftovers.  This recipe was so easy, and it was a great way for me to use up extra vegetables, as well as cream of chicken and cream of celery soups which I had in the cupboard but don't eat.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We love a good pot pie so we searched for a while for one to try.  We made this one substituting fresh veggies instead of frozen ones.  We added celery, carrots, peas, and onion.  Next time we will add potatoes and use cream of chicken soup or chicken broth instead of the potatoe soup.

I'm giving this a 5 because my family loved it. I didn't care for it, but that's probably because the only chicken pot pie I like is the frozen ones made from Swanson, so that doesn't say much. I did do things a little different. I used 1 3/4 cans of cream of chicken soup because that's what I had. I mixed it with a little half and half so that it wasn't too thick. I chopped up fresh celery and carrots and potatoes. I steamed those for awhile so they wouldn't be crunchy in the pie. I added frozen peas.  I used 3 chicken breasts. I made it in an 8X8 pan so that it would be thick and have a lot of the filling with each serving. I will make again for my family!

Great recipe!  I made this the other night for supper, and everyone enjoyed it especially my little boy, which he had 2 helpings!  I didn't have cream of potato soup, so I substituted cream of chicken and it worked out well.  It is a great comfort food as well as quick and easy.  Thanks again!

Soooo good! I used cream of chicken soup instead of celery, used 2 full cans of the soups. Added frozen pearl onions with the vegetables. Used frozen ready made pie crust. Will be making again very soon.

Very Good! My husband gave it 5 stars and he is a very picky eater. I used a store bought crust, substituted Cream of Chicken soup for Cream of Celery and used both full cans of soup, I also seasoned with Salt & Pepper and Onion Powder. Next time I will omit the thyme. Turned out excellent and very easy!

I tried this recipe the other day when I had some left over roasted chicken and it was awesome!  I've found I had to use both full cans of soup (guess I had a lot of chicken!), and I used frozen pie crust to make it even faster.  My husband loves it and I'm making it again tonight.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Used Cream of Chicken soup instead and added some salt and black pepper.  Filling was a little dry, but used the 1/2 can of soup, mixed with some milk, for gravy...taste was great.

This was by far the best recipe for chicken pot pie.  My entire family devoured it and wanted me to make another (just myself, my husband, a 6 yr old and a 1 yr old).  I omitted the thyme. SOOO easy to make. It's in my regular rotation now.

This was a very easy pot pie recipe.  I used leftover chicken I had and diced it up.  I also used the Pilsbury pie crusts, because they are so easy to use.  It turned out very good.  You could make the dish ahead of time, and just pop it in the oven when you needed it.

Really delicious! I used fresh diced carrots and potatoes instead of frozen, and then I used a whole can of cream of broccoli and half a can of cream of mushroom. I kept everything else, and I thought the thyme added a great flavor. Will definitely make this many times this winter.

Very very easy and delicious.  I used frozen cauliflower, broccoli, peas and carrots.  Added some mushrooms and went with cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups.  The whole thing came out wonderfully and my husband had three servings!  Thanks so much.

Loved it. I used a can of cream of chicken soup and half a can of cream of mushroom because I didnt have cream of potatoe or celery. It still turned out wonderful. Also I put foil around the edge of the crust to keep it from burning and took it off 10-15 minutes before it was time to take it out of the oven.

DELICIOUS! I doubled the recipe to make several individual pies. I also used cream of mushroom and chicken instead of celery and potato (I did add potato cubes, broccoli and cauliflower to the mixture)

Even though I modified, Im sure it would have been just as wonderful if I had followed the recipe. AND SO EASY!

This is super and easy. I used deep dished  crust, 3 chicken breasts, the whole can of celery soup, and 1/2 thyme although full amount would of been fine.  I also added 1 soup can full of chicken stock and a cup of diced potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!
