Really rich and hard to eat more than one. Not spicy enough. I won't make this again.

Maybe would have been better with onion instead of the chives. To me they made it too stringy. Especially when left in fridge for a couple of hours, also the wasabi peas went soft. This would be a recipe you need to eat once made.

These are loved or hated, no middle ground.  Took to a party and it was amusing to watch.  Doubled the recipe - super easy to make.  I'll be doing this again for sure.  May even just do it for a snack.  I was one of the many that loved them!
