My plan was to have these with our grilled steaks tonight (without the bun) but Hubs was not amenable to that and, for that matter, really wasn't too enthused about trying it period.  He did agree, however, to have this as a light lunch (which I thought was weird, but whatever. I was lucky he was a good sport and tried it at all).  We both agreed to have this on its own, without the bun. We both enjoyed it! I thought it would have been better with any number of seasonings and/or sauces, but Hubs said he liked the simplicity of it just as, with just a bit of salt and pepper.  While it was okay for a light lunch, I would still prefer this (again, without the bun) as either a side dish or warm salad.  Nice presentation, tastes wonderful and I feel like I did something healthy and good for myself!

Very tasty!  I seasoned them lightly with Montreal Steak seasoning and added a slice of provolone!  Great meatless meal!

I used my panini maker to grill the portobellos - easy and quick!  I also added some crumbled gorgonzola cheese and sliced tomatoes to the sandwich.  Tasty!

Hit the spot! Perfectly simple and tasty. I put a slice of baby swiss on top. Will make again.

Loved it!  My Husband gave it 5 stars and that is hard to get!  I did change it a bit as I did not have an avocado.  Instead, I added some fresh picked rosemary and thyme to the mushrooms as they were finishing on the grill, added some Swiss cheese and then added sliced tomato with fresh picked basil.  Served it on a toasted bagel thin bun.  Delicious!!

Very good.  I thought it would need some more condiments but it was fine without it.  Very weight watchers friendly.

Loved this recipe!  My 12 year old said she now prefers this over a hamburger!  We added mayo on the bun.  She said she would like to add mozerella to hers next time.  I like it as is.

So easy and delicous.  Even my husband who is a devoted carnivore enjoyed.  Served with sweet potato fries.

Delicious!  I marinated my portabella with a greek marinade which went very well with the red onion and avocado.  Serve on a whole wheat kaiser and you're eating healthy!
