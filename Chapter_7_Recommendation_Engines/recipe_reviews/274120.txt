6.29.19  A cup of sugar seemed like a lot for a family who really isn’t into super-sweet these days.  My bananas were VERY ripe, and VERY sweet, so I felt comfortable in reducing the sugar amount by half.  Trying to watch my sugar these days, so I substituted Truvia® Baking Blend for the sugar which gave us just about the perfect level of sweetness (personal taste).  I used three 3-1/2”x6” loaf pans and baked at 350ºF for 35 minutes.  I love these small loaf pans for portion control more than anything else.  They work great because it keeps us from totally pigging out when something tastes good, like this recipe.  They baked up moist, tender, loaded with flavor,  and oh yeah, those soft chocolate chips (don’t skip them) accented the banana flavor oh-so-well.   Just Emily, thanks for sharing your recipe, this one’s a keeper.

More flavor than the other recipe that I use. Although I added fresh ground nutmeg, about 1 tsp. This recipe was a little easier to put together than my other recipe. I am very happy with this recipe, and will use it again.

I had only 2 very yucky brown bananas, so I used what I had.  I put them in 3 small bread pans and they baked beautifully!  I will make this again when I have brown bananas.
