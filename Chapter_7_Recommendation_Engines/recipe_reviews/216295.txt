This cake is amazing. It's one of the first desserts I've made that was completely finished by my family. It is even better the next day, so I would recommend making it the day before you plan on serving it so that the flavors really meld. The ganache should be properly chilled in order to get the eclair texture. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and the ganache tasted great. Please don't substitute anything else for this crust, either--the crust what makes the cake taste like a true eclair. The pastry shell stays firm enough to support the filling without getting soft or soggy. I have tried other eclair cake recipes that call for graham cracker crumbs in layers and they do not have the delicious and realistic eclair taste that this recipe has. Freeze the beater(s) along with the mixing bowl and your whipped cream will form stiff peaks faster. And make sure your bowl is completely clean before attempting to whip the cream; that's why you whip it before you mix the pudding. Fold in pudding with a spatula and don't overmix and it will stay fluffy. Hope this helps!

UPDATE: the second time around I beat the dough a lot more, until it was more creamy, and it spread easily in the pan.  It poofed up like the recipe said and wasn't as eggy tasting.  It was perfect!
This is so delicious! My crust didn't poof up like the recipe said so I was a little worried, but it came out just fine.  It was a bit eggy; I might try it with 3 eggs instead of 4 next time.  Make sure you use heavy whipping cream (if your grocery store doesn't carry "heavy cream"), especially for the ganache, and it to a boil before adding it to the chocolate.  It also must sit for 1-2 minutes before whisking it together.  Otherwise it may not harden.

I can't say enough about this cake.  It is delicious!  The choux pastry is simple to make, and the slight saltiness of it is perfect with the creamy filling and chocolate ganache.  I made it for a friend's b-day and everyone loved it.  I am looking for a reason to make it again soon!

I think this is an amazing dessert. Everytime I make everyone raves how good it is. Very easy to make. I found if you use the better chocolate the ganache turns out perfect. I use Ghirardelli bittersweet baking chips. Saves on chopping chocolate also just dump the bag in a bowl and add the hot cream turns out perfect everytime.

this was very easy to make but did use a lot of bowls, utensils, etc. and time. i had a feeling the faux cream filling (made with pudding mixes) was not going to be that great, and it wasn't. the crust got a little soggy for my taste (that dough probably really wasn't mean to be a bottom crust of a "cake"). will most probably not make again.

I made this for my husband tonight, and he said it was the best dessert I've ever made. I agree. The flavor of the filling was perfect and the chocolate on top was so rich. This took me a bit of time, but it was quite easy and worth every minute. YUM. Have a cup of tea ready, because this is so rich and delicious. Thanks for the recipe! It is wonderful!

I have made this several times, and everyone has always loved it. I have as of yet to actually make it as a single cake though. I have done it in mini loaf pans, and piped out like eclairs from the store. Mede 75 for a banquet, and none were left, everyone thought I bought them. This is by far the best eclair recipe that I have made. Just follow directions...easy

I was almost going to make another recipe which used graham crackers, so glad I didn't! This was amazing! The pastry shell is a must for it to really taste like a real eclair. I used French vanilla pudding but other than that followed it exactly. The ganache was beautiful once it hardened and everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again.

Wonderful! I used this recipe for all parts of the cake, but followed the directions for the shape of it from the Chocolate Eclair Torte recipe- dropping tablespoons of the dough in a circle onto parchment paper to bake.  I spread the filling and ganache on top of that.  The filling is very tasty- the heavy cream tones down the sweetness of the pudding, and makes it really rich.  The dough is light and soft, and puffed up perfectly as it baked.  I will definitely be making this again!

amazing! easy but a bit time consuming. I brought it to work today and everybody loves it and a few requests for the recipe print out. I add only 3/4C cream to the chocolate ganache and also a few TBS of powdered sugar.

This turned out really well, and is nice and easy! My brother requested it for his birthday and it was a hit with the entire family. The one problem I had was that "1c" of chopped chocolate was not enough in proportion to the cream to make ganache, it ended up more like hot cocoa. I added about 2oz extra chocolate and it came out fine, but there was also lots of extra ganache, so I probably could have gotten away with 3/4c of cream and less chocolate. Every other ganache recipe I've ever made measured chocolate by weight, so that was probably the problem. I'd estimate you need about 6oz chocolate for 1c cream.

My first attempt turned out pretty good but not perfect.  My ganache didn't harden so I think I may have gotten the wrong kind of chocolate.  The shell was pretty good but a little thick.  Other than that, it was really good.  The filling was perfect!

Just made this for the second time.  It has to be an all time favorite.  Very easy, tastes just like an eclair. I bake almost everyday and have many recipies in my file.  This one is a keeper!

AMAZING!  I followed the directions exactly.  It was quite simple to make.  It tasted like a gourmet pastry that you'd get from a bakery.  I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it- they said I should open my own bakery!  Definitely one of the best desserts I've ever made.  Thanks for this recipe!

Why did I try this recipe? It is so good that I want it all the time! Followed it to the T and it was so so yummy! Tastes just like an Eclair!! Love the crust, love the filling, and love the chocolate. So what if you have to use more than one bowl. This is the real deal. Thank you Laney Jane my tastebuds thank you!!!

My husband loves this 'cake' so much! He requests it all of the time. I brought it to my in laws for Christmas and they all enjoyed it as well! I don't add any additional sugar/vanilla to the whipped cream because the pudding mix is sweet enough. I have also halved the recipe and it turned out just as well (I did cut the baking time to 15 minutes).

This is a bit time consuming, but well worth it.  I've made the one before with graham crackers and the pre-made frosting, and this one is SOOOOOO much better!  I made this for a birthday party at work and got great reviews!

I don't get it.....a previous reviewer said, now I just have to figure out what to do with all those egg whites....WHAT? what am I missing? Didn't say anything about separating the eggs. My ganache didn't set up AT ALL. It was like chocolate syrup. I think it was MY BAD. I went online and checked the differences between heavy and whipping cream, there is a big dif. Don't make my mistake and use whipping cream. I had a lot and didn't think it would matter. But I do think I'd like it with a touch of sweetness. I would try the sour cream ganache like the other reviewer. This would probably be five stars for me it I had done it correctly. :)

Love, love, love this recipe!  I make it in 2 varieties, as written and without the pudding (double the whipped cream and powdered sugar to taste).  You can use any ganache recipe you'd like.  I am looking forward to being creative with this... making the dough, letting it cool, putting a layer of ice cream and then toppings... or fruit and caramel... the possibilities are endless!  Thank you Laney Jane!!!

I've made this so many times, and it is always a hit with my guests.  I usually use the instant french vanilla pudding mix.  If you don't have the time or ingredients to make homemade whipped cream, you can use cool whip, although it definitely is better with homemade!

This recipe is the best eclair cake that I found.  I loved that it was super easy and fun to make.  The pastry crust was a cinch and the filling devine!  Had a hard time keeping my fingers out of the bowl.  The only reason that held me from rating 5 stars was that the ganache topping, even though super rich and had absolutely no complaints, I found a little bitter.  Obviously because of the bittersweet chocolate but maybe next time I may add some honey or confectioners sugar to it.

I'm giving this 5 stars for taste and presentation, although I will make slight modifications next time.
If you mound the dough more towards the centre, you'll get a better baked shape.  Next time I'll use half the filling ingredients.  I don't prefer a Ganache for chocolate eclairs.  I made one from Good Housekeeping that is better (in our opinion)(2tbsp butter or margarine, 2squares unsweetened Chocolate, 2tbsp hot water, 1-1.5 c. icing sugar).
To make it like a real chocolate eclair, slice the baked pastry in half horizontally, pour in the filling, cover with the top layer and ice the top layer.  I served 14 people with this cake.  Everybody raved about it.

A LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN ON A PLATE - the only thing to mention ~ I should have smoothed the pastry shell dough completely flat when spreading in the 13 x 9 glass pan.  I ended up with 'over the top' edges ~ the dough will form it's own 'edges'.  Otherwise followed recipe almost exactly (only added 3 eggs for the pastry shell & used semi-sweet chocolate chips in ganache) and everyone raved about my Mothers Day contribution !!

This recipe was SO easy and SO delicious!!!! My mom even asked me to make two more cakes!  This was so perfect, the pastry shell did not taste eggy at all. The filling was perfect, and not overly sweet like alot of desserts. I can't wait to make this next Christmas to bring to my in laws =)

I made this for a Christmas dessert this year (didn't try it out ahead of time).  I read a number of the other reviews and took some of those things to heart.  But I just LOVED this dessert!  It's light and flavorful.  I could have probably eaten half the pan myself that night! lol  Well worth making if you like Eclairs.  It's inspired me to make single eclairs now. :)

The pastry and filling were pretty good, however the ganache did not work for me.  Something had to have been missing.  It was a big runny mess.  Next time I will find a different ganache recipe to use.

This was REALLY terrific!  I actually used a different ganache recipe because of ingredients on hand, but this was a real crowd pleaser at our big Sunday dinner.  I also made a  homemade cooked pudding instead of using the instant packages (we have some obnoxious allergies in this house!) and I think that added as well.  

Next time I may top it with some fresh berries as well.  It was really quite rich.  

Now I have to make something with meringue to use all of these egg whites!

This was great. I loved the crust, its just like the real thing. This beats the gramcracker crusts this cake usually has.   All tho I did cheat a little.  I added 8 oz whip topping instead of heavy whipping cream.  So it would prolly be that much better with reall whipping cream.  Since i do not buy heavy cream, i used fat free sour cream in my ganache.  I used a sourcream ganache recipe from this site.  Its not my favorite ganache but i liked it with this.   Good recipe.

When I make this my husband hovers over it, guarding it like a wild animal.  He LOVES this dessert!! I didnt even know he liked eclairs--apparently he really really loves them.  But this recipe is a favorite in our house!!! The only thing I changed is I add 1/4 cup sugar to the dough.  That is what my friend does in her regular eclair recipe.  So either way its amazing!!

This was very, very good!  Our new favorite dessert, indeed.  I'd never made choux pastry before and was intrigued to try a new style of pastry.  Very easy to do, especially if you're familiar with the method for roux (cooking flour with butter for sauces and such).  Baked the pastry for about 8 minutes longer than directed and it was perfect; let it bake until even the bottom is golden brown, the sides will most certainly puff up and create the desired boat effect.  Did not add the confectioner's sugar or vanilla to the whipped cream as I knew it would be too rich for our taste buds but this was the only "change" made to the original recipe.  Be sure to fold the whipped cream into the pudding, don't just scramble-mix it together.  The ganache was perfect, especially after chilling on top of the cake overnight.  This dessert is perfect for company or just all to yourself!  We did not feel it tasted faux or plastic in any way.  UPDATE:  Made this again with vanilla and banana cream pudding together and also sprinkled sweet roasted walnuts over top of the ganache.  This brought it to an entirely new level of scrumptiousness!

I wanted to try a new recipe for Christmas dinner.  Chocolate eclairs have always been a favorite of mine, so after reading the reviews figured I would give this recipe a try.  SO GLAD I DID!!!  This dessert tastes exactly like a chocolate eclair.....it is so delicious!  Yes, it is a little time intensive, but hey - anything "fabulous" usually is.

To cut down on the number of bowls, I left the water/butter/flour mixture in the saucepan and then used my portable mixer to beat in the eggs.  I baked the batter in a round cake pan and then split it in half once it had cooled.  For those who think this recipe is too "eggy", this will allow you to scoop out some of the inards and then let the shell dry out a bit before adding the fillings. As others have suggested, I used French Vanilla pudding mix.  I couldn't find bittersweet chocolate at the grocers, so used semi-sweet.  Fresh strawberries and raspberries are in season so that made a nice garnish along with some mint leaves. Yum.

Yum!!  Made this for dessert on a Friday night for my parents and I as a special treat at the end of a long work week.  All of us absolutely loved it!! The dough came out perfect and I did not find it to be too eggy as others have suggested.  I followed the recipe for the dough and filling portions of this dessert exactly.  I used a recipe for a chocolate glaze that I have used in the past to top my regular eclairs which uses semi sweet chocolate chips, butter, milk, and corn syrup.  In the future I think I will try out the ganache the original recipe includes.  This dessert was much easier to make than the somewhat daunting looking recipe indicates.  I was expecting it to be a bit of a juggling act of bowls and utensils but in actuality with a little forethought it's quite simple.  I made this cake before I started making dinner which gave it plenty of time to chill in the fridge before serving.  Everyone found it to be an extremely decadent and tasty treat that was equally delicious the next day, too! With it only being the three of us there was plenty left over although it didn't last long in the fridge. I definitely plan to make it again, perhaps for a holiday

LOVE, LOVE this recipe!!!  The directions are great, and the recipe is very easy.  I wouldn't change a single thing, everyone loved it.  I made it for a dinner party.  I was worried about the pastry shell getting soggy, so I baked it in the morning and left it at room temperature.  I then made the pudding mixture and refrigerated it separately.  I made the ganache just before dinner and let it cool while we ate.  I put it all together just before serving.  Perfect!!  The refrigerated leftovers are not soggy.

Best eclair recipie!!!! The crust is flaky much like an eclair. The graham cracker eclair desserts are good, but, this one is better! I followed others' advise and chilled my mixing bowls and mixers. Allow ganache to cool a bit before adding. Heavenly!!!

Amazing! I don't typically review, but felt like I had to given that I swapped this recipe out from the graham cracker one that I was originally going to make. I made this for my husband to test it out before making for a dinner party, and I received rave reviews from all! My husband insists that this desert should be on hand for him to eat every week, lol. I did think that the crust was a little bit eggy, but no one else seemed to think so. I can't wait to make this again over the holidays!

This was really yummy.  Although I didn't let my ganache get thick enough, this tasted just like a chocolate eclair.  Absolutely going to keep.

This cake is so so addictive. :)
I have already made it twice in the past few months and am planning to make again this evening.
Mind you, there are only two adults and a toddler living here and this cake is still gone in a couple of days!!ha!
Its a little work and time to get this dessert done but, trust me, its well worth the wait.
Oh, and its even better the day after you make it. :)

Loved this cake. It was time consuming and hard work but so very worth it. I think I'd only make it for special occasions or if I wanted to impress guests. But, I am going to make this again and share it with my sister who loves to bake as much as I do.

This dessert is delicious and impressive to guests. I made it for a bridal shower and people were making comments as soon as they saw it that they had to have a piece. It did take a bit of time and several dishes to prepare, but was worth it for the end result. I will be making this one again! SO good!

YUM! I added an 8 oz package of cream cheese to the pudding which was sugar-free. I also did not add any extra sugar to the whipped cream.  It makes a fabulous sugar-free dessert!

It was a bit too sweet for our tastes but I used French Vanilla pudding and Enjoy Life chocolate chips for the ganache.  I plan to cut the sugar next time from both the whipped cream and the base.  We have food allergies so have to pick our ingredients carefully.
I made it again with less sugar and it was wonderful.

This recipe was as good as I'd hoped for!  I wish I could give this one more than 5 stars, it truly deserves it!   I was a bit skeptical because of the instant pudding, I try to stay away from ingredients like that to ensure a true homemade/scratch flavor.  No fake flavors in this recipe!  This was my 1st time making choux pastry, and I'm pleased to report that  it was so easy.  I really don't know why reviewers claimed that this recipe required many steps, many bowls/pans, utensils, etc.  I didn't feel that it was any more than most desserts require.  It was also a quick and simple recipe overall, IMHO.  My only change to the recipe was to use semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet due to what I had on hand.  I had no problems with "runny" chocolate, as other reviewers described.  Please note:  the filling uses "heavy whipping cream" while the ganache uses "heavy cream"...they are not the same.  I only had heavy whipping cream and no heavy cream on hand, so I used a substitute: 3/4 c. milk and 1/4 c. butter=1 c. heavy cream.  Because there are only 2 of us eating this dessert, I made 1/2 of the recipe and used an 8" x 8" pan.  It made a beautiful, thick presentation that I will be proud to serve at future dinners.  If you follow the instructions of this recipe, you will be rewarded with an awesome eclair cake that is truly delectable!  My husband loved it, so I'll be prompted to make it again and again!  ;-)
UPDATE: The second time I made this, I changed the filling fla

The chocolate topping and cream was very yummy, the crust on mine wasn’t good because it was rather thick and soggy. I know I didn’t let it cook long enough in the pot so I’ll try again.  The creamy center was absolutely delicious but there was A LOT compared to the crust and chocolate. Next time I’ll make two thinner pans rather than one

Delicious! I substituted the 2 packages of vanilla pudding with one portion of the 'pastry cream' recipe on allrecipes by Kevin Ryan. I also sprinkled medium roast coffee grounds before I poured the chocolate sauce on top. It is the best cake ever and holds its shape even when cutting and serving. It was a huge hit! Thank you. (Requires 5 stars with these little changes)

I made this for book club and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  Some commented that they liked it because it wasn't too sweet.
I'm not sure if I did something wrong with the ganache, but I thought it wouldn't be so runny and harden more quickly.  It tasted yummy though.  I would definitely make it again.

I usually make Moon Cake from Allrecipes as it is my son's favourite dessert, I decided to try this recipe for a change and it did not disappoint! It was very delicious and came together fast. For mixing the choux paste I do not use a mixer, I was taught to use a wooden spoon and mix the eggs right in the pot, you do need to mix throughly, about a minute each time until the paste is smooth. I had some homemade dark chocolate fudge sauce in the fridge which I used instead of the ganache because I thought I had semi sweet chocolate but it was unsweetened. This is a fancy dessert that is good for company or a crowd.

This is sooo good! If you like éclairs, you will love this easy to make yet delicious recipe. The pastry is a perfect compliment to the creamy filling and chocolate ganache. I decorated mine with chocolate covered strawberries as it was Valentine's which added some festive red color. I also made them individually for a party and they worked great for that also! Will make again, thanks!

This is very good! There is more than enough filling for the crust using the recommended pan size.  The next time I might try using sweetened chocolate chips vs. the 60% cacao bittersweet chips that I used this time.

It was great, would make again. I used 2 oreo pudding packages instead of vanilla they were a bit bigger 4.2oz vs 3.5oz. But it turned out great!

This was a hit for our Mother's Day family party! I made the filling with the Pastry Cream recipe on here, once it was soft set I folded the whipped cream into it as you would with the pudding mix. I have already given a copy of the recipes to other family members and it is on the list of favorites for everyone!

This was such a fun recipe! Yes, it does take a tons of bowls and utensils to make it, but that is to be expected with something like this. It is also time consuming, but WELL worth it. My husband said that he wanted what his mother always made him for his birthday, which was chocolate eclair cake, but all of the recipes that called for graham cracker just didn't fly with me. It was also an accident when I made this one without realizing that it wasn't exactly what he wanted. However, HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! He also said that I have replaced his mother's cake. Now I have to make this for him every year (and send the leftovers with him to work--so many calories!).

As someone else had suggested, I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips instead, and it made making the genache so much easier.

Everyone loved it! I made it exactly as written and it was perfect. When you are adding the eggs to the dough make sure that you really incorporate the ingredients because mine looked lumpy, just really get that mixer in there so that everything is fully blended together.. I used unsalted butter (as you should with most desserts), whole milk, and quality chocolate. This is a keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly. When I checked the crust in the oven it had puffed, but not in a boat, more like mountains. It did come back down when it cooled, but ended up with some more puff at the ends then in the middle. Also struggled to create a side crust. Might try it again and just have the crust on the bottom. My guests loved the dessert. I froze the left overs and found it was just as delicious frozen as not, so will make again for a summer dessert. Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone in my family thought the crust was terrible. (It was hard and chewy). I've made cream puffs before, and they turned out great, so I'm not sure what happened. The top was great, but it is hard to go wrong with whipped cream and pudding.

This was delicious. I was taken back a bit with the 'hard' work put into the recipe only to have pudding added. But i followed to the letter and you can't argue with the results. You could cut corners and buy the pastry sheet and use tub whip topping. But don't use tub frosting you must do the ganache.

Everything went together perfectly.  My suggestion to get the perfect consistently for the ganache is to refrigerate for 45 minutes whisking every 15 minutes and then spreading on the cake. Perfect!

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and my husband absolutely loved it! He said it was the best dessert I've made by far and he's not a fan of sweets. I had trouble with the ganache, but it was entirely my fault I used whipping cream instead of heavy cream which the recipe called for resulting in a runny chocolate mess. We still loved it! I will definitely make it again.

Yes, the shell was outstanding and the filling was pretty good, but I felt the bittersweet chocolate detracted.  I wonder if milk chocolate ganache would taste better.  Also, I whipped to stiff peaks, but still the cream filling was a little runny.

Made this for work. Was perfect! Wouldn't use a 9x13 pan though, kinda weird for a Boston cream pie- maybe next time I'll try to make the recipe smaller to fit into a pie pan. All around great!!!

The filling was good.  But, I have made similar  recipes that were much simpler.  For instance, instead of making fresh whipped cream, use store bought (then you can choose a lighter version).  Also, for the crust it was very doughy and eggy tasting.  I did only use 3 eggs instead of 4 like other reviews suggested.  If I make again, I would use just a flower/ butter mixture for a simple crust that is gives you more of that crust texture and use store bought whipped topping.  Our friends liked it though and one went back for seconds.
