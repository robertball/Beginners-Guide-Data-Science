I have a Zojirushi 2 lb loaf bread machine. I adjusted this recipe as follows: 1 1/4 cup water,1 1/2 tbls. butter/marg, 3/4 tsp salt, 2 cups bread flour, 1 1/4 cups whole wheat bran flour, 2 tsp. Red Star Active Dry Yeast.  I eliminated the sugar, and left the honey, coffee and cocoa powder the same as original recipe.  I also added 1 tsp. gluten flour.  The bread came out perfect......it rose right up to the top of bread pan.  I used basic bread/medium crust setting.

LET ME STATE TWO THINGS FROM THE GET GO: I didn't think about measuring out the yeast, I just automatically added the whole packet and I do not own a bread machine. I made this bread with my Kitchen Aid from beginning to end. I warmed the honey with the water to very warm, not hot. (Boiling water will kill your yeast.) I dissolved the coffee in the warm honey water, then added it to the yeast in the mixer bowl and let it proof for ten minutes. After that, I added the melted butter, then the rest of the ingredients. I needed about a 1/4 c. of extra whole wheat flour to get the dough together enough to pull together and jump on the hook. I greased up the dough just a bit with a little of the butter from the bowl I melted the butter in, then set it to knead with the hook for five minutes. I let it rise in a greased metal bowl on my warm oven for an hour, then shaped it into a loaf and set it to rise in the loaf pan for another hour and a half, or until it almost rose above the loaf pan. I baked it at 350* for about 25 minutes, or until it smelled done. This is a nice whole wheat loaf with a distinctive flavor that is really like nothing I've ever had before. Just outstanding. Fluffy and rich tasting, almost like a bakery bread. This would be great with a nice hearty stew. I'd make this again. NOTE: Make sure your loaf pan is well greased. I had a difficult time getting this particular bread out of my pan.

I have never used a Bread Machine before or even made Homeade bread from scratch. Even after reading the bad reviews, I made this bread on my first attempt. I went by rkplucker advice and put it for 1 1/2 loaf. When I kept peeking in, it did look "gooey", up until the last hour. Then it came out great! It tastes great too! I made this again for my 3rd loaf and plan on making this all the time.

This is my new favorite bread!!!! I make bread at least twice a week. I haven't bought "store" bread in a long time because my kids won't eat it! We love homemade bread & this is a new favorite! I only use the dough cycle though.  I doubled this recipe for my 2-lb machine and used the dough cycle. When it was complete I took it out and formed it into balls. I got 24 balls from this doubled recipe. These make great sandwich buns or dinner rolls. This bread rose VERY nicely and wasn't sticky AT ALL. You MUST use bread flour and NOT all purpose white flour. If you choose to use the dough cycle and then bake it on your own as I do - just form the balls and put out on 2 sprayed cookie sheets, cover with plastic wrap and let rise another 30 mins or until doubled in size and then remove wrap carefully & bake at 325 for 15 - 20 mins. (Depends on your oven.) If you use typical loaf pans then extend baking time to about 20 - 30 mins. You could also try mini loaf pans! DELISH!!

This really is like steak-house bread!  Mine wasn't goopy as other reviews say, it was perfect. Infact I took the bread out 10 min. early.  Didn't have instant coffee, so used left over AM coffee instead of the water asked for.  Also added a little extra honey for a totally sweet bread.

I thought this bread was delicious.  The batter was kinda wet and next time I will use about a tablespoon less water.  The loaf sank a little in the middle but the bread was so good.

This recipe is the best.  Warm or room temp, the bread has a great flavor and texture.  It freezes well also.

This recipe was the bomb!!!  So delicious!  My kids said it wasn't exactly like the steakhouse bread, it was better!  I used my machine to make the dough, then I made mini-loaves in my PC mini-loaf pan.  I had to wait for about 1 1/2 hours for the loaves to rise (colder environment, maybe.)  Then I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Making them again tomorrow!  Trying rolls this time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe didn't work at all! It doesn't say what size loaf - so I guessed in the middle at 1 1/2 lbs. It just made a big gooey mess!  A complete waste of ingredients and $$.

Served warm is spot-on delicious.  I increased all ingred by 1/3 to make 9x5 loaf..  The recipe calls for 2 c flour total, and 3 c flour is standard for a 9x5 loaf.  

Loaf rose great (pic uploaded to this recipe's page).  The taste is right on the money, and the texture is wonderfully soft and like mini-loaves in steakhouse.

Made this by hand, as I do all bread.  If you haven't read process on other bread reviews, here's how:  

Warm a small bowl, put 95-110 degree F water in bowl.  Immediately put yeast in water, stir together.  If yeast clumps break clumps apart w/ fingers, let mix sit 8-10 min to activate yeast.  

Meanwhile, put flour  in lrg bowl.  When yeast ready pour into flour and let yeast-mix & flour only get acquainted 3-5 min.  Then add all oth ingred into bowl.  Spray spatula w/ cooking spray, blend all ingred together well.  Pour dough onto lightly floured surface, knead 8-10 min.  Clean lrg bowl, grease w/ butter or ckng spray.  Put dough in.  

Zap empty micro 3 min.  Put ktchn towel over bowl, put in warmed micro til doubles in size.  Take out, punch dough to deflate, let sit 4-5 min.  Knead on floured surface again, shape into size of bottom of a 9x5 loaf pan.  Put in loaf pan, zap empty micro 3 min, put loaf in warmed micro (no towel over it this time), let rise til large but not spilling.  Bake 350F 25 min.  Remv fr oven, cool in pan 10 min, remv fr pan & cool compltly on wire rack.

If dough doesn't rise, water was too hot or cold or yeast too old.

Wow, this bread is really good!  It's probably the best that's ever come out of my bread machine.  But the original poster really needs to modify the recipe because as many people have mentioned, the dough is way too wet.  I ended up adding an extra 1-2 Tbsp. of flour to get it to the consistency it should have been.  That said, any bread machine user who's read the machine's directions should know that you don't just dump all the ingredients in the pan and walk away.  A careful baker will watch the dough as it's being kneaded and make liquid or flour adjustments as necessary.  To the people who said this bread was weird or bitter tasting I suggest you check the quality of your ingredients.  I used pure unsweetened cocoa powder and a coffee substitute I get from the health food store.  There was no weird or bitter taste at all.  True, the bread is a little sweet but no where near as sweet as  dessert.  The people who said it was too sweet either don't like sweet at all or maybe they used sweetened cocoa powder or chocolate milk powder or something.  Fantastic bread.  Thanks for posting.

Holy smokes this is terrific bread! Don't let the thought of coffee scare you away from this bread. My husband hates coffee but loved this bread. A few tips:  * Use unsalted butter * For machines that are 2 lbs + (like mine), scale recipe to 10 servings and set bread machine cycle for a 2 lb. loaf and I used the med crust. The bread comes out perfect!

The taste was pretty good but not what I had expected.  This did not work in my bread machine so I tried it again and pulled it out after the dough mixed and baked it in a loaf pan.  It's ok but not great tried it again and still doesn't work in the machine so won't be making it again.  Gave it two stars for working 1 out of 3 times.

I did a lot of what teadrinker did to adjust the recipe for a 2lb loaf:  1 1/4 cup water, 3/4 tsp salt, 2 cups bread flour, 1 1/4 cups whole wheat  flour, 2 tsp yeast. I left the honey, sugar, and cocoa powder the same as original recipe.
I did not have any coffee, so left it out.  This was wonderful!  It cut nicely, rose to the top of the pan, and was heavy without being a brick.  The what flour was freshly ground right before I made the bread and I have noticed that ww flour makes loaves quite a bit heavier.  This was still good.  It was slightly sweet, but not cloying.  All we did to it was spread fresh butter on top.  There was only a bit left this morning.

Best bread I've made yet. I don't understand the folks who are complaining about "what size loaf" and under or overbaking. The recipe is specifically for a bread machine, which takes all that guesswork out. The only change I made was eliminating the white sugar (I figured a 1/4 cup of honey was quite enough sweetness, and I was right!). If you put everything in a bread machine like it says, it comes out wonderful. I too thought it was very sticky-looking, but I didn't mess around with it and it ended up being my new favorite.

I thought the flavor on this was truly great.  As for the texture, I found this to be helpful: I made the dough in the bread machine (as written it was just too small to bake in my Zoj)... I pulled the dough out with floured hands and formed it into two loaves on parchment paper, placed on my baking sheet.  I gave it an ADDITIONAL 30-60 min rise and baked at 325 for 18-24 min.

I tried this recipe today and it came out really tasty. I add one large egg since lecithin in egg yolk is a natural dough conditioner. I also add  1.5 Tablespoon of  wheat glueten. 
I change the servings to 12. I use 1/3 cup of strong brew coffee instead of instant coffee. replace the water to 2/3 cup plus 2 table spoon milk . I used 1.5 cup all purpose flour and 1.5 cup  white 100% whole wheat flour.  I omit the salt. I add the white sugar as well and I am glad I did. you could taste a little bit of  the dought  so see if you like the sweetness and adjust according to your taste. I also add chopped walnut for more nutrients

great recipe. 

only problem i had was with the honey. i buy locally made and my supplier has only light honey and it has a bad after taste (all light honey i've tried has the same after taste). i prefer the dark, but his bees didn't collect any for the last few years.

i my try corn syrup or molasses next time.

I just made this and am very happy with the results.  I made a couple of changes, though.  One was minor--not having any bread machine yeast, I used 2 tsp of active dry yeast instead.    And also, after reading that a number of people had problems with the recipe not working for them, I checked the dough several times during the second knead cycle and added more flour, one tablespoon at a time (alternating between wheat and white) until it looked less sticky and more like bread dough.  I didn't go crazy with the extra flour since it sounded as though it was supposed to be a fairly wet dough, but enough that it looked like dough rather than batter.  It came out wonderfully.

I have made this bread half a dozen times and it never rises. I started to get so frustrated b/c the flavor was great, but it was a moist hockey puke. I found a blog about bread making and read over what some of the issues could have been. Today i tried again. I proofed my yeast with water and sugar first, to make sure the yeast was good. Which is was.  Then I mixed all the dry ingredients together, and added them to the proofed yeast. I topped it with the butter and honey. I put it int he bread machine and let it go through one kneading cycle. My machine does two for some reasons. I don't think this bread was liking that second kneading. Lastly, I warmed the cup of water in the microwave to make a nice warm humid environment and let the bread rise in there for a few hours. Yes, it finally rose. I baked it in the oven 350 for 20 min and it was perfect! So, anyone who was having rising issues, this is what I did. Hope it helps you!

We just toasted some of this dark and dense bread for breakfast this morning, and it has a really good flavor.  I used the measurements as written, but used my homebrewed Starbucks French roast coffee in place of water/instant coffee.  Next time I think I would change the measurements to 1 1/2 for the one loaf (it's a little small), and I would try adding vital wheat gluten to help the rise.  Unique flavor.  Thank you.

YUM!  i decided to replace the honey with molasses and used coffee in place of the water.  this produced a nice small loaf, perfect for two people.  i loved this bread and i will make again.

I'm not a pro at the breadmaker or anything, but I have had perfect success with this recipe. I'm not sure what caused the problems that others reported. The dough is soft as stated but once it rises and bakes it has a perfect consistency and the flavor is great! My family loves it so much that I make it 2-3 times per week now. I premix all the dry ingredients in ziplock bags so when it's time to make another, it's a snap. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I thought it was great!  Very similar to the Steakhouse bread the author referred to.  The whole family loved it.  I have an Oster bread machine, and everything worked just fine with the default settings.

I tried this recipe, once in the bread machine, once by hand. Gloppy mess both times. Loaf in the bread machine turned out close to 3 inches long. I bake bread 3 times a week, so I know what I'm doing. Won't make this again, waste of ingredients.

This was PERFECT. Exactly what I wanted it to be. Like another reviewer, I noticed that it didn't rise like I thought it would, but it baked up nicely.

Very good just as written.  Note:  if you add 3 tablespoons of soy flour to the measuring cup before adding the bread flour, the baked bread will stay fresh longer (this also adds extra nutrition).  However, soy flour smells funny, so don't be alarmed.  Once baked, it will smell delicious just like bread should.

Wonderful!! My bread machine just arrived today and this was the second recipe I tried. The only change I made was to substitute cold coffee for part of the liquid because I didn't have any instant coffee. This was delicious and came out perfectly in my one pound bread machine.

Really good sweet dark bread, the coffee and chocolate undertones are wonderful.  I made this with my bread maker, aka 'my new best friend'.  I weigh out all my flours when making bread.  This may be why some people report problems with bread recipies.  You can convert recipies to metric at the servings tab on top of the recipe and then use a kitchen scale to help get the correct amounts of flour.  Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG this recipe is awesome!   I havent made any bread in my machine in i know 5 yrs.  put the ingredients in... set it at 1lb loaf light crust... voila!  the most awesome bread!  what depth of flavor and i wouldve never guessed what it was that gave it such good flavor!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe! Ok note...also... i tried to double this recipe ... I have a 2 lb bread machine... and boiled over and what a mess... if you have a 2 lbs machine, dont double it!    fix it 1 lb at a time!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out really well!  Good texture and flavor, as others have mentioned.  I was suspicious at first due to the instant coffee and cocoa in the list of ingredients, but I added them and was really pleased with the end result.  I will be using this recipe again!

Used 3/4 c leftover coffee instead of the water and instant coffee granules.

Proofed the yeast with the warmed wet ingredients before adding to bread machine.

Omitted the sugar. 

Made several small loaves (oiled rectangular ramikins) for gifts.

So yummy! I didn't have the coco powder so I left it out, and I just threw in weak coffee in place of the water and instant coffee. So good, great chewy texture.

Delicious!  I've only eaten at a fancy restaurant a couple times, but I'm pretty sure this is what they feed you so you don't notice the portions are so small for the rest of the meal!  (KIDDING!) This is delicious bread.

Based on some of the previous reviews I guessed the original recipe was for a 1lb loaf.  I modified from 8 to 12 servings to make a 1.5lb loaf for my bread machine and it came out perfectly!  Extremely similar to our "nameless" steak house restaurant, the entire family loved! 

I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews but figured 
I'd give it a try.  I truly just dumped everything into the breakmaker based on the original recipe and walked away.  It was perfect.

This was my first attempt at "homemade" bread. The flavor was yummy however I don't think I selected the right setting on my bread machine due to the lack of information in the instructions..so the flavor is good but the instructions..not so much. Especially for the inexperienced bread maker like myself. Will try again

I really liked this recipe. I followed it as written, save for using regular coffee instead of instant. It came out nicely & I like that the poster noted to use the regular, light settings when making this. The flavor is unique and the type of bread that makes you feel warm inside when you eat it. We served it with beef over pasta, garden salad & homemade lime aid. Great stuff!!!

I have made this a few times now... The first couple of times it was kind of hard, but I used a different bread machine last night and OH MY GOD!!!!!!! Texture, taste, everything perfect!!!! Tasted just like Longhorn's!!! Served with a potato bake casserole that I made up and a salad. Definitely using that same breadmaker for this recipe EVERY TIME!

I have a Zojirushi Bread Machine and I copy the recipe that teadrinker adjusted, and I must say that I was very happy with my results.  The bread came out just right.  The taste was great.  This will be one of my main breads.

YUM!  The only thing I changed was that I used  3/4 cup brewed coffee in place of the 3/4 cup water and instant coffee.  I didn't have any instant to dissolve when I made this so I just did it that way and it was perfect!

This bread is exactly what I hoped for.  It is just like the bread we get at our local steakhouse. I used this recipe exactly as written.  NOTE: your machine will need to be set for 1lb loaf and light crust.

Excellent recipe!  I made no changes to this 1 lb. recipe and my husband and I loved it!  Very easy, moist and yummy!  Next time I'll modify it for my 1.5 lb. bread machine and it will be my "go to" recipe for whole wheat bread.

Made this bread tonight and it's divine!!!  The whole loaf will likely be gone  before the night ends.  There is only one slice left.    I didn't make this in the bread machine because my machine consistently causes bread to collapse.  I made the dough in it.  When done, I kneaded it on a floured surface a few times then put it in a well-greased bread pan (standard size).  I put it in the oven that was preheated (200 deg for 5 minutes and then turned off) to let it rise.  Then when it had risen enough, I baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes.  It probably should have baked just a tad longer (maybe 5 more minutes) - could be due to having it in there during the preheat process.  The bread was tasty and soft.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I doubled the recipe and set my Sunbeam bread maker on 2lb loaf; it worked great.  It was not exactly like Outback's bread, but it was close.  Me and my family enjoyed it and I'll make it again.

I first tried this recipe as is, and found that it did not rise nicely in my bread machine (but it had a great flavor).  I doubled the recipe, put it on the dough cycle in the bread machine, and made 6 mini loaves (I let them rise in the pans for about 40 minutes), and baked in the oven.  3 of the loaves were eaten immediately--GREAT bread!

I did a little changing to this recipe and it came out perfect. 3/4 cup morning coffee, 3/4 cup chocolate milk, 2 tbs. butter, 1/2 cup honey, 2 tbs. sugar, 1-1/2 cup bread flour, 1-1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 2 tsp. bread machine yeast. I set my bread machine to 1-1/2 pound loaf and light crust.

I served this bread with BBQ ribs and it was perfect!  Everyone said it tasted like the bread they serve at Outback.  The outside got a little dark (I cooked it in the bread machine as a 1.5 lb loaf).  I just shaved that off with a bread knife and no one knew it.

wow - this was excellent.  I upped the recipe to 2 lbs as per the reviews.  also I started with the honey, water, yeast and sugar in the bread pan, let that sit for about 10 minutes, then added the other ingredients. it was light & delicious.  best thing to ever come out of my breadmaker, that's for sure!!

Oh!  My!  GAWWD!  This bread is AWESOME!!!  My yeast wasn't very active anymore so it didn't raise to it's full potential and was a bit hard crusted, but I think that just added texture!  The hubby, the kids.....we ALL loved it!  Thank you soooo much for sharing!!!

Turned out well even in my 2-2.5lb bread machine.  I skimped on the honey, but I won't do that next time.  Dense and chewy, just like the restaurant versions.

My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bread!  It includes our two favorite things- CHOCOLATE AND COFFEE! I have made this recipe 5 times now this week. I don't keep bread machine yeast on hand usually, so I used 2tsp (4tsp for a double batch) of red star dry active yeast.  The bread rose just fine. I didn't let it go full cycle in my bread machine; I used the dough cycle.  Everytime I made it, it did need more flour in the mixing phase, unfortunately a little different amounts everytime.  I don't mind the extra step.  I took the dough out and cut it into 10 sections (20 for a double batch) and use my hand to roll them into balls.  I put them on sprayed baking sheets (i have also used the pizza pan since a didn't have enough room for the double batch), let them rise for half an hour to an hour, and baked them at 325 degrees for 20 minutes. They are perfect!  My husband and I take them for breakfast with honey butter (I got the recipe off of this site too). I'm a teacher for special needs and behavior management children and I took them for our staff in-service day yesterday with the honey butter (we all bring a breakfast item to share) and they were gone within 15 minutes!  Thanks so mumch for the recipe!  Definately a keeper!

This was a great/simple recipe. I adjusted the recipe to make a 1.5 lb loaf and sat the bread machine on light crust.  Time the bread to where you take it out right at dinner time, otherwise it'll never last until then.

This is going to be my new wheat bread recipe. The only change I made was to use coffee instead of water/instant coffee and I made the dough in the bread machine and finished it in the oven- 350 for 30 minutes. So good!

I don't have a bread machine, so I used my stand mixer.  I proofed my yeast in 1/4 cup of water and 1 tbs brown sugar, then added the butter and 1/2 cup very strong coffee and the honey.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of AP and 2 tsp vital wheat gluten with the salt and cocoa powder.  The dough was very soft so I kneaded in about 3/4 cup more flour to achieve a well kneaded dough.  I allowed it to rise until doubled, about 45 minutes, formed my loaf and allowed to rise again about 45 minutes and baked at 375 for about 30 minutes in a well greased, glass loaf pan.  I will make it again sometime when it isn't so humid to see how much of a difference that made.  All in all it tastes good, toasts well and I had no complaints from my tasters. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is excellent!  I used all bread flour (no ww flour in my pantry).  The flavor and texture is perfect.  I will make this again and again!  I, too, used hot coffee for the water instead of the instant coffee.  Used one package of regular yeast.  YUMMM

I enjoyed this recipe. I used the whole wheat setting on my bread machine and increased the yeast to 2 teaspoons of active dry yeast because I did not have bread machine yeast. When it was kneading, I added a handful more of bread flour, because it did seem a little moist, but it turned out great. I used the setting for a 1 pound loaf.

I'm working my way through all of the bread machine recipes on this site in search of the best. I made this just as directed, except I used brewed coffee in place of the instant coffee and water. Turned out perfect with a moist dense texture and slightly sweet flavor. Great for ham sandwiches!

This was great bread!  I made it according to the recipe, but began to worry because the dough did not rise like most do in my bread machine (I make bread several times a week).  So I took it out after the first rise, and formed a loaf in a regular loaf pan, then let it rise in a warm spot for over an hour.  Baked at 350 for about 30 minutes and it was perfect.  This IS dense, but that was what I wanted!  I could taste the coffee in it, though, it gave it a tiny bit of a bitter twang, so next time I will leave that out.

Okay, this recipe is a-ma-zing!  I did add a little bit of molasses for flavor/color.  Topped the bread with a simple honey butter.  Wow!

This is the perfect bread for ham sandwiches!  Can't think of a better bread to pair with some good mustard!  I always double this recipe to make a full loaf.  The yeast always seem to be the confusing part to me--usually the recipe says one temperature/type, the yeast packet suggest a different water temperature and the bread machine suggests its own temp/type.  In experimenting with this recipe, I've found that I get the best results when I follow the temp/type of yeast recommended by the bread machine.  In this case, rapid rise bread machine yeast and *chilled* 40F water.  I've played with this recipe a bit and found if I substitute some of the sugar for molasses, it gives the bread a very nice flavor.  Adding a hit of cheap vanilla also had nice results.  Some day, I want to try adding some instant oatmeal into the party as well.  All and all, this bread is a regular for us and I'd be hard pressed to switch to a competing whole-wheat recipe!

Excellent! Loved this bread. I took it out of the machine and formed it into a round on a cookie sheet, let it rise, and baked in the oven. Mmmm... the coffee and cocoa make this bread amazing! Thanks!

Excellent recipe, but makes very small loaf. Next time will reduce amt of cocoa, double recipe, increase cooking time slightly.  I used 1 lb loaf time; 1.5 lb would be better.

I suspect there's such a night-and-day difference between people who have a great experience and people who don't because those who don't might not be using the right ingredients. Like you can't just substitute all-purpose flour for the bread flour. Bread flour is more robust, so it won't be as "gooey" as some are claiming the dough is. I followed the recipe to a T, and it came out great the first time. And it's delicious.

I used the bread machine to make the dough, but baked it in the oven.  I make bread at least once a week and have never had a bread recipe that I had to add so much additional flour.  I ended up adding both an extra half cup of wheat and regular flour.  The bread tasted good, so will probably make it again.

This is sooooo yummy!  My only question is: can I double the batch to make a bigger loaf? I  know my breadmachine pan can handle it, but will it change the consistency or anything?  Any help is appreciated!

This was my first foray into using a bread machine that I got with no directions.  I put it in as a 1.5, and the bread came out perfectly, albeit slightly dark-crusted.  I am going to try it again right now, and see if there is a different setting for lighter crust. It wasn't at all goopy as previously described.  In fact, the bread had a perfect density.  I will be adding more honey, cocoa and coffee this time around, as I would prefer a sweeter, more flavorful loaf.  :)

Yummmmmmmmmm!  Here's the deal.  Opted to use KA instead of bread machine ... had to add apx 1/4 cup of flour to turn into manageable dough (still VERY soft and sticky). Let rise for an hour, punched - weighed in at 18oz ball - then shaped into 6 3oz *mini loaves*.  Snipped tops of those and let rise for 45 minutes then baked at 325 for 18-20 minutes.  Wonderfully soft with light slightly chewy center.  There's juuuuuust enough sweetness in the loaves to make you running back for more (and more...and more).  Seriously - I had to make myself stay away from them.  Would be great with a honey-butter.  Pain in the butt to make this way ... but well worth the effort.

I followed the directions exactly, and I make 3-4 loaves of bread a week for my family, but this loaf did not turn out like it should have. It was too dry, so I added some warm water. When the dough felt perfect, I kneaded it and let it rise. It did not rise up like my other loaves, and after baking it the bread turned out like a loaf of banana bread rather than a loaf of wheat. I will not make it again. I did not want to rate it 1 star, but that is what I felt it deserved.

I made this bread yesterday and followed the ingredients as close as possible.  The only thing I changed was replacing my water with regular drip coffee as another user suggested because I didn't have instant.  It's hard to say if this changed anything, but instant coffee just isn't something we keep on hand.  It turned out great and I'm honestly perplexed by all the reviews that describe the dough as gloppy or too wet because my dough was not like that at all.  I'm glad I didn't cut back on the liquid - it would have been too dry!  Anyway, it turned out great!  I had a slice with dinner and my husband polished off the entire loaf in the course of the evening so I will be making 2 loaves of this bread today.  :-)

Wonderful recipe and very easy - we will make this again and again. I have a cusinart convection bread maker and this recipe made a perfect 1lb loaf, light crust white bread setting. After looking at the reviews I too used 3/4 cup brewed coffee instead of the water and the instant coffee (since I don't have instant coffee). That worked well. I used 1.5t of yeast instead of 1.25 and the rise was perfect. As others have said, at moments throughout the process I thought the dough was a bit wet. However it bakes up to a nice, soft flavorful bread. Only caution is that even on the light crust setting the bottom of the loaf started to get a bit dark. I pulled it out of the bread machine about 7 minutes early.

I hadn't made bread in my bread machine for several years.  I was a little worried, but it turned out fantastic.  I did add some flour a little at a time (I used all-purpose) to get it to the right consistency.  Yes, it was 'goopy' before balancing out the flour.  It rose nicely.  I set it on the normal setting and light crust.  I also added some ground flax seed for extra nutrition.  The flavor is awesome.  The danger is that I want to eat the whole thing myself!   The size of the loaf is larger than I anticipated.

Tried it first time...there wasn't enough so I have adjusted the recipe for 12 servings!  I make this regularly now and tend to use leftover brewed (regular) coffee in place of the water and coffee granules. Top with honey butter as soon as it is done....YUM!

Just took this out of the bread maker. I am very happy with the results. Didn't know how it would taste with cocoa and coffee, however it is very good. Next time I will omit the sugar as I find it a bit too sweet. The sweetness is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

My son that loves bread said this was really good.  I think there was a tad bit too much cocoa, but it was very moist and delicious. I'll try this as a base for my pumpkin french toast and see how that turns out.  Thanks!

The best bread ever!  A slightly sweet taste, but it does taste like what they have at a restaurant.  Since I have a larger bread machine, the next time I make it, I will double the recipe. SO GOOD!

Good, I don't have a bread machine so I made by hand but it turned out well.  I doubled the brown sugar but still felt the molasses taste came through a lot.  Didn't notice the coffee flavor but it was pretty weak.  Baked on a pizza stone and it makes a very big loaf!  I don't know that I'll go through the 5 lb bag of rye flour I bought though!  Hopefully it freezes well...

This is delicious; not as sweet as I expected, but that can be tweaked.  I made this recipe using the bread machine but took the dough out before it rose for the last time, rolling smaller loaves and making the bread in mini loaf pans.

I made this bread last night for a birthday dinner.  After getting all the ingredients mixed I got to the point in the recipe where it doesn't tell you the size of the loaf!  I set it for a small loaf however after reading the reviews I pulled the dough out at the end of cycle and baked in two small loaf pans.  I let it rise (30 to 45 mins) and baked at 350 degrees for about 20 to 30 mins.  The result was 2 perfect loaves. We ate one loaf for dinner that night warm out of the oven and I had a couple slices for breakfast the next morning from the second loaf.  I did not care for this bread warm out of the oven (go figure), the flavor was weird.  Like other reviews I could taste the wheat, coffee, cocoa etc. However, the next morning it was great, the flavors seemed to blend.  I will make this a day early next time...much better.

We LOVE this recipe and make it often -- it's perfect as is.  We have made it with white flour and it tastes great as well.  

Works great in the bread machine on 1lb loaf setting.  If I make it on the 1.5lb loaf setting, I usually just watch it and take it out 10-15 minutes early so the crust doesn't burn.

This is the best bread I've every made in my machine.  It does make a small loaf, so you'll want to set it to a 1 of 1.5 lb loaf.  Also, I didn't have instant coffee, just regular, so I added 1/2 t. ground coffee.  More honey might be a nice addition too.  I also took out about 10 minutes early and it was perfect!

This turned out perfectly!  I didn't have instant coffee so I left that out but the bread still tasted great.  Because of some of the comments about the dough being too wet,  I kept an eye on the dough when in the "knead" cycle and added about two tablespoons more of flour.  I set it for the 1 pound loaf.

This was good, very similar to Outback. It did over bake a bit in my bread machine.  Next time, I will take out a few minutes early.

when I looked in the machine and saw how small the loaf was I was skeptical....but when it was done I became a firm believer.  This recipe is outstanding.  The texture of this bread is just like they say...crisp outer crust and warm soft deliciousness inside.  It was almost gone in 15 minutes from the oven.  Sooo Good.  I could make this every day and I just might.

This bread is wonderful!  I have made this nearly every other day because my family loves it so much.  The only change I made was to use butter flavored shortening rather than the butter (only because it was what I had on hand).  This is so easy to make and the end result is great.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I will be making this over and over!

Can I say YUM!!!  I was looking to make rolls so I used the dough setting of my bread machine and doubled the recipe.  I left out the sugar because I did not want an overly sweet bread, added 1/4 cup of wheat flour (after reading reviews saying the dough was wet-I wanted to be able to roll it out and cut with a biscut cutter. I don't know that the extra flour was needed though.) and I added 2T vital wheat gluten. I rolled the dough out, cut with a small biscut cutter and sprinkled rolled oats on the top before covering them with oiled plastic wrap and letting rise for 1hr. I baked the rolls at 350 for 20min.  They came out PERFECT!  They are slightly sweet without tasting like a dessert bread and rich due to the coffee and cocoa.  Good chewy texture.  I'll try leaving out the extra flour next time-as I will be making these again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made the copycat version of outbacks mini loaves for years and have loved them!  I saw this one here and noticed that it was the same ingredients, but for a bread machine, so I had to try it!  This recipe does make a very small 1 lb loaf.  My bread machine only does 1.5 lb as the smallest loaf size, so next time I will double this recipe for my bread machine to get a more consistent result.  I do have to say this came out a little dense and wasnt as good as the mini loaves that I make.  But I do think that could of been because the dough was too wet.  I know in the other recipe, for the mini loaves, the dough is very very sticky and they turn out fine.  So I figured that I would leave this one alone and see if it would give me the same result in the bread machine.  It didnt, so next time I will for sure add a little more flour to get it the right stickiness.  Overall though, it was very close to the copycat mini loaf recipe.  I cant wait to try it again with those alterations to see how good it turns out!  Thanks for the recipe!

My third loaf is in the machine as I type this. This is a WONDERFUL recipe! It doesn't keep as long as some others I've made, but that's okay because it's usually been devoured by day 2. ;)  Settings: light crust and 1.5# loaf. I did cut the yeast down to 1 tsp for my second loaf and the bread was slightly more dense, but tasted the same. This bread is wonderful with homemade honey butter, or just straight honey as a topping.  Thanks so much for listing it! It's my current fave. :)

I didn't have any honey left over so I substituted 1/4 cup of molasses + 1 extra tablespoon of white sugar for the 1/4 cup of honey. I was worried it wasn't going to rise enough or even cook all the way through, but it turned out wonderfully!   This really does make a wonderful dinner bread or even a stand alone bread. Doesn't even need butter!

The bread was moist, but all you could taste was coffee and chocolate and a burnt taste on the crust.  Will not make this one again.

An excellent recipe.  I changed a couple of things - swopped butter for a healthier option of Canola oil as my hubby is reducing his cholesterol & fat intake & upped the honey to half cup as we prefer a sweeter loaf ~ simply delicious with a chicken & lentil stew for dinner & doubles up as dessert with coffee or at breakfast with coffee.  This recipe makes a 1 pound loaf (453gram) & my Kenwood bread maker has a minimum setting of 550g about 1.5 pound loaf, & tho the shape of the loaf didn't turn out as nice as it shud have with sufficient dough mixture - it had a luvly crust & the interior of the bread was a nice soft dense texture, just fabulous!  I will double the amount on my next bake.

Too small for my bread machine, which can make a 1.5 or 2lb loaf. Dough was very spread out  therefore loaf was short and wide. I would like to try this recipe by hand, I believe it will turn out a little bit better.

Delicious!  Tastes wonderful and came out perfect from bread machine.  I changed the servings to 12 as kbsteen suggested (thanks!) for a 1 1/2 pound loaf, followed exactly, selected wheat and light crust setting, was perfect and slipped right out of pan when done.  The dough feels a little sticky at first, but after first rise is better.  Thanks for the great recipe, definitely a keeper!

i absolutely loved this recipe!! I used my kitchen aid and it did a fantastic job. had to add a little more flour to get the dough the right consistancy. if you're making this with a kitchen aid or by hand and the dough is not rising-try sitting the bowl on top of warm oven. works great!!

I made a 1-1/2 pound load by changing the servings to 12 and following the recipe.  Excellent, robust bread that baked up perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I've made this twice once with molasses (was out of honey) and once as written with  honey.  Like the honey version best.  Be sure to check at 5 minutes to adjust the liquid or flour.  I think there is about 2 or 3 TBS too much liquid in the recipe as written.  Makes great ham sandwiches.

This recipe is a KEEPER for sure.  It is so tasty.  I even froze it after I baked it and it keeps it flavor intact.  My husband will not eat wheat bread, but when I made this and asked him to try it, he loved it.  Will be making this recipe again, and again, and again.

This was awesome bread!  Just like the steakhouse bread!  It is very heavy and dense.  Almost a meal in itself.

i didn't have instant coffee so i used 3/4 cups of coffee from my coffee pot...against my better judgement b/c i didnt' have instant coffee...i think may have been a bit too harsh for the yeast b/c my bread, while flavorful, was extremely dense....

Wow!  This one is not for the faint of heart.  Robust and crusty, it rose out of my bread maker to dominate my kitchen.  Anyone that wants an unusual, yet home-styled bread- this is your recipe.  Goes great with any meat based soup.  rdh

Ok, I tried this bread as posted yesterday and it never rose, it was just a lump that I threw in the trash.  Today I made it again with a few changes, as suggested and it is wonderful.  First of all, I cut back on the water by about 2 Tbs., and upped the honey by about 2 Tbs. and added 1 Tbs. molasses.  Because I used salted butter, I left the salt out completely, since it reacts with the yeast.  I also added 1 1/4 cups white and wheat flour so it wouldn't be so wet.  The last thing I did was added 2 full tsps. yeast, room temp.  We could hardly wait for it to cool just a bit, but when we did, we put butter and honey on it and is excellent!

This bread is absolutely delicious!  I certainly did not have any problems with the recipe; I've made this numerous times now and it turns out fabulous every time.  This is by far the most requested recipe in my household.  I used fancy molasses instead of honey (I was out...) the last time I made this and it was even better!!  Try it sometime - you won't be disappointed!

I was intrigued by the ingredients in this recipe.  Cocoa and coffee?  Well, those ingredients are spot-on!  Tastes just like what you find at a steakhouse.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  It makes a smaller loaf of bread and I used the "small 1.0 lb." setting on my machine.  Served with butter and honey.  Delicious!  Also really good as sandwich bread.

This is spectacular!!  My bf loves this bread and the distinct flavor.  The loaf is small so I do double it sometimes but the original recipe is good for a few days lunches.  I make this over and over.

The bread did not tast thet good and it came out like a ball. The outsides were all burnt. Also it stuck to the machine. It does not only take 3 min. to cook it takes 3 hours to cook. Over all I would not make it again. The tast was off and it said that you could not tast the coffee but you could. My kids and I love the Outback brown bread (as we call it) so I made this thinkin that it would tast like it, but my kids spit it out and told me never to make it aain. Take my advice DON'T MAKE IT!

Great flavor and tasted just like a certain steakhouse that could be found in Australia!!  I did add a little wheat germ and vital wheat gluten to make it feel like I was being healthy and not so indulgent.  Loved it and will be making it again.

Everyone that tasted this loaf raved about it.  It was gone in an hour so don’t know how it is day old.  Didn’t have instant coffee next time I’ll use a cup of coffee as suggested by another poster. I’m a new be and look at the flower content 3 cups of combined flower it’s a 1  ½ lb loaf   4 cups of combined flower 2 lb loaf.   I had this set on the 2 lb loaf setting only because I forgot, despite my error it came out perfect. Luck can out do skill.

I served this to my bridge group and they throughout enjoyed it. I followed the recipe as stated but did not notice that the machine should be placed on light crust. I used medium and it turned out very crunchy on the outside.  It is very tasty. When I make it again I think I shall add nuts.

This is very close to the original Outback bread, I was pleased. It was soft and tasty, I added a spoonful of molasses to get the color darker. Crust was soft and not too thick. I think next time I would just do the mini loaves, bc it is a lot.

Outstanding! 

I didn't use any sugar, and the honey flavor really stood out. 

I let the yeast bloom, and added it all to the bread maker, I set the bread machine up for a 3 rise cycle,  and.. wow.

Perfect!  Amazing!  I did not have cocoa powder, so I used chocolate syrup and warmed it a bit (like the kind you use to make chocolate milk.)  I did not have coffee granules, but I did have leftover coffee, so I used that instead.  I used 1/4 c. of coffee and reduced the amount of water to 1/2 c. minus 1 Tbsp to account for the liquid in the chocolate syrup.

This bread is MAGNIFICENT! It's my family's new go-to bread, replacing the fantastic white bread I've been making. Even my "pickiest-of-all-picky-eaters" child loves it. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!

Perfecttttt!! My family absolutely LOVED this bread. Sooo addicting! I wouldn’t change anything about it. I baked this in my mother’s old Welbilt ABM3500 bread machine, basic cycle (option 1), 1 pound setting (this recipe is for a 1 lb bread -setting - I was originally confused since the recipe didn’t state that), color: light and it baked perfectly! This will definitely be a staple bread recipe for years to come. Also, bread yeast is rapid rise yeast/instant yeast. I personally used the Fleischmann’s bread machine yeast (1 1/4 tsp. as indicated above) and made sure the water I used was 110 degrees.

This was the first recipe I tried with my new bread machine (I had lots of the ingredients on hand). I thought it was a close resemblance to the steakhouse bread and I liked it enough that I plan to make it again. I'm going to try adding vital wheat gluten next time to help with the rise though.

Good hearty wheat bread. Since price of bread went up, I started making my own a lot more. This is a nice toast bread. I was leery of the coffee, but never tasted it.I didn't have instant coffee so just used 3/4 cup  coffee instead of plain water. Will make again.  Forget store bread!

Taste is good. The loaf does not rise and the bottom is uncooked dough. Tried it twice.

LOVE this recipe!! So delicious- and wonderful hearty crust in the bread machine. I’ve made it as written several times, and last night- I tried a little variation: used cinnamon flavored coffee instead of water, and added slivered almonds into the ‘add-in’ stage of the machine. The house smelled divine!! The bread was true heaven! The choco-coffee-nut combo was exquisite. The color came out darker: I used Ghiridelli cocoa powder, dark honey, and cinnamon flavor coffee. Going to make it again tonight, trying Christopher Elbow cocoa, and Cameon’s Highlander Grog coffee, with oats and almonds. Great use of wheat flour recipe- and SO EASY!!

I didn’t have wheat flour so used all purpose. And I cut open a pod of espresso powder to use for instant coffee.  Put on 1 1/2 lb setting. It turned out great!!

Great recipe! I did have to add additional flour, but that is not unusual with bread. Some days you'll need to add a little and some days you'll need to take away a little. Bread was light fluffy and soft. Tasted very very close to Longhorn bread.

I have made this bread twice now.  The first time I probably had my water too hot as it didn't rise much at all but the flavor was excellent.  The second time I was more careful and it turned out of to be the most beautiful loaf I've gotten out of my cheap little machine. This is among my favorites.

This was a great loaf of bread!  We really enjoyed it and it was very close to the restaurant honey wheat bread. I set it on basic light and for 1 1/2 lb loaf.

This is definitely a different take on whole wheat bread. I wasn't sure what to expect with both coffee and cocoa powder in a wheat bread but it is delicious and disappeared quickly. Definitely a keeper.

This was an epic failure for me, the recipe is way too small, even when I adjusted my bread machine to the smallest size loaf when it started baking it barely covered the bottom of the pan. I will try again and scale the recipe to 3 cups of flour which makes a normal sized loaf.

A very tasty bread.  I added a TB cornmeal and heaping TB ground flax.  Mixed it in my bread machine but baked in the oven.  For sure do-overs.

This recipe a meant for a tiny load of bead. If you are making dough in a bread machine I suggest that you need to double the recipe to make a l normal/ large loaf.  Once you cook it in the oven you need to let it cool because it is so fluffy you loaf will crush.

I copied the reviewer who used 3/4 cup of coffee instead of water and instant coffee, and used 1.5 lb setting on my breadmaker.  It came out amazing!!! My husband immediately recognized this bread from his fav restaurant and my kids gobbled it up, with our salad! Thanks so much, I will be making this weekly!

OMGosh!!!!  Incredibly perfect. It was so delicious that I started a second loaf after the bread machine cooled down.  I plan to take this over as a new neighbor welcome. And, then will likely make a third loaf before the weekend is over. Thanks, Jennifer, for sharing!

Really tasty bread that the grandkids loved. Makes a one lb loaf ... Set crust on light ... I added to the whole wheat cup a little protein powder & vital gluten flour and then filled the cup up with the whole wheat flour.

The bread was excellent, had some this morning as toast--yummy! Don't worry if you don't have bread machine yeast, this works perfectly using a whole packet of regular active dry yeast.

Followed the directions for my 2 lb. bread machine. I had no gluten flour. Also used brewed coffee from breakfast. I was more than pleased with the results. Wonderful texture and flavor. Thanks "Teadrinker" for the conversion. I'll be making this bread often. Diane Stadler

Soft inside crusty outside. I followed the directions. I made the dough in the bread machine and turned it out on a floured board that was enough extra flour. I greased a loaf pan covered it and let it rise for 60 minutes . Baked at 350 for 30 minutes . It was wonderful .

I followed the recipe exactly (well, the ingredients, anyway) and this was awesome! I used the bread machine but on the "dough" cycle. I made it into 2 round loaves and let them rise again. The rise times for this bread was much more than white breads, but I expected that. I baked the loaves at 325 degrees for 20 minutes (internal temp. 190 degrees).

I found this to be very bitter and tasted strongly of coffee and chocolate.  It did have a great texture and crumb.   Not a fan and will not make again.

Just like from the restaurant!! It is indeed a slightly sweeter, denser bread than usual, not for everyday. My family loves it and have made this several times just as directed.

It's turned out looking good but the taste was way off from the steakhouse style bread I was thinking I was making. None the less I made the recipe as directed to give it a shot. I think next time I will take away the cocoa and instant coffee and see how that improves the bread.

I made this bread .. and oh my goodness.. I LOVED it, and I will be making it again!

I did make 2 changes.. since I can not tolerate coffee, I left the coffee granules out.. and I also added brown sugar instead of white.

I have a Panasonic SD YD250 .. I set it on the Whole Wheat Bake Rapid, Medium loaf, 3 hour cycle.. and it was soooo good !

I made this as written in my Zojirushi 2lb loaf bread machine and it was great!  Next time I will increase the recipe to at least 3 cups of flour, (or double) and increase other ingredients accordingly.  My machine could have handled double the size loaf.  The only substitution I made was agave instead of honey (since I was out of honey). This bread is soft, flavorful, and rather sweet.  It's terrific warm spread with salted butter.  I didn't want to share the loaf, but my family made me.  It's a must try.

Yum! This is a winner and I made it exactly as described in a bread maker with the selection of a 1 lb loaf. With only 2 cups of flour total, it seemed to me that was the correct size to select, and it turned out a lovely loaf. I will agree that at the various stages it looked WAY more gloppy in the maker than any other recipe I've tried but the result was a soft, moist, delicious bread that is fantastic. Next time I plan to adjust the recipe for a 1.5 lb or a 2lb loaf as this one was consumed completely before it even had a chance to cool down out of the oven!

I made a vegan version of this using coconut oil instead of butter and molasses instead of honey; and used brewed coffee instead of instant, and coconut sugar instead of white sugar.  These changes resulted in a crispier crust than I've had with this recipe before. A delicious way to initiate my new bread machine!
11/8/16: made it this time using stevia instead of sugar, added about a quarter cup extra of whole wheat flour (no bread flour), and an equal mix of olive oil and coconut oil, still with molasses. Still a lovely loaf that paired delightfully with pumpkin black bean soup.

So I was really excited to try this bread as I LOVE the breads they serve at steak houses.  Heres the thing, I looked  at many comments from people who have made it too.  There was one particular post from someone who made it via mini loafs.  She had recommendations on a diff temp and bake time which I followed.  Although the bread was slightly over cooked it still tasted delicious!  I would definitely try this again but play around with the bake time and temp a bit more.

Doubled recipe exactly and they turned out great. Made half the dough into rolls and the other half a loaf of bread. Did add 3-4 tbsp. vital wheat gluten. Might try coating pans in cornmeal before baking.

Great tasting bread!  I followed the recipe exactly in my Zojirushi mini bread maker (this was actually the first loaf I made).  Everything came out great except maybe it rose too much and ended up hitting the lid after baking....guess it wasn't too much of an issue.  I think next time I'll drop the yeast down to 1tsp though to see if that makes a difference since I'm using the smaller bread maker.

This is just about perfect.  We generally go through the loaf within 5 minutes at dinner.  The texture with this recipe as well as the flavor is awesome.  I see no reason to modify the recipe (which I always find reasons to do) as its great the way it is.  Thanks for posting this!

I loves this bread!  I made it with all organic wheat flour and leftover brewed coffee from breakfast. It was not doughy on the least. May be because I used all wheat flour. Next time will try with no salt as my grandson has developed a kidney issue. Thank you for this recipe!

Love this bread. I like that it is simple and you can use ingredients that almost everyone has in your cupboard (except the yeast). I have tried making this bread in the machine completely and also I used the machine to prepare the dough and baked it in the oven. I had great results at 375° for 27-30 minutes.

I just made this recipe as my first ever homemade bread recipe. I followed the recipe exactly using a 2 lb bread machine on the basic setting with light crust. This is exactly what I was expecting. A little whipped cinnamon honey butter and this would be amazing! I might recommend using the medium crust setting just to give it a slightly firmer crust, but I will definitely make this again, thank you!

I made this tonight in my new Cuisinart breadmaker.  I used the regular white bread setting for 1.5 lb loaf with light crust.  It is so delicious my husband and I ate half the loaf as soon as it was done.

Used tea drinker's Zojirushi modification for my Zo, increasing the ingredients for a 2 lb. loaf and it worked perfectly, (used butter, not margarine).  I monitored the kneading cycle to make sure the dough was not too wet and it was not.  Perhaps that's because of the addition of the vital wheat gluten recommended by tea drinker.  It was light, mildly crusty (would probably use the dark crust setting next time, instead of medium, as we like a crunchy crust) and not too sweet.  I used SAF yeast 2 1/4 teaspoon.  Went over very well:  plain, sandwiches, etc.  grace614

This was the second loaf I ever made in my bread machine (the first was the basic "Best Bread Machine Bread"), and I was a bit nervous to try something so complex so early, but I needn't have been. It was a complete success!!! Totally loved another reviewer's suggestion to top it with butter--amazing! Anyway, I have a 2.5-lb Panasonic bread machine with automatic yeast dispenser. Did 1.5 times the original recipe and set the machine to Bake, Whole Wheat, Medium Loaf (which is the smallest setting for the model). I followed Panasonic's instructions for adding the ingredients, not the recipe's, and used active dry yeast rather than bread machine yeast. Perfection.

Edit: Just tried a doubled-recipe batch on the large loaf setting (the second of the machine's three sizes), and it came out perfect too.

Really, really good; a definite keeper.  I haven't used my bread machine much, but will be using more often now just to make this delicious bread.  I used warm milk instead of water, increased salt to 1 tsp. and added 2 Tbs. flaxseed. I mixed ingredients as directed and used "Regular Wheat Bread" setting on machine.  (I didn't have instant coffee, but had some instant chai tea so used that.)

This loaf was really small. It doesn't make a 1.5 loaf so when I put it on basic it almost burned the crust. Hopefully will be better with some tweaking. 3hrs in the bread machine was too long. On the upside my husband really liked it. I ate it too but was not impressed.

Loved this recipe. I hadn't used my bread machine much but saw this recipe and had to try it. It was delicious. I used the the 1.5lb setting and the second time I made it I used the medium crust setting instead of light. I also used Nestle Quick instead of unsweetened cocoa because that is all I had. Fantastic.

The flavor of this bread is nice, but as I remember about steakhouse wheat bread, it's a bit gooey in the middle.

Made this bread yesterday. Flavor has "deepened" overnight. Very soft and makes a nice toast. Substitutes for what i didn't have cocoa/nestles quick. and instant coffee granules made an extra strong cup of coffee and used it instead of water.Just the right size loaf for a small family

This was fantastic.  My only change was using this morning's coffee instead of water and instant coffee granules.  I will absolutely make this again, but I think my breadmaker can make at least 1.5 times this recipe, if not more, so next time I will try that.
*** I've made this a few times now, and I always use the morning coffee, and I've been making a 1.5 loaf batch (12 servings) also, I've been adding a heaping spoonful of vital wheat gluten.  This makes it so fluffy and amazing.  We love it.

Love this recipe!  The only change I made was adding 1 tablespoon powdered wheat gluten to help it rise a little better. Great sweet, hearty taste!!!

I set my machine for 1 1/2 lb loaf with a light crust. I used whole wheat bread flour & whole wheat pastry flour, so I had to add more warm water.I did not have coffee granules, so I replaced the 3/4 water with lukewarm coffee. I also used agave syrup in place of the honey. It's super sweet so I skipped the TB of sugar. Very tasty!

I was very excited when I discovered this recipe. I have been making bread by hand, since I given up on my bread machine. I have never had a loaf of bread come out right using the bread machine. So, I used the bread machine again and I was disappointed again. Now the bread machine will continue collecting dust. The end result trying this recipe was that the coffee was just a little over powering, heavy, dense, and a little gooey. The next time I will add less coffee. The bread was different than what I remember the Steakhouse serving.  I will make this bread again, but using the good old hands.

This recipe is fantastic--I'll have to double the recipe though next time as it did make a small loaf. I left out the instant coffee and loved the way it came out--dense, moist, a bit sweet but the cocoa balances it out. Fantastic. Not sure why others had problems with the recipe. Great loaf of bread.

Followed the recipe exactly.  The loaf came out a little strange looking...sort of lopsided.  I am not sure if it was because it just wasn't enough dough for my machine (which is supposed to do anything from 1-2 lbs) or that the dough was much gloppier than others so it didn't form the nice loaf it usually does.  Regardless, it tasted really good, the texture was fine once baked, and everyone in the family enjoyed it!

I made mine on the wheat cycle, medium crust and it came out wonderful. We ate it straight out of the bread machine with corned beef and cabbage. Everyone loved it and were surprised to learn the ingredients. Will definitely make again!

Yesterday was a chilly and gray October Sunday, and I was in the mood for Soup... This was the perfect bread to make, and it turned out all sorts of wonderful! I have a 2-LB Bread machine, so I upscaled the recipe to 12 servings (1-1/2 loaves). The only change I made was out of necessity; I used Orville Reddenbacher Buttery-flavored popping oil (soybean base) for my fat. (and then ran to the store for more butter while the machine was doing it's thing!) It actually worked out very well, I think!

This was a good, flavorful bread, but not the best wheat bread recipe I have tried.  It was a little sweet for my tastes, and it didn't keep for as long as I am used to with a wheat bread.

This bread is DELICIOUS!!  I LOVE it.  We don't drink coffee so i put in some Pero granules, a malted barley drink, and I used 1 3/4 C whole wheat flour and a 1/4 cup white flour instead, and it was light and to die for.  LOVE.

This was so good! I realized once I started making it that I didn't have any wheat flour, so I used all bread flour. It was delicious! It still comes out brown like whole wheat bread, so who is going to know the difference. Looking forward to trying it again with the wheat flour next time.

Given that the reviews were all over the place, I went ahead a followed to the letter. I, too, was a bit concerned when I saw the results of the machine's mixing, but at the end, this was amazing! I set on the 1-lb loaf, whole wheat setting, and it was just perfect. I wish I could say what it was like the next day, but the next day had its own new loaf, as the first was eaten in one sitting and there were requests for breakfast the next morning. 
Next time I might reduce the sugar or honey some, just a personal preference.

Made it today!  Had to make a few mods because I was missing a couple ingredients, but it still came out completely perfect!  So, first, I live at high altitude (like a mile high) so I'm never sure if anything that rises will work correctly, but it worked fantastically! I did not have any honey, so I used 1/4 c of maple syrup. Also, no cocoa, so I substituted 2 T of hot cocoa mix for the cocoa and sugar. My machine capacity is 1.5 to 2 pounds, so this one pound loaf was pretty small--next time I'll just double everything. Despite my substitutions, this bread rose and baked perfectly, and tastes light, fluffy and flavorful!

This bread was scrumptious! I doubled the recipe, and it turned out perfect. We loved the slightly sweet honey taste especially in the crust. The bread keeps well wrapped in plastic wrap, and is also great for toast. One slice is enough...as it is very filling. I will be
making this bread until the big dough hook in the sky takes me away! Thanks for the recipe.

Comparing the quantities to the recipes that came with my machine, this is for a one pound loaf. 

I used porter beer instead of the water, warmed in a hot water bath with the honey and butter in it. Very nice, chewy without being dense. I might put some oats on top just before baking next time to see what happens. It makes superlative toast

The crust is very dark, even on the light setting, but doesn't taste burned, and putting it in a plastic bag or cover with a bit of room while it's still warm will soften it quite a bit. Definitely one of my new favorites.

Great tasting and easy to make recipe.  I sometimes add two tablespoons sundried tomatoes and one teaspoon each of fresh herbs such as rosemary, basil and oregano for a tasty savory bread.  Yumm!

this bread has a really great texture, and a crispy crust! I've been having trouble with breadmaker recipes producing weird textures, but this is nice and chewy! I didn't feel like using 1/4 cup of honey, so I used about 1/8 c. honey and 1/8 c. molasses. Also, I didn't use the extra 1T of sugar.

This recipe resulted in a really pretty loaf. Unfortunately, it didn't taste very good. I can't even compare it to anything. It doesn't taste like any bread I've ever tried. I followed the recipe scaling for a 2 lb loaf and added 4 tsp vital wheat gluten to help with the rise. I used the allrecipes servings tool to calculate the scaling so I know I didn't screw anything up. The texture is great. Nice thin crust, fluffy and not too dense. This bread just doesn't taste good.

This bread is sooooo yummmmmm! I don't ge any mocha flavor like I was afraid of. It's a nice sweet brown bread. My kids loved it! I made it with agave syrup in place of the sugar. WONDERFUL!!! My top sunk down...I think it's a flaw of my machine tho. It was puffed up...but, then it sunk. Not the recipes fault.

These were tasty but not as good as another knock-off I found on another site. These didn't seem to be dense enough and were a bit too heavy handed on the cocoa/sweet taste.  Whereas the other ones I would make again, these -- not so much.  A good recipe but not a great one.

I followed the recipe and it burned a bit in my bread machine. I will just use the dough setting next time. Then make rolls in the oven. Good flavor.

This was really good bread.  I reduced the coffee amount only by a little bit because others said it was bitter.  I doubled the recipe and put it in my breadmachine on the 2 pound setting.  It turned out great.  Soft, fluffy texture with great taste.  Not an exact copy of the steakhouse bread but still good bread.

Increased the recipe for 12 servings, as that is the usual flour capacity for my bread machine.  Used already brewed coffee for the liquid, eliminating the instant granules.  Used all molasses, instead of honey.  This gave the bread the rich, deep flavor of the dark bread.  Upped the yeast, as well as added 1T gluten.  I don't think the bread would have risen as much if I didn't.  Added a few more T of flour, as the dough seemed sticky in the dough cycle of my machine.   Great taste.  Would make again.  Very close knock off of the steakhouse dark bread.  Thanks!

5 stars because the loaf came out beautifully - I made as written but doubled it. However (never having had the "original" steakhouse bread) I found this overly sweet - next time I'll cut out the extra 2 tbsp of sugar I think....or at the very least substitute 1 tbsp molasses for some extra nutrition instead.

This is a pretty decent copycat recipe. I got lots of great feedback when I made this for a church event.  The dough is REALLY sticky though.

When I am at the local Steakhouse I usually fill up on the mini loafs, before the steak even arrives. So, when I found this recipe I HAD to try it. I have made this recipe several times as listed, and each time it was great. Then I changed it just a little, first since I am single I halved the recipe, and still used the breadmachine... still great. Then I changed the honey for molasses, even better. Then just started using the breadmachine to mix the dough, and used mini loaf pans to bake in... now with a herb crusted steak, garlic mashed potatoes, and grilled veggies... I no longer have to go to the steakhouse.

This is pretty good bread. The texture was great! I could really taste the cocoa and coffee in it. The recipe doesn't really say the loaf size. I set my bread machine to a 1 LB loaf size and it was perfect.

I thought this was quite good.  And smelled so yummy!  I made it in my Sunbeam El Cheapo Breadmaker on the 1.5 loaf setting.  Later, I will try to use the dough setting and make it as rolls as another reviewer suggested.

I found my mother's older bread machine, one of the earliest Black & Decker models, and decided to try my hand; since my daughters had done most of the bread making when still at home. I chose this as one of my experiments because I always liked the small loaves served in some restaurants. It was a Success! Every crumb was perfect, including the crust, but I would not recommend this for sandwiches. It is the best meat and potatoes, pot roast or soup bread with lots of butter.

This bread FIANLLY gave me a machine-made bread with beautiful texture & good flavor, although I will cut back on the sweetener next time.  I used the lightest crust setting my machine has, but the dog still got the crust - & loved it.  The other thing that baffles me is, with this recipe, the dough formed in balls which didn't stick together (!) I let it bake that way & treated the loaf as a pull-apart.  It's a fine starting place for finding a way to make bread in the machine that has a texture other than baked hockey puck.  In fact, it has a very nice texture.

Great bread! I used the 1.5lb loaf setting, but it loaf was a bit small and overbrowned even with light crust setting; will try smaller loaf setting next time. I didn't have bread flour (plain) available so used bread multigrain flour - otherwise no mods. Yummy!

My bread looked just like the picture. It was great, nothing I would change about the recipe.  It sliced perfectly.  I might try to add something a little nutty to the dough after it has risen---don't know.  It was great.

This bread was wonderful!  I was a little nervous about how others said that the bread was sticky in the machine, but I just added a little extra flour and it came out PERFECT!!  Will definitely make this again and again :)

Delicious bread. I doubled the recipe and followed another reviewer's advice for making this with my KA and baked in the oven. It was beautiful dough and not gooey at all. Because the bread is so dark it is hard to tell when it is completely cooked. About 20 mins at 350 in four mini loaf pans worked out best. So good toasted with butter or cream cheese.

Soo good! I baked this by hand and used Starbucks Via for the instant. I did use the Italian Roast which is pretty strong. I think I will use Colombia next time.

I didn' like this bread. Just not what I enjoy. I'm giving it 4 stars only because the other people that ate it really liked it.  I made in in my KA and baked it in a boule on my oven stone. Smelled nice when baking!

This was delicious. I used the dough setting on my bread machine then rolled out the dough on a floured surface. I then cut dough into 4 equal servings and placed in my mini bread pan. After letting it rise for an hour I baked at 375 for 30 minutes. I was concerned at the beginning that the dough was very wet but it baked up nicely. Thanks for the recipe.

I've only been baking bread now for about 3 months (about once a week). This is by far the best recipe I have tried! It really taste like the bread at the steakhouses! I upped the honey a bit. Simply delish!

I was disappointed. I expected it to taste like a famous steakhouse bread, but this has a strong, funky flavor.

I don't know what is going on with the people having problems with this recipe....it is great.  If it looks to wet just leave it. Follow the directions and it should turn out great!! Maybe your yeast was bad or something? Or the way your machine settings are. I followed the basic cycle and light crust.  It is a small loaf...my machine doesn't have a size option. I hope this helps because... Mine turned out absolutely perfect and yummy!

The bread is delicious... and usually moist. The only problem I ran in to was when I use store-bought self-rising flour instead of making my own from regular flour; it seems to make it drier. I would take this out 5-10 mins before the bread machine is done in order to maintain moisture.

I just made this tonight to serve with a spinach and tortellini soup, my family LOVED it!!!  This will become a staple for us, my girls 3+5 were asking for more and my hubby went back for thirds!  The flavor was great, and the texture as well not flaky or dry at all.  I was out of honey so substituted with light corn syrup, not too sweet at all.

This is the best bread I have ever made. I used AP flour and it came out perfect.  It was kinda sticky while it was rising, but I just left it and it was great.  It is the prettiest loaf I've ever made.

Love it! We altered the recipe and used 100% whole wheat flour. I used 1 and 7/8 cups whole wheat flour and 1/8 or 2 TBS bread gluten. And also omitted the sugar. It was amazing. I will try it again today as rolls, perhaps topping them with a little oatmeal before baking.

This bread was a little sweeter than I expected, and didnt rise quite as much as I'd hoped, but it was still good. Next time I'd eat it with jam or butter, not as a bread with dinner. A bit too sweet for that. But still yummy!

This bread came out very nice.  It is a sweeter bread, but very tasty.  I made the bread on the dough cycle in my Bread Machine, then baked in a bread pan in the oven.  Will make again!!

I made this bread last night for dinner and like many say,  the dough looks very gooey untill the end.  I added a sprinkle of extra flour here and there along the way but did my best not to alter the over all recipe.  I set the machine to 1.5lbs, basic, light crust.  It came out great!  Just have faith and try not to look at it untill the final 30mins.

I used 1 1/2c. wheat and 1/2c. all purpose flour because I didn't have any bread flour and it came out very delicious!  I pulled the mixed dough from the bread maker and divided it to make 6 rolls that I baked for 13 mins in a 320 degree oven and then mixed a little honey into some butter to make it even more like Outback's bread!

This is good! I made the dough in the machine and followed the advice to make rolls in the oven. This is a dense bread but that doesn't bother me in a roll. Good flavor. Will make again!

Great recipe! I used the ingredients as directed (except for maybe used 3/4 TBS of cocoa powder instead of a whole TBS) and it came out perfect. I have an ANCIENT Zojirushi that was handed down that doesn't even have a "basic" setting, so I just guessed by choosing "raisin bread dry milk" and it came out perfectly! This one is a keeper.

This was a little sweet. I think next time I will omit the sugar, as I think it will be plenty sweet with only the 1/4 cup honey (it only makes a 1 pound loaf). Other than that, it was very good and I will definitely make it again.

This was exactly what I had in mind when I saw this recipe!  Delicious!  I did as another "rater" did, but also added other changeds: I didn't have instant coffee so added one cup brewed good coffee and 1/4 cup warm water, 2/3 cup honey, 2 tbsp sugar, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 3/4 tsp salt, 1  1/2 tbsp butter, 2 cups flour (didn't have bread flour just ran out), 1 1/4 cupp whole wheat flour and one package yeast.  This made about a 1 1/2 to 2 lb loaf and lastly I put on "basic" setting and had to take out 25 minutes early or it would have been wayyyyy too hard.  Wonderful loaf, made one and quickly made another to send home with my son!  I'm going to try with the instant coffee too!

This bread is by far THE BEST!!! Excellent texture & flavor. I love the small (shorter) loaves. Cuts beautifully for sandwiches. I used AP flour not cake flour and it came out great. I also added 1T APF after 5 min of kneading as dough looked a bit wet. TURNED OUT GREAT!!!! This is a staple bread in our home!!!!

I just made this bread. I had everything on hand except the unsweetened cocoa, I used hot chocolate mix and left out the sugar. I had to add a little dusting of flour to it while it was mixing in the machine. This bread is so good! It tastes just like the Outback Steak house bread! I am going to make this again for sure!

This was easy and insanely good. The combo of ingredients DOES seem strange but the taste is amazing. I made the 1.5 lb loaf (light crust) in our bread machine but I have the PC mini loaf stoneware pan and I think this bread would be easier to slice in a mini loaf. This recipe would make excellent buns also. I think next time I will add a little bit of old fashioned oats just to beef up the fiber and texture but it's great as is.

Nice texture, great flavor.  It doesn't state it, but the recipe is for a one pound loaf.  The listed 'cook time' and 'ready in' time are obviously off.  Easy to cut and wonderful in savory or sweet creations (ie grilled cheese or almond butter and honey sandwiches).  I make it on a regular basis.

I loved this recipe but i used the white bread, 1lb loaf, light crust setting on my breadmaker (cuisinart 2lb convection) and it was burnt on the outside (delicious on the inside, though)!! Should I have used a different setting?Does anyone have any suggestions?

Honestly, I didn't think this really tasted like the bread they serve at steakhouses.  It seemed like an ordinary wheat bread to me.  But, it was really good none-the-less.  This was only my second voyage into breadmaker recipes (usually I make it by hand, but my boyfriend's mother gave me a breadmaker a few weeks ago).  It was very easy, and turned out great!  It was not goopy or gloppy or whatever other reviewers said.  I'm not sure what went wrong with their loaves, but mine was great!

It came out perfectly and everyone loved it.  It has such a rich flavor and great texture.  I set my machine for small/reg loaf and it worked just fine.

This bread turned out great! It is best served warm with some butter, but can be used for sandwiches and stuff as well. I followed the recipe except I also used old coffee instead of coffee granules.

I followed the directions exactly and made it in my bread machine.  I got a goopy mess that didn't even think about rising.  The dough tasted just ok and wasn't reminiscent of the steakhouse bread that I remember.  A waste of good ingredients.

Very tasty bread!  I used the basic setting on my bread machine which made it a little dark, so I'm going to try the sweet setting and I'm betting it will be perfect.  Going to make some for my best friend right now!

I thought this recipe was really yummy and tasted a lot like the bread you get an Outback.  I used 3/4 cup warm coffee instead of water and instant coffee.  Also, I add 1/3 cup of honey and 1.5 T of sugar.  I wanted it a little sweeter.  It made a 1/2 loaf in my bread machine and it was very moist and tasty.  My husband liked it with honey butter.

This is a really good bread but it wasn't quite what I was looking for or expecting. Still, it's a fabulous bread, my husband and kids love it! Altered the recipe just a bit as the original recipe was sweeter than I would have liked: I cut the honey back to 1 tbsp and upped the instant coffee crystals to 1 tbsp. Great bread!

The bread has an excellent flavor but it did not work well in the bread machine.  The outer crust was slightly burned, probably due to the high sugar content, and the inside was sticky and seemed undercooked.  If I use this again I would increase yeast, increase flour, and slightly decrease honey.

Very unique bread recipe.  Just baked my first loaf and will definately use this recipe again.  The dough was slightly wet and I did add 2 T flour while mixing in the bread machine. It does take longer than 13 minutes. Well worth my money and time. Family loved this bread.

Great steakhouse bread! My kids loved the bread.  I did have to up the yeast to 2 tsp, but other than that, we all enjoyed it.  Mahalo for sharing this recipe.

Excellent! No adjustments. I really don't get the negative ratings. Doing this as mini loaves as another reviewer mentioned is a fun presentation. Make some honeybutter and you have a steakhouse hit!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very hard and dense. I think it would be ok in open face sandwich, but I will not be making it again.

The flavor is great, but mine did not rise as much as it should. It is probably my error rather than the recipe, as I used graham flour instead if the regular whole wheat. This recipe will definitely be tried again. Everyone loved it.

I made this one snowy day to enjoy with the kids. It's really good hot from the machine with butter. It's a pretty small loaf (definitely good for a 1lb machine) and tasted slightly bitter the next day. Makes good toast though, and would be good for PBJs also.

This bread was great!! I didn't have wheat flour so I used all AP flour and still turned out great. I read the recipe wrong and added 1 T of instant coffee but I didn't notice anything differnt until I was rereading thru the recipe and ate half the loaf!! great bread and will try again with right measurments.

Didn't like this one. I needed to add quite a bit more flour to get the consistency right. It was too sweet and 'chocolatey' for our taste - almost like a bread you would serve as a sweet treat with tea, rather than one to have with lunch or dinner.
