This bread is very moist and delicious.  Instead of buying strawberry extract, I used 1 tsp. vanilla in the bread batter, and in the glaze I used about 1/2 tsp. vanilla plus a few drops of orange extract.  I also use granulated sugar instead of flour whenever greasing the pans for quick breads.  It makes a sweet little crust on the underside that is much more appealing than flour residue.

Loved the recipe - will definitely make it again.

This bread had a wonderful flavor.  I have never had strawberry bread before, but it was much more than I expected!  I would suggest if you don't intend to eat it up fast that you don't put the glaze on it after it bakes.  Make the glaze and reserve it to place on slices.  I found that it made the bread have a clammy texture because we didn't eat the two loaves right away.

Before discovering this recipe at the allrecipes.com website, I'd never heard of strawberry bread.  Man, what a discovery!  I will prepare this again and again.  It's closer to cake than bread, but what does the name matter?  It's moist, sweet but not overly sweet, unique, and spotlights strawberries--my favorite fruit.  What more could we ask for?  Five stars and beyond!  I wouldn't change a thing.

oh YUM! ok so i didnt have any strawberry extract, and i needed to use up the strawberries in the fridge.. so although i only made 1 loaf (half recipe) i used the full 2 tbsp of strawberry jam instead of extract to make up for sweetness (that sweetened frozen strawberries have vs fresh ones). This is the most fab, gorgeous, pinkest bread - ever!

This is wonderful cake/bread. Will be a favorite with us. I however found the added sweetness of the sauce was unnessasery,so will leave the sauce off in the future.

This is one of my favorite bread recipes! My sis made it first, and sent it too me all the way from ND! And stayed moist! When I made it, I didn't have strawberry extract so I used a mix of almond, vanilla and a minimal amount of lemon extracts!  It was wonderful!  I also added a struesel toping from the banana crumb muffin recipe from this site, for some added sweetness. I     followed other reviews and opted not to use the strawberry topping.   Thanks!

This was good but we didn't find it great, like the other reviewers.  I did not use the glaze per everyone's suggestion, and did find the strawberry extract.  We started out baking 4 loaves and had a real problem.  We took them out of the oven after 45 minutes, and the toothpick came out clean.  However, within 5 minutes all 4 loaves had fallen.  They weren't done.  The toothpick came out clean because there was a space under the crust.  I talked with my father-in-law who was a baker for 60 years and he told me to bake it for 55 minutes at 375 degrees.  We made two more loaves and this was much closer to the cook time.  He said it was because the strawberries while thawed were still cold and made the batter cold, increasing the bake time.  
After all the work the bread was good but just 3 stars in our book.

I looked in two grocery stores (Kroger and Super Target) and could not find strawberry extract, so I used vanilla extract based on another review.  I thought this was a very tasty bread, but thought the cinnamon was a little overpowering (although this may have been because I didn't use the strawberry extract).  I will make this again.

The cake was very moist and delicious. Instead of two loaf pans I baked it in a Bundt pan and it only took 50 minutes to bake.

This was a great recipe!  I did not make the sauce and found that the bread is sweet enough.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This tasted pretty good.  I've never had a strawberry bread before, so this was new for me.  I thought the cinnamon seemed excessive, so i only put in 1 teaspoon and the strawberry extract seemed like a lot too, so i only put in 1 teaspoon of that as well. But when i tasted the batter it didn't taste enough like strawberry even with all the fruit in there, so i put in the full 2 tablespoons of extract.  However, next time i think i'll just use strawberry jam because by the time you put in all the extract you've just about used up the little bottle.  I made the glaze and it tasted pretty good, altho i don't think the bread really needs it, I think it would taste great and stay moist on it's own without the glaze.  I also did not get the nice pink color shown in the photo, mine was a light pinky-brown.  I also ended up baking it longer than  stated because it just wasn't getting done in the middle, i added additional 20 minutes and didn't want it to burn all around the edges so i took it out and after it cooled it fell in the middle and was a bit under baked still.  Another reviewer suggested increasing the temperature as well as the bake time, so next time i'll try that.  All in all this was pretty good and i'll make it again for friends and family.

This bread is so delicious.  It's become a thing people know me for in the past year.  I will make it whenever I have strawberries a bit past their prime, although I'm sure it tastes just as great with frozen strawberries.  Sometimes I'll put sugar in the pans for a sweet crispy surprise.  I've never used strawberry extract just because I always have vanilla on hand, and it seems to do the trick.  Also I've only made the glaze once because this bread is too delicious and the texture too perfect to supplement.  I'm so glad I found this recipe, it'll be in the books for years to come.  :)

This is THE BEST EVER, easiest, yummy and moist bread ever! I make LOTS of Christmas breads and I have never heard of this one!  I read the other reviews and since I wanted more strawberry flavor I did cut the cinnamon to 1/2T, and I couldn't find strawberry extract.. that's the ONLY change I made, oh...I too didn't use the topping, just sprinkled with powdered sugar..GREAT GIFTS..EVERYONE LOVED THEM!!  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE.

This is my new favorite quick bread recipe.  I made it exactly as directed.  I did poke holes in the top of the bread with a wooden skewer and poured the warm glaze over so it would soak in better, but I might just skip the glaze altogether next time as I'm not sure it added anything other than calories.

Good - I made this without the topping, substituted half the canola with applesauce, and used vanilla extract instead of strawberry.  It's a great sweet bread for breakfast or a snack

Delicious and moist. I followed one reviewer's suggestion and dusted the loaf pans with grandulated sugar for a nice crunchy coating. I substituted Chambord (1 TBSP) and 1 TBSP of strawberry jam for the extract. I have made the bread many times and it is a keeper!

I had never heard of a strawberry loaf, and was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I don't like strawberry cake, so I was skeptical, but this bread tastes like strawberry jam. I made a half recipe with a few alterations: 1. I didn't have strawberry extract, so I used an equal amount of strawberry jam 2. I omitted the cinnamon 3. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract 4. I did not make the glaze. Other than that I followed everything in the original recipe, and it turned out great. It's really light and fluffy, and not overpoweringly sweet. My loaves did not get the nice pink color that's in the other picture--maybe because I used jam instead of extract? Overall, this is a surprisingly good loaf.

I MADE THIS RECIPE EXACTLY AS YOUR DIRECTIONS SAY.  HOWEVER, THE BREAD WAS NOT EVEN REMOTELY PINK AND TASTED LIKE A CINNAMON BREAD.  I DO A LOT OF BAKING FOR MY FAMILY AND FOR OTHERS SO I AM NO STRANGER TO BAKING.  THE LOAF TASTED GOOD BUT DID NOT RESEMBLE THE PINK BREAD YOU SHOW. THE CINNAMON MEASUREMENT IS EXCESSIVE.  USUALLY A RECIPE CALLS FOR NO MORE THAN A TEASPOON.

This bread is delicious and easy.  I will definitely make it again.  I did make some amendments to the recipe.  I did not use the strawberry extract; I replaced it with vanilla.  Instead of using frozen strawberries, I used fresh, and I did not use the glaze.  The bread still turned out perfectly and had a fantastic taste.

I added cocoa powder to add something to the bread and it kind of over powered the strawberry.  Next time I will go as the recipe says.

Everyone raved about this Strawberry bread it is really so moist and tasty. I will serve it for Easter with Strawberry ice cream on top. I may have to make my strawberries in syrup, since just one place sell them in Panama City. One of my favorite recipes.

I've made this every Christmas holiday for the last coupld of years and it always get rave reviews. My friends expect me to make this for them now during the holidays. 

I find that it takes my oven 1 hour and 5 minutes to cook a large loaf and around 40-45 minutes to cook mini loaves. 

I sprinkle sugar on the bottom of the greased pan to give it a sweet and slightly crunch crust. I also omit the strawberry extract and I omit the glaze because it's sweet enough on it's own (and it transports better).

This is very good bread.  More like cake than bread.  I did not have strawberry extract so I used vanilla - I did use less.  Freezes well too!

Mmmm - VERY GOOD! I used fresh strawberries. I sprinkled brown sugar on top and granulated sugar in the pan instead of flour. Also - used vanilla instead of strawberry extract. The bread is like a dessert loaf! Its delicious! I did not feel the need to add the glaze - great without!

I halved the recipe and used fresh strawberries that I had on hand. I was able to find the strawberry extract and I believe that that is what gives the bread the lovely pink color. This was very good - more of a cinnamon bread than a strawberry bread. I will make this again.

Very dense, moist and sweet. Great flavor..My husband loved it, but I wished it was more bread-like.

While the flavor of this bread is good,  I didn't care for the texture.  It was very most, almost puddding-like.  The color was a very dark red, almost a brown.   I was expect more of a quick bread texture.  I won't be making this again.

Great bread!!  I do not add the topping I think the bread is perfect without it.  A Christmas present favorite in my family.

Oh my gosh! This is scrumptious. Like other reviewers, I couldn't find strawberry extract and instead used 1 tsp. of vanilla. I also only used 1 tsp. cinnamon because a tablespoon seemed like a lot to me. And I had to cook the bread closer to an hour. The only bummer is that when I set the loaves outside to cool for 15 minutes, a racoon ran off with one of them! I guess even the woodland creatures liked it...

I also did not have strawberry extract and instead subbed a tiny bit of vanilla. This recipe turned out good, but I gave it three stars simply because I was hoping for a purer strawberry flavor and less "spice cake" flavor.  This is probably because I skipped the extract, so I will attempt it again with strawberry and maybe less cinnamon.

I've made this bread the past 2 Christmases for my gift baskets and always get rave reviews. It's so moist and I love the cinnamon flavor - it tastes so good with the strawberries. I'll be making this again this Christmas and for more Christmases to come.

I made this in a bundt pan and served it with whipped topping in addition to the strawberry sauce. I could not find strawberry extract, so I used almond extract instead. It required over an hour of baking, but was worth the extra time: So delicious and AMAZING served warm!

I'm not head over heels for this recipe. It is fine for a cinnamon style bread, but I really wish the strawberries would shine more. I put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top before serving and that seemed to help.

Took it for a Christmas potluck at church and everyone loved it. I have been asked to make it again for a friend. It was beautifully moist and tasted delicious.

My experience with this recipe wasn't good. The amount of oil seems excessive to me & my 2 mini loaves actually deep fried in the oven while the middle was raw & they baked for nearly 2hrs!  Very,very greasy, I didn't taste any strawberry at all & I can't recommend this one. Sorry:(

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen sweetened ones, and I think if they had been pre-sweetened that it would have been really overpowering.  I also used vanilla extract (I couldn't find strawberry extract anywhere), and it worked wonderfully as a substitute.  My bread also caved in the middle - and got kind of soggy in the center after I poured the "frosting" over it.  I'm not exactly a baker though, so I'm not sure what I did wrong.  However aesthetics aside, everyone loved it, and I would definitely make it again! :)

Right out of the oven, this was way too sweet. I love sweet foods, and this was just too much. I was about to toss the bread the next day, but instead tried more of it. It was much better on day two and three. We didn't have any left on day three. I agree that the bread needs to be cooked a bit longer. I also used sugar instead of flour to prepare the pans. It makes the crust a bit crispy.

This bread is definitely more like a dessert bread, but very good.  However, its a little sweet for my liking, so I'll use less sugar next time.

Made exactly as stated, except for topping.  Tasted more like a cinnamon bread than strawberry, but still very good.  I had some this morning with my coffee.  I used clear strawberry extract, so I'm not sure if this took away from the expected pretty pink coloring , but mine was more brownish.  I probably won't make this again, as I'm not one to deviate from original recipes very much.
