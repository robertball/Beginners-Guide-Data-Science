This recipe is awesome. Yes, it is the lazy American version...hence, easy and quick to make with lots of flavour.  Who wants to spend all day in the kitchen anyway?  I couldn't stop with just one serving.  In addition, the mold holds up well, while at the same time melting in your mouth.  I found using canned fruit cocktail made it easier to eat, as the pieces of fruit were not too large for eating.  It was a hit with the crowd as well.  A nice sweet dessert but not so rich, like cheesecake.
