11.1.16  I let the bay leaf sit in the rice vinegar dressing for about 30 mins, and its flavor infused and gave good flavor to the dressing.  I used an English cucumber (didnâ€™t have Japanese) and just cut up a tomato (no grape tomatoes on hand).  I loved the crunch and that little bit of heat that you get from the daikon radish.  This is a nice salad and one that you can eat guilt-free!
