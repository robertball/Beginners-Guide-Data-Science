This is a really good snack mix that my whole family enjoyed.  As others did, I replaced the Ramen noodles with Cheerios, although I think that it would be just as good with the noodles.  I also omitted the raisins because Iâ€™m not a big raisin fan and added extra almonds.  Since the recipe does say it is a cinnamon snack mix, I added cinnamon to the butter and honey mix.  I lined the pan with foil and sprayed with Pam for an easy clean up.  I stirred the mix twice while it was in the oven.  The Teddy Grahams do burn easy. Thanks for a great recipe!  Will definately be making again.

Good entertainment snack, if you have spare 20 min to make it.  For more adult version w/ less sugar - Change corn chex cereal for honey graham cereal, change bears for crushed up graham crackers, change raisins for cashews, no OJ, dash of cinammon and pinch of light brown sugar.  Keep stirring honey-butter to prevent burning, less than 3min its melted and ready to pour over mix.  Use foil on baking sheet for easy removal, cooks fast in oven so watch for browning.  A sweet and delicious snack, not to be indulged too often if watching your figure!

I used Chex instead of the Ramen noodles, and yogurt covered raisins instead of the golden raisins. That added a pleasant surprise to the treat! I added cinnamon to the honey/butter mix, and next time I'll use 1/4 c. honey. Definitely a good mix!

Fun recipe Sara!  I made this as a suprise for my son who was still in bed at the time.  I added some cheerios and left out the raisins.  I used 1 packet of ramen noodles and added a dash of cinnamon to the butter mixture like the previous reviewer.  I stirred it a little during baking to prevent any burning.  A really great snack for the kids...thanks for sharing.

Huge hit! Easy enough for my daughter to participate and tasty enough to be making many times in the future! I also used chex cereal in place of the ramen noodles and added a dash of cinnamon to the honey/butter mix. We've been snacking on this since it was pulled out of the oven...you just can't stop! Also, I think you mix & match a variety of cereals...which I may try in the future! Thanks so much Sara!

This is a great recipe.  It's quick and easy to make.  I would encourage to stir the mix during baking to prevent burning.  The first time I made it people were asking for the recipe.

Since the very first time I made this, I get regular requests from my husband and children to make it again.  It really is a *wonderful* recipe and I'm continuously getting asked for the recipe!

However, I also had trouble with it burning on top, so I stir it a little 1/2 way through.

At first, I thought the ramen noodles was a little weird but you know, it totally works. I substituted a full cup of salted roasted peanuts instead of almonds and Craisins instead of golden raisins only because that was what I had on hand. I also used cinnamon Goldfish crackers. This was very easy and turned out really tasty. This will make a great snack for me at work and the kids, who have already had some, love it.

Very quick and easy for a fun treat that adults and kids will eat.  It made a lot but it was eaten up in a matter of days.  My husband loved it.  Very versatile, you could easily use other types of snacks or cereals.

Oh so tasty!  This was a hit at Bunco and very easy to make.  I used cinnamon graham cracker sticks broken up rather than the bears (cheaper!).

I made this to include in a care package for my niece in college.  Loved the combination of items, I used honey nut cheerios and craisins as others suggested.  It was kind of sticky, I don't know if maybe I needed to bake it longer, but it was still very good.

I don't see how you can call it Cinnamon Snack Mix...very disappointing if you follow recipe. Add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and its not bad, however I prefer the Cinnamon Chex mix recipe.

YUM! I substituted the teddy grahams with honey nut cheerios and used craisins instead of golden raisins. Also, since I was making this for Valentine treats, I added a cup or so of Valentine colored M&Ms. Very good, but not too sweet like other snack mixes.

WOW! This is sooooo good! Excellent! I added cinnamon to the honey mixture and added some peanuts.Can just imagine the raves from my church group when they sample this! A new fav. in this house! Oh yes, turn your oven to 275F and bake 40 minutes, stirring every 10 min. DO NOT BAKE AT 375F!

The teddy grahams and graham cereal burned.  I would stir the stuff around halfway thru baking.  I also used regular raisins, because I always thought golden raisins were gross when I was a kid!  Plus, I was a little confused that there was no cinnamon in the recipe...I figured it was an omission and added some.

This is a wonderful recipe! With a few changes, it won my little sister a blue ribbon in a "Create with Ramen Noodles" contest! Here are the changes I made: I used craisins instead of the golden raisins (this gave it more color!) 2 cups of pretzel goldfish, 1 cup of honey nut cheerios and 2 cups of golden graham cereal for the full amount of golden graham cereal, and I also omitted the orange juice. It turned out beautifully, and the judge couldn't stop commenting on how unusual and delicious it was! Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

Very addictive and delicious!  I substituted Cheerios for the teddy bears, and added a few shakes of cinnamon before it went in the oven.  I love the ramen noodles in it, they add a super crunchiness.  I will be making this again.

Wow, I made this and handed it out for work and oh my gosh, everyone asked for the recipe.  It was addictive and so so so good that I will make it often for friends and family.  I did alter it by adding marshmallows and peanuts.  Baked it at 250 for 40 min and the marshmallows didnt burn.  Also, added 1/2 cup lite corn syrup and 1/2 cup brown sugar with a dash of cinnamon to the glaze.  Tried it without the added ingredients the first time cooking it and I didn't feel that it "clumped" enough, so tried some changes and got huge raves, thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

This is a FANTASTIC snack mix recipe!  I did substitute Cheerios and Rice Chex cereal for the Ramen Noodles.  I also added cinnamon to the butter/honey sauce, as suggested by other people.  I will keep this recipe and make it in the future....thanks for the great recipe Sara!

This is a great snack for adults and kids.  I didn't have any orange juice, so I used 1 tsp. of orange extract and it worked great.

Very tasty, and surprisingly not too sweet like I thought it would be - I think the ramen noodles help tone down some of the sweet cereal.  I did not have golden raisins, and my regular raisins looked too dried out to go in the oven, so I omitted them and added dried blueberries after the fact - it was very good!  I might have used slightly less cereal, but the same butter/honey/juice and added a dash of cinnamon to that.  Increased baking time by about 5 minutes until golden.  Some pieces were a bit soft, but that was probably because I adjusted the amount of cereal.

I made this for my family of 4 so I cut the recipe in half. But once I put the coating on it stil seemed a little dry so I made the other half of the coating the recipe originally called for but kept the dry stuff the same; this worked really well. Also the second time I was a little heavy handed with the honey & OJ, which helped get them as "wet" as I wanted. A previous reviewer said the teddy grahams got soggy, I think this is because they let the mixture sit too long out of the oven, also if they tasted it right away they might not have dried out yet. I let mine sit over night and everything was crunchy again.   I did make some other adjustments: I used a mix of cheerios & oatmeal squares instead of honey grahams, I used regular raisins since I already had them, I added a little cinnamon since I think the poster may have forgotten it in the recipe and I ommited the almonds because I didn't have any.  It turned out REALLY REALLY tasty. I know I'm going to finish the whole bag tonight :) Very cute for the kids and a lot of room to tailor to suit your tastes. Give it a shot!! Oh and by the way i noticed a lot of people left out the ramen, I thought it really added something different to the recipe and the noodles tast great in there, don't be shy about using them!

Very good, I added 1tbsp. cinnamon and used shreddies instead of ramen noodles.  I stirred it a few times while baking to mix the flavor again. Smelled so good while baking!!

My only problem is the name of this recipe. There's no cinnamon in it! Honey Graham snack mix would be a better name. Otherwise yummy!

I think this recipe would have still received 5-stars from me even if I hadn't tinkered with it. However, I did make changes since it was for a school party. Like others, I substituted cheerios for the ramen noodles. I substituted 1 1/2 cups mini marshmallows (added AFTER baking) for the almonds. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I too thought that since it was in the name it should be in the recipe. Since others were reporting that it was getting too brown in the oven, I turned my oven temperature WAY down to 250 degrees. I left the mix in for 45 minutes, stirring at 15 min. intervals, until most of the moisture had been absorbed so it wouldn't come out soggy. It was a hit with the kids. I will definitely be using this again. Thanks!

My only complaint was the teddy grahams got really soft and broke apart after I took the mix out of the oven.  Next time I'll add them after baking. I skipped the ramen noodles only because the idea kinda scared me but maybe next time I'll be braver.

I make a HUGE batch of this to tide us over the holiday season when people drop in.  It's a fun snack.  The recipe, of course, is supposed to have cinnamon, so I add some to taste.  I also cook it long enough to get the noodles to brown, and add the raisins AFTER cooking.

I made this a few years ago as a homemade gift for my grandmother... she LOVED it!  She made me give her the recipe and has been making it on a regular basis ever since.  I don't remember the changes I made other than to add a sprinkling of cinnamon and to stir halfway through (and I believe I actually used the ramen noodles).  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a party at my daughters day care so I changed things a little.  I omitted the almonds and ramen noodles, but added other cereals.  Turned out great!!  Almost had to make another batch since we couldn't keep our hands off it.

A big hit at a 2 year old's teddy bear birthday party! I replaced the ramen noodles with chow mein noodles, the raisins with dried blueberries, and omitted the almonds.  The kids' eyes lit up when I told them this is what teddy bears snack on.  Thanks for the great idea!!!

I used Keebler's bug shaped cinnamon honey-graham crackers instead of Teddy grahams.  I also put Kix cereal in the mix.  Next time, I would put in  pretzels and salty peanuts for a sweet/salty snack.  I might also add more raisins.  They seemed few and far between.  The overall taste is great.

Everyone loved to snack on these, especially me!  Next time I will put it in for a little less time and make sure I stir it while it is baking, because some of it did get a little burned.

Very easy to make!  (Especially since my 11 year old daughter did it ALL!)  We doubled the recipe, used 5 c. honey grahams cereal and 5 cups Cinnamon graham cereal.  Omitted the ramen replaced with cheerios.  I cut back on honey like suggested by one user and although good, I would have like more honey taste.  Because of the large quantity, had to bake several batches on cookie sheets for appx. 6-7 minutes each.  Family loves it and daughters classmates loved it!!!

Sticky! I made as written. Baked as written only stirring after 5 minutes. I dumped out on waxed paper to cool. It is very sticky and messy to eat. Not kid friendly. Maybe need to cut down on butter and honey or bake a little longer. I won't try it again though. I did not have problems with anything burning. Disappointed as it isn't cheap to make.

Nothing exciting, too much honey.  If fact, honey was the only thing you taste, needed more other flavors.

I usually will not review a recipe that I modified, but this turned out really good and was a real crowd pleaser. I substituted Apple Jacks cereal for the ramen noodles, Cinnamon French Toast cereal for the bear shaped cookies, and craisins for the raisins. I also added some white chocolate chips after it cooled. To keep it from burning, I stirred it every 2 minutes til it was done. Yummy!

Very delicious! I just made a second batch this week! My family absolutely loves this snack mix. I tweaked the second batch just a little because the recipe is great as is. I used Pepperidge Farm honey graham goldfish snacks instead of teddy grahams and I put in more ramen noodles than called for and left them in bigger bite sized pieces because they're very scrumptious! At first I wasn't sure how ramen would fit into a snack like this but apparently I underestimated the versatility of these noodles, they worked perfectly! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper.

I added regular raisins, added honey roasted almonds, and didn't put orange juice in. It turned out great.
