Be careful with this recipe.  It is very good and makes a beautiful presentation.  However, the flavor is very rich...a small serving will be plenty.  Would be great for Thanksgiving or some other special occassion.  Not something you would "whip-up" on a school night.  It's a keeper for when we have guests.

This was a big hit at a community pot luck.  I increased the squash to 5 cups and reduced the white sugar.  It was delicious and I'll be making it again.

I reduced the sugar as recommended to 1/3 cup. Came out great! (I reduced it to 1/4 cup the first time, but it didn't seem quite sweet enough.)

This was really tasty!  We get an abundance of squash from a farm share and end up cooking, pureeing and freezing tons of squash.  Usually I just add some butter or margarine and a little cinnamon.  This recipe was a great change!  I omitted the nuts due to food allergies and left out the nutmeg since I don't like it.  I also omitted the white sugar (I didn't increase the brown, just left it as is), and it was plenty sweet.  The combination of the squash, pineapple, brown sugar and cinnamon was delicious!  I'll definitely make this recipe again!

Try using different type squashes, even mashed yams.  I've even baked this with some sliced apples added to the squash.  A keeper, but cut back on the sugar or your guests will think it's dessert!

I thought the pineapple was a weird combo with the squash. I think I would use apple/applesauce instead.

Very good but did eliminate the white sugar as others had suggested.  Also lowered the amount of margarine.  Next time will reduce the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.

A wonderful dish.  I used the pecans and only the brown sugar.  Followed the rest the way is was suggested.  I wasn't wild about the brown color (I love the bright orange color of squash). Took it to a pot luck where some people thought it was a pecan pie and others were not sure but they really liked it.  So did I and my husband.  I'll make this again.

This dish has changed my feeling about squash! Finally at Thanksgiving we can all agree on one sqaush dish. This turned out so sweet and the texture was perfect. Kids and grown ups gobbled this right up!

This was fantastic!  My fiance said this was very similar to what he ate at Boston Market.  Apparently they have a butternut squash casserole too and he has never had anything close to it until now.  Thanks, Carolyn!  This is a keeper!

This was excellent!! I have never cooked butternut before so I peeled it, cut it in chunks, covered with water and cooked for one half hour. Followed the recipe except cut down on the sugare-then cooked it for 30 minutes at 400-will definitely be making this one again-Thanks for sharing, Carolyn

This tastes more like a dessert unless you cut the sugar about in half!  It was definitely a hit!  I added some cinnamon and brown sugar to the pecans on top before sprinkling them on and it made it nice and crunchy.  This will now be on my holiday menu!

I really liked this butternut squash recipe.  I had a huge butternut squash to use so I baked it in the oven first.  I scooped it out of its skin and added all the ingredients to my mixer.  I omitted the white sugar, used butter instead of margarine and put roasted pecans on the top before baking.  Otherwise I didn’t change a thing.  It was very tasty and I am giving it as a gift to a friend who has been hurt and can’t cook.  I am very pleased and proud to give this one away.  Thank you Carolyn for sharing.

This has quickly become a family favorite.    Everyone raves about this casserole!  And I have even made it in the crock pot--which makes it great for holidays when the oven is full!!!

I make a few changes to the recipe to decrease the sugar and fat content. I wasn't sure about the 3 cups of cooked squash, but I used one whole butternut squash and the can of pineapple as suggested. I then decreased the sugars to 1/8 of a cup of each, substituting each of the sugars with Splenda for baking (brown and white). I eliminated the butter completely and used pecans in lieu of the walnuts. It was excellent and my family loved it. Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made this recipe several times and I love it - but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I made a couple changes.  I cut back on the sugars -1/4 cup each instead of 1/2 cup.  On the cinnamon I only use 1/4 tsp.  I also sprinkle in a pinch or so of salt, that helps bring out the flavor.  Oh, and don't leave out the pineapple - that's the best part!

I loved this!! No one else in my family likes butternut squash so I got to enjoy it myself which is fine by me, this was so good and different.  I usually like butternut squash just plain but it was nice to try something different.  The pineapple added such a nice and unexpected flavor.  I used 5c squash like Ivy commented on and used the amounts listed for rest of the ingredients - I will definitely have this again. (I froze 1/2 of the leftovers for another time for myself)

I'm not a fan.  I baked according to the recipe, except for reducing the sugar (per many recommendations in the reviews), but it was just sort of lump of sweetened mush.  I'm looking for something special to bring to Thanksgiving, and this just wasn't it.

Thought I would try something new with the butternut.  Well I have just looked back to see what everyone else thought and was really surprised.  We had it last night..following recipe exactly except decreasing the sugar amount a bit. Being from the south, I thought we would enjoy it...but NO way will I waste my other stuff again to make it.  Truely sorry....

Easy to make ahead of time.  Has been a new holiday favorite (Thanksgiving and Christmas) plus has gotten more people to try butternut squash.  My husband's new favorite veggie dish.

Great recipe! I did one thing different. I used a fresh pineapple instead of a can of crushed. I  can't wait to make it again for the rest of the family.

This was very easy to make and my kids loved it. My husband even liked it (he hates pumpkin), perhaps because of the pineapple. I had to add extra pineapple for my kids. Texture a bit stringy, I may puree next time. Thanks!

I love this!  I had no choice but to substitute canned yams for half of the squash amount because my new dog, who can reach the counters, scarfed down half my roasted squash when I wasn't looking :).  Worked just fine with the yams fillin' in, maybe added another dimension in taste.  The pineapple was the key to this for me.

Very tasty; but I only added 1/4 cup sugar altogether, and about 2T margarine; even at that it bordered on too sweet. I guess it depends on if you want a dessert or a side dish. Don't omit the pineapple - that makes the dish!

This recipe tastes great, and is very easy to make if you microwave the squash before trying to scoop it out -- don't forget to prick the squash with  a fork all over or it might explode! I also add about a half cup of flour before I put the squash in the pan to make it less soupy.

My family LOVED this recipe! I have lost about 60 pounds by following a dietician's plan. To stick with the lifestyle changes I have made, I used some minor adjustments to make it healthier. I used natural applesauce instead of the butter, and omitted the white sugar. I reduced the packed brown sugar to 1/3 cup. With the pineapple and applesauce, we thought that the recipe had plenty of sweetness, but definitely less sugar and fat.

Sorry, but I just didn't really care for this.  I guess I didn't get enough of a flavor boost to warrant all that sugar.  I'll just roast it next time.

This is a great recipe, especially if you enjoy butternut squash.  A helpful tip:  One of the reviewers would prefer to use frozen butternut squash instead of a fresh one.  I'm not a culinary expert, but try cooking the squash first.

This was AMAZING! I loved this recipe! This was the first time that I ever made butternut squash and although I found it hard to cut the squash in order to cook it, this was a very easy recipe and came out yummy. I just wish that I could find frozen butternut squash in the grocery store instead of having to buy fresh!

I put in about 5 cups of butternut squash and used pecans rather than walnuts.  It was awesome.  Definitely would make it again...my whole family liked it.

This recipe is excellent on it's own or as a bare bones to build on. I have found it extremely fun to experiment with and have always had success. I think 4 years ago I added this to my favorites and time and time again it has never failed. My wife likes it a little less sweet and I prefer an insane amount of pecans. Very good recipe.

Very tasty recipe. I cooked the squash then put all of it together in a crockpot and cooked it a few hours for Christmas dinner (minus the nuts). It turned out great.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and what a hit it was. I microwaved the squash for 5 min, and it was very easy to peel and cut. After boiling the squash for 15 min, I used a hand mixer to mash it. I modified the ingredients and mounts, as I didn't want a sweet vegetable. I omitted the white sugar, but added 1/3 cup of brown sugar. I drained the can of pineapple, and put the juice aside, as i didn't use it. I used less the amounts called for when adding the cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.I omitted the nuts.  I put it in the 2 qt casserole, and baked 40 min at 325. My family loved it, and I plan on making it for Christmas too.

Great recipe!  I did follow others' suggestions and drain the pineapple, as well as omit the white sugar.  It was plenty sweet enough with just the brown sugar!

I agree with others and only used 1/8c of sugars and same with butter instead of margerine. I omitted the pineapple completely and decreased all other spices by 1/2 and it was still sweet and tasty enough.

Too much cinnamon or nutmeg. Rough texture. Omitted white sugar so it wasn't so sweet. Will not make again.

I brought this to a large outdoor Thanksgiving party - it was gone by the time I made it around the serving table.  The little bit I was able to scrape up from the bottom of the pan was amazing....and everyone who tried it raved about it too!

My favorite squash casserole and very easy to prepare. Minor changes: I only used the 1/2 cup brown sugar, not the white. I also drained the pineapple. And I always use sweet butter instead of margarine. Excellent.

Skipped the White sugar as everyone called for.  Definitely sweet enough without it!!

My 3 year old could not get enough of it!!!  Definitely a repeat!

This recipe was very good. I omitted the sugars and just used the pineapple to sweeten it. Having it for breakfast right now. :)
