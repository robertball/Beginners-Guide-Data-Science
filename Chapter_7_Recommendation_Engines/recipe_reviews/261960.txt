Looked for a recipe using ground turkey and pasta and found this.  I was intrigued by the large quantities of spices, which we love.  Yummy!  I did add a can of well rinsed mushroom slices because I felt it needed mushrooms and it was too late to cook up fresh ones.  I needed to add a 1/4 cup of water to the initial mixture as it was going to stick. Cooked down quickly and I added our left over, already cooked rotini.  This was an excellent meal that we will make again.

Really liked this.. nice way to jazz up jarred sauce.  I wasnt sure about cinnamon and cumin, but it worked.  Use a good sauce for best results

I used whole wheat penne pasta and made it into a bake. After adding the sauce to the turkey mix and letting it simmer the 10 minutes. I  then put half into a lightly sprayed casserole dish, topped with shredded mozzarella.  I layered the remaining mix on top and topped with more mozzarella cheese.  I baked in a pre-heated 400Â° oven for about 20 minutes.

We liked it, but the seasoning was a bit heavy. Way too salty.

This has become a go-to for me.  It's so easy and quick to make.  We love spicy food, so I use Emeril's Kicked Up Tomato as the sauce.  I did make a couple of alterations:
1.  The recipe as written is too salty for my taste, so instead of a tablespoon of salt, I use 2 teaspoons
2.  I add a sliced carrot to it to add a little sweetness
3.  This is a super-hearty sauce, so instead of serving it over pasta, we eat it over brown rice.  I made it with pasta once and felt like I could barely move afterward!

I give this mess 0 stars.  It was awful!!  The spices were overpowering.  I even used more turkey and onion and could not taste anything but the combination of spices.  I could not eat it.  My husband ate a little but most went into the disposal.
