This recipe makes a wonderful, tasty, satisfying drink.  My wife and I made it for our first baby shower and all those we tried it enjoyed it immensely.  The subtle blending of the multiple flavours work wonderfully together.  I was skeptical about adding the tea, but was pleasently surprised at it's non overpowering presense, instead it brought the taste of the fruit even more to the forefront.  I would reccomend this recipe to anyone looking for a drink to satisfy all.  Plus with it's added attraction of the fresh fruit floating on top, it makes an eye pleasing addition to any table.  It's a fruit salad in your glass!

Very good.  A very chunky drink.
