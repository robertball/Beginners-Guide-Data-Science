excellent flavour - we are nightshade-veggie-intolerant here, so we left out the peppers & onions.    the sauce was involved but quite (quite!) tasty and the cinnamon at the end adds an unexpected depth of flavour to the dish.  i added about 1 extra cup of water to the sauce, as it was too thick for the amount of meat i had on hand.  despite that, the flavour was intense and quite amazing.  well done!  :)
