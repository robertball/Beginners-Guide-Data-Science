Liked it.  Refreshing.  I used feta cubes.  Next time would ensure feta bigger so it did not flake off the tooth pick.

We loved this! My mom gave me some cubed watermelon, so I just used that and I also opted to use balsamic glaze b/c I had some on hand from another recipe. The flavors were great! This is a definite keeper for the summer~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Nice twist on the traditional caprese appetizer that is made with cherry tomatoes. The watermelon adds a nice pop of freshness, and it really does pair well with the mozzarella, basil and balsamic vinegar. I did use a balsamic glaze that I had on hand, which really adds a nice sweetness. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe! It was my first time using watermelon instead of tomatoes. Very refreshing and everyone enjoyed it.

This was very good and refreshing! And for a non-tomato eater I was finally able to enjoy a caprese appetizer. :-)

This recipe is amazing, first thing to go at any summer get together. We love basil so we use bigger basil leaves and fold them in half, set between the mozzarella and watermelon.  You gotta try this!
