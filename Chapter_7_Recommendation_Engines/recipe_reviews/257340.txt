as a quiche lover, this looks absolutely horrible.  my tastebuds just threatened to go on strike if I spent one more second considering this recipe.  Does Johnsonville (apparently an endorsed sponsor here) hire "chefs" to come up with these concoctions and drop them all here to see what sticks?  Please, Allrecipes, stop with the sponsored recipes of the day, and stick to ones that have already rated favorably.
