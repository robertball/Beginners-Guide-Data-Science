All right - Health Police - back off right now!  This is GREAT pie crust - tender - flakey - everything a pie crust should be.  Besides - I would rather eat lard or butter than hydrogenated  shortening.  I used this for chicken pot pie.  It is a keeper!  I doubled the recipe for a top and bottom crust.  Note - freeze the lard in small cubes.    I made this in the food processor, with short pulses - blended the flour and salt - added the lard - pulse - then added the egg and vinegar mixed together - pulse and then about 2 teaspoons of water.  This will be my go to recipe for the holiday baking season.  :)

This is the only pie crust - same as my mother made - my sisters make & I make.  Please remember that "lard" is natural - no artifical junk like - Crisco - shortening - corn oil - thats what will harden your arteries. Not that lard is "good" for you - but lard and butter are better than that other stuff.

This recipe has great potential but I had to dock it a star because it should have called for water in the ingredients in the first place and not just "add it if you need it."  It definitely needed it, a good tablespoon, and because I added only a teaspoon or so at a time I ended up working the dough a little more than I should have.  But it is definitely worth making again as the egg contributes richness and flavor and the vinegar is known to contribute flakiness.

Super freakin' easy for someone who's admittedly crust stupid. I did chill this dough overnight so it would be ready for what I needed today. I used this as the bottom crust for the Dutch Apple Pie with Oatmeal Streusel. Came out great! I'll use this again.

This is tender, tasty, and very easy to make.  It even comes out well when you accidentally add a tablespoon of vinegar instead of a teaspoon like I did. :)

My grandmother back in Iowa summers used to make this crust for all her pies and they were the very best pies ever.The lard adds a wonderful oldtime taste.

This is not bad, but there are a couple of mechanical issues with this recipe as written. I had to add more lard, there just wasn't enough for all the flour. I used 1/2 cup lard, which is still less than the general pie-making guideline and half fat to flour ratio. I even added more than 1 tsp vinegar and needed more than 1 tbsp water. Also, I think the egg would be easier to mix in if it were pre-beaten. The recipe sounded like it wanted the egg as in added into the flour mixture and by doing this it wasn't as easy to bring together and the yolk was hard to distribute it evenly. I do agree with other reviewers that this was super easy to roll out, and I have no complaints about the taste. I think though I'll stick with my favourite recipe for next time - Grandma's Secret Pie Crust on this website. Similar to this one but comes together more easily. Thanks anyway

This was SO EASY to roll out, I can't believe the difference compared to shortening.  Very tasty with my chicken pot pie!

Once again I've found a winner! This crust was easy to make, easy to work with, and of course most importantly-Delicious! My elderly neighbor told me a few ingredients in her coveted crusts so I did some searching and this is the closest I've found to it and so good it is!

I tried this recipe with the fresh rhubarb pie recipe on this site and I didn't think it tasted very good. I don't think that I liked using the lard.  Will go back to my old pie crust recipe.

Made this crust with peach pie recipe from this site and it was excellent. My son said it was the best peach pie he's ever eaten, and he doesn't like peach pie!  Light and flaky, just like grandma used to make.

This is an excellent pie crust!  I have always prided myself on my  flaky pie crust because of all the praises I recieved BUT after trying this pie crust I see that I have been bested.  Not only is it easier to work with, it is tastier and results in a wonderful flaky crust.

Used this crust to make sweet potato pie.
In a deep pie dish, and the crust came out perfectly.  Each slice stood up on their own, and the back wall of the crust kept it's form, but wasn't dry.  People at work loved the pie, and especially the crust!

I have been looking for this exact recipe for years, finally found it and it is "To Die For". Using my food processor, and beating the egg and vinegar together, just made it easier! Takes zero time to make it, and making a double batch for two pies, the lard/flour:liquid ratio works great. I only used 1 teas. ice water. I use this recipe also for Mexican empandas. Perfect pie crust. AND I totally agree, lard is the best for crust! THANK YOU!   Missing the time for baking for a pre-baked crust though. No adjustment in time from an original butter or Crisco crust.

Did not roll well at all probably wouldn't use it again... Was very bitter and had a very strong vinegar taste.

This was the easiest and flakiest crust ever. Perfect recipe and I am not a baker. I like a thick crust so I will double the recipe next time even if I do not need all of the dough. It was super easy to get from counter to pie pan. I used this for a chocolate mousse pie so I prebaked the crust. I cannot say enough good about this crust!! I have struggled making pie crust forever...not any more! Thanks!

Just like my mother used to make. I've used it for apple,blueberry and cherry pies. Everyone loves the pies but rave about the crust.
