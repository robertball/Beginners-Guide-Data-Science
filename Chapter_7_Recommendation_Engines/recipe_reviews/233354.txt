Yes it is a crowd pleaser and it could not be easier. Instead of tuna, I added small cut-up chicken from the grill and 1000 Island Dressing. I wanted to add veggies but I brought it to a pot luck with kids and the kids LOVED it since there was nothing green.

This is a good easy recipe. I added some California mix veggies and thinly sliced onion. Can also use low fat Italian dressing. I also made this with ham and/or chicken.

This is super easy and tastes OK. Way too bland for me, and that was after adding vegetables as the cook's notes indicate. (I took my picture before adding any extras.) I added red onion, red bell pepper, peas and black olives. It tasted much better after I added another can of tuna, cracked black pepper, Italian seasoning, a few splashes of vinegar and some cheddar cheese chunks. Thank you for the recipe idea though--my husband wants me to make it again with all the add-ins.

As is I think it would have been bland. But gave me starter recipe. Added a bunch of spices (garlic, dill, Italian seasoning, pepper, onion powder). Diced in red onion and red bell pepper for color, flavor and texture. Used a dressing I already had, a basil and balsamic vinaigrette. Easy and delicious, great for a hot evening.

I made this as written and I'm sorry to say I did not like this at all. It tasted.like a bowl of pasta drowning in creamy Italian dressing. The dressing was all I could taste so I found it a.bit over whelming for my personal taste. However it definitely was super easy to make

Good and easy recipe. The only thing I added was cut up grape tomatoes.
