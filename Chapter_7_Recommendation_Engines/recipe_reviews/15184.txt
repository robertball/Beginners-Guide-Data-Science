I've made these many times and everyone loves them. They are not time consuming at all and can be made up two days before needed. Wash mushrooms and twist out stems. Drain in colander. Put mushroom caps on paper towels to drain well. Slice off woody part of stem and put in food processor. Pulse stems until minced. Add 1 Tlbs olive oil to pan and stir-fry minced stems and garlic (minced type from jar)until dry. Add spices. Slightly cool, but while still warm add  cheeses (and a can of drained crab if want). Put a plastic zip lock bag into a bowl and roll back sides- add cream cheese mixture. Snip off one corner and use as a pastry bag to fill mushrooms. If making ahead 1)use only freshest mushrooms you can find, 2)blot off excess water from mushrooms, 3)put them into a non-metalic dish. I sprinkle the tops with shreded (not grated )parmesan cheese. Cover well with plastic wrap and refrig. until ready to bake. (I've made up to two days in advance- without crabmeat though).

This is a favorite recipe that I have made several times and I never have any leftovers.  Even my young son loves the flavorfull filling. These are great to bring to get togethers.  I usually prepare the stuffing and put into a ziplock and assemble them when I arrive.  Just snip off the corner of the ziplock, fill the mushrooms like a pastry and pop in the oven. Adjustments I make are I add crabmeat to the mixture which I find adds a little more substance to an otherwise very creamy filling.  I like to sprinkle with parmesan cheese before putting them in the oven which adds a nice touch.  A trick I use is to use smaller mushrooms so there is a good balance between mushroom and the amount of filling.  I tried larger ones one time and it almost seemed like each bite was just a bit too full of creamy mixture.  I also lightly butter the mushrooms before baking which keeps them from drying out.  Last trick is I bake them in mini muffin tin pans.  They hold the smaller mushrooms perfectly and the pans keep the mushrooms from tipping over and rolling around.  The cayenne pepper gives just the perfect amount of kick to this recipe.

Great! A little time consuming, but worth it. I, too, added some chopped green onion while sauteeing and lightly brushed outside of mushrooms with melted butter laced with Ital. crumbs. Made almost 3 doz. reg. mushrooms! TIP: slice off bottem a little so they don't roll over.

Wow, these are ever so good exactly as written!!!  For my family's personal preference, I added the following....  16 oz of ground sausage, increased the Parmesan to 1/2 cup and the garlic to 1.5 tbsp, and then rolled the top of the stuffed mushrooms in the Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs prior to baking.  Created a great little crunch with wonderful oozy goodness underneath.  Absolutely divine!!!

I made for Christmas dinner appetizer and they were YUMMY! But i also read a lot of the reviews and took some of the advice (and left some). I rated accordingly since i changed it a bit. I used 12 large mushrooms (caps about 2" wide) as the recipe called for as well as the the whole pkg of cream cheese and it was just right. Next time, though, I will use bite size smaller mushrooms but double the amount of mushrooms to make it easier to eat as a appetizer. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and  added to the original ingredients for the filling: 2 stalks green onions (minced and cooked with the garlic and mushroom stems), a bit more parmesan (used fresh grated parmesano reggiano), a bit of garlic powder, 1 crisp, crumbled bacon and about a cup of cooked dungeoness crab. I dunked the mushroom caps in melted butter & lemon before filling, sprinkled with more parmesan and baked in a mini muffin pan. (Beware: if the mushrooms don't fit all the way into the muffin pan, they will come out shaped like muffins! It is kind of cute though.) Cooked for 20 mins and they came out beautifully! Everyone loved them! The parmesan topping gave it that extra crunch too! And love the heat the Cayenne leaves after you eat it. Will make (my new revised recipe again!) Thanks!

This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms and after reading several of the reviews I decided on how I would make mine. The full amount of cream cheese was enough for 24 mushrooms and I placed a bit of chopped proscuitto in the bottom of each mushroom before placing the cheese mixture on top (which was wonderful). I then sprinkled garlic and herb bread crumbs over them and drizzled melted butter over all. Baked for only 15 minutes and broiled for the last 5. They were wonderful. I plan on making these when my Mom and Grandmom come to visit in the fall. Thanks a bunch!

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the filling and used 24 oz fresh mushrooms and it filled them almost perfectly.  I also added  a dash of Worcestershire sauce while cooking the stems and 1/3 cup of crumbled bacon to the cream cheese mixture.  Just before baking, I sprinkled with breadcrumbs and dipped the mushroom caps in melted butter so that they wouldn't dry out.  I brought to Thanksgiving as an appetizer and they went in minutes.  Everyone loved the bite that the cayenne pepper added.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made these many times, and they always disappear so fast!  What a great recipe.  I put the stuffing into a ziploc bag with a corner cut off and squeeze it into the caps, it's less messy.  Thanks for sharing such a great treat!

Very good recipe! My husband gave it 2 thumbs up, which is HUGE. I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and added 1/4 cup or seasoned breadcrumbs, and cut the cream cheese to about 2/3 what the recipe called for. I also used 2 10oz pkgs of white mushrooms, or about double what the recipe specified. I'm sure adding crabmeat would've made it even better, but i don't think it needs it... i kept the recipe cheap, quick, and easy!

Very good.  If not using really large mushrooms, be sure to double up the mushrooms to 24, using just 12 stems, as the recipe calls for.  I had lots of filling left over.

Everyone loved these! They were a bit time consuming, but still very easy to make. I made them a day ahead of time and refrigerated them, then popped them in the oven for the last step. Yum!

Wonderful--gone in minutes at a party.  1st off, you need 30 button mushrooms (2 pkgs)...I read almost all the reviews, and can't understand who would put all that stuffing in 12 mushrooms.  They complained it was too cream-cheesy...use common sense.  How did anyone even do it...the mushrooms had to be falling over from being so top-heavy.  Second, I added about 10 chives (chopped), omitted the stems, topped with Italian breadcrumbs, and most importantly, tossed the mushrooms in a melted butter/1 tbs lemon juice mixture before stuffing and baking.  As a few suggested, use a Ziploc and cut off a small portion of the corner to stuff...you're done in no time and no mess.  They came out delicious.

I love these little guys. I have to process down to a science. I totally skip the chopping of the stems and cooking them up with garlic. I just throw out the stems. A little trick to keep them from sliding all over the tray is to pop the cookie sheet in the freezer for a few minutes. then after you fill the mushrooms, dip the bottom of the mushroom in melted butter and it will stick to the tray. magic!

I have made this several times and gotten rave reviews! And it is so easy to make! I always end up stuffing an entire package of mushrooms with the amount of filling this makes. I make sure to only include 12 of the stems in the mixture, though, and discard the rest. The last time I made this I mixed everything together as soon as the sauté mixture came off the stove. This really softened the cream cheese and made it much easier to manage. I also put the filling in a ziploc and cut off one edge and squeezed it into each shroom, which was super-easy and fast.

I was looking for something to make for us to snack on while cooking Thanksgiving dinner. I have made these many times, but felt it was too time consuming to make along with everything else! I decided to make a dip out of it by chopping 2 pints of baby portabella mushrooms and cooking as directed in the recipe. I mixed everything together in a small baking dish and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. WOW - it was incredible! I served it with butter crackers! I love the stuffed mushrooms, but will make the dip again if I am running low on time!
*Update - I just made these mushrooms again, omitting the oil (I used Pam instead) and used 4 oz. of light cream cheese and 2 tsp of Parmesan, to lower the fat content. They were still amazing!

Very good - did make some changes, however. First, I was out of cooking spray so I coated the cookie sheet with olive oil. I also used a food processor to mince the garlic and mushroom stems (much faster!) I used olive oil while sauteeing them instead of veg. oil. While mixing everything together, I decided that some LEMON JUICE would be a great addition and trust me, it was. It adds great flavor with the garlic and cayenne. I filled the mushroom caps pretty high... next time, I won't fill so high b/c I love the taste of mushrooms but there was so much filling it was a bit overpowering. The three people I made them for LOVED them, and the 24 mushrooms were gone pretty quickly. I will def. make this one again!

These were great! I changed the recipe slightly by dicing up some mixed dried mushrooms and soaking them in wine. I added a bit of the fresh mushroom stubs, too. I sauteed those in butter and garlic and added a little white wine as well. Then I mixed that with the cream cheese, parmesan cheese along with a touch of italian bread crumbs. Topped with a sprinkle of bread crumbs, cheese and a touch of butter. Cooking them in the mini muffin pan as someone suggested was a great idea. For easy stuffing of the mushrooms, I used a cookie press. I'll be making them agin...

These were delicious but I am pleased that I only used 1/2 the cream cheese because even overflowing with filling I had more than enough for the size mushrooms I had, about 1" across. If I had followed the directions I would have had way too much.

Fantastic! This recipe is a real crowd pleaser.  I tried not to overstuff and saved the extra in the freezer for a quick appetizer if company pops in.  After cutting off stems and preparing the filling, I put the mushrooms (upside down) on a paper towel and microwaved for 12 - 15 minutes. This removes the water and also lessens the cooking time from 25 minutes to 15 - 20 minutes in the oven.  My guests always request these tasty morsels when invited to our home for dinner!

I made these for a birthday party and never got to try one they went so fast.  Best ever is all I heard from everyone.  I followed the recipe as posted except for a tip I got from Cooks magazine.  After the clean and remove stem.  Arrange mushrooms gill side down on coffee filter-lined plate before microwaving to drain moisture from mushrooms.  Heat 5-10 min.  Allow mushrooms to cool before stuffing.  Mushrooms are more firm after baking.

Not bad.  Just the right amount of "bite" in the cream cheese mix.  The only problem I had was I had way too much filling, and I thought I followed the recipe exactly.  Might make these again if the occasion presents itself.

Very good! I brushed the mushroom tops with a bit of EVOO like another reviewer suggested and they didn't dry out or get wrinkly like has happened in the past. I had a few slices of prosciutto on hand, so I chopped them up and added them to the chopped stems and garlic, and sauteed all of it for a minute or two before combining with the cheeses. Fabulous! I don't think I would have liked it as much without the prosciutto or without sauteeing it all before stuffing, which is why I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5.

I made this recipe for a Christmas Eve dinner party with my friends. I chose it because I have both vegetarian friends and some with gluten-allergies. It was great to find one recipe to fit both dietary needs! I played with the recipe a little bit based on the pictures and my own taste. I doubled the receipe, and sauteed 2 large shallots with the stems and garlic. I added a bunch of sliced green onions into the cream cheese mixture. I actually had forgotten to purchase parmesan cheese prior to making this, so I only had about a tablespoon left. I put that in the filling and proceeded to fill the caps. The next day, I bought the parmesan and covered each mushroom with cheese before baking. These were DIVINE. Everyone except my non-cream-cheese-eating boyfriend loved them. My veg friend even ate one before they were baked and said they were delightful. They're a bit of work (all stuffed mushrooms are) but they are so delicious! AWESOME recipe!

Excellent.  Here's our variation:  Fry 2 strips of thickly cut maple bacon.  Keep the grease (in replacement of the 1 tbsp of veg. oil), set bacon strips aside on paper towel.  Finely chop/mince about 3 tbsp of white onion (yellow would work too).  After I chopped a clove of garlic, it looked to be a little less than the 1 tbsp called for, but still potent enough to do the job for a garlic lover.  The pack of mushrooms we bought had 18 "above average" sized mushrooms.  After frying the garlic, onion, and 12 of the chopped mushroom caps in the leftover bacon grease, we allowed it to cool off, then added the softened cream cheese (8 oz), the 1/4 cup of parm, and the bacon that I had chopped into bits, then added the 1/4 tsp cheyenne, black pepper, AND added 1/4 tsp sea salt bc I noticed it hardly contains any salt outside of the bacon I added and the Parmesan.  Then, mixed it with a wooden spoon and stuffed the 18 medium-large mushrooms I had.  There was still enough stuffing left (after being quite generous) to fill about 3 more mushrooms.  So, if you are making 24, this will certainly do the job b/c I really overstuffed trying to use the stuffing up.  :)  Also, I dipped caps in butter, used glass pan @ 350.  Superb!  The REAL onions are a MUST bc of the flavor and texture it adds.  The first time I ever had stuffed mushrooms, someone had made it using a Lipton Onion Soup mix, which was wonderful, but when I made it the pouch seemed too salty, but doing it manually is perfect.

THUMBS UP!  A GREAT RECIPE!  I did add some chopped green onion and a dash or two of Worcestershire per other reviews.  They were tasty and spicy...might add less cayenne when I make them again, but I absolutely loved them!  Thanks!

These mushrooms are amazing!  Just made some minor changes, as I don't like wet stuffings for my mushrooms, so I added a bit more cheese and a little panko bread crumbs as well to the mixture.  I also ended up using the mixture for a total of 30 mushrooms and it was the perfect ratio.  I dipped the mushrooms with filling into panko breadcrumbs and drizzled melted butter as one other viewer had suggested.  AMAZING!!!  This will definitely be on our future appetizer list!!

I took these to a dinner party, and I kid you not they were gone within 10 minutes. Everyone was asking me for the recipe. I was thinking if they are that good do I want to share? :)  I took the advice of another and added bacon, I also added some parsley. They are very easy to make.  Thank you for the recipe!

I stuck to the recipe, used small mushrooms and some prosciutto and these turned out very good!  I made the stuffing a few nights in advance and prepared the mushrooms the day before serving.  Everybody loved them!  If you like spice, definitely add more cayenne.  I wouldn't make this recipe with large mushrooms though because the filling is quite creany..

This is the first time I have ever attempted to make stuffed mushrooms and they were great! There was NO leftovers at my house! There easy, fast, and budget friendly. I did read a lot of the reviews to see what other people did. The most common tip I saw was to dunk the mushrooms in a combo of melted butter and a Tbsp of lemon juice. This was great as it added a little extra kick and kept the mushrooms from drying out. Also I added a dash of Worcestershire and a little bit of chopped green onion. These will definitely be on the table for Thanksgiving this year!

This was so yummy, people couldn't stop eating and commenting on them! This made about 30 or so medium and smallish mushrooms ( I bought a package of Crimini mushrooms at Cosco and used it all up). I read reviews and added chopped green onion to the mushroom stems and garlic as I sauteed them in olive oil. I used both grated and shredded parmesan and left out onion powder as I couldn't find mine, but the green onions made up for it. The cayenne pepper gave it the right kick, and not too spicy. I meant to brush with melted butter as suggested but forgot, and still turned out great. Remember these really shrink in the oven, almost to half-size. I did not top with bread crumbs for gluten-free needs and everyone was happy. Thank you very much. I will try next time with crab.

Everytime I make them, I eat them all!!! 
Reminds me of this great Greek Restaurant I get mushrooms from.
Hint: make extra sauce by adding olive oil,and some more cheese. Bake with the mushrooms and dip fresh french bread into the sauce.

These were good. I did think that they had a bit to much parmesan cheese though, that was basically my only dislike about them, other than the parmesan cheese, they were pretty good, Thanks for this.

I liked this recipe. iI used half cram cheese and half chèvre, omitted the garlic, and included 1/2 pound of cooked sausage. They'd also be very good with blue cheese and cream cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

As much as I wanted to like this recipe, it just didn't happen.  The flavors did not blend well.  It was way too spicy.  I had a lot left over.  I wound up abandoning the stuffing and cutting up the mushrooms for another recipe.  There are so many recipes for stuffed mushrooms that better suit my family & friends' tastes, that it is not worth messing around with this one to make it more palatable for us.  I won't be making it again.

THESE MUSHROOMS ARE GOURMET RESTAURANT QUALITY.  I always double the filling recipe and buy a huge container of mushrooms from Costco or a wholesale retailer to make a ton, and there are never any leftover!  I've made this recipe just as-is, and I've also made it numerous times adding lump crab meat (don't buy a cheap can...the $3+ cans aren't bad, but anything that costs less than that is disgusting).  The crab ones are always the most popular.  I also add tons of shredded mozzarella cheese that give it a cheesy texture.  Bake these longer than the directions say, however, until they're tender, hot, and have started to release water in the bottom of the pan.  I often buy disposable aluminum pans to bake these in and take them to parties - THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS FLAVORFUL RECIPE!!

This is the first time I made stuffed mushrooms,
and I was not impressed by this receipe. The 
bottom of the mushrooms were so wet and the 
filling was not very tasty. I will not make these
again.

One of my favorites.  Every one loved them.  I roll the mushrooms in panko crumbs after stuffing.  I place the stuffing in a zip loc bag, snip the tip, and use like pastry bag to fill the mushrooms.  Yummy.

These mushrooms truly are mouth-watering! The cream cheese mixture had just the right amount of spice and flavor without overpowering the mushrooms. Tip: I served these as an appetizer for a dinner party & used small-medium sized mushrooms. They were small enough to pop in your mouth and the size prevented them from oozing all over the place (which makes them harder to serve). Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I poured through the reviews and listened to the suggestions before making this.  Tasty, not OMG amazing.  My son liked it very much.  Changes I made:  sauteed in olive oil, not vegetable oil.  Added finely sliced green onions after cooking stems and garlic.  Used chive/onion flavored cream cheese and omitted onion powder.  Added about 1/3 cup bacon bits and extra shredded parmesan cheese.  Didn't have cayenne pepper, so added a very small amount of buffalo wings sauce.  Filled caps with filling to barely above level with the top of the mushroom, dipped in panko bread crumbs and then lightly sprinkled with extra grated parmesan.  Baked thirty minutes, and broiled for the last couple.  This way, the cream cheese flavor was not overpowering, and you could really taste the mushroom.  I used medium-sized mushrooms, so a knife and fork were necessary.

I made these but I'm used to making with breading type stuffing and herbs and a little prosciutto and those are fantastic.  I made this with 4 times the ingredients and 48 mushrooms.  I had at least 10 oz of cream cheese mix left over.  Too much. And that was with generous filling.  I used Fat Free cream cheese.  All in all, the recipe is mostly cream cheese!  That's all you taste and it sits like lead in your gut 2 hours later.  Never again.  I would ditch the cream cheese and go with a bread crumb filling.  Far less fat.  Only people who "love" cream cheese will like this.  Or, maybe cut the cream cheese in half and add bread crumbs to the other half.  Might work.

I made these tonight for a family get together. I instead of adding onion powder to the mix like the recipe called for, I added garden onions to the skillet with the garlic and mushroom stems. I didn't add quite as much cayenne pepper, but THEY WERE A HIT!!! They had just the right kick and everyone kept asking "Who made the mushrooms!!" I absolutely recommend this recipe to anyone wanting to change it up a bit.

These were a Big hit at poker night!!! They were gone in no time!!! I made them according to the directions and then sprinkled a Italian bread drums on top of each on. I had extra filling after the mushrooms were filled and it made an Excellent spread on Ritz Crackers.  If you are having trouble mixing the ingredients with the cream cheese a hand blend works wonderfully!!!

I don't eat these but everyone who has ever tried them loves them.  I add lump crab meat and dip each mushroom in melted butter then pour melted butter into the bottom of the baking pan.  Also I like to top with either crushed Triscuits or seasoned panko.

These are man approved! My hubby and all his construction employees devoured them. They particularly liked the hit of spice. Only change I made was to saute some onions and shallots with the minced stems. Made the filling a couple of days ahead and piped the caps from a zip-lock the day of. Took no time at all. Needed a bit more salt, but other than that - perfection!

These were so good!  I only made 8 because I was afraid they'd turn out weird, but they were delicious!  My friends were impressed and wanted more.  I added a little more garlic, and added 1/2 the amount of parmesan and the same amount of plain breadcrumbs.  They were easy to make, and I'll make them again for a snack, I just pop them right in my little toaster oven!  Thanks!

These are delicious - went fast at Thanksgiving dinner and made again for a holiday party and they were a hit.  I did a couple things recommended by other reviewers. 1. sliced a small amount off the bottom of mushroom to keep it from rolling on the pan. 2. dipped the mushrooms in butter prior to filling (be sure to slice the bottoms first, lol or they will be slippery)! 3. topped with panko bread crumbs mixed with a little melted butter (I think I maybe used 1/4 cup or less of crumbs).  I also kind of patted them down after putting on the crumbs.

I adore stuffed mushrooms, unfortunately most of my family don't really care for mushrooms of any sort. I decided to take a chance and made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer. I followed the recipe with a couple of changes, I added bacon to the filling, and I dipped the mushroom caps into bread crumbs. I was able to make these up two days ahead of time, covered with saran wrap and popped them in the oven right before guests arrived. They came out perfect, the plate was emptied in no time and even the non-mushroom eaters were devouring these, not a single one left, and I doubled the recipe!

i must say, i made the recipe as directed (with the addition of scallops), and was kinda dissapointed. very one dimensional flavour. i think it was the cream cheese. not much excitement to the meal. i dunno, maybe i was expecting more considering the raves it recieved on this website.

Since I had never made these before and planned on taking them to a Christmas party, I made a batch as an experiment to check the seasonings. I followed the recipe exactly and while they were good (even better the day after), I feel they do need a little more flavor. I will add some chives or green onion, maybe some crab meat and definitely some bread crumbs. The amount of cayenne pepper was fine for me. The filling was enough for 24 baby bella mushrooms which were the perfect bite size. Putting the filling in a baggie to pipe the filling into the mushrooms was an excellent idea. Thanks!

I know I'm the odd-ball here but, I really didn't think these were that great. I've had much better stuffed mushrooms. I think the parmesan cheese was a bit overwhelming.

These are some of the best stuffed mushrooms I've tasted. I make these as an appetizer when we entertain and guests always ask for the recipe. So easy, yet so flavorful! Just the right amount of spicyness.

Awesome!  Everyone raved about these.  The cayenne really adds a kick.  If you're doing these for a crowd not accustomed to spicy food, you'll probably want to cut the cayenne at least by half.  Dipped mine in a mix of bread crumb and parmesan.  Just couldn't get enough of them.  Made a lot more than just 18-20 - I used 3 - 8oz packages of button mushrooms.

I made these on Thanksgiving along with 2 other kinds of stuffed mushrooms and these were pretty much last to go, in fact there were alot left.  They were good & I liked the little zing, but they didn't compare to the others.  Thanks Angie ;)

I did not like these at all. The "stuffing" was very mushy, as were the mushrooms. And the taste was extremely sour.

Even with my adjustments I give this recipe 5 stars.  I have to leave out the black and red pepper.  I use dried Basil in stead.  I also use diced onion in place of the onion powder.  Cook the onion a bit before putting in.  I really like these made with the baby Portobello's.

I did not care for this recipe. The cream cheese overpowered the mushroom taste. I prefer more of a bread crumb/mushroom filling. I had used 23 (large pkg of mushrooms) and cut the cream cheese in half and had enough filling, just didn't care for the taste. Definitely not a keeper for me.

I made these tonight and they were great! I left out the onion powder because I didn't have any but it was still very tasty! I used 1 package of whole mushrooms which was about 17 mushrooms and cut the cream cheese in half because I thought it would be too much. I overstuffed them and still had a little left over! Not to mention they were gone so fast! Will def double the recipe next time!

A friend made these for a luncheon and even though mushrooms are not a huge favorite of mine, these were delicious! My friend added bacon bits to hers and cut down on the cayenne so they weren't too spicy. She also used the same filling for jalepeno peppers which were super yummy! She made the mushrooms and peppers for at least 3 events in a row and they were devoured every time. :-)

These were very delicious.  I prepared all the ingredients a few hours ahead for a party.  Then I just threw them in the oven to bake 30 minutes before the guests arrive.  They were easy and turned out perfect.

I didn't think this was very good at all.  The cream cheese was overpowering.  The cream cheese to mushroom ratio is also way off.  With lots of tweaking you could probably make it ok.  Try a different recipe.

Delish.  Made these for my sons' birthday party and they were a hit!.  I tripled the recipe and was able to make almost 60 mushrooms.  I used a disposable pastry bag to fill the mushrooms which made it easier than a spoon..and definitely made the mushrooms prettier.

I'm afraid this is the lowest I have ever rated but these were not liked at all. The texture of the mushrooms sitting in the little pools of moisture they made in the oven was very odd and unappetizing. My son and his girlfriend actually laughed. I did remove them from the table and had to throw them away.

These mushrooms are a crowd pleaser. I've never had any left overs and people always ask me for the recipe. I found the original recipe a little bit too cheesy for my liking. I've adjusted the recipe by adding four rashers of finely diced bacon and half-a-cup of finely diced spring onions(use both the white and green parts of the spring onion) into the mixture. Then, I garnish the top of the mushrooms with a sprinkling of finely diced bacon. The bacon becomes golden and crispy in the oven and improves the overall presentation of the mushrooms. Also, I prefer to use small white mushrooms and I find that the mixture is enough to fill 30 to 40 small mushroom caps.

We absolutly loved this recipe. We did make a few changes to the original.  We do not use the mushroom stems and we use olive oil instead of Veg oil.  We also use Crab meat in the mix to add a bit extra.  It is great for those who like crab meat.    It is also a fabulous cracker/cheese dip for veggies also.  Kudos on this recipe.

A cinch to make. Several people have asked for the recipe and made them themselves.  I prefer cremini mushrooms to the standard white and goat cheese works well as a substitute for the cream cheese if you'd like to offer variety.

These were amazing!  I made them for "fight-night" last week and everyone loved them.  I was only able to eat one because by the time I got to them, they were all gone :(  I made some minor additions:  I used a food processor to grind the mushroom stems, that way they were really fine.  Sauteed them in butter and added onion powder while sauteing them.  Also used the minced garlic from the jar.  I used a little more cayenne pepper and onion powder than the recipe calls for because, otherwise it was a bit bland for my taste. I used freshly grated parmesano-regiano cheese and added some on top of the mushrooms which gave it a crunchy topping and made it look prettier.  I also added Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Next time I might try adding bacon.  This is definitely a keeper at my house.

Made this for an office potluck today - and got lots of compliments! Per other people's comments, I decided to cut down a tad on the cayenne, add some breadcrumbs on top, and planned ahead and got plenty of mushrooms (filled about 2 dozen- but to keep the filling recipe constant, used just 12 stems).  Also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (healthier) and would be interested to try next time with reduced/low fat cream cheese to see if it comes out as well.

This was not a good recipe--unless you enjoy the rather'greasy'taste of cream cheese.My family and I prefer the cheesey and bread crumb based recipes.Perhaps it would be better with a protein like chicken or crab, I'm not willing to give it a try, I say try the recipe for Happy Hour Mushrooms instead!

Great recipe!  I have also been using this recipe for over a year.  Definitely can cut back on the cream cheese, or make the full amount and keep for a future stuffing batch. I also add breadcrumbs every time, and fresh herbs when I remember to!

I regularly make this recipe for guests and it is always a hit.  I usually prepare everything the day before and stick them in the fridge so that the kitchen is clean when guests come over - that works well.  Sometimes I coat the finished product with breadcrumbs to give a nice golden color to them.  I use pepper jack cheese instead of the parma. and it always turns out well.

I was really impressed with this recipe!  This was my first time ever making stuffed mushrooms and they were a big hit with my family!  I did take others advice and used only half the cream cheese and added crabmeat and seasoned breadcrumbs.  I will definately be making this again!

I read a lot of the reviews and made this recipe.  These stuffed mushrooms were absolutely delicious.   It was time consuming but worth it.  I added crab meat and used fresh diced onion instead of powdered.  Green onion (scallions) would be delicious too.  I am going to make them again with 2 more additions, spinach and some bread crumbs or Panko.  The filling was runny when the mushrooms came out of the oven, and sort of oozed out of the mushrooms onto our plates. Make no mistake, it was yummy enough hat we were scraping it up off the plate and eating it, but I'd like to firm it up a bit with the bread crumbs so it isn't so messy.

Like other reviewers I agree that there is plenty enough filling for 1lb of mushrooms.  I also think it is best with added bacon, crab meat or something similar, and topped with breadcrumbs or Panko to add additional texture and flavor.

Turned Out Perfect! This was the first time making stuffed mushrooms and a easy recipe to follow. After reading the reviews I choose to add sausage and top the mushrooms with melted butter and bread crumbs, I only had the classic flavor bread crumbs and they tasted very good. I did not use a full package of cream cheese and still had plenty of filling. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I used olive oil and added a little green onion to the mushroom mixture. I also cut back considerably on the cream cheese, using the spreadable kind from a tub,  probably less than 4 oz. It worked out well, and I don't think I'd want more of it. I used 12 large mushrooms and had no problem using one of those long, skinny teaspoons to fill the mushrooms. I dipped the mushrooms in melted butter with a bit of lemon juice, then sprinkled some lightly with Panko crumbs, some with regular bread crumbs before filling. Drizzled with a tiny bit more of melted butter and topped with more parmesan cheese. Baked 25 min, and they were perfect. The cayenne gave it a nice kick. I can see adding crabmeat or sausage to change it up a bit. Thanks for the excellent recipe, Angie! UPDATE 11/30/14: This time added cooked, crumbled sundried tomato chicken sausage (any type would work) and cutting back even further on the cream cheese. Really like this version even better! The cream cheese acts as a binder, but too much is not appealing to me. GO PATS!!!

My friends absolutely loved this recipe. I made it for thanksgiving and I've made them three times since then in just a span of two months. They are definitely a crowd-pleaser. the cayenne pepper gives a nice after-taste and a little kick to the dish. Love!

I made these as the recipe states, except that I dipped the stuffed mushrooms in breadcrumbs and spritzed with butter before cooking. No one was really crazy about the cream cheese stuffing, wondering if maybe this isn't a standard in MA as I've never seen a restaurant style with a cream cheese filling. I will certainly try them again, but possibly add spinach and either bacon or sausage to give it a bit more substance and flavor.

These turned out well for an Alice in Wonderland themed party, although just a little too cheesy for my tastes. I think some crab might be a nice addition the mix. But all in all,  thanks for a great recipe!

These are so delicious!  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I chose this one because it has no meat.   Made my toes curl!
I cut the cayenne by half.  The heat was perfect.  I topped with Italian bread crumbs.

I always get compliments with this recipe. But I think the mixture becomes a little chunky because of the cream cheese. I prefer a smooth texture to the filling so I'll try it with half cream cheese and half sour cream next time.

My family devoured these mushrooms!  They were delicious but I thought a bit too rich and one went a long way for me, tho I loved them and will make them again for sure, especially for my book clubs spring potluck ... I think they are as good cold as hot or warm (I saved one for my lunch the day after easter to test it chilled and it was soooo good.)

I loved these! I did cut down the cream cheese to about 3/4ths of a package, as I only had 10 mushrooms. Also, I cut back on the cayenne pepper, as I can't stand things with too much kick. I did as others suggested and added some Italian breadcrumbs and melted butter to the top and it was wonderful as it gave it a bit more texture. Just wished I had more!

These mushrooms freeze nicely, with the help of a Foodsaver Machine.  Freeze them before baking.  When ready to use, I thaw them completely on paper towels and pop into the oven.  They are nice to have on hand.

My family and I liked this recipe very much! I used about 2/3 of the cream cheese that the recipe calls for and 1/3 of a cup seasoned bread crumbs. I think next time I will add more bread crumbs and less cheese. Very good otherwise. The initial recipe would be a little too much cheese for us. Will definitely make again!

These were really great!!! To cut down on calories I used fat free cream cheese instead of regular. An 8-oz package of fat free is only 240 calories while regular is 800 calories, and you'd never be able to tell the difference in this recipe! Other than that I made it exactly as stated and sprinkled some seasoned bread crumbs on top right before baking. A few commenters suggested making these in a cupcake/muffin pan which is what I did, and it made baking/handling them much easier. I've already recommended this to friends and can't wait to make it again!

Delicious! I used mushrooms that were not "fresh" and you couldn't tell a difference--I wouldn't put the mushrooms on a salad but cooked/baked would be okay. I couldn't find the onion powder in the cupboard so I used roasted garlic powder. I also baked the mushrooms in a sprayed mini tin (recommended by another member) and it worked really well. I added the spices to the sauted mushroom stems/garlic and it was very tasty. Don't use a cheap ziploc bag if you are piping the cheese into the mushrooms otherwise it will break--I found out the hard way. Also, push the ziploc bag deep into the mushroom; it will expand and you will be surprised at the amount of cheese it can hold. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was just okay. I think it used too much cayenne pepper. My husband would rather me try another recipe that is more traditional.

I made these exactly as the recipe instructed, and after tasting the stuffing decided to alter it. There was just way too much cream cheese, even after adding double the mushrooms, garlic and Parmesan. Next time I'll use only 2 oz. of cream cheese. Good recipe otherwise.

I made this recipe for 50 seniors and it came out wonderful. I tripled the filling and it filled 54 mushroom caps. I did top with italian bread crumbs, perfect.  They all want 2 caps the next time, they are on the menu. Thanks for sharing.

My family and coworkers loved them.  I didn't use the cayenne, and also added 1/4 cup crabmeat and 1/4 cup shredded charp cheddar cheese to the recipe.  and made a second batch and added spinach and chicken.  So many variations and everyone looks forward to what I'm going to try next

Delicious!!!  These stuffed mushrooms are so yummy.  They were a big hit at a dinner party I recently hosted.  I followed the recipe and they turned out great.  My only comment is that this makes a lot of filling...this made 30 mushrooms for me and I still had a little bit of filling left...but they were eaten in a snap...so I would recommend at least doubling the mushrooms and following the rest of the recipe as is.  I dipped them in melted butter before baking (so they wouldn't shrivel up) and sprinkled bread crumbs on top...yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.  :)

Delicious!  Actually I used 15 mushrooms and 1/2  the cream cheese. I did not want it too cheesy.  I have a small toothbrush that I use only for the mushrooms and that's how I clean them. I did add pepper flakes my family likes it a little more spicy and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and topped it with Panko bread crumbs and a little butter on top. It came out a little crunchy really yummy.

Oh my gosh, these are amazing!  I could not get enough of them!  I will use a little less cayenne pepper next time, because they were a little too spicy for me, but that still didn't stop me from eating them all!

I make some similar to this recipe, but these sound very good. However, I would broil the mushrooms before stuffing. This gets all the water out of them & they are not so slimy! Dry with a paper towel before stuffing.

I'll make this again, given that everyone really liked them. Nice and flavorful!  I used a 16-oz package of mushrooms that has mainly smaller mushrooms, instead of the really big mushrooms that we can buy loose at the grocery store and it turns out that was a good thing. This stuffing is much better with the smaller mushrooms than it was with the two larger mushrooms that came in the pack. The extra stuffing was a bit overwhelming in the larger mushrooms. I also split out the base recipe into two batches and added 1/2 lb of crumbly fried and drained Jimmy Dean Sausage (regular) to one of the batches. The version with sausage was the bigger hit. Good stuff!

The idea of these is better than the real thing. I found the filling to be 'stick to the roof of your mouth' pasty. The taste and texture of the cream cheese was much too dominant. Also, it's very difficult to keep the garlic from burning as you sautee the mushroom stems. It would be better to add the garlic in right near the end of that stage of the recipe.

Takes quite a bit of time to prepare but they are well worth it. Little spicy, modify the amount of pepper if you don't like spice. Great app.

Really good! I brushed melted butter on the mushrooms before I stuffed them. Used a mini-muffin pan to bake them in and it worked perfect. Also, put stuffing mix in ziplock bag and cut corner and piped into mushrooms. Easy! Next time I'm adding sausage with the stems and garlic.

My only problem with these were that they were a bit hot for me. Otherwise, simply delicious! I brushed with butter, sprinkled parmesan cheese and bread crumbs on top like others suggested. I also used asiago cheese on top. Definitely a keeper, just going to cut down on the cayenne to 1/8 tsp.

These were soo good! I am not an experienced cook, but these were pretty easy and my whole family loved them. I made them for a Thanksgiving appetizer, and I got asked for the recipe! I did make a couple of changes from other reviews I had seen. I doubled the amount of mushrooms from 12 to 24, and it was the perfect amount, it used all of the stuffing and each mushroom was filled perfectly. I still only used 12 stems in the mixture. I also added about 1/8 cup of bread crumbs to the mixture. I dipped the mushroom caps into melted butter before I cooked them to keep them from drying out. I sauteed them in a skillet for about 10 minutes before filling and baking them to let some of the moisture cook out. I baked them for 15 minutes, then took them out and sprinked bread crumbs and parmesan cheese on top and them broiled them for 5 more minutes. They were soo yummy! The only thing I might change next time is to use a little less cayenne pepper than the recipe calls for, the spiciness took away from the rest of the flavors I thought.

ABSOLUTELY mouth-watering!! I made these for today for Thanksgiving and they were demolished! Everyone kept telling me how awesome the filling tasted! I read several suggestions on here and these are the changes I made (which worked out extremely well!) I cut the cayenne in half to 1/8tsp. and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. If you follow the exact amount of ingredients, it makes more than enough filling for 24 mushrooms! I bought the little mushrooms so that each bite of the filling wouldn't be too overwhelmingly creamy. The little ones worked out and I ended up with extra filling which tastes amazing even cold. We put the remaining filling out like dip with some crackers after dinner and it was amazing :) I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a great response from your guests!

These turned out very well!  I made one slight change.  I cooked the mushroom caps by themselves on a tray upside down until most of the water came out.  I also put a little olive oil and salt+cracked pepper on the caps.  Once the water came out I put the filling in and cooked them until the cream cheese mixture was golden brown.  I made them for a dinner party and they were devoured.  

PS - Any leftover filling tastes great on a cracker!

These were ok, but the stuffing part needed something else. Not sure if it would an herb or maybe crabmeat as others have suggested.  Or maybe smaller mushrooms work best - I used larger ones.

These were a big hit at my wine party this weekend and I highly recommend them because they are tasty, not that difficult, and they are even at room temperature. We made a few modifications: instead of sauteeing the garlic with the diced stems - because garlic will burn way too easily and get bitter - we threw the garlic in for the last 30 seconds.  I didn't have onion powder on hand, so I used minced onions. Also, I know the tag line to this recipe says "no breadcrumbs in this recipe" but we rolled the tops, once stuffed, in panko (japanese style) bread crumbs so that they stuck to the cream cheese and man were they good. Yum!

"Mouth-watering" is an overstatement.  Ok, but will not make these again.  Way too cream cheesy.  I added green onion and bacon.  Knowing now how cream cheesy they turned out, I would have added more green onion and bacon.  Or I think sausage would be a good alternative also.

I had made these a few years ago for a New Years party and got rave reviews so I made them again for a SuperBowl gathering.  These were great and so easy to make.    I did have to warm them back up for about 35-40 seconds via the microwave at one point and that worked out fine.   Depending on your mushroom cap size - these fill a lot more then 15 (which was FINE with my guests).  I had a full 9x13 baking dish.  I added garlic along with the chopped up mushroom stems as well as additional cayanne b/c I like the extra heat.  I took another reviewers advise and dipped the caps in butter prior to filling and also used a ziplock bag to pipe the filling in.  It went so quickly and they were fabulous!

These were the BEST!  My husband is not a mushroom fan and ate 5 of them, then said Id have to make them again!  I mad a couple of changes to the recipe.
I crisped and crumbled  a few slices of bacon and used the bacon grease instead of the oil that the recipe called for to  saute my stems and garlic in.  I also used a food processor to chop the garlic and mushrooms.  I added some minced clams as well and also used a dash of worchestershire sauce as well.  I thought that the cream cheese took a while to mix with the stuffing mixture at first, seeing that its supposed to cool, but after a while it all came together.  I put it in a ziplock baggie and piped it into the caps.  I dipped the caps in butter and sprinkled the stuffing with bread crumbs at the end. they came out fantastic!!!

Overall pretty good stuffed mushrooms -- my family enjoyed them, I personally would stick with my adjustments suggested by other viewers.  I added green onions, worcestershire sauce and more garlic when sauteeing the chopped mushrooms stems. I might try adding a bit of fresh parsley next time as well.  I brushed a little olive oil on the mushrooms before baking.  Since I used really large mushrooms, I needed to bake a little longer than 20 minutes. Thank you for the recipe!

WOW! I've been making the same mushroom recipe for years and I think this one will replace mine. I've made this 3 times in the past week and there's a request for this to made on Thanksgiving. The filling can definetly fill at least 24 shrooms(if you're not not using large ones). These have been the first to disappear off the table every time and it just doesn't seem that I've made enough. I would say this is one of the best recipes(at least from the appetizer section) I've made from all recipes. Thanks Angie!

I made these for a bridal shower. I think the recipe is great just as it is. The pepper is a perfect touch. I was able to use a cake decorating tip and pipe the mixture into the mushroom caps.Everyone really enjoyed them and they looked nice. I would definitely make them again. For the mushrooms that wanted to roll, I just sliced a small piece off of the bottom.

These are sooo good that I just had to add my comments/modifications (my first review, though I've tried many successes from this sight).  Due to diet restrictions, I did make a couple of substitutions:  olive oil instead of vegestable oil, finely minced onion (1/4 cup or so) instead of onion powder which I did not have, and fat-free cream cheese.  Due to the slightly different consistency, you have to let the cream cheese soften quite a bit (I used my microwave for this).  It takes a bit more work to get it mixed in well with the other ingredients, but the lower calories are worth it.  Also, be sure to bake only until the mushroom caps are wet on the bottom.  Any longer than this and they will shrink, causing the stuffing to coming out the top (and not look as good).  Also, I love the "bite" of the red pepper, but would put in just a bit less for others who don't like as much spice.

I think I prefer other things in my stuffed mushrooms, other than mushrooms.  The filling was a lot of work, and the texture too mushy for us.

These were very good.  I decided to add green onions instead of onion powder for color and flavor. I really like how they turned out.  Nice enough to serve company.  Thanks for the post.

I made these last night to go with dinner and I was sadly disapointed I thought they would be great from all of the good reviews but my husband & I did not like them at all, they need alot of help. I will not make again sorry, but that is how it goes you have to try recipes some are great and some are not oh well.

Made these for a dinner party and they FLEW off the table. DELISH!  Have extra mushrooms on hand because you will  have lots of filling.  I put filing into a pastry bag and 50 mushrooms were filled in a snap.  So pretty too!  I took other posters advise and did slightly saute mushrooms in a bit of butter in a pan prior to baking.  I finely chopped the stems in the food processer and then sauted in skillet with butter not oil.  Once it cooled,added the other ingredients and the filing was perfect for piping.  These were a bit time consuming to prepare but well worth the extra effort. A++  Allrecipes does it again!

I am always looking for shortcuts and on this one, I used my beloved Alouette and merely sprinkled a little cayenne on top. Loved the color this adds. I like to serve these with grilled ribeyes. Simple to prepare.

Excellent.  I dipped the mushrooms in breadcrumbs.  I took them to a party, and they were gone after I made it only once around everyone!  I had to sneak a few for my best friend, he's a cooking snob who really loved them too!

One suggestion to everyone---> A lot of extra filling for the amount of mushrooms!  I would say almost double!

I have made this several times due to all the requests from my friends and family from the first batch.  I do sprinkle bread crumbs on top before baking. 

I just tried my latest with frozen stuffing from previous batches.  It was so easy to just pull from the freezer, thaw, stuff and bake!

I was planning a party and wanted to test several stuffed mushrooms before hand. This was my absolute favorite! Although they are very rich, I cannot think of one thing that I would do differently or adjust the recipe. I might add that the filling is much more than enough to fill 12 large button mushrooms. I ended up using almost 30 mushrooms. Fantastic! I will definitely be making these for my party.

Awesome and unique!  The filling actually will stuff about 20 good size mushrooms so buy more then stated.  The parmesan cheese in this recipe seems to "puff" up the filling and the end result is very delicous and quite unique.  I've made this recipe several times now and it is the only one I use.  Last time I did fry up a bit of bacon and mixed that into the cheese mixture, but to be honest - they are just as good without it!

I made these mushrooms the first time exactly as the recipe stated and loved them. I now add a little more garlic and use fresh parsley. My family loves them. They are a great update on the traditional stuffed mushroom ( breadcrumbs and ?).
Try them and you will be hooked.

Excellent appetizer although I altered this recipe somewhat!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added a little less cream cheese which may not be necessary if you are going to add additional items such as bread crumbs (don't use too much though b/c this will make the mixture very dry) definitely use less than 1/4 cup.  I also used more mushrooms than called for b/c this recipe makes more filling than the amount of mushrooms it calls for. In addition, I added a few spices such as parsley, oregano, and basil.  I then added a little piece of shrimp to each mushroom which really made it that much better! This appetizer is perfect for any party whether casual or elegant!

This recipe, as written, is okay.  It came out much too stiff and it was difficult to fill the caps because it was so stiff.  I made some changes to the recipe and then it was fantastic!  I used the tub cream cheese, not brick.  This made it creamier.  I added chopped fresh basil (4 large leaves).  Instead of baking the mushrooms at 350 degrees, I set the oven on 'Custom broil' at 420 degrees and broiled them for approximately 20 minutes, until all of the water had evaporated.  Then, to lightly brown the tops, I increased the broil temperature to 500 degrees and watched the browing carefully.  Also, to reduce the amount of water that comes out of the mushrooms, before making the recipe, I peeled the outer skin off of the mushroom caps and let them dry overnight.  This really helped make them less soggy.  Overall, with all of these changes, this was a very delicious recipe and I served it at my Girls Night.  It was devoured by all.

These mushrooms were great! I followed the receipe exactly but added more garlic and only 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. I made the mixture the day prior and then filled the mushrooms prior to my guests arriving. I followed another reviewer's awesome idea of putting the filling in a plastic baggie and then cutting off the tip and it made the filling process so much easier! Thanks!

These mushrooms are just amazing...absolutely wonderful.  I love them and want to eat the whole batch myself but with all that cream cheese, I try to control myself!!  I've made this recipe for YEARS and just discovered you can use the extra filling for a yummy spread on crackers/bread.

Five Stars. I read the reviews and also decided not to use the stems. I did saute a quarter cup of finely chopped onion with the garlic. Used a 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan which I suggest. Cored out the mushrooms a bit better than just popping out the stem with a strawberry corer, huller tool. I didn't have any leftover filling. Used 15 white button shrooms. 20 minutes was spot on

I've made these quite a few times and they are absolutely delicious- one of my favorite recipes and I almost always have these ingredients on deck. I also like to make this recipe into a sauce by heating the mixture in a pan with some heavy cream or milk. Great over chicken. I'll usually make about half of the stuffed mushrooms and then use the other half of the mix for sauce. This was my solution to making this appetizer into an everyday meal for my small family of three.

It would be nice if the recipe specified what type of mushrooms to use. I got a package of baby bellas and I'm pretty sure they were too small for the recipe because even after stuffing them completely full, I only used up half the filling. On the plus side, they only cooked for half the time, and the leftover filling wound up being really good on crackers, so I might just make them that way on purpose next time! Delicious recipe as-is, and I also think it could be a good base for experimenting with additional flavors (I for one would like to play with adding seafood to try to mimic my fiance's favorite restaurant appetizer).

Delicious recipe! I had to make a couple substitutions based on what was available in my kitchen- I sprinkled the stems with garlic powder instead of minced, and I had crushed red pepper instead of cayenne. I also added crab like others suggested. Everyone loved them! I will say it makes a ton of filling, I don't know what size mushrooms would use up all the filling on just 12. I bought three small packages of white mushrooms and still had leftover filling. The next day I picked up a larger package of mushrooms to finish it off- this time I tossed the mushrooms in butter before adding the filling. The butter was quite the improvement, I would definitely recommend it. Still a very good recipe, as written.

I love these!  When making 12 mushrooms, I only needed half of the sour cream.  I also didnt use all of the stems.  If I had used all of the sour cream, it would have been too much filling.  I am adding to my review because I made them with Greek cream cheese which is cream cheese and Greek yogurt so it has half the fat and 4x the protein.  I liked them better.  They were a little lighter.

Made these for a couple who came over for snacks after we went to a movie theatre.  I added some panko bread crumbs seasoned with oregano and basil as other reviewers suggested...I knew they would need some crunch.  They were ok, but I like mushrooms with a bit more substance in the middle.  Maybe with some stuffing and the cream cheese mixture?  We ate them, but I will look for a different recipe the next time I make these.  UPDATE: made these for a Christmas brunch today (12/15/15) and everyone liked them.  I actually combined this recipe with another I have.  They were good, but they shrink so much after baking?!

Super with bread crumbs!
I made this receipt with half ricotta cheese and half cream cheese. I also pushed each filled mushroom cap into bread crumbs before baking. They turned out great! Because I'm on a low carb diet, these really fit the bill (I used low carb bread for crumbs--also, cheese is low carb, too). I was so impressed that I'm making these to bring to my friend's Christmas party tomorrow night. I'm excited!

Delish!! I gave it a few special touches. I sautéed the fine chopped stems and inside of the mushroom with 1 chopped onion and 4 cloves of garlic in evoo and also some white wine until most of the liquid was absorbed, u do want to leave it somewhat moist. I also baked some super thick cut bacon at 425 until mostly cooked and then chopped it up and added that to the mixture at the end as well. Soooooooo good!!

I'm used to making stuffed mushrooms the way my mother did. Take the stems, chop them finely and sauté them in olive oil and butter and then add Italian breadcrumbs, then stuff the caps. I wanted to try something different and possibly better. I came across this recipe and Crystal's suggestion and a few of my own and they were a huge hit!! 

I made these for an app for Easter and everyone loved them. I took Crystal S's suggestion and used Italian sausage meat, fresh garlic and then added some ingredients of my own such as more garlic, sweet onions, baby belle mushrooms chopped up finely into the sautéed ingredients and then added Italian breadcrumbs and one 8oz package of cream cheese. I melted some butter and brushed each mushroom before I filled them and then dipped them into the seasoned panko bread crumbs. 

I can't wait to make them again!!

I found this able to stuff double the mushrooms written (still only using 12 of the stems), which was not a problem as far as I'm concerned because everyone LOVES these mushrooms!

I hate mushrooms. But my family loves mushrooms. I made this for them and listened to other reviews by buttering the mushroom and adding crab meat and Italian bread crumbs. They loved it!

I made these for NYE, and everyone loved them. I added a can of crabmeat as others suggested.  I also doubled the recipe and baked them in a buttered mini muffin pan as other reviewers did, and that worked really well.  They were tasty; I liked the addition of cayenne.  I had leftover filling because of the added crab and some extra mushrooms I had, so I ate that with tortilla chips.

I cannot give this a 5 stars because I didn't follow the exact recipe. Here is what I did:
 -Used 12 large stuffing gourmet white mushrooms. $2.78
- followed everything. 
- BUT minced 2 tablespoon of onion and sauteed it with mushroom and garlic in a jar with veg oil. AND used double Ceyanne pepper in the cream cheese. 

I had a little bit of cream after stuffing. But I stuffed generously and they didn't fall over. 

My man loved them. Next time I'll use smaller mushrooms and add mozzarella the last few minutes of baking. BUT YUMMY.

I entered this in a cooking contest at the Annual VFW Brisket-Sides and desserts. I won 1st place. I did add Italian bread crumbs on top and brushed butter on first then added Parmesan on top. They are so good and I won so it's not just me that thought so. Tks you so much

My 4 year old great granddaughter loves these and I've made them countless times. If there is any stuffing left she will eat it with a spoon! I bet it would be wonderful to just chop the mushrooms and stir it all together and bake to use as a dip. I sometimes add panko bread crumbs to the filling and on top with a little melted butter.

I made this as a side for dinner tonight. I didn't have cream cheeses so i used ricotta and this is unbelievable.  It is so good. Its much better than the one they serve at red lobster.  I wish I had made more.

These were SO delicious and SO easy to make. I didn't use as much cream cheese in order to cut back on some calories. Instead, for the cheese, I used 1/4 cup cream cheese, 1/8 cup Parmesan, 1/8 cup mozzarella, and 2 Laughing Cow garlic and herb wedges. I also mixed 1/4 cup of spinach in. YUM!!!

These were absolutely delicious, but I had used 6 giant mushrooms so I cut the recipe in half. I didn't feel there was enough 'stuffing' although it tasted great. Tonight I am making them again, this time with smaller mushrooms and I got extra mushrooms so I will have more "mushroom pieces" to stuff with.  All my guests LOVED these.

Never judge a book by its cover.  I first made this recipe on Christmas Eve 2011.  I must admit, when I first saw the recipe I thought the ingredients were weird. Cream cheese, cayenne pepper?  Nevertheless, I saw the overwhelming good reviews so followed the recipe exactly (well, almost – I swapped hot Hungarian paprika for cayenne).  This mushroom recipe is excellent!  I will make it traditionally every Christmas Eve. Thank you Angie!

I just made these for Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit! I doubled the filling and used 24 mushrooms and even had filling left over to make more mushrooms the next day for my own pleasure. I did make a few changes as well, added the green onions to the sauteed stem pieces and garlic so I left out the onion powder. Used the Kraft Three Cheese Blend (parmesan, romano, asiago) and sunflower oil. Helpful hint, use the whipped cream cheese that comes in the tub to cut on prep time and elbow grease.

I have made these a few times and they were a big hit! These mushrooms are full of flavor and you can customize them by adding a little more cayenne pepper for more of a kick. A great starter to any meal. I shall me making them again as my starter for my next cook out :)

These are easy and delicious! The best kind of recipe! I added the cream cheese while the onions were still warm to help it mix better. I made on Friday and kept in the fridge until Sunday, when I needed them. Topped with breadcrumbs.

So incredibly delicious!  I have made this at least five times now for various gatherings and everyone wants the recipe!  I put Italian bread crumbs on a plate and dip the mushrooms in the crumbs and drizzle with butter.  Extra calories but so delicious.  This recipe is a must try!

I find the cayenne to be really unsettling in this recipe, Im not against spice, even in this dish, but it would be best from some fresh peppers. What I did was replaced the cayenne with a talespoon of chopped sun dried tomatoes and a tablespoon of crushed tollhouse crackers...mmmmmm...its all I can say...

These are awesome! Added a little more cayenne pepper for an extra kick. The only problem I have with them is that after cooking the mushrooms they release a lot of water and make the mushrooms a little soggy. Does anyone know how to fix this problem? Thanks.

I made these just for a "something different" with dinner idea and they were a HIT! Will definitely make these again! I did add a lil green onion and used baby bellas and they were awesome!

These were very good & fairly easy just a little time consuming. I made 60 mushrooms for a family christmas party & they were a hit, didn't last long at all! I cut back on cream cheese & added some bread crumbs & crab meat to the "stuffing" I baked them for 15 minutes took them out & sprinkled shredded mozzarella on them & popped them back in for 5 more minutes to melt the cheese. Next time I will cut back on the cayenne pepper it was a little spicy but still good. Although they were gone very quick & we enjoyed them I still prefer a little more stuffing to cheese ratio. But no complaints they were a hit!

This was delicious! The only change I made was adding a little bit of onion to the stage w/ frying the garlic and mushrooms, and I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. Next time I would cut down on the cream cheese and maybe add a little bit of bread crumb. But no one complained; everyone thought they were delicious. Cayenne pepper gave a perfect slight kick, too!

I plan on making these again this year for our holiday party. I don't even like mushrooms so I relied on the guest to tell me how good they were. They vanished off the tray. I used the mini muffin tins and yes, they kept them from tipping over, but I found it made it hard to get out without digging into the mushroom. If I use this technique again I may use the standard tin size.

Amazing recipe! Few tips for first timers:   1.) It's way better if you can get your hands on the 1oz. individual servings of cream cheese. It's already soft and will save your hand muscles for eating!    2.) Add 1/2 Lb ground turkey, 2 Tbsp bacon pieces, 1 Tsp Italian seasoning, and 1 Tsp garlic salt when cooking mushrooms and garlic for sausage & cream cheese stuffed mushrooms.  3.) If you follow step 2, add 2-3 extra ounces of cream cheese. 
Note: The cayenne pepper is amazing and perfect. Just spicy enough for someone who likes spicy, and not too spicy for someone who just wants a little kick.
Thank you so much for the chance to please my family with this wonderful creation. God bless you!

These were pretty good.  I would say that the addition of breadcrumbs was good.  I think I had too few mushroom stems to work with the cream cheese mixture...I will try it again next time with larger mushrooms...

These are so delicious. I used 6 large portabello mushrooms as there is only 2 of us. I used 4 oz of cream cream, olive oil instead of vegetable oil, added chopped green onions, and some italian bread crumbs  to the stems and garlic. There wasn't really stems on these so i scooped out the insides of the mushrooms. Worked great. Next time I will have a couple extra mushrooms just for chopping. I brushed the outside and inside with melted butter and breadcrumbs. Sprinkled breadcrumbs on top. So good. Will make these for company and parties. Thank you for this recipe.

WOW these are fabulous. Per another's suggestion, I added crumbled turkey bacon and chives to the cream cheese mixture then sprinkled italian breadcrumbs and then drizzled with butter before popping into the oven. EVERYONE at my dinner party raved at how delicious, rich and creamy they were. 

Thanks for the recipe!

Sooooo good.  I love the kick of warmth to them.  Mushroom caps are a fave for me, and these ones are by far the best ones I have ever made.  Everyone asks for the recipe.  Don't change the recipe and mess with perfection!

You can make these and send them home with friends to bake! Sometimes I use butter or olive oil.  My favorite thing is putting crushed flavored croutons on top just before baking.  Easy and flexible recipe!

A delicious recipe! I switched mine up though. I used a container of Feta cheese instead of Parmesan. Also, I added chopped onion and spinach to my mix. Also, I added different herbs such as basil, rosemary, oregano and a hint of onion powder. Mixed it all together, stuffed it in my little caps and baked for the 20 minutes. They were delicious. Unfortunately, I actually have to share them with my friends!

The filling would be good as a chip dip as well with pita chips or bread.

I was looking for a great stuffed mushroom recipe but this wasn't it. The filling lacked substance and oozed out. Neither my husband or I enjoyed the taste of these.

These were pretty good. Really really rich though, I prefer savory. I do like that these are low carb, which is why I chose these to make. Lot's of other recipes want you to use bread crumbs. Thanks for the recipe, I'll probably make again.

Darn fine.  1 recipe for the stuffing is enough for 24 mushrooms though.  And definitely add the bread crumbs and/or lump crab meat.  Dipping each mushroom in melted butter is also a great idea.

Made these as appetizers.  Fairly easy to make.  I made no alterations to the recipe.  Next time, I will add more cayenne pepper, for more kick.  The cream cheese mixture was too much or just twelve mushrooms.  They tasted great though!!!  Will definitely make these again.

This was awesome, and so easy to do. As others suggested, I increased the mushrooms to 20 and used only 18 of the steam. I also used only 2/3 of cream cheese. Additions to the recipe were 2 slices cooked bacon, minced, and 2 green onions, also minced but only used lower half. Rolled the tops in panko and dipped in butter like other wrote. MMMM MMMMM MMMM is the best way to describe it. When I cooked it I only did it 10 minutes, go a bit longer if you like, and then broiled for 5. If you are doing this recipe ahead of time I'd prepare the mix and store in a baggie while putting the mushrooms in a container; put in fridge for no more then 2 days. Then when ready bring the mushrooms and mix to room temp. Fill the mushrooms, panko the tops, then dip in butter and cook.

These were DELICIOUS.  I made them for a NYE party and they were gone within minutes.  I followed the recipe and I had a little bit of the filling left over because some of the mushroom caps were small.  I did like some of the others and put a little butter on the tops of the mushroom caps before baking and I also put them in a mini muffin pan after I filled each one.  They turned out really great.  I will definitely be making these again!!!!

This is an excellent version just as it is, but for a change sometimes I saute a couple of tablespoons of chopped pancetta, when it's crisp I add it to the foodprocesser to finely mince it, when it's cool I add it to the other ingredients. I use the large mushrooms and serve them as a side dish with a roast or steaks.

I love mushrooms so last weekend when my sister in law made me stuffed mushrooms I wanted to try making my own. I made this tonight it was easy and well they went fast. I used small mushrooms. This was more spicy then I expected but my nonspicy food person couldn't keep her hands off then. I didn't have any onion powder but it was still delicous. Sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.  Next time make this I will add breadcrumbs in the filling too. gonna get the onion powder and cut down on cayenne powder a little.

So good, but takes way longer than 25 minutes of prep time.  More like 45.  Still, though, worth the work.  They will definitely be enjoyed wherever they are taken!

If I were to make these again, I would decrease the amount of cream cheese and add more chopped mushroom to the mix.  Perhaps even add some breadcrumbs into it as well.  It tasted too heavy for me as an appetizer.  My guests did not gobble all of them up as I had hoped.

This recipe really tastes like jhony carino's baked stuffed mushrooms. If you don't want the texture to be too much creamy you can substitute some of the cheese with breadcrumbs. I also prefere to use green onion instead of the powder. The green color in the mix makes it more attractive. I also like to add one tea spoon of worstershire sauce. After baking the mushrooms for 15 min I add half cup of cooking cream to the mushrooms and cut one tomato and sprincle it above the mushrooms with some persly. The cream addition makes this recipe a gourmet dish!

I LOVED these. The only thing differently that I did, was fried up some bacon and crumbled it and then added to the mix before stuffing them. I now bring these to every family potluck. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Fantastic!  Made as directed.  Side note:  Baked these, then froze on cookie sheet.  Microwaved them at a later date, broiling just a bit to brown the tops.  Try it!

A hit on Christmas eve...After reading reviews I used only half the amount of cream cheese while keeping the rest of the recipe the same. Added butter and breadcrumbs to the top before baking. We loved them and I planb to make them for New Year's!!!

Easy & Delicious!  This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms and the recipe was requested several times.  I used olive oil instead of veggie oil.  I did not have any cayenne pepper on hand, so I used cumin instead.  I put the stuffing mixture into a ziplock baggie, cut off one corner and filled them that way.  So easy!  I also baked them in a mini-muffin pan.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were delicious!  I used smaller mushrooms (about 20 total) and I still had leftover filling.  I did add some precooked bacon bits--yum!  And since I didn't have any onion powder, I minced up a couple of green onions and sauteed them with the filling.  So good!

I was not overly impressed.  They were not bad, but the stuffing was lacking flavor and tasted overwhelmingly like cream cheese.

These are so good! It's so easy to make, it's unbelievable! I used a whole package of mushrooms (roughly 28), and I still had some stuffing left over. I used the left over stuffing in a couple of bell peppers. I added canned crab to some of the mushrooms and peppers, and that was also fantastic!

These were very popular when I made them for a dinner party. They are like delicious little fat balls, definitely not figure friendly, however they are so rich...that one of two will suffice.  This recipe definitely makes enough for double the mushrooms.

Made these for the family Christmas gathering. My brother in-law tasted them as I was bringing them out of the oven. He suggested that I just put them in his car so that the rest of the family did not have to be "subject to the terrible tasting stuffed mushrooms"-yeah right! I too used 3x the amount of mushrooms and it came out perfect with the amount of filling. I did not think the cayeene pepper was to much, it gave them a nice "kick"! I did not measure the parm cheese. I used more than it called for (can never have too much cheese!) and added a can of drained crab meat. These were a big hit and ZERO left over. I made them up the day before and they kept overnight in the fridge just beautiful!I also set a cooling rack in the pan to bake them on as to not have the shrooms sit in the juice as they baked. This is one that will get made again and again for sure!

My son helped me make these on a trial run since we will be making them for Christmas Eve. We used both baby bella and regular mushrooms. One addition was some panko breadcrumbs to thicken up the filling. We also dipped the mushrooms in melted real butter before filling and baking which enhanced the flavor (we made some of each to test). They cooked for almost exactly 20 minutes and were perfect. Thanks!

This was delicious, but I changed it a fair amount using what I had on hand.  I substituted Laughing Cow lite cheese wedges for the cream cheese.  I would have added crabmeat if I'd had it, and I used a mixture of shredded parmesan & shredded colby jack (1/4 C ea) to 1/2 C breadcrumbs.  I also added 1 raw egg to the mixture for moisture & binding.  This mixture stuffed 20 large mushrooms and they were wonderful!

This I think was the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. I made them for my family and friends and they all went nuts over them.  My Mom hates mushrooms and just loved them.
I followed the recipe exactly maybe added a little more cheese. I put it on low when doing the garlic(so it would not burn) and chopped stems. The cayenne did give it a little kick which we all loved. I put the cheese mixture in a zip lock bag and cut the end of bag instead of trying to spoon the mix onto the mushrooms.
Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

These mushrooms slightly reminded me of the 'Shrooms that are on the menu at Houlihan's restaurant.  I followed the advice from others and added the mushroom pieces to the olive oil and minced garlic.  Added the dry spices and cooked until almost dry.  Added the cream cheese and grated cheese, mixed, cooled slightly and then piped  the filling into the mushrooms.  Topped with grated cheese and a few breadcrumbs.  I served with a mixture of horseradish and mayo.

I got a lot of compliments on these because they don't have bread crumbs in the middle - my guests liked that.  However, you don't need as much cream cheese that the recipe calls for if you use smaller mushrooms - I had way too much filling for the mushrooms left over.  I ended up throwing a lot of it away.  But the finished product tastes amazing!

I read over all of the most helpful reviews and decided that I would make this recipe just as it states for a football game. These are really wonderful, but the guys in my family thought they were outstanding!! I used regular sized mushrooms and found that I had more filling left over, but I guess that all depends on the size of your mushrooms and how full you fill them. Make sure you do have copies of the recipe because you will be asked for it. A real winner.

This recipe has been a hit with all holidays/get togethers.  EVERYONE LOVES THEM:-) I add ground hot italian sausage. Gives these mushrooms a perfect kick. Cook the sausage seperate, then add it to the last of the mixture.  I also put these mushrooms on the grill instead of the oven.  Everyone drools when they see the mushrooms come out to be     grilled:-) ANOTHER TIP: If by any chance there is any mix left use it for crackers as an delicious appetizer. Trust me you will want to make more mix just to some left! ENJOY these as much as we do:-)

MEGA 5 Stars!  I cooked 3 slices of bacon then took it out and chopped it up really fine- cooked a small chopped onion with some garlic in the bacon grease and proceeded from there with 1/2 a block of cream cheese, 1/2 cup chicken broth, and about 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs.  I also blanched the mushroom caps (I used baby portabellas) in about 1 cup of chicken broth for about 5 minutes and drained them on paper towels before stuffing them.  These were out of this world!!!!!!!  MEGA, MEGA 5 stars!!  Thanks for the starting off MY stuffed mushrooms!!!!!!!!

These were a huge hit, and quick and easy to make.  I used 16 mushrooms, each were big enough for two bites, and I still had filling left over.  Next time I will try using more mushrooms.  I also put them together early in the afternoon, and then refrigerated until I was ready to bake them.  Even coming from the fridge, they were ready in under 20 minutes.  Will definitely be making again.

i might consider making these again if using small mushrooms and only getting a small amount at a time, but there are so many better stuffed mushroom recipes out there, i doubt i ever will. this was just all cream cheese taste and not much else. followed to the t. i guess if i'd have read the other reviews and made the adjustments they'd have turned out better, but if you have to tweak, it isn't 5 star as is anyway. i'm going to keep looking for something much better.

Yumm, yumm, yumm!!!! I made these for my sister's bridal shower and they were a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly and they were soooo good. I tripled the amount of mushrooms, but only doubled the filling and it was still too much filling. We used the rest as a cheese spread on crackers. I will definately make them again!

Update: I have made these for several more get-togethers and now everyone at work says I HAVE to make these. They're a HUGE hit!

The name says it all - these are truly mouth-watering. Although they are a bit time-consuming, I don't mind with a delicious outcome like this. I made about 25 mushrooms last night; they tasted fantastic hot out of the oven. I followed some other reviewers' example and sprinkled the tops with Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs. Sprayed with butter-flavored cooking spray. I think they taste just as good as The Olive Garden's stuffed mushrooms (you can add clams to the stuffing to make it even more like theirs), only better because you know exactly what went into them, AND they're not swimming in a butter sauce. My family loved them. I'll definitely make these again and again. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Edit: I just made these again, with great results and great comments from the lucky eaters!

Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  I took some other reviewers advice and added the juice of half a lemon to the stuffing mixture and I used fat free cream cheese and no one could tell.  Also, there was not enough mushrooms for me with just the stems so I chopped & sauted some extra mushrooms (plus extra olive oil & minced garlic).  It is excellent!  Just the right amount of heat with the peppers.  Also, the stuffing is good as a dip without baking.  Which is handy for tailgating or other situations without an oven or warmer.  I had no leftovers and will definitely be making this again soon.

i thought this recipe was quite good - my stepfather LOVED it.  i added some bacon (since we were having a spinach salad as well) and minced onion (instead of powder).  i used more cayenne pepper then was called for (cuz we like spicy!).  i didnt find that i had too much creamcheese leftover - i think this was because i used large muchrooms.

These are wonderful great for any holiday party.  The cayenne pepper makes the whole recipe!  My changes: Tastes almost just as good with light or fat free cream cheese, I use chopped green onions instead of onion powder, and I add about a 1/3 cup of asiago cheese as well ( still use the parm. too).  Make sure to buy extra mushrooms because you will have extra filling... but that's good because 12 of these would never be enough.  Happy Holidays!

We thoroughly enjoy this recipe and often just make half for a quick addition to dinner. We do add bacon pieces in with the garlic and mushroom stems. And mix in 1/4 tsp of worchestershire sauce with the cream cheese for a little depth. Yum!

I made this last night. My husband was told to stop eating starches at dinner so I've been hunting for things to make as side dishes that aren't pasta or potatoes. I added about 1/4 cup of grated mozzarella and a tablespoon of fresh chopped chives to the filling and left out the onion powder. They were very well received.

Delicious!! I used 10 JUMBO mushrooms, and the filling was perfect. To top them off, I mixed together some extra Parm. cheese, dried breadcrumbs and dried Italian seasoning, and dipped the mushrooms in that. Baked as specified, but broiled for one minute to make the topping crunchy. They were great as a main dish, with a Caesar salad on the side. Will certainly make them again.

This was outstanding .. made it with 2.5 (42mushrooms) pounds of mushrooms and had 2 left.  Used breadcrumbs as a topping.  Also made it earlier in the day and kept in refrigerator till baking.  Tossed the mushrooms in little olive oil and lemon juice to keep color till baking.  Amazingingly easy appetiser and well appreciated.  My guest even took the recipe I had printed!!!

I did not change a thing, I loved these and my guests did too.  Yes, it does make more stuffing than needed, but after reading the other reviews I knew to buy more mushrooms.  I used a cookie scoop to put the filling into the mushroom caps.

The first time I made this, I had way too much of the stuffing so I only used half and froze the rest. Now I always have a batch of the stuffing in the freezer and when I buy the mushrooms to put it in I make a new batch for the freezer. I have made this several times and it's always a BIG hit. I use less cream cheese and cayenne and add seasoned bread crumbs to the mixture and also sprinkle on top before baking. Delicious!

We loved this, but we followed the advice of others by cutting the cream cheese in half.  We also added 1/2 cup of italian bread crumbs and a pint of backfin crab meat.  We also added a few herbs for flavor.  If you have children, cut the red pepper also.  I guess by the time we were finished, we had a new recipe!

Yum Yum YUMMMM!!  My boyfriend couldn't believe these were homemade.  Next time I will try to fill more mushrooms than I did this time, as there was a little too much cheese in the mushrooms, but otherwise, it was very good.  Thanks Angie, I'll surely be making these for my company :)  Cindy

I have never made these without 1)People freaking out and fighting over the last one and 2)there being NONE left over within about the first 15 minutes of a dinner party, and then people move on to the other finger foods.  I do add some chopped green onion and fresh minced garlic to the mushroom stems when I saute' them, and it makes a difference!

These are very good, & inexpensive! If you like these, try Dinah's stuffed mushrooms on this site. They are identical to The Olive Garden's and I think are even better, but I would make these again, depending on ingredients I may have on hand at that time. Thanks for the recipe.

I used 3 8 oz. cartons of small white mushrooms.  The amount of filling was just right.  They were excellent!!!

These were absolutely fabulous!  I don't like fresh mushrooms because they taste too strong, so I experimented with the everyday variety.  I made 3 dozen Christmas Eve, and barely rescued 1 dozen of those to serve for Christmas dinner.  They are easy to make, easy to reheat, and easy to serve.  I took another reviewer's advice and used some plain bread crumbs, and it turned out perfect.  I'm making more for New Year's, but omitting the cayenne on half for those of us who can't take the heat.  Had lots of leftover stuffing, but hubby quickly found a use for it!

These mushrooms are indeed "mouth watering".  I took the advice that I read in the reviews and add flavor by coarsely chopping the mushroom stems (not finely) and  I sauted the garlic and stems with half butter/oil, adding a spinkle of Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.  I added 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs and a little more fresh black pepper to the mixure Topped each mushroom with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.
Very good recipe.  Thank you :o)

I usually prepare the stuffing and put into a ziplock. Just snip off the corner of the ziplock, fill the mushrooms like a pastry and pop in the oven. Adjustments I make are I add sausage to the mixture which I find adds a little more substance to an otherwise very creamy filling. I like to sprinkle with parmesan cheese before putting them in the oven which adds a nice touch. A trick I use is to use smaller mushrooms so there is a good balance between mushroom and the amount of filling. I also lightly butter the mushrooms before baking which keeps them from drying out. Last trick is I bake them in mini muffin tin pans. They hold the smaller mushrooms perfectly and the pans keep the mushrooms from tipping over and rolling around. The cayenne pepper gives just the perfect amount of kick to this recipe.

Instead of plain cream cheese, I used a spread with cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and a few other garden vegetables in it. They were outstanding!

Exellent... had some cream cheese mixture left over so I took bread, cut off crusts, flatten with rolling pin, spread mixture fairly thick on bread, roll up, cover outside of roll with butter then freeze.  Take frozen rolls, slice into bite size pieces, place on cookie sheet so you can see the spiral then bake @350 for 10 -15 min.  YUM.  I used both rye and Italian bread. Both were good.

Loved It and so did my family! Not many modificaciones i had to make! Depending on the size of the mushrooms, you may have some StuffIt lector over. I did not use the entire 1/4 cup of parmesian cheese and instad of mixing It into the mixture, i sprinkled It o top. Also i did not have cayenne pepper, but I replaced it with chili power and it was just as good! Anything that leaves a little heat is a perfect substitute. Lastly I crumbled three slices of bacon into the mixture for my meat loving family. Next time I make these I will cut off a little of the bottom to keep the mushrooms from tipping over, but it was a great recipe that you can really put your own spin on, love it!

Short on time, I chopped the mushrooms and made this into a dip instead as another reviewer does and baked it until bubbly. Although the color isn't pretty, the taste is great. It would make a fabulous sauce for pasta as well, reminiscent of a mushroom alfredo.

Great recipe that I keep coming back to! Didn't have any parmesan so I cooked some bacon strips, chopped them and sprinkled some on instead. No complaints there! I once tried it with the larger stuffing mushrooms but it was just a bit much with all that cream cheese. I'll be sticking to using smaller, bite size mushrooms next time.

My husband said these were the best mushrooms he ever ate! Really simple to make. I opted to use the Wildtree Garlic Grapeseed Oil to cook the garlic & mushroom bits instead of just vegetable oil, which added even more garlic flavor. Also, I thought the cayenne pepper added the perfect amount of kick. I topped mine with some Italian bread crumbs and shredded Parmesan before baking. And, I also dipped the mushroom caps in melted better before baking.  I will definitely be making these again! Thanks!

I just made these last night.  I halved it for 4 people. Followed recipe exactly, but used the 1/3 lower fat cream cheese and added crumbled bacon from one slice. VERY good, but a little too "cream-cheesy".  I think next time I would add some Panko and one more slice of bacon crumbled up.  I did add Panko on the top, then added melted butter per another reviewer's advice. Baked these for 18 min, then broiled for a minute. Everyone loved these!

Outstanding! Made for news years day party.  Used my mixer to easily mix the filling/stuffing and that worked great. After stuffing them, turned them upside down and dipped them in seasoned breadcrumbs so they baked with a brown finish. Did not have onion powder so just sautéed 1/2 an onion with the garlic and stems. Making again this weekend for a party!

i just used this recipe to use up some french onion soup dip (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/french-onion-dip-from-scratch/detail.aspx).  i cooked the water out of the mushrooms first, then stuffed.  i also added some cooked sausage crumbles and a pinch of sage.  great jumping off point to make my own.  thanks for the inspiration Angie Gorkoff!

I thought this recipe was quite good and fairly simple to make. It  also had fairly quick and easy to follow directions. I did use an icing bag to fill 
my caps. This could also let you get fancy if you wanted to. Over all great recipe! Decided to try crab in half of them and paprika on a couple.

Not bad. I would not use the large mushrooms next time. The smaller ones are just easier to eat as an appetizer and seem to cook better.

GRILL them! Important to brush the exterior with oil and a pinch of salt or butter and use indirect heat, paying close attention to maintaining the 350 degree temp. Piping hot in 30 minutes. Recipe works fine when halved in 6 2 inch diameter mushrooms. Can't wait to try variations with bacon bits, green onion, etc.

A whole package of cream cheese just seemed like a lot to me so I only used half, and then cut the Parmesan and spices in half as well. I sed one package of baby bella mushroom and the amount of filling was perfect. These were great, easy to make,  and everyone gobbled them up.

After much experimenting, and with a few changes, this is my favorite. I add three slices cooked crisp bacon, soft breadcrumbs and use mayonnaise as a binder...no cream cheese.  Perfect!

I made this once before by directions and husband and I both like it a lot.  I tried doing the clam stuffed mushrooms and neither of us liked it.  I am now trying this for the second time only I added Italian Sausage, shredded Asiago Cheese, and Panko and Bread Crumbs.. I know were going to love it!! 12/20/14

Simple to Make. Recipe says pre time is 25 mins, more like 45 so plan accordingly. Made then for a party. I thought they were good but I had quite a few left over at the end. I think there was too much cream  cheese... Next time I will add some crab like others reviewer suggested.

The BEST recipe for stuffed mushrooms there is! It tasted perfect even the first time I tried it (and I'm no professional cook). My family loves this recipe and I make these mushrooms very often. Definitely worth the time.

I tried this recipe and loved it. It's super easy to make, I had it all done in just 30 minutes. I used cream cheese with onions and chives instead of the plain and the result was great! I truly recommend you try it!

I started by making these for special occasions.People LOVE them. I can't make enough to go around. I'm a vegetarian so I've gotten creative to make it healthy and with less cream cheese. To make it more of a main coarse I use portebello mushrooms and I also add finely chopped spinach and broccoli. These are to die for!

I got a HUGE response for these when I served them.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable and real onion instead of powder.  Per other reviews, I also gave the mushrooms a fresh lemon juice and melted butter bath before I filled them and I used a mini muffin pan.  My only recommendation is that the ratio is off for white button mushrooms.  I could have filled twice the number of mushrooms with the filling.  Buy extra mushrooms!

This was bland and soggy.  After sitting for a few minutes, the mushroom juices bled into the filling leaving the edges looking grey.  Not that tasty either.

Brought these for a Labor Day party.  They were awesome!  I used the chive & onion flavored cream cheese, no onion powder and used 18 mushrooms.  Could have probably even used 24.  They were pretty overstuffed.  Thanks!

Really easy recipe! My boyfriend said it was 'so good he wanted to cry!' and complimented it again throughout dinner. I left out the cayenne pepper since he doesn't like it, and sprinkled a bit of garlic and herb breadcrumbs midway through baking. Will be making this again!!

So delicious - everyone loved these.  I made a couple of small changes and caramelized some sweet white onion (about 1/4 of an onion) with the mushroom stems and garlic, then eliminated the onion powder.  Also, sprinkled the top before cooking with panko bread crumbs - Yummy!

I will make again with less cream cheese. My throat and mouth were coated in it with every bite. Will admit that I do not use cream cheese much but it balanced out the heat.

This is a great base recipe for stuffed mushrooms!  This is such a great party appetizer because they seem fancy and everyone is always impressed, but they are so simple!  I like to add 1/2 pound of pork sausage, browned and crumbled, I replace the onion powder with 1 finely diced minced onion.  I sauté the onion, mushroms stems, and garlic together before adding everything else.  I also like to sprinkle panko crumbs or even crushed ritz crackers on the top because it looks pretty.  I recommend these!  Get ready to impress!

This was a hit, and I didn't change a thing. Next time I would play around with other herbs/greens to add to the stems and garlic just for variety. Will definitely make again.

I always get compliments when I make this appetizer. I've made it so many times now, I just eyeball the parm. The only difference that I have made is using butter instead of oil. This is a favorite in our house.

SO GOOD! These are always the first to go when I make them for an event. I have to remind myself they are for the guest and not me. Always a hit.

I always prepare a new recipe exactly as written, then I have a baseline to go by. These were easy to make, and disappeared quickly off of the serving plate. I myself found them just a bit bland. The second time I made them I took two slices of prosciutto, minced them very finely, and added them to the cheese filling. I thought, as an appetizer, they stayed loyal to the Italian cheese, but with just a bit more punch.

Used baby Portobello mushrooms and topped with shredded mozzarella and grilled them in a foil boat until mozzarella was golden brown. WOW better than restaurant quality! Simply amazing!

We enjoyed these I took care in not changing anything in this recipe. I REALLY wanted to add a bread crumb topping but I refrained. I honestly think the family enjoyed these more than my regular recipe.

I used to think stuffed mushrooms required meat. This recipe taught me that they do not. Sometimes simple really is better. Note: I only use half the cream cheese called for. The whole package isn't necessary to fill all of the mushroom caps sufficiently.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I usually also add in minced onion and extra onion and garlic powder for extra flavor. A good recommendation: add sliced roma tomatoes on top prior to baking, and 5-10 minutes before they have finished fully cooking, add goats cheese on top of the tomato, switching it to broil so that the goats cheese browns on top. I also like to add fresh basil leaves on top once finished cooking. So delicious!

Simply Amazing. Did these for our pre-dinner appetizers and my family ate it all up within 5-10 mins. Ended up using 24 mushrooms since we had alot of stuffing left after 12. Next time I will leave out the ground cayenne pepper. It was just too spicy for my kids. Other than that it was so good.

I see I am way, way out in the minority here but we really didn't like these. The cream cheese was too much for stuffed mushrooms, it was like I crammed a dip into a mushroom cap and warmed it. I saw another reviewer also in the minority mention they preferred bread-y stuffed mushrooms: that must be it, I've eaten these in lots of restaurants and never have I been less impressed than these I took the time to make. I think I must like when seasoned breadcrumbs soak up the moisture from the sauteed mushroom pieces and caps and make a filling. I guess I'll look for other recipes and go from there. Thanks for sharing though, I can tell these are well-liked so I went with 2 stars.

This recipe is a keeper! Easy and very tasty.  I chose this recipe because I need to eat gluten free and didn't have any GF bread crumbs for the traditional recipe.  I made 18 generously stuffed medium-large mushrooms and even decreased the cream cheese to 6 oz.  I also used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. I was also short on time and it worked up very quickly.  Twenty minutes at 350F was just right - we like a little "bite" left to our mushrooms (not mushy).   The cayenne pepper is a must .  If you're afraid it will be too spicy, just use less.  I only used about a pinch of cayenne and it still gave a nice contrast to the cheesiness.

These are great! I made these last year Thanksgiving and none were left. Great reviews from all. I am making them again with the only exception I will be adding crumbled bacon to filling. Cause we all know bacon is awesome on everything.

This recipe was too cheesy and rich for me, which is saying a lot since I love cheese. I only used half of the cream cheese in the mixture and added some bread crumbs. I will explore other recipes before recreating this one again.

Fantastic!  Next time I may saute some diced onion with the garlic and mushroom stems, which I think would be a good addition.  No salt needed so don't add it thinking you need it.  I added a little extra sprinkle of cayenne to the tops of the mushrooms before baking.  YUM!

these are edible but still leave something to be desired.  I tried adding crab also and using flavored cream cheese but it still needs tweaking.

I've made these stuffed mushrooms many times now. Each time trying something a little different. 
The version which has gotten the best response was one in which I added shredded carrot and zucchini and finely chopped green onion to the standard filling. All sauteed along with the mushroom stems before adding to the mix. Not only do they taste amazing they have a little more flavor and texture umph. Shredded carrot and zucchini are now standards in all the stuffed mushrooms I make. 
Last week I made some using clams diced finely. To that I added a small dab of ricotta cheese in the botton then stuffed as usual however I did omit the cayanne pepper in this one. Another try included sprinkling a small amount of dry packaged italian dressing mix into the cream cheese along with the addition of finely chopped spinach. Again I omitted the cayanne pepper in this batch.

even people who don't like mushrooms love this recipe.  I go light on the cayenne pepper because not everyone likes the spice.
the mixture is even yummy stuffed in chicken breast!

I made these for my birthday this year as an appetizer before we started to fondue. It's a good thing I started late on these, or I don't think we would have even started cooking! I made a ton of these, and not one survived. My parents asked for the recipe, and my roommate told me I needed to make more. The only thing I changed was that I melted some butter and lightly brushed it on the bottoms of the mushrooms before they went in the oven, otherwise they were exactly as stated. They are to die for, I'm already gearing up to make them again!

I personally have a huge distaste for mushrooms but decided that these would make a great Valentines day surprise for my boyfriend who rarely gets to eat home-cooked mushrooms. The recipe was really simple and quick to make, which as a new cook was fantastic! The leftover stuffing from the mushrooms was used on a bagel and devoured instantly while the mushrooms were in the oven. As soon as they were out three of them seemed to disappear right in front of my eyes! My boyfriend loves this recipe so much that he's requested that I make them again for him on his birthday! Thank you so much for this simple and (apparently) tasty recipe!

I wasn't overly happy with this recipe especially for the prep work. I was going to give it a 3 because I did eat some of these mushrooms, but there are so many changes I would make. I like to try recipes as they are written so that I know what I would differently. 1. I would definitely add the bread crumbs, crab or sausage to the mix. It just lacked substance. 2. I felt it also needed a little saltiness to the mix.Maybe a 1/8 tsp of salt? 3. I thought it also needed a little savory flavor. Maybe a little Worcestershire sauce or bacon. 4. The spice of the Cayenne pepper took away from the flavor. I would cut it back by half. 5. I would also add bread crumbs to the top of the mushrooms and broil for a few min as they needed a bit of a crunch. I would make a variation of this recipe.

These are absolutely fantastic as-is!  I have made them many times, and they are always the first thing to get eaten.  Sometimes I add a little white wine to the bottom of the baking pan.  YUM!

This recipe was a major hit at Christmas!  They were eaten up within 5 minutes!  I added a bit more chayenne pepper (personal taste), green onions instead of onion powder, doubled the garlic and added more cheese.  I did make two days prior and that was wonderful to only have to pop into the oven.  I will make again, and again, and again...

This recipe is amazing and always a sure fire hit. After making it so many times to it's exactness, I started making my own variation on it. I add one small finely chopped onion and sautee that with the garlic and mushrooms until everything is nice and brown. Once I mix the veggies with the cream cheese, I add a few more dashes of onion powder as well as garlic powder. Then, the last 10 minutes of baking, I add grated parmesan on top along with shredded parmesan. They turn out GREAT! Make sure to set aside some for yourself, because they will be gone before you know it!

I make this often, the only thing I would offer is that you can use more mushrooms as there is more stuffing.  It is really the best and my family often requests it.

Yum! I did make some improvements: 

- put the mushrooms in the oven, stem side down, for ten minutes in a pan w/ a rack on the bottom. This allowed my mushrooms to release some of their water. I hate stuffed mushrooms that are watery. 

- added about 1/4 lb of well chopped hot Italian sausage to the mix. 

- took 1/4 cup of panko crumbs and browned them in a pan w/ about 2 tsp butter and 1 tsp of the sausage drippings. I sprinkled these on top, then threw on some parmesan. I used shaved parmesan for more substance (larger pieces). 

My husband said they were the best he's ever had, anywhere.

I have made these several times for parties and they are always a hit. Delicious, just as stated, no need to change a thing. I put the mix in a ziplock baggie and cut a small hole in the corner to squeeze into the caps. So easy and quick.

Great vegetarian option. These mushrooms are great. I always add fresh steamed crab to them and bread crumbs on the top for texture. Crushed crackers work as well.

I did find the taste of cream cheese a bit overpowering and some of the mushrooms were spicier than others. So, make sure you really whip that filling very good. 

I still liked them and will make them again with some tweaks to the recipe with some suggestions on here. Thanks!

Delicious! Super easy and very tasty, borderline addictive. Only modification we made was half ricotta half cream cheese, instead of just cream cheese. We did have quite a bit of filling left over so we put some bread crumbs on it, made a patty and pan fried it. Also delicious, then again we're from wisconsin and up for any kind of fried cheese.

I have been looking for a meatless stuffed mushroom, and tried these because of their popularity on this site. I'm sorry to report that I was disappointed. I didn't find them flavorful enough, and the filling lacked "substance". I may try them again, adding some bread crumbs and mozzarella to the filling. I confess that I did make a small change - I added a minced shallot with the garlic - but I don't think it detracted from the original recipe.

These are SO GOOD! I added 1 can of crab meat to the mixture & some chopped onion. Also sliced the mushroom caps off so they sit flat on the pan. No one can resist these mushrooms & there are never any leftovers.

I made some changes after making it once using the recipe exactly as is. 
A 5 star version would be: add 3/4 cup of crumbled blue cheese and 3 pieces of cooked bacon chopped to the mixture. To the topping add about a half cup of crushed cruchy onion topping (like Frenchs) and a few crumbles of bacon on each.
 I get rave reviews everytime I bring this places.

I thought these mushrooms were great and simple to make. I didn't have any parmesan cheese and after I got started I realized I didn't have as much cream cheese as I thought I had either. So, I used feta cheese and nutritional yeast to make up the difference. Turned out great. I also added some Italian seasoning to the mix and as other people suggested, topped the filled mushrooms with bread crumbs before putting them in the oven. The only downfall, according to my husband, was that I didn't make enough. ;) Thanks for the recipe!

We had a wedding for friends of ours this past weekend at our home.  For dinner I served Hawian chicken (I must submit it-I'ts WONDERFUL). I served these mushrooms on the side.  It's the first time that I've tried at home.  Well , I was happy to see that there were 4 left.  Yum...can't wait for them to leave so I could indulge myself.  Much to my disapointment when I went to clean up, they were all gone.  I guess they really were delish.  Thankx for a winning recipe

These mushrooms are unbelievable! The only changes that I made were I added 1 tablespoon fresh parsley and I cut the amount of cayenne in half ( I thought it may be a little too spicy) and it worked out perfectly.

Filling was great!!!! I added crab meat, green onions, and a little panko to filling.  I cut up a few pieces of butter to stick in between the mushrooms while they were baking & put slices of white american cheese on top before baking.  PERFECT & WILL DEFINATELY MAKE AGAIN

Don't put too much stuffing into the mushroom. I put in extra and it was too rich and overpowering.

I couldn't find really large mushrooms, so I used the regularly packed white mushrooms. I bought three 8 oz packs, and ended up getting 35 caps filled with the amount of filling that I ended up with after doubling the recipe. My husband really loved this recipe. I had to stand guard so everyone could get a chance to try them.

These were easy and great.  I followed other suggestions and sauteed finely chopped green onions along with the garlic and mushroom bits. Topped with a little bit of italian panko breadcrumbs and parmesan.

Made these for a dinner party recently and they were a hit.  I also shredded extra parmesian on top prior baking as I cannot have enough cheese.

Simply great. Comments helped me a lot to improve the recipe. I also sprinked the mushrooms with parmesan cheese and used muffin form. I used champignon (probably also known als white button) mushrooms.

I made these for my boys and I for our "Meatless Monday" meal. They raved about them! I doubled the recipe, and we had no leftovers. I thought they were yummy, but that maybe there was too much cream cheese. I could not point my finger on it on what my taste buds were trying to tell, but they were still good. Did I mention there was no leftovers? I did leave out the cayenne, since I have a boy who is slightly sketchy on "hot" items. I also had some onion I needed to use up, so I tossed those in with the garlic. Will make again.

A little spicy for our taste.  They did bake perfectly in a regular muffin pan.  I brushed the mushrooms with olive oil.  I used a bag to squeeze the mixture into the mushroom.  I recommend not swirling it in because when it comes out baked it looks a little yucky.  It was not brown at 20 mins so I broiled it for 2.5 mins.  It really needed something on the top for garnish....like bread crumbs.

I made these for a superbowl party at a house that was strictly vegetarian. These came out fantastic. I used indian curry and used more of it since we are all big spice fans and these were out of this world! I also made a triple batch and had some stuffing left over. The stuffing made a fantastic cheese spread!

Pretty good; I used 2 pkgs of regular sized button mushrooms, and next time, I'll halve the recipe; I had a lot of filling left over. Tastes great and guests loved them!

Very good!  Added chopped onion and bacon.  I also dipped stuffed mushrooms into bread crumbs and broiled for 5 minutes after inital 20 minute cook time.  I did only use about 2/3 of the block of cream cheese like other users suggested.  Great base recipe!!

These are excellent! I love the cream cheese option! This much cream cheese will actually fit into more mushrooms. I made a double batch for 24 mushrooms and probably could have just used the normal amount for that many mushrooms.

Easy to make and delicious. I added bacon crumbs in the filling. For convenience, I think the filling could be prepared in advance and kept refrigerated for a day . Next time, I think I will add buttered bread crumbs on top.

No complaints, however, large mushrooms that need to be cut in order to eat do not appeal to me.  Smaller ones that are bite size would be a better choice.  I sprinked with a little bread crumb before cooking.  They turned out nice but no "Wow" factor.  However, we all agreed that the leftover mix used with sliced celery and crackers was a hit!  Next time I will make it as a dip instead.

I loved this recipe, the recipe was so simple to follow and the mushrooms were a hit for New Years Eve, I never thought they would be tasty because of the cream cheese, I'm going to try adding some mozzarella next time to see how it turns out, besides their good as is, very good recipe.

I use small portabello mushrooms and follow this recipe but before baking, I wrap the entire mushroom & filling with a strip of bacon - as you know, bacon makes EVERYTHING better!!  :)

I made these for the first time today.  I don't care for mushrooms but my husband does.  Some large ones were given to us recently so I made some exactly as written.  My husband says "perfect".  He likes spicy dishes, so he loves these.  It's a keeper for us.  I just added a little grated Parmesan and cayenne on top of  the filling.   Thank you Angie.

These little guys were a massive hit at my Christmas Dinner party! I did modify the recipe by adding bacon, 1/4 cup of panko bread crumbs and topped with cheddar cheese.  I've been asked to make them now for New Years!

I think these mushrooms are one of the best things I've ever tasted!!!  They are sooo easy to make and were a hit when I brought them to the in-laws for Christmas dinner!  If you like mushrooms, you've GOT to make these!  My mouth is watering just thinking about them.

Halved the cream cheese and added pecans & bread crumbs.  Also added a bit of sherry while sauteing the garlic and mushroom stems.  Left out the pepper.  Very good!

These are amazing!  We often add either double smoked bacon or mild Italian sausage meat to the basic recipe with great results.  I also cut the cayenne down to 1/8 of a tsp because I find them a little too hot with the full 1/4 tsp.

Very good, but if I make it again, I'll reduce the amount of cayenne to 1/8 teaspoon.

These were great!  I followed the recipe to a tee and the filling for each mushroom is very generous so mound it on.  Everyone at the party loved them.

Very yummy! My husband couldn't stop eating them, even after we arrived at the dinner party.  I wanted them hot at the party so I quickly placed them in a dish.  There was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the dish when all was said and done. It kind of made the last ones left soggy.

I did everything it said but I left out the cayenne pepper and I added onions in my electric chopper with the mushroom stems and garlic along a little crumbled bacon (I had cooked up already). But the one big thing I changed that made such a difference was; I rolled the empty mushroom caps in a little raw egg and then bread crumbs.  It was amazing!!!! It was so creamy yet a little crunchy on the outside from the bread crumbs. ENJOY!

These were fantastic.  And what's better is I made them in the morning and kept them in the fridge until my company came and then put them in the oven.  Even the kids like them.

If there is extra filling, it is perfect to make some jalapeno poppers as a side appetizer with the mushrooms.  Clean, seed the peppers, fill and cook for same time/temp. And diced bacon never hurts this filling!

These were good.  I felt the skillet time was kind of long to get the moisture out, but the biggest drawback is the thick texture of the filling.  Because there is little else but cream cheese, it is like eating a spoonful of it!  The taste is good as long as they are hot or warm.  Reheat right away for best taste.  If I try this again, I may add breadcumbs or something to give more variety to the texture.

This was really good.  I made half the filling for 12 mushrooms, and still had some left over.  I also added a chopped shallot to the mushrooms and garlic when I sauteed them.  I used half goat cheese, and half light cream cheese. Topped each mushroom with panko breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese.  Also broiled for the last 3 minutes to get the tops nice and brown.  They disappeared in about 2 minutes!

I had never made stuffed mushrooms before I tried this recipe.  First I would like to say that it’s much easier to make then I had though it would be and these are so GOOD….I don’t think I’ll be looking for another stuffed mushroom recipe because we love this one.

Stupendous! This is my go to appetizer: easy to make, EVERYONE loves them. When me girlfriends come over there is always a special request for these...  I feel like they get soggy and fall over when I baked them as such, so I wrap foil tightly over the open top of a pan and poke holes in the foil and place the filled mushrooms on the foil so any leaking liquid can strain into the pan.. sometimes I mix in imitation crab into the cheese mixture before filling, pretty tasty that way too (a little lighter on the cheese, and changes the texture a little bit).  Bon appétit!!

Was a pretty good recipe. Although the changes I would/did make: I used 12 gourmet stuffing mushrooms, I would use half the oil since it didn't evaporate completely and I had to spoon out the excess, I would use garlic powder next time since the minced was slightly overpowering, I only used half of the cream cheese and STILL had leftover stuffing mixture, I didn't time the baking... I just "eyed" it, and when there was what seemed to be about 2 minutes of baking time left, I added a good size pinch of shredded cheddar cheese to the top of each one and pushed it down slightly so it stayed on top... :) For my first stuffed mushroom recipe, I was pleased! :)

I picked this as suprise for my husband who loves stuffed mushrooms. Being the first time I made them, I was not pleased. They were pretty salty and we ended up tossing them, which is too bad. They looked nice, but didn't have the flavor I was hoping for.

Fast. Easy indicator when done. Available and cheap ingredients. Forgiving proportions and great as a base recipe. Better and cheaper than any restaurant. 1. Instead of adding cream cheese at once, do so slowly to get a soft but firm consistency (no mush). 2. Easy to experiment on using diff vegetables, fillings (I used canned crab meat), spices and cheeses (why not try with salmon-flavored or veggie-flavored cream cheese?). 3. If you have extra stuffing, it already has cooked ingredients and can be used on bread as a tasty snack. 4. Good idea to brush mushrooms with butter. 5. Take breadcrumbs (I prefer panko)  and put in a small bowl and if your mushrooms aren’t too overflowing, turn it over gently and place on dish so that the crumbs stick easily to the mushroom.

These are pretty good as is.  I have made them 3 times, though and discovered this last time that brushing some melted butter on the bottoms of each cap really improves the taste and texture.  My guests who've had them both ways agree.  Also, I use the smaller mushrooms - I made them the first time with "super stuffers" and they were difficult to eat, the smaller ones can just be popped in whole.  I still use 12 stems, but the filling goes a lot farther - I got about twice as many stuffed mushrooms (though they did disappear much faster!).  Overall, a very tasty recipe!

The best! It's better eaten fresh from the oven.  Like others, I added 1/4 cup bread crumbs (in my case panko) to the cream cheese. Then I pressed  the stuffed mushroom unto real bacon bits and then to a plate of panko.  It gave a bit of crunch and it browns well.  No need for oil spray.  The bacon bits and panko adheres easily to the cream cheese mixture. Looks pretty!

First time making stuffed mushrooms meatless and without bread crumbs. Followed recipe. Placed cream cheese mixture in Ziploc bag to fill mushroom caps. Added crabmeat to the mixture. Not a fan of crabmeat, but everyone raved about it at Thanksgiving dinner.

I made a few renovations to this recipe.   First I cut the cayenne pepper in half (I used 1/8 tsp), I added 1/8 tsp oregano, 1/8 tsp basil, and 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Before putting the mushrooms into the oven I sprinkled them with a little bit of Parmesan cheese.

I have grown up eating stuffed mushrooms on every holiday however I've grown tired of my families version (sausage and pepperoni stuffed) that I needed something new.  I've tried them stuffed with walnuts and cheddar but these are by far the best.  I had a party last weekend and I doubled the recipe for 5 people and had many other items prepared and NOT one mushroom remained.  My friends loved them so much that they invited themselves over again this weekend and forced me to triple the recipe, and this time 4 people came and only ONE mushroom remained.  We might take a break for a while but when we're ready, we'll be making these guys again.

If I could rate this recipe for more than five stars, I would. This recipe is classy, elegant, and delicious. On top of all that, it's so easy to make. You would definitely impress guests with this one, just like I did. I made this exactly as the recipe stated, w/ the exception of leaving it in the oven for about 25 minutes instead of 20 (by mistake actually), but it still turned out to be scrumptious. Do not for a second hesitate to try this out. Thank you for this recipe!

Wow, these are wonderful.  I found that I did not need the entire 8 ounce package of cream cheese.  I followed the recipe for the filling with the exception of only using about four ounces of the cream cheese.  I baked them for twenty minutes at 350 degrees and they came out perfectly.  This is the type of dish one would expect from a professional caterer - you will amaze guests at a dinner party with these delights.  Thank you so much for the recipe - these are delicious!

Good but not sure if its worth all that fat. Eat all twelve mushroom caps(which isnt hard to do!) and you've consumed an entire block of cream cheese! Felt as if it could use a lil extra something in the filling.

These were very good, but a little rich.  I can definitely see where they would be amazing with crab meat in them.  I think next time I may add some bread crumbs just to cut down the richness of the filling.

These were good, but not 5 star.  Followed recipe exactly, except that I sauteed the mushroom caps for just a few minutes in a little EVOO so they were a bit softer before stuffing. Just OK in our opinion.

These were a big hit at our house!  I made one substitution.  Instead of cream cheese I used Tofutti's Better Than Cream Cheese product (Whole Foods carries it).  Before you say EWWWW I have to tell you that my cheese loving husband also said EWWWW.  He had it in his mind not to like these before I made them.  To please me, he tried them. And HE LOVED THEM AND WANTED MORE (so I shared the last one with him)!  We could not tell a difference between cream cheese and this product so I felt I had to share that with you all.  No dairy, No Butterfat, No Cholesterol, No Hydrogenated Oils.  A 2 tbsp serving is 60 calories, 5g fat (2g Sat.), 120mg sodium, 2g carb, 1g protein.  Compare that to regular cream cheese which has 83 Cal per oz, 8g fat per oz (5g Sat.),25mg Cholesterol, 188mg Sodium. The carbs and protein are very similar. If you're a Vegan (we're not but we're trying to cut down on our dairy consumption) or you're allergic to dairy or you're lactose intolerant you can still have these mushrooms and not miss out on anything.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Angie!

These were ok--I thought the cheese filling was a bit too much/too rich, and it was way too spicy.  Next time I will half the cayenne and add ground sausage to give it something "more", but I wouldn't make it again "as is".

These taste amazing! The only complaint i get is that it's a bit too cheesy.  So i'll probably use a little less cream cheese from now on, but they're always a hit whenever i bring them to a party.  I love making these and this recipe is definitely a keeper.

These were the best stuffed mushrooms I ever had.  My only complaint was that the filling was a little messy to eat.  But, otherwise, a great app for us low-carbers.

Yum, these were good! I altered the recipe slightly. I added a can of crab meat, and 1 diced green onion. The filling was enough for 28 mushrooms, and I could have easily stuffed a few more. They were wonderful and I wish there had been more! The cayenne pepper adds a nice kick. These are cheesy and wonderful! There wasn't a single mushroom left and everyone wanted more!

I followed this recipe exact....and while the mushrooms were edible, they were nothing to write home about.  I ended up doing a lot of "doctoring up" to get them suitable for company.

SO DELICIOUS!! My husband stated that these were the best stuffed mushrooms he had ever eaten- even better than his own mother's (whose are also very tasty). I like to have meat in my stuffed mushrooms, so I fried up a little extra lean ground beef. I went ahead and just added the all the ingredients to the meat while it was cooking, then cooled it off, and mixed in the room temp. cream cheese. I would also recommend to use smaller mushroom caps as other reviewers have suggested- unless you absolutely LOVE cream cheese, the smaller mushrooms can balance the mushroom/cream cheese flavor. YUM!!!!

This recipe is to die for! I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Perfection.  I did sprinkle shredded mozzarella on a couple of them during the last 5 minutes of baking. They were all great, both with the added cheese and without.  Wouldn't change a thing!

I made this last night for my "Girls Night In" wine/appetizer party.  I kept it very close to the original recipe.  The only substitute I made was olive oil for the veg oil and because of many previous reviews I also halved the cayenne pepper thinking it was going to be "hot."  I didn't taste the cayenne at all so next time will use the full amount. I also put just a tiny pinch of bread crumbs on the tops.  The mixture filled 36 small button mushrooms and there was still plenty left over (that I'll use later today with the rest of the mushrooms).    I also put the mushrooms on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet as previous reviewers had mentioned.  This not only made the clean up a breeze but also kept the mushrooms from getting all soggy on the bottom.  It only took the suggested 20 minutes to cook and I also broiled them at the end for 3 minutes to give them added crunch.  It has a great flavour and my friends liked it as much as I did.  There were only three of us and we ate every last shroom!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very good! Although I doctor it up ALOT! 1st of all, I use baby portabellas. I use finely chopped onions and a slice of red or yellow pepper along with the minced garlic. Sautee it all in butter. (Dieters beware!) Then after cooling, add only 2 oz. cream cheese, & more mozzarella than parmasian. I cut it all in half & add crab meat & more red pepper to half of it. Broil for the last few minutes. Overall it really takes about an hour to prepare & cook, but worth it!

Yum!  I made them for boxing day at my sister-in-law's and everyone loved them!  We were traveling, so I made the filling up ahead of time.  I took the stems out and only washed them.  I rewrapped the caps and didn't wash them til I was ready to cook them. I didn't have onion powder, so I diced up fresh onion and cooked it along with the garlic and stems.  Once that was cooked, I split the mixture into two separate bowls and after it was cooled, I added 1/2 of each of the ingredients to each bowl.  To one of the bowls I added a can of cocktail shrimp and a can of crabmeat.  I covered the bowls, kept them chilled, and cooked the mushrooms 3 days later.  They were fabulous. I will definitely be making these again!  Bravo!

This recipe is AMAZING!! I make it all the time for company. It's super easy to put together and can be made last minute. I do make a few adjustments though. Instead of using onion powder, I finely chop up a sweet onion and throw it in with the mushroom stalks and garlic. That totally makes it. I also substitute the cayenne pepper for "Sriracha" or "Asian Rooster Sause". It's cheaper then the pepper and gives the mushrooms an amazing taste with a little kick!! I sometimes make a double batch of the filling and use it as a dip with Ritz crackers.. LOVE IT!!!

The concept is good, but the filling has barely any taste or texture, and this would be best with a crab dip filling. Even folling the recipe and adding crab meat would improve it significantly! Also, they are a bit spicy with all that pepper, I would recommend using a little less.

A friend of mine discovered this recipe a couple years ago and I've been making them for special occasions ever since.
Matter of fact, I made them for her wedding. Only additions I make are chopped crisp bacon and chives. Caution, they are addictive!

Scrumpdiddliyumious! :D I doubled the recipe exactly and took this to Thanksgiving dinner. They were a hit!! I did take a hint and rolled the caps in melted butter before stuffing, it really made them "mouth-watering." A sprinkle of parmesan cheese before baking for 15 minutes was perfect. Yup, 15 was all I needed.

I followed this recipe kind of loosely.. I used only 3oz of cream cheese and approximate amounts for the other ingredients. I also used garlic powder instead of minced garlic since I couldn't be bothered with worrying about it burning while it was sauteed with the mushroom stems. I mushed the cream cheese together with the spices and stems in a Ziploc bag instead of trying to mix it in a bowl, and used the Ziploc bag as a pastry bag to fill the mushroom caps.

Even with my modifications, this recipe is fantastic! I noticed that liquid formed under the caps after only about ten minutes but I let them cook the whole twenty and they came out great. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, 8oz seems like a bit much. 3oz filled 13 mushrooms for me!

Very tasty. After reading the reviews, I only used 6 oz's of the cream cheese, included 1/4 cup of Italian Bread crumbs, added green onions and crumbled bacon.  Also brushed the mushrooms with butter and breadcrumbs and topped off with breadcrumbs.  They were a hit! The cayenne gives a tasty spicy kick!

Really good.  After reading people's comments about time consuming here's a little tip.  Any time I stuff something whether it's eggs, jalsapenos etc.  I mix everything in a food processor and then put it in a gallon size freezer bag, snip a corner of the bag and simply pipe it in.  It's fast easy and less messy.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I made these for my husband tonight.  He loves mushrooms but not new recipes.  He is on his second helping of these. I myself don't really like mushrooms but decided to try one.  They are good.  I did follow the recipe to a "T" for the first time.  Tasted good to me!!
Thanks for the recipe.

It doesn't get much better than these.  My kids loved them, my boyfriend who is not a huge mushroom fan loved them and so did I!  I used light cream cheese.  I didn't have quite enough parmesean so I added some shredded mozerella to make up for it.  I also used all my cayenne on the red beans so I used chinese "rooster sauce" instead.  I was surprised that it said to chop the mushroom stems but did it. I used my hand held food chopper and it worked great to mince them up finely and boy did they look and smell great when cooked with the oil and garlic!  That alone would be great on pizza!  Excellent recipe, will make these many times again.

My 18 yr old son found this recipe to do for his girlfriend's graduation party. His experience in the kitchen, so far, has been limited to the microwave. I was skeptical, but hopeful, and hung around the kitchen to see if he needed any help. He tripled the recipe, followed everything listed but went a bit lighter on the garlic and cayenne pepper. These turned out fantastic and a huge hit!! We got to the party shortly after it started, and by the time we got through the food line the mushrooms were almost gone! This recipe has now been added to my collection. Thank you!

Used this for a potluck, it was fantasic and the recipe has been requested more than once!

I used 20 medium sized mushrooms and still had a bit of stuffing left over.  I also used a bit more parmesan and 2 chopped green onions for some color and added taste.

Excellent!

These were so good! I loved them. I did a couple changes. Since I was only making them for myself, I used 10 small mushrooms and only 4 oz of cream cheese. I didn't have any onion powder so I used about 3 tablespoons fresh onion finely chopped and I sauteed it with the mushroom stems and garlic. Also, I omitted the pepper and cayenne because I don't like it. After I filled the caps, I still had a lot of the filling left over, but I'll use it for something. I loved these!! I know I'll make them again!

Outstanding recipe!  I made these mushrooms for a family dinner and all mushroom lovers raved.  I found that one batch of filling filled approximately 18 fairly large mushrooms (with slight modifications).  Also, I added 1 T. of finely minced sweet onion to the mushroom sautee and used half olive-oil and half butter.  (I still added the onion powder although I used minced onions, too.)  I made 2 separate batches of filling:  one crab and one bacon.  For the crab filling, I added two 6 oz cans of well-drained flaked crab.  For the bacon filling, I added 5 thick-cut strips of finely chopped smokey bacon (I also added 1 tablespoon of bacon fat).  I used my Pampered Chef self-releasing scoop to put generous portions of filling on the mushrooms, then I sprinkled them with a very fine coating of unseasoned bread crumbs and parmsan cheese.  Yum!  One last note:  although we love spicey foods, we thought the cayenne added too much hotness and actually detracted from the other savory flavors in the recipe.  I suggest omitting it.

I used this recipe for cocktail party i was having during xmas holidays. I have since made it about 6 more times! Everyone loves them and can't get enough even when i double the recipe. The only thing i have changed is a little less of the cheyenne pepper, but don't delete it, it really makes the mushrooms!

Excellent!  Big hit over the holiday's.  Do make sure and let the garlic mixture cool before mixing with the cream cheese-turns out much better when you do.

These were delicious!!  Fairly easy to make.  I used a ziplock baggy with the end cut off and piped the cheese mixture into the mushroom caps.  For a bit of zing, I added dill weed - otherwise made according to recipe.  I would make again!

Dee-lish!!!  I made these for New Years Eve, my first attempt at making stuffed mushrooms, and they were a hit!  Fun to make, takes a bit of time, but they were so tasty.  I read other reviews that they were quite "cheesy", so I didn't fill them too much, this was a good balance between the shroom and the filling.  Will definetely make these again for appys!

AMAZING!  My husband hesitated to try them at first, then when he did his eyes rolled in the back of his head.  He ate half of them before the party started!  I followed the recipe exactly except for I took the advice to rub butter on the mushrooms before cooking them.  I had to double the recipe & still had plenty of left over stuffing.  I also sprinkled extra parmesan cheese on top of the stuffing before cooking the mushrooms. I found this recipe a little time consuming though.  I saved the stuffing & plan on using it...my husband has been begging me to make them again tomorrow.

These are great as is but they are so easy to doctor up a bit.  I made them for a get together about a month ago and have since been requested to bring them to 3 other parties.  I added ground up andouille sausage and sauteed onions, a little chipotle tobasco and WOW. Great recipe!

This was an easy appetizer to make!! I wanted something to go with spaghetti and meatballs and this was a hit.  I added bacon bits and green onions to the mix and it was a wonderful addition.  I would recommend adding a T. or so of Worcestershire sauce (that was personal preference).  Thanks!!

FANTASTIC!! This is always a hit when I make them. I find the amount of filling makes WAY more than 12 mushrooms. I make a non-spicy version by leaving out the cayenne pepper and adding some dried basil, and a bit of extra garlic. Still delicious. I also use an icing press to do the filling, so it looks very pretty on the mushrooms; also very easy to fill them.

These were out of this world! The only thing I did differently was to fry the chopped mushrooms in olive oil and added minced onion instead of powder. I used the useful tip to cup off bottoms of them so they would sit flat and included those peices in my chopped mushrooms. Putting the cream cheese mixture in a ziploc bag as suggested by some made this a breeze. I will definetly make these again, maybe adding some bacon next time. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Awesome! I added bacon and green onions and they were sooo good! I followed a previous reviewers advice and used a mini muffin tin to hold the mushrooms.  That was such a help!  I also used the smaller "one-bite" mushrooms.  The extra filling I used on crackers.  It's good any way you eat it.

We had these last night for dinner and everyone thoroughly enjoyed them!  There is enough stuffing for at least 24 good-sized mushrooms.

By the number of raters alone, you can guess that this is good. I am not allowed to shop up at potluck's for our Sunday School without these. I generally cut back on the amount of cyanne just because we have some nursing mothers in class, and I use fresh onions because that is usually what I have.

Now I know why so many people reviewed and loved this recipe. It is special. It is delicious with a few tweaks. I prepared the filling (minus crab) the day before event. For a bridal shower with 25 people, I used 1-40oz container of large shrooms(from Costco) and 1-16oz. smaller shrooms. I then only doubled the recipe. I used a generous amt of garlic (2-3T.) and sauteed stems, garlic, and 3 thinly sliced green onions. Let cool and then mixed in crm chs and spices, inc 4 dashes worcestershire.  Meanwhile, b/c the shrooms were large, I precooked them for 8-10m. at 400. Then cooled (drain out liquid).  The day of event, mixed in crab, assembled, sprinkled with parm chs, & baked. They were great!!!!!

These are AWESOME!  Perfect for anyone on a Gluten-Free diet.  Easy to prepare and delicious!  I used a pastry bag to pipe in the filling.  Quick and easy.  There was a lot of filling left over which I heated with some heavy cream and served over penne!

I brough these to a Christmas party as an appetixer abd everyone LOVED them. I was surprised out how hot the cayenne made them and could do them with or without that next time. They were SO quick and easy to make and I thought the recipe was great as is, though the idea of adding crabmeat as one reviewer mentioned sounds good to try. You will not be disappointed.

This recipe will be a permanent fixture in my recipe box! Wow! They take a little time, but soooo worth it. I did sub the minced garlic for 4 fresh garlic cloves, pressed. I also didn't have the cayenne, so I used some dry pico de gallo seasoning that was in the cabinet and it still turned out great! I have company coming in soon, so I'm going to mix the stuffing ahead so I can just fill the caps and pop into the oven. Wonderful!

yum! these were so good and so easy! i changed a few things - i added the spices to the garlic and stems while sauteeing them...at the end i dipped the stuffed mushrooms into an egg and water mixture, and then dipped them into a breadcrumbs and parmasen cheese mixture...they came out perfect!

I'm a real spice-wimp, and found there was too much cayanne in this for my taste.  Our guests really enjoyed them, but I will put less cayanne in them than the recipe calls for next time.

WOW! where is that 6th star when you need it. This was great, I doubled for a party and they were a hit.The pepper adds just a little warmth(not enough to even call it heat), and an added flavor to really set it off. thanks for the new party favorite

Don't look any further for a stuffed mushroom recipe.  These were sooo good!  I didn't change a thing, except to double the recipe for a party.  I was a little uncertain about the cayenne pepper, but once I tasted them, I understood why the recipe calls for it.  Great recipe!

Wow, I took some advice from other reviewers and cut down on the cayenne however that is a matter of taste. I did add some finely diced green capsicum to the mushrooms and garlic while sauteing. I did not fill the mushroom cups to much and used lge mushrooms to use them as a side dish. Thankyou for this lovely recipe.

I was really excited to make this recipe.  It sounded delicious.  I even added crabmeat as one other reviewer suggested.  They looked and smelled great coming out of the oven.  Once past the initial "kick" of the cayenne pepper, I was left with a very bland taste. My guests were not very impressed and more than 1/2 were left.  I won't make these again.

I made these for a Year Year's Eve party and most people didn't enjoy them.  Most said they weren't horrible, just not that great.  I have to agree.  It was just too much cream cheese taste--needed some additional ingredients  to balace flavor.

Party Hit!  Stuffed small to medium mushrooms instead of large & sprinkled tops with Italian Bread Crumbs before baking.  Kept 70-80 warm in a chaffing dish at parties & they were a hit!

These were pretty tasty. I did like the heat from the cayenne. Used 36 mushrooms but only half the stems and kept everything else the same. I'm thinking that they would be better with some dry bread crumbs on top like suggested by another reviewer. Thanks I'll probably try it that way in the future.

I made a quadrupal recipe for a party and they lasted about 20 minutes. Everyone loved them! I guess it depends on how big your mushrooms are but i had some leftover cream cheese mixture. (I used the leftovers to stuff some chicken breasts the following day for dinner) I added a bit more cayenne than the recipe called for and gave em a little extra kick. Every time I am invited to a get-together, I am asked to bring these.

I made these for a dinner party and everyone loved them.  I used 18 medium sized cremini mushrooms instead of button mushrooms because I think creminis have a better flavor. I arranged them on a serving platter with a bunch of fresh parsley for decoration.  This appetizer is a bit labor intensive, so make the stuffing ahead of time and chill until you are ready to stuff the mushrooms.

These are awesome, which is obvious by all the great reviews.  I've made these several times and they're better each time I make them.  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly.  Now I just guess the measurements and taste the cream cheese mixture to make sure I like it.  It's so easy to adjust this recipe so that it suits your tastes.  Sometimes I sprinkle with bread crumbs or parmesan.  My next goal is to figure out how roll them in bread crumbs and fry them, like the 'Shrooms at Houlihan's.  I love this recipe, but Houlihan's has the best stuffed mushrooms ever!

This is the best recipe for stuffed mushrooms.  I added 1 can of crab meat and stirred in about 1/2 c. of italian bread crumbs.  I have made this recipe several times and everyone is always looking for more.  Thanks!!

These were so tasty that I'm adding them to my Thanksgiving menu this year!  I took other reviewer's advice and made only half of the filling.  I was still able to generously fill 22 medium sized mushrooms.  Once the filling was in each mushroom I dipped them in seasoned breadcrumbs and sprinkled them with paprika.  Yummy!  Lastly, they freeze great, just freeze before cooking and pop in oven whenever you need them.

OOO BOY!! Were these GOOD! I used a little less cream cheese since I saw alot of reviewers suggested that. Also, I didn't have cayenne pepper so I subbed with a little grounded red pepper. I also added a little seasoned bread crumbs to the cream cheese mixture. They were gone within minutes!! Everyone LOVED them!  :)

This was one of the first recipies I found on Allrecipies, and one of my absolute favorites! I make it for parties or I just put the finished mushrooms in the fridge and reheat for dinner at night. Stuffed mushrooms are wonderfully versatile! It tastes and looks professional and delicious.

These were great! Be sure to double the mushrooms because it's too much filling for just 12. I also took others advise and topped them with bread crumbs.  Delicious!!

I'm sorry, I just didn't like this recipe.  The stuffing had a weird sour taste, and just didn't taste very good.  It was very heavy in the preperation area, took a long time and the end result just wasn't worth it at all.  :o(

I made this for New Year's and they went very quickly.  Definitely makes a lot more than 12, I stuffed almost 30!  I didn't have onion powder, used minced onion instead.  A little time-consuming to chop the stems so finely, but worth the effort.

This was a hit!! I've never had mushrooms quite like this.  They were absolutely delicious.  I followed others advice and cut down a bit on the amount of cream cheese and also added a bit of flavored bread crumbs.  I will definitely make these again and again.

If I make this recipe again, I will change a few things.  (1) Substitute part of the cream cheese for another kind of cheese -- there was way too much of this thick cheese.  (2) Roll the mushroom caps in melted butter before baking, as many stuffed mushroom recipes call for -- the caps were too dry, I guess because of their size and thickness.  (3)  More spices to zing up the flavor.  Don't get me wrong, the recipe wasn't bad, it just wasn't what appeals to me.

Very good and tasty went quickly. I had to stop myself from eating them all before anyone else tried them.LOL But just a word of caution, I tripled the recipe for larger amounts (the recipe does make more + stuffing) I tripled the cayenne also, I like it hotttt anyway but for those of you who have people who do not like spicy foods keep it 1 or 2x. I'll use it again for Christmas. Thanks

I loved this recipe!  The stuffing made twice as many mushrooms. I used garlic pepper instead of fresh and it turned out great.  My father is a vegetarian and he wouldn't leave them alone!

This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms, so I wasn't too sure how they would turn out.  But they were amazing!  I made them for a graduation party and there wern't any leftovers.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I did make a few changes per other reviews; I doubled the recipe and I only used 12 oz of cream cheese and I added about 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs.  I also added more garlic.  Thank you Angie for sharing this wonderful recipe!  I'll defintely be using this in the future!

I only used 5 oz of cream cheese; could cut back to 4 oz and still have enough.I should have redueced the cayenne pepper in half too so spicy made my nose run. All the other ingredient quantities remaind as stated in the recipe. Next time I'll add cayanne a little at a time and taste as you go. Great snack for those on a low carb diet.

These mushrooms were just okay.  Both my husband and I thought they just had way too much cream cheese in it.  The recipe has potential though, so we will cut the cream cheese in half the next time we make it.

Wow, these are fantastic!  I fried the mushroom stems and garlic in bacon 
grease (nothing goes to waste in my house!), added some very finely
chopped prosciutto, and stuffed the mixture into baby portobello mushrooms.
Too bad I had to share them-- I could have finished the whole plate myself!
I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used fat-free cream cheese, which turned out pretty good.  Twenty minutes wasn't enough to bake though.  I will make again, but will bake longer.  I also sprinkled parsley flakes on top to add some color.

I must have a thing for tweeking recipes.  However, I used this recipe to fill four portabella mushrooms.  I used freshly grated parmesan, added a cup of shrimp, 1/2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning (adds quite a bit of spice) and topped with seasoned bread crumbs for browning.

I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and I put breadcrumbs on the top to brown a little more.  I wasn't that impressed with these but the boys at the Superbowl party loved them...so what do I know =)  I will probably make these again because they are something different and fun to make!

These were okay. I thought some of the measurements were a little off. I used twice the amount of mushrooms and less than half of the cream cheese. I still had some of the mixture left over! I might try again when I have more time to fiddle with the recipe.

I made these as appetizers for Christmas Day, it has become something of a tradition for me to make something for the first time and try it out on everyone on each major holiday. Needless to say these were a hit, and I am making them for New Year's Eve as well.

You won't be disappointed with this recipe!  I made it with only 4oz cream cheese, 1/4+ cup bread crumbs, 6oz crabmeat, and cheddar on the top.  Very good!  I will definitely make this again.  I tried both white mushrooms and the little portabellos and they were both fantastic.  Bite sized went over better with my crowd, so don't bother looking for large mushrooms.

Great - if you add some bread crumbs to keep the stuffing from oozing all over the place.  I have made them 6 times, and they always get devoured.

Truly mouth watering.  After reading the rave reviews I made this for the first time for a dinner party last night, and since it was the only appetizer on the menu, I was a bit nervous about it.  However, it was very good and a big hit at the party.  Thanks!

This recipe was a hit.  I made if for new year's eve dinner and everyone loved them.  My only advice would be to make sure you have at least 2 per guest. I had made 40 for a ggroup of 26 and there wasn't a single one left.

I made these for our Valentines Dinner this year & my boyfriend thought they were GREAT! So did I, by the way. I've made them several times since then. I too cut down the cream cheese to half, & added bread crumbs. I also added cooked, chopped Shrimp. Mmmm, Mmmmm GOOD!

Absolutely excellent!!  I cut the cream cheese in half and added a 7oz. tin of drained crab meat.  This was the first time I had ever eaten or made stuffed mushrooms and I'll definitely be making them again.  My guests loved them!

This is one of my go to recipes for side dishes, since mushrooms are one of my favorite foods. I use white pepper instead of black and simply double the measurement it calls for. I also add one or two jalapeño peppers for a little more heat (I deseed them and use about half the ribs), and sauté them with the mushroom stems and garlic. I always use my food processor to mince the stems, garlic, and jalapeños. Since I always have quite a bit of filling left over, I always buy mini bell peppers to fill as well. Just cut them in half, fill them, and cook right along with the mushrooms for the regular time. It never fails to come out beautifully. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great base recipe and flexible enough to accept all sorts of filling options and works decently for peppers too. 

I added 1/2 Tb Garlic paste to the diced stems about halfway through the saute instead of minced whole garlic. I left out the cayenne at the request of one of the guests. I also added about 1/3 cup bacon bits just because I had them handy, and about 1 Tsp toasted onion powder, and about 1 Tb finely chopped fresh parsley.  I used twelve 2"- 3" portabellas, and had enough left over to fill 3 jalapenos sliced lengthwise with seeds and membrane removed. After removing from the oven I sprinkled everything with fresh shredded parmesan and sprinkled a little smoked paprika on top, mainly for presentation. The jalapenos were as well received as the mushrooms, probably . because the mushrooms were not spicy at all. 

Other things you may want to try in the filling
Pimentos
roasted red peppers
popcorn shrimp
crab meat
different cheeses with the cream cheese
black olives
finely diced shallots
Capers (beware of over salting)
anchovy paste (beware of over salting)
Fresh chives
Fresh Basil
Poppy seeds

Just a wonderful base recipe to add to your toolbox.

The texture was perfect and they tasted great, but 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper was over poweringly too spicy for me and my husband.
I will try it wit 1/8 of a teaspoon next time.  Otherwise it's a gtest recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  No one could believe that they were actually "lo carb," and several girls asked for the recipe. I did leave out the cayenne, only because I'm not a fan of "hot."
But 12 mushrooms are not enough for 12 people. I made 48 for a group of 16, and they all disappeared, even though there were many other offerings  at this party.  I'm sure I'll make these again!

The stuffed mushrooms were a hit with my Thanksgiving guests!  They’ll become one of my go-to appetizers.  I prepared them earlier in the day, refrigerated them, and baked them shortly before my guests arrived.  They disappeared fast!  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

These really are mouth-wateringly delicious! I did make some minoe changes.  I added 8 oz. of ground sausage. I added a minced shallot to the garlic and sauted in the sauge fat, not oil. I also deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup of dry white wine, allowing it to reduce by half. I also used chive and onion cream cheese. I sprinkled the top w/ a romano and bread crumb mixture. After filling 25 baby Bella mushrooms, I still had some filling left. I made mimi tartlets with it. Also, I only tasted one so far! They're actually for tomorrow. Definitely will make again!

I left off the topping part because I did not have any parmasean cheese on hand. While these were really good, I felt they lacked a bit of flavor depth. They essentially tasted like a mushroom just stuffed with cream cheese, with a tiny kick from the cayenne pepper, even after adding small bits of green onion. Next time, I might consider adding small bits of finely chopped bacon and more spices. Also, I used more than the 12 mushrooms because there was extra filling. I ended up with a total of 18 mushrooms in the recipe. Overall, a good base recipe to start.

As it stands this is an okay recipe, but we personally thought the filling was too cream cheesey. I added the chopped mushroom stems and also about a cup of chopped crab meat, but it definitely didn't add enough texture and flavor for us. In the future I'll add more mushrooms and meat to the filling (and maybe some parsley and lemon). I'll definitely try these again.

These are the BEST. No more marinated mushrooms with steaks for me. I served them with steaks for NY's dinner and the company loved them. I followed the advice of several reviewers and baked them in  the muffin pan, with muffin papers. I cleaned them, put the cleaned mushrooms in a ziploc bag and then into a rectangular ziploc container to protect them from breaking in the full refrigerator. I did not have the room to store them stuffed; so,  after  mixing the filling I stored that in a separate ziploc bag. That made for no cleanup and easy filling.  
I used Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan as my niece doesn't like Parmesan, and left out the cayenne as my nephew-in-law doesn't like spicy food. I also followed the advice to add the cream cheese to the still warm skillet and mushrooms and it was very easy to mix. It's well worth it to individually pick 12 mushrooms out of the loose mushroom bin so that there isn't as much size variation and you get exactly 12. They reheat well, and they are also good cold. No crabmeat is needed in them, they are perfect as is, and are now my go-to mushroom recipe. Thank you Angie Gorkoff!

The recipe is great as it is, I'm sure. However, since 1) I didn't have a couple of the ingredients, and 2) I was feeling a little lazy, I did change the recipe just a tad. First off, I didn't have any fresh garlic so I opted to use about a 1/2-1 tbsp (use your judgement here) of garlic powder. I omitted the onion powder for the same reason. I did not bother with sautéing the stems. I just discarded them. I used a baking dish and painted the bottom. I had some plain Panko breadcrumbs and poured them in a small bowl and dipped/rolled the tops of the stuffed mushrooms to coat and placed them in the baker. Then I brushed melted butter on top of the Panko crusted mushrooms and baked at 350 x 20 minutes. I did end up having to broil at the end of the cooking time to achieve browning. They turned out great!

I haven't made these yet because every review I have read has changed the recipe.  Its really freaking annoying.  MAKE THE RECIPE AS STATED, THEN REVIEW.  If you want to make changes based on your rating, then do so.  But make the original first.  Geez.

If I made it again I would halve the cream cheese and instead replace the half with crab meat, bread crumbs or some other filler.

We absolutely love these!!!  I have made them at least 50 times!  Everybody wants me to bring them to parties!  The only thing I do different is I add 6 slices of well done bacon that I crumble up and mix in with the stuffing!  I have even made just the stuffing and put it inside bacon wrapped chicken breasts to give them a delicious flavor!  This is by far one of our favorite recipes!

This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms and they were a big hit.  Since I don't like food with a kick, I left out the cayenne pepper.  After stuffing the mushrooms I thought they looked too plain...white filing on white mushroom. Therefore I chopped up some green onion and sprinkled it on the top of the filling. On half of the mushrooms I put some paprika to add more color.  I used a long handled infant spoon to remove the stems of the mushrooms. It worked perfectly!! I used the same spoon to fill them.  I made half a recipe of filling and filled 18 smaller mushrooms. I bought a package of white mushrooms and picked out the smaller ones. The contributor of this recipe must have used very large mushrooms to get only twelve out of a full recipe of filling.  Next time I make these, and there will be a next time, I will add more garlic.

These were delicious! I took the tips from earlier reviews - went with the smaller mushrooms ( 2 containers), but did not double the stuffing and still had plenty. Sliced the bottoms so they would rest flat on a cookie sheet and then dunked them in melted butter and parm cheese. Also dunked the top of the stuffed mushroom in Panko breadcrumbs and parm cheese.  I did need to broil them for a minute or so to get a nice color on top.

So yummy and so easy! After stuffing I dipped them in bread crumbs just to give them a little crunch, but I'm sure it didn't change the flavor any, just the texture a little! Definitely will keep this recipe!!

I make these all the time and they are a hit. I add 1/4 lb. of chopped cooked bacon and use the grease to cook the garlic and stems and if you have the ability. SMOKE THEM

Excellent just the way it is. The second time I made them sprinkled the tops with Italian seasoned bread crumbs before putting them into the oven. Gave them a little crunch. I also plan to add or top with bacon next time.

So delicious and so easy to make. It tastes even better than restaurants. I added shredded chicken, onion, green onion to the filling. I think you can really add any ingredients you like. I also topped it with shredded cheese before I baked it.

I used ricotta cheese, while milk, instead of cream cheese. I then added some crab meat and sauted green onion with the finely chopped mushrooms to my mixture. The family loved it and we had to make a trip to the store for more shrooms!!

These mushrooms are really good when you follow the original recipe. For my family, I made a few changes on my second time making them, since I really don't care for parmesan cheese. I added chopped green onions, Italian style bread crumbs, butter and shredded mozzarella cheese instead. I did not use the mushrooms stems, as it seemed like a step I didn't really need to do. Also, topped with more mozzarella cheese and baked them in about ½-¾ cup white wine.

I don't like mushrooms but I wanted to make these for a party after seeing the reviews. They disappeared so quickly, big success! Wrapped some up for my mom and she ate them 4 days later and said they were even better. My husband is begging me to make them again today. My only change was using smaller mushrooms to make more appetizers.

this is a great quick recipe if you got a craving for stuffed mushrooms.  I made this with baby portabella mushroom and they held shape very well.  I would go with a little less cayenne pepper.

Easy to make, few ingredients....
Next time, will try sprinkling with breadcrumbs or mixing some into cheese mix to help keep the cheese together.

This is a very good recipe!! I now have a pregnancy craving for them lol, I followed all the instructions, the only things I added were chopped clams, and after I stuffed them I dipped them in Italian breading. I may use a little less cream chess next time when I make them to have the other flavors stand out more :) there being made again tonight too lol

We love mushrooms.  We love cheese.  Who doesn't love Garlic?  But something about this just didn't work for us.  I think I would consider slightly less parmesan and maybe mixing a third flavorful cheese into the mix.

This recipe was a hit! I will definitely be making these  again.  The only thing I would add is maybe some bread crumbs or maybe use less cream cheese. I thinly chopped the stems but in my opinion that was not enough for the amount of cream cheese that was called for.

Made these for Christmas. I accidently purchased baby bella mushrooms, but forged ahead anyway. Went over like gangbusters! Have done different variations: adding Italian sausage, trading out cream cheese for mild herbed goat cheese. Always a hit! Thank you.

This was really easy to make,  and they were really good. The recipe made too much filling for me, so I stuffed the mushrooms very generously and still had some leftover. It has to do with how big the mushrooms are, but either way, they were really good.

This is the first time I have ever made stuffed mushrooms.  They turned out great! My husband loved them and I also thought they were very good and I don't really care for mushrooms.  I did roll the tops in Italian bread crumbs and parmesan.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good, the flavor is great! I would watch out in putting too much filling in the mushrooms  though as it seemed a bit over powering.. I will make again!

This was absolutely fantastic!!!!  Brushed  mushrooms with butter, added crab,  parmesan cheese.  After stuffing topped with panko & cheese.  Next time I will use med size mushrooms & add  to the stuffing either celery or green  onion chopped real fine.  This is a keeper.

This recipe is the best! However, I did kick it up one notch .......added to the cream cheese mixture 4 slices cook and crumbled bacon.......my husbands idea! They were grand!! I would make them for sure to take to someones home!
I did try and hollow out some of the larger mushrooms with the small end of the mellon baller. It helped to use more stuffing! Yummm!

Wow! With a can of crab meat, and the buttery seasoned panko bread crumbs, its definitely a keeper. Wife LOVED it (so did I), and we're not big fungus fans. Or fish either. :)

I tried this recipe and it turned out very good.  My husband said it was a keeper.  I added Laotian chile paste 'cause I was out of cayenne.  I added bread crumbs on top to get a crunchy taste, and I also added a couple of capers on top at the end.  I am going to do this recipe again and this time I will add the crumbs and capers at the start.  I also used 4  oz. of soy cream cheese.  It was no different than regular cream cheese.  I also added finely chopped onions (instead of onion powder) and half a red pepper.  Thank you so much for such an easy basic recipe that we can modify as we wish.

I didn't read any reviews and just made as written except used light olive oil in place of veg oil. Excellent as written! Now, after reading some of the reviews, I see that there are many ways to dress up the recipe and will give some a try; especially some seafood...but the original recipe is awesome. Thank you!

I used about 24 regular sized mushrooms and they made a great bite-sized appetizer.  They had good flavor and a little cayenne kick.  Hint - serve with toothpicks.

These were so good and easy to make the only advice I can give is to use a bit less cayenne it took a little of the mushroom flavor away

These are excellent. I add a good tablespoon or so of worcestire sauce and a few drops of Frank's Red Hot sauce, also I let them cook for about 10 minutes and then top them with shredded cheddar. Then cook another 10 minutes.

These are really good--I liked them because they were lighter than many stuffed mushrooms, which are heavy on the bread. I will add a light dusting of breadcrumbs on top next time, just to give them a little more texture.  I added some Italian seasoning blend, and increased the spices a bit (about 1/2 teaspoon total of each).  This was just enough to give them a little kick, but the flavor was still cooled by the cream cheese and mushroom flavors.  Everyone loved them. Just make more than you think you need, as they disappear very quickly!

Served these as an appetizer at a dinner party.  They were gone in seconds.  Absolutely delicious. Like others suggested, I used a mini muffin tin to hold the mushrooms stable.  Worked out perfectly.

Don't let the four stars fool you, this recipe is AWESOME! I try to rate recipes as written and this one could use bread crumbs to make it truly 5 stars but I was super impressed. I made these on a trial run last night and they were gone in no time flat! The filling is really creamy, so one of my sons kept suggesting that I add bacon next time because, according to him, bacon makes everything better. Next time I will add breadcrumbs and maybe bacon for him, but I had NO complaints other than that they ran out too fast.

I followed the recipe to exact....it was a great sucess at last Sunday football gathering i did put the parmesan over the mushrooms after they were cooked... I love longhorns stuffed mushrooms but this was better.... i played around with how long to cook the stems and garlic  but it all worked out but next time i will cook maybe 5-10 min longer.....the recipe said 12 mushrooms but will have enough batch for more if needed....
thanks for the recipe i will be be making these more for football games

I made these for our Christmas party and everyone loved them! It was already finished before all our guests could come. They're easy to make but a little time consuming, but it's totally worth it! It is the perfect appetizer.

Awesome, versatile recipe! Makes more than enough filling, but you can use the filling for other stuff so it's awesome. The next day we had tomato soup with tortillas spread with this filling. Mmmmmm :)

Loved it!  The cayenne pepper really kicked it up, and the cream cheese tamed it down just enough to balance it all out.

Wow! Absolutely dee-lish. Followed the recipe exactly - except used only 4 enormous mushroom caps. These caps were so big (not portabella size - but close) that they made an excellent side for today's recipe of the day - Marinated Flank Steak - which, by the way, was also delicious. Served with a Mediterranean orzo salad. Excellent meal! Raves from all!!

Amazing!  These didn't last long.  The filling/stuffing also works as amazing dip for chips and veggies or as a spread for sandwiches and wraps.

When I make it just as a spread I use half as many mushrooms (but use caps and stems) as called for in the recipe and I also tend to add smoked paprika.  Absolutely fantastic!

Delicious recipe!!! Apart from using low fat cream cheese & olive oil instead of veg oil, I followed the recipe as is. It helps that for the most part, you probably have most if not all the ingredients laying around begging to be used, lol!! My husband (who unlike me, is NOT a 'shroom lover) won't stop raving about these!!!  The recipe is easy, DELICIOUS & a keeper. People this is worth a try........you won't regret it!!

Amazing!  Everyone at Easter dinner wanted the recipe.  The filling made enough for way more than 12 mushrooms--I think we filled more like 27 or 28!  Will definitely be making these again and often!

This is a delicious recipe.  I have followed it exactly, and it's amazing.  I have also tried it with lots more mushroom added to the filling.  And that's really good too, more mushroom flavor.  I put it in a ziplock bag and snip off a corner so I can pipe the filling into the mushrooms. I always have left over filling.  I just freeze it and use it again within a week or so.

Substitute 1/2 teaspoon Allepo pepper flakes for cayenne...all the flavor, and not near as hot.  And a 1/4 cup of finely diced and sauted onion instead of powdered onion, fresh is best!

I really liked it. I lightly cooked the mushrooms in Worcester sauce before baking-also I added bread crmbs-personally I am not big on spicey food so I just added a sprinkle of cayenne before they went into the oven instead of the 1/4 tsp-still had a kick.  This is my first time cooking stuffed mushies and really like it! Another reviewer mentioned using a Ziploc bag=great idea. I did try to spoon the stuffing in..but the stuffing wasn't cooperating. So I admitted defeat and used the Ziploc bag. keep adding ideas guys!

This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms and this recipe was perfect. I did roll the tops in seasoned bread crumbs. Everybody lived them. There was a extra cream cheese mix so I used it as a spread on crackers.

I made this for superbowl sunday and it was a hit. I did add crab meat and it came out so yummy.  Everyone loved it! Will make again.

So, first off, I hate mushrooms.  That said, I love these little darlings!!!!  I added bacon.  Add whatever you enjoy.  This recipe is highly adaptable.  I might have stood in the kitchen and eaten the extra filling right out of the bag. . . but I'll never admit it.

husby rated this 5 stars, I rated 4. I added scallions and crushed italian breadcrumbs for more flavor & texture. I will have to try making it with crab next. The fresh parm makes a total difference.

Delicious! I used 24 smaller mushrooms to make more finger food like. Used a baggie to pipe the cream mixture in the shrooms. I made the day before, put on a baking sheet covered with parchment, covered with foil and put in the fridge. When I was ready to heat the next day I removed the foil, topped with parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs, and dipped caps in melted butter. Next time I think I'll add panko breadcrumbs for more of a crunch! Everyone loved them!

initially i cooked some bacon sausage eliminating the olive oil.  This gave the stuffed mushrooms a lovely smokey flavor.  I also topped them with Italian stuffing.  They were a huge hit.

Very good. Followed the recipe as written and will definitely make again. Next time I will add black olives to the stuffing mixture. I followed other's reviews and dipped the caps in butter prior to baking. Also, I made these the day before and popped them in the oven before serving. I love apps that I can pre-assemble. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks, Angie!

Yummy! I made these for the first time as Thanksgiving apps and EVERYONE (I had 15 people over my house) raved about it. Save yourself time and do what another reviewer said and make the stuffing the night before and store it in a ziplock baggie. One recommendation? Try and use larger mushrooms. Otherwise, keep the recipe as it! Do not need to change perfection!

Yummy!  Ended up with waaay too much cream-cheese mixture after stuffing my mushrooms... I will use only 1/3 of a package of cream cheese next time so there's no waste.  SUGGESTION:  When mixing the cream-cheese mix, throw it all in a Ziploc and 'mush it around' until mixed.  Then cut the end off and "cake-frost" the mushroom caps.  Makes it so easy!  No need for a spoon.  And you can get a cute little twirly at the top of each cap!   :)

Tasty!  I read some of the other comments so I only used 6oz of cream cheese and only half the cayenne pepper. This worked well.  I only had onion salt, no onion powder so I opp-ted to mince up a green onion instead and added it to the mushroom, garlic saute. After stuffing the mushrooms I added some italian bread crumbs to the top and sprayed some butter.  These were yummy and gone quickly.

I didn't have any onion powder, so I threw in dried minced onion with the stems and garlic on the stove.  I followed the rest of the recipe to a T, and these were fantastic!  The filling makes enough for twice the amount of mushrooms though.  I had 26 mushroom caps, but used the same amount for filling and it was perfect!

It only gets a 4 star because I did what another person said and doubled the parmesan cheese, dipped the mushroom in butter, and then bread crumbs before stuffing. Other than that I did just what the recipe said and it was wonderful!!

YUM! These are simple! and so quick! We used our ninja and blended the stems! I think next time were gonna add onion and maybe a little less cream cheese. I love veggies so I'm thinking maybe so green pepper too?

Agree, a little time consuming, but definitely delicious!
We also added green onion in the saute, brushed with butter as to not dry out the mushroom, and added breadcrumbs to the top.
Some of the guests thought they were a tad "spicy" but not enough to stop eating them!  We had them as a side to a steak dinner.
Great recipe, will use again! 
:)

Very delicious! Goes very well with steak as a side dish. I used olive oil instead of the veggie oil, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe 100% and they were so yummy!

Good base recipe, but needs modification. I made it as written; however, next time I'll likely cut the cream cheese in half, and add some bread crumbs and some other flavor enhancers.

I was a little doubtful, so I made a half recipe to try them out. They turned out excellent by using mushrooms that were large enough to stuff. Will definitely be making these again.

These are the best stuffed mushrooms! They are super easy to make. I cut the cream cheese in half because I always have left over filling. Adding a little paprika and increasing the pepper enhances the flavor.  Make sure to double the batch because they will go fast.

So good and ridiculously easy! I added onion and spinach to the sauteing mushrooms, and basil and oregano. The filling makes too much for the amount of caps.  Be sure to read the other reviews, as there are many helpful tips.  Very well received!

These were pretty darn good, but I'm awfully glad I added extra ingredients to the cream cheese. I used about twenty / twenty-five mushroom stems that were very meaty and cut up a few whole mushrooms as well, four cloves of garlic, about 2/3 C Parmesan and Asiago cheeses, and doubled the onion powder. This was still very cream cheesy. Next time, I think I'll add some chopped yellow or green onion, and perhaps even some cooked ground sausage.
These are very filling! I made a bunch of these and we had them with meatless marinara and penne pasta. Yum!

I've made many different stuffed mushroom recipes - some with sausage, some with crab, some with stuffing, all of which are delicious but I was searching for a recipe with just cream cheese when I came across this one.  First things first, they were a hit!  They went so fast that I barely had a chance to get two in before they were gone (which is a good sign).  I made them EXACTLY as the recipe calls for and luckily I had bought extra mushrooms because the filling makes more than 12 easily.  I will definately be making these again because they were so quick and easy to make and that's a big plus in my book.

The only change I made to the recipe was to use a few drops of tabasco sauce because I didn't have any cayenne pepper...the mushrooms disappeared between 2 people in mere minutes :) Thanks for sharing and for all the reviews.

This recipe is amazing! But I have changed it quite a bit since 8oz of cream cheese is enough for as much as 5 dozen mushrooms depending on how creamcheesy you want to make the stuffing mixture.  I go with the spices of the recipe and add spinach and onion to the mix when I'm cooking the garlic & mushroom.  This has made the flavor of the filling so much better and them healthier in cutting the amount of cream cheese per mushroom and I personally like the texture better too! Excellent suggestions in other reviews!

Absolutely wonderful! Everyone loved them. I have made them twice now and used a little less of the Cayanne pepper the second time. A bit too spicy for the people who aren't crazy about spicy. Still a great recipe. Love Love Love!!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I loved stuffed mushrooms that are stuffed w/anything other than bread stuffing! I added fresh chopped green onion to the cream cheese mixture. They all were gobled up in no time!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  The next time I try it I think I'll make a few changes.  This recipe calls for too much cayenne.  The amount tasted fine in the mixture, but it was overpowering after it cooked.  The cream cheese was also too heavy.  I think next time I will use about half as much cream cheese and add 1/4 cup or so of monterey jack.  Twelve mushrooms weren't enough, I had to use about 20 small to medium mushrooms and cook them for 25 minutes.  I will also cook these a bit longer next time or par cook the mushrooms first.  This recipe is a good good base, but needs a little work.

Made this recipe exactly as written and received rave reviews.  My husband LOVED them.  Using 12 mushroom stems and the ingredients above, I was able to fill close to 20 mushrooms.  Will keep that in mind for next time.  And there will be a next time!  Looking forward to playing around with the recipe a little bit too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good base recipe. I sauteed mushrooms, garlic and shallots in olive oil and butter.  I added some Worcestershire sauce to the the mixture and brushed with butter and topped with just a bit of panko bread crumbs for crunch. Also the mixture was enough for 22 large stuffing mushrooms.

TFS!

I tried this recipe tonight and felt the cream cheese needed some breadcrumbs or quinoa mixed in.  It was too mushy.  The picture above definitely looks like breadcrumbs were, in fact, sprinkled on top, just not included in the recipe..

Soooo good and easy. Replaced the cream cheese with goat cheese (all of my friends are allergic to either gluten or dairy or both) and used peccorino romano instead of parmesan. Will definitely make these for more girls nights and parties! Love them!

Just not satisfying. Added sautéed onions, bread crumbs, 1/2 cup sour cream, two slices cooked bacon, and worcestershire to recipe.  Dunked the caps in melted butter before baking.  Cream cheese just overwhelmed the other ingredients.

i cut the cream cheese in half just because for the amount of mushrooms i had i knew i'd waste it. But i left the same measurment of spices. Which i definitely should've thought to cut the cayenne in half! hahaha . Got "rave" reviews they were gone in about 7 minutes after coming out the the oven. I was going to make more but didn't wanna rush to the store on thanksgiving day for mushrooms ;) plus i was just testing it on people. Now i know i will have to make them every holiday with this group. But I'll have to pick up a bunch more. A lot of people were saying add crab. I can't stand Canned crab. Only fresh king. so thats the only way I'd add the crab. they are great without it. Thanks for the recipe. OH and when i read pepper. I automatically added the same in salt, not realizing the recipe didn't call for it

Very easy to make....my family and friends request them at every function!!! I have always added more cayenne pepper than the recipe calls for if you like it with more of a kick. You can also make extra and freeze before baking. They come in really handy.

Loved it!  I made it as a side dish & it out shined the main dish by far.  I think it'll be good with the addition of bacon bits.

These are unbelievably good! I thought it would be more work but they were cleaned assembled and filled and in the oven in 10min. My only recomendation is not to use very large mushrooms or the filling is too much, bite size is better and i did add the crab meat glad i did perfect

Spicy kick to these delectable little gems from the cayenne pepper.....delicious!!  This is a keeper and would be welcome at holiday gatherings and celebrations.  So simple to make ~ even for the less experienced cook.  I topped mine with both the Italian-style bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese before baking.  Scrumptious!

I thought this recipe was excellent. I added my own little twist. Instead of plain cream cheese I used an onion and scallion flavored one. Came out great. Looking forward to trying more from this site.

Followed the recipe exactly (except cooked ~30 mins rather than 20 mins) and it was pretty good. Next time I might try adding fresh thyme or maybe more cayenne since I didn't think it tasted spicy at all.

I did everything the direction says, except added some bacon crumbles and bread crumbs on top. I dont like mushrooms unless they are bbq'd on the grill, but these were AMAZING! My hubby really loved them as much as me! The flavor is just delicious!

This dish is awesome.  The only thing I don't like is I found the mushrooms a little too soggy.  To change this, I'd pre-baked the mushrooms in a 400F oven for about 10-15 minutes or until the water leaks out of it. Then, soak up any additional moisture with paper towels.  Stuff the mushrooms and bake the mushrooms for another 10-15 minutes.  Serve while hot.

Hope this helps :)

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!   I made these last night for my husband's birthday dinner, and he instantly started gushing over them!  The spice is perfect.

 I added some chives in the stem and garlic mixture to give some color and freshness. I also brushed mushrooms with butter and dusted with italian bread crumbs before filling and cooking.  My husband raved about them all night!  He said they were the best stuffed mushrooms that he'd ever tasted, and that they were gourmet restaurant quality.  Best part?  I made them ahead of time, and filled them just before baking.  Yay me!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are so flavorful!  I've tried other stuffed mushroom recipes and this one is by far the best!  I did use crab meat instead of the mushroom stems.  Thanks for a great recipe!

THis recipe was a huge hit. My father-in-law ate over half of them and asked for more. I used portobelo mini mushrooms and but the cayenne in half as we are not not and spicey people. They were an amazing treat and I will be making them again. Thank you!

I am not sure I have ever made anything that tasted this good before.  I doubled the recipe and instead of cooking the garlic and mushroom stems in oil I diced up 4 slices of bacon into tiny pieces and cooked that with the garlic and the diced mushroom stems.  For my version I used fat free cream cheese and reduced fat parmesean and turkey bacon.  My husband who eats little to no carbs said they were like the best thing he has ever eaten.

Awesome - I make these all the time, lasts me at least a week (I put them on a paper towel lined plate so that they don't get soggy and cover with saran wrap). I have a few with dinner or lunch every day! I top mine with aged white cheddar!

These were very popular at my son's highschool graduation party. People kept asking where 
I bought them! I told them: I bought the mushrooms at the farmers market, the cream cheese at grocery store and already had the spices at home!

Excellent recipe, easy to prepare, and everyone loved them. My hint would be to get these prepared and stuffed ahead of time, and then pop in the oven as you're ready to serve. Mine sat for a while and were still great, but would have been better piping hot from the oven! Recommend!

Great recipe!  I found that it was too creamy for my liking so I only used 2 oz for the next batch I made.  Even with this measurement I had filling left over!  12 mushrooms was not enough, I definitely had to use more mushrooms.  Next time I will try breadcrumbs on top and use a lite version of cream cheese.

Instead of onion powder, I added a little freshly minced green onion to the cream cheese mixture (because I had those on hand and no onion powder). It tasted SO amazing! It made the dish taste fresh.

The recipe as written is excellent for parties, but it is a bit too rich for every day eating.  If fixing just for the family, I'd cut down on the cream cheese.  I reduced the cayenne pepper and added a pinch of curry powder.  Yum.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make! Only modification: it seemed too spicy, even though both me and my husband enjoy (moderately) spicy food. We reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/2 the amount recommended and it was perfect.

I love some good stuffed mushrooms and let me tell you, these are no exception! Great appetizer to make for a party or snack for yourself! I have also used baby portabellas which turned out great as well! Another suggestion is to save some of the stuffing, which I always end up having a ton of leftover anyways, and use it for vegetable dip, sandwhich spread, or even as a melted topping for grilled steak. Good stuff!

This is my favorite stuffed mushroom recipe, whether I make following the recipe or whether I tweak it.  Try topping it with bacon crumbles or french fried onions.  :)

I wanted to make stuffed mushrooms for a party but never did like the recipe I typically made - you know, the classic one with breadcrumbs and bacon and lots of labor.  So I found this one and wondered if almost 2000 rave reviews could be wrong.  They were NOT! 

 My guests were over the moon for them.  I heard comments like:  "I NEVER eat mushrooms, but these are amazing."  The next time I saw one guest, his first question was, "How did you make those mushrooms? They were fantastic."  "Usually, stuffed mushrooms are just a lot of bread. What is in here??" (I heard that one twice.)

The only change I made from the original recipe was to add a couple of slices of day-old bread to the food processor while I was preparing the mushroom stems and garlic.  I did not bother with any other topping, as some reviewers did.  Personally, I think they are great as they are.

I prepared them the night before and put them on a baking sheet lined with parchment, which made clean-up a breeze. The next day, I put them on the bottom rack of the oven at 350 and just let them cook until the tops browned.

Thanks for a show-stopper recipe!

I had never even tasted stuffed mushrooms let alone made some so I felt like I was on an adventure. And to add to the excitement I made them for a luncheon where I had invited 5 of my girlfriends.  They turned out wonderful!  They look great on the plate as an appetizer.  They tasted even better then they looked.  Best of all - recipe was requested, so I know they were liked.

This recipe, although very simple, it is a little more time consuming than noted, and cook time for me was 30 minutes instead of 20.

Excellent! I made these for Book Club and they were gone in short order.

I used smaller mushrooms to make them bite sized, and ended up with about 30.  The filling mix makes a lot, so plan accordingly.

Thanks for a great appetizer!

I love this recipe because #1 they're delicious without any tweaking!!  And #2 because they're gluten free and low carb, but not something you need to announce as being so -- everyone just loves them regardless.

This recipe is amazing!  I bought the real parmesan, some lump crab meat, and crimini mushrooms that were medium sized instead of the giant white stuffing mushrooms.  This is restaurant quality and not that difficult.  Thank you to the person who suggested cupcake pans.  What an awesome idea!

Fabulous for my first attempt at stuffed mushrooms. I do that some fresh bread crumbs wouldnt hurt on top instead of more cheese. Also, Tried with Portebello Caps and it didn't work as well, but worked for dinner at home. Thanks for the great recipe!

I first made these mushrooms a few years ago and since then I have yet to find someone who doesn't like them. In fact, they are constantly requested. I'm now looking for a great wine to accompany them.

I changed up the recipe just a little bit by adding an onion and a bell pepper to the stuffing (I just wanted to get rid of them before they go bad), and I also added a dollop of sour cream that was sitting in the fridge. I used some pretty large mushrooms, so the stuffing turned out to be just enough. I kept everything else exactly as this recipe says and the outcome was delicious!!! I didn't know I could make mushrooms like these at home! I'm going to try out some other alterations to this recipe and see how they go. Even my teenage brother who isn't a big fan of mushrooms (and anything without meat) asked for seconds!

Amazing!!! I made a balsamic glaze consisting of simmering balsamic vinegar and brown sugar until thick and sweet. I dont know the exact amounts but mix brown sugar to taste will suffice. Once you have desired consistency, drizzle it over the top of these bad boys! It takes the whole recipe to another level!! Every time i make the sauce, someone ALWAYS confiscates the extra. Great great great recipe :)

Quite yummy!  We didn't have any cayenne pepper, so we substituted red chili flakes and we also didn't have any Parmesan, so we substituted shredded colby-jack.  They were still very yummy and easy to make!

These are so yummy! Definitely a keeper. I do add a little Worcestershire sauce. When I have them around I also like to add some diced red bell pepper for a little texture and color, but these are great as is too.

This is a great recipe and it doesn't take very long to make.  Be careful with the cayenne pepper as it can be a little overpowering if too much is used.  I have made it over 20 times within the past couple of months and it still is a favorite of everyones!

This recipe is very good but I find that crumbling 1/4c of dry bread into the filling helps to reduce the amount of liquid once cooked and prevents hot liquid from burning your mouth when fresh out of the oven.

mouth-watering indeed ! these were great. i followed reviewers tips, and so i added a slice of hotdog in each ,reduced the amount of thecream cheese used even though my mushrooms were more than 12 . sprinkled the stuffed mushroom with origami and rolled the bottom in butter then dipped it in breadcrumbs. ...writing this is making me crave them again !!

Tried 0412/2011 - We loved them.  I only minced one clove of garlic, so I'm sure I didn't use a full teaspoon (my husband is not a big garlic fan), and while I thought they were great, the full 1/4 t. of cayenne pepper did make them seem pretty hot.  I would use the same amount again for us, but be aware of it if you're family doesn't like too much heat.  We actually had a few left over and I was worried they might not fare very well getting nuked in the microwave for today's lunch, but I thought they were fine (not quite as good as last night, but MUCH better than I was anticipating).

These were delicious!  I added bacon and chili flakes, as well as panko on top for a little bit of crunch.  I had filling left over, so I probably could have made 16 regular-size mushrooms total, had I known.  These make a great appetizer.  Thanks.

So good!  I added bacon, cooking it the skillet first then adding everything else as the recipe states.  I left out the onion powder and diced up about 1/4 white onion instead and cooked that with the bacon, garlic and stems.  I didn't have enough Parmesan cheese, so I put a little mozzarella in (half and half).

Pretty good.  I substituted cottage cheese for the cream cheese to give it more texture and added some panko for a better consistancy.

not my favorite.  I prefer a chunkier stuffing rather than a smooth, creamy one, but that's my personal taste.  Some friends of mine thought they were delicious, though.

This is time-consuming recipe, but my hubbie and 4 year old loved the results!  This makes enough paste for more than 12 mushrooms~probably more like double that as other reviewers have said.  I dipped the shrooms in butter as others had suggested so that it wouldn't dry out and it was delicious!

These were sooo sooo good.  I use this website daily and this is the first recipe i have ever rated!!  I was out of onion powder so i diced 1/4th of an onion and added it. I also added a few tbs of dried bread crumbs.  I had extra stuffing mix and it took everything I had to not eat it out of the bowl.  These will be a regular at my house! Yummy!

Yum! These are so popular at parties and at my work. Just modified slightly based on other reviews. Added bread crumbs before baking for added crunch, also added sausage crumbles to the sauteed mushroom stems as well as chopped scallions. Sooo good.

I hate mushrooms- but LOVE these!  Amazing!  Wonderful!  Everyone RAVED!  My hubby couldn't be more picky - and he continues to beg for these.  I must say though, I really wanted sausage in it so I added about 1/2 pound of the regular breakfast (comes in a tube thingy) sausage. :)  I think it added to the spice of it.  I know we should try the regular recipe first... I'm a rebel.  Oh... and one time I sprinkled a little parm on top... probably not worth the extra effort to be honest.  I cooked them until the tips on top were looking brown and a hint of crunch- yummm!

~TIP~  I recommend cooking on an air fryer / cooling rack.  I used my cooling rack over a cookie sheet allowing the grease to drain away nicely the first time I did these and they were truly perfect.  The next time I was feeling lazy and just put them on a cookie sheet... they were much more soggy and greasy in a bad way (remember I used sausage too though).  I highly recommend the cooling rack & cookie sheet method.

Thanks for an excellent recipe!

These were pretty amazing - and easy! I didn't measure, and they were very forgiving. I had a bag full of mushrooms - didn't count. 1 mushroom broke, so I threw it in with the stems. I didn't have a full box of cream cheese, so I used what I had and still had more than I needed (but it didn't go to waste :D) Also found out after I started that I didn't have any garlic except powder! Used it anyways... We used the suggestion of putting it in ziploc bag and cutting off an end so as to make a pastry bag. Covered them with grated parmesan and broiled them when they were done. Delicious - I'll be making them again

These were good. I ran the mushroom stems through the mini-chopper first, then combined the whole filling using the mini-chop. Easy to prepare and baked up well.

Just made these... they tasted really really good.. a little spicy but good! I used only 12 stems and followed the whole recipe exactly as said except I filled more white mushrooms than 12... I didn't count them but I know I had more than 24 and I still had 1/2 the filling left over... The filling is delicious but next time, I will not use the entire 1/4 teaspoon as they were quite hot. Also, I used 2 garlic cloves...

These turned out great. The recipe doubled just perfectly. The cayenne pepper was a great addition. It gives them just a little kick at the end without making them overly spicy.

These were amazing! I followed the recipe exactly! I had tons of leftover filling so I stuffed fresh jalepenos and it was just as amazing! Just some tips, definitely slice a layer off the cap so the mushrooms don't roll, I also did that with the japs, and I melted butter and rolled the caps in there to keep it moist. I am a huge fan of putting the filling in a baggie and snipping off the end to pipe it in, way less mess and looks better over all. The recipe is perfect tho! Maybe ill add some chopped japs next time, or sautee onions, Idk, its already great as is.

Excellent recipe!  I did a few tweaks, but nothing major:  I added crumbled bacon to the cheese mixture and used green onion instead of onion powder.  I pulsed the green onion in a food processor a few times and added to the mix.  I also added white crab and tiny shrimp, and this gave the flavor more depth.  I also sprinkled the tops with bread crumbs before baking, and I dipped the mushrooms in melted butter so they wouldn't dry out.  I also baked these in a muffin tin, which worked perfectly.  I think next time I'll add less cream cheese since the filling was very thick.  Regardless, it was still great and my hubby loved them!!

These were just ok for me.  I think it had too much cheese.  If I had more mushrooms maybe that would have made a difference.  Maybe I just prefer the breading in stuffed mushrooms. I probably won't make these again.

I made these New Year's Eve and they were a HUGE hit. It was hard to serve them and not eat them for myself. I had a ton of stuffing left over though. This recipe is a definate keeper. Maybe next time I'll drizzle with a little white wine before baking.

I used 1/4 of the stuffing mix to stuff 5 large mushroom and still threw some of it away.  So feel free to plan more than 12 mushroom - maybe twice that.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I subbed a few drops Tabasco sauce.  My palate is boring so I thought the pepper sauce was overwhelming.  Next time will try with green tabasco.  After drying the mushrooms well, I spayed the bottoms of the mushrooms with Pam.  I topped the mushrooms with a mix made 50/50 of bread crumbs and parm cheese.  I also spritzed the tops with Pam.  Baked for 10 min and broiled for 5.  Watch to ensure the tops don't get too dark.  ty for sharing your recipes.

This is a great, simple recipe that can be embellished in so many ways. I added some green onions, bread crumbs, butter and seasoning to the cream cheese mixture, and I only needed 4 oz and it filled well over a dozen mushrooms. These will be gone soon!

These were easy to make and delicious! I added a some pepper bacon crumbles before I baked them and it was a nice extra flavor. The amount of filling is definitely more than needed..after using about 20 mushrooms I still had some filling left..so I used the leftover in some omelettes the next morning and it was delicious!

Made these last night.  I skipped the step about sautéing the stems and minced garlic.  Also didn't have minced only chopped and I didn't feel like mincing so I used as is.  I mixed all the ingredients together and they still came out very good. The hint of cayenne was such a nice kick of flavor. Not to much but u could definitely taste it.  Keeper recipe.

After reading the Ingredients I realized too much cheese so rather than cut back I bought more mushrooms.  Followed reciped to the T except topped after cooking with a shrimp and small sprig of Dill Weed.  Delicious - will make these many times as an appy

Enough filling for two cartons of mushrooms.    Sprinkled with seasoned salt before broiling for 10min on low at home...finished/reheated in the oven at the party we took them too.    They were gone in less than 5 min!!

I loved these!! I added some pinot grigio (2 buck Chuck--I spared no expense...) in place of 1/4 of the chicken broth and seasoned with Himalayan sea salt (also Trader Joe's) and black pepper and they were truly outstanding! We had them planned as a New Year's Eve appetizer and loved them so much they became the main course with some warm italian bread.

a wonderful appetizer! i wish i had bigger mushrooms though.... and as a after thought, i wish i would have cooked them in a cupcake tin to help keep them upright. they were a hit at my dinner party. in the future i will put in less cayenne pepper and make about 3-4 per person. thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a NY Eve party & they were a hit.  I was able to stuff 36 mushrooms with this recipe.  The only modification I made was to sprinkle italian bread crumbs & melted butter  over top.   Yummy

I made these for a NEW YEARS party. They were gone instantly. Very high raves! I took care to let the mushroom caps dry before stuffing. Too like other members mentioned I added about a 1/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs. (I used croutons). Too I did add some crab-meat. I am sure that these rock just as written. My one complaint is I only got the one mushroom that I tested. Put a few aside for yourself. Lastly there was a lot of stuffing left over... gotta figure out what to do with it!  These are absolutely a "must keep" recipe....yummy!

Like others said, I needed a lot more mushrooms  for the filling (about 1 lb or two packages).  Also, this is excellent with bacon and crab inside.  I also added extra Parmesan cheese on top to make a crust.

I miss breadcrumbs in my stuffed mushrooms, but this recipe was a good alternative for the "low-carb" community.  My husband wolfed them dow, as I did - it's a keeper.  Thanks for posting.

Oh my goodness, amazing!!  Just made these for a holiday party, and everyone loved them.  I tripled the recipe and ended up with TONS of filling left over after filling 40 mushrooms, but the filling doubles as a phenomenal cheese dip for veggies and crackers.  Definitely a winner!

These mushrooms are yummy but I find that 12 mushrooms aren't enough for the stuffing that the recipe yields - I had a lot of cream cheese stuffing left over that I used in mashed potatoes instead. Made the mashed potatoes even better! If a no go for the mashed potatoes, simply get another package of mushrooms to stuff. My sister and hubby sure liked 'em.

I made tested these pre-thanksgiving and mde the recipe exactly as listed, they were good but a little dense. I made them again as an appetizer for thanksgiving swapped the cream cheese for sour cream and upped the shredded cheese a little. I also added some fresh basil and parsley into the mix and they were divine! Thanks

Mmm. When I first tasted the meat mixture after cooking it on the stovetop, I mostly tasted cream cheese and was worried. After cooking in the oven tho, it was very creamy and delicious. To be honest, I didn't measure the ingredients, I just eye-balled it, putting alot more of the ingredients I love so I'm not rating by the exact recipe, I'm rating by ingredients and taste I love all the ingredients in this recipe!

I've made this a number of times and rarely have leftovers.  Over time I've tried a number of modifications. I've found that we like it best when I use portabella mushrooms and mix a half pound of crab meat to the filling.  Thanks for sharing!

i would give these 4 stars because the cayenne was a little too much for me. I gave it 5 because I was the only one who seemed to think so :) Very easy to make but impressive to serve to guests. you can get way more than 12 out of the filling. i also sprinkled bread crumbs on top before baking. Will probably make again for parties, but i'll keep searching for a better recipe for me. thanks!

Yummy! I've made this 3x as my favorite easy appetizer this summer/fall, each time my guests wanted the recipe. It does make a ton of extra filling, so be prepared. I have made a couple changes to the orginal recipe: I use whipped cream cheese with chives, and small bit of Italian sausage in the filling mix. I top the filled mushrooms with panko crumbs for an extra texture.

I've never actually made this with cream cheese, and still I think they deserve 5 stars!  I usually mix in some Italian bread crumbs to the mixture, and top with a little extra cheese (feta or parmesan).

These were great!  Made them for a party and everyone enjoyed them.  Very easy to make, but you want to make them just before serving because they are not so good once they have cooled down.

I made these for a party last night and they were so well received, they disappeared in a flash! I followed the recipe exactly except I opted to leave out the cayenne pepper and I sprinkled some italian bread crumbs on top. It was still wonderful. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and put the cream cheese in a baggie (freezer size if you're doubling) and worked the filling ingredients in the bag, snipped the corner and used it as a pastry bag to fill the mushrooms. Worked like a charm! You may want to double this recipe because they go fast! Thank you, Angie!

these little guys are so good. i opted to add more mushroom stems in the mix (and just saved those extra mushrooms for omelets or stir-frys) because i love that flavor. also chose to add shredded parmesan on top and i liked that as well. just to warn you- these little guys are rich so 2-3 per person is more than enough. i got rave reviews after making these and even from people who don't like mushrooms

Tasted great! I had too much filling for the mushrooms, so make sure you get extra mushrooms to use it all up! Also, be careful when putting them in and taking them out of the oven because they fall over sideways easily!

Oh my-I can't believe I've never rated these before-I've been making them for years and they're always a hit. Sometimes I follow the recipe-sometimes I toss in a little crab or chopped shrimp, add a salad and call it a meal. Even my daughter who firmly believes she hates mushrooms will eat these yummies.

GREAT! Super-easy, too. I didn't have cream cheese, so I used farmer's cheese (less fat, too). I also sprinkled bread crumbs on top and broiled for the last 5 mins. Thanks Angie!

This recipe is very good as is...but for a change I tried adding 2 slices of bacon.  I cooked them until crispy in the frying pan, removed the bacon and then cooked the stems and garlic in bacon grease.  I then mixed the bacon slices with 2 tablespoons of sun-dried tomatoes, and chopped them pretty finely in my food processor, plus added 1/4 cup of bread crumbs...very delicious!:)

These are fantastic. The cayenne pepper adds the perfect punch.   I found this recipe to yield much more stuffing mixture than required for 12 mushrooms, or even 2x 8 oz. packages of medium sized baby portobello. I would plan on having 3x packages of 1.5-2.0" diameter mushrooms.   I also found that mixing everything together was much easier with rather warm, almost melted cream cheese. Then, refrigerate the mixture until firm.

Made them exactly as directed and they were delicious! Made the vegetarian people at my recent party VERY happy because a lot of stuffed mushrooms call for sausage and these didn't.  I used baby bella (baby portabello) mushrooms and sliced off an ever so slight amount off the bottom of each cup, so they didn't roll while stuffing and cooking. So these were a complete hit! Thanks so much!

These were OUTSTANDINGLY AMAZING!!! So easy to make and yummy!! I made more caps than the recipe called for, I still had extra filling for at least half dozen. I made about 18 or 20.  Awesome flavor! I did add a very lil bit of breadcrumbs...in my opinion, it was great too. We all loved them! I will be making these ALOT! Thanks for posting!!

These were good, but they didn't really satisfy my stuffed mushroom craving. I think I just needed some difference in texture. There's a lot of creamy and soft components, and I needed something with some crunch and some heaviness to it. Perhaps adding some kind of meat the next time around (I'm thinking some Italian Sausage) or butter/bread crumb mixture on top might help. Not bad, but not great. I'll have to try it again with adjustments to suit my own taste.

After all the rave reviews, I decided to give the recipe a go.  I'm a little disappointed.  Used 25 medium sized mushrooms (used all stems in filling).  I sautéed diced onion in with the garlic and mushroom stems and only added a dash of onion powder.  The filling tastes heavy on the cream cheese, enough to where in some bites it's all you taste.  I'll make this again but cut the cream cheese in half.

Delicious. I also added chopped spinach to the cream cheese mix, and sprinkled the filled mushrooms with bread crumbs mixed w/parm cheese. I served them on top on a little bit of warmed alfredo sauce. YUM!

This recipe was great! Made a big dinner for my man and this was by far his favorite part. I took the advice of some other reviewers and added green onion. I also took a tip from another person and used mini muffin tins, but I felt that this made the caps too soggy. I had some leftover filling and toasted it on bread which was also delicious. Definitely a recipe I will use again!

Thank you SO MUCH FOR THE AWESOME RECIPE!! So I JUST made these for an Easter Dinner I attended. Everyone thought I was a Gourmet Chef! lol I modified it a little I used a bag of "5 Italian Cheeses" which had Asagio, Mozzarella and a few more in addition to the Parmesean, then I added some canned crab meat, then I melted some butter and dipped the mushroom bottoms in it before I stuffed them. Topped em off with a lil parm and some crushed garlic croutons...So good made ya wanna smack ya mama! :)

Made these the other night for a potluck dinner and they were a BIG hit!  I would have given this a 5 star rating, but I thought it needed a little "crunch" on top - so I toasted panko, with butter, mixed with a little more Parmesan and topped the mushrooms before baking.   A very good recipe and I'll definitely be making these again!!!

These were so good!  My husband and I loved them.  I used fresh garlic and cut back a little on the cayenne.  I also put in 1 Tbsp of fresh onion, instead of the onion powder, and a tiny bit of salt.  They were great, and not very difficult!

Seriously! These were absolutely amazing!! I added just a little bit of extra garlic. I might even make them again tonight!!

UPDATE: i made them again. This time I added 1 diced green onion, 1/8 cup breadcrumbs, and a tiny bit of asiago cheese. I also learned my lesson about too much garlic so I cut that down. AMAZING!!!! I didn't think they could get any better and they did! The only other thing I will change next time is I am going to cut back a little on the cayenne. It was stinging my lips a bit. Otherwise, PERFECTION!

I discovered this recipe a year ago and have taken it to several gatherings.  My mushrooms are always the first apptz to go and there is always a few who ask for the recipe.  Im not a chef and until I found this easy recipe I always bought a prepared dish to bring to a party.  NOW Im asked to bring my signature mushrooms!

I assume these must be good -- I made about 15, had 4 dinner guests, and they were all gone by the time I finished popping the entree in the oven and made it back to the living room.  I did taste a little of the filling that was left over.  It was good.  I will definitely make again.  I used baby bellas and a grater to "chop" about half the stems.  I did a coarser chop on the other half of the stems, to try to combat what some other reviewers said about the mixture being too creamy/cheesy.  I also put in some parsley - if I remember, next time I'll pick up some chives.

I have to admit that I thought this was a bizarre recipe for stuffed mushrooms, but I stand humby corrected!!!!  These are wonderful!!!!!  I made them just as the recipe called and took them to my euchre group for them to try and they ate everyone!!!! I used all of the mix as well because I had 20 mushroom caps to fill!!!  I would like to try other foods in the recipe in the future, but I, as the other reviews have said, would go exactly by the recipe for the first time!!!  Would highly recommend this recipe!!!  

To update my review, I made these for my (very large) family on Easter Sunday and did not change a thing and they were even bettter the second time around!!!  You have to try these to see how great they taste.  I even used low fat cream cheese for the family currently involved in a "biggest loser" competition and they were still just as great!!!

LOVE these!  I use just a tiny pinch of cayenne, but otherwise this recipe is perfect.  A friend of mine referred me to this recipe and I'm so glad she did.  Now if I could only get my husband to eat mushrooms so I could make these more often!

This is an awesome recipe and would reconmend it to anyone. I am 18 and this is my first stuffed mushroom recipe so I did the typical teenage thing and did not read the recipe completely just skimmed. Well I got the wrong cream cheese so it was really hard to mix the ingredients together. So i just heated the cream cheese and it turned out brilliantly. I love this recipe! Also I used garlic powder instead of onion powder and it really worked well! If you are considering this recipe dont....... just do......dont think you will not regret it!

These were so wonderful!! Just as great if not better than anything I'd get in a restaurant. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and the taste was still exquisite. Next time I will either make a lot more mushrooms and use less of the cream cheese mixture in each or scale back the cream cheese because it had a very strong cream cheese flavor. These are super delicious, but rich! I served them as a side dish with shrimp scampi, and I would not do that again! Definately should be served 30 minutes or so before a meal as an appetizer! I added about 1/2 cup of chopped crab, which was fabulous! Also took other reviewers' advice and dipped them mushroom caps in a butter and Italian breadcrumb mixture before baking. Sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese just before going into the oven. Baked in mini muffin cups, which was perfect. The cayenne adds a wonderful "zip"! Definately will be making these again!

I thought these were very good.  I used the whole pack of cream cheese and added some crumbled real bacon bits and a bit of chopped onion.  I had a little filling left over and I made about 20 mushrooms.  I did chop about 10 stems in my mixture as well.  I also topped with a sprinkling of bread crumbs.  Just a few tweaks . . . but a great recipe that I will make again.

These are very good stuffed mushrooms! Maybe my mushrooms were a bit small, but I stuffed about 16 of them and still had extra filling. I also used only 6 tbs. of Neufchatel cheese instead of 8 oz. of cream cheese...so either my mushrooms were small or I wasn't putting in as much of the stuffing. Either way, these came out absolutely delicious! Those in my house who will actually eat stuffed mushrooms really enjoyed them...I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing this recipe...it is a winner!!!!

Excellent recipe. Like other reviewers said, I halved the cream cheese and added 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs to the mixture. I drizzled them with butter, topped with shredded mozzarella cheese, and baked them in individual ramekins. Yummy! I had an extra serving, so I covered the ramekin and refrigerated for 2 days before drizzling with butter and baking. Were still just as yummy! Love the extra spice that the cayenne adds. Definitely a keeper recipe! Thanks!

I made these for a party last night and everyone was raving about them.  I used crimini mushrooms instead of white mushrooms and they were perfect.  I also diced up some bacon and cooked it crisp and mixed it into the filling mixture.  Delicious!

I enjoyed these and thought that they were very good, but I thought they could have been better for a couple of reasons.  First, I took the advice to butter the outside of the mushrooms, and while this made them cook nicely, it didn't enhance the flavor of the mushroom much.  Next time, I will add some garlic and salt (or just garlic salt) to the butter to give the mushroom a little flavor.  Also, I didn't add crabmeat, but I think that it would have been much better if I had.  I will do this next time.  Overall, very good!!  I will fix these again!

Really really good, and pretty easy to make.  I did not add the cayenne (have kids who think pasta sauce is too spicy!), but added black pepper.  Will used portabello mushrooms next time.  Very good.

This recipe was a hit with my family! Needless to say there was none left over and everyone kept begging for more. I did make a few changes in that I used 20+ bite-size white mushrooms to make the individual servings easier to eat. Also, I lessened the amount of cayenne pepper and the cream cheese. Otherwise, this is one of my favorite recipes of all time.

This was simply delicious. I added 2 tbsp of chopped (frozen and drained) spinach and some chopped parsley to the cheese mixture. Before I baked the mushrooms, I dipped the mushrooms (cheese part) in some Italian breadcrumbs.  I baked the mushrooms at 375 as my mushrooms were huge. I ended up with 10 huge yummy stuffed mushrooms.

EXCELLENT! Always the first dish to go at parties. I've made this at least 4 times. I use 1/3 less fat neufchatel and it came out plenty creamy. I tried drying out my mushroom caps over night but saw no reduction in the amount of liquid after baking. Smaller mushrooms are definitely the way to go for the right mushroom to cream cheese flavor balance.

Pretty good recipe. I think it is too creamy. I think bread crumbs may be essential to this recipe. I will keep searching for a better recipe.

These were awesome!! I added a few slices of bacon and green onion for more flavor. Eliminated the cayenne pepper because I preferred not to use it.  Will make these again and again!!!  Loved the tip of slicing a little piece off the top so they don't roll around and put melted butter on mushroom so they don't dry out.

So delicious, I added green onion and some canned crab to mine then sprinkled bread crumbs on top.  They were excellent and I will definitely make them again.

Simply delicious and creamy. Only change was to add a bit of parsley to the filling. I put the filling in a sandwich baggy and cut a corner off to pipe it into the caps.  My husband absolutely loved them. Update: Made these again for a NYE party and people went NUTS over them. They disappeared as soon as I plated them. Thanks!

Excellent! One small problem with portions however (probably due to size of mushrooms). I had so much filling that my mushrooms were bulging & I didn't want to waste any of the cream cheese filling. What do I recommend?  A. Use BIGGGGGG mushrooms.  OR  B. Use about 18 semi-large mushrooms.

I served this a party and was told they were "to die for"!  Before filling I dipped each mushroom in melted butter. Then after filling topped them with a mixture of breadcrumbs and melted butter.   Very Very good!

OMG! YUMM. I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit! The only thing I changed was after i sauteed garlic and stems, I cooked them in white wine. I will make these again for sure!

Made these last night as an appetizer and they were gone in a flash! I accidentally added a bit more cayenne so they were quite spicy but delicious. I used tiny mushrooms which were a huge pain but looked nicer on the plate. Because they were so small they barely needed 15 minutes in the oven. I followed the recipe exactly but next time would add green onion just for colour. Will make often, thanks a lot!

Very good mushroom caps and a big hit at the party I made them for.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and the only thing I would do differently next time would be to use smaller mushrooms - the filling kind of overwhelms the mushroom in the large caps.  Thankyou!

These were great, and a lot easier than some other stuffed mushroom recipes I've tried in the past! I skipped the cayenne and went easy on the black pepper since my son doesn't tolerate it, and they were still great. I doubled the recipe and did 24 moderate sized mushrooms (one of the really big containers) and have a ton of leftover stuffing that we'll either make another batch or use it on bagels. Also subbed Neufatchel cheese for cream cheese since it's softer but with the same taste. VERY rich!

These are really good as is, However I brown some italian sausage then add in the stems and garlic before mixing with the cream cheese and parm cheese.  It gives it that kick it needs and keeps the filling from being too creamy.  I never have any left

OK, I didn't make these - my friend did, and they were INHALED at a get together at my house! RIDICULOUSLY delicious - so glad she brought them (thanks, T!) Definitely looking foward to making this myself! (*UPDATE - I DID make these myself on T'giving - hubby was MAD when he saw how "creamy" they were - "That's not how stuffed mushrooms are made in the north!" I tried to convince him to try something new...When I had them out to cool, I noticed a huge gap in the pan - when asked about it, he gave me a dirty look - "I ate about 6 of them, d@mit..." (needless to say, he LOVED them! : )

These make a fantastic base recipe for stuffed mushrooms. You can add a little chopped meat- some crab or shrimp or even spicy sausage. I would say it does need something extra, though. My 'extra' was chopped green onions- perfect! I seperated the parmesan and put it on top of the filled mushrooms instead of mixing it in and it browned beautifully but needed a couple minutes longer. 5*

I took these to a party and they totally disappeared in seconds. I was happy I bought the best appetizer there. I had people looking me up on the spot for the recipe. I added cut up sun dried tomatoes for color and extra parms on top last few minutes for looks. I have a text message on my phone waiting asking for the recipe. I'm making more next time.By the way this party was a crab feed..so I couldn't make crab stuffed mushroom my fav

Yummy! Although next time I will add crab meat and cut the cayenne in half, other than that, delicious!

These were astonishingly delicious.  I loved them.  They were just a bit too heavy/rich, but only the ones where I used the big mushrooms.  Next time, I'll use all smaller mushrooms for a good balance.

I made this appetizer for football Saturday and my wife and son both raved about it. Both are brutally honest about my cooking, so I know they truly enjoyed it. We've had stuffed mushrooms with cream cheese and bacon bits, which is exceptional. These are top shelf too. I doubled the recipe and ended up with way more filling than I had mushrooms for. Consider buying three small containers (instead of two, like I did) of mushrooms, because you may have enough filling to use that many mushrooms.

This was pretty good, although I made several changes. I added bacon and some frozen spinach to the mixture and only half of the mushroom stems.  I put some feta with sun-dried tomato on top and it was fantastic.

This recipe was Ok, I served it and my guests thought it tasted good but it seemed incredibly bland to me ... It is a good base recipe to fiddle with later but I was disappointed at how much of the cream cheese I tasted

Put pieces of cooked bacon in the mushroom and also added some leftover sauted mushrooms and a tad of chicken.  Everyone luvvved them.  Very rich though.  I had large mushrooms but will use smaller ones in the future for bite size.

Made about 50 of these (small to med mushrooms) for 12 people for a side dishe at dinner. All were eaten. I think I was a little to heavy handed with the cayanne pepper, but otherwise would make again nice change from the usual stuffing.

I give it 5 stars because I doubled the recipe and every single stuffed mushroom was devoured at a cocktail party.  I personally thought they were a bit bland, even after adding minced chives, but everyone loved them.  Great for an appetizer.  Next time I think I'll add some bacon bits and top with cheddar cheese to see if it adds some pop.  Agreed with other reviewers, had plenty of left over "stuffing" so will have to find something interesting to do with the extras...maybe a dip with crackers?

Very tasty. I was a bit sceptical at first about the cream cheese as I'm not a big fan, but it was very nice. I used large mushrooms, but will try again using the smaller button ones for a bite size portion. I also added some garlic chives and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top. Thanks!

VERY good!  I made as written, but I did use very expensive, fresh grated parmesan from a local cheese shop and I'm pretty sure it made a difference.  We LOVED the "kick" from the cayenne pepper.  I will definitely make these again!

I am regularly asked to bring these to parties and dinners.  Gone in seconds! The amount of filling can easily fill 2-3 times the amount of mushroom caps, or I have served extra filling as a hot dip with crackers or veggies.  Love this one!

WOW!!! These were unbelievably good. I did make a couple of changes. First I added finely chopped shallots to the mushroom and garlic mixture and cooked them up together. The second thing was instead of using all cream cheese I used half cream cheese and half goat cheese. They came out incredible. My boyfriend could not stop praising them! I will most definitely make them again!!!   Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!

The mushroom and garlic mixture smelled AMAZING while it was cooking, and I decided to add a package of drained frozen spinach to it. I added a dash of plain breadcrumbs to the top and a dash of paprika for aesthetic purposes. I made about 30 mushrooms caps and they looked gorgeous. Everyone loved them an ate them all! I like them alright, but prefer more of a buttery breadcrumb stuffing myself. These were great to try though.

Having read the reviews about the overage of filling, I made 15 mushrooms and halved the filling recipe and I had just the right amount. I subbed neufatschel cheese for the cream cheese (a bit less fat) but otherwise prepared as written. I only cooked for 15 minutes and they mushrooms were perfect. I will definitely make these again. Thank you!

I thought these were good, but not outstanding. I didn't think they had enough flavor. Although the parmesan/cream cheese mixture was perfectly creamy and wonderful! Update: made them again and added about 1/4 t. salt. So much better! They were really great. The only thing I would do next time is add a little sausage, then they would be perfect!

These mushrooms were a huge hit at my housewarming party.  They were the first to go, and I had some pretty good food there.

This was the best stuffed mushroom recipe I ever tried. It was great!!! I added crab meat to the cream cheese mixture and it turned out awesome. Also I added a bit more cayenne pepper cause I like spice.

Yummy!!  Slightly spicy.  We added some clams to give it a little something extra.  Will probably make this again as it is a very simple appitizer with lots of flavor.

Oh my!! I made this for my parents corporate christmas party.  Everyone kept asking where we got them... they didn't know we catered! I had to write the recipe down at least 20 times.  I added bacon to the cream cheese mixture and brushed the capps with melted butter. My husband requets they be made at every football game!!

These are great! Very flavorful, a bit of a kick, but without the deepfry. I used RF cream cheese as well. 12 mushrooms isn't near enough for all of the filling though. I used an entire 16 oz. container and still had a little leftover.

Don't be afraid to "overstuff" them, I thought it would run, but it really didn't.  I also didn't wait until the topping was browning and I wish I would have.  Still awesome if you like cream cheese & garlic.  I did put them directly on a plate with paper towels to soak up any moisture.  Will definatly make again.  Yummy!

Despite the nearly 1000 positive reviews, I didn't care for this recipe.  I tried it twice...once exactly as the recipe called and another time with crab meat, baby bellas and parmasean as several reviewers noted.  Both times, I thought they were ok... not horrible, but not tasty.

Almost 5 stars and 1,00 reviews -- now I can see why! Made exactly as recipe decribes, but was left with half the filling, so will need to either make less next time, or use more mushrooms. Great appetizer!

These are really delicious.  Added crab, carrots, celery & onion & 1 1/2 Tblsp of butter for flavor  and 1/4 tsp old bay seasoning.  Decided to only use 4 oz. cream cheese.  Will make again.

Awesome, extremely tasty!  To make the stuffing easier and more even, first I whipped the cream cheese with my mixer, to make it creamier, then I added the cooled garlic mixture to it, again with the mixer to smooth it out.  then I put the mixture in a piping bag, and stuffed them that way, so they turned out tasty and pretty!

excellent, I cut way down on the mushroom stems and used a bit of sweet italian sausage at my teenage daughter's request. Loved the suggestions of placing mix in a plastic bag. They turned out perfect and my family devoured them on Christmas. thank you

These are the best stuffed mushrooms that I ever tasted.  I make them all the time for my family.  I do make a few changes.  I add about 4 slices of bacon and I add bread crumbs and a small pat of butter to the top.  After they are finished baking I broil them for about a minute to get a nice color on top.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I thought this recipe was going to taste to "cream cheesy". But i was wrong. This recipe was awesome. My 10yr old even liked it. I had leftover stuffing, so i used it as a dip with crackers. Tastes great that way too. I will add fresh crabmeat next time to give it another flavor. Great job!!!

This is a great recipe and actually much easier than in first appears. I do add a can of crabmeat to the mixture. My husband gobbles these up as fast as I make them. They are even good the next day after you reheat them. Thanks for the recipe!!

These mushrooms are fantastic. My husband raved over them and is begging me to make them again. He said they are better than the ones our favorite restaurant makes. I did not add as much of the cayenne pepper only because I didn't want it to be too spicy for the kids. The kids loved them too.

These are the best! Everytime I make them they become an instant hit. They taste good right out of the oven or right out of the fridge. If time is going to be an issue, you can make the filling ahead of time and just store it in the fridge. Then right before serving all you have to do is scoop it in and pop them in the oven for a bit.  Yum Yum Yum!

Update to my review: Used the mandolin slicer and took one swipe across the cap of the mushroom. This made a flat surface where the mushroom won't tip over.  I also mixed the filling right in a baggie.  Just put all the ingredients straight into the bag and zipped it up and mushed it together until mixed.  Made clean up a breeze!  I put a little extra shredded parm on the top of each one too.  I made a few hours in advance and put on a cookie sheet.  I put a wire cake rack over the top of the cookie sheet which stood just about an inch over the mushrooms.  Wrapped the whole thing with wire rack and all in saran wrap and popped in the fridge so they wouldn't dry out and so the wrapping wouldn't "smush" the mushrooms.  Worked like a dream.  When I was ready to make them, just cut through the saran wrap with scissors and popped them in the oven.  Very easy.  Everyone loves these.  I've made these several times.  They're awesome.

I LOVE this recipe.  Everyone that I have made them for absolutely loves them as well.  I have since had recipe cards made up so that I can distribute them when I am asked. It is a frequent request once I have made them for guests.  That speaks for itself!!

These were awesome--really good for someone who is not huge on spiciness, like me.  The cayenne definitely gives it a little something special.  I used two cloves of garlic, which was probably a little more than called for, but I love garlic.  I'll probably experiment with bacon or crab meat another time.  Wonderful as-is, though.

I substitute two small packages of baby bella mushrooms.  Also, they come out less watery if you make them the night before and refrigerate.

This is a huge hit every time I make it. I suggest only making the filling one day ahead of time and refrigerating it - washing the mushrooms ahead of time will only make them soggy.

"Amazing" and "Outstanding" were my husband's comments. Yay!

I used baby portabellas and they turned out very nicely. I am going to try the white big ones next time with some crabmeat. The cayenne was the PERFECT thing to these. Couldn't do it without that kick.

Too much cream cheese and not enough substance for me. They taste good though, just not what I want from a stuffed mushroom in terms of texture.

Received excellent reviews from my friends. They loved it! But you need to brush with butter. Keep an eye on the mushroom. Take care not to overcook the mushroom and eat it immediately. Delicious!

These are awesome!  My husband and I love mushrooms, and these are always a hit!  I usually crumble a slice of bacon and add it to the filling or put it on top.  More than one slice overpowers the great flavor of the filling though.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I made this for an appetizer for my Valentine's dinner last night. It turned out better than I imagined.  I used an 8oz package of baby portabellas, halved the cream cheese (would have been alot left over), added a drained 6oz can of crab meat and kept all the seasonings as is. I could have made a meal out of these! So good!

Oh man, I took these to TWO separate parties and they were a hit BOTH times!  I did as others suggested and put the stuffing into a ziploc bag with the corner cut off and it worked just fine.  I also basted the outside of the mushrooms with melted butter so they wouldn't dry out.

These were great!  I made them for a birthday party and I only got to have one before they were all gone.  I like that it is different from your standard stuffed mushroom w/ the bread crumbs.  I took others advise and used a freezer bag to pipe the filling...it made it quick and easy with little mess.  Everyone asked for the recipe...will definately make this again...and again :)

These were great!  Thanks to the reviewer who offered the suggestion of using the pastry bag to fill the mushrooms.  Did that and it literally took less than a minute to fill them.  Watch the cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp doesn't seem like a lot but it sneaks up on you.

I was worried that this recipe sounded too 'cremy", but I decided to trust the high rating, and made some for a party. I used the sliced mozzarella as suggested by another reviewer.  These disappeared! Everyone raved about them...I definitely wished I'd made another batch.  I will definitely beserving these again.

These were good, but not the best stuffed mushrooms I've had or made. I used about 3/4 of the cream cheese.  I also used small mushrooms.  The filling made enought to fill 2 10oz containers of mushrooms, which was the perfect amount for a 4 person dinner party.  I traveled with them to a the party and had to reheat in the oven once we arrived b/c they didn't retain heat, even with my pyrex heatable packs.

The best mushrooms!  The mixture makes enough to stuff plenty of mushrooms.  

I chopped up some whole mushrooms - sauted them in a little olive oil with garlic, worshire and cayenne and threw them into the filling.   I also put in a few extra splashes of worshire sauce and upped the cayenne pepper a little for the filling.

I have a tendancy to tweak recipes just for fun.  With this all I added was 1/4 cup chopped scallops, 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs.  I used about double the mushrooms and had just enough filling...these little beauties flew off the plate.   I know they would be just as wonderful without my additions.  Thanks for a hit!!!

These were great the flavour was so good, the only change I made was I used fresh onions also sauted, I prepared these a day ahead, covered in the fridge ready to just go in the oven, I also brushed them lightly with melted butter to stop them drying out as another reviewer mentioned, I had a fair bit of juice on the oven tray as they were cooking so I just carefully tipped it out and popped them back in the oven, I will be making these again I had rave reviews.

I chose this recipe because it didn't contain the ubiquitous bread crumbs.  I was delighted to find that it made by far the best stuffed mushrooms I've ever had, at home or in a restaurant! I substituted minced fresh onion for the onion powder and sauteed it, with the mushroom stems and garlic, in butter.  When it cooled, I dumped it into a gallon ziploc bag with the other ingredients, kneaded them together, cut one corner off  the bag and piped it into the mushroom caps.  Popped it in the oven and presto - I am a kitchen goddess! They were so good, I felt like I needed to pretend the recipe was more difficult; my family is going to expect triumphs like this every night.

These were really good although I only gave them 4 stars cause they were just a little too "cream cheesey" for my taste and I normally really like cream cheese.  Maybe just not exactly what I was looking for.

I hate to give a poor review; I know this must be a good recipe, and I know I am a good cook, but it didn't turn out well at all.  I baked them just a little over the cooking time so the tops would brown a bit and the mushrooms cooked way down and released so much liquid that it was almost like they were sitting in soup.  I also found that they did not transport well at all and as they lost heat on the buffet table, they became less and less appetizing. Kudos to everyone who enjoyed this one -- it just did not turn out well for me at all.

My Christmas pot roast took much longer to cook than expected, so made a quick batch of these mushrooms. They were a hit! I used regular size mushrooms and used only 4oz of lowfat cream cheese instead of 8oz, but used the full amount of everything else, plus added 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs. Easy and delicious!

These were awesome!! I served them for Christmas Eve and they vanished!  I do recommend cooking them slightly longer and perhaps broiling for a minute or two b/4 taking out.  Lots of leftover cheese mix so more mushrooms or 1/2 the cheese mixture.

Gorgeous.  Made these for our Christmas dinner, they were a huge hit.  My picky eater husband absolutely loved them.  Will definitely be making them again and may try them with crabmeat.  I used a plastic sandwich bag and piped the filling in and topped them with a little extra parmesan and a little sprinkle of cayenne.  Had more than enough filling for 12 mushrooms so I used the left-over filling as a dip for celery and crackers.
Very quick and easy.. definitely one for the recipe box.

I followed the recipe exactly (I don't usually do that). It was superb! Easy, too. Restaurant quality and very gourmet. I've saved this to my recipe box and will make again at least once a month. [Don't want anyone to get tired of it]

these mushrooms are awesome, i doubled the  mushroom amount thinking i would need to double the filling, not so. i had tons of leftovers, and i am going to half the cayanne pepper next time, a bit spicy. but in all that the mushrooms were awesome and definately worth all the work

I make these every year for our family Christmas dinner.  The filling is amazing and everyone in the family, young to old, love them.  Filling makes way more than enough.... freeze and use for a quick mushroom fix another day.

I love mushrooms in the first place, so I could not wait to attempt this recipe. I made a couple of changes because first I did not have a whole thing of cream cheese, so I just used a half of the cream cheese. I also use olive oil insteed of veg. oil and I added some shredded cheese. These were the best stuffed mushrooms I have had in a long time.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added a small can of minced clams and dipped the mushroom top in breadcrumbs.  I also froze mine one day before, then pulled them out and cooked them.  I was not happy with the results as I found them very watery; next time I will not freeze them and see how they turn out.  I think you could safely cut back on the cream cheese to a 6oz--my guests did not complain-they all disappeared.  I used medium size mushrooms and used 2 packages-plenty of filling plus leftover...thanks for the great recipe!

pretty good, I would suggest adding some kind of filling, it's very cream cheesy. i would give it 3.5 - 4 star. TIP: hold mushrooms by your fingers and push stems away, makes for a clean break.

Awesome.  I made these when we had some friends over and they gobbled them up.  These are very good just not for you.  I used low fat cream cheese to lower the fat content a bit.

Absolutely wonderful, big hit at the party I took them to! Tips: forget trying to fill these with a spoon! Use a zip lock bag with a corner cut off, just pipe the filling in. Filling freezes well for use later, too! Just thaw when ready to use.

I have a big Southern family full of wonderful cooks, so when I tried this recipe, I took it to one of our parties and what a hit!  Each time I have to bring more b/c they go so quickly.  I also found that using the smaller mushrooms are best to balance flavors.  This is a fabulous recipe!!

Fabulous! I've made these 3 ways:  plain, with bacon, and with sausage.  The sausage were my favorite, closely followed by the bacon.  Best thing?  You can make these ahead of time, store in the fridge, and just microwave them when you're ready. I'll be making these a lot!

wow!  these were every bit as good as advertised!  I had 6 large stuffing mushrooms to work with, and this recipe came out very well with them.  I added a small finely chopped onion to the mushroom stem bits in the frying pan to give more flavor and substance, and also topped the stuffed mushrooms with parmesan cheese.  I ended up broiling them for an extra few minutes at the end to brown the cheese.  fabulous!

I made these for a family get together, and they disapeared in only 5 minutes!  My whole family raved about them!  I made them again just for my family, and my husband couldnt get enough of them.  My 6 and 7 year old even liked them!  This is a definate make again!

I've been using this recipe for quite some time.  These are a crowd pleaser, but I can't help but think that something crunchy needs to be added.  Maybe bacon, although that would change the flavor a bit.  The mushrooms have a one-note flavor and it just makes you want something more.  However, I will say they are very good.  I have tasted these before with raw garlic (not my doing).  Don't do this!  It ruins the taste!

These mushrooms are great and easy to make!  You can really add anything to this recipe and they will still turn out great.  I added a can of crabmeat and a few italian crackers.  The ziplock bag trick and dipping the mushrooms in butter works wonders!  My guests enjoyed the kick of the cayenne pepper, but if you don't like spicy food (like me), try reducing the amount of pepper or simply remove it.  Regardless, this recipe is a sure thing and you can't mess it up!  You gotta love that!

These were good. Great for potluck because you can prepare both mushroom caps and filling ahead of time, bring them separately and assemple and bake them before serving. I didn't think the taste was as spectacular like other reviews said but this surely is a great finger food for a party. I sprinkled extra cayenne pepper when mushrooms came out of the oven.

These mushrooms have become a favorite among all my friends.  I made a double batch at my last party, and they were gone in a snap.  Several people requested the recipe afterward.  I have to agree with the other reviewers who said you don't need a full batch of the stuffing.  I make 50-75% the amount called for, depending on how large the mushrooms are, and it is always more than enough.

these were great at a recent party, although i'd suggest two things-- these aren't the sort of appetizers that do well if you sit them on a plate and let people eat them over a period of time-- when they cool they aren't as good. also, make sure to warn your guests that they can be messy! they are so juicy (which is good!) that a couple of my guests dripped right on their shirts. oops!

I brought these to a few parties already and I always get rave reviews!  I have found that just a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne does the trick!  Great recipe!!!  I almost forgot...I found a cookie sheet with a piece of parchment paper on top helps with clean-up!

I have made this recipe several times, not once have I had and leftovers.  I usually add a little extra of all the ingredents except the cream cheese.  This filling is also great as a cheese ball served with crackers.

I have used this recipe many times.  It has always been a hit.  It has gotten to where I make a copy to take with me when I make it for an event to give away to those that ask.  I have never gone home with the copy, yet (if anything had others take notes off the copy).

I used only half the amount cream cheese and adjusted the remaining ingredients accordingly and this filled 12 mushrooms with some leftover. I wrapped half of them in bacon (half a slice per mushroom).  Cooked them all in the oven for 15 minutes.  Kept the bacon ones in for another 10 minutes on broil.  My husband really loved these, I thought they were okay but I'm not a huge mushroom lover. The filling was really yummy:)Yeah, I'd make these again!

Wonderful. Iwasn't sure what kid of mushrooms to use.  the first time I used large button mushrooms and it was great then I used portabellas and just cut them in quarters.  A real hit at every function I carry them to..

Very unique stuffed mushroom recipe!  I love it.  Great for vegitarians and people with gluten allergies.  I always add a little more cayenne for a little extra kick.

These were great.  I tripled the amount of mushrooms and still used the same amount of filling.  They were gone so quick I had only one!  Thanks!

This was a great recipe, i modified it a bit though, i used a generous amount of asiago cheese instead of parmasean.  I also breaded the outside with a herb bread crumb and asiago breading.  baked it 20 min and broiled for 1 min to crunch the top.  It was perfect.

I made this for a 60th birthday party.  I wanted a recipe that didn't include seafood, and this was perfect.  Everyone loved them and they were the first appetizer that was completely eaten. I doubled the recipe because I thought I would need it, but it was WAY too much.
I would highly recommend!

Delicious recipe.  I added some Panko breadcrumbs to the top of each mushroom.  Really scrumptious appetizer.  My guests loved them.

These were okay.  We prefer a little more breading and/or mean in our stuffed mushrooms.

This was a total hit, but definitely took longer than 20 minutes to prep as I'm a novice cook.  Glad I started making this earlier than I had originally planned!  DELICIOUS!!

Perfect! Fabulous! I couldn't believe something that tasted so good actually came out of *my* oven!
I was unable to find large stuffing mushrooms at my local supermarket, so I stuffed two containers of baby portobellos instead, and they were perfect.

I always bring these to parties now - guaranteed to be a hit!
I find I can usually stuff over 20 mushrooms with this recipe even when they are relatively large. Also, definitely follow the recipe on the amount of cayanne or even go a little easy on it, they have some kick to them (which I love but some people find to be too much)

Let me start by saying it is correctly named - these mushrooms are scrumptious!!  My husband HATES mushrooms and I pleaded with him to try one and he ate FOUR!!  I couldn't believe it - he kept asking me for another - I was so excited - this is a must in your recipe box!!!

These were really really good, my husband hates mushrooms, and he actually ate a few and liked them.  I added some chopped parsley to the cheese mixture and also sprinkled some dry bread crumbs on top of the stuffed mushrooms before baking them.  From the recipe filling I was able to fill almost 30 mushrooms!  They were all eaten up by a few people!

These were delicious.  I doubled the recipe and I had a ton of the stuffing left over, so I stored it in the fridge and made more the next week.  Everyone loved these at my christmas party, the cayenne adds a nice kick to it.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making it.  These were not as good as I expected.  Some guests thought they were better than others.  They did not go quickly as mushrooms typically do.  To me, the filling tasted like cream cheese with a kick.  The cream cheese was the overpowering flavor.  I did have to cook them about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  I might try these again with adjustments.  Too bad but not that great.

Tried these out on my family for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! I tried to prepare as much as possible ahead of time and making the filling the day before worked out great. I'll definitely be making these again for a Christmas gathering in three weeks. Thanks, Angie!

Brought these to Thanksgiving Dinner as an appetizer and everyone loved them.  I don't understand how anyone rating this dish or any other dish can complain about too much salt or too much cayenne pepper.  Cooking isn't brain surgery.  Once you get the main ingredients, seasoning should be to taste.  Anyhow, I sprinkled breadcrumbs on top, drizzled with oil and added a little water to the pan while they cooked.  PERFECT.  Thank you.

I had my family over for dinner. They all liked it and they were surprised that it did not have any meat in it. It is easy to make and you can prepare the filing ahead of time. I add some basil and oregano to add some kick.

AWESOME!!! These mushrooms were the hit of the party. I added extra cayenne (we like it spicy) and everyone LOVED them. I made 5X the amount and they were gone before I could even restock the platter. Fortunately I reserved some filling and a single box of shrooms to eat the day after.  I will make these AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!

I add some diced bacon to mine and use the rendered bacon fat in place of the vegetable oil.

Though tasty, these lacked depth of flavor.  I'll probably add some hot sausage to the mix, and skip the hot pepper next time.

The recipe did leave lots of left-over filling.  I used this on the "cucumber sandwich" recipe found on this site instead of plain cream cheese.  It really added flavor to a great sandwich

Oh my GOSH! OH...MY...GOSH!!!!!  I hate mushrooms, but this is certainly the exception.  They were so good and juicy, and oh so flavorful.  This is what I'd like to call a foodgasm.  It's PERFECT to serve company.  They were so delicious and very elegant.  Everyone was begging for more.  I highly recommend these mouth-watering mushrooms. =)

These are great! They just melt in your mouth, but don't let the hot cheese burn your mouth when they first come out of the oven! They smell and look so good you can't wait to sink your teeth into them. Low-carb, too.

These are so delicious! They are well worth the time. I used butter instead of oil, and more garlic (I love garlic). Wow! That Cayenne adds just the right amount of kick, and the parmesan makes it sinful. Will definitely keep this one on hand for an appetizer, potluck, or a party! Love it.

Don't know why, but these didn't cut it for me or my family.  Perhaps I didn't cook them long enough.  It was my first time making stuffed mushrooms, and after about 15 minutes I checked up on them and water was under the caps, so I took them out. I didn't use as much cayene as called for, which might have been why the cream cheese was overpowering. I had lots of leftover cream cheese mixture too.  But others love it, so thanks for the recipe. -----  10/23/09:  Second Time GREAT!  Last time I didn't use enough cayenne, and this time I used 3/4 of the amount.  I would stick with half.  It was far too spicy (although if cold, 75% of the cayenne is perfect).  These were tasty, easy to make, and had great presentation.  I cut a tiny slice off the rounded part so they sat flat.  Also, as another review kindly advised, put your mushroom stems into a blender to chop them up.  After the skillet stage, put the filling into a zip-lock plastic baggie, cut off an end, and use it to pipe into the mushrooms.  I had them for a dinner party and they were a hit.

Oh my, you must try these. So easy and
my family could not stop eating them.
My son didn't want to try them because he doesn't like mushrooms. He did and
said they were out of this world. I had
enough cream cheese mixture for closer
to 24 mushrooms but all were eaten.
Whether you like mushrooms or not...this
is one of the easiest and best recipes
I've found on this site!!

This is a great recipe! I just made a few changes and it came out amazing. 

I used mini-mushrooms instead of large mushrooms. I cut down on the sour cream by half (which really made a huge difference). I mixed the grated parm cheese with feta cheese and I topped the mushrooms off with crushed croutons.

I only had to cook them for a little over 10 minutes. 

I am not a fan of sour cream nor am I a fan of mushrooms normally, but all the ingredients together really makes it delicious.

Oh these are sooo good!  I made them for a steak cookout, and everyone loved them.  But they do bite back!  They are much spicier than your typical stuffed mushroom.  The cayenne pepper can be a bit strong.  I used large "regular" mushrooms, and minced garlic from a jar. These come out looking beautiful but are so easy to make! Update--I originally gave is 4 stars. But my husband and friends cannot stop talking about it.  Even the guys who hate mushrooms!

I just made these mushrooms tonight and my husband and I really enjoyed them.  I thought there was way too much cream cheese though.  I threw half of the mixture out because I couldn't fit it into the mushrooms.  And, of the remaining mixture, it still seemed like too much - we could barely taste the mushrooms.  Next time I will try using just 3-4 ounces of cream cheese, and cut back on the other seasons accordingly.  Ovderall, this recipe was really good though!!!  The cayenne added a great kick and we love garlic.  TIP: Blend the mixture together with your hand.  It is much easier.  Then, add it to the mushrooms using your fingers and a butter knife.  I found this was the easiest thing to do.

This recipie was wonderful!! I just made it for a dinner party and it was a success. The only thing that I can make a negative comment about was that I doubled the recipie for 24 servings and it is was way too spicy. I would cut down on the cayenne pepper. Besides that the mushrooms were a success. Thanks

Delicious! I found that the cheese filled more than twelve mushrooms. (I probably used 1 1/2 packages) I also did not include the stems at all. I just discarded them because it didn't sound very appetizing to me. I did saute the garlic for a short time. And I mixed it all together without waiting for it to cool or anything. I also made these the day before my party and set them on a cookie sheet then covered them with plastic wrap and kept them in the fridge. I will make these many, many more times. THANKS!

Very good stuffed mushrooms, but I wasn't blown away by them, as I kind of expected to be based upon all the high ratings.  I believe I'll make these again, but will tweak the recipe a bit.  I did add a 6 oz. can of crabmeat to the mixture, topped the stuffed mushrooms w/ italian breadcrumbs, & drizzled w/ melted butter & white wine, too.

Excellent recipe.  I made one change--instead of baking them on a baking sheet, I put them in a glass baking dish with a little butter in the bottom and  1/2 cup of white wine.  The wine gives them an awesome flavor!

Excellent stuffed mushrooms! A nice change from the ordinary. 1 (16 ounce) package regular mushrooms was a good amount for the mixture. Its very easy if you put the mixture in a bag and pipe it into the mushrooms. Don't overfill mushrooms too much because mixture is very rich. I dipped the tops in herbed bread crumbs and sprayed them cooking spray.

This is a really good recipe.  It was a big hit at Christmas dinner.  I found it too heavy on the garlic.  So I'll cut back on it next time.  But the garlic lovers at dinner said it was perfect.

This recipe was pretty easy.  It was good, but only if you love cream chese.  They are best right out of the oven.  I tried brushing butter on the mushrooms before putting them in the oven but it just made the mushroom wilt.  I think you can make this stuff for just about any vegetable or even stuffed jalapenos.

These mushrooms were absolutely wonderful!  I only used half of the cream cheese, and I didn't need any more (maybe my mushrooms were smaller than what the recipe calls for).  I will definitely be making this again!

These mushrooms are sinful and really do taste as good as the restaurants'.  They are  exotic and quite filling if you plan to serve hor d'oeuvres only.  I've made them for many get-togethers.  I've found that in order to retain their upright and fluffy shape, you cannot scrimp on the mushroom stems.   Refridgerating them before cooking also helps.  If you like mushrooms, you will love these.

Loved this recipe!  I too used chives and topped with bread crumbs.  I used bite size mushrooms and had a bunch of the mixture left over.  If you are planning on bite size - 36 mushrooms is a closer estimate.

I like this recipe!  I am going to serve it for my friend's bridal shower.  I didn't exactly follow the recipe.  I didn't add the mushroom stems to the mix, because I wasn't really sure which part to use and which to discard.  I also added Italian breadcrumbs to the top before baking the shrooms.
I'm not a measurer, so one clove of garlic was a little bit much.  Will definitely make this again.  Quick and easy!  Thanks!

Just good, not great.  Took to a party and everyone liked them.  I increased the spice too, added a few shakes of tobasco and topped with seasoned bread crumbs.

This is a really good appetizer recipe.  I used about 16 large button mushrooms. I washed & broke off the stems about 4 hours before my guests arrived.  I tossed the mushrooms in olive oil as another reviewer suggested, but I found that I was out of the lemon juice (needed for acidulation)...but the mushrooms still looked fresh and did not discolor very much after 3 1/2 hours in the fridge.  I too sprinkled the top of each mushroom with seasoned breadcrumbs.  After they were prepared, I covered them and put them in the fridge-- so I only had to stick them in the oven when my guests arrived. I gave them an extra 5 minutes in the oven because they went in straight out of the fridge and they turned out nice and hot with the breadcrumbs slightly browned.  The only thing I might do differently is to not fill them as full as I did (heaping+).  They were a little messy for my guests to pick up and eat...but there weren't any leftover, so I guess they didn't mind too much.  Very good recipe--not too difficult and they look pretty impressive.

I prepared the recipe just as it originally was and I really did not like it much. WAAAY to cream cheese-y. I also used almost all the "stuffing" for 12 mushrooms and it was way too much. I had to scrape some cream cheese off before eating it. Next time I would use breadcrumbs and less cream cheese.

I made these for the first time because my older sister was bothering me to make stuffed mushrooms for her. So I ended up making them for my mother's birthday dinner and I hoped for the best. I wanted the best and I got the best because they were SO GOOD!! I personally hate mushrooms and even I can't keep my hands off of these! One thing I changed though. I crushed up about half a bag of Parmasean cheese Goldfish crackers and put them in there. It just fills them out nicely. Perfect appatizers for a party, or if you just want something easy to show-off with. ^____^ Thank you, Angie!

Tasty. I agree with other reviewers - there was a ton of filling left. I made about 30 mushrooms instead of the 12 the recipe called for. I didn't have onion powder so I used the powdery stuff in onion-soup mix. I also dipped in bread crumbs for a finished look. They were a hit with my guests.

I gave my fiance this recipe to make it. The stiring of cold cream chesse with ingredients was a bit tough and odd. The stuffing was tasty but each mashroom has such thick layer of cream cheese. We needed more mashrooms to spray out. However, this could make a good dish of Hors d'Oeuvres for party.

DELICIOUS!  These are really great.  I agree that they are a bit too much cream-cheesy, but still wonderful.  I love the cayenne pepper bite!  This does make much more than 12 mushrooms, in fact, I'm using the rest of the mix in mushrooms tonight.  I sprinkled shredded parmesan on top before baking.  DIVINE!

I have made these mushrooms at least 5 times.  Now I am asked to make them when I go to parties.  The first time I made this I noticed that there was TOO MUCH stuffing.  Now I buy more mushrooms to stuff so none of the filling goes to waste.

Made this for a Christmas appetizer before dinner and everyone LOVED it.  I added just a little extra pepper because we all love things with a kick and some italian style bread crumbs on top before baking.  They were gone before all my guests arrived!!!!  Definently recommend this one.

Absolutely delicious!  They were a huge hit at my dinner party; everyone loved them!  Creamy and tasty and the cayenne gives them a nice kick.  I brushed the outside of the caps once they were stuffed with some olive oil so they wouldn't dry out and get a boiled taste.  They were perfect!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe! :)

WOW!  Made these for New Years Eve and EVERYONE loved them!  The garlic flavor comes thru really nicely and the cayenne pepper gives it just a little kick, which was great.  I also sprinkled on some bread crumbs to make them feel "finished".  Will definitely make this one again.

These were a big hit at Christmas dinner, but next time I would probably cut back on the cream cheese and maybe sprinkle some bread crumbs on top for a bit of texture.  We'll definately make them again though, they were great!

Very good! And it does make alot. I took the warning and bought extra mushrooms. It filled 2lbs of assorted sized caps. The only thing I changed was that I added Hormel bacon bits (the real stuff) because I was out of parmesan cheese. I used maybe 2-3 tablespoons of the bacon pieces and it was excellent. It might also be an answer to some of the reviewers who felt that this was just to "bland" or "cream cheesy". It gave it an added dimension in both taste and texture. Everyone wanted this recipe! Thanks!

I am a big mushroom lover, especially of the stuffed variety.  I was really disappointed after making these.  All I could taste was the cream cheese and it was really overpowering.  This was an ok recipe that I won't make again.

I made these mushrooms for a big family gathering and EVERYBODY loved them, even people who said they don't normally like mushrooms. I doubled the recipe, though, and used about 40 mushrooms (two 12 oz packages)and about 10 oz of cream cheese. It worked out very well. I also want to add that I piped the stuffing out with a frosting bag and it looked very elegant and was very easy!

Absolutely delicious.  I followed others advice and used only 4 ounces of cream cheese. I also added fresh parsley, more garlic, and bread crumbs and stuffed it into baby portobello mushrooms. I also took someone else's advice and put the mixture into a plastic bag and snipped a corner.  This is a keeper!! Can't wait to play with it. Thanks!!

Kind of spicy for my taste, but my husband LOVED them.  He's on a low carb diet and this was perfect for him.

I used 4 large portobello mushrooms and they were great.  I did not have cayenne pepper but I will definitely add it next time.

These were a total hit on New Year's Eve, that we had to have them again for Superbowl Sunday.  They will definitely be on the appetizer list for all our partys from now on.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Like most,  I add crab and a few breadcrumbs to my recipe,  along with scallions and a few other improvizations. This was a great starter recipe for me,  and whenever we go to dinner parties now I am asked to bring these along.  Thanks!

My husband loved these! I made them last night and he ate half of them and then took the rest to work and his co-workers and him demolished the remaining mushrooms at lunch! I used ramano cheese instead of parmesan, since that's all I had. They still turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe!
I served these mushrooms at my Christmas party last weekend, and they were simple and very tasty.  I took off the stems the morning of the party, washed them and made the filling early, then washed the mushroom caps right before filling and baking them.  It worked great!  Oh, and Romano cheese was a great switch for the Parmesan, too.

This was an awesome recipe!  Quick and easy!  Make sure that you get the LARGEST button mushrooms that you can find.  I also added 1 tablespoon of dry white wine and it gave them a quick tangy flavor.

These stuffed mushrooms are great.  I made them at Thanksgiving and they were gone very shortly after I sat them on the table.  I love spicy foods, so I added some extra cayenne pepper to my mushrooms.  They were a big hit.

A great recipe to use if you want something quick and easy, but want everyone to think you are a sophisticated gourmet.  These mouthwatering mushrooms dissapeared at Christmas time, and have been requested many times since then.

I thought it was too cheesy, I don't want to think about what this would have tasted like if I hadn't added the crab meat and bread crumbs. Overall I thought it could have been much better.

I don't even like stuffed mushrooms, but these were great.  I, too, added 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to the mix, and then sprinkled a bit of bread crumbs on top just before they went in the oven.

Well, this one was a wee bit too creamy for me and DH but it did have good flavor. I think if you added breadcrumbs to it and not fill the mushrooms too generously this would be perfect.

Thanks for posting this recipe! I'll definately have to use it again the next potluck we have to attend!

I made these for Christmas dinner and everyone loved them. I doubled the recipe and added (as some others suggested) 1 can of crab meat and a scant 1/4 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs. I think I would leave both the crab and breadcrumbs out next time. I couldn't taste the crab but others said they could. I also put the mix into a ziplock bag and cut the corner off to pipe into the shrooms. Worked great. I will definitly be making these again.

These mushrooms melt in your mouth!  I always have people asking me for the recipe.  They are very similar to an appetizer offered at a local up-scale steakhouse. To make the method easier, I place the filling in a plasic bag, cut off a corner, then pipe it into the mushroom.

Needed a stuffed-mushroom recipe and this was just perfect!  They were delicious.  I took other's advise and added 1/4 C. seasoned breadcrumbs.  I also added butter to the pan when baking.  I've made these several times in the past month.  Thanks a lot!

Amazing!
My knees buckled when I ate them.
The cream cheese makes it and I've had stuffed mushrooms without cream cheese!
Had a dinner party, these were the first to be cleared from the plates.
The cayanne pepper gives a nice zip - glorious!

I thought this recipe was VERY easy to put together.  I did make some changes though..I added a little less than 1/4 cup italian bread crumbs as well as 1/2 can of crab meat.  Also, after the shrooms were stuffed I sprinkled a little bit of bread crumbs and paprika.  They looked great!  (Next time, I think I might also drizzle some butter over the shrooms, they were a little dry)

I really liked this recipe.  I did however made a few changes that made
them even better.  I finely chopped up portabello mushrooms instead of the 
stems of the regular mushrooms and also added finely chopped cooked turkey
bacon and chives and topped them off with breadcrumbs.  The breadcrumbs add a crunchy 
texture to the soft cheese mixture.  I have made them this way on several 
occasions and they always disappear quickly!

I LOVE mushrooms, but I just didn't love this recipe.  It was way too rich for me.  If I make it again, I will use half as much cream cheese.

These were great. I had a lot of people asking for the recipe. I did make one change, though. I followed the recipe, but I did add some lump crabmeat (a small can, I minced it up) when mixing everything together. It was wonderful.

I served these for x-mas dinner and my mother-in-law who is a very picky eater gobbled them up like they were going out of style.  I would have to say that it was a perfect side dish to go along with the roast beef that I fixed.

This was the first time that I ever attempted to make any kind of stuffed mushrooms.  They actually turned out really well.  They were a bit spicey for my liking but next time I will just cut back on the cayenne pepper.

These had a good flavor, but way too watery and runny.  I think maybe if you take out some of the cream cheese and add in bread crumbs, that may do the trick. probaly won't make these again.

These mushrooms will make a huge hit with your family. I added finely chopped crab meat to mine and they were addictive !!  I served the mushrooms along with a Mandarin Orange Almond Salad and Lemon Pepper pork loin roast with garlic mashed potatoes and sugar baby carrots.

I have made these stuffed mushrooms many times from I recipe I found in a Junior-League cookbook. This is a wonderful recipe requested frequently by my teenage son. My recipe also calls for the addition of 1/4 to 1/3 cup of crumbled crisp bacon  mixed into the cream cheese mixture and topped with a sprinkling of shredded cheddar cheese. Great!

These were absolutely scrumptious! I made them for Thanksgiving, and while I make stuffed mushrooms every year, I have never seen any disappear so fast. Very savory, very unique. My only suggestion is to add a lot of salt, and a bit less cream cheese. Also, easy on the cayenne! I gave the recipe to two family members and my husband said it was a "keeper."

These were great!  Everyone wanted to know what the zest in them was. :-)  My grandfather just kept going on and on about them.  They were very simple to make too.  It took about 5 minutes.  Next time I think I will try adding a little sausage. Yum!

super easy, but not super tasty
 it might just be personal taste, but we were overwhelmed with cream cheese. 
loved the process and the simplicity  but we are definitely going to cut the cream cheese next time and add some extra stuff into the stuffing

I'm rating these before eating them but they seem exactly what I want. I did add almost a can of crab meat to the mixture and used way more then just 12 mushrooms. I also added more cheese and cream cheese. I had extra filling. But putting it its a baggy to squirt out was an awesome tip

I have made this many times in the past and is always a big hit I also add hot sausage to the mixture to bring a little meat to the party. Also instead of using cayenne pepper, I add siracha instead for people who are fans of that hot sauce.

I made these for a family meal and they were a hit.  I only changed up a couple of things by adding fresh crab meat in the mix, extra freshly grated Parmesan cheese (1/2 cup), then added Panko and more grated Parmesan cheese on top ??.   Very pleased    Thx for the recipe and the great tips.  Yummy.

We loved it. Used 24 oz of smaller mushrooms and added a bit of prosciutto in the bottom of each. Sprinkled panko on the top.

I have made this recipe several times. It is excellent as is. The last time I tried it, I decided to replace the garlic for shallots, added fresh thyme and a splash of Sherry wine to the stems. Needless to say my guest raved about them. Both the hubby and I were in love with them even though we have eaten them many times. This   slight modification made them even better and gave them a slight twist in flavor for variation. I sprinkled a bit of bread crumbs on top for decoration and popped them in the oven. They were delicious. Try them both ways, you will not regret it! I made 12 white mushrooms and did not use the full 8 oz. of cream cheese. I used about 5 oz. and that was enough for my mushroom caps, so be mindful and either use less cream cheese or use it all and add a few more mushroom caps.

I have made this but the Mushrooms came out like Rubber. What went wrong anyone know. They were in oven for less than 20 mins. Kept watching for the liquid took out soon as it was present. Cant say it's a poor recipe but it dident work for me twice.

Flavoring is good but I'd recommend using less cream cheese, so the cream cheese taste doesn't overpower the mushroom taste.

Made it exactly to recipe. Excellent! Made it again, added a little fresh chopped parsley and a dash of cayenne pepper.  I can't honestly say I improved it. This recipe is a winner.

Amazing! I added bacon, fresh grated parmesan and panko bread crumbs that were mixed with butter, salt, garlic, parsley and pepper. SO good! I made large ones for dinner but think I’ll make button ones for my next endeavor for a bit size favorite

Delicious!  I made these for Christmas as a side and they were amazing.  I had another recipe for crab stuffed and wanted something without crab for those not big on seafood.  Loved both, but I think I favored these over the others.  Creamy and rich filling loaded with flavor.

These were wonderful BUT I don't know if I will make them again.  They are surprisingly tedious and time-consuming to make (in my limited culinary opinion).  I made them for my book group holiday party and they were gone IN AN INSTANT which speaks to how delicious they are.  I am not in anyway criticizing the recipe, just my cooking/prep time expectations.

My filling was comprised of  the sautéed garlic and chopped "mushroom guts", 1/4 cup panko crumbs, 1/4cup shredded parmesan, 1 8-ounce package of cream cheese, and the seasonings per the recipe.  I put  small amount of prosciutto in the bottoms of the mushroom caps before squeezing the filling on top.  Unsure if I would use prosciutto again, as it was more work, more cost, and I didn't really notice the taste.  I made about 30 small-medium mushrooms with this and still had enough left-over filling to probably do about 15 more (fun fact:  the left-over filling is delicious on a toasted bagel the next morning!)  Put a little more shredded parm cheese on top before baking, and there you have it.

This was excellent. I added crab meat as suggested by some of the other reviewers and they were a huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I'll be making them again at Christmas!

Delicious and easy to make.  I used  two 10oz. Boxes of small mushrooms. I did cut back a bit on the cream cheese after reading reviews.  I used 2/3 of the cream cheese.  The total mixture turned out to be the perfect amount to fill all the mushroom caps.

I felt that the cream cheese took over the recipe, next time I wouldn't put as much as it asked for. Other than that, it was good. You definitely need to like cream cheese to like this recipe though.

My family loved it, I wasn't too impressed.  I used real Parmesan, not the kind you buy for pizza.  The Parmesan was too strong for my taste.  Maybe I should have used the kind of parmesan that you shake out of a container.  If using real paremesan, may want to hold off how much you put in this recipe.  Also, be sure to serve fresh out of the oven.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic. I am not a mushroom person and even I enjoyed it. The mushrooms were so juicy and they were vegetarian, which is great. I served these for my guests for Thanksgiving and they were gone in less that five minutes. I did not include the cayenne pepper because I do not enjoy a lot of spice. I also did about half of the amount  of onion powder.

It turned out really well! The only change I made was to use a quarter of an onion, minced, instead of using onion powder. I just usually prefer the whole food instead of powder and it worked out really well. Thank you for the recipe!

Have made this recipe far too many times to count over the years! I will say..a food processor is your best friend while prepping these! Lots n lots of chopping otherwise! Anyway, these never make it as 'left overs' in the fridge at my house or wherever they end up! Hands down crowd favorite.

I love these, they are a hit every time I make them and they are super easy. I modified slightly and add a stalk of celery chopped very small and cook with mushroom stems. Gives it a little extra something. I also add a bit more cayenne for more of a kick!

I've made these about four times and saved half to bake for the next day each time. The cayenne pepper adds a really nice touch so don't leave it out. Delicious.

I used one Boursin cheese instead of the cream cheese and added about 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs to thicken it up. Also chopped up one green onion and fried that up too. Delish !!!!

We LOVE this recipe.  I know it would be delicious as is, but I needed a recipe to use up some frozen cooked breakfast sausages.  I chopped 6 of them up in very small pieces and added them to the mix at the end of sauteeing.  I also substituted Emeril's seasoning for the cayenne because DH is not a fan of cayenne.  They are just delicious and I'm so happy to have found this recipe.

I slightly tweaked this recipe to make for a party.  Added three slices of bacon and one stalk of green onion and followed the rest of the recipe as stated except I bought two containers of 24 mushrooms that made it without any leftover stuffing.  I thought it was a smidge spicy so maybe less cayenne next time.

I made this for a big get-together with friends. I followed the advice to use smaller mushrooms. They were a great hit. This is a good base recipe for adding crab, mushrooms, bacon, etc.

My neighbor gave me some very large baby portobello’s.  I had this recipe saved and had all of the ingredients so I decided to make them.  I made them according to recipe and added bread crumbs, Parmesan and chives on top.  They came out really good!  Really good flavor.  I will definitely make them again.  Quick and easy recipe.

I only used 4 ounces cream cheese, put 4 ounces shredded pepper Jack cheese and about 1/4 cup mayo. Also added about 2 handfuls fresh chopped spinach and 5 finely chopped artichoke hearts. Put Italian cheese blend on top and lightly sprinkled with kosher salt before popping into oven. Basically made spinach and artichoke stuffed mushrooms. Soooo good!!

I made the recioe as is. To take to a Dervy party and for a vegetarian friend. These were soooo bland.  Ii thought they were not tasty enough to take to somek e. Yuck. Ina Garten’s are fo die for- of course they have sausage and marscapone and marsala wine in them. - not vegetarian at all.

I made it! I topped each mushroom off with panko breadcrumbs and since I was out of cayenne I did substitute for hot sauce. They we're surprisingly quick and painless to prepare so I look forward to making these for big family gatherings. I wish I'd of had some green onions on hand for some color but other than that I give this one a complete five stars.

Use bite size smaller mushrooms to make it easier to eat as a appetizer and double them. Olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Add to the original ingredients for the filling: 2 stalks green onions (minced and cooked with the garlic and mushroom stems), a bit more parmesan, garlic powder, crisp bacon and about a cup of cooked dungeoness crab. Dunk the caps in melted butter & lemon before filling, sprinkle with more parmesan and bake in a mini muffin pan. (Beware: if the mushrooms don't fit all the way into the muffin pan, they will come out shaped like muffins! It is kind of cute though.) Cooked for 20 mins. The parmesan topping gives it that extra crunch. Love the heat the Cayenne leaves after you eat it.

I find that 8 oz of cream cheese makes enough for about 24 baby Bella mushrooms. Also I agree with the poster that said sprinkle the part on top.

I was looking for a quick, easy recipe to go with a smoked prime rib and this fit the bill.  I added bacon to mine but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  Great flavor but not too rich.  I also read another reviewer's suggestion to put each mushroom in a muffin tin and let me tell you, that was genius!  I normally try to keep them all upright in a casserole dish, this was MUCH easier.  Great, tasty, easy recipe.

Simply delicious appetizer. You can also add a quarter cup of bread crumbs if you need to stretch the ingredients.

Really good!!! Only made them once and I'm really impressed. Think I'll be cutting back on the cream cheese very slightly and testing out different melty cheeses next time. Update: Doubled the parmesan and now I'm addicted to these things!

Christmas appetizer, used Cremini mushrooms and garlic herb cream cheese and added a well-drained can of crab meat. Used a ziplock with corner cut off to pipe it into the caps. Delicious!!

I will make it again. I didn't have onion powder so I finely chopped and cooked the onions with garlic first. Then added mushrooms. It's taste better than french onion dip! I will make again with a little les cayenne. 
It taste amazing on a triscuit cracker.

These were really good, but they had a LOT of garlic. I might add a little less than what's shown here, but that's just me, I guess. My husband loved them but you could really smell the garlic in his breath! Haha. Also, the instructions were kind of hard to understand. I didn't realize until I watched the video that I was supposed to MELT the cream cheese in with the mushroom/garlic mixture. I was confused because it said you had to wait until the mushroom/garlic mixture was cooled and that seemed to mean that it wasn't on heat anymore. But, all in all, I think if I had made it right it would taste DELICIOUS!

I lost my original hand written recipe for these - I think they're from the St Petersburg Times (Florida). These mushrooms are delicious and work with many different spices - paprika, garlic salt, red pepper flakes.

Grab em fast or you won't get any!!

I added 3 scallions, few drops of worcestershire, 2 tbsp of panko bread crumbs, a few pieces of bacon chopped very fine, and a dab of butter.

I painted on butter to the shroom caps so they would stay moist, filled, topped with morqe panko, finished with a heavy spinkle of parm.

Baked at 350 for 20 mins and finished with 5 mins of briol or until tops are golden. Yum!!!!

With these mods I'd rate them a 5/5

Yum! This is my first time making them and bringing to a family gathering as a side. It was hard to gauge as I made 40 mushrooms (But they were mixed types and some were tiny). Used romano instead of parmesan for the mixture and doubled the recipe, but only ended up using about 3/4 of it. Added the green onion as others did and topped with breadcrumbs and grated parmesan. I said ' I think I'll make these again' and my husband (who was a huge help in prep) said, 'oh, you're definitely making these again!' So it was a win!
*Made these a 2nd time using Vegan cream cheese and added real goat cheese crumbles to the mix for flavor for an overall less calorie, lactose friendly option. Still fabulous!

I used the huge stemless portobello caps and stuffed with only cream cheese, parmesan, and some seasonings (mcCormick Perfect Pinch garlic herb, salt and pepper). Baked at 400 with another appetizer for 20 minutes. Scrumptious.

Great recipe,  but I HAD to add my personal touch,  I browned some sweet italian sausage  and added to mixture with scallions and baked till cooked through,  then broiled for a few minutes to get them brown,  OMG were they good!

My fiancee and I don't particularly like spicy, so we reduced the amount of cajun to roughly 1/8th tsp and it was perfect for our non-spicy pallets with just a LITTLE bite

Pretty good but I think it was a little heavy on the cream cheese. 
Maybe next time I'll reduce the cream cheese and something else.  Not sure what: gruyere,  bread crumbs. 
All I remember is a mouth full of cream cheese

Followed recipe exactly and used to making things like this. Did not enjoy the flavor. Brought it to thanksgiving and those who tried it either didn’t finish theirs or didn’t get seconds. :(

The mushrooms tuned out great! The only change I made was I cut the Parmesan cheese in half and added cheddar cheese on the other half because my husband loves cheddar. They were very good and a great appetizer for our Thanksgiving meal.

Such an easy recipe. The only time consuming is wiping clean the shroom caps. Other than that, I added sautéed maple sausage. Chopped that up with the sautéed garlic. Followed the rest of the recipe. Great recipe!

These garlic mushrooms were a crowd pleaser. People kept coming back for more. I've made them in a conventional oven, convection oven and speed cook oven. For the people that couldn't handle the heat, I reduced the amount of cayenne pepper and black pepper.

As is, the recipe has way too much cream cheese.   Basically it just tastes like cream cheese baked on a mushroom.

This is hands down my favorite thing to take to parties! Everyone always loves it! Probably better for smaller mushrooms rather so it is a bite size pop in your mouth! Just made a batch and can't wait!

Been making this recipe to a tee for the last few years. My sister who is an amazing cook requests it for every dinner I host. Really easy to prep and make the filling ahead and then just stuff the mushrooms and pop in the oven when ready. Side note,  this is also an excellent keto/paleo/low carb app option!

I've made these several times, always to glowing reviews. My dad, who loves stuffed mushrooms and often gets them at restaurants, says these are the best stuffed mushrooms he's ever had. I don't even like mushrooms but these are so good I actually eat them.

Great side or App. I forgot to add the Parmesan in the mix, but saved myself by topping the stuff mushrooms with the grated Parmesan. It worked out great, the Parmesan crusted on the top to give it good texture and a crisp top to an otherwise mushy dish.

My husband loved this. He said they tasted like restaurant stuffed mushrooms.  I don't like mushrooms but I ate the stuffing. It was a little spicy for my kiddos. I did half the cream cheese. Everything else was per recipe.

I added 3TB of Italian breadcrumbs and 8 oz of riced butternut squash. It was yummy and I will definitely make it again.

I’ve wanted to try making stuffed mushrooms for a while, and these turned out really well. It was a little time consuming, but not difficult. I added a little more garlic and cayenne than called for, doubled the mushrooms, and topped with a mixture of breadcrumbs and shredded parmesan per other reviewers’ advice. The only change I would make would be to add a little chopped bacon or Italian sausage to the filling, just to give it more texture, it was a little too creamy. That said, they only lasted about ten minutes, I would definitely make them again.

The only change I had to make was cut back on the cayenne pepper. My family loves mushrooms but they were to spicy. Also add extra parmesan cheese yummy.

Easy to make .  I suggest halfing the cream cheese amount and adding canned crab meat and maybe some bread crumbs.

This recipe is great!  When I made it I also added 1/4 cup  crispy baccon  that I cooked first, put in bowl then cooked the garlic and mushroom caps.  I also minced a small shallot and cooked with garlic mixture instead of using onion powder  I also used half pkg cream cheese and goat cheese.  I cooked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees to get tops slightly brown.  Great as a meal with risotto too!

These are wonderful I use regular large button mushrooms  and I add a bit of minced green pinons  to the mix and sometimes some cooked bacon I love the idea of dipping the caps in melted butter and rolling in parmesan cheese before baking  …..makes them really special

I found these really easy to make and good in flavor. I did opt to use fresh parm. cheese. I saw where some did breadcrumbs to the top and that added crunch would be nice. I'll try that next time!

I took a big batch to a party and several people have asked tor this recipe! They were VERY tasty! The only things I added  were additional Parmesan cheese in the mixture, sprinkled even more on top, and also added about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and they were really delicious. But I did have plenty of extra filling that I ate with some crackers. 

Don't preheat your oven right away. The chopping can be time consuming if you don't use some kind of appliance other than a knife, but the thing is, that the filling needs to cool before you even fill the mushrooms. I wouldn't preheat the oven until you've taken the filling off the stove. 

 I didn't see any reason to wait for the mixture to cool before putting in the spices and parmesan cheese. It's easier to mix evenly while the ingredients are warm.

My oven is new so it runs hotter then I'm used to, and I still thought they could have cooked another minute or two.

I would either double the number of mushrooms or cut the amount of cream cheese in half. 

I picked this recipe because it's low-carb-- no bread crumbs. However, I think a sprinkle of panko bread crumbs on top would make them even better. I want to try mixing in some chunk crab meat, next time. They seem to need a little texture as the stuffing is very creamy and the mushrooms are soft.

The recipe was okay. I found it a little bland, so I cooked up some bacon and chopped in bits and topped off each mushroom cap with them. Great addition!

So good. I've made 3x now for various get-togethers, and it's always a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly the first time except left out the cayenne - I don't care for spicy so much. I've also made with diced onion that I sautéed until super soft. Great both ways.

This was the first time ever making stuffed anything.  It was an easy recipe to follow...and simple.  I read the other reviews and I did change a couple of things.  I used olive oil and I added more fresh grated parmesan to the filling.  I also sauteed finely diced onion with the garlic and stems.  Last, I topped each mushroom with a small bit of mozzarella and melted it in the oven (broil).  You really can taste each ingredient and I think they taste just as good the day after as leftovers.

I followed the recipe as it was and it was absolutely delicious for having stuffed mushrooms for the first time.  Some of the alternative recipes I may try again on the next try.  But  I recommend this dish.

These were delicious! Followed the recipe except added more cayenne pepper and onion powder. Also decided to bread and fry them in the air fryer for 13 minutes at 350 degrees instead of baking them. Came out delicious! My husband loved them!

These came out great. My husband loved them....Love the taste.  I added jalapeño peppers and bacon to mine. I also doubled the amount of mushroom....the filling makes a lot.I would definitely make them again. If anything....I’d bake them a bit longer than the 20 min.....just to make sure they are nice and hot in the center.

Excellent but I added salt to mine and a bit more Parmesan cheese. Also grated block parmesan to the tops. I also added less cayenne and included paprika. My husband ate it up!  Here is the picture - most were gone before I could take the picture!

It was delicious! However I'd make some changes. I'd put the filling in a ziploc bag, and cut the bottom corner out to use as a pipette to fill the mushroom caps more easily. Also I'd cut in half all the ingredients except the mushrooms themselves because I had way too much filling. I'd also put on the Parmesan cheese at the end instead of in the filling for that extra crunch. But overall, the cayenne pepper added a nice little kick to it that went very well with it. A delicious recipe!

I’m so sorry but I followed this recipe to a T and I also love stuffed mushrooms but this was not good.  The center was mushy and too heavy on the cream cheese and the texture and taste was an overall “blah.”  I have better stuffed mushroom recipes that I will use.

This recipe was a hit, and the mushrooms were gone it no time!  I didn't have grated Parmesan cheese, so used a cheddar blend in place of it.  I also added about 4 ounces already cooked hot ground sausage to the cream cheese mixture.  I used a 1-pound package of small mushrooms, and had about 25% of the filling left over.  The next time I make them, I will buy larger mushrooms, so there is more room for the filling.  I made these to serve that evening, but then forgot all about cooking them.  I kept them refrigerated, then baked and served them the following night.  I don't think this hurt them in any way.  I like being able to prep foods ahead of time, so was glad to see that it works for this recipe.

Delicious. A great appetizer, served it at my New Year's Eve Party to rave reviews. Super easy too. I ended up cooking mine for closer to 30 minutes to get a nice brown top.  Also, I had enough filling for closer to 16 or 17 mushrooms instead of 12. Will buy more next time.

Made strictly to recipe. In my opinion, too much cream cheese, not enough zing. Next time I'll use 4 oz cream cheese and maybe some horseradish. Other reviewers have some great suggestions but totally create a different rx.

These were good BUT they definitely have a kick to them because of cayenne. Next time I make these, I will definitely reduce the amount of cayenne to 1/8 of a teaspoon!

Loved by all for a Xmas eve appetizer!  Great for the vegetarians in the group, but loved by all!  Very creamy.  I used the recipe for about 18 white mushroom caps, so the size was right.  I didn't overfill them, knowing it would melt out.  So, had some of the filling left over.  I will try again with the addition of some chopped spinach, I think.

No offense to the person posting the recipe, but these were nasty. Way too heavy and thick with the dairy products. It was sour and somewhat tasteless. My instincts told me to add breadcrumbs. That may have improved it somewhat but it was just a bland,  somewhat mushy mess.

Wonderful recipe!  Everyone loved this.  Made as directed and added a small piece of prosciutto for an extra flavor into each mushroom (and a tiny piece on top).  Will definitely make again.

Easy to make. I was actually excited to make them because it does seem like something you would be served at a high class restaurant or formal affair. 
Would be nice to have to offer guests at your home before serving a meal. Best eaten hot.
Don't taste so good as leftovers the next day. You really have to like mushrooms.

I thought I'ld try making theese because I had 8 mushrooms in the fridge.  I halved the recipe and still had to overstuff them to use up all the filling.  I made a topping with bread crumbs and parmesan to roll the top in.   It worked out well and held together durring the cooking process.  The cooking time was right on.  These are good everyone really liked them but they aren'y my favorite.  I'm hooked on stuffed mushrooms with bread crumbs, egg, spinach, and cheese.

These were easy to make and an absolute hit at my family's Thanksgiving gathering. I made ahead one day and stored unbaked in the refrigerator in a glass pie dish. Worked great!

Made it per the recipe, except I used chipotle instead of cayenne and baked at 375 for 18 minutes. 

My wife and I both enjoyed them; they’ve made the Xmas entertaining list.

Absolutely delicious! I used a package of white mushrooms and halved the garlic, cream cheese, onion powder, cayenne, and black pepper (some of my mushrooms were tiny) and it worked out perfectly. Could pop them up on the top rack for the last 5 min so they become a bit browned, but very good!

Too spicy. Kids wouldn’t eat them. The spice covers up any other flavor. I’ll cut back the cayenne and add diced onions or bacon.

Made these gems but took the advise of some others and glad I did! Mixed some panko bread crumbs, can of crab, mozzarella cheese, and used large stuffing portabella mushrooms. Made a dozen of these scrumptious mushrooms and only two were left. Midnight snack :)

These are absolutely delicious!  I did add a can of crab and i brushed the mushroom caps with melted butter that had a sprinkle of garlic powder and Italian seasoning. This would probably make about 24 mini mushrooms. 2 boxes was about 19 and the mixture spilled over into the pan.  They are restaurant quality as they are, but I think a mornay sauce would definitely put them over the top.  This will be my new go to appetizer for parties.

I got many compliments on the these! I followed other recommendations and brushed butter on the mushrooms, and placed them in muffin pans to keep from rolling over. I also added bacon. So yummy! Don't skip the cayenne. It gives them the slightest kick that they need. I might add more next time.

Easy to make and was the perfect accent to my family get together! I made one alteration, dipped the tops (filling side up) with seasoned croutons that I crushed (didnt have bread crumbs).  Everyone LOVED it! Also baking these in mini muffin pans and brushing with butter was a great tip from one of the other reviewers.

I hesitate to rate this as i didnt make it as written.  Everyone loved them however and i think the basics are the key.  My husband does not like a distinct garlic taste so I had to find another flavor.  I used shallots with the chopped mushroom stems.  I thought the filling was a bit bland so added a few drops of balsalmic vinegar or worstishire to each mushroom cap before i filled them.  Im not sure that did much but they sure were good and i will make them again.

I made this for a party last night and people loved them. I bought 30 small mushrooms and so doubled the recipe; however, there was way too much rilling. Next time I'll just just one recipe for 30 small mushrooms. I used the extra filling as part of the cheese platter as a spreadable cheese - so it wasn't a complete waste.

This is an excellent recipe. Actually I made this combining several similar recipes from this site. I used the spices and cream cheese, added real bacon bits, green onions and wrapped them in bacon also. This is one of those dishes that you know is not so healthy but you can't stop eating them until they are gone.

Turned out great.   I use a combination of hot sausage and sweet sausages in place of the chopped stems. Shot of Tabasco doesn’t hurt either!

Ugh, there were horrific. 20 minutes at 350 degrees makes a slimy rubbery ball of mushroom cap with no flavor except the cheese that's dripped everywhere but. 

No, to make this combination of ingredients edible I had to chop the stuffed mushrooms and stick in a pan with a little olive oil and fry it all, cheese as well, because this is not a normal flavor combination, and then add some toasted bread "croutons" in order for it to have some actual food to cling to. Now, it's been hours and there's still an aftertaste. I'm am so done with mushrooms after yet another failure.

Other recipes for stuffed mushrooms advise baking or roasting the empty caps thoroughly for 20 minutes on one side, the flipping and giving it another 10 minutes, then filling and then baking again for 10 minutes, all at 450 degrees!

Also, there's nothing in the recipe regarding a parmesan or bread crumb topping, though something is shown in the original and other folks' photos.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. I used small bite sized mushrooms and it made about 50. Like other reviews I did coat outside with a little vegan butter and rolled in Italian crumble. They were amazing!!!!

Made these last weekend, using Baby Bella mushrooms.  The size of the Baby Bella was perfect; not too big, but not too small.  Added diced green onion, fresh bacon crumbles, and a few drops of Worcestershire for that little "smoky" flavor, and they were fantastic!  I made about 18 mushrooms, and then still had a bit of the stuffing mixture left.  We used the rest of the stuffing mix in omelettes the next morning, and they were a hit as well!  This will definitely be something I make on a regular basis now.

So good & so easy. I felt as if small mushrooms would be very tedious stuffing. So I bought two large portobellos, cooked the garlic with some ground turkey. Added green onion to the mix with fat free cream cheese & the rest of the recipe as it called for. DELICIOUS!

Had a little bit of leftover crab meat so I chopped that up and mixed it in too.  Wife is a connoisseur of stuffed mushrooms and loved these.  Had a little bit of filling left over but put that to use as a dip for some corn chips while I waited for the mushrooms to cook.  I will be making these again.  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe as written and they were delish! I was afraid the filling would melt all over the place but that didn't happen at all. Will definitely make again!

FANTASTIC!!!!! Super easy to make and sooooo delicious! The only change I made was to roll the tops into seasoned panko breadcrumbs before baking, which was a great touch. Hubby could not get enough of these...they will be made, often~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is freaking amazing! I usually only eat mushrooms on a steak, but my husband loves them so I gave this recipe a shot. Didn't change a single thing and I even ate 4 myself! Definitely recommend this.

Excellent.  I toast a handful of breadcrumbs in a pan with butter and then dip the  top of the stuffed shroom in the crumbs prior to baking.

Loved this! I followed the recipe but I wanted to make them a little more substantial, I added a cup of stuffing to the mixture and followed everything else from there. We demolished these! So good! I used crameni mushrooms and the addition of the stuffing went really well. The  sage and onion seemed to blend right in. Thanks for this one! It was so easy I'll be making this one again and again.

I made this for an appetizer party. I followed the directions to the letter. I used baby portabella mushrooms, and I used fresh Parmesan that I shaved rather than the grated variety. These were a HIT. Everyone wanted the recipe. The heat from the Cayenne pepper was perfect--not too much and gave it a zip that had people going back for more. I doubled the recipe, and I wish I had tripled it!

Incredibly delicious!! I love the kick of the cayenne. Sometimes I use 1 thing of cream cheese with 12 mushrooms (like the recipe calls for) if I want it to be really cheesy, and other days I will put that amount of filling inside 18 mushrooms if I want higher of a mushroom to cheese ratio. Either way, it's amazing.

I added 1 green onion to the pan when cooking the stems and garlic and followed the suggestion to add 1 piece of chopped cooked bacon to the cheese mixture. I also melted about 1 Tbsp of butter in the microwave then stirred in 1/4 C or so of bread crumbs. Sprinkled buttered bread crumbs and a little parmesan cheese over top of mushrooms prior to baking. Everyone loved them! Definitely makes enough for 24 mushrooms

I cooked up some sausage, chopped it up and added it to the stems and garlic. Instead of onion powder, I cut up a shallot and cooked it along with the stems and garlic. At the end of the baking,  I topped each with shredded cheese and baked for another 5 mins. until the cheese melted on the tops. I only use the Baby Portabella Mushrooms because they taste the best. My husband and I loved these and ate them all up in one setting.

This was my 1st Allrecipe let down. :( I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was wayyy too heavy on the cream cheese. All you are eating is cream cheese inside a mushroom. Not much flavor and very heavy. I also tried it the way other reviewers suggested with breadcrumbs and a little butter drizzled on top. These were slightly better, but I wouldn't make again.

Bleh, I'm not sure what Every other reviewer on here is making, but these were met with lots of spitting out into the trash at my house. Too much cream cheese, not enough of anything else. It needs salt for the love.

I make these from time to time, and they are yummy. Sometimes I add different herbs to the cream cheese mixture. Dill works nicely, as does dried oregano.

Made these for an appetizer.   To save time and mess, I made the filling the night before, keeping the mushroom caps unrefrigerated in a paper bag and the filling in the fridge. Once guests arrived I filled and baked them with a sprinkle of extra Parmesan on top.  My family really enjoyed them.

I made these to exact recipe.. they were good I only gave 3 stars. Because the cream cheese over powers the garlic and other ingredients.. if I make these again I would definitely cut back on cream cheese half of the package is more then enough...

Followed the recipe exactly and they came out alright. Next time I will add crab meat to the filling and butter the mushrooms before baking. Will also sprinkle with bread crumbs and melted butter before baking. Bake 15 min broil 5.

My first time ever making stuffed mushrooms, these came out great. The only thing I did differently was instead of chopping up the steams I just chopped up a mix of different mushrooms ( shittake,cremini, portabella etc) finely. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I just sprinkled with grated parm and they were super super super delicious!

This is a great recipe!  I've made it numerous times and can adjust the recipe based in what I have in the pantry and our tastes that night.  I really think your tastes should determine how much cream cheese you use.  If I don't have fresh onion or garlic I'll use onion flakes and garlic powder. It's still amazing.  I add some cheese (whatever white cheese I have) to the top.  Really great recipe as is or adjusted.  I don't even look at the recipe anymore I just start creating and taste as I go.

I made these for the first time today. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and had enough filling for twice as many mushrooms. Next time, I'll use 24 baby Bellas and I think that would be perfect. I'll probably cut the amount of cayenne in half since my husband and I are wimps. In looking at others'comments, I want to try crabmeat and some lemon in the filling occasionally. I'm on a low carb diet, so this recipe is perfect as listed and I can change it up a bit for variations. Thanks so much for sharing it!

These mushrooms are amazing!! We love them without changing a thing. They can be modified by added other cheeses, which I have, or adding toppings or other ingredients, but then they wouldn't be THIS recipe. Simple yet elegant! Thanks for sharing, my husband and I LOVE mushrooms  and this recipe is one of our FAVORITES, and we even get request to make them.  Wonderful in large caps or small.

Simple, and very easy.  I did follow the suggestions from others and cooked them in the cupcake containers and brushed them with butter.  This was a treat for Valentine's Day for my hubby.  And it was a success!  I scored with this one!

This is easy enough to make that it doesn't need to be saved for parties. You do need more then 12 mushrooms for the 8 oz cream cheese, and I added some garlic powder and extra parm. The mushroom stems really cook down, so maybe I'd add in an extra mushroom next time. Really tasty! Edit: if you use fresh ground black pepper, it gives it a bit of zip, and you could scale back if your crowd isn't into that.

We liked this recipe very much, but next time I will cut the cayenne pepper to 1/8 tsp., the heat was intense with 1/4  tsp., and we like things with heat.  I had some leftover filling that I used as a cheese spread for crackers.

These are very good.  Everyone else at the party thought so too.  The cayenne pepper gives them a little bite and good flavor but they aren't spicy hot at all.  I brushed the mushrooms with butter so they wouldn't dry out but it may not have been necessary.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.

This is a different type stuffed mushroom dish.  We liked it, and might make them again.  One thing you might want to do before making any stuffed mushroom, is to remove the lungs.  Do this by gently scooping it out with a spoon.   You will be able to add more stuffing to the mushroom.

We double the number of mushrooms to match the amount of stuffing as others had suggested.  Some of the mushrooms were still over-stuffed.  But it was a hit at Christmas dinner and would definitely make again!

These are good tasting.  Four stars because the accompanying picture clearly shows bread crumbs but no crumbs listed in the recipe.  I've never had stuffed mushrooms without bread crumbs.  So, I added some buttered bread crumbs on top before baking...delicious as my grandson says, who won't normally eat mushrooms.

These turned out fantastic! Super easy and absolutely delicious. I substituted a bit of hatch chile powder for the cayenne. These were an excellent side dish, and they'd be awesome for a potluck or party. They're pretty tasty whether they're piping hot or after they've cooled.

replaced: vegetable oil with equal Olive oil.  Parmesan with equal shredded mozzarella.  400F instead of 350F
deviations: I drained the excess oil from the mushroom and garlic bits before mixing.

Absolutely what I was hoping for.  I popped one of them in my mouth after they cooled, and it was... really, really hard not to eat the rest...

Suggestion for others: Make sure you have BIG mushrooms.  Some of mine were barely more than an inch across, and they couldn't actually fit much of the cream cheese mix in them.   I had left over cream cheese mix, too.  The few I had that were ~2 inches in diameter were just about right.

Just made this exactly to spec. Way too hot for my family!!! I will probably do 1/2 the amt of Cayenne pepper and black pepper next time. I personally like stuff with a kick. These are still burning my lips and throat. My nose is runny too. Lol

I did like 1 review to coat the shrooms with melted butter. I also enjoyed dipping my shroom in fresh squeezed lemon juice. I may cut the cream cheese in 1/2 next time and replace with Italian bread crumbs to lighten the taste. Overall, a great flavor!

Not a fan. If I ever make this again & that's a big if, I'd cut way, way back on the cream cheese. Like maybe use half the amount called for, or even less.

I agree with the others when they say that the filling is for way more than 12 mushrooms. I could only find bigger sized mushroom, and I filled about 16. I think the recipe would have turned out better with smaller mushrooms (better mushroom to filling ratio).

Just made these and they were a huge hit. I also added some Italian bread crumbs as a topping for a bit more texture. Excellent, easy recipe. Next time I'm thinking of adding some bacon bits to the cream cheese stuffing.

Delicious! Tastes just like you would find in a fancy restaurant. I went by the recipe but topped each one with grated parmesan so it baked a nice crust on top. Husband and I loved them and even the kids enjoyed them.

Great recipe! Used cotija cheese instead of Parmesan and minced dried onion instead of powder. Didn't use exact measurements. Delicious. Will definitely make again.

I found these to just be bland and overpowered by the cream cheese.  I followed the recipe exactly as instructed.  While I added the cream cheeese my spidey senses told me this seems like way too much. The thought hit me after I already put it in and I didn't read other reviews.  I was underwhelmed with the finished product and there are many other really good stuffed mushroom recipes out there.  Look elsewhere.

These were great. I looked for small shrooms and used my 1/4 tsp to dig out the insides.   Also added a bit of Boursin to the filling since I had some leftover.   Will definitely make again.

These are delicious. I made a few changes that some other people here suggested, but a GREAT base recipe that can be changed up however you like. Whomever came up with using a plastic baggie for the filling, (cutting off one corner & using like a pastry bag), deserves a great big gold star by their name. Such an easy & effective way to fill/ stuff mushrooms &  other vegetables. Thank you for the recipe and all the wonderful suggestions!! :)

Everyone loved it! And the prep really was very easy and quick, which means this will probably become a regular dish at my house. The stuffing was beautifully rich and thick. My only suggestion is to either use less cream cheese or buy more mushrooms! I could have stuffed twice as many mushrooms as the recipe calls for with the amount of stuffing I produced.

Hubs thought it was a 4 star, but not me. It needed something like salmon or crab which he said we'd try next time. I think putting bread crumbs on the top might help also like others suggested & will try that also.

I made a half recipe.  Skipped the onion powder, but added 1 green onion to the saute mix.   After cooling, added some cooked breakfast sausage and mixed all with the cream cheese.  After stuffing, mounding with a spoon, topped with  2 Tbs. Italian bread crumbs mixed with 2 Tbs. mellted butter,  2 Tbs. grated and chopped Parmasan, and a pinch of grated lemon zest. and baked.  Tasty, and will make again.  6/24/17:  Made again today making a whole recipe instead of half and added 1/3 c. chopped bacon.  Yum!  However, a half recipe is more than enough for 8 oz. of mushrooms.  Spread the rest of the filling on crackers to eat.  Tried baking in a mini-muffin pan but did not like the results.  Although they were a perfect fit in the pan, they came out mushy because there was nowhere for the moisture to escape.  Next time will go back to using a glass casserole dish.  It prevents the mushrooms from rolling off the sides (like on a cookie sheet) and allows enough space between the mushrooms for them to cook without becoming mushy.

Lived up to expectations.    One batch looked cooked, but seemed a little chewey, so will watch out for that next time.
For presentation purposes , I sat them on paper towel for a few minutes so that the moisture would not be left on the platter.
I guess it is obvious, but the recipe does not specify to put them upside down on the cookie sheet.
People loved the taste, will do again, often.

I made them as an appetizer at a family gathering.  The same response was heard over and over again, "Oh my those are awesome".   Once I started to make them I found I didn't have onion powder so I threw in chopped chives.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I made this following the recipe the first time and they came out very good and were very popular among my friends. When I made them the second time I used butter instead of oil and I cooked the diced mushroom leftovers in white wine which really brought more flavor to the finished recipe.

Made these for New Years Eve & they were yummy.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  The only addition I made was, after filling, I dunked the tops in melted butter & dipped in panko bread crumbs.  They turned out amazing!  I filled close to 2 dozen small to medium sized mushrooms and had plenty of cream cheese filling left over.  This recipe can potentially make quite alot, depending on the mushroom size.

Excellent simple recipe that's great either for a small crowd or a large one.  Only change I made was halving the cayenne due to a spice baby in the receiving group, but I suspect it would have been better with the full dose.

This doesn't have the luxurious quality of any of the meat and hard cheese stuffed mushrooms but it's easy and really tasty.  I'll definitely make it again.  Bonus:  I had leftover mix (small mushrooms were all I could get) which works pretty well as a chip dip.

These were very good for the first go around.  I will admit I read a bunch of reviews and borrowed ideas that I thought were helpful, so I apologize it isn't exactly as the recipe is written.  

The only ingredient I added was about a cup of crabmeat.  I went a little heavy - heaping 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and used about a half cup of fresh shredded parm.  I didn't have onion powder so I used about a tablespoon of dried chopped onion in its place and sautéd with stems and garlic.  I did dunk the shrooms in melted butter prior to filling to help keep them moist while cooking.  Using a zip lock bag to fill them was really a big help as well.  

Lastly I topped each one with a good amount of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and drizzled the rest of the butter over that.  Cooked for 20 minutes and broiled for the last 5-8 for a crunchy brown top.   

I really didn't think 1/4 tsp. of cayenne could be too powerful for the amount of cream cheese etc, which is why I went a little heavy, but they did have more bite than I expected. So that is something to consider depending on your tastes.  I was surprised my husband liked them as much as he did because he isn't a big fan of too much spice which is up my alley.  He said he liked the after kick and not to use less next time.  And there will be a next time.  Will also play around with adding some other options. like bacon, had I had some on hand last time would have added - there are a bunch of ideas.

I added 4 pieces of crumbled bacon and used hatch chili powder instead of cayenne pepper. YUM! I also added some parmesan cheese on top before baking.

The stuffing was much more than 12 mushrooms worth. I would do probably 25 mushrooms total next time.

I added a cup of crab, but otherwise followed the instructions.  I  wasn't sure what type of pan to use, and ended up using a large rectangular glass pan.  The liquid from the mushroom caps pooled under them and was pretty messy when I served the mushrooms as an appetizer.  Other than that, they were delicious, disappeared within minutes, and I will definitely make them again.

I made this since it had such high reviews, well, let me just say, I did not like them at all.  Maybe I did something wrong while cooking?  I don't think I will be making this again.  All I tasted was garlic and cream cheese....

As stated, these taste just like restaurant-style stuffed mushrooms. A nice treat once in a while...they are a bit time consuming to make.

I have tried several stuffed mushroom recipes over the years and this one is the BEST! I used Locatelli Pecorino Romano cheese instead of the parmesan - it gave the stuffing a smooth, rich flavor.

I just made these for the second time and they flew off the plate! I have been requested to make them for New Years as well.  I did take some notes from other reviews and used the smaller mushrooms as well as put the filling in a bag and snipped off the end and filled them like a pastry! I also added so progresso Italian bread crumbs in the mix, as well as sprinkled on top. Other then that, I followed the recipe exactly!

Made these for the first time today (it's Christmas!) as part of an appetizer smorgasbord and they were a huge hit! Simple, quick, and very satisfying. I cleaned the mushrooms and made the filling on Christmas Eve and put them together on Christmas afternoon. I followed the advice of other reviewers and brushed the mushrooms with butter, this gave them a great texture. I also added a well drained can of pink salmon to the filling to balance out the amount of cream cheese. I will be adding these to my regular recipe collection!

This is good recipe but too much cream cheese vs parmesan cheese.  Not enough garlic.  Not juicy enough.
I'm going back to filling that has butter, bread crumbs, olive oil, parm cheese.

The only adjustments I made were that I used both grated and shredded Parmesan and added bread crumbs to the top.  They were wonderful!!! Next time i'LL add crab or sausage to make them a bit heartier but they were great and easy to make.  Will for sure make these many more times.

I have made these several times, and everyone loves them. One thing I do that is not in the recipe is, after the mushrooms have been stuffed, I brown the caps in the same pan where the filling was prepared before putting them in the oven. Makes them juicier.

I simply love this recipe.... every time I make it , it is the hit of the party.    It doesn't last.    I made a few changes by using  fresh sautéed onions and garlic.   I love both so much and fresh is always better.   Also I used more Parmesan cheese  than required and topped  the mushrooms  after stuffing.  Also  after cooking for 20 minutes I broil for a few minutes until golden  brown on top.

Great recipe!! Super easy to make and you can make them fast!. But for my opinion, 8 oz of cream cheese was too much for only 12 mushrooms. I probably use 1/3 of cream cheese per dozen. But they were delicious!!

Great tasting. Made these for Thanksgiving for a little variety. There was a ton of filling left (and I used big white mushrooms from Costco). For 12 mushrooms I'd cut the cream cheese down to 4 or 6 ounces instead of using the whole 8 oz block (cut the block in half or use 75% of it). I'd keep the other ingredients as is. Good flavor.

Due to the mixed reviews on this recipe as-is,  I first put together the filling as written and stuffed one mushroom, as a "test" subject. The original recipe is fine, if a little boring. As it stood, I ended up doubling the recipe, and added about 1/4t of garlic powder, some chopped green onions, and about a pound of shrimp (they were on sale and way less expensive than crab, but still added that extra something). 

I made these the night before, then right before serving I pulsed together a couple plain rice cakes, some shredded Romano cheese, and some more green onions, topped the shrooms, and baked accordingly. With those changes, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

The recipe is good indeed. But did modify it while stuffing. We do not like some sweet or sour stuff much so I added less of cheese cream. Else i added thinly chopped red bell pepper and boiled corn. Also I did add two teaspoons of BBQ sauce and one tablespoon of Sriracha hot chillies sauce.

These were very easy to make. Half of the cream cheese made enough filling for 12 mushrooms. I also added a little turkey sausage for a different taste. Everyone loved them.

Super tasty, I would add breading (didn't think of it when making the ingredients list but saw it in the picture) next time, but they are very good without. Don't serve it with anything else cheese/cream based because its definitely got cream cheese in it. we doubled the spice levels to great success.

I made this but i sautéed the mushrooms in butter and minced garlic first before baking in the oven @425 for 20 min.   Secondly.... I made the filling but added some shredded artisan Chedder cheese and sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil (tbsp or more of olive oil also with sun-dried tomatoes) xtra cayenne, freshly ground cracked pepper and NO SALT..... (per parm is salty already) . Thirdly....i put xtra shredded cheese and parsly panko mixture on top. It gives a great texture/crunch factor!!!  Then drizzled melted butter over each one.

We loved this version of the recipe. It was creamy, cheesey, hint of spicy and full  flavor with the sun dries tomatoes in olive oil.  Will continue to make this  years to come!!! So delicious.

I have made these several times and LOVE them!  All my fave flavors:. Garlic, parmesan, cream cheese in a stuffed mushroom!  I didn't change anything.  First time I thought the garlic amounts seemed like too much, but it really wasn't.  Yum!!

I followed the directions and first I've got to say that cheese stuffing is divine! I could eat it with a spoon! It would be great on baked potatoes, too. When I make it again I think I will use portobello mushrooms since they have a large flat fillable surface. I had difficulty with the mushrooms I chose. They were rounded and wanted to roll on the cookie sheet. I lost a lot of filling goodness that melted on the cookie sheet. Although the stem hole was deep, it wasn't wide enough to hold the cheesy goodness. But this recipe is definitely a winner, if just for the cheese filling alone!

Absolutely incredible!  I made the recipe exactly as written and they turned out perfectly.   I will definitely be making them again.  I did take the advice and put the filling in a ziploc bag and cut off the tip to fill the caps.  I also used a mini muffin tin to bake them in.

Really REALLY good!!! I make these all the time and they are always a hit!!! I like to add Italian turkey sausage to bulk up the filling. Just cook it with the mushroom stems and stir in the cream cheese before you stuff the shroomies. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I thought this was too spicy. Next time I would only use half the pepper. I had to run to the store for more cream cheese and had to add chopped spinach to fix it.

My boyfriend repeatedly asks for these mushrooms. I have offered to try other recipes, but we both like this one so much that we always go with it! The only thing I do differently is add about 3 times the garlic, but we love garlic. Also, even if you stuff the mushrooms completely full and overflowing, you will have a ton of the cream cheese mixture left over. This is great on bagels, or you can do what I usually do and just double the mushrooms.

I used baby portabella mushrooms and would have had a lot of filling left over if I only used 12 mushrooms.  I made the recipe as indicated the first time, but will add a parmesan and panko topping next time.

Unfortunately these didn't live up to my expectations. First off, an incorrect picture is shown on the recipe page. This recipe does not use any breadcrumbs, but that's clearly what we see in the picture. Secondly, 8 ounces is way too much cream cheese! It's an entire block! It overpowers the flavor. With no breadcrumbs, the filling texture is left to be desired. Also, oil is not needed to remove water from chopped mushrooms; simply put the finely chopped mushrooms into a skillet on medium heat. Saute the garlic separately! I'm just disappointed. :(

I excluded the cayenne pepper as nobody in the house is a huge fan of really spicy food.  Result was still excellent and will be a special treat from time to time.

These are delicious! The only thing i add thats not on the recipe which i highly recommend is a bread crumb topping. Just use regular panko crumbs and fry them in a little bit of butter till they are toasty, then sprinkle over the finished mushrooms.

I'm the type of cook who eyeballs just about everything except for baking. I made 15 nice size caps as an accompaniment for dinner this evening. My filling consisted of Cream Cheese, Fresh Rosemary, Chopped Stems,Fresh Garlic,Bread Crumbs, White Pepper and Smoked Gouda. Absolutely Superb. The Gouda takes it up several notches along with the herbs. At the end...Sprinkle with Buttered Bread Crumbs and a give a quick broil. You can't go wrong with this version.

This was very good although I doubled the recipe and found I did not need to double the filling. The recipe as is should fill about 20 mushrooms. If I made them again I don't think I would use the stems in the filling.

Yummy! I made a few changes: I fried an equivalent amount of onion along with the mushroom stems and doubled the rest of the ingredients. Adding bacon really made this even more savory! My boyfriend loves it. Very hearty.

I make these almost exactly as written, except for 2 things: 1 cup cheddar instead of parm, and no breadcrumb topping. I just sprinkle a little shredded cheddar on top before baking.

I started with the original recipe and kept notes handy from previous reviews, tasting as I went. It was definitely too rich and not at all "stuffing" like. I added 1/2 c. panko bread crumbs, 1/4 parm, and ground smoked chipotle instead of the spicier pepper. I minced the stems and sautéed them with 6 cloves of fresh garlic in olive oil and a tiny bit of truffle oil. The entire volume when combined filled 10 medium portobello mushroom caps (~2-3" across). 

The flavor was decent. Very creamy still but better with the panko (more like a stuffing). My vegetarian friend enjoyed them and had seconds! ???? Would I make them again? Probably not. They were underwhelming.

When I make these, I feel like I am dining in a gourmet 5-star restaurant, which is why I am giving them 5 stars! These are perfection, just make sure you have lots of mushroom caps because there is enough cream cheese to fill a bunch! My boyfriend would eat 50 of these in one sitting if I let him.

This is one of the best stuffed mushrooms I have made and one of the easiest.  The only thing I added was some finely diced onion to the mushrooms.  What a nice change from the meat or seafood stuffed mushrooms that are usually served.

I used Fat Free cream cheese.  And all I had was 6 1/2 oz.  I still had more than enough filling.   I used 14 Large caps. They were easy and very good (probably not as good as if I had used regular cream cheese, but I'm trying to watch what I eat). I was surprised at how spicy they were with just 1/4 t cayenne.  I can see how some people would think they are too spicy, but it was fine for me.

My husband loves stuffed mushrooms so I made these for him.  He raved about them!  After eating a few we settled on a few things.  There was too much cream cheese, it could have used some sausage or bacon maybe for added flavor.  I did dip the mushrooms in butter before the oven to keep them from drying out and also a splash of worchestershire sauce to the sautee mix.  A very good recipe - but may change those things next time.

Thanks to all of the reviews to helping me tweek the recipe! I put in olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make the mushroom stem mixture, but did not bake mushrooms in oil because it is healthier without it. Got rid of the onion powder all together, but added some lemon in the filling. Added a bit less cayenne pepper, and it was still a still a little too spicy for my liking. Put in only half of the cream cheese package, and sprinkled parsley on top after it was cooked. I love how this recipe includes using mushroom stems, I think that it was much less wasteful that way.  I used a mini cupcake tin for baking. If you only have a regular-sized muffin tin, cover it in foil and finger-press the groves to fit the size of the mushrooms. I used the ziplock piping bag trick, and it worked perfectly. Half of my mushrooms I coated in italian breadcrumbs, the other half with parmesan. If you like bagel bites, coat the mushrooms with cheese! If you like a more resteraunt-style dish, coat it with breadcrumbs! Disclaimer: Breadcrumbs will come out soggy if you don't put enough on! Here is my complaints: The flavors didn't blend as well as I had hoped.  Some other friends thought it wasn't half bad. This recipe can appeal to many, but many don't like it at all. It's kind of a 50/50 thing. I would say give it a shot, but cut the recipe in half if you are making it for the first time to test it out. The recipe makes A LOT

I followed the directions exactly as far as how to prepare them, however, I grilled them instead of baking them and they turned out GREAT! Will definitely make again except next time I will probably add a meat.

It was disgusting and a disappointment. Followed the directions exactly as it was and made a special trip to the store just for this. It was foul. A waste of money and a terrible experience. I have had stuffed mushrooms many times before and this was absolutely the worst tasting I have ever had. Next time I'll just go to Olive Garden or make it the right way instead of reading some morons recipe.

These are the most amazing mushroom caps! My first time as well.  I used less cream cheese and more parm.  I also used more cayenne and put in oven for JUST 15, therefore not a lot of liquid formed.  I made them just for myself first and can see myself making these every weekend or as an appetizer during the week :) Thanks for the post!!!

I love this recipe, as is and/or with a few of the suggestions other reviewers have made. I always use more mushrooms because it makes a lot of filling. When I want to get fancy I will brush the shrooms with butter and roll the tops in breadcrumbs before baking. When I want meat, I add a yummy ground sausage. When I want healthy, I cut the cream cheese down to 1/3 and add 1/2 cup quinoa...delicious and less guilty. It has the right amount of heat with the seasoning, and is always the first plate to disappear at a party. Thanks for the recipe! I have used it for years and will for years to come.

I've made these several times and changed up the recipe different ways. I have added hot sausage to the  mix and let that cook with the stems.

I have also added chopped shrimp (raw) to the mix and let that cook in the oven.  

I almost always add chopped chives, or sweet onions to the mix for a very full flavor. This is a great base recipe to build your taste preferences on.

These things are delicious, although I did add garlic salt to the cream cheese mixture and  sprinkled some on the mushrooms as well before filling them. Also topped them off with bread crumbs and it was bomb.

To die for. Solid 5 stars from me! Used big fat juicy portobella mushrooms. 

CHANGES MADE: Used garlic and herb Philadelphia instead of regular flavour. Saute' done with real minced onion instead of adding onion powder to the stuffing. Skipped the cayenne. Served with trout filet.  My goodness it was good, husband and I both devoured these! Pity I only made two ;)

This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms.  They tasted wonderful!!  I ended up needing more than 12 mushrooms (good thing I had bought extra).  I don't care for the "after-heat" from the cayenne, so next time I'll leave that out and they will be perfect for me!

Absolutely fabulous. I made these for thanksgiving and they are now a staple,demanded by all relatives and family when ever I am invited for dinner. Great just like they are. I also have modified to just have fun with them and add to the "healthier side". Use your own taste palate. 

Additions: I added filling of 2 baked sweet potatoes, and 1 extra tbsp of diced garlic. 

Changes: olive oil ( never use vegetable oil), dipped tops of stuffed mushrooms in Parmesan cheese to cover before cooking.

We made these for a party. I had some stuffed mushrooms at a restaurant that had sausage, so I couldn't resist adding some ground Italian sausage. This filling by itself is good, so I would definitely recommend it - but it's even better if you add the sausage!

These truly are delicious!  I trimmed a sliver off the cap of the mushroom so they would sit flat on the baking sheet.  I also sprinkled with a little Parmesan before baking.  They were great to store in the fridge and reheat to eat a few with each meal.  VERY good!

Delicious!!! I made it for the dinner with my family over, everybody loved it! Everybody fought for the last mushroom! And then my sister asked for the recipe =) I skipped the garlic and added a bit of cayenne pepper to have a kick in the taste without garlicky aftertaste, it turned out great! Will make it again and again.

I checked out the other reviews & took bits and pieces. I did not use the stems (my wife & I ate them). I used a touch less cayenne and a touch more garlic. also added almost 1/2 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs......was fantastic. I will make this again. had enough to do about 35 assorted sized mushrooms.

I made these for Christmas Eve at our usual family gathering that we have every year.  I think it's a great recipe and didn't change a thing.  Sometimes you just don't need to make any changes and go with it, and that's what I did and my family loved them.  I doubled the recipe and they were all gone by the end of the evening.  I will definitely make these again!

I thought with all the reviews that it would be different, EVEN IF the ingredients were basically cream cheese... They were a little too hot (1/4t. cayenne is quite a bit of heat)- we like spicy too! I just didn't care for them. They needed bread crumbs, some crab or stuffing or just something that was missing.. A

Used small (8oz) pkg mushrooms. Chopped all stems but halved rest of recipe. (Had perfect amount for 12 mushrooms). Halved garlic, oil, onion powder, parm cheese and cream cheese. Didn't use hot spice.  Mixed in ziploc. Piped mixture in as suggested. Buttered bottom of Corning dish. Sprinkled tiny bit of plain Panco breadcrumbs over top. Added about 3T Marsala wine to bottom of dish. Baked at 350 for 15 mins and 375 for 15 mins more.

Fabulous - as voted by all party guests!  Only changes made in ingredients was to reduce amount of cream cheese by 1/3 and to use tops of green onions chopped and added raw directly to cream cheese mixture.  The cream cheese mixture was made two hours in advance of stuffing & baking, left at room temperature, then easily stuffed delicate mushroom cavities, without breakage.  Will definitely used this as my go-to appetizer in future entertaining.

I made these for a new years party and they were gone in a flash! I used half the cream cheese and added 100g of goat cheese to the filling mixture, and topped with panko crumbs. I assembled them a few hours ahead of time and then popped them in the oven as guests arrived so they'd be nice and hot half an hour into our party.  will definitely make again!!

I took these to a party and only 1/3  got eaten. I asked 2 people who I saw eat them and asked them what they thought.     Both replied that they were too spicy.   I tried one before taking them to the party and I thought the same thing.    I am a real mushroom lover too but I didn't care for this recipe. This is the 1st recipe from Allrecipes that I was disappointed with.

I found this recipe here and I make it at least once a month.  Usually I double it because they can't seem to get enough!  I pretty much follow the recipe except for using Olive Oil and reducing the amount of cayenne pepper.  Thank you for sharing this great taste!

Very good recipe!! I had never made stuffed mushrooms before, and used this recipe for my Christmas party last weekend - people loved them! Like many others, I added sausage to the mix (I used a Sage flavored Jimmy dean sausage roll), but otherwise kept the recipe the same. It is a little time consuming, but worth it!

I love mushrooms, especially fried or stuffed.  I was so excited to find this recipe, but I was let down.  The cream cheese is way too heavy as a filling.  I had too much filling to all my mushrooms even though I had more than the recipe called for.  In all, I am disappointed.

These were yummy! I would give them 5 stars but  I followed other reviewers suggestions. I added green onions to my garlic mushrooms mixture. I topped mushrooms with a mixture of melted butter, Italian bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. I took these to a Christmas party and everyone wanted the recipe. Will make these again.

I've been making these for years and they are always eaten!  A bit time consuming, but still easy.  Unfortunately it doesn't look impressive on the table when you have to feed many people.  It's perfect for a gathering of 5-6 people but not for 10-12.

I used Neufchâtel cheese, (often called 1/3rd less fat cream cheese).  I chose to have it a bit less spicy with 1/8th teaspoon black pepper and 1/8th teaspoon cayenne pepper.  Baked for 30-35 minutes,  until I saw the liquid stopped forming under the the caps.  My first batch was too juicy to serve, IMO.

I had high hopes based on all the good reviews. But we did not like these at all! The mixture was so rich – really too rich and I am a huge lover of cream cheese.  And the mushrooms really need to be prepped better – dipped in butter & lemon juice or some sherry wine before cooking or they become little wet sponges when baked.

Wowza! SO good! dipped the tops in italian breadcrumbs after filling them and yum!!!! Only thing I will try different just for curiosities sake next time is to add a little less cream cheese and add some finely diced crab meat. Either way the original recipe was well worth making and keeping

This recipe is TO DIE FOR!!  The recipe is perfect except I always end up with a lot of extra cheese-mixture.  I typically refrigerate the leftovers and quickly pop it in to mushrooms for a fancy side to a meal.  I like to sprinkle extra parmesan cheese on top.

This recipe is delicious! It has become one of our staple appetizers for parties (especially around the holidays). It has a bit of a kick to it, which we love, but for those of you who try to avoid things that are too spicy, I would recommend cutting the cayenne pepper down a bit. Prep-work is a little time consuming but well worth it.

Love the spicy kick in these. They are always gone in a flash. Best to double the recipe so everyone can have multiples. Love that they can be prepped in advance and stored in the fridge, ready to pop in the oven. It's now several years that I take these for thanksgiving and Christmas dinners because everyone loves them.

My husband absolutely loved these mushrooms and said it would be great if we could have them every night. I did cook the garlic and stems in olive oil as suggested by other reviewers. I also didn't add the cayenne because I didn't want it to have much heat. Hubby says it was perfect without the cayenne, but I think I'll add it next time.

The good news is that if you skip the part where you sauté the mushrooms & garlic, and just stuff it and bake it still turns out ok! I had made this once before,  months ago and in a mad hurry to get dinner done, I skipped the step. Woops. Still good tho, don't fret if it happens to you. I didn't have cream cheese but sour cream and still delish. Will make this again for sure & I won't worry if I forget to sauté.

Awesome mushrooms!  I added about 2 tablespoons of hidden valley ranch powdered dressing to the stuffing mix and topped them with Italian breadcrumbs at the 15 minute mark and returned to the oven for 7 more minutes. Definitely a keeper recipe!!

I made this tons since my husband goes nuts for mushrooms... The amount I make at a time is a lot, but he finishes it every time without a problem... It is one of the dishes I make for him when I want to make something nice for him...

Amazing!  I made them once and couldn't stop thinking about them afterwards.  The second time around I served them to somebody who doesn't even like mushrooms, and he enjoyed them very much as well.

I made these for a potluck and everyone loved them, they were gone pretty quick!  I did not have cayenne but besides that I followed the recipe exactly.  I'll definitely be making these again, thanks :)

Easy to prepare.  I exchanged onion powder for a homegrown shallot.  Very delicious.
Tip: melon baller works great to stuff the mushrooms.

Followed this recipe exactly as written except I didn't have 12 large mushrooms, so I used 2 8oz. containers of just regular white mushrooms. That was a perfect amount! Using 1/4 tsp of cayenne gave it more of a kick than I am used to, still really good, never had a stuffed mushroom with a kick, the hubby and I thought we could do it with maybe 1/8 tsp next time. I took an equal amount of Progresso Garlic & Herb bread crumbs and plain Panko and mixed them together and before I put the mushrooms in the oven I took each cap and dipped the tops in the breadcrumbs. Perfect crunch and flavor on top! Will definitely make this again!

Delicious!  Everybody at our little dinner party commented on them!  I wanted the look of the "crunchy" topping, so I lightly "toasted" some Panko bread crumbs in a little butter, then rolled the top of the stuffed mushrooms in the crumbs before baking.

Super tasty.  Only thing I added was a couple pieces of bacon just to add a little texture.  I'm sure they'd be great just as the recipe's written as well.

I've made this twice now, both times with no complaints; however I did add chopped scallions to the mushroom/garlic sauté and crumbled crisp bacon when mixing in the cream cheese. It will be a staple :)

I made these for a dinner party last night. My guests were in love and asked for the recipe. I did add a little Italian bread crumb and parmesan cheese(shredded) to the tops. With that change I think the tops had a parmesan crisp to the texture. I might do a little less cayenne pepper. The important thing was ...they taste phenomenal! Thanks for the recipe I will definitely do this again.  Also, I had enough stuffing to make about 20 Mushrooms.

This was amazing! I used a large container of small white mushrooms-about 30. There was extra filling. Took other reviewers advice & sprinkled parmeson over the tops before baking, They lacked color so I added paprika over the top. So good!

Made these today. Verdict:  delicious. A little kick but not much so be careful with the cayenne.  I followed the directions, only adding shredded mozzarella at the end then putting them in the broiler to brown.

These were pretty good, but the seqwsoning was a little too much for me. Also I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese. But the directions were great! They cooked well in the time given, and were not burnt.

I did not add the cayenne pepper because some of my family does not like spice (I do!!!).  It was still an absolutely fantastic recipe.  They were beyond delicious!

This was the guest favorite of my 3 appetizers. I accidentally used garlic powder instead of onion powder, but they were still good. They also kept well in the oven.

I love this recipe! I tried it today it was so tasty. Hard to eat though. Because the mushrooms (mine at least) were watery when bitten into. But the filling was just amazing. So creamy and cheesy. I wished there was more filling and less mushroom personally, and mine were filled all the way up. It was fun and easy to do (first time). Enjoy!

These mushrooms are the best.  I sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top before cooking and they were a little crusty on top.  Every time I have company, I make these.  They are a crowd pleaser.

Very good! Seemed too simple but tasted so great!!!! Dipped outside of mushroom caps in pan oil after sautéing.  Did not have parmesan so used Asiago which was awesome since stronger than parmesan.

These were delicious!  I used 2 packages of smaller mushrooms instead of 12 large ones, and I added a can of crab meat, a bit of lemon juice, and chopped green onions.  I dipped the bottom of the mushrooms in melted butter with a shot of lemon juice in it before placing in ungreased deep dish stone baker.  Sprinkled with a little more grated parmesan cheese.  Made a few hours ahead of time and baked right before serving.

I really loved this recipe I made it today but instead of onion powder I actually added minced onion and I also added spinach to the cream cheese mixture and it was delicious:)I also put the cream cheese mixture in a ziplock bag like others suggested, and it was fantastically easy compared to the spoon:) I will for sure be making these again!!

Very yummy, but I love mushrooms, not sure if non-mushroom folks would like it as much. I expected it to have a bit more of a kick, so next time I'll try using a tad more cayenne pepper.

This recipe is delicious! I followed the recipe except for omitting the onion powder and the cayenne pepper, and adding instead crushed red pepper. I also added a bit more parmesan cheese. At first I was worried because my chopped mushroom stems and garlic's moisture didn't go away, but I just drained it, and it came out fine. Because my mushrooms were small, I have a lot of leftover filling, which I plan to use with other vegetables. :)

I saw someone's positive comments for this in the reviews section of "the buzz" so I thought I'd give it a try.  Boy I'm glad I did!  Tasty which is a little surprising given how few ingredients there are.  Added panko breadcrumbs on the top and broiled to try to brown them a little.

The recipe was okay. The cream cheese mix (which I added cilantro to) tasted really good. It would have been a great spread for crackers. I wish, however, that there were more filling and less cream cheese. It was a bit too creamy. I also added bread crumbs to the top of the mushrooms and it added a lovely level of crispiness!

Definitely give this recipe a try, but use a bit less cream cheese and a bit more filling. Find something fun and creative to add to the recipe to give it flavor!

I made this on a whim and don't regret a second of it. It was easy to make, and came out flawlessly. I don't like tweaking recipes on the first try, but I added a few chopped jalapeno peppers because I had a taste for some heat. Still very good overall.

We thought these mushrooms were very good. We had a lot of extra filling though, so we ended up stuffing way more than 12 mushrooms. I broiled them for the last minute of cooking and put a little extra Parmesan cheese on top of each one. We served them for the Super Bowl, and they were definitely a hit. My husband said he would like some sort of meat added to the filling - crabmeat, cooked sausage, or bacon would all be fantastic additions, and we'll try adding one of those next time we make these.

Pretty good. I used 1 lb of baby bellas and only used half the filling. (Even so, I thought there was WAY too much filling in the mushrooms.) If I made them again, I would only make half or a third the amount of filling, and definitely wouldn't fill them very full. I normally love garlic, but 1 Tbsp was too much - they were very garlicky. I would recommend only using 1-2 cloves. I will probably try another recipe next time.

These must have been delicious because I ate them all. Easy recipe and yummy. Made so much filling that I actually had some leftover and grabbed more mushrooms so I could fill them too. Spice gives it a it nice little bite, and who can complain about cream cheese? Yum.

I love this recipe!  I loved the mushroom filling so much I went ahead and converted into a mushroom dip just by adding cut mushrooms instead of the stems. It's been a hit every time! Eat it with chips and you have a whole new dish!

Super good! I added some bread crumbs on top just for the crunch. I also used portabella mushrooms because I love their meaty flavor. I will use this recipe again for sure!!

Very different as far as stuffed mushrooms go, but delicious!  I could almost eat the filling by itself, but it's epic with the mushrooms!

Wow this is one of my new favorite recipes and I wish I would have found it sooner.  Added Crab to the stuffing and it was just amazing.  Even the kids were gobbling them up.

Loved these. Based on recommendations, I used 2/3 of the cream cheese and added three strips of previously cooked crumbled bacon. Omitted onion powder and instead sautéed about a third of an onion with the mushrooms. The cayenne gives it such a nice zip! I can't understand the comments about the mushrooms rolling around. I used button mushrooms and they stayed well in place during cooking. Will definitely make these again.

This was a winner!  
All I had was sliced mushrooms so I made the recipe as was using the sliced mushrooms as you would the stems chopped. Then I proceeded  only putting mixture in a shallow pan and baking. The results were great.

Excellent. A hit at the New Year's Eve Party.  The filling made more than 12 mushrooms and that was wonderful.  As per other reviewer's suggestions, I dipped the mushroom caps in butter before baking.

My family loved them. I don't eat mushrooms (the smell is off-putting to me) so I made this for them. Instead of Parm I added a 1/4c of creamy Swiss. They seemed a bit slimy to me but apparently were not perceived that way to others. Still, I dusted them with some breadcrumbs to give it a little more finished look. 
Thanks!

It was even better than I anticipated. I like stuffed mushrooms with a little bit of crunch, so I sprinkled bread crumbs on top of the parmesan chese. A little bit of paprika added some color. I discovered that a toddler sized spoon is nicely sized for stuffing the cream cheese into the mushroom caps.

Absolutely delicious. The family loves it. I make it according to the directions. The food processor made dicing the stems a breeze. I may try some of the other suggestions but really don't want to mess up a good thing.

These are amazing! I made 8 (fairly large) portabella mushrooms, and found the amount of cream cheese to be very excessive. I only used 1/4 of the package, and probably could have gotten away with using even less. I added 3 tbsp of chopped fresh spinach and 1 tbsp of minced yellow onion to the mushroom/garlic mixture while it was cooking. I left the heat on very low while I stirred in the cream cheese to make it easier to mix. This is a great recipe and very versatile! Thanks.

Recipe works great and the stuffing can be made ahead.  Make sure to pat dry the mushrooms after cleaning; they're already full of moisture.

I printed this out and doubled the recipe as some had suggested, and bought spinach as others had said.  Didn't see it mentioned anywhere what a pain it is to get out and dice up mushroom stems.  My husband ended up doing the last 12 of them for me.  And we were not making tiny pieces.  We were just dicing. We definitely did not have to double the 10 oz. of spinach or the 8 oz of cream cheese. We stopped before we put in the 2nd cream cheese and 1/2'd the mushroom stems, garlic, parmesan cheese, and spinach mixture before we filled the mushrooms.  Needless to say I have some spinach, mushroom stem, garlic mixture to give him for dinner some night.
I have learned my lesson and I will be reading recipes much more diligently from now on.  And I will, God-willing, never make this recipe again.

These are good but a little too spicy for my liking. I would cut back on the cayenne pepper if I make these again. Also, I think the consistency was not what I had in mind. I was looking for something with more crunch I guess. The cream cheese, of course, makes it very soft.

WOW! Made these tonight for a Christmas gathering, sure the prep takes a bit but well worth it. I took some bits of info from other reviews and I ended with 55 small ( not button) mushrooms and still have filling left over. I added bacon to the garlic/stem mix, did what some said and put the garlic, cream cheese, parm all in a ziplock and mashed together that way. Less mess! Also did half with the butter/lemon dip before you fill and what a difference that makes for eye appeal. DO the butter/lemon dip its makes them look so much better. Everyone loved them! Thanks for a great appetizer!

I made these mushrooms as an appetizer for football night and they were a huge hit! Since then my family has requested them several times! Delicious!

I just made these and there great! My friend who doesn't even like mushrooms ate some. I did however change a few things. I just micro-grated the garlic and put it straight in.

Great recipe. Easy to make and people really enjoy them. Great for any occassion really...only suggestion I have is to try to keep them a little warm (warming tray maybe) they just dont taste as good when they cool down.

The hardest part about making these mushrooms is making enough.  They are always the first thing gone when I have an appetizer party. The second most difficult part is getting the cooked garlic smell out of my house before the guests arrive.  I will try the "make ahead method" someone outlined in their review to minimize the scent.

I thought this recipe was pretty good! I love the flovor but I like more intense flavors so i like to spice things up! In some i would add little chopped jalapenos and then put parmesan cheease on top. I like to make some more rich so i put butter on the bottom of the mushroom when I make them. it also take good if you add bacon bits or peppers!

I made these the other night for a snack during a movie. They were pretty good, but they didn't match up to others i've had in the past. I'm still on the lookout for the perfect stuffed mushroom. I found the cheese was sort of grainy in the cream cheese mixture and the weird sensation was a big factor why we weren't huge fans - thus might have been due to the brand of parmesan we bought though.

This is a great recipe! Unlike the other stuffed mushrooms I've tried in the past, these were moist, flavorful, and overall, super tasty!!! This recipe is not really time consuming and the mushrooms bake rather quickly.  My hubby and kids loved them so I defiantly will be making these again =)!! P.S.- be sure to add a dash of kosher salt at the end

These are delicious.  However, I substitute the onion powder for regular, chopped onions.  You're going to want to double (or triple!) the recipe when you make these because they go FAST.

Made exactly as stated and although I am not a mushroom eater - I made these for a Memorial Day get together.  My cousin also made stuffed mushrooms but the more traditional way with breadcrumbs and these were just a bit "wet".  I will try again and maybe sprinkle some breadcrumb or panko crumbs on top.

Great mushroom recipe if you like cream cheese :)  Made them for a dinner party and everyone loved them.  I made exactly as the recipe said and yes you have a lot of filling left over.  I did put these under the broiler for 5 minutes before serving so the tops were a little crispy but a big hit, thank you

Excellent recipe!! I have only identified stuffed mushrooms with shrimp or crab. This is a nice change. Once the mixture was done, I realized I could have added chopped artichoke hearts. Next time. I did add some gorgonzola crumbles for a twist. Yum. Also this mixture with some added chopped artichoke hearts will make a nice hot cheese dip!! Yum!! Next time. I will be adding this recipe to my recipe box for future events! Thank You!!!

YUM! This was delicious and easy too make. It was a little time consuming, but oh so worth it! The only changes I made was I used olive oil instead of veggie oil and I diced up some onion really fine as I didnt have onion powder on hand.I also used a mix of shreeded cheeses as that is what i had. I really liked the combination of the cayenne and cream cheese. I will make this again VERY soon! Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loves it. The mushroom shrink quite a bit, they become tiny yummy appetizer. You can also top it with shredded cheese.

My son loved these.  To cut the heat, I only used 1/2 the amount of black pepper and cayenne pepper.  I used an 8 oz. package of mushrooms (with more than 12 mushrooms), but had 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture left over, so next time will either use more or larger mushrooms or 1/2 the recipe.  This was quick, easy, and economical to make!

I've made these several times and everyone loves them. I always make 20/25 mushrooms and only use half cream cheese package and I add bacon to the mixture. I top mushrooms with a mix of panko and the parmesan cheese that the recipe calls for, and brush a little melted butter on top (it keeps them from drying up). 
Lastly place them on the mini muffin pan previously sprayed with cooking spray.  
Negative: A little time consuming so clean mushrooms and prepare stuffing a day or 2 before you need it.

Made these for New Years Eve and was shocked at how easy they were.  The filling makes alot but I only used one package of Bella mushrooms.  These were absolutely fabulous and because of the cayenne pepper they have a bit of a kick.  There was none left over!!!

I needed to put together a menu for an impromptu party at my house and this appetizer was perfect!  I already had all of the ingredients at home. I chopped up a few extra mushrooms to add more mushroom to the filling and added a little garlic powder. They were so easy to make!  My guests loved them.  Delicious, thank you!

They were okay but don't be fooled by 2000 good reviews. The taste is bland. The filling isn't as flavorful as you would expect it to be. The recipe calls for no salt but its one ingredient it really needs. All you taste is a watery mushroom with a thick tasteless topping. honestly, go to the next recipe.

I didn't have any cayenne so made them without. I used 18 mushrooms, 8 oz lite cream cheese that's all I had,  abt. 1/4 cup chopped scallions, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 cup parmesan, and the black pepper and mushroom stems. I sauteed as instructed, and they came out great.  Next time I will get the cayenne for a little zip.

Amazing! I make them with and without the cayenne pepper. Some of my family doesn't like the heat, either way they taste great. Also i used shredded parm it had a more melted cheese texture to it.

I made these for the first time for a surprise party I was hosting.  Looking at past reviews I did add crab meat and sprinked top with shredded Parm cheese.  I even cooked stems in half Olive oil and half butter for more flavor.   The reviews were "to die for" and "I haven't had these since I ate at (restuarant)" .    I am making them today for my daughters family birthday party tomorrow and love the convenience of being able to make them ahead of time and pop them in the oven before everyone arrives!   Easy, quick and a variety of possibilities to change the flavor by adding different ingredients such as crab, sausage, bacon, ham, etc.   Thank you so much for posting this recipe, it will be a staple at all my parties!

My only recomendation... triple the recipe! I made these for a picnic, prepared them ahead of time, and cooked them on a grill in a disposable pan. Most of them were gone before I even got them off of the grill!

My guests really enjoyed them. The filling makes enough for 14-16 mushroom caps depending on size of cap. If they are all small maybe 18-20

This was good, if you like mushrooms. I do think it needed a little less cream cheese and I might use less cayenne next time as well, I may even add some meat of some kind to it. Oh and I used sm to md mushrooms.

These were great, next time I prepare them I will add some very finely diced celery, and use 3/4 the cream cheese.  Also would be very tasty with bacon crumbled on top!

I am not a mushroom eater but I tried to find a recipe to make stuffed mushrooms from my sister-in-law and husband who loved them. I did a simple google search and it brought me to this recipe. I'm so glad it did! I tried it myself and LOVED the stuffing! My family loved it too! I will be making it again in the future. 

The only thing I did that the recipe did not say was sprinkle more parmesan cheese on top before putting it in the oven and then I broiled them for a few minutes to give them a little bit of color. Great recipe!

These were by far the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever eaten and they only took a few minutes to assemble.  I got the Allouette garlic & herb cream cheese instead of plain and omitted the onion powder and cayenne pepper.  They turned out beautiful as well -- as pretty as I've ever gotten in a restaurant.  One of my guests asked if I had some horseradish sauce to dip them in.  That really seemed to enhance the taste.

Discovered this recipe several years ago and now this is my go to for stuffed mushrooms. We eat them pretty regularly. People always compliment me on how good they are. I usually stick exactly to the recipe (accept the cayenne depending on how much spice I'm feeling I adjust) but a few times I've made edits if I didn't have enough cream cheese. Once I used 3/4, 1/4 cup goat cheese and 1/4 Italian blend and it was delicious!  Love these so much!!

Absolutely delectable and gobbled up in minutes!  I was able to fill about 24 Baby Belle mushrooms (large and small caps) with the mix and still had about a 1/4 cup left over.  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil, only added in 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper and added in about a 1/2 cup of finely chopped onions and about 3/4 cup finely chopped cooked bacon.  Oh, let me say the bacon adds a DIVINE flavor that really went well with the cheese.  Next time I intend to do the same changes I referenced above but will also sprinkle them with Parmesan cheese when the cooking time is done, put them back in under the broiler for about 5 minutes and they should taste even better!

So rich & creamy! I did a mix of larger & smaller mushrooms. Definitely have to stick with the smaller mushrooms next time, as the filling is too much richness for the larger ones. I also added Italian bread crumbs on top, & they were delicious!!!!

Fantastic recipe.  I also added some bacon for smokiness and red pepper flakes when sauteing the mushroom caps. This recipe does make too much stuffing for the caps, so buy extra mushrooms to stuff. The stuffing also worked great when wrapped in store bought crescent roll dough and sliced about 1/2" thick.

I don't write many reviews but these are just AMAZING. I didn't even measure anything, just eyeballed it..still turned out fabulous. They were all gone in minutes. Even people who normally don't like mushrooms were raving about these. I did add some finely chopped onion while sautéing, as someone else suggested. I highly recommend doing that.

This is by far my FAVORITE recipe for Stuffed Mushrooms.  Although when I make it I have more filling than mushrooms.  I will be making these for Christmas this year.  Whenever I make them my husband and I eat the entire tray ourselves!  Yes, they are THAT good!!!

These were a huge hit!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and Chipotle pepper instead of Cayenne.  I will definitely be making these again.

These were a huge hit at a potluck I attended this past weekend. Made a few slight adjustments. I added 1 tbls of finely chopped onion to the garlic amd mushroom stems. I also used a little less cream cheese and added 1/4 cup of panko bread crumbs. SO GOOD. These will be making a reappearance as a Christmas day appetizer.

These Mushrooms truly were mouth-watering. I made them for an appetizer on Thanksgiving, they were gone in minutes everyone loved them. I think next time I might mix in a little sausage or ground turkey.

Made these per the recipe, with the minor exception that I used some finely chopped sweet onion instead of the onion powder, which I sauteed with the garlic.  I also wrapped each one with a half of a strip of bacon that I partially microwaved to remove some of the grease and give it a "head start".  My choice of mushroom was criminy.  They were EXCELLENT!!!  The only thing I will do differently next time is to either use a thicker cut of bacon, or use the whole strip on each one.  Oh and for 20 mushrooms, an 8 oz package of cream cheese made at least twice as much filling as I needed.  So I might try to scale that back to using a 4 ounce package next time.  But overall, a great recipe!  As others mentioned, do yourself a huge favor and get your Parmesan from the gourmet cheese section of the supermarket and grate it yourself.  The stuff in the green can is OK in a pinch or for convenience for spaghetti and pizza, but your recipes will definitely come out better with freshly grated Parmesan.

I didn't actually eat these because I dont' like mushrooms but I made them for my fiance and he couldn't stop eating them.  He ate half of them in one serving because he liked them so much.  I followed the recipe exactly and they got great reviews!  Super easy to make also.

A friend of mine requested that I make something as an appetizer for her stag and doe baby shower.  I didn't want to make the usual spinach dip, so I started searching through Allrecipes.com.  This recipe was such a hit!  After reading the instructions, I thought they would be more difficult than they were.  I did add Parmesan cheese to the top as one person had suggested (shredded) and bake them.  I had to bake about 4 hours before they were served and we simple put them back in the over for another 10 minutes and it did not impede the taste.  Thanks for an amazing recipe!

These are so good. I love that there is no meat in the recipe. I didn't find it took that long to make, just give yourself time, not something you can just whip up quickly. Great side addition to lasagna or spaghetti. My husband devoured these in seconds which surprised me since he isn't a huge mushroom lover.

Love, love, love these!  I added a little celery to the pan to saute to give a little crunch. Added a little more cayenne pepper than called for, which made them spicy and oh, so good!  I think next time i would spray the mushroom's sides with some ICBINB to moisten them up a tad. Great recipe; thanks!

We use real onions (not powder) and extra cayanne for some kick and we use whatever cheese is cheap (parm/asiago etc) - they do not stay on the plate for long!

You'll want to double the recipe, as folks can't get enough of these delicious little morsels.  I add ginger and sweet red peppers to the minced ingredients, also fresh parsley and cilantro, since we are fans.   So many compliments!

We really enjoyed this easy to make dish. I added some ginger to the mushroom mixture and used sesame oil.  Very tasty. I like that there were no bread crumbs. I can see how this basic recipe can easily be adapted to what's on hand.

Absolutely delicious! This is the only recipe that I now use for stuffed mushrooms. Hubby and I love these things and can't get enough. I hollow out my mushrooms to allow for all the mixture to be used and to get a lot of the stuffing in there. I use powdered (1 tsp garlic) instead of fresh and this fills exactly 16 medium sized mushrooms every time.
Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Delicious! I made too much filling, but it goes great on crackers, or I just got more mushrooms, filled and baked for a second round. Yum!

I've made these mushrooms at least a dozen times and have been asked for the recipe every single time.  I don't change a thing except I now double the batch.  And I always use baby bella mushrooms (portabella).

I used the cream cheese and parmesan cheese and added finely chopped onion and garlic, chopped prosciutto, some ground up herbed croutons (or stuffing) and sauteed mushroom stalks.  I mixed it all together in a baggy and then cut the end off to fill the caps.  I topped it all of with a dallop of butter and slid them in the oven at 350.  Baked about 20 minutes.  I used the larger sized caps and made six of them!  They were delicious!  Yum!

These were a hit at my last party - very tasty and vegetarian friendly. I kept mine warm in the crockpot on low, but be warned you will have to drain the water out occasionally. These guys give off a lot of juice. If you have a large enough crock pot, you could put a cookie-cooling rack in the bottom, then put the mushrooms on top to avoid them drowning. Otherwise, good straight from the oven or even room temp.

I cooked these up added green onions and red pepper instead of cayenne they are fabulous. Everyone raved about them. I feel I can add any ingredients to the basics and they will be great.

Super quick and very easy to make.  I put the cream cheese in while the mixture was still very warm and it made it much creamier than waiting.  I also followed a few suggestions and piped it into the caps with a ziploc bag and topped them with a little extra greated Parm cheese.  So yummy!

I made a double batch of this recipe. I only added the required amount of Cayenne pepper for 1 batch. It was perfect. Just a little kick without being overpowering. They were gone in no time when I brought them to a party.

I made these mushrooms and followed the recipe exactly excpet instead of just parmesan cheese I used the Kraft cheese mixture of parmesan, asiago and romano. I had 13 mushrooms and there was enough filling left over for 5 more. But it was really good overall!

Simply FABULOUS palate pleasing profile!  Great for the increasing number of people who are vegetarians who also eat gluten free.  Love, love, love the kick from the cayenne pepper.  We will make these time and again!

These were okay. A bit too creamy for my taste. I had a rough time blending the cream cheese even though I did leave it out to come up to room temp. I prefere my old standard recipe for stuffed mushrooms, parmesan cheese, italian breadcrumbs & olive oil.

I made theses for my guy on new years.. he ate 8 of the 12 and promptly fell asleep ha! he loved them! I added a little panko to the tops and put them under the broiler for a min to crisp them up.. I thought they were a little too rich but very good.

My husband LOVES mushrooms and these did NOT disappoint!  I cut the cream cheese in 1/2 and used 24 mushrooms.  Read reviews, flattening tops (bottoms) of mushrooms,  dipped caps in melted butter then topped with panco crumbs.  Will make them again tomorrow afternoon for new years dinner.

these were good but used the XL mushrooms (9) and think it would have been much better with smaller mushrooms and have some kind of meat in them like crab or sausage.  I will make again but will put some green onion and a meat in them

Love it!! I did'nt have any onion powder so I used onion flakes. Also when I was done stuffing the mushrooms I rolled them in parmesan cheese then baked. They turned out great I will make these again!!!! :)

These were delicious!  I had leftover sausage that I made for stuffing and added the smaller crumbly pieces to the mix (cooked!) and all the guests enjoyed them.  I will definitely make them again.  I'm half-tempted to mix in some bread crumbs to see what that might be like but no matter - they are delicious just the way the recipe reads.  Thanks Angie!

I don't like mushrooms, so I did not try these.  But my husband loves mushrooms and ate all 12 that I made, saying after everyone - man, these are good mushrooms.  I did add a little cooked bacon to the top of the filling and sprinkled with some bread crumbs.  I am going to trust his opinion that these are some good mushrooms.

Being the day before Thanksgiving, we opted making this recipe with some healthier substitutions!!  Instead of using cream cheese, use a dollop or two of daisy with 2 TBSP's of Italian breadcrumbs after the mushroom mixture cools. Also did not use minced garlic and used a tablespoon of garlic powder!  Great flexible mushroom recipe!

I have made this recipe about 5 times and have passed it along to many others who have requested it. These are AMAZING! I have followed the recipe to the T and I would never change a thing. My boyfriend HATES mushrooms but because he loves cheese he tried them and now I make them for him all the time. This recipe will be one that I pass down to my own family one day!

I made this as a Cabernet Sauvignon appetizer pairing for a wine gathering.  Everyone raved about this dish and loved it but I couldn't get past the heavy pepper taste (I chose to use fresh ground peppercorns).  Next time, I'll stick to regular black pepper!  I also found the texture of the filling a bit too heavy.  I could play with this recipe a little but it is a great start and others really enjoyed it!

My family loved this recipe!  I made a few changes.  I did add 6ozs of lump crab meat.  I did the season bread crumb topping with butter and grated Parmesan, which I didn't like.  So, I will use crushed Ritz cracker topping next time or just grated Parmesan.

Yum! This was a big hit. Followed the recipe, but added roasted red pepper (I had used it in a previous mushroom recipe and it was delicious). I ended up with TONS of leftover filling, though, so next time will double the amount of mushrooms. I totally agree with other reviewers - keep your mushrooms on the small side (1" - 1 1/4" diameter), this helps to get the right ratio between mushroom and filling.

I made these as an appetizer. I felt they were too salty. I would say to use more mushrooms, I used 12 "large stuffing mushrooms" and I really had to overfill them to use all the mixture. This probably contributed to the extreme taste. I will say the cayenne pepper is a nice kick though. Will be trying a new recipe next time however, nowhere near restaurant style stuffed mushrooms in my opinion.

Delicious! I only used 1/2 of the cream cheese though, and it was still plenty. These are sooo easy and make a wonderful vegetarian dinner when served with a green salad and warm rolls!

These are a huge hit with my co-workers and friends.... If you like different variations of things try using chive and onion cream cheese and adding jalapenos as well (with or w/o membrane and seeds)......

I kept eating so much of the filling while stuffing the mushrooms that I barely had any left lol. Sooooo good. I didn't have enough mushrooms because they were sitting too long in the fridge and I could only salvage half. So, mine were double stuffed!!! :) Hubby and I loved them. Will make again and again and again!!

Easy recipe and delicious, however...I used half the cayenne and it was plenty hot enough.  Also, you need bread crumbs on top to make it a little crispy!!  Finally, we used only 1/5th the cream cheese and it was fine!!  Don't waste 8 oz of cream cheese, it might overpower everything else.

I love, love, love this recipe!!   I have only given it 4 stars because the given quantity of ingredients for the filling results in way too much left-overs.    To make 12 mushrooms, i diced only 6 of the stems, and then used 1/4 of the remaining ingredients.   This made the perfect amount of filling for 12.   I also sprinkled the tops with freshly grated parmesan cheese for the last couple minutes of baking.   Will make again and again!!

This recipe is by far the best I own. It is such a crowd pleaser. These vanish from the plate within minutes. I double the stuffing and add cayenne pepper for a nice kick to it. I also add green onions for crunch and decoration.

These were absolutely AMAZING!  I did add some crab meat to the mixture and it was awesome! This is my first time making stuffed mushrooms, and I will make them again!  I also followed the advice of another member and used a ziplock bag to put the stuffing into each mushroom!  I did brush the caps with some butter just prior to cooking, and the were delicious!  Great recipe!!!

Super yummy, much better than a previous recipe I had tried.  I added bacon, onion, worches. sauce and crab meat to mine as well as some extra cheese on top.  Made so much extra (probably the crab) that I stuffed the leftovers into a big bell pepper and served as dip! Very delicious! Will definitely make again.

This is a good enough base to start out with. As is, the recipe is tasty but the second time I made it I took some suggestions from others. First, I doubled the amount of mushrooms or you could only make half of the filling. I like to add either a small amount of sausage or bacon to my mushrooms, one at a time works really well. I topped mine with parmesan the first time and bread crumbs the second both tasted good.

These tasted great!  Everyone loved them!  I brushed them with melted butter and sprinkled them with breadcrumbs as many other reviewers suggested.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and the filling was still very rich and creamy.  Also, I used more than 12 mushrooms because there was so much filling.  I didn't count but I probably used about 24.

These are fantastic!  I do make a few small changes.  I like to add a can of crab meat to the mixture, and I also add a handful of breadcrumbs, because I like the mixture to be thicker, and I find it to be sort of runny without them.  After I fill the mushroom caps, I sprinkle breadcrumbs on top so that they turn golden brown.

This recipe is so simple, the ingredients are things that most kitchen lovers have on hand.  I used white pepper and a little extra cayenne to give it some heat but this recipe is easy AND delicious.  Thanks Angie for posting!!

I've made these twice for parties and they are always a huge hit! :) They are delicious and tasty. Everyone who likes mushrooms (and even those that don't!) will enjoy!

These mushrooms were really amazing.  I took them into work and 3 of us ate the entire thing.  They all said these were the best stuffed mushrooms they ever had.  Everyone thinks I can cook so well just because of this recipe.  It is a little time consuming especially the first time, but you get the hang of it along the way.

Theses were really excellent.  I made some changes suggested by other reviewers, and some of my own.  I used 4 ounces of neufchatel cheese, sauteed the mushroom stems alone and added the garlic and some green onions at the end. I also sprinkled the tops with some panko and parmesan.  I am a recent mushroom convert and LOVE these.

OK... we found a couple solutions to previously displeased people. For those who found the recipe overpowering with cheese, sour, mushy or greasy.  We cooked these with half the cream cheese.  Used chive flavored soft cream cheese. Baked on a rack with a pan underneath.  Keeping them crispy!   A little ground beef really makes them pop!  Much, much better!! Awesome!

These were excellent!  I omitted the cayenne pepper and added bacon bits.  I served them at my graduation party and they were all gone in about 10 min!  I will definitely make them over and over again!!  I was a little worried though; I had to make them about 5 hours prior to my party but I baked them, put them in a dish (slightly covered) and placed them in the microwave.  Then I just warmed them up prior to everyone coming over and they were still GREAT! I did end up with too much filling but I just put more on/in the mushrooms.  Next time I’ll just use a little less cheese.

I made these as is and it was good.  I also made it with Jimmy Dean sausage and it was AWESOME!!!  I used the Jimmy Dean sausage in a tube and crumbled it up while it cooked then added it to the cream cheese and ommited the parm.  It was way better this way!

This was such an easy recipe. And the best part is that I already had all the ingredients in my pantry. My husband had it as a midnight snack and he woke me up to tell me it was "off the hook."

These were a big hit at my graduation party.  I did omit the sauteed garlic and mushroom stems to save time (although I added fresh minced garlic).  Without this step, it took about ten minutes to whip up the filling, 10 minutes to stuff 4 boxes of button mushrooms and 25 minutes to bake.  It'd probably be much more authentic (and attractive) if they were sauteed in olive oil, however, on taste alone, these were pretty good.

These mushrooms were definitely mouth-watering! I made these as part of our 5 course mother's day dinner. Made as is with the exception of the addition of crabmeat...it was a hit!  Will definitely be making again and again.

I'm on a strict low-carb diet due to my diabetes acting up during this pregnancy, so anything so filling with so few carbs is awesome. My only complaint was the strong garlic flavor, but I'll just cut back next time.

these are very yummy!!.. i didn't find them hard to make although I did make a few changes.. I used large portabello, added zucchini, tomato and red pepper -all finely chopped and i added a spoonful of sour cream and minced garlic. I broiled them at the end with parmesan cheese to get a nice golden brown colour on top. .. next time i'd even add ground beef or even spinach and feta cheese

Delicious and easy to make. It does make about 24 small mushrooms. I used 15 or so minced stems, added green onion. I followed other suggestions and used a ziplock back with the corner cut off. Definitely a keeper.

Unbelievably easy and excellent taste - We loved the spice from the Cayenne pepper.  I made the following MINOR changes.  1/2 T oil, and I topped the caps with finely grated cheddar cheese.

We did these on the BBQ and they were delicious... I had never made stuffed mushrooms before but it was really easy...Hint... To remove the stems you just have to pull on them.. I didn't know that beforehand! :)

Very creamy and delicious.  Next time, I will double the amount of mushrooms.  I had a lot of filling and piled on top of each mushroom, making the cream cheese filling overpowering.

These were outstanding! I followed the recipe for half (I doubled the recipe) and added smoked cheddar to the bottom of one half; my family and I couldn't even tell which had the cheddar and which didn't so I'll probably skip it next time. Oh, I did dip each mushroom in butter before baking because after reading reviews, I was afraid that they would dry up. (I doubt that they would)  I haven't had stuffed mushrooms in about twenty years because most places sell them with bacon; I was a little skeptical to try them but I ABSOLUTELY loved them! (Not a mushroom fan but I want to add more and new tastes to my palette.) These were so good that I can hardly wait to make them again! And my picky, picky kids loved them as well!  My husband suggests using white wine on the bottom of the pan while baking but since I didn't have any on hand I said I would try it next time. I loved them as is but will try them with the white wine next time and post here on how it turns out. Thanks for a great recipe!!


Quick Edit: I tried the wine the next time (a local Hawaiian Pineapple white wine) and the mushrooms did not absorb any of the liquid so I will suggest not using it but instead serving some wine along with the mushrooms. :)

I made these last night and we thought they were excellent. I did add a finely chopped green onion to the mushroom-garlic mix. I will definitely make these again.

These babies went like hotcakes at my family potluck! They were delicious! I did make two changes to the recipe - I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/8 tsp from 1/4 tsp only because I knew the majority of people I was making these for would have an issue with the heat and I also added 2 tbsp shredded Asiago cheese to the mixture (because I LOVE Asiago).

I've taken these mushrooms everywhere-- parties, family get togethers, and they are the rave everywhere we take them.  I like them a bit hotter, so add just a pinch more cayenne.  Stuffed mushrooms just don't get much better than this.

I was making these for a small get-together and due to grocery-goer error (my father) I somehow ended up with a package of large portobello mushrooms and a package of sliced white mushrooms. Since it was a small get-together, I improvised and minced about 1/2 of the mushroom slices along with the stems of the portobellos and mixed as per the directions and stuffed the portobello caps, which made the filling the perfect amount. I then topped with italian style bread crumbs and some melted butter and cooked for about 30 minutes. Then I cut them into fourths and served them that way. I would lessen the cayenne in the future, though that's just personal preference. I'll definitely be making these again, though with mini portobello caps, but keep the amount of minced mushroom the same as I liked the bulk and flavour of them in the mix.

I recently tried this instead of my usual way of making them and they were a huge it.  Even my son loved them and he doesn't usually eat mushrooms.  I made them exactly as stated.  Thanks for the recipe!

Seriously, sinfully good. These things will make you fall off the diet wagon. If you like cream cheese and mushrooms, these are for you. I like to toss in green onions and sprinkle a little more parm on top. My boyfriend will eat a dozen in one sitting if I let him. While this is one of my favorite things to eat ever, my sister said she took one bite and didn't care for it. I was baffled by the bad reviews, but you can't please everyone (not even people with very odd taste ;) ) 5 stars! Thanks for this great recipe. I'll be making these for years to come.

Edited to ask this question:
How long do you think you can keep this in the fridge.  I added canned crab and made it 2 days ago, would love to stuff some more mushrooms


I use herb and garlic cream cheese and a can of crab.  My husband absolutely loves these and is satisfied to eat just them for his supper!  The other reviewers are correct in that there is lots of the filling left over after filling the 12 mushrooms caps.  I might try it  next time with 2/3 or just 1/2 of the cream cheese.

OMG! I planned on making these for a party and did my trial run last night. I'm thinking about skipping dinner and making these little morsals my meal :) They were mouthwatering. I didn't change a thing in the recipe and couldn't imagine how to make this recipe any better. I loved the bit of spice from the cayenne.

These were really good, although the actual mushrooms seemed a little bland.  Next time I might toss them with salt, pepper, olive oil, and parmesan prior to filling.  I think that will help them brown nicely, too.  The filling was amazing and the only changes I made were adding chopped onion to the saute (instead of the onion powder) and a dash or two of worcestershire.  Yummy!

I made these mushrooms for the first time tonight for dinner, and they were amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I used baby portobello mushrooms.  I'd recommend this to anyone, and I really appreciate it!

Delicious!  I used '1/3 less fat' cream cheese and also cut down on amount of it I used ( I think I used about 6 ounces) and it tasted very good.  Like a lot of the other reviewers, I also added chives to the filling.

Oh so yummy! I have made these with and without sausage and both times they are delicous! A great recipe that you can premake and then pop in the oven when needed. Keeper!

With a few modifications, these are some of the best stuffed mushrooms I've eaten. I added a small (6 oz) can of minced clams (drained well) and 2 TBSP butter to the stems and garlic when browning. I also subbed out 4 oz of cream cheese and 4 oz goat cheese. I increased the garlic by 1/2 and went light on the cayenne. I used a Parmesan/Romano blend because that's what I had handy. Delicious! Tip: Cook stuffed mushrooms in a muffin pan to keep them sitting up straight. :)

OMG these are SO SO SO good!  I couldn't believe it!  I could eat just the filling it is so good!  I think without the mushrooms this would also be a great dip!  I added a can of bumblebee canned crab and it made them even better!  My 16 yr old daughter who HATES and refuses to eat mushrooms inhaled these, she couldn't believe she was eating and actually liking a mushroom!  Thanks Angie for this awesome recipe!

I wanted to love these, but just didn't care for them.  I love mushrooms prepared all different ways, but the texture of these mushrooms just bothered me.  The filling was good.  I plan to finely dice more mushroom to add to the filling and fill little pastry cups.

After trying the original recipe and taking a look at some of the other reviews on here, I would DEFINITELY go with 2/3 or 1/2 the amount of cream cheese, OR smaller mushrooms.   The cream cheese can just be overwhelming in (lack of) taste and texture if you go with the original. I would also at least double the amount of parmesan, and pop some worchestershire in with the garlic and spice mix to get those two flavors going.  This is a great recipe if you have a balance of flavors, but as I mentioned before, the cream cheese is just overwhelming (not to mention a little hard to clean up after if you melt or whip it)!

So far my favorite stuffed mushroom recipe.  Made for the 1st time 6 months ago-I still have people asking for the recipe.  I would recommend more mushrooms though, had a huge quantity of the stuffing leftover.

Yum-O!!!  I had to stop myself from gobbling these tasty treats up before my guests arrived.  Defiantly better with baby portabella mushrooms, the plain white ones just don't do it justice.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was easy and it was yummy.  I made these on New Year's eve to take to a small gathering.  Everyone loved them.  I added about 1/2 tsp of thyme to the cheese mixture and did not add any seafood (although they would have been delicious with seafood). I sprinkled some breadcrumbs and paprkia on the top along with some parmasean. The hostess popped these in the oven when I arrived.  They didn't last long!

Always delicious!  Used 1/2 amount of cream cheese the second time around, they ended up a lot less greasy.

Phenomenal.  My favorite stuffed mushroom recipe so far!  I add bread crumbs to my stuffing just until thick and I top with mozzarella cheese.

Just served this at a NYE party. Great finger-food! Burst of flavor in every bite.  I used 3 packages of 10oz small white mushrooms(33 pieces total) and doubled the filling but had plenty of leftover filling.  Don't need to double next time.  Will try with chopped sausage.

These were a hit! I doubled the recipe to make 24, but only used about half of the mushroom stems. I still had quite a bit of filling left even though I used rather large stuffing mushrooms, so I mixed it with some milk, sour cream, and a bit of mayo and made it into a scrumptious veggie/cracker dip for another party a few days later.

A really good mushroom recipe for friends who don't like seafood (although you could easily stir in crabmeat for those who do).  I added finely chopped onion (equal to the amount of mushroom stems) and about 2 Tablespoons seasoned breadcrumbs.  Also thought it needed some additional seasoning, so I sprinkled in salt and garlic salt.  Very good --have made it several times over the holidays and everyone really enjoyed them.

WOW! These came out AWESOME!!! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe! I used a small box of mushrooms and cut the cream cheese in half and still had a little filling left over. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!! :)

These are absolutely wonderful!!!  I also bought a can of lump crab meat that I will add to the filling.  As other people have said I might also substitute next time finely chopped green onion instead of the onion powder.  Very easy to make as well.

These are the first stuffed mushrooms I've ever had, and I'd say they were a success. The cream chease covered the taste of mushrooms a bit, but the texture was wonderful. They smelled great and they were all gone within the hour.

Perfect appitizer-not one left on the platter. I did add a can of crab to the mixture. Also brushed a little melted butter on top before putting in oven. It did take longer than 20 min. to heat them in my oven. I have a feeling that I will be making these often.

These mushrooms are simply the best. If you want to cut down on a bunch of time and a bunch of ingredients, steps, cost, cook together a tube of Jimmy Dean ground sausage (remove fat) and an 8 oz pack of cream cheese and stuff mushrooms. Stick in oven 350 for 10 min. Just as good but less steps. For attractiveness, sprinkle with a little parsley.

Yummy!! These were very good. I believe the recipe is 5 stars the way it is, but like several others I added a small can of crabmeat to the filling.  I also used about 3 dozen smaller mushrooms and the amount of filling was more than enough.  Great recipe!

You may as well be eating balls of cream cheese. Though the flavor was ok, the shear amount of cheese in the stuffing was just too much for one mushroom cap!

Loved it! The only thing I did differently was that I used half of the suggested cream cheese and I still had some stuffing left over. I guess it depends on the size of the mushrooms too. I also used onion salt because I didn't have onion powder...if you use onion salt, use much less than the suggested amount, it'll get very salty!

These were a hit at a gathering recently.  They did not get hot enough for the 20 minutes required baking time for my liking so next time I will cover with foil and keep in oven longer.  Many requested recipe and I will definitely use again.

I've made this recipe a few times and it is delicious!  I only use half the amount of cream cheese that is asked for and it tastes great.  This recipe is easy to make and great for parties!

I thought they were 'okay.'  Maybe I'm picky.  I think there needs to be some more tweaking of the texture and flavoring.

Pretty darn good!  Added a little bread crumbs and used feta because I had it on hand.  I'm having a big party on Friday.  I hope they hold up in a chaffing dish.

I had never made stuffed mushrooms before, and so didn't know what to expect. The texture of the mushrooms was wonderful- there was just so much cream cheese. Too much. I'll be making these again, but i'm going to tweak the recipe a bit.

These were quite a hit at a party.  They definitely need to be kept warm.  People liked them, but I found them too cheesy.  It would be better to make them with smaller mushrooms so you don't have so much cheese in each one (unless, of course, you prefer them very cheesy.)

My daughter's boyfriend made these for us the first time we met him.  It's a perfect appetizer and can be prepared in advance and just popped in the oven when your guests arrive.  Even the few leftovers reheated the next day were still delicious!

No one in the family is a huge fan of mushrooms. Decided to give these a try for a party that I was giving that had children as well as adults.  They were the BIGGEST hit with both!  The family loved them too, and as everyone else said....all gone.  I will definitely make them many times.  Thanks for a simply great recipe.

LOVE These, this recipe is one of my go-to party recipes. FYI there's always extra filling, so buy some extra mushrooms! Leave out pepper flakes and these become kid friendly! Use pampered chef garlic press, for perfect garlic in this recipe!

These are the absolute best stuffed mushrooms ever!  I made these for an appetizer after a winery trip, 2 men literally ate the whole dish themselves!  They raved all night long on how good they were.

I am a student so sometimes I do a bit of budget cooking, most of the stuff in this recipe is not that expensive and you can always supplement parmesan cheese with any kind of cheese like eidam. Love it.

I stuffed 24 mushrooms and still had filling left over!  1/4 tsp. of cayenne was a little too much kick for me, next time I will use a little less.  I also added about 6 minced shrimp to the filling. Wonderful appetizer!

We all loved these little guys! Soooo sooo good! My daughter told me to write that she loves them too. She's 7. No changes. Oh yes, there was one. I didnt have parmesan so I used mozzerella. Next time will try the parmesan.

These were so wonderful. I had my doubts with the cream cheese, but these certainly lived up to their title and were seriously mouth-watering. I used mini-portobello mushrooms and sprinkled a little bit of bread crumbs and romano cheese on top and they were the first to go at the potluck I took them too. Huge hit. This is a keeper.

These were awesome!  I followed the recipe to a T.  I was able to get more then 12 mushrooms filled.  They were so good that my husband and I ate every single bit.  These will be great to serve for an app next time company comes over.  These are a total must try.

Pretty tasty!  I had the thought afterwards (too late!) that they'd of been even better with bacon.  After all, EVERYTHING tastes better with bacon!  LOL!

These were the most delicious mushrooms I've ever had!  I decided at the last minute not to add the crab and they still turned out perfectly - especially with a little parmesan sprinkled on top.  I had a little of the stuffing left over, so the next day decided to heat it in the oven and use it for a dip - so mouth watering!

This is a very good recipe. I have made it a few times and the only thing I have done different is add some green onions and cook those with the stems and garlic. I also put a lot of fresh crab meat in them. There amazing everyone loves them.

These are really really really good.  I made them exactly as the recipe is written, but used a pack of small mushrooms.  I had enough to make 20 small mushrooms, and still had some leftover filling.  I can't eat wheat - so this was a good gluten-free mushroom option.  I didn't give it a 5 because I felt like it needed just a little texture... I'll probably try adding chopped artichokes next time.

This recipe is just flavored cream cheese stuffed in mushrooms.  I should have used less filling per mushroom b/c the cream cheese way overpowered the mushrooms.  2 stars b/c a few people said they liked them.

This is the only recipe I use for stuffed mushrooms. Sometimes, instead of onion powder, I saute diced onion with the stems.

My first time making stuffed mushrooms.  They turned out great! I left out the onion powder and cayenne. I added Italian Seasoning, a little bit of diced green pepper, and some imitation crab meat.  I dipped the stuffed mushrooms in a lil' melted butter before baking.  Next time I plan on sprinkling a lil' paprika on the tops before baking.  These are so easy to make and yummy-tasting.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I added a can of crab meat to the cream cheese mixture. Had to ommit the onion powder as I didn't have any on hand. These tasted amazing I dare say better then resturant quality and so easy to make!****

***I have made these several times and still love the recipe as written however, I do try and watch my diet so have since started making them with fat free cream cheese and green onions.  When I am cooking the mushroom stems I throw in the whites of the green oinons and a clove of garlic. After mixing that mixture with the cream cheese I add a can of crab and the tops of the green onions. I only use 1 maybe 2 tbls. of cheese.

With just a few changes, this is a 5 star.  From reading other reviews, I added real bacon bits (from a bag) to the stem/garlic mixture and after filling with a plastic bag, I dipped the mushrooms in melted butter then in bread crumbs seasoned w/ a little garlic salt.  They turned out really good.

AWESOME RECIPE! This is a major hit with the family and friends. We actually goofed the first time we made this and mixed fresh garlic in with the cream cheese as well as sauteed the fresh garlic with the "mushroom bits"....VERY GARLICKY...BUT VERY GOOD!  I also have made these with fresh bacon bits. It adds that little bit of "bacon-ness".  :)

This was my first attempt at stuffed mushrooms (new to cooking). Easy to follow, tasted great. We had a few left over and my wife was warming them in the microwave while I was grilling. When I came in from the grill I noticed the plate was empty. I asked where the leftover mushrooms went and she said the dog ate them. She had a guilty look on her face. Consider that another rave review for these stuffed mushrooms!  I am marking it as a 4 stars simply because I don't have anything else to compare them against. Will make these again.

Great recipe - some modifications. It's a lot of creaminess when using large mushrooms, thought it would be great served over pasta (there's enough filling to serve as sauce!). Added some sourcream to cut the cream cheese flavour a bit, and sauteed some onion and peppers to add a little body.

My husband picked out this recipe one day while he was experimenting in the kitchen. He surprised me with these appetizers after work. I couldn't believe how they tasted. then he had leftover stuffing so we had that on crackers the next day. Now occasionally  he will only make the stuffing mixture and have it on crackers. He is hooked!!!

I have made these mushrooms multiple times for multiple occasions including a wedding, graduations, backyard bbq's and Thanksgiving. EVERYONE LOVES THEM, even people who don't eat mushrooms! I follow the recipe except I am sure to use EV Olive Oil and I stir the cream cheese and Parmesan into the garlic and stem mixture while it is still warm and have found that it blends together more quickly.

I love love love this it is perfect the way it is!  the only thing i suggest is u only stuff  the caps with only a little bit just enough to fill the caps because the cream cheese is very overwhelming.  its ok though i would definitely make this again

Oh yea! This one is a keeper! Lots of flavor, has that little kick at the end from the cayenne. Mom and sister thought it was a little too much of a kick, but others thought it was perfect. Depending on the crowd, I may cut back cayenne, but otherwise....YUMMMYY!

Very easy and totally delicious! I made 24 large mushrooms from 1 batch of filling, so I tried it 2 different ways.  It's much better in a convection oven.  The cheese on the top of the mushrooms brown like the image on the recipe.

This is an outstanding appetizer!!  Definitely be sure to wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp cloth (or buy them already clean) because submersing them in water will give you really gross, soggy mushrooms when they come out of the oven.  To make it more of a side dish, I've used the extra large portobello mushrooms instead.

I followed the recipe as written and we didn't like at all - too much cream cheese - I may try this again with much less cream cheese and add some shredded mozz or something. I like all of the ingredients listed, maybe need to tweak amounts and add a few others.

I thought the stuffed mushrooms were good but a little salty... although I didn't add salt. Maybe I would add a little less onion powder and maybe some chopped sauted onions instead.

I took these to a party and got SUCH compliments - they were gone in a matter of minutes (I even made a double batch!).  I used 2 packages of baby portabellos, doubled the recipe, and had LOTS of leftover filling.  If doubling the amount of mushrooms, I would keep the filling amount the same.  But I wouldn't change the filling in any way - it was perfect!!

I didn't taste these myself as I don't like mushrooms, but my husband loved them. He wouldn't let me throw them away after dinner, which says a lot because he NEVER eats leftovers.

This was one of the appetizers I served to my Easter dinner company.  I doubled the recipe and added a can of crabmeat to the cream cheese mixture just to give it some added "oomph".  The mushrooms were delicious!  This recipe is a keeper, for sure!  Delicious!

After reading reviews about the mushrooms coming out bland, I cut the cream cheese in half and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Definitely not bland, but not tasty either. These have potential, so I'll try again but reduce the cayenne a bit and add some salt and shredded cheese. A great suggestion was to make it all up in the pan, cheese included and put it in a zip-lock bag to pipe into the mushrooms. Thanks!

my father in law makes the BEST stuffed mushrooms and even these don't compare to his. this is a great recipe though. next time i think i will use stuffing so that the cream cheese mixture isn't so rich. my husband LOVED these and asked that i make them on a regular basis.

These are a little more work than the stuffed mushrooms I have done in the past, but they were well worth it.  I used one regular size container of whole mushrooms that were just average size and ended up with a ton of the stuffing mixture left.  Put it in the fridge and next day stuffed another container of mushrooms that we had in the fridge.  Only comment is to make sure the mushrooms are very fresh and haven't been in the fridge for several days, as our second container had been.  The fresh mushrooms held up better to the heat and kept their shape better. Wonderful flavor!

I've made these twice now, and both times they received rave reviews from my hubby & guests.  I followed the directions exactly.  There was plenty of extra filling, so I combined the extra on top of the stove with some cream to make a sauce to go with the mushrooms.  It turned out fantastic!

Delicious! Easier to make than I would have thought. I took the advice of others and added crumbled bacon one time, and ground sausage another to balance out the strong creamy flavor. Great idea. Though both were good, I preferred the sausage, my b/f liked the bacon. Also used romano instead of parmesan as that's what i have in my fridge and actually prefer. Also topped the mushrooms with a blend of bread crumbs and romano. I personally like the little bit of crunch to again, offset the strong taste.

I served these for a girl's night at my house and they were awesome and received rave reviews.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used Cajun seasoning and it was so good this way I will continue to make them this way.

This was a great and very easy dish! I used mozzarella instead of parmesan (due to a mix up at the grocery store) and it worked well. Though I'll admit some childlike joy at the noise that the mushrooms made when I snapped off the stems. I will never buy stuffed mushrooms again as this tasted better and was a lot more inexpensive (and fun).

I have been making this recipe for a little over a year now and it's WONDERFUL!!!! Have not had any complaints! I wouldn't change a thing to the recipes. The cayenne gives it just a little kick. Filling is creamy. PERFECT!

As others have stated, this recipe produces a lot of filling. Instead of using 12 mushrooms, I used twice as many mushrooms as called for in this recipe. I also doubled the amount of garlic and added 1/4 teaspoon of paprika.  The mushrooms came out wonderfully, however I believe it needs a little character to be a full 5 star recipe.  [chives? bread crumbs on top to give it a little umph?]

I cooked these on parchment paper to absorb the juice, but they were still a little soggy. The stuffing was great and I used this recipe exactly but stuffed twice as many mushrooms. This is another keeper!

This was an awesome recipe as is! The only thing is that you would have to have HUGE mushrooms in order to use all of the filling. I used 24 mushrooms with this. They were a hit... there were none left over and everyone wanted the recipe. A keeper! Fantastic, thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I used whipped cream cheese which is easier to mix than regular. I also didn't wait for the garlic to cool off, I poured it into a bowl with my cheeses and mixed away. I cooked fresh onions with the garlic. I also took some of my Shiraz (red wine) and poured on top of the mushrooms...I would use whatever red wine you like. Very yummy!!

I made these mushrooms for Christmas for my family this year along with about 5 other appitizers but everyone agreed that this was the best one by far. I hate mushrooms so I didn't try it, but they were gone within 10 minutes. My family is STILL talking about how good they were.

These were a big hit with my whole family including the child who wouldn't eat "fungus"!  The only changes I made was to sautee 2 tbls of onions with the stems as I didn't have onion powder, and I used herb & garlic cream cheese for extra flavour.  Took another poster's suggestion and brushed the mushrooms with melted butter before baking.  Couldn't stop eating these!

These mushrooms are really good! I fixed these for our friends which one of them is not crazy about mushrooms and she raved about them!! I substituted about a teaspoon of finely chopped onion instead of the onion powder.

These were definitely yummy! Really rich though. And I had way too much filling for 12 mushrooms (maybe my shrooms were too small?). I added fresh parsley and the juice of half a lemon which gave it a really nice zing! I think next time I will try adding chives instead of parsley. Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome.  A friend has already asked for the recipe.  I didn't want to make the mushrooms stuffed with crab so I chose this recipe.  Very good.  Will make again.

These got rave reviews at my New Year's Eve party. I quickly ran out. I intensely dislike mushrooms, so I can't speak from personal experience!

Excellent!  We cut back on the cayenne a little because they were a little distractingly hot (and we like hot stuff).  These are good with some sausage added too.

Not so much...a mouth full of garlicky cream cheese. I used bit size caps..can't image a large mouthful of all that cheese (and I love cream cheese!).

This recipe was not good at all. Too much cream cheese in this recipe for such a light vegetable. My brother gagged trying them. No thanks...

Rave rave reviews. Three thoughts: #1 - I added 2 cups of top quality crab meat and people went absolutely nuts over it. #2 - Adding 1.5 bunches or so of chopped green onions works well. #3 - I haven't done it myself yet, but there is no way adding some shredded cheddar would be anything but delicious.

I made this recipe for New Years party and they were ok. I would cut the cayenne in half next time, it gave the mushrooms an after taste that I didn't care for.

I also made these for my New Year's Eve party.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was absolutely perfect to my tastes, but I did have a couple of guests who thought it was a bit spicy.  If you don't tend to like a spicy kick, cut back on the cayenne.  This recipe has certainly found a home in my favorite appetizers!

I made this for New Year's Eve, and it was a big hit!  I used around 45 small mushrooms, which used up all the stuffing.  
I added marinated artichoke hearts and only a small pinch of cayenne pepper. The marinated artichoke hearts created created the perfect mix of flavors.  I put a little bit of breadcrumbs in each mushroom and also dipped the mushroom tops in melted butter before baking.
Delish!

A little spicy for my taste, but not too much.  If you want a little less kick, just reduce the cayenne pepper a tad.  But don't take it out - it's such a good addition.  SO YUMMY!

I made this for a party lasnight and everyone loved them!  The seasonings really give it a little kick but not too spicy.  I recommend cooking these right before the party.  I cooked them 2 hours earlier and tried to reheat them and the texture was a little dry but still delicious.  Would definitely make this again!

I doubled this recipe for Christmas Eve and it was a great hit.  Instead of using Parmesan cheese, I used the 1/4 cup but Feta cheese instead and 1/8 tsp. cayenne.

Fantastic! Huge hit in our house! Next time I will try the crab and some with the bacon just for a little variation.  
We thought the seasoning was perfect.

My guests gobbled them up .  I only used about 4oz of cream cheese and still had extra stuffing. I bought prepackaged stuffing mushrooms and although the caps were big they had almost no stems so that may be why the proportion seemed off .  It seemed a bit too cheesey , so next time I'll  add some crab or breadcrumbs .  I took the little bit I had left over and spread it on toast and popped it under the broiler , Yum!

Wonderful recipe!  I made these for friends and they all loved them, although some thought the cayenne was a bit spicy.  I think it adds great flavor to it!  Going to make them again tomorrow.  Love the fact that they are good for vegetarians too!

This recipe was so delicious and the mushrooms went in minutes.  I added a can of crabmeat based on another reviewers suggestion and it really made them tasty.  And the tip about putting the filling in a ziplock with the corner cut off for filling was brilliant!

I kept the recipe as is but the end result was way too spicy for my tastes. I'm gonna give this another try without the cayenne- it was still pretty tasty once you get past its bite.

I give it 4 stars because it was really good, but not fabulous. Both my hubby and I found it to be a tad bland, but it was tasty.  I did press the tops into panko crumbs and liked it.   Next time I am going to try to add in some hot italian sausage to give it something more.

very good, dabbed mushrooms in mixture so they stood up better, broiled for a bit at the end to brown them

Always a hit at parties! I use neufchatel (light) cream cheese to lighten a bit. I cook 3 slices of bacon and chop them up to add to the filling then sautee the garlic and mushroom in the bacon drippings rather than in oil. Don't leave out the cayenne pepper. It gives it a little zing - not enough to be spicy but just gives it something extra.

Made them exactly as written and they were gone before I even got one at my house warming party.  Guests even came into the kitchen to inquire if there were more!  Next time I will make a double batch.

I have used this particular recipe for over 5 years now and it's always a crowd pleaser. Be patient as the moisture cooks from the chopped stems and they are also great if you add some sausage to the mixture. I brown the sausage then add it once the liquid has evaporated. The sausage seems to cut the sharpness of the cream cheese. They are delicious either way!

This was a success my husband and father couldn't get enough.  If you love garlic, cheese and mushrooms you'll love this recipe. I think next time I'll cook up a little hamburger and add that to the stuffing mixture.

These were very good!  They have a great flavor and I enjoy the kick.  I made them for New Year's Eve - and they were gone in an hour.  I even got requests for the recipe.  The only problem I had was that the recipe made too much filling for the number of mushrooms.

Maybe my mushrooms were small but I felt like an entire package of cream cheese was a lot for my 12 mushrooms. Used 3/4 of the package along and followed the recipe for the rest of the ingredients. These were good, I'll make them again. Easy too.

This is a good stuffed mushroom recipe.  I liked the cream filling with all the spices very delicious and rich.  I ran out of cayenne pepper so ended up substituting it with part paprika part chili powder and it still turned out tasty next time I'll add bacon or something to the cream part to add a little more texture and crunch.

I always get rave reviews when I make these mushrooms.  The cayenne was a bit much, so I reduced to only 1/8 of a teaspoon.  Sometimes I get a lot of water left behind in my casserole dish, but it is easily reduced by turning the mushrooms over onto a paper towel after washing and picking stems off.

I made this in escargot dishes and added a little melted butter to each cup.  They came out so good!  I used small mushrooms so they would fit in the dishes and figured I would end up with way too much stuffing, so I halved all the stuffing ingredients except for the mushroom stems - and still had far more than I could possibly need.  Very nice flavor though, and they looked beautiful.

I tried this appetizer on a whim one day, and my husband absolutely loved and requests it quite often.  It's a great recipe to entertain with as well.  It's so simple and looks like it takes so much more time and effort.  I love it!

Yum! These were so good. I thought they made too much stuffing mix, but the taste was fantastic. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! I sprinkled a bit of paprika on top of the mushrooms before baking, and added some salt to the mix. I loved these.

Wonderful!  My husband said this was a keeper of a recipe.  I added finally chopped onion since I didn't have onion powder.  Turned out just fine. The only problem was that we ate to many.  Filling actually allowed us to stuff 16 large mushrooms.

These were a big hit at my husband's graduation party. Everyone raved about them, and several people left with a copy of the recipe! They were a bit spicy, so you may want to go a little lighter on the cayenne if you're not into hot stuff.

This is a tasty recipe.  It is simple to make and pretty quick.  I used fresh chopped onion sauteed with the garlic instead of onion powder.  This recipe is a little spicy, so some may want to cut back a little on the hot pepper.  It took closer to 25 - 30 minutes to bake.

These mushrooms were pretty good. They turned out well. Seemed to be missing something I'm not sure what. Maybe not so much cream cheese. Over all really good.

Hmmm....not too sure what to say about these. Made for Easter, and at first we loved them. By about the third one, the flavors started to be a little overwhelming and rich. I don't think this recipe is a keeper for me. I was looking for stuffed mushrooms without sausage, crab, etc., but will contine my search. Thanks anyway!
UPDATE: I have since re-read some review and think I may have over stuffed the mushrooms, making them to cream cheesy. I may try again, with the addition of some breadcrumbs.

I love this recipe -- I made a double batch for a party recently and they all disappeared! I actually did add a bit of breadcrumbs though just to give it a little more substance and also a dash of salt.

Wow these were awesome.  I did as other reviewer suggested and finely chopped some onion and sauted with the muchroom at the last minute I added the garlic, so as not to burn.  I also buttered the mushrooms before baking.  Then followed the recipe as written.  My husband insisted I review this as five stars.  We ate all twelve of the mushrooms. Will buy more tomorrow to finish the rest of the mix.  Best stuffed mushrooms ever.  Thank you for the posting.

What can I say everyone always LOVE LOVE LOVES these.  Followed recipe exactly, (which is odd for me).  I would like to try them sometime adding some crab meat to the recipe.  YUM!!!!  Be careful these are addicting.  I made these as an appetizer on Valentines day, we ate to many never made it to the main course.  lol

This is a great recipe!  Took it to a family New Year's lunch.  They were gone in 5 minutes.  Adding a little bacon is great too.  Making them ahead & refrigerating them until you're ready to bake is great for quick dinner thru the week.

Use only a little bit of stuffing in each mushroom, otherwise its too overpowering and heavy.

I made this recipe for Christmas and everyone really liked them, they were incredibly rich! I don't know if I'll make them again, but they were worth a taste.

These are foolproof!  I'm always asked for the recipe, and there are NEVER any left over.  You end up with more filling than you need for a dozen mushrooms, so I always make extra.  I guess the alternative would be to cut back on the cream cheese, but who wants to end up with ONLY twelve of these?  They're very good--very addictive.   Another bonus:  I made them once for a brunch with friends and my vegetarian friend was very grateful to find these on the table.

The very best stuffed mushrooms I have ever made and my sons in law ask for them a lot! 

I add a little green onion tops snipped with scissors and a bit of salt to the garlic and chopped stems. Also crush herb stuffing mix (I use my mini prep food processer) and top the stuffed mushrooms with it. Following another reviewers tip, I put a little white wine in the pan along with chicken broth (if I have a box open in the fridge) Keeps the mushrooms very moist.  Don't try to use fresh onion as it makes the mix runny.  I also make the stuffing mix ahead of time and refrigerate and it's easy to stuff the caps and firm enough to just dip in the herb dressing crumbs.

They were very good. Ours were a little undercooked and people commented we should try to put crabmeat/bacon in it to make it amazing. Will keep this recipe to make it again though -- but next time with meat and a tad bit longer in the oven.

Added tiny pieces of bacon,used chipolte powder instead of cayenne (didn't have it)& lastly I sprinkled with shredded mozz cheese before baking, these were super easy & really fantastic. Thanks for an excellent appetizer!

Excellent! I added a tad too much cayenne pepper, but doing gave it that extra kick. I also halved the cream cheese amount; somehow adding 8 oz (an entire package) of cream cheese sounded too decadent. I also sliced a sliver off the top of the mushrooms to help keep them upright while I baked them. I also followed one reviewer's advice and bought smaller whole white mushrooms (used all 12 of them) which made this a bite-sized treat. Great, great recipe!

I usually dont even bother with the stems and garlic. I just mix up the cheese and spices along with powdered garlic and a bit of mrs. dash table blend. Add in cooked crumbled bacon - A MUST! Mix in Italian blend shredded cheese and top it off with a sprinkle of parm. They are gone as soon as they hit the table! I can usually stuff about 25-30 mushrooms

I absolutely LOVE these. I made these just the other day for my hubby's little get-together with some friends. I was kind of nervous considering I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms, but they were a hit with everyone. I only made 15 with the and I wish I would've doubled it.  They disappeared just as fast as I took them out of the oven!

Made these for dinner as an appetizer a few weeks back and for the superbowl party this year.  Everyone loved them and asked how I made them.  I didn't wait for the stems & garlic to cool (both times), but they still turned out great!

I have made these twice, and I changed them a little. I add a shallot to the mushroom stem and  garlic mixture. Then I add 2 Tbs. of chopped frozen spinach (first squeeze out the water) Before filling the caps I also brush them with melted butter, dash of powdered onion and garlic. Delish!

This turned out delicious! I added a 6 oz. can of crab meat after reading the reviews. Important tip: Let the mushroom's completely dry. Otherwise, you'll the mushrooms will be cooking in alot of water.

I've made this twice now for family gatherings, and they disappear very fast.  It was at that moment that I could see that I was supplanting some of the traditional "cooks" in the family.  This recipe has me on the list of people to call to bring a dish.  I'm experimenting with crab meat as others have suggested but I haven't found the right amount to really bring out the seafood flavor.

Thanks! These are really good. I halved the cream cheese amt and added some cheddar. Omitted the cayenne. (I am sure it is good but not my family's speed.)Giving this 4 stars because even with 1/2 the amt of cream cheese, there was almost 1/2 the mixture left. Maybe my mushrooms (15 total) were on the small side, but that seems like the porportions are off. I think I will bake a zucchini and use the rest of it up.

I've made these three times, and they've always been excellent!  The last time, I added bread crumbs to the top, but couldn't tell a difference... so save the calories and leave them out.  I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese... And this filling is enough to stuff at least 40 white mushrooms.  Everyone loves them!

I followed the recipe exactly for these, but found them to be a little bland.  There seemed to be something missing for my taste. There was some left over at our Christmas Eve Party and I will look for a different recipe next time.

At first, I thought I'd missed something in the recipe. But I double-checked, and I followed everything as written, and was unimpressed. These aren't bad by any means, just not great. Made these for a NYE party: my parents both thought they were a bit spicy; guests eventually ate them, but there were leftovers (which rarely happens at my house, lol). 

Personally, it tasted like there was something missing from the recipe, but I'm not sure what. The flavors just seemed a bit flat. 

Maybe I'll try again with crab meat, as other have suggested.

These are wonderful!  I made them for Christmas and my husband couldn't get enough of them.  Also made for New Years party and everyone raved about them.  I followed the advice of others but used the left over stuffing to make a dip - fantastic!  Thanks so much!  These are a keeper.

Very good.  I made a few small changes- used brie cheese instead of cream cheese and added sliced almonds to the stuffing mix.  My guests loved this recipe and I will definitely make again.

These are soooo good!  I added a little chopped green onion in addition to the garlic and substituted mustard powder for the cayenne (since that's what I had) but it worked really well.  Will be making these again very soon.

These were good stuffed mushrooms. I halved the cream cheese mixture & used 2 containers of small-medium mushrooms. It was the perfect amount of filling. Not "the best", but enjoyed by my guests.

Brought these to a party this weekend and everyone loved them. The only change I made was that I minced a small onion in place of the onion powder. They cayenne was the perfect amount of kick. They produced alot of juice, so half way through cooking I drained the tray so they didnt get too soggy. 
Stuffed mushrooms are alot of work, but after cleaning them out (which you have to do with any stuffed mushroom recipe) the rest of the recipe is pretty easy.

Absolutely delicious!!! I made these for Christmas & everybody loved them, even the people who don't like mushrooms loved them. I added some Jimmy Dean Sausage & sprinkled shredded parmesan on top before baking. This is a fantastic recipe & I will definitely make these again... Thank you!!

This recipe is so delicious! I've made it a couple times now. I added minced green onions the second time and they were that much better - we love onions. I did two things that other reviewers suggested. I sliced a little off the top of the mushrooms to help them stand still, and then added that part of the mushroom to the filling. I also topped the mushrooms with Italian breadcrumbs, which was the final touch that took these mushrooms from great to fantastic.

I love garlic and usually will put more tha called for in a recipe.  This was the first time I tried these and I think I will actually cut the amount of garlic I use next time.  I also wasn't crazy about the texture of the cheese mixture...it seemed a bit "loose" when they came out of the oven and were not easy to eat as a "finger food", they needed a fork.  I will try this again but may add crab as some have suggested and will definately cut the amount of garlic. Maybe I used a really hot clove, but it was too much!

Not for my taste.  I didn't care for the consistency.  I suppose we prefer the breaded kind.  They were just okay.  I wouldn't make again.

This is my new favorite stuffing for stuffed mushrooms. I modified just a little by adding half of a sleeve of ritz crackers to the mix for consistency. I topped with panko bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese for a beautifully browned topping. Cayenne pepper was just spicy enough. Will definitley make again. Maybe next time will add crab meat as well. Served on xmas eve and it was a hit.

Be warned. As another reviewer suggested; once you take these to a party or family function - you will then be required to make them for ALL future events. Lol. These were just awesome. The only thing I added was one finely chopped green onion while sauteing. 
I had four packages of the freshest mushrooms I've seen and I still had left over filling for dip. I did not wash the shrooms in water. Big no no. I just wiped them off with a paper towel. After making the filling, I placed it and the shrooms in zip-lock bags. Once I arrived at Christmas dinner, I snipped the bag with the filling and piped it into the shrooms that had been placed on a large cookie sheet. This recipe should be cooked on-site unless your party is next door or across the street. As other reviewers suggested; DO NOT WASH MUSHROOMS IN WATER!!!

FYI to the reviewer who had too much moisture in this dish:  I don't use fresh mushrooms a lot but have read that mushrooms absorb moisture when washed, so should be washed and immediately, thoroughly dried.

Very yummy- went over very well! I brought them to Christmas Eve dinner and my brother-in-law told me he thought it was the best dish there! 
I sauteed some onion before putting in the stems and garlic. I let that cook down, then added some white wine. Maybe that affected the cooking time- it needed way more than 20 minutes. I will make them again- loved them!

I thought these were a little too cream cheesey, even though I'm generally a cream cheese fan.  I served them with Christmas dinner though and everyone else, especially my husband who's not a huge mushroom fan, raved over them.  Very quick and easy, although I did have way too much filling left over.  May use only half a brick of cream cheese next time.

I LOVED this recipe.  Instead of dropping the stuffing into the mushrooms with a spoon I put the mixture into a plastic bag and snipped the corner, per other reviewers suggestions.  I then just squeezed out the mixture.  Really easy and it minimized the mess.

My family unanimously proclaimed these to be the best mushrooms we've ever had.  I used garlic powder because I was in a hurry, and it worked out fine.   Only there was way too much stuffing.  I used big baby portabellas too.  I could have stuffed twice as many shrooms or cut the stuffing in half.  Best to go with twice the shrooms as these will disappear fast!

Everbody absolutely loved these mushrooms! I doubled the recipe for a big crowd and still had enough filling left for several mushrooms.  It goes without saying that I will make these again and again.

They weren't bad but not as good as I thought they would be. I made them for a few people and everyone thought they were good but not great. I would try a different recipe next time they were a little bland for my taste and seemed to be missing something.

Very spicy, but it definately adds a good bite and makes it much more interesting (and yummy) than biting into a big old mushroom.  I really liked this and will probably make again.

Just okay. The filling, even though room temp, took too long to heat so the mushrooms were soggy. The flavor was good though

These were delicious.  The only change I made was out of necessity -- I found I was out of garlic, so I used garlic powder along with minced onion.  This filling was awesome.  I had lots left over, so I just spooned it into a small bowl and used it as a chip and vegetable dip.  It was all gone by the end of the evening.

Made these for our family Christmas party and they were a HUGE hit!  Delicious.  I bought two packages of mushrooms (more than 24) and there was enough filling for all without changing amounts.  Topped with fresh crumbled bacon and minced scallions as suggested by another reviewer.  Also added about 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt to the filling.  Excellent!

Made these -added grated zucchini instead of crab (veg. sister.)  And they were great!!  It was perfect.  Creamy, delectible, with a dynamic body -something you can sink your tongue into.

These were good, with just the right amount of spiciness (I put a little extra cayenne in). However, next time I will add something else to the cream cheese mixture...it needed more flavor.

This recipe was really a great one.  It was simple to put together and much tastier than anticipated.  I did use half of the cream cheese and adjusted the other items accordingly because I used baby portabello mushrooms.  If you're using smaller mushrooms, then you'll probably want to halve the rest of the ingredients.. or you could refrigerate the excess for a few days.

Ok but not great.  I made the recipe exactly as stated. They looked and smelled good but the taste seemed to be lacking something.  Perhaps green onion and some bacon as another reviewer had stated would have perked them up. Served for a party and many were leftover - that pretty much says it all.  I will stick with seafood stuffed mushrooms in the future.

I've been making this recipe for 2 years now for my hubby and friends.  I'm famous for making lots of beyond-yummy dishes and this recipe is definitely one that's made my culinary reputation shine.  They're easy and they make WAY MORE than 12.  The filling covers almost two boxes of mushrooms.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought these could have been better.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding some chopped water chestnuts and I just wasn't blown away.  I thought they would be more melty and cheesy.  Next time I will added some shredded cheese and maybe some butter too!  Also, bacon bits or chopped green onions would be yummy too!

This recipe is amazing! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves cream cheese, even if your not a big fan of mushrooms. It converted me into a mushroom lover! Same can be said about a couple friends of mine, not big fans of stuffed mushrooms but LOVED THESE!
I personally wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, its just wonderful the way it is. Perfect ingredient combination and perfect cook time. 
This is a fast recipe and is very filling. Bring it to your next party occasion!

Delicious, I didn't change anything in this recipe and my boyfriend thought they were great, he's not a fan of mushrooms and he devoured these.  Next time I will try to add some chopped spinach, I think spinach and mushrooms go so well together.  Thanks for this recipe....

Incredible!  The mushrooms are easy to prepare and serve.  I've made this recipe several times, with small variations adding 1/4 cup of dried bread crumbs to the recipe.   Everyone has loved both the original recipe and with the variations.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I add a pound of sausage instead of using the mushroom stems.  I brown the sausage and add minced garlic and cook a few minutes then add to cream cheese mixture.  It is a huge hit.  Makes a lot of filling so I get 2 packages of fresh mushrooms.  I made to take for a football party and we ate almost all of them before we even left.

Best mushroom EVER!  Makes enough filling for way more than 12 mushrooms, sometimes I use the extras on crackers.  Do not need filling to cool before mixing it with cheese, when it's hot, it mixes better (softens it up).  Love these!

I don't know what went wrong with these, luckily I divided the batch and cooked a few to experiment.  The filling ran all over the place,the second batch, I took out some the stuffind and topped with a sprinklin of bread crumbs,it helpe to hold it together.  Otherwise great flavor.

These are amazing! I like to quickly saute the mushroom caps in with the oil and garlic before stuffing them. I also add some italian bread crumbs to the cream cheese mixture - this makes them amazing when you pull them out of the oven!!

DELICIOUS! These were easy and tasted wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly except I made more than 12 because I had a lot of filling left over (maybe my mushrooms were small). I had two people ask me for the recipe.  You can definitely taste the cayenne.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I doubled the recipe and served them at a housewarming party and they were gone...fast!  Doubling the recipe left me with quite a bit filling leftover, so I spread it on dinner crackers for a snack the next day, YUM!

I've been using your Mouth-Watering Stuffed Mushroom recipe for years, ever since I found it here, and people I know request these babies for every social gathering!  So much better than 'shrooms stuffed with lots of bread crumbs or other "filler."  These are full of nothing but GOOD stuff!

these were easy and scrumptious!  i thought it was going to be tedious dicing up the mushroom stems, but not the case - very easy.  i put the cheese mixture in a baggie and cut the end and piped it into the mushrooms.  if your garlic-leery, i would add less garlic.  i didnt add as much cayene as called for just because i was nervous, and it ended up being just right for us.  yum.  thanks!

I twist this recipe a little by adding cooked ground sausage to the recipe.  I use Jimmie Dean's bold country flavored sausage.  I replace half of the cheese mixture with the sausage and they come out just awesome!  I take them to every event we go to because they are always requested.  There are never any leftovers.  These are a great low carb option!

These were delicious, but very rich.  Cream cheese taste was a little overwhelming for us.  I think next time, I'll take the advice of others and add crab and/or bread crumbs to offset.

Although I didn't try these (I made them for my parents) they both raved about them...and there is no denying how good they smelled while I was making them. I will definitely make these again in the future.

I really enjoyed this recipe even more after some alterations. I replaced some of the cream cheese with bread crumbs and added some turkey sausage for the fun of it. Everyone loves this recipe.

I've made these mushrooms for company several times and there are never any leftover. Plan on filling about 24 mushrooms, other than that I follow the recipe exactly. More than once I've been told people that dont like mushrooms love this recipe.

I only used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese specified and it was just enough for my 12 mushroom caps.  I thought the taste was very good and everyone else enjoyed them.  Different than the usual ones stuffed with bread crumbs.  Will definitely make again.

I can't even tell you how much we loved this recipe. I used 1/4 amount of the cream cheese and added bread crumbs and swiss cheese on top. It was simply heaven! This is a keeper for my recipe box. So simple, quick, and fantastic. I am glad I did not use all of the cream cheese. Next time I will add either lobster or crab with a gravy on the side. thanks!

I followed this recipe to a "T" for my dad's birthday celebration.  It was a gigantic HIT!  Perfect combination of creaminess and spice.

I tried this recipe to provide an option for vegetarians at a party I hosted.  I found these stuffed mushrooms to be too spicy and cheesy (never thought I'd say that!).  If you're expecting something more like a sausage filled recipe, stick with the original.

Very good.  Not exactly your typical stuffed mushroom (no bread crumbs) but I think that may be what I like about them.  Thanks.

At first I thought the mix might be a little too salty (I also added crab meat), but after baking they turned out to be little bites of pure heaven! There are wonderful, and it does help to dip the caps in butter before baking so that they stay moist!

These were very good.  I liked the sauteed mushrooms and garlic; my usual recipe calls for raw garlic, which tends to be strong.  I didn't find this too rich, but it's very similar to my old recipe, minus the bacon bits.

Very good!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I served these at a party and they were gobbled up very quickly.  Next time I make these I might sprinkle some parmasean cheese on the tops to create a crusty top.

Made these as an appetizer for Christmas dinner and they were the first to go!  I added a can of crabmeat but they would've been great even without it.  Recipe made at least enough filling for 24 mushrooms though (glad I bought an extra package!)

These are good, but I don't think a cream cheese filling for mushrooms is quite right for me (I've had an amazing recipe in the past with no cream cheese).  I did add some cooked chorizo sausage to the filling to spice it up a bit.

I just made a triple serving of this for the first time for my Christmas party. It was a huge hit. I was crunched on time on the day of the party so I made the stuffing (minus the crab) the day before and let it sit in fridge. Then added crab next day, put in ziplock back and piped into each mushroom. Then sprinkled with breadcrumbs. I used crimini mushrooms which look more fancy and brown better than the traditional mushroom. I took tips from different reviews and added crab meat and green onions during the saute process. They were a bit too cheesy for me, but everyone else seemed to love it. They disappeared off the table. I assumed about 3 per person for appetizers.

I added bacon and some italian seasoning, since I was taking them to an italian themed dinner.  They were really good, but I didn't get absolute rave reviews. Though in all fairness, I think my family might just prefer a bread crumb stuffed mushroom.

I hate mushrooms so I've never tried this but I've made these for a few dinner parties and they are a huge hit.  So the 5 stars comes from them.  I did, however, use the extra filling (I always have a little extra) as a spread on crackers and that's pretty good.

I followed the recipe Exactly. The stuffing was a bit to much- very rich with the cream cheese. It had good flavor though - my husband liked them.If I make them again I would only use half the stuffing - if that much - that way it would have more mushroom taste - Thanks for the recipe

I tried these mushrooms at home. Family raved. Then, I took  them on the road with me when I'm catering.  I put the filling into a pastry bag and quickly fill the Caps on site...the people drift into the kitchen as the aroma starts to move....YUM

Overall they were pretty good. I brought them to a Labor Day party and got some good reviews, but others thought they were to spicy from the cayenne pepper. I made 12 and had a couple leftover. So I think I will stick to the the ones stuffed with garlic and bread crumbs.

These were delicious.  Made them for a party and they were gobbled right up (and I kept hearing "who brought the mushrooms?" - always a good sign!)

These are excellent!  I love that you can just use the stems instead of having to get breadcrumbs as well.  Every time I make these they're gone VERY fast!  Make a lot!

Awesome!  I made around 30 mushrooms and kept the filling the same amount.  Everyone enjoyed these and they were gone in about 5 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe.

Each time I make these I get tons of raves!! Usually my friends tell me not to make them because they can't quit eating them! The only thing I changed is that I use extra virgin olive oil and sometimes real parmesan cheese and I too go a little be light on the cayenne pepper because I don't care for things that are too hot. Other than that, they are great!

These were great.  I also made some with ricotta cheese which I do not like but many of our guest did.  And made one with cream cheese and small cocktail shrimp diced.  They loved it.  Thanks for the post.

I doubled this recipe for a party and they were gone within the first 30 minutes.  I wished I had made more.  Excellent flavor, the little kick with the cayenne pepper really makes these stand out.

I made these for a get together... and everyone ate them. Even my friends husband who doesn't eat muushrooms told me they were great. I was expecting something better, seeing that over 600 people have rated this-- but they were just okay to me. I did add one can of lump crab meat to the mixture.  I will make it again because others enjoy it. Thanks.

I loved these! My sister was grabbing them right out of the oven and eating them in pain, but couldn't stop. The filling is really good, I liked how it was a little spicy. Next time I'll put some spinach in also.

I made a few changes - added 1 lb of bulk sausage, some chopped onion and instead of parmesan cheese I did a blend of cheddar, montery, colby.  It was the hit of the party.  Great recipe.

These taste yummy but they are sooo stinky when you are baking them! I omitted the cayenne and they were delicious anyways. It does make a LOT of stuffing/filling. You could probably fill twice as many mushrooms.

This is the BEST appetizer stuffed mushroom recipe! I always make double, only because my they don't last and my guests/family ALWAYS look for more.  I have been making it for the past 6 years! I wouldn't change a thing, the recipe is perfect!

Used cremini mushrooms instead... These are GREAT appetizers that everyone loved when I served it. I used the extra filling as a spread for the toasted baguette and crackers I had out. I will make this again and again.

OMG these were a hit. No need to change a thing perfect as is. I have always been known for my crab stuffed mushrooms. I decided to try something different and made these for a dinner party I had. There was only one problem ...I didn't have eough, people ate 4-5 mushrooms. I had guest asking for more.  I will definately double the recipe next time. Thank you for a great recipe.

I looooved these! Many people at the party didn't care for mushrooms, so they didn't try them. That was fine with me--more for me! One man, though not crazy about mushrooms, did try them. After one bite, he scraped out the filling and ate just that, leaving the mushroom! Delicious!

oh yes! i have to double the recipe and use about 3 times the mushroom (but medium sized ones)  so you dont run out in the middle of the party.  I made them 3 times in the last 2 weeks for 3 different gatherings. Every time it came out perfectly.

Served fresh out of the oven these are wonderful!  Made for a party and they all disappeared!  Next time I will prepare the "filling" ahead of time so I can just fill the caps when I want to serve.  You can really over fill the caps, since they bake down quite a bit.

I made these for Christmas and they turned out great.  The only thing I washed the mushrooms instead of wiping them clean with a paper towel and they seemed a bit wet.  Very good though.

These tasted just like the ones at a local fine restaurant I love.  My family seemed to go for another recipe I used that had bread stuffing but with my help all of these were gone in no time.  I did use more mushrooms than the recipe called for.

LOVE THESE!  I add crab meat to ours (I use canned crab meat, but you could use imitation also) and we love them.  The filling definitely makes more mushrooms than it says, which is perfect, I just buy more mushrooms.  I'll be making them again to take on Christmas Eve.

These were okay. The filling was to cheesy tasting from the parm. Also I ended up with WAY to much filling and had to throw it out even though I  used two packs of shrooms. I hate to waste food

This is a great recipe. I've made them twice and I always make enough mix and just keep fresh mushrooms around for a week or so, so that I can make them on the fly for lunch or something.

These are so good.  Especially for a low carb diet.  To make them a little more hearty, I added real bacon pieces to the cream cheese mix.

This was just okay to my husband and me.  We love mushrooms but found this too creamy and salty.  It didn't have enough variety in flavor.  It was definitely juicy though!

These are ok, but not great.  There is just entirely too much cream cheese in my opinion.  If you love cream cheese, I'm sure these would be right up your alley, but for us, without something else in there, it's just too overpowering.

Incredible!  My HUSBAND made thee for a party for 40 and what a hit it was!  People raved and was easy to prepare but a bit time consuming.  All I can say is it is well worth the time and double what you think you'll need because they go fast!

I made these for my husband and his buddies to take on their annual camping trip.  One of his friends is a chef and they all LOVED them...excellent recipe.  The cayenne gives them a great kick.

Very good, but a little rich. Tasted like something was missing, but not sure what. Next time I think I will play around with the stuffing ingredients a little bit.

I recently brought this to a cookout and it was a huge hit! Next time I will use less cayenne pepper and the stuffing was for more than 12 mushrooms. Will make this again for football season.

These were just okay, and that may just be because of personal preference. I cooked them 25 minutes, and they just did not seem cooked enough. All I could taste was just mushroom. I have never tried stuffed mushrooms before, so maybe it is just me.

A wonderful appetizer, and also awesome served as a sidedish with grilled steak.  I used a little less cayenne pepper than called for, and it turned out perfect.  My husband and dinner guests all raved about them!

This is the best recipe for stuffed mushrooms that we have ever had. They were a little on the rich side but very yummy, WE added a bit of fetta cheese to the mix and were they ever good.

I made these for a family dinner and everyone thought they were great, and I found them easy to make.  I'm only giving the recipe 4 stars because I personally found the mushrooms a little lacking in flavor.  Next time I will add more seasoning.  As other reviews have noted, the cream cheese mixture definately is enough for more than 12 mushrooms.

This is a keeper!  Not one left within 15 min. of serving.  I could have eaten them all myself. Makes many more than 12 -- I used only 3/4 of the cream cheese and still had filling left after filling 16oz. pkg of mushrooms so wish I had another 8oz. package to fill.  They surely would have been eaten.

I have taken these mushrooms to every party and they are always the first thing to go.  I sauteed garlic and chopped onions and threw in a frozen crab patty.  When that mixture cooled, I added the rest of the ingredients.  Dip the mushroom caps in melted butter before filling and putting on a cookie sheet.  The result is very rich, but a HUGE HIT!

I thought this was a good recipe.  I think it had a little too much cayenne although my guests liked the kick it had.  I also put a little bread crumbs on top for some crunch.  I would make these again.

I used this recipe to fill about 36 small mushrooms. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and splashed white wine in the bottom of the cooking dish, and also topped the mushrooms with bread crumbs. Although the filling was a little too tangy for me, the whole plate was gone in about 10 minutes and I received a number of compliments.

These mushrooms were a huge hit at a party.  I thought they were outstanding.  I chose the recipe as my husband and I are doing the South Beach diet.  There's no bread crumbs in the recipe and they're not even missed!

This was the last of three recipes I
tried. I had never eaten nor made a
stuffed mushroom so I had to have three five star recipes of course. All
three recipes were just wonderful.  I
thought that this one might have too 
much mushroom and cheese as the stems
were added back and it was creamcheese
with no bread crumbs but I was wrong.
I made these according to the recipe and they were just great.  You can be
proud to serve these and they are super fast and easy to make! Thanx!

Very, very good.  Perfect appetizer to serve on a Friday night during Lent.  I added a liitle bit of crushed packaged stuffing mix on the top to give it a little crunch.

The only thing I can say about these mushrooms is OH MY GOSH!!! If you are a big fan of stuffed mushrooms, and look for something different from the bread/high carb option, Well, look no further!! These smell heavenly, and are just as addicting as potato chips!! I highly recommend these!!

These were really good, but I think they had too much cream cheese.  I cut cream cheese in half and added 4 oz. sour cream and they turned out great.

These are delicious! I absolutely love them! I make them all the time. My husband adores them.  I took some advice from other reviews and sprinkled bread crumbs on the top of each mushroom before baking. Gives it a little crunch!

I didn't care for this recipe.  It tasted like mushrooms stuffed with mushroom cream cheese.  Too mushroomy.  If I were to make this again I would have to doctor it up quite a bit.

Wow these were delicious!  Very cream cheesy and a tad zingy (spicey), but if you like that then you'll love these.  It's easy to make, and I got about 30 mushrooms out of it (20 small, bite size, and 9 bigger ones).  I will definitly be making this recipe again.  Thanks Angie!

This is one of the best appetizer recipes I've ever tried! It was a huge hit with my family, all of whom are excellent cooks. Kids loved it too. Cayenne pepper gives it just enough kick. I baked it in white wine as another reviewer suggested, and I think this takes it up even another notch. Makes enough for much more than 12 mushrooms. Great because you can prepare filling ahead of time, then rest of prep time takes only minutes.

I love mushrooms in any form and I have tried MANY stuffed mushroom recipes!  I made this for the holidays and they went like crazy!  They do make many more than it says (but it probably depends on the size of your mushrooms).  I really liked that it was simple, and everyone liked them.  Sometimes if they have seafood in them, people get picky.  Also, you can easily adapt this recipe to your needs.  LOVE 'EM!

I made this for a gathering with another couple...only 4 of us and these were gone!  I used small crimini mushrooms.  I also added a bit more garlic to the recipe and did sprinkle some fresh made bread crumbs on the top.  THese were very good and I will make them again!

These were absolutely delicious! I initially halved the recipe because I was only using 4 large Portabello mushrooms. I made the cheesy filling, and realized I didn't have enough to stuff them, so I had to go back and make more! I spooned the filling on, topped it with some thinly-sliced extra-sharp Cheddar, then sprinkled some seasoned breadcrumbs on top. I added a splash of white wine to the baking pan which softened the mushroom bottoms nicely, and also added some subtle flavor. I will definitely make these again. Thanks, Angie!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  A creamy, garlicy and spicy filling combined with a hot, tasty mushroom - how can you go wrong?  They went fast and I managed to nab a couple for myself.  I had 25 small mushrooms and only used half of the filling; I used the rest as a hot party dip with bread sticks.

Some people thought the filling was a little too much, so I may not want to stuff the mushrooms too heavily with the cream cheese mixture the next time.  Other than that, everyone loved them.

Amazing! Everyone at the dinner loved it. I didn't have Parmesan cheese, so I used a lot of Cheddar cheese and only quarter package of cream cheese. The combination of garlic and cheese is always the best. The mushrooms came our very very good. Will make again!

I don't actually eat mushrooms, but everyone told me these were fantastic.  I cut down on the Cayenne pepper quite a bit - just a couple of dashes - and it gave it the perfect amount of kick.  This does make a lot of stuffing.  You will use more than 12 mushrooms for sure.

These were great.  I've made them twice with raves both times.  I agree this recipe makes more filling than is required for 12 mushrooms.  I'd stuff at least 18 medium-large sized mushrooms with the filling that this recipe makes.

I absolutely love this recipe. I made this for an Anniversary dinner and my guests went wild over this. What a perfect appetizer! I had enough stuffing to fill more than 12 mushrooms, which was great. They were a hit! My guests ate them as soon as I set them down.

I don't like mushrooms but am the minority in my group of friends. I made these and they were gone in no time and everyone wanted the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I gave this recipe four stars simply because I doctored it up a little bit.  First, I cut out the mushroom stems altogether, I also added the garlic without cooking it first, it saved a lot of time.  I up the parmesan cheese to 1/2 a cup and I added some chopped prosciutto.  Everyone gobbled them up.

These were very good but a little too rich.  I cut back the cream cheese about 1/3 and it was still a bit too much.

These stuffed mushrooms are very rich with all of the cream cheese, and the cayenne adds quite a kick.  Use this recipe if you're looking for something other than a bread crumb stuffing.

My 17-year old daughter prepared this for us one evening - she added browned ground beef to this recipe and topped it off with some grated cheddar. It was so delicious!!  She had many kudos from family members!!

This was sooo yummy! I doubled the recipe for appetizers at Thanksgiving dinner, used a small minced onion instead of onion powder, and dusted the top with breadcrumbs. Once I took them out of the oven, they were gone in 5 minutes flat - people LOVED them. Awesome recipe - one to remember!

This recipe was a hit, gone in 10 minutes.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 lbs. of mushrooms.  I took some other reviewers advice and used only 3/4 of the cream cheese called for and added about 3/4 of a cup of breadcrumbs.  I only used 1/2 the cayenne pepper called for and they still had a little kick to them.  I also sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top.  But the best advice was after making the stuffing to put it in a ziploc bag and cut the corner off and squeeze the stuffing into the mushroom caps.  It was so easy this way and you can just throw the mess away.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making it for years to come.

These are WONDERFUL. I like to alternate these with substituting crushed stove top stuffing for the mushroom stems sometimes. VERY YUMMY!!! My husbands favorite. Cream cheese makes it awesome.

These are to die for. I make them quite often. I always buy to packages of mushrooms. It makes A LOT more than 12 mushrooms. The filling is so good, sometimes I eat the left over on a cracker like wheat thins. Yum. I follow the recipe exactly except for maybe a little bit more parmesan cheese and not so much cayenne pepper, just because I don't like it too spicy. Great recipe!

I used 13 mushrroms, that's all that was in my package.  Had left over mixture.  I did what others suggsted.  Aded chives, topped with bread crumbs, ,and also added real bacon bits.   The flavor was outstanding.

I can't even count how many times I made this recipe.  I did add some extra ingredients to it:  some chopped up turkey bacons, used lowfat cream cheese, toss in some feta cheese, also sauteed chopped celery and onions at the beginning with the bacons before adding mushroom stems.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

These mushrooms are fantastic!  To be a little healthier, I used light cream cheese (since the fat-free stuff is so gritty).  The cayenne pepper adds a great kick - they end up pretty spicy, so if you're not a big fan of hot foods, cut the amount in half.

Thanks for a great recipe  :)

Very good, (Unless you make the mistake of eating twelve of them in one sitting as I did)Very good for an appetizer so everyone can have 2 or 3 but are very, very rich.  Will ease up on cream cheese and cayenne next time and eat only in moderation :)

SOOOOO YUMMY!  To change it up a bit, instead of just chopping the stems, I also added some chopped Shitake and Oyster Mushrooms!  They were gone within 15 minutes of serving them.  I absolutely LOVE mushrooms....and I'd have to say this is an EXCELLENT way to serve them.

I used jumbo mushrooms and the filling made enough for 6.  The only thing I did differently was to crush up 8 Caesar Salad Resturant Style Croutons and sprinkled this on before baking.  I used this type as it added more cheese and spices.  I also didn't use the stems and pieces of the mushrooms, just froze them for another day.

I made these for Christmas and again for a party two days later.  Everyone LOVED them and they were easy. I had about 3 dozen mushrooms and still had some stuffing left over.  I followed anothers advice and sprinkled with Italian bread crumbs.  Easy to bring to someone else's house.

I make these for every major holiday, the only thing I like to do different is pre make the stuffing ahead of time, I otherwise pretty much follow the recipe as is.  My family is always requesting it.

This was a great appetizer recipe. The mushrooms become very tender, the filling is excellent with just the right amount of kick from the red pepper. The filling stuffs a lot more mushrooms than indicated - we generously filled about 30 regular-sized white mushroom caps.

There is only one thing I'd change about this recipe.  It calls for 12 mushrooms and I am able to stuff 24-25 with the ingredients listed for 12.  Only increase the # of mushrooms & keep all the other ingredients the same.  THIS IS A WONDERFUL RECIPE!  Lots of praises! Yummy!

These were really yummy.  I doubled the recipe and realized that halving the filling recipe is more than enough to fill the mushrooms.

Excellent!
The cayenne I had was a fresh jar, so it was pretty strong; but since we like it spicey, I think I'll add a little more next time.  Our guests commented that there was just enough "bite" to it with the 1/4 tsp, though.
I added some extra garlic as well as a 6-oz can of crab.  The filling was just the right amount for the giant "gourmet" mushrooms rather than the standard size - well, and extra 4 since there was the crab in the mixture, too.  I can't wait to try stuffing Portabellas with it!

These are great!  I doubled the recipe for a holiday party and had none left over.  I changed the recipe slightly by sprinkling Italian breadcrumbs over the mushrooms just before baking, as suggested by an earlier reviewer.  I also discovered, by accident, that horseradish mayonnaise is a very nice accent to accompany the finished mushrooms.

These were fantastic! I made a single batch of the filling and piped it into about 30 mushrooms. I used a food processor to finely chop the stems, used grated parmesan and sprinkled italian bread crumbs on top. I will definatley make these again! I made these for three occassions over the holidays!

These were yummy (as you can imagine most anything stuffed with cream cheese is), but I found the cream cheese mixture gooey to work with.  I made them for a pot luck and people goobled them up, but I still prefer my old sausage and bread crumb based recipe over this one.

These were wonderful.  I added a few chopped onions.  I also cooked them a lot longer than called for, about 45 minutes.  The next time I make them I will try fat-free cream cheese, because they are sooo fantastic I can't stop eating them!!!!!!!

Nice change of pace from the breaded and seafood stuffed mushrooms. My 4year old loved these. I used lowfat cream cheese. I thought they were too liquidy especially after baking 20min. I will make these again, but may pre-bake the mushrooms so the cream cheese doesnt have to cook too long. I also think I will sprinkle a bit of seasoned bread crumbs on top.

Very good, although I wasn't as impressed with the texture or overall taste as I have been with other stuffed mushroom recipes.  The cheese flavor didn't come out very well, and they seemed a little dry.  (That might have been our fault.)  My boyfriend loved them exactly as they were, though, so I'm sure we will be making them again.

These are excellent. I've made them a few times for various people and everybody absolutely raves about them. It's just the right amount of kick with the cayenne pepper. A must make for those who haven't already. You get a lot of the cream cheese mixture, so I usually buy and stuff more mushrooms than what the recipe calls for.

I found this recipe ages ago, and I make it all the time.  It's absolutely delicious and all my friends ask me to bring these mushrooms to parties.  They're also pretty easy to put together ahead of time, so I can bake them once I get to where they're going.

I have made these for just about every party I have given at my house. Usually, when they hear that bread crumbs are not included, they are a litte aprehensive until they try them, that is.  I never have any leftovers even when I double the recipe.  They are usually the first thing gone. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! My husband (who doesn't like cream cheese) liked these. I had extra stuffing so I froze it for later.  Definitely a hit!

Wonderful recipe!  They are rich but not too creamy with a nice "kick" from the cayenne.  I made them using light cream cheese and about 25 Cremini mushrooms ... still had too much filling!  These received rave ratings at a dinner with my women friends and at a co-ed birthday party I lost half of my platter to the guys on the way out of the oven!  Would definitely make again and again.

A BIG HIT!!! Put these on the table and they go so fast! I too, put some bread crumbs in to make more filler. Now my husband wants me to make them all the time.

I added scallions instead of onion powder, about 1-1/2 cups of crab (sea legs worked well), and 1 Tbl. fine bread crumbs.  They're awesome now!

I made this recipe for New Years Eve and they were gone before all the guests arrived! I didnt actually measure the cayenne pepper or black pepper I "eyed" it and they came out wonderful. My dad is not a big parmesan cheese fan and was going to pass them up but they turned out to be his favorite dish that night! Great recipe thanks

I made these for New Years Eve, and I got some mixed reviews. My husband thought they were kind of bland. They definately could of used either bread crumbs or some other kinds of spices.

These mushrooms were great!  I took people's suggestion to cut some of the cream cheese and to add the crabmeat and bread crumbs and it was great!  I got the huge stuffing mushrooms and it filled about 15 but my boyfriend thought it was still a bit rich so i probably won't overfill them next time.  I'll just have to buy more mushrooms!  It was an excellent recipe!

I made this for New Year's Eve and got lots of rave reviews!!  I would consider either doubling the amount of mushrooms used, or halving the stuffing because it made way too much stuffing for the package of mushrooms I used.

Decent - I did have leftover stuffing. I also had leftover mushrooms! I like them. Little spicy for the rest of the family. I would have liked more garlic and cheese. I will adapt recipe.

The mushrooms were good, however I thought they were a bit on the garlic side.  They were a hit with some of my guests though.  I LOVE garlic but they were too much for me, will cut back on the garlic next time and try again.

I was looking for a easy but deliscious recipe for mushroom and this is it. It really is mouth watering. I think I will add just a little more cayenne pepper, just because I like things alittle spicier than most, but it was a huge hit.

I thought that this recipe was pretty good. It tasted a little to garlicy for me. Next time I think I will omit some of the garlic, but other than that it was great. I also added some mozzarella chesse on top and it was great that way.

I had some extra filling.....I also added some bread crumbs. Very good mushrooms, a good recipe to change to your own tastes, too. I didnt use any cayenne pepper and used extra garlic and cheese. I will make them again and use other variations to the recipe.

I was really dissappointed in this recipie. I normally LOVE all manner of stuffed mushrooms and I love cream cheese, so I thought that this would be great.  I didn't like them at all and ended up throwing them out.  They came out with a funny bitter taste to them.

Delicious and juicy...only problem is they might burn your tongue cause it is impossible to wait for them to cool.

I did a different twist -  I used to very large portabella mushrooms, added a little mozzerella and a can of shrimp - it was very good even as a left over.

These are O SO GOOD! I made them for a dinner party one night and a guest complimented on these mushrooms saying they were better than stuffed mushrooms at a popular Italian restaurant!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These were so easy to make and were the biggest hit of all the things I made for dinner.  One of the guests even asked for the recipe to give to his mom!

I made these for an office holiday party and they were a huge hit.  Four people asked me for the recipe. They look like I slaved for hours but they're so easy to make!

I just had this tonight.  It was fast and easy.  There was only one problem.  The cream cheese is much too rich for this appetizer.  I think putting seafood inside the mushrooms would make it taste much better.
