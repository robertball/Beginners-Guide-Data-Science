This recipe is great! Although I changed a few things... First of all, I grilled salmon filets last night in an orange juice, soy sauce and ginger marinade. I used the leftovers in this dish (rather than smoked salmon). I also used Prego tomato sauce with sausage rather than the tomato paste. I didn't have any onion (unfortunately, because I LOVE onion) so I omitted the onion. I used more pesto than called for and no basil or garlic because the pesto sauce had plenty of both. I added a can of chopped tomatoes and a can of green peas (just because I love them) in with the freshly sliced mushrooms and sauteed them all in olive oil. I then mixed all of the ingredients together (including the pasta and the salmon) in a pot then heated it all on a burner. The turn out? DELICIOUS!

To make sure that this dish turns out delicious, you need to use a good quality pesto, or one you know you like, as it really makes a lot of difference! I did make slight changes to this recipe: I used rucola, added a dash of white wine, added porcini mushroom, and used half the salmon uncooked, the color looks prettier, and it also tastes different. (I used the thin salmon slices used to put on bread).

This was GREAT!  I used a low carb penne pasta.  The only thing I changed was the amount of smoked salmon.  I doubled the amt. called for.  At my grocery they sell smoked salmon tidbit for $5/lb.  They come packaged from the same company making the $16 a pound.  This is be my new favorite dish!

This is a really tasty dish and it takes no time to make.  Also, if you don't liked smoked salmon, you could substitute any kind of salmon.  We grilled and then added it.

the idea of smoked salmon and pesto totally intrigued me, so i had to give it a go.  first time we made it as printed with the exception of doubling the amount of salmon, tasted it, and decided to add a sprinkling of lemon juice and a couple of dashes of tabasco. That helped a lot, but 2nd time round we also replaced the water with white wine, and that turned out to be the prefect combination.  will definitely be making again. :)

Very, very good and simple to make. Next time I'm adding dry white wine instead of water, plus a smidge of fresh-ground pepper and some pine nuts. I used fiori (flower shapes) instead of spaghetti because that's what I had on hand -- I too would use ziti next time.

This dish looked bad, smelled bad and tasted awful. The mix of tomato paste and pesto resulted in a brown unappetizing sauce. My husband and I ate it because we had nothing else but we threw out the leftovers.

I liked this....a healthy change from the tomato cream sauce I usually make with smoked salmon.  Used homemade pesto, added some chopped sun dried tomato and served over whole grain rotini.  With a glass of sauvignon blanc it was a delectable meal.

I had to modify this recipe to give it a 4 stars...I used an entire pkg of smoked salmon.  5 oz is just not enough.  The sauce was very thick, so I needed to use 2/3 cup water and 1/2 cup white wine.   The end result is a very bold taste.  So, if you're looking for a recipe with delicate mild flavours, this is not the recipe for you.    My husband and I both really love smoked salmon and pesto, so that's why it's a 4 stars!

Ok so Husband's a big eater, and I made it just for him with a medium-sized salmon steak, but 5oz of salmon for 4 servings? Eight ounces of pasta? Those are pixie portions! I seared the salmon on both sides in olive oil in a skillet but kept the rest of the ingredient proportions the same. It turned out very fillings and delicious. Maybe if you made it as written but included a green salad and some crusty bread, it would be ok. Otherwise, my dude would have been starving hungry. Thanks though. He enjoyed it.

This recipe was yummy except I added a couple of my own personal favorites to jazz it up: a couple squeezes of lemon juice, a couple of fresh tomatoes, a couple drops of Tabasco, sun dried tomatoes, capers (you must try if you like that flavor!!), fresh ground black pepper and Parmesan cheese. I would recommend maybe adding the smoked salmon last for the final 1-2 mins.(at the very most) of cooking so that it does not get over cooked and get chewy in the pasta, but that could just be my personal taste. Overall this was great, thanks!

This was a good recipe.  The combination of pesto and tomatoes will turn the sauce brown.  So if you want to add tomatoes, make sure to do it at the VERY LAST MINUTE.  I didn't add tomato paste and I added some asparagus (which added some color).

the salmon ruined the dish, it made it taste too fishy and ruined the rest of the dish. Aside from that it was good, i would like to retry it without the fish and see how it turns out

Delicious, but I use fresh salmon, and more than the recipe calls for.  I also use more pesto sauce too.

It needs more flavor.  Also, The basil overshadowed the flavor of the smoked salmon.

The family really liked this one.  I didn't have any mushrooms and substituted pasta sauce for tomato paste and it was still very yummy.  I did also add the smoked salmon near the end, as I didn't want it to get too chewy.

I only used what I had on hand, so I did not follow the recipe exactly, but nonetheless, a very good base and I will definitely make this again. PS: I used fresh tomatoes instead of tomatoe paste.

I'm not sure why everyone loves this. I like smoked salmon. I got a package of it from Costco and used that. I made homemade pesto and it tasted good by itself.  The smoked salmon, however, was extremely salty and the rest of the sauce was bland. I couldn't taste very well the onion, garlic, basil, or tomato! I did have to use tomato sauce instead of tomato paste but is that what really did it? I read another reviewer did that also and still loved the recipe. My husband really didn't like it, and I just thought it was OK .. very boring and the smoke flavor was way too strong, overpowering everything else.

Yikes,what a waste of good, expensive ingrediants. The sauce was very bland and just did not work, tried adding hot pepper and white wine instead of water but to no avail. My husband (a former chef)agrees.

Very good recipe. The only thing is that I kept some pasta water aside because I had a feeling the pesto would be too thick, and I was right. I ended up using a full cup of water. I also used bowtie pasta and mixed it all together in a big bowl. It turned out great and everyone loved it.

I rarely find my self so out of step with the majority of reviewers but I personally did not care for this recipe, neither the taste or visually.  Smoked salmon and pesto just do not go together for me. I might try something similar but will use fresh salmon, fresh tomatoes and white wine.

I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes used 3 times as much salmon.  I also didn't use smoked salmon as it's too salty, I just bought frozen and baked it in olive oil, lemon juice, and a little garlic powder.  That being said, this turned out great.  I was kind of worried about salmon with tomato paste and pesto, but it all works great together.  Thanks!

This was a nice dish.  I agree with others that penne would probably be a better pasta to use.  I did not have any tomato paste so I left that out but I did add fresh diced tomato.  I also agree that you may want to double the amount of salmon as there just wasn't enough.  My husband and son both ate it, so I call that a success!

This was good, but something was missing, possibly sundried tomatoes.  I would also double the amount of smoked salmon.

Rated this a 5 star since both my husband and I and our 4 year old daughter enjoyed it and scraped the bottom of the bowl.   Made as per the recipe except used canned salmon and added it to the sauce just a minute before the sauce was finished so not to have it break into small flakes.  Probably could reduce the amount of sauce next time. I used specialty organic rice/millet pasta for extra nutrition.

I'm a college student and on a budget so we did without the tomato paste, fresh basil, and only used half of an onion.  It turned out amazing! Instead of tomato paste, we diced up heirloom tomatoes and added them right before serving.  I think it would be better over ziti or penne, so that everything can be enjoyed in one bite.  But otherwise, delicious!  mahalo nui loa for this recipe.

This is a delicious recipe! I messed up the quantities when making pesto and it turned out a little watered out so I added a vegetable stock cube for a little more flavor.

I liked this recipe, but I had to change some things. I eliminated the mushrooms as I don't like the taste of them with fish. Another thing I changed was the tomato paste. I used some fresh cherry tomatoes instead and it came out really tasty. An ideal summer recipe!

This was great! I love the fact that it really only did take about 15-20 minutes to cook up everything. We ended up using baby portabello's and a bit more garlic. I added 1/4 cup dry white wine and instead of tomato paste, I put 1/2 can of basil diced tomatoes and added paprika toward the end of the frying to add some spice (It really helped). Overall, a fantastic dish we will use again.

Really good and super easy!

Use water reserved from the cooked pasta to make a thicker sauce.

I also omitted the garlic and just used the fresh basil on top for garnish...you can do without fresh basil in a pinch!

Simply outstanding, we had enough left over for a meal the next day.  I did add a little wine during the process. Excellent recipe, thanks.

I, too, used white wine instead of water and used diced, fire-roasted tomatoes. Also tossed in some sliced black olives and red-pepper flakes. Italian blended cheese on top. Delish!

Yummy, but had to substitute a bit. I only had dried mushrooms, soaked them, then used the mushroom water for extra flavor. Used adobo sauce instead of tomato paste, as we like spicy. Added half -a-lemon juice.  Doubled the salmon because our good friend gives us lots of his fabulous smoked fish. Used penne pasta. It was super good.

This looks pretty unappetizing, but it tasted good. I'm sure it makes a difference which pesto and smoked salmon you use, but ours tasted far more strongly of pesto than of salmon.

My husband and I LOVED this! I made a few changes after reading reviews. 

1) I omitted mushrooms (I do not like them and didn't have any)

2) I used a can (14.5oz) of Hunts Rosemary, garlic & green pepper diced tomatoes and about 1.5 cups of Prego thick & chunky vegetable spaghetti sauce and omitted the water all  instead of the tomato paste (which resulted in a thicker more hearty sauce)

3)  I stovetop cooked 2 lightly seasoned 5oz salmon filets in olive oil instead of cooking with the sauce (I wanted to control how long they cooked). 

4) Lastly, I used penne pasta instead of spaghetti because that's what I had on hand. 

Once everything cooked satisfactorily separately I combined it all, making sure the pasta was coated with sauce. I topped mine with Parmesan cheese. I accompanied it with spinach cooked in white wine and garlic knots (bread). My husband made a point to ask me to include this dish in our meal rotation!

This is one of my most favorite pasta dishes.  I added sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil and white wine instead of water.  This was a hit with my whole family.  You've got to give it a try!

I liked it but thought the tomato paste was a bit much.  Maybe leave it out or replace with something else.

This was a fabulous way to use up smoked salmon! I also had some cilantro pesto to use, so I subbed that for the basil pesto. Cilantro and salmon are a great match! As I always, I tripled the amount of garlic. I don't like mushrooms, so I left them out, but then the sauce was a little too concentrated at the end. I added some frozen chopped broccoli instead and it worked perfectly! I was worried about the flavor but it complemented nicely.
