Love this! But I tweaked it a bit. Did not add allspice and cut nutmeg in half. The allspice I didn't have and the nutmeg is not my favorite so I always cut it. Next time I would pop it in the oven to finish cooking the middle.

Nice flavor and for a person who doesn't care for syrup (me) this is just sweet enough.  I used high quality pure vanilla bean paste as I don't care for artificial vanilla.  A quick buzz with the immersion blender blends the eggs, milk, spices and brown sugar together easily.  Thanks!

I served this to my family on our family trip.  More than half of them came back for seconds.  The ONLY thing I did differently was I only soaked the bread for a few seconds on each side because I didn't want it to be too sweet.  I served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream with a side of crispy bacon.  Oh, and of course syrup!  This meal was a big hit with my family.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

This is a simple but wonderfully flavorful french toast recipe. It was light and beautiful and tasted amazing! The only thing I did differently was I replaced the nutmeg with mace because I couldn't find my grinder for my nutmeg. It was so yummy.

Very easy and delicious French toast recipe. As others have said, it's just sweet enough that you don't need syrup or dusting sugar.
