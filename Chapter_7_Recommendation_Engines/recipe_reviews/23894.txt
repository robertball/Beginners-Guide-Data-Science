This was awesome. I read the review about it not getting thick and mine was not thick in the stated time so I boiled it for a couple minutes. The longer I boiled it the thicker it got. After it set a little it was a nice thick, creamy syrup. We all enjoyed it on french toast and my mom said it was wonderful on ice cream. Just watch it when it boils and constantly whisk it as it would probably burn easily. Yum! Would love to try this on apple dumplings or apple crisp. Thanks Wanda

We used this on Pumpkin Pancakes and it was excellent. The perfect fall breakfast. I would recommend this combination of pancakes and syrup with a little powdered sugar on top. yummmmmmy

This was pretty good.  I think it should be called a sauce instead of syrup, but that didn't stop me from totally enjoying it on Veronica's Apple Pancakes.  It kind of reminded me of the sauce you sometimes see on bread pudding.  You really can't go wrong with butter and cream! :)  I too boiled it a few minutes and let it thicken while it cooled off.  It wasn't too runny at all.

This was NOT good at all. I made it this morning and it turned out salty, although I can't imagine why, and never thickened. It had the consistency of a biscuit gravy, and tasted bad. I won't make this again.

I made this to go with the Almond French toast also from this site and it was awesome.  Very rich and delicious.  It took me about ten minutes for the syrup to thicken, but other than that followed the recipe excatly as stated.  I actually made it the night before, and after being in the refrigerator it became VERY thick (like butter or margarine!).  It would have made a delicious spread, but I microwaved it until it softened and thinned out.  Absolutely yummy!

Absolutely delicious!  I used it as suggested with Veronica's Apple Pancakes.  I did not have the maple flavoring (thought I had it, but couldn't find it) so I used pure vanilla extract - delicious.  I will use this recipe for banana crepes and french toast too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - a real keeper.

This was awesome!  I followed ingredient list-only I microwaved instead of heating in a saucepan.  The results were still 5 star, and a nice thick syrup.  My family loved this.  Thank you for a keeper recipe!

Very simple to put together in the morning before breakfast. I did add a little nutmeg and a little more maple extract. Not as good as the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, but pretty tasty. Super rich. I served it with the Cinnamon Griddle Cakes, which was a little overkill, I think.

This was delicious!  At first I was concerned with the heavy cream and how it would taste.  I halved the recipe, added almond extract (didn't have vanilla) and 1 extra teaspoon of brown sugar.  Served them with good old fashion pancake recipe from this site.  Kids loved them for breakfast before school.

Wonderful flavor.  I served this over pecan waffles and got RAVE reciews from my family.  I would have liked for it to be a little thicker though.  This may have happened because I had to substiture whole milk for a portion of the cream.  But other than that it was wonderful!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars instead of the 4 that I have in mind simply because I don't want to contribute to lowering the overall average star rating of this recipe (doesn't have a lot of reviews yet) and I'd like people to try it. However I would suggest adding AT LEAST 50% more sugar to this syrup (maybe more depending on your taste) as it wasn't sweet enough for me with the initial 3 tablespoons(yes i packed the Brown sugar). I added about 50% more maple extract as well and a little vanilla just to MY taste. This syrup goes EXCELLENTLY with "Chuck's Molasses French Toast" from this site. However the entire recipe  probably only yields about 4-5 servings at best instead of the 8. Extremely high in calorie meal (all of that cream and butter) so don't make it often unless you want to die at 40 but once a month or so wont hurt. TRY THIS RECIPE AND YOU WONT REGRET IT!.

It was a little thick but it went very well with the sweet potato pancakes that I made. It was still yummy a week later when I reheated it.

Is was a little dissappointed in the final product. The flavor was good but I boiled for 6 minutes trying to thicken and it just never happened.

Excellent.  I added a bit of vanilla with the maple extract, also.  I cooked just a bit longer than the recipe called for, and the consistency was perfect--served it with french toast made with whole-grain, raisin-pecan artisan bread, and it was a big hit.  This one is a keeper.

It didn't thicken as much as it could have, so I added a pinch of cornstarch but it was amazing with the Apple Raisin Cakes from this site.

This was good and different! What I liked was the creaminess and I actually liked that it wasn't as sweet as maple syrup (next time I might add just a LITTLE extra brown sugar to make it a teensy bit sweeter. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to get thicker than it did, and I think I would have preferred it thicker so next time I will try out using some corn starch or maybe boiling it longer, or something like that.

What a great change from using maple syrup on pancakes. I didn't have heavy cream but I did have buttermilk from the pancakes I was making. Using my ultra scientific method of guestimation, I added about another TBS of brown sugar to make sure the buttermilk didn't hide the sweetness. It turned out good, next time I'll make sure I have heavy cream on hand.

Flavor good, consistency- not!  Really, it was pretty difficult to find it appetizing.  I did add more sugar because it wasn't quite sweet enough.  Won't make again.

This is absolutely delicious and a preferable alternative to manufactured (i.e. not pure) maple syrup.  I had no heavy cream on hand, so I used ice cream instead and melted it in a saucepan.  It worked wonderfully.  Just make sure not to let the mixture boil if you make it this way.

Awesome!  I accidentally added too much flavoring so I thinned it out with more cream and it was divine.

This is a very good syrup.  It will thicken up as it cools.  My only complaint, and it's strictly a personal preference, is that it is not sweet enough for me.  It is very creamy and delicious though.

Loved This! Not as sweet as maple syrup. My kids mixed the two, and thought it was delicious.

Wow, I made this syrup today to go with Veronica’s Apple Pancake recipe I also found here on the site.  This was a real winner for me.  It’s so easy (not that making syrup is a hard thing to do) and tastes delicious!  The butter in the syrup complemented the pancakes perfectly.  This is definitely staying in my recipe collection and I know I will be making it often.

This is a really good recipe. I did add 2 extra tablespoon of brown sugar and doubled the cinnamon. Lastly, I cooked it for about 12 minutes and by then it had thickened to the perfect consistency. It was such a hit, my daughter asked if she could pack pancakes and cinnamon creme in her lunch!

So delicious!! I didn't have maple extract so I used Vanilla as a substitute. This syrup is great. Definitely glad I made it.

Don't forget to make the pancakes! This syrup is so good that you might want to eat it right from the pan. It is like the awesome syrup at our favorite breakfast bakery. Creamy and sweet, perfect on pancakes, french toast and lots of desserts. I boiled it an extra two minutes to make it thicker.

This was a good sauce and had a nice flavor. I substituted Mexican vanilla for the maple extract just because we're not maple fans. Ours never really got syrupy even after boiling it for quite a while though. We used it as a topping for pumpkin pancakes, and they were very nice together. I made another batch using both this sauce and a cream cheese topping, and the pancakes turned out delicious, like a decadent cinnamon roll. We'll make this one again.
