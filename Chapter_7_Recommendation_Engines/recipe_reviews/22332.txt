I sprinkled the dry spices on the pineapple, drank the rum, and called it a day. (wink wink)

Easy and everyone was impressed.  I used orange juice instead of rum and 1 Tbsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the others because it was all I had.  Delicious.

Oooh good!  I'll be making this again.  I marinated the pineapple in a ziplock bag in the fridge and "grilled" it in the oven.  Delicious, and good with ice cream.

Made this twice now. Oddly enough the pineapple that looked the most burnt tasted the best!  The first time I actually dropped the cloves for more cinnamon and used dark rum but only because I didn't have any cloves and the first bottle of rum I found was Meyer's. :)  It was requested of me again so second round, same rum, doubled EVERYTHING because I was using a plastic container and I wanted to have plenty to let it sit in.  I even poured what didn't soak into the pineapple onto it while it was on the grill.  Oh Man!  Next time I will double again except for the cloves...they were too strong.  Still awesome though!

Delicious!!! I left out the rum - as I was serving it to my children. Instead I substituted some fruit punch and only used brown sugar and cinnamon. Fantastic! Super seet and super juicy!

This was excellent.  All I had in the pantry was Myers Original Dark rum so I used that and boy howdy was this ever good. The rum was not to strong after cooking and it had a nice carmelized glaze to it.  I served this with grilled pork chops and strawberry spinach salad from this site and it was a hit.  I will make this again and again.

I omitted the rum because I didn't have any and grilled it on my George Foreman grill at 400F. (my grill has temp control)  I served it with a big scoop of French Vanilla ice cream.

Yum!

gooo-oood!
i didn't marinate it, just fried the spices up in a saucepan with canned, cubed  pineapple (omitting the rum and just using a little juice from the can) and served it over a spinach salad. yummy. i will definitely make it again!

We followed the recipe, and it turned out delicious! Put over ice cream, poured additional rum on the ice cream and ate it all. Yummy!

Incredible!! I made wedges instead of slices and added a little lime infused olive oil to the marinade. Served it with grilled chicken and coconut rice. It was heavenly!!

What a delightfully refreshing dessert for a hot summer's day or a cold winter's night - no matter what the season, this is a flavorful treat. Don't skimp and use canned pineapple, it simply does not come out as well as the real, fresh thing. I added a bit more brown sugar to the marinade so that when I grilled them, they would caramelize a little more, and I kept brushing more of the marinade on as they grilled. If you can marinate them overnight, I suggest doing so because they'll soak up even more of that yummy marinade. Really, a very easy and very tasty way to "spice up" a pineapple into a pleasing dessert.

I added a chili paste (Brand: Aha!) to add depth to the flavor but it was too much with the cloves - next time I would just use the cinnamon and the chili paste - and I would go light on the cinnamon.  My husband also grilled them a touch too long.  I used the leftovers to make the "Pineapple Upside-Down Cake VII" on this website.

I have to say I left out the ginger and cloves. I also have to say I have always hated cooked fruit. BUT I recently discovered a taste for pineapple and this is the very first recipe that I cooked with pineapple. Loved the smell...I could only imagine now what the cloves and ginger would add - but I was playing it safe. So so so good. Thanks for sharing!

Not as good as I had hoped.  Although the pineapple was sweet and I followed the recipe exactly, it was disappointing.  It is similar to Bananas Foster, but not as good.

Made this exactly as described, with Bacardi, and even the kids loved them. I didn't put extra marinade on theirs, of course...

We finally bought a new grill and have been grilling everything and anything...These were great! We made these kid friendly and substituted the rum with OJ. Can't wait to try these again using the adult friendly version. Served them over vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the recipe.

1st, this is excellent!  Thanks Michael. 2nd, having made this several times, I tweaked the recipe to fit what we like plus variations.  However, this was kept on a paper copy and it was lost.  Lesson learned – use the “My Notes” for permanent retention.

BBQ'd Pineapple

Very nice side.  Steve made this for a larger group, so he doubled it. The good thing about this one, you can cheat and halve/quarter the rings on the buffet table at the last minute if you find you have to stretch it!!!.  Lots of inquiries on this one.    He made it as written, no changes or tweaks. It was both a hit and --GONE!

We also thought the ones that looked burnt on the grill tasted the best. We also used the same recipes to marinate chicken breasts and loved it!

Excellent treat and easy recipe.   Rum can be left in even for children because alcohol is cooked off immediately.

Fantastic!  Made exactly like the recipe said, marinated the pineapple for about 5 hours and they were delicious.  Served with vanilla ice- cream and everyone asked for seconds. I will make again.

My husband loves this recipe but I did make a few changes. I didn't use any nutmeg and cut the pineapple into 1 inch thick pieces.

I used orange juice as suggested by one other reviewer. Excellent dessert. My kids loved it. I might adjust the amount of cloves next time - just a little strong. We will make this again and again. We love to BBQ in the summer.

Personally I wasn't a huge fan of these... they were good but I think I would have just been fine with grilling the pineapple plain (which I love) and drinking the rum.... but my dad and other seemed to really like them and like the tartness of the pineapple that the marinade seemed to bring out... overall I guess its not a bad recipe if you want to transform the pineapple a little bit.... I did substitute spiced rum for regular because that is all I had so that could have made the difference too...

Very good!  I love bbq'd pineapple so I really wanted to try this.  It's getting cold here now, though, so I really didn't want to fire up the grill.  I just fried them on the stovetop instead--not quite the same, but close enough.  The flavors are best experienced when the pineapple is hot--after cooling, the cloves are a bit too much.  It would be silly, though, to rate less for that when I think the recipe is intended for the pineapple to be warm or room temp.  I cut in wedges instead of rings--personal preference--and they were delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good flavor, I tried it two ways.  The first time I only used the dry ingredients with a 1/4 cup pineapple juice.  That was pretty good.  The second time I used the rum as the recipe states, that was equally as good.  I usually hate the flavor of alcohol, but this wasn't strong at all.

We were all excited about this, but it didn't turn out that great.  We took it to a pot luck-type event, and no one complimented.   Maybe the pineapple wasn't that sweet, and maybe it's cuz my husband grilled it (and not me) but it certainly did not meet our expectations.

EXCELLENT!   This was the hit!  It will be finding it's way to my grill regularly.  So easy to make and only minutes to grill.  No changes are needed.  Thank you Michael Fischer for sharing!

I used aluminum foil to cook the pineapple on the grill and did not get the burnt ones everyone raved about.    The flavors were very good and it was a great enhancement to the teriyaki chicken I made which also called for pinapple juice.

I've been looking for a recipe for fresh grilled pineapple, and this is a good one. I didn't have any rum so I substituded peach schnapps. It left just a hint of the peach flavor, yum.

This was very tasty, hubby dumped out the rest of the marinade before I had a chance to tell we still needed it for the sauce.  We didn't get the full extent of the recipe but it was still very good.

I was thrilled to see a recipe for pineapple that wasn't upside-down in a cake... I was even more thrilled with the flavor of these grilled delicacies!!  We grilled them along side some Thursday night hot dogs and transformed our tube steak dinner into a festive summertime soiree!!!

Really quite good. Wasn't exactly the tropical side dish I was looking for - but my fault, I should have known better once I read the ingredients. It tasted like a wonderful fall dessert with a sweet tangy twist.

I liked it but didn't love it. I think the cinnamon and cloves were a bit too much. If I try this again I may cut down on them and/or use more rum.

While I love the concept, our family thought the marinade was too heavy on the cloves.  Will probably cut them in half next time.  Also, recipe called for 1/4 cup rum, but does not specify what kind.  I used a dark spiced rum as that is what I had on hand.  Again, it might have been the cloves, but found this a little too overpowering for the pineapple.  Will probably try a lighter dark rum next time.  Not going to give up on this one.  Love the concept, just needs some tweaks in my personal opinion.

My husband loved this and fresh pineapples jump into his grocery cart whenever he shops.
