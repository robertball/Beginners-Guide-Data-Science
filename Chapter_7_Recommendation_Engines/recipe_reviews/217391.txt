OK  I did something wrong!!  I followed the directions exactly but maybe I misunderstood.  I made the red velvet cake part in the 2 pans and then poured half of the cheesecake mixure over each and then realized that the cake part would be baking again.  Of course, it burned so after cooling I had to slice off almost the entire cake part from each.  Did I somehow misunderstand these directions?

Ok so I made this cake because, my boyfriend loved the one at the cheese cake factory and wanted it for his birthday I could not afford to buy it so I made it. He was in love and so was everyone at the party. I did change one thing however I doubled the red velvet cake recipe and used one 10 1/2'' pan and one 9 1/2''  pan it was perfect and it layered great. I also made my own cream cheese frosting and frosted the sides and then put white and dark chocolate shavings on the sides and top. The cakes obviously had to cook longer but I just watched them to see when done. With the changes everyone got a decent piece and it fed over 20 people. Like I said it was a hit my sister requested I make it for her bridal shower....

I loved this recipe in that the taste was wonderful!  Family and friends all raved about it.  I gave it 4 stars because the instructions (at least for me) were vague.  It wasn't clear that I was to pour the cheesecake batter on top of the finished cake halves.  Also, I felt as though the bottom of the cake got way over-done and was tough.  I will make this recipe again, but when I put it in the oven the 2nd time, I will raise the rack in the oven one space.

I just made the cake part due to the uneasiness of the vague directions and knew doing this method would not be good but, I did however, made the red velvet cake (very good) but I would have changed the directions of putting wet ingredients first, then slowly add dry ingredients for better blending and not just whisk everything.  But still came out well.  Then I made Breakstone's New York Cheesecake-fully baked, layered it with white chocolate frosting-the combination was TO DIE FOR!! I still give this a four since the outcome was overall a smash hit!

I wondered how you could bake a cake twice (once to bake and once while the cheesecake sets) without it being very dry.  Answer?  I can't.  The cake was NOT moist but very dry and having cheesecake on top did not help.  I think the recipe is flawed because I'm not a novice baker and I followed the recipe verbatim and it turned out poorly.

This turned out fabulous! Such vibrant color. It pretty much just flew off the plate.

Okay I was looking for a way to combine red velvet cake with cheesecake and this recipe is it!!! I was a little nervous about baking a cake "twice" as some of the others who left reviews were. If you are also nervous I would suggest placing a small pan/bowl of water in the bottom of your oven and everything will be fine! I've made this recipe twice and once it won a work contest! This recipe is a hit!

There was more red velvet cake than cheesecake, I think the cheesecake layer should have been thicker.  The cheesecake layer was excellent, the red velvet layer wasn't very good - I would recommend using a red velvet  cake mix instead.

One of the best deserts I have ever made. My fiancé said she likes red velvet cake, and cheesecake, and this just knocked it out of the park. I cut everything in half, and only made one, but that’s was way easy. This is a new favorite dessert.

Everyone that ate this said it was amazing. I'm not sure why people think the instructions are vague, it seemed straight forward.

I will not fully bake the red velvet cake before adding the cream cheese.. it ended up too dry.. But I saved it with home made vanilla butter cream frosting. But I inverted the cake first so I could frost the red velvet cake .. everyone like it.
