10.16.19  What a good recipe, liked everything about it.  Have been trying to use my air fryer more, and this recipe’s a keeper.  Nice break from traditional deep-fried coconut shrimp, and they cooked perfectly at a total of 6 minutes.  The shrimp had nice presentation, were crispy with a very tender bite, and I wouldn’t change a thing in this recipe.  I didn’t use the dipping sauce this time, rather used a thin-downed version of Bahamian Marmalade Barbecue Sauce, another recipe on this site.  Recipes like this are making me an air fryer convert!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Really good recipe!  I didnt make the dipping sauce, but it turns out that i didnt need it. It was good by itself.  I will definitely be putting this recipe in my dinner rotation, especially since my toddler loved it.

YUMMY! Best coconut shrimp my husband and I have ever had. Mixed up some apricot preserves with horseradish for a spicy dipping sauce!?

Made it for super bowl party and everyone loved it. The only thing I did different was to make a mango dipping sauce instead of the honey and lime, but will try that one next time.

I was a bit skeptical but this turned out wonderful. I didn’t make the dip since we made tacos with the shrimp. Great dinner with a 5 star rating from my husband (who reserves five star rating for the best of the best!).

Super good! Easy to make! The honey sauce is a bit to thin for me with those measurements. Next time I think I’ll try less lime, but I also used honey straight from a bee farm. So maybe that’s why the consistency was like that!

Quick, easy and tasty. Did not make any changes and none are needed. The only thing I did different was to make my own dipping sauce which is a Pina Colada sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!
