I decided to cut it lengthwise because slicing it in rounds would've been way too small. This required it to be cooked a little longer because of the thickness. I also added garlic salt and cracked pepper. I only gave it four stars because of you variations I had to do.

I used fresh parsley instead of the dry and these were pretty good. I do think they could have benefited from another spoon of pizza sauce over the pepperoni but that is just my opinion. I also added more cheese to one of my "pizza's" after pulling them from the oven and I liked what that added too. Overall good dish but I plan to play around with it more. Sliced black olives would be a nice touch too.
