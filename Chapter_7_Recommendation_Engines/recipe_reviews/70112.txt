The secret to this recipe is to not serve it right away! I tasted it on the stove when done and thought too much OJ.
I served breakfast about an hour later and reheated the syrup and the flavor totally changed it was ALL BLUEBERRY! Flavors just needed to settle. Wonderful recipe!!!

This was delicious.  Made for a neighborhood waffle party and it was devoured.  Wouldn't change a thing except to make it a couple of days before so the flavors have a chance to marry.  Wonderful sauce!

Okay, I originally rated this a 4 but when I tasted it 2 days later it was amazing. Very orangy in the beginning but flavors really blended. Used frozen blueberries, strawberries, and rasberries. I have enough to feed an army right now but I will freeze and use next month for family reunion.

First of all, I substituted splenda for the white sugar to make it a little bit more healthy.  This sauce is great on just about everything, but my personal favorite is whole-wheat buttermilk pancakes.

This has become a staple at my house.  We make it almost every weekend to put over waffles or pancakes.  I do use frozen blueberries when I can't get fresh.  Do not freeze this recipe, it will thaw with a funky texture!

This was not my favorite and I know I would have liked it even less had I followed directions exactly.  Looking over the recipe, it appeared the blueberry flavor was going to be lost in orange, almond and cinnamon - TOO much going on here - and for me, these were competing rather than complementary flavors as well.  I reduced the orange juice by half (while at the same time reducing the cornstarch to  compensate) and it still had more orange flavor than I would have preferred for a BLUEBERRY sauce.  I eliminated the almond extract and cinnamon altogether.  Finally, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and the sauce was plenty sweet - an extra quarter cup would have been cloyingly sweet. So...by eliminating the cinnamon and almond extract, and reducing the amounts of both the sugar and the orange juice this would be greatly improved - but then it wouldn't be this recipe.

Absolutely wonderful...I made a few minor changes...I only used 3/4 cup orange juice,(and added 1/4 cup water to make a total of 1 cup) because the juice I used is quite strong(Tropicana)and I only used half the cornstarch and water mixture because I like my sauces quite runny.  In the end I got wonderful reviews for this sauce which I used with a lemon cheesecake...Yummy!!

The almond flavor enhances the blueberry flavor--amazing!  I like about a tablespoon less corn starch.  I have also made this recipe with lemonade instead of orange juice.

This turned out perfectly!  I doubled the recipe and served it after a dinner party over basic cheesecake.  It is the perfect consistency and DELICIOUS!  I used frozen wild blueberries.  YUM!  I'm glad I doubled the recipe so we have some for pancakes!  Thank you!

This sauce is outstanding! It tasted wonderful on my pancakes, rich and sweet. really liked how thick it was. This seems like it would be great on cheesecake and I'm going to try that tomorrow with the cheesecake I just made. MMMMMMM!

This is good, but next time I will use less orange juice.  I could taste it more than I prefer.  I only used 2 tablespoons cornstartch and skipped out on the almond extract/cinnamon.  Great consistency.

Nice easy sauce.  I was concerned about the overall sweetness level, so based on reviews and my own thoughts I reduced the OJ to 1/2 C and the sugar to 1/4 C.  Finally, I reduced the cornstarch to just 2 Tbsp.  The result was not too sweet, not too tart, not too thin, not too thick.  The cinnamon at the end was a nice touch.  A keeper!

This recipe is "LICK THE PLATE CLEAN!"  I made it just as is so I could do an honest review (I hate it when people change the recipe totally, then review it) Love it, Love it.  At the end of cooking and letting it set about 10 minutes to let flavors blend, I LOVE blueberries so I cheated & add an extra 2 cups, just to give each serving more berries each....(I used frozen berries)

Excellent!  My guest and family thought this tasted outstanding.  Served it over pancakes.  They all could taste the OJ but it complimented the blueberries wonderfully.  I have extra that I will put on cheesecake squares.

I prepared this for my son's 16th birthday to top a cheesecake. Everybody absolutely loved it! I personally do not care for blueberries but I couldn't resist the smell, I had to try it. Wonderful flavor! Yes, I prepared it two days in advance as was suggested.  Delicious!!! I will never purchase another "can" of blueberry pie filling!

Awesome recipe!!! I didn't have OJ so I use Berry juicy juice (its what I had). I also added a few more blueberries and made it a point to smash about half (But that's a matter of personal preference!).  Didn't need the water or cornstarch.

This also froze WONDERFULLY! Just as delicious after freezing!

Perfect.  Better than others i've cooked in the past.  Can't wait to try again tomorrow after it's married all the ingredients as other reviewers noted.  Used with Easy Whipped Cream from this site and crepes that I got from another recipe blog.  TFS

Fabulous!!!!!  Made it to top french toast.  This would be wonderful over cheesecake, pancakes, mixed with oatmeal, on top of ice cream.  So many uses!  I didn't have OJ so I used cranberry juice, otherwise made it as instructed (halved recipe).  It is perfect.  Thank you!!!

So good.  Didn't have enough OJ so used what i had (oj, berry juice and apple sauce).  Sub'd almond for vanilla extract.  Also, added juice of one fresh lemon.  Quadrupled the recipe and using filling for tarts, spread and pie!  Really yummy!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. If anyone doesn't like this then they're probably too used to the grossly preserved, artificial blueberry sauce. This is healthier and fresh!

Great recipe-I changed a few things though-used apple juice instead of orange (some reviews said the orange was too strong but the apple was perfect) and I only used about 1 1/2 T of cornstarch (i wanted it to be a little runny) and I omitted the cinnamon and almond afraid it would take away the fresh blueberry flavor.  My husband said this was better than IHOP!

I doubled the recipe to have enough sauce for a cheesecake and have some left over for pancakes. It turned out wonderful. My husband wanted some for ice cream topping, my daughter just wanted to eat it warm. It is simple and quick to make. I used frozen blueberries, and skipped the almond extract and cinnamon. Definitely a keeper...

This is one recipe I anticipated using this year since trying it last year.  I could hardly wait for blueberry season to come again!  So, so good!  It is more like a topping over dessert rather than a topping for pancakes but for a treat it's yummy.  It kept well several days in an air-tight container in the fridge.  I would bet it freezes well also and I will have to try that.

I used Cranberry/Pomegranate juice instead of orange and doubled the cinnamon for a more holiday-themed flavor, and to cut the sweetness a bit (I was pairing it with a pound cake). It worked out great. 

Overall this is a great recipe, I highly recommend it.

This is great.  I make it with all kinds of different fruit.  We had it this morning for breakfast.  I made it with frozen strawberry, peach, mango, pinapple mix. Awesome!

******I just wanted to add an update to my original post.  I'm still in love with this recipe, but now I have even more reason to be so.  I have discovered what a wonderful jam topping this makes!  I love it on my morning wheat toast & also agree with lau57 that it's a wonderful topping for What a Dish's whole grain waffles that I often make.  I did only use 2 T of cornstarch the second time making this (I like this consistency much better) and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I didn't notice any difference in the taste so why not save a few calories here and there?****** The flavor of this sauce is out of this world.  I didn't change a thing.  However, I was looking for more of a syrup texture so the next time I will probably decrease the cornstarch to 2 tablespoons.  Thanks ISYBEL for a scrumptious recipe!

This recipe is absolutely WONDERFUL!!! I used this recipe for a Mardi Gras pancake brunch we held at our church.  I have never had so many compliments, and it was so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly. For those of you who have commented on too much orange juice taste, I do not know what kind you used, but I used Minute Made frozen concentrate pulp free (follow directions on can) and it worked great. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, I doubt I will ever use pancake syrup again. If I could give this 10 stars, I would!!!

The recipe is so fast and easy. I use frozen blueberries and ease up on the OJ and don't add the almond extract or cinnamon ... I'm a blueberry purist.:) It is perfect on waffles and if there are leftovers, it is wonderful over ice cream. yum!

I made this a day ahead and it was fabulous!! I couldn't get enough of it on my pancakes!  I wanted to cut down on the sugar content a little, so I only used 1/2 C orange juice and 1/2 C sugar...still wonderful:)

Very yummy!  I found that this tastes best if made a day or two in advance so that the flavors can meld.  I followed the recipe exactly - the only note I would have to add is that I used bottled Tropicana orange juice, which I usually drink for breakfast.  There was some confusion as to whether this was supposed to be the juice from a fresh orange or bottled, because the bottled is much sweeter.  I made it with the bottled, and while it was sweet, liked the flavor exactly as it was.  Will make again!

I feel there is too much cornstarch for this recipe, and the amount of liquid needs to be adjusted. It was extremely thick and coagulated upon cooling. I had to thin it out with water and then it was just nasty. I was disappointed. If you make it, I would suggest ONE tablespoon of cornstarch, more berries, and 1 cup liquid IN TOTAL.

This was the very first time for me to make fruit sauce and it turned out so good!  I chose this recipe because those ingredients looked very patissier-like :) I gave this sauce to my friend for her birthday with "Chantal's NY Cheesecake" in this site.  She said it was like served at a cafe!  What a nice compliment!

Love this sauce!
It was quick, easy with all on hand ingredients, but with a slightly more adult flavor that I do believe kids will like too.
I will keep this recipe handy for next years fresh picked blueberries!

I LOVE when I can make a recipe as written and it comes out PERFECT!  I followed this recipe exactly - didn't change a thing - and it was absolutely delicious! and beautiful! and quick!  It turned the Heavenly Angel Food Cake with Fluffy White Frosting (from this site & Taste of Home) I made for my Uncle's Birthday into something EXTRAORDINARY.  Thank you!

I make this constantly.  I substitute apple juice for orange juice.  Then the citrus flavor isn't over powering if you want to serve it right away.  I rarely add the almond, and lately haven't even added the cinnamon, as it tastes good with just the blue berry flavoring.  super yum!

Very good flavor, it is very thick but the directions say to add water to thin down to desired consistency.  I agree it is more of a pie filling, but we have enjoyed it on waffles and ice cream.  Will try another recipe for more of a syrup consistency. Recommend to make ahead of time for flavors to meld together.

Let me start by saying that I DO NOT LIKE BLUEBERRIES! This sauce is not only incredibly quick & easy but it UNBLIEVABLY GOOD! I've been sneaking spoonfuls & dipping pieces of homemade shortcake in it all morning. This will def be a repeat, ugh, soooooo good!!!

OMG! This was the best topping for a yellow cake I made from scratch. Our company raved over it. I didn't have OJ so I used 1 squeezed orange with the pulp and 1/2 squeezed lemon. That equaled approx 1/2 cup so I added an extra 1/2 cup water. The sauce would be great over pancakes too. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made this for the topping over pancakes but I felt that the almond essence was overpowering. I would reduce the amount or better yet leave it out all together. Also the amount of cornstarch was way too much.The "sauce" came out gloppy-like.  I re-made this sauce my way and it came out perfect.I used 3 cups blueberries, 1/3 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup sugar and 4 tsp cornstarch

Delicious and EASY.  I made changes...had tons of fresh blueberries so used about 6 cups, no orange juice but did have 1 orange so used the zest from the entire orange in a cup and a half of water, only used 1/2 sugar...which was plenty...and added vanilla instead of almond, as I didn't have it.  Cooked all together about 30 minutes, just let it simmer for awhile.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  PERFECT!!!  Served it over pancakes and so glad I have more left for ice cream tonight.  EASY!!!  YUMMY!!!

I found it very difficult to locate a decent blueberry syrup/sauce recipe.  I was relieved when I found this one.  It is excellent with blueberry waffles. I am glad I canned 18 jars of it!

This was delicious! I used fresh black raspberries, as that is what I had on hand. The subtle taste of orange juice complemented the berries perfectly! However, I think I will decrease the sugar a little bit next time. I look forward to making this with all types of berries.

We liked this, gave low rating because didn't follow recipe exactly. Had peach/mango juice on hand, so used that. Forgot to add sugar, added 2 tsp afterward. Was pretty thick, added another 1/4 c. of water. Also used on waffles with a little syrup and was fabulous!

Wonderful, warm sauce!  Not too sweet and not too tart.  Tasted great with pancakes.  Can't figure out what to do with the rest of it...makes a lot!  Very good recipe and super-easy.

This is the second Blueberry Sauce I've tried off this website and it is far superior to the other.  I actually used frozen mixed berries, because I had them on hand, left out the almond extract and used a Peach Mango juice instead of OJ.  Delicious!  Thank you for the new recipe.

Easy to make and can be modified to fit your taste.

I added pineapple juice instead of orange juice and it still tasted great.

I made this for cheesecake.  It's a beautiful color, nice and thick, easy to make, impressive!  I used cheap almond extract though, and you can tell.  It would be way better with high quality almond.

I followed this recipe substituting Spenda for the sugar.  It was fantastic!  Spoon some over a scoop of low fat ricotta cheese for a low calorie and healthy dessert.  It was just was this dieter needed for a sweet treat!

I made this sauce for cheesecake this weekend.  It was delicious.  I didn't have any orange juice...actually I only had about 1/2 C of apple juice in the house, so I used that and subbed water for the rest of the juice.  I used less cornstarch (2 tsp) because I didn't want it to be too thick.  I didn't make any other changes - I think you'd be missing a level of this sauce if you omit the cinnamon or almond extract.  I received several compliments and it was heaven over the cheese cake!

Excellent. We served this over angel food cakes and another night over vanilla ice cream. It is better if you make it ahead and let it sit.

I made this sauce the day before I made pancakes. As I heated up this syrup, it was so thick. 3TBLS of corn starch is way too much.  I had to keep adding water to get the right consistency I wanted. The taste is very good! My family enjoyed having blueberry syrup on their pancakes! This recipe is a keeper!

Fantastic! I looked this recipe up to use up frozen blueberries and I'm so glad I did. I cut the sugar by maybe two tablespoons. Because I have an almond allergy I used vanilla extract. The thickness is perfect for spooning onto pancakes and such and I'm going to buy vanilla ice cream soon to try it on. Super yum!

This sauce was perfect!  I did alter it a bit with some substitutions.  I didn't have orange juice but did have lime juice so I used 1 cup of that instead.  I also used vanilla instead of almond extract.  I thought the sour lime juice blended perfectly with the tartness of the blueberries and the added vanilla took the edge off from being too tart.  I am excited to try this again with other juices!  Pomegranate, raspberry, grape...the possibilities are endless!

Love this! I took the advice of others and let it sit for a good hour. I added a little bit more almond extract cause I love it a lot lol. It tasted wonderful and was a huge hit with the family. Served it with hot waffles.

too much cornstarch.  I even tried it a couple days later and didn't care for it.  I will stick with water sugar and blueberries.

I made half recipe (only two of us). I didn't have OJ so I used 1/2 tsp of Orange extract with 1/2C water. Used berries I froze when they were on sale. Only 2 tblsp sugar. Didn't have almond extract but will use next time. 1 T cornstarch mixed with 1 T of water was all I needed. I didnt want it too thick; more of a syrup for waffles and I did mash up the berries while cooking. I agree with others re: much better giving flavors time to meld together and I could only taste faint hint of orange which I liked. I think this is very good but it would have been way too sweet with sugar amount listed. I would add that in increments until you reach sweetness level you prefer. I may try with no sugar at all and see how that turns out.

I adore this recipe, and have made it many times with many variations. Most recently, I tweaked it to what I called a "Six-Berry Sauce" to celebrate my sixth anniversary at my office, and served it there over vanilla ice cream. 

I quadrupled the recipe (so take that into account if you try any of my variations), but used about three cups fresh blueberries, three cups fresh cut-up strawberries, a cup of halved fresh blackberries, and a cup of halved fresh raspberries. 

Then instead of four cups of orange juice, I used three cups orange juice and one cup of a bottled juice that mixed acai berry and goji berry. 

Then I followed the recipe as is, but added in roughly a half teaspoon of ground nutmet and about a quarter-teaspoon ground cardamom. I like my spices. The resulting sauce was AMAZING! 

I really encourage people to play with their own variations to find the recipe that works best for them and their own personal tastes!

I was looking for a great recipe for a blueberry sauce to put over cheesecake and I gave this a try.  I actually had to make a second batch though, because the first batch had to be thrown out. When I first followed the recipe to the letter, the sauce turned out way too thick!  This is because of the amount of cornstarch it calls for...3 TB is way too much for a sauce consistency!  Maybe it would work better for a pie filling, but not a sauce!  So, in the second batch, I decided to take it 1 TB of cornstarch (and 1 TB of cold water) at a time.  And 1 TB was all it took!  The flavor of the sauce is really amazing!  I never had any problems with the flavor.  The flavor of the sauce is amazing, especially the next day!  But, it was the change to the amount of cornstarch used that made this recipe perfect for me!

Absolutely delicious- I am not generally a big fan of blueberries but had some fresh ones to use up. This is a recipe I will be CRAVING and will make over & over again! MMMMM delish! Only difference I did was to substitute 2 T. lemon juice for the 1 c. orange juice. I didn't have OJ and didn't add any additional water to make up for it as I wanted a thicker sauce (and you can always add water later to thin, right?). It came out stunning and I tasted it while it was still hot - perhaps the need for flavors to mingle was only an issue with the OJ because using lemon juice I would've rated this recipe a 9 if I could have! Better than sauces I've had in restaurants!!! My 4 yr. old son, who won't eat blueberries, LOVED scraping the kettle with a spoon to get every last drip of this sauce!

Awesome sauce.  I  used a combination of  3 types of frozen berries:  blueberries, raspberries and blackberries.  I made it ahead of time and then reheated just before serving.

FANTASTIC! I had some on my waffles and it was so great I'm making a cheesecake later this week just so I have something to eat the leftovers with! 

Like other reviewers have mentioned, the blueberry taste gets more apparent after letting the sauce sit for a while.

Amazing recipe!  This went great on pancakes this morning for breakfast!  I used almond extract the first time I made this and it was good, but I prefer vanilla extract so that's how I make it now.  Best blueberry sauce I've tasted - this never lasts long at our house.  Whatever doesn't get eaten with pancakes or waffles is used in yogurt parfaits... delicious!

They ran out of fresh cranberries at the store, but fresh blueberries were on sale. I bought them then found this recipe. My intention was to use them as filling for corn muffins. This sauce turned out excellent for the corn muffins and as a topping on pancakes! I didn't have cornstarch on hand so I used a roux of flour and coldwater instead. I also didn't have almond extract so I left it out. Unlike the others, I didn't taste the orange juice in the mix which was perfect for me. I will definitely make this recipe again!

This is an awesome recipe! I used stevia in the raw instead of sugar, added a few more blueberries and used fresh squeezed orange juice. I've been looking for a good recipe for healthy blueberry sauce and this is it! I poured it over my fat free blueberry orange cake and some frozen yogurt, talk about healthy and delicious!

Very good sauce. I used 1 bag of frozen mixed berries in place of the blueberries because that was all I had on hand.  I made this to go with a stuffed French toast recipe I found on this site. They were great together. The sauce tasted even better the next day.

This is great! I do have one compliant though, and its mostly my fault. I added a bit too much of almond extract and it was pretty pronounced in the sauce. But anyway, I served this with some pancakes and it was delicious! I doubt I will ever use syrup again. :)

I thought this was good. However, my husband who is a blueberry lover did not care for this. It did have a strong oj taste that was gone by the next day, so you definately need to make it a day in advance. I had it over a lemon loaf cake and it was good. Easy and quick to make. Thanks

I have made this many times and it is wonderful!  Several times I substituted a berry mix for the blueberries and that is good too, but my favorite is with the blueberries.  I serve this over whole grain waffles (recipe on this site) or fluffy pancakes (also on this site).  I make the sauce the day before so the flavors blend.  You will not even taste the orange juice.  I get rave reviews whenever I serve it.

Great recipe. I have about 16 quart sized ziplocs of frozen blueberries to use up and this worked great. I canned most of the sauce I made to give as gifts. There is still a good bit leftover though. Just used some on homemade buttermilk pancakes and my daughter loved them!  Thanks so much.

Oh wow. I made cream cheese stuffed french toast as a father's day breakfast surprise for my husband, and decided that blueberries would go perfectly with it.  I followed the directions exactly, but used only 2 tbls. cornstarch, as I wanted a thinner sauce.  Because I read the reviews beforehand, I decided to make it the day before, and reheat to serve. I tasted it before placing it in the fridge, and could taste the OJ, but I didn't think it was a bad thing. In the morning I tasted it again, and it was all blueberry. I liked it both ways, though, and I think it just depends on what you are looking for. Either way, this was a delicious way to start the day!

Very good as syrup. I made a few changes also I used peach nectar in place of the OJ, vanilla in place of the almond extract and decreased the cornstarch to 2 and 1/2 Tbs. It was great on waffles.

If/when I make this again, I may actually cut the amount of orange juice used and try this with some blueberry juice. It wasn't bad though but very sweet and too orangey for my taste.

I tried this recipe because of the overall reviews.  I prefer the taste of "blueberry" in a sauce.  I made it specific to the directions.  The orange juice, almond, and cinnamon overpower and mask the blueberry taste.  I will keep looking for a true blueberry sauce.

Followed the recipe to a tee other than leaving out the almond extract (don't care for the taste). This has become my standard topping for white chocolate cheesecake. As others have noted it needs to set a couple of hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld. 5 stars and highly recommended!!

This was really good!  It was my friend's birthday and she loves blueberries so I made an angel food cake and poured this on top with some powdered sugar!  Amazing!  I will be making this again.

My blueberry sauce was SO good. I left out the cinnamon, per presonal preference, and blended it after it was done cooking. I thought it was fantastic right off of the stove, and even better the next day. I love the use of orange juice. I used this on pancakes, over ice cream, on angel food cake. YUM!

To me the almond extract was overbearing! And I love almond extract but it has its place. I would consider making again w/o this addition. I did 'save' this sauce by adding it to Rhubarb Berry Jam (this site) in lui of the blueberry pie filling.

Very nice sauce.  My husband was looking for something to liven up his vanilla ice cream so he made this.  I checked the reviews and made the changes that Biankat recommended.  The sauce turned out great and hubby thinks he's a star!

Great recipe. I used blackberries, because that is what I had on hand.  Also substituted splenda for the white sugar.  I used fresh squeezed orange juice, and my recommendation is that if you do, stick with the original amount.  I took the advice of others and decreased the amount to 1/2 cup of OJ, but ended up adding the other 1/2 at the end.  At first the mixture seemed to thick, but this is remedied by adding a little more water for desired consistency (also helped that I added the fresh squeezed oj).  I love the almond extract, gives an additional dimension.

I used mixed frozen berries, and it turned out pretty good. A little sour to our taste, but this might just be the berry cobination used. The reason why its a four star instead of five, is because it is not amazing for all that work and number of ingredients. It could have been way simpler with less ingredients, with very similar results. i served it over chantal's new york cheesecake from this site. Very pretty. Good sauce. thanks!

Very tasty and easy to make. Was getting tired of strawberry shortcake, and decide to use this sauce to make blueberry shortcake. Had some extra sauce, so also used it as a topping for vanilla ice cream. Next time, I'd like to try it on pancakes as some of the other viewers suggested. Could be used with almost anything!

This recipe is fantastic! I read the other reviews and did make a few changes. I used 1/2 cup OJ and the rest water to perserve the taste of the fresh blueberries. I did not add the almond extract. This sauce was very yummy! I could mostly taste blueberry with just a subtle hint of citrus! thank you for a fabulous recipe! I can't wait to make belgian waffles and put this on top!

No blueberries, so I used organic red raspberries! WOW! Delicious! We had this sauce over vanilla icecream with whip cream... mouth watering! I made a batch of Waffle House Waffles, it sits in the fridge overnight, and that will be breakfast tomorrow morning! I've never had a better sauce that's quick and easy, and outstanding outcome! Thank you!

I rated 4 stars since I modified.  I scaled in half with the exception of the water.  I used the juice I got from one orange which ended up being a little less than 1/2 cup based on other reviewers mentioning the overpowering orange flavor.  With these mods it was fantastic served over Oatmeal Pancakes II from this site.

This is my favorite blueberry sauce. Perfect on pancakes, mixed in yogurt and just by itself ;)  I use a little less corn starch than called for, about 2 tbsp because I like the sauce to be slightly runny.  I LOVE the almond extract, a strange ingredient but adds such a wonderful dimension!

Loved it! I just added 2/3 c of sugar, omitted 1/4 c of water, and instead of almond extract I did vanilla. Turned out even better.

DELISH! I made this for a brunch featuring blueberry and banana pancakes and it was a total hit. I changed the recipe around: used flour instead of cornstarch and only used half of what it called for. I also didn't have almond extract. I just let it simmer for 30 minutes so that it thickened up on its own and it came out perfect. I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!

The water is not necessary in this recipe, it only dilutes, just mix the cornstarch with a little of the orange juice and I would use a little less orange juice next time, thinking replace the sugar with just a 1/4 cup of honey.

I word, WOW!  I made this for my mother for mother's day, and she loved it!!  She wanted a bit sweeter, but she didn't complain.  I took the advice of everyone and made it 2 days prior to Mother's Day.  My mother gobbled it all up, so I had to make a second batch for dessert tonight.  Thanks for this amazing recipe!!!

This was easy:)  My first attempt at a fruit sauce.  I had leftover defrosted mixed berries in the fridge and used them instead of blueberries but did everything else the same.  My family loved this on waffles!

This blueberry sauce is terrific! So easy to make and tastes so good!  We tried it on waffles first and will try it on ice cream as well.  I did not have any almond extract so I used GRAND MARNIER instead...WOW! Thanks Isybel for the great recipe.

This sauce turned out quite well. It has good flavor and the consistency is just right; I didn't have to add any extra water at all. My only complaint is that it was a little too tangy for my taste. I like tangy fruit in my pies and cobblers, but I was using this on waffles and would have preferred a little less tartness. It certainly wasn't bad--just a personal preference. Also, next time I might lighten up on the almond extract. But if you make this exactly as the recipe says, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

I made this to put on my pancakes.  It was good, but next time I will cut back on the almond extract, or omit it altogether.  At first it was all I tasted and wasn't sure if I liked it.  Also, I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup because, with the orange juice, I thought 3/4 cup would be too sweet.  1/2 cup seemed about right for my taste.

I followed the other reviews and reduced the OJ to just under 1/2 cup, the sugar down to 1/4 cup, and the cornstarch to 2 tblspoons.  THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! 

**NOTE**
I also agree...cook it prior to starting breakfast so the the flavors marry.  I reheated it once everything was done...and OMGoodness.  :-)

Great recipe! As odd as the flavor combo may seem to some, it works out great! And if the almond extract freaks you out, use vanilla instead. It's such a versatile recipe...so easy to substitute the fruit, extract or juice to come up with your own flavors. I'll definitely be making this again....as I have a freezer full of blueberries.

Update: I made it again...still great...served it over blueberry pancakes...WOW!

Another Update: Made it again but this time I did 1 cup blueberries and 1 cup strawberries...still an amazing recipe! Delish!

Made it exactly except I added vanilla extract because I didn't have almond extract. I let it cool for an hour and let the flavors come together. I put it over French Vanilla Ice Cream and it was DELICIOUS!

I really liked this sauce with modifications, but also really wish I had made it exactly as the recipe states. If I ever need a blueberry sauce again, I will try to follow the directions more exactly. As it was, I didn't use the full amount of cornstarch, but would have liked to have had a thicker sauce. I didn't have any orange juice so I used the juice of one lemon. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, but surprise! would have liked it a bit sweeter. Finally, I didn't have almond extract so I omitted it. In short, I liked the sauce with all those substitutions, and think I would love it if I followed the recipe. :)

Made this sauce but cut the sugar in half and it still was sweet enough especially if used to top off something sweet.
Also increased the Almond extract to 1 tbl. . It was so delicious. Everyone asked for the recipe. Used it on top of blintz souffle. Will definitely make again!

I used freshly picked blueberries, huckleberries, and a few scattered black berries. I did not  have OJ in the house so I used  200 ml of the raspberry orange juice I did have left, and filled the remains 50ml with water. What i think made this sauce extremely tasty is I accidentally added 1 teaspoon of ground ginger to the sauce. ( as well as the cinnamon) . Oh, and I didn't have any almond extract in the house, so I used an brandy extract. All in all Extremely tasty !! My 8 year old son the sauce as ' the best blueberry sauce he's ever tasted'. Husbands quote" wow!  This is amazing! " and my 6 year old licked his plate clean. I think it's a winner.

Tried this today on crepes.  This is excellent! Ate it immediately warm and it was great.  Later equally as good.  Wouldn't change a thing.  The orange juice, cinnamon and extract all work perfectly together.

Oh my! So delicious. I made a blueberry and raspberry sauce to serve at party I did with a cheesecake bar for dessert. The raspberry was by far the best thing...we were all licking our plates! I doubled the recipe; used a 24oz bag of frozen raspberries and 18oz fresh blueberries. Definitely make the day before, this is a must if you want good results. The orange juice overpowers the flavors otherwise. A good tip...save some of the fruit to add at the very end of the process, because as it's cooking the fruit reduces and it all becomes a sauce. Which is great, but I like it to also have whole blueberries and raspberries. Better presentation, I think. This would be amazing on pancakes, ice cream, or for your own cheesecake bar...it was phenomenal!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it was absolutely wonderful. I used fresh squeezed orange juice. Like others I was hesitant about the almond extract and the cinnamon but I went ahead and used them, as that was what was called for.They just inhanced the blueberry flavor. I couldn't taste the almond.  It went from very good tasting to awesome.  I will make this recipe many more times.    I will use just a tad less of the cinnamon but it does need that little pop of flavor that the cinnamon gives it.  I will never rate a recipe that I have changed in anyway as I feel this is not far to the person who submitted it.

Loved this. Had some leftover after using it on biscuits. Mixed the sauce with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard and salt to make an awesome vinaigrette.

Made this for cheesecake topping. Texture was a bit different after cooling in fridge but everyone thought it tasted delicious. Next time I'll add more blueberries though.

I took into consideration the other reviews that said to leave the sauce for a few hours to let the flavors settle.I made it the night before and served it at room temperature the following morning with waffles and whipped cream. This sauce was absolutely amazing! I did not make any modifications. Love. Love. Love. Will definitely use again.

I definitely agree that there's  too much OJ. Just reducing it to 1/2 or even 1/4 cup is better, especially if you're preparing this for immediate consumption. Many have said that it's better the next day, but it might not last until then.

Love this - I mushed some of the blueberries, used diluted OJ (didn't have enough left), and cut the sugar down to approx 1/4C and used approx 1/4C Honey/Agave....so a lot lower in sugar and still delicious!  And oddly enough, I think i'd like this one better without the cinnamon.

I made this for pancakes this morning, and it was so quick and easy--it was done in about 10 minutes. It was also delicious. I wasn't sure if all the flavors would work together, but they did. My husband wants to try it on cheesecake next time.

This was so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla extract. It tasted great. The thickness was perfect, too, I hate runny sauces on my pancakes. I liked this even better than IHOP's blueberry syrup. Great recipe!

What a wonderful recipe!  Not only is it delicious but it is very pretty as well.  I followed the recipe but ended up adding another pint of blueberries.  I felt the sauce was on the thin side and did not wish to add more cornstarch for the consistency I wanted.  I added some vanilla extract as well.  My kids are not big on lumpy sauce so I pureed the blueberries with my immersion blender.  Once I added the cornstarch it became a beautiful, silky, thick sauce just right for pouring on our pancakes.  Next time I make this I am going to try using part apple juice.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious!  I just made it and tried it warm over vanilla ice cream and it was amazing.  I'm going to save the rest for tomorrow to serve over a fruit tart since we are having company for dinner.
Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

What a great way to make use of blueberries.  This recipe was followed exactly and great served over ice cream, waffles, pancakes, or a cheesecake.  I've even ventured to eat it solo.  Anyone else have any other serving suggestions ?

Great sauce.  Very thick and delicious.  I served it right away, though I read other reviews that said not to, but I didn't have time to wait.  Oddly enough it tasted like cherries to me, my kids thought so too.  But, it was still delicious and I made the recipe just as it stated.  I did use fresh picked Maine wild blueberries (a perk living in Maine!) so that may have affected the flavor since they have a different flavor than other types of blueberries.  Overall I was satisfied and will make this again.

Wonderful recipe!  I substituted Pomegranate juice for the OJ since that was what I had on hand and it is just amazing.  I tripled the recipe and had a yield of 5 pint jars that I processed in a water bath for 10 min.

This really is delicious.  The only thing I plan to do when I make it again this summer, is add some more blueberries.  Great on the baked pancake squares on this site - my B&B guests all loved it this morning!
Thanks for the post.

This sauce was fabulous! As other reviews have stated while warm the orange taste is strong but after cooling dissipates. I made 3 hours before I needed it and it was perfect. I served it with cream cheese filled crepes. I have a little left over and will be buying some vanilla ice cream to have with it! Will be making again.

This was a huge hit in my family.  I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar, OJ and cornstarch.  I used 1/3 C turbinado sugar, 3/4 C OJ and 2T cornstarch.  Great consistency and flavor!

This sauce is delicious!  I used it on waffles and there was enough left over to freeze for two more servings - and it was just as tasty out of the freezer.  I used vanilla extract because I didn't have any almond.

This is the best Blueberry sauce EVER. After it was done I wanted to try it until it was cooled down enough to even touch. That very try was the bomb. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone!

Very good! I used only 2T cornstarch as I wanted it as syrup more than sauce. It definitely had the orange hint but we ate it right away, have yet to let the flavors mellow. Oh, I skipped the cinnamon as well. Quite delicious, would be a super cute hostess gift in a mason jar with wax paper lid!

Used pint of blueberries. Didn't measure - just what I had from store purchase.  Used 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup sugar.  Fruit... already a "dessert".  Tasted great on the Company Cheesecake.  On toast later.  Now, I am using it for pancakes... Yum.

This sauce is DELICIOUS! I made it exactly how the recipe reads, using frozen blueberries and it came out perfect. I am putting it on the cheesecake I made this morning.

Don't skip the almond, it makes it all work! This was wonderful and so easy, I will make it often. I used it to top cheesecake tarts. Best I've ever made.

I didn't have any orange juice, so I just substituted more water. It tastes AMAZING! I made blueberry cupcakes for a birthday party and put this on the inside and top. :)

I thought this sauce was fantastic!  I forgot the cinnamon and didn't have almond extract, and my sauce didn't need to simmer after adding the cornstarch and water.  I agree that the flavor changes as it sits.  Licked my plate clean!

This was excellent. I made it to over a homemade cheesecake, but I think it would go great over pancakes or crepes as well. The flavors of the cinnamon and orange juice were very noticeable so I may reduce them slightly next time. Even as is the sauce was delicious.

I am not a blue berry lover at all but this sauce is awesome!  I followed the directions to a "T" and it is perfect as written.  I agree with other reviewers that the flavor is much better after it has been refrigerated over night, it gives the flavors a chance to blend & marry.  I used this sauce in the Blueberry Snow recipe on this site and it was amazing!

I made this recipe for my mom on mother's day and we both LOVED it. I took advice from another review and let it sit while I cooked the rest of her breakfast so that was about half an hour. We ate it on toast we could have just eaten that. GREAT recipe!

Awesome!  I did not have any orange juice, so I used 1&1/2 cup water and a little lemon juice with frozen blueberries and it was perfect! Added to whole wheat waffles and my kids gobbled them up :)

This sauce was awesome! The almond extract amplified the flavor of the blueberries very nicely. I used this sauce for a pancake sauce, so I used about 2 Tsp less cornstarch. This kept the topping more loose, so as to act like a syrup rather than a jelled filling. I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious! I served this with 'Big Germans' from this site, and topped with whipped cream. The combination was amazing! I made a couple of minor modifications - used vanilla extract instead of almond, and used about 2.5 cups of frozen mixed berries. I will definitely make this again!

To die for on top of steel-cut oatmeal with toasted almonds and little brown sugar. Healthy dessert breakfast... so darn good. I tripled the recipe and gave it to a few friends. We all go to Jamba juice to get their steel-cut oatmeal with blueberries, but now, we can have it at home too!

I made this to put over waffles and is was delicious! Makes a lot so I never was able to use it all.  Tasted better as it rested and cooled off.  Still tasted great for the next few days in the fridge.

I halved this recipe to use up some leftover blueberries.  I thought it was a little heavy on OJ flavor and maybe a little bit too sweet but was still tasty.  I had mine on waffles - no butter or other syrup needed!

Yummy! This reminded me of a blueberry pie, minus the crust!  Very tasty and it does get better with time. I tossed some of the sauce with fresh blueberries and topped it with some whipped cream.  Light and delicious! I tripled the batch since I had some frozen berries, and put them in jars in the fridge.  I know it won't last long.  Pound cake, ice cream, on french toast, pancakes, endless possibilities! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great tasting blueberry sauce.  I dont' have orange juice so I squeeze the juice from an orange, used splenda, and it turned out perfect.  I topped it on my cottage cheesecake. SO YUMMY I'll do this again and will try it on pancakes and ice cream.

This is good.  I substituted 2tbsp lemon juice and 3/4 cup water for the orange juice and used dehydrated cane juice instead of sugar.  Quick easy and very good!

Wow, was this good!  I used only 1/2 cup sugar (3/4 cup sounded like a lot!), and would make that same change again - it was plenty sweet.  Everything else was perfect as written!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is excellent!  The only change I made was to use just 2 T cornstarch and the consistency was just right.  I look forward to trying it again and experimenting with a berry mixture and using vanilla in place of the almond extract.  Also, for those that thought the citrus flavor was too strong, maybe substituting grape juice for part or all of the orange juice would be a good alternative.

Fabulous! I make this exactly as written. Keep it in the frig and add to hot cereals, waffles, pancakes and on its own. Blueberrys are benificial for memory and weight loss. I find blueberries on sale, freeze 2 cups in a bag and I'm always ready to prepare another batch!

Fantastic sauce and recipe. Easy to follow and very fast. I chose to puree mine when it was finished since I needed it to be a syrup.  I served it with "Cream Cheese Pound Cake" and it was a hit.

So easy, and great taste.  Very simple, but we found it was a bit too sweet.  I'll cut the sugar to about 2 tablespoons next time.  Thickens nicely while standing.  Even my picky daughter loved it.  Thanks.

This is great. I took the advice of others and let it sit for a day, and I added a few more fresh blueberries than the recipe called for. I used it on French Toast, but could use for just about anything, including ice cream, pound cake etc. This is a keeper

I served this over buttermilk pancakes instead of putting blueberries in the pancakes. Oh, it was yummy! I used 3/4 cup each of oj and water. I also used closer to 3 cups berries. I thought it needed to be a little sweeter, so I added 1/2 tsp vanilla. There was enough to freeze, and have a serving of sauce over vanilla ice cream the next day, so it certainly makes a lot. I agree with others that this tastes better after it sits for a day or so.

I divided the recipe in half and used raspberries. I only had bottled lemon juice, so for the quantity of juice called for I used half bottled lemon and half water. This turned out delicious!

This is definitely better the next day. I'm a little perturbed with myself because I added too much cornstarch and water and it came out too thick. I'll have to thin it out some with more orange juice or water. I followed the recipe very closely. Kids had it over buttermilk pancakes. I'd like to try it again using less cornstarch slurry and see if it's any better, then re-review.

I wanted to use up some blueberries in a sauce to top ice cream. I used splenda instead of sugar. I didn't have OJ on hand, so I used 3/4 cup of lemon juice, 1/2 cup water, and a little extra splenda. I didn't let it boil long after adding the corn starch mixture, as I didn't want it too thick. I also shook some pre-mixed cinnamon-sugar instead of straight cinnamon. It was *amazing* on my no-sugar added ice cream - the perfect combo of sweet and tart. Will make again for sure!!

I didn't want to go to the store so I used fresh Blackberries, Cherry Limeaid in place of OJ and Maraschino Cherries in place or Almond Extract.  It still turned out Wonderful!

Agree completely with reviews that say to let it cool before serving.  If you eat it hot/warm you taste the OJ & almond extract pretty strong.  But cooled it was great!  Made it exactly as written & served it over french toast.

I agree with those who say to let it sit.  Honestly, this gets better every day.  I have been eating it with a spoon it is so good.  I have made it several times and I pretty much always follow the recipe exactly.  Tonight I plan to eat it on crepes filled with 1 package of cream cheese mixed with 1/2 can of condensed milk.  I am pretty sure my husband will fall in love with me all over again when he tastes the crepes.

Fantastic! I didn't have any orange juice, so I just substituted some fruit flavored water - It sounds disgusting, but the sauce came out delicious and fruity.

Very easy and fast. I served it over ice cream. Is a great dessert for entertaining when you're in a pinch and need something fast. I used vanilla extract since I didn't have almond extract and I reduced the OJ like many other reviewers did.

This was wonderful. My husband ate it on cheesecake and the next day on his ice cream. I didn't have OJ but had strawberry banana juice that I used instead. I also added more blueberries and a little less sugar. Wonderful treat!!

We had this for dinner tonight with "German Potato Pancakes" from this site.  This sauce was so easy to make.  I made another batch exactly the same except with strawberries and it was equally fabulous.  My family loved this sauce and I will definately use it for other things as well.

This sauce was excellent.  Easy to make and turned out wonderfully.  I was looking for a recipe at the last minute so that I would have something to top the Valentine's Day waffles that I made for my boyfriend and this turned out perfectly.  Top with whipped cream and your set.  Also, I used vanilla extract instead of almond and didn't have any cinnamon around so left that out as well and it still turned out great.  I'm excited to make it again with all of the correct ingredients :)

I literally just made this, and straight off the stove, it is SO yummy!!! Was expecting the orange juice flavor to be the only thing I could taste, but nope. Very good. Can't wait til later once the blueberry flavor has time to come out even more. Will be awesome on the cheesecake I plan on making :) I actually didn't have any almond extract so didn't bother with trying to substitute it and I'm glad I did. I think it would've overpowered the taste of the blueberries.

this was SO good-- not too sweet and not too tart. i cut back on the OJ and only used 3/4 cup (and added 1/4C more water to make up for it). i loved the depth of the flavor-- the almond extract, cinnamon, and OJ made this sauce much more special and gourmet than any other blueberry sauce i've ever had!  delicious with ice cream

this is very good.  I made only half of the recipe and found it to be very thick.  I needed to add water right after adding the cornstarch and the next morning.  I did use vanilla extract instead of vanilla and cut back a bit on the sugar for a personal preference.  Will make again soon!

Delicious.  I had a bottle of Minute Maid brand blueberry/pomegranate juice and used that instead of orange juice. I used vanilla extract instead of almond.  It was delicious.  Use it to fill Norwegian pancakes on this site or crepes and you have a fancy breakfast like the restaurants make.

This was so insanely delicious. It is good to let it sit awhile before serving or you will mainly taste orange juice. I used vanilla instead of almond extract and it still tasted yummy. Our family ate this on everything- even all by itself!

This sauce was very good.  I don't care much for blueberries, but wanted something different for a quick dessert or substituting syrup over pancakes.  This sauce passed the test.  My daughter even liked it.  I also waited a few hours after making the sauce before tasting it, following other reviews' advice.

This is a very good blueberry sauce. I didn't have almond extract, and didn't add the cinnamon. I added more cornstarch to it, because I wanted a thicker sauce. It was great over cheese cake cups, and I love to eat it with vanilla ice cream.

I belong to the bunch of folks who modify the recipe with what we have in the house, and comments read.  This is still a 5-star recipe in my book because my sauce came out velvety and delicious.  I halved the recipe, used frozen (from fresh) berries that I had in the freezer from last summer.  Instead of OJ, I substituted Knudsen Cider & Spice juice and ommitted the almond extract and ground cinnamon. The juice is unsweetened so I used the full measure of sugar, but I like things sweet.  The half recipe made about 6 (2 Tblsp.) servings for me.  Delicious served over the Blueberry Flax Pancakes (which I also modified) from this website. Ijust love Allrecipes!

First time making a berry syrup/sauce. Loved how simple it was. I used frozen mixed berries and substitued 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda. I did not use as much sugar as called for because I topped with sugar free whipped topping.  YUM!

Very simple and tasty. It was a little too almond extracty for me, but I did eyeball it, so it's probably my fault. Will probably make again!

This recipe was very good and tasted delicious! However, instead  of using orange juice, I used mango juice and it turned out nicely. The consistency was a little thick so I also put in 2-3 extra teaspoons of water. But I will definitely use it again!

Awesome! also, if you don't have OJ, you can use white grape juice or apple juice. 

Watch out though- blueberries leave a stain.

Made one minor change to the recipe after reading that many users found the orange juice a little overwhelming.
I cut back the orange juice to 3/4C and increased the water added in the beginning to 1/2C. The sauce tasted great!

Superb!  As some other reviewers stated - I think it's better the next day.  I could taste the blueberry flavour more and all around the flavour had more depth. When I made this it was off season for blueberries, so I used frozen and it still tasted very fresh (I think the citrus helps).  I love this recipe because it can be made the day (or two) before with no problem.  I've recently used this for cheesecake and it was great.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I made this with blueberries and another batch with strawberries and served it as a drizzle over cheesecakes for our daughter's wedding.  I think the fresh berries gave it a unique taste - not out of a jar. I made it up 2 days prior.  No heating was necessary.

I'll give it a 4 cause it's better than any blueberry sauce I've ever had, but I don't really care for the stuff. My husband is who I made it for, he said it was just "ok". He asked what was in it,then said if I made it again to put less almond extract in it. I followed the recipe exactly, easy to make

A wonderful sauce, with the juice adding a bit of citrus zing and more depth of flavor. Confession: I have not made it with blueberries yet. In the interests of economy, I used strawberries and peaches.

Okay I think this would actually be a 5 star rating without the almond extract.  Apparently it is something that makes you either love it or hate it.

I REALLY thought I would love the almond extract, as I love almond flavouring...but I'd tasted the sauce before I'd added it, then put some in (and less than 1/2 tsp even) and expected it was going to be even better...but it just tasted weird!

I added some more orange juice as I'd only used half the amount anyways and that helped to offest the almond a bit...but next time I'd leave it out.

I was really disappointed, especially as it had tasted so good before I added it!  

I think this sauce would be great with peaches, raspberries, etc... and will definitely make it again sans almond flavouring.

My kids liked this and it was easy to make. However, I thought that the orange flavor overpowered the bluberrieness.

Absolutely delicious! This sauce tastes great on just about anything you can think of. I had a lot left over so I used it as a topping for pancakes and a stuffing for crepes. I am sure it would be just as great on waffles. Great recipe!

Very yummy! I actually didn't have any orange juice on hand so I just used water and added more blueberries instead and it still turned out pretty good, Not as good as it were probably was meant to be but still had a nice flavor.I will make this again!

I have made this sauce twice now. First with fresh blueberries and then with frozen, and both were great.  I did not change anything.  Both times I made the sauce the night before, and then warmed it in the microwave

I halved the recipe, noting that the program doesn't appear to reduce quantities less than 1/8 tsp (used 2 pinches of cinnamon).  Didn't have orange juice, so I used light cranberry juice.  The sauce didn't thicken up as much as I thought it would.  

The recipe is absolutely delicious! The almond extract adds a really nice flavor that I loved.

So easy and delicious I'm disappointed that this is the first time I've tried to make this. I used 1c. blueberries, 1c. blackberries and substituted vanilla extract for the almond because that's what I had on hand.

I adapted this recipe to fit a bread pudding recipe it actually wanted me to put plan blueberries and strawberries on my bread pudding.  =(  So I doubled this one with 2ea cups blueberries and strawberries.  I cooked the strawberries down until they were part of the syrup just a nice flavor.  I am allergic to oranges so I used pomegranate, blueberry juice and vanilla instead of almonds.  This was so good on my pudding =) I have use the regular recipe on other things both ways is great.

I was looking for a topping for a cheesecake that I made also from this site. I had some frozen berries and found this recipe. It was a perfect addition to the cheesecake. My husband suggested to cut back just a little on the sugar next time.

I love quick and easy recipes and this one is at the top of the list.  It came together in 5 minutes as stated on the recipe.  It was however, like other reviewers said, much better after it has cooled for about an hour.  I used frozen blueberries and the sauce came out great.

Very, very good. I too would recommend substituting at least part of the OJ with another type of juice to take the orangey taste out. Either way is easy and yummy.

I loved it, my husband was only so-so about it.  As mentioned by others, the flavor does develop more after a day in the fridge.  I used 1/3 c. sugar and 1/3 c Splenda, and it was plenty sweet for me.  Good alternative to sugary syrups!

We make this sauce all the time for french toast.  Once we changed the berries to strawberries and it was a hit!I regularly lessen the sugar to 1/4 cup instead of 3/4 cup.  My husband isn't completely sold on the recipe.  Maybe his sweet tooth misses the sugar :)

This was a very good sauce.  I'm giving it a 4 merely because I think the almond extract was a little too much.  Perhaps next time I will lessen it or omit it completely.  Other than that, it was a nice sauce for our pancakes.

I've taken this to brunches numerous times served over baked oatmeal and it is always a hit! I have one particular fan that just cannot get enough of this sauce. :) It is a bit on the sweet side, but so good, I didn't have the heart to change it. :)

Sauce tasted great but I can't well bear the smell of almond extract. Next time I will either substitute vanilla or omit all together. Otherwise excellent sauce, very thick and went well with belgian waffles.

I made this sauce to put on Berry Triffle that I found on this site. I was a little dissapointed. I made the sauce 2 days ahead of time to prevent the orange taste that everyone in previous reviews mentioned. I have to say 2 days did not help, it was still overwhelming. I gave it 3 stars because it was so easy to make. I would suggest not using so much orange juice.

I have never left a review, & I've been taking recipes from this site forever.  But this- by far- deserves to be put in a book.  The only thing I cut back on was the almond extract- by half.  A great topper for my Eggo waffles!  From now on, this wonderful blueberry syrup will take place of my maple. YUMMY!

AMAZING!  I used it as a topping on a cheesecake (my first ever, and the topping covered up my obvious cracks in the cake).  Many of the other users scared me by stating that the orange juice was too much.  I halfed the orange juice and water, no almond extract, no cinnamon.  Very blueberry and a perfect topping for a blueberry cheesecake.  I loved my modification and will use it the same way again.

This is an EXCELLENT sauce. I made it just like the recipe said and it was perfect.  I don't even like blueberries that well but this was wonderful!  We put it on cheesecake and it was excellent!

This was so easy to make.  I did take the suugestion of only using 1/2 almond extract (especially since I only had imitation extract on hand).  Plan to serve over the Chantel Cheese Cake for Easter dinner. (which by the way turned out great - no cracks, followed some of the other review suggestions).

I found the almond extract very overpowering in this recipe so I would half it next time.  Also it was very sweet so I would at least half the sugar as well.  I guess it all depends on how sweet your blueberries are.  It was very easy to make, however.

This is SOOOO good! I made a few modifications, which I think worked well. I used 2/3 c. sugar, 2T. cornstarch, left out the first 1/4 cup water, and reduced the water with the cornstarch to just enough to make a smooth mixture. I'm not crazy about almond, so I substituted vanilla. It was GREAT over pancakes. Next time I'll put whipped cream on top, too. MMMMmmmm!

I made this ahead of time to use on waffles for our company this weekend and had a little taste of it in advance.  It's delicious!  Can't wait for breakfast!  I used frozen blueberries.  I also used real almond extract which I think really makes the flavor of this sauce stand out.  Try not to use imitation almond extract; it makes a big difference!  Thanks so much, Isybel!

Excellent consistency. Used a little less sugar and it was plenty sweet. I didn't have OJ, so I used a carton of my daughter's tangerine-orange juice, and it worked great! Was not overpowering like others mentioned with OJ. I wonder if apple juice would work as well? I only used half the cornstarch.

YUM! YUM! YUM! I halved the recipe since I wasn't sure how it was going to go over, but I guess I should have doubled it! I served this sauce with Todds Famous Blueberry Pancakes, and the family really enjoyed this morning's breakfast. Now, to find a good donut recipe into which to stuff this yummy sauce.......

Dissappointing. I thought it would turn out so good but even hubby didn't care for it. I used this for the chantal's new york cheesecake, but he preferred the caramel sauce topping instead of this. Lack of taste I guess...

very good! though i made mine more like a jam. i also changed it quite  a bit . I switched the amounts of orange juice and water, i used half sugar & half splenda, i puree'd the blueberrys after heating, but before adding the cornstarch mixture(which i only used half of) and i didn't use the almond extract...turned out great!

Wife and kids enjoyed it.  The orange juice flavor overshadowed the blueberry flavor.  It is tasty but not the blueberry flavor I was expecting.  More like a blueberry-orange sorbet.

Very good,just what I needed to top a cheesecake. I didn't have any orange juice so used some "lite" lemonade,and equal parts of spenda & sugar to lighten the recipe carb wise.

This sauce was pretty tasty. It wasn't too sweet, nor was it too tart. I do think the orange comes through a little strong, but it's not bad enough that you can't taste the blueberries at all. We liked it best on pancakes or ice cream.

Yum!  Nice and thick!  After pouring into a serving dish, I got to lick the spoon.  Really good but could be a dash sweeter.  I used frozen berries and the sauce was great for my cheesecake (Chantal's recipe).  The sauce did thicken as soon as I poured in the cornstarch - don't think you can just remove from heat at that point - you need to cook it for the 3-4 minutes or the constarch will taste "chalky".  It made me wanna bake a pie!

This recipe was so simple and I have passed it on to several people "as is".  There is no need to change it.  I have gotten rave reviews from 3 Provinces away!  Was a smashing hit at my dinner party served over shortcakes with a drizzle of blueberry syrup over whipped cream and toasted slivered almonds on top!

This was good, but it was a little too orange-y.  I saw from other reviews that it gets better if you let it sit overnight, but I wanted this tonight to go with Good Old Fashioned Pancakes (from this site)...yep, breakfast for dinner!  This was still quite yummy despite the slightly overpowering orange flavor.  I did use fresh blueberries.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Very good sauce.  I just don't like very sweet things, so I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, and next time I would cut it even more (to 1/4 cup).  I made this the night before, like suggested.  I didn't put in the whole amount of corn starch.  Served over Whole Grain Waffles (from this site- I highly recommend that recipe, wink wink!).

Son home from college made this for us to enjoy on mother's day.  Only change made was using brown sugar instead of white because I prefer the richer taste.  Served sauce together with maple syrup to thin it out a bit on top of Mom's Applesauce Pancakes (also on this site) and then we served the sauce together with sliced strawberries over mini angel food cakes topped with whipped topping and a drizzle of chocolate sauce for dessert.  Very delicious mother's day dining!

It is wonderful. I always have Sunny Delight in the refrigerator so I used that and it is perfect. It is a bit less tangy. I am trying to get my autistic son to eat more fruit and this is perfect for his pancakes. Perfect thickness and so fast and easy. Thanks

This was sooo easy and yummy!  I served it over angel food cake with whipped topping.  Such a light and yummy summer dessert! I used frozen blueberries and it came out great. My daughter and I thought it would be great on top of toast, so we'll be making this again!

This is a great recipe!! I did not add the 1/4 cup water to the berries, just used the oj and the water that was mixed with the cornstarch. Also used "sugar lite" in the same proportion as the sugar. Used berries that I had picked and frozen this last summer. Turned out wonderful. Ate it on cheesecake and refrigerated the leftovers.

Big hit at our family brunch. I used vanilla extract instead of almond because I didn’t have that. Did have to cook down a little longer than directions state to get a thicker sauce.

This is the best blueberry sauce. I was skeptical of some of the ingredients at first, but the flavors blend together to make a very round or whole taste that's hard to describe, other than just really yummy. I've made it a couple times now, and everyone (literally everyone) loves it!

didn't have OJ, used apple juice and freshly squeezed lemon juice, reduced sugar. Smashed blueberries a bit to add more texture to the sauce. Replaced almond extract with amaretto di Saronno. 
I will let seat the sauce in the fridge for a day or two before serving, but as it is I was not particularly impressed maybe because I applied changes. I definitely think the amount of juice is too much.

Easy sauce to make as a waffle topping. I reduced the amount of white sugar for dieting reasons to 1/2 cup ( I am glad I did) This sauce is good on toast, ice cream, warm flour tortilla.

Very good sauce that can be easily doubled.  I turned this into a triple berry sauce and it is wonderful.  I used strawberries, raspberries and blueberries, and when doubled, I adjusted ingredients to 1-3/4 c. orange juice, 1 c. sugar, 4 T. cornstarch, and 4-5 c. berries.  I froze some to see how that works.  I will definitely make this again and try different fruit combos.  So good on ice cream and french toast!

This is really good! I would suggest, for those who are diabetic or need to watch their sugar intake, I would they exchange the 3/4 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup Monk Fruit Sweetner; which works perfectly. Erithrylnol is the brown sugar equivalent. I made this with the Monk Fruit; and I am diabetic.

I didn’t get a picture. It didn’t last long enough. LOL! I didn’t use regular sugar. I used Splenda instead. I also substituted Vanilla for Almond extract. My son licked the pot clean!

I wanted to love this. It has good flavors: almond, orange, blueberry, cinnamon. But it is far too sweet. All the photos have a heaping pile of the sauce on pancakes...well a teaspoon on a large pancake is enough. I will try this recipe again but with 1/4 cup sugar. I think the oj adds nearly enough sweetness.

I have now made this for two summers. I have a friend who owns multiple blueberry ‘bushes’ (which are more the size of trees), and I can get around a gallon of berries per half hour of picking. What am I to do with all those blueberries? This sauce is the PERFECT solution! I double the recipe and get 6 8oz mason jars of sauce.

This wasn't bad.  I made it as instructed.  I think there is a little too much orange flavor.  Also, the 3 tbsp of corn starch was a bit much.  If I make this again, I would reduce the amount of corn starch.  I served it over angel food cake slices.

I made this twice. The first time, it was perfect. The second time, it wasn’t as thick.  This was my fault, since I rushed and didn’t cook it long enough, thinking that it would thicken as it cools.  So, don’t rush!

Delicious!  I use some frozen wild blueberries I get from the food bank, which are too watery for a pie, but work just right for this.  Also, as almond extract is very expensive, I substitute a maple extract, but you could use vanilla, etc.   Also, make sure to stir in some of the hot syrup into the cornstarch and dissolve it well or it will clump.

I love this blueberry sauce!! I had to make a few changes due to lack of ingredients: I added lemonade instead of orange juice and I omitted the almond extract. This is super yummy and reminds me of my mother's blueberry pie filling. I could sit and eat it with a spoon it is so good.

I followed the recipe as written. It is not thin like syrup, but I put it on homemade waffles (waffles I recipe) and it was very good! I made it the night before as suggested by other reviewers and just reheated when I was ready to use it. Very good use for blueberries that need used up.

I took the advice of others and cut back on the sugar and omitted the almond extract and cinnamon. Lovely blueberry flavour with the pancakes. Leftovers will be used on ice cream or cheesecake as recommended.

Delicious! I made it to serve with pancakes but changed my mind about the menu so I served it  for dessert over vanilla ice cream. Everyone raved about it and I loved it too. You couldn’t find an easier dessert and this recipe made so much sauce that I’m going to freeze some after pancakes tomorrow and I even gave a jar away to my guests.

First time I made this as written to serve (same-day) as a cheesecake topping at Thanksgiving. Fresh from the stove, the flavors of orange and cinnamon were bright but I thought it was pretty good - very "holiday" in my mind. But the 2-day thing is true. I saved the leftover sauce for topping french toast later in the weekend and it was omagosh-delicious! This is going to be a go-to sauce in my recipe book for sure.

Great sauce! Very easy to make. Does not have a strong blueberry flavour at the end and is more of an exotic flavour. I only added a sprinkle of cinnamon because I am not a big fan. I cooled in fridge for 20 min before putting over vanilla ice cream and sponge cake! Will make again.

I made it with frsh blueberries and substituted vanilla extract for almond cause I was out if almond, I will try that tge next time. I like raw sugar in recipes that you heatvit up, it turns out perfect and no need to add more thickening. Perrrrrr~fect?

Today I made this sauce with my 14-year-old son. We made it to go over our waffles. I did not give it five stars because we made a few changes, but overall we loved the outcome. I did not use 1 cup of orange juice, we used a 1/2 cup, and it was just the correct amount. I think 1 cup would have overpowered the taste of the blueberries. Second, we also added more water because we felt that it was a little too sweet for us. Lastly, we used vanilla extract due to my son's allergies. This sauce will also be a great addition to yogurt, cake, cheesecake, and pancakes

Taste was good - stored it for a day in fridge so flavors blended as suggested. Made it a bit too thick. Next time will adjust that. Made it too difficult to reheat. Topped pancakes with sauce along with homemade whipped cream!! Yum!

I decided to add lemon zest instead of almond and cinnamon to give it a brighter flavor...added just a small pinch of cinnamon, but loved the ease in making it!  Great to add to my little 3 point weight watcher snack (with honey grahams).

My husband is diabetic, so I subbed low sugar orange juice and a mix of xylitol and Stevia for the sugar.  I think it turned out a little thicker  because the sweeteners I used didn't interact with the fruit quite the same, but that worked out well actually. I used it as a topping on ice cream with my grandkids the first night I made it, and my husband and I have used it like jelly on toast.  I will definitely make it again.

I wasn't sure about the orange juice, almond extract, and cinnamon, but this blueberry sauce had a really nice flavor when I paired with with a no-bake lemon cheesecake.  

The recipe is easy to follow.  I was concerned I had ruined it when I added the almond extract and cinnamon at the end because of the scent, but after letting it cool an hour, all the flavors combined well for a great taste.

This really impressed me with just how easy it was. I usually fuss to much with sauces but this one almost made itself. I recommend letting the sauce set overnight to really get full flavors. Definitely a keeper!

Super easy to make and really good.  I didn't have orange juice at home so used a mixture of peach/apple/orange juice.  I also put a tad more almond extract than in the recipe (by accident).  It was really good

At first glance, I thought the orange juice was an odd addition, until I tasted the syrup on my pancakes. It was clear, orange juice and blueberries do not work well together. At all. That said, my wife loves this stuff. I cannot bring myself to raise the rating on her behalf. I will let her write her own 5 star review.

I agree it is better after sitting.  But I wasn't a big fan of the flavour from the almond extract.  I would make again, but would try vanilla instead.

Holy cow, so good! I've now made this recipe a few times, and it's out of this world tasty. this most recent time I made it to serve over waffles and discovered I didn't have any orange juice, so I used organic lemon juice instead. the flavor is even better, as the lemon really brings out even more blueberry awesomeness! I highly recommend trying other berries as well; my father in law is allergic to blueberries so I've also subbed strawberries and it's absolutely perfect!

Incidentally, it also cans very well and makes for a wonderful. homemade gift! :)

This recipe must have a mistake in the cornstarch. I knew when it said 3 tablespoons cornstarch it would be to much but a review said they would not change it. I wanted a sauce not a pie filling. As soon as I put it in it thickened up immediately. Probably 3 tsp. (1tablespoon) would have been plenty. I reheated it, added almost equal amount of water and extra berries to thin it to a sauce. It did not dilute the flavor. Will not make it again without making changes.

I made this exactly as printed. It was great, but I concur with raters who say it is better the second day after flavors have melded. This freezes well for me and helps use up excess backyard blueberries. I may try it with a bit less sugar next time.

I did not make any changes, but might try Splenda instead of white sugar, since diabetes runs rampant in our family. I will definitely make it again. It was a wonderful topping for the homemade vanilla ice cream my daughter made!

Made as is, put over french toast.  Next time I will squeeze in some lime or lemon juice to add a little pop of flavor.  Will make again.

I had some blueberries that I had just bought, and when I went to use them they were shrivelled, old and tough.  It was either return them to the store or do something with them so made this -so quick - and served warm over vanilla ice cream.  Had no almond extract so used vanilla. Yummy!

Delicious!! Very easy to make. The only change I made was to the icing. Did not have sour cream on hand, therefore used Plain Greek Yogurt. The tang was really nice and the whole dessert wasn't super sweet, so great recipe. Thanks!!

This was just ok -- it was edible, I guess,  but we threw out the leftovers (even the 4 kids didn't  really like it)  & I was more than a little sad because I felt it was a waste of juicy, delicious homegrown blueberries!

Simply amazing.  We ate it on cheesecake and it was absolutely divine.  I may have shed a tear.

We made this a second time substituting pure maple syrup for the sugar on a 1 for 1 basis.  We served it on pancakes and it was just wonderful.

I didn't have any orange juice so I did fresh squeeze (4 medium = 1 cup).  Will compare with juice one of these days but fresh squeeze version passed with an A+. Can see us making this in quart batches so it's available for more than cheesecake.  Everyone loved it!

I made this sauce as a topping for a cheesecake, and found that  the cornstarch made it too gelatinous to work cold. I remade the recipes and added the sauce directly to the cheesecake, swirling it in. The flavor was exactly what I was looking for, the sweet citrus from the sauce complimenting the mildness of the cream cheese

When we made the sauce it turned out runny for us because we used frozen blueberries. We added more cornstarch and water and it thickened it right up. We will make this sauce again. It was wonderful.

Followed the recipe exactly, but it tasted too much like orange juice still. So I cooked it a few minutes more to see if the blueberries might take over. Didn't work.  I made it the night before for brunch the next day. Still tasted like blueberries in OJ. I won't be using this one again.

Took others advice and cut down the orange juice to 3/4 cup and added a handful more frozen blueberries and it was awesome!  Had no almond extract so did without it but next time...and oh yes....there will be a next time!!

I used the basic recipe but did make a few changes because I was worried it was going to be too sweet. I wanted it a bit more savory than sweet so I used only 3/4 cup of sugar. I did use full amount of orange juice/water. In the middle of making it, I realized I didn't have any cinnamon left! After a few moments of panic and scrounging through the cupboard for some kind of replacement, I found some celestial seasonings gingerbread teabags.  In the spirit of experimentation and improvising, I put one of those teabags in the sauce while it simmered, let it steep in there for a few minutes then pulled it out. It worked great!  I skipped the vanilla extract and used a few drops of raspberry extract instead. It tastes great. Not too overly sweet and I like the combination of flavors. The next time I make it, I think I will use a package of blueberries and a package of raspberries. Can't wait to try it over my gingerbread and over brie torte!

I  doubled the recipe, I followed exactly except did not have quite enough OJ, so had to add a little more water .I used frozen wild blueberries.  This is delicious, we had it over NY style cheesecake (Chantal's recipe on allrecipes).  Perfect combo.

This is great and SO easy!!!    I wanted to serve it as a topping for the lemon pound cake I made for Thanksgiving dessert..... so I took the advice of other reviewers and made it early in the day to give the flavors time to meld together.   It only took a few minutes to put together-- and when we served it with dessert, the flavor and texture were both perfect.  Also-- it makes a lot, so it will likely be topping pancakes tomorrow morning :)
I did not add the cinnamon-- but that was only b/c I didn't have any on hand, and didn't have time for a last-minute Thanksgiving Day run to the store.  I'm sure it would be great with the cinnamon added, too!

I've made this several times and it's delicious. I have at times tried substituting pomegranate juice for some of the liquid with yummy results. After I use this as a pancake topping on the night that I make it, I keep it in the fridge and use it to flavor and sweeten plain, cooked oatmeal. I've sometimes used raspberries in place of some of the blueberries as well.

Have tried a few sauce / syrup recipes for our family weekend waffles but have stopped looking. The best part is that you change the blueberries for just about any fruit and it always turns out great. Have tried with plums, apples, pineapples, cherries and strawberries with great results. Thanks.

Halved the recipe as I only had one punnet of blueberries and it came out perfectly.  Stirred some into Greek yoghurt and it was beautiful.

This is amazing! The flavor does come out a bit as it cools, so making ahead shouldn't be an issue. Not too sweet. Just right! My husband took over making it with little help, and he does NOT cook! But he was quite proud of himself!

It's an awesome recipe. I really haven't changed anything (except maybe add a little extra almond extract) and that is only due to my taste buds. I have made this 4 times now and it's going to be stored in my favorites for a long time. The key is to not serve it right away. The longer it sits, the yummier it becomes.

This is just fantastic!  I used thawed frozen blueberries and used the liquid for part of the water and I think it added some flavor.  My orange juice was not overly strong (some complained about the overwhelming OJ taste) so I think the amount was fine.  One suggestion, though, let it sit for awhile before serving.  If you taste it right after cooking, you will find the flavors have not melded and the OJ may stand out.  I made the sauce and took off to cool while I made pancakes.  Then before serving, I reheated it and the sauce was just great! I think other fruits would do quite well with the recipe, also.

Great recipe! The only thing I would change is lessen corn starch  to 2 T. Everyone loved this on waffles and ice cream.

I love blueberrys so I was disappointed when the taste of them was overpowered by the almond extract and the cinnamon.

The flavor was delicious but I like complexity so for me, the blueberries, orange juice, almond extract - all of it was wonderful.   I didn't have cornstarch so I looked online for substitutions and they suggested flour but flour did not thicken the sauce but left lumps in it (which still tasted good)!

This is a very simple recipe. I followed recipe as written and per reviewer suggestions let it rest for roughly 2 hours before reheating and serving over french toast and topped with whipped cream. Thanks for the recipe!

I made it exactly like the recipe. I let it sit in the refrigerator over night. It was great. I have made it a favorite recipe. I also thought that there was too much OJ in the recipe but read the reviews and decided to make it as is. It really needs to sit for awhile before you use it.

i read the reviews first, noticed that many said it was better after it sat for a while. I made it the night before I needed it and it was DELICIOUS. Exactly as the recipe said it would be. Definetly a keeper.

Loved this recipe! So easy to make. I've made it several times now as a topping for my waffles. Most recently, I used fresh squeezed orange juice because i didn't have OJ on hand and and tasted great. Also, I decided I like a thinner syrup so tried using 2 Tbsp cornstarch instead of three which worked quite well.

We only had frozen orange juice, unprepared.  I scooped some of that in, and added a tiny bit of H2O.  It was unreal!  So good!  I grew up with blueberry sauce, but the citrus added a transformative touch.

Spectacular.  Perfect as an ice cream topping and I will definitely be using it on waffles, pancakes and cakes!  Good the first day, even better the second.  The only changes I made were I added about 1 cup extra frozen blueberries and I used 1 cup of fresh squeezed mandarin orange juice rather than regular orange juice because it was what I had on hand.  I love the hint of almond that it has.  Unlike some other reviewers (maybe due to the use of fresh squeezed mandarin juice) the orange flavor was not an issue, I'd venture to say it was unnoticeable unless you knew it was in there.

I appreciated this recipe mostly to show me the proportions to use - berries, water, sugar, etc.  I didn't have OJ but did have oranges, so I "supremed" one, cooked the sections with the berries (they fall apart), and added all the resulting juice.  Didn't pay attention to the flavoring amount and put in a tsp of vanilla (don't care for almond extract) - too much!  But I had a stash of frozen lemon zest, so I mixed in about a tablespoon of zest and that fixed that!  Good, simple recipe for a quick dress up.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe and find this sauce a bit too sweet for me. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and maybe add a twist of lemon. This is a great way to top your waffles, pancakes or French toast.

this recipe was excellent with 2 changes, since  the store did not have a small bag of frozen blueberry, but had a small bag of blueberry and strawberry mix, i used it. also i thought the 3/4 cup of sugar would be a bit much, i added sugar by one tablespoon at a time, stirring and tasting it, three tablespoons was perfect to me.  i used it for the topping on my cheesecake and my friend said it was the best cheesecake i have ever made!! oh, and i omitted the almond extract and cinnamon. but i  might  try it with, next time. this recipe is a "keeper"!

Great waffle-topper! I left out the almond extract and cinnamon.

This is a delicious.  I modified the recipe slightly:  2 cups of frozen blueberries, 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 orange juice, 1/4 water, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  All other ingredient measurements remained the same.  I first brought the blueberries, sugar, orange juice, and water to a boil.  I then strained the juice, placed the juice back on the pot, added the water/cornstarch mixture to the pot.  I allowed the sauce to thicken.  Removed the pot from the heat, added the vanilla and cinnamon.  Next time I don't think I would add the cinnamon or I would add less cinnamon.

This was amazing! I will make it again! I followed the recipe's directions for orange juice, and I think it was great and not overpowering like some felt. I did make some changes due to the ingredients I had on hand, but it made for a great base recipe! I used saskatoon berries and added in some raspberries for tartness. I cut the sugar in half as well because I was looking for a more tart flavor, and figured I would add more later if it needed it. I skipped the almond and cinnamon because I wanted the fruit taste only, and lastly I had to thicken it with tapioca instead of cornstarch. Amazing!

This stuff is awesome and so easy! I didn't have any OJ or Almond extract so in a pinch I used raspberry lemonade and vanilla extract. Was fantastic!

Good flavor, but this is too much cornstarch.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and once the cornstarch was added, it thickened IMMEDIATELY.  It was so thick that I had to thin it out with quite a bit more water which resulted in diluting the flavor of the sauce a little.  Don't make without the almond extract, as that's a wonderful addition to this sauce.  If I make this again, I'll start with half the amount of cornstarch, and if the sauce needs to thicken, I'll then add more cornstarch.  This was good, but I must say it's not my favorite recipe.

Delicious versatile sauce.  Only had Strawberry Orange Banana juice so used that and cut the sugar to a half cup. I'm glad I kept in the almond extract and cinnamon, the flavors blended very well.  Served warm over banana pancakes.  I'll be picking up some vanilla ice cream to try the leftovers on!

I had TONS of blueberries from our produce co-op and decided to try this. It is easy to make and perfect for so many things! I refrigerated it overnight (as suggested) and had some on Belgian waffles the next morning! Yum!  It was also tasty on Greek yogurt and vanilla ice cream (like cobbler without the crust).

I thought this recipe was delicious, but I did tweak it a bit based on what I had on hand. I skipped the extract all together, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup which is plenty. We really only drink OJ with pineapple in it, so I used that and it's still good. The pineapple is pretty subtle in the juice. Like the other reviewers said, it is pretty orange-y but the blueberry really starts to shine when you give it time to sit. One of the reviewers said that cinnamon would distract from the intended blueberry flavor, but I think it adds a nice touch. I used fresh blueberries. Loved this on cheesecake and can't wait to try it on waffles! I plan on freezing the leftovers, which was recommended by a reviewer.

I didn't have any syrup for our pancakes this morning but I had a ton of blueberries so I made this.  It turned out great! The only thing I did different was that I pureed it at the end to make it more of a smooth sauce. It worked beautifully. Me and my VERY picky kids loved it!

I substituted the orange juice for Sunny D, a tropical citrus punch, and it was amazing! We were out of almond extract, so I didn't use it. I also learned that it it better chilled on french toast. I would make this recipe again!

This sauce was great!  I made it to go over mini cheesecakes.  After reading reviews, I made it 2 days ahead of our party to let the flavors blend.  Then I reheated it in a saucepan before we served the cheesecakes.  Fantastic!  Would also be great on pancakes or waffles!

This was an excellent recipe. I just happened to have almond extract! Not something I keep in the kitchen all the time. I used Welch's red grape juice instead of orange juice because that's just what I had - still turned out great! I'm excited to find out what it tastes like with orange juice! Even my picky husband seemed to enjoy it. Ate with waffles and a little whipped cream.

I thought this blueberry sauce was wonderful!  Unlike some other reviewers, I did not fin he orange juice flavor overpowering at all, even upon serving it immediately.  While I could taste a hint of orange, I could also taste a hint of almond and cinnamon, but the primary star was the blueberries (I used frozen).  The only change I made to this recipe was reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup and I would not hesitate to do it again, as it was plenty sweet for us.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, ISYBEL!

Had some old blueberries in the freezer and I used them to make this sauce for waffles.  It turned out great!  Easy to make.  It turned out rally thick.  I may not use as much cornstarch next time.

OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING! Used a bit of vanilla instead of almond essence and it couldn't be any yummier! Served it over a blueberry cheesecake, and it's safe to say, the two were beyond fantastic together. Everyone love it!

Yum, yum, yum! Quick and easy to make with frozen blueberries. I had to use vanilla as I had no almond extract. Loved the addition of cinnamon. Next time I'd use only two tablespoons of cornstarch.

Great recipe.  I reduced the cornstarch and accompanying water by a 3rd and the sugar to 1/2 cup and felt that I could have left out even more to fully allow the blueberry/orange flavor to dominate, including the more tangy notes of their spectrum.

Um, based on the reviews from my kids, this recipe will be a staple in our house. My 7-year announced, "Even when I've been dead 1,000 years, I'll want more of this!" She may be a goofball, but I have to agree that this was awesome on homemade waffles from this site.

This recipe was so good to me. I thought it would be weird because of the cinnamon but I have to say it was very good. Saved it to my box!

This is an absolutely delicious recipe that I have made many times.  I replace the sugar for Splenda.  Purely healthy on Bisquick Heart Smart Belgian Waffles.

This sauce was wonderful.  Not to sweet.  The only change I made was I didn't have orange juice so I used pineapple juice.  It was great.

I cut this in half so as not to waste much in case it doesn't turn out right plus 2 cups might be too much for our family. I used less orange juice and less sugar. No almond extract just bcause I didn't have any on hand. This tasted good right off the stove.  I'm sure it will be even better once it sits and cools.

I don't ever have orange juice in my house so I substituted with apple juice instead. I also accidentally added too much cinnamon but it still turned out really good. My daughter is a very picky eater but ended up having two helpings which shocked me. Very good recipe. Not too sweet but just right.

This is great with fresh or frozen blueberries. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 c with both the fresh and the frozen blueberries and it was awesome. I will try making this with raspberries and blackberries.

WOW! This was great! I didn't have blueberries so I used a mixture of raspberries, blackberries and strawberries. It was delicious. Any mixture of berries would work as mine did. Thanks for the recipe. I will use this on cheesecakes, pancakes, waffles, etc.!!

I made as is with the exception of ommiting the almond extract and cinnamon at the end (my almond extract went awol). It was good without it though. Had it over vanilla ice cream with some sliced banana. I will most certainly make it again!!!

As written, I would have to give this four stars. In my opinion, 1 cup of OJ is too much. Certainly that is personal preference, but I knocked that down to 1/4 cup of OJ and I thought that was perfect. I still had a hint of that fabulous citrus flavor, but it didn't overwhelm, it simply complemented. I also lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was the perfect sweetness. I kept all the other ingredients the same and found it to be wonderful in both taste and consistency. We love this over pancakes and waffles in the morning, and over vanilla ice cream in the afternoon. Yum!!! Oh, and sometimes I use the almond extract called for, and sometimes I use 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Both ways are delicious. It's just a matter of whatever I feel like adding at the time.

Made this exactly as the recipe was written.  I had 5 cups of fresh berries, so I adjusted all of the ingredients accordingly.  This yielded 9 jelly jars of sauce, which are now in my pressure canner.  

My husband and daughter taste tested the sauce and I am the Hero of the Day. They are looking forward to pancakes tomorrow morning with this yummy sauce on it.

I made this recipe as a topping for my son's birthday cheesecake.  I drastically reduced the sugar to a scant 1/4 c and used Hazelnut Liquor as a last minute save instead of Almond Extract.  I did not think that the orange flavor was too strong right after making or later.  Perhaps cutting the sugar helps?  Everyone loved it and agreed it was sweet enough.  I would not hesitate to make this again.

I really liked this recipe, but one thing I will change next time is not to add the almond extract or to add maybe 1/4 tsp instead of the 1/2 tsp.,I could really taste it and felt it overpowered the blueberries.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly (except that I didnt have orange juice, so I hand-squeezed 3 large mandarins) and I have to admit that I was surprised of the quality of the finished product; "5-star restaurant"-grade blueberry sauce!!! It is the perfect sweetness and is quite light compared to other similar sauces. As per the other reviews, you will find that the sauce is not at its peak and has a slight citrus flavour the moment you've finished making it. After refrigerating it for 2 hours, all the flavours came together and the citrus zest was gone. Used it on blueberry buckle from allrecipes.com (perfect if blueberries are on sale and/or if your guests LOVE blueberries!!!)

All I had was grape/cranberry juice but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I served it with pound cake and whipped cream and it was fantastic.

Really good, although I didn't follow to a T based on other reviews.  I'm not a fan of orange juice to begin with but I didn't want to miss out if it was worth adding, so I just added 1/4 cup + 1T lemon juice.  Only other change made was reducing cornstarch to 1T. I didn't bother w/cinnamon because it's not something I normally put w/blueberries, but the almond extract was worth it!  Good stuff over vanilla ice cream. :)

Awesome. My picky household gave it a five. Nice delicate favors. Entire batch was gone before noon over pancakes.  I only used 3/4 oj and 2 tb cornstarch and 1/8 tsp almond extract.

This is WONDERFUL! I followed the recipe, but used a bit less sugar {1/2cup} & O.J {3/4 cup} & it turned out great! I'm trying it right now over my home-made buttermilk cake-YUMMY! Out-of-this-world! 

Thanks ISYBEL for sharing your sweet recipe. Can't wait to buy more fresh blueberries to make it again.

Absolutely wonderful! This has become my family's (7 of us) favorite fruit syrup and they even like it better than traditional pancake syrup (which they love by the way).

tasted like homemade cranberry sauce, very orange-y and cinnamon-y, and also very thick.  Did not get better overnight.   I actually prefer the canned blueberry sauce over this.

The orange juice was a bit of a problem. I made the sauce the night before, as some people recommended, and reduced the orange juice to 3/4 cup, but it was still very strong. It overpowered the blueberry flavor. The sauce was also a bit too thick. Next time I will significantly reduce the corn starch.

We thought this was excellent; however I did use half the amount of sugar because we don’t like anything overly sweet.  Be sure to add the cinnamon as it gives it a nice zip.

YUM! The only change I made was to use less sugar - I used 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup.  I found this to be the right amount of sweetness and the full amount would likely be too sweet for me. At first I thought it would be too orangey, but once it sat for about an hour, all the flavors blended really well. I loved the addition of almond extract - don't leave it out!  I served this over pancakes on New Year's Day and it was a huge hit!

Absolutely hands down delicious!  Let the flavors meld and watch it disappear.  I would never have thought those ingredients would enhance the blueberries - but it's easy to make and flavorful to eat.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was so-o very good!  An incredibly delicious treat over angel food cake and a dollop of whipped topping.  Though I made it in July, the flavors made me think of Christmas!  This is now my favorite desert!

I can't believe how good this is! I followed the recipe as it's written and absolutely love it. I could just eat it by itself (and i have)! I made it last night to go with crepes, and then used my leftovers for pancakes (Fluffy Pancakes) with whipped cream! If you eat this sauce with whipped cream, which i highly recommend, then make the whipped cream yourself... you'll be glad you did.

Loved it!  Was uncertain about the almond extract, but made the recipe as is, and it turned out wonderfully.  The almond really adds something special!  Agree with other reviewers that it is even better after an hour or so for the flavours to marry.

Made this for the first time this morning and we ate it on pancakes. Definitely more of a sauce than a syrup, so this would be perfect on cheesecake. We really liked it (even as thick as it was) on our pancakes! Everyone in my family said it was delicious!

Very tasty.  I did not think it had a strong citrus flavor.  I had it right after I made it and also a few days later and it was delicious both times.  I used it as a topping for waffles and also as a spread for biscuits.  Will make this again.

I made this on a whim to put over vanilla ice cream.  Yum!!!  I didn't have almond extract so I used a splash of amaretto in its place.  I will definitely make it again and again.

Not altogether unpleasant but overpowered by orange and cinnamon leaving little to no blueberry flavor which was disappointing.

Very easy to make!  Will definitely use less cornstarch next time ~ it was very thick. Didn't actually taste yet as others said it was better after a day or two. Looking forward to trying it!

Excellent sauce! As recommended by others, I make it at least a day ahead to allow flavors to marry. I also recommend freshly squeezed orange juice - it improves the flavor even more. You can use any combination of berries; I usually use frozen with success.

Just made this sauce. It is still hot. It has a good taste and good consistency. If true that is tastes better overnight, then tomorrow might get 5 stars.
I used slightly less orange juice not to overpower the blueberries and less sugar to make it lighter.

Wonderful!!! We had on waffles, & it was delicious. I think this would be a fabulous cheesecake topping!

I agree with the other posters - make ahead of time & let it sit a while. I served this just a bit warm, & it was amazing. Even my picky husband & son couldn't get enough!

I didn't have an almond extract, so I substituted raspberry extract - SO GOOD! I can't wait to see what almond does for it...

Love this sauce and it is so versatile. It's good with french toast, pancakes, waffles, and ice cream. And it is better when you make it ahead and let it chill and then reheat.

I've followed similar recipes for cranberry sauce, but never thought to use blueberries!  Wonderful.  I didn't have any oj, so subbed in lemonade, and it was fantastic.

Far too sweet for my taste. I've made blueberry sauce for years and don't add sugar, and I always get compliments when I serve it to guests.

I doubled this recipe and it turned out way too thin for my liking.  I thought this would be a thicker sauce.

Delicious, and very simple to put together. This is a great change from regular pancake syrup. What a great use for some of those delicious blueberries!

This was great.  I had a house warming party yesterday, and we were left with 3 cups of left over fresh blue berries.  since the inlaws stayed the night I just got up, made French toast and this sauce...  I couldn't get the conversion to 12 servings (3 cups) to work, so I just winged it, but it turned out wonderful.

This is a great sauce!  And so easy too!  A friend brought me blueberries from her garden and other than muffins I had no idea what to do with them.  So glad I found this recipe!  I noticed that a reviewer said not to freeze the sauce because it does not thaw well.  Has anyone tried canning it?

I used this recipe on whole grain waffles for Father's day. We subbed out the blueberries for blackberries b/c he loves them. Everyone devoured them!! I did make this the night before b/c of the other reviews that said it was better used later than right away.   Thanks so much for adding it.

This was just okay.  I made this with mixed berries and served with some french toast.  Okay, but I wouldn't go through the trouble again unless I had some berries to get rid of (like this time).

This was fantastic and easy. Added a tiny bit of freshly squeezed lemon juice and let it sit and cool for about an hour. I reheated it with a couple of splashes of red wine, and served over pound cake and frozen yogurt. At the refrigerated leftovers alongside a couple scoops of plain nonfat yogurt. Yum!

Pretty good and easy to make.  I felt it could use a bit more sugar, though, and one of my guests made the same comment.  Everyone ate it over pancakes.  If I try it again, I'll see about making it a bit sweeter.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted great served fresh and warm over puffed pancakes with whipped cream.  I used 1/4 cup frozen cranberry juice + 3/4 water instead of orange juice, modified the extract to 1/4 tsp orange extract and 1/4 tsp almond extract, and used flour/water to thicken.   Next time will cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup for a tangier sauce.

Okay, so I had pound cake so I made this sauce to go with it. Except, I didn't have orange juice, almond extract, or cinnamon (completely unusual). So... I used pineapple juice, vanilla, and allspice and it was fantastic!! Very versatile recipe. I can't wait to try it as it was written.

Wow! Fantastic and super quick!  Next time (and there will be many next times), I will prep the corn starch before starting items on the stove so all the materials will be directly on hand. I can't wait to try this with other berries.

Everyone is right about leaving it to let the flavors meld.  I canned mine mostly.  The flavours really come out after it has sat for a bit.  It was a bit thicker than I wanted.  Next blueberry season, I will add less cornstarch.

Easy and delicious. Be sure to dissolve the cornstarch in water and not dump it into the mixture (my stupid mistake, I know) or it will clump and affect the texture. I served it with beignets and it put them over the top. I will never buy blueberry syrup again.

This was an excellent blueberry sauce, however it makes a LOT. I made it to serve with a cheesecake I made and there was a ton left. Half would have done for that purpose.

LOVED it.  The only change I would make in future is to add maybe another half cup to a cup of blueberries just to increase the amount of fruit and to cut the almond extract back to 1/4 tsp.  It worked very well as a crepe filling.  I made it ahead of time and then reheated it in a saucepan.  Good consistency.

This was pretty tasty, but I don't think the almond extract added to it.  Next time I'll try it with vanilla, or just without any extract.

I used frozen mixed berries and halved the recipe it was plenty for 6 waffle toppings.

I used this sauce to top home made cheesecake with our hand picked huckleberries and it turned out great!  Instead of OJ, I used a heaping tablespoon of peach juice concentrate and added just a little more water.  It was so scrumptious, and makes a lot of sauce.

If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  You can't buy this kind of flavor in a store.  As with a previous reviewer, I cut the cornstarch to using 2 TBLS rather than 3.  This would be to the taste of your guests. I felt that 2 TBLS still made a reasonably thick sauce.  I prepared the sauce roughly 1 hour prior to serving, and guests commented on no undesireable orange flavor even when I ask them about it.  Thank you for a great recipe. My grandkids are going to love it.

My comment shouldnt count because I altered it a lot. But here I go anyway in case someone wants my advise. I used what I had (blackberries) and it was super. I used freshly squeezed OJ which i think helped not have that "overpowering" Oj taste a lot of folks mentioned. I used vanilla because I didnt have almond extract. Everything elsed remains the same. Fabulous. I really liked this over fresh homemade waffles. Oh and kind of squish the berries a little as they cook to get the huge chunks of berries a little smaller.

This was a nice sauce.  I made it with frozen mixed berried and put it on my New York cheesecake.  It was way better than store- bought pie fillings (of course).  I''ve also used it as a filling for crepes, and that's great too. I reduce the amount of sugar in nearly everything I make, but I don't recommend that with this recipe because it comes out rather bitter and flavorless.  Just put it all in there and say that the healthiness of the berries makes up for it.

Okay, I tried this and it was easy and delicious, I used the blueberries that my mom picked and we freeze them, I didn't have orange juice but I took a can on mandarin oranges put it in the food processor pureed it and added some lemon juice and that made up for shortage of the orange juice. I didn't use a full 3 tbsps of cornstarch I used 2 tbsps and 1 tsps of it. And it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe good with pancakes I like to put maple syrup on my pancakes and put the blueberry sauce over it it was yummy.

This was a total hit!  I used it as a cheesecake topping and it was amazing!  We used the leftovers on pancakes and ice cream and just as great all around.  I only used 2 Tbsp of cornstarch and it was perfectly syrupy at that!  This is one for the recipe box!

Decreased to 4 servings and made as is. great taste but I did add some more water because the sauce got too thick for me. Served with "Whole Grain Waffles." Next time, I would like to try them on pancakes.

I love the almond, orange, and cinnamon flavors in this! And my breakfast guests always love it, too. Great on whole wheat pancakes.   I don't add quite as much sugar as called for, though, and added a pinch of nutmeg.

This was pretty good.  I used blackberries instead of blueberries and vanilla instead of almond extract because that's all I had.  I tasted just like blackberry cobbler filling.  I will probably make it again.

I made this blueberry sauce to go with the "Fluffy Two Step Cheesecake I" from Allrecipes.  The two together were perfect!  I did change the recipe a bit.  I only added 1/2 cup of oj and put in an extra 1/2 cup of water.  I also used about 2 tbs of cornstarch because I wanted the sauce to be a little on the runny side.  I only put a sprinkle or two of cinnamon and omitted the almond extract because I didn't have any.  The sauce turned out great!.  At first I could taste the cinnamon (I thought it took away from the blueberry flavor), but two days later you couldn't taste it any more and the over all flavor of the sauce turned out perfect!  I froze half of it and will save it for the next time I'm craving yummy cheese cake with a blueberry topping!

I liked this.. Even used agave instead of sugar and fresh squeezed orange juice!  I made this to put over top the "blueberry buckle" from this site, instead of a crumb topping and it was AMAZING! Highly recommend giving that a shot if you've got a lot of blueberries. I believe other reviewers when they say the sauce is better the next day.  It was all gone the first night, so next time I'll make more so I can have extras!

This recipe is so delicious! It is perfect on belgium waffles but I'm sure great on anything! I like using frozen blueberries because they seem to hold up really well and they are usually more cost effective. I don't think you lose any flavor. The orange juice flavor can be slightly overpowering if you eat right away. The flavors blend perfectly if you can make it the day before and refrigerate overnight.

This recipe was okay, but far from my favorite.  It just seemed like it was missing something.  It tasted good and the kids loved it on their waffles, but I think it will just be used as a standby until I find a better recipe

I made this the night before and when I tasted it I thought too much orange. The next morning I warmed it up and tasted it again and still too much orange, but tried it on my pancakes anyway. Yum! It went nicely with the syrup.

Absolutely the best!  I made this recipe using Raw Turbinado sugar and Schwan's frozen blueberries.  The sauce turned out perfectly, not too thin or thick.  Served it on pancakes and it was delicious, right from the stove.  We enjoyed the leftovers three days later with no change in flavor.  Kudos!  Absolute keeper!

Instead of orange juice I used lemon juice. I think lemon juice goes well with fruit. I couldn't believe it was so simple and tasted like I spent a lot nore than five minutes on it. It's great!!

This was very yummy with the fresh Canadian blueberries I used, however, I think I will attempt it again without the cinnamon. I love cinnamon, but in this recipe, I think even the small amount it calls for, takes away from the true blueberry flavor. I mixed it in with my morning yogurt...sooo good!

Oh man, this was good!  I gambled on a new recipe by tripling it so I could have some to freeze and it really paid off!  Such a good breakfast topping and I am sure that it will be great on everything else, and really on its own, too!

I made my blueberry sauce to the letter of the recipe. The only thing I wished I had done was to omit the cinnamon. I am not a big fan and knew that it would not sit well for me. Since I was not the only one eating it, I felt I should allow others to give me their opinions. They felt it was very good. I will be using this on pancakes next....minus the cinnamon. Truly a treat...!

This was awesome!  I used lemonade rather than the orange juice, and splenda in place of the sugar.  Everyone loved it and requested the recipe.

Followed recipe exactly and turned out fabulous!  I loved the flavor.  Great on vanilla ice cream.  Great the next day.  I heated on the stove as I was worried about the blueberries not surviving the microwave well.

I SERVED THIS WITH A NEW YORK CHEESECAKE I MADE, AND IT WAS THE PERFECT TOPPING.  THEN I USED LEFTOVER SAUCE FOR WAFFLES A FEW DAYS LATER.  I MICROWAVED IT FOR 40 SECONDS , AS IT HAS CONGEALED.  IT WAS WARM AND STICKY AND TERRIFIC ON THE WAFFLES.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE

I made a Pineapple Angel food cake... by adding one can crushed pineapple to one box angel food mix in a 9x13 pan... this blueberry sauce and some fresh whip cream went perfect on top and was a huge hit!  Yum!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I adjusted the sugar to 3/4 c. plus 2 tbsp. Splenda Sugar Blend because my husband is a diabetic.  I agree with others this taste even better the second day.  We love   blueberries and will be making this on a regular basis.

This was great, I used 1/2 oj 1/2 water and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. It came together quickly and I served it over Lemon Cream Cheese French Toast.

I just realized I forgot the cinnamon & almond extract and this recipe still deserves 5 stars.  It's fantastic, not too much OJ at all.
