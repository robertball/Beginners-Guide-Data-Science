This is by far one of my favorite Puerto Rican dishes and reminds me of my many trips to the island and my mom cooking growing up.  I made this exactly as the recipe calls out and I have only one issue with it.  It is incredibly salty and I was unable to continue eating it.  Normally I like salty foods, but this asked for 3 tablespoons of Adobo in addition to the ham and 2 tablespoons of olive brine.  I think maybe 3 teaspoons was meant, but that may even be too much with the sodium from the other sources as well.  I will definitely make this again since this is my kids and my favorite meal, but I will use less of the Adobo while preparing and add it post cooking to taste.

Agree with too much Adobo (or I would of given 5 stars). I used 2 1/2 tbs, but used 3 cups water and 2 cups rice and came out perfect. It was just as good as my Puerto Rican great-grandmother’s Abuela Mayo!

My boyfriend is Puerto Rican and loves this! I actually omit the gandules, adobo seasoning, and olives since he doesn’t like that part he just likes the meat and rice haha. And his family uses canned Vienna sausages so that’s what I use. I’m not a huge fan but like I said my bf and his family love this rice.

Had been so long since i had made this, i had forgotten how to do it. This recipe came out to the tee... with the exception of me doubling the rice/water ratio and using 4 Tbs of adobo and two sazón pks.

It was inedible with how much salt that is in the recipe. DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE! It is a total waste of good food.

Oh, gaak!  Don't make this recipe! There has to be a mistake.  3T of Adobo makes this so insanely salty, it's inedible.  What a waste of ingredient$.  Maybe it was supposed to be 3t, but I'd rather look for another recipe.  When this dish is made properly-- IT IS INCREDIBLE.  But not this recipe.

A little salty, and only used 2 tbsp Adobe based on another review, next time I will cut back to 1 tbsp. I also added a little cumin for taste. Good recipe, simple to make. My Puerto Rican boyfriend said it was good, except for the  salt. I will make again.
