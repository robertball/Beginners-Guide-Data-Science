I followed this recipe to a TEE and it was fantastic.  I used all the water recommended and all the sugar.  I found it not too watery and not too sweet.  I did find that it took about 50 minutes to get well-browned, and I even turned the heat up to 400 after 35 minutes. I used hard little tart apples - Im not sure what kind they were but I think the tartness was what kept this recipe from being overly sugary.  I think the right choice of apples may be key!  Its a wonderful recipe and I will definitely make it again.  EDITED:  Since my original review, I have made this recipe 4 additional times with different types of apples and they were all pretty darn fantastic.  I have decided that I like cooking it in a hotter oven (400) and it seems to get done in about the time stated.  Tonight I tried it without peeling the apples, and it was very good this way as well - if you dont mind apple skins.  For company, I might peel them, but my boyfriend and I enjoyed the version with peels very well - he even said he liked it better (though I disagree).

Can you say "UMMM, UMMMM!" I didn't have oats on hand, so I wanted an apple crip recipe that didn't call for any, this one was great! Very simple, though cutting & peeling the apples take a long time. I used five large granny smith apples and a 9X13 glass pan so I had to increase all the ingredients by half and it worked out fine. I mixed brown & white sugar as others suggested and baked it 8 minutes longer and got a wonderful crispy topping! I will be making this again, for sure!!

This was really simple and delicious--vanilla ice cream a must.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the crust mix and sprinkled about 1/4 cup of brown sugar on top.  Worked like a charm.  It was AWESOME.

I took the advise of other reviewers and cooked for 50 minutes.  The top was real crunchy!  I also used 1/2 a cup white sugar and 1/2 a cup brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  Next time I think I will add the cinnamon to the topping mixture instead of right on top of the apples.

This was delicious!  Like others, I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar for the topping.  Also I added 1 tsp cinnamon.  We ate it warm with vanilla ice cream.  I don't care for oatmeal, so this recipe was just what I was looking for.  Thanks!!!

This was so easy and so yummy! The only recommendation I'd make is...use Granny Smith apples! I tried Granny Smith & Golden Delicious mixed, but it was the tartness of the Granny Smith's with the sweetness of the crispy topping that really made this dish stand out.

I reduced the water.  The "crumb" mix wasn't really crumby, I think I used too much butter, but I ran out of flour to try to fix it. It looked more like apple dumplings than a crisp. But the taste was excellent, so no harm done.

This recipe was wonderful -- I do have to agree though that it was even better with Granny Smith apples.

This is delicious! The reason for the four stars though is that I had to make significant changes considering it's a simple recipe. When I made this as directed, it was good, but not delicious. My changes as follows: 1. I used 5 smallish apples 2. I sprinkled the tops of the apple slices generously with cinnamon. I used closer to 1 TBSP 3. I used about 1/4C of apple juice instead of water 4. I used 1/2C white sugar + 1/2C brown sugar 5. I did add a splash of vanilla (1tsp?)Makes a lot of difference 6. When I mixed the topping ingredients, I added the full 3/4C flour but it seemed too "wet" of a mix (even before the vanilla I added) especially because the apple stuff has lots of moisture. SO, I also added flour 1TBSP at a time until it was perfect. Dry and crumbly still a might "damp". 7. I also baked it closer to 50 minutes. But I checked it every 5 minutes after the first 40 so as not to over bake. The end result was an out of this world dessert.

Wow, a perfect comfort food! To make the topping extra crunchy, I mixed the flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar together, then cut in the cold, refrigerated butter with a pastry blender. I also added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to the apples instead of the water because I love the lemon flavor. You will get a golden brown, crunchy topping if you bake it for 50 minutes. I use Empire or Granny Smith apples because they soften gently while baking and do not become mushy. I will be making this often.

This should have about 1,000 five star ratings!  You can tweak it by spicing the apples a little, or mixing 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, but however you prefer it, it's decadent and easy!  I took this to a wealthy retired folks soiree and it was gobbled up...I even caught someone sticking a baggie full in his pocket!!!  I make it every fall and I can never get enough...thanks for this new family recipe!

I used no water (after all, there's no water in apple pie if you think about it) and found none was necessary.  Given others' comments about the topping being doughy I took heed of that and upped the amount of flour, using one cup each of the sugar and flour.  Rather than a feeble attempt to evenly distribute the cinnamon by sprinkling it atop the apples, I ensured that would happen by mixing the cinnamon in with the topping instead. I also added a couple of handfuls of fresh blueberries because I had them to use.  It turned the dessert a kind of weird looking purple color, but the blueberry/apple combination was pretty darned good. This is a good "go-to" recipe if you prefer apple crisp without oatmeal, but I do think it's important to increase the flour by 1/4 cup.

This is almost exactly like my grandmother's recipe.  Except we just crumble the butter, flour and sugar all together with a pastry blender.  That helps get those crispy crumbs instead of a gooey dough.  Also, put it under the broiler for 30 seconds or so to crisp the top without making the apples too soggy.

This is great with apples, but tonight I made it with a frozen 16oz bag of Trader Joe's Fancy Berry Medley, and it was superb. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the topping, poured the frozen berries into an 8x8 pan (no water), sprinkled the berries with some allspice, and then the topping. I even accidentally melted the butter instead of softening it, and it still turned out great. A scoop of vanilla ice cream would have put it over the top, but it's good as is.  This is a fantastic recipe!

This is the best apple crisp I have ever eaten. Not to mention the easiest!!  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar in the topping and baked it for 50 minutes and it turned out wonderful.  I made a 13 X 9 pan of it so I 1 & 1/2 times the recipe.Instead of the cinnamon in the recipe I substituted apple pie spice and it tasted just like the apple pies I make except it doesn't have the crust (which I prefer anyway). The only thing missing when it was done was a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, but I plan on having that on hand the next time I make it (which will be very soon). Thank you so much for this recipe, I am sure it will be frequently made.

I made this back in the winter and didn't have any rolled oats.  This was so good and one of the few apple crisp recipes that doesn't contain rolled oats.  Thanks!

My cupboards were bare, I had two apples and my family wanted dessert.  (I halved the recipe).  Wow!  We drooled over the smell wafting through our house and the taste delivered.  This not only goes in my permanent recipes for simplicity, economy, and ease, but taste as well!  This is an all around winner.  This is good enough to serve to guests.  My only recommendation is, if possible, use at least 2 variety of apples...one of them being a granny smith the other being being a braeburn, honeycrisp or some other red baking type apple (not red delicious) for a supreme texture.  Having only granny smith apples, it still turned out great, however.

TWO THUMBS UP! I am an inexperienced cook, but I wanted to make an apple crisp, so I was pleased to find this recipe. Not only was it fast and easy to make, but it was delicious.  My fiance was very impressed!  I used 1/2 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar and increased the cooking time to 50 minutes. I also added cinnamon to the topping.  My topping came out brown and crisp, just as I wanted it!  Thanks Carrie!

I cannot even begin to describe how good this was! My evening social group has some apple trees out behind the shed that were getting many ripe apples on it, so I used this recipe to make a dessert for one of our social nights.  I'm passing along twenty "two thumbs up" for this recipe, along with my own! I also have the memorable comment "It smells like a candle!" to toss in too.  

I found that, however, the topping didn't seem to crumble, but instead turned doughy.  I flattened it and layered it as a crust, and the taste was still good!  The apples I used were juicy enough that adding water to the pan didn't seem necessary.  I skipped it the second time I made it.

This is absolutely delicious! I made it exactly as written, but I baked it at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. Don't be put off by the liquid which remains at the bottom of the pan after it's cooked--it makes it juicier than apple pie with a similiar taste. Four cups of apples was four large MacIntosh apples, btw.

I only made the "crisp" part of this dish maninly because I have my own sure fire recipe for cooked apples that avoid the watered down soupiness that can sometimes occur.  For that problem I would reccommend adding a tsp or two of flour or cornstarch to the apples and cinnamon.
As for the crisp, I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to it too and it came out great.

I used 1/2 c. of flour and 1/2 c. rolled oats, and 1/3 c. butter.  After baking, I turned the oven on broil for a few minutes to make the topping more crispy and it was SO good!  The only thing I didn't care for was the water poured over the apples, it did make it a tad watery, but still VERY yummy!

I made this last night.  I followed reviewers advice.  I baked it longer and used white and brown sugar.  It was ok for my teens but I  found the topping much to sweet for me.  Next time I'll use just white sugar and cut that by half.

Thank you for sharing this tasty treat with us! Was craving a sweet dessert & had three apples in the fridge so I ran an ingredient search with key words for items I did have on hand.  This recepe didn't call for oats, which I was out of & after I read the comments I decided to try it - good move as it was a HIT!  Kudos to everyone for the the comments, your individual suggestions gave me many options on how to tweak the recipe.   I adjusted the ingredients but only slightly: blended made a blend of sugar with both light brown & white sugar which I mixed with melted butter, drizzled pure maple syrup over the apples & cinnamon, slightly reduced the water, and sprinkled sea salt into the flour mix. The results were delicious, my fiancee & I each devoured a bowlful, enjoying every bite - he had a refill too!  The best thing about this recipe is that with a little creativity, we can easily compliment it with other yummy treats, I'd like to scoop either vanilla ice cream, whipped or heavy wipping cream at time of serving the next time I make it. Maybe I'll add gobs of prepped all-purpose flower mix to morph it into a cobbler…Raisins, oats, walnuts…The possiblities are endless =)

Very good.  Used orange juice instead of water.  1/2 cup combination brown and white sugar.  Added walnuts to top.  Added dried apricots and raisins with the apples.

Oh my gosh "Wedway", I felt so bad when I read your review! The line just sounded so cute...my husband and I agree that I'm a bad cook. I'm sure you're not, just follow a recipe from this site and you'll be fine:)!  Anyway, this was good, but I only used brown sugar and did add the graham cracker crumbs, which, by the way, was a wonderful suggestion! Thanks!

Turned out Great! I used all brown sugar instead, doubled the recipe, & set it for 400 F for 50 minutes in a 9x13 glass baking dish. Simple, yet wonderful.

The best apple crisp recipe I've found.  I was worried about not have an oatmeal crust, but this was soooo  much better.  I split the sugar and did 1/2C of white and 1/2C brown.  I also cooked it in individual dishes for a better presentation.  Took about 40 minutes in the oven.  Topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  DEVINE!  Got tons and tons of praise.  YUMMY!

This apple crisp turned out awesome, but I made some minor changes based on other reviews.  The pan I used was 8 x 11.5 because I wanted more apple crisp and I had enough apples.  I used McIntosh.  I layered the bottom with apples about 2 inches thick, so I'm not sure how many cups I used.  I sprinkled cinnamon, without measuring, all over the apples and sprinkled flour also.  I also added some vanilla.  I stuck to the 1/2 c. water because I made a larger serving than the original recipe, so I figured it was still the equivalent of having less.  Instead of 1 c. white sugar, I halved that amount and added 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Everything else, I kept the same.  This apple crisp was a hit with my husband and in-laws!  If I hadn't made any changes to the recipe, I would have rated this a 5 star.

My family LOVES this recipe. I make a few little changes though...I add about 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the apples, and instead of pouring the ingredients over the apples, I mix the water, apples, nutmeg and cinnamon together. Also, it is important not to blend the crisp mixture too long or it becomes too doughy and less crumbly.

I've made this recipe about 4 - 5 times over the last year or so, and each time it gets better and better.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and, although it was still delicious, found that a few adjustments needed to be made for my personal liking.  Here are my personal additions/changes: I preheat the oven to 350, but about halfway through baking I turn it up to 400 I use about (3) medium sized granny smith apples I use about 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 I add a teaspoon of vanilla extract I use one stick of margarine I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white I sprinkle cinammon all throughout the apples and also add it to the crust mixture I bake for 45-50 mins  Next time I make it, I'll add some of the crust to apple mixture and see how that goes.  Overall I think the core of this recipe is excellent. My husband loves it.

FANTASTIC!!!!  Took the advice from other reviewers and used half white and half brown sugar.  Also, decreased water and mixed apples with a little cinnamon and sugar before putting them in the baking dish.  Most certainly a KEEPER!!!

I'm only rating the topping because I prepare my apples the way I would if I were making an apple pie. I was looking for a crisp apple topping similar to the one my mom made when I was a child & I've searched high and low trying dozens of recipes. Not using oats makes this into a sweet treat that compliments the tart apples perfectly- It has that classic apple crisp taste! I also never thought to cream the butter and sugars (1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white) together FIRST and then add 1tsp cinnamon & flour. What a difference in the actual crumble. This will be my new go to recipe! Yum!

I made as is except as I had VERY fresh and juicy apples - I omitted all the water. The recipe taste overall was fantastic but I did find that I had to cook longer to get the top bron and crispy. Definitely a keeper as it was very easy and tasted like I put more effort than I did!

Just tried this recipe and my family enjoyed it so much. Like it without the oats. I did add one half brown sugar and one half white sugar instead of all white. Good with ice cream.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband and I agree that I am a bad cook, but this recipe was so easy and tasted great.  I read the other reviews and used apple pie filling instead of fresh apples (great when you're in a hurry) and sprinkled cinnamon graham cracker crumbs on top of the dough to give it more crunch.  Perfect with vanilla ice cream!

THANKSGIVING DESSERT 2011 - I had 1 Red Delicious apple and 2 bruised Fuji apples that needed to be used. Since I had extra time before putting the turkey in the oven, I decided to make this apple crisp recipe. I'm so glad I did. My daughters said, "Its the best apples EVER!" Of course, we did serve it with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream so that might have swayed their opinion.

So super yummy! I followed earlier reviews and sprinkled cinnamon ontop of apples, and into crumb mixture. I baked at 375 for 45 mins. I used gala apples and it came out perfect. I also cut the water to 1/4 cup.

WOW!  Like others I found this recipe after realizing that I didn't have any oats.  I always arrange the reviews by most helpful and then do whatever suggestions they list.    I had five green apples.  I knew that was more than 4 cups so I 1-1/2 times the topping which was too much.  I used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and added cinnamon to the top AND sprinkled it on the apples. I also added a bit of vanilla.    My daughter was having a sleepover so I made this for breakfast and it turned out so delicious.  I thought that I'd have left overs but I didn't.   This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

FANTASTIC!! I used 1/2 c each of brown & white sugar (as many others suggested) and a mix of apples I had sitting around the house. This turned into the most amazing apple crisp I've ever eaten!! My boyfriend had most of his piece devoured before I even had a chance to ask how he liked it. Definitely a keeper!!

I made this the other day and I too made some changes.  This turned out very nice.  I split the sugar into a 1/2c white and a 1/2c brown.  I also added a 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, allspice and cloves.  I will definately be making this again!!!  My husband and I LOVED it!

This was a wonderful oat-free recipe! My mum just gave me a ton of apples and so I knew I would be making a crisp eventually in order to get some variety in our blissful binging of these mystery apples (my mum just handed me a huge lable-less bag which i was only too happy to accept) I was a little skeptical at first about how crunchy the crust would be, but it turned out great!  I did tweek it a bit after reading some reviews. 1) I misread the recipe (ok I was rushing and didnt read the recipe at first) and I added sugar to my apples. I doubled the recipe for my large family. 2)I also substituted the water for 1C orange juice with about 1T pomegranite syrup whisked in. I also subbed ground cardamom(sp) for cinn. 3) i did like others mentioned and did halvsies with the brn and wte sugar. 4) I added cinn to the butter- sugr-flr mix. the tartness of the oj/pomm mix helped my apples and cut the sweetness nicely. I wonder how vanilla would have been, or adding another spice to the card? I didnt want to overdo it, so i played it safe. my typing is crazy, i apologize, but i wanted to review this asap(i made this for dessert tonight). and of course this was served with whole foods' awesome vanilla bean ice cream on top, YUM!!! the kids loved it, i loved, i would make this again.

I'm in love!! I've been searching for a good apple crisp recipe and I found it!  We have an apple tree in our yard so we have plenty of apples this time of the year.  Made no changes, no need to! Thanks Carrie for a fabulous recipe!

This is an excellent, simple recipe that I enjoyed making. I didn't have any oats on hand so I opted for an "oat-free" recipe. The end result was great! Like others before, I did a white/brown sugar mix. And, while sprinkling the topping, realised that I could easily 1.5x that bit! I love the crunchy topping! (It does get a bit sugary after cooling, so eating it warm is the way to go.) I would glady serve this to visitors for tea. Also, it's so easy for hungry children. 5 stars for simplicity and good taste.

This is a recipe that has been around for years.  People used to eat sweeter desserts than they do today so that is why many of us want to cut back on the sugar in this apple crisp.  I mix the sugar (half brown) and flour together then cut the butter in the dry ingredients with a pastry blender.  It is crumbly when it goes on the apples and makes a nice topping.

I made this for my family last night, and the unanimous opinion was that this is the best apple crisp we've ever had in our collective lives. Only thing I changed was go halves on white and brown sugar as one user suggested, sprinkle a little bit of oats on top (I like em, just not a ton), and dotted the crumble with little bits of butter on top before baking. I also used Golden Delicious apples. Served hot with vanilla bean icecream and it was heaven on earth. Thank you!!

Delicious! I loved that it had no oats. I even used a gluten free flour mix, no one would ever know it wasn't wheat. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a few drops of stevia to the apple mix. I'll decrease it even more next time because it was plenty sweet. I also used 100% fruit juice (cranberry-raspberry) instead of water and used granny smith and fuji apples mixed. I don't peel! Thanks for a great recipe, we ate the whole pan tonight after dinner while it was still warm. I'm going to make it the exact same way I did tonight for Thanksgiving, and I will definitely make it again and would love to dry different fruits... Apple-berry, peach, strawberry rhubarb... Yum.  I might even double the crumb. Not that it needs it really, but it is delicious.

This recipe was delicious.  Easy, quick and involves just a few common ingredients.  I kept the temperature as recommended but baked it between 50-60 minutes.  I just watched it carefully to ensure it didn't burn.

I agree with people who said it's good if you have just a few ingredients. I used 3 Granny Smith apples, which was 4 cups the way I sliced them, and this still was too flat. The water was way too much--this was too soupy, though I baked it as long as I could before the top would burn. The taste was good, but not the presentation. I'm glad I tried this. I made this for company and was actually embarrassed. I should have made it for myself first to see what it was like. Oh, well. Thanks anyway for the recipe.

Very simple to make. I doubled it and made it in a 9 x 13 pan instead. I totally messed up the topping though. I just mixed everything up together at one time.

Yum!! I used 4 apples, rather than 4 cups of sliced apples and there was plenty for my husband and I. I also doubled the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and added some fresh cracked black pepper to bring out the flavors. The leftovers are in the refrigerator and I already can't wait to have them for breakfast in the morning.

SOOOOO GOOD! I doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 pan, 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, cinnamon on the apples and in the crumble, added a splash of vanilla to the crumble, used half the water called for and it is the most amazing thing ever!

Give it a 5* because it's so easy, and tastes wonderful.  Took care of my sweet tooth and craving for comfort food all at once!  Made just as the recipe reads for my family.  They loved it! I'm sensitive to gluten and watching my calories, so I used Pamela's Baking Mix & rice flour 50/50 instead of regular flour.  Used Stevia to sweeten.  It was great too and without the guilt : )

I've basically made this same recipe several times from directions a neighbor gave me which are more simple plus the topping stays crisp longer. Place apples & water in pan. Pour or pat butter over top. Mix dry ingredients & sprinkle on. DELICIOUS & EASIER!

I have started making this recipe with a fever ever since I found it and perfected my version of it. Quite literally almost every day I'm making another batch, because my boyfriend, myself, and all my family and friends are always requesting it. I varied a little from the recipe. How I make it is, I use an 8x8 pan and I normally use about 3-5 apples, depending on how large they are. Granny smith taste the best with this, but i normally use regular red del. I peel and core them, and I pour 1/3 C. water over them in the pan. after that, I sprinkle cinnimon over them until they are coated, and i add a light sprinkling of nutmeg, just enough for taste. then I mix the topping together. I use- 1/2 C. butter, 1/2 C. white sugar, 1/2 C. brown sugar, and mix that. Then I add cinnimon liberally to that, until it's covered, and about 3 Tb. of vanilla. I mix that in. Then I add 3/4 C. of flour. I spread the topping over the apples, usually by hand to make sure it's even, and then I sprinkle brown sugar liberally over the top for a nice crunchy crust. I bake it at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. it always comes out perfectly.

This was SOoooooooo good.  I read the reviews, took some advice and think this is about as easy as you can make it:  I didn't even peel the (Granny) apples.  I used a corer/slicer which cuts them into 10 slices.  I added no water.  I used 1 cup of Golden (light) brown sugar and mixed the cinnamon right in with the rest of the topping.  I had to use a glass pie plate as my 8x8 was at my daughter's.  Baked 45 minutes.  This was sooooo great and not too sweet.  In fact, it made the eggnog ice cream I put with it seem very sweet (and we don't like very sweet).  This is the very simplest dessert ever, especially with the shortcuts I made.  Came out perfectly and an absolute keeper.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

me and baking just don't mix, yet I have to say, this came out pretty darn good (smile)..I took the advise of others and used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar. I also did not add the water, if I did, I would have wound up with apple soup!!

I was looking for a recipe exactly like this because I had way too many apples, yet didn't have any oats in the house so this was perfect. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it was a nice treat! Next time though, I think I will take the cinnamon and maybe just a little bit of the sugar and toss it in the apples to coat them before putting them in the pan.

Yummy! This recipe is sooo good. I made it two days in a row!! However both of my batches came out a little mushy, which I think is due to over cooking. Also, I scooped the crisp into little individual no-bake graham shells for small apple pies. I will definately make this again!

I would leave out the water next time as there was alot of liquid on the bottem of the pan. Also I think 400 would be a better temp. because I had to cook this quite a bit longer.

Very good... the only thing I changed was I added 1/2 the water the apples I had were pretty juicy and sprinkled some cinnamon on top.  I doubled this recipe and put in 9x13 pan... It is half gone already so I'm glad I doubled it.  I will definitely make this again... my family loved it... I served it warm and it was very good and I'm sure it will be just as good tomorrow if not better, if there is any left.

What an easy easy recipe. I was too lazy to roll out an apple pie crust from scratch so decided to search for an easy apple dessert. No regrets! I followed the recipe and added a dash of nutmeg to my apples. Used 5 gala and 1 granny smith. Also a dash of vanilla to the crust. It was a winner. I made it the night before and quickly warmed it in the oven for about 15 min just before serving with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream to a company of ten. The crust was crisp and apples so soft. YUM. Changes? I would cut the water to 1/4 cup or less cos I drained out some water right after baking as it was bubbling over. It thickened nicely overnight though. Got rave reviews for this. Must try.

I prefer an apple crisp topping without oats and a little less sweet, so I cut the amount of sugar to 1/3 white sugar, 1/3 brown and added finely chopped pecans for an extra layer of flavor.  I also mixed in a small amount of lemon juice with the 1/2 c water.  Perfect and easy to make!

this recipe was well worth 5 stars. We use so many apples in our baked goods and  this was truly simpe and delicious.  After all the recipes using brown sugar it was delightful to taste the   light crisp topping and  still taste the pure  apple filling below. the texture was perfect.   Didn't change a thing.

This was pretty easy, it was my first attempt at making an apple crisp since my hubby doesn't like apple pie. I used 1/2 brown sugar and just a couple tbs of white sugar; I used gala apples, which I thought was too sour after eating the crisp. Next time I'll try a sweeter apple, that's just my preference. The crust was crunchy and very good. I actually forgot to add the water, and it still turned out ok. Will try again with a different kind of apple.

Simple yet delicious! It was a great way to get use my bruised apples that were still good. It did take longer than 40 minutes at 350. I only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and it was sweet enough for us.

This recipe needs some adjustments to get a better rating.    1. Reduce the amount of water.  (the current amount causes the bottom half of the "crsip" to have too much of a gooey consistency.) 2.  Add salt to the flour before mixing it into the butter. (this helps balance the sweetness)   3. Use about 1 cup of flour...the current amount is not really enough and it is too "doughy"  4. Optional: add vanilla to the apple / cinnamon mixture.

I was having a craving for something sweet, so I thought I would give this a try. I was not disappointed! This is a very decent recipe.  The only slight changes that I made was that I halved the amount of water, like some reviewers suggested. I used margarine instead of butter. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and ginger to the apples. It complimented the cinnamon nicely. I used a mix of 2 different apples, Granny Smith and a sweeter variety (unsure of the name right now).  I did have to bake it for an additional 10 minutes, even using a silicon baking pan. It wasn't such a big problem though and it turned out nice and crispy! I will definitely make this again.

All I have to say is that my hubby totally hates fruit with any kind of sugar or sweeteners and this is one I thought would just be for my 3 girls and me...but as there are more estrogen hormones under this roof, we "dared" him to take a bit..."OMG THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!!" and he ate majority of it. So hands down, this was FAN-SUPERLY-TASIC!!!!

Simple and delicious! I used 1/2 white sugar and half brown sugar and I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top of the flour mixture before baking. It makes the crust look sparkly and adds to the taste. My whole house smelled of apples and cinnamon whilst it was baking. helpful hint: If your flour mixture is too sticky to sprinkle over the apples, it's because there's probably too much butter. Gradually add some extra flour to the mix until you can actually crumble the mix in your hands without it sticking like peanut butter.

This was very good.  Was looking for a crispy crisp that didn't include oats, this one was perfect, not too sweet or too tart.  My ONLY complaint, which really was my fault, was that I stirred the topping too long, so it went from perfectly crumbly to a paste that was difficult to get on top of the apples.  It tasted fantastic regardless, but now I know not to stir too much!  :-)

This apple crisp was so delicious, and easy!  I did substitute half a cup of the white sugar for brown sugar as someone previously suggested and it was very tasty.  I used jonagold apples which were a little tart and tasted wonderful in this dish.  It was perfect and I plan to whip it up whenever I feel like because it was just so easy.

Bumpy, crispy, and gooey...all at the same time!  Soooo much easier than apple pie but still has that delicious 'mouth feel'.  I would agree with some reviewers that the type of apple used dictates how much sugar and water you will need.  I followed the recipe exactly using Golden Delicious apples and I would deem it very delicious but,a little sweet and a little juicy.  So, next time, if using a sweet,juicy apple, I will make the changes accordingly. I love the fact that it requires no oats.

FANTASTIC recipe! I used Golden Delicious apples because they were what I had in my fridge, and did a few things differently. I mixed the 1 tsp cinammon with 2 tbsp sugar. I tossed the apples in this mixture before putting them into the 8x8, then drizzled with about 1/4 cup water. If I made this again I would probably leave out the water altogether, as it was fairly moist (but Golden Delicious tend to give off more juice than Granny Smith). I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white, and whisked it together with the flour. I then added the butter (cold and cubed) and cut it into the mixture with a pastry cutter until it formed typical pea-sized bits, that way the topping was more "crumbly." I baked at 375 for about 50 minutes before the topping was as crispy as I liked. This was so buttery, crispy and fast to put together. Would be delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! It is a tastier, easier version of apple pie! Can't wait to make it again!

I've used this recipe a few times. I add 1 tspn of vanilla to the topping and 1 tspn-1 tblspn of OJ to the apples. It's very tasty when you use half brown sugar and half white. One time I even forgot to add half of the sugar (I accidentally kept adding flour to get the right consistency) and it actually came out great!

GREAT recipe! I used 1/4 c. sugar & 1/4 c. butter, kept the flour the same - this was plenty sweet for me & made a delicious crispy crumble for the top. Very easy to make too, I highly recommend it.

Oh my! This recipe is so easy and so delicious. I have tried it with green apples and with red apples. Both were great. I liked the one with green and my husband preferred the one with red, I will make it with half and half next time. It does not get easier or better then this recipe! Thank you so much!

I doubled this and baked it in a 13"x9" glass dish for 50 min. In the doubled recipe I cut the water to 3/4 cu, and added about 1/2 teaspoon of Mexican vanilla. I also put in about 1/2 teaspoon. salt... YUMOOOO!! 

I do think it would have been even BETTER with some tart cooking apples as it was suggested (Granny Smiths).  I just used a variety of apples I had on hand...and the flavor is TRUE old fashioned applec crisp.  

Very nice!  I served it with whipped cream with just a HINT of cinnamon on top.

I made this recipe with a variety of apples we picked last weekend, and it was to die for! I chose it because I didn't want to use oats, and it came out sooo good. The apples were soft and sweet and the topping was crispy and delicious.  I didnt' make any changes, I used all the water and it came out great.  Definitely a keeper!

My husband doesn't enjoy oats in his crisps, and so luckily I could turn to allrecipes, as usual, for some help.  We both really enjoyed this recipe, although, when I make it again I will change a few things.  As is, the recipe is worth 4 stars.  I used macoun apples, which were perfect, but I used all white sugar, as listed in the recipe, and wish I had gone with previous reviewers suggestions and used half white and half brown sugar, just for that golden look if not for flavor.  Also, I think I'll used apple cider or apple juice in place of the water next time.  I will come back and revise this review when I make it again, and being apple season here in New England, that should be rather soon!

I read the other reviews and I am glad I did. Instead of apple, used fresh peaches.
Also for more flavor, sprinkle some nutmeg and brown sugar over the top and it is great!
For crispier, instead of brown sugar, white sprinkle on top..

this was really nice.  thanks to the other reviewers, I added cinnamon to the topping, used half white and half brown sugar and just mixed in the butter like making a pie crust.  used 2T lemon juice and almost 1/2c OJ instead of water...oh, also, I used Granny Smith apples, very important for baking! I baked it at 400F for 40 mins.  came out soooo good!

We got apples this AM and I just made this w/ cortlands. I did the same as  many others, 1/4 water, used brown and white sugar. Sooo good, I don't think the pan will last through the day.

Very easy and good. I also decreased the amount of water, and used the same mix of brown sugar and white sugar as others suggested. I did decrease the flour and added oats instead with the same amount of butter. I also baked it at 400 for the whole time. And I also did not peel the apples.It turned out great

This is so simple. BUT  Its all about the apples.  Cooking apples.  No red or golden delicious, no galas or fujis. Granny Smith, Rome, Jonathans or "recommended for pie apples". I use this recipe for peaches as well. Its a great 'first' for kids who want to cook!

Even though my crumble didn't crumble (it was very mushy, kind of sank into the apple part) this was still a good tasting recipe.  I might try it again with more flour and a little less butter.

Perfect!!! With a few tweaks though: 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar, less water and less butter. Also, I broiled it for a minute or two at the end. Really such a great fall dessert!

This was great.  Just like my apple pie recipe without the crust.  Like others I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also used 1/4 cup water.

First off, I am a cook not a baker. I do not have the patience for baking. Second, I do not like pies or cobblers. My hubby is the sweet eater. I made this for him. This recipe was so easy. It is way yummy:) These are the changes I made after reading the reviews-1 tablespoon of water, 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar. I used Fujii apples. Yummy!

Great recipe. Very easy to make.  I substituted the water for orange juice because of an old recipe I used to use.  It gave it a little bit more kick.

Good.  Very sweet and decadent.  I omitted the water, used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white sugar, and used ginger snap crumbs instead of flour for the topping. I also used Apple Pie Seasoning from this website instead of just cinnamon, and loads of it.

I baked this dish in a 9 inch pie plate, which I had coated heavily with butter and the result was great.  I increased the cooking time just a tad, so that it was evenly brown on top.  The flavor of this dessert is so good!  It's messy when served, so in that way, it's like a cobbler.  Don't expect it to be neatly sliced.  Just dallop it out and go for it!  A great way to use extra apples.

I needed to find an apple crisp that didn't have oatmeal in the topping because my H won't eat it. The recipe as published doesn't get highest marks but with some adjustments it is good. I use brown sugar instead of white in the topping and add a pinch of salt. Also, the apples don't really need any water, you'll only have a soupy crisp.

This was awesome.  I found the recipe and we were eating it with some vanilla ice cream right out of the oven in about 50 minutes from the time I started thinking of making it.  I used half brown sugar and half white, granny smith apples, only about 4 needed.  I love a crisp w/out oats so if you don't like oats...this one is for you!  FABULOUS!

people have been saying that this comes out watery. A simple solution---don't use water! crisp is a very easy dessert to play around with and in my past experience with it is that the base can be a simple mix of apples and cinnamon. Beleive me, I am positive that omitting the water completely will still give you a great dessert.

This was so tasty. It was such a nice change from the typical oatmeal topping. I used four different types of apples: macs, russets, spies and royal gala. Next time I'm going to add some pears too.

I was in a hurry to make an apple crisp, I jumped on the computer and found this recipe.  It was awesome!!!  I had all the ingridents on hand and the prep time was quick!!  The baking did take a little longer than 30 minutes, more like 40 to 45.  My whole family loved it!!!!!  Will use it again and again!!!  Thank you!

I made this to use up some apples I had in the fridge.  I wasn't expecting it to turn out as good as it did.  My boyfriend absolutely loved it!  The second time I made it, I diced the apples and used small indiviual sized pie pans.  I reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes.  And using the little foil pie pans made clean up a breeze.  This is by far the best dessert recipe I've ever used.

Everybody couldn't wait to try the dish that created such a wonderful smell in the house! Just make sure not to use too much water or it will be slightly goopy instead of the slight crisp. I barely let the water cover the top of the apples and it turned out excellent.  I also added a little extra flour to give the dough more of a crumbly texture.  Serves great slightly warm with or without a little vanilla ice cream on top. Will definitely make this again!

Crust turned out really good. I increased the crust ingredients by 1/2 since I like alot of it and added a handful of uncooked oats to it. Also cooked for about 50 minutes.

This is not what I was looking for. I wanted a crisp with a crumbly top- this had way too much butter in it. The topping should look like large & small crumbs where you can sprinkle them on top. This was like a dough- I had to pinch off pieces of it to put on top. When I put ice cream on it, you could just see the melted butter in the dish- heart attack city!!! I wanted a recipe without oats also. Anyone?

I tried this recipe for the first time a few weeks ago, after having just moved into my new house!  I had my parents and my in-laws over and decided we needed a desert for after dinner.  While we ate the main coarse the apple crisp was in the oven.  The smell was heavenly.  
We had the apple crisp on its own (no ice cream).  It was so delicious I was asked to make it again today!  YUM!

This was a great recipe, I used 2 types of apples, granny smith and gala.  The galas were kind of mushy but my husband and everybody at the party I took it too loved it.  I doubled the recipe and had more topping and put it in a 9X13 pan.  For the cinnamon I put 1/4 of it in the topping mix.I also used half brown sugar and half regular sugar.  My husband asked when I would make it again, it was easy and tasty.  Thanks

I always thought you had to have oats to make a good apple crisp...I was very wrong!  This is absolutely the BEST apple crisp I have ever tasted.  It came out light, crumbly, and sweet.  This one is going to become a family favorite.  Thanks Carrie!!

This is a wonderful apple crisp recipe. The "crisp" part of it is very good---some fruit crisp recipes don't have much of a topping--but this one is very good.

This was very easy and the taste was decent.  However, it didn't look too good at the end.  Maybe I messed up while making the topping...Anyway, it's okay if you're in a rush or just lazy.  Next time, I think I'll try a recipe with oats on the top.

I am fairly new to the wonderful world of cooking, and this recipe was AWESOME! 
I had left over apples and figured I'd try something new. I've had Apple Crisp at the 99 restaurant and always liked it so I picked Apple Crisp III. This was just as good if not better than what they serve there. Probably better actually because I can take pride in the fact that I made it. =) 
Took probably 50 minutes to cook, but worth it. 
I liked it so much, that I'm making Apple Crisp for Thanksgiving instead of Pie.

This was definitely very easy and very tasty.  However, I would suggest including the recipe to state "peeled and sliced" apples...I suppose I should have thought of that myself, but I found that's why it was so easy...no peeling!

Anyway, very good, would suggest varieties of maybe using brown sugar as well as white.

This recipe was fairly quick and easy to throw together and tastes GREAT!!  It just took longer than stated to cook and the top never really browned.  I'm thinking next time I'll reduce the amount of water - that was probably the cause.  Really yummy!

I was so totally impressed with this recipe.  
With my family i NEED something REALLY quick but good. This was both.  It was 
exactly what i was looking for.  I substituted half the white for brown sugar and it was
perfect! It didn't take even 10 minutes to prepare and we did the dishes while waiting for
it to cook. Now i divide it into 2 tin pie plates for taking to holiday events as well. GREAT. 
Thanks a million.

super easy to make. I used 3 big Cortland apples. Only used 2/3 cups of sugar on the crest. 400F in the oven for 25 minutes and 350F for 15 mins. It turned out to be fantastic. The plate was cleared before I got a chance to take a picture. Next time I will only use 1/2 cup of sugar at most.

I made this as suggested by some others with 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I only put half of the water the recipe called for,  but feel that I could have used even less than that, or maybe none at all as suggested by a few people here.  My daughter is dairy-free, so I made it with her vegan butter and it still turned out great.  Very delicious!  I just used whatever apples I had in the fridge.  I don't remember what they were, but they worked out fine.

This was so yummy and easy! To make this even easier I used Apple pie filling. Added some vanilla extract and cinnamon to the crumb mixture. It also needed more time about an hour. Make sure to get some Vanilla Ice cream!!

I made some changes to the original recipe following the advice in the comments. I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the apples and cinnamon and mixed it up before adding the water. I also changed the Temp to 400 and baked for 40mins. Turned out perfect!

While the recipe itself was easy enough, the topping was too sweet, I would definitly cut back on the white sugar. Also the topping didn't crumble as much as make a harden shell.  The cook time took much longer than 40 minutes closer to 55 minutes, guestimate since I kept adding 5 mintues from 30 minutes - afraid it would burn.  I doubt I will use this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at making an apple crisp and it was very good. Did as others suggested and used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Cut down water to 1/4 cup and it came out perfect. Baked at 375 for 50 min. I will make this again, hubby devoured half of it in one sitting.

This recipe was simple and so yummy! I made it for 3 people so I used 2 apples and about 1/4 cup of flour.  I think the secret to tastier crisp is NOT to handle the butter/sugar/flour mixture too much while combining them.  Just gently mix them together and sprinkle on top.  I baked it in a toaster oven at 400 degrees for 35 minutes and it was perfect.  We didn't have vanilla ice cream on hand but it tasted just fine without it.  I'll definitely be making it again for Thanksgiving!

Very good. I, too, added vanilla. I didn't have any brown sugar on hand so I did not add it. I would have liked it to be crispier, but maybe the brown sugar will help a bit with that. I baked it for WAY longer than the time stated. Some people said to up it to 50 minutes...I went much longer...maybe 1 hour, 20 minutes...until it was gooey and bubbling. Delicious & I will definitely make it again!

I made this exactly as written and the flavor was great, i liked the crust but it took so much longer to cook. I did 50 minutes at 350 then upped the temp to 400 for another 20 minutes,then it came out crispbut not too crisp. The apples broke down quite a bit at such a long cooking time so there wasnt as much filling as i would have liked.

LOVE this recipe!  I tried it because I don't really like the apple crisp recipes that use oats.  This one is absolutely delicious and very simple.  I use more than 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, but not sure how much - i just sprinkle a lot on top of the apples.  The crust is delicious.  It really makes a creamy, sweet apple crisp.  I definitely recommend trying this recipe - you won't regret it!

The flavor in this recipe is just too simple.  It tastes like apples covered in butter and sugar.  It needs more depth of flavor.  I don't know exactly what would make it better, but I won't bother making this again.

This is by far one of the best things I've ever tasted. It's super easy and idiot proof (I should know).   We used to get this dessert at California Pizza kitchen, but this recipe makes going there unneccessary. Ice cream on top and it's like heaven.

We didn't realize until after it came out of the oven that it didn't have oats in it.  Hubby made it and added too much water, but a day later, it tasted soooooo yummy!  Going to buy more apples and make another, can't wait!  Great job, Carrie!!!!

Perfect consistency,,,crisp broken topping over a juicy, but not watery sauce and apples.  Flavor with 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar is absolutely delicious,  And easy to make!  I used a food processor to mix the topping.

This is a perfect basic recipe.  I first tried it because I had apples I needed to use but no brown sugar or oats.  The second time I made it, I had brown sugar and used it.  It was good with it, but fine without it.  The best thing I think about the recipe is the blending of the sugar and butter.  Many recipes call for combining the dry ingredients and then adding the butter.  Creaming the butter and sugar first is so much easier.  Thanks for sharing!  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe couldn't be simpler.....or more delicious!  I have also used plums in addition to the apples, you can eliminate the water, as they will provide some liquid.

Ohhhh this was SO good!! I wish I could give it 50 stars! It was so incredibly easy and SO delicious! The only thing I think I did wrong was I think I blended the topping a little too much and it went from being crumbly to being gooey.  So I had to spread the topping over the apples, which was a little difficult, instead of sprinkling it.  But it still tasted amazing! I used granny smith apples which made it very tart, and I used the advice of other reviewers and did half brown/half white sugar. I also left it in the oven for an additional 10 minutes like other reviewers. I had it warm w/ vanilla ice cream and coffee while I watched a movie and I was in heaven! I predict I will make this again over and over! Thank you so much!!

Reeeally good!  My fiance and I were craving something sweet and I whipped this up.  So quick and easy.  I had all the ingredients, ended up using 2 large golden delicious apples.  Thirty minutes would have been good enough for baking but I found that my topping was not browning.  I put it under the broiler for a few minutes and it got a beautiful golden color quickly.  Definitely will be making this again, especially during the fall!

I have made this a few times now (twice in the last week) and it is so delicious and extremely simple.  I used three different apples, granny smith, northern spy, and jonathan.  You coud really use any kind and you won't go wrong.  The crumb topping is to die for...the exact same as my mom's apple pie topping.

WOW.  I have to make a second one for the family and hide the first.  I tasted it and now it's half gone.   I'm going to use half brown sugar and add some chopped walnuts to the topping for variation.

I am pretty good with making apple crisp and I don't like it with oatmeal-so I was eager to try this recipe (which I tried a few times and tried to edit a little more) and there is nothing I could do to save it. The topping doesn't hold and melts over the apple making a hard sticky glaze. I was very disappointed.

Wow this was so delish! I used the half white/half brown sugar that many were suggesting, baked for about 45 mins. Soooo good!! Nice crisp, chewy and buttery top. If I was making it for company I would probably double the size. Will definitely be making this one again, thanks for the great recipe!!

Excellent!  I even used low fat butter to save some calories and it was still delicious!  I added a little vanilla to the batter and a pinch of salt and nutmeg. I also used a little less sugar than called for.  Soooo good served warm with whipped topping!

This turned out poorly. The topping was a soft, pasty, mushy mess; even after I baked it an extra 20 minutes, it never got even a little brown or crispy. The topping also doesn't taste good...maybe needs a little pinch of salt or some cinnamon? I used a can of applie pie filling and some plain cherries as the fruit bottom, so that was not contributing to the gloppiness.  I will not make this again.

This doesn't need yet another great review, but I feel I must add my 5 star review to the mix.  I prepared this recipe as written using 6, beyond their prime, red delicious apples.  Like others stated, it need to bake about 25 minutes longer, otherwise, the dish was superb!! It can be topped with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream but honestly, it needs nothing more.  Oh, it's delicious warm or cold.

This was a phenomenal recipe. I added 1/2 c. of ground almonds to the topping and decreased the flour by about 1/4 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract (NOT the imitation stuff).  The added almond really gave a lovely flavour and made the crisp deluxe.

I followed the recipe as written, with McIntosh apples, and the taste was outstanding. I was expecting the topping to be more crumbly, but it was more like a soft dough. (Never mind, it still worked.)  It did take about 50 minutes to get browned. Quick and easy, and we had all of the ingredients on hand.

OMG, this was so delicious and easy. I squeezed some lemon juice onto the granny smith apples I was using.I used home-made salted butter in the recipe, it really does make a difference using fresh ingredients. I baked it for 50 minutes at 350 and it came out perfect. Try topping it with some home-made vanilla whipped cream. So good.

This was great! I didn't change anything and it turned out wonderful. We had to leave it in for more then 40 minutes to get the top to brown to our liking, but a little time change is no big deal. I'm really excited to make this again.

Good flavor. However, I used margarine instead of butter and it was not crispy at all. Still tasted great, but not an apple crisp. Would make it with real butter next time.

More than doubled this. Used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Also used 3 different kinds of apples.  Baked at 400 degrees about 50 min.  So very good!

I made this for my parents tonight and after I made it I asked my mom how she makes her apple crisp. It turned out that it was exactly the same recipe she uses. Great minds think alike! I did sprinkle a little nutmeg on the apples when I put on the cinnamon just because I love nutmeg.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and made this using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar instead of a full cup of white sugar. I also sprinkled some extra cinnamon in the crumb topping mixture and then again on the top before baking. Great apple crisp!

Ive been craving apple crisp for a while now, but never knew how to make....Just seemed to complicated with the oates and crust and whatever else you had to do!!!!  Well, this recipe should be in the cooking for dummies book, cause it's fool proof and makes a GREAT dish everytime.  My family loves it and it never makes it to the next day.  Always gone the same night I make it. :)  Thx for the recipe

I've never made apple crisp before, but I split the sugar to half and brown half white, as well as added about 1/2 cup of oats and my mom said it was the best she's ever had! Thanks, I'll make this again and again.

Topping was delicious - don't use OJ instead of water.  I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.

This was FANTASTIC! I did change it just a bit. I added 3 plums and used apple juice instead of water. Such a good, quick and easy treat. I will make this often.

Oct. 27 2008
I made this recipe lastnight, and it is Yummy for my tummy!! 
 I used 2 med. Granny Smith and 1 Braeburn apple[these apples are a tart apple, which really gives it a good apple taste,not a sweet taste},I did use 1/2 C. white sugar and 1/2 C. brown sugar,instead of 1 C.all white sugar.I only added 1/4 C. water instead of the 1/2 Cup that it called for.Also sprinkled more ground cinnamom and ground nutmeg on the top before I put in the oven.I baked it for 40 mins. and did what one suggested and placed it under the broiler for about 1 min.to get the top brown,but it seemed to make the top crust a little hard,so I put the cover on the baking pan while it was still warm and it seemed to softened up.
I think the apples that I used is what gave this recipe a good flavor.
I will make this again..I think this spring I will make it with Rhubarb instead of apples...yum yum!
Thanks for sharing a darn good recipe.

really easy and turns out a crowd-pleaser. I used 50/50 white/brown sugar, and 50/50 white/wheat flour. I will try cutting down the sugar next time because it is really really sweet, but therefore a crowd-pleaser...

This recipe is very good. I doubled the recipe since we had so many apples leftover and used a 9x13 pan. I followed the reviews about using both brown and white sugars and used a teaspoon of nutmeg. I also had to let it bake for 65 minutes but the topping did not brown so I moved the pan up to the broiler for a minute and it did the trick. one side of the dish looked watery so I was afraid that I used too much water since the bubbling increased and leaked out to the oven floor just a little bit but when we let it cool off until after dinner, the apples reabsorbed the liquid and whatever was left was more of a syrup. The topping was crunchy and great with vanilla ice cream. I will definately make it again. my mom said she feels like eating the whole thing of the big piece I brought home for her!

Loved the flavor of the apples...the top didn't turn out to be a crispy one though....maybe I did something wrong.   We'll see when I make it next time.

i should have left my apple slices bigger because they cooked down pretty much.  it was very good and we used apples from our tree that are from an old variety late 1800's antique apple.

I have been searching for a great apple crisp w/out oatmeal for a long time. I used gravenstein apples from my yard, substituted OJ for the water, and used 1/2 brown and half white sugar per other recommendations. PERFECT!

I perfer my crisp with oatmeal but my family overruled me so I made this one. And of course it was excellent.  I used 1/2 brown sugar which I tossed into my apples before putting in the backing dish.  I also used about 3 TBS REAL lemon juice as I was using several sweet apples.  I love the taste to tart/sweet -and it was just that.  Do not get alarmed that the crust is not crisp when you take it out of the oven, it gets nice and crispy when it cools.  I too had to cook it just a bit longer as well - this is due to the type of apples you are using so adjust accordingly.

I gave this 5 stars because it has it all-great taste-goodness and very easy!  I use apples out of our backyard so I cut the water and didn't use it - I also did the other stuff that was recommended-1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar-added vanilla.  Yummy!

Just sprinkle the mixture of butter and sugar on top of the apples, don't stir it in, or it'll turn out mushy instead of crispy. :)

This recipe calls for water but in my case water was the last thing needed!  I had to pour out what seemed like 1 cup of water half way thru cooking.  I did use half white and half brown sugar and topping was sweet & crispy.  Not the best but alright for only a few ingreds.

This was a decent starting point, since I wanted a topping without crust.  But OH, MY was it sweet!  Next time, I'll use 12 cups of apples and I still might reduce the sugar a little!

Finally an apple crisp recipe with no oatmeal! I cut the water to 1/4 cup and added a squirt of lemon juice to it. I used 6 Gala apples...perfect. As per other suggestions, I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I baked this for a little over and hour, it took that long for the topping to "crisp". It was just right, and no dry oatmeal taste! This is my new recipe for Apple Crisp. Thanks, Carrie. PS: I forgot the cinnamon but didn't even miss it.

This recipe was soooo GOOD!  I did change a few things.  I sprinkled the apples with a little cinnamon & white sugar and tossed it around.  I then added 1 T of orange juice and 4 T of water and then added & crumbled the rest of the ingredients that the recipe called for over the apples (1 T. cinnamon, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. light brown sugar, 1 stick of butter, and my 3/4 c. of flour).  I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out great.  There was just a little juice at the bottom to keep it from burning and the top of it was to die for!!!!!!  It was a BIG hit with the family.  I will be making this dessert again.

Thank you so much!

I ALSO USED 1/2 CUP WHITE SUGAR AND 1/2 CUP BROWN SUGAR. I ALSO ADDED ONE OUNCE OF RAISENS AND USED ONE TABLESPOON OF CINNAMON AND 1/3 CUP OF WATER. I ADDED A SPRINKLE OF NUTMEG TO THE APPLES AND OVER THE TOPPING. IT WAS DELICIOUS THIS WAY!

The best part of this recipe was the topping. PERFECT. Crunchy and Golden. I followed the recipe as directed to the tee, but the apples came out to mushy for my taste. My apples were even sliced into big slices. Next time, as suggested by the PIE TROUBLESHOOTING AT ALLRECIPES, I will only use half the amount of water, because their is plenty of juice in the apples. I give this a 3 star as written, but has the potential, to be a 5 star, because the crust on top is so good and crunchy.

what an amazing taste!  I prepared this for dessert last night...there were no leftovers and many requests to "make it again" tonight!  The only thing I did different is use less sugar; but that was a matter of taste.  This is quick, easy, and delicious.  Thanks Carrie!!!

Quick, easy, delicious!  It's a keeper.  The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar and cooking time.  I used only 1/2 cup sugar and baked it for 50 minutes so the top would brown.  It came out perfect! Thanks for sharing this wonderful and easy dessert. Apples used were Red Delicious.

This was so easy and so good. Even my picky eater ate a serving. The only thing I would change, would be using "I can't believe It's Not butter" spray, in place of the butter, and Splenda, in place of the sugar, to bring down the WW points! Will try this next time!!!!!

This is easy enough with a very buttery flavor. I found it too watery even after baking for 45 minutes. Perhaps my apples were too juicy?

I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. We had planned to have this over vanilla ice cream but someone left the freezer open. So i will be making this again. It was just to easy! And it was delicious!

EXCELLENT recipe! I made it for our Family Night treat & it was a hit. Just as others have stated, though, it did take quite a bit longer to get brown & crispy than the recipe stated. I was a little short on the apples so I added some raisins to get the fruit measurement called for...tasty addition!

I cooked it much longer than directed to.  About 15 mins. longer.  Don't know if it was my oven, my pan???  The apples got dried out as a result.  It was good but i added cinnamon on top after it was done.
It doesn't say to melt butter and I did and i think that was a mistake.  It probably should have been room temperature.
Ok overall.

The reviews were right! This is a great dessert. I have made this with oats, but I like this much better. I had to cook it longer than called for, so next time I will allow for the extra time. Thanks, Carrie, for a winner!

This dessert is tasty and easy to make; however, if I had to change anything, I might add cinnamon to the topping in addition to OR in lieu of the cinnamon that's already on the apples.

Loved it!!  First time I have tried other than my mom's recipe!  I did use half brown sugar, half white sugar, and added an extra tsp. of cinnamon to topping.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed also.  Will use this recipe from now on!  Love the crunchy topping and very tender apples!

I made this twice and didnt care for it...sorry but it is too much butter or not enough flour.  It didnt look like a crisp or taste like one.  I would probably add more flour if i make it again.

Super easy. I used five small Fuji apples that were about to expire, split the sugar into 1/2 white and 1/2 brown and added a dash of vanilla to the apples. Mine landed at its finish closer to 45 minutes. SO GOOD. SO EASY. For real, I threw this together while my kiddo was having bathtime.

Really quick and easy to make! Great if you're craving a warm sweet apple dessert but don't want to take more than an hour to make :)
I added a sprinkle of sea salt and a tsp of vanilla and also lightly drizzled maple syrup over the apples as a pre-coating. Came out delicious! (Reduced some of the sugar since I was using all brown sugar)

Delicious! Four stars only b/c is refused to brown until I turned the oven up to 400. Could have just been my oven though. Tasted amazing! Granny smith apples are a must in baking.

This is the best apple crisp I've ever made which doesn't have oatmeal in it. I've made it several times now, and I prefer to use only 1/2 cup white sugar plus 1/2 cup brown sugar, and I lightly sprinkle my apple slices with lemon juice before topping them with cinnamon and the crumble. Amazing with or without the modifications!!!

I know I've made something great when my MOM asks for the recipe!  She's taught me everything I know about cooking and was an amazing cook for all 7 of us kids.  Only thing I switched up (super minor) I poured the water over the apples and then sprinkled the cinnamon on top. That was it!  Try this...you'll be a super star;)

SUPER FAST, EASY, and DELICIOUS! I cut the recipe in help and made some alterations. I used two granny smith and one gala (they were a bit small is why I used 3 apples). I seasoned the slices with pumpkin spice instead of just cinnamon, and sprinkled with a couple teaspoon of water. The crumble is what I changed the most: 1 cup of oats, 1/2 cup of coconut sugar, half a stick (1/4 cup) of butter, and two teaspoons of wheat flour. I mashed the dry ingredients with the butter and sprinkled over apples. Baked as directed in a pie tin. I was the easiest, quickest, and most delicious apple crisp I've tasted in a long time. Making again to night.

Tweeked the recipe just a bit, used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white and used pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon to give it more kick, came out great!! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and easy.  I had more apples so made extra (about half again as much) topping.  I followed recipe exactly in terms of quantity of ingredients though I did use a combination of apple juice and water as the liquid.  (I wanted to try the orange juice suggested by another reviewer but didn't have it.)  I cooked it for 50 mins at 375-400 and it came out perfectly in that amount of time.  I used a 9x13 pan.  It may have been the apples I used (a tart variety of cooking apples from tree in yard) but they almost turned into applesauce -- however, it was delicious anyway.  I added a handful or two of raisins.  Will make again and thank you for sharing the recipe.

I substituted a few ingredients with things I had on hand, I used Honey Nut Crunch cereal and instant apple cinnamon oatmeal. This crisp was AMAZING (served warm over vanilla ice cream - will be even better over cinnamon ice cream!) and got rave reviews at the holidays!

This was so easy to prepare I thought it might not be very good, but boy oh boy was it ever delish! I'm not much of a baker and so I followed the recipe to a tee, except baking at 375° for 40 minutes. I used Granny Smith apples and one red Gala apple, and didn't peel them, you'd never know they had the skins on. Our friends yum yummed through every bite.

Super easy, which is great --- but also super sweet.  If I try it again, I will definitely cut back on the sugar.  Otherwise, quite nice!

Five Stars All the way - totally perfecto.  I double this recipe for my large family and there are NEVER any leftovers! Since I double the recipe I use 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar - comes out brilliant.
Cheers!

Super simple and tasted great with some vanilla ice cream. I now make this all the time. The only thing I did different is I did what the other reviewers suggested with the brown sugar.

The taste of this was just ok, but the presentation was unappealing. I wouldn't serve this to company as it goes very flat and the bake time is so long that the apples turn to soft mush.  I used Granny Smith apples and they gave it a tartness that could have used a little sugar mixed in with the apples.  It was taking a long time for the topping to brown and if my apples had cooked too much longer, they would have completely disappeared, so I put the dish under the broiler for a few minutes. The taste is ok, but I wouldn't use this recipe again unless I was stuck in the house with only a few ingredients.  My suggestions if you chose to use this are to cut the apples in thick slices, double the amount of apples, mix them in a sugar/flour/cinnamon mixuture before adding the topping.

Also used 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar. Could stand a little more flour for the crumble part as it gets a little too clumpy. Baked in Pampered Chef stoneware. Turned out nice and would be good with ice cream or for breakfast.

Great recipe! I add some lemon juice to the water for the apples to kick up the flavor a little bit. It's always eaten up at Thanksgiving dinner.

This recipe was perfect for the occasion. I followed it exactly as far as ingredients. After 40 minutes, it still wasn't done, so I did a total of 50 minutes, and that worked great. Yummy! Would have been great with vanilla ice-cream, too!

Excellent and so EASY.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I did half brown sugar like others suggested.  I used 3 large granny smith apples and used a ceramic pie pan because it looked nicer for serving and it came out great!  I love that it makes a small batch which is perfect for about 6 people.  Most recipes I've seen fill a 9x13 which is sometimes more than you want.  I will definitely make again!

My husband LOVES this!!!  I double the topping for him too :)
Every fall its the first thing he asks for as apple season comes.
He doesn't like oats in his so this was perfect and the topping to die for!!

I made just as Carrie specified.  My husband and son loved it.  I thought it was a bit too sweet, but I'm pretty sure that's because I used really sweet apples.  
Really a nice change from oat based crisp.  This will be a go to recipe for me.  Super easy too.  Well done Carrie!

This was great and so easy and simple. I followed the recipe exactly except for using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 a cup of brown sugar. This wasn't watery at all. I cooked it for 40 minutes at 350, then for 10 minutes at 400 to crisp it up. It came out perfect!

Loved this!  Just made a few very slight modifications: I  used half brown sugar/half white sugar; I used a little more flour when I made it the second time because the top didn't crisp up enough the first time; I also added a pinch of salt to the apples. I think a little salt brings out the flavor in any kind of baked apple dessert. It was slightly soupy, perhaps because I used Gala apples?  Not sure, but next time I might use 1/4 cup water instead of 1/2.  For the most part, though, I LOVED this.

This was sooooo good! Thank you for a fabulous dessert. It was easy, and tasted awesome! I doubled everything, evenly combined white and brown sugar, in which i added the cinnamon to.I baked it for 50 minutes and this was perfect. I will definitely be making it again!  :)

Wow this was the easiest dessert to fix. My husband raved. I used 3 large apples peeled first. They were still slightly crunchy even after baking for 38 minutes. Delicious fresh dessert.

It was easy and delicious.  My son and boyfriend ate it all within an hour.  I did manage to get a taste.  This was spur of the moment, next time I'll have ice cream on hand!

Too watery.  Taste was good.  If I could change anything i would mix a little flour into the apples along with the cinnamon and I would add some brown sugar to the white sugar and butter.

This was delicious.  I stuck to the recipe exactly, except that I kept it in the oven about 10 minutes longer to brown the top.  The filling was like applesauce & I wondered if that was b/c of the water, the extra time or the type of apples (I used Granny Smith.)  I liked that the apples weren't mixed w/ sugar before cooking - nice and tart.  The topping was decadent w/ all the butter and sugar.  Next time I'll cut back on both just to lighten it, but it was delicious.

Made exactly as written & found it really good.  The topping I just sprinkled over the top, did not push it into the apples, put it in a large pie plate and it was baked in 25 min, don't  forget the ice cream... YUM !!

omg. this is really good! I used a mixture of cortland and gala apples; some turned into mush, others kept their shape, which was ideal. I also added dried cranberries because that's all I had on hand, though fresh ones may be better. I don't like my dessert overly sweet so I cut down on the sugar and used mostly brown sugar and 1:3 of white sugar. Baked mine at 400F for 40 minutes and it was to die for!

This recipe was AMAZING! Used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/4 c butter as suggested.  Lovely! My husband gobbled it right up!  Will definitely make this one again.  Super simple!

this was amazing! I followed some of the custom reviews (adding tsp vanilla, 1/2c brown & 1/2 white sugar, cooking for 48 minutes) the smell was awesome when it was cooking and my husband kept asking when it would be finished! definitely worth trying...you will make it over and over and over!!

I just made this tonight.  It's fantastic and easy.  I used 2 large Granny Smith apples and 1 large Honeycrisp.  I took out the water.  I added 1/4 cup quick oats.  I used an 11x7 pan and had plenty of apples to cover the entire pan.  I baked at 400 for 25 minutes.  It came out with a very crunchy golden top.  The apples combination is sweet with a hint of tart from the Granny Smiths.  A very nice recipe that I will definitely use again.

I was searching for an apple crisp recipe that didn't call for brown sugar and luckily I found this one! I've made it with a couple different types of apples now and I enjoyed the 'mushy' version the pink ladies created. The topping is shortbread-like and I'll be making this one over and over!

We absolutely love this!  The first time I made it, I somehow forgot to even put in the water... and it was pretty sweet, but still ok!  It's been a success with family/cookouts/potlucks... you name it!

it's all about the easy with me,  and this was very easy,  I doubled the recipe, and used fresh macintosh apples. Living in Maine and being the height of apple season I couldn't resist using some fresh apple cider along with the water.

OH MY GOODNESS!! SOOOO DELICIOUS! this is possibly the best apple crisp recipe i have ever tried. the only thing i changed was that i used 6 cups of apples (i used granny smith, they make some of the best apple desserts). the rest of the amounts, i kept the same. although i actually mixed the water, apples, and cinnamon together in a bowl so the cinnamon was spread out evenly, rather than sprinkling it on top like the recipe says to do. i also took the advice of another reviewer and cooked it at 400 degrees for 35 minutes and it was perfect. other than that i didnt do anything different. great recipe! i will definitely make this OVER AND OVER AGAIN! Thank you!!

Very delicious but underneath the top crispy part, it was very runny and watery. I suggest not adding the whole 1/2 cup of water and only adding like 1/4 cup. But other than that, it was delicioso!!!

This did not come out quite as I expected. The topping was not crumbly at all, and I read other reviews on this, so I added less butter on purpose...still I ended up with a soft mushy topping. Other than that, it tasted good. My suggestion is to use less butter...even 1/2 the butter would be better.

This was SO good and so easy. I'm not a huge apple pie/crisp fan but I thought this was delicious. I think I used too much butter, as the topping was more cookie dough consistency than "crumbly" but there was no harm done! I might peel the apples next time--but thought it was great with peels intact.

Made this for supper tonight.  Excellent!  Topping was perfect, nice and crunchy.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I may cut down on the sugar next time, a bit on the sweet side.  Also added cinnamon to the topping mix.

This was a great and easy way to use up all the soft apples in my fridge.  I did change just a few things.  Instead of water I used applejuice and I also added  2 Tblsp brown sugar & 1 tsp of Vanilla Extract to mixture of flour, white sugar and butter.  I did not measure my ground cinnamon I just heavily sprinkled my apples with cinnamon and mixed.  I would guess the amount of cinnamon was more like 2 tsp.  This was so yummy and it smelt very nice cooking.  I will make this again for sure!

OK when my husband got home he wasn't impressed that I had made Apple Crisp. However, he had two helpings so his less than impressed attitude was changed. This was simple and delicious. I used rome apples as this is what I had handy. I had slightly less than 4 cups of apples and I did as others suggested and used half brown sugar(which I make at home)and half white sugar, but otherwise followed recipe as read. It was even better the next day, I should know, I had the last little bit for breakfast and yes I ate it with vanilla ice cream. I will make this again and again, next time I may add some pecans or walnuts or I may not, either way this is fantastic! Thanks for sharing Carrie.

I made this once because I didn't have oats on hand.  Now I think I'll never make another kind.  Awesome!  Use Granny Smiths for the best flavor.

Thanks for sharing this recipe! I am allergic to oats and was thrilled to find this! It lasted in our house for 1 day only.

I just decided to whip this up a few hours ago since I had the ingredients on hand.... it was AMAZING!! My oven runs hot so I only needed 30 minutes and it came out perfect. Vanilla ice cream topped it off nicely :)

Very good!  I followed the recipe as is, with a few additions/changes.  I sprinkled a few blueberries in with the apples (I used gala apples since that's what I had on hand) and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (it wasn't too sweet).  I baked it for about 50 minutes to get a nice brown color.  I'll definitely use this one again... perhaps with granny smith apples.  I gave it 5 stars because it tasted very good and was very easy to make.  Thanks, Carrie!

I absolutely love this easy recipe!  I teach culinary and it is one of the first recipes I have my students make!  Add some raisins or craisins and nuts to jazz it up if you want.  What a great way to use up leftover apples!

WOW!! So good!  I made some changes too:  First I peeled and sliced 4 granny smith apples.  Kept drizzling lemon juice over them while I worked to keep them from turning brown.  Added to pan then sprinkled 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Added the water.  Then, instead of creaming the butter and suger then adding flour, I combined 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup flour, and cut in the 1/2 cup butter to make a crumble.  Sprinkled that on top of the apples.  Then, I sprinkled 2 packets of sugar in the raw on top since it always tastes so good.  Served with whipped cream.  Was so good!  Will be making again! :)

Have you ver been at someones home and they bring you a dessert you would NORMALLY never eat?   I am NOT a cooked apple fan. The texture is so wrong.  Well That is what happened here. To be polite I tried it. MAN MAN  was it aewsome. I have made it since then as written and with adding pecans I AM IN LOVE!!! SO EASY! Apple pie haters this has a crunch that takes that mushy apple fear away! I leave the skins on... too busy to remove  TURNS OUT GREAT!

Turns out nice.  I used Spenda Blend and Splenda Brown Sugar but it came out so sickenly sweet I ended up trashing half of it.  Have to check my Splenda measures. Looked absolutely perfect.  Still gave it a 5 cause I think it was my fault.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe as stated.  My apple filling was a little dry.  Next time instead of adding the amount of water that was called for, I will add a little extra.  I have made a similar version and instead of water I used apple juice.  It made the dessert more richer.

I used 5 large apples, increased the recipe for the topping by half, used 50/50 of brown and white sugar, added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the water mixture, and finally added about a 2 handfuls of golden raisins to the apples. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and cooked for about 52 minutes. Turned off the oven and left it in there until the oven cooled. Came out pretty good :)

This is an excellent recipe! I had a lot of apples to use up from my father's apple trees and I needed to use them quickly. I made multiple batches of this recipe because we enjoyed it so much AND it is so quick and easy to make that my 6 year old and 9 year old sons did a couple batches themselves.  Modifications: I used closer to 5 cups of apples.  YOU CAN EASILY USE LESS SUGAR, even with an increase in apples!  I also made this a few times substituting honey for part of the sugar.

Very easy to make - husband enjoyed it. I did find it to be a little bit on the watery side/mushy - may depend on the apples you use.  Baked it in an 11x7 dish. Did look at a review to replace the water with OJ, instead I had cranberry juice on hand and replaced it with that.  Did take 50 minutes to bake as well.  Smells great.  EDIT: The second time around, I mixed apple and cinnamon with water.  On top, I did a crumb topping instead: mix 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon, a pinch of salt.  Melt 3/4 cup butter in different bowl.  Stir melted butter into the dry mix, add 2 cup flours with hands to make crumbled topping, spread on top evenly.

This is so easy and so delicious!  As many others mentioned, I substituted some of the sugar with brown sugar, and baked at 375 for about 40 minutes.  The first time I made it with butter as listed in the ingredients, and it was fantastic, but I made it again a week later with margarine because I realized last minute I was out of butter, and it was almost even better (the topping was more crunchy/crispy).  Great, simple recipe that seems flexible.

This is an awesome recipe! I followed the recipe with only a couple of changes..one was to add some brown sugar to the regular sugar, as some others had suggested, and the other change I made was to bake at 400 for the same amount of time. It just wasn't browning at 350. It turned out so good!!! And the house smells wonderful!!! Thanks for the easist apple crisp recipe ever!

I don't know why but I always thought of apple crisp as a daunting task to take on.  Peeling the apples was not fun but I liked this recipe so much that I made it twice in one week. I only had brown sugar so substituted that for white and added some vanilla to the water for extra flavor.  Great, easy recipe.

Absolutely wonderful! Big hit with the whole family (including my picky 6 yr old daughter and 17 month old son). So easy to make. I slightly increased the ingredients for the topping and replaced about a 1/4 cup of the white sugar with brown surgar and also used a little bit more cinnamon than what was called for. I'm glad I did, it was our favorite part. I did forget to grease the pan, but it didn't stick at all (although I did use a non-stick pan). YUMMY!

simple and perfect.  as a note, I might add that crumbling the topping ingredients together with your fingers then sprinkling it on top of the apples gives it a better texture.  yummy!

Eh, this recipe is O.K. when you don't have any oats in the house and need to make something in a hurry, but I doubt I'll make it again. Not enough texture. (Too mushy.)   My recommendation: if you live near a grocery store, just go buy some oats and make traditional apple crisp.

I used Granny Smith's, 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugars, and 2 tsp. cinnamon because we like that little extra flavor.  I didn't have to worry about leftovers - very good!

Really delicious and easy-to-make apple crisp! I'll definitely use this again! I, also, used half brown sugar and half white sugar and also used OJ instead of water, and added a tsp of vanilla into the crumble mixture. I think that my crisp could have been a bit crispier, but I'm an amateur with crisps, so I think that will come with time! Mmmmm!

It was quite tasty, but it came out liquidy. The problem lay in the apples used however. I suggest using only firm, tart apples for this (like granny smith) and veering away from any red delicious hybrids.

This recipe is wonderful!  I used red delicious apples and it was perfect!  I followed other reviews by using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown.  I also added some nutmeg and a tsp of vanilla to the crust mixture.  Sprinkle some brown sugar on top and enjoy!

This was a good apple crisp recipe and was easy to make. We just substituted Splenda for the sugar. Next time though I'm going back to my other recipe that used oats in the crisp topping. Just personal preference.

I was skeptical to try this, as I grew up on a recipe that used oats and I adored it.  However, I was out of oats, so I gave this a try.  I am glad I did!  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it really is.  I DID CUT DOWN the water to 1/4 cup, and I have to say that I will cut it down again, as I found it was still too soft and watery for my liking.  I raised the heat to 375 and baked for 30 minutes.  I also used pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon, and I loved the complexity the additional spices added.  Will make again!

This was my first apple crisp, and it was great! I took the the other reviewers' suggestions, increasing the baking time to 50 minutes and substituting half of the white sugar with brown sugar. It was very delicious!

This apple crisp was gone in no time!  It was so delicious, the only changes I made were to add a little bit less water, 2 tsp lemon juice (to keep apples from browning, which didn't matter because it didn't last that long, LOL), and to the topping 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla.   Will be making this again for sure many times!!  ~~The only problem I had, was I wish there was more of the topping...maybe I will try to make some adjustments to that the next time.

I followed the recipe pretty closely but found the top didn't come out very crispy at all- perhaps less water needed. Still tasty enough though.

I love this recipe - so simple and soooo good.  We have several apple trees out back of the house and so many apples. Have been making pies, juice, jelly, so nice to have something really simple to make for a change.  Thanks for the recipe.

DELICIOUS! So much better than the versions with oats. And it was very easy too, I used soy butter flavored spread instead of regular butter and it worked fine. I baked it for 40 minutes, which was pretty good, but it may have been better to wait until 50 minutes as others have suggested. Also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, which I think is what made the topping so good. Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!

It was a bit soggy for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it. I'm going to try 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar next time. Sooo simple and easy! I've never made crisps before; I was so used to having to labor through making muffin or cake mixes from scratch; this was a piece of cake. I made it with Mollie's Delicious Apples, turned out really good. Definitely making it again!

Cooked tonight, very delicious.  I also used vanilla and brown sugar; and sprinkled extra cinnamon on top of topping.  It was very easy to make. Definitely cook for 50 minutes.  I peeled the apples and then used my apple slicer; (the round one that you push down on the apple with) then sliced any big pieces to make the apples about the same thickness.  They cooked beautifully.

Oh yeah this was great thanks! I put half brown and half white sugar like other reviewers had suggested aswell. It is also good with added dessicated coconut and finely crushed almonds. So easy to make and ideal with vanilla ice cream or custard.

YUM!!!!!  The only addition I made was adding a little bit of nutmeg on top of the apples and on the topping, and I added Cinnamon Sugar to the topping, too.  It was really good!  Thank you for the recipe!  :)

This is fantastic!!  I followed reviewer suggestions of increasing everything by half to use a 9x13 pan, used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla to the topping, sprinkled brown sugar over the top, and baked for 50 minutes instead of 30-40.  Loved it!!

tasted great, was easy to make, and needs only a few ingredients. i cut the sugar and baked for 50 minutes as suggested by other reviewers and was very happy with the final product. i did mix the flour mixture too long so ended up rolling it flat and covering the apples with it. this recipe gives you a good base to start experimenting with.

I don't know if it is really fair that I rate this recipe, because I didn't make it exactly as printed. Anyway, here goes. I followed the suggestions of others and used half brown and half white sugar. I also sprinkled the cinnimon throughout the apples, rather than on just on top. And, I mixed in some raisins and pecans with the apples. The topping was doughy, so I just picked pieces off and lay them on top of the apple mixture. The topping was delicious, but not crumbly, as is usually associated with apple crisp. It would have been better if I had used more apples than the stated amount; they shrank down. This was tasty, but I think I will continue on my quest for the perfect apple crisp.

I made this last night for a family dinner. It was easy and delicious. I used Gala apples. I used some tips from other reviewers -- using half white and half brown sugar, and cutting the butter into the mixture of flour, sugar and cinnamon. The "cutting in " method made a more crumbly topping. I also used the entire cup of water, for a double recipe. I think the amount of water depends on the juiciness of your apples. 

It was a huge hit served warm with either vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

This was a delicious treat!  I took some advice from previous reviews and tweaked a bit.  I used macoun apples and did 1/2 c. white and 1/2 brown sugar, added only 1/2 cup of water.  I put the cinnamon mixture on the apples and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the "crust" as well.  I, too, found it needed to cook just a few minutes longer.  I got rave reviews when served with vanilla ice cream.  A definite keeper!

Delicious, quick and SO SIMPLE!  I'm giving this recipe five stars with a little tweaking...I toss the apples in some brown sugar and cinnamon before baking to evenly coat them all (rather than just sprinkling cinnamon on top).   The brown sugar adds just the right amount of rich sweetness.  I also omit the water.  I find that the fresh apples give off enough of their own liquid.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe...a classic!

EXCELLENT!  I made exactly as posted.  Used 5 granny smith apples.  My husband and I sat down and ate the entire pan as dinner one evening.  

If you find that the topping is like a dough, use cold butter and cut it into the sugar.  It will keep it clumpy instead of doughy.

this was really good i had some cider in the fridge so i used that insted of water plus a few drops of vanilla. also used 1/2cup of brown sugar with 1/2cup white sugar. use cold stick butter and kned it by hand with the sugar. if you use butter from a tub it will be to soft and to wet more like a dough. i did have to cook for a little longer then set time so keep an eye on it simple and great.

This recipe is really good and tasted great. The topping for me was more like a dough than a crumble, and it never got crispy. The taste was very good though. Thank you!

This was way too sweet, and I love sweet stuff. My topping was a little weird too, I used half brown and half white sugar. I added water like the recipe called for and the consistancy was fine. I might make this again with some adjustments, only because it was so easy.

MMMMM GREAT! This Apple Crisp has to be the best one I have ever had, the sweet crust mixing with the apples and just a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream! mmm... a piece of heaven. though I do have to say that I did alter your recipe a bit, I just added a little sugar to the apples and mixed them and the cinnamon together before adding the crust and cooking. I used tart Granny Smith apples for the recipe so I don't recommend it if anyone uses any other sweeter apples.

Wow, this was good!! The topping is fantastic, tastes almost like a hardend cookie batter mixture! The only changes I made was to reduce the water to 1/4 cup and sprinkle apples w/ lemon juice. Next time I will double the recipe as it didnt last long enough in my house!

I loved this soooo much... It was so easy and it turned out to be soooo tasty.. my boyfriend couldnt get enough.....I followed everyones advice of doing 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.. the only thing i did different was the after I sliced and peeled the apples I added  some brown and white sugar and let it sit while i was preparing everything else... then when i was ready i did the recipe plus adding the sugar again.. i was a little afraid it was going to turn out to sweet but it didnt.... the apples absored the sugar so perfect ... will definetly do this again and again

I made two pans of this for the other students in my dorm and they LOVED it.  I made another two pans to take to class the next day!  It is wonderful warm with vanilla ice cream.  It is also good chilled- the topping gets crunchy, almost toffee-like.  Great recipe!

I made this for a company picnic the night before and it was nothing but mush the next day. It was more like apple pudding, nothing crisp about it all. Major disappointment, I'm going to move onto other recipes.

Try adding 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the topping. It gives it a lot more flavor! Also, I used grapples. They are a new grape flavored apple you can get at wal-mart and any other grocer. It was delicious!

This was very good. Like other users suggested I used 1/2 and 1/2 on the sugar and one user suggested orange juice which I did. The orange juice really brings out the flavor of the apples it is also good for peach cobbler as well. I did spice up the apples a bit with nutmeg and cinnamon and added some butter to the apples.I used Granny Smith apples and the crisp did a great job of being crispy. I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you for sharing.

I give this 5 stars as it is, but it could get 6 stars from me with these changes:  blend 1/2c. each of white and brown sugars and bake at 400 for about 30 to 40 min.  I love the crisp cookie-like quality of the topping with the tartness of good baking apples underneath.  My taste-testers agree:  Wonderful warm on a rainy day!

Very sweet.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion of using 1/3 c brown sugar with 1/3 c white sugar for Fuji apples.  I found that the top isn't all that crisp, a little on the doughy side.  But when it cools and after you stick it in the ref for a few hours, it does get more crisp.  Also, you don't need all that much water.  i took it out of the oven when the apples started bubbling because the other apple crisp I did turned a bit mushy--I'd waited for the top to turn brown/solid-looking instead of soft before removing from the oven.  I also sprinkled the top with some granulated sugar and it looked nice.

Excellent!!  I've made this several times and it never lasts long after it comes out of the oven.  I use granny smith apples and they are perfect for this recipe.  I also followed other reviewers advice and broiled it for a couple of minutes after baking to get that beautiful golden crust.  This is definatley a keeper

I love this apple crisp without the oats, and made it twice.  I used a cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.  I left out the water, and just mixed the cinnamon in the topping.  I used Granny Smith apples for the recipe, 4 large or 6 small.

Very good recipe.  I had some fresh peaches that I needed to use up so I used 6 large peaches in place of the apples.  I also reduced the water to 1/3 cup and added 1 tsp. of almond extract and 1/2 tsp. of orange extract to the water.  Turned out really yummy.

This recipe is so DELICIOUS!!  All in our family agree that it is the best apple crisp we have ever had.  Even better than apple pie. I added a small pinch of sea salt to the topping.  Thank you so much!!

I used fresh peaches instead of the apples, cut back on liquid to 2Tbs, and replaced water with oj.
I was absolutely delicious.

The recipe should have been called Apple Goo. I should have omitted the water. Topping as not crumbly, it was sticky and in attempt to brown the crust I overcooked the apples. (Good flavor though.)

This recipe was SO good! I made it for a graduation party yesterday, and got tons of compliments on it! I cut the amount of water in half, and also used 1/2 c. of brown sugar, and 1/2 c. of white sugar. It turned out perfect, I will definintely be using this one again!

Easy and delicious. I didn't use the water, but, I wish I would have.It wasn't as moist as I had hoped. I also used half white sugar and half brown. Great with cool whip. So quick to make. It has apple pie taste, without the apple pie work.

This was great after a few changes were made.  I'm giving it a four because I think the recipe may have flaws.  I put no water with mine and it took all of 50 minutes to get done.  I would also add more apples.  The topping needed more flour to be crumbly at all.  Wonderful flavor.

Very good and very quick to make.  I used 1/3 cup of water,( instead of 1/2 cup, and  1/3 cup of brown and 1/3 cup of white sugar instead of 1 cup of sugar.  Baked for 50 minutes, and it was delicious.

Mine turned out really soggy as well.  There is basically no crust left, all the sugar dissolved in the water and it became a very sweet baked applesauce thing.  I used Macintosh apples and 1/2 cup water.  I think the amount of water needed for the recipe varies with apple type and that if I make again with Macintosh, I will use very little water (a couple of tablespoons).

This recipe is super easy, and VERY tasty!!  I took the advice of others and used half white and half brown sugar.. I also cut the water in half and used about a couple teaspoons of lemon juice.  Sprinkled cinnamon on the apples and the crust as well as a bit of nutmeg! I also cooked it for 50min. instead of 40. PERFECTION in a pan!!

This was delicious and so easy to make! A great alternative to pie! However, I seemed to have to bake it for almost an hour (at 400 degrees F) to get the golden brown crust. Still, worth the wait!

this is by far the best and easiest apple dish i've ever made.  the hardest part of this recipe is peeling the apples.  i did add a little more cinnamon then called for.  i completely recommend this to anyone who loves apples.

So easy and tasted awesome. Pretty much impossible to mess up. I would use 1/4 to 1/3 cup of water instead of 1/2. It was a little soft, but still a recipe I will use over and over!

Followed recipe exactly and came out with a not so good result. The only changes made was: I added walnuts (I enjoyed that part!) and had to cook it DOUBLE the time stated and I broiled it for about 1 minute to brown the crust. 
Husband and I found this too sweet with a grainy texture because of the white sugar called for and the apples too soft because of how long it took to cook the doughy top. I should have also went with my instinct to peel them as well. I know I used the wrong kind as well, but I only had 3 golden delicious on hand. We like ours with a bit more bite. I missed the crust on the bottom of a traditional crisp. I will still be looking for a better recipe because this one didn't even come close!

The most versatile recipe you will ever try!  I've tried it with pineapple, blackberry, raspberry, but so far our favorite has been blackberry with apple.  As for the topping, I use half applesauce to cut the fat, and Bob's Red Mill gluten-free all-purpose flour mix (my mom's allergic to wheat), and it really tastes great!  However, I once went to the extreme and used half applesauce and half oil for the butter, and then 1 1/3 cup honey in place of the sugar, and then like 2 cups of glutenfree flour, and it was a disaster.  You at least really need the sugar!  Great recipe to have fun with!

a very easy recipe with a big outcome.  the dough was a little rich so i'll cut the sugar and butter a little.  i read another review that it turned out doughy so i added 5/8 cup flour instead of 6/8 cup.  a good recipe nonetheless.

5 stars for simplicity. 3 stars for taste. With only a couple of ingredients you can make a warm dessert. But it took me longer than 35 minutes to bake and it tasted somewhat doughy.

My 13-year-old daughter makes this for special family dinners, and always enjoys the rave reviews!  It is easy to make, smells wonderful cooking, and is absolutely yummy.  I'd have thought that without oats or brown sugar, it couldn't possibly be as good as my grandma's -- but it comes darn close!

This is the recipe that I've gotten the most use out of on this site. It is heavenly. It is so easy, and when it bakes, it creates an almost carmelly flavor to the apples. I've served this several times for dessert when our friends come over, and I keep "forgetting" to give their wives the recipe because they all think I'm such an excellent cook!

Wonderful recipe! It is so similar to what I am used to eating without the oats. I used really unripened green apples off my own tree that my daughter knocked down and they were perfect in it.

Fantastic!  My family loved it!  I used Washington apples, but will have to try Granny Smith ones.  I also followed the brown sugar and vanilla recommendations.

I made this recipie to impress a guy I like, and let me tell you... it worked!  I followed other users recommendations of using 1/2 brown sugar and adding a dash of vanilla to the mix.  Went perfectly with some Ben and Jerry's.

TO DIE FOR! My husband had a sweet craving and I didn't have much in the house.  All I have to say is he ate half of it before bed!  I had to cook it 15 minutes longer and added a little more cinnamon and some nutmeg.

This was an amazing recipe.  I changed it up a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used canned apple pie mixture instead of sliced apples and left out the water.  This was such a huge hit with the family and guests I am making it again next week.  Very gooey and yummy.  Great with vanilla ice cream too!  Thanks!

This needs to be baked longer than suggested, But when browned nicely, it's delicious. Also, if using tart apples, add some sugar to the apples

It's extremly tasty, you'll be a big fan if you're keen on apple sauce and cinnamon buns. Mixing the butter and the sugar together was NOT easy, it says to cream it and let me tell you - IMPOSSIBLE. Nuke it in the microwave for about 30 seconds, trust me! If I ever made it again, I would use only 2/3 of the sugar, because it's a little too bitter. Without the batter on top it would make a great ice cream topping! I like it better cold, try it! Perfect for when you don't have much around the house.

Easy & excellant.  Does require an extra 10-15 minutes cooking time (depending on how thinly you slice your apples.)  Also switching to 1/2 brown sugar helped to brown it.  Highly recommended.

I just made this apple crisp recipe for my son and husband (who is super picky) and they LOVED it!  It didn't take me long to make and I topped it off with vanilla ice cream and also added walnuts.  It browned to perfection and was just great!  This recipe tastes like the apple crisp at Chiles if not better!  Definately a keeper!

This is surely one of the most delicious and easiest apple crisp I ever had..this is the first time I tried to make it homemade and it blows the box mix away! It took about an hour to make it golden brown but well worth the wait!! This is staying my my personal recipe book!!

I just made this for my family and it was a hit!  The kids really liked it, even the 2yr old.  I added a little more than 4 cups of apples because we like alot of apples.  I also subsituted half of the brown sugar for the white and add some cinnamon for the topping.  Will definitely be making this one alot.

This recipe is so good!! My boyfriend who is a very picky eater loved it! He kept saying YUM!!!! It was easy and a light dessert. I added some brown sugar to the topping and sprinkled a hint of sugar onto the 2 types of apples I used (Granny Smith and Fuji). It was wonderful and it surely does make the house smell great!

This is my new go-to apple recipe. It is so easy and good. I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe says, but it is worth the wait! I used a mix of honeycrisp, fuji, golden delicious, and granny smith apples, and I used an apple peeler/corer/slicer for thin slices.

I made it today. Delicious!  I used 3/4 sugar, 1/4 brown sugar, added 2 tsp of vanilla (1 in apple mix, 1 in topping, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg in apple mix.  Next time I'm thinking of adding lemon juice in apple mix too.  Husband liked it too!

Best Apple crisp recipe ever.  I thought without oats it would lack something but not so!  In fact, crispier!  I had RD apples on hand so used those and did not think it was too sweet.  Had some I needed to use up so probably put in five cups and it was not too much at all.  Could have added more even!  Added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of nutmeg as some reviewers suggested.  Fantastic.  Thank you fir a great recipe!

Like others, after reading the reviews, I tweaked the recipe just a little. To the apple mixture recipe, instead of adding water, I added two snack-size containers of Musselman's Natural Apple Sauce with cinnamon, one tsp. cornstarch, a pinch of salt, and a few drizzles of real maple syrup. For the crumb mixture recipe, I used one-and-a-half times of all ingredients to increase the amount of crumbs on top, used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and added a pinch of salt. I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes in a 8x11 pan, then broiled the top for 4 mins. Delish! Thank you for this great recipe!

Delicious!  I had 7 apples that needed to be used.  I peeled and sliced them, then tossed them with a tablespoon of cinnamon and sugar.  I skipped the water as I felt they would be too mushy.  It turned out perfect for our tastes.  My baking time was one hour.  Thank you Carrie for sharing your recipe!

The only thing I did different is added a tablespoon of cinnamon in the apples (instead of a teaspoon)  and sprinkled some cinnamon on top (I like cinnamon) this recipe is easy and 
was an instantt hit. Going to be a Wednesday night church dessert from here on out.

I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar to add a little more to the flavor profile.  I also used freshly picked Rome apples.

So quick, easy and delicious!  Served warm with vanilla ice cream.

I made this for Halloween and have already made two more batches for a party and home within a week.  Very simple and easy to follow recipe.  I would call it more of an apple cobbler since mine did not get crispy, but still got rave reviews each time.  I did follow suggestions and cooked for 50-55 minutes each time and put a little less flour in.  I also used half and half of white and brown sugar plus kept the water.  I will be making this again.  Thanks.

The glazey sauce that forms from the sugar and water is ...well, watery tasting.  I would use apple juice instead of water IF I were to make it again.  And, the top didn't get crisp. It just stayed loose and dry and crumbly.

This is a super quick and easy recipe! I used brown sugar instead of white and sprinkled chopped pecans on the top. I also added ground ginger for some added spice and it was really good! You can’t go wrong!

This was perfectly tasty.  I prefer the type of apple crisp with oats, but I found this one when I realized I didn't have any oats and wanted to use up some apples.  It is almost a cobbler texture.

8.26.18  We’re not into super sweet food, and I knew that 1 cup of sugar would be too much for us (personal taste).  I reduced that to 1/2 cup, and ended up with what I still thought was a sweet apple crisp where you really can enjoy the sweetness of the apple.  I used a mixture of different apples (Gala, Fuji, Granny), and it took four to reach four cups sliced. I also cut back the amount of water just a bit.  Used my apple peeler, then my apple corer, and then the food processor for slicing.   Wow, was this ever easy, and oh-so-tasty!  Wouldn’t hesitate to make this again.

I just made this tonight and it was very delicious. My daughter loved it too. Next time I'll make sure not to almost melt the butter. I had to use a lot more flour to make up for that in order to get dough crumbly and not a gooey mess and I made sure to add more cinnamon and brown sugar in my dough to compensate for all of the flour I used. Also my apples weren't fresh bought, I have had them cored, sliced and frozen for about 5 months. After thawing them out, I squeezed excess water and popped them in oven for about 4 minutes to remove excess moisture.

Was looking for a simple recipe to use up some red delicious apples I had. What a wonderful dish! I did what others suggested and used 1/2 c brown and 1/2 c white. Cut cold butter into the flour sugar mixture. Took about 50 m at 375 in my toaster oven. There are other good recipes for apple crisp but this is so easy!

I found this recipe several years ago and my family LOVED it! Every year they continue to ask for it. I went along with the other reviews and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and I also sprinkle a little more cinnamon on the top as well. I use any type of apple and it always comes out delicious!

I made this last night. Followed it exactly except I added a few more apples. But the topping would not get crispy. I cooked longer trying to get it crispy. Hopping someone could help. The recipe was great otherwise

This is a great recipe. I have made with apples, peaches, blueberries, rhubarb, and rhubarb/strawberries. With most fruits other than apples, I do not use the water. With my frozen peaches, I even drain off some of the liquid after thawing as there is lot. Use your judgement on that. Use whatever spice you would use for a pie. You won't be disappointed.

We made this following directions - it was a hit! We took it pre-baked to a friend's house for dinner, baked it in her oven while we ate dinner. Nice and crispy! Easy to make; easy directions; easy clean up. We used Honey Crisp apples - perfect. And we baked in 9" round pan (not quite 4 cups of apples).

This is now my go- to recipe for an apple dessert.  I love apple pie but this is a lot less work and delivers all the flavor.  I've made it using Granny Smiths as well as 20 Ounce apples and usually use more apples than called for.  For the sugar I use half brown and half white.  People love it!  It's good plain, warm from the oven, or with whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Really easy and yummy.  I altered it a bit....used Macintosh apples, used only 1/2 cup brown sugar, added pinch of nutmeg, used 3/4 cup flour plus 1/4 cup rolled oats, added a pinch of salt and used just under 1/2 cup butter.
Will definitely make this again. 
When removing from oven, the juices really bubbled to the top, but it did settle back down after cooling.  Maybe next time I'll use a bit less water.

I made it and everyone in my family loved it.  My son even took a piece for his girlfriend's boss, lol. Anyway, I did a very small change,instead of 1 cup sugar I put in 3/4 cup sugar.  It was perfect.

Absolutely fantastic!  Like others suggested, I added vanilla to the crumble mix and sprinkled brown sugar on the top.  I also drizzled maple syrup on the apples before adding the crumble and topped with a few pecans.  Will definitely be making this again!

I have made it 6 times. I added 1/4 tsp salt to apple mix and 1/2 tsp salt to crumble. Cut apples in big chunks so they don't get mushy.   No water. Cook only for 20 min at 350 deg and then used broiler to get topping to desired brown.
I also added some lemon juice and a bit of nutmeg. Only 1/2 cup sugar- put a little in the apples. Added 1/2 cup oatmeal to crumble

I made this recipe tonight but used gluten free flour, and also added some mixed frozen fruit as I only had 3 cups of sliced apples. Absolutely delicious, I think I prefer this recipe instead of apple crisp made with oats.

Used 12 cups of red apples (peel) and double the other ingredients but 1 cup of sugar was too sweet with red apples.   Put in a 9 x 13 dish or split in two 8 x 8 dishes.
Used 6 good size peel gala apples for 12 cups. (VERY GOOD)

I loved the recipe and the way it made my house smell, yum! I did make a few adjustments to temp, like I see a few others did, as well. After about 30 minutes, I bumped it up to 400 degrees and let it bake another 20. The top was perfectly browned and the apples were still boiling, making for a nice softness, which I prefer. I did get crazy and add about eighth cup brown sugar to the apple mixture and a dusting of nutmeg across the top before adding the crust topping. Delicious! Enjoy your treats!

I used granny smith apples which added a tart flavor to complement the sweet flavors.  My guests raved about it and cleaned their plates.  I should have made two of them!!!  I served with salted caramel ice cream...great combo!

We may replace our annual apple pie at Thanksgiving with this recipe because it tastes just as good.  It is quick and easy!  We accidentally creamed in the flour the first time we made it.  It looked like a sugar cookie on top, but it tasted delicious like that.  It doesn't need salt if you add salted butter.  The water made the apples nice and soft and it was not runny.  Our apple of choice is granny smith and it was not too sweet because we also had the tartness.  This time we are cutting in the butter with the mixture of sugar, cinnamon and flour to make it more of a crumble.  We may go back to the other method if this isn't as good.  Thanks for a simple but comforting dessert!

I made this because I wanted something quick and apple-tasting. This was quick but the apples got lost in all the sugar. It's super sweet sweet sweet. Too sweet for me. Yuk! Cut the sugar to 1/2 or even 1/4c and cut the cinnamon to 1/2tsp and it might be doable. I'll stick with my tried and true recipe involving rolled oats.

Per some other comments I did 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar and mixed it with the flour and cinnamon then cut in the butter till mixture was crumbled up. Next time I would only add 1/4 c of water, if any, to the apples. A more tart apple would be a good thing too, as the topping is pretty sugary but GOOD! Ice cream is a must too!

I made this with a few changes (as suggested by other commenters). I used 6 granny smith apples, brown sugar instead of white,  and doubled the topping recipe. Dumped all in a 13X9 pan and baked for 40 minutes. Delicious! Topped with ice cream. Will definitely make again.

My son has many allergies, but loves baked goods. So, I used dairy-free, soy-free butter, Bob's Gluten- free flour, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. He loved it! This was very easy to make and will definitely make it again.

Fantastic and easy!! Baked perfectly in 40 minutes. I added a very light dusting of clove and nutmeg over the apples with the cinnamon, half and half white and brown sugar, and a dash of vanilla to the butter/sugar. DEELISH!!

This was a great apple crisp.  I forgot to add the water the first time I made it and it still turned out great, so now I never add water.  I use about 3/4 cup of sugar and that seems to be the right amount.  I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.

Today I'm making this for the second time. I absolutely love it! Being a diabetic and my mom also, its so expensive buying sugar free anything! And not much of a selection either. All i did was switch the sugar with splenda and the taste was unbelievably delicious!

I had to make this for a culinary project. It turned out very well. Adding half brown and half white was a great change. I also had a little bit of brown sugar left in the bag so I sprinkles that on top. I had to raise the temperature to 375 at one point because it took to long to cook. I would next time add less water because I had a lot of water left on the bottom of the dish.

Dec.2,2014 11:30am. I needed a quick easy dessert for tonight's Christian event. Again, I found this recipe after searching for 15 min. on the internet. The 1 st time, I used this recipe using 2-16oz. baggies of my fresh frozen cooked apples with the brown and Splenda sugars,cinnamon and nutmeg (already added). The juice mixture thawing was adequate amt. without the water. It was moist and delicious. I, also used this recipe for peach crisp today. For the peach crisp I used my hand chopper to chop the 2-16 oz. cans of drained peaches. Boiled 1 cup of raisins in water and added the drained raisins plus 3/4 cup of peach juice to the peaches. I sprinkled the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/2 sugars on top of the peaches before doing the crumbled topping. Instead of butter,etc. I used a 1/2 cup of Crisco Butter Shortening in the crumbled mixture. Time to prepare 15 min.
This Peach Crisp I took to the Christmas Women's Advent Dessert Program Tonight, Dec. 2 and it was a big hit. Thanks, so very much for an economical, quick-easy delicious recipe. That I can make various crisps with.  What a Blessing this recipe is as I haven't baked for years and this is so easy. Thanks again, Carolann

I finally found a winner! I have tried several different recipes but the topping would end up soggy and gross.  I used Crisco shortening instead of butter, and only 1/4 cup water to prevent the top from getting soggy.  I also baked it at 400° and just removed it when the top got golden brown.   Perfection!  Check out my picture :)

Finally apple crisp that isn't runny & no oatmeal!  Do as the others say in the reviews, 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugars, no water added, I added vanilla (didn't measure, guessed) and cooked longer at a higher oven temp.  I used jonmac apples & northern spy. Both are tart/sweet tasting. I used a 9X11 baking dish, so I doubled the apples and not so much on the topping. I did use 1 cup flour, like the others said & mixed extra cinnamon, ground ginger,& nutmeg into the butter/flour. I also sprinkled the apples with those, not a lot, and only the top layer. Good Luck!

I searched the internet high and low for an apple crisp recipe without oats so that I didn't have to go back to the grocery store. I came across this one and decided to give it a shot. For apples, I used 2 large northern spy and 2 small-medium golden delicious. The final result came out fantastic! I ended up extending the cook time to about 55 minutes.

Great flavor, but very watery. Next time I'll skip the water. Could have done 1-2 more cups of apples for an 8x8 dish. I did 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and oats instead of flour.

Such an easy recipe that turns out fantastic every time. I do make a few changes: half of the sugar I do brown, other half white, tons more cinnamon (1.5T), 1/2T vanilla in the butter mixture, and I drizzle some caramel sauce over the apples before covering with the topping.

My mix has been in the oven for about 50 minutes and it's not "crisped up" at all. I have a feeling it's going to have a texture more of a dumpling or cobbler.

i made it with plain white sugar as per the recipe - the crust was crunchy but it was really like eating a crumbly rock of sugar - tooooo sweet! I love too sweet sweets but this one in combination with icecream just killed the taste  :(  Sorry !

We loved the flavor of this apple crisp.  A great variation without the oats. Quick and super easy.  Could have easily added more apples or cut down on the sugar.  Baked 30 minutes at 350 degrees, then 20 minutes at 400 degrees.  Made the perfect crunchy topping.  Will definitely make this again and have already shared it with my friends.  Thanks!

I made this exactly as directed.  It really is very easy & fast to make.  However, I think it was a bit too sweet and not enough crumb-like texture.  Still, it was still very yummy.

Great recipe! As suggested by others, I used half white and half brown sugar. With such sweet topping, I doubled the apples and cinnamon. Added 1/4 tsp. salt to the topping. It made a 9x13 pan that was devoured by my guests. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe and for all the helpful reviewer suggestions.

Excellent!   Our apple trees were full this year, so I've been working my way through the various recipes.  This is my favorite...not only is it delicious, but it's probably the easiest recipe to make, next to applesauce.  I took the advice of using a mix of brown sugar with white. I also reduced the butter by almost half and substituted apple sauce in its place.  Everyone loves it!

The recipe itself turned out good but when it came out, it was super watery. Everyone liked it, but for me, it was too sweet. Sorry but I'll try again soon. ~ Baker101

This was to die for!!! I made this last night and followed the reviewer who increased everything by half. I used 5 Granny Smith apples and also used half white sugar and half brown. The entire platter was done in minutes. The topping was crunchy and buttery!! I baked at 400 for about 35-40 minutes! Thank you so much for sharing! I pinned already!

Very good, very easy.  I made only 2 changes. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and only 1/4 cup of water. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was wonderful. I would add 1tsp of vanilla. and use 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. It does need to cook longer to brown fully and crisp. Gave a 4 star only because the crust wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked. Flavor still great though.

Very good when served warm. Instead of sprinkling the cinnamon on the apples, put the apples and cinnamon in a different bowl and mix it up. Also use brown sugar as well as white (half&half)

I agree. I think I used too much butter I'm pretty sure, and the topping turned out more 'spreadable' than 'sprinkleable'. It turned out great, but 1/2 brown sugar/white sugar is a good idea too.

This is a great recipe for apple crisp.  Simple and oat free.  I make it with about 1/2 the sugar and cut the water a bit depending on what type of apple I use.  To add some depth of flavor, add a teaspoon of lemon juice to the apple mixture and some finely chopped pecans to the topping.  Perfect!

What a Hot Goopy MESS!! Followed directions except used half white and half brown sugars like everyone said and did add 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Tasted great but looked like pie filling. SO...I wasn't about to throw it out and I didn't have all ingredients to make a pie crust. I decided to mix up some buttermilk pancake mix.  I stired up the goop and put it in the pancake mix. I did have to thin the batter down. I baked them out like a regular pancake (but it took just a bit longer per cake). And VOILA....Goopy Apple Pancakes.  I sprinkled them with powdered sugar..yum. And what was left over (without powdered sugar), I put in the freezer so my husband can have them whenever he wants!!

This was Amazing!! I followed this recipe as is. I used Jonagold apples. I researched several recipes before deciding to make this one and was a little worried because it didn't look much like the other recipes did. This one had the appearance of a biscuit when it was done. But don't let the looks of it fool you! It tastes fantastic!! Will be making it again very soon!

This was amazing.  I followed everyone's suggestion of using 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white.  I also baked for 50 minutes as suggested.  I added 1/2 cup oats to the topping for some extra texture and it came out amazing.  I had just picked some Golden Delicious which I used.  I didn't think it came out too sweet at all.  Will definitely make again.  It's so easy too!  I also coated my apples with the tsp cinnamon in a bowl first so they'd be evenly coated.  I also added nutmeg to the apples and to the topping.

It was delicious and the topping was amazing - however, the apples were a little watery underneath, even after being refrigerated.  According to one of the 7 year olds I watch, it looked like applesauce underneath (but it was goooooood).  :)

I put too manuy apples in I think because I ended up with apple cobbler instead of crisp! lol!  But the taste was fantastic.  I cored and cubed the apples and left the skins on.  I used gala and granny smith. Next time I will use less apples and maybe leave out the water - it didnt need it with the extra apples.  I was very pleased with the results though - if a failure is this good imagine how tasty the real thing is!

Thank you;  I liked this very much.  Tastes like a dutch apple pie without the crust.  Used half brown and half regular sugar.  Arranged this in my glass pie plate; it fit perfectly.  I baked 40 min @ 375 ~ got away using qtr cup less butter.  I did not peel the apples. ~ I have an apple peeler, and it saves a lot of time.  Smelled so good as it baked.

Simple & fantastic when served warm with Vanilla Ice Cream!  I too made some minor adjustments to the recipe; I did not have an 8 x 8 pan so I used an 8 x 11...it came out great...Also, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar & 1/2 c. white sugar with double the ground cinnamon & 1 tsp. nutmeg...highly reccomend this for when you run out of rolled oats!

I have made this twice and everybody loves it!  I cook it for 55 minutes and then broil it slightly to brown the top, not the 30-40 minutes it states.

So easy and delicious. I made two, one for me and one for a friend. I also did half brown sugar and white sugar. For the topping, i threw a little extra cinnamon in with the flour and the brown and white sugar. Cooked for 50 minutes with two.

This was great with changes suggested by previous reviewers!  I included the cinnamon with the flour (and used extra per my own taste), and I didn't want it to be as damp as some reviewers suggested it was, so I added about 1/4 cup extra flour.  This received rave reviews and was gone very quickly. I will use less sugar next time.

I LOVE this. It's so easy to make! Had apples at hand and wanted a bake a treat for my family and classmates. I took heed of others suggestions and used 1/4 brown and 1/4 white sugar. Used 3 red, small apples and followed the recipe. It didn't turn out quite as expected though. There was too much water, apples were too soft, and as there was too much water the topping wasn't as crisp. But it stil tasted great! Next time I'm going to omit the water all together and use slightly ripe apples instead of the ripe apples I used. Going to use slightly less butter too. But the results were my fault as I didn't really take into consideration the ripeness of the apples(they had more moisture in them) so I think that the key to this recipe are the apples. They shouldn't be very ripe and if they are just cut down the amount of water or omit it completely. Agree with others though. It's awesome with vanilla ice-cream(Other flavours are fine as long as they aren't too sweet. The crisp is sweet anough on its own)

I agree with the other reviews to reduce the water. Since it was my first time, I left it as is and it came out really watery. I ended up trying to get rid of most of the water after it baked. The crumble was also super sweet so I'll probably reduce the sugar a little next time too (I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown). But other than that it was positively scrumptious! I'm not a fan of oatmeal so this was a great recipe!

This is a great starter recipe for a great apple crisp. Like a lot of people I used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar, but something different I do is use a very dry white wine in place of the water. This makes it not quite as sweet, and gives a different taste.

This is a simple but delicious apple crisp.  I would recommend peeling your apples.  The topping was crunchy and I loved the cinnamon/butter flavor.  It smelled great while baking. This was gone very quickly!

I made this apple crisp III with tart green apples unpeeled and sliced with an apple corer/slicer; my kid ate it so it was good but I think it may need some ice cream.  It did not brown or crisp which I like crust but it was rich inside like pie.  It took much longer than the 40 min. to cook and more water was added but I did not add vanilla.  I made it in a 8" by 8" pan.

Looked beautiful when I took out of the oven.  My husband loved.  For me, it was a little sweet for my taste.  I will definitely make again, but cut down on the sugar.

this was a really good recipe...i actually made a few alterations to it. I added a can of canned pineapple chunks and replaced the water with the pineapple juice. i also used more cinnamon than the recipe asked for and i sprinkled the fruit with lemon juice and a few pinches of brown sugar. I also added a tad bit of brown sugar and cinnamon to the topping. My slight changes made this recipe even better.

This is wonderful. At first I was concerned about how dense the topping was with all the butter, but it serves like apple crisp topped with butter cookies. Seriously, what could taste better than that.  Add some fresh whipped heavy cream with vanilla & powdered sugar & get a gym membership.  Thanks again for another big hit.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfectly. I prefer this over the typical oat recipe for apple crisp. You have got to try this, you won't go back!

Amazing! I used Macintosh apples and basically quadrupled the cinnamon and added a touch of ginger. I added cinnamon to the apples as well as the crust. I was going to use brown sugar instead but ran out...and I never would've been able to tell the difference with the white sugar. I'd make this again in a heartbeat..it was so easy!

This was sooo good.  I made a few changes to make it a little healthier and it still turned out super delicious!  Used 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c granulated Splenda (for baking).  Also used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I chopped up about 3/4 cup of pecans and added to the topping mixture.  I like a lot of spice so I sprinkled a little bit of ground cloves and nutmeg over the apples along with the cinnamon.  When it was done, you couldn't tell there was Splenda or whole wheat flour used.  My husband raved about it and it was super yummy.  Totally recommend the healthier changes, you won't miss anything!

Very good and very easy.  I used two different kinds of apples (one tart and one sweet) and it turned out very well.  I did have to cook it about 35 minutes longer than the directions to get the crust to brown, but that wasn't really a problem because I had the time.

This is easy, SO delicious, and always a hit at our house. I make this when ever there are a few apples sitting around in the fridge and no one wants to eat them. This is a sure way to use those last 4 or 5 apples !

This was great!  Easy and not too many ingredients.  I cooked it a little longer and added some oats for texture.  Also, I didn't peel the apples because we like the skins.  Use Granny Smiths!  They're the best.

Loved this!  This recipe was a HUGE hit after Thanksgiving dinner! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and that made it even more delicious! I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, I added some vanilla to the crust, and then sprinkled a little extra brown sugar to top the crust.  Everyone loved it!

This is a great recipe! It is so easy to make (Im new to cooking. if i can make it you can make it) it does not take very long to make. I use the golden delicous apples, they just give a great taste to the dessert. I would recomend french vanilla icecream to go along with it. This dessert, hot out of the oven with french vanilla icecream. mmmmm  You just cant beat it!

This recipe was great.  I read all of the reviews and ended up using 1/2 cup of Brown Sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar... i also put in 1/2 tsp of vanilla and added some oats to the flour mix.  It was a hit!  And very easy to make.

This was an average dessert that would not have done as well without the vanilla ice cream. It was, however, easy to make at the last minute with ingredients I had on hand - a big plus. Will try this again.

the is without doubt the easiest crisp recipe every.This is my second time making it and it now in my rotation of easy throw together desserts,Im trying raisin and walnuts this time.One Hint the butter must be cool when you mix with the sugar to get that butter crumb taste otherwise you'll have a sweet butter sauce

Wonderful, traditional apple crisp.  Use an apple that is a bit tart, like a granny smith.  I followed the recipe for the most part- the only real changes were that I added more sugar than called for, and used 1/2 brown sugar as others recommended.  This is an excellent dessert- vanilla ice cream in a must have.

Fantastic recipe.  I did use half brown sugar and half white sugar as suggested by others and subbed a little orange juice for the water.  Used Granny Smith apples.  Everyone at our Thanksgiving table today loved this and said they would never bake an apple pie again after tasting this apple crisp.

boy was this great I added vanilla, blueberries, and oats.  But even without all that stuff I added it would still be the best crisp ever.

I followed others suggestions as to using white and brown sugar, vanilla, and sprinkling brown sugar on top. Only problem was, it ran out of crust before the apples were gone. I will double the crust ingredients next time. I topped with hot butterscotch lI recipe submitted by JRUF34. It was delicious.

This was such an easy recipe. I had everything in my kitchen didn't have to go buy anything. 1st time making it I used all white sugar, 2nd time 1/2 white ad 1/2 brown sugar. Both came out great and my husband loved it too.

This was fabulous!!!  I did take other's advice and up the oven temp to 400 and it took about 40 min to brown up nicely.  I also added the cinnamon to the topping.

EXCELLENT & EASY!!! Made five for a party that was being catered by someone else.  It was the first dessert that was gone and the caterer couldn't get over all the compliments!  I followed the suggestions and used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and added just a dash of nutmeg too.  I also made them all the day before and served them room temperature with whip cream - hot or cold it's great!

Outstanding!  I used approx. 2.5 cups of sliced apples (all I had) and 1/2 brown sugar in place of 1/2 white.  I also sprinkled some more cinnamon on the top before baking.  Not very "crispy" really, but family loved it.  Thank you!

It was very tasty, but not very crunchy on top. I didn't even use the water.  I doubled the topping ingredients, so perhaps doubling the butter was a mistake.

wonderful fall dessert.  Made with tart apples from the orchard.  Doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 dish. Served with vanilla ice cream.  Everybody at our church group LOVED it! Thanks for the easy recipe.

I am eating this as I type.  It is SO good!  It smelled heavenly while it was baking.  The hardest part is peeling the darn apples, but it is definitely worth it.  I made double the recipe because I had a ton of apples that I didn't want to go to waste.  Followed the recipe exactly and I am glad I found one that had everything I already had in the house.  I will be making this again and again. Thank you!

Excellent and easy to modify with pears or berries. I'm certainly a little more liberal with the cinnamon than the recipes calls for.

This recipe is by far the easiest, most delicious recipe for Apple Crisp. I do think next time I will also change the sugar to 1/2 brown & 1/2 white. I did feel it was really sweet,(which you won't get any complaints from me), but my family devours it; so I need al the help I can get! " MANY KUDOS " to this recipe!!!! I will definitely use the recipe again. (maye for Thanksgiving!)

Very easy and delicious. Also VERY sweet. Definitely need some vanilla ice cream to tone it down. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar as other suggested and also some cinnamon to the topping. Can't have too much cinnamon! My husband LOVED it.

This recipe reminds me of the Pampered Chef apple crisp recipe that uses a yellow cake mix.  I really like this...very sweet, not dry like crisp recipes can be.  Because of some food intolerances, I used Bob's Red Mill all purpose GF mix instead of the regular flour.  I've made twice and will no doubt make again!

OMG!!! Soooo Good! I could just eat the topping raw..that's how good it is. The house smells wonderful and it is a really easy recipe. I doubled the batch so I could send some to family but I took everyone else's suggestions and used brown and white sugar combined.

Overall, it was pretty good.  I used wheat flour instead of white and applesauce instead of butter.  The top ended up being good, but could have been a little crispier.  I would also use a little less water or maybe cut the apples a little bit thicker the next time I used the recipe because the apples ended up being a little mushy.  I'll def. use this recipe again with a few alterations.  Thanks!

This recipe is AMAZING!  I LOVED it!  So did my husband and son!  Only difference - next time I will make sure we have some vanilla ice cream in the house to serve it with!  :)  Thanks for sharing!

Really good.  Just went apple picking, and this is what the hubby wanted first.  Used Empire apples by mistake.  (got them for sauce) Loved how the topping was crispy, just like I wanted it to be! Used all white sugar and no added vanilla.  Did add a dash of salt cuz I like the tang it gives. Thanks-enjoy!

I'd give this a 5 for simplicity and taste but I had to make a few minor changes, so it's a 4.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the sugar & butter mixture.  The only thing I'd chnage for next time is I'd use l/3 cup water instead of 1/2 cup.  The apples turned out a little too mushy.

This recipe is to die for.  We love this.  I have made this recipe twice and have made double the recipe.  The only issue I see with this recipe is the temp vs time.  On 350 it take 1hr 15min to cook.

a topping without oats was a nice change.  Using very tart apples for this was good. I liked the flavor contrast between the filling and the topping.

This is the easiest most delicious apple crisp I have ever had=) The topping was very crispy just like it should be.  I did make a small adjustment as suggested previously, which was I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture. I add vanilla to everything baked.  Thanks for a really really easy and delicious recipe! A keeper for sure.  Will try this with peaches next;}

I had friends coming for dinner and wanted a fall-ish recipe that was easy.  This was it!  While we ate dinner, it baked and made the whole house smell good.  I also substituted 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  Haagen Dazs makes a Brown Sugar ice cream that's yummy served with this dessert!

Only changes made were to crumble a few tablespoons of brown sugar on top of the crust and to bake for 45 minutes.

My family and my co-workers loved this recipe.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar as suggested.  I also sprinkled in some cinnamon into the topping mix.  Should bake, at least, 45-50 minutes as suggested.

This was really scrumptious!!!  I will definitely make this again. The only changes I made was to add cinnamon directly to the apples and coat - in addition to the crust. I also added 1/2 c. whole grain oatmeal to the topping.

Made this last night for the family, served with Vanilla Ice Cream, WOW!  I did use brown sugar and white sugar, and also had to add a little more flour.  Yummy!  It was a little soggy the next day but I warmed it up in the microwave, and it was still really good!!

I think I mixed my topping too much and it turned into more of a dough texture. Still tasted great though! Definitly eat on the first day or it turns to mush.

I have made this recipe several times..so easy and really tasty.  It keeps in the fridge and can be reheated the next day if there's any left! Awesome with vanilla ice cream.  I used 5 granny smiths and instead of 1 c sugar :  1/2 c white, and 1/2 cup brown.

This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I am just a beginner when it comes to cooking but I was able to make this and it turned out nice. The only thing I didnt like was the crumbles on top that are too sweet for my taste.
Update Feb. 2010. Since my first review I jhave started making it with JUST brown sugar, no white and I think it is alot better. Not so sweet.

This was very good right out of the oven.  A little sweet (even with Granny Smith apples), but yummy.  Make sure you eat it all right away, because it gets soggy by the next day.

I added a little vanilla, and some extra cinammon sugar because i can't get enough of that stuff. I also cut the reg sugar in half and relaced half of it with brown sugar and i think it turned out better. It tasted amazing with vanilla ice cream and still warm...i would have given it 5 stars but when i put the leftovers in the fridge and reheated it it was no longer crispy on top...but pretty mushy but otherwise i loved it! Thank You!

I really liked this recipe, which was extremely easy to make.  The only recommendation I would make is to add about 1/8 teaspoon of salt to the crisp to give it a little more dimension.

This was delicious and easy!  My topping was too moist to crumble so I had to add more flour to get the right consistancy.  Otherwise, it was perfect.

Loved it. Very simple, quick to prepare, and satisfies that "need something sweet" moment.

This is delicious! I only give it 4 stars because my husband says he likes the topping to be a bit crisper (I did bake it for 50 mins). I used McIntosh apples, as they are the only apples I will buy. I also added cinnamon to the topping. That's the only thing I changed outside of the bake time. I served it with a little bit of evaporated milk poured on top. We're moving in a few days, and this was a perfect way to use up the rest of our apples. :)

I *have* to put this note in here.  The only things I measured were the water and the butter.  I also didn't cream anything.  The butter I melted in a measuring cup for 30 seconds in the microwave.  I was in a hurry and threw everything in the pyrex dish without reading properly, didn't even mix it completely, and it turned out just perfect.  No clumps of flour or anything ugly.  How's that for saving on the dishes?

Very good!  I was expecting the topping to be more crumbly, but it was still delicious.  I used 1/3 cup of granulated splenda rather than the sugar.  It was plenty sweet and did not have a "fake sugar" after taste.   I did sprinkle a little bit of brown sugar  on the top...  yum!

Excellent and easy to follow and prepare recipe!  I made it for the first time and it was great!  I am a newlywed/beginner cook and really enjoyed this, the prep time was very minimal and the taste, outstanding!  (I added a bit of vanilla flavoring as well).

This is sooo much better than the kind with oats and I would definately prefer this to apple pie. It is like amazing apple pie but fresher tasting and incredibly easy to make. I too used half brown, half white sugar.

This was delicious! My roommate and I made it last night. She used whole-wheat flour, and it turned out fine. We did not change the sugar, but in the future, I think I'll do 1/2 brown and 1/2 white, or even a bit more brown sugar. She put some granola on top, which I could take or leave it. Very great recipe!

Although I thought it was delicious, I have tasted other apple crisps that are slightly better.  It's a good basic recipe though.

Loved this dish!  It was easy and delicious.  I followed the directions exactly, with exception to adding a couple of squirts of lemon juice to the water.  Granny Smith apples work very well, but a mix of those and McIntosh apples get a tasty result also.  Perfect when needing a quick dessert using items already in your kitchen or for a way to finish up the apples in the fruit bowl before they go bad.  Everyone loved this dessert!

Hella Good!  As a matter of fact,the best apple crisp I ever made. I thought it would not taste the same as when I use oatmeal for the topping. I was pleased that it was nice and crispy. I couldn't tell the difference.

I followed the advice to use brown sugar.  I used about 3/4 cup of brown sugar, skipped the white sugar and it was plenty sweet.  The mixture wasn't crumbly but it was delicious.  I threw some oats on top just to add texture.  It came out excellent.  Hubby polished off half the pan.  This one is a keeper!

I just now tried this recipe and it is awesome. The only thing i did different was that i used a little cinnamon than it said. I did have to bake it for 50 minutes also, and it turned out wonderful, i will definately make this again.

FINALLY an apple crisp recipe that didn't flop! Normally I can cook anything but have never had an apple crisp that came out right until NOW. The only change I made was adding more cinnamon and using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Will make again and again.

Great recipe!  Super easy but very good.  I didn't quite have the timing right... I'm going to have to play with that next time, it wound up taking about 20 minutes more than the recipe called for.

I used four large unpeeled apples and made this in a 13x9 inch pan.  I increased the topping by a half though I think it would have been better if I'd doubled it.  I like the traditional crisp with oatmeal better, so I probably won't make this again.  It's still good though.

Top notch.  I like a softer texture on my apples, so I cooked for longer at a bit lower temperature.  Even added in a few oats for texture.  Will make again when I have apples on the downhill side of good in my fridge.

I was skeptical in trying this as I am so used to homemade apple crisp with the oats topping.  I'm glad I did, it's delicious!  I drizzled honey over the apples, as well as put about 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract in the topping.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon in the topping as well.  The reason I am giving this 4 stars is because it was really runny; next time I make this I will only put about half the amount of water, if any at all.  I will definately make this again!  Thanks for awesome recipe! :)

This is great!  I'm eating some right now and I love it!  I used 5 medium granny smith apples, did 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and baked it 50 minutes until the top was golden brown.  So yummy! I've been searching for a great no-oat Apple Crisp and this is it!  Thanks!

This was very tasty considering how easy it was to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I saved time by not peeling the apples.  I served it with vanilla ice cream for a simple dessert.

Yum, yum, yum!  My boyfriend is sitting here with a huge smile on his face while he eats this... I also did half and half regular sugar and brown sugar and it's perfect!  I usually do not like apple desserts, but I tried this and really liked it!  So easy too; will definitely use this for company and family.

This is the first time I have ever made apple crisp.  I used a jar of apples my Grandma gave us the other day and just drained them very well.  It was really quick and easy to make.  We liked it alot.

This was a super easy recipe, and I just LOVE super easy!  The only change that I made was that I baked it in a 13x9 baking dish and baked it for 1 hour on 400'.  I also added a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top and it was really good!  My kids don't eat red apples, so I used those to make this and they loved it!  I am not a huge fan of apples, but will be making this again!  Rave reviews from the fam which is always a plus in my book!

Great Recipe! i find it to be a bit more juicy than I'd like and I wish i wouldve peeled the apples-the skin gets quite annoying, thus the 4 stars. Other than that, it was awesome! I added the brown sugar on top as suggested by other users- Simply Amazing! edit 10/12/09: reduced water and peeled apples-it is now perfect!

Wow, this is good!  I made a "test" batch for 2, following the directions but using a little less water and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  The consistency was perfect, and the taste unbeatable!  I will be making a double batch for my dinner party this week!

Just the very same recipe I used to make but had lost the measurements for it. Warm or room temperature, this crisp will tickle your tastebuds with the chewy topping and the tender apples.  I used Granny Smith apples, but other's are just as well. Enjoy.

This was easy, and great!  The only thing I changed was the oven temp - I cooked it at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.

This is hands down the best apple crisp I have ever eaten.  I used a mix of pink lady and golden delicious apples.  Nebraska City is the home of Arbor Day which translates to lots of apples readily available this time of year.  I did change the sugar, like some of the other suggestions to 1/2 brown sugar.  Its not too sweet, but just sweet enough.  It's a keeper!!!

I'm making this recipe for the second time in two weeks. It is soooo good. I took others advice and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. I also cut down on the total amount of sugar. Overall a simple wonderful yummy recipe. Thank you :-)

This was GREAT!!!  I'm living in Cape Verde, Africa with the Peace Corps so we don't have lots of "fancy" ingredients like oats and brown sugar.  I wanted to make our language teachers an American meal and made this for dessert because of the simplicity.  It was wonderful.  The only reason I took away one star is because it was a little too sweet, so cut down on the sugar a little.  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe says and it was really really good; next time less sugar.

Just made this and in a word it is DEEELISHHHH!!!!!  I used Macintosh and gala apples and mixed them with some cinnamon, vanilla, and lemon juice.  I also decreased the water to 1/4 cup and it was fine.  I made the topping in the food processor using earth balance shortening, 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar, and added cinnamon.  I just can't stop eating it and it is so easy. I would love to try this with a caramel sauce on top.

My Family LOVES this recipe. I have made it 3 times in 2 weeks and everytime I have used different apples. I did mix about 2 tablespoons brown sugar to the water to make it a little sweeter. I also raised the temp to 400. This one's a keeper!!

GREAT RECIPE!!!!   Quick and easy.  I did the 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and added cinnamon to the topping in addition to sprinkling it on top of the apples.  I also cooked at the higher temperature.  My son loved it!  So I just got done making it again.

This is the perfect crisp without oatmeal! I used fresh pears from our tree instead of apples, and I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all white sugar. Perfect!!!!!

This was delicious! I upped the temp in the oven to 375 for 15 extra minutes which helped turn the topping golden brown. Otherwise it would have taken much longer than recipe stated to get the top brown.

Excellent recipe!!! Just a reminder for new bakers (which I am :). Bake uncovered!!! I covered for all but ten min and it did  not get crispy on top, but still tasted great! I also used half sugar and half brown sugar.

I did not like this recipe.  I thought the topping was to bland.  If it were'nt for the cinnamon apples this would have been awful. I used 1/2 sugar and used brown sugar. I dont think I will be making this again.

It was ridiculous for a recipe this simple to taste so good!  I did change the white sugar to half brown and it was a little too sweet.  So I'll decrease the amount of sugar.  Granny Smith apples would probably make a difference too!  Overall, this is a good simple recipe that's easy to tweak to one's own individual liking.

I absolutely love apple crisp; however, this recipe lacked something.  Was not my favorite for sure!  Was disappointed for sure.  The crust turned out nicely -the filling is what just didn't have the flavor I was looking for.

Thanks for a yummy recipe Carrie! My family loved this. The only changes I made was to cut the sugar down to 2/3 c. and add another tsp of cinnamon.  I used fresh picked apples of varying sweetness. I added the water but wound up getting applesauce crisp so I think next time I will leave it out or just use a few teaspoons.  I served it with vanilla sauce and boy was it delicious. Still gets 5 stars for ease of baking and taste!

This is a very good recipe and so simple.  I did add vanilla and I threw in some oats for texture.  I used all granny smith but I think you can use sweeter apples or a mix because some of my guests still thought it was a little  tart but overall really liked it.

Run the apples through the food processor on slice, apply topping and bake.  Simple and tasty.  Like others, I agree with adding spices to the apples themselves instead of just the topping.

Thanks but no thanks.  Tasted O.K. but I'll keep looking for a good apple crisp.  Cooking time was much longer than 40 minutes and the top never really did get brown.  Apples were soggy.

What an easy, wonderful recipe!!  I took the recipe times 1.5 and used a 9x13 pan.  Then I put some instant oatmeal in the topping in place of some of the flour. My family LOVED IT!!  It was great!!

quick and easy to make.  tastes great!  even my husband who doesn't like sweets or desserts loved this apple crisp.  i followed other reviewers suggestions and baked it for 40 minutes.  it came out real crispy! i love the fact that this recipe does not use oats, which i don't usually have in my pantry.

Very easy. Only had two gala apples but that was plenty. I used margarine instead of butter so my topping was more like paste at first but cooked up perfectly. It was pretty sweet but delicious with ice cream. Also, you do have to cook it much longer. I set timer for 30 and then just left it in the oven and kept an eye on it until it was brown. Rave reviews though. Four ppl went through the whole pan in one sitting.

This is good apple crisp.  I have to make a double batch or else I am usually the one who doesn't get any.  It is also great served with vanilla ice cream.

The errors with this recipe were mine. I added too much water after doubling the recipe. My bf who is a pastry chef agreed that the apples already have enough water in them to suffice. (he wasn't home when I made the dish) Other than that I followed the suggestions with the brown and white sugar and added the vanilla to the flour mix. Although it was a little runny for the water it is a great dish :)

Great recipe!  But I made a few changes.  I didn't measure the amount of apples.  I just cut up 3 fuji and 2 granny smith apples into thin slices, sprinkled them with sugar and cinnamon (didn't measure) and stirred until even coated.  Also added a couple of dashes of nutmeg to give it a little more depth, sprinkled the apples with water and put it into a glass dish and chopped a small amount of butter on top of it to give the apples more flavor.  Then I used the correct measurements for the topping, BUT I added about a palmful of quick cooking oats to make the topping go a little further and I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Cooked it for about 50 minutes until the topping looked done and crispy enough and it turned out great!  My husband, 4, 3 and 1 year old loved it!  I think using the combination of sweeter apples along with more the more bitter granny smith apples worked well.  Next time I will cut the slices a little thicker then cut each slice in half to make chunks and also might add 1tsp of vanilla extract to the topping.

I added some salt and honey bunches of oats cereal to the topping for texture, which made the dish. I had to leave it in the oven for about 15 extra minutes and butter/flour/sugar mixture still never got really golden brown, but it's still delicious.  I'm glad I have the crunch of the cereal though - I think I would miss it otherwise.

Super easy and yummy!  I made it quickly, even when I had kids running around the house.

It was watery on the bottom, and crunchy on top.
But when we mix it all together in your bowl, and it's an awesome sauce!

YUMMY!

How I changed it: 
I added just a tad of nugmeg to the apples.
I also split the sugar with half brown and half white.
I also put in a splash of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon in the topping.

I love it.  I know I'll make it again when I'm having people over because it's so easy to make, and there is not much clean up either.

Oh, I cooked it in my toaster oven and it browned in the proper amount of time, I didn't need to cook it longer at all.

great base! Here are the changes that I made to this recipe. I only had red delicious apples so I tossed them with brown sugar and 3 tbs lemon juice, doubled the reicipe and used a portion of the topping as a dough bottom. I only had margerine so I had to use way more flour to get it to crumble. I used whipping cream in place of the water for a creamier texture. AWSOME with those changes.

Yum! This is delicious, and so easy to make. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. I did not double the water (out of fear), but I think it would have been alright if I did. This was very tasty, and the topping was nice and crumbly.

Fantastic recipe!  Very quick and easy to make.  The only thing that I added was some cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour/sugar/butter topping.  Yum yum, soooo good.  Great with splenda instead of sugar too!!!  I would definately recommend this to a friend.

This recipe was WONDERFUL!!!! And very easy.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but I had to bake it for over an hour to get the top to brown, and finally said "da heck wit it" and thru it under the broiler for 30 seconds.  Next time I think I'll bake at 425 (like I do my apple pie).. But it was absolutely awesome.  Brought some to work for my friend, and she immediately asked for the recipe!! Thank you so much for sharing!!!!!

I used cinammon and nutmeg instead of just cinammon and some brown sugar as well. This came out too oily for me, also like many others, I had to put this back in the oven for an extra 20 minutes or so as it was on the soggy side. If I try this again I would use less butter/sugar. Or maybe I will just invest in some rolled oats and try a rolled oats apple crisp recipe.

I made two batches of the apple crisp (I ended up buying 8 decently sized granny smith apples). I sprinkled the cinnamon on top of the apples, and on top of the sugar/butter/flour mixture. I used half brown sugar as well. I followed the recipe ingredient amounts perfectly, however it was a dough and not crumbled. Baked for 35 minutes approx. in 2 8x8 pie dishes. Turned out wonderful! I'm not making it for me, but for my fiance's family tonight. I tried a little nibble, it was good! I'm a health nut so it was too much sugar for me, but I know everyone would appreciate this recipe =]

This was really good and we will make it again.  I did bake it for 50 minutes as others suggested and the apples turned to applesauce.  They did not keep their form at all.  I think next time I will only bake it the suggested time.  Also I mixed the flour, butter and sugar too long, it was a dough instead of crumbs, but it still turned out really good.  My husband loved the "crust."  I used granny smith apples that I had on hand.

umm i don't know what everyone else is doing to make this apple crisp taste good but whne i followed these directions step by step it came out soooo bad
it was all water on the bottom when finished the apples were practically floating in it.
I baked it an extra 20 min and still the crumble on top was still doughy
i could only eat alittle cause it was way way way to sweet.
so for all looking for a apple crisp recipe. this is not for you unless you wanna eat a watery, sugary, doughy, mess.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. The recipe is very sweet which I should have known with the recipe calling for sugar and butter as the topping. I would suggest trying a recipe with oats or flour for a thicker crust.

Wow! Fantastic and so easy to make! the only note is mine took ~1 hr to bake instead of 30-40 min... but very very good. Would definitely make it again. I used fuji apples.

Very yummy!  My guests asked for seconds. I had a problem with cooking time, which I think may have been because I'm in high altitude (6500 ft).  I left it in for a good 1 hr 15 m, and it could've stayed in longer.  It may also be because I used Smart Balance instead of butter.  I ended up sprinkling extra flour and brown sugar on top for crunch.  I would omit the water next time.  Very good and simple though, will make again.

Yum! I used skim milk instead of water, apple pie spice and added a little vanilla extract. Also used 1/2 brown sugar as other reviewers suggested.

This was a great recipe for apple crisp and a nice change from the usual oat version.  My mother in law announced it was much better than the oat crisp and then later had to reassure her husband she still liked his  but preferred this one.  The changes I made were to cut my butter into my flour and sugar to keep it dry and not doughy.  I also used some brown but mostly white sugar.  I did cook mine a bit longer, just until it was golden brown on top.

This was quite good. In my version, I added some dark rum, a little less water, more cinnamon, and a handful of raisins. Topped it with some rum raisin ice cream. If using tart apples or not topping with ice cream, you might want to add some sugar to the apple mixture. Will definitely make again.

Wow, if I could rate this higher than a 5 star I would. I started mixing the flower into it and thought it was going to be to dry to pour on top but it worked awesome, I would recommend this to everyone. It is now one of my favorite recipes, thanks for sharing it.

I doubled this recipe and made it in a deep 9x13 pan. I used more cinnamon and added a dash of vanilla to the filling as well. It disappered so fast I only got a teeny weeny little taste. I'm going to use different apples the next time though. I did not care for the tartness of the Granny Smith apples.

I'm also going to try this with peaches  instead of apples, and I'll bet cherries would be a treat too.

Flavor was great, although it did remind me of pie filling.  The texture was WAY off, not crispy at all.  I even tried broiling it and still it was more of a thick paste.

I think I did something wrong with this one.  The topping was never really a crumbly texture that I could "sprinkle" on the top.  I think it was something I did.  Anyway, I went with it and decided to spread it on the top, sort of like a dough... I omitted the cinnamon and instead tossed my apples with maple syrup flavoring and superfine sugar.  I used just a spoonful of water since I read a lot of reviews that suggested cutting the water.  The taste of the apples was great, and even though the top didn't turn out as it probably should have, it still had a great buttery sweet flavor.  Will try this again perhaps just to see if I can get the top right.

I teach a cooking class and was looking for inexpensive deserts.  I liked that the ingredients were simple and didn't contain the usual oatmeal that sometimes leaves a gritty feel.  This was a favorite of the students and the staff!  Kudos!

Fantastic. And so easy! The longest part was pealing/slicing the apples. I cut the apples into bit size pieces because I was giving this to my small children who have trouble with bigger pieces. I also followed one of the suggestions to use half brown sugar and half white sugar. One other suggestion that worked great for me was to broil for the last 5 minutes. I have a top broiler and the flame really crisped up the top. Kids loved it with ice cream!

I made this tonight and it was really delicious! It was easy too. I was looking for something to make with my apples that I had in the fridge and this popped up. I do agree with a few others though that 1/2 cup is just too much water but it also depends on the type of apples you use. I didn't use so much water and it still had lots of liquid. But it went GREAT with vanilla ice cream. And always serve warm, cold is ok but its better warm. ;-)

Very, very easy and absolutely delicious. There's really no way to mess this up, since anything containing a cup of sugar and an entire stick of butter is going to turn out yummy no matter what.

Not the best apple crisp I've ever had, but it wasn't too bad.  I'm probably not going to make this one again, though.  There was way too much liquid and it had too much sugar for my taste (I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar).
EDIT:  I may have to make it again whether I liked it or not, my husband complimented me at least three times on it.  It goes to show, doesn't it?

Delicious! On the advice of others I also did 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I sprinkled the cinnamon on top of the mixture not the apples and cooked 10 minutes longer.  Used granny smith apples.  It was delicious the entire family enjoyed it!

It wasn't the best apple crisp ever but it was good. I would definitely omit the water altogether. I used half of what the recipe called for and I think it would've been better without any at all. But other than it being to liquidy it was good.

Not what I thought it would be. I think it was the water that made it not work well for me. Tasted good over ice cream, but not a stand alone kind of dessert.

This was good, but nothing spectacular.  I thought it was a little to sweet.

I followed the advice of some of the others- reducing the water & going 1/2 and 1/2 w/ brown sugar and white sugar.  Yum!

The bottom was filled with the water that was supposed to be poured earlier, so next time I'll put less water. Also, my parents complained about excess sugar, so next time I might put less for their sake, although I liked the sugar content. 


Here are some things I did:

1. I added extra cinnamon, so that it would be "tasteable" so to say.
2. Since I'm a slow apple cutter, I put out a bowl of water so that the apples I already cut wouldn't brown while I was cutting them.

Overall, great.

Came out great. I am not big on baking so this was a easy recipe. Apples were very tender and crisp was delicious. I did do what some other suggested and did more half and half for the brown sugar and the white sugar.

This was ok...Granted, my friend and I screwed up the topping. She kept blending the topping until it was creamy and I wasn't paying attention. But still, the apples underneath were a little too tart for me. I think I'd prefer them with just a little sugar.

I didn't follow this recipe exact but I eyeballed the ingriedients according to the amount of apples I used.  I also used half white sugar and half brown.  I served it with vanilla frozen yogurt and it was awesome!  It may have been to sweet if I hadn't served the yogurt with it but all in all it was very easy and I will definately be making this again!

Delicious! I craved apple pie, but I'm a college student living with a student's pantry! I used the recipe as a general guideline as I only had 1 apple in the house, but it still turned out great!!! I can see why people who followed it exactly gave it such high ratings too! Topped with a piece of vienetta (since I dont have vanilla ice cream) I am having an AWESOME study break!!

This one didn't turn out that great for me. It was very dry even though I add the water that it called for. The "crisp" had a good flavor. I'll try it again to see if I didn't do something wrong the first time.

We really liked this recipe for several reasons.  1) It was not soggy like Apple Crisp recipes w/ oats tend to be, 2) it was super easy, and 3) it was sweet.  I used half light brown sugar and half white sugar and I added extra cinnamon to the topping.

I made this in a 9x12 dish with 3# (9 cups) Macintosh apples.  Used 1/4 cup apple cider, 1 cup each white/brown sugar.  The taste was excellent, but after 40 minutes it wasn't browned yet, so I left it in another 10 minutes.  As a result, the apples were overcooked.  Next time I'll bake 30 minutes at 350, then top broil till browned.  Otherwise, I would've given this recipe 5 stars in the 'simple recipe' category.

This turned out wonderful.  I did make some changes based on other reviews.  I used 5 medium Jonagold apples and peeled them.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I used NO WATER at all and low fat margerine.  I will use a bit less sugar in the mixture next time, as it was a bit sweet.  I did bake it for 50 minutes, and it might have even needed to go a bit longer, but I could not wait!  Warm out of the oven I threw on a scoop of vanilla ice cream and got rave reviews.  A keeper for sure!

This one turned out great. Hubby loved it. I substituted 1/3 cup of orange juice for the water and decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup. Baked it 15 minutes longer and it turned out nice and crisp. I used Granny Smith apples. Will definitely make this one againg ... very yummy. Thanks!

Yummy! I mixed the cinnamon in with the topping, and also used brown & granulated sugars. I used the 1/2 cup water & it wasn't runny. I wonder if the amount of water needed depends on the type of apples used? I used Spartan, as that is what I had.

For the amount of time it takes to make this dish, it is tasty, but not crisp.  Will try mixing the sugars as others have suggested for more flavor.  However, I served it with cinnamon ice cream and everyone cleaned their plate!

I was excited to make this since most of the reviews were so great. I did use 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c brown as suggested.  This turned out to be one huge GLOPPY SOGGY mess. The taste was good but the texture was horrible. There was nothing 'crisp' about it. I was dissapointed and my children wouldnt eat it because of the "look"

So yummy!  I love that this recipe doesn't use oats.  Based on other reviews I used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar and it comes out perfect every time!

This is the best apple crisp we have ever had.  It has the perfect flavor and texture.  I do cut back on the butter a little and add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and do 1/2 cup white sugas and 1/2 cup brown sugar as others have suggested.

This recipe tasted good, but didn't quite turn out. In light of the other reviews that said it turned out watery, I used only under a 1/4 cup of water, but it still was an "apple mess". The topping turned out fine, but I think I would double the amount for sure. I think I would give this another shot, maybe this time with apple pie filling, (no water) and doubling the topping crust.

My whole family loves this recipe. I can barely get it out of the oven before fingers are going into it. I thought it came out a bit watery, but I am using ceramic baking dishes, so I reduced the water and it was perfect for us. I made it for Thanksgiving and even my diabetic aunt can have some if she wants! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a very easy recipe but WAY too sweet.  The amount of white sugar should be halved - it is not necessary to have that much sugar in this recipe.  You can't even taste the apple because it is too sweet.  I will try another recipe other than this one.

I followed the recipe and the topping didnt come out crumbly, it was like batter. So it was kind of hard to sprinkle it on top of the apples. It made a mess. What did I do wrong? Or maybe I am more picky than others.

Wonderful recipe!  I made it exactly as written and it turned out great.  I did end up cooking it for about 45 minutes and could have baked it even longer.  The top was very crunchy and the apples super soft.  My husband and I ate the rest of it later on that day and even when I warmed it up in the microwave the topping stayed crunchy.  I will definitely be making it again -- maybe even today!

I made this with the after school jr. high kids. Perfect, and they gobbled up their crisp with ice cream. Next time we will decrease the sugar to 2/3 C. One group used 8x8 and the other a pyrex bowl-wouldn't know they were the same recipe. The 8x8 was a sauce and the bowl was crisp as the topping stayed on top. I used Jonathan apples from home. They all want a copy of the recipe to keep.

I followed the suggestions to use half brown sugar and added cinnamon to topping but was not impressed.  There seemed to be a lot of extra water and the apples didn't seem to have great texture or flavor-I used granny smith.

I'll start by saying that this apple crisp was tasty. However, my Granny Smith apples turned to complete mush, and because the apples weren't peeled, the inside was like warm apple puree full of floating apple skins- not very appealing. But I do think this recipe has potential.  When I make it again, I will only cook it for 20 minutes or so, then pop it under the broiler so the crust gets nice and brown.  And I will definately peel the apples next time around.  I think with adjustments this recipe can be really good because the taste was excellent.

This is an excellent recipe....I tried another apple crisp on this website and it wasn't nearly as good as this. However...I did make a few changes, I added brown sugar and apple spice to the apple mixture and cinnamon in the dough.  It made the house smell wonderful.  I can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving!!

This recipe was really good! I used half brown sugar and half regular sugar, I added vanilla, and I put in some pumpkin pie spice because it had nutmeg in it... I also used plums instead of apples. It was SO delicious and my boyfriend went crazy over it and told him I am a good cook. I took the credit even though I got the recipe from you! Thanks for sharing it!

I really like how the crisp topping came out (don't care for the oatmeal) however this was WAY too sweet for me.  I'd cut back on the sugar by half, it'll still be plenty sweet but you can taste the fruit more.

This was really good. I was trying to make a recipe with less sugar so I used splenda which was fine.  I then added a packet of sweet and low brown sugar which had a pretty strong aftertaste.

Good recipe, the first time I made this it turned out doughy..I gave it another chance and used another persons suggestion to crumble the butter, flour and sugar on top then put under the broiler and it turned out excellent. Best if served with vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe.  I rate 5 stars when I don't have to keep looking for a new recipe.  This is definitely a 5 star.  You can adjust this recipe however you like.  We subtracted a little sugar overall, but heated up a big tablespoon of brown sugar in the water we poured over the fresh little granny smiths we used (they were tart and wonderful!) Thanks for a good reliable recipe.

While the end result *did* have a wonderful taste and texture it took much longer to bake than the recipe stated and it did not brown for me on either attempt.  For an easy treat for the family at home it's a good choice.

This dessert was delicious and easy to make with ingredients in the house.
