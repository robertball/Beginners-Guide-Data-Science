These were really good. One important tip to make these spur of the moment: I always keep a stock of chickpeas that I've soak, drained, and then frozen (they freeze well in ziplock bags for months). I used these chickpeas and simply thawed them and let them drain out very well before adding them to the food processor. That work perfectly.
I fried mine in a pan. I think, if I'd tested the temp of the oil in the pan or deep fried them they might have been better, but they were very good. I'll do them again!

Yes!!! An excellent recipe that uses rehydrated dried chickpeas instead of cooked and canned ones. The flavor is better Chef John's way.  The trick is to keep the moisture at a minimum so that you can form the felafel balls and they'll hold their shape. Propper oil temperature is a must. Start at 400F because the temp drops when you add the felafel. I use a long handled slotted spoon to carefully place the felafel in the frying pan. You definitely want to avoid splatter.  To make the sandwiches, I dice cukes, tomato, onion and add these to the felafel.  Plain yogurt with chopped cilantro or a little oregano makes a great topping. Low cal but very filling.

Absolutely delicious! I pretty much stuck to the recipe. I did add a tiny bit more flour to my mixture & I pan fried in veggie oil. In my opinion you can't use canned chickpeas, the mixture would be too moist & the falafel would fall apart in the oil while frying. Please use dry beans!

I made these, following the recipe exactly. Turned out great...
To you guys using canned beans or altering the recipe and then giving poor reviews, shame on you. If you follow the directions to a T, it will turn out great!

This was so, so good!!!!  For anyone who has neither a deep fryer nor a thermometer appropriate for measuring the temperature of the oil, this might be helpful to know: on my gas stove, a tiny bit hotter than medium heat was perfect.  (The first couple fried up too dark because I had the heat too high.  There was a little bit of a charred taste, but we still ate them--that's how good this recipe is!)  Hope that helps someone else!

My first attempt at falafel balls and they turned out wonderfully! I didn't have any flat-leafed parsley, so I used the bushier kind available at my supermarket. I also omitted the corriander because I didn't have any. I have done the recipe twice now. Once I let the ingredients sit for 2 hours for them to combine and the second time, I made it straight away. I honestly couldn't note too much difference in taste. Also, I had a heart breaking moment when my falafel balls seem to be falling apart as I was forming them, but this was because I hadn't wet my hands. You MUST wet your hands! Once I did, it was a breeze. I deep fried my balls in vegetable oil in a little 7" wide sauce pan. Just 2-3 at a time. Served inside of a pita bread with cucumber and mint sauce and it was amazing! Even meat lovers will love this vegetarian dish! Five stars all the way!

You Can Use Canned Garbonzo (Chickpeas) in this recipe.  
Rinse canned beans, dry on paper towel for a bit, then put in 200* - 250* oven for a few minutes to dry out.  Let coast after turned off oven, till dry!
To get more of a lemon kick, I also process in some lemon rind
I always make small rounds and pan fry in my large cast iron skillet.  
Sometimes my mixture is a little dry, so I add 1/2 beaten egg so patties stick together.

The only change I made was to reduce the salt to 1 tsp. I also made patties instead of balls so I could serve the falafel in pitas. Yes, this takes some preparation, but to my mind it's worth it when the end product is restaurant quality and adds to my arsenal of simple, accessible vegetarian and vegan recipes :). Thank you, Chef John! I will definitely make again!

awesome flavor and super easy to make. the hardest part was finding dry chickpeas in my area of Ohio. once I had those it was smooth sailing. Delicious authentic flavor. for great cucumber sauce mix a 6oz plain yogurt with 1 Tbsp of mayo, plus half a diced peeled cucumber. Salt and pepper to taste and a dash of cumin and refrigerate.

Excellent recipe! Chef John is one of my personal heroes. Other posters saying not to used canned garbanzo beans are absolutely correct. I did and regretted it. They fell apart while frying. I have made this several times since and soaked my beans overnight like Chef suggested and it works beautifully. Thanks Chef John! You are awesome!!!

We thought they turned out even better than the local Mediterranean restraunt.  We are placing this on our go-to list.  Try the sauce too...delicious.

Fantastic! Loved the texture of these once cooked. The patty method was easy to do and they were crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. My falafel mix sat in the fridge for 2 days which probably improved the flavor. Might try these as veggie burgers. Dry beans all the way!

Used canned garbanzo beans, and the dough turned out a bit too wet. Didn't fall apart during frying, but didn't hold together as well as it should. I pan fried mine in vegetable oil for sandwiches.  Flavor was good but a bit salty, hence only four stars. Perhaps I misread the recipe or measured incorrectly. I will definitely try this again with some small tweaks. One of my favorite Mediterranean and vegetarian dishes. Thanks Chef John!

Update 10/2015:  Made these again. Forgot to prepare the dried beans, so used canned again. This time they did fall apart. Added a half teaspoon more flower and rolled the dough around on paper towels for a bit to soak up the moisture. They fried up just fine after that. Still a bit salty, though I used a half teaspoon less salt. Perhaps it has to with the canned beans.

A few tweets, but most importantly I made the flattened balls and put them on a cookie sheet and froze them so I could bake them 2-3 at a time at 400° for 20 minutes.  Excellent!

These are the best ever, followed the directions to the letter ....... So good ! I live with vegetarians so I am always looking for meatless meals. My 7yr old granddaughter has been raised vegetarian since birth. She absolutely loved these falafel, so full of protein. We are also a fan of chef John's lentil burgers. These are a must try !

These were really delicious! Even my meat-loving husband commented on how good they were and said we should have them again for dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, with about 3 hours of chilling time before forming patties, and I had no problems with the mixture staying together as I pan- fried them. They turned out perfectly crispy and went great with a simple tsatziki sauce in homemade pitas.

The taste was great but I used canned chickpeas which turned out very moist and crumbled in oil. I coated then with additional flour before frying, but was still crumbly. I didn't used salt or baking soda, and added a littler more cumin and a lot of flour. May coat them with breadcrumbs next time.

What fun!  I have searched for an easy falafel recipe previously to no avail.  Now here is Chef John with a perfect recipe - no surprise.  I made these babies per the recipe except I didn't have coriander.  Followed some reviewers' suggestions and wet my hands to shape, fried in 1/2" oil, and used a slotted spoon to gently place into the skillet.  However, I got my oil too hot and so the falafels were getting too crisp before the inside was done.  I got them out of the pan before they could burn,  microwaved them a minute, and that cooked the inside the rest of the way.  Next time I will know better how to manage the oil.  Served with a cucumber/sour cream sauce and pita.  Great, easy recipe, delicious!

I have made this recipe many times and it never disappoints. I do add an extra tablespoon of flour because mine seem to fall apart without it. Other than that I follow the recipe exactally. I highly recommended this recipe.

Made exactly as written and it turned out great. This recipe is now in regular rotation in my house. For even cooking, the mixture should be brought to room temperature before frying.

Wow! We really enjoyed these! I’ve always loved falafels, but never considered making them myself. I’m so glad I did. The uncooked balls are a bit delicate, so handle them gently. Once they’ve been frying for a minute, you’ll be able to bump them around. Starting with dried garbanzos is the way to go. Following this recipe exactly, the end product is just like those you get from your favorite falafel joint! I paired them up with some tzatziki sauce made from scratch and fresh tomatoes. My fryer is loaded with peanut oil so that’s what I used. These are very filling, so I might not make these again — until next week ??

I love falafel but had never tried making it myself.  This recipe is easy and all of the ingredients were staples in my pantry (except for the parsley). Since it was just for one, I halved the recipe but still had enough for 3 meals. I will definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe.  I had leftovers from the night before in case my daughter and friend didn't like it but to my surprise they loved it!  I made it in a fry pan in a patty style using 2 Tbsp of mix per patty.  Will definitely make again.

This was great. Made it 2 days in advance and fried in oil just before serving. Had to modify the tahini sauce— added water, lemon, vinegar, cumin, salt, cayenne

This was a Home-Run!  Turned out amazing. The hardest part was getting the dry garbanzo beans. I used an ice cream scooper to drop the mix in the oil ant turned it once with a long fork. Thanks will save for the future.

Challenging recipe but worth the effort. I have made this several times because you can depend on a better texture and flavor when you make them yourself. Great for guests.

Living in Houston there  is no shortage of places to get falafel.  But getting a really GOOD falafel is another issue.  This recipe is among the best I have had!!  Go Chef John!!

Wow! These were a great tasting, crispy, yet tender on the inside meal addition.   I must caution that I did have some difficulty locating the dried chick peas in my neck of the woods, but that was really the hardest part.   I doubled the batch and added more flour after an initial test of rolling them into balls.  They were a little too loose still, so I deep chilled them in the freezer before dropping them into the deep fryer.  After the chilling, I think that they held together well until they formed a nice crust to hold them together.  I mentioned I made a double batch, and then froze the uncooked leftovers for the future.  I think that they will do just fine in the deep fry from a frozen state.  Totally worth the effort.  We ate them all up. FOLLOW UP - Yes, I did indeed use the frozen ones about two weeks later, and they came out great.  It was an unexpected gathering and I was able to pull these and directly fry them up in an electric deep fryer and they turned out GREAT.  I impressed my guests and it was so easy to just reach in the freezer and have them on the table in a few minutes.

This recipe is pure perfection! I've tried making falafel in the past and something always went wrong: wrong texture, wrong spices, wrong ingredients that made the balls fall apart or stick to the pan. These little guys tasted just right with a little kick of cayenne and all the other stuff. My biggest fear when I started frying them was that they will stick because it looked like they would, but no, everything went well. I stuffed them into tortillas (it's a heresy, I know) with thinly shredded purple cabbage, pickles and greek yogurt and had a very happy  family.

Omg so good! I’ve tried a few recipes before and none have been this good!! Plus they worked well baked too!! I made a double batch, formed them, and froze them on a cookie sheet before packaging them up better.

This was fantastic. I followed Chef John's suggestion and used half parsley and half cilantro.  I'm currently eating low carb so the only  thing I did differently was use almond flour instead of of regular flour.  Just follow the directions exactly as written and please don't use can beans. Just don't.

My kids even ate it. Delicious. Made Chef John’s tahini sauce with it, which was the saving grace as far as the kids were concerned anyway. Followed recipe with exception of a heavy pinch of cayenne. Will def make again.

I couldnt get the same texture as John but in the end the falafels were just as good im sure. Keep up the recipes John. Thanks!  I give 4 stars because even if I followed the recipe, the texture wasnt there but hey it still did the thing, the patty were falling appart a bit. I used them to make a pizza style dish with a yoggurt/cucumber sauce, tomato, jalapeno, lettuce and green pepers on a nan bread.

Yum! I followed the recipe exactly but for the cooking portion I chose to pan fry in vegetable oil. The outside came out nice and crisp. Going to make more tomorrow but will double the recipe since I have a few cups of beans remaining:

This is an excellent falafel recipe!!! Reminds me of my favorite little falafel place in Philadelphia. I used fresh dry beans(old super dried out beans don’t rehydrate as well). I added 1 tablespoon of chopped dill, went slightly heavy on the amount of cumin and coriander, and did not add any wheat flour.For frying, I used a heavy, high sided 3 quart sauce pan and had no splatter. Fried the falafel 5 at a time. After dropping balls one at a time into oil, give them 20-30 seconds to form a crust before moving them around occasionally until nice and dark golden brown. If your oil smokes, it’s too hot! I kept my burner around medium- medium low heat, adjusting as needed. I didn’t watch the clock, but I think each batch took about 5-6 minutes to cook. Excellent!!!

Made it twice, it's really delish. The first time was more successful holding together in the fry pan then the 2nd attempt: we will keep trying to get that texture just right. Again: delicious!

My husband needs to eat gluten-free, and this is an easily convertible recipe (we just substituted cup-for-cup gluten-free flour for the all-purpose flour in this recipe, and it worked great). Very delicious and easy recipe! Be careful not to over-blend in the processor, or the mix can get too liquidy and difficult to form and drop into the hot oil.

They came out amazing, but I didn’t have baking soda and substituted a 1/4 cup of self-rising flour. I also couldn’t find Tahini sauce, so I used plain greek yogurt and seasoned it with the same ingredients as the falafel mix!

Tasty falafel! Great for lunches! Plus you can double the recipe and make an entire week's worth of lunches. I've had falafel before but never made it before and I'm not experienced with frying anything, but they turned out great!

No changes and I will make it again. I'll probably use a little more flour as they didn't bind together quite as well as I'd have liked.

This falafel was SO EASY!! It was also delicious. I followed the recipe exactly (including adding just a little more flour to help the dough form into balls). I was testing out this recipe to see if I want to serve it to my friends and I definitely will. I only had to deep fry mine for 4 minutes, otherwise they would have been overdone.

Oh Dear Heavens!!  Turned out absolutely perfect.  Crispy, moist, savory...it hit all the checkboxes.  I served mine with a revved up tzatziki  sauce, also made with Chef John's recipe.  I just added Tabasco sauce.  Absolutely love the stuff.

The first time it was extremely salty and inedible, but since I'd only fried a few balls from the first batch I made a 2nd batch without salt and mixed it with the remainder of the first batch. Then it was delicious, although I used dry parsley.

For the 3rd batch on the following week I used only 1/2 teaspoon of salt, fresh parsley as called for in the recipe, and chickpea flour instead of regular (wheat) flour. I also added a tablespoon of tapioca starch to hold it together. It was delicious.

These were great - moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside, good flavor. This recipe only made 8 falafel, though - enough for 4 people, not 6.

This recipe is excellent as is, but I found great results swapping rice flour in place of regular flour to make it gluten free and swapping the parsley for cilantro out of personal preference. Thanks, Chef John, for the great recipe!

First time making it and it was delicious! Loved the flavor.
The only problem was that they fell apart while frying, one almost dissolved completely. I took a chance with canned garbanzo beans (my bad) even after reading others that attempted it. 
I even tried to dry them out in a 350 deg. oven for 10 mins after breaking them up in the food processor, still wasn't enough.
Definitely will make again but to the "T" next time!

mixture was quite damp and difficult to fry, we don't have a deep fryer, but with the help of my wife we got it done. Sample was tasty and we'll see how our vegetarian daughter rates them! Made according to recipe.

I was nervous to make this for some reason, but Chef John always gives such thorough directions it ended up being easier than anticipated. Tasty! Served in a pita with hummus, lettuce/tomato. Next time I'll try the tahini sauce.

This is my first time reviewing a recipe and I am now because I was so happy with how these turned out.  They are exactly like the falafel from the Mediterranean restaurant I go to.  The directions were spot on and I'm excited to be able to make these at home.  My only change would be to half the salt next time.

I followed the directions, but I found the falafels to be rather undercooked and on the drier side. I let the beans soak for 24 hours and noted they were still a little hard to the touch, but since I didn't read anything in the reviews about it I proceeded to put them in the food processor. I waited for the oil to be hot enough as suggested by reviewers, but then I lowered the flame to avoid the outside being burnt with an undercooked inside. Couldn't finish my meal. The flavor was on point (I did add more salt than suggested along with a bit of Adobo seasoning for richer flavor). I'd love to read tips on how I can improve what I did.

I used 1/2 tsp salt.  I don't know what went wrong.  It disintegrated in the deep fryer.  I'm gluten intolerant so I used GF flour.  This was very tasty falafel so I'd like to bake it sometime.  I'd give it more stars but the big energy waste of preparing this for a party only to have it disintegrate in the deep fryer was a downer.  I pan fried the remaining dough over the next few days in olive oil and that was very good so I'll keep the recipe in my favorites.

In the essence of saving time, and because I forgot to soak the beans, we used 2 cans of garbanzos instead of fresh.  The falafel was delicious, with just the right amount of garlic and spices. The kids tore it UP!!!!

Raves!  My husband fashions himself  a Falafel Connoisseur.  He loved these.  I used the "quick soak" method for the beans and they were not quite tender enough. The dough seemed very dry and would not hold together so I added three Tbs. of greek yogurt and it came together perfectly. (I might add a touch every time.) Next time I will just let the beans soak for 24 hours.  The flavor was great. I used two cloves of garlic and baking powder (I read it wrong.)  Even with a extra bite/crunch from the beans they were great.  It came together quickly and I used my little fryer.  I would make the balls smaller..1 inch for 20-24.  We ended up cutting them in half to fit into the pita.  Raves and more raves for this recipe. Great with Tahina, Tzatiki, and Babaganoush.

This is the first Chef John recipe I have tried and did not care for. I can taste the basil and the lemon but that is it. I thought these were super bland.
