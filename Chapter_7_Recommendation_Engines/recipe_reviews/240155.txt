AWESOME!!!!!! Super spicy, a little sweet and a HUGE hit with my guys! I marinated mine for the full 24 hrs. My little guy suggested trying this with chicken wings, so I can't wait to try it like that. I did remove the skin from the chicken thighs, just to make it a bit healthier, and that worked wonderfully. It took about 45 mins. total for the chicken to be done. Hubby wants me to make a jar of the sauce for him to take to work, lol, that's how much he loved it! The recipe didn't specify what to do with the limes and cilantro, so I just assumed to put them on before serving. I also drizzled mine w/ a bit of honey to cut the heat a bit (I like spicy, but not too spicy)...it was delicious w/ that addition. This is a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Used pinot grigio for the wine and white sugar because I had run out of brown. And still really enjoyed this recipe. I added an extra 3/4 tablespoon of sugar though. I didn't have time to let it marinate for so long, so I put the chicken thighs in a baking dish, poured all the sauce in, let it marinate for 1/2 an hour & followed the same baking time as the recipe and just let it bake in the sauce. Turned out great. I will definitely make it again.

FABULOUS!!! This recipe is fabulous!  It is so easy and it tastes so good I’ve made it twice in the last four days… Second time so my daughter could bring some back to school with her and that we could have some sliced chicken over salad.

I followed the recipe's ingredient list but also added a couple smashed garlic cloves into the marinade. I used skinless, boneless thighs and grilled the meat rather than baked. I never did  figure out why cilantro was listed as an ingredient since it wasn't used...so don't bother buying it. I'd make this again in a heartbeat!

This is an interesting tasting recipe. I tasted the marinade after it simmered for a while and it tasted rather strange. Fortunately, the chicken came out tasting nothing like the cooked marinade...

I made this over the weekend and really liked the spice/sweetness of the dish.  Definitely a keeper.

Great flavor.  Marinated the chicken overnight and it was very tender, sweet and spicy.  Paired with rice and roasted vegetables.  Very easy and tasty meal.  Thank you for sharing. Will definitely be in our dinner rotation.

Made this last night. Everyone really liked it. Used some honey in the marinade, as another reviewer suggested.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious. I will definitely be making it again! It's spicy, but the brown sugar and soy sauce cut the sriracha spiciest down a bit. I paired it with Spanish rice and it made for an awesome combo. Thank you for posting!

Awesome recipe if you enjoy spicy food.  Tried it last night for the first time and will definitely make it again!  Was a little short on time so I only marinated the chicken about three hours before cooking, but is was full of flavor.  Thanks for posting this recipe monica69, great job!
