I am not a baker as much as a cook, I learn something new every time I bake. This time I learned don't use steel oats for baking. My mistake didn't matter the brownies where moist and rich with flavor. I drizzled some butterscotch over the top and was very happy with the results. 5 stars for the flavor, 5 stars for the ease of the recipe and a big 5 stars because for once I made a brownie I was proud of.
