This is by far the best frosting I have ever had!  I made it with butter and butter flavor Crisco and I used whole milk for a more creamy frosting.  I have never had so many compliments and it's so simple to make.  It's so versatile that I made a double batch and used part to frost a cake and then we frosted sugar cookies.  I do recommend making sure that you are beating it long enough so as to eliminate lumps of any kind and if your powdered sugar is lumpy, I would sift it before adding to the mixture.  All and all- a most excellent recipe!

I made the chocolate version that someone posted in their review, replaced one cup confectioner's sugar with one cup cocoa and increased milk 1/4 cup. It tastes awesome and the texture is great!  I worked at a bakery for 2 years and this is just like the frosting there, I am going to frost a cake tomorrow.

This is a simple but perfect, creamy, easily spreadable frosting that is dependable and just plain good.  And it pipes well for decorations too! I just used a tad less sugar than called for, and used half and half rather than milk, which were not major alterations.  Great frosting!

I know that a lot of reviews wrote that this tasted just like the kind they use in the stores. Somehow, though, I thought they meant the kind a bakery would use! That was NOT the case!! In fact it was the kind that a supermarket would use.

You should use this if and only if you like the cakes sold in supermarkets.

It wasn't necessarily that this frosting was bad it was just not what I had hoped for.

This is amazing.  Even Ruth Levy Beranbaum's "The Cake Bible" doesn't contain a frosting that rivals this recipe (I use her book as a guide for my cakes).  Kris, you are a saint!  I've searched and created many a frosting and this one you posted is the most brilliant.  What I love most about this frosting is its versitality.  I use butter instead of marg, and I only use 3.5 cups of powdered sugar since my people don't like it too sweet.  You can drip in more milk to create a fluffy effect or reduce the milk to make a thicker version.  

Thank you, Kris for posting a frosting that is a perfect compliment to cake.  You have changed the face of frosting in my household.  I was just about to give up on frosting all together.

This recipe is EASY and it's good. It needs NOTHING else. It makes a light, fluffy frosting that's perfect for icing a cake and for doing the decorations. It doesn't run down the side of the cake, or melt. It isn't sickly sweet. It doesn't taste too heavy. It's easy to work with, using a spatula or an icing sleave. It gets 5 stars from me, and those 5 stars are VERY well earned! This recipe is a keeper. THANK YOU KRIS!

When made with butter instead of margarine, this recipe gets 5 stars.  Wow!  The taste and texture are fabulous.  And yes, this really does taste like the kind of frosting on bakery cakes.  One hint.  If you have some, add about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of butter extract.  Purists might argue against it, but if you're looking for "bakery" taste, the butter extract will take it a step closer.  Also, I found that this recipe worked best with my KitchenAid.  I whipped the frosting for about 5 minutes.  Without the KitchenAid, I might not have had the patience.

Yesterday I made a birthday cake for my sister and this is by far the best frosting I've tried. I substituted butter instead of margarine,added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla butter & nut flavorings and added 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice ( add according to taste)  to mask the sweetness. And whipped the frosting with my KitchenAid for about 5 to 7 minutes. Perfect for frosting and decorating Cakes. Thanks Kris for this great recipe.

This recipe was great but I just had one problem b/c of the humidity the icing kept melting every 5 minutes. I used 4 oz. of cream cheese as a stablizer but it really did not help any. Any ideas that can help me I am new at the decorating?

I gave this only 4 stars b/c in my opinion butter cream should ONLY contain BUTTER, otherwise it would be called "Margarine and Shortening Frosting".    I used 1 c butter, and slowly mixed in the sugar.  I really like vanilla so I used 5 tsps.  The key to getting the right consistency with any icing is to only add enough milk to reach desired consistency not the WHOLE amount as listed in any recipe.  The amount of humidity in the air will affect your icing as sugar is hydroscopic (absorbs water).

Great frosting!  Smooth, easy to use for decorating.  I did not find it too sweet at all. I used butter instead of margarine for flavor. I used it to decorate my hubby's Birthday cake and he raved!  Will definately use again!

At the very last minute, I remembered my SIL is pregnant and the buttercream I usually use contains raw egg, so this was the first one I found in my frantic rush that did NOT contain raw egg.  I only had butter-flavored Crisco, so I used that and *real* butter instead of margarine.  This frosting spread well AND piped well for decoration.  Oh yeah, and it tasted great, too.  TY for a great eggless butter cream recipe!  EDIT:  People often ask me which butter cream frosting I prefer and I can never remember (I like all of them that I've tried), but THIS IS my favorite!  I live the combo of shortening (I use butter flavored Crisco) AND butter.  This is great tasting frosting, similar to DH canned frosting taste, but way better!  Another EDIT:  I almost never use exactly the same amount of 10X sugar; it depends on conditions and what I'm using it for, so don't be worried if you need a little more or a little less than what's called for (the same holds true for the milk, which I sometimes sub heavy cream for, as well)!

Great recipe for a quick EASY frosting.  I doubled it and piped it on 2 dozen cupcakes.   Perfect consistency.  It's also great to substitue the vanilla extract with almond extract.

I've been using this recipe for years.  This is really good on sugar cookies (cut-outs).  Everyone raves over the frosting and always asks for the recipe.  If you have a lot left over - it freezes very well.  I let it thaw in the refrigerator over night, then let it sit out for a few minutes prior to frosting, give it a good beat and it's ready to go.

I have quite a sweet tooth, and this icing was too sweet even for me.  If I was to make this again, I would probably follow the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the sugar. I also would use a  butter and shortening combination. The taste of the margerine takes away from the recipe.

This icing was PERFECT...this icing looks and tastes wonderful! I actually used 1 teas. vanilla and 1/2 teas. almond extract, which seems to give it a little extra flavor.  It was light and fluffy, but set very nicely after it had been spread. It is sweet, light, melt-in-your-mouth butter cream, but if not too heavy on the butter taste like many icings.  Definately a winner!!

And we got a winner!!!!  This stuff is great.  Its the easiest frosting I've ever made.  I used to use the boiled flour/milk type frosting from my grandmother but that is quite time consuming.  I was in a rush so threw the ingredients of this recipe into my KitchenAid mixer, creamed shortening/margarine on speed 4 for about five minutes with the flat beater.  Then, I changed over to the wire whisk, turned to speed 6 for 8 minutes or so and it turned out superb!  I only used 4 cups conf. sugar and a little less than 1/4 cup of milk.  With this adjustment, I had MORE than enough for a 9x13 inch red velvet cake.  This recipe is a keeper.  Can't believe I had overlooked it in the past.  This one won't disappoint.

The frosting turned out perfect, and frosted a 2-layer cake perfectly. However, I don't think it tasted any better than the stuff you buy from the store. I used 2 sticks of butter rather than shortening, because butter is healthier. I thought it tasted like sugar, butter, and vanilla. It was very sweet. Next time I might omit a cup of sugar and add a cup of cocoa to make chocolate frosting and lessen the sweetness a little. Overall, it was a good frosting, considering I had a hankering to bake a cake from scratch and needed a frosting I could whip up with ingredients I had in the house.

This is the exact same recipe that I have been using all my life.  This is my grandmother's recipe and I use it for cakes and cookies!  It is yummy!  For cookies I may use less milk (couple tablespoons up to a quarter cup) and for cakes I may use more (1/4 to half cup).  It all depends on the consistency of frosting that you want to use.  I have even added Hershey unsweetened cocoa powder to make chocolate frosting (1/2 cup) and was super chocolaty so I am thinking a 1/3 cup of cocoa powder next time .

I used butter for the margarine & butter flavor Crisco for the shortening. This frosting was soooo good. Funny thing is I really don't like buttercream frosting - Till Now. No more store bought frosting for me. Thanks for the great recipe!

This frosting is awesome!  Although I did have to follow the advice of others and cut the sugar in half.  Even with half the sugar this frosting was quite sweet.  But, the texture, consistency and flavor are outstanding.  Also keep in mind that if you cut the sugar way back it doesn't make nearly as much frosting.  I ended up making two batches to frost my three layer cake.  And like other reviewers I also feel the key to this frosting is beating it for 4 to 5 minutes.  This is how it gets such a wonderful fluffy consistency.  This recipe is a real winner!

Definitely a keeper. I did like most and used real butter and half&half. I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar and it turned out just fine.  Next time I will experiment with using different flavor extracts.

Fabulous recipe! It is just like mine that I have at home. I use almond extract in place of the vanilla and using whipping cream instead of the milk! 
I use this for all my birthday cakes! I recommend that you try it. I also use only 4 cups of icing sugar and butter instead of margarine!

All I could tast was the powder sugar. I added more vanilla and then some butter flavoring. Not what I was wanting.

Excellent recipe! I used this icing on a devil's food cake for a celebration at my University- everyone really liked it! The only changes I made were to use butter instead of margarine and to cut back the sugar to 4 cups.

It was easy to make and tastes pretty good.  I used butter instead of margarine & butter flavored shortening because it is what I had on hand.  It seemed gritty at first but I let it mix for a few more minutes and that seemed to help.  I couldn't imagine doing it without a stand-alone mixer.  I think I should have chilled it for a few before trying to do the decorating, but it worked pretty good.

Very yummy frosting.  I used low fat margarine and butter flavored crisco.  I halved the recipe and it frosted 3 dozen cookies very nicely.  I loved the soft, buttery flavor and will make this frosting often.

This was very good and very easy. I did need to add a splash more milk to get the consistancy I wanted, but the flavor was great.

I love this frosting! This was my first attempt at piping and it was alot of fun. I followed the recipe measurements for ingredients but I used all shortening (no butter) and used half and half instead of milk. I also wanted a very white color and had used and almond flavored cake so I replaced the vanilla with almond extract. Not overly sweet and great consistancy. I will use this again. Thanks for sharing!

I just made this to frost a butter pecan cake, and all that I can say is this: Holy Sweet Tooth, Batman!  I followed the recipe to a T, but this frosting is crazy sweet. I LOVE sugar, but this was too much.  I don't know how this got such rave reviews - other people must love sugar way more than I do.

I have looked through our cook books and online and none
of them tasted half as good as this one! We didn't have any shortening, so we used Tenderflake instead. THE BEST!!!

I've been using this recipe for years now, and my Mom has been using it for decades.  I love this recipe.  The only thing I change is I always use real butter.  Just made some today and added cocoa.  Perfect!

This is a tasty recipe that makes a LOT of icing.  I made 24 cupcakes and should have halved it.  It will frost and fill a big cake, but it's too much for small cakes or mix cakes.

This was simple and good.  I enjoyed it and found nothing wrong with it.  I have tried other similar recipes  on here and was dissapointed, but not with this one.  I used butter instead of margarine. Ignore silly negative reviews.  Obviously we all have different taste and expectations, have fun and learn.

This is an excellent frosting to work with.  I used it on my niece's first birthday cake with much success.  I was able to smooth it out really well (people asked me if it was fondant!) and also shape it with my hands and pipe it.  If you do add the vanilla, it will give the frosting an off-white color.  So I would recommend leaving it out or using clear vanilla if you want a whiter frosting.  I did not make any changes and it worked wonderfully!

I thought I wouldn't like this since I try not to use Crisco. However, since I was taking this decorated boxed cake to the beach, I figured the Crisco would holed up better than an all butter recipe. I followed the directions exactly, added some coconut since it was a sail boat cake. Well, everyone loved it. There was only 1 small piece left and by the time we cut the cake there were only 10 people left to eat it. Everyone thought the cake was from scratch and asked where I found the time. So I just let  them think it was from scratch. I am sure this homemade froshting is what gave the cake that at home taste.

YUMMMM!!  first attempt making my own frosting and this was sooo easy!!!  I agree with another review and it does taste like grocery store buttercream, but that's exactly what my husband loves.  So easy and so good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Great basic recipe but I would avoid the shortening as it tends to give it a waxy supermarket cake taste, not to mention the trans fats it contains, I use a full cup margarine and it works great. Kids love it!

I made this frosting last weekend to put on a giant cupcake using the Wilton giant cupcake pan.  This frosting was extremely easy to make and I received many compliments on it.  I did customize it slightly by adding a little more milk as I felt the consistency was a little too thick.  Also, I decreased the vanilla to 1 tsp. and added 1 1/2 tsp of almond extract which gave it a delicious and delicate flavor.  I noticed many traditional buttercream recipes do not use almond extract but I would definitely recommend it for anyone wanting to add a little more flavor to their frosting.     Over all this recipe is excellent and I would highly recommend it.

I usually use a different buttercream recipe but decided to try this one for a change. It's good but I like Grocery Store Frosting better. This one is not as sweet and I'm a fan for almost sickeningly-sweet :) I'm still glad I tried this, though!

Love it! This is the best butter cream recipe I've tried and will certainly use again and again. Great flavor and texture (I did use butter instead of margarine) and super easy to work with. Thanks! :)

Awful. Runny, and it separated shortly after making it.  I followed the recipe carefully, not that it was very difficult.  Worst frosting I've ever made.

I use this recipe whenever I need to make big batches of icing (basically whenever I make a castle cake for my niece's birthday) and I usually end up adding a bit more milk or icing sugar to get my desired consistency. Great recipe for frosting cakes, and adding little decorations to! Holds in place very nicely. I make mine with all margarine sometimes, or half and half margarine and shortening. Either tastes great!

I really like this.  Usually I use Ricks buttercream frosing recipe on this site- but I did not have whipping cream, so I used this one!  Very good.  I used 1 cup butter instead of the shortening and marg.  I also added 1 tsp salt.  Not artificial tasting!

I usually scrape the icing off of my cake because I don't like it, but even I ate this!  I used butter-flavored shortening and skim milk (was all I had at home) and was very pleased with the end result.  This is a great icing to use for piping and decorating!

OMG, OMG, OMG, this is just to die for!!  I was waffling back and forth between making this and my usual frosting recipe to cover a chocolate sheet cake, and I tried this because it was different and easy.  I am thrilled with the results.  It's delish with a wonderful texture.  The only changes I made were that I used 4 cups of the sugar, and a bit more vanilla (to take the edge off the powdered sugar taste that I was getting).  I think that next time I will used butter flavored shortening.  YAY!!!

Almost...
Just too sweet for me (which I honestly didn't think was possible). The confectioner's sugar brings it over the top; I like to load my icing on there, and it just was too sweet for my method.

I absolutely loved this recipe, and made the changes that others recommended. My family and friends couldn't stop raving about the flavor.

My only problem was that it came out an off-white color, so when I added the coloring to it, my colors looked muted. Has anyone else experienced this?

This is the buttercream frosting I've been looking for!  It's got the consistency and flavor I've wanted to achieve at home but never quite got it until now.  I used a little more margarine/less shortening as others suggested and just drizzled the milk in until I got the consistency I wanted.  Thanks!  Definitely the frosting I'll make from now on :)

I sometimes use butter in place of margarine. This is a HIT everytime- and works great for cookies and cakes- super for little ones to spread on cookies.

Very easy frosting.  I too used all butter and added chocolate.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  You can add all of the sugar or cut it back depending on how sweet you like your frosting.  I used 31/2 c sugar and 1c powdered cocoa.  Beat well, 5-8 min. for a smooth frosting.

This is the best. It's simple,sweet,easy. My 9 year old got second place at the father son cake bake off. One of the judges complimented my son on the frosting. The longer you whip this, the better it gets.

Even though I used 5 scant cups of sugar, this was still WAY sweet.  I did omit the salt because I used salted butter instead.  OK in a pinch, but in my opinion not much better than store bought canned frosting.

I have been using this recipe for months now on many many cakes, and I love the results. I've noticed that many reviewers complained about it being too greasy, something that I havn't noticed at all.  Infact I like this recipe because it cuts the strong butter taste I notice in so many other buttercream frostings. I love this one, and will continue to use it.  Infact my brothers 25th is tomorrow and I'm off to ice his cake using this recipe! Thanks Kris!

Absolutely wonderful.  Made yellow cake cupcakes and put this icing on.  24 cupcakes did not live to see the next day!!  I do not recommend halfing this recipe.  We did so this evening, and it came out completely different than the first time we tried it.  (I doublechecked everything, was perfectly halfed)  So make the full batch and get icing!!

I have been searching this site for a chocolate buttercream, and the ones I've found didn't appeal to me...this one sounded good to try and tweak...it turned out AWESOME!! I substituted one of the cups of confectioners sugar for cocoa powder and added 1/4 cup more of milk...it wasn't too sweet, perfect amount of chocolate flavor! I am sure this is great as a white icing too...but for anyone wanting to try it as a chocolate buttercream...it turns out great!!

This frosting was fantastic! I used it for a dozen cupcakes for my sons birthday party (I used a generous amount on each cupcake and there was still plenty of icing left over). Everyone raved over it! I did make a few alterations though. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening. I used a little more vanilla (about 2 tsp) and much less powdered sugar (about 3 cups). I also used about 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream in place of the milk. I beat it really well until it was nice and smooth and fluffy. I made it the day before I made the cupcakes and refrigerated it overnight in a container then let it sit out until it was close to room temperature before icing the cupcakes. Delicious!!!

It had a weird flavor that was due solely to the shortening.  I do want to try again.  Next time I will use exclusively butter. It's not implausible that my crisco was simply old.  With that said, the consistency was odd enough that I don't think the flavor from the crisco was the only issue.  Real butter whipped well should provide the consistency most would be looking for in a buttercream frosting.

I also think the addition of salt is fantastic.  Last but not least, 5 cups of powdered sugar is outrageous.  I followed other commenters and used 3.5 cups and it was PLENTY sweet.  

All told, I can't give this even 3 stars even though I do think its a good starting point.  I know I can make a decent buttercream - I just haven't yet....

This is the first time I have made any type of frosting, and it turned out perfectly for my son's bday cake.  I used butter instead of margarine, and 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp almond extract. I also sifted the sugar.  I made this the night before I decorated my son's cake, put it in the fridge overnight, and was then able to use it after about 20 minutes in room air with a pastry bag and tip (first time ever decorating a cake as well!). The frosting worked very well, held its shape, and tasted great, per everyone's review at the bday party! I would highly recommend this recipe and will be using it again.

Very good and easy. Taste and texture was just like a bakery. I used 4 cups powder sugar and fat free half and half.

I used butter instead of margerine. This turned out a fabulous buttercream that spread beautifully on my 9x13 yellow cake. No complaints here!

This frosting tastes good and was easy to make.  The only problem I found is that 1/4 cup of milk was not nearly enough for me, and 5 cups of powdered sugar was too much.  It started getting crumbly as I was putting the third cup of sugar in.  I ended up using 1/2 cup of milk and 4 cups of sugar.  It was spreadable, but still too thick.  I managed to get my crumb coating done, but then had to add another tablespoon of milk to my remaining icing to get it to ice properly.  HOWEVER, with that said, this is the best any frosting has come out for me.  That's why I'm giving it 5 stars.

I've been testing frostings this week and this one wasn't our favorite. Good side- it was fluffy,creamy, and easy spread.  For a medium consistency on cupcakes, use less milk.

Very good frosting! Might add a bit more milk because it was a bit dry and I had a tough time getting the sprinkles to stick. I also used real butter in place of the margarine.

Success! After several failed attempts, this recipe yielded a nice light, fluffy frosting that spread easily... and didn't taste "crunchy" from the powdered sugar.  I used my Kitchenaid for the heavy work in this recipe.  I let the margarine and shortening cream for a few minutes, then added part of the sugar.  When that was mixed, I added the vanilla, salt, and milk, then the rest of the sugar.  I added in a few drops of food coloring (which distributed well- not streaky or grainy).  I let the whole thing mix on a medium speed until it was nice and smooth.  It doesn't taste *exactlly* like bakery frosting, but it's the best I've ever made!  It made enough to generously frost a 9x13 cake.. with plenty left for bowl-licking!

Cut this recipe in 1/2, and it turned out beautifully.  Perfect for piping.  Will use many times.  Would go great on just about any cupcake or cake.  I used to top the mini chip cupcakes from this site.

I know it's already been said, but this recipe is wonderful.  I made 4 dozen sugar cookies and still have at least half of this frosting left over. So, the brilliant idea from those that tried them said "Well, just make more cookies".  This frosting is just that good!

This is amazing!  Easy and quick to get together. It is creamy, fluffy goodness!  I used butter, butter flavored shortening , and 1% milk, which is what I had on hand.  I used this to fill chocolate chip cookie cups which worked perfectly!

This frosting is great! While mixing, i would taste to make sure that it wasn't getting to sugary, I found that 5 cups of sugar would have been too much and even 4 cups of confectioners sugar (powered sugar) was a tad to much. Nonetheless, the frosting was perfectly smooth and delicious!!

I love this recipe!  It's great for cookies, cupcakes and bar cookies too. I use the butter flavored shortening and it gives it an extra buttery flavor.  Everyone raves over this frosting. Great texture and hardens perfectly for decorating.

I had to make a super quick frosting this morning and this is the one i had all the ingredients for. I love it. I didn't have margarine or shortening so i just used all butter. It tasted wonderful. I did ad about 1/4 cup of merange (sp) powder to help stiffen it up. my only suggestion is to refridgerate for about 1 hour before using if you are going to decorate with it. I also added 8oz of cream cheese to half the batch for a second cake. It turned out to be one of the best cream cheese frostings i have ever made. I will defately use this as a base for my frostings from now on.

My whole family loved this frosting. I have had a really hard time finding one that my husband likes, but this one can and will be used on every kind of cake in our home. Thanks!


UPDATE:
I made this frosting again today but added 1 cup of cocoa and 1/2 cup of milk (instead of what was called for in the original recipe). YUMMY! I prefer the butter cream verses the chocolate butter cream, but my daughters on the other hand choose the chocolate.

I made this with all real butter - no margerine, no shortening.  But no other changes.  It was smooth, creamy, easy to work with, and set up well.  Not at all too sweet.  Perfect amount to cover a 2 layer cake.

This recipe is just right!  I made a few changes b/c of the ingredients I had on hand - all butter instead of butter/shortening and heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  Will use this recipe for frosting from now on.

Tastes great and very simple to make. I did find though that the recipe as written was great for piping but a little too stiff for icing. I added a little extra milk to thin it down for icing.

This will be the only buttercream recipe I will use from now on.  i usually used the recipe on the back of the C&H box, it calls only for butter.  I've never been happy with the way it turned out.  Unlike this one the texture was great, not to sweet or greasy. Hard to believe w/ the 1/2 a cup of butter & shortening!:).  I used it to top the fudgy chocolate cake recipe from this site.  Best cake & frosting combo.

I like this recipe because it is easy and adjustable.  I used butter instead of margarine, and cut the confectioners sugar to 4 cups.  I tasted it after adding the sugar, and decided that while it wasn't "tooth-pain sweet", it was a nice light sweet that complimented my cake very well.  I'd recommend using the butter, and tasting as you go with the sugar so you can stop when it's sweet enough for YOU.  Thanks for the recipe...I'll be using it from now on!

Delicious!!! This recipe is perfect. I used it to make a baseball field cake for my friend. After I had frosted the cake, I kept sticking my finger in the bowl of leftover frosting so I could eat it. This recipe is good because the frosting dries up a little, holding its shape and not sticking to everything that touches it.

My first time making frosting, and it turned out really great. The great thing about this frosting is you can actually control the consistency of the frosting... add more milk to make it thinner, less milk to make it thicker. A little sweet for me, but when I added a cup of cocoa, it all evened out. Yum.

I used butter in place of the margarine and cut the sugar back to 4 cups instead of 5. I have a sweet tooth, but my husband doesn't. This recipe managed to please us both. Very easy to spread also. Thanks, I'll never have to use store bought frosting again.

Great!  I didn't have any shortening, so I used half margarine, half butter.  Used the full five cups of sugar and it's pretty sweet, but not unbearable.  Great texture.  Mmmmmm.....

I had to make cupcakes for my daughters class and I used this frosting.  The kids loved them!  Heck I loved them...lol.  It was really easy and tasty.  Taking pity on my daughter's teacher, I did decrease the sugar to about 3½ Cups(25 kids on a sugar high is my idea of torture).  I also used all butter which came out a little heavier than I would have liked, this is probably why the recipe calls for margarine and shortening.  I'll have to try it that way, as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I use this recipe to frost The Best Rolled   Sugar Cookies (found on this site) and the combination is great.  I am constantly asked to make the cookies.  The frosting is a key part of that.

This recipe is FANTASTIC, however, I reccomend using unsalted butter instead of margarine. I think that margarine doesn't taste as good as butter and it doesn't harden well.

We really liked this recipe. It was actually my first attempt at homemade frosting. I used butter flavored shortening as suggested and I used half and half instead of milk and didn't have to use 1/4 cup to get it to spreading consistency. I used the kitchen aid and beat for about 15 min. Oh and I forgot the salt. It is sweet but it's frosting!!! I'll use it again I'm sure.

Bless your heart, Kris—you just saved me a good bit of trouble with excellent results! Will use repeatedly. Halved recipe, replaced milk with lemon and vanilla extracts, and liquid food coloring. Pipes beautifully. Thanks to the writer who described how she did it with her KA; I followed in your steps.

This is a great recipe and very forgiving of substitutions.  For the chocolate variation mentioned already, I cut the shortening by half and used more butter; I also used half and half instead of milk.  Lovely flavour and texture -- and everyone loved it!  Thanks!

I doubled the recipe so I could color part of it to decorate my cake. I didn't want to run out but probably could have made a single batch. Had about 2 1/2 cups left over(some white some colored).  I also added almond extract.  This is my new favorite frosting recipe. EXCELLANT!!

This recipe was perfect with the moist yellow cake I did a search on.  Both the cake and the frosting were moist enough for my brother, who had oral surgery, and had a tender mouth to eat.  I would definately use this recipe again!

This frosting is beautiful because it is so smooth, fluffy, and light.  Very easy to spread.  Perfect sweetness, but a little greasy for my taste.  Maybe I'm not used to the shortening.

Store bought is easy, and I'm sure I'll still buy my share, but this is really the way to go when you want goodness.  It's far above the almost too sweet store bought.  I added cocoa and made a small adjustment in that I used evaporated milk for richness. (I only had skim milk and I wasn't looking to cut calories on this one.) Excellent, thank you!

I love cake and frosting, therefore I am not too picky. I ended up throwing the whole bowl of this stuff in the trash. I was lucky I had some canned frosting on hand.  The texture was nice but it really had a flat taste.  Just make sure you have a backup handy in case you want to try it for yourself. I don't like to give negative reviews, but I also don't like wasting food.

I live outside the US and don't bake much....but a friend was missing home and wanting a cake with frosting like the bakeries back home...So I came to the place I always do "ALLRECIPES" and as always this recipe didn't let me down...I had only butter and shortening which made it terrific and tasted just the way she wanted...I wasn't sure I would have enough for a two layer cake and maybe I would have made a half a recipe extra...but it turned out beautiful...Thanks AllRECIPES for always having the right recipe for the need.

A wonderful homemade frosting that is easy and delicious. I will usually sub butter for the margarine and shortening, just to make it extra creamy.

It's got way too much sugar for just 1/2 cup of butter ! If I make it again I would cut sugar down to 1 cup for 1/2 cup butter.

I was looking for a frosting that was more like the store quality.  This was it. Was a little nervous at first but finished result was amazing. I followed recommendation s from previous comment and used whole milk and butter flavored crisco.   Will use this recipe again forsure.  the best ever.

I liked the frosting. It was (as it says) like what you find in the store bakery. It reminded of what I would find in the grocery store bakery, not what I'd expect to find in an actual bakery shoppe. I will make it again and use less sugar and add a little more milk, so it's not as stiff. It was easy and went well with the red velvet cupcakes I made.

I made this icing for my son's first birthday cake. For the icing itself, I used butter instead of margarine. Also, I ended up not using as much confectioner's sugar - maybe about 4 and 1/4 cups instead of 5. I would recommend just working with the amount of sugar and milk until you get the consistency you want. I made this to ice the "Scottley's Basic Yellow Cake" recipe here on allrecipes. I got lots of compliments on the cake!

Great frosting. Finally found the right thickness i wanted for a frosting. Tastes great! I only recommend you whip the butter (not margarine) and shortening together first at room temperature. Gradually add the sugar. Then add the salt and vanilla. Once its all incoperated together i add the milk gradually to get the right consistancy i want. It was perfect. Now im on a sugar high!

I chose this recipe because it's the first frosting I came across here that I had all the ingredients for and I was in a hurry. I'm glad I stopped searching at this one. I'll NEVER make frosting any other way. It was easy to make and easy to work with, not to mention how good it tastes. I used butter-flavored Crisco instead of regular because that's what I had, and everything else exactly as recipe is written:)

This is THE buttercream.  I use butter, butter-flavor Crisco, and after it's well mixed, I just put the Kitchen Aid on medium and whip it for 15 minutes.  Yes, 15 minutes.  Perfect for piping and this recipe makes plenty for 24 heavily frosted cupcakes.

I got some cupcakes from WalMart.  I really liked the icing.  Instead of getting some more, I decided to make my own.  I had never attempted butter cream icing....until now.  I thought this was a nice icing.  The recipe is super easy.  Im impressed.  I will be making this again.

Needed a basic and simple frosting - this was perfect.  I followed the measurements but used what I had on hand such as I used real butter, high ratio shortening (highly recommend it!) and buttermilk.  I did not need the full 5 cups of confection sugar.  I added a full 1/4 tsp (maybe more) of salt to balance the sweetness.  I blended my butter while very cold adding in alternate amounts of sugar and buttermilk.  Once the butter was well combined I added the high ratio shortening and whipped it until light and fluffy.  I added the remainder of the buttermilk and enough sugar so that I had stiff peaks forming.  I chilled the frosting for 30 minutes and placed in a piping bag.  This step made for very easy piping and the designs had great detail showing.  I chilled the decorated cupcakes and the frosting crusted nicely.  The frosting was not overly sweet as I did not use all the sugar, added more salt and used buttermilk.   Will use again.

*KEPENATE* I read your review I will agree that if you did the recipe as wrote, it might taste like super market icing but I happen to like it when I have it, since it's only maybe twice a year. The recipe is a excellent one but as a cook, you sometimes need to add your own flare to things. What you like, may not be what the recipe giver likes so to each his own so make it your own. I added heavy whipping cream at the end because I found the icing too heavy for me so the whipping cream made it much lighter and I also added lemon flavor instead of vanilla and some lemon zest. I'm adding this icing to a carrot cake that I added pineapples in the batter the cake is  hit . I love this recipe this is my first time making butter cream frosting thank you for my NOW recipe :)

So I used this recipe for cupcakes I was baking with $ little girls i was babysitting and decided to brighten up the flavor by replacing the vanilla extract with about 1 Tablespoon of lemon extract.  I also used Wilton's Lavender & Sunshine Yellow food dyes to make it a little more fun(optional).  The girls had a great time and the recipe was actually pretty easy to follow.  My only suggestion (because we were piping the frosting) is to add a little more powdered sugar as you're beating it so that it can hold it's form. :) Thanks so much

Awesome,simply awesome. I stuck to the recipe ingredients 100%. Since my husband was frosting a cake for me I can tell you in all honesty I saw that man throw all the ingredients in a bowl, throw the beater on hi for a sec and it came out perfect.....no creaming of margarine and shortening required lol!:)

Great recipe. Used this to ice a Halloween cake. Creamed unsalted butter and Crisco for 5 minutes with KitchenAid. Would be hard to cream with a lesser machine I think. Used 4 cups sugar, 1/2 tsp almond extract, and 1 tsp vanilla. The humidity in the house did not seem to impact the icing.

Just make sure to beat it really well! I didn't actually have 5 whole cups of confectioner's sugar, it was more like 4 3/4 cups! :D  But it tastes awesome! My dad loved it! I put it on sugar cookies and they are very tasty if I do say so myself. I definitely recommend! (Oh and I actually used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening and a touch of butter flavoring. And we only have skim milk so that's what I used.)

This recipe worked well for me. I didn't have any milk so I two tablespoons (for 12 servings)  of Goya creme of coconut, which I thinned out with a tablespoon of water. I also used butter instead of margarine. It came out nice and creamy with a nice mild coconut flavor, which was a great compliment to my chocolate pineapple cake. Definitely added to my recipe box.

Let me start off with I am not a Butter Cream fan.  However, with the ratings and the comments of it being the BEST ever I thought I would try.
Followed the recipe exactly.  Will go back to my favorite.....Cream Cheese Frosting.

Very good taste, just a little bit on the sweet side for me but everyone else loved it.  Used more milk than called for to give it a smoother finish, butter instead of margarine, and butter-flavored Crisco.  Definitely the best of the butter cream frosting recipes I've tried so far.  Also have done it with a little less vanilla and adding raspberry or orange extract depending on the cake.

Absolutely wonderful frosting! I've been making and decorating cookies and cakes nigh' unto 30 years and this was the best! I did add 1/2 tsp of butter flavoring and substituted 1/3 c. heavy whipping cream for the milk, since I had it on hand, and needed to cut the powdered sugar to a little less than four cups to get a nice spreading and piping consistency. One of my friends who was decorating cookies with me asked that I use this on her wedding cake in two weeks. When I do, I'll be adding more powdered sugar and meringue powder to a bit of the frosting to form the roses. This will now be my standard frosting recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! It wasn't too sweet or buttery. I did cut down on the confectioners' suger to 3 1/2 cups as another reviewer suggested. I also had some evaporated milk left over so I used that instead of regular milk. It was perfect! I am going to use it as the frosting for my wedding cupcakes. Thank you!

Frosting is great.  Rich butter flavor.  I frosted a chocolate cake.  (Hershey's Deep Dark Chococlate cake) This frosting was the perfect compliment.  I had rave reviews from my co workers.  I will be using this recipe again.

This a great basic frosting recipe, and I have made it at least half a dozen times. Make sure you use both shortening and butter, as using all butter will give the frosting a different texture altogether. You can also substitute the vanilla extract for a different flavor such as almond, or use a combination of vanilla and another flavor to give it a unique taste. I also like how this recipe makes enough frosting to fully cover and decorate a three-layer round cake. This has become my go-to frosting recipe.

Yummy! I made this for Christmas and it was a hit! I did two 9" round pans and used the frosting as a filler between the two, then I did a 'crumb coating' and that was all the frosting. So I had to make another batch. If you are planning on decorating a cake with this, like I did, then I suggest doubling the recipe. Another thing, it comes out an almond color, so maybe clear vanilla for a white color? Thanks for this recipe.

This is the best Butter Cream Frosting EVER!! I too used butter shortening and butter instead of margarine.  It was a little thick for my liking so I added a little more milk and it was perfect! This will be the frosting i use from now on.

While I would say the flavor of this frosting is less than ok, the consistency was almost unspreadable!   Do not be fooled, this frosting tastes nothing like you would find in an "in-store bakery". This was a big, unspreadable disappointing flop!

Made this last night to go on Red Velvet cupcakes--this made A LOT of frosting! I only used about half the recipe for 24 cupcakes...so this would be perfect for a layered cake, I think.  I used 1 cup margarine because I was out of shortening and half and half instead of milk.It was fantastic. I will be using this recipe from now on for cookies and cakes.

I used real butter and I doubled this recipe and it was absolutely amazing!  Enough frosting to do a small 3 tier cake and my family thought it was amazing!  I also added a little almond extract along with the vanilla as I love almond extract!

Very good recipe.  Tastes a lot like the Wilton butter cream, but  a bit creamier and more butter flavor.  I used it on cinnamon rolls and it paired nicely.

This was a really nice frosting; I used it on some cupcakes. I made some alterations because of some of the earlier reviews, so I only used 3 c of powdered sugar. The consistency was perfect even after this change, but I was a little bored with the flavor - it's just kinda plain - so I added a small amount of almond extract to make it more interesting. I'd definitely make it again.

WOW!!!  This is the best butter cream  ever!  The only thing I did different was add a tad bit more milk.  That was because I wasn't going to do any piping with it, so I wanted it a little creamier.  I could have eaten the whole bowl of frosting by itself!  I almost forgot, I also used butter and butter-flavored Crisco.

Excellent frosting, I used 1/2c buttered flavored Crisco and 1/2c butter as suggested by LTH. The frosting was excellent on the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough & Cupcake recipe. Will be using this frosting often. 7-4-10, this is the second time I've made this frosting, took cupcakes to a picinic yesterday with this frosting and most of the people there thought this frosting was too sweet. I and few others loved it.  It is very easy to make and easy to use in a pastry bag to pipe on to the cupcakes.

Outstanding!!!! This recipe was super easy and super delicious. I was in search of a simple but good icing recipe that I could use as an alternate to cream cheese icing. Believe  me I love cream cheese icing but I just wanted a change. This recipe indeed tastes like the butter cream frosting in bakeries. I might even attempt to make my son's birthday cake in a couple of months opposed to buying one from the bakery. I feel confident it will turn out A-OK.

This tastes incredible and was so easy to make!  I had used another buttercream recipe listed here, but when I went to search for it, I decided to use this one.  I'm glad I did - it is so smooth and creamy without being too, too sweet!  Perfect!

Excellent and easy frosting!  I only had one box of powdered sugar (4 cups, not 5) so I just added about 1/2 the milk and the consistency was great!  Tasty and easy to spread.  It dried fairly quickly too so I didn't have to worry about the cupcakes getting all stuck together by the time we got to the party.

I love this frosting!  Best I have ever had.  Thanks for the recipe.  My family loves it too.  Only changes I made were to use real butter and I used half and half instead of milk.  I also added three tablespoons of half and half at the end because I wanted the frosting to be a little smoother.

This recipe turned out great.  The frosting was not too sweet--just right.  Make sure your ingredients are at room temperature.  I used all butter.  Half the recipe will frost a 9 x 13 cake.

This was so awesomely delicious. I didn't have shortening, so I just used butter and it was so GOOD! Definitely better than any store bought brands. It was a nice consistency and spreaded easily on cake. I spread a layer of frosting, then froze the cake overnight and used more frosting with food coloring to decorate. Great taste and texture. Everyone loved it!

This is a great tasting frosting. I like that it isn't too sweet. I substituted butter for the margerine, substituted 1 cup cocoa powder for 1 cup of the powdered sugar, and added a couple of drops of Peppermint Extract. It tasted like 'Peppermint Patty' icing. Try this variation if you like chocolate/mint together! This is my new go-to recipe for basic buttercream. With the addition of any extract (just a couple of drops) the possibilities are limitless.

Amazing.  I did make some changes.  I heated the frosting to help blend it together.  I then mixed it as it cooled.  This gave it an amazing texture.  That is the only thing I changed.  Oh yeah I used butter flavored crisco.  Simply Amazing!

Really good!  I had to add a little extra milk to make it workable, but the texture and flavor were perfect.  They dried to the touch in just 30 minutes.  To make sprinkles stick really well make it thinner.

Good recipe.  I did modify it just a touch, because it was a bit sweet for my taste. I  used butter in place of margarin, added a bit of lemon juice, more milk (just to thin it a tad), and added cocoa powder so it was chocolate. I don't like my frosting to over power my cake.  I used this on a Chocolate Cake, with Cherry ice cream in the middle.  It was fabulous. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was really good frosting! I used butter flavored crisco & butter. Next time I think I might up the butter portion and add a bit less of the crisco. Don't get me wrong it was great I just think it need a slight tweak. I also added 1tsp almond extract and 1tsp vanilla. Got great reviews from everyone!!

Very good icing. My first one actually. I used butter instead of margarine and added about 1 and half tbsp lemon juice. I think it will be very good with rum flavor instead of vanilla too. The batch was enough abundantely for 24 cupcakes

Just as good or better than the stuff in the stores and feels healthier as it doesn't have all of the preservatives.

Really great frosting that can be tinkered with: I used real butter and half and  half instead of margerine and milk.  I also used a combo of vanilla butter nut flavoring, real vanilla, and a bit of almond extract.  The whisk attachment of a kitchaid makes it come together and get light and fluffy very quickly.  Yummy!  I had some frosting left over after I finished the cupcakes, and I added some cocoa powder to make it chocolatey.  Very versatile recipe!

This frosting doesn't joke around. It's thick and rich and seriously sweet. I added   2 tablespoons of lemon juice to cut the sweetness a bit. I used it to frost my christmas cookies this year and everyone loved them. All in all, this is a wonderful recipe!

My first time ever making frosting & everything came out perfectly! The ONLY thing I did different was I added a packet of sugar-free orange kool-aid mix to get an orange color for Halloween themed cupcakes. Excellent!

Very very rich, very thick, delicious buttercream frosting! Creamy and whipped in texture, so very filling and not too light at all. We all loved this! Thanks for sharing this Kris, it is the best vanilla buttercream I have made yet.

Great recipe! Easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  It was not too sweet, in fact, I thought it was better than bakery frosting!  It is going to be one that I will use again and again!

Edit : I am now giving this recipe 5 stars as the next day it was SO much better. Even I liked it! It was perfect on my cookies and cream cupcakes.
-----------

I really don't like buttercream frosting in general, but I made this for my partner who loves it from his childhood. 

I changed the servings to 18 (3/4 of the full recipe) to frost 12 large cupcakes (very large). It was the perfect amount. 

I made these substitutions:

Butter instead of marg. Otherwise it'd be far too much processed fat for my tastes.

I only used 3 cups of sugar instead of 3 + 3/4 based on everyone's reviews. It was still incredibly sweet.

I used "butter" crisco because that's all the store had. 

I added more pure vanilla extract because at first it tasted too much like fat and icing sugar. This worked well to give it a better flavour.

The consistency at this point was very greasy and not near firm enough so I added approx 1/2 cup of fine flour (a spoon at a time).

I beat it for about 5-8 minutes and it became incredibly fluffy.

I wasn't so keen on the final product for eating but it piped beautifully and my partner really enjoyed eating it.

I used this for my son's birthday cake.  Everyone raved about the frosting saying that it was the best cake they've ever had.  I had a coworker ask if I made wedding cakes because it's exactly how he wants his wedding cake to taste.  The only change I made was I used butter instead of margarine.

I quartered the recipe, and decreased the sugar to 80 grams, and it was  good! It maked enough to frost 30 mini chocolate cupcakes. Also added a little blue coloring, put edible silver balls and sprinkles, and brought them to campus for a friend's birthday, and they all loved it, especially the frosting part!

This was great!  So easy to make, too.  It really did taste like the kind at the bakeries.  I used just a little less milk than called for - you can always add more if you need to.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! Easy, and a great way to break in my new mixer. I left it at 4c of confectioner's sugar and added a small amount of cinnamon to complement the apple cake it was meant to frost, and it tastes far better than store-bought frosting and even better, it makes enough for leftover frosting to nick tastes of with a spoon!! YUM!

This frosting was very good.  I used butter instead of margarine.  It was a bit too sweet for me, so next time I'll cut the sugar a bit.  I'll also try different extracts.  I would suggest only making a half recipe per 13 x 9" cake.  It was just way too much frosting for one cake.

I used butter instead of margarine and cut the sugar back to 4 like others and this  was the best frosting I have ever tried. It hits the spot. There wasnt even a drop left because my husband licked the mixer clean. I will definately use this again.

I used real butter and shortening and it was just like what you get at a bakery. It had a nice texture and was easy to spread.  I also doubled it to fill and frost a 9x13 birthday cake.

Delicious.  I used butter flavored shortening and butter instead of margarine and it was the best frosting.  I didn't have enough sugar for the recipe but it was still plenty.  Really easy to make and everyone loved the cake. After the cake was gone, I ate frosting off the serving plate LOL

This was pretty good, as buttercream frostings go, but only after making a few changes (in my humble opinion!).  I followed a lot of reviewers advice and used butter instead of margarine, butter flavored shortening, and cut back on the powdered sugar.  The results were pretty good.  I'm not a big frosting fan (I prefer my cake without), but my family loves frosting and they enjoyed this one.

If there were six starts I would rate it six!!  This recipe is absolutely incredible!!  The only things I changed were that I used evaporated milk (I ran out of regular milk) and I used one cup of shortening instead of 1/2 and 1/2.  Also I had to add additional milk, the mixture was too thick.  But wow, what a result.  I feel like I can open a cake shop with this recipe.

Great frosting!!  I used a little more than 1/2 cup butter (instead of margarine) and a little less of the shortening. The result was a frosting with a great consistency and flavor.  I WILL keep this in my file!

Yum, I really liked this on some cupcakes I made. I cut the sugar in half and it ended up being perfect without tasting too sweet.  The shortening gave it a nice consistency, but next time I think I will try using a little less shortening and a little more margarine. Good vanilla flavor.  Thanks!

Easy recipe to follow. I made it with butter instead of magarine because I wanted a stiffer frosting for decorating and it worked. Will definitely make again.

This is a great frosting recipe--I will use it from now on when frosting cookies.  I just made some Valentin'es cookie and decided to double the frosting recipe--it makes a TON!  If you're frosting cookies, you might want to stick with one batch of frosting.

This was great.  I've made it a few times and no longer measure the powdered sugar - just keep adding until the consistency is right.  The keys are use room temp ingredients, add a little almond extract, substitute butter for the margarine, and whip, whip, whip for a long time with a stand mixer.  The consistency just keeps getting better the more you whip it.

I made this dairy-free for my daughter who is on a dairy-free (and soy-free and gluten-free) diet.  Use Fleischmann's UNSALTED margarine which is made from corn oil--contains no dairy or soy.  You can use rice or other non-dairy "milk" for the milk.

I tried this recipe last night on 7/7/04 and it is SOOOOOOOOO good. I did add lemon flavoring to the frosting because I was making a lemon cake and it was delicious. I think that it would be possible to add any flavoring that you desired and it would be wonderful. The frosting didn't get hard and crunchy the next day either like some other frosting recipes I've tried. It was still as good as it was last night when I made it.

Very tastey frosting! I made a single batch and we able to barely frost a 2 layer 9X15 cake, so I did not have any frosting left over to make decorations. Like other users stated before, it is best to use room temperature ingredients and beat them very well. Thumbs up for this recipe!

Excellent!  This is the first time I've made frosting as I've always bought the ones from the store.  I scaled the recipe to half and it just *barely* frosted one 8-inch double layer chocolate cake (oops! dark crumbs showed through a little!).  Even the thinner layer of frosting was sweet enough to balance the dark chocolate cake perfectly!

This is very good.  It does need to be beaten a few minutes to incorporate the sugar, but it's very light, fluffy, and perfect on a dark chocolate cake.  I've used it on the Black Magic Cake from this site and it's wonderful!  I won't buy icing in a can anymore!

This is an excellant frosting recipie. It was yummy, easy to spread, fluffy and rich. It does taste just like the store bought kind. It also makes a lot of frosting. But, you can always put some in the frige or freezer for later. I beat mine with a handmixer on high speed for about five minutes.

Really good!  I also used butter instead of margarine.  I didn't use all powd. sugar, it was already desired consistency at 4 1/2 cups!  Made lots of creamy buttery frosting!  Thanks Kris!

I originally rated this icing at three stars, because I didn't like the initial texture.  But I have to say I use it all the time with 4 Egg Yellow cake recipe found here and I love it.  It seems to get better with a little bit of time (to me at least).  I actually can't tell a difference between it and store bought.  I love it.  I have refridgerated some icing also...the recipe does make a lot.  The refridgerated icing comes out beautifully too.

This is great.  I did not use the salt and it still was perfect.  Really tastes like what the bakery uses!  Stores nicely too, I made it on a Sunday and used it the following Thursday and it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe

Smooth and fluffy, but a little too greasy for my taste.  The other reviews said this recipe made A LOT of frosting, so I decided to half this recipe. It still made a lot of frosting, but overall, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.

This is a wonderful frosting! It has a good taste and it is very creamy and spreads well on a cake. The best thing is that it only took a few minutes to make and it was so simple. I will never buy the can stuff again!

I had always made my own buttercream frosting and realized I needed a new recipe.  Well, I found it.  This recipe was so easy and the consistency of the frosting was great.  My family loved it!!!  They could not get enough of the cake I put it on.  I'll use it for everything.  JPire

Great recipe! very creamy and not too sweet. I ran out of vanilla extract and didn't know it before i started making the frosting. I used 1 teaspoon of almond extract instead, it was awesome.

I have been trying different frostings, and this is what I have been looking for!  It is a little sweet, but just don't put a heaping amount on the cake, and it will be perfect.  We put a good amount on the cake and still had some leftover, so you might could do 2 cakes with light icing on them.  I used 1 c. butter flavored shortening instead of 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening.  The texture is so smooth and the flavor it great!

SUPER frosting recipe! I've been using such an INFERIOR (and self-homespun :-) recipe for too long. Couldn't find it, so came here looking. I must say, it's the best no-cook frosting I've ever used - MAHALO! I also made 1/2 of the batch chocolate for variety on my cupcakes. This frosting is not too sweet and very fluffy and delicious!! Quick, too - 1/2 recipe frosted 2 dozen cupcakes for me, since we don't like them piled high with the frosting.

this is a great frosting recipe. the frosting works well dyed pastels with food coloring. however, i used it to make 12 cupcakes, and i cut the recipe for frosting in half. it worked well, so i would say a full recipe easily frosts 24 cupcakes. :)

This one I couldn't believe!  I needed frosting for 24 cupcakes and found this recipe.  Resized it so that it wasn't so huge.  There are just two of us!  Most of the recipes will feed 300 or more people.  And, they can't be resized down enough
The frosting came out exactly as described and piped on the cupcakes easily.
I rate this one as the best I have tried.  '
Thank you for an easy and very good frosting recipe

Sweet fluffy bakery quality frosting. I substituted margarine with real butter and milk for half and half. Use a KitchenAid if you have one; much easier to whip ingredients!

Frosting was the best I’ve ever made. Not the best I’ve ever had. But couldn’t tell you what the secret ingredient was in that one. I substituted good butter for margarine and used banana extract instead of vanilla and it was delicious. Will never buy frosting again.

Too sugary for many people's taste, I used a cup less than what the recipe called for and it was perfect

Hmmm...I love it.  I intended on doing 3.5 c confectioners sugar like one review suggested; but tasted it after 3 cups - and it was perfect.  Savory with just enough sweet (to quench you).  Quite a nice, grown up - classy dessert flavor.  And it does taste like a professional recipe. Thanks to the author for sharing.

First off....I used 2 sticks of real butter, salted even! Gasp! Obviously omitted adding any more salt. To some tastes this MAY be too sweet, but honestly that really is personal preference. I typically like more of a buttery overtone but this was for my kiddos 8th birthday cake, so he was happy, happy. Next time I may lessen the sugar to 4 cups. But overall a simple straight forward butter cream! Thank you!

It came out great but I used whole milk and butter flavored Crisco and instead of margarine I used real butter . It came out sweet creamy and very good. I then added some orange food coloring for the Halloween cupcakes I was making.

I love this frosting.  So light and fluffy if you beat it on high for a minute.  I like to add a 1/4 teaspoon of almond flavoring for another touch of richness sometimes.

I think this frosting is a good basic frosting for beginners, easier to work with than butter.  The taste is very sweet, but I found it made for easy cake decorating with a piping bag.  I wet easy on the salt the second round.

I made this exactly as written. While this isn't my favorite frosting, it delivers exactly what it promises. It tastes like the kind of frosting you would get on a grocery store-bought cake. This recipe is for people looking for the familiar flavor of commercial baked goods. Don't prepare this recipe and expect it to taste like an artisan bakery.

I've always made my buttercream frosting using butter. Adding shortening, I used butter flavored Crisco, added a better flavor. I will be using this recipe from now on.

This was ok. Still better than a can, but just very oily. I even tried it with butter instead of margarine and everyone was kind of meh about it. I'll be looking for an all butter recipe in the future.

Loved this frosting! The only change I made was that I used butter instead of margerine because I don't use it.  It turned out better than my standard buttercream and I'll definitely be Making this again. Very easy frosting recipe.

This recipe was easy, but way to sweet and I have a huge sweet tooth. I also found it was way to thick to pipe and I even added extra milk to try and make it a bit smoother to pipe but it was far from pipe-able. I would make it again if I was able to make it a lot less sweet.

I used KAF emulsion flavoring instead of vanilla, and no milk at all, because the humidity today was 100% and I was afraid it would melt! It survived the trip to my mom's 90th birthday party intact and got RAVE reviews. I did quadruple the recipe, which was far too much for 90 mini cupcakes, but I've frozen the rest with confidence my sister will like it, and it's a great base to add other flavorings/colors to, since I didn't' add all the liquid. (Only doubled the vanilla, btw.)

By far the best frosting I've ever made.  I did tweak a bit by using butter flavored shortening instead of regular and I used whipping cream instead of milk.  Everyone raves how good it tastes!  Great recipe even without the changes, thank you!

I'm giving it four stars because I think it's a good recipe but I like my frosting "not so sweet". I made it with 2 3/4 cups powdered sugar and it was even still a little sweet for my tastes but still very good. I also used a butter flavored shortening for extra butter flavor. I loved how easy it was to spread and I will go to this recipe from now on except I will use half or less of powdered sugar from now on.

My first time making it and the only thing I changed was I used coconut flavoring because I was making a coconut cake.I followed others advice and beat it about 3minutes to cream the butter and shortening together then added the other ingredients and mixed total of 4 minutes. .
This frosting came out great and was plenty to frost a sheet cake or I think it would be plenty for a two layer cake.
This is now my go to frosting.

I loved this recipe it was easy and simple to make that I was actually shocked.It tastes great !! I only had chocolate frosting at home so I came across this recipe  looking for something different . It's only 4 ingredients and very simple to whip up ! It made the perfect icing for my chocolate cake . I added a little extra milk to make the texture a little creamier so it would spead easier . It didn't hurt the recipe the extra milk . Overall great recipe for Butter cream Frosting !

So, I haven't made a buttercream in about eight years because I always feel that I can taste the butter. However, this recipe was awesome! It was perfect for frosting and decorating my cake with zero drooping. I was so happy with the taste and consistency of this frosting. The only downside was that it only makes a small amount. I doubled the recipe and had just enough to frost the outside of my cake and write a happy birthday message.

I went with the advice of the "Most Helpful Positive Review".  I used butter flavored crisco and real butter instead of margarine.  It tasted like there was too much crisco and perhaps too much confectioners sugar. Perhaps next time,  I'll make the recipe as the original submitter called for and see it that is any better.

An inside tip: use high ratio shortening and not Crisco! It will be much smoother and won't melt. Will also have a better texture for cake decorating.

This worked well for me.  I didn't' have margarine so I subbed vegetable spread (country crock) which worked but had a slightly different taste then most likely margarine would have.  I added 6 T of unsweetened cocoa powder to frost my sons birthday cake & that seemed to mask the Country crock taste a bit.   Overall very good, and helped this mom when in a bind.  Thanks!

Perfect taste, consistency and covers a round layer cake with abundant frosting!  Maybe a little more vanilla for my taste, but don't change quantities to compensate.  It's a nice solid frosting and smooth as silk. Love it

Used butter instead of margarine, and used just regular vegetable crisco instead of the butter flavored one most people in the comments used. And this frosting turned out fantastic. Will use again.

Really, really good!  This is a very sweet butter cream icing.  I have used other's suggestions of using whole milk or even up to 10% cream.   The recipe makes a lot.  My one issue with it is that it does not hold colour very well.  Turns out lumpy and the butter separates.  But other than that, it's really great!

I love this icing!!  It is the only one i use...especially the chocolate version someone else suggested (replace 1 cup sugar with cocoa and increase milk by 1/4 cup).  I have constant requests for the icing with or without cake to put it on.

WOW!  No need to look for any other buttercream frosting.  I can't remember needing to make a vanilla frosting that wasn't glaze so I was quite nervous making it for my first time as chocolate is my forte.  Using butter flavor crisco, this frosting was light, flavorful and not greasy at all.  I wished I could just eat it straight out of the bowl!  I have no need to look for any other recipe-this is fantastic.

This is an outstanding recipe! The only thing I changed was to use real butter instead of margarine, and dumped a little cocoa powder in for just a hint of chocolate. I think the salt makes it perfectly balanced. Saving this one for sure!

This is the BEST recipe for Butter Cream Frosting I have ever made.   It tastes just like what I would buy at the store.........except I saved cost by making the birthday cake  myself.    The frosting is perfect. It is EASY!  I also added some food coloring and decorated the cake.   Perfect to decorate with as well.   I think the baker might need some lessons on cake decorating...........but the FROSTING itself is wonderful.   I will use it over and over again.   Thank you.

I did not tweak it at all.   I think a recipe should always be tried first BEFORE one changes it.   PERFECT just the way it is.

Very nice frosting, great consistency, pipes well, tastes great! Only difference was I used butter instead of margarine. This is a keeper, had enough to do a double layer cake with extra for decorating. A keeper!

I make this frosting a lot.  My only change is to actually use butter instead of margarine.  Also if you do that I discovered you have to whip the butter and other shortening for a long time.  If I don't do that I end up with spots on my frosted cake the following day, like the 2 are separating from each other.  But the frosting is delicious and works well for decorating.  I tried using margarine 1 time and the frosting was not very stiff so it was hard to decorate cake with it.

Look no further for  a great bakery-style frosting! I recommend using real butter and butter-flavored Crisco. For Chocolate frosting, I added about 3/4 cup cocoa and another 1/4 cup milk to the regular recipe. Excellent! Thank you Kris:)

Using soy milk made this completely kosher and a help in accommodating additional customers that come to my shop! Not a fan of traditional, US-style buttercream, but glad to have this recipe now. Thanks!

This was very easy - I did use the suggestions by other reviewers and used only butter & not shortening.  I also only used 4 cups of powdered sugar and this made way more than enough for the 9 x 13 cake I made.  I'm freezing the rest to see how that tastes after thawing.  Excellent consistency, very easily frosted my cake.  I even added green dye (for my St Patrick's Day hubbie's bday)!

This is a great simple recipe frosting. Since I used non-dairy milk, I ended up using half a cup instead of one fourth to make it creamier.

I used butter instead of margarine and 3 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 5. It was plenty sweet. I probably should have beat it longer than 4-5 minutes because it was a wee bit gritty. I was hoping that the frosting was going to be light and airy but it seemed dense like what you get out of a store bought can.  I will try again and maybe tweak the beating time in hopes that it gets lighter.

OMG........this icing is so delicious. The only way this icing is coming out wrong is if it is not followed. It will hold or stick to any cake or muffin its placed on. The flavor is fab. I didn't have any regular shortening so I used butter flavor shortening and unsalted butter. I'm in love. Yup this is my new icing and just change the flavor with extract.

This recipe is simple and yields a nice spreadable frosting.  It is easily adaptable.  My son wanted some lemon frosting so I replaced the the vanilla with lemon extract and added an additional two teaspoons and it did not ruin the frosting.  I also used half and half instead of milk.  For my tastes, I wish there was a bit more of a buttery flavor so I will use butter flavored Crisco next time as one reviewer recommended.

This didn't have an all-out buttery flavor, which I missed. It was sweet and tasted lovely on snickerdoodle cupcakes. I may add some cinnamon to it to match the cupcakes better. :)

pretty good instead of milk I added lemon juice. So its a lemon cake. but overall pretty good. the only thing I did not like about it was that when I frosted my 9x13 cake both the top and sides ( I took it out of the pan so it could go on a platter.) their was barely enough followed the recipe to a T, and the frosting on my cake is very thin but oh well.

Good, but I'm not used to making frosting with crisco, so next time I will use less crisco.  The texture was good but the crisco made the flavor milder (maybe less sweet?) than how I prefer it. So I will try it with only 1/4 cup crisco next time and see if I like that mixture.

I have used this recipe as a guide the last few times I have made cakes/cupcakes. I don't use as much powdered sugar, maybe 3-4 cups and slightly a bit more milk. I have used this recipe to make peanut butter, gingerbread and chocolate flavor frosting. Everyone who has had my cakes loves the frosting. So A great BIG THANK YOU to the original person who posted this recipe!

I love the consistency of this frosting! It came out just the way I wanted it to for the cake I was making and piped out well. My only beef with it is that there is no true butter in it, which makes the name a misnomer. I'm anxious to see how  my family likes it when we cut into the cake today!

it came together smoothly and quickly. It got really soft quickly so, I had to refridgerate for like 20 minutes after making so it would stick to the side of the cake. The taste was amazing however on my red velvet cake. This was more then enough to ice a double layer 9 inch cake with a bit extra leftover

Excellent butter cream frosting! I made it this morning. My granddaughter woke me up to make a chocolate cake with pink frosting. The only change, other than adding a little food color to make it pink, was to use 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tea of butter flavor, as suggest in the reviews. I'm sure that either way this recipe would be great. I will be making this again soon!

Yum yum yum! I used all butter in my frosting added a little more powdered sugar to stiffen it up. It was too liquidy after adding the milk.

I love this recipe! I stopped attempting to make butter cream frosting years ago, it never turned out properly and never firmed up. But this is so easy. I'm not a fan of shortening, so I used all butter. It shocked me how easy it was to make. It tasted fantastic also. This is now my official butter cream frosting recipe for cakes and cookies. I absolutely love it!

I liked this recipe fairly well. I think I would prefer a 2/3 butter to 1/3 shortening version better because it seemed a bit greasy for my tastes.
The only thing I did differently in the base of the recipe was used 1/2 evaporated milk and 1/2 water because I realized mid-process I didn't have any fresh milk.
Other than that used strawberry flavoring and it shaped great on the cupcakes I made.

I followed the recipe, except with butter instead of margarine, and thought it was just ok. Then I read several reviews and decided to add a splash of lemon juice to balance out the sweetness=perfect! I also whipped the frosting for about 5 min. Just like a bakery! I will use this again and again!

Great recipe, smooth and nice consistency.  Only change I made was a little more liquid AND  subbed imitation vanilla butter and nut flavoring for the vanilla.

THIS TASTED EXACTLY LIKE THE VANILLA FROSTING IN THE PLASTIC CONTAINERS, next to the cake mixes in the store. At least now I know exactly how they make it. I scaled the recipe way back and I was trying out different butter cream frostings to practice piping and wanted a variety. The only change I made was using heavy cream for the milk because that is what I had out. That wouldn't change the taste just the texture a bit. But, I may be uncommon, but I do not like the store shelf frostings at all. If you are looking for a quick sub for store tub frosting, for cupcakes or something similar, you may like this! It does however look like it will pipe fine for cupcakes, etc.

I was really hoping this would be "the one" but unfortunately it wasn't.  I followed the recipe to a T using butter flavored shortening.  After I mixed it all together to taste it tasted like powdered sugar and milk.. nothing else.. had to 'butter' taste to it.  It makes a good base for cream cheese frosting.. I ended up adding in a brick of cream cheese to frost my sons' bday cake.  Course now I got alot leftover.. but that's ok.  I'll use it for something.

I'm going to stick with my cream cheese recipe until I find "the one" as this was not it.

This was a great and easy... my boyfriend liked it and he HATES frosting. I added a little more salt to contrast with the sweetness and used a parchment tube to decorate a cooled cake. It was firm but it did help to chill it after decorating. I also used butter instead of shortening.

Very good recipe. I was able to make a small batch of this frosting by hand and it tasted great. I used a few Lemon drops in aswell. Great texture not too sticky or too droopy better than the instore bakaries if you ask me much more authintic.

Love, love, love this icing! My family is lactose intolerant and I am easily able to modify this recipe  (using lactose-free milk) so that they can eat it. I use butter-flavored shortening to give it a more buttery flavor. Yum!

I made this and it's great to decorate cakes with but found it way to sweet to cover whole cake.

Yummy!  I read through reviews and used unsalted butter instead of margerine, then added an additional 1 tsp of butter flavoring (I want more flavor than just sweetness) and it was amazing!  I mixed in my kitchenaid mixer for 5 plus minutes.  I frosted a chocolate cake with this recipe, took it to a cookout and received many, many rave reviews!  This is a keeper, thanks!

Great consistency and flavor.  I used butter instead of margarine and almond extract rather than vanilla.  The proportions are right on.  For those that think it's too sweet-it's as sweet as a bakery cake frosting!  I'd give it 5 stars but it should be butter all the way (it's better for you too!)

THIS IS THE BEST FROSTING I HAVE EVER MADE!  And I have made quite a few in the last decade!  The only change I made was subbed butter for margarine as we don't use it.  It's so close to grocery-type frosting I can't believe it!  I tried another one "Grocery store frosting" on here and this one beats it hands down!!!   A+++  Thank you Kris!!

I made this to frost a 9x13" Rainbow Clown Cake, also on this site and although it was very good, I would definitely make a few minor changes next time I make it.  For me, this made way too much frosting for a 9x13" cake.  If you were frosting cupcakes, you might use it all, but I had a ton leftover.  So, next time, I would definitely cut at least a cup of the sugar and adjust the milk accordingly.  It tasted great, however, and I will make it again!

This frosting is amazing! It tastes just like the buttercream b'day cakes at the store.   I stored mine in the frigerator and even within the next couple of days the consistency was wonderful and still tasted delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, a keeper!  Best frosting recipe I've found on this site.  I cut it in half and it frosted 24 cupcakes with just a little left over.  I did beat it for about 5 minutes and it was plenty thick and spread very nicely.

Great recipe but personally 5 cups of icing sugar would have been WAY too sweet. I only used 3 cups and it was plenty sweet. I also used butter instead of margarine, because that is what I had on hand. Overall very yummy and went well with the cake I used it on!

My first homemade frosting, better than any store-brought frosting ever.  I only had 3 c of confectioners', and I used half the vanilla extract and half maple flavoring.  PERFECT!!!! Not to sweet, and so easy to make.  This is a keeper, my new go-to frosting.  Thanks Kris

best and easiest frosting I've tried yet. Had to use a little extra vanilla to detract from the shortening taste, but that's very minor. Hardens when not kept covered.

This butter cream frosting recipe is very tasty.  I think this is the best frosting I have ever made.  I changed the amount of sugar and used 2 cups of confectioner's sugar instead of 5.  It was sweet enough for me, and I have sweet tooth.  I added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter.  OMG it was so good.

I made a birthday cake with this frosting and I have never had so many compliments from a cake until I used this frosting. I made a Strawberry, Vanilla & Chocolate cake with Almond Cream Cheese filling &  butter cream frosting with sliced Almonds on the cake .That's what I call Neapolitan Cake. Thank you for this wonderful frosting!

Ok, I love this recipe.  First - easy!  Second, leaves room to add flavoring as you like.  You don't HAVE to leave it just vanilla.  And the review about milk=fluffy...thank you!  I made a test batch by changing the serving and recalculated, that's a neat trick!

I halved the recipe and used it on 12 cupcakes and an 8" square dish and it was plenty.  I used 1 tsp vanilla and added the milk slowly until I got the consistency I wanted.  Very easy to make which was very good for me.

Definitely tastes like it's from an in-store bakery, not an actual quality bakery. The shortening and overabundance of confectioner's sugar gave it a rather unpleasant tinny aftertaste.

Good basic frosting.  Used butter instead of margarine.  I have made both as a vanilla and a chocolate frosting (simply by replacing 1 cup of the powdered sugar with cocoa).

I might never buy frosting, again! This was so easy to follow, and I loved how all of the ingredients are pantry staples. I didn't measure the confectioners' sugar, but kept adding until I got the consistency I wanted. Yay for yummy frosting!

This was perfect for decorating my son's birthday cake. I used almond extract and doubled the recipe because I needed a little extra to do different colours (I frosted a 9x13 double layer cake and then decorated with different colours). I am not convinced that a single batch would ice a 9x13 completely.

After baking Banana Bread VIII, I halved this recipe and modified it slightly for my family's alkaline vegan diet. After substituting the olive oil for both the margarine and shortening, substituting date sugar for sugar (powdered in the blender), and doubling the vanilla and salt, I added 1 cup of water. Very tasty! For a special treat, I heated (just before simmering) a combination of: 1 cup water, blended frozen strawberries, frozen cubed mango and 2tsp agave syrup, and mixed it in with the frosting to make it creamier. Super tasty! With these modifications, definitely on the menu!

One of the best frosting recipes I've come across. One batch frosted and completely decorated a 9"x13" cake. I too used my Kitchenaid and mixed for about 5 minutes. Highly recommended! Tinted well for color.

For frosting, it's not too bad.  I'm making cakes for a cake walk, and I need a buttercream to go under the fondant I'm covering them with.  I'm not a frosting fan, so I had the bf test for me.  It was a tossup between this one and Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting, so I made both, making a huge mess in the kitchen, and had him try both.  This one wins handsdown.  I cut out a 1/2 c of the sugar, which makes it a frosting that I can handle, even if I'm not thrilled.  Bf loved this one, so I'm going with this one.  Thanks for the recipe!

FANTASTIC! I never give a recipe 5 stars if I have to change everything about it. Needless to say, this is perfect AS IS! Perfect in every way ... I've made other frostings with heavy cream and I like it better with milk! YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!

This was very good and easy to pipe with. The only alterations I did was using butter instead of margerine and I used 1/2 cup less sugar as I thought it was a little sweet and the consistancy was just as good with the lesser sugar. I did make it both ways!

With a few adjustments, this is the most delicious icing I've ever tasted!  I used about 2 tbs of milk, about a half-cup of instant cocoa mix PLUS a quarter cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.  To get a really great consistency for frosting AND some piping (nothing too complicated), I used 2 cups of confectioner's sugar.  Doubled, the recipe was plenty to cover and fill a 9-inch round cake.  Fantastic!

This is the best frosting I've ever tasted! I've always loved the bakery cakes because of their frosting and this was practically identical. I substituted butter for margerine, though, which worked fine.

Yum!!!  This is irresistible. Lots of compliments.  I used butter instead of margarine.  :)  Also, I had a friend (who was on a diet) eating spoonfuls of this stuff!

This is a great recipe for Butter Cream Frosting!  It has the perfect consistency to use for decorating cakes and spreads easily.  However, next time I will use a little more butter and a little less shortening, but not much.  Perfect and delicious on the Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate cake on this site!

This really kind of tasted like a cheap-grocery-store frosting.  I even used real butter instead of margarine and real cream instead of milk.  What saved mine was adding 3 tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder.  That really seemed to help kill the shortening taste.

The taste of this frosting is good. It was pretty sweet... and it got even sweeter since I had to add several cups of confectioner's sugar to make it suitable for decorating.I also added two table spoons of merigue powder. I was a little disapointed in this though, because I was not expecting to have to add so much sugar.

Wonderful! I love the smooth texture and the versatility of this frosting. I tinted it to be pink, yellow, green, blue and purple and generously frosted 24 cupcakes - and still had plenty of frosting left over. I had to add some more confectioners' sugar to get the consistency that I needed. I used smart balance margarine in place of the margarine and shortening.

This was ok.  I guess I should have stuck to using shortening, but I hate using that stuff.  So I used all butter and it came out ok.  It was also very sweet! I really wanted to like it too since it got all rave reviews. I dont think I will use again.

For my daughter's 5th birthday, I wanted to make a double-layer cake but the frosting you buy at the store isn't enough to cover the extra layer.  I used a boxed white cake mix and frosted it with this.  I added a little purple food coloring and it came out looking great.  It tasted great too.  There was more than enough frosting to cover the cake.  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect!  I used butter and Crisco with great results.  It makes the right amount too.  No extra vat of frosting to use up.  I have finally found what I was looking for!! Thanks!

I was looking for a good recipe to decorate cupcakes, and this was perfect!  At others suggestions, I did use butter instead, butter flavored Crisco, and I also added 1 1/2 teaspoons of butter flavoring in addition to the vanilla extract.  This was the perfect texture for cupcakes and cookies, and makes plenty.

i use the recipe ratios with butter and crisco (original), a bit more vanilla and gradually add sugar and milk alternatly. Taste and adjust according to flavor and comsistancy. I made it looser to spread on the cake and add sugar to stiffen to decorate with. Used it on a castle cake and a doll cake.  Everyone was impressed with flavor and presentation. Tasty fun and versitile!

I didn't love this. I only used 4 cups of sugar like others suggested. And I used smart balance spread. All I could taste was the smart balance. I gave it 4 stars because everyone else seemed to love it. Thanks

Great recipe.  It has a strong powdered sugar taste.  Next time I might lose a half cup powdered sugar and add a bit more butter.  But the boyfriend loved it.  I was pleased that even though my butter was too soft (left it on the hot oven to soften again) the icing didn't seem to mind.  Thick enough that it gave great coverage but went on smooth too.  I had plenty to slather on my cake.

I thought this was very good icing.  I had never tried to make icing from scratch before as I always hated my mom's, so never attempted it.  Everyone really liked it.  Maybe it was just me, but I split up the icing to make different color cupcakes, and when I added the food coloring, it seemed to thin it out and I wish the icing stayed a little thicker. But it was awesome all the same!

Very easy to make... My 7 year old made it... I just helped.  It took less then 2 minutes from start to finish.  I read the other reviews first and cut the sugar back.  I half the recipe.  This was used for cupcakes.

Delicious buttercream.  I substituted a little almond extract for some of the vanilla and only used 4 c powdered sugar.  We frosted about 48 white cupcakes with this amount.

I loved the recipe. Much better than just using butter, as I always have but never have been satisfied with. I think I will try butter flavored shortening next time as others suggested doing.

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and used it on a batch of homemade cinnamon rolls. I also used butter instead of margarine and used butter flavored Crisco for the shortening. It was a big hit with my husband.

this recipe was awesome! I must agree however that the sugar has to be cut in half, even for my sweet tooth. Otherwise, it was smooth and simple to make with a great taste.

This frosting was rich and creamy, though I wouldn't call it smooth. That's why it's rated a 4 not a 5. The frosting resulted kinda gritty. I chose this frosting because it said it was quick and it definetly wasn't that. I took twenty min to beat it and the creaminess was still spoiled by the sand-like texture. Maybe it's because I didn't use the kind of sugar the recipe called for. But other than that, it was perfect with my Devil's Food Cake. It hardens quite nicely when put in the fridge. This frosting is in my "keep" list.

I am used to my butter cream frosting and that was what i was planning to use on a white cake, but I didn't have the recipe, so I used this one instead. I was expecting it to be rather sweet because of all the icing sugar, but this is the best frosting I've ever had! I loved it- not too sweet or powdery. Perfect

This is really good. I only gave it four stars because it is a bit sweet. I cut the sugar in half like some suggested and it was great. After cutting the sugar down, I'd give it five stars.

I was really excited to try this frosting, and made a full batch of it- But i was afraid of having the 'shortning' taste that many commented on. I went to the store and got butter flavored shortning, and had the whole thing in my kitchenaid for maybe 15 minutes? It was certainly creamy and a wonderful consistancy- but you could really feel the confectioner's sugar in the texture of it. Otherwise, i really like this frosting, but i dont know how to get rid of the powdery gritty texture... Add more milk? Id really like to get this recipe to work!  Did anyone else have this issue?

Make sure your ingredients are at room temperature and there are no problems. I mixed by hand and the texture was really GREAT!  I thought it tasted like a pretty good homemade frosting.

This recipe is fabulous! It really compliments the Black Chocolate Cake recipe as well as a lemon cake if you add lemon extract to the frosting! I'v elaso used it on Red Velvet cake and it's very creamy.

I added 1/4 tsp butter flavoring and I think it added a lot to the flavor.  Not an icing chef, I appreciated the tips on room temp and beating it a lot.  I beat my icing for about 8 minytes total and am very happy with the consistency.

Excellent recipe for buttercream frosting!  I made the chocolate version that was listed earlier and it was just wonderful.  I think I'll try the white one another time, but we love chocolate so it's hard not to do the chocolate.  I have 6 kids and I frosted my husband's b-day cake with this frosting and we all loved it!

I made the chocolate version that another reviewer posted.  It was awesome!  I like it better than an other frosting I've tried making and better than store bought frostings. My 2 year old loved it so much she's in the bath now.  I spread on frosting generously and there was still tons left over...good for someone who wants to decorate with tips with the leftovers.

Good tasting frosting.  It is buttery, sweet, creamy, light-cream in color, and works well when decorating with piping tips.  I decreased the amount of sugar to four cups and just kept adding milk until it was a consistency I wanted.  I will use this again.

After I made this and tasted it, I realized that I don't really like grocery store frosting after all.  However, if you do, it is a very nice frosting.  It is light and fluffy and holds up well.  You can definitely taste the shortening, but I guess that's the point.

Yum. I melted some chocolate chips and put them in the frosting. Was good on my german chocolate cake. I also sprinkled some coconut on top.

This is one of the first times that I have actually got the frosting to come out without any lumps.  Needed a frosting for an orange cake, used this recipe and added some orange zest and it did the trick.
