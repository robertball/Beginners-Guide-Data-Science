First I must say I am reviewing the original recipe that appeared in magazine advertisements several years ago. I don't know why they changed the recipe because the original one was great. The differences are...use cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom soup, use 1 1/2  cups milk instead of 2 1/2, use 4 cups cooked penne, which is 2 1/2 cups uncooked or 8 oz., use mozzarella instead of cheddar and use the cheddar French Fried Onions. Put together the same way but bake uncovered for 30 minutes before adding remaining onions and cheese and baking the additional 3 minutes. I did make 2 variations from this recipe, I used 2 cups fully cooked cubed ham instead of the sausage only because my husband doesn't like sausage, and I used half mozzarella and half cheddar. This turned out great and was loved by everyone. The changes I made weren't enough to affect my rating because this would be excellent as written (magazine version). Give it a try.

This is tasty and quick to make.  Not spicy, the soup and cheese make it mellow.  I took away a star purely because of the sodium content.  I would make this again, but would use ground pork with some sage added and make my own cream sauce.  This would be a good recipe to take to a potluck.

My husband, 16 month old and I all loved this!  I used Turkey Smoked Sausage and mini wheel pasta and mixed everything together including the French fried onion and cheese.  I baked covered with aluminum foil for 50 minutes at 375 and then uncovered at same temp for 10 minutes to crisp up top.  Its so rare in our home, with such a young child, to find one dish that everyone can fill up on!  This was actually the 1st time our daughter was offered smoked sausage to eat - and she loved it!  Still does!

Skipped the French-fried onions as I didn't have any. Added some julienne carrots to get another vegetable in the mix. It tasted even better the next day in my lunch!

My boyfriend and I thought this was a solid 4 casserole recipe.  I did tweak it slightly by skipping the french-fried onions and adding spices (onion powder, garlic powder, pepper and a few red pepper flakes).  I also added a bit more cheese than called for and used rotini instead of penne.  The suggestion about stirring partly through the cooking time was a good idea.  My boyfriend would like to add that more cheese is always better.

Very yummy and filling. This is a crowd pleaser! I substituted frozen green beans for peas, because we hate peas! After eating it, we all agreed that it could have used more green beans. I think next time I'll add two cups of green beans. I also think a lighter cheese would be better. Maybe shredded parmesan at the end or monterey jack or even provolone. I feel like Cheddar was a bit much for the meal. I also substituted linguisa (Italian sausage) instead of what the recipe called for.  It is wonderful though. I really recommend it to others!

Good comfort food.  It's very rich, so don't over do it.  I changed it using whole wheat noodles and turkey sausage and it turned out great!  I also used low sodium soup.

I will never make this again! After the 45 minutes it still had alot of liquid and the pasta wasn't quite cooked. I took the foil off and baked for about 10 more minutes. The whole thing just tasted like peas. Gross!

I thought this was very easy and tasted great!  My 2 yr. old loved it too!  I used a lean sausage to help with the calories, but that did not take away from the flavor. Very hearty and filling!

To the browning sausage I added 1 onion diced and 1 clove of garlic minced.  I also added a little more cheese than was called for.  This was an excellent dish that everybody loved, especially me who only had a casserole dish and a skillet to clean up after making a casserole!!!  Loved it!!

This recipe was good.  Very rich, and casserole-like simple favors.  My husband and I agree the smoked sausage tastes a bit like you made it with hot dogs.  I may try with Italian sausage next time.

This is a very tasty and easy recipe. I deducted a star because of calories content. I added broccoli and substituted sausage with ham. I suggest mixing the cream sauce ingredients over the stove top (soup, milk and cheese) before cooking it in the oven. This allows for a more even and creamier texture and also speeds the cooking process along.

Good. I precooked the noodles. Added mixed veggis and red peppers. Put cheese and onions on top for last 5 minutes.

I made this last night for me and my boyfriend, and we both loved it!  He is a super picky eater, but he said it's a re-do dinner for sure.  I added a bit more pasta than it called for because it just looked too soupy.  I also added more french fried onions as well.  Turned out perfect.  At first I thought it was going to be a bust because after 45 minutes it was soupy and the pasta wasn't done.  I cooked it for 10 more minutes, and then took the foil off, added more cheese and onions and let bake for about 5 more minutes.  I let it sit for about 7 minutes, and it thickened up quick, and the pasta was perfect.

YUM.  We couldn't stop eating it!  The only changes I made were to use cream of asparagus soup because I prefer it and added corn.  Hubby thought it was certainly a keeper and had 3rds...very rare for him!

If I make this again, I would layer the pasta, peas, sausage, cheese, and onions. Mixing it together prevented some of the pasta from baking. I would add carrots too.

Really good.  I had the smoked sausage and did a search and this was one of the recipes that came up.  I had all of the ingredients so it was the one.  Was a bit short on the FF onion rings and I think they would have made it better.  I couldn't believe that the pasta would cook but it did.  Not a great recipe but good and filling and quick to make.

pretty good casserole.  I went with some suggestions from a reviewer who talked about the "original recipe" Used cream of celery instead of mushroom.  I precooked the noodles, decreased the milk to 1 1/2 cups and added chedder cheese along with some onion powder and seasoning salt to milk soup combo.  Baked 350 for 20 min, then topped with the fried onions and colby jack cheese/mozz cheese.

I followed this recipe about 80% of the way and it turned out fabulous!   Here's what I did: I used 6 spinach and asiago flavored chicken sausages cut up and sauted until browned with 1.5 diced green pepper and about 1c of diced onion, sauted all in olive oil until onions were tender.  I par-boiled the noodles because I hate the way uncooked noodles come out in casseroles.  Drained pasta and added it to sausage mixture, as well as two cans of cream of mushroom soup and about 1.5c milk.  Mixed everything together and poured into a large casserole dish, topped with cheddar flavored French-fried onions, and sprinkled a mixture of cheddar, mozz., and colby cheeses on top.  Baked at 350 for about 30 mins until the top was lightly browned.  I made a large glass casserole dish full of this. This was fantastic and both my bf and I went back for more.

Great meal, horrible fat content!  Used skim milk and skim cheese and turkey sausage-should lower the fat content considerably!

I have made this dish several times now. In fact there is a pan of this in the oven right now. :) I change mine just a bit. I use cream of chicken (don't like mushroom),Rotini instead of Penne (no particular reason),broccoli instead of peas(can't stand peas) and leave out the onions. This is a delicious dish!! I have tried with chicken too and its good but the sausage makes it pop!

This was okay.  My husband and 3-year old daughter didn't like it too much.  I would probably have it again though but won't make it anymore because of them.  Possibly using the suggestion of another reviewer of making it according to the old magazine advertisement directions would make it taste better.  I used the turkey smoked sausage.  I noticed another reviewer said it had too much liquid.  When you first get it out of the oven, it has a lot of liquid and is bubbly.  But once it sets for 5 minutes, the pasta absorbs most of the remaining liquid and creates a good consistency.

This was an awesome recipe! I did change a few things however! Instead of using pasta I substituted potatoes in! I added salt and pepper and cooked it a longer just to make sure the potatoes got done. It's delicious and creamy! I will be making this again! :)

I have made this recipe twice.  Once exactly as directed and tonight with quite a few modifications.  The first time I enjoyed it but the second time it was much better.  First I par-cooked the whole wheat penne noodles to insure thorough cooking and less oven time.  Secondly, I browned the sausage (turkey) with some onion, garlic and red bell pepper (left over that needed to be used up).  Third, I combined the  reduced fat cream of mushroom, 1.5 C skim milk and 1 C reduced fat colby jack (all I had) along with a dash of cayenne pepper and heated it on the stove until the cheese had melted.  Finally I combined everything, along with 1/2 C peas and 1/2 C corn (left over, as well).  I covered everything with another sprinkling of cheese and covered with foil, baking for 20 min.  After 20 minutes, I removed the foil and topped with some herbed buttered bread crumbs combined with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, which I sprinkled over the top (I didn't have any French Fried Onions).  This was very good.  Thanks for the great recipe. It's simple and easy and though not terribly healthful, it's excellent comfort food.  The modifications I've made, though more work, made for faster cook time and allowed everything to blend better.

This was good and yes, the kids liked it (a huge plus) After reading other reviews I decided to use turkey sausage; I also partially cooked the noodles, used cream of celery soup, and added 1 1/2c milk instead of 2 1/2.  The only alteration I made on my own was that, instead of ff onions, I used crushed potato chips (and no cheese on top-- didn't need it)  Honestly, I think you could easily omit the fattening toppers altogether and still have a mild, tasty, and kid-friendly comfort meal. I'll make it again

It was good enough to eat the one serving the first night, but I can't bring myself to eat the leftovers, which is unheard of. I don't know what it is about it. It's creamy, salty, chewy, crunchy; has meat, carbs, veggies; you can use healthy substitutions...I just wasn't a huge fan. Thanks, though!

I love this dish, and so does my boyfriend.  I see a lot of people say the pasta isn't cooked in 45 minutes, but I have been making this for years and I have never had an issue with the pasta not cooking.  I tweek this recipe just slightly.  I add mushrooms and I put all the cheese and french fried onions on top instead of mixing some of it in then putting the rest on top at the end.  It makes a great crunchy crust.  Definitely not a dish to make if you are watching your weight.

This recipe is really easy and my whole family loved it. The only issue for me personally is that the sausage did give a hot dog taste. So I might try a different sausage.

A touch on the salty side, so next time i will use low salt sausage and that should help.  If you have problems with the noodles cooking fully, just give the casserole a stir halfway through.  It is only the ones on top because they aren't in the liquid.   Over all, very tasty.  My boyfriend absolutely LOVED it!  I will making this again on a regular basis.

Delicious!  I made it as the recipe is written, only adding a can of mushrooms to the mix.    Everything came out perfect!  I had no issues with excess liquid or uncooked pasta, and it tasted fantastic.  This one is going into rotation for sure!

I used mini bowtie pasta & half & half instead of milk.  I didn't  have shredded cheddar so I used smoked Gouda.  I also didn't have french fried onions so I crunched up some Cheeze-its.  Hubby said it was delicious & please make it again!

I made this for dinner last night. My fiancé said to add it to one of his favorite dishes. He is a picky eater. I didn’t have any French fried onions so that was left out. Next time I will try it with them. I did add a little garlic powder to the sausage as I browned it. Thank you for the recipe. 5 stars for ease, flavor & not a lot of ingredients. I usually have most of that on hand at any time.

Instead of using penne I used egg noodles.  I also doubled the recipe since our family is quite large. I had to almost triple the cook time to get the noodles done. I will make it again but I'll cook the noodles ahead of time.

First time making it, I've let it cook 30 minutes per directions & the pasta wasn't done so I'm letting it cook another 15 minutes & we'll see if it cooks all the way through. If I make this again I will par boil the pasta & then mix everything together.

This was better than I expected. (I'm always wary of easy recipes). I omitted the cheese (I don't NEED it) and only used about 1/4 or so of the pasta.  I sub mixed vegs for the peas and only had about 3/4 cup fried onions, which I stirred all into the dish. It turned out nice and saucy. I may add a bit more veggies next  time.

Quick and easy.  Substituted Garlic Chicken for Sausage.  Hillshire Farms makes a Garlic Chicken.  Love this recipe.  I don't typically measure my ingredients. I eyeball them.  And it was Amaze-balls!

This has been one of my go to meals every month since I discovered it in 2009. Just for reference, add 1/2 cup more milk than advertised, that ensures less burnt to a crisp pasta. Also, add 10-15 minutes more to cooking time if you are not using the recommended size baking dish.

Very good.  I also added onions and minced garlic when browning the sausage. I added a little  more cheese, a little salt and pepper and Mrs. Dash.  In addition to the peas I added some corn.  One thing I did do differently was cook the pasta and mix it all together and bake it for only 15-20 minutes.

This recipe is very good, my whole family likes it. I don't use the peas, and I throw in a handful of mushrooms as well. So good!

The original recipe called for Cream of Celery soup and mozzarella cheese which is what makes this so good.  This is a great one-dish meal that is perfect for using the oven timer so dinner is ready when you get home.  My husband and kids love this dish so much that it has become a regular on our recipe rotation.

This was very tasty and a big hit with my husband.  The I read the nutritional info and about had a stroke.  If you're looking for a good, hearty tasting meal, this is great.  If you don't have room to gain a few extra pounds, you'll want to perhaps keep looking.

I made this for dinner tonight. I used cream of celery soup since we hate mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It is not a gourmet recipe but it was tasty and filling and surprisingly creamy. I will be making this again.

I have never made a casserole using uncooked noodles, so I was a little worried how this one would turn out. I added extra cheddar cheese, and it turned out to be a pretty tasty meal! Easy and quick to make. This one is a keeper!

Made a couple of changes: Added broccoli instead of peas, 1/2 cup of corn, apple chicken sausage and only 2 cups of milk.  The consistency was great and it tasted FANTASTIC!  My husband LOVED it!  Probably not the healthiest of meals due to all the salt, hence the 4 stars.

We loved this recipe and the only thing I did different was that I cooked the pasta separately so it didn't have to be in the oven for 45 minutes.  It is 90 today so wanted to keep the oven at a minimum.   I may try green beans or other veggies too.

I followed the recipe as written.   However, even before it was done, I was wondering if the recipe has everything right.   The 2.5 cups of milk was way too much and the 8 ounces of uncooked penne pasta was too little.   Also, this recipe needs to be spiced up a little.   It's just a dull, uninteresting dish.

My boyfriend and I were looking to try something new and came across this, it was really good he went back for seconds and loved it even more every time. The only thing that I would change is the amount of Sausage used, and it didn't seem to have alot of sauce. Other then that it was awesome!!

I added 1/2 cup extra liquid at the advice of other reviewers and it turned out like soup.  I uncovered it and let it bake longer, but the pasta had a weird consistency and the flavor was lacking.  Definitely won't make it again.

Great easy dish. I had to bake a little longer for the noodles to be completely cooked and I used other veggies because I am not a fan of peas. I did not have french fried onions but it was a great dish, I love those crunchy things so I will be sure to get them soon.

Followed the recipe and the pasta was not done after 45 minutes, baked for another 15 minutes and it was done. This was ok, but kind of bland! I added some spices and it was alright, but we will probably not try this again.

This dish was excellent! I added onion and red pepper to the sausage. I also added more milk as I figured the sauce would be a little too thick for me. Added some spice and pepper to the sauce and ommitted the french fried onion. It came out perfect! No kidding when the other reviewers say this dish is VERY rich, so be careful not to overdo it with additions! Highly recommend as a potluck dish and quick to make.

pretty good... i normally wouldnt have choosen this kind of casserole but I had all the ingredients on hand and it was super easy to make. My hubby and my three year old liked it but i would say this is more of a casual meal recipe...lunch like. Good taste and flavor..might add a can of green beans instead of the frozen peas next time.

I used 1 lb each of smoked & flavorful spinach asiago chicken sausage we'd gotten from Sam's & grilled. It was a little bland. I think if I make it again, I'll add some red pepper flakes and maybe some spicy sausage or something to pep it up. Also, everyone complained there were too many peas, so maybe cut that in half & add a second veggie?

This was very easy to make!  I used turkey sausage and used green beans instead of the peas and also added a can of mushrooms.  I used reduced sodium mushroom soup since the onions tend to add so much salt.  I also mixed the cheese into the casserole and didn't add any extra onions to the top.  It was still very rich, but over all good.  My kids even ate it!

This is wonderful, very good, easy to make. I substituted green beans for the peas since I didn't have peas. I didn't have the french fried onions, but it was great without them. I'd love it with them too. I will make this again, love dishes I can make using sausage.

I'm not a huge sausage fan, so my opinion is tempered a little, but my family loved this meal.

I was just not digging this recipe at all although my husband loved it but I have already told him I will not be making it again.

My boyfriend and I are considering eating more meat and instead of using sausage, I used mushrooms. The taste was amazing! We really liked it and will definitely cook it again.
