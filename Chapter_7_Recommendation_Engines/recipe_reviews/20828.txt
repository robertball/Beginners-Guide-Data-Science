Needs 1/4-1/2 cup added flour.  With mods, really good - otherwise bland.  Mods: 1) Use 2 cups bread, 1 cup wheat, and 1/3 cup all-purpose flour.  Instead of white sugar, use 2 tbls molasses and 2 tbls honey.  Double cinnamon and go heavy on nutmeg.

Great recipe! Made this twice and my husband, kids, and friends at work loved it. Had to add about 1/2 cup extra bread flour as the dough looked too sticky. Will definitely be making this one again and again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My loaf seemed really dense.  I noticed that the dough wasn't as firm as usual, so I added some flour.

I use apple butter (home made recipe from here-the crockpot one-I just up the spices), and apple cider because that is what I have on hand this time of year.  

Using apple butter I can skip the sugar and spices in the recipe too.  If I had to use applesauce I would double the cinnamon in the recipe if not even triple.  I would also add a few dashes of all spice and about 4-5 shakes of cloves because I like my apple stuff with lots of spice!  I measure out the apple butter and cider and pop it in the microwave until it warms up to 110 degrees.

I also use 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 bread flour trying to up the 'health factor' a bit.  I skip the butter and use canola oil. 
 
I don't measure the shredded apples I just used two-skin and all.

I also added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans at my 'add in' beep of my machine.

1 package of dry yeast equals 2 1/2 tsp of yeast.

Stand by your bread machine until this mixes a bit because, depending on the size/type/water content of your apples, you  may need to add some more flour.  I just spoon it over the dough until it looks and rolls around in a nice ball.

WONDERFUL recipe.  This makes GREAT toast!

Easy to make in the bread machine, as stated.  My husband and kids really enjoyed it.  Quite dense, without the texture of a sweet bread - kind of in between a yeast bread and a sweet bread.  Not my favorite, but I will make it again for my family since they liked it so much.

I made this with really high expectations and I was a bit disappointed.  It was pretty good bread; however, I really was looking for a more appley cinnamony bread.  I probably won't try this one again.

This is pretty good!  I made the dough in the bread machine then took it out and finished it off in the oven at 375 for 40 mins.  I didn't have nutmeg, so I used pumpkin pie spice--about a teaspoon, and I also increased the cinnamon to a teaspoon.  This bread seemed to me to want to have fruit in it, so I added dried cherries in.  I wish I'd added more!  I also didn't shred the apple but chopped it, and I like how there were some moist chunks of apple in the bread as a result. This is a nice bread for breakfast or pb & j sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!  I was too lazy to shred the apple, so I used some extra apple sauce. The dough seemed pretty moist when it was kneading, so I kept dumping in more wheat flour, probably at least a 1/2 cup more. I also didn't have any nutmeg, so I skipped it....It was delicious, my favorite bread so far!

Wonderful recipe!  It's a very dense, but extremely moist bread.  It also has basically no fat in it, which makes it just a carb-rich, guiltless bread!  My alterations:  I didn't have any apples so I left those out, but added just a smidgin more of the applesauce and apple juice to make up for it.  Also added more cinnamon.

This bread is delicious!  My whole family loved it!  I didn't have nutmeg so used some Allspice instead, and I also had to add a little more flour, but this is a great recipe!  I highly recommend it!

I used molasses instead of the sugar, upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp, and the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp., and subbed 1 cup whole wheat flour for one of the white flour.  Great spicy bread with chunks of juicy apple (I didn't shred the apple, I chopped it!).  Frosted with a brown sugar-cinnamon glaze, this made a very tasty breakfast bread!

This was a great tasting bread and a good amount of apple flavor. A little dense, but I would make it again.

Good recipe that I've made twice now. I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and extra pinch of nutmeg. It did come out a little to moist but great bread to toast and butter up.

Husband and teen daughter loved it.  My daughter and her friend ate half the loaf in 3 minutes.  Out of necessity I used two containers of diced pears in juice for kids lunches plus 1 apple sauce.  Gave me the right amount of fruit and juice and sauce,  They liked it because it was not too sweet. They could make a sandwich out of it.  They thought it had honey it in.  Did not realize it was apples.  I got a full 2 lb. loaf.  Hubby put honey ham on it and thought it was scrumptious.

Excellent!

Followed rsogburn's modifications (2 cups bread flour, 1 cup wheat, 1/3 cup all-purpose, replace white sugar with 2tbsp honey and 2tbsp molasses) Since I didn't have nutmeg, I added even more cinnamon (1 1/2 tsp). Also just chopped the apple instead of shredding it, following other reviews.

I used the sweet bread setting and put the apple in midway through the knead cycle when the breadmaker indicated. If you do this, beware since the dough gets wetter after you add the apple! The second time through I had to add some extra flour to combat this.

Came out great -- good apple taste but not overwhelming.   The final product was good with honey on top.

Not very apple-y but too much apple to be an all purpose bread.
