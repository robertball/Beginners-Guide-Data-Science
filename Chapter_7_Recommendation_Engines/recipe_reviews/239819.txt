This recipe was quite tasty and fun to boot. I would have loved artichokes but hubby is not a fan so I used black olives instead which worked fine too. This is a perfect summertime lunch that won't leave you feeling weighted down with all of the bread in your typical egg salad sandwich. Plus, who doesn't love food on a stick? This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing Buckwheat Queen!
