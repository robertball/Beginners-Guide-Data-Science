Delicious and healthy! I didn't have the patience to stir the chopped avocado until it became creamy so I just left it chunky.

This was good- used canned instead of fresh mushrooms but will use fresh next time. Also used onions instead of shallots as it was what I had on hand. My husband ate it and usually does not eat avocado. It wasn't my absolute favorite in taste but was definitely good and I'll make it again as I'm on whole30! I'm sure fresh mushrooms and shallots would change the flavor a bit for the better. Thanks for the recipe!
