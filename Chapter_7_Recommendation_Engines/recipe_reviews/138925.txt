My first time making risotto solo and it came out perfectly! Mine took quite a bit longer than etimated, and used more liquid, but I made it in a deep skillet rather than a saucepan, which may have affected the speed of evaporation/absorbtion...I don't know. Anyway, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I followed it exactly (which includes the 'as needed' and 'until' parts of the recipe) and it worked like a charm. Risotto is not at all hard to make, but it is certainly boring and time consuming - so it probably won't happen often at my house, but was definitely worth trying. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  You will have to stir this for a good 20 minutes but like was mentioned, it is well worth it.  I added a clove of garlic to sautee at the beginning and then added 2 bay leaves to the warm vegetable stock.  My family loved it.  I will use this one again for sure.

I have never eaten risotto before, much more cooked it.  It was FABULOUS!  My only slight variation was I couldn't find whole Parmesan to grate, so I used the shredded type; it melted right in.  Also, when I cooked the shallots on medium high, they burned right away -- so I started over and cooked everything down a notch.

This came out GREAT! I only used the baby bellas because that was available.  If you have any reservations about trying to make risotto, try this receipe--it's easy and the results are awesome.

This recipe is almost perfect.  It was my 2nd time making risotto and the last time I made way too much.  I cut the recipe and I still ended up with a lot of left over.

This recipe is very good. I used canned vegetable stock. I found it to be a little salty so next time I will not add the celery salt.

Thanks for your recipe. I make risotto at least once a week and use leftover risotto to make little fried rice patties for lunch the next day. Here are some of my tips for making any risotto. Always use low sodium broths for risotto and keep the broth at a low simmer in a saucepan when adding it to the rice whilst cooking. Cook the risotto in a heavy bottomed Dutch oven or similar pan, it will hold the heat better and reduce total cooking/stirring time. The butter is a nice touch but adds little flavor to the risotto, I'd omit it and reduce the fat content of the dish. This is a great dish to start young cooks in the kitchen. Under supervision, get the kids to stir the rice during the cooking. Kids involved in food preparation tend to eat more new things at an earlier age. Thanks for the share.

Yummy! Used shiitake mushrooms only and skipped the celery salt, but it was still delicious.

I only used shiitake mushrooms and it was very good.  I am not a big mushroom person, but it was so creamy and tasty.  Worth the effort!

My husband high-fived me after we ate this. It's delicious and hardy, and we're definitely doing it again. I did end up adding quite a bit of water at the end to get the rice tender, but I used regular white rice so that may have been part of the reason. Also used dried herbs because that's what I had on and and because fresh parsley is disgusting.

Yum! I would add a little cayenne to the shallots, and put the thyme in a little later.

This recipe has too much white wine. I followed the recipe exactly using half the amount of white wine and it still turned out too acidic.

pure deliciousness.   I used portobellos mushrooms sliced thin - since I couldn't find the shitake and cremini.  Also I used chicken broth instead of veggie.  The chicken broth added more flavor however I could taste that it was the powered kind.  I think I may use the premade box broth next time.  I didn't have fresh thyme so used the dried.

The recipe is great! I switched recipes to serve 3 people, and it was plenty!  I cooked it in a large pan, so I needed quite a bit more liquid, but just used hot water like the recipe said. I only had Shiitake mushrooms, and used the same amount of both combined- was so delicious! I did add a little minced garlic. Great recipe!!

Loved this. I love salty, and I didn't find this overly salty at all. I added. I used dried thyme instead of fresh. I also used Marsala wine. Very flavorful- for sure a hit with anyone who loves mushrooms.

I make asparagus risotto all the time, but decided that I wanted to try mushrooms this time.  This recipe calls for about 3x the amount of wine that I normally use (NOT a bad thing!!).  I followed it exactly as written and was thrilled with the results!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Excellent. I used one clove of garlic and onion instead of shallot. I also substituted the thyme and parsley with basil and oregano because that's what I have in the garden. It was delicious.
