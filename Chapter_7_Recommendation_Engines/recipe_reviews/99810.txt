This was very easy to make, and was pretty good.  I used Hormel pre-cooked bacon that just needed to be microwaved, and it was surprisingly crispy but not burned.  I spooned some of the sauce over the chicken, and would not recommend this because the teriyaki sauce was a little overpowering.

This was pretty good and easy to make.  The green onions and bacon really "make" the recipe.

This was good.  But the sauce dried out at the high temperature.  I would cover it for part of the cooking time.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I covered it for most of the baking time.   It was good, my husband and kids ate it - but it was very dry.  I will make it again though, as we really liked the flavor.  But next time, I will use Chicken Thighs, instead of breasts.  Personal preference.

I served this with the sweet green bean bundles (bacon and brown sugar green beans) and it was a hit!  Very easy and a total hit with the kids!
