I've told several people about this recipe and they all love it.  My mom always asks "do you have any more great recipes like THAT ONE".  I did change it a bit.  I'm doing the DIET thing so I use boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Also it doesn't need the butter or the wine.  I put all the dry ingredients into a ziplock bag and with one clean hand sprinkle this mixture on the chicken, flipping it and padding it in with your BAD (chicken) hand.  I then put the ziplock bag into the fridge for next weeks dinner, I can actually get several meals out of one recipe.  Bake at 350 for 45min or until done.  Also use the powdered like parmesan cheese that you find in the isle not in the fridge. It sticks to the chicken better then the grated parmesan that is truly grated into little strips.

Used skinless, boneless breasts, soaked in Ranch dressing for about an hour first.  Didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs, so made crumbs from Ranch flavored almond/rice crackers. And, hubby doesn't like wine in the chicken so left that out.  What a surprise!  Everyone loved it.  Nice and juicy, wonderful flavors.  Will make this again for sure.  Thanks Christy!

Tastes delicious! Turned out tasting like chicken kiev with all of the butter. Changes I made: 1/2 the amount of wine, cooked uncovered the whole time, put on the wine 1/2way through cooking, cooked a total of 35 minutes. Also, I dipped the chicken in butter before breading to help it stick.

Awwwwsommmmme...wow this was incredible...mmm..mm. Instead of using a whole chicken we used chicken breast. We did 4 breasts in an 8" x 8" glass casserole dish and reduced the cooking time to 30 min. We cooked it for 20 min., then we added the 1/2 cup of Pinot Grigio and cooked for another 10 min.

Thanx Mom!!!!

I have made this several times and everyone loves it. I use boneless breasts and it's wonderful, especially with rice.  My son doesn't like it because of the wine, however all grown ups love it!

Excellent.  I marinaded the chicken breasts in a little dressing for about 40 minutes before coating them with the seasoning mix.  This recipe is extremely easy on the prep time, but marinating plus cooking time required a couple of hours, so it's not a last-minute recipe.  The chicken was moist and the crust delicious.  It will go in the frequently-used section of my recipe book.

I made this with 4 chicken brests and had way too much bredding left over.  However, the chicken was so tender and tasty it was a great change of pace!

10/13/10Got a thumbs up from 11 yr old daughter & an "I'll have that chicken tomorrow, too"!  With not adding the wine or butter, & considering some said it was bland, I made changes.  Used 2# chicken strips (soaked them in a little buttermilk while mxing coating); 1 1/2t salt, 1/2t pepper, 1/4t garlic, 1/4t paprika, 1/8t thyme, 1/8t basil, 1/4c italian bread crumbs, 1/4c parmesan cheese (powdery cannister type).  I barely had enough coating, but if I'd not cut into strips, it would've been fine. I sauteed in half butter, half olive oil.  Be sure to add enough to pan (before adding chicken) - 1/4c or more - so chicken will brown & not stick to pan.  Served it over leftover egg noodles & a simple marinara sauce.  More parmesan (real, not cannister, this time) & parsley on top.  A good inapinch recipe - everything's on hand.  1/1/12 Upped this another star since the boy one, 14, liked it, too.  I baked 'em this time & they weren't as good.  Not a surprise, but I guess if you're in for the mess, it's worth it. 3/2012 'Tried w/o parmesan in the coating.  'Immediately sprinkled some over the chicken after flipping.  I thought it tasted very similar, but those kids said it wasn't as good.  I said it's less mess.  Kids said it wasn't as good.  Kids.  >:/ :)  Love 'em.

I wanted a crispy finish to the chicken so I eliminated the wine step and served the Pinot Grigio with the meal. Also, I deleted the butter as it is really not needed and doubled all the seasonings except the salt. I used fresh diced garlic instead of powered garlic as I prefer the flavour. My family loved it but would have liked more of the paprika flavour to come through. So I will up that by another 1/2 tbsp next time.

Made this using more garlic and less wine using only 2 very large bone in split breasts. It was so good. The wine steamed the chicken from the bottom, leaving the top perfectly crispy. Mine cooked in 50 minutes on convection. I will definately make this again!

Made it for dinner tonight and it got two thumbs up from my husband and daughter!  I used boneless breasts and followed the cooking time recommended by another reviewer (30 minutes then ten minutes).  Served with rice and spooned leftover sauce over the rice which was yummy.  this is a quick and easy recipe for dinner on a work night, less than an hour from start to table!

This recipe is a keeper! I used chicken breasts, as many others did, and it was so moist. I was afraid to pour the wine over the chicken, thought it would make it soggy, but that must be the reason for success! I used sherry- wonderful, hubby loved, too.

I made a slightly modified version of this recipe and my family devoured it. My very picky 6 year old had seconds :) This is a great recipe and can be modified if you need to (which was my case because of what I had on hand) This is the reason I'm giving it 5 stars.

Great recipe. Used dried parsley and turned out great. To spice up add a little more cayenne and season with red pepper flakes when out of oven. Great dinner for parties too - easy to make and looks/smells elegant.

Really good flavor!  I only had four thighs but still used the whole amount of seasoning which was a little much, but the flavor of this was really good.  Next time I will drain some of the fat before adding the wine and not pour the wine over the chicken because it turned the nice crispy top a little mushy.  Not bad at all, but it would have been better to leave it as is.

I used chicken breasts instead of a cut-up chicken. I also quadrupled the spices. The end result was nice--this made for very flavorful chicken breasts, which is what I was looking for as well as a quick dinner for one tired Mama. I'll make this again. GREAT with rice and roasted vegetables.

Delicious! I have already made this twice since discovering the recipe. I always add a little extra --- lots of extra parmesan, extra seasoning and, of course, extra wine. This is pretty easy to make and a restaurant-quality taste.

This was a good recipe. However, although my father and his friend were greatly impressed, I was not. It lacked oomph. This may be because I left out the wine bit, because we didn't have any on hand and I am not legal to purchase alcohol, but I suppose I expected the spices to be a bit more prominant. I will most certainly have to tinker with the seasoning, but it was decent as it was.

I used two chicken breasts and cut the rest of the ingredients in half. Tasty, but nothing spectacular. Worth a try.

Delish! I had no problem getting the coating to stick. I used chicken breast and pounded to the same thickness for even baking. The butter makes the breading crunchy, but the wine is not necessary - it made the bottom soggy. I will leave that out of the recipe next time and skip the salt. The cheese gave it enough saltiness.

I made this for dinner guests, and it was a huge hit!! I'll definitely be making this again. Chicken was so tender and tasty-melt in your mouth. I used boneless chicken breasts. One of the best chicken dishes I've made-& easiest!

We enjoyed this chicken, very tender and juicy.  I used split chicken breasts with the skin on, but I think I would like it better without skin so that the meat could soak up some of the flavor.  I think I would make this again with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

This was my first time making Parmesan chicken-- and I highly recommend this recipe! Instead of using a whole chicken, I used 5 boneless/skinless chicken breasts and cut them into 2x2's. I didn't use wine at the end, but it still turned out very good. I agree about shaving off the cooking time by 5-10 minutes, I was able to cook it in approx. 30-35 mins.

My very picky son and husband LOVED this, not to mention me, lol.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of the wine.  I used spaghetti sauce instead.  Paired it with whole wheat spaghetti noodles and romaine salad.  Fantastic!

This marinate for the chicken was great. I did have to make several changes just cause I didn't have the ingredients on hand.  I put corn flakes cereal in a chopper and make it into the crumbs, used garlic salt, and didn't use fresh parmesan but the canned one, plus garlic powder. I make only half a whole chicken but next time I will either use only dark meat or white meat since the breast cook much faster and they did come out kind of dry by the time the dark meat was done.  Flavor was awesome. I also used it in covering pork chops. I marinated the pork chops in the wine over nice and then coated them with the marinate put them in a wire wrack and baked them for about 45mins. The last 5 mins I turned on the broil to get them that crisp texture....they were great next time I will cut done the cooking time to about 30mins.

This was very good, but shave off the cooking time by 5-10 minutes. I cooked it a few minutes less and it was still a tad dry. I also used panko bread crumbs, and subbed sherry for the wine. Very good with rice! I just poured the butter over the chicken in the dish, and sprinkled the breading over.

Tasty and so easy. I used chicken and marinated for 1 hour in a balsamic dressing. I don't think I would use 1/2 cup of wine next maybe just 1/4 cup there was a lot of juices

Loved this!  I read other reviews and made a few changes as well. I used boneless skinless chicken breast. I dipped in egg before putting on bread crumbs.  I also melted 2 TBL of butter & drizzled on chicken breast and eliminated the remainder of the butter. It was very moist and tasty!

I used skinless, boneless chicken breast. Followed the recipe exactly. However, I only baked the chicken for 20 minutes total. After 10 minutes I added the wine. Worked out very well. I made enough to have "leftovers". Took those pieces out earlier so they won't be too dry. Great recipe.

Great rececipe, but I did make some changes.  Used scant amount of olive oil on top of chx instead of butter.  Since we are such garlic lovers, I used chopped garlic in addition to garlic powder. Eliminated the salt and used three boneless breasts sliced into three pieces each.   No need to use dressing to coat chx as others suggested.  Put all dry ingredients in zipped bag, added chx, and left in refrig for 45 minutes.   Yummy!

This was fantastic!  I was pleasantly surprised because I wasn't sure I would appreciate the wine added at the end.  I used cutlets, and soaked them in buttermilk for about a half hour prior to coating them with the cheese/crumb mixture.  This entree was perfect and was gone in one sitting.  Unfortunately,  there are-no leftovers!

The seasoning on this chicken parm was amazing.  I threw in a few extra seasonings, just an extra shake here and there, but it was fantastic.  I used thin sliced chicken breast and dipped them in egg before coating.  Cooked for about 10 minutes, then flipped over.  Cooked for another 5 minutes, then covered each breast in marinara sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese, and cooked another 5 minutes or so.  Obviously changed the recipe a little, but it was a great base and the chicken turned out perfectly seasoned and juicy.  Served with spaghetti and garlic bread.  Definitely making this one again!

Amazing dish!!!  It's so tender, and the flavor is awesome.  My very picky 4 year old loves it :)

(we also use just chicken breasts and just don't cook it quite as long - delicious!)

So good!  The entire family approved and asked that it become a regular.  Like others, I found after trying to get cry mixture to coat the chicken I needed to dip in an egg-mixture first.  This did the trick.  I also put under the broiler for just a couple of minutes to crisp up the outside.  Otherwise, followed recipe completely.  Thanks for a winner!

I received 2 thumbs up from my husband & daughter.  This is a very tasty recipe.  I had 4 boneless chicken breasts.  I cut them in half, pounded them a little flat.  Basically a Scallopini.  I used sherry too.  We'll be making this again.  I did not use egg, ranch dressing or anything else to adhere the crumb mixture to the chicken.  It stuck on just fine.  Using the fine grated Parmesan cheese rather than freshly grated I think helped.

This was fabulous w/some changes made--I used a bit more garlic (3/4 tsp) Used different cheeses (mix of asiago, romano, parm for breading-same measure. 2 tbls butter is more than enough with the juice from chicken and wine. 
I also marinated in ranch dressing for 1 hr in ziploc bag, into egg wash then put dry bread/chesse coating on--sprinkled on and patted in (saves crumb mixture for later)
Cooked uncoved for 25 minutes--took out, poured 1/2 cup dry white wine, then covered each chicken breast w/slice of mozzarella cheese and put back in oven uncovered for approx 15 minutes or to safe temp (I used only chicken breasts for this recipe & they were thick)
My husband doesn't like white meat, but these were by far the moistest chicken breasts I have ever had--he asked me to PLEASE make this dish often ;-)

Fantastic blend of seasonings - it was great.  I made just a few changes: I let the chicken soak in buttermilk for about an hour first and then I made the breading as the recipe says.  However, I let it finish in the oven; I did not do the wine step.  I wanted the chicken crusty on the outside and thought that by adding the liquid at the end it would make it soggy.  I used the amounts listed for the breading but only used 2 chicken breasts.  It would not be enough breading if you were doing more than that - in my opinion.

Now this recipe is superb. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and  followed the directions exactly, except instead of melting the butter, I dabbed it on the chicken. The chicken was sooo tender and tasty...mmmm and, I am fussy - I'll be sure to make it again!! I fail to understand why anyone would rate this less than 5 stars. Thanks for sharing Christy

Made last night for a semi-quick Sunday night dinner and they were yummy! I decreased the parm & bread crumbs to 1/3 c each, but left the spices the same since I only had three breasts.  Cooked 20 min's added the wine and cooked an additional 10 min. I sliced the breasts in 1/2" slices, fanned out on our plates then drizzled a little of the wine drippings over both the chicken & some homemade mashed po's - my husband & I totally enjoyed - VERY MOIST!

This is good, flavorful chicken. The only thing I did differently was dip the chicken in egg first and then the mixture. Also it took my chicken about an hour to cook but that's probably because I used big drumsticks. ***And as I was just reading the reviews I realized that I totally forgot to add the wine and it still turned out good. and I forgot to cover it.

Made this with chicken tenders and they were a bit dry (due to the meat, not the recipe).  Didn't use the wine, and only used 1T. butter.  Used panko instead of bread crumbs.  Very good recipe.  Would be great with fish (halibut, rockfish) as well.  I bought some boneless chicken thighs to make it again tomorrow.  They should be more moist than the tenders.  Will definitely keep this as an easy go to recipe. Thanks!

This recipe worked really well, and I was a little worried how the outcome would be because i didnt realize I didnt have white wine.  I seasoned the chicken lightly also because the parm cheese is salty.  I pan fried just for a few mins on each side before putting in the oven for a nice crisp crust.  YUM!!! I didnt use parsley either because I forgot!But it still worked really well, we loved it!

Really great and flavorful! I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I put pieces of bread (whole wheat with flax seed) in the oven as it was heating up, which dried it out and I made my own bread crumbs! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was fun.  My 8 yr old loves to help so I let her measure and put everything in the bag and shake it - she told everyone she made dinner and more importantly - she ate it too and raved how good it was!

Pretty good.  It's not too different than regular chicken cutlets, but it was still a good eat.  It needs something to give it more flavor.  I'm going to try more garlic next time, or more wine.  I'll definitely make it again.

This made a delicious topping and very flavorful chicken. I added a little basil and baked for 45 minutes at 350 and omitted the butter and white wine because I didn't have any. Tasted great.

Made exactly as written using 3 large leg quarters. It took a little bit longer to bake, but was very tasty. I'd like to try it with skinless/boneless breasts.

my family loved this~but I thought it was a little greasy and kind of bland.  I used marinated boneless breast and pounded them out- to cook more evenly. The recipe was easy enough. Next time I'll jazz it up a little more with some extra garlic and a little lemon.  The chicken was very juicy.

Very good! I used the coating on chicken breast and made chicken fingers, baked for 30 mins on pizza stone at 150C in fan forced oven. I didn't use the butter or wine - might try next time!

I made this for dinner and it was sooooo good! It was simple to make and tasted out of this world. I substituted almond meal for the bread crumbs to make this a wheat free dish. All I can say is YUM!!

This is excellent! My family of 7 loved it and it will become a regular. The only changes I made:  crushed Ritz crackers sprinkled with Mrs. Dash (because I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs) and cooking sherry (because I didn't have white wine). Superb!!! The sherry didn't dominate the flavor at all and added a very light wine flavor. Also, as I used a whole 6 pound chicken.. I had to add about 10 more minutes to the total cooking time. Wonderful recipe-- thanks so much for sharing!

One word.....Awesome! I did use boneless skinless breast and sherry because thats what I had on hand. I do really like bone-in chicken and can't wait to try it that way also. This was such a quick simple dish with amazing taste.

What a wonderfuly easy recipe.  I did use boneless, skinless chicken.  So I also reduced the first part of the cooking to only 30 minutes because of that.  I also would used dried parsley flakes next time because they quickly seperated from the coating process in the bag.  This is one of my favorite recipes and will do over and over again.

I LOVED this!!!! I think this is the best chicken I ever made. The bad thing is that only 1 out of my 4 kids liked it! I thought for sure my 7 yr old who is a chicken lover would like it but nope. My hubby was out of town so I don't know about him but I'll def bemaking this again for me!!!! Thanks

These had good flavor and baked up perfectly. I used leg quarters which I skinned and then soaked in salted water for a half hour to bring the blood out. The chicken came out of the oven with a nice crispy coating and the meat was very moist. I did cook mine uncovered the entire time. Everything worked together very nicely. My fiance really loved this chicken so 5 stars it is. I'll use this recipe again, thank you :)

This was excellent.  I did a whole chicken without skin...the thighs and legs were OK but I agree with other raters that bonless skinless breasts would be much easier and that was everyone's favorite.  I do think the wine is a must but the butter could be less or even eliminated...I will try that next time.  Also, I just used cooking spray on the pan instead of oil.  Great recipe terrific flavor.

OK Please tell your mom  THANK YOU!!! This was absolutely delicious.   I put the chicken in a plastic bag as suggested and let all of the ingredients set in the chicken for about 15 minutes.  The only thing I did differently was add more spices (which I do to most recipes).  However, I kept the recipe pretty much exactly as it was.  I omitted the wine simply because I did not have any on hand.  This will for sure be in my regular rotation.   I served it wiht my own version of a vegetable stir fry.   OMG it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!

Very, very good. I didn't use butter or wine though, I only coated the pan lightly with extra virgin olive oil. I also tried topping it with sauce and a slice of mozzarella cheese during the last 15 minutes. Fantastic!

This is a great, quick and tasty recipe.  I did use the grated parmesan cheese from the   bottle like another reviewer did.  I omitted the basil and added some garlic salt for more seasoning.  It was really yummy!!  Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this recipe; we used boneless/skinless chicken breast cut in equal longitudinal halves. We baked them in a large oven proof skillet for 35 minutes at recommended temp setting and finished, covered, as recommended for 15 minutes. This will be added to our menu rotation on a permanent basis. Thank you for sharing.

Did not change a thing. This turned out absolutely delicious and my family really loved it! Will be making this again, especially for company. A really tasty, quite elegant dish. I believe that the White Wine is what finishes it off perfectly!

I didn't have any wine, so I made it without it and it was very dry.  It had a good flavor, however, so I would make it again using the wine.

Fantastic chicken! I normally make this type of chicken, but the adding of the white wine at the end sets it apart! The only additions/changes I make is coating the chicken in ranch prior to coating it with the breading. I also add romano cheese in with the parm. I will be making this again and again. Family absolutely loved it! Thanks!!

Very good just like the recipe, it was done in 45 minutes so put the wine on and covered, out of the oven, for 5 minutes and it was perfect.  The wine was necessary, adds a lot!

This is a go to easy dinner for my boyfriend and I. We follow the recipe almost exactly- except about double the wine because the sauce is so good- when the cooking is done I take the wine and reduce it in a pan- to pour over the chicken as well as a dressing for the pasta I serve it with.

Delicious! Skipped the wine and butter and it was still yummy. I made it to go with my favorite fettuccine Alfredo. Here's a fun and delicious way to use up some of the leftover breading mixture- melt a little butter in a skillet and brown the crumbs. Sprinkle it over your pasta and thank me later.

I tried this recipe just as is for the first time, and my family LOVED it! The chicken came out so tender, even though I turned the oven up to 375° for the last 15 minutes. I had a little spinach and diced tomatoes to some buttered pasta noodles, and this dish was a real restaurant status success! Thank you, I will be adding this recipe to my regular meal rotation.

I love this recipe. I made quite a few breast halves...12...so they were crowded in my large baking pan...meaning, I had to bake them a lot longer. They were perfect and my quests were amazed at how tender the chicken was. I love this recipe and will try it again on chicken and fish...maybe even boneless pork.

My family really liked this. The chicken tasted amazing when we used the pan drippings. I served this with mashed potatoes and corn. Thanks for the post.

Loved this recipe! I doubled the amount of spices in the breadcrumb mixture, and dipped the chicken pieces in melted butter before tossing in the breadcrumbs. I didn't have white wine on hand, so I substituted sherry as suggested. I used a cast iron skillet to bake it in... Not sure if it made a difference but everything turned out crispy and evenly browned! A really delicious recipe, and inexpensive when you purchase a split whole chicken and cut it up yourself.

Great easy recipe! I read other reviews and decided to marinate chicken in pesto sauce I made earlier this week for a couple of hours before breading. Was delicious, moist and gobbled up by my family and guests. I used chicken whole legs which I skinned and separated the thighs from the drumstick first and panko instead of traditional bread crumbs. Stuck with the recipe otherwise. Will definitely make this dish again.

I have made this about six times -- it's a no fail recipe and a weeknight favorite.  Easy and yet it is fantastic, makes the house smell incredible.  I've used boneless and bone-in chicken and it turns out great with either.

Nice excuse to open up some white wine and sip while cooking (who am I kidding?)  But, really, nice little recipe, of course, made some changes...  Used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, dredged with flour (no breadcrumbs on hand), sprinkled with spices/herbs and not enough parmesan (3 T...  should have been more), heaped over with carmelized white onion and dotted with butter.  Baked a shorter time and then added the wine.  What I should have done was remove the chicken, added the wine and reduced to make a sauce as a lot of flavour was lost in the bottom of the pan.  Was absolutely fabulous with cranberry sauce, probably applesauce, too.  Will make again with said tweaks.

I have made this recipe several times as listed, but I have used boneless chicken breasts as we are only 2 adults and 1 toddler eating this.  The time on them is 30 minutes (total time) at 200 degrees C, or 400 F. They are wonderful, flavorful, and moist.  I strongly recommend using the wine, as it adds an unmistakable aroma.  I usually make the Cream Cheesy Cubed Zucchini with Lemon and Oregano from this site to go with it, and serve it all with a nice, chilled, Albariño.  Great dinner.

Wonderful recipe..  However I wanted it as appetisers so I just cut the chicken into strips and,marinated it with lemon juice, salt basil leaves. Left it for couple of hrs n then breaded them n baked them. Didn't use the wine at all.. Was a wonderful starter for a party the kids loved it n so did the adults :) since these were strips got baked in20mins flat..

DELICIOUS!!  This is SOOOOO yummy!  My whole family absolutely LOVED this--the only thing I changed was I didn't have any breadcrumbs, so I just used smashed up Saltine crackers--oh, and I didn't use the wine.  The only thing I would suggest is if you use the Saltines, omit the salt the recipe calls for :)  YUMMMMM!!!

This was a fast, easy, and delicious way to prepare chicken.  Next time I will omit the salt though, I think the parmesan cheese has enough for my taste. I put the chicekn in a beaten egg before breading it and that helped it stick.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh my gosh, this was delicious!  I not a huge fan of chicken but my husband likes it, so to make it so I could "stand" it, I cut it up into tiny bite size pieces and then made it following the directions.  I did add extra cheese because... who doesn't like extra cheese!  I know I liked it when I found myself picking at the plate for seconds!!!  I'll be keeping this one for sure!

I thought this a great recipe.I would recommend only using boneless chicken breasts. I cut whole chicken into pieces and that thought that the dark meat on the legs and wings just didn't mesh well with the flavors, where as the the breasts were fantastic.

Oh. My. Gosh.  Family favorite.  I get a request for this once a week.  We use this sliced chicken breasts and make a double batch so we can have some for lunch.  My three year old twins eat it up!  The wine is a must!

I used chicken breasts, cooked only 35 minutes and served at a dinner party; it went over pretty well, but  I am not sure the wine made any difference.

Absolutely LOVED - best recipe so far on Allrecipes.  The wine and butter really make the dish.

We really enjoyed this chicken.  Used boneless breasts. baked them uncovered for 25 min., added the wine and baked an additional 10 minutes.  Came out really juicy and flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again.

Excellent recipe!  The only change I made was to delete the paprika (I don't like it even a little bit).
The seasoned bread crumbs I had on hand were Italian and they worked just fine.  I enjoyed this dish a lot.

The flavor in this dish was excellent, no complaints there!!!  The chicken's breading was pretty soggy though when i was taking it out.  I stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes and that helped!  The mix of seasonings was perfect though!  Just added more garlic, as I always do!  Very simple and very tasty recipe!  It's a keeper!!!

This was quite yummy!  I liked the flavor the wine added, but it did cause the breading to get a little soggy.  I served it with Candied Carrots and a Romaine salad.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

This is very close to a recipe my Mother used to make when I was a child. She used Marsala wine so that is what I used. Everyone enjoyed this recipe.

Prep was easy and the chicken was very flavorful and juicy.  I had a little trouble getting bread crumbs to stick, but a little egg fixed that.  I thought the breading would be soggy but that wasn't the case at all.  VERY YUMMY!

I had a bunch of chicken breasts I needed to use up and found this simple recipe that called for ingredients I already have, and it had so many greats reviews, I figures why not?  Unfortunately, I don't think I'm a fan of parmesan chicken in general.  Although it came out tender, moist and "flavorful"..the flavors are too bland for my taste.  Some things I did as slight variation from the recipe is that I used Italian bread crumbs, dried parsely, fresh minced garlic, and moscato for the wine.

I made this using boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I marinaded the chicken in some Italian dressing which helped the breading to stick.  I also doubled up on the seasonings in the breading but kept the amount of bread crumbs and parmesan as written.  It was good but didn't wow me as I'd expected...it was just kind of "there." I'm wondering if maybe I would have liked it better had I not added the wine.  Not sure if I will make again or not but thanks for sharing!

Big Hit! I used boneless skinless breasts as that's what I had. Soaked them in ice water for a few minutes while I prepped the coating. For the seasoning I used 1/8t smoked paprika and 1/8t regular.  I also used 1 tsp dried parsley as I had no fresh.  Took the chicken out of the ice water and coated it in sour cream, then in the breadcrumb mixture. Did not use the butter. Rave reviews from the family!!! Thanks for this simple and delicious recipe!!

I screwed this up and thought it said to cut up the chicken in pieces not piece a whole chicken! But after reading the reviews it looks like people did a million variations including cutting in pieces. With that said since it was a breast cut up it left no sauce but was still pretty tasty. Is it me or does it taste like this way would be a great base for crispy pieces for a Chinese chicken? Maybe add teriyaki or orange chicken sauce, toss it and serve over white rice. Anyway I will try again with whole breasts!

This is awesome, don't change a thing. I thawed some frozen chicken that was cut into strips. I was worried that it would be dry. It worked perfectly. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it and my daughter loved it too.

This is really good and simple to prepare.  I doubled the seasonings just because I like lots of flavor, used panko crumbs, and I didn't add the wine at the end because when I looked at the near finished product I didn't think it needed to be swimming in wine.  The chicken was so moist and flavorful.  Definitely will make again... good for everyday or even guests.

Good combination of spices and the cheese.  I didn't have wine, so I had to mix orange and lemon juice and poured it on the chicken.  It was good that way, but I want to fix it again using the wine.

I wanted a crispy finish to the chicken so... eliminated the wine step & at the end broiled the chicken for a few minutes to get more color and crisp up the chicken some .  Served the Pinot Grigio white wine along with the meal. Also, if you use the "powdered type of Parmesan, it adheres better to the chicken.  I make it both ways.

Sooooooo yummy! I did make some changes as did a couple people on the other reviews. we only have boneless skinless breasts so thats what I made and instead of paprika i used cayenne pepper only because my family and i loooooove cayenne pepper. i also followed what a reviewer said about marinating the chicken in buttermilk before the breeding....DO. IT. got thumbs up from everyone and my dad even said that we have to use it more often! highly highly suggest this recipe! thank you for sharing!

This was an extremely easy and tasty chicken recipe to prepare.  I recommend no more than an hour of cooking, perhaps 65 minutes at the most.  I used the garlic from the wee jar about 1-2 tsp.  I will return to this one often.

This was delicious.  I used boneless skinless breasts and it was very moist.  I used Chardonnay wine and like some of the others I cooked 30 minutes before pouring the wine over.  Then cooked for 15 more minutes.

I used chicken breasts instead of whole chicken pieces. And I  followed another reviewer by soaking the chicken for an hour in ranch dressing.  Other than that, I made it exactly as is.  I thought it was superb, and so did my husband..  This is definitely a keeper!

I used Panko breadcrumbs and dried parsley because that's what I had on hand. Chicken was moist and had a nice flavor.

Very tasty! I used boneless chicken breasts and skipped the wine. Would probably be great with chicken thighs.

The coating wasn't sticking to the breasts at all and I really wanted that yummy parmesan cheese on the meat. I did something bad, I dipped the breasts in melted butter, then coated them. If you do this with real butter, either use unsalted butter, or reduce salt in your coating. Oh, and I completely skipped the wine step, still great without it. :)

This was a great meal, fairly easy and quick to prep and make.  I took  a couple of shortcuts, I cut the breasts into 3 pieces to allow for cooking quicker.  I also, in addition to using the seasons in the recipe, i used the breadcrumbs from the "Chicken Parm" "Shake and Bake" package since I didn't have any seasoned breadcrumbs.  It was wonderful!  I cut the back time in half and added the melted butter there towards the end, and left off the dry wine and wallah...Delicious!!!!

Will definitely make again.  Lovely flavor with the wine and so moist and tender.  For all those reviewers that have said they leave out the wine, you don't know what you are missing!  Covering the chicken while it cooks in the wine for the extra 15 minutes is what makes this chicken so moist and so delicious!

Good flavor, but it is definitely not "crispy, crunchy".  Pouring wine over, then baking covered results in a soggy topping.

It was a little too bland, but still a good recipe. I added sauteed mushrooms and onions over the breasts. Next time I'm going to add more spices.

This chicken is very tender.   I think I  will double the spices and try it with less butter. My husband and son want more of a crust. Otherwise  it's a keeper.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the directions exactly, and it was a big hit with the family. Very moist, very tasty. The Parmesan cheese I used was freshly grated...I think that makes a difference!

REALLY good. This one will be a regular at our house. I used a lot of the mix on top of the chicken after shaking it in the bag to lock in the moisture. Did thighs with skin on and off. I thought the skin off was just as juicy, so next time I will only do skinless and try other cuts. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used thin sliced cutlets so didn't need to cook as long.   I used Reisling wine.   These were the best tasting breaded cutlets I have ever made or tasted!   I will never fry them again!!!!

I used an almost-4lb. picnic pack (legs and thighs). I had plenty of breading leftover, but I discarded it. The flavor is incredible. I will make this again.

People please STOP reviewing recipes if you left out the key ingredients or changed the recipe. It defeats the purpose. In this case if you LEFT THE WINE OUT then don't give the recipe a 3 star and say it was bland. You didn't make the recipe. That said, the WINE along with the parm are what make this recipe different from your standard shake and bake recipe. They play off of one another giving a moist and unique flavor.

Marinated the chicken in Buttermilk, drained then shake and bake. Next time I will omit the wine bath but deglaze the pan with wine to make a gravy. Served with mashed potatoes, carrots and peas.

This was a delicious and quick dinner for the family! First time I made it, though, it was pretty bland, so I added some things. First I used Garlic Salt, not Garlic Powder. Then I mixed together, in a separate bowl, 1 can (12 oz) Cream of Mushroom soup (did not add water or milk) and 2 large spoonfuls of sour cream and poured that in the bottom of the baking pan. Then I poured the chicken mixture on top of that (with remaining bread crumb spice mixture). I covered it with foil and baked it for the 45 mins at 350 degrees. Removed the foil, poured the white wine and melted butter over the top (did not mix in), left the foil off and cooked it for another 20 mins. Served it on top of steamed white Jasmine rice. Ohhh so good! Family loved it! Thanks for sharing! Will make this a part of our family favorite dinners!!

I made pretty much everything the same, just used chicken breast instead. So it was a tad dry because of the parmesan. But otherwise it was good. Not superb, but good.

Tried this recipe - turned out great, delicious - had some extra
coating left over (used panko bread crumbs) - and patted the extra on the chicken after putting in baking dish - followed instructions with melted butter, baked 45 mins , spooned wine (chardonnay) over chicken and covered w/foil as instructed -baked 15 mins - this is a keeper - thanks  Christy J.
 Note:  may want to use a little less salt as the parmesan cheese is salty.

Just needs a little tweak to take down some of the salt content. With the seasoned bread crumbs it can be a little overboard. I served it over fettuccine with some Bertoli sauce, unfortunately the sauce I used was too sweet (olive oil, basil, and garlic.) Next time I'll be using/making something a little more savoury.

Used 3 half chicken breasts totalling 1.5 lbs
Used all the batter on the top of the chicken pieces after rolling them in the bag and placing them in the pan.
Followed the directions as listed and they came out perfect. Didn't use a full 1/2 cup of sherry.
Very pretty when finished, but I wish it would have included a sauce of some sort for the chicken.

The cooking time was accurate, but I did cook at 350 on the top shelf.

Very delicious. A couple exceptions: used chicken breasts, dried parsley and shortened the cooking time to 40 minutes (probably should have been 30).  After coating chicken with bread crumb mixture and placing in the pan, I lightly sprinkled addition bread crumbs over top and along side breasts in a glass 9x14 baking dish. With the butter and wine, the bread crumb mixture made for a nice sauce to dip chicken into! Family insisted we have this again.

I used three slices of wheat bread with one sleeve of Ritz crackers to make bread crumbs with bail (no thyme) and sea salt(in food processor)
I also used extra butter in the pan with the wine while baking. Came out so most and delish, icky needed a fork to cut the chicken!

One of my favorites. The only change that I make is using boneless/skinless chicken thighs and stuff it with spinach and goat cheese. Everyone always wants more.

Amazing! I filled the chicken with ham and cheese before breaking it. Wasn't sure about the wine but did it anyway and it tasted amazing! Definitely will be doing that again. Good buy dry chicken breasts!

This recipe is amazing. I had bought a years worth of pasture raised chickens and was getting tired of having whole roast chicken. I went searching for some chicken recipes that weren't just chicken breasts and used a whole chicken cut up. I do up this recipe as described and put it on the top level of my oven roaster then I cut up a bunch of root vegetables and put them under the roasting tray in the bottom and they roast along with the chicken pieces. Easy, delicious one pan meal!!

If we could give 4 1/2 stars, we would.   I didn't do the wine as I wanted to top with sauce and mozzarella at the end.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh.  I used 1/2 the salt and dredged the chicken in melted butter before breadcrumbs and didn't use any other butter.  Very good and very easy.

I served this to my In-Laws recently when we had them over for supper and it was a huge hit! Delicious and flavorful! The one thing I do find is that the breadcrumb mixture does not stick to the chicken as well as it should. An egg or milk bath is required before breading the chicken I think, so I would recommend that to any who would attempt this recipe. Other than that, it's a winner!

This is really good.  I marinated the 2 chicken breasts in balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, worchester sauce (just a little) and steak sauce (just a touch of that, too)...for about 2 hours. I always marinate chicken; I think it makes it more moist. Used the ingredients listed. The chicken was very moist and juicy.

This had good flavor, but I thought it needed a sauce, so I added cream to the juices in the pan after straining , also used a Dutch oven on the stovetop instead of the oven and browned the chicken first...don't think it changed the dish much. Since I didn't have sauce for all the chicken, I'm able to judge the taste of the recipe pretty much as written.

It was good,  made it exactly as written except that I used boneless chicken breasts.  It just seemed a little bland to me,  but it definitely wasn't bad.  Not sure if I'll make it again though...

Made this for dinner tonight but only made half the recipe. I got the chicken in the oven but I forgot the butter then I forgot the wine because I got tied up and when I realized it the chicken was done (all my fault). Next time I will make sure to do it right. But the chicken was still good. Thank you CHRISTYJ

Loved!!!  I couldn't follow it exact because of not having all the ingredients, but it turned out GREAT anyway.  I used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts with the same amounts of the rest of the ingredients.  I also didn't do the "shake and bake" type deal but mixed up everything really good with the chicken and dumped it in a baking dish.  There was a fair amount of extra "crust" that I treated like stuffing at serving time.  I didn't have thyme so left that out. Didn't have wine either so substituted apple juice with a smidge of lemon juice.  I imagine if I had all the right ingredients it still would have been great, but my attempt at it was pretty good.  You will not be disappointed.  And my kid that normally turns down chicken unless it's nuggets?  She liked it and ate a fair amount!

This was yummy!  I used boneless chicken breasts. I did roll the breasts in butter before coating them. Then cooked them for 20 minutes. I added the white cooking wine and cooked for about 15 more minutes.  They were so tender and tasty!  Easy and quick!

This was fantastic, tho I didn't have the white wine on hand and it was still delish! Please the better half also and at 67 he still wants it moma's way. which he is learning the hard way because I don't know moma's ways lol. When we first got married 8 yrs ago he would stand in kitchen and say that not the way my moma did it and since I never knew moma he better stay clear on the way my moma did it lol. Which was very much like this recipe and he did love and eat and wanted more! No treaking anything. All  the same except I didn't have wine on hand.

The wine definitely is the key to flavor on this. Used chicken tenders and rather than dab each piece with butter, I followed another suggestion and melted the butter and poured over the pieces prior to putting in the bread crumb/spice mix. Served over spaghetti with a garlic, olive oil, white wine sauce, sauted with fresh spinach and mushrooms. Topped with parmesan. Think I'll add roasted pine nuts the next time. Very delicious!

I LOVE this chicken.  More importantly, so does my family.  Have made it twice and perfect both times.  I used chicken breasts and did not use the wine because of little ones.

My husband and I both liked it! I didn't have any wine on hand so I skipped that part. I will be making this again, but I'll make sure to have some wine on hand to see if it improves anything.

I made this tonight for dinner. Goodbye Shake n Bake. It was delicious. I did not add the butter and next time I will either cook it longer or bake it at 400 degrees.  I also used chicken breasts much easier than cutting up a chicken. Will be making this every time we have chicken that I would of normally of made with Shake n Bake. Much healthier. The chicken was so juicy and moist.
