This was good but I did make a fair amount of changes due to what I had in the house. I omitted the eggs entirely. I did not have any celery so I did celery flakes instead of celery salt. I did not have poultry seasoning so I did 1/4 tsp. sage and 1/8 tsp. paprika. I did only a dash of white wine vinegar instead of the full amount of white wine. Unfortunately I forgot to add the mustard but I'm sure it would have been good. I upped the carrots to around 1/2 cup and used veggie broth instead of chicken. Then I added a drained (14.5 oz) can of corn and a 14.5 oz can of creamed corn... so it came out a little like a corn chowder but you could think of it as potato salad and corn on the cob! Next time I would add quite a bit of black pepper but this was easy and good.

I would really give it 3 1/2 stars. I made as directed. Next time I would definitely leave out the poultry seasoning. It definitely needed salt but that is is easy to add. I also served with red wine vinegar at the table. Don't skip the egg - it adds an interesting twist.

Made this today it turned out quite well. I do not care for thyme or poultry seasoning and used dill weed instead. I added 1/2 of a small jalapeno finely diced to give it just a tiny bit of a kick. My husband gives it 3 1/2 stars he doesn't gush over food like I do. I would make this again but probably would use bacon instead of ham.

I made exactly as written except that I added some dill because I like it in my potato salad. It ended up a little too oily so I would cut back on the butter next time. Good flavor though and the eggs added a unique touch.
