I have been using this recipe for years, it is so good on a cold winter night.  Cocoa with Baileys is also amazing.

Just what I needed last night after a long day. I used my own sugar free cocoa mix and doubled the peppermint schnapps. I stuck in a mini candy cane for extra pepperminty flavor. Not only did it relax me, but it helped with my sore throat, too!

Personally I think it would be more fun  (and taste better) to stick a candy cane in your hot chocolate and then hit the bar.

This is a good drink after coming in from a cold evening.  I like the mint sprig as an embellishment.

I never knew my drink had a name but we drink these every Holiday season starting as soon as it gets cold outside.  Hubby and I also enjoy it on our hot cocoa nights with our daughters.  Super easy to make and I suggest using milk to make the cocoa not water.

My husband & I made a huge pot of this on our woodstove (which is outside under our patio) last weekend....It is YUMMY.  Have made it a lot in the past.  We don't call it Peppermint Patty though...It's just hot chocolate and pepperming schnapps to us! :-)

Very good!  Was looking for a fun drink to share with some friends for an outdoor activity. It was a hit.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good, though I'm not normally a big fan of warm cider. I liked the flavor, and it was quite easy to make.

This is my favorite winter time drink.  After coming in out of the cold, it's a quick warm-me-up.  Add some whipped cream or a marshmallow Peep and you're all set to go.
