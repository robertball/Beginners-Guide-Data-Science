Very good- I did in the crock-pot instead and doubled the recipe for leftovers and added extra beans...next time I will lessen the liquid (too much for the crock-pot, as was more like a soup) and use reduced-sodium broth as the chorizo is VERY salty. Next time I will add some sauted green pepper and diced tomatoes to the mix- this is a keeper!

I made this last night, amazing!  However, I did use spare ribs, which I cooked in the oven for a few hours, and let the stew simmer for a couple of more hours with a bit of cumin and paprika.  I topped the dish off with cilantro and a little sour cream.

Nice taste, easy to make. Too much liquid though, I doubled the recipe but should not have doubled the chicken stock. Either that or add more beans.

This was awesome! I did adjust the chicken broth to bean ratio for a thicker stew (1 1/2 cans beans to 1 1/4 cup chicken broth). I couln't find chorizo so I used ham and seasoned with cumin, ancho powder, paprika, and cayenne. Will make again!

This stew is SENSATIONAL.  I had leftover pork tenderloin I didn't know what to do with, so I chose this recipe not really knowing what to expect.  Boy am I glad I did.  It was a huge hit with my family.  I'll definitely make it again.

This was a wonderful stew and I really am not a stew eater.  I made it one evening to serve for lunch the next day and I had two bowls of it before I went to bed.  I could not put it down.

I was suspicious when I looked at the ingredient list and saw that this doesn't call for any spices. And I was right to be!.. this stew is BLAND. I doused it in hot sauce once it was on my plate and that helped a bit, but yeah, there's very little flavor here otherwise.

To the people saying it's too thin: you need to simmer it longer and let the liquid cook off! 

This was worth trying, but I won't make it again.

Had an extra pork tenderloin and no time to marinate it and came across this recipe. I doubled the beans but left everything else the same and it is wonderful!! Making it for a second time tonight. Didn't need salt or pepper. Between the pork and chorizo, there's plenty of spice. Oh, I did use bulk chorizo...just easier for me.

I made the recipe as written - and it was good, but nothing special.  It lacked seasoning.  So, after eating a bowl, I doctored it up.  I added fresh diced tomatoes, a diced/seeded jalapeño, sliced fresh banana pepper, 1 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper.  This gave the dish the seasoning we felt was missing. The thickness of the broth was great and gave it a stew texture.  I served this with 'Jalapeño Green Onion Ale Corn Bread' from AR.  It was a nice dinner on a very chilly September evening.

Delicious! Instead of the pork tenderloin, I used some leftover pulled pork that I had in the fridge, and also added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of corn. Super quick, easy and yummy!

This recipe is very tasty! I cooked it in a Crock-Pot, like one of the other reviewers. A Brazilian lady told me that this recipe is called "Feijao e Porco" in Brazil.

Very good.  Use low sodium chicken stock and a good ham if you don't like things this salty. Lots of flavor.  Other than adding black pepper I stayed with the original recipe.

Used sweet Italian sausage since I was taking it to a BBQ with small kids.  It was a huge hit!  Double the beans plus added more stock. Used the oil from the sausage to saute the veggies.

This sounded delicious, but it lacked spice.  While I’m sure this recipe as written is delicious, we like a bit more spice in our house so I couldn’t resist the temptation to tweak the ingredients.  Besides wanting to spice the dish up, I didn't want to use the pork tenderloin because it is so lean it tends to be dry when braised and lacks flavor.  I instead used 1.5 lbs. boneless country spareribs (the extra was to allow for shrinkage).  

I started by heating the oil in my Dutch oven and cooking the chorizo.  Next I seasoned the pork pieces with Adobo and ground black pepper and browned them in the same oil, removing them to a platter.  Then I added the chopped onion and a bit of salt to sweat them before adding the garlic making sure to scrape the fond from the bottom.  When the garlic was just turning golden I added my spices: 1/8 tsp. Oregano, 1/4 tsp. Cumin, and a 1/4 tsp. Smoked Paprika and stirred them in the onions before adding back the browned pork pieces and their juices.  Next in was 1.5 cups hot chicken broth. 
I used the reserved ¼ cup of broth to pulse a ¼ can of the beans and added them (along with the remaining beans) to the pot along with the sliced sausage and cooked it on simmer for two hours, then letting it rest for a few hours.  
Served with saffron rice and sour cream, and hot sauce on the side—it was incredible—and even better the next day.

Excellent. I made this with lamb instead of pork & my Brasilian taster preferred this to pork.

I halved the recipe for 2.

My taster says that it needs more whole black beans.

Everyone in the family liked this one.  I did have to use mild italian sausage as our local store didn't have chorizo.  I then served it over brown rice.  Great recipe, that one could easily play around with.  Some future options: diced tomatoes, cilantro, cumin.  Will definitely make again.

Loved this!!!!!!!  I added spicy Italian sausage and a huge dollup of sour cream.  While simmering I added a pre-microwaved pack of frozen grilled veggies: peppers, potatoes and squash and zucchini (no tomato sauce). 
I did put too much liquid, so I had to add a little quick mix flour and let it simmer longer.  Yummy!!!!!

Yum!  Very hearty and filling.   I had way too much pork so I needed to double up the other ingredients, however didn't have 2 cans of black beans.  I added 1 can of baked brown beans, not blended at all.  After it was finished cooking it was a little watery so I added a flour/water paste to thicken.

Very good recipe! I used 1/2 lb. seasoned bulk chorizo sausage and doubled everything else. I thought it needed some other type of vegetable in it, but it's great as is. The color looked a little strange at first, but it blended and reduced down nicely. Definitely will make again and serve with guacamole salad or something. Yummy!

This was a very tasty, hearty stew.  However, I would use two cans of black beans and a little cumin.  I will definitely be making it again. :)

This was INCREDIBLE! My husband and I both loved it. I boiled ham hocks rather than cooking  a tenderloin.  (Don't understand why ham hocks have a bad rap! Full of delicious meat.) I increased everything because needed larger quantity. Served as a soup, then served leftovers over rice (best.) I also used a hot sausage which added a lot of additional flavor. My husband always compliments dinner, but really had a cow over this! Thank you!

My husband loved this recipe (he's usually not too keen on soups/stews).  The only thing I changed was I swapped the chorizo for Italian sweet sausage.  Gave it a wonderful taste because the sausage has a lot of nice spices in it.
Two cooking hints:  Cook the chicken and sausage together.
I used a large soup pan to cook everything.  After I sauteed the onions and garlic, I removed them to a bowl, then did everything else in the soup pan and the the onions/garlic in before I started bringing the mixture to boiling.

I made this about a month ago and followed the recipe perfectly and the stew was terrific.  Made this tonight for Sunday dinner tomorrow.  I followed the recipe except I added, 1/2 green and red bell pepper roughly chopped, cumin, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, Mexican oregano,  white frozen  white corn, and during the last 20 minutes, 1 medium garnet yam cut into cubes and added 1 cup of frozen collard greens.  Left the chorizo out entirely. It is outstanding.  Can't wait to heat it up tomorrow.  All of the herbs will have blended well.  A nice hearty bowl of the stew along with good cornbread made with green chiles and gooey cheese.  Yummy!

I wonder if the comments about this being bland are an geographical issue! 
for me in the UK 'chorizo sausages' = Spanish chorizo, not Mexican chorico, which my recipes show chili free and lightly spiced
I made with the Spanish version and guessed the quantity of 3 sausages
I throw all the ingredient into a slow cooker!-
The Spanish chorico packed full of paprika and spice filled my kitchen with wonderful smells  - I had no need to tweak or add to the list of ingredients and the taste was spot on will make this over and over, big thanks

Great recipe!  Depending on the type of chorizo used you may want to alter your seasoning.  When using Spanish/Portuguese chorizo you may want to lessen the paprika and when using Mexican chorizo lessen the cumin.  I like to use Chiquilin smoked paprika.  Upon opening the tin it smells like a forest fire  occurred inside!  You can also substitute some white wine for the liquid.  I like thyme and oregano for the herbs and you can always use an immersion blender to break up some of the beans to thicken it if it turns out too soupy.

I made this for dinner and kept in mind the feedback from other reviewers. I doubled the beans and pureed one whole can of beans and added the other one whole. I also added cumin. I cut the liquid back to 1 cup of broth.

this  was delicious. I love black beans. For those who don't like spicy   food, try this with a
non spicy sausage. But it would be worth it to make with out sausage and still be good

I modified this a bit for my crockpot, two pound pork loin roast, 2 cans drained black beans, and one small bottle wishbone italian.  No other seasonings.  Left it overnight on low in crockpot, ready to go next day for lunch.

This was yum!  I used what I had available.  One 1lb plus teriyaki tenderloin, and a package of Tofurkey Chorizo style ground "meat" because I had it on hand instead of chorizo sausage.  Used two cans of black beans (one mashed, one not) and water instead of chicken broth for the sodium save.  Served with tortillas day one and over rice day two.  The Chorizo sub had lots of seasoning and salt as did the teriyaki tenderloin so it was very flavorful - maybe even too much salt.  A plain tenderloin would have been better.  Everyone ate it up and after day two (only due to the fact that there are only three of us) nothing left.   Very good.

OuSTANDing and great for the second half of the Val-U-Pack of boneless pork sirloins.  I used the ground chorizo made by my local grocer, just pre-cooked and drained the fat.

I took this recipe and changed it so my family would eat it.  I added peppers and celery to the onions,  seasoned meat with pepper,  garlic, oregano,  and basil.  Added carrots, Brussel sprouts, corn, potatoes and broccoli to the black beans.  Finished it off with cream of mushroom soup to thicken it up.  Family loved it!

The first time I did it I did not have choriço, so I used 1 hot Italian pork sausage. This time I bought the hot piquant choriço from Minho. We found it a bit smokey. We will go back to the Italian sausage next time. It is an excellent recipe.

The body of the stew is bolstered by the nice touch of blending in pureed black beans. The sausage is crucial as it can change the background flavor. I think the spicier the chorizo, the better.

I can't rave enough about this dish! I took the advice of other reviews, decreasing chicken broth, and doubling black beans. I also added some frozen corn.  In addition I added Adobo seasoning and cumin. I don't have measurements for these spices because I simply sprinkled them into the stew and kept tasting it until it suited my taste.  In a separate pot, I cooked Rice Select, Royal Blend rice (a blend of Texmati, white, brown, wild and red rice). I served the stew by spooning the rice into individual bowls and topped it with the stew. This was a quick and easy recipe and extremely flavorful! I will be making it again and again. So many times I have prepared dishes with labor-intensive prep only to be disappointed with the final result, but my husband and I both loved this stew. It also reheats well.

I added more beans however after it sat it thickened which I added more chicken broth to loosen it. 
I'm testing up to 20 Brazilian Recipes for a Rio Party & Dinner Buffet. This one so far is voted positively.

Great, hearty, satisfying meal on a cold night. I doubled the recipe, used 1lb Italian sausage and one lb of pork loin, cut into small chunks. I also added 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 cup chopped greens,  a little red wine, smoked paprika, 1 finely diced jalapeno. 1 can of white kidney beans as well as the black beans. The black bean puree was a perfect thickening agent. Let it simmer for at least 3 hours. I added 1 cup cauliflower at the last 30 mins of cooking time. Cooked in a heavy Dutch oven on the stovetop. The whole family ate every bite in their bowl and loved it. My son served his over noodles, everyone else ate theirs over some leftover mashed potatoes. Delicious. don't add salt unless you need it at the end....you'll be surprised at the salt from the sausage, and the depth of flavor.

This was really good!  I did add 2 ingredients for deeper flavor: almost a tsp of TABASCO (just enough to help flavors pop, not too much to apply heat) and about 1/4 cup of white wine. I let it boil for a few minutes before covering to simmer. I served it with white rice. Husband and teenage kids loved it and had doubles!

Thanks to everyone suggestion this turn out really good. I added  smoked paprika, cumin and cayenne. It was a little thin so I used another can of beans that I pureed and it was the right consistency. I don't particularly care for Chorizo so I used andouille sausage instead. I'm sure I'll be making again.

This was really good...like really. I decided to puree one can of black beans and another can of whole black beans.  While it simmered I added cumin, salt, pepper, bay leaves, parsley flakes and one packet of goya con culantro y achiote. When done, I served it over rice. This is definitely a keeper!

I am beyond in love with this recipe.  I did make a few changes based on recommendations from other reviewers, but it turned out spectacularly.

First, when browning the pork tenderloin, i sprinkled liberally with Cumin and Paprika a few times.  After adding the pork to the saucepan, I sprinkled in just a touch more of both.  I was unable to find chorizo at my local grocery, but i substituted 3 hot Italian Johnsonville sausages.  I removed the cases and browned the crumbled sausage, using the same skillet as the pork tenderloin (after it was done) and added to the sauce pot.  Lastly, when service, i served over Basmati rice.  My stew came out very thin, this helped to absorb some of the liquid and gave it a heartier consistency

I plan to make this throughout the summer.  It was fairly quick and very easy, and had so much flavor..

I want to give this five stars, because it was phenomenal, but I made some changes (to the directions and to the ingredients). I simplified it down to a one-pot meal, chopping and dropping as I went. I added the chorizo right after I browned the pork and let that cook a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients. When I tasted it, it needed some "oomph", so I added in some cumin and about five shakes of hot sauce. My result made my fiance actually shout "WOW!" after his first bite, and I only had one pan to wash. With those changes, this is a keeper!!

Delicious!  Made a single recipe the first time just to try it.  It was wonderful!   The second time, I doubled the recipe and put some in the freezer.  I've shared this recipe with friends and will definitely make it again.  This one's a keeper!!!

The first time I made it I did it as the recipe calls for and it was a little bland. The second time around I added some chopped cilantro, 1/4 tsp of cumin and a diced Jalapeño. It tasted phenomenal with the additions.

Unique taste, but we liked it.  Doubled the recipe as written with the addition of red pepper flakes.  It was thinner than anticipated.
We added a can of rotel and beans to the leftovers.  It made wonderful meals and warmed us into the following week.

Absolutely loved this dish.  Only changes were olive oil instead of vegetable oil and 1 stick of choriso instead of the 3 which I thought would overwhelm the dish and the smokiness of the choriso was wonderful and just the right amount.   Also, I used a standard 15 ounce can of beans and served the dish with rice.  There was enough for 3 dinners for 2 and 2 lunches.  I definitely will be making this may times again.

This recipe is a keeper! I made a few modifications , but I am certain the recipe would have been great as is. I didn't have any chorizo so I substituted Adele's Chicken Apple sausage. As recommended by a few other reviewers, I also added cumin, paprika, and chili powder. The Hubster likes a more soup texture so he poured in about an extra cup and a half of chicken broth. Topped this with a dollop of sour cream and it was extraordinary!

Made this last night for dinner and my husband agreed with me that it is definitely a keeper.  I did make some rice which we put the stew over the rice. But I could definitely just eat out of a bowl.

I loved this meal and so did my family who don't normally like pork!  I spiced it up by adding some cholula hot sauce and some red pepper flakes as it was simmering, and it was delicious.  We will definitely make it again!

I made this not expecting my picky 13 year old to like it . She loved it!  Based upon other reviews I used 2 cans of beans, a can of diced tomatoes,  a green pepper  and low sodium chicken stock.  I also served it over rice.  A tasty satisfying meal!

I scaled up the recipe because I had more pork than called for but at the same time reduced the relative amount of chicken broth based on other reviews. It was excellent! I served it with rice on the side to add to the stew, much like is often done with black bean soup. I think you could use any boneless pork in place of the tenderloin with good results.

I am giving 5 stars for how I made it, but would give 3 as the recipe is, it is a good starter. I used a crock pot, high for 6 hours. Doubled the beans and pork loin and used ham instead of chorizo to decrease the salt. I added carrots for a veggie boost and much more seasoning than original recipe. I added cumin, paprika, and salt free seasoning and doubled the garlic. I also didn't blend any of the beans, as 6 hours in the crockpot cooked them just soft enough. Husband loves beans and loved this stew. Will definitely make again using my variation.

I, like others, thought this may be a little bland.  I chose to cook the chorizo with the pork and removed most of the fat from the pan. I sautéed the onions and garlic in the same pan and added a little more garlic, some cumin and some Mexican oregano. I only used 1 bay leaf and  I added an extra can of black beans  as well as a little less liquid.  It was good. The consistency was fine but it seemed to be missing a little something for my taste.

Made this for Sunday family dinner. I added Goya sofrito to add flavor to stew base and small amount of red pepper flakes. I also roasted in oven all together for about 50 minutes really made meat tender and brought flavors together. Will definitely make again!

Yum, Yum, I cut way back on the liquids and used hot turkey sausage instead o chorizo.  I also added in a cup of brown rice from Whole Foods frozen section about 10 minutes before it was done.  My husband and very picky eater daughter loved it.

I don't know what the haters are talking about--this recipe was amazing!   The only thing I did outside the recipe was add some cornstarch roux to thicken it a tad.  And then I served it over white rice.  It reminded me a lot of black beans and rice in Brazil.  
I did salt and pepper every layer (onions/garlic, pork, and then stew).  
The only thing I'm unhappy about is that I only made the amount I did!   I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe. I skipped the sausage and added extra black beans and hominy. Really yummy. To make it stretch a bit more, I served it over rice.

I made this last night. It was very good over brown rice. As others have mentioned, it was too soupy, even though I took the advice offered and added only 1 C chicken broth..
I was puzzled by the chopped, sauteed onions. What did you do with them? I ended up adding them back, thinking a step had been left out.
I also added a small can of diced, fire roasted green chilies; I will probably use 2 cans next time, and cut the broth in half.

I made this on a whim because I had leftover pork loin, and it was delicious! I followed the recipe, except for substituting leek for the onion, and I didn't feel a need to add extra spices. I did serve this with fennel-spiced corn muffins (another recipe on this site) which may have upped the flavor. I ended up with a lot of broth and it felt like this was in-between soup and stew, but that's fine with me!

I made this tonight. Smells great cooking and tastes even better. I didn't read the reviews first so it is a bit soupy instead of stewy so I made rice to put it on top of. Problem solved! I did add spices since there were none in the recipe  I used cumin and chili powder. I used tenderloin and beef dinner sausage I had on hand. I will totally make this again.

I added cumin, chili powder and cayenne. I only used 1 cup of chicken stock and I blended one whole can of black beans and kept one whole can whole in this recipe. I served on brown rice with a side of spinach.  Can also add diced or Rotelle tomatoes and chopped red or green peppers. Yummy!!!

I will rate the recipe as I made it as I made a few changes because I like a little more spice.

As another reviewer mentioned, I added cumin, chili powder and cayenne. I only used 1 cup of chicken stock and I blended one whole can of black beans and kept one whole can whole in this recipe. I served on brown rice with a side of spinach.

I used this recipe as a base, as written it is too bland for our tastes. However, it was a great starter. I added another can of beans, a can of green chilies, cumin, chipotle chili powder, and cayenne pepper. Also, I simmered for at least 2 hours on the stove, and it was just the right thickness. Thanks, I'll try something like this again.

I had several compliments on this easy recipe.  I mashed more beans and served it over rice.
