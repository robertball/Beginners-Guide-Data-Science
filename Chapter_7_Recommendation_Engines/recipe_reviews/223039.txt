I really enjoyed this slaw; it was a nice refreshing complement to our meal now that it is so warm outside.  The only change I made was to use lime juice instead of lemon juice, because that's what we had on hand.  This will definitely be a go-to salad instead of the heaviness of macaroni and potato salads.

Great recipe for kohlrabi...no bitter taste...I used a little less mayonaise because I didn't want it to be too heavy.  It was delicious.

This was really, really good!  We got some kohlrabi in our CSA and we were looking for a way to use it and this is definitely a great way to use it up!  The only changes I made was to use Veganaise (we're vegan) and we omitted the lemon juice b/c we happened to be out of it, but even if we had it I don't think it needs it!   The sauce is the perfect flavoring for the kohlrabi and apples!  Thanks for this recipe!  Yum!!

This is a great new twist on cabbage slaw.  I didn't change a thing and it was the first thing to disappear from the table!

Surprisingly good. I made it because I got a bunch of kohlrabi and didn't know what to do with it. The homemade slaw dressing is yummy. Kohlrabi works a lot like jicama in this slaw. I will make it again when I get more kohlrabi.

The entire family love it even my 2 boys. I followed the recipe except since my kohlrabi were small I only used 2 apples and I added alittle carrot for color.

I had kohl rabi from the garden and apples from the tree and wanted to make a slaw to go with pulled pork: this worked great! Flavour combo worked really well together. I did a half recipe because it was really only for three people (I'd say it gave me 6 servings and that's only using half the ingredients) and added chopped almonds for an extra crunch. My husband was skeptical but even he enjoyed it. I recommend it for sure.

I did not peel the apples and just tossed them through the shredder with the kohlrabi. It was so easy and tasted great!

When I first say this recipe I was like "Now why didn't I think of that?"  Although tasty we found it lacked texture and I should have added the dressing a little at a time instead of all at once.  We found it to be overdressed and which overpowered the flavor of the kahlrabi.

This was my first attempt using kohlrabi which I got in my CSA box. Pretty good -- the apples make this dish. My only recommendation would be to go a little lighter on the mayo. I like mayo, but it was too much.

Made this once and grated everything in the food processor. It got watery fast but it tasted good. And I got boatload of kohlrabi in my farm share (did I say I have never eaten or cooked kohlrabi before). So I tried again...this time I used two med kohlrabi cut in small uniform rectangles 1 x 2 maybe. 2 med carrots peeled and cut on the diagonal. One granny smith apple grated. Juice half a lemon a pinch of s & p, 1 Tbl sugar and 2-3 Tbl mayo. In addition I added one cup of homemade apple raisin chutney I had in the fridge and needed to use. OMGeeeWhiz this is good. Thanks so much for the great way to use this most unusual veg! tpm

Yummy!  I will rarely change a recipe the first time it's made and this one doesn't need any changes.  I like that it adds a healthy twist with the kohlrabi.

A good healthy side dish, no complaints, fresh, crisp and the apples add some sweet and the Kohlrabi adds snap and the veggie flavor, very good.
