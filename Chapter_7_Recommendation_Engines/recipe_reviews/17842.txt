This an a most excelllent recipe for pizza crust(( FIRST I DOUBLE the recipe..))
I use olive oil instead of vegetable. add 2 tsp. of vital wheat gluten and 1 tsp oregano to the dry ingredients.Hands down the best crust ever.Easy to work with and delicious.I skip the lemon juice though.The dry milk powder is essential, it helps to relax the dough.After the machine is done, take out the dough, divide into 2 portions,roll into 2 balls and let rest on the counter for a few minutes covered.Roll out, I use my rolling pin, into two circles.Dont worry if they are small. Cover and let rest again.The resting is important! Try rolling again, you should be able to get 2 14-16 circles of dough,If not let rest again.You can do it.Then I place the circles on lightly sprayed pizza pans and set aside to rise a few minutes.When it starts to puff up, brush wa little olive oil, poke with a fork all over and place in a preheated 400 to 500 oven on the lowest rack.When the crust is puffy and light brown take out and continue with the sauce and toppings.You can also cool and freeze for instant pizza any night you want.This is a lifesaver in my house!We just add toppings and bake frozen.I have made hundreds of doughs and this is the best!I also roll out into 8 bersonal pizzas for the kids.I prebake the crusts,cool and place in a large rubbermaid in the fridge or freezer.Kids can make their own pizzas during the week, by just adding toppings.They love it and so do their friends!

This is by far the best pizza crust I've done in my bread machine. It came out perfect. I made the recipe as listed, only added a teaspoon vital wheat gluten and some spices (oregano, crushed red pepper). After the dough cycle, I let the dough ball rest (covered) for a few minutes, then punch out into a little circle. I stop, let it bounce back a little bit and rest (covered) for a few minutes, and punch it out bigger. Do several of those cycles and you can easily get 14-16" out of it. The object is to give it some TLC and gradually get the crust to take shape, not forcing it. I don't toss my crusts, but I'm sure you can do that too. When the dough is formed, I brush a mixture of olive oil and italian seasoning on it, and poke the crust all over with a toothpick (to prevent massive bubbles, unless you like those). The oil and holes prevent the crust from rising super high. I then put it in the oven's bottom rack until the bottom is just crispy, remove it, and lightly sprinkle fresh parmesan and romano cheese on it, put it back in the oven until the cheese cooks a bit. Remove and put your sauce, cheese, and toppings on it. Best pizza ever. Even if your sauce is terrible, people will comment on how good the crust is. And much cheaper than delivery!

UPDATE: I have made pizza using this crust more than 50 times now, and you really can't even mess it up with substitutions and additional ingredients. I typically add spices to the dough itself, and also put some spices onto the cru

WONDERFUL!!! I'll never order home-delivery pizzas again, nor would I buy frozen ones. This crust is worryless, tasteful, and has a wonderful texture. I have a pizza dough setting on my bread machine, which I used for this dough, and it only took 45 minutes from putting ingredients in the pan to having a smooth and fresh smelling pizza dough. A piece of advice, though: transfer dough from bread machine pan to a lightly floured board before patting in a pizza pan or rolling, or dough will stick to your fingers. Will make it often.

First time I made a pizza crust, and this was excellent.  Made it as written except that I subbed buttermilk powder and olive oil, and, since my dough seemed dry in the mix cycle, I added 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic; it needed no further adjustments.  My machine takes 1:40 to finish its dough cycle, so when it was finished, I used floured hands to knead it a bit on a floured board.  Then I let it sit about 5 minutes before patting it into a large circle.  A little at a time I patted it into a larger and larger circle, letting it rest a bit in between.  At some point in time I turned it over and continued the process until I had a 13-inch diameter crust that I could fold in half and ease into my pizza pan that had been sprayed with no-stick cooking spray.  After letting it sit a few more minutes in the pan, I patted it into a nice uniform crust.  After taking the dough out of the machine, forming the crust took about 15 minutes.  The trick with this crust is to not get in a hurry.  I chose to pre-bake it at 450 degrees F. (increased for 4600 ft. in elevation) for 8 minutes.  After the 8 minutes, it had RAISED ALMOST TO THE TOP OF THE OVEN!!!  Poking it with a fork and pressing on it made it come down flat so that I could add the toppings.  SO, IF YOU DO PRE-BAKE THIS CRUST, DO WATCH IT!!!  Extremely SIMPLE and NATURAL crust.  From starting the bread machine to being ready to top the crust took about 2:10 the way I made it.  But it was worth it.

I have made many recipes for bread and doughs, etc. This is by far the best homemade pizza dough that I have experienced. When the kneading was done, I let it rise in the  machine for 1 hour. 
I shaped it and stretched it out into a 14 inch circle and placed it on my round pizza stone that was dusted with cornmeal. I let it rise for an additional 15 minutes on the stone, than half baked it at 450 for 10 minutes.
I topped it with a BBQ sauce, cooked chicken chunks, fresh cilantro, chopped red onion, garlic powder, basil, salt and mozzarella cheese. That was baked for 15 minutes at 350. OH MY GAWD!!!!

Best bread machine recipe for pizza dough I've found.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Texture of the dough made it easy to roll out and it tastes great.

This recipe is fantastic!  I've used it every time we make Pizza at home and it turns out perfectly everytime! I skip the lemon juice as it is not something we normally have on hand and it doesn't seem to make a lot of difference.

Fantastic!  I have a 1.5 pound machine.  I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 (customized the recipe for 15 servings) and it was not too much for the machine.  Made one big pizza for me and husband, and 2 smaller (9 inch) for each of the kids.  I cooked the crusts at 425 until risen and dry, topped and baked until cheese browned.  Really wonderful crust-crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Kids went nuts, said "thanks mom."  Don't get that every night!  We'll be having home-made pizza often.

Overall good taste, but is difficult to work with and did not rise up as well as I like.  However the taste and texture are the best I have tried.  I will keep working on it.

I have made this 2X already since I discovered the recipe. Absolutely loved it, and it gave me an excuse to use the bread machine gift from the in-laws. I had never made pizza dough before and I did not have a rolling pin, so I used a can of Pam to roll out the dough. It is essential to let it rest between rollings. I had enough dough to make 2 13" pizzas, so I divided the dough and rolled half of it out a little, then set it aside while I rolled the second part out, alternating between the two. Not perfect circles, but I am working on that. I precooked the crust in a 400F oven for about 4 minutes. I also brushed it with olive oil and a little oregano for flavor before cooking. Don't forget to poke holes in the dough before you put it in the oven or it will poof up like no tomorrow. I only made that mistake once! I then pulled it out put my sauce and whatnots on top, popped it back in the oven for about 8 minutes at the same temperature, and voila Pizza! I burned my first one, and they do not take very long to cook, so just keep an eye on it. I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

I made this recipe tonight in my Zo bread machine and it was fabulous. I paired it with the Exquisite Pizza Sauce. (If you like sweet pizza sauce that sauce recipe was perfect.) Being the first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly. Make sure you add the lemon juice because it acts as a dough conditioner making the dough easier to work with especially while rolling it out. We decided to get adventurous and made one pizza on a stone. I didn't prick the dough so it rose into a bread like crust in the first bake (450 degrees for 7 minutes). Then I took it out, added some EVO, the pizza ingredients and baked additional 12 minutes at 425 degrees. The second crust I rolled into a thin crust, pricked the dough and baked on a pizza pan. First bake 7 minutes at 450. Took it out, added EVO, pizza ingredients and baked additional 12 minutes. Both tasted great but hubby gave a big thumbs up to the first pizza with the bread like crust. This will be my go to pizza crust recipe. It tastes great, appears very versatile and easy to work with. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Easy to make in the bread machine.  Stretches easily on my pizza stone. I cooked the crust at 425 degrees for about 7 minutes before putting sauce and other ingredients on it. Then I cooked it another 10 minutes.

Very simple and so easy to make, but to be honest even though I liked the crunch of this dough my family was not much for the sweet taste.  Not sure if that was down to the lemon juice or the sugar.

Pretty darn yummy!  I have 15 inch round pans so I adjusted the servings to 20 and it covers perfectly now.  I make a batch almost every day, load the pans and freeze for the weekend.  Makes for great late nite snacks, unexpected guests and breakfast pizza too!

Mine was more chewy than crispy.  I served it with a Rachel Ray recipe for a white pizza with artichoke.  Very rewarding!  I modified the recipe by subbing olive oil for vegetable oil, about 1/2 c whole-wheat flour and the rest bread flour, honey instead of sugar, and vegetable broth instead of water.  I also added some garlic-herb seasoning.

Top notch! Our new favorite crust! The crust was crisp and chewy, and not floppy. I doubled the recipe, subbed olive oil, and honey instead of sugar. I added 2tsp vital gluten, 2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 - 1/2 tsp black pepper. After the 1st rise I punched down, split in 1/2, rolled out and let rise a second on the pans. I then baked for 7min at 350 before topping and cooking for 15 minutes. My son doesn't normally eat the end of the crust, but he was dipping his in extra sauce because he loved it so much!

This is the ONLY recipe I used for pizza crust. I add basil, oregano, and parsley as well as crushed or minced garlic. I also don't use the dry milk powder and it comes out perfect every time.

This crust has good flavor and texture but I might try adding some additional spices that others have suggested next time as it seemed it was missing a little something?  We used a 16" pizza pan and had a nice, thick crust.  I followed the additional directions given by MillerMommyof4 and things turned out quite nicely. After the dough cycle, I placed dough on lightly floured board and let it rest, rolled out and and let it rest some more (had to let it rest a little extra b/c it was tough to roll out at first), brushed w/olive oil & pricked crust w/fork. Baked for 15 min at 400, added toppings and baked an additional 15 min.  My two little boys, hubby and I finished off the whole thing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This crust is very good.  I cut back on the lemon juice and sugar based on others' reviews.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I added a 1/4 tsp each of oregano, parsley, basil and a garlic clove and LOVED it!!!  When it was rolled out, I brushed with olive oil.  This will definitely be my go-to crust recipe!!!

I chose this recipe because it seemed a bit smaller than other recipes and I wanted to spread it out and have a more thin and crispy crust.  It worked well, but it was a tad too sweet for my taste.  I spread the dough into a 16" greased pizza pan, let it rise for about 10 minutes, then baked it at 400 degrees for 3 minutes.  Then I spread it with my sauce and toppings and baked it for another 14 minutes.  The crust came out nice and thin and crispy.

Delicious pizza crust! I didn't use lemon juice and used olive oil. Used about 3/4 tsp of salt instead of the 1/2 tsp called for. I made one good size pizza with the dough, on my pizza stone. Excellent when grilled over an open flame on the bbq. It only took about 12 minutes to fully cook.

I loved it!  This was so easy to make and it turned out fabulous.  I prebaked it at 425 for about 8 minutes, then I put a white sauce, broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes and mozz. cheese on top and baked for another 20 minutes at 350.  This was really so easy, it makes me never want to eat frozen pizza again.

This was a great crust recipe!  It didn't rise as much as I would like (more like thin crust) but that could have been a case of user error and not the recipe itself.  We will deffinitely be using this on pizza night again!

This is a great and easy pizza dough recipe.  I've made it several times as is or adding spices to the dough.  It also can be used for deep crust pizza using a 9x13 inch baking pan which I will be making again tonight!

There were nothing but compliments about this crust. I tried it because I was out of olive oil. It was a great pick. It is tender all the way through.

Our family LOVES this recipe!  It has more of a bread type crust, which we like better.  As a heads-up; I made a double batch in my breadmaker and have to say that next time I would do each batch by themselves.  I think the breadmaker had to work a little too hard!  We love using this recipe for our calzones too.

My husband and I agree this is the best pizza crust I have made. I love that I can make two pizzas with it. I will often substitute part of the white flour with whole wheat. It has been the only pizza crust I have used now for over a year.

I've tried most of the pizza dough recipes on this site and this is certainly my favorite. The dough comes out soft and very easy to work with. I double the recipe and stretch it over an extra large cookie sheet, letting the edges hang over. I top with sauce and toppings and then fold over edges to make a nice thick edge crust that overlaps the toppings a little. I brush on some olive oil to help it darken a little and sprinkle italian seasoning and grated parm over the entire pizza. I tried baking just the crust a few times and then adding the toppings but I find I like it better with the toppings right on the uncooked dough. I bake at 450 for about ten minutes, and I set the cookie sheet directly on a preheated pizza stone. Awesome. I'll always use this one from now on.

This is the best crust I have ever made.  It is crispy on the outside but nice and soft on the inside.  The closest thing to restuarant crust that I have found.  I baked my crust (without toppings or sauce) at 350 for 15 minutes before adding the toppings.  It gives you that extra crispy crust.

We have used this recipe for the last two years and have homemade pizza at least three times a month.  It is great!  Sometimes, when the bread machine beeps to add ingredients during the mixing stage, we add in parmesan cheese and Italian seasonings.  I am sure you could all kinds of flavorings to it.  The kids devour it.

This is the best pizza crust ever!!!!  The only thing I did differently was using olive oil in place of the veggie oil.  I doubled the recipe because I wanted to make 2 pizzas and even after rising it fit perfectly in my bread maker.  I think my bread machine is a 2 lb. loaf, though I could be mistaken, it might be a 1.5 lb.

Love it, love it, love it!  My whole family enjoyed this crust.  I used olive oil instead of veggie oil.  After rolling, I did brush with olive oil and a little garlic powder mixed together and prebaked for about 10 minutes.  Added ingredients (pepperoni and cheese for the kids, zucchini and tomatoes and cheese for DH and I).  Awesome!  It will become a weekly recipe for us!  Thanks!

This is my husband's and my favourite pizza dough recipe, and we have tried several recipes. It is so chewy and delicious! We just make this recipe by hand since out bread maker broke. We have made it with and without milk powder - we noticed no difference so now we omit it. We use regular flour, not bread flour, just because that's what we have on hand.

This was a very good pizza dough.  I didn't have lemon juice but I had lemonade and used that with no problem.  I also used olive oil.  Will make this again.

Great texture, love the taste.  Wish you could have put cooking instructions on it (what temp to cook at and approx time)  I cooked mine at 400 for about 30-40 minutes for a loaded pizza.  Taste was great and love the crunch.  Could not tell lemon was in it at all but you could definitely tell there was a little something once the sauce hit it.

Delicious.  A little harder to work with than what I am used to, but I usually make a thin crust so that's probably the difference.

Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside - perfect!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed the ingredients as listed and it turned out perfect.  I wasn't able to use the entire dough the first night I made it, so I stored it in the fridge and made a stromboli with it the next day...I let it set out and room temperature before rolling it out.  My husband and I were very pleased!  Thanks for sharing!

First time making this pizza crust recipe and it was so much better than the bread machine pizza crust recipe I have been using.  I substituted 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour for the bread flour.  That was the only change I made.  This will now be my permanent pizza crust recipe.  I used this crust with the Butternut Squash Pizzas with Rosemary recipe.  Great combination.

This is a fabulous pizza crust.  It is very similar to a hand-kneaded recipe I've used in the past but this one is even better.  The bread machine makes the crust much lighter and airy, if that makes sense.  I added some onion and garlic powder, ground rosemary and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also, I only had powdered buttermilk on hand and used that instead.  It has a slight tang so I eliminated the lemon juice.  The dough does come out slightly sticky but it's nothing a gentle dusting of flour won't fix.  I bake my pizza in an electric oven at 425° for about 12-14 minutes which is perfect.  Nice and brown on the bottom, soft, chewy and delicious.  This is the only pizza crust that I will eat the whole piece including the edges.  Thank you very much for this excellent recipe - it's a keeper!

This was the best pizza crust I have ever made!  It will also make wonderful bread sticks.  I will definately be making it again and again!

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now.  Didn't realize that I had never left a review til now.  I double the recipe and use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I have frozen the dough for later use and have pre-baked the crust ahead of time for when I am making pizza for a crowd.  It is my family's favorite.  I have also used the dough to make calzones. Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

Wow, is all I have to say!  First time I made this pizza dough in my bread machine and it was a major success!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and this was my only substitution.  I followed exactly.  I put a little olive oil and cornmeal in the pizza pan too, before adding dough.  It was definitely a deep dish crust and so next time, I may try to split the dough to make 2 thinner crust pizza.  Awesome!!!

This was exceptional! The only difference I made was to use bread machine bread..and used the whole 3 cups of that.. I didn't have the other flour..and from what I've seen its a little pricey.. We oiled the pizza pan with olive oil and sprinkeld it with corn meal before putting the dough on it. The dough was easy to work with! After the rise cycle I took the dough out and broke it in two.. flour the surface of the counter and rolled it out.. the patted it into the pan. The only recommendation I would offer is to pre cook the dough for atleast 5 minutes in the oven before adding the sauce and toppings. While waiting for the dough to brown ( I like mine more crispy than doughy) I burnt a little bit of the cheese. Of course the pizza stone heats up more evenly and prevents this from happening! I'll have to try it on the stone next time. A+ on this recipe! We will definitally be using this again :-)

The Lemon juice added a fun twist.  This was delicious.  I added Basil and Thyme after the first beep on the bread machine.

This is the best pizza dough I have ever had. Not just the best I've made... EVER   HAD.
My husband even said "normally I'm not one to say this but you need to go out of your way to leave a review on this recipe". 
Just fantastic. I always double this recipe for my family, then bake them using crisper pans (they are the kind that look like cookie cooling racks but round for pizza)
I can't wait till later in the season, when my garden is growing. I am going to make homemade sauce, use garden fresh veggies and homemade cheese.  
If I could give this six stars, I would!

Not bad. I liked that it was thinner than my normal go-to crust recipe.  Certainly was simple to make - just throw all the ingredients into the bread machine and wait until the bell sounds! I might experiment by adding some seasonings of some type to it and I think I needed to bake the crust by itself for a little bit as it didn't seem "crisp" enough for me under all my toppings and sauce.

This is a great recipe. I used bread flour & whole wheat flour in equal parts & added 2 tbsp of wheat germ. Other than that I followed the recipe. Since I used my bread machine all the rising is done for you. I rolled & stretched it into two 12" pizza crusts. I knew I was supposed to let it rest & rise again but time was short. I brushed it with olive oil & Italian seasoning, poked it with a fork all over before pre-baking at 400° for about 10 mins. After browned I added my sauce and toppings. I baked it at 450° on the highest rack in the oven until the cheese was a little browned. What I got was 2 very tasty pizzas and another chance to sneak wheat germ into the kids food. Much better than take out for sure.

Great recipe.  I tweaked it though.  Instead of vegetable oil, I used extra virgin olive oil, added 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the dry flour,  and put it in my bread machine.  I doubled the recipe and made 1 pepperoni and ham pizza, and a barbecue chicken pizza.  (recipe next)
-Boil 2 chicken breasts
-when done chop up chicken, put in a bowl
- add generous amount of barbecue sauce mix together 
-(optional) mince enough pickled jalapeños to put on pizza (I only put it on half)
- top pizza with BBQ chicken, jalapeños  and  cheese 
- bake for 20-25min. 
This recipe is a hit in my house!

Thanks for this great recipe, very good crust indeed. I substitued 4 tablespoons of milk for 1 tablespoon dry milk. For an excellent crust don't forget to oil the dough with extra virgin olive oil before adding the sauce, this way the crust will not get wet.

This was pretty fab!  Great consistancy, really easy to work with and turned out great tasting (I have had several epic fails in my pizza crust making in the past so this time was a great experience).  
Everyone in my family of 6 loved it.  This will be my go-to crust recipe.  
Only thing I will change is add a little more salt to the mixture (we like the salty crusts)
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

By far the BEST pizza dough recipe I have ever found!!  I split the dough in half (or just make half the recipe) for 1 pizza- its a thinner crust.   And I would bake just the crust in the oven at 450 for a few minutes and then add on the sauce and cheese.  I use an entire 8oz packet of mozz cheese- it is the best!

I made this as written except added some basil to the dough and made a Philly cheese steak Stromboli with it.  The crust is super yummy - the outside is crunchy but the inside is light and chewy.

This recipe is great!  I'd never made homemade pizza before and found it easy to work with.  The only thing I changed was using olive oil instead of vegetable oil, 1 1/2 cups of white bread flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat bread flour, and I also used rapid rise yeast (instead of traditional).  I added my toppings and put it in a 400 F oven for about 15 minutes.  What I'm wondering is whether the sugar is necessary as I found the dough a little bit sweet.  Next time I will try it without.

I've tried many homemade pizza crust recipes, but have never been completely satisfied until I tried this one.  I use a pizza stone and bake at 450.  The crust comes out crunchy on the outside and tender and yeasty on the inside.  And, I love being able to use the timer on the bread machine because the pizza is ready to make when I get home from work.  I just made a spinach pizza with homemade alfredo sauce.  It was better than any pizza I've ever had!

This was a good basic crust that had the right texture.  I thought the flavor was quite bland, though!  Was surprised with all the stellar reviews.  Guess I'm still searching for my perfect bread machine pizza dough recipe...

I have been making this recipe in my bread machine for a couple years now. Only change I have done is add 1 1/2 tsp basil & 1/2 tsp italian seasoning. It does take some time for the bread machine & the "resting" of the dough to complete the pizza, but well worth it. I can't see why I need to look for another recipe when this recipe works well   : )

Rather simple but delicious recipe.  The bread machine did all the hard work.  All I had was all-purpose flour and added a dash of my favorite spices to the mix...still came out great. I also put a light coat of butter-flavored spray to help brown the crust and add to the flavor.  After laying the dough nice and thin with my favorite toppings...the wife and kids ate all of it down to the crust.

I have tried several pizza dough recipes, and always have the problem of the dough being to chewy. This dough came out perfect! I didn't have any evaporated milk, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I used this for pizza for tweens, they loved it. I'd like to make it again for the adults, and add some seasonings to it. Thanks for sharing!

Very good. This was the easiest and most elastic dough I have ever worked with. I'm not too experienced with dough but if I had had the know-how I could have twirled this one in the air, it was so elastic and so easy to work into shape! (I did try to figure out how, but after dropping it on the table, fear of losing it the floor stopped further attempts!) I don't have a bread machine so I mixed hot water, yeast, and sugar in a small bowl and let it stand until foamy, about 15 min. Then I added the lemon juice, oil, and salt and mixed it. I mixed the milk powder with flour in a big bowl and then added the liquids and stirred til it was too thick for the wooden spoon then used my hands to knead in the last bits of flour. Made this into a ball, covered it with a Tbl of so of olive oil and covered the bowl with a damp towel and let it rise for about an hour. Then made two pizzas with this. Great crust.

This was good but I expected more. I'll probably try other pizza crust recipes.  The dough was easy to work with.  I used kosher salt but probably should have used regular table salt as the crust tasted a little bland.  I pre-baked for 5 mins on a baking stone, added toppings and baked only about 5 mins more - all at 425. Pizza was VERY crispy..not burnt, just cripsy.

I've been looking for a good pizza crust recipe for awhile now and the search is over!  I made the recipe as written but I added some italian seasoning and some garlic to the dough.  It was very tasty.  The dough was easy to work with but it did take some patience to shape it-letting it rest in between is a must.  I brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled it with some parmesan cheese and baked it at 450 for about 10 minutes.  I sauced and topped it and baked it another 10 minutes or so-my kitchen smelled like a pizzeria.  The only comment I had is that I used a jarred sauce and it seemed waaay too salty-I'm planning on trying the Easy Pizza sauce from this site next time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This crust is awesome. I replaced water with beer.  Cruncy crust on outside, nice bread texture on the inside.  Flavor was great.

Perfect.  Crispy on the bottom and chewy inside.  We loved this.  I didn't have dry milk so I enlisted the help of the wise minds on the Recipe Exchange...  I was told that the milk makes it chewy.  They suggested 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup regular milk.  It worked great.  Between this crust and Exquisite Pizza Sauce on this site, it was the best pizza I have ever made.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and good dough.  I made it for the Pepperoni Bread on this site--to use instead of frozen bread dough.  Worked well and baked up nicely.  Thanks!  I'll try it again for an actual pizza.  :o)

Yum. I haven't made homemade pizza in a long time. This was a beautiful crust that you can adopt to your tastes. I spread butter on it before adding sauce. Thanks!

I will never buy store bought pizza dough again!  This was definately the best pizza dough I have ever made (ok, the first but it will also be the only kind I will make).  Like a few others, I did not add the lemon juice and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I let it rise in balls after the dough cycle and again after I rolled it out.  I doubled the recipe and easily got 2 pizzas (one rectangler) out of it.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of oregano but I think I will increase it next time.  I brushed some olive oil on the crusts and let them cook at 400 for about 5-7 minutes and then added the toppings.  This is a must as the pizza dough won't cook fully before the toppings are done.

This is a good recipe.  It does take a while to shape the dough.  For me I find it easiest to use a rolling pin but the dough does fight it a bit.  I doubled the recipe and got enough dough for 2 cookie sheets.  I didn't bother prebaking mine since we prefer a softer texture to the crust.  I topped with pizza sauce, italian sausage browned with garlic, mushrooms, bell peppers, and mozzarella cheese.  I sprinkled some parmesan and a bit of Italian seasoning over the top and baked at 450 for about 10 minutes.  Good stuff!

This was okay. I have made lots of different pizza crust recipes and this turned out to be a little chewy for me.  My husband seemed to really like this one so I might make it again. It's a good basic recipe to have on hand.

This is a wonderful recipe!  After I started I realized I was almost out of bread flour so I used 1/2 cup bread flour and 4 cups regular flour (for a doubled recipe) and it still turned out perfect!!  I got two cookie sheet (approx 16 by 12) pizzas and the crust was crispy and chewy, my husband and I both loved it.  I will use this recipe again for sure!

This is one of the better recipes I've tried,(though my favorite was in the kid's section of my Quick Cooking magazine, I lost it quite a few months ago, can't even find it in the archives) It made one pizza stone sized pizza, and another about half the size of the pizza stone, I wish it had made a little more dough though.

Wow!  Cynic that I am, I was not expecting much from this recipe given the poor outcome I had with another pizza crust recipe from the site.  This is the *best* (and easiest) homemade pizza crust I have ever made.  We used a large cookie sheet and prebaked the crust so we got a somewhat crunchier result than I imagine others have gotten, but it was GOOD.  Great flavour!  Next time I'll try adding herbs and maybe parmesan cheese to the crust too.  YUM!

We loved this! I made the exact recipe. After the machine was done I left on the counter covered for a few hours. Then I put some olive oil in a bowl, dropped the dough in, covered and put in the fridge last night. Pulled it out today, cut in half & made two small pizzas. The other half went back in the bowl for another night this week. We took some tomato paste, added some herbs & a teeny bit of sugar. My son and I each pulled our dough, a little olive oil, added sauce, tore up some fresh mozzarella, and a bit of Parmesan. I did sprinkle corn meal before putting the dough into the pan, didn’t stick at all. Then in a 425 preheated oven, about 15 minutes. I like crisp crust with a little chew inside and higher temps seem to deliver. Holy cow was it good and so easy! I make bread on Sunday night for his school lunches. I’ll be adding pizza dough at least once a month since the machine is out and it’s so simple. Short of letting it warm up about 30 minutes before we tried to shape the dough the pizzas took maybe 8 minutes to assemble. Big win! Delicious!

Excellent recipe! I have a big family so I made this recipe x5 and did not use the bread machine.  I kneaded the dough using my Kitchenaid mixer, let it rise till it doubled in volume and divided it into pans. The crust baked to perfection! I used a thin crust for some pizzas and the crust was nice and crunchy resembling a wood oven pizza from an Italian restaurant. I used a thicker crust for others and it turned out soft and chewy, so delicious. I would definitely make this again! Thanks for such a good recipe!

I scaled the recipe to 16 servings as I find 3 1/2 cups of flour makes a nice thickness of crust for us. I did not have milk powder so I used 1% milk for the water, 1 1/4 cups. I used half all purpose and half Robin Hood Omega 3 whole wheat flax flour. I added 1 tbsp of vital gluten flour and upped the yeast to 1 tbsp, for seasonings added basil, oregano, garlic powder and onion powder 1/2 tsp each.  Baked pizzas at 475 degrees for 18 minutes, rotating pans halfway through, then broiled each top for 1 minute to crisp up. Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe! I made grilled vegetable pizza for #10aday Allrecipes Allstars Canada March Challenge, it was very good.

I have made this recipe several times.  I have made it as stated and it is great!  I have also made substitutions when I didn't have a couple of the ingredients and it still turned out great.  When I didn't have lemon juice I used apple cider vinegar.  Then when I didn't have powdered milk, I used regular milk and just reduced the water by that amount.  I always double the recipe.  I also make the dough and then freeze it for later use.  That works really well too!  Thank you so much for this great recipe!

My new favorite pizza dough recipe! It rises nicely in the oven. The crust browns nicely and soft inside. I paired this with my.fresh batch of home grown/homemade pizza sauce, it was amazing! I'm going to make a Stromboli  with this next and make cheese sticks!

I have tried several pizza crusts and this is my favorite. It is now in my little book that holds my go to recipes. Even the bottom of the crust looked so nice, lots of little holes.

This recipe makes a wonderful pizza dough. I just recently started using my bread maker again and decided to give this dough a whirl. I made a double batch, but other than doubling and using olive oil instead of vegatable oil, I followed the recipe exactly. Quick,easy and delicious. My 11 yr old son declared the pizza we made "better than any pizza place makes". This one is a keeper in our house.

I made a few changes to the recipe because I didn't have exact ingredients. Instead of 3/4 cups of water I put 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup milk since I didn't have powdered milk. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and lime juice instead of lemon. I also added Italian seasoning to the dough. It turned out great, good flavor and baked up crisp and was pretty easy to spread. Definitely a favorite!

This crust is truly awesome! Thank you for a fabulous recipe!!! It was a great stretchy crust with super amazing flavor! This is a crust I would make for guests... Tried several crusts & could not say that about the others. Did not prebake crust but started the crust off at 375 for 5 mins than 450 for another 7mins broiled the top for 1 min.

I have used the most helpful positive review recipe for yrs now.  Just a  fine dough when done.  Sometimes a little off, but my doing, maybe something not as fresh as could be.  And always make the double as leftovers reheat well.

This is fantastic! I left out the lemon juice, substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil, added 1 tsp vital wheat gluten and about 1 Tbs Italian seasoning. I stretched it to about 10 inches and let it rest for 20 minutes, then rolled it to 12" which was the perfect thickness for us.  I pricked it with a fork, brushed it with oil, added sauce and toppings and baked at 425 for 15 minutes. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a wonderful pizza crust.  I substituted 1/2 c whole wheat flour for the nutrition.  I pre-baked it for 10 min at 450F before adding toppings.  I baked it on a pizza stone with cornmeal on it and it had a nice texture and browned lightly on the bottom.

I always double the recipe so I can easily get 2 thick crust pizzas. I use cookie sheets to make rectangle pizzas. I only baked crust 5-10 minutes and then add toppings and place back in till cheese is melted. This gives a softer chewier crust for a thick crust pizza instead of thin and crispy.

This was just as the author stated--crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I didn't think it was chewy or tough, and the dough was so easy to work with. I've never made crust before, and this turned out better than I hoped--it was perfect! My family thought it was the best pizza they ever had and said I should open a pizza shop. I'll never tell them how easy it was! ;) I followed the recipe exactly. I did add another 1/4 c water as the dough ball was forming in the machine as it was too dry. If you've not worked with yeast before, make sure your yeast is fresh and that your water is not cold; the water should be room temp (slightly warm--not hot). This made a 14 inch round for me, and I could have gotten it to 16 inch for a thinner crust.

This worked out very well for me.  I substituted olive oil for vegetable and used a teaspoon of white wine instead of lemon juice (too lazy).  After topping it with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni I baked it on a baking tray in a 500F oven for 12 minutes:  perfect.  Next time I will roll it out thinner as it gets quite a last minute rise in the oven and my husband prefers thinner crust.  Thanks!

So far this is my favorite pizza crust recipe at Allrecipes.  Other crust recipes are good, but this has the best flavor, though I had to add a little more water than recommended (in low-humidity conditions in the middle of winter).  I made it in the bread machine where it took 1.5 hours.  When the machine's beeper went off, I took it out and worked the dough into a rough circle.  If you know about dough, you have to let it rest a couple of times when you work it for this purpose.  I used it for a white pizza - a thin coating of olive oil on the unbaked crust topped with homemade ranch dressing, grated carrot, black olives, pickled onions, and goat cheese and bleu cheese crumbles.  Baked on a pizza stone at 435F for an undetermined time (I didn't time it, but did keep an eye out).  Totally Yum!

Best homemade pizza crust we have ever had. Very easy, soft but with a nice crisp. I just added some spices to mine like garlic, oregano, and Italian just to flavor it a little. Wonderful. Thank you!

Great Recipe don't hesitate to try it! Just make sure you use bread flour trust me it makes it so much easier to roll out or shape into a circle for your pan! Double the recipe and you can get two large pizzas out of it. Love this recipe! We have been eating pizza once a week now. Kids and husband can't believe how good homemade tastes compared to the local food chains! Love it!

Delicious recipe!  Make sure to use a pizza stone that is preheated in the lower rack of a hot oven.  It helps to use a pizza paddle dusted iwth cornmeal to slide it on and off the stone. This is key to a crispy crust like that in a pizza parlor. I, too, sprinkle oregano and garlic powder before putting in bread machine.  Also, 1/2 tsp more yeast.  Try it, you will LOVE it!

Extremely yummy!!!!  A household hit.  Like many other reviews, I left out the powdered milk because I can't find it.  I also added Italian seasoning.  Yum!

I have used this recipe for several years, it tastes great, has a great consistency and is very easy to do.  I sometimes double it if I need two pizzas and that works well too.  Saves us a lot of money and is not a big time consumer.

I have used this recipe several times and found it to be perfect for all of the toppings I use.  It holds up very well and has a great texture and flavor.  I am going to use it tomorrow for an alfredo pizza.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Excellent crust!  Only change I'll make next time (and there WILL be a next time!) will be to reduce the lemon juice to 1/2 tsp.  However, the full teaspoon of lemon juice would be perfect for a "white" pizza or one with chicken instead of the traditional Italian style. I did add 1 tsp vital wheat gluten.

This is an excellent recipe!  And like most reviews, I changed something... I added some herbs - about 1-2 tsp of each: oregano, basil and "garlic and herb" Mrs. Dash seasoning.  Turned out excellent!  I added the herbs in the beginning with the rest of the ingredients.  I also made 4 small pizzas with this recipe.  Baked them at 375 for about 12-15 mins.  excellent!

Simple to make.  I put in 1% milk instead of the powder in the recipe and it worked out well.  There's nothing about temperature in the recipe... 350-375 degrees works well, although the higher temperature might burn the cheese if you aren't careful.

I have tried several pizza crusts, and this by far is the best. I doubled the recipe and made three good sized pizzas. I also poked holes and brushed with olive oil before baking. Delicious!

Pretty tasty... I didn't have any milk powder... and the store I went to to get it had it in extra jumbo size that I didn't want to try to fit into my small kitchen cabinets... so I didn't use it.  Left me wondering how it would've been different?  Before I baked this pizza I covered the outside of the crust with a melted butter and garlic powder mixture.  YUM!

Wow tried this last night, I made personal pizza's for the kids, and they loved it, so much that they want it again for lunch, so my bread machine is busy mixing.  The only thing I did different is I had no lemon juice so I subtituted with vinegar and added a bunch of spices (garlic granules, oregano, italian seasoning, parmesan cheese, onion powder) and I poked holes in the crust before prebaking. This is absolutely delicious!!

This recipe was fantastic! I've made a lot of pizza doughs, and this was the best. It must be the dry powdered milk that is making the difference.  I did find that it wouldn't double, though, in my bread maker. I ended up having to knead it by hand.

This is THE BEST pizza crust. I had to use a little more water than the recipe called for, but just a tablespoon. It was fun dough to work, too. You can't have homemade pizza without tossing the dough! Thanks for this recipe. It's in my go to file to impress my friends.

I made this recipe because I was out of regular flour and I'm glad I did!!! I doubled the recipe and used it to make one large 15" x 20" pizza. I pre baked the crust for 8 minutes at 475 degrees as another reviewer recommended, then added my toppings and finished baking.WOW!!! It really tasted like a sicilian pizza from a pizzeria.It was even better cold the next morning! Yum!

I didn't have milk powder, so I used 3/4 c 1% milk in place of the water.  I just baked this at 450 degrees for 5 minutes, without toppings, cause hubby won't be home for a while. It looks absolutely amazing.  And I did pick a peice off. so good.  Not a crispy pizza crust.  Soft and tender.  I sprayed the pan, a cookie sheet cause I don't have a pizza pan, and then sprinkled it with cornmeal.  Rolled the dough out in it.  and then brushed with olive oil, sprinkled a little more cornmeal, and sprinkled parmesan cheese.  Can't wait to eat it!  May never order in again.  I used to use the pizza dough packet mixes, but this was sooo easy and so good.

This recipe for pizza crust is AMAZING!  Not only is it super-easy - the ingredients are ones I usuallly have on hand.  I made it twice last weekend and both times it turned out perfect.  I topped it with "Easy Pizza Sauce III" (recipe also from this site) and it was awesome!  I will be making both recipes on a regular basis from now on.

This is an easy & delicious pizza crust recipe!  I substituted 1/4 cup whole wheat flour for 1/4 of the bread flour and I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. oregano to the flour.  My 6 year old LOVED it!  I spread cornmeal on my pizza stone and pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes.  Very tasty!

I followed everything as recommended. It turned out a bit bland and not crisp like I was hoping it would. Unfortunately this recipe isn't what I was looking for and won't make it again. It wasn't terrible though....

WOOOOOW! Out of the 5 pizza crust recipes I have tried in the past two months, this is the best one I have used! I added a bit of garlic powder and a sprinkle of oregano to the mixture, to add even more of that italian flavor we love so much. It was so good, even the boy that eats nothing but pb & fluff said "Mum, this is the best food you have ever cooked"! I used "Easy pizza sauce III" from this site (which I modify with a bit of sugar). I don't think I will need to try another recipe, as this one ROCKS!!! Thanks Jay!!!

After reading all the wonderful reviews for this recipe, I was really expecting something great, but this just didn't wow me. It was okay, but I'm not sure that I would take the time to make this again.

I've tried this 3 or 4 times and the only time I can get it to be halfway decent is to use it as a crust for a grilled pizza.  If I bake it, it leaves a lot to be desired for.  I'm rating it a 4 based on the grilled version.

This was great.  I made the recipe, divided into thirds and froze two.  The other one I threw on the grill for grilled pizza. It was delicious and held up to the high heat and heavy ingredients quite well.  Thanks!

I don't eat pizza, but I made this for my husband and he loved it!  Went on and on about it.  Said it is right up there with some of his local favorite pizzerias.  Only changes I made were:  omitted lemon juice, substituted olive oil, and added 1.5 tsp of vital wheat gluten.

I do not know what I did wrong, because I followed the directions, but YUCK.  It was hard and tastless.

This is the best pizza dough I've ever had! I made two changes: I left out the lemon juice because I didn't have any, and I added a little Italian seasoning to make it interesting.
The pizza crust was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and was super firm. Even with a ton of toppings, it wasn't soggy or filmsy. We raved about it for days. :)

This pizza crust is very yummy!  I didn't add the lemon juice, and I used shortening instead of vegetable oil.  Crust is soft w/ a crisp shell.  Dough takes some time to shape, but it was worth it!  I was surprised, but the dough was not super sticky, unlike some other pizza doughs I've made.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  I will make again!

Great pizza crust- I substituted half with whole wheat flour because I enjoyed the whole wheat pizza dough I bought at my local grocery store and it turned out exactly the same and tasted better! Didn't have dry milk, didn't use it....didnt effect the taste but perhaps made it harder to spread out on the pan (?) Nonetheless this is going to be a staple for homemade pizza from now on. Biggest plus is my house smelt like an authentic New York Pizzeria for the whole day!

Tasty..the whole family loved it.  I scaled it for 15, and it made enough for a regular size pizza pan and a deep-dish size 8 inch pan.  Easy and no-fail!

Wonderful consistancy, easy dough to work with. Tastes great!  I did add a little Italian seasonings to the dough, and I used Buttermilk powder instead of plain milk powder (don't have milk powder) and it turned out great!  We will be making this again! Thanks Michele!

What others have said is true...this is the ultimate best pizza crust recipe!  I added a little garlic and italian herb mix, and substituted olive oil for the vegetable, which gave it a more authentic flavor.  My family wants pizza every week now- and thanks to my bread machine, I can do it!

Best pizza crust I've tried so far, with or without the machine.  Very easy to prepare and extremely forgiving if you go wrong.

Just finished gobbling this up! It was GREAT. Okay, this is strange...but I substituted lime juice for the lemon and it added such a lovely "fragrance" to the crust. I toppped it with a quick cooked tomato sauce, extra virgin olive oil, kosher salt, grated parmesan & the world's best cheese & parsley sausage (thanks to my local butcher). Whatta meal! The crust was a true standout! Know that this is a flaky crust...not real chewy. A great change of pace!

Excellent crust.  I was much better than another one I had tried from this site.  The bread machine does all the hard work.  I'm using it again tonight.
