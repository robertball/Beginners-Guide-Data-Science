There is something wrong with the amount of fluid - it didn't form a dough and needed lots more liquid. Also you had salt in the ingredients but didn't mention where to add it in the instructions. The loaf was a bit of a disappointment - I've had much better stollen.

Total disaster!! Not enough liquid is correct. An expensive recipe that flopped.

It was good but I found it very heavy. Tasty though!!!! Stollen is dense but is not heavy/solid when sliced as I found this recipe to be.

I read the reviews about not enough liquid so I was apprehensive but it turned out perfectly. In fact it's about as close as I can get to the dresdener stollen I buy from Germany! It does appear too dry when mixing at first but I mixed it in a kitchen aid with the bread attachment and once I poured in the fruit/nut mixture with the excess rum it did what all of my other bread does balls up around the bread attachment and kneads itself against the bowl. I hand kneaded for about 5 minutes followed the rest of the instructions and I couldn't be happier with the result. Now with the yeast I mix it all up with a chop stick and put the bowl by my wood burning stove until very very frothy but I do that with all breads. The key is this is not a cake it is a bread and must be treated like it. Hats off to this stollen. Best I've ever made!!!

Not good not good at all! The liquid to flour ratio is way off and 1 packet of yeast (2 3/4 tbls) is just not enough to give any rise at all. It seemed like there was 1 1/2 -2 cups too much flour for the total liquid for this recipe. This stollen is heavy as a brick and practically inedible. I looked at other stollen recipes and the liquid to flour ratio is more like 2/3c liquid to 2 1/2 c flour or 1 1/2 cup liquid to 5c flour. I'd recommend trying one of those recipes instead.

Yes definitely too little liquid. Didn't even wet all the flour! Added about 1/2 cup more milk per recipe; that made it gooey enough to hold together; rest of prep was uneventful (it's baking now!) Also used variety of rehydrated dried fruits (pineapple peach raisins cornelian cherries) and black walnuts replacing the almonds.
