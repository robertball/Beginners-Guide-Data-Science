Yes, it is THAT good.  A nice chewy molasses cookie. EXCELLENT flavor.  When storing these (and other cookies) store a piece of bread with them to keep them moist, otherwise they dry out like rocks!  But these are exactly what you're looking for - easy, idiot-proof, and EXCELLENT.  MAKE THEM NOW!!!!!!

Substituted butter for the margarine and brown sugar for the white.  They turned out fabulous.  The are the most consistent and uniform cookies I ever make. Tastes like a soft ginger snap. My husband requests them again and again!

I have made these cookies about 15 times over the past few years and they always turn out great. I also use butter instead of margarine. After rolling in sugar and placing on baking sheet, I slightly flatten using a smooth bottomed glass.  Depending on my mood(and time) I will glaze with a simple home-made frosting.  Make sure to watch the timing on these cookies, it is critical.

very good, however I took the advice of others and made some changes. Doubled the spices, only 1tsp of baking soda, and used brown sugar. I also dipped all the cookies in powered sugar after they were cooled and it was not only pretty but delicious!

This is my favorite cookie recipe I have found on this site. The spice is just right, not too subtle, not too strong.  They are wonderfully soft. I have, however, made one change.  I use one teaspoon baking soda instead of two.  I thought the soda taste was too obvious, and when I halved the amount they turned out perfect.  I also found that if I just slightly softened the margarine instead of fully melting it I was able to skip the chill time.

I made them exactly except I used only 1 tsp of soda as suggested. Also, since I don't like eggs, I used egg substitute ( good for vegans!!) and they came out perfect.  I creamed the sugar in softened, NOT melted, unsalted butter. The dough mixed nicely with the 2 cups of flour. I chilled the dough for a couple of hours, which worked out well. My baking time was about 10 minutes in a gas oven @ 375 F. They cracked beautifully, and the taste was chewy and soft with a slightly crisp top, due to the sugar. I love them and will bring then to my holiday parties. I'm keeping this recipe for future use.

very tasty.  I Changed a few things.  I halfed the soda as suggested.  I also used brown sugar and butter instead of margerine and a splash of vanilla (you just can't bake without vanilla).  I cooked them for two different times.  They're prettier when you cook them till 7 minutes because of they crackle but 6 minutes makes a chewier cookie.  Next time I'll double the spices.  Thanks for a good recipe! My one year old thinks it's good too!!  PS Don't listen to the people who say that batter turns out runny, there's obviously something they missed in it.  The dough is lovely.

Nice flavor.  Maybe it's my oven, but these took less than 8 mins.  I started taking them out at about 7 mins and the last sheet of cookies removed were actually burnt.  Leave them in a ball when you bake and don't flatten them (like I did on some).  They are better thick and chewy, otherwise, they are more crisp like a gingersnap.

Every year my family has a "bake off" when we get together and bake cookies and give them out to friends for Christmas.  But, being the highly competitive people that we are, we make it a contest.  For the first time in 7 years of baking, I won with these cookies in 2005.  I was thrilled!  I followed the recipe exactly, since I'm really not much of a baker. The results aren't in yet for 2006, bu so far I am in the lead with two recipes that I also got from this site.  Thanks to Brenda and all the others who post thse wonderful recipes!

I've made these several times--my husband begs for them!! They are his absolute favorite. Be sure to use margarine and not butter. Butter makes them spread and they also come out way too saltly.

The perfect recipe for SOFT molasses cookies WITH these following revisions: Use butter and dont melt it like stated, just make it room temp for mixing w/ the sugar. Use brown sugar in place of the white in the mix. Last, dont cook for full time stated. Mine were perfect at 7 min - not any longer! Just until the cracks form around the edges and the center still looks a little "gooey". They will firm up when cooled. Store in air-tight container with a piece of bread and they will stay soft for a good week or more (IF they last that long). I also added some white chocolate chips for a twist on the usual. Made this recipe twice - 1st following the recipe to a "T", 2nd with my changes. 1st time they came out hard and 2nd they came out VERY soft. Glad I gave it a second shot. A keeper now!

I grind my own flour and found that I needed more than 2 cups of flour, I ended up after baking a batch adding more flour and then they turned out great.  In the future I will use 2 1/2 cups of flour.  I did use butter as it is MUCH healthier than margarine (it's natural, margarine is NOT) and also used brown sugar.

These were very good! I only used 1 tsp. of baking powder. I also added another half tsp. of cinnamon, and I also added about a tsp. of vanilla. Instead of rolling them in plain white sugar, I added some cinnamon in with it, and then topped the finished cookies (which i baked for 8 minutes) with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. VERY good!

When my Daughter-in-law gave me a plate of these SCRUMPSIOUS cookies, I asked her for the recipe and was surprised to find it was from Allrecipes.com. I have been a member for years but somehow missed these gems. These cookies are SOFT, CHEWY, DELICIOUS and FOOLPROOF. After reading all the reviews the only conclusion I can come to, for those having trouble with this recipe, is they are measuring wrong, not chilling long enough, or their ovens temperature is off. It’s certainly not the fault of the recipe. I too prefer DARK brown sugar but I still use margarine, butter makes the cookies spread out more. By the way, place day old cookies in the Micro for a few seconds and they're like they just came out of the oven. These cookies are easy to make and simply WONDERFUL!

These cookies were EXCELLENT!  A big hit with my boyfriend and roommates.  Because my boyfriend is on a diet, I substituted for butter, and you couldn't even tell (which usually I find it takes away from the cookie to take out the fat).  Instead of 3/4 c. margarine, I used 1/2 c. fat-free vanilla yogurt (I used one container of vanilla Yoplait yogurt) and 1/4 c. applesauce.  Trust me, they're delicious!!

WOW!! These cookies are to die for. Not too mention they have a powerful, spicy delicious aroma that is practically intoxicating!! THE BEST recipe for molasses cookies by far, and with a few slight modifications these are some of the best cookies EVER. Instead of 1 whole cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I think this helped make a richer flavor. Also, I did 1/4 cup MINUS 1 tablespoon of molasses, and then added 1 tablespoon of honey (thus, molasses + honey = 1/4 cup together). Also, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and reduced the baking soda to 1 teaspoon. Although it sounds like a lot of modifications, it really wasn't, and I think it make all the difference because the cookies were phenomenal. Like other reviewers have said, the true key to success with these cookies is to not over bake them. Even if they seem a little gooey when you first remove them, just let them sit on a rack for a little bit. What I love most about these cookies is how nice and soft they are even after completely cooling. In fact, I usually love cookies warm out of the oven, but these are best once they've cooled. My husband as well as two friends looked disappointed at first when I told them I had made molasses cookies, but after trying them they couldn't get enough!!

The last batch of this molasses wonderment is cooling on the rack at this very moment.  These cookies are perfection just as the recipe is written.  I did not (and would not) change a thing!  When forming balls, I simply dropped a spoonful of dough into the sugar and rolled them around in the bowl with another spoon.  The dough is very sticky.  They do not have to be formed into a perfect ball.  I would not press them out at all, but be sure to allow plenty of room between cookies.  They do spread and flatten considerably, forming a perfectly round cookie.  These could not be any easier!

The cookies came out fantastic and stayed soft.  They had just the right amount of spices.  You can even underbake them slightly so that the middles are soft.  Great recipe!

My great-grandma used to make these when I was little and I've been searching for a recipe that tasted similar to hers. I took others advice and doubled spices, used real butter, and half brown sugar. These were delicious!

Excellent!!! I recently made these to send to my husband in Iraq. He liked them a lot- I love them! They're chewy, spicy and delicious. They mail well, too. I used store-bought molasses and it worked fine. Thank you for a superb recipe.

I was tempted to give this 4 stars, because as written I'd imagine it would not be as good as with 2x the spices, like other readers suggested.  I doubled the ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.  I did use the 2 t baking soda. I also used a stick of margarine, and half a stick of butter, as I find the best cookies are a mixture of butter and margarine.  I also added a splash of vanilla out of habit.  The dough was so absolutely amazing I almost sat down with a spoon to eat it.  Don't flatten the cookies before baking, I did on my first batch and they didn't crack and spread out thin.  I ended up baking them 8 minutes.  I have an aunt who makes molasses cookies for christmas and dips half the cookie in white chocolate and they are absolutely astonishing.  If you are looking to give these as gifts, that would be impressive.

When I made these I was a little skeptical.  I never really cared for Molasses Cookies (store bought) and I specifically made them as a Christmas gift for my daughter's boyfriend who loves molasses cookies.  Well, I was amazed at how good they really are.  I used Dark Molasses and they come out a deep, dark chocolate and a very attractive cookie to boot.  My husband and I loved them and immediately made another batch to include as gifts for all the kids and their friends.  Everyone who tried them, raved about them.  They are part of my permanent Recipe Box.  This recipe definitely deserves a 5-star Rating!

I have been making these cookies, using this recipe for two years now.  They are a huge hit during the holidays and I get requests for them all throughout the year for school and church fundraisers.  So Ms Hall; thank your mom for me!  The only change I made is that I use 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder.  When I do that my cookies come out looking exactly like those in the photos.  They are soft, chewy, and full of flavor.

The original recipe by itself only gets about a 2 star from me.  However with a couple of minor changes they are wonderful.  First of all, use real butter instead of margarine, and DO NOT melt it.  The first couple times I made these, I used very soft, room-temperature butter that I had left sitting on the counter for several hours.  They turned out perfect.  Today I just made them for a potluck but did not have time to let the butter soften, so I melted it, as per the original recipe's instructions.  They are not nearly as good as when I've made them with softened butter.  For starters, the finished cookie has a greasy taste to it that coats the inside of your mouth.  Second, the cooking time has to be altered if you do use melted butter.  When I use softened butter, I bake at 375 degrees for exactly 9 minutes and they turn out perfectly.  With the melted butter, I baked at the same temp and for the same time, and they are very nearly burned.  I have a feeling they will harden up quickly, too, whereas if made with softened butter, they stay nice and chewy for days.  So do yourself a favor and let your butter soften for a few hours before making these, and you will have a delicious, soft molasses cookie.

These cookies are amazing!  I had to make more the next day!  Make sure that they only cook for 8 minutes, they are quick to burn if you do not keep your eye on them.  I also add just a tad more molasses so they taste less like a ginger snap. Yummm yumm!

Fantastic cookies! SO good! The entire apartment smells awesome! I did modify it a little bit. I doubled all the spices. I used room temperature vegan margarine (so I could skip the chill time). I used 1 teaspoon of baking soda. I added a teaspoon of vanilla (who doesn't add vanilla in everything? :) ). I baked them for 7 minutes and on parchment paper. Came out fantastic! Thank you!

Wow! These cookies live up to their rave reviews. They turn out beautifully and taste amazing. This recipe has made me throw out all my other molasses cookie recipes. I used butter instead of margarine, but I followed the recipe otherwise.

I love this cookie.  I have been making it for a couple years.  I add a little extra flour as it seems to help them sit up a little better.  Make sure that the dough is well chilled.  Also, I do go a little heavy on the spices.  They are very moist and chewy.  I usually sprinkle a little coarse sugar on top of these before they go in the oven for a little extra special touch.  Crowd pleaser!  Oh, I also use butter instead of margarine and use brown sugar instead of the white

My family LOVES this cookie and a MUST bake in the fall!  Try it with Pumpkin Dip: (1) 8oz pkg cream cheese softened, (1) 18oz can Pumpkin Pie Mix (make sure it's the pie mix!), 2 Cups Confectioners Sugar, 1/2 to 1tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/4-1/2 tsp ground ginger.  Beat cream cheese till smooth, add pumpkin pie mix, beat well. Add sugar, cinnamon, and ginger.  Store dip in refrigerator.  Mmmmmm!

These came out perfect.  The only change I made was in using 1 stick butter and 1/2 stick margarine (I couldn't bear using all margarine) and softened these instead of melting before creaming with the sugar, egg and molasses.  The cookies baked for exactly 9 minutes and the recipe yielded exactly 30 cookies.  They are deliciously crispy on the crackled outside, and nice and soft on the inside.  I will make these again.

Made several dozen of these cookies during holiday season.  The teens, the mailman and the hubby devoured them...saying they were the best cookies they had in quite some time.  The ginger is definitely the key to this fabulous chewy cookie!

I replaced the margarine with salted butter and left out the salt. They turned out great. My wife hates molasses so I made her try it with her eyes closed and she immediately said "YUMMMMM." All of the flavors balance out very nicely.

I read over all the reviews before making and decided to use butter instead of margarine.  Since so many used brown sugar, I used 2/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup regular.  I reduced the baking soda by half.  I should have eliminated all the salt since my butter was salted (my mistake).  I doubled all the spices. 

When I mixed the ingredients, I did not melt the butter but softened it a bit. I chilled really well and then used my cookie scoop to make uniform in size and shape.  As suggested, I flattened some with a glass and mine had to bake 8 minutes to achieve the results we wanted.  They are so professional looking.  My husband thinks they're great!  Thanks to all for the suggestions.

Use butter, don't listen to the margarine people, they don't know what good cookies are, and couldn't bake their way out of a paper bag. Also use a half cup or more of molasses. When the recipe says the size of a walnut it means a whole walnut: unshelled, about 2-3 TBSP. cheers.

The reason why I'm giving 4 stars is that I didn't make it exactly to recipe.  One person I'm cooking for doesn't get along with ginger so I omitted it. I'd have doubled it if I were making it for myself alone.  I doubled the cin.  I usually shun margarine due to my upbringing but I know the crinkles & that lovely texture come from margarine (or lard; gasp!) so I used it. I wasn't sure what size to roll the balls to get 30 cookies so I just did the often standard walnut size. About the size of a quarter but a titch smaller.  It made 56 cookies which I think is great + if you are doing these for a holiday where there are other sweets, then it allows for more sampling. Muahahaha.  Ahem, anyway, I rolled them in brown sugar as I didn't have coarse sugar on hand. Also could have done it with colored sugar(s).  I almost added cinnamon in the coating as well but decided not to this first time.  I also didn't roll into sugar for about 1/3 the batch as a favor to a friend of mine who prefers way less sugar than is natural. These are my kind of cookie, crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. I cooked mine for 9 minutes & immediately placed then on a wire rack to cool.  They are sturdy enough to be able to do that.
Edit: I made these again today. I didn't have margarine so I used butter. I did my little tweaks.  I ended up making them about golf sized this time & ended up with 19 cookies.  These taste better cooled than hot & even better the next day to allow spices to infused.

A good cookie overall.  We only added 1/2 cup of butter and the texture was still nice and chewy.  Too much baking soda though-- you can taste it over the sweet.  Cut it in half and only put 1 tsp in.  The spices were more of a hint than an actual flavor and we like spices so next time I will double the amounts to better suit our tastes.

They were great.  I wasn't so sure how they would turn out since the molasses  smelled weird.  I never cooked with molasses before so I wasn't sure.  This was a great cookie.  I will be making this for Christmas for sure.  Thanks Brenda Hall!!

Excellent cookie.  Nice shape and thickness.  Mine needed 10 minutes to bake. I did increase each of the spices to almost double, and added cardamon, nutmeg and allspice as well.  Used the full amt of Baking soda and other ingredients. I doubled the recipe and got 100 cookies. Had to count them quick though a bunch has already gone!;-) Could have made them a tad smaller to get the full amount indicated in the recipe. Will be making these cookies again.  Oh, I did not melt the margarine.  By the time the margarine and sugar was beaten it was a pretty sloppy batter.  And was still a very wet dough when the rest of the ingredients had been added. It needed to sit in the fridge to set up some.

Excellent.  I modified by using egg replacer instead of egg and smashed balls before baking.  Turned out perfect in every way.  Kids even loved them even though they have a very adult flavor.

Gave these out to neighbors this Halloween and got really positive feedback including a statement that "they may be the best cookies I've ever had."  I didn't have any ginger so I just replaced it with some allspice and nutmeg.  The consistency and flavor is awesome!!

Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside. I used butter rather than margarine, brown sugar instead of white and halved the baking soda as some reviewers suggested. I did need to bake them for about nine minutes (maybe because of the altitude here). I think this is a great recipe, and I will use it again.

Delicious, but I think 375 was to hot, decrease to 350 for the same amount of time and they were great!  The 375 were hard and to dark.

my dad bought some molasses cookies while visiting amish country (lancaster county, pa) recently and hasn't stopped talking about them.  i made them for him today as an early father's day treat, and he was ecstatic.  apparently they are just as good as the amish! i'm not a huge fan of molasses so i think they're just so-so, but for someone who enjoys this type of cookie, i've been told it's as great as they get.  thanks!

These cookies are exceptional.  I was looking for a soft molasses cookie like the one Wegman's makes and this cookie fits the bill.  My kids love molasses cookies and I will certainly be making this recipe again and again.

These cookies are the best that I have ever had.  They are so moist and chewy.  Everyone that has had them just really enjoy them.  One word of advise. Do not substitute the margarine with butter. I tried it because I did not have margarine and what a flat cookie I had! It still was delicious but the margarine makes them nice and plump. I have made these several time already. Thank you!

These were great cookies! The first time I made them they came out rather flat. I made them again using butter flavored shortening and adding another 1/4 c flour. They came out beautifully this time. I added buttercream icing to the first batch and took them to work. People just could not get enough! I heard from so many people that they were the best cookies they've ever had.

these are good cookies!  I made with pomegrante molasses so they came out incredibly dark, almost burned color with the cooked sugar on top but these are still incredible cookies.

I love chewy cookies! These are my new favorites! Everyone who's tried them has loved them...even little kids! I like using butter and creaming it with the sugar. Rather than putting the batter in the fridge to firm, I just add a few extra tablespoons of flour and use spoons to shape the balls. I sprinkle them with a bit of sugar (sometimes granulated, sometimes Raw) and they come out wonderfully! Oh, and I tend to leave my cookies out overnight to ensure their chewiness. I guess that's a great benefit of living on the coast!

I bake a lot but maybe I did something wrong.  Even after refrigerating the dough I had a gooey sticky mess even after adding more flour.  I ended up dropping spoonfuls of dough in sugar and then rolling them.  They tasted fine but more like a ginger snap than the molasses cookie I was looking for. However, they were very good and I'd make them again.

If you like ginger snaps, you will love these cookies. They are extremely easy to make and taste absolutely delicious! I made a different batch of cookies while these chilled in the fridge, so it worked out great. If you're looking for quantity rather than size, shape the dough into balls about half the size of a walnut. I did the walnut size and it made only 2 1/2 dozen.

These were yummy and pretty too.
They make big cookies if you follow the directions by making them walnut sized. 
I baked mine for 9 minutes and 30 seconds, but, I think I would like them better at 9 minutes.   Really good with milk.  I think they would be even yummier with a little powdered sugar frosting drizzled over them.

The mix is easy but must refridgerate for an hour. so make up and refridgerate then make another type of cookie while waiting.  A little sweet but very tasty.

I followed this recipe precisely.  The batter was easy to put together.  I chilled them for a couple hours but they still weren't firm enough to form, so I let them sit in the fridge overnight.  DEFINITELY check your size on these; I tried using my standard cookie scoop that makes an average size cookie normally, but they turned out way too big.  Walnut sized is exactly right.  But I had the same problem many others did in that they spread like crazy.  I did 8 (instead of my usual 12) to a tray and they still stuck to each other.  Also I decreased my time to 5 minutes and they still came out thin and crispy and dark.  No beautiful cracking or shape.  They also stuck to the cookie sheet terribly; I definitely recommend using parchment paper or greasing your tray.  (I tried both ways; parchment paper worked better for me.)  Also, if you make a larger batch as I did, divide your dough for chilling; about the time I got halfway through, the dough was too soft to form and I had to chill it again.  If there's a next time (I usually give recipes a second shot before completely dismissing them!) I'll soften the butter/margarine instead of melting it as suggested and I'll probably add some more flour.  I'm a good baker, but these cookies mystified me.  I don't know why they didn't turn out like most of the reviews suggest!  :(

This is an excellent cookie. I made a few changes but followed the basic recipe. I used 1/4c Shortening 1/2c butter. I only used brown sugar(it will make any cookie moist) and I decreased the baking soda to 1 tsp. Lastly I didn't have ground ginger so I used 1tbs pumpkin spice. LOVED THEM, I will make this ASAP!

I was running around the first time I made these and forgot to add the spices but loved the cookie without them. Now I can't go back to the original recipe. I've tried them rolled in sugar before you cook them and without. Both are good but the sugar really adds to the initial bite. Everyone wants to know what they are when I offer them one but soon come back for more and more. I have had people fight over them and hide them from spouses!! Tammy if it spreads too much for you try chilling overnight and dropping the backing soda.

I didn't think there was enough flour.  Even after chilling for an hour or so the dough could not be rolled.  It was even difficult to drop onto the cookie sheet.  I added some more flour, but it was still an off consistency.  The flavor was good, but I won't make them again.

Help please.  After reading all the positive comments on this cookie recipe, I decided to make them and followed directions completely.  They unfortunately came out flatter than a pancake and I can't understand what I did wrong.  They have a good taste, but I love the thicker, chewy cookies.  Thanks!

7 minutes if you want a chewy cookie. 10 minutes will almost make a snap cookie. Heaven! Baking soda flavor was only obvious if eating the cookie hot from the oven. Everyone loved them. 2 batches and both times made exactly 45 cookies if using 1 level tablespoon of dough.

The taste was wonderful, however I read the top couple of reviews and decided to use butter instead of margarine and brown sugar instead of white.  They were pretty thin, so I'll try again sometime and use margarine as the recipe states.  Otherwise they were a fun little cookie!

These are so fabulous. Like other reviewers, I halved the baking soda, substituted brown sugar for the white, and doubled all spices.  I also added about a tsp of almond extract. I doubled the recipe and used an ice cream scoop to ball the dough. My cookies came out huge and delicious! Thank you!!

Very close to Trader Joe's Molasses Cookies!  Tips: try turbinado sugar for sprinkling, cover the cookies until serving, and double the spice - All for a spicy, soft, and rich cookie.

My husband has a childhood memory of Molasses cookies. I have been searching and trying the recipes that I have found. Miracle of miracles!!! My search is over! This must be it, because he loves the cookies. The one thing that he said that his Mom used to do, and I also do now is leave some of the cookie doe in the frig,  so you can have a few cookies anytime you want, or anytime your oven is on!  We just love 'em!

This recipe was extremely easy to follow. My very first batch yielded perfect, delicious cookies. I did modify the recipe, however, incorporating tips from Barefoot Contessa's ultimate ginger cookie recipe on foodnetwork.com. I used 2 1/4 cups of flour and 2 ts cinnamon vs just 1. The extra flour made the difference. I also added a quarter cup of whole milk to the mix as I was stirring in the butter. Another tip is to forgo flattening the cookie. Leave them in their round form on the cookie sheet after rolling in sugar, since they'll flatten of their own accord and don't need extra flattening. Generally, the 2t of baking soda was fine. Also, I used a little over a third of a cup of molasses rather than just a quarter.

I made these recipe as written and they were great. I would make some changes next time. I would add more spice as I really didn't think they were powerful enough. I like a good adult cookie with powerful spice. When you are an adult you are going to only eat 1-2 cookies with a good cup of coffee or tea and you want a lot of flavor. I didn't cool and roll out the cookies. I scooped them out with a small scoop and then pressed them down with a juice glass dipped in granulated sugar. They came out uniform and crispy on the edges. Don't be afraid to experiment with spices and flavors. Just keep the basic recipe and then go out on a limb.

Yep, these were to die for.  My kids are not your novice taste testers.  Cookies to them are like wines to celebrated wine connessuers.  Very flavorful, chewey, and crispy.  Intoxicating bouquet while they bake.  Our entire family couldn't stop eating them.  Enjoy

These cookies have a great texture, chewy in the center and crisp just on the edges. I didn't have any cloves on hand so I used 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp ginger. Other that that I followed the recipe exactly and they came out awesome! My new favorite!

Fabulous! Followed the recipe exactly. It took less than 8 minutes to cook, so keep a close eye on them. As soon as the tops crack, they are done.

These cookies were as promised-soft, chewey and yummy!  I used a Tablespoon ice cream scooper and baked for about 8 minutes.  They cam out not only soft and chewey but with crinkles on the top as well.  Try rolling in red or green sugar for easy christmas cookies.

Delicious! The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine. Next time I'll try brown sugar instead of white but they were really good as written. My family ate them in one night. Definitely a keeper.

Wow! These cookies live up to their description. Great tasting cookies that stay soft even after being frozen. I did add a bit more flour per reviewer suggestions but otherwise I followed the recipe. I have recommended these to many people who all love them.

These cookies are amazing! I had to add a LOT of extra flour to the first batch to get them to roll into balls. After taste testing, I liked them enough to make a second batch right away, but wanted to correct the dough. I realized that if the butter's NOT melted, the ingredients turn into a very workable dough without extra flour. The key is to use SOFTENED butter, NOT melted!

These were amazingly good !!! ( Even the first batch that was in a few minutes too long, they got hard but tasted like a gingersnap!). Doubled the amount of spices and added vanilla extract and a little bit of honey. Will definitely make these again !!!

These are awesome! I reduced the baking soda to 1 tsp. and used brown sugar instead of white in the dough, as others suggested. I also upped the spices by half (1 1/2 t. cin, 3/4 t. cloves and 3/4 t. ginger) and added 1/4 t. white pepper!

Great cookies.  Both crispy and soft with that great spice flavor.  I modified it by using 1 tsp baking soda, 1 cup dark brown sugar (instead of white), and sprinkling on powdered sugar at the end.  At 10 minutes the tops were crispy and the bottoms were soft, a great contrast.  Leave 2 more minutes for crispier cookies.

This is a super recipe! I added 1/2 a teaspoon of allspice and 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg, which probably changed the flavor slightly. But texture-wise, they are chewy and they turned out great.

This recipe is identical to the one I received from my pastry chef grandfather, though his doesn't include an instruction to melt the margarine. Perfect every time, always well-received, and I often make double batches. If you're having problems with runny, spreading batter, check to be sure you've used UNSULPHURED molasses.

These were great cookies!  I added a 1/2 tsp nutmeg into the mix for a little more spice.  The cookies were originally chewy but quickly became hard after I put them in a cookie jar.  However, then they become ginger snaps and are fantastic with milk!  This was a great, easy recipe that I'll be making again.

I loved how my Molasses cookies came out. I thought they where soft but crispy all in the right ways. The flavor of the ginger was nice in there but you surely do not miss out on all of the other great flavors from the spices and also from the molasses. This is a cookie that I will make more then one time. I give this a 5 out of 5 stars. That is how good I think this is.

Great and easy recipe.  I used baking powder (three times what you would use) instead of baking soda because I didn't have any in the house.  The cookies turned out great.  Moist and chewy.  My husband ate 5 cookies fresh out of the oven.  I will be making these again.

These cookies are ok.  I followed the advice of some, i did half butter, half margarine, halved the soda.  Spice mix is ok as written.  Was expecting these to knock me out, they were alright, I've got a recipe I like better. Won't make these again.

I only used 1 tsp of baking soda instead of two and doubled the spices as well. Also used brown sugar instead of white. I accidentally threw in only a 1/2 cup of butter (instead of 3/4 cup) and they turned out just fine. Oh, and a splash of vanilla, too. I'm glad I read the other reviews first; it really helped improve the recipe. This is one of my all-time favorite cookie recipes.

This is a delicious cookie!  I followed the advice of others and used 1 tsp baking soda.  I didn't have powdered ginger so I peeled and grated a tablespoon of fresh (I love ginger).  I also cut back on the butter to 1/2 cup and used 3/4 cup brown sugar (not 1 cup white) and increased molasses to 1/3 cup.  I also added a tiny grating of nutmeg and also added vanilla as someone recommended.  
I did not chill the dough.  I used slightly hard/cold butter (unsalted) and spent longer mixing the egg and sugar until smooth.  I oiled my hands to roll the walnut sized balls, slightly compressed them and coated the tops in turbinado sugar.
I baked at 375 for 7 minutes in a convection oven. they stayed well formed but soft.
Amazing!!

What made them perfect for me was using 3/4 stick of butter instead of 3/4 C. margarine, brown sugar instead of white, 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp. of the ginger.  They were perfect and everyone raved about them.  I also sprinkled a little granulated sugar on them when I took them out of the oven for a sparkly look.

Used 2 1/4c flour, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ground cloves. Try brown sugar instead of white, and you can always use half whole wheat flour/ half white flour. Don't press them down with a glass- the cookies end up too flat.

These were good, not great. I doubled the recipe and used butter instead of margarine, not sure if that made a difference or not. I try to stay away from margarine and certainly never bake with it. These turned out very thin and crispy, which was fine, but not sure I will make them again. Perhaps another molasses cookie recipe next time.

Use golden brown sugar instead of the white sugar and salted butter instead of margarine.  I also rolled them in Turbinado brown sugar and cooked for no more than 8 minutes.  Some of the best cookies I have ever made.

I read through the reviews before making this cookie to see where I could make the best cookie without any cookie mishaps. I used butter instead of margerine, half each of brown/white sugar and I doubled the spices. I chilled the dough most of the morning to insure that they wouldn't spread. Eight minutes at 375* was just right for me. Letting this cookie set on the cookie sheet right out of the oven for a minute or so will help the cookie firm up and not go wonky when you try to remove it from the baking sheet. Really good spice cookie but doubling the spices is absolutely necessary, at least for us.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I've been looking for a Molasses recipe for a while, and I found this one the best. I've made it twice, and my husband love it. Last night I didn't have time to bake, so I left in the fridge for this morning, and it was just perfect. But I baked for 7 minutes, otherwise it would be too dark on the bottom which I don't like. Other than that... PERFECT!!!!!!

My family has made these cookies forever.  It is an old, but great recipe that my mom got off a Brer Rabbit Molasses bottle in the 50's.  I've played around with the recipe over the years to "perfect" it, but always return to the original one.  You just can't change perfection!!!

These cookies are phenomenal, exceptional.  After practicing making them a few times, I made them to impress my future husband's parents (totally worked!) and it got rave reviews. I kept catching his dad, who claims not to like sweets, sneaking a cookie or two out of the jar.  The tip about storing them with a piece of bread it on point. I also make them by softening the butter (but I find that I still need to chill the dough at least a little).  Now that fall is almost upon us, these are the perfect seasonal cookie.

Used brown sugar instead of white, and butter instead of margarine. Other than that kept eveything else the same. Used a 1 inch scoop and cookies took about 11 minutes to bake. They tasted good, but like others have mentioned, they turn out pretty flat. Next time I will do as others suggested and cut the baking soda down to 1 tsp.

I decided to make these as my husband loves molasses. I made the changes most people suggested such as using softened butter, brown sugar and only using 1 tsp of baking soda. I also substituted nutmeg for cloves as I didn't have any. The taste of the cookies was brilliant, however they ended up very spread out and flat. I would make them again, however I would add the additional tsp of baking soda so they would rise more.

The flavor and texture were alright, but the cookies turned out greasy and flat!  The only change I made to recipe was to use unsalted butter instead of margerine.  I'm going to attempt the recipe once more and let the dough chill overnight.    If it still doesn't work out, I'll move on to a different recipe as I really dislike baking with margerine.

DELICIOUS. I almost doubled the spices and used only real unsalted butter. Also halved the Baking Soda. (I never eat margarine). Met and maybe even surpassed my hopes. THANKS!

I made this AAA+ winning recipe today, but I had to adapt it because I had slightly different ingredients on hand than what the recipe called for (i.e. used butter instead of margarine, pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves and raw "turbinado" sugar instead of white sugar to roll the cookies in).... I also love the taste of ginger, so in addition to the ground ginger, I  added 1/4 to 1/3 cup of crystallized ginger bits to the batter.... Since I was in a big hurry to bake the cookies and get them to the post office (mailing Valentine's Day care packages to my sons), I didn't have any time to chill the dough in the fridge.... I used my trusty cookie scoop to keep the cookies all the same size, and after rolling them in the raw sugar, I placed them on parchment paper-lined baking sheets (makes clean-up a snap). Finally, I removed the cookies after only 8 minutes and they were done to perfection! I am happy to say that none of my above-described improvisations diminished the fantastic, chewy, spicy flavor of these cookies one iota! Brenda Hall's recipe is a keeper! Since I doubled the recipe, I ended up with exactly 60 cookies... some to mail, some to eat and some to share!

After reading the reviews and making some small changes of less soda and butter instead of margarine, and brown sugar instead of white. These are delicious, soft, moist, cookies with the perfect spice to them....I have a hard time not eating the whole batch. I used my pampered chef cookie scoop and it made 27 perfect cookies. I will use this now as my favorite recipe.

I used salted butter (I didn't have unsalted) so I omitted the salt. I added more spices (heaping tsps!) and did 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 cup white sugar for the dough. Also i only used 1 tlb. of baking soda. Threw the dough in the fridge for 15 - 20 minutes. Came out perfectly!

My favorite molasses cookie recipe EVER. The only difference is that I use canola oil instead of margarine (someone I know cannot consume a lot of saturated fat). Still comes out amazing every single time! I would definitely recommend watching the cookies carefully - one minute too much can lead to dry, hard cookies. Oh, and I forgot the mention - these are soooo pretty - as they cool, they form the prettiest crinkles and cracks!

Love this recipe! It is all about the timing -- underbake and they're sticky; overbake and they lose that wonderful chewy texture. I usually leave them in about a minute after the tops have cracked, then take them out. I leave them on the pan for a few more minutes before moving to a cooling rack. Sometimes, I like to add a little extra "spice" to these cookies -- black pepper and cardamom are my favorites.

Perfect molasses cookies! Chewy with crisp edge, just how I like them! Only substitution was to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine.

AMAZING!!! I absolutely loved these and can't stop bragging on them. I substituted whole wheat for white flour, raw for white sugar, canola oil for margarine, and rolled in brown sugar as suggested. They were light, and tasted so buttery despite the lack of margarine. If you want a healthier version definitely give this version a shot!

Ginger/molasses cookies are one of my very favorite treats, and I work at a bakery that has really good ones.  I am still in search of a recipe that can compete with those, and these aren't bad.  I did follow the advice of a few reviewers and halved the soda, and doubled the spices.  I think next time I will definitely think about tripling the spices, especially the ginger. I also used melted,unsalted butter which worked great after chilling the dough in the fridge, and baked for 7-8 minutes for a cracked but moist chewy cookie.  Will definitely try again.

My son made these and the family loved them. He felt there was not enough spice for our family and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg,1/2 tsp of allspice, and an extra dash of cinnamon. THESE WERE WONDERFUL!

Fantastically moist!  I got sidetracked and the dough had to stay in the fridge for two days and they are still moist.  I think I will be flattening the next batch with a glass, though, they are a bit puffy.

These were delicious.  I used unsalted butter instead of margarine because I generally like butter better, and I didn't have any cloves on hand so I substituted allspice, which I was a little nervous about.  I took the advice of everyone and watched the time really well, 8 minutes left the inside soft while making the outside crispy.  They were an instant hit with my coworkers.

Very good!  These seemed undercooked when they hit the 8 and 10 minute marks, so I ended up cooking them a little longer.  They were crispy and buttery, with a mildly spicy zip.  I'll be making them again :)

Overall, very good recipe. Very moist and chewy ~ no problems with drying out. MY husband's personal favorite. To me personally tho, the molasses is too strong and almost overpowers it, but like I said it's all with personal taste. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. Very good and very easy to make.

This recipe is great!  Everyone loves these.  Sometimes for a change I use shortning instead of margarin, I substitute half of the white sugar with brown sugar, I use half of the amount of salt and half of the amount of cloves and DOUBLE the amount of ginger.  I bake them at 350 for 9 minutes and let them cool on the baking sheet for one minute.

This recipe was very disappointing.  My first batch spread out and burned even though I followed the directions exactly.  My second batch was better, but they never cracked on the top like a Molasses Cookie is supposed to.  I won't make this recipe again.

If you use a cookie dough scoop to ball up the dough, you'll get beautiful 3" size cookies, though that means that you only yield a little under 3 dozen cookies; it's worthwile to double the recipe.  Also, I replaced the 1 cup of white sugar with brown instead. Yum!  Great presentation.

The perfect cookie, crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.  I only made one change, I used butter instead of margarine.  A beautiful cookie to give for Christmas!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Very Good Cookie!  Only change I made to the recipe is I used real butter instead of margarine.  This is a very easy cookie to make and it tastes GREAT with a good cup of coffee!

These are the best molasses cookies!! The first batch I made did come out flat. I followed some very helpful advice of several people. I used butter instead of margarine. I soften the butter and creamed it with 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar doubled the molasses added 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice and 1 extra cup of flour. I  love that the dough keeps very well in the fridge. I can bake a batch when I have some extra time and have fresh warm cookies instead of baking the whole recipe at once. I also agree with JoanMK they are fun to watch bake. Thanks Brenda for a great recipe that I will use often.

Boy, oh, boy.  I don't know what I did wrong, but it appears that this recipe does not respond well to changes.  I halved it, wanting a few cookies for just the two of us, and used egg substitute.  The batter came out very thin, a little thicker than cake batter, and when they cooked they were sort of like little molasses pancakes.  Weird!  But they tasted alright.  Sorry, but I'll keep looking.

These are really good cookies!  My kids aren't crazy about them, but I just think they don't like molasses.  I did use shortening instead of margarine, and 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar.  I didn't melt the shortening, I just creamed it with the sugar, and everything turned out well.  I stored them in an airtight container, and they still got hard, but they taste great that way too, like a mild gingersnap!

I have made these cookies about a dozen times and they always come out perfect! Just a hint of crunchiness on the outside but soft and chewey on the inside. I take them to work and they last about 30 minutes.

Yum Yum Yum.  This is an awesome recipe.  The only alteration I made was to used double the amount of fresh ginger instead of ground ginger because that's all I had on hand.  They were fantastic!! I made them for my office Christmas Party and they were a hit!  Definately a keeper!!!

I love this recipe I have made it a couple times now! The cooking times are VERY important, but even if it is a little over or under cooked they are still tasty. One time I made these I ran out of ginger ( yes I make these a lot) and used nutmeg instead they were even better!!! Make sure you refrigerate it. I use butter instead margarine ( I do not see a difference except margarine is unhealthy) and regular sugar instead of coarse sugar, and they are delicious! Store them in a lock-in-lock or ziplock if you don’t want them to harden up. Super easy to make and clean up, follow the directions and if they don’t turn out learn from your mistakes and try again (do not feel bad, I have a friend who messed up making a brownie box mix! A BROWNIE BOX MIX!!!!??) So get in your kitchen and make these delicious cookies like, RIGHT NOW!

I've been using this recipe for years now. I often find myself thinking these are my favorite cookies. I follow the recipe exactly. I've used a couple different brands of molasses over the years and the best hands-down and the only one I buy now is Brer Rabbit full flavor molasses.  I also spray cooking spray into my 1/4 cup measure so that I waste as little molasses as possible.

Great standard recipe for molasses cookies, however I think what made these cookies better were the reviews of other people. I too used one tsp of baking soda and doubled the spices. I also used softened butter instead of melted margarine, which allowed the cookies to turn out a bit softer. I cut the sugar to ¾ cup and it was a hit at the party.

Like most of the reviewers, I made the following substitutions and it turned out amazing!

1. Used 1 tsp baking soda instead.
2. Doubled the spices
3. Used room temp butter.
4. Was very careful not to overcook. The first batch I took out at exactly 8 minutes while they were still soft (every oven varies). The next batch I left in for 10 - these were too crispy. I prefer them softer.

Otherwise, followed it exactly. With the modifications, it was perfect!

This recipe is amazing. I didn't have to make any changes the recipe because it's already perfect! My cookies came out perfectly and looked just like they do in the picture. The only complication I had was not placing the balls off the oven tray fast enough before it melted. When it did it made it a lot harder to roll the dough into the sugar. I suggest that when this starts to happen leave the batter of dough in the refrigerator for a couple of minutes until the first set of cookies in the oven are done. It should be good by then.

These are great! I followed the recipe exactly because I forgot to follow the other reviews and take out 1 tsp of soda until I had tossed the second tsp in. So I decided to just follow exactly and see what happened. These are perfect. Perfectly balanced between soft and chewy and crunchy. Perfect spice level. The only changes I made was to use bread flour rather than all-purpose because I read that made fluffier cookies, and I usually always end up with super crunchy cookies which I dislike. I also just used softened, not melted butter. Just set the block on the stove top while I was cooking dinner so it was warmed by the oven. Then I only chilled the dough while I ate dinner. probably around 30 minutes or so. My co-worker doesn't believe I actually made these. He's convinced I bought them from a bakery. This is definitely going in the recipe box.

Fabulous cookie -- I think the spice combo is perfect. I did use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugars... and butter.  They did kind of flatten out, but it's a small price to pay, and still so delicious.  Just say no to margarine.

I was disappointed at how these turned out, all I taste is butter. I think next time I make these I'll use only a stick of butter and a little more molasses, I prefer darker cookies, and maybe substitute some brown sugar for some of the white sugar, like some of the other commenters suggested.

This recipe (with the revisions) was fabulous!!! Soft, chewy, spicy cookies! Delicious! I took the suggestions of using brown sugar in the recipe in place of white sugar and I cut the baking soda in half as suggested, otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee! Will definitely be making these again and again!

These are delicious! And beautiful! I subbed butter, soft not melted, for margarine, and brown sugar instead of white. I also didn't have any cloves, so I used some allspice instead. They smell great, they are beautiful and uniform, taste delicious, and were very easy. I baked them for about 8-9 minutes at 325.

This wasn't a hit with me or hubby. The kitchen had a nice spicey holiday-ish aroma while they were baking and I instantly thought how wonderful it would be around Christmas. My cookies did stay soft for awhile. I won't be making this again, just not my cup of tea. I never baked with molasses before and I was curious, now I know! lol
 However, if you like ginger snaps this is right up your alley.

Don't over bake for softer cookies or let go a couple extra minutes for crunchier cookies.

Wonderful recipe, made just as described, except that I used butter instead of margarine. (Personal preference.) Chewy, flavorful, wonderful.

I converted this recipe to a gluten free dairy free one with some of the suggested changes and it turned out AHMAZING! I bake by weight, so here is what I used: 117g coconut oil melted, 215g organic brown sugar, 1 egg, 85g molasses, 272 all purpose gluten free flour(mine contains brown rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and xanthan gum), 1 tea baking soda, 1 tea salt, 2 tea cinnamon, 3/4 tea ground clove, 3/4 tea ground ginger and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Follow the instructions exactly, baked on parchment lined cookie sheets.  These stayed moist and delicious for as many days as they lasted in my house.  My 8 year old daughter picked these as her favorite Christmas cookie this year, even when sat next to traditional gluten and dairy filled treats!

Turned out great but I did use butter because I never use margarine. I also used brown sugar and cut the baking soda by half. Very nice flavour. With my oven, I had to bake them for 12 minutes.

Yummy cookies!  However, my cookies didn't crack much like others said.  I'm not sure if it's because I used Splenda Sugar Blend...  But it tasted soo good!

Loved this recipe!  So delicious!  I used butter since I had no margarine.  The first time I tried this recipe, the cookies came out flat and ugly - but still were delicious and addictive.  The second time, I used softened butter and whipped a lot of air into the butter before adding the sugar and egg using my Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  Then, I also stuck the dough into the freezer for a bit to get it nice and cold before portioning and putting into the oven.  Then they turned out beautiful!  I will make these every year for the holidays!

I have made these twice since my wife loves Molasses coookies. They were good the first time, but really different, more cake like. The second time, I must have measured things right, because they are really good, look right and everything. She loves them.

I've never reviewed a recipe on here, but created an account just to say that these are AMAZING. Easily one of my top 5 favorite cookie recipes, and exactly what I was looking for in a molasses cookie. I did do as other reviewers recommended and subbed butter for the margarine and brown sugar for white. Mine were done in exactly 8 minutes, and have stayed perfectly chewy for the past 3 days. Can't say enough about this recipe... thanks for posting!

These cookies are amazing! I was in a time crunch so I didn't chill the dough for an hour before cooking. They still tasted delicious, just a little on the flat side as I predicted anyways. Not sure why sugar is mentioned twice in the recipe, as no where in the cooking directions does it instruct to use the additional one half cup of sugar. I guess it is a mystery. Anyway my family LOVES this recipe, thanks!

This is a great cookie! After reading reviews, i too used room temp butter and 1tsp baking soda. I baked for 7 min and that left the center a bit "gooey". Next time i will bake a bit longer. Topped with powdered sugar these are scrumptious! Definately a keeper.

These are SO good! I made them gluten-free by swapping out all-purpose flour for white-rice flour and adding a teaspoon of Xanthan gum for each cup of flour. My friends couldn't believe it when I said they were gluten-free; they said they never would have known. Thanks so much!

These were excellent! I made them exactly as the recipe recommended and they were perfect. I set the oven to 350 instead of 375(because my oven is hot), and chilling the dough is a very important step; don't skip it.

Very yummy.  A word of caution, should you get the hair brain scheme to use maple syrup, don't!  I knew the dough was sticky and I tried to fix it, alas, I couldn't.  They ran into each other and looked awful, but tasted GREAT!  I will definitely perservere and try them again, with sugar next time.

Very good. My family wanted to eat them all!
I added more of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. I also did half white sug and half brown sug. I think it adds more flavor.  I found that I had to under bake the cookies for them to set up right. :/ Other then that, its a good cookie! Thanks! :)

An excellent recipe, with the changes suggested by others in the comments -- brown sugar, half the baking soda, twice the spices. 

I made a vegan, gluten-free, whole grain version, and they turned out just as good as the regular ones (though darker in color). Use the following replacements: 3/4 margarine: best with Earth Balance margarine; 1 egg: replace with 1/4 cup plain soy yogurt; 2 c flour: replace with 1 1/3 cup buckwheat flour and 2/3 cup millet flour, plus 1/4 tsp xanthan or guar gum. That's it! I'll be making many batches of these this Christmas to send as gifts.

I made these for a Halloween party and everybody loved them.  They have a great chewy texture, and just the right amount of spice.  I followed the recipe exactly.  No need to change a thing!

Excellent cookie!!!  Chewy and moist!  I doubled the spices are recommended from other members and they were DELICIOUS!  I threw in the rest of the sugar with the dry ingredients as well.
When they cooled slightly on the pan I put jam on one bottom and used another cookie to sandwich it.  Perfect Jam Jam cookie!!!

Absolutely yummy!  Soft, chewy, full of that molasses flavor that reminds me of Mom's baking.  The kitchen smells wonderful!  I used butter and I know that changes things up a bit, but I'm keeping this recipe.

Great recipe!  I subsituted white sugar with 3/4 cup brown sugar and reduced baking soda to 1 tsp. I also used a cookie scoop and the flattened slightly on baking sheet.  Allow lots of space between cookies as they rise nicely.  Be careful to not overbake and remove from the oven in set time even though they look soft as they will crisp when they cool.  My family loves them!

I frequently get the urge to bake cookies and I have tried a ton of recipes from this site.. some good, some, ok. This recipe was fantastic!
They were plenty spicy. it is just like a soft ginger snap. The only thing I did differently is that i added a small smidge of cinnamon to the sugar I rolled the dough in. Everything else was exactly the way it reads on the original recipe.
I don't remember if I had made these before, or not, but all I know is I will make them again, for sure.

This is an AMAZING cookie. I followed directions except to exchange butter for margarine. Be careful not to scramble your egg in your melted butter :0) They are soft, and moist and thick in all the right places. We devour these and share them with friends who LOVE them regardless of their opinion of Molasses. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE these cookies.

I love the spice blend on these cookies... yummy!  I was a little disappointed since the tops of my cookies never cracked. The 1st batch was in the oven for 13 minutes and all I got were well-done cookies with smooth tops. Maybe it was because I used the convection setting on my oven? Also, these cookies set up very fast so don't hesitate about taking them off the cookie sheets when they come out of the oven. Several of my cookies needed to be pried off the sheet, which pretty much destroyed them.

These were delicious. I kept the spices as written. I did sub half of the sugar for brown sugar. They also took longer to bake, probably because of the high elevation here. Very good, everyone loved them. Even better over the next couple of days if you can keep them around that long!

These taste great. Mine came out pretty flat, though, not like in the picture. I cooked for only 7 minutes, as other reviewers suggested, and they were already getting brown on the edges.

MMM MMM good! Only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine and I doubled the recipe.  Good tip to keep a piece of bread in the container to keep them moist.  Give'em a try.

This is the chewy molasses cookie recipe I've been looking for! Reminds me of the Archway molasses cookies which I always loved. After reading the reviews I used softened butter instead of melted margarine and I reduced the baking soda to just over a teaspoon. I tried them at 7 minutes and it may just be my oven, but they came out basically raw. At 9 minutes or so they were just right, and have stayed chewy since I made them yesterday. I though the spices were fine as given -- I don't want a spice cookie, I want a molasses cookie. Delicious!

I like to make not-so-sweet cookies for the holidays because everyone seems to be on sugar overload.  My husband loved molasses and milk as a kid so these seemed like just the kind of cookie he would eat.  I made the dough and let it sit overnight and baked the cookies the next day.  When my husband saw them, he asked if I bought them because as he said, they looked so "perfect!"  That's a great compliment if I do say myself!  I was concerned as to how people would respond to a somewhat old-fashioned type of cookie, but everyone who tried them, loved them.  The large batch I made on Thursday is gone and I have another batch of dough in the refrigerator so I can make them tomorrow.

These are AWESOME...a unique cookie taste that is perfect for the holidays. I modified in minor ways, including substituting Brown Sugar for the White Sugar, added more cinnamon and some vanilla extract. The second time I made them, I made a double batch but only had enough molasses for one batch...so I subbed in some maple syrup. Worked out FINE...still had the molasses flavor, but it was tempered with some maple flavors! Lastly, I used a recipe for "Butter Icing for Cookies" by "Barbara" to top off the cookies in swirls. I made the icing recipe, threw it in a ziploc bag, cut a small tip in the corner and drew random lines of icing all over the cookies. Added some red and green sugar crystals, and had ourselves a unique, exciting, and enjoyable holiday treat! :) Many thanks for this wonderful, new recipe!

I really wanted to like this recipe!!  But my cookies didn't turn out very well at all.  I triple checked the recipe after I finished making the dough, since it seemed so runny.  Even after chilling, I couldn't make the dough into balls it was so sticky.  That'll teach me to make the recipe before reading the reviews!!  I think melting the butter is a big mistake, but I don't know what else went wrong.  I wanted lovely crackle top cookies but this recipe didn't work out for me.

Can we say the BEST cookies I have made thus far!!  One thing i did differently was i didnt melt the marg. i only softened it.  My toddler helped mix it and i thought she might over mix but i stepped back and let her have at it, and in the end i dont think it matter how "mixed" it is it still turned out great!

excellent! I substituted brown sugar as well, and omitted the ginger because I wanted to make these cookies kid friendly.  They turned out delish!  I rolled the cookies in sugar as well as 'sugar in the raw' giving it a nice homemade crystalized look.  Sent these over to a friends house and they were gone before the night was over.  Can't wait to make these again come Christmas time when the oven is on every night! look no further, this is your go to recipe!

This is a wonderful basic molasses cookie recipe... I doubled the recipe since I usually make cookies for a crowd and changed it a bit by not melting the butter, adding the zest from 1 whole lemon, reducing the powdered ginger by 1/2, and replacing it with grated candied ginger (about 2-3 Tablespoons). I lie the fact that the recipe didn't call for a lot of molasses (I noticed some people increased the amount), and found that it allowed the other flavours to come through a bit. I baked a tray of them right away, but found that they did taste a bit better after refrigerating :) Definately will make these again!

Crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  Perfect amount of molasses flavor!  Easy recipe.  These are THE perfect Molasses Cookies.

These are by far the BEST molasses cookies I have made.  I have tried countless recipes and this one is perfect.  Just the right amount of chewiness on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside.  My only suggestion is to NOT refrigerate the dough.  I prefer to use it right after mixing.  I have never had a problem with stickiness which I think is because I use a cookie scoop and drop the balls right into the bowl of sugar.  They come out uniform and perfect every time.  It's hard to eat just one!!!!

Easy to mix up and smelled heavenly as they baked...but they were flat as pancakes - and I mean FLAT.  I double checked the ingredients and I did not miss anything.  The dough was chilled.  What could have happened?

Made these for my dad's birthday and they were a HUGE hit! The cookies stayed soft in the middle and slightly crispy on the edges - 8 minutes of cook time was perfect. I didn't have any cinnamon, so I used allspice. Also, I didn't think there was enough molasses, so I added another 1/4 cup. Used self-rising flour and omitted the baking powder, but still added salt. And used butter instead of margarine. Didn't crack the tops - the result was a perfectly smooth cookie. Excellent by itself or used to dip this site's Microwave Lemon Curd recipe.

These were delicious.  I made them at my daughters when we visited and they couldn't get enough.  I added more spices and used blackstrap molasses for a stronger molasses flavor.  This has become a family favorite.

These were fantastic.  I followed recipe as written.  The cookies came out crackle-topped, thin, and crispy-chewy (the think interior was a little chewy, with a mostly crispy outside - perfect) and with great flavor (I only mildly like molasses).  I thought they were too chewy out of the oven and I put them back in, keeping one out just to taste.  After a minute I did taste my sampler to find that the cookies crisp up upon cooling, so in total, my cookies baked for 14 minutes and were perfect.

My mom's are SOOOOO much better. My recipe has been in our family since 1789, and it is the best I have ever tasted. No molasses cookies could even begin to compare to my recipe. These are tasteless and bland. I do not reccomend this in the least bit to anyone. I won't share my recipe, though, it's a family secret. Don't try this recipe. I would give it 0 stars if possible.

Updating my review.  I didn't find this to be the perfect molasses cookie, but it has by far the best flavor of any I've tried so I keep coming back to this recipe each year.  I've had trouble with these falling flat and having a greasy texture.  I've made several modifications to the recipe to get the texture more to my liking, but I realized that my biggest problem was making the cookies too big.  The smaller the cookie, the less they seem to flatten.  The recipe states 5 doz (60 cookies), so keep that in mind when you shape your dough.

I thought these were really good and I am not a Molasses cookie fan. Everyone else who had them raved and asked for the recipe. I used butter instead of margerine, 1/2 cup of light molasses, and brown instead of white sugar. I did not have a problem with the dough, but I put it into the freezer for 2 days before baking. I also thawed and stored the dough(safely)in our garage, which in Utah, is much colder than the fridge! I experimented with a small batch first, and found that 9 minutes at 350 degrees was perfect. I used a tablespoon sized ice cream scoop to shape them and I  baked them on parchment paper. They did turn out as flat discs, but were chewey in the middle and crunchy on the edge. I dont care what shape a cookie takes as long as it tastes good. This one goes into my recipe box.

Very tasty, with wonderful texture of a little crunch outside with a chewy middle.  However, it needs some more molasses, next time I will try it with 1.5 times more molasses.

This made a great cookie, kind of like big ginger snaps. I was looking for a molasses "cake-like" cookie and tried this one. Not cake-like, but still great.

My husband says there's too much ginger, but I really like these!  I used half brown sugar and half white, and added a little more flour because the dough was extremely moist, but I won't do that next time.  It firmed up a lot in the fridge, but otherwise, I kept the recipe the same.  They'll be absolutely perfect the next time I make them, without the extra flour.

These were perfect for a the first cool day of fall and a huge hit.  There are only two left and five of us eyeing them!  Used butter and butter flavored Crisco to help them hold their shape and dark brown sugar instead of white.  Feel free to add a bit more spices if you like a little extra kick.  Great basic cookie recipe.

These are fabulous!  A few changes... I used butter and the full amount of flour but used whole wheat pastry flour for 1/2 cup of it. I also threw in 3T. of ground flax seed to sneak in some nutrition. So chewy and good!

Oh yum.  I used brown instead of white sugar, but otherwise kept it the same.  Thank you for sharing this!

My husband LOVES these cookies. I made two changes, per the reviews, I used brown sugar and unsalted butter. I only cooked the cookies for 6 minutes (exactly) as anything over burnt them. I also refridgerated them overnight, but they came out perfectly. My husband is already asking when I will make these again.

Great recipe.  The cookies turned out flavorful and moist.  My daughter requested molasses cookies and I chose this recipe to try.  Used unsalted butter and 1/2 the salt as others suggested.  Also used Organic Blackstrap Molasses for stronger flavor.  Everyone loved them.  This is definately a keeper!  I'll make them again.

These cookies are delicious! I used 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening and 1/4 cup of butter. I took others advice and used brown sugar instead of white. They were perfect! I would certainly make these again and again!

Too greasy.  I made the recipe as is.  It obviously needs modification - like using real butter and a little less of it and brown sugar in place of white.  It also didn't crinkle very well.  I've been using the Molasses Sugar Cookies II from this site for a few years and thought I'd try a new recipe.  Looks like I'll be going back to the old recipe.

I don't know what I did wrong but these cookies turned out aweful. The smell was fantastic but that was about it. The dough was runny and the cookies were flat and crunchy. I followed the directions to a T and they were aweful. Don't suggest these to anyone.

Well, what can I say about these cookies except that I love them.  They stir together so quickly, are delicious and smell incredible as they are baking.  I have to agree with the other reviewer who said the batter is great.  In fact, my helper tasted the batter and asked where I was taking these cookies.  When I told him church, he took the bowl of batter and told me to make something else for church because he was taking these.  You really must try this recipe. I only got three dozen out of this recipe.

The first time I made these they came out very flat.  I made another batch and increased the amount of flour.  They turned out perfect.  I've already been asked for the recipe by a friend who tasted them.

This cookie does have excellent taste, however, I did not understand the directions for the butter. I was unsure if it meant to melt the butter before or after measuring out 3/4 cup. In any case, it means before you melt the butter. My cookies came out flatter than pancakes. I should have added more flour to "puff" them up a little. I will make these again, but use less butter.

This is an awesome recipe. My husband can't stop talking about them. I used one cube butter and added the rest of the measurement with margarine. I followed the advice of 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I cooked mine for 9 1/2 minutes. The cookies that were on the top shelf seemed to crack better. Next time I will put them all on the top shelf.

Melt in your mouth. I sprinkled extra white sugar on top of the cookies just after transferring to cooling rack, while still warm...mmmmm... Other than that, I did not change the recipe at all.

These are maybe the best cookies I have ever made... I am a huge molasses fan, i kinda just tossed the spices in and amped them up a bit, also i used pumpkin pie spice because i didnt have cloves or ginger. Also I used half brown sugar half white to ensure they were soft. delicious and beautiful.

This is THE BEST molasses cookie recipe ever! I have tried several other recipes, but nothing comes close to this one. 
I have made these a few times now and they have come out perfect every time. The only thing I changed was the amount of molasses. My husband loves molasses, so I doubled the amount of molasses and added some more flour. They were perfect! I also frosted them instead of rolling them in sugar. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is easy and tastes excellent. The only thing I did different was not chill the dough, add about 1/2 more of flour and I added allspice instead of ginger.

I used 1/2 - 2/3 brown sugar in dough (no white sugar) and didn't roll in sugar after forming balls and probably added a little extra molasses and they were Great!!

SOOOOO GOOD!! Instead of putting them in for 8-10 mins, I put them in for 7 mins. That way after they cooled they were still a bit chewy. They are everyone's favourite!!!

They have a deceptively chocolaty look, but a strong molasses taste.  We followed this recipe exactly, but doubled it, and it turned out well.  Molasses isn't my favorite flavor, but the texture was good, and rolling each cookie in granulated sugar was pretty.  We fit lots of cookies on one cookie sheet, because they really didn't spread at all.  I used parchment paper to line the cookie sheets, which I recommend over foil.  Be careful not to overbake, because they can get too dry pretty easily, and after storing leftovers for a few days, even with bread ends in sealed tupperware, they did get a bit dry.

I used less sugar, may be not the best decision.  I made them smaller and they didn't crinkle as in some of the other pictures.  But they taste good and like molasses.

Followed recipe exactly, except I accidentally read 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup of molasses.   So it had extra molasses in my batch, but these still turned out perfectly!  I got 27 cookies and baked them for 8 minutes.  They taste professional!

No changes needed unless you want to play with different spices.  This is an excellent cookie. Just don't overbake. I added a TBS of karo syrup to keep the cookies from becoming too hard.

These came out chewy and perfect. I added a little more butter than suggested, also increased the molasses and ginger. Eight minutes was enough. I wouldn't want to go longer.

Look, molasses cookies will never be a treat I enjoy.  But when my husband ate one of these, then looked at me with plaintive eyes and said, "If you make more cookies, you could make more of these..." I knew they'd become a staple in my household.  And this is the recipe I'll use.

I followed what others did, used butter and rolled in brown sugar. Everyone who had them raved about them. With the slice of bread in the airtight container, they were still soft three days later!

I’ve made these at least 8 or 9 times. They’re easy to make and are exceptionally good. The only changes I ever made to them was some extra cinnamon and I added some raisins when I had them.

Great recipe!  I took someone else's suggestion and substituted brown sugar for white and butter for the margarine.  They turned out perfect!  Nice and soft.  Great spice flavor!  I did add a little icing (just powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk).  Don't mind the messiness of the icing in the picture ..my kiddos helped.  :)

Delicious cookie! I too substituted butter and brown sugar in the recipe. I also used 1 tsp of cloves because I love the taste of it in this type of cookie. I always put in a slice of bread when storing cookies. These cookies were a big hit at my daughter's office over the holidays. I'll make this cookie again and again!

These cookies are suptabular. The baking soda is a lil overpowering so would recommend cutting that down to maybe 1 tsp, then they'd be perfection!

Used butter instead of margarine. Coated with lots of sugar and baked till cracked. Excellent recipe. I wouldn't mess with it too much. A real crowd favorite!

Way too much baking soda, wish I had read the reviews before making them. Will try again and cut the baking soda in half.

This is a great recipe...I use a canola olive oil blend for the margarine, half whole wheat flour, and brown sugar instead of white. They taste healthier and more hearty like the original molasses cookies would have tasted.

Made it as is...perfect! I'll  not tweak this one. Be carefull not to make them too big, I did and had to add 5 minutes to get the centers done which was almost too long for the outsides. 
Couldn't be better if was wrapped in bacon!....hey, wait a minute......

I love this cookie!  Not only was it easy to make, the result was delicious!  The taste is reminicent of the cookie your Grandmother would make.  With the crackling and sugar  dusting, it was also pretty to look at!

These are the best molasses cookies. My son asks for them all the time! Friends and family ask for them every year around the holidays! The only small change I have made is  substituting butter for the margarine. Make these you will love them!!!

I was looking for a simple cookie to bake while on Christmas vacation.  This was the first time making molasses anything for my family and it was a hit!  For a special treat, turn them into ice cream cookie sandwiches paired with vanilla or Ben and Jerry's Oat of this Swirled!   Will definitely make them again.

All I did differently was 1/2 the baking soda and cream the butter/sugar (instead of using melted).  They were very flat but looked great and stayed chewy the next day.  Can't stay how long before they finally dried out because I gave some away and the rest got eaten!

 Finally found a molasses cookie recipe I love! No more searching needed!
So soft and full of flavor! Only used 1 tsp of Baking soda and cooked for 8 minutes.

I think this recipe could use more flour. Might just be a difference in altitude or something, but with only 2 cups of flour, my batter was too runny to do anything with.  I needed to add about 1 cup of extra flour to make a proper cookie dough. 
I also accidentally put in double the ginger and chose to use brown sugar instead of white to really increase the molasses flavor.  With those changes, these cookies were amazing! I'll probably always make them that way.

I sub 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown. I added about another 3/4 flour bc it was so sticky. I like to Refrigerate it in parchment paper in a roll shape. Even with adding all of this flour, the cookies are perfection in taste and consistency. Sooo chewy and we make them golf ball size.   baked 11 minutes on a silicone sheet.

Made as written, wouldn't change a thing!  These are the perfect treat on a gloomy day!  The toughest thing about the recipe is not eating all the cookies at once!  Will make these again and again and again!!

Amazing recipe. I’ve eyeballed the measurements several times and it always turns outs great. Soft, moist, and delicious. It’s a hard recipe to mess up. I typically like to use a little less than a 1/4 cup of molasses, but that’s just me.

These did not last even 24 hours in my house! I substituted the margarine for shortening and added 3/4tsp nutmeg, 1/4tsp each of the cinnamon, ginger and cloves (I like a spicier cookie). Will definitely make these again!

Will be definitely making these again! Made a few adjustments. 1/2 cup white sugar then 1/2 brown sugar. 1/2 cup melted butter instead of margarine, a bit more cinnamon + ginger, and I added 1 tsp cardamom. Didn't roll them in the sugar, either. But they are profoundly delicious and stay moist in a container. Very chewy and decadent!

I made this recipe for the first time it was very simple and easy to make. The only thing I changed was used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 Cup of sugar. Also I did not roll them in Sugar after to make them slightly healthier. Nice and chewy soft delicious will make again!

I have made this recipe countless times. I bring them to every party I go to and people always ask me for the recipe. I am vegan so I replaced the egg with a powder egg substitute and the margarine with half vegan butter half crisco. I usually bake them for 12-14 minutes.

I used salted butter instead of margarine, so maybe that's the problem, but these cookies came out very crispy (Not hard, just crunchy) for me. They were good and the flavor was fantastic, but not anywhere near soft or chewy. Good thing I actually prefer crunchy cookies

Excellent. I followed the recipe exactly, but used fresh 1 table spoon of fresh grated ginger instead of ground. Brown sugar instead or white. Cooked for 7 mins and it was perfect. Made about 30 small cookies.

Im not an amazing baker, that being said, these were relatively easy to make and they turned out fantastic.

The folks who rated this recipe 3 or less stars are out to lunch.

Thank you, these will be a new Christmas tradition for me.

I thought these were fantastic and easy to make! I doubled the cinnamon, clove, and ginger & it turned out great. I knew this was going to be a good recipe before even baking because the batter smelled so delicious.  5/5 I will definitely make these again.

So good! After reading comments I've made some changes as recommend. I used brown sugar instead of white, used 1tsp baking soda and doubled the spices. So soft and flavorful.

I read each and every review before I began making these cookies. So I was prepared for the problems,then created one of my own which turned out to be a blessing. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, but doubled the spices and added a little cracked black pepper for a zing. I accidentally dumped some flour into my sugar canister and tried scooping out as much as I could see into my dry ingredients bowl and promptly forgot I had done that before adding the two cups of flour. So, I think I ended up with about 2 1/2 cups of flour.  The end result is they were not wet and formed into balls very easily. I pressed them down a bit and baked them on my silpat mat (perfect for all cookies) and let them bake for the full 10 minutes. They crackled nicely, were not flat but rose beautifully (2 tsp Baking soda) and came out cracking crisp on the outside and soft and chewy inside. Absolutely perfect molasses cookies.

I LOVE this recipe (and so do the people I've made it for)!! This cookie comes out perfectly chewy. The spice is just right! This recipe has become a staple for the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated. They taste great, but as soon as I took them out of the oven, they became completely flat and not very pretty. Was hoping to take these to work, but I'm too embarrassed with how they look.

Excellent  recipe! Very easy. I made only one change. I used butter instead of margarine. The whole family loved them. Make sure you dont over bake them. When they crack they are done even though they don't seem like they are.

Loved this recipe - so easy (you don't even need a mixer) and so good.

I took some of the other reviewers' advice and used butter in lieu of margarine. I also flattened the rolled dough with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar before baking. That helped keep the centers from coming out less cooked than the perimeters.

Another reason I love this recipe: It's just my husband and I and I hate to make full batches of anything, knowing that we'll (1) eat too much of something, (2) throw away a bunch of something, or (3) both. I just made one batch of these at a time (five cookies/batch in my little Breville) and left the rest of the dough in a covered Pyrex bowl in the fridge. So yes, although we did end up consuming the entire batch, we at least spread it out over a week!

Everyone loved these cookies! Watch your timing carefully with these, they harden quickly and I would say they're probably best done in a convection oven as the sugar had a bit of a burned taste on the bottom with a regular oven. Will be making these again and again!

I have made these several times and stuck to the recipe. This time, I put all the spices in my mortar and ground them up even more. Pretty excited to see if this gives the spice a kick, but they were already about as close to perfect as one can get. PS: LOVE the tips on storage...who gets them to stick around that long??

I absolutely love these, if anything I think they get better the second day. They have a nice buttery chewiness to them. I don't think I have ever met someone who did not like them.

This recipe was really delicious. I cut the butter to around 1/2  and the sugar to 3/4 of a cup, and I think it was still pretty sweet so I could have cut both a little bit more.

I made these to bring to a BBQ and everybody loved them!! The only thing I did differently from the recipe was I only had it in the fridge for 45 minutes. Baking them for 8 minutes was the perfect amount of time.

My biggest problem is that they turned out flat and hard. Thankfully I always try just one at first to make sure they turn out right. After looking at other reviews I think the recipe should be altered to include more flour which would help with the flat hard problem.

These are hubby's favorites and don't stay around long. The spicy smell wafting through the house as they bake always brings him to the kitchen where he hangs around waiting til they're out of the oven! I do make just a couple of changes to suit our tastes. I use butter instead of margarine, add 1 tsp vanilla to the sugar/egg mixture, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I also use brown sugar instead of white and increase the molasses to 1/3 cup to give it a greater depth of flavor. I roll the balls in sugar that's been spiced up a bit with cinnamon and a little ground cloves. Mmmm... irresistible!

I was looking for a recipe without shortening, and here it is! I used whole wheat flour (turned out so nice and chewy!), and butter instead of margarine, and doubled the spices. Fantastic. I've now made them 4 times in the last 3 months, and my seven-year-old daughter requested these for her birthday instead of cake.

I don't bake much. I followed the recipe exactly.  These cookies were easy to make and delicious! Though on the second batch I baked an additional two minutes so my cookies would crunch a bit. Next time I might double the ginger. I'll be making these again soon.

First, let me clarify that the main reason I am writing this review is to ask for advice!

I have attempted this recipe around 8 times. They have only come out right 3 times. When they come out right, these are the best cookies. So flavorful and chewy. This is why I gave the recipe a 5-star rating. 

I always follow the recipe exactly the way it's written, which is why I don't understand why it's so different sometimes. The most recent time I made this recipe, the flavor was right, but the consistency was more like a muffin or a bread. I think my problem lies in the butter/egg step. Can anybody shed some light?

Just made them!  Delectable!!  Very "clovey".  My only change was to use butter instead of margarine.  They are definitely in my cookie rotation and I WON'T be waiting until Christmas to make them again.  YUM!

Wow... These are amazing! I was a little concerned when I had the dough all mixed up because it was more like a thick batter... Not solid enough to roll up. After chilling, however, it was the perfect consistency for scraping up with a spoon and rolling up. I did use butter instead of margarine. I don't think my husband liked molasses cookies much before, but he ate about 7 of these, AND he said they're better than his great-grandma used to make! I call that a win ;)

Along with most of the other one star reviews, the cookies did not turn out well. They taste fine, but were very flat and hard. The consistency of the dough also didn't allow to roll into balls or roll in the sugar. If the recipe needs amendments, please post in original post.

I made the recipe with just minor changes as noted in other reviews - only one tsp baking soda and used brown sugar in mix, instead of white.  The cookies were easy, look good and taste good, not great.  I feel they weren't molasses-y enough for us.  Almost taste like a spiced sugar cookie with a hint of molasses.  They will certainly be eaten, but would probably look for a different recipe in the future.

Amazing cookies!! Soft and chewy on the inside, a nice crunch on the outside. Definitely watch your timing in the oven, you don't want to overbake!!

I made these for a cookie throw-down at work and won first place!  These are delicious.  I made a few changes as follows -- I used butter in place a margarine and replaced ginger (because I did not have some at the time) with Nutmeg.  I followed the rest as noted.  After chilling for the hour I used a cookie scoop for portion size and balled them in my hands and then rolled them in the extra sugar listed in the ingredients and placed them on the sheet in ball form.  They baked until the cracks formed.  Perfection - they looked store bought.  Everyone loved them at work and I won frist place!  I will make again and this is part of my recipe list now.

For a nice twist on this recipe, add a teaspoon of peppermint extract in addition to the other ingredients, and I roll them in green or red sugar.  Best molasses cookies!  I use butter instead of margarine, though.  They get rave reviews whenever I make them.  They're a holiday tradition every year, I double the recipe to make sure I have enough for everyone!  They stay fresh and yummy for a long time when sealed in a container.

I made this and enjoy the moistness of this bread. I substituted walnuts for pecans because that's what I had on hand. Also split sugar with Splenda. I used one regular loaf pan and had enough for mini loaf.

I took these to a large group of teenagers to taste test, and they thought that they were ok, I thought that they were OK, and my family thought they were Ok.  I made them the way the recipe said to, with no changes, and they looked fine.  I probably won't make these again, just because I would rather find something better.

I just made these, decided to use for cookie exchange.  Nice hint of spices, not too strong, just nice.  I, too, used one teaspoon of baking soda, butter and brown sugar.  Needed the eight minute bake.  I also  put a pecan half on some of the cookies, before baking; nice addition, and look nice.  Thank you for a nice, easy, delicious cookie recipe.

I had never tried molasses cookies before, but I made these for a work party because of all the positive reviews I saw for it. My coworkers kept exclaiming how good they were and asking who made them. I've made them twice, and once I added 1 cup water to the dough, which meant I got much flatter cookies, which I actually preferred.

My first batch just came out, and WOW are they delicious.  I always read comments so I adjusted the baking soda down to only 1 teaspoon and substituted the white sugar in the recipe for Truvia Baking Blend Brown Sugar.  Because of using brown sugar I lowered the temperature to 350 degrees.  I also used solid coconut oil instead of butter or margarine.  (Couldn't taste the coconut at all.)  I'm going to make another batch to take to my daughter this weekend.  YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM  (It's a five yum recipe!)

This is a definite winner. I gave some away at work and people were asking to buy them by the dozen!!  I only had a milder molasses on hand so I added almost 1/3 cup instead of 1/4. You can easily skip the long refrigeration time by patting the dough out on a dinner plate and tossing it into the freezer for a few minutes, but no matter what, make sure your dough is cold when it makes it to the oven! If you aren't a big fan of cloves, substitute half of the clove for allspice, they are similar but it makes a big difference.  I threw together a vanilla icing to drizzle on top with powdered sugar,  silk vanilla creamer and vanilla extract and I couldn't be happier with the final product. A snappy, crisp exterior and a soft, chewy interior with all the autumnal flavor your heart desires!

Texture is wonderful, it looks and smells beautiful, but it's too sweet. I'd not roll it in sugar next time, and probably use much less sugar, but not sure how that would affect the texture, which is perfect.

Doubled the recipe and got about 70 cookies. I did have some issues with the dough: even after 90 minutes of chilling it was still far too sticky. Ended up mixing in about half a cup more flour and chilling overnight, and then I was able to roll the dough. Cooked each dozen for 13 minutes and they turned out good. Final product was spicy, fragrant, and not too sweet, but a little grainy in texture. Might try to make again, knowing what I do now about the consistency of the dough. Alterations to the doubled recipe: no cinnamon (due to allergies), softened margarine (instead of melted), half the baking soda, 1.5 tsp cloves (instead of 1 tsp), 1.5 tsp ginger (instead of 1 tsp), added 1.5 tsp nutmeg, added a splash of vanilla extract, added ½ cup more flour, chilled overnight, baked 13 minutes.

Made these for the first time as several people I know have never tried Molasses cookies. Based off of reviews I changed the  following: 
1) Used butter instead of margarine
2)Used brown sugar instead of white sugar
3)Doubled spices
4) Used only 1 teaspoon baking soda
5) Baked for 6 minutes

The flavor was really good but the cookies a bit soft. It's challenging to tell when they are done. Next time I'd add more baking time. Likely 1-1 1/2 minutes more.  I'll update my review when I make them again :)

This is perhaps the best cookie recipe I have ever had and it even converted my die hard chocolate chip cookie loving wife over to molasses cookies. These spectacular cookies that would blow the mind of even the cookie monster are possible with a few modifications to the recipe. First, I used 1/3 of a cup of butter and 1/2 cup of crisco to get the perfect balance of flavor from the butter and texture from the crisco. I put the butter and crisco in the microwave until it was slightly melted but not completely. I also halved the amount of baking soda, doubled the amount of all the spices, and substituted brown sugar for white to improve the flavor. I didn't bother chilling the cookies as the crisco prevented them from spreading too much. Enjoy the perfection! The most important part is the butter/crisco ratio and it can be tailored to the baker's preference.

These cookies turned out soft and chewy, delicious. I did substitute butter for margarine. As advised by other reviewers I doubled the spices and went down on the baking soda.  Also chilled the cookie dough overnight and baked for 7 minutes. The first time making these cookies came out great, will make them again.

My husband found this recipe and made these cookies. I must say they were much better than the ones I make. Very addictive. They even have a nice mild buttery flavor mine don't have.

Very good cookies.  I substituted wheat flour for spelt flour (due to a wheat allergy) using 2 1/4 cups spelt flour.  Also used vegan butter, softened but not melted.  I doubled the spices, added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice, and used only 1 teaspoon baking soda.  I baked the first batch for 7 mins and they burnt slightly on the bottom so turned the over down to 350 degree for subsequent batches, and they turned out beautifully.

I love this recipe and have made it probably 30 times. In that time, I have made a few observations:

1) These cookies are out of this world with a lemon butter cream frosting. Sometimes when I go out to a bakery I see that they make ginger molasses sandwiches and they go for $4 each!

2) Make your cookies small(ish). Every time I make my cookies walnut sized, the tops never crack. I have found the size of a large marble to be perfect

3) The cheap baking sheet works better. I do this recipe with a nice baking sheet and a cheap one. Somehow, the cheap one ends up with a more evenly baked cookie with a better crackle top.

4) Let the cookies cool on the sheet for 5 minutes before removing. Whenever I do an early removal or a wire rack removal, the cookies lose all of their rise/height. Also, if you leave them on the baking sheet too long, they will begin to stick. Anywhere between 5-10 minutes is perfect

5) Get festive with your rolling sugar! I have had great results using regular white sugar, turbinado sugar, half-and-half white brown, colored sugar. It just gives it an extra sparkle.

6) The recipe hasn't been very forgiving to me when I leave it in the fridge longer than 2 hours to chill/rest. Sometimes I make the batter the day before just to make things easier for myself but they never quite come out the way I want them too. Also might be because I was using my thick/expensive baking sheets

I've made these 4 times now, and have been told by more than one person that these are the BEST cookies they ever tasted. I slightly burned the bottoms of the first 2 batches. A couple of tips are keep them walnut size and bake them for longer than 7 minutes....they will continue to cook on the pan after removing from oven. Not sure if it makes a difference, but I use butter instead of margarine.
Everything else I followed exactly as written....

I like ginger snaps, but my hubby likes chewy cookies.  So I tried this recipe.  It made great tasting  soft and chewy cookies.  My only future change would be to halve the salt.  I didn't taste it in the cooked cookie - but the dough seemed a little salty to me (but I don't like to add salt, so I may be overly salt sensitive.)  Would definitley make again though.

I substituted butter (for the margarine) as well as wheat flour (instead of all-purpose flour) and it turned out equally as yummy! This recipe makes approximately 2 dozen delicious cookies! Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have any powdered ginger and substituted grated fresh ginger root, which turned out fantastic. I also don't use margarine in the house, so I substituted butter. They smelled fantastic from the first couple steps, so I'm surprised I managed to stop eating the dough long enough to actually bake them...

They turned out to have a nice crunchy outside and a chewy inside, and I'll admit, I had one for breakfast today.

They've got a nice spice to them and I'll be coming back to this recipe for sure.

These are fantastic! Not difficult at all and they came out perfectly on the first try. A little crunchy, a little chewy, a little zing from the ginger and the right amount of sweet. I reduced the cloves slightly as I'm not a huge fan. Everybody was wowed when the sugar listened under the holiday lights. My new favorite!

These turned out delicious!  I did make some changes suggested by previous reviewers.  I used softened butter instead of margarine (did not melt), used only 1/3 cup granulated sugar and added 2/3 cup brown sugar, doubled the spices, increased molasses to almost 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, and used 1 tsp baking soda, and added a tiny amount (about 1/8 tsp) of mace which is like nutmeg with a hint of pepper to give the cookie a little "kick", which I used from another molasses spice cookie recipe.  I prefer to cook at 350 degrees approximate 11 minutes as my new oven cooks too fast and they will burn at a higher temp.  Everyone loved them and could not stop eating them.

Wow- exceptional! Like other reviews used dark brown sugar , 1 tsp baking soda, doubled spices and dipped in powder sugar after baking. Superb. I always use shortening in lieu of butter and always makes a great chewy cookie.

In my oven, these bake in almost exactly ten minutes. They must be watched closely because baking time is crucial. The tray I put on the bottom rack didn't bake well, so I recommend baking only one tray at a time. They spread quite a bit, so give them plenty of room. The flavor, the texture: a 10!

Excellent cookies! I use 5/8 cup of butter, a 50:50 ratio of brown and white sugar, and add roughly 1/4 tsp vanilla. They're a hit every time!!

I read the reviews and tried a few different versions. Less baking soda, shorter amount of time, accounting for altitude (I'm in Denver), butter instead of margarine... They all turned out flat cookies that were less than impressive.

excellent molasses cookie! I followed other reviewers and used primarily brown sugar (about 2/3 cup  brown/1/3 cup white) for the sugar in the dough and halved the baking soda (1 tsp). I also used butter at room temperature and avoided the  one hour of refrigeration.  I also made the dough balls smaller than stated.. (about 1" diameter). I used green and red sugar (they were for Christmas) and just stuck the top of the ball in the colored sugar to decorate them.  About 5 min into the baking process, I tapped each cookie to flatten it. I got about 4 doz cookies. 
They were really good!

I made this twice and the second time i made it i made a double batch and they spread thin and really bad. 
I read some of the other review and the first time i made this i used margarine and the second time i  used butter. and i used the amount of  butter solid then melted it which made more than what it is called for.

Making for a second time today. The only thing I changed was I used butter instead of margarine. I feel comfortable changing it it up a bit and switching out the butter for smart balance spread. I also might try using 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white to bring out more molasses flavor.

LOVED THEM!!!! I used butter because I like the flavor better, they were the most delicious molasses cookies Ive ever tasted. However, they were very thin and smushed when I took them off the sheet. Not very pretty, but delicious. Next time, Im going to add an extra egg, use half baking soda and half baking powder to make them a bit fluffier. Ill post how it turns out.

When I tasted the dough (yes, I ate raw cookie dough and I know the supposed dangers of raw eggs) it tasted bland to me, so I upped the amounts of the spices. I also used real butter. They're amazing!

I am gluten free so I subbed the flour for bobs red mill gluten free "1 to 1" flour, also I added a dash of nutmeg, a wee bit extra molasses and did a half teaspoon less baking soda. I baked them in a toaster oven so they only baked about 6-7 minutes for a deliciously chewy cookie! Will definitely be making more very soon ????

A very easy cookie to make.  I substituted margarine for butter, and used dark brown sugar in place of the white.  I cubed the butter and left it at room temperature, then creamed it with the sugar using a hand mixer.  I also doubled the spices as others have, and put the batter back in the fridge for 45 minutes to firm it up before scooping onto a cookie sheet.  I used an ice cream scoop to make consistent sized cookies, and they turned out perfect just after 8 minutes.  The secret to making these perfect every time is to keep an eye on them for the final couple of minutes.

These are the best! They are nice and chewy and my kids' favorite cookies--yes, they like them better than sugar cookies or chocolate chip cookies.  These are a cookie jar staple at our house in the fall and winter. Make'em!

I used Pekmez (Turkish grape molasses) instead of regular and used real butter but everything else was the same. They were super simple and very delicious. I will definitely be making these again.

Made these with the same ingredients and amounts called for- except butter instead of margarine which is really just a preference and I'm sure they would have been great with margarine. SO delicious and buttery- which is not how I'd normally describe a molasses cookie. Perfectly chewy and baked consistently round and even. I'm very confident that a novice could make outstanding cookies with this recipe.

turned out perfect, I took some of the previous suggestions in the reviews, I used 1/2 butter 1/2 margarine, used mainly molasses in my biscuits, as that is all I had, and used only 1 tsp of baking soda. My first batch were crispy, the rest I didn't bake quite as long (1-2mins) and they turned out nice and chewy, I prefered the chewy ones, my partner the crispy ones.  Will be making these now for friend and family visits:-)

These made me very popular with my boyfriend's family! Half of the batch got eaten on the drive there for supper and the none at all made it home. They have awesome flavour but probably didn't need so much baking soda (now I see others say the same thing)!

Absolutely wonderful.  It is rare that my husband comments on food I make but, on these cookies, he said "These taste like bakery cookies.  In fact, these are better than bakery cookies.  There is spice and sweetness and I love them.  Make them again soon!" That's all the incentive I need!

I also made these with butter and only added 1 tsp of baking soda and one tsp of vanilla extract and I too doubled the spices. Oh my amazing! This is a yummy keeper recipe! All my boys gobbled them up in no time. These would make great gift giving cookies too. Thank you!

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It has very little molasses taste, and should be called a spice cookie, not molasses.  I was hoping to give some to my friends, but alas, it was not very good.

Made these quite a few times now, with no changes to the recipe. They are delicious; a nice flavourful change when you're craving something a bit different :) Make sure to store these in a tight container with a piece of bread to keep them moist and soft for days.

Just whipped up a double batch of this recipe and it is fabulous! I made a few additions to the recipe to try to replicate "Hermits" my husbands favorite cookie - added raisins and walnuts to the batter, cooked them a bit less so they would be chewy (he likes them soft) and then finished it off with a drizzle of a paste made with cinnamon, vanilla,confectionary sugar with a bit of water, stirred it up and drizzled it over each cookie. He is smiling while I write. 
Thank you. I am saving this recipe.

These cookies are so good!! They were easy to make. I substituted butter instead of using margarine. 
Next time I will slightly flatten them with a flat glass bottom. They don't spread much.

Good cookie, but very bland...does not taste like molasses. Maybe try adding double molasses. I'd try another recipe.

These are the best ever! I am making them right now for the second time. I do use butter though instead of margarine. Don't be tempted to flatten them a little, I did on a few the first time and I have learned my lesson. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly (maybe a touch more flour) and they are just absolutely fantastic! Be sure to chill the dough for at least an hour. I also creamed the butter, sugar, and egg with an electric hand mixer. Yum! Family approved.

Loved this recipe!  My husband goes bonkers over these cookies.  Only needed to add 1/2 cup of extra flour, cause they were too soft, even after chilled.  Oh, and I live in Chile where they don´t sell Molasses, so I subbed it for syrup.

Evidently I did something wrong, because they wouldn't roll together and were extremely crumbly.  I even made a second batch thinking maybe I missed something, that wasn't any better.  I followed the directions step for step.  If anyone has any ideas what went wrong I would love to hear it.

I've never tasted a molasses cookie but thought it'd be a nice Christmas cookie to try out and take for family Christmas. Oh my. These are fantastic. I made the brown sugar version. And instead of adding the spices separately, I just used 3 (or four) teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. So glad I decided to give these a try. I will be making these for Christmases to come!

Loved the taste but these cookies were flat and not very pretty.  I'm going to look for a similar recipe that is more cake-like. Also, to dress these up for Christmas, I'm going to dip them in white chocolate so they're half brown, half white.

These were fabulous!! However, I did decrease the amount of baking soda based on reviews. The only other modification when I make them in the future (and I will) would be to increase the spices. YUMMY!

I learned something valuable today.  I keep looking for different molasses/gingersnap cookie recipes and I need to stop doing that.  I made this with the revisions that several people recommended.  I wish I had added the 2nd t. of soda. Also, this cookie does not have enough flour.  Most recipes like this have 2 1/4 cups of flour.  Mine were flat.  They were unappealing.  The last few cookies I decided to add a big T of flour and mixed it in.  The last 7 cookies looked normal; puffy and nice looking.  The flavor was fine but if I made these again I would add 1/4 cup of flour.

I loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to use butter since that was all I had.  The cookies are very soft and chewy with tons of flavour.  I've seen suggestions of doubling the spices, I'm not sure I would try, they have a good flavour as is, I'd be worried it would be too strong.  I will make these again.

This has become a holiday staple in my home. The family loves them! I get requests for them every year when invited to visit friends and relatives. Unbeknownst to them, only about half makes it to the intended destination. The rest, never leaves the house! 

Recipe should be made as advertised.....don't change a thing! Crisp on the outside....soft and chewy on the inside. The perfect cookie.

When rolling the dough into balls, if you make them walnut sized you will only get 1 dozen cookies. If you make them 1 inch balls or less then you might be able to squeeze another dozen out but there's no way I can get 5 dozen out of this recipe without making them bite-size. I also used the suggestions of brown sugar instead of white and halved the baking soda.

Delicious! I made them last night and they're half way gone by today! I doubled each spice, 1 tsp of baking soda, and baked them for only 7 minutes. (They will cool and set perfectly.) I also used half margarine and half butter because that's what I had in the fridge.

I changed to 60 servings. The dough is very soft even after 1 hour in fridge. I used half brown sugar and half white. I also used a large  electric mixer with blade. I think it was overbeaten.

I made these without eggs for my husband and they are REALLY good. I used 1 T. Ener-G Egg Replacer mixed with 1 t. water instead off the egg. You don't need to flatten the cookies; just bake them in ball form and they flatten the perfect amount on their own.

These were good but tasted strongly of baking soda.  I'll use less next time.

Very tasty. For sugar used 1/2C white with 1/2C brown. Also added 1/4tsp nutmeg.  Nice and easy will make again.

Pretty good flavour. I found if I waited for the tops to crack before taking them out of the oven they were not a bit dried out, but if you take them out a it sooner the tops will crack as they are cooling, and thy are still nice and chewy on the inside a crisp around the edges.

These were FANTASTIC.  You can make them vegan too with ONE modification to the recipe.  Substitute the 1 egg with 1 TBSP flaxseeds (ground in a spice grinder) and blended with 4 TBSP water and let the mixture sit for about 5-10 min until it slightly gels.  Add as you would an egg.  (We used Becel's vegan margarine as well).  Our family ate the batch of 24 cookies in less than an hour.  No kidding!!

These cookies are delicious!  I made a few changes only to make them healthier for our family. I used coconut oil instead of margarine and coconut palm sugar instead of white sugar (for the dough) and 1tsp of baking soda (2 seemed like a lot) and 1tsp of salt (to make up for lack of salt in coconut oil).  I then only refrigerated for 30 minutes because coconut oil gets hard when fully cooled. The dough was perfect. The only thing I would do next time is make them smaller. Grape-sized ball rather than walnut.

I loved them! I didn't have margarine, so I used salted butter and omitted the salt. I accidentally used 1/2 cup of sugar in the mix and the half the roll it in and they turned out excellent! I'm sure they are great with the whole cup in the mix too and I'll try that next time! I will be making these again :)

I made two changes: butter instead of margarine and demerara sugar instead of white sugar for dipping the cookies. Mixed up the recipe and flattened out the cookie before baking, so they might've been a little bigger than they were meant to be. Perfect cookies!! They looked and tasted so good. I just ate 3.

I followed the suggestions of others, brown sugar instead of white, doubled the spices, etc. What I did differently was to roll the cookies in Turbano (Sugar in the Raw) sugar before baking. Gave the cookies a bit of crunch and a bit of sweet. Really great recipe.

So easy to make! They turn out perfectly each time and they are always a hit. I use melted salted butter instead of margarine and it makes them a little flatter, like ginger snaps. 
These babies are also great as ice cream sandwiches! Don't make them TOO big otherwise they're just way too sweet. I make my boyfriend his own batch because he loves them so much!

The good news: these were absolutely delicious and chewy.  The bad news: the first batch came out of the oven looking like brown, crinkly crepes.  I added about 1/3 cup of flour for the second batch and they looked better.  Next time I'll add 1/2 cup flour for the whole batch, and will soften instead of melt the butter.

I've been making these for the last couple of years, and  they are always the first cookies at the table to go!!  I've even had requests for these in the middle of summer!  
The only change I made is to triple the cinnamon and cloves because as Indians we love our spices!! Other than that, they are a perfect cookie!!
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, its made me very popular!!

I left out the ginger and will try this again. It was a spicy sugar cookie at best. Texture was nice but I wanted a more cracked top.

AWESOME, WHOLESOME, OLD-FASHIONED GOODNESS!  Yummm!!!
I looked at several Molasses cookie recipes and decided on this one mainly because it had more butter than the others I found.  The recipe was an absolute joy to make and the cookies turned out perfect!!  Molasses cookies are an old-fashioned favorite of my husbands, however,...he said that he had never had them homemade.  The first cookie he tried he just couldn't stop ranting how delicious, chewy and spicy they were.  The perfect sweetness with the spices.  I will keep this recipe forever and pass it to everyone I can.  Thank You So Very Much for this recipe.  My cookie jar is brimming with these cookies today. :)

This is an excellent cookie, though I did cut down on the ginger to 1/8 tsp. I used the coarse bakers sugar to top them with.  I loved the crackled look when they came out of the oven.  Two best things: They tasted fantastic!  And the dough kept beautifully in the fridge for several days when covered tightly.  I will make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and these cookies came out great! I noticed the more chilled the dough was, the stiffer it was. I think next time I will double up on the spices, because I prefer a more robust taste, but these are great. First batch has already been gobbled up by the kids. :)

Very good!! My father (who is 60 yrs old), said they are the best he's had! I used brown sugar for the dough, but otherwise made as written. BE CAREFUL with the cooking time. Mine were done at 7 minutes. If you overcook them, they will harden.

Received a recipe from an acquaintance  but was unsure of batter consistency  so I researched here.. Found the same recipe so I knew I was in good hands. Only change from this recipe was that I used brown sugar, 1 c. whole wheat flour, 1 c. white flour and based on her recipe, Smart Balance shortening and baked 7 mins. I let it chill overnight. Only negative about the experience is that it is a gooey batter, work fast and don't let batter warm up.

Yummy!! The dough is very soft and if it does not chill, I find that it is a batter. But it is so tasty, chewy and perfect for the fall and winter months! Be sure not to overtake them, and give them extra room because they will spread. When making these, don't be tempted to add more flour, or else they won't be as chewy and flat.

Holy cow!!!! These are THE PERFECT molasses cookie. Taste, texture, everything about them is perfect!! I even substituted butter and crisco mixture for margarine, and allspice and nutmeg instead of ginger, and they were still great. Easy and foolproof!

I made these cookies last night and absolutely loved them! I used butter instead of margarine because I couldn't find any in the house but they still turned out great! I was a little disappointed that they had to chill for an hour and ended up only leaving them in the fridge for about 45 minutes but it didn't seem to make a difference. These cookies are addictive! I'm definitely making another batch soon and bringing them to work(:

Yum! I used brown sugar, butter and whole wheat flour, plus twice the spices and half the baking powder. They turned out a little flat, but yummy, so next time I'll probably use the amount of baking powder in the original recipe, perhaps because the whole wheat flour is a bit more dense or something. Definitely only needed to bake for 7 mins.

Butter is better, I don't use margarine at all. 
In spite of that minor change, the cookies were a bit bland. Not bad for a cookie per se, but as a molasses cookie it was a bit weak. Since I was actually looking for a molasses taste, this recipe would require serious doctoring to create the flavor I was after. Won't use again.

when storing these cookies- put a slice of bread in the container-it keeps them soft and chewable.

Flavor was good, but these are not moist, not thick at all. They are thin and crispy, rather greasy, nothing like the picture. Brown sugar should be used, shortening instead of butter, cooking time adjusted to no more than 8 min. Making these changes will give you a soft, crackle top cookie.

I just made these cookies last week.  Still have 3 left!  They are just the best molasses cookie I have ever had.  I did change a couple of things - used 1/2c. butter and 1/4c marg.; half white and half brown sugar (as suggested) and cut the baking soda down to 1 tsp. and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and only baked for 7 minutes.  The cookies turned out soft and chewy. Try it - you will love it!

Liked this recipe very much although it did not make the same amount of cookies as what was written (even using the size comparison)  Tasty though - but still am looking for the molasses cookie recipe my grandmother used to use - taste has much more molasses and ended up being a softer cookie.... the search continues...

Made these for Christmas with a few other cookies and we all loved them. I made the dough before I went to bed and rolled/baked them in the morning. I have tried other recipes for Molasses cookies and they were a pain in the molass...these couldn't be easier or tastier. Store them with a slice of bread for the perfect amount of chewiness. Thanks so much for sharing. I am getting ready to mix another batch!

This was a great molasses cookie! The only substitute I used was butter because I don't like to cook with margarine, but made the rest of the recipe as listed and they turned out great- nice and soft once I figured out the timing.  It is very easy to overcook these though (and that is what makes them crispy/crunchy) so I suggest making only a couple of cookies for the first batch to get the timing down for your individual oven.  My first batch I used a regular cookie sheet and baked for 7 min in a gas oven and they were very overdone.  I switched to an Air Bake cookie sheet and then had to bake for 8 min, but then they were soft and perfect!  Even my picky eaters loved these and my son has already told me I "HAVE" to make these again for Christmas next year :)

I thought these cookies turned out great! I doubled the batch and cooked for 9 minuets. The trick for me was refrigerating the dough. You can't be lazy and skip this step. It really helps everything come out chewy and delicious. If you're doing a lot of baking make the dough for these cookies first then refrigerate while your making another kind of cookie. Great for the holidays!

Most compliments on my cookies ever!  This recipe is so consistent and every time I make it I get raves and asked for the recipe.  I bake 11 minutes and then leave to cool for several minutes and that seems to be the magic time period for perfect cookies.  Also, I sprinkle extra white sugar on the top of the balls.

I absolutely loved these cookies and my family did too.  I also did not melt the butter (butter instead of margarine)but just softened it and then proceeded with the recipe as written but did not chill the batter.   Worked fine and was quicker.  The cookies were flatter than the picture and tops did not crack but were very pretty, consistent in appearance, and delicious. Great recipe.

Very good. Searching for the amazing version that I used to make with my mother as a child, which didn't have the slightly grainy quality this has. I recommend increasing the spices. But overall, a tasty cookie and fun to make with my daughter.

Every year my mother would make molasses cookies and I have taken on the same tradition.  For this recipe I tweeked it just a little bit, I used unsalted butter and I creamed that together with 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar (the brown sugar gives it that extra molasses taste) and then I added Hershey's cinnamon chips which gave it that extra bunch of cinnamon.  Overall a great cookie!

These went together really quick and easy.  I was happy that after leaving them in the fridge for an hour they were easy to form into balls.  They baked up beautifully and tasted great.  Not too sweet and not too spicy.  I did as many others suggested and omitted a tsp of baking soda.  Great recipe!

This recipe has been haunting me for several days (being close to Halloween is part of it, I am sure). I finally gave in and decided to give it a go. 
First off, I used butter since I adore butter for its health benefits over margarine. I also took the advice of several other cooks and halved the baking soda to 1 tsp. rather than the called for 2tsp.. Everything else was as the recipe called for and these came out AMAZING! 
I am generally not one to sing the praises of a recipe, but this one is worthy of all the praise it is given by other reviewers. 
For those who had a "fail" with this recipe, they had to have missed something, were at a higher elevation or had to be attempting to bake with quite a bit of humidity in the air. I had no problem with "runny dough" or spreading on my pan. They came out uniform and beautiful.

I made these this afternoon, and let me tell you, they're things of a dream! No bakery has made anything quite so delicious as this! The only thing I recomend, is adding a few dashes of nutmeg, as I always do when cinnamon is involved. MMM!

This cookie is amazing! I have made it several times as written and the results were fantastic. Just recently I tried the suggested 1/2 c each of brown and white sugar and I think it was a nice boost. I also sprinkled some allspice in addition to the regular spices called for. My husband requested I make them for his office and they got raves.

I love this recipe. Made it last night out of the blue, and as soon as the first cookie sheet was out of the oven, I had to remake the recipe (Because it was too good to only have so many,) I did however alter the sugar coating a little, I took the 1/2 cup white sugar, added 1/2 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp cinnamon, stirred it up, and tossed the dough in... then i got an idea to make mini's with my mini cupcake pan, which turned out even better!

this recipe is really good. I added a teaspoon of pepper to give it the ginger snap "hot" taste and it came out really deliscious. I used brown sugar instead of white, will make these other times besides the holidays.

This is the same recipe that my family has been using for over 30 years except that ours calls for 1/3 cup of molasses.  The other difference in ours is that we refrigerate the dough for several hours before baking.  I think this may help with the spreading out that some are mentioning.  Also, storing it with a piece of bread in the container keeps them soft.

I am not a cookie baker, but these are easy and delicious!  I used brown sugar and softened butter (unsalted adds no salty taste).  Also cut the baking soda to 1 tsp and used generous measures of the spices.

They're good cookies, yes...
But they have a very unappealing appearance. I've made molasses cookies many times and decided to try this one out for the heck of it.

So, good.. but I wouldn't feed them to anyone other than family.

These are a great chewy cookie. I somehow ran out of clove so I added a bit of nutmeg in its place and they turned out beautifully. I imagine the clove would add a nice spice.

Amazing, one of my family's favorite cookies.  I make these a couple times a year, especially in the fall.  I also only use one tsp of soda and substitute nutmeg for the cloves.  I never seem to have cloves in the house.

These were wonderful!! I made them for thanksgiving, I only baked half the day of then today I made the rest of them, (still AMAZING!), the only thing I changed was the cinnamon, I added an extra tsp of if because I just can't get enough cinnamon :P, anyways! They were really really great, move aside chocolate chip cookies! I'll be making these through out the holiday season for sure - and all year round as well! Wonderful recipe!!

My husband loved these! I used coconut oil instead of margarine to avoid trans fats. I never have margarine in the house. I used fresh ground whole wheat flour and 1 tsp baking soda. Instead of worrying about how to store it I baked just enough for the evening and put the rest in the freezer so that I could make a treat another night.

I love the texture of these cookies, very melt in your mouth.  Awesome warm with a cold glass of milk.  However, when it comes to molasses cookies I expect more spice to it, the Ginger seemed to overpower other flavors.  Next time I'll try using brown sugar as others suggested and increasing the clove and cinnamon a little.  We'll see!  :)

I have a recipe similar to this recipe. I really enjoy making them! The only difference is the addition of allspice and no refrigeration. Also be sure not to over cook this type or any type of cookie... they are better chewy!

Taking the advice from other reviews, I used brown sugar instead of white, doubled the spices and cut the baking soda in half.  These turned out excellent, but next time I will defintely double the recipe as I only got about 2 dozen cookies.  With two teenage boys, they won't last a day!  By the way, this is the same exact recipe on the back of the bottle of my molasses I used.

These cookies are great. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and didn't melt the butter. I also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar instead of all white. They are very moist and delicious. I will make them again.

Excellent, quick and easy recipe. The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white and they were so delicious. A little crunchy around the edges and soft in the middle. Will definitely use this recipe when I need to whip something up quickly.

I tried doubling the recipie and used melted margarine.  I chillen the dough well however the first batch of cookie came out flat and crispy.  I added another cup of flour and it made a huge difference.  Delicious!

These are good.  Next time I will double the spices.  I used butter and refrigerated for a couple of hours so I didn't have any trouble with them spreading.

I made these cookies for Christmas and my only disappointment was that I didn't double the batch! They were wonderful, chewy and were gone by the end of the day! I added raisins and walnuts to mine and they went before all the other cookies made. I suggest putting the dough in the refridgerator for about an hour first and it makes it much easier to bake with.

Not happy with this recipe.  The dough was watery after sitting in the fridge and none of the cookies came out right.  I will be getting my grandmother's recipe.

I had never made molasses cookies before making this recipe.  It was SO easy and SO delicious.  I made a batch for my office and everyone is RAVING about them.  They are so moist and flavorful!  This is going to become a yearly holiday tradition for me!  Thanks for the submission Brenda!

I have made numerous molasses cookie reciipes. This is the best we have done. For the men in my family who love molasses cookies they like less ginger i took the ginger out and got better reviews. So I make both every year as it is requested.The recipe is great on it own but i have tough critics, Ha Ha

These cookies are moist and delicious!  The fragrance of the spices when I pulled them out of the oven was wonderful!    I did double the spices as previous reviewers suggested, but I kept the baking soda the same and thought they tasted great.  I also did not roll in sugar as they were sweet enough without it.

OH my gosh!  Sooooo good!  I LOVE chewy cookies, so I undercook these just a tiny bit and they are so great!  They stay chewy for days (if they last that long) and your house smells amazing after baking them!

This recipe is almost exactly like the one my mom has!  The only differences were the use of shortening instead of margarine and double the molasses to 1/2 a cup.  I sooo loved these as a kid!  I did make the change of cutting the baking soda to 1 tsp.  Watch your cooking time for chewy cookies and enjoy!

I used butter instead of margarine and even though I chilled the dough they spread out and got quite thin.  However, they were awesome!  Kind of like a chewy, crispy ginger snap.

Mine came out flatter than the ones pictures but very chewy. Yum. The changes I made were reducing the baking soda to 1 1/2 t and adding 1 t of vanilla. (I just can't make cookies without vanilla) I made the batch twice - they tasted the same. But the prettier ones - with beautiful crinkled tops - the wet mixture was beaten a bit more before adding the dry (was lighter and fluffier). Also, cookies baked were without parchment paper on the sheet came out prettier too. Not sure why.

Awesome cookies! We have had this recipe for years . The only difference is the spices. We always use 1 tsp. of ginger and we add 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg along with the called for amounts of cinnamon and cloves. The are so good! Using brown sugar isn't necessary since you are adding molasses. These are perfect, chewy, and delicious!

Growing up, my mom wld make molasses cookies and they were wonderful!  Alas, she passed and took her recipe with her.  I made these last night and they were just like moms!  Thank you!  Thank You!  I used a melon baller and it worked perfectly and gave me uniform size cookies.  I also took someone else's advice and baked for only 8 min 30 seconds and they are chewy and moist and perfect!

This is the first time I've eaten a molasses cookie, so I'm not sure how they're supposed to taste. I followed the recipe exactly since I'm not much of a baker. They tasted great. Both my husband and I found them spicy enough. I found them a bit salty though. Maybe next time, I'll try unsalted butter. I'll try 1 tsp baking soda too (as many have suggested). My husband said they should be a bit thicker. My cookies turned out pretty flat, but they were still chewy and crisp around the edges, so still very good texture. Maybe the butter will make them stay a bit thicker. I don't want them to turn into snaps so I'm not going to make the whole batch. I'll leave the dough in the fridge and make as many as we are going to eat. Warning: keep an eye on them in the oven. They go from perfect to burnt pretty quickly.

This is an amazing cookie recipe! I added a couple things like 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom and and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper because I prefer them more spicy but I have tried the recipe as is and it is still excellent! YUM!

These were easy and yummy.  I got about 4 dozen from one batch.  I was in a hurry since the dough needed to be refrigerated so long, so I melted the butter, not completely, but it was pretty much melted.  After an hour refrigerated, the dough was still really greasy.  I rolled the first dozen by hand and cooked for 8 minutes.  After that I spooned them out on the cookie sheet and they still made perfect round cookies.  I reduced the cook time to 7 minutes and they came out perfect. The cookies then came out soft and chewy!  I froze about 2 dozen.

A little bit on more on the cakey side then the chewy side. Great flavor! Next time I will put in a little less salt.

Making this recipe for the second time...delicious and chewy. Love using melted butter so that I don't have to remember to set out butter to get soft. Also used two cookies and spread a layer of vanilla frosting between, very good.

I'm not big on spiced cookies or cakes, but I had a craving for these when I saw the recipe. I think my mom or grandma made these when I was a kid and these taste exactly like the ones I had back then. These are not too gingery, just right. They spread out pretty thin when they bake but the molasses keeps them moist. Higly recommended!

Amazing-- soft, chewy, and delicious.  I am not sure that rolling them in additional sugar does much for them-- perhaps if you used coarse sugar it would be more decorative.

I doubled the spices, used brown sugar, and used black-strap molasses. The cookies were soft (even when coked 8 minutes). Very nice and chewy, but a little spicy/strong. Next time, I'll use regular molasses and cut the spices. Nice cookie, thouh.

Wow these cookies came out great. I didnt put the cloves in (didnt have), and added a little extra molasses. Not really a baker more of a stove top guy. These were very easy to make and spendsome time with the kids.

Pretty good.  In future, I will up the spices as others have suggested.  These have a nice, soft texture, too.  My mom's recipe has much more molasses in it, so these didn't seem 'molasses-y' enough to me.  They're somewhere between a soft ginger snap and my mom's cookie.  Tasty, but I'll be upping the molasses.

I did what other reviewers suggested and used 1 tsp of baking soda and doubled my spices. The taste is really yumz, but I must have done something wrong, because my cookies turned out flat and weird in texture. When baked for 8 minutes at 350F, the bottom was slightly charred. When I lowered the temperature to 325F and baked for 10 minutes, the outside was crispy but the center was uncooked. I agree there should be at minimum 3" spacing between dough because mine spread so much they stuck together. This is too complicated for me to try again. Sorry.

I substituted brown sugar for white, and butter for margarine.  These cookies have a wonderful flavor and smelled great in the oven, but I flattened with a glass dipped in sugar and was sorely disappointed when the end result was "flatter than pancakes".  No crackled tops, boo hoo.  I rolled the last of them in sugar, as suggested, yet they still remained flat.  I'm rating 4 stars for this reason.  I'll make another batch shortly, but this time I'll refrigerate the batter overnight.  *crossing my fingers*!

I made a second batch yesterday that turned out great. The batter yielded 32 cookies so it is accurate. I do however recommend to space the cookies at 3" instead of the specified 2" as they will spread and run into each other. Also my cooking time was 14 minutes, so you may need to experiment on what works for you. I sent them to my parents and they were a hit.

It was a fantastic recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly the way it said to (except I used real unsalted butter) and they turned out fantastic!  Very chewy and very flavorful!  I would suggest this to all levels of bakers - it is very easy to make.

We love this cookie!  Our son has food allergies (soy and dairy), so we replace the melted butter/margarine with corn oil (exact measure).  They turn out great every time.  My mom has even thrown out her old molasses cookie recipe and replaced it with this one.  They only bad thing is that it is hard to eat just one.

These are delicious but make sure to add a little more molasses for better flavor and cook for just 8 minutes for the less flat cookies. Also make smaller balls, I made regular cookie sized balls and they're a little big.

These turned out sooooo flat I don't know what happened.  I did use butter in place of margarine, but I have never found that to make that much of a difference.  After my 1st batch didn't turn out I chilled them overnight and tried 2 more batches and they all turned out thin and crispy, not what a molasses cookie should be.  I ended up throwing 1/2 the batter away.

Except for the one tray I didn't get out of the oven before they burned slightly on the bottom (it was under 10 minutes - so watch the oven as they're all different)these have been nothing short of wonderful.  I've heard nothing but good feedback when I share them.

Great molasses flavor, chewy on the inside, slightly crisp on the edges. Stuck dough outside for ten minutes in -30C weather, cookies were easy to roll into balls. Made a triple batch --> 300 cookies!

I am a huge fan of molasses cookies and I like them soft and chewy! This is the perfect recipe and I will be throwing all my other ones away. Contrary to other reviews, I found these to be perfectly balanced with the spices and sweetness. I took these to a Christmas Cookies Exchange and they flew out the door!! Thanx for an excellent recipe!

When I was a kid I used to have molasses cookies that were a very dark brown. These were not it. I used brown sugar instead of white, but it still didnt do the trick. I thought these would make a wonderful gingersnap, but not a molasses cookie. 4 stars on taste, 2 for being molasses. Don't be deterred though, this is a very nice cookie.

Fantastic! And really easy! I also followed recommendations to use butter and brown sugar instead. My husband raved about them. This will definitely be a standard in our house now!

This recipe was awesome!  They remind me of the molasses cookies that my mom used to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect.  I ended up chilling my dough a little longer than one hour, but it wasn't intentional.  Great recipe!

after reading other reviews, I used butter and brown sugar.  I baked them at 375 for 10 minutes, put them on a rake to cool and my husband and I cannot stop eating them.  Just enough spice, a little "crunch" and sweet all in one.  this one is a keeper and a 5-start.

YUM!  so good and so easy.  soft chewy and look pretty when done!  I did use butter instead of margarine, 1/2 cup of molasses, and a bit less ginger and cloves because I don't like my cookies with too much bite.

This seemed like a good recipe especially from the reviews. So I made dough and chilled it. I rolled them into balls and put them into oven. When i took them out they had melted and my cookie sheets were ruined. I tried the same recipe again and they came out perfect. I only cooke them for about 6-7 minutes so im guessing my oven was too hot or i didn't have enough flower to the dough. Great recipe if it comes out good.

Perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for.  They end up quite crisp, but 12-15 secs. in the micro makes them nice and soft.

Thes were really tasty little cookies.  They weren't very soft or chewy.  They reminded me of a ginger snap.

Pretty good. Mine turned out flat, and I prefer a thicker cookie. I might add more flour and more spice next time, but these have a nice flavor. Cooking time was right at 8 minutes in my convection oven.

This are good but alittle on the ugly side. I would not reccomend them for gift giving thats for sure! They are pretty tasty but undesireably crunchy on the edges. I baked my second batch for 6 minutes and they still came out dark brown, flat and crunchy on edges! I like my molasses cookies to be fluffy and chewy all around not just in the middle.NOV.11 Made remaining dough and these turned out looking great! i would suggest chilling overnight rather than for 1 hr

I'm rating this a 5 because the end result is absolutely awesome!!! (They taste like the Archway brand molasses cookies, which in my opinion is a HUGE compliment.)

That being said, I had an incredibly difficult times working with the dough. It was very sticky and gloopy.  I kept having to stick the dough and then the formed balls and THEN the formed balls rolled in sugar into the freezer to get it to firm up enough to bake.  The resulting cookies were pretty flat, but VERY delicious.  I may reduce the butter or increase the flour next time. Did anyone else have this problem???

These cookies are AWESOME, I undercooked the first batch, but they were still awesome! I'm a big batter fan and this batter is better than choc. chip cookie dough! I agree it is more of a ginger snap cookie.

My friends and I loved these cookies.  I used approx. two teaspoons of grated fresh ginger, which gave them a nice kick.  I also added nutmeg and left out the cloves.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!

These were the changes I made: Butter instead of margarine and only 6 Tbs; brown sugar instead of white; increased ginger to 1 Tbs.  Both my husband & mother-in-law loved these cookies.  Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe!  I used butter instead of margarine, and the texture was fine -- they flattened out into a nice, chewy cookie. I doubled the cinnamon and was also generous with the ginger. Will make again.

I'm not a molasses cookie lover, but my husband requested these.  They were GREAT!  They came out picture perfect, and my kids had fun rolling them in sugar.  Will give out recipe and make again!

Delicious! Just before baking, I pressed down the cookie balls with the back of the spoon - kept them from getting too puffy and helped them cook more evenly.

I was looking for a plain molasses cookie, so I left out the ginger and cloves.  They turned out well.  I added the ginger and cloves to the sugar I rolled it in for a few cookies.  They looked good, too.  The texture was the best!  Crunchy outside, soft inside, exactly as other reviewers said!

Jackie2830 said she got 30 cookies and the recipe said 5 doz. It says 30 servings which is 2 cookies per serving which makes 5 doz. Cookinkelly thought they were more of a ginger snap,I didn't think so. Depending on how big the cookie is depends on the softness of the finished product. If the recipe says 5 doz. I make 5 doz. Follow direction exactly for best results.

Great cookie!  Excellent texture - soft on the inside, lightly crisp on the outside. The flavor is mild but nice. I'm going to try it with a bit more spice next time.

This recipe was awesome!  My entire family gets together and we bake tons of cookies for Christmas.  We didn't have a molasses cookie recipe so I searched and found this one.  If you like the Archway Molasses cookies you'll love this recipe!  And, it's great for the little ones to help make.  My 6 year old niece and 8 year old nephew loved making them and of course, eating them!  This recipe will definately be used by our family for years to come.  I highly recommend it!

These cookies tasted so very good, however they are not molasses cookies. They are ginger snap cookies - which is not what I was looking for. I will keep this recipe along with my others, but under the name "Ginger Snaps" and keep searching for a good molasses cookie recipe.

Reminds me of Christmas. I used mild flavor molasses and less spice than reccommended. The 1st time I made these they were perfect. The 2nd time, they turned out too flat. I tried adding more flour but it didn't help much.

I made this recipe for my dad for Father's Day, and it was delicious.  This is the best molasses cookie recipe that I have come across.  I got about two dozen cookies from the recipe using a small cookie scoop.  Thank you for sharing!

I made these at the request of my husband, he loved them.  You can either make them very soft or you can make them chewy buy adjusting the baking time by a few minutes.  I don't usually care for molasses flavored things, but these were perfect.

I was on a hunt to find a molasses cookie recipe to make the molasses cookies I used to be able to buy from the Vermont Country Store catalog. (Haven't seen them in there lately.) I tried many molasses cookie recipes in my search, but I finally found the closest match in this recipe. To get a bit more "zing," I bumped the cloves and ginger to 3/4 tsp each, and that did the trick. Everyone at work asked for the recipe when I took the cookies in--a pretty big deal since I'm not terribly domestic! :-D The hubby loves them, too.
