I emptied my freezer of venison over Memorial Weekend and made 3 different jerky recipes. With the exception of substituting venison for beef I made as written. This came out perfect. All three came out great but I did prefer the red pepper flakes the others called for. Regardless, I will make this again and just add some too it. Great recipe!

Full dislike of recipe.  WAY too much Soy.  Cook it like we like too?!?  Why follow a recipe that doesn't offer NO suggested cooking temperature.  #idiots

We don't have a large smoker so cut the recipe in 1/2. our butcher recommended London broil as that is what he uses for jerky so that is what he cut for us. Since there was no temp in the recipe we followed the guidance of another reviewer and did  the 180 for 2 hours then 160 for 2 hours. We wanted it smokier and not so much soy flavor we it smoked for another 90 minutes at 160-170.  We used hickory chips. My husband loves it. We will make it again but will decrease the soy sauce a little. Thanks for the recipe. Well worth making.
