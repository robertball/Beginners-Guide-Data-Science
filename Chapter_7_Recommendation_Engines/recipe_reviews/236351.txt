While I really believe Barillo pastas are some of the best, I've been less than enthused with their recipes. I used 8 ounces of pasta and that was too much in proportion to the other ingredients. The chicken, broccoli and cherry tomatoes were lost in the pasta. The flavors where trying hard to "come through", inspite of the 6 cloves of garlic and triple thyme I used. Salt and pepper were sorely needed, which I did add. We have been eating whole grain pasta since it was introduced and loving it. We appreciate the extra fiber and protein it offers. Thank you, Barillo, for your fine productsa!

I agree with many reviewers about it needing something - I added more pesto and that helped (I make my own pesto with fresh basil and I think that has a stronger flavor so that might also have helped). I added pine nuts for a little crunch. I will make again as it was easy and pretty healthy.

I had read the reviews and saw the it was kind of bland, so decided to make the "Pesto" recipe here on the Allrecipes site, thinking that the fresh-picked-from-the-garden herbs and freshly ground parmesan would make a big difference in the outcome.  It was...still lacking something.  The directions felt a bit clunky to me, and it was hard to keep up with it all.  Next time, I would set the pot of water to boil first, then grill the chicken, then leave it to rest while I worked on the veggies, setting those aside in a large bowl until needed.  Then I would cook the spaghetti, toss it into the vegetables until well-mixed, then add the pesto to coat well.  I had added the pesto first, and by the time the veggies were added, the spaghetti had absorbed everything and there wasn't much left over.  Maybe that would have made a difference?  Also, I added more salt than I normally do, but the depth of flavor still didn't seem strong.  Individually, all the components were great.  But together?  It just seemed disjointed.  I'll have to try again.

This was just okay.  As is, I felt like it was missing something.  Added more salt and extra pesto sauce to the dish and shredded parmesan cheese helped, but still rather disappointed.  Love Barilla pasta, but this recipe needs a little work.

I always have Barilla Whole Grain Spaghetti on hand and thought I would give this a try. The grilled chicken was perfect but the rest of the meal was just OK. Not sure I will try to make this again with tweaks.

Great recipe! We loved the texture of the whole grain spaghetti. I don't think I will make regular spaghetti anymore! All the ingredients worked really well together. I put 2 chicken breasts in this one.

This was very good with a few modifications. I made my own Pesto and  I added some Tropical Sazon and some red pepper flakes to the marinade for the Chicken. I will be making this again as it was easy and very flavorful. I liked the whole grain pasta, too.

This was a keeper! Loved the texture of the whole grain noodles! I added about a teaspoon of cracked pepper and a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to add some spice.

Delicious.. I had some homemade pesto in the freezer so I used that instead of jarred.  No fresh thyme.. so I used fresh basil

I made this tonight while on vacation in Myrtle Beach & I thought it was delish! I did change a few things. I made it for a house full so I used 4 chicken breast sliced in half to make 8. Marinated it all day (added salt) & made a fresh pesto instead of jarred which I used all of. Although, I absolutely love Barilla I'm not a huge fan of the whole grain I think I would enjoy this more over regular Barilla spaghetti.

It was a good pasta dish. The whole family liked the pasta flavor. I was a little bit skeptical about the whole grain pasta, but Barilla brand is great and you can hardly notice the difference. The chicken was very juicy, but I would let it marinate for a little longer it needed more flavor. The sauce was good and simple but next time I will double the vegetables and pesto quantities. Too much pasta for the amount of sauce. It's healthy and easy , so I will make it again with tiny changes to the recipe.

We were also a bit disappointed with this recipe and thought it was a bit bland. It was ok but needs to be tweaked a bit to make it better. The only change I made to the recipe was to use gluten free spaghetti.

The chicken was not overly seasoned, but, was juicy and had a nice flavor. It seemed bland and a little dry, so, I added a little more pesto.  The additional pesto did add some more flavor, but, the dish still seemed a little dry.

I really loved this meal and so did the rest of my family.  It is a perfect pasta dish for a summer evening.  I followed the recipe nearly as written, except I added some more pesto than it called for.  The Barilla Whole Grain Spaghetti is so good, it was my first time trying it.  I will definitely be adding this to my dinner repertoire!

This was great! I had already marinated & grilled chicken breasts with garlic & herbs the night before, so this came together in no time! I'd never tried whole grain pasta & to be honest, I couldn't taste any difference (Yay, Barilla!). This dish will be made many more times in our house.
