This is absolutely wonderful candy! I love Mexican candy and this is the real thing. Took a full 45 minutes of cooking with nonstop stirring. Got a little tired but oh my it was worth it. Candy's so smooth and melts in your mouth. Sweetness is just right. I used walnuts (cheaper than pecans) and it was great. Make sure and use a big pot as milk seems to double in size until it boils down to a rich caramel color. I will be making this again!

Tastes really good! But if you want something to whip up quick this is not a recipe for you! You have to stir this constantly for a good 30 - 45 minutes! Definetely not good for bad hands LOL Pretty good outcome tastes like pecan pralines but a little less sweet!

A little elbow grease doesn't hurt and neither does stirring this delicious recipe. I have never tasted anything soooo yummy. This brought back memories of my childhood growing up in El Paso Tx.

This didn't work for me at all:(:( It cook on the stove while I stired for almost 2 hours. Then Ipoored it into a pan even though it was still pretty runny. I put it in the fridge and it stayed in there all night and the next day.I ended up throwing it away because it was gooey and clumpy:(.

Im not sold on naming this candy fudge. Its tasty and sticky. Taste like a carmel with nuts and a touch of cinnamon. My end product was not pretty but tasted good.
