Absolutely delicious. Good and creamy. The cream corn made all the difference! I followed the directions except I used frozen pasta instead. Also be careful not to over cook the vegetables because you will cook them again once you add the cream sauce

Chef John never fails me. This was fantastic - especially for someone lactose intolerant. Perfect with bacon. Thank you Chef John!

I made this meatless by leaving out the bacon and I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and it came out a little on the bland side (understandably) but I added a bunch of cheese at the end and put an extra pinch of cayenne in my bowl which gave it a little kick and really brought out the rest of the flavor!!

I used bacon instead of pancetta And left out the parsley. It was a wonderful way to use all of the veggies from my summer garden. Don't use all the corn cream or undertook everything and extend the sauce simmering time to let it reduce and thicken. Delicious, light and summery with little chewy salty bits of cheese and bacon. I will make it again.

Wow, this was good.   My whole family, including children, liked it.  Great way to use up uneaten ears of corn.  I followed the directions exactly, and my only change for next time will be to add more zucchini and peppers.

I followed the recipe and did not strain the corn. I think next time I'll add more veggies, easily another cup of zucchini. I really liked the basil, too, it's so fresh tasting. Oh, I did add a rib of celery which I think added another interesting dimension.

Maybe I screwed up as I’m a big fan of chef John. I’m thinking my corn wasn’t sweet enough as I tasted no corn flavor. I also used rigatoni as I didn’t have cavatelli. I ended up using a corn slurry, added half and half and red pepper flakes. My husband really liked it, I wasn’t as thrilled. I have better pasta dishes up my sleeve so I don’t think I’d make this again. I’m still a huge fan Chef John. Your quiche recipe is fabulous.

Delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated with bacon.  Surprisingly it was not that difficult - I am not a big time cook at all and was a bit intimidated with the corn thickening....it did and it was so good I shared the dish with a friend!
Second day, I added additional cayenne pepper and loved it even more.

I was really impressed with how decadent this tasted!  The "corn cream" didn't thicken for me, so I just added a corn starch slurry at the end and it worked great.  Fantastic flavor and mouth feel!  I will definitely be making this again and again!
