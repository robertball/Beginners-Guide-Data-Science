This is one of the two cheese dips I made yesterday for the Super Bowl and this one came out on top. I loved the addition of beans and red onion. The other one I made earned brownie points with the addition of sausage though. So when I make this next time I will sub out 1/2 pound of the ground beef for spicy pork sausage. This recipe did not taste overly salty like most American cheese dips do. Definitely a keeper!
