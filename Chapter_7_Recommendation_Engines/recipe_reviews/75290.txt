Great Burger!  Whipped up cajun seasoning (from a cookbook recipe) by using 2 parts black pepper, 1 part ground cayenne, 1 part cumin, 1 part nutmeg and a dash of salt.  Used yellow onion, not white and I think the beef was just round or 'hamburger'.  Didn't have pepperjack slices, so used provolone.  The mayo made a great topper.  One of the best burgers we've ever had.

This was awesome! :] Really really good. I added extra worcestershire sauce to it. I roughly cut my jalapenos and onions, since it doesnt bother me, but other people might want to finely chop their vegetables. I really love spicy food, so next time i might add hot sauce/tabasco to the meat or something. If you arent a lover of spicy foods, heres a tip: the heat of a jalapeno is within the membrane inside it, so if you remove that it wont be as hot. Also, 1/2 cup of mayonnaise was alot. I think i used about a couple teaspoons per burger. You'll probably only need 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup. Next time [and there definately will be] i might add a little more seasoning to the mayo.

These burgers are just awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic, and I can't say enough about how simple but perfect the cajun mayo was.  Yum!

The search for the perfect home burger is over! Oh my! These were fabulous! I pre-grilled my buns in olive oil on the griddle while I was making my burger mix.  Then I stuck them back in their bag to stay warm and moist while I griddled the burgers. The spicy mayo just makes these burgers.  Thank you!  Thank you!!

Great burger!  The mayo really topped it off nicely.  Was on the lower end of spicy for us, so next time I'll be more generous with the jalapenos and spice.

This recipe was really pretty good... maybe just a bit too much pepper for my liking as they were a bit too crunchy.

Delicious burgers. Nice and juicy. I would add extra jalepeno peppers to it the next time as I found it still needed more kick - but I like things HOT and SPICY.

These burgers are really good!  However, I must admit that I did add an extra jalapeno and increased the amount of cajun seasoning (homemade using Emeril's recipe for "Essence").  The recipe "as is" would probably be fine but the hubby and I like well seasoned, spicy food.

These burgers had a nice spicy kick but not a lot of flavour. I think we just prefer a burger with grilled onions, bacon & BBQ sauce.

use 80/20 ground beef so there's enough fat in the burger. It's what makes them good!

This burger is better than any burger I've had in a long time. It is definitely spicy and full of flavor. We made it exactly as written and will make it many more times.

Oh, these are the best tasting burgers I have ever had! I made these for an early dinner today, and after two bites my husband declared that this was the best hamburger he's ever tasted. The only thing I did differently was to put the cheese on after the burgers came off the grill (we have a tendency to lose the cheese off the meat when it's too hot), but I wouldn't dare change another single thing about this recipe...this recipe makes the absolulte perfect burger. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Sarah. It was a huge hit with my husband and sons.

This was very good, but I think next time instead of Cajun seasoning in the mayo, I would use a chipotle cumin mix. Also, I had a hard time keeping the burger patties formed, had to freeze them a bit to hold together for the grill. They were pretty wet...maybe next time just a little bit of fine bread crumbs to hold things together. We will make these again, my husband loved these burgers!

I put my own twist on this - as we so often do -

I used ground chicken instead of beef, soy sauce instead of worshy sauce, an extra clove of garlic, 1 and 1/2 jalepeno' and left out the cheese. I served it on wheat buns and we loveddd it!!!! Thanks for the great idea!

Loved these! I only used a third of the jalapeno and really finely chopped the pepper and onion because I wasn't sure the kids would like it, but they loved it! The mayo is perfect with the meat! Perfect with some home made fries.

Pretty good! Plans changed suddenly when I couldn't find thawed, uncooked shrimp while shopping for tonight's dinner. I did a quick search for burgers on my iPad and this was the first recipe to come up in my recipe box. Since I had already saved this, I decided to go for it. While this wasn't my favorite burger, I thought it was quite good nonetheless. My hubby thought it was "OK," but then again, he likes his burgers plain (plain = blah!). I pretty much followed Sarah's directions exactly except for subbing Emeril's Southwest seasoning for Cajun seasoning / Essence (I thought I had the latter at home, but didn't). I liked my substitution a lot! The Southwest spice blend complemented the jalapeno in the burger nicely! Served on seeded hamburger buns with pepperjack, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, "Southwestern-seasoned" mayo and a side of chips / salsa, this was a quick and filling meal. Thanks for sharing, Ms. Stephan! :-)

I broiled these for about 5 minutes per side, as it was too cold to grill outside.  Delicious and just the right amount of spice.

Woohoo!!!!! Another burger to add to the summer fun! This was outta this world! The veggies in it made it SO juicy and the flavor was outstanding! I followed the recipe exact. I was worried it was going to be too spicey as I am not one with a high heat tolerance, but it was hardly spicey at all.....of course it would depend on the pepper too, so the one we used must not have had too much kick in it. I can't wait to make this up for some guests...I  know they will rave about it!

Delicious. The only thing I did differently was to use 3 large jalepenos in the meat mixture (Husband likes things spicy). I cooked them on the Foreman grill, and they were awesome. Thanks, Sarah!

So delicious! Been watching the carbs so just served it on a bed of lettuce with a dollop of the mayo on top and topped with the burger & tomato wedges.  I used regular jack cheese because I didn't have any pepper jack.  Added a few pickled jalapeno slices for extra zip and topping! Super good! Will make this again and again!

Loved this burger and I LOVE burgers. I did use lite mayo & light Jack cheese. I cut the recipe back to 2 5oz burgers and used a whole Jalapeno pepper.  Thanks for a great Saturday night Burger.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY..which is a first for me. I'm only giving this three stars because it never blew my mind. Yes these burgers are tasty but I couldn't taste any of the cajun spice or jalapenos. This tasted like your everyday homemade burger nothing more nothing less even the cajun mayo tasted like something that just was there to moisted the bun. I may try this again with a different brand of spices and def increase the spince and jalapenos. Thanx for sharing.

Really good - not knock your socks off, but really good. The jalapeno gives a good spice essence without overpowering the flavor or causing steam to come out of your ears.

Fantastic!! I could not believe how moist these are!! I did not add the jalapeno and I but the onion and extra garlic into the food processor because the burgers will fall apart on the grill if they are not finely, finely minced. Such a great flavor and incredibly juicy. These burgers go great with the roasted cajun potatoes recipe from this website!

Very good.  Cooked the onions and jalepenos in a little oil and then cooled before putting them in the burger.  I like my onions cooked and they never seem to when cooked in the burger.  Will make again.

Yum Yum Yum, great recipe  :) I did change a few things, I added some red hot to kick it up a bit, and stuffed it with mushrooms, and cheese. I also added a couple tablespoons of crushed up fritos. Thank you though, I will defintely make this again :)

This was very tasty. I didn't have any buns so I used toasted naan bread which turned out to be crispy and really tasty. I will make this again and will try other kinds of bread.

I omitted the tomatoes because we aren't tomato lovers but other than that I did it pretty much exactly. I did leave just a little seed and pulp and I agree that is the way to go for extra spicy. I was super excited to heat up my leftover burgers for lunch the next day, and it was delicious reheated in the microwave! :) yum.

Great flavor! Followed the recipe exactly for the burgers. But for the mayo sauce I used Sriracha (to taste) instead of the Cajun seasoning that I used in the burgers.

These burgers have great flavor. I love the cajun mayo too. Yummy! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the use of sirloin. Ok if you want a dry burger. Round is much much better for burgers. You want it to have a little more fat to keep it juicy.

I made this following the recipe as closely as I could.  But I had to go about this a little differently.  My burgers were already formed and I was in a hurry, so I didn't add the jalapeno, onions, garlic, cajun seasoning or worcestershire sauce to the meat itself.  I did sprinkle the Cajun seasoning on the outside of the burgers and dressed them with a slice of red onion, along with the pepperjack cheese, tomato and lettuce. I served the jalapenos on the side.  All I really ended up omitting from the recipe was the garlic and worcestershire.  We really enjoyed these and I especially loved the Cajun mayo.

AWESOME!!! I used red onion, more worcestershire, and Zateran's blackened seasoning, also added an egg to the burger mixture (mine wanted to crumble due to the jalapeno and onion).  Cooked on the barbie, with pepperjack and swiss.  Delish, and the cajun mayo is a MUST!!!!

I made these but I had bought meat that had been made into patties, and since they do such a good job of making the patties, I grilled the onions and jalepenos and threw them on top of my burgers.

Just use good meat and these come out amazing everytime!

this is a good burger recipe but we still found it a little plain.  The cajun mayo was a great touch that spiced it up a little more.  Will try again but may modify the burger a little more.

Nice recipe to change up the burger a bit.  Followed to a "t" except I did not use ground sirloin.  Nice flavorful burger and not too spicy.  Thanks for sharing.

Good.  We had to grill these on the George Foreman since it started raining right before dinner.  I'm thinking they would have been better on the regular grill so we will give them a try again.  The cajun mayo was a nice change from ketchup and mustard.

Good burger recipe! I made this for a spontaneous BBQ one weekday evening and it was easy and tasty! Everyone loved the jalapeno and the cajun mayo was yummy too. Next time I think I'll make extra mayo and make sweet potato fries to dip. I'm giving it a 4/5 stars because I thought that while it was spicy it lacked a bit of flavour.

This hamburger was amazing! I was afraid that with the jalapeno it would be too spicy, but it added just the right amount of kick to the burger. The mayo/cajun seasoning was a great way to tie the whole thing together so that you got spicy-ness throughout. I got in a hurry and forgot to add the Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture (realized it right when I was grilling them - oops!), but it didn't seem like the burger was missing anything. Loved by the whole family, my husband and I each ate one, and we gave a half to our three year old...now to see who gets the one leftover hamburger tomorrow. Will make again soon, I'm sure. Thanks for the great recipe, Sarah!

I really enjoyed these, they had nice flavor and a nice spiceyness. I used pickled jalapenos. I really liked the cajun mayo, very simple, will make that again.

Wow - I've made these twice now and this last time, the burgers were to die for!  We are always looking to help spice up the meat of the burger without overpowering it and this is it!  The only changes I made were eliminating the jalapenos and then adding a couple dashes of cayenne pepper.  We didn't want it too spicy with our 5 year old eating a burger.  Fantastic, I'm not sure we'll ever make burgers without spicing them up with this recipes again!

My husband called this "the best burger he's ever had!" I'm thrilled to have a go-to burger recipe. I did make a few modifications just to personalize it to our tastes...added diced mushrooms, used soy instead of worcestershire, and used ground turkey rather than beef.

These were a HUGE BBQ hit. Everyone loved them. I used diced canned jalepeno's and though they were going to be insanely spicy and they were not at all. We also added some Cayenne pepper to the mayo and it was so yummy (we love spicy!). We made these with both ground beef and buffalo and loved each.

I liked this, but my husband thought it was out of this world. The pepperjack goes well with the cajun mayo, but I think I might have used a more "tex-mex" seasonings in the burgers themselves instead of the cajun.

Great idea for burgers. I made them for my husband for Father's Day and it was a big hit! I think I'll add more jalapenos next time.

I make these all the time, and everyone always loves them.  They are so moist and have so much flavor.  An easy way to save on calories is to use a light or ff mayo.  After mixing it with the cajun spices, no one has ever noticed that it's not regular mayo.  Also, because these burgers are so moist, I use a lean ground beef.

What a great twist on a burger.  BEWARE if you are not a fan of some PEP!  The only thing I added extra was a little BBQ sauce and they came out so juicy and yummy!  Thanks for the share.

Up front, I'll tell you I used pre-made burger patties - sprinkled each with Wor sauce and cajun seasoning (about 1/8t of each per patty).  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Loved them!  Why haven't I thought of cajun mayo??!

These saved the day!  Great burgers.  I made enough ground sirloin for 6 burgers and left the seasonings the same based on other reviews.  Didn't want to take a chance of getting them too salty.  It was perfect.  I received many complements.  It made up for a grilled chicken recipe I made that didn't turn out as well as expected.  These I would make again in a heartbeat!  Thanks Sarah!

Great Burger, resturant quality. I would omit the peppers in the burger as the cajun seasoning makes it spicy. If you want the burger HOT then keep the peppers.

Excellent.  I use pickled jalapenos from
a jar since I always have them on hand.
Even my daughter loves these burgers, and she's a picky eater.

Great tasting burgers.  I wanted them a little spicier the second time around so I added hot spices you would find at a pizza restaurant, extra jalapeno, and more cajun seasoning.  They turned out great!

Love it!! I sprinkle on a little more Worcestershire Sauce when I get them made into patties but other than that this is perfect! The cajun mayo is awesome, I crave these burgers everytime we grill out!

These were VERY juicy! My husband had juice running down his hand and arm! I topped each burger with a "glop" of guacamole before serving which added an even nicer 'kick' with the cajun mayo.

We like this kind of food down in Texas. The peppers, onion and spiced mayo make this a really flavorful burger. A nice change from the usual cheeseburger. It has a little bit of a kick!

This burger was delicious.  Spicy, but not too overpowering.  The cajun mayo makes the burger for sure!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sarah.

It was good, I would add extra worcestershire sauce and cajun spices to the burger next time though. All in all was very good.

Fantastic!  We loved the cajun mayo and the burgers were fantastic!  I did add an egg and some bread crumbs to the burger mix to help them hold together on the grill.  I omitted the jalapeño simply because we didn't have any.  Great burger!

My modifications. I always have canned jalapenos on hand but since they are pickled they lose some of the heat... so I added a dash of Lousiana Hot Sauce and a few good shakes of crushed red pepper flakes. instead of pepperjack I sprinkled shredded colby jack into the mixture. (didn't have pepperjack on hand) I also added some Emeril's Essence (BAM!). My Cajun seasoning on hand was too salty so I opted for black pepper for the substitute. I blended the jalapeno, onion & garlic in the food processor. Patties formed easily and burgers were nice & juicy even though cooked well (no pink). Good amount of heat and flavor ratio.

This burger is amazing!! The best I've made at home! I used onion powder instead of diced and added a capful of liquid smoke. I grilled them on our indoor grill and they were perfect for colllege game day. I topped with avacado, bacon, tomato and red onion. I served with Spicy Chili French Fries from AR. Perfect combo! DH said "now this is man food".

Very tasty! I made a lazy vegan version: I used Gardein Beefless Burgers and topped them with chopped onion, garlic, jalapeno, Daiya pepperjack cheese, vegan Worstershire, lettuce, and tomato. I used Veganaise for the vegan mayo. I copied Barnkitty's Cajun spice blend formula. Delicious!

In a parallel universe, I would make a homemade veggie burger and mix in the onion, garlic, etc.

This was a great change to a simple burger. We used venison instead of beef so to keep it moist, I added an egg and 1/8 c. milk to the meat mixture. I believe next time I will add more cajun seasoning and maybe some creole to the mayo. Other than that, it was a big hit!

I made these for dinner tonight for my dad and I. They were really good but my dad didn't like the Cajun Mayo very much. Next time I will probably add more of the Cajun seasoning to the mayo. I also used two small jalapeños and about 1/4 the seeds in the hamburger mix.  I topped the burger with lettuce, grilled onions, and tomatoes.

It was the first burger I ever made myself...and it was very good!!  I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I used southwest seasoning instead...worked fine!  I used a chile pepper instead of a jalapeno because I didn't it.  It had a slight kick...but not an overdose.

This burger is okay and a nice change from the average burger.  Here are the things I did differently . . . 1. Halved the recipe because it was just me eating them.  2. Used Tone's Cajun seasoning (didn't love it so maybe that's why the burgers/mayo tasted okay).  3. Used Kraft olive oil mayo.  4. Made the burgers with ground turkey to be a bit more healthy.

Perfect for a July barbecue. Prepared these spicy sandwiches exactly as directed and will make them again. Served with blue corn chips and Black Bean and Corn Salad II (from this site), simple green beans, and limeade. For dessert, we had Spring Lime Tea Cookies (also from this site). Life is good.

These were hit at the 4th of July Bar B Que and everyone loved the taste. I made them into "mini" burgers and used the Hawaiian rolls for the buns. Since they were smaller, no one had to choose between the brats and burgers...they could have both! Thanks for the great recipe and jazzing up the ordinary hamburger!

This burger reminds me of a jerk burger we had in the west indies.  Spicy and juicy! I dont think you need to use ground sirloin.  It is really pricey!  I think ground chuck or ground beef will work just fine.  The veggies keep this burger moist and juicy. My grocery store didnt have any jalepenos so I used the pickled kind in the jar.  I also added more cajun seasoning to the mayo because I like things really spicy! Great recipe!

I will update when I have cooked these burgers but I did want to say that the smell is AMAZING :)  I can hardly wait to cook them.  I am freezing these 3 days prior to cooking them on the grill to save time down the road.  I did not change the original recipe  much but had to for some things as this is what I had on hand.   I doubled this recipe more or less.  I had about 3 1/2 lbs of ground beef. I only had jar sliced jalepenos and used about 12 of those.  I used 1 Cup diced onions,2 cloves garlic,and had no worch.sauce so I substitued 2 TBSP of A-1 Sauce.  I also doubled the Cajun Seasoning for the meat mixture.  I made 10 good sized hamburger patties out of this meat and had enough leftover meat to do something additional.  I decided to do the following: I will be using leftover meat for tacos or a casserole.  I added about 2 Tsp of Chili Pwdr to those and precooked the meat and allowed it to cool before adding to a freezer bag and we will either have it for lunch or I will put it in the freezer for another meal another day.  Thank you for a great recipe!  I just sampled the cooked meat mixture and I love it.  It has a kick to it but we love spicy food!  Just cut back on the Jalepeno if you do not like yours as spicy.  MMM wish it was sunny and warm today this would be on the grill for sure!  Thanks again.  I will reveiw the burgers after we try those as well but so far I can't see why they wouldnt be just as great seeing as they will be topped with the pepper jack cheese

Perfect! For personal taste, I added a bit of cayenne to the meat mix, and 4 large mushrooms finely diced for increased juiciness. For extra spice, don't seed the jalapeno! I used one 16oz tube of 93/7 ground turkey and didn't miss the beef at all. For the mayo, I used 1/3 cup fat free mayo, 1 tsp Cajun seasoning, 1.5 tsp minced garlic, a pinch of salt and a few dashes of cayenne. We love it spicy and this hit the spot. Thanks so much for the recipe. This will definitely be a regular.

I was worried that this burger would taste a little like a spicy meatloaf but I am so glad that I tried this recipe.  The cajun mayo is delicious and really makes this burger taste like it came from our favorite gourmet restaurant.   My picky husband even gave it a thumbs up.  I didn't have the fresh jalapeno so I used a couple of slices of pickled jalapeno and used American cheese.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for a new favorite.

Have made these twice.  2nd time was for a camping trip, made in advance and froze raw.  Thawed in the cooler, and cooked over open flame.  Alot of people wouldn't try them because of the jalepeno, but those that did liked them.  I personally thought they were quite good.  The mayo is yummy!

It was great! Definitely one of the best burger recipes on this site. I added a little bit of Kosher Salt to the burgers to bring out the flavors of the Cajun seasoning, and some cayenne pepper to the mayo for some extra kick. I also buttered and broiled the buns. 

I will definitely be making this again and again!

This was a really great burger. I used canned diced jalapeno and about what looked like a pepper's worth and replaced the fresh onion with dried minced onion. I thought they might be too spicy but they weren't at all. Wonderful burger and nice change from plain jane cheeseburgers. I'll probably make these again. Thanks for the great idea Sarah!

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and followed the rest of the recipe as stated. My husband and daughter liked these very much (they rated the recipe a 4) as for myself my mouth was on FIRE! I can take a little heat but these seemed to get hotter with every bite I took. The cajun mayo was very good, we spread that on the bottom of the bun, then topped the burger with homemade guacamole. Not sure if I will make these again, maybe.

Good recipe.  Burgers will be more moist if you gently formed the patties rather than making balls and squashing them.  Also a mixture of ground round and ground chuck will be more flavorful, though they have a bit more fat.  Be sure and use fresh Jalapenos, pickled will not cook well and don't have as much heat.  If you want pickled add them as a condiment.  Recipe as written is a great combination of texture and flavor.

This was a big hit at our house. The mayo/cajun seasoning mix provided ample leftovers for my dipping happy son, who can't eat any kind of meat without indulging in a dip! The burgers were very tasty and a nice change of pace. A leftover burger reheated well two days later and the same son, upon eating the leftovers, sighed a long sigh and declared, "this burger is really good!" I didn't have cajun seasoning on hand, but found a recipe compiled of things I had on hand (cayenne, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, oregano, and thyme). That low-carb cookbook still comes in handy!

I don't know what went wrong here, but these burgers had no taste.  I even doubled the spices.  The only advice I can give people is to make the mayo the day before.  It tasted better the second day, and the mayo is the only reason this recipe got three stars.  Sorry, but I won't be making these again.

Awesome!!!  We will definately have them again!  I actually used ground turkey (just because we had it and flavors really mix in well with that meat it seems) and colby/monterey jack cheese because it was on hand.  I highly recommend these burgers!  Thanks!

Made these for the 4th of July.  Wonderful flavor, not spicy though.  More jalapeno's in the mix next time, personal preference is more spice!! Mayo was really good, would make a great dip for onion rings or frys.  Would make again and again.

These were really good but next time I make them I'm going to cut down on the Cajun seasoning by at least half and add cayenne pepper as we found them way too salty for our tastes.

This is an "EXCELLENT" burger.  The only thing I changed was the jalepenos.  I minced up jarred jalepeno slices this added a really nice bite and you could actually taste the jalepeno.

We liked this recipe - we left out the jalapenos because my husband doesn't like them, but I would have liked them in there! Also made some with cheddar (for him) and some with the Pepper Jack - definitely better with the Pepper Jack. Easy recipe and really juicy. Our cajun mayo was a little bit salty, but it may have just been the brand we used. We'll definitely make these again.

I used canned sliced jalapenos (nacho style), and these burgers blew my mind.  Excellent contribution.

Made these burgers for the family and even the little kids couldn't get over how tasty they were.  I will make these all year round!!  They do have a little bit of a burn to them but it is very tolerable.

Awesome! Didn't seem as spciy as I thought they might be though. The real gem in this recipe is the cajun mayo, though! I use it in so many different recipes. Yummy!

Thanks for sharing.  These turned out really, really good with lots of flavor. They are a welcome change from the traditional burger recipes and they happened to be an extraordinary counterpart to the Applesauce burgers which I also served at the same time.  One hot and spicy--the other sweet and tangy.  I'll be adding this one to my repertoire.

These are great, adding the chopped jalopeno peppers really adds a zip. One change or addtion was about a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddder mixed with the ground beef. Thanks for the recipe.

Yowza Sarah, these were so good! I used ground turkey and low fat mayo. I'm not a huge fan of low fat mayo, but the cajun seasonings really made a difference. YUM and thanks!

Awesome recipe. Instead of the sirloin, I simply used lean ground beef. Based on others input, I cooked the onions prior to adding them to the meat. The Cajun spices is what makes this recipe so great.

These are good burgers.  My husband and I both enjoyed them.  I didn't have any Jalapeno, so I omitted it.  We both thought there was still plenty of flavor without it.

I had a little trouble getting the onions and peppers to stick inside the patty.  One pound of hamburger isn't enough - you really need that extra 1/3 lb for more "glue".  It's a nice twist to the classic burger though.  The cajun mayo was easy and tasty.

These are fantastic!  My husband and our best friend couldn't stop raving. The only difference I made was that I added about two teaspoons of hot sauce to the mayo and the hamburgers.   We like our stuff spicy.  Will defintely make again.  Have been making these lately with serrano peppers because we are exploring more spice than jalepenos--very good.

I like the sauce, but I'd prefer a more traditional burger recipe. It has a nice tang but the whole ingredients will be prepared next time on top of the burger instead of in it.

Pretty happy with this burger. I needed to add more cajun seasoning to both the burger and the mayo. "Cajun Seasoning" can vary quite a bit recipe to recipe or brand to brand so that is really to taste. Love the Worcestershire sauce in the meat, but the chopped onion and jalapeños get lost. Next time I'll just use them as toppings. 07/11/17

I had this without the bun (less carbs, anyway, which I frequently do), and it was excellent! The mayo sauce was very good, and I just had it on the side. I also did not have the jalapenos available. The cooking time was spot-on, and I put a lid on the pan when the cheese was melting. I like spiciness, and this had a nice kick to it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was the most flavorful burger recipe I've ever made. The only changes I made were: I used extra lean ground beef, I double the jalapenos and added a liberal amount of hot sauce. My husband and I really enjoy spicy food, so we would say this is a medium level of spice. It's not for the faint of heart (stomach), but it could definitely be spicier for those who enjoy heat.

I may not certain what makes this a "Tex-Mex" hamburger but this is a very good hamburger! The only detractor is that it was a little salty but that was from the Cajun spice we used. This is definitely a keeper!

Average. Not so Cajun. Kids did eat it. Made it exactly like the recipe called for.

These were delicious! I used Emeril Lagasse's Essence for my Cajun seasoning. Also, I sauteed my onions and jalapenos in some butter to soften them up before adding them to my meat mixture. I made all of my patties and then refrigerated them until we were ready to grill. I served these with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and pickles. They were a huge hit!

I followed the recipe, for the most part. For how easy these burgers were to make, they were surprisingly good. We even talked about making several batches and freezing, so we would always have them on hand!

I've made these de.icious burgers twice. The whole family loves the extra kick of the spices, and they seem to be juicier than plain burgers as well. If I have cilantro on hand, I like to chop some and add it to the ground beef mix. Avocado slices are a nice addition.

Made with simple Cajun spice from this site. Very tasty and plenty spicy for me. Left out jalapeño since I didn't have one and skipped the cheese. Still very delicious.

Excellent!  I first made this back in 2007 and lost the recipe.  Now I'm organizing all my tried and true recipes and found it!  My son used to ask for this burger and I was disappointed I couldn't find.  So glad I found.  Made exactly as printed and it's a perfect blend of flavors.

These burgers were really good! I pureed all of the ingredients and then mixed the liquid with the ground beef (I also added some bread crumbs for substance). I think this helped make the burgers extra moist and added a rich flavor. Oh, and the mayo was excellent!!!!

These were excellent!  Great 4th of July - easy BBQ! (I have 1 naughty Boxer dog who would also agree - snuck in...she can open doors...and ate 3 of 7 patties!) No changes to recipe - excellent as it stands!

Our new favorite burger! I made the Cajun Spice Mix by Bobbie Jean on allrecipes for this recipe. Yummmm! Broiled burgers in oven. The only change I made is, I probably added a bit more worcestershire. Try this!

Pretty good. I used Monterrey Jack instead of Pepper Jack and added about 14 finely crushed crackers to stretch my 1 lb of ground beef into 4 burger patties. Sprinkled some pepper and seasoned salt to top it off. Yum!

These were SO juicy and tasty! I made the patties up a few hours ahead of time along with the cajun mayo. Next time I might add another 1/2 tsp of seasoning to the mayo, but the burgers themselves were just as spicy as I can handle without being too hot. I had a jar of jalapenos on hand so I diced up a few of those, and topped them with lettuce and tomato. Will be making these throughout the summer!

This is a great recipe for burgers! If you take out the seeds and the white pith of the jalapenos, you get the flavor and not a ton of heat. I like to put my jalapeno and the onion in the mini food processor and chop them up very fine. This way the burgers hold together better. If you hand chop them, get the pieces small or they cause the burgers to fall apart on the grill. I love making cajun butter to have with corn on the cob with these burgers. Simply deliciouoso! I've made these for my family several times this summer and they are always a hit!

I made these for our New Year's Eve at home.  Did not add the chopped jalapeno, because we had a date with the kids, too.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and broiled them - my grill was 'unavailable' that December 31st evening!  They turned out great and even the kids loved them.  I'm keeping this recipe for sure -thanks for sharing!

These were very tasty, not too "bitey" w/the jalapenos.  Will be in rotation for our burgers.  You can easily "heat" up or down depending on your taste.

Great burger recipe. We made them as written but added spicy onion rings to them too. DH added hot sauce to his mayo which was very nice too.

This is really really good.  I omitted the jalapenos since I don't handle spicy foods very well.  The burger was flavorful enough and spicy enough without the jalapenos if you don't prefer them.

Awesome burger! Just the right amount of heat & loved the mayo. I didn't have a fresh jalapeno so I chopped about a dozen pickled jalapeno slices and they were great!

Very good flavor. Kids liked it (we left off the pepper jack for them). It was a little salty with Toni's. I would like to try a different Cajun seasoning next time.

I would not make any changes on this one. If you are looking for a novel way to literally spice up grilled hamburgers, this is it. It transforms the pedestrian burger into something special. The cajun mayo is an incredible idea.

Wow! What a treat for the taste buds. With the cajun mayonnaise you don't need any ketchup or mustard. I served mine with fresh red leaf lettuce and vine-ripened tomatoes, and a side of spicy tortilla chips.

AMAZING!! I loved these burgers & I never like burgers!! We did saute the onion, garlic, & jalapeno slightly & added a little roasted red pepper. Served on grilled ciabata bread.  Perfectly seasoned & very juicy! Can't wait to make these again!

AMAZING!  Thank you!  I used Authentic Cajun Dust Blackening Spice for the seasoning.  Best burger flavor I've had in a long time.  Be sure to use ground sirloin!  Oh- I didn't make the mayo but I'm sure it's great.

Burgers were great, just a little too much Cajun seasoning. Don't get me wrong, I love spice, but next time I think I need a lower salt version. It kind of made the meat a little overbearing.

This is the first time in a LOOOONG while that I have not mixed an egg in with my burger recipes. I did not miss the egg at all! This was delicious, especially adding the jalapeno. I did not have jalapenos actually, what I had on hand were jarred banana pepper slices which worked fine.The mayo mixture was so simple yet yummy. I cooked mine on the Foreman Grill and served on onion rolls.

Made these for my boyfriend's flatmates and got rave reviews!  We tried both pepperjack and colby jack cheeses, and both were well-received.  Not being a mayo fan I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe...it complements the kick in the burgers really well.

These burgers are delicious and the cajun mayo would make a great sauce to use on any burger. I used regular hamburger for convenience. I actually found the burgers to be a bit too moist, so I would probably use dried minced onion or onion powder in the future.

This burger was exceptional!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (used dried onions and about 1/4 cup of red wine in addition to the worcestershire). We cooked on the grill; they were really thick and took a bit longer than 5 minutes per side, but they came out to a perfect medium temperature.   We didn't make/use the cajun mayo, tomato or lettuce - just ate them as is on ciabatta buns.  These were so juicy and flavorful, absolutely high-end restaurant quality!  I recommend using 80/20 ground beef so they stay moist and juicy.

Next time I think I may add more peppers. Thees were really good, but didn't have the "kick" I was expecting. The cajun mayo was a great addition. I didn't have pepperjack on hand, so next time will try that also.

I'd never had ground sirloin before. Maybe that was part of the reason I didn't care for it too much. I think regular hamburger would be better. I really disliked the mayo. Prefer ketchup and mustard on a burger. I felt there was too much cajun seasoning in the burgers and the mayo. Way too salty!

Yummo!  This burger was fantastic!  I am adding this one to my favs!  I did not have the Cajun seasoning exactly so I improvised with some Bijou blast by Emeril and a chili garlic seasoning that I got on sale.  It worked & tasted great!Spicy - but not too much so that you cannot enjoy the flavor.

These were great!  I used 1/2 fat free mayo, and 1/2 low fat and the topping still turned out great!!

I made this with my husband on a Sunday afternoon. We halved the mayonnaise (and Cajun seasoning accordingly) but apart from that the recipe was perfect and pleasurable! 

Thank you

Made these 3 times in 2 weeks, that speaks for itself. Monterey Jack Cheese is spicy enough so I left out the jalapenos. and the onion I put on top with lettuce and tomato on toasted bun. I love the Grill but I put these in a covered pan and cooked them slow with a few splashes of liquid smoke. Yum! Very moist and flavorful. Thank you!

These burgers are a nice change from your 'run of the mill' burger. Spicy and flavorful! Me and the hubbs loved these. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is becasue I would not make these if I were cooking for a crowd. Too many picky people...."no onions" "I don't like it too spicy" "I would never eat mayo!" You know what I mean...but again...delicious. Will be making again.

We really loved this recipe on the grill.  We did add some hot sauce to this for a little more kick and two jalepenos for alot of kick.  We added a clove a garlic to the mayo and that was really good.  Will make again.

These burgers have become a staple in my house... it's hard to make a plain burger after having these! Only thing addition that can ramp them up more is bacon. UPDATE: These make great quesadilla burgers...skip the bun, and wrap the burger in a tortilla. Also good with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun (or both!)

The recipe was good, not great. I found the burger to be a bit bland. It needs a more thorough seasoning or marinade. Cajun mayo was likewise good, but nothing to call home about. 

Not bachelor friendly, as I'd imagine that most bachelors would rather buy pre-made patties

I'm not a huge burger fan but these are addicting!! I make my own burger patties but I always mix mayo with cajun seasoning now, and I love jalapeno's with the beef. Instead of putting onion in the burger, I top it with fried onions. Yummy.

Loved these!!  Very moist and very flavorful.  I used some onion powder instead of onion because I don't like biting into onion, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  We love spicy, so next time I will add another jalepeno.  We also topped our burgers with homemade guacamole.  Definitely adding these to my recipe book!!  They were fabulous!!!

I spiced this up even a bit more by adding some Chorizo sausage to the mix and after cooking I then placed the burgers in buttered tortillas instead of buns with the cheese and grilled them into "quesadilla burgers". YUM!

Made these for end of season BBQ, and everyone thought they were the best tex-mex burger they had ever tried.  I cut back on jalapeno because I was worried about them being too hot- but next time I won't chicken out, and will use whole pepper. used provolone instead of pepper jack cheese. only gave 4 stars because I was not quite as impressed as everyone else was, but I'm out voted by far.

I loved this burger!!  There was lots of flavor, and I liked the kick of the cajun mayo.  I didn't put the full amount of jalapenos in the burger, but next time I will to turn up the heat.  This is a great addition to my recipe collection!

An absolutely fantastic recipe, we really enjoyed this! Not hard to make at all! If you can't get fresh jalapeno peppers, then just use pickled, worked fine for us.

This recipe was fantastic. My family loves it. However, my cajun seasoning is really salty (and I love salt) so I had to scale back on the seasoning the second time around!

I don't know what went wrong but none of us liked the flavor of these. Maybe it depends on which brand of cajun seasoning you use or it could of been the worcestershire, something was off.

These were the best burgers I ever had!  The only difference I made was adding an egg to the ground beef (yes I used the fatty stuff instead of sirloin and it was delicious).  Definitely a keeper.

Very nice change from regular grilled burgers.  Loved the mayo idea, also the chopped jalepenos in the meat was wonderful.

This recipe is amazing! I'm almost 6 months pregnant, and I'm very picky right now. I've tried at least 10 hamburger recipes since I got pregnant and this is the only one that has satisfied my burger craving. I cook them on a charcoal grill and smoke them with hickory chips.

Excellent - used regular med ground beef, no jalapenos (don't like too spicy), doubled up on spice, used skillet (no BBQ available). Turned out great - my 13 year old son and I enjoyed them alot. Cajun mayo is a wonderful addition.

Very good recipe.  I kept everything the same except for the pepper Jack cheese.  I used Sharp Cheddar instead, because that was all that I had.  Still loved it!  Thanks for sharing your recipe:)

Yummy!  The cajan mayo adds just the right kick and the burger is juicy and flavorful.  This recipe is a keeper!
