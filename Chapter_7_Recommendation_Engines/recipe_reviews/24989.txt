This cake turned out delicious despite my mess ups.  My mom said it taste like it came from a bakery.  I was a little worried as i forgot to put one half cup of the sugar flour mixture in the cake batter.  Also I do not have a double boiler so i melted the white choc in microwave.  I should have melted it longer because it needs to be very soft for the frosting as my frosting was a bit hard, still the cake is tremendous.  Next time i want to try that wine cooler in there yummy.  This was the yummiest home cooked from scratch I have ever made.  Despite the messups it was so good the best ever



I am fixing to make this cake for a baby shower Im making three layers light blue icing.  I want it to look really nice and I know on some cakes fore the cake to turn out smooth you have to use a certain type of icing.  Will this icing work?  Do you know how I would also make the decorative icing that goes around the cake using the same recipe?  If not ill figure something out.  If you check this let me know.  I love this recipe

This recipe was easy to follow-inexpensive-and turned out wonderful! It will be a cake recipe I will use in the future!  I did however substitute pure vanilla extract for the almond extract-Also, I made the white chocolate icing with Vanilla extract, and it is great icing.  My family loved it.

I was very disappointed with this cake. Although it tasted good, I expected a light and fluffy cake. This was dense like a poundcake. The frosting was very tasty, though. I replaced one tablespoon of the water with white chocolate liquer and it really added a great flavor.

I love this recipe!  I have used it so many times for a bottom layer on many wedding cakes andhave always recieved oohs and aahs.  it's a family favorite that I am required to make for birthdays every year. We use a raspberry liquir in the frosting and then I add white food coloring to it for the wedding cakes.  DELICIOUS!!!

A wonderful cake.  I changes a few things though  i used 1/2 tesp of almond in the cake and frosting and added 1 tesp. of vanilla as well.I added a little twist.
I toreed the layers to make four. Then I made a Barvarian Cream Filling and a Respberry glaze one each layer.
The White chocolate Frosting is super rich.  with adding the barvarian cream i kept it refrigurated until serving. Let it come to room tempature befor cutting.

My friend found this recipe and asked me to make it for her birthday.  As I was making it, I was hoping it was worth the extra trouble.  The icing  is what really makes this cake.  The cake was very good and the icing is even better (using the almond extract). I will make it again.

The cake's taste was fabulous-- like a very sweet sponge cake.  However, with a white chocolate cake, I was hoping for more of a white color to the cake.  The sides of mine turned out a very dark gold, and the cake was not quite the consistency I was expecting.  This is definitely a recipe I will play around with, but would not serve formally until I revise it a little.

This cake was so good. I made it for my mom's birthday and even my dad ate it, and he's not big on sweets. The almond flavoring made it great. The only thing about it is the cake reminds me of angel food cake. I would prefer a denser white chocolate cake. Awesome flavor though!

I made this cake for my birthday.  Because I had so many guests,I scaled the recipe up to 12 servings. I wish I had thought to buy a third pan once I changed the recipe because the pound cake like texture of this recipe requires it.  The cake was still beautiful however, moist and very dense.  For the frosting,I decided to use a package of cream cheese and go half on the almond and substituted clear vanilla,it was delicious!  I will bake this one again,it's pretty enough to be a wedding cake!

Far too many calories for my liking, but it's really delicious and fairly easy to make.

I managed to burn the chocolate, so I put pink butter icing on the top instead - it looked like a huge fairy cake!

Finally I have found a cake recipe that I was so long seraching for! A fine crumb light cake that tastes good. Thank you so much for sharing. I shifted the flour 3 times with a sieb and I think that was the key to the excellent results. I was not sure how much 3 oz is and when I clicked metric the amount seemed "off" so I used 200 grams of white chocolate couverture. I can not get almond extract so I used Amaretto from Lake Garda. I think with proper Almond Extract this cake would just be dynamite! My son discovered the cake before I could even decorate it so we ate it as it was, without any frosting or topping and it rocked. The next time we had it with strawberries and whipped cream also excellent. I used this recipe with the white chocolate frosting for a christening cake and it was the hit! With recipes like this one I can not understand at all why people buy boxed cakes and then doctor them and think it tastes good. No box can compete with this cake.

I didn't care for this cake. Im so dissapointed that I chose this recipe. It was too too sweet. I couldnt taste the white chocolate at all and the almond extract is way too ovepowering. I had alot of cake left over.

Beautiful texture, great taste. After reading the reviews I fiddled around with the chocolate and sugar amounts: 4 ounces of chocolate and 50 grams less sugar, which worked beautifully. I will definitely make this part of my repertoire! Oh I also used vanilla instead of almond, I just can't see it working with the white chocolate otherwise.

The taste of the cake was good however it did not taste like white chocolate also I was expecting a moist cake and it was dry and crumbly.  The frosting was a bit sweet for my taste however it did have a good white chocolate flavor and great consistency.  I won't be making this cake again.

I thought this cake was very good but the cake was a little dry and I felt that the almond extract overpowered the white chocolate flavor. The next time I make it, I am using a little oil in the cake mixture, adding more white chocolate bark, and using vanilla extract instead.

Tasted on it's own like a delicious sugar cookie. Couldn't taste the white chocolate in the cake at all though. Didn't use the frosting recipe since I'm making a white chocolate ganache for it. I think I'll cut down on the flour, use more eggs, and double the chocolate next time for more flavor and fluffiness.

This cake was absolutely amazing...so delicious I could have eaten the whole cake! Unfortunately, there were a couple of issues I had. The cake itself was dry, when it cooled, so I had to layer wet paper towels on it, until it moistened back up. I think maybe 30 min. cooktime would have been better. Also, even though I did add 1 extra square of white chocolate to the frosting, the icing was super pasty. As my mother, who decorated cakes for years, tried to ice the cake, it was taking the cake off with almost every stroke, and then just coming off in sheets. We ended up having to 'patch' the holes, because that was the only way it stayed on..kind of like playdoh. Maybe we didn't ice it soon enough after making the icing (it sat at room temp for 15 min or so). That being said...while it looked terrible- it tasted like a professional wedding cake...to die for... will work on the icing and reduce bake time next time.

The recipe was well written, and it was easier to make than I thought it would be.  I enjoyed making the cake, and it was beautiful, however, I was a bit dissappointed in the taste.  The cake was very sweet, and the almond flavor overtook the white chocolate.  The cake was also very dry.  It was a fabulous cake, very fancy and tasted professional.  The frosting was lovely, though very sweet and strongly almond flavored, the recipe was generous and I had plenty to frost the cake. Just make sure that you want a dry dense, sweet cake.

This cake was great! I was worried that the batter was somewhat thick, but it turned out nice and crumby and rich tasting. However, the Icing was !! The taste of the cake is subtle enough that it should not be taken away from by awful icing. Lovely cake, though.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday party, and it was a huge hit with the children and the adults. It had a good flavor and was quite moist. The almond and white chocolate flavors were not overpowering, but added enough to make it special. I did have a little trouble removing one of the layers from the pan, so I will try lining the bottom next time. This will definitely be my go-to white cake recipe from now on. Thanks for the delicious recipe.

This cake is tasty, it's heavy and a bit crumbly. Mine baked for about 30 minutes before it was done. The recipe recommended an hour so is definitely cut down on that. Also beating air into the eggs and cream seemed an unnecessary step. The batter was much to thick for that to have any carry over into the end product. It seems like you could cream the eggs and sugar together, add the chocolate then alternate flour and cream additions in 3 stages and have the same results without all the extra hoopla.
Also, I'd separate the batter into 3 8" pans if you're planning on layering it because it was pretty thick in just 2 pans. It may be better as 2 9" pans but each cake was nearing two inches tall when baked in the 2 8"pans
All in all I'd this was very tasty cake (I didn't make the frosting). It seemed like a shortcake to me. I wanted fresh strawberries to pair with it.

I am reviewing the frosting only.  I omitted the almond extract and used 1 cup of white chocolate chips.  It was probably too much chocolate, but the frosting was good.  It tasted just like white chocolate (which is what I wanted).  I was afraid it was going to set up/dry hard, but it was just fine.  If you are looking for a way to make frosting taste just like white chocolate, use this recipe.  Just make sure you frost the cake soon after you make it.  The chocolate makes it hard to spread when it's cool.

I haven't made this cake but am rating the recipe for the icing.  Excellent!  I used the icing on red velvet cupcakes and they were delicious.

I'll admit, this was a decent white cake but not worth all the extra work that went into it.  I honestly could not tell the difference between this and a regular white cake other than it was far too sweet.

I made this for my daughter's birthday cake. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using one ten inch pan instead of two 8 or 9 inch pans. It turned out great! It was super sweet and looked beautiful!

I made this for my Mother's birthday - it was a huge success.  Had a difficult time initially getting the snowflakes right on the first try - I ended up printing snowflakes on my printer then covering the page with waxed paper and piping them out.  Once hardened - I covered the entire cake.  I looked beautiful and was delicious!!

This is without a doubt the best cake I have ever put in my mouth!  I love white chocolate and this was amazing!  Do use the almond extract.  I read that some people just used vanilla. . .almond makes it POP!!!  I made it for my nieces wedding and it was a huge hit.  The flavor of the cake and icing are amazing!  I thickened the icing a bit to decorate with it.  I did make the mistake of refrigerating the icing so I had to let it return to room temperature again before I could do anything with it.

This has become my go-to birthday cake, so moist and delicious and rich.  Turns out amazing every time and is a hit with everyone.  The almond is subtle and a unique twist on a white cake.

I just made this cake for my daughter's birthday and the whole family loved it.  However-- it is more almond than white chocolate (which we actually loved, so that was good for us) and it does need some tweaking.  At 35 minutes the cake was over cooked.  The flavor was still amazing-- but dryer than I would have liked.  Next time I will start checking at 25 minutes.  Also, next time I will be adding a little oil for added moisture and doubling the chocolate so the chocolate to almond ratio is more even.  Lastly, I will be reducing the sugar in the cake.  With the frosting-- it is a little over sweet.  By reducing the sweet in the cake, I think it will balance a bit better.  All in all though, I will definitely use this recipe again.

Just tried this recipe and sadly it was a flop! Every thing went together perfectly and it looked great in the oven. I tried the suggestion of one reviewer to reduce cooking time to 30 minutes; tested and retested and it appeared done to perfection. But in less than the 10 minutes alloted to cool in the pan it dropped to half its size! Still looks nice and is held together, but I had planned to decorate extravagantly and take to a party this afternoon. It won't be worth the effort. Does anyone have an idea what might have gone wrong? Thanks!
Actually, I've just check it again and tried a piece. Not a good taste at all! It is much too heavy and somewhat greasy. Is the granulated sugar causing this? How did anyone get any lift in this cake!?

I made these to reveal to my son and his girlfriend the sex of their baby.  I cored out the center and added pink frosting.  ( A girl....Yeah) All the parents and step-parents were here and they were an absolute hit.  The entire batch was gone before they all left!
