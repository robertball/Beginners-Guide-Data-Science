I used reduced fat sour cream and homemade dry ranch dressing mix. I ran this dip through my food processor to get a uniform consistancy. My family thought this dip was delicious. We ate it all in one sitting.

Great recipe! I made it once as the recipe suggested and then a second time and used 8 oz. sour cream and 8 oz. cream cheese instead of the 16 oz. of sour cream that the recipe calls for. This was also good heated up.

Very good - but like another reviewer said - use 8 oz sour cream,8 oz cream cheese and drain the tomatoes for a less watery more creamy dip!

This is one of the most versatile and most sought after dessert at all my parties.  But you have to drain the Rotel, no question.  Also try using either the Spicy or fiesta ranch seasoning from Hidden Valley.  Also try changing up the Rotel, there are so many to choose from. Use chopped black olives instead of sliced, and add diced green onions just before serving.  No question, with these few changes, this is awesome!!!!

Great recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I do not like black olives at all and loved them in this dip.  It is also really good as a spread on bread and as a topping for tacos.

5 Stars!!  I did not have olives or ranch dip mix on hand; I used 8 ounces cream cheese, 8 ounces sour cream, a can of Rotel, 8 ounces shredded colby/jack cheese and a package of french onion dip mix.  This was awesome, super easy and a hit at our party!

This dip was good but after following the recipe the first time I made a few changes the next time I made it, I cut the sour cream in half and added 8 oz of cream cheese along with draining the tomato's.  I also used about 3 cups of cheddar and the whole package of ranch mix.  I baked it for 20 minutes at 350 and everyone liked it a lot more.  I was even giving the recipe out at the party we took it to.

This is one great starter dip.  I rate this high because as written it was a great dip.  I also added my own touches after tasting by adding garlic and cilantro and a little salt.  So great as written but as others have done, just added my own touches.  MMMMMMM good!

Everyone loved this dip!!  My only thing is it goes runny after awhile (might drain some juice off). Great flavor. I did add a little green onion (had it on hand). Will make again for sure!!

I followed recipe to the letter and found this to be very tasty. I prefer to have a thicker dip so I would either drain the tomato by 1/2 or follow other suggestions and add cream cheese. For more zest maybe some picante sauce to taste.

Love this dip!  We always double it, using sour creama and cream cheese. We also add a little salsa to give it extra flavor. Can't seem to watch football without it!

I had this for the first time when a friend brought this dip to a cookout and we enjoyed it. It is an easy and inexpensive dip that is perfect with vegetables, crackers or chips. We hate olives so I leave those out and add onions instead. I will try adding hot sauce, garlic powder, etc. to kick the flavor up a notch and maybe even heat it up so the cheese is melted. I think it would be even better that way! Note: She used the whole package of ranch seasoning and I do too. This might be helpful to those who complained of the dip becoming too runny. I wouldn't drain the Rotel tomatoes because you lose so much flavor that way!

For more flavor and better consistency, I have changed this over the years.  I now use 16 ounce sour cream and 8 ounces of cream cheese. That will help with the runny consistency.  Also, use taco flavored cheese and I add chopped green onions.  I always have a lot of flavor in mine.  If you want even more kick, use the fiesta flavored ranch dressing. That really spices it up.

Very easy and oh so good to make. I couldn't give the recipe 5 stars because I made one adjustment. I used 8 oz of cream cheese and 8 oz of sour cream like many others. Followed everything else. I wanted a thicker dip that would 'stand' up to being left out for a few hours. Since I didn't know what would taste best with the dip, I bought reduced fat Wheat Thins, white corn tortilla chips and baby carrots. All three tasted great! The dip ran out before I even had a chance to enjoy much of it. I even caught a co-worker fingering the sides of the bowl. Will make many more times!!

I have made this a couple of times.  The first time everyone liked it but it was a little runny.  The 2nd time I made it, I made a couple of changes.   Instead of the tomatoes with green chilis, I used fresh salsa because I had the salsa and not the tomatoes. I also drained the salsa  to solve the problem of being too runny. I  had fresh cilantro, so I chopped that and added it.  I felt that the flavor and consitancy were both improved.  I will definitely make this again.

I read the variations before making this and used what I had around the house.  This dip tastes much better than it looks.  I used 8oz neufchatel cheese, 8oz light sour cream, 1 cup white English cheddar finely shredded, 1 can rotel, 1/2 - 3/4 packet of Uncle Dan's ranch dressing dry mix, green onions and fresh garlic to taste.  This was a very easy recipe and quite the crowd pleaser.  Can be made with many variations to your liking.

This dip was a hit at our New Year's Eve party.  I was looking for something different to try and came across this recipe.  After reading some reviews I made the following changes:  Used 8 ounces sour cream and 8 ounces cream cheese.  Drained the Rotel tomatoes and used 2 cups of cheddar cheese.  I also used the entire package of dry ranch salad dressing.  I baked in the oven at 350 for 20 mins.  Next time I may even add some bacon pieces.  Will be making again.

this tasted fantastic and was great on baked potatoes and with pretzel crisps. my only issue was the runny texture. I added cream cheese and it was still runny. i wish I had followed suggestions and drained the rotel chile. But we ate it all and it was so good! thank you

Took this to work and everyone liked it... I added some chopped green onion to the top.. I had a 14.5oz can diced tomatoes that I partially drained, next time I will drain all the way this was a little runny. To thicken it up I added a little more cheese.

It's okay, but I doubt if I make it again. It tastes like ranch dip with a bit of a twang.

This dip is good!!  I used 16 oz sour cream and 8 oz cream cheese.  I adjusted the recipe accordingly with the exception if the rotel, and I added 2 drained cans.  Oh and I left out the olives but will definitely put them in next time because I know that they will work well in it.

I used one cup of sour cream and one cup of cream cheese. I used the whole package of shredded cheese (2 cups), did not drain the rotel and I used the whole package of ranch seasoning. I tried this baked for 20 minutes. I much prefer this room temperature or even cold.

I made this with 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz of sour cream. I used a whole packet of the ranch seasoning. I used probably 7 oz of black olives. I originally baked this for 20 minutes, but I much prefer it to be cold or room temperature.

I did as others & used 16 oz. sour cream, 8 oz. cream cheese and it gave it a nice consistency.  I did not use all the juice from the tomatoes.  I served it with crackers and carrot chips - the carrot chips went well with it.  I brought this as an appetizer to a Thanksgiving dinner, so with all the other food people didn't go crazy over it.  I'll try it again.

This is a nice chunky, ranch style dip. I thought I was going to eat it with tortilla chips, but I liked it better with potato chips. I drained the tomatoes a little and would drain even more next time.

I followed others remarks and used half cream cheese (room temp) and half sour cream and drained the rotel. It was ALL GONE!!! I also used 4 different types of cheeses not just cheddar and it was AMAZING! I topped with cilantro just because I love it. This will be a regular tailgate item!

I didn't use olives or ranch dressing mix. I then added bacon bits to add a little smokiness and it worked very well. The flavors blended very well, but if making it this way, add some salt and pepper.

This was a hit! I left out the black olives, included a small can on whole kernel corn and finely chopped about 2 T of jalapeno slices I had in the fridge. A cool dip for a summer outing.

We tried to liven this up after tasting with Tabasco, red pepper and other spices, but to no avail.  We tried both heated and chilled.  No one ate it after tasting.  Not bad, just not much flavor.
