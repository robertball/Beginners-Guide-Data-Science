We enjoyed this.  I did elect to omit the bread crumbs for half my chops because of gluten intolerance of one of my guests, but that didn't seem to affect how well this turned out.  My only other change was to add a minced clove of garlic to the sauerkraut onion mixture.  Thanks, Mrs Blizzard!

I have made this SEVERAL times! I love it so much that I make sure to get pork and sauerkraut in my groceries each month.( I especially like to eat it with homemade potatoes au gratin and some green beans.) Thank you for this recipe.

Reduced bread crumbs to 1 C, and used just 1 egg. Used pork loin chops, so only needed to bake for 1 hour at 300 degrees.

Pork chops were melt-in-your-mouth, and sauerkraut was perfect.  If I'd used bone-in chops, I'm sure it would have been more flavorful. Will definitely make this again, but will add a bit of seasoning..

I prepared this for my family’s dinner tonight with mashed potatoes and applesauce.  It received good reviews and I will prepare it again.
My only suggestions would be reduce the amount of bread crumbs, 2 cups is way too much.  1 Tbs. of cooking oil was not sufficient, so I doubled it and I added one tsp. of minced garlic when sautéing the sauerkraut, onions and caraway.  All in all, it was very easy to prepare, tasty and everyone was satisfied.

I made this for our good luck New Year's lunch with black-eyed peas and greens.  This was authentic German pork chops.  I didn't make any changes.  It was very flavorful, like the title!

Floured, egg/milk, bread crumbs.  These were really thick, huge chops.  Beyond perfect!  Must be the slow/low temperature.  Did leave them in an additional 15 minutes due to their size.  Used leftover sauerkraut from hot dog topping, this site.  To die for!

We are a big fan of the caraway seeds.  We add 6 ounces of beer for a broth content while serving along side mash potatos.  And this time we used sweet  Bavarian style kraut.

I’ve made these twice now and they were great both times!  Left out the caraway seeds as I didn’t have any and still great.

I made this for a recent Oktoberfest party and it was a hit.  I was worried about portion sizes since there was going to be a variety of German dishes there so instead of going with pork chops I went with pork country ribs.  I cut the meat away from the bone, then cut it into large "bite" size pieces and breaded them in seasoned breadcrumbs.  The only omission was the caraway seeds as I didn't have any.  The meat came out so juicy and tender.  Definitely worth a try.

Far too many bread crumbs I ended up wasting half of what was called for.  I added a little seasoning to the crumb mixture to add a little zip.  My husband loved it.  My picky grandchildren who do not like any vegetables loved the meat minus the sauerkraut

Tried this tonight for the first time and it was mouthwateringly delicious!! Left the caraway seeds out, because I'm not a fan of that flavor. My family loved it! Thank you for sharing. Will definitely make this again soon and often.

My sister actually made this recipe. She fried the pork chops in bacon grease instead of breading them. She used Bavarian style sauerkraut which is sweeter and already has caraway seed. She also added crumbled bacon on top of the sauerkraut and pick chops before putting in the oven. This came out pretty good. Thanks for the recipe:)

Succulent ,   I followed the recipe to a T, one minor adjustment.    I used 1 inch boneless pork chops. I dipped the 
 pork chops in the egg,  used  Panko breadcrumbs, redipped in egg  and pressed another layer of panko  breadcrumbs. And fried , then continued with recipe..   That is what I do when  I breadcrumb anything.

This is  great recipe!  I make dinners for my elder parents, and they just love this.  It is one of the easier and less expensive dinners too (which makes is even better)!  I don't freeze it, however, because the sauerkraut does not freeze well.  I made NO changes to the recipe.

This is the BEST pork chop recipe!! I've never had much luck with pork without it being dry. These turned out moist and juicy!
