These are delicious and very easy to make! I accidentally used regular champagne rather than pink champagne and they were still wonderful Thank you for creating this recipe!

I'd say this recipe is more impressive in its style than substance. It tastes a bit plain but definitely not bad. Just like a vanilla cupcake, but with that sweet champagne scent and cute pink coloring. Nice for picky eaters; I'm pretty sure the alcohol burns off in the oven so it may even be alright for underage.
