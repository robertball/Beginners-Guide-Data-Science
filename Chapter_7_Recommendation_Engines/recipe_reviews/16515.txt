Thank you, I've been looking everywhere for a perfect cauliflower recipe and with a few changes this one came close: added 1T. curry powder to milk mixture to enhance flavor, baked it rather than broil.  Furthermore, I made recipe even simpler by placing cauliflower UNCOOKED in a casserole dish, pouring the milk mixture over it and covering with tin foil.  I baked it covered with foil for 35 minutes at 350 degrees F.  Then removed the foil, spread the cracker/butter mixture over the top and baked for 30 more minutes.  Voila!

This is my great-grandmothers recipe.  She made it during the depression.  We love this recipe very much, but in the last few years have modified it a tad.  When we are making a quick batch we use a buttery cracker such as Ritz instead of saltines and butter.  Cuts the time and some of the fat. Hope you enjoy!

Did make some changes: used 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 c. sour cream; added garlic powder; and used half bread crumbs and half cracker crumbs. Have made this recipe with both broccoli and cauliflower, enjoyed it both ways.  Very good!

This is a keeper. I used frozen cauliflower, made the cheese sauce in the microwave, poured it over and because of the carbs, omitted the saltines. I baked it for 60 minutes at 350 along with my other dish of chicken. It was perfect. My son loved it. Next time I will double the recipie.

I agree with another reviewer that the mayonaise taste was surprisingly strong, but my husband RAVED about the flavor of the sauce, so I can't fault it even though mayo isn't my favorite thing.  I used cauliflower, broccoli, and a coarsely chopped and grilled sweet onion.  I omitted the breadcrumb topping as it just didn't seem to need it.  Oh, I also baked mine at 350 for one hour, as my casserole dish wasn't broiler safe.  It was just fine.

I tried this on company last night and everyone loved it!  My family was fighting over the leftovers today for their lunches!
I only wish it could be cut down so that it would be good for just the 4 of us. I will most assuredly make this again and again.

Too much mayonnaise and I love mayonnaise.  Will try again with 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup sour cream, adding some garlic powder, and using regular milk.

Cauliflower is my boyfriend's favorite vegetable, especially when it's paired with cheese. This was delicious! I cut the mayo in half to reduce the calories a little bit. The only change we would make next time is add in garlic and use bread crumbs instead of saltines.

I don't know what happen to the sauce. I was really looking forward to tasting it.  Followed the recipe except for using only 1/2 cup mayo. The sauce separated. I used carnation milk.  I am gong to try it again only this time I will heat the milk and not let it boil like the recipe says.

well, it was ok.....  got mixed reviews from my family, I actually thought it was worth eating so that is saying alot (I'm very picky).  My daughter that wanted me to make cauliflower, she had seen it in the store, liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the actual vegetable.   I was already planning on sub-ing sour cream for all of the mayo, but I didn't have enough sour cream soooo, I tossed in some cream cheese (I'm not big on mayo).  It was very nice and creamy.  I sprinkled in a little garlic and onion powder, and then topped it all with a few dashes of paprika for color.

Such a wonderful recipe! I made it for Christmas dinner and once after for friends and it had great reviews! I didn't change anything but the topping, using Ritz crackers instead. I will make again!

I made changes to the recipe after realizing that I did not have mayo on hand. So I mixed a can of fat free evaporated milk with 1 can of reduced fat cream of chicken soup with 1/2 cup reduced fat sour cream on the stove until heated through. I added garlic powder, paprika, black pepper and a bit of ground mustard and thyme. I took it off the stove and added 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar and 1/3 cup reduced fat parmesean. I had thawed and drained 1 (16 oz) bag of frozen cauliflower (which I chopped a bit into smaller pieces) and 8 oz frozen broccoli. I threw in 1 (12.5 oz)can of chunk chicken breast. To the veggies and chicken, I added the sauce, mixed well and then poured into a 9 x 13 baking dish. For the topping, I melted 1/4 cup butter and mixed in 1/2 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs some more reduced fat grated parmesean. I baked for 1 hour at 350. This dish, although mostly using reduced fat ingredients, was very savory and rich tasting. Very good and inexpensive to make!

This was one of the best vegetable casseroles we have ever had!  The sauce was incredibly creamy.  It tasted amazing.  I made it with a frozen vegetable Normandy mix and used 2 cups of colby jack. My fiance raved about it.  He even gave up seconds on the meat for more casserole!

I took one reviewer's suggestion and used half mayonnaise/half sour cream. I added a squirt of dijon mustard and a dash hot sauce to the sauce and sprinkled a little parmesan cheese over the casserole before baking. My family LOVED this casserole, they all asked me to make this again really soon. Next time, I'm going to try this with half broccoli.

This is a favorite but I changed it up some.  First: I couldn't bring myself to use 1 cup of mayo so I use 1 cup fat-free cottage cheese.  I use fat-free evap milk.  Also, I tend to make this when I have leftover cornbread; this last time I melted 1/4 cup butter and mixed it with two 2x2 squares of cornbread as the topping.   THANKS!

I followed the recipe as written and it was good.  However, I think the next time I will partiallysteam the cauliflower and then put the sauce on and cover it with foil and cook for 20-30 minutes and then put the crackers crumbs on top and put in the broiler.  That way I think the flavors have a chance to 'marry'.  Overall I thought it had good flavor, and will make again.

I have been looking for this recipe ever since we left England where I first tasted this wonderful dish!  This is exactly as I remember it, and I wouldn't change a thing.  The cheese, mayo and evaporated milk were a perfect mix, and it came out so creamy and delicious.  I equated 4 ounces of crackers as one sleeve from the box, but next time I think I will only use about half that many, and cut the amount of butter appropriately. I made this for Easter dinner and my guests loved it, and requested the recipe.  Thank you so much Nany for this fabulous recipe!

Excellent!  Next time I will add a little bit more cheese to the sauce per my son's request.  I did bake this instead of broiling because I was afraid the heat from my broiler would harm my dish.  If baking, I suggest you just steam the cauliflower to tender crisp instead of fully cooking it.

Loved It!! It reminds me of something i cannot put my finger on...something I love. I listened to the advice of others and substituted 1/2 of the mayo with sour cream and substituted the crackers and butter with ritz crumbs. baked in the oven for 30 min covered without the crumbs and then for another 30 with uncovered. It was delicious!

The sauce was bland & had too much mayo.  I added additional cheese, which helped with the mayo taste, but it was still sub par.

This was great! I had a lot of leftover cauliflower so this recipe was perfect for that. My husband doesnt really like cauliflower but he was grabbing seconds of this dish. This recipe is definately going in my recipe book!

The perfect recipe to try out our first cauliflower from our winter garden.  I mixed broccoli and cauliflower and steamed it.  I did 1/2 mayo 1/2 ranch flavored sour cream (about 3 heaping tbsps. each), a few small chunks of velveeta cheese and sprinkled with saltines (no butter).  It was awesome!

I really liked this recipe. I did make the changes that others suggested and also because I didn't have the cheddar cheese I used velveeta. It was really good using 1/2 of the mayo, regular milk instead of evaporated, and velveeta. This was taken to a church carry in and everyone liked it.
Thanks for the great recipe!

OOOOOOOHhhh this was so good!  The sauce was not at all what I expected - I expected it to be much more liquidy... but it was 'fluffy' - very light and airy.  I followed the recipe adding only a little seasoning to the crumbs (garlic powder, onion powder and pepper).  The head of cauliflower that I used was sorta small (i also used a smaller pan b/c 9X13 would've been WAY too big) - so I added some leftover green/yellow zucchini that had been sliced and sauteed with fresh garlic.  The mixture was deeeeelishhhhh!!!!

Wow!  This got an instant "mmm... that's good" from DH.  I only used about a quarter cup mayo cos that is all we had left but it was more than enough if not still a little too much.  I did only make enough for the 2 of us though so it probably worked out right.  I used regular milk too cos I didn't want to open a can of evaporated milk for only half of it.  Used lots of crackers as I used what was left in the packet.  I put it in the oven as something else was cooking in there so put it with it.  Worked out perfect.  If I don't have crackers in future I will use potatoe chips/crisps.  Just crush a bunch of them.  Flavoured ones like Salt & vinegar would go nice especially if you are having fish or something with it.  So will make this again for sure.  Thanks!

I made this as a side for Thanksgiving dinner. I thought it was pretty good, my husband wasn't to happy with it, and no one else really ate it. I would make it again for a holiday dish though.

If you don't like mayo, don't try this recipe.  I don't particularly care for it and unfortunately it was the only thing I could taste in the sauce even after I added another cup of cheese.  The cauliflower part was good, though!

I really liked the flavors in this dish. Now next time I make this I will add some kind of thickener because it was way too runny. But delicious, was a hit at Easter.

This was not our cup of tea. Too salty with the mayo, cheese, crackers, and butter. And the evaporated milk gives it a sweetness that didn't complement the taste of cauliflower. Not going to repeat.

This was okay.  I thought it was pretty bland though.  I'd probably add some seasonings or something to it to perk it up a bit.

We read other reviews first, and added sauteed onion and garlic, garlic powder and sliced sauteed sausage. We thought it was awesome! There was some water in the bottom of the pan, but the sauce didnt separate. I think it was because the cauliflower had been frozen so there was a bit more liquid in it.

This is really a great recipe, so versatile that you can tweak it quite easily to suit your individual taste. I used fat free evap milk & it didn't take away from the flavor at all. I did add a little curry, salt & pepper for taste but I always pep up seasonings because we like a stronger flavor in our dishes. I also used roasted veggie ritz because that's what I happened to have in the pantry & I really think it added a great flavor to the dish. I baked mine also at 375 & it was perfect. Thanks so much for the recipe, it will definitely be a keeper for us!

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time, I didn't have canned milk, so I used regular milk.  I had a runny sauce, but it was still very good.  This time, I had the correct ingredients, but I took the advice of another reviewer and added curry powder (1-1/2 tsp. rather than the reviewer's recommended 1 T).   I steam the cauliflower until it's crisp-tender, then baked it (covered) in a 350-degree oven for about 25 minutes, and another 5 or 10 uncovered. It really is very tasty.  I used Ritz buttery crackers and cut the butter in half.  I also add some canned French Fried Onions to the cracker mixture, and it adds excellent flavor.  We love this dish !!

My family really liked this recipe-even the baby had two helpings! I used light mayonaisse, homemade bread crumbs-didn't measure just sprinkled some on top and then dotted with just 2 tablespoons of butter to create a healthier version. It was still very yummy. I did add salt and pepper once it was on my plate so next time I would probably add that to the sauce-but we will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but the taste of the mayo was a bit overwhelming.  I'm anxious to try it again with low fat sourcream instead of mayo. Also, I will add tabasco to the cheese sause. It was very good though. Would make again!

I used light sour cream in place of 3/4 of the mayo and low fat evap milk.  I added garlic, a little whole grain mustard and hot sauce. Overall it was very good. Next time I may try adding some curry powder.  It's really an adaptable recipe. I haven't cooked much w/ evap milk but I think it really made it creamy.
Think I would like it w/ panko topping better.  The saltines just didn't thrill me

Soooo good! I used half a cup fat-free sour cream and half a cup light mayo. I used crushed buttery crackers on top, skipped the butter. I also baked it in the oven at 400 for about 45 minutes, since I had something else in the oven and didn't want to cook them separately. Obviously it's a very forgiving recipe with all of the changes! It was so good!

Wow I never thought I would crave cauliflower, this recipe is amazing I will be making this for thanksgiving.  The cheese sauce is so good and so easy I will never buy mac and cheese again, my son loves this new mac and cheese and the flavor is so strong I can hide vegetable puree's in the sauce.  Thank you for posting

I thought this was good and very easy to make, but I also thought it really needed some salt and pepper!  I used regular milk and cut the mayo in half, like others suggested, so maybe that's why it seemed a bit bland to me. I didn't add sour cream in place of the mayo. I just left it at the milk and half cup of mayo.  I baked it for about half an hour at 375 and it turned out great, consistency-wise.  The only thing I would do differently next time is add a teaspoon of salt and half t. of pepper. Otherwise, a great way to get the kids to eat cauliflower!

I loved this...but didn't follow the recipe exactly (didn't have the required ingredients on hand) My substitutions:

- I used 2 bags of frozen cauliflower florets...stuck them in the microwave just to take the chill off
- I used 3/4 c heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk
- I used 1/2 c cheddar and 1/2 cup mozzarella

It was really tasty (even with the mayo; didn't know how that was going to change the taste of a cheese sauce) ....I might even make this cheese sauce for other stuff!

Absolutely delicious!  I made it just as written and the casserole was creamy, cheesy and just fantastic.  It reminded me of a cheesy potato casserole that is a favorite in our home.  Definitely a keeper!

I loved how creamy it was. Although, it seemed a little runny the first night. I re-heated it the next day, and it was just the right consistency.

This didn't taste how I expected but was delicious.  What others said about the mayonaise flavor really coming through was true.  I will use about 1/2 cup next time.  I also crushed potato chips on top since I was out of crackers.

Fabulous! Easiest cheese sauce ever. I halved the amount of cracker crumbs and doubled the cheese.

This is a realy good casserole.  Just be sure to watch it closely under the broiler as it tends to burn easily.

This was really good with some changes. I used 1 cup of half 1% milk and half 1/2&1/2 in place of the condensed milk. I used 3/4 cup fat free Greek yogurt instead of Mayo cause we don't like Mayo much. Plus these changes made it a bit healthier. I also used sharp cheddar, mozzarella & a little parmesan. For a total of almost two cups of cheese. The cauliflower head I used was very large. Last thing I did was half the butter and used all panko bread crumbs which were delicious. The kids ate it up, even my 3 year old non veggie eater ate seconds. Yea!

I made this as a side for Christmas dinner and it was loved by all. It was very easy to make too.  I followed other reviewer's advice and used a 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of (fat-free) sour cream. I added garlic powder (about a tablespoon). And I used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers.  Next time I'm going to use half bread crumbs and half panko chips, just to add a little crunch.  I tried to bake at 350 degrees, but it took forever and didn't brown the bread crumbs very well.  I think broiling for a bit to melt the cheese and brown the top is all that's needed.  This has definitely become one of my goto sides for extended family dinners.  Thanks!

After reading the reviews, I tried to incorporate everyone's hints.  I cut the mayo to 1/2 a cup of lite mayo and added a 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream.  Also added a teaspoon of mustard and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper.  Baked this in the oven uncovered for 20 minutes and then added the crackers for another 20 minutes.  Just before serving I turned on broil to make sure the crackers were brown and crunchy. Sauce was very creamy.   I think next time I will add another 1/2 cup of cheese for a stronger taste.

I read all the other reviews and cooked raw cauliflower and broccoli mixed, with some added  bacon bits. I also added garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper to the sauce. I did use 1/2 mayo and sour cream instead of all that mayo. Poured the cheese sauce  over the top of veggies and bacon. Cooked for 40 minutes covered on 350 then added the buttered cracker crumbs and cooked for another 20 minutes uncovered. This turned out great!

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was a big hit!  Of course, I tweaked the recipe a bit:  - I used a broccoli crown and some baby carrots in addition to a small cauliflower head because I wanted more veggies.   - I used 1/2 cup mayo (because I'm not a huge fan), and I doubled the cheddar (because I love cheese). - I also used cheddar fried onions instead of crackers, and I omitted the butter because they're already pretty greasy.

This was very good but it seemed like it could have used a bit more spice, although I'm not sure which.  I did add some garlic powder.  Maybe some cayenne to kick it up.  But all in all, I was pleased with this recipes.  Thanks

So good!  I wasn't sure about how the mayo would taste but it all came together so well!  I used about 1/2c light mayo (because 1c seemed like an awful lot) and reduced fat Ritz crackers instead of Saltines (since I was all out).  I also cut down the butter a bit and it was delicious!  The kids loved it!  Great base recipe!

I really liked this recipe. I did not think that the mayo taste was too strong, but I did add a little more cheese than the recipe says so that might have taken away from the mayo taste. Overall, it was very good!

This is by far the best cauliflower casserole I have ever had. My husband was still raving about it hours after dinner. I altered the recipe a bit, using half as much mayo and bread crumbs instead of saltines. The sauce was very light and smooth. Delicious!

I made a changes: I didn't have canned milk in my cupboard. =( I used 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream and water to make 1 cup.  I also didn't have saltines, but had whole wheat cheese (fish) crackers so that is what I used and just 1/2 the butter called for; it did not need the whole cube. I did take the advice of one reviewer and baked it in the oven covered with foil for 35 min and then uncovered with the crackers on top for an additional 30 min.  Both my husband and I loved it. Will make it again and again. Thanks.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now, and I love it!  I'm asked to bring it to most family events.  I've tried other recipes and always come back to this one.  A few additions I've made from trying other recipes is, i'll add some Parmesan cheese, and a little Dijon mustard. Instead of a whole cup of Mayonnaise, I use 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream

Outstanding with no changes! Next time I am going to double it so we have leftovers! Great way to get veggies into my son who refuses to eat them. We called it cheesy bake and he even had seconds.

Mouth watering, tasty and filling! I used Monterey Jack cheese instead of cheddar. Added some Parmesan cheese to the crackers/butter mixture. Will definitely make this again.

Delish. A great way to serve cauliflower as a rich, creamy side. I used whole wheat Ritz crackers instead of saltine, 2% milk rather than evaporated milk, about half cup of cheese, and threw in a tablespoon of ranch dressing for some tang. Then I promptly scorched it under the broiler, so, I'm thinking to bake it a little at 450 next time, then a very light quick broil to brown.

This was good. I did as some of the others and did not steam my cauliflower, just baked it covered with the sauce for 30 min and then put the crackers on top and backed another 30 min at 350. It needed some more flavor. Next time I will add some more spices. Maybe some dry ranch seasoning. My 2 year old loved it!! He has two helpings!

I didn't really care for this.  It was a little bland and the cheese wasn't really creamy.  Don't think we'll do it again.

I gave it 3 stars because it was just too mayonaiseeee for my taste. It did taste good, but I probably won't make it again.

The flavor was fairly bland. Needs more seasoning.
