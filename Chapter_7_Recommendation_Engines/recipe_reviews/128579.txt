To make them really spicy and a little more flavorful, I added chili powder, cayenne, paprika and a touch of cumin to the garlic powder and salt mixture.

I make these every year from the pumpkin we carve as a family.  They are delicious.  My only change is I use enough veggie oil to coat the seeds and swirl them around in it. (In place of butter)  I only wish our pumpkins yielded more seeds!!  These go fast!

I made this recipe yesterday.  Too much butter.  All the spices slid off the seeds along with the butter.  The seeds themselves came out ok but very plain as none of the spices stayed on the seeds.  I would recommend 1/2 the butter.

I will cut back on the salt next time but these have a great flavor.  Oh, definitely half the butter like the first person said!

I only had about 2 cups of pumpkin seeds.  I cut the butter to 2 tsp (I find that it only needs about 1 tsp per cup usually) and the seasoned salt to 1 1/2 tsp but kept the garlic powder the same.  I did not add regular salt, I didn't think it was necessary.  I checked at 45 min and they were done and did not need further cooking.  We thought these were good, but not the best we have ever made.  I might add more garlic powder next time (my husband is a big garlic fan).

Guess I'm not a pumpkin seed fan.  While the flavor was great, I do not like the way you have to chew and chew and chew to swallow these things.  Someone else said (not sure if it was a review here or on another recipe) it reminded them of eating the shell of a sunflower seed.  Exactly!    However, if you LIKE pumpkin seeds this has excellent taste and flavor!!

My 16 yr. old daughter made these and added spicy cajun seasoning.  They turned out good and crunchy.

These Spicy Pumpkin seeds were absolutely amazing. My father, who loves spicy food, went crazy for them. I had them for about a week and munched away before bed. I didnt wash the pumpkin seeds to keep maximum pumpkin flavor.

Instead of using butter I tossed the seeds in olive oil and mixed in Mrs. Dash Onion blend and salt.   They came out so good I could not stop eating them.

Thanks for the tips, I used 1/2 the butter.  But wanted very spicy seeds so used 3-4 Tsp of Tony Chacheries Creole Seasoning, that already has salt, instead of the mixtures mentioned, I also added 1 Tbl of Franks Red Hot.  As I stirred them, I added a little more seasoning, just to make sure they were eveny coated.  Absolutely delicious and spicy, just they way we love them.  BTW i used the seeds of 2 pumpkins (medium) to get about 3 cups of seeds.

Yum, these are delish!  I did about 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c olive oil -- I find the olive oil helps keep everything from burning when it's in there for so long!

I loved this recipe, but changed up the spices.  I used Old Bay seasoning, because in my family we think Old Bay makes everything better.  I also used half the amount of butter and then drained the excess off before putting them on the baking sheet...cook time and temp was spot on!

As others have stated, this needs a bit more spice. I am not sure why they are called "Spicy" Pumkin Sees. I added spice and they are great! I added a 1/4 TSP of Paprika and 1/4 TSP of Old Bay. And a drop of Mad Dog, perfect!

I wouldn't call these spicy at all, maybe savory but not spicy.  They were good, but mine didn't need an hour in the oven about 45 minutes would have been plenty.  These would be good with a dash of spice...maybe a pinh of cayene pepper would be a nice spice to add.

Hit the spot.  I only got 1 1/2 cups of seeds from my pumpkin so I cut the recipe in half.  These seeds are tasty and boy does my kitchen smell good.

I'm going to clue you in on something: These aren't spicy. Not even a little bit. Seasoning salt is not spicy. Felt mislead by the recipe title. These are literally just seasoned pumpkin seeds. Absolute waste of time if you want something spicy.

Turned out great and super easy! I was looking for something simple and kid-friendly as I am making them for my pre-K class to try. I didn't have a Seasoned Salt on hand so I substituted with a Poultry Seasoning blend that included garlic, onion, salt and herbs. I just put that in place of the seasoned salt and left everything else the same. They smell delicious, look great and taste good! I'm excited for the children to try them tomorrow!

Overall, I thought they turned out pretty well. Although, as my family pointed, the recipe does not need the extra salt. I would recommend using only the butter, garlic powder and seasoning salt (I also added some greek seasoning). Despite that they are really tasty, I can't stop eating them.

I used a light canola oil instead of butter, then salt, garlic salt, and cayenne pepper.  Yum!

I wouldn’t call these seeds spicy, more salty, but they were still very good.  I followed the other reviewers’ suggestions of using half the amount of butter, but other than that followed the recipe.  Next time I would omit the salt.  Using a cookie spatula was perfect for spreading the seeds evenly on the baking sheet.

Very good! Just a bit too salty for me. I'll use half the amount of salt next time...

These are delicious and addictive. They are not, however, what most people would call spicy. They are salty, which is great for us, as we like salt, but might be too much for some. Used 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup, and it was sufficient. Thanks!

Made these for the first time yesterday....OMG!!! SO GOOD!! I listened to other reviews, used half the butter, added just onion powder & paprika. They were so much tastier than how I've made them for years...so glad I found this recipe!! Oh...oven @ 300 only took about an hour for me. Just a heads up.
