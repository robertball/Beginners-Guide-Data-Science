Yes, it can be bland, but coconut milk can be like that. I added; 4 minced cloves of garlic, 2 tsp of low sodium Chicken broth powder, 4 whole dried red peppers. It all worked out. You know not to mess with the rice after it starts to boil, and after let it cool so it won't be sticky or to moist. Served with thin sliced Chicken and saut√©ed veggies in a light lemon pepper marinade. Good stuff Kim.

Even though this sounds exotic with the coconut milk, it's bland.

My 5 star is based off my version of this recipe.  I do not have a good pot for cooking rice so I microwaved mine.   I used brown rice instead of jasmine and used the directions for the brown rice to liquid ratio for microwaves.  I used 1 cup rice, 2 cups light coconut milk(didnt want to waste a half can of coconut milk so i used the entire can), 1 cup water, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1 tsp brown sugar.  All other ingredients were exact.  Cooked mine for 10 mins full power, then 20 mins 50% power in an uncovered 2 quart baking dish.  I thought it turned out great. I was looking for Rumbi rice from the Rumbi resturant chain and this came out really close.  I would say the salt and sugar is needed for this recipe but it just depends on how you like your rice.

Yum! This recipe reminds me a little of the black beans and rice I used to order at Bridgetown Grill in Atlanta, Ga. Thanks for posting it I will use this recipe over and over again.

This was incredibly delicious and quick and easy to prepare.  I added a tsp sugar, some fish sauce, celery, thyme, garlic, salt and pepper, as well as some chicken.  Also used the full can of coconut milk with some chicken broth.

In order to get that great flavor u must cook the coconut milk for 45 mins first. I'm from the caribean. I made this small change  to the recipe added, salt, escallion, garlic (crushed), butter and thyme. Cook this for an additional 5 mins. while cooking the coconut milk u must add water. It was delicious..

I'm not sure what the original recipe tastes like because I took liberty with it based on the reviews and on my own creativity. The version I came up with was awesome though! 

I made the following modifications:
I doubled the recipe for a dinner party; in place of the butter I used 1 T of stick margarine and 1 T virgin coconut oil (it is a coconut dish after all)

In place of the shallot (just didn't have one) I used a small onion, also a tsp of minced garlic (the refrigerated kind in a jar)

I used plain old long grain rice--I'm sure Jasmine would be awesome, just didn't have any

Used the whole can of coconut milk

Used two cups of chicken broth in place of the water (freshly made)

I was generous with the nutmeg--two full pinches and probably 1 1/2 more or so

Then I also threw in about a T of brown sugar, and additional T of coconut oil, a handful of shredded sweetened coconut and a pinch or two of sea salt

Then, I used only one can of black beans and that seemed plenty for me, but more would be fine too

Could have used a bit more salt, but not much.

Following an earlier recommendation, I added garlic to the recipe and it totally worked wonders. I substituted the butter with canola oil and the nutmeg with cinnamon which I've got to say made all the difference. My boyfriend could not stop eating this dish,have to make it again and again!

Similar to Rumbi Rice. Great with grilled chicken and steamed veggies in a bowl.

I had kidney beans and I used chicken stock instead of plain water and the entire can of coconut milk. If you don't have shallots use a cup of diced onion. I like a well seasoned dish so I added kosher salt, a cup of sliced celery hearts and a large clove of garlic sauteed along with the onion,a teaspoon of sugar and a scattering of fresh rosemary and oregano. My folks mowed this down- I am still staring with utter shock at the empty pot.

I am a fan of good, white rice. Others may consider this bland, but I would say "subtle flavors". Very, very pleasant dish! Next time I might double the scallions, though.

This was a nice, easy side dish.  I did add S&P like people suggested.  I used a little less water and a little more coconut milk, less butter and added garlic and mixed in a bunch of green onion at the very end.

This recipe probably is very bland when made exactly as stated,but if you think of it as a base recipe and adjust to your spice preferences, it's a great start.  I added chopped garlic, tumeric for color (because I don't like grey food) and ground chilli for spice.

I used this recipe to try to make Rumbi rice. I added a little sugar to the rice while it was cooking then added grilled chicken and teriyaki sauce with the black beans. It was very yummy!

I thought this was okay when I followed the recipe.  I took some suggestions from the reviews. I used more coconut milk, less water, some chicken bouillon, minced garlic, and salt and pepper.  My husband and I were not displeased but it was not our favorite thing ever.  A few days later, I decided to use up the leftovers, but I wanted to work with some new flavors.  I heated a little olive oil in a fry pan and sauteed 2 cloves of garlic for a bit.  Next, I added a small can of green chiles, 1 tsp cumin, and more salt and pepper.  After heating that through I added the leftover rice and beans.  I had a little bit of pork roast leftovers as well so i chopped it into bite sizes and threw it in and cooked over medium heat until it was all heated through. We loved it! The green chiles broadened the flavor but kept that subtle sweetness that I liked about the recipe.

A tasty quick dish with easy ingredients.  I read the other reviews and used a whole can of coconut milk (didn't want to waste the other half) and about half a cup of water, plus I added a few cloves of garlic, a couple of pinches of brown sugar, pepper, salt, cinnamon, and onion powder (didn't have any shallots or onions, actually. I know, lame!) Made this before midnight after a long day and it was filling.

Good recipe.  I added pumpkin pie spice, salt, crushed red pepper flakes, and a little bit of black pepper.  Delicious.  I might even add a habenero pepper next time for more of a kick.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it's so flexible, and because the other commenters' suggestions have been so great. In fact, making this for the second time I amalgamated almost all of the suggestions--added garlic to the shallots, used the whole can of coconut milk, plus about another quarter cup of water. Added 1-2 tsps of chicken bullion (vegetarian--McKaye's ftw!), added a small dash of nutmeg, a larger dash of cinammon, a dash of thyme, and salt and pepper. Amazing.

I made a few changes - I used all coconut milk instead of water, which made the rice very creamy; substituted onion for the shallot b/c I didn't have one on hand; and added salt for a little more flavor. Overall, it is very good and I make it again.

Everyone, even my young teenagers, enjoyed this. I used shallots, because that is what I had, and the entire can of coconut milk instead of using the water, forgot the nutmeg - will have to remember it next time.  The jasmine rice really is flavorful on its own - might need to add more spices of your liking if you are using plain white rice.

I thought it was wonderful without any changes to the original recipe. Used 3 TBS cream of coconut with 3/4 water to replace the coconut milk (that was all I coud find at the store). I will make many times ! Thanks for the easy recipe!

Sounds a lot more interesting than it actually is -- I ended up with a kind of tasteless glop, but maybe that's just my cooking skills.  Maybe some feta would help?

I was slightly disappointed with the finished product. I added some chicken stock as suggest by many others instead of the water, and also added the entire can of coconut milk. I added extra nutmeg and a pinch of cumin because I felt it was bland. I also felt it needed a large amount of salt added at the end. I also increased to 2 shallots instead of a 1/2. I would try this recipe again but would add some garlic and something else to give it a kick!

This dish was bland, it needs something else to waken up the flavor.  I would have to tweak the recipe if I made it again.

Really nice, easy recipe! I made it as is, and it was a lovel complement to the more complicated dish with which it was served. Yes, perhaps slightly bland, but it worked really well with the flavors of main dish without competing or overpowering. It could easily be jazzed up with whatever you want‚Äîgarlic, more spices, more chopped veggies, even add meat or other protein to make it a meal of its own, but then it becomes a whole new recipe. . .

If you're looking for an easy rice dish (that appears to be more "fancy" than just plain ol' rice! Impress your friends!) to complement a Mexican or even Middle Eastern entree, or as a base to build on for a stand-alone main dish, this one works simply, beautifully! Thanks for sharing!

This was the first time I've used jasmine rice and I enjoyed it.  SO much better than the brown rice that I use but don't really like.  Like other reviews have said, the dish doesn't taste strongly of coconut but it gives it a rich taste, some depth to the rice.  I used green onions instead of shallots since I didn't have shallots.  Still good.  I also put in salt and sugar as other reviewers suggested.  My small kids didn't appreciate it as much as I hoped but they enjoyed tasting the coconut milk when I was making it so next time I think I'll stir in some coconut milk to coat it when it'd done cooking and hopefully they'll like it more.  I've been wanting to add beans and rice to our menu more and was pleasantly surprised as to how full I felt after eating just one bowl.

I made this with brown rice and added garlic, salt, and pepper while it was cooking.  It was still a little bland so we topped it with shredded coconut when serving and my kids liked it.

With a few extras, it turned out nicely!  The recipe definitely needs salt, and I added garlic and pepper.  I cooked the beans separately, and used an entire red onion which added a lot of flavor.  Next time I'll try a bouillon cube and some cumin.

I made it like the recipe; I chopped a white onion instead because I didn't have a shallot and it turned out good. A little plain for my taste so I layered some leftover homemade chicken gravy over it and it tasted delicious.

This is my first time ! I usually make black beans and rice separately , cook beans then rice and put it together and then enjoy it but the nutmeg intrigued me as well as coconut milk. I was always afraid I would mess it up. Came out very nice I used allspice instead of nutmeg and salt and pepper to finish but this recipe gave me the courage to branch out of the norm!

Good but a little bland, made some changes. I was out of black beans so we substituted pinto beans. I would have preferred the black beans but still good. I used coconut oil instead of  butter and Silk coconut milk instead the canned shelf type. I added fresh cilantro, jalapenos and orange bell pepper. This is worth making again.

Used lite coconut milk, vegetable broth in place of water, and since I had no nutmeg, a pinch of all-spice.  It has a slight sweetness and creaminess to it. Very easy and tasty.  Vegetarian teenage daughter liked it!

This dish will become a staple in our home. Instead of using a shallot, I sprinkled in some garlic salt. Also used chicken broth in place of water. I baked my rice in the oven using a covered casserole dish at 400 degrees for about 30 mins.... checked on it several times and stirred while baking.

As is, it is extremely bland. Add a few cloves of garlic, and you will get a 4 star recipe. Great side dish for jerk chicken.

Made with onion and green onion, instead of shallots. Flavor and especially the aroma reminded me of some Thai curries I've had. It was okay, flavor-wise, just not my style. I adjusted how I cooked the dish after the rice was added to be closer to my usual routine for cooking jasmine rice, which turned out well for me.

I love this recipe although I tweak it - I usually double it and add a whole can of coconut milk and less water.  Then I add a tad extra nutmeg and along with the beans a half bag of precooked pork sausage crumbles.  This makes it filling enough to use as a main dish.  I consider it my go-to comfort food!

I really liked this, the rest of my crew said, "unusual."  You do need to add some flavoring and play around with it a bit.  I added garlic, salt, cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  I used 2.5 cups of rice a whole can of coconut milk and 2 cups of water and just kept adding water as it cooked.  it was hard to get the rice soft.  but I loved the flavor of the dish.  served with pineapple grilled pork chops.  I think it will be great heated up for lunch as leftovers, maybe with some avocado?  can't wait.

Amazing! But you need to salt the coconut water to taste before you simmer it covered. Always taste your water because that will be the flavor of your rice.  It needs at least a teaspoon per cup of rice.

This is a delicious meatless meal. It's almost too good with the addition of some salt, garlic and turmeric, as other reviewers have suggested. This will be made many more times.

Definitely a side dish. The texture is nice and creamy and the flavor is good, but I found it very subtle. Overall, I'd call this recipe "just ok." I added salt and cinnamon and used the full can of coconut milk. Will enjoy the second half as dinner.

Used other reviewer's advice and added a two cloves of minced garlic and a bit of thyme to rice before cooking.  Very good, flavorful side dish.

Tasted great. I added grated garlic, red onion, green bell peppers and a chicken cube. I also used brown rice instead. I followed the method and the rice was "mushy" so maybe its my pot. Maybe I'll try it again and hopefully get it right.

This was a pretty good & quick side dish- made me think of food we ate in Costa Rica, light and fresh!  It went really well with the basil & lime shrimp we had!

I used instant brow rice as I was running short on time and it was still good. I also used lite coconut milk, I think next time I will use 1 cup lite coconut milk and 3/4 cup of water.

I added a little bit of brown sugar to give it more of a sweet flavor.  Next time I will add more coconut milk to make the rice less dry and a little creamier.

This was a wonderful dish.  I used red onion, chopped garlic, quick cooking brown rice, chicken broth (instead of water), salt and pepper.  My husband loved it too.

This recipe is a little bland but I still enjoyed it. It tasted like a comfort food to me. It does need salt and sugar works well with it.

I thought this was a bit bland - and it could have gone either a little more sweet, or a little more salty.

I rated it only 4 stars because I made some additions as suggested by other reviewers: garlic, thyme and chicken bouillon. To the leftovers the following day, I added chopped and cooked onions, celery and chicken. Yum!
