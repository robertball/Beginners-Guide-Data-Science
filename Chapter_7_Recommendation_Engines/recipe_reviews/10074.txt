These were SO GOOD! I followed some other suggestions and here's what I ended up using: 2/3 cup canola oil; 1/2 cup white sugar; 1/2 cup brown sugar; 1 egg; 1/4 cup molasses; 1 cup all-purpose flour; 1 cup whole wheat flour; 2 t. baking soda; 1/4 t. salt; 1 t. ground cinnamon; 1 heaping t. ground ginger; 1 t. vanilla; 1/2 heaping t. ground cloves; 1/3 cup sugar (for rolling dough balls).

I baked them for 10 minutes. They turned out perfectly. This is definitely going in my recipe box!!!

These are the BEST molasses cookies ever!  I like them better then any store bought or bakery bought molasses cookies that I have tried.  The key to making these soft and chewy in the middle is to cool them on wax paper rather then a cooling rack.  Cooling them on a rack allows cold air to circulate around and through the cookie as it cools, which causes them to become crunchy.  If you cool on wax paper no air gets THROUGH the cookie so they stay warm longer and doughy inside.  This tip works well for Chocolate chip and sugar cookies too. Try these, they are wonderful!!!

I've made a few cookies that have oil in the recipe, but none like this!  These were fabulous and present so beautifully w/the crackled top.  Used 1/2 c. each of brown and white sugar.  Added some vanilla and 1/2 tsp. salt.  I like things very spicy, and although I used slightly heaping measurements of the spices, I didn't double them and they were perfect and in the right proportions.  These somehow have a buttery taste to them.  soft but not a cakey cookie, crisp around the edges, the molasses flavor comes through nicely and is not covered up by spice.  you can tell the molasses is in there.  thanks so much for this wonderful recipe when one doesn't have enough butter or shortening. I should add that I have found in the past that a cookie made w/oil will tend to get a bit hard or crisp by the next day.  Just stick a slice of bread in the cookie jar to keep them soft.

First batch, pretty good, but second batch (with alterations) -- Delicious! I decreased the ginger to 1/2 tsp because it overpowered the molasses. I decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. NOTE: These were perfect when I took these out of the oven after 6-7 minutes. At 8 minutes, they had burned. Once they were perfected, I made these for a party and everyone raved over them. My husband says they taste like Christmas. ONE OF THE BEST COOKIES I HAVE EVER EATEN!

I discovered this recipe when I used the ingredients search to rule out recipes that required butter, margarine, or shortening. As it turns out, it was a blessing.  I will definitely add these cookies to my repertoire along with snickerdoodles and chocolate chip cookies. I didn't change anything (even though I was tempted to) other than taking them out after 10 minutes and doubling the recipe. I would definitely recommend doubling the recipe as you will undoubtedly have the demand for them. I have since made a vegan version, using egg replacer, and these cookies were equally good. Both my teens (the vegan and non-vegan) love them! These cookies are amazing!

So yummy! My mom LOVES these cookies and I made them for her birthday. I like how they're so chewy and not cake-like like other recipes on here. The stated baking time is definitely too much. I think 10 minutes is just fine unless you want harder, crispy cookies.

Molassses Sugar Cookies.  This is what our recipe is named.  I've been making this cookie for YEARS...from a recipe that belonged to my grandma.  Only diff in mine is I use no cloves, and there is a bit of salt added.  Oh...and never never would I add vanilla to this cookie - the molasses and ginger and cinnamon are the stars here.  Also the bake time is a bit long here - I never bake for more than 10 minutes, and usually take them out at 9.  We like these soft and chewy, so if you do as well, then you won't want to bake them for over 10 minutes.  This is an AWESOME cookie and has always been a favorite in my household.  EDIT** This recipe identical to the Ginger Crinkles recipe here, except for these have cloves.  I would think that both cookies would be deelish - but the cloves would provide a bit of a spicier cookie.   You can't go wrong with either one!

These cookies are gorgeous, just like the ginger biscuits I used to buy from the gingerbread shop in Ashbourne, England.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used butter instead of vegetable oil (never been too fond of anything other than butter in cookies) and I also doubled the spices.  I did use another reviewers advice and let cool on wax paper rather than a rack.  I made 14 large size cookies from this batch which were crunchy on the onside but so chewy inside.  The aroma in the kitchen was heavenly! I will certainly be making these again and again...

The only things I changed with these cookies was the cooking time, I reduced it by four minutes because I didn't want crispy cookies, and I didn't have vegetable oil, so I used olive oil. They came out great! (and possibly healthier?) This was my first time making these kind of cookies and I was very surprised at how easy it was to make them, I will definitely make these again soon!

These are very good and so easy. Next time I'll probably add a bit more spice - perhaps a bit of nutmeg. They're yummy right out of the oven, and will probably be even tastier after a few hours to give the flavors more time to blend. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Instead of vegetable oil, I used butter. I made no other changes. I used my small cookie scoop to make uniform cookies. I baked my cookies at 350* for ten minutes--they puffed up beautifully while baking, they didn't spread and after cooling, they looked just like what you would expect a molasses cookie should look like. Absolutely wonderful.

These came out perfect!  Made them for a bake sale, and had to stop my 7 year old from eating them up. A big hit.

Loved these cookies!!!  Perfect texture - looked great - and everyone loved them!  Only thing I changed with the recipe is I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.

Make sure the dough is really thick or it will be too sticky to roll - I used about 2 1/4 cups of flour. I also used half brown half white sugar, but next time might use 3/4 if not even all brown (but white for rolling). 
I baked them 7-8 min, but I also made smaller cookies- the dough balls expand a LOT! About double the amount choc chip cookies expand, so if you want normal size cookies use less than a teaspoon (cutlery-size spoon, not the measurement).
The wax paper trick works, thanks for sharing! Cookies are still soft after letting them cool on wax paper instead of cooling racks.
Bottom line: definitely a keeper! Edit: a year later, still loving these cookies!

A home run!  EVERYONE who tasted these cookies raved about them!  Baking 6-7 minutes was perfect.  Using the proportions as shown, this recipe made 2 1/2 dozen cookies, not 4.

I am not known for my baking skills, so when my husband bit into these he immediately began searching the garbage for a box from the bakery.  They were amazing!  This recipe is a keeper!  The only modification was to substitute 1/2 cup of the white sugar for 1/2 cup of light brown sugar as previous posts recommended.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I have to disagree with other reviewers as I don't think these cookies are as tasty as other molasses recipes that are shortening/butter/margarine based.  These are much dryer.  Not going to keep this in the recipe file.

These are my husband's favourite cookies!  He says they're better than the ginger molasses cookies he used to buy from Starbucks.  And my kids love them too!  Also, very easy to make.

This is the first recipe I've seen that used oil rather than shortening or butter.  I felt some trepidation going in but the results were fabulous.  Took the advice of some of the previous posters and added salt, vanilla and switched out some of the white sugar for brown and these were delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Fabulous!!  We found they only needed about 10 minutes to bake.  That was the only change.  These are going in recipe box and will be made again.  Thanks for sharing!

So good!  I substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar, but otherwise made the recipe as posted.  Exactly what I was looking for after Betty Crocker's molasses cookie recipe let me down!

The perfect molasses cookie! It took me a few tries to get it just the way I like it, but it was well worth it. I used a little (1/4 c)  whole wheat flour with the white flour, added a pinch of salt, and used black strap molasses for a stronger flavor. For the sugar on top, I used vanilla sugar. They were awesome!

These were excellent!  I doubled the recipe and was so glad I did.  The only change I made was I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Oh, and I did double the cinnamon.  I baked them for 12 minutes and they were still chewy three days later!  If you like chewy cookies, you'll love these!

I tripled the recipe as I cook for an assisted living home, and the residents could hardly wait until they came out of the oven!!  Great recipe!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, more cinnamon and less ginger and cloves, just because of my taste and the residents.  Wish I could give more stars.  Thanks so much.

Everything you always wanted in a molasses cookie: chewy crackled outsides, soft cakey insides, with a wonderful fragrance that makes the whole house smell like Christmas. I love that these cookies use no butter and could easily be made for vegan friends. I used olive oil and palm sugar for a very healthy version, and they came out just as good as with regular sugar. I added extra spices since I like mine spicy - 2 teaspoons cinammon, 1.5 teaspoons ginger, heaping 1/2 teaspoon of cloves. I flattened mine slightly as the first batch did not spread, probably my oven's fault. I also dipped the tops on sparkling sugar instead of the regular kind. My new go-to molasses cookie.

These didn't puff like the picture but I got raves from my friends. I added 1/2 cup more flour and rolled them in Demerara cane sugar before baking and it gave them a little crunch. I will definitely make them again.

Very good and very easy. I did 1/2 sugar 1/2 brown sugar. Even with a bad cold these have a strong yummy taste! I made pretty big cookies and got about 26 cookies out of it. Don't eat the whole batch though!!(TMI) Molasses is a natural laxative...

WOW!  These are REALLY good!  I've made two batches.  The first I made almost exactly as directed, except I used Canola oil  and used 3/4 c sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  The second batch, I used butter flavored crisco instead of canola oil.  I have made the first batch and they are amazing!  I pulled the first tray out at 8 minutes, but the second tray needed 11 to start getting crackly.  I also baked them on parchment paper so that I could move them directly to my cooling table, instead of cooling them on wax paper as I read.  Will post more on how that works later!  I believe I will be making a couple more batches of this cookie for the holiday season.  They will go fast!

My husband loves these cookies. I made two batches, one mixed by hand, and the other with an electric mixer. If you want a more traditional flat cookie, use the electric mixer. Otherwise, mix by hand for a thicker cookie. I also used the advise from other reviews and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and white sugar. I didn't have any cloves at home, so I used 1tsp. ground nutmeg instead, and they were still spicy and delicious. I also only baked them for about 10 minutes, and they were perfect.

DELISH!   I did do 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Also, I rolled mine into more like medallion shapes because I wanted a bigger, flatter cookie. Perfect! Mine lacked a bit of a kick because I didn't have cloves but they were still delicious! Will be making these many many more times!

These cookies are pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly - if I make them again, I will increase the spices and decrease the cooking time. They get super hard/crunchy but are still tasty (especially with a hot beverage).

The only change I made was to do half white and half brown sugar. These are exceptionally good - I made them big - this recipe yeilds about 16 large cookies. Nice and soft in the middle (I cooled them right on the parchment, not on a rack). I'm having one right now with a nice cup of tea :)

Good recipe!  Cooking time was too long, 8 or 9 minutes would have been perfect.  Also should have flattened the balls slightly before cooking.

Fantastic recipe!  I followed the suggestions by HOLLYE45, using olive oil, but split the flour to half whole wheat and half all purpose.  I even doubled the recipe and it worked great.  Yummy!  I used a small cookie scoop to make all of the cookies similar size - this was so easy and so delicious.  Definitely a permanent place in my recipe box.

These are great cookies! But I did use 1 teaspoon of baking soda instead of 2 teaspoons because I could taste the baking soda. And I added 1 tablespoon of water which seemed to make them softer.

This is an excellent recipe! My first time making molasses cookies and it was so simple. I followed a few suggestions of other reviewers. I did 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, I cut the ginger in half, and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and salt. Also if you want a chewy cookie only bake 7-8 minutes. So easy and super delicious!

These are terrific!  I took the suggestion to cool on wax paper and they were soft and a little chewy; yum!  I strongly recommend using sugar in the raw to roll them in.  They are so pretty and the coarse sugar is so good!  I did have to use pumpkin spice because I didn't have the ginger.  I bet using each spice is just as good.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

My husband and I don't care for sweets so I seldom bake.  But I made these when we had friends visit, and they're amazing and so easy to make.  Everyone raves about them, I just made another batch to take to a dinner party tonight.  I use brown sugar and whole wheat flour but I'm sure the original version is just as good.  I didn't have ginger or cloves so I doubled the amount of cinnamon.  I reduced the baking time to 8 minutes in a convection oven.
Fabulous!

Yummaroo!! I think I've made these before but last time I followed other people's advice and doubled the spices. This time I just followed the recipe and ran out of molasses (but was pretty close). These are good as is!! :) 7 minutes of baking time was about right.

These were fabulous!  And easy, too (no creaming butter and sugar - hooray!)  I followed the recipe exactly as written, I just used half a teaspoon of ginger as others suggested.  After 12 minutes, they came out perfectly, firm but chewy and the perfect amount of spice.  Thanks for this recipe!

Yummmmmmmy! WOW..... This was my first time baking gingersnap cookies-I was a little leery of all the spices involved.  Cookies turned out Very flavorful, sweet and spicy, with a perfect texture too. My boyfriend ate 5 already and said they are even better than his Mother's recipe.

These are the easiest and best molasses cookies I've ever eaten, and I love the fact that I can use Canola oil instead of butter or shortening. I followed mixing ingredients exactly. I used an icecream scoop to drop 10 large cookies onto a parchment-lined large cookie sheet. This recipe's a keeper. Thank you.

These are delicious. I always worry about cookies being too cakey on not chewy enough given that I live at 7,000 feet but this required no alterations (just don't use convection or they won't collapse and crackle as they should). Thanks for this foolproof classic!

I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this cookie yet.  I've been making them for about a year and they are soooo good!  I've never had to change a thing.  We made them for Thanksgiving dessert along with some homemade pumpkin pecan ice cream and the combination was incredible!  Hubby's still trying to devise a plan on how to turn them into ice cream sandwiches!

I went with this recipe because the grocery store was closed and I had a limited supply of butter, but lots of oil.  I made the recipe as is except I did use 2/3c white sugar and 1/3 c of brown sugar.  You MUST only cook these for 8-10 minutes if you want chewy cookies.  I burned the 2nd batch.  The rest were great, a little crispy the 1st night but PERFECT the second night.  My husband and everyone else loved these.

Amazing!! I love this kind of cookie. I'm always lookin g for ones that come out crisp outside and chewy inside. These were perfect at 12 min. 

I also love that there's no need for butter/marg ... That's how I found it. My cupboards are bare. The mixing was SO easy with the oil. Perfect dough texture.

the only thing I changed was doubling the molasses because I like it that way.

These cookies were alright.  They came out a little less flavorful as compared to my grandma's old recipe but that probably has to do with the fact she loved real butter. I also like molasses cookies extra chewy and these were a bit on the fluffy side

VEry good!  But do not add any salt as one reviewer suggested.  Make as it - or do 1/2 wheat flour & half white, 1/2 brown sugar & half white, heaping measurements of ginger and cloves, and 1 tsp. vanilla  Were soft after placing on wax paper.  Yum!

Really good. I told my husband I put the cooling cookies on parchment paper therefore making them chewier and he was so upset (he likes the crunch, he claimed)...that is, until he tasted the chewier result and now he favors that.

Look no further - these are the perfect cookies. I have made them countless times now and everyone loves them. The flavour is wonderful and they have a nice soft, chewy texture. They are very kid friendly - my daughter loves to roll them in the sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet. Don't hesitate to try these - you'll be glad you did!

I search by ingredient since I didn't have any butter and wanted to bake cookies for my sister's house.  I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp of salt and used half white half whole wheat flour. They ended up baking at 10-12 mins. Perfect texture, chewy middle and nice crisp edges.

Found this recipe and tried it and the cookies are addictive.  My family is hooked on these cookies.  If you just add the 1/4 tsp salt like the back of the Grandma's molasses jar says, the flavor of these cookies is really enhanced.

Just like the Starbucks Ginger cookies!  I used 1/3 cup molasses + 1/2 tsp allspice.  I also made sure to flatten them before baking because my "test batch" didn't flatten like I expected them to.  2 cups of flour is plenty ~ next time I make them I'll use only 1 3/4 cups.  I had to really work the dough with 2 cups of flour.  12 minutes of baking at most ~ watch cookies carefully!  A delicious super spicy cookie!  Soft & chewy inside and crunchy edges!

These were just fantastic! Didn't change a thing from the recipe. I'll be making these again and again. Nice molasses flavor, crunch on the outside, chewy on the inside. Plus, very easy to make. I didn't get 4 dozen, though. Maybe I rolled them bigger than 1.5 inches, but they turned out great. Maybe they crisp all the way through when smaller, but I liked how they turned out chewy in the center.

These were delicious!!! I only rated them a four, because I don't believe they would have came out nearly as good if I didn't substitute butter for the oil. I added about 1/4 tsp. more ginger and baked them for 12 minutes. The flavor was great and they were soft on the inside. 

I will surely be making these again.

Awesome!  All the flavor of a ginger snap but soft and chewy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did need to add about 1/4 cup of flour to the dough, baked for 11 minutes and WOW!  Thank you for a great recipe.

This recipe is yummy - just the right mix of spice and sweetness.  I reduced the time to 10 minutes for a convection oven and they turned out slightly crispy around the edges and chewy in the middle. 

I was looking for a recipe for my son who is allergic to milk and soy and he loves them!

This recipe is excellent!
I had a similar recipe 25 years ago, and lost it during a move. Been trying to find a "near duplicate" since.
This on gets my vote.

thanks, Sweetpooch

They do indeed taste like gingersnaps. A good recipe for when you have no vanilla or butter. I don't really care for gingersnaps so I didn't like them, but the kids did. They were not good enough to make again, but ok if you like gingersnaps.

Yummy cookies! Very easy, not at all too spicy. Perfect. I did change just a few things after reading the reviews. I used 1c white flour, 1c whole wheat flour, 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar. I baked them for 8 minutes and they were done. I did let them cool longer than I usually do right on the cookie sheet. They are soft, but hold their shape nicely. Personally, I prefer my cookies to have more crunch. Next time, they'll go right on the cooling rack. I made them last night, and I think they're ALL gone :-)

Amazingly easy, amazingly fast, and amazingly good!  I used Splenda - half white, half brown - and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Baked for 10 mins.  Wish I'd doubled the recipe.  I'll make these again and again.  Just like grandma's.

I get so many requests for these!  I usually make 3 batches at a time- 1 for my family, and 2 for my coworkers, as they are consumed within a few hours of arriving at work!  The only changes I made were to  do half white sugar and half brown sugar, and to decrease the cooking time to about 10 minutes.  Also, DO cool these on wax paper- keeps the middles nice and soft.

The recipes itself is delicious. The only problem I had was the cooking time as stated was too long. I know my oven temperature is correct and the first tray just barely burned at 10 minutes. The second tray I baked for 8 minutes and that was just about perfect. Thanks for sharing this tasty, easy recipe.

These are very good.  I've been trying to find a ginger cookie recipe similar to this and have tried another one on this site and this one is the best!  It's chewy in the center.  Yum!  I gave them away for Christmas and people were asking for the recipe:)  This one is a keeper.

It is an incredibly rainy day today--not sure if that is why I had to add so much extra flour.   I did double the spices b/c I love my molasses cookies spicy!  They are in the oven now and smell wonderful.  Used oat flour instead of white and even added a little bit of cardamom. Delicious!

I don't eat molasses cookies very often but had a craving for them.  I have never baked them before and these turned out fabulous!  They look like I bought them from a bakery!  I have never seen such a perfect looking cookie come out of my oven!  Ha!  Love these!

Watch over your cookies - I let them stay for the full 12 minutes as indicated by the recipe, and when they came out, they weren't burned, but SUPER crunchy. (I happen to love crunchy, so this was a very good surprise!) If you want them chewy on the inside, but a little crunchy on the outside, watch your cookies and take them out just 1 minute after their tops crack!  Otherwise, THESE ARE BEST COOKIES EVER!! Even people who say dislike molasses or ginger or whatever will have a hard time staying away from them once they've had one.

These are very good and my husband loved them!  Because I don't eat any refined sugar, the second time I made them, I replaced the 1 cup sugar with 1 cup honey.  I rolled them in a little raw sugar which has a little more cruch to it and my hubby couldn't tell the difference!  Oh, yeah.  I also had to add extra flour - about 1 1/2 cups extra.  I will definitely keep this recipe in my rotation.

These cookies had a good taste, but I found two cups of flour was definately not enough.  My dough was far too soft, and they burned before they could crackle on top.

This is a great molasses cookie recipe.  It's the first one I've tried that called for oil and not shortening.  I am so glad you posted it.  I reduced the ground ginger to 1/3 tsp and added 1/3 cup finely chopped candied ginger to the mix which really upped the gingery taste.

Delicious cookies with the addition of a 1/4 t of allspice.  First time I did not use the full amount of ginger.  That batch was bland.  Next batch had all the ginger and some allspice.  The amazing thing about these cookies is that everyone was picture perfect. A keeper

These were good but way too sweet for me. I didn't even roll in the extra 1/3 cup of sugar at the end and I found them too sweet- but I personally don't like a lot of sweetness.  I would definitely cut the sugar to 3/4 cup next time... or use one cup of loosely packed brown sugar.  I would also cut the oil a little bit- I found them very greasy.  One last thing- make sure you smash your balls of dough flat before you cook them otherwise they'll stay in ball shapes!

I was a little leery about the amount of oil, but I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out perfect! 
I will use this one over and over again!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I made a batch of these last night and they are already gone! They taste like molasses cookies mixed with ginger snaps and ooohhhh there sooooo yummy! After I make any type of cookies I take a brown paper bag, cut it open and set the hot cookies on the bag. Its a great trick to get out alot of the grease, but either keep the cookies moist and chewy or crisp and slightly chewy like these wonderful cookies. I can say that at my first attempt at making Molasses cookies they came out perfect. I will for sure be making more of these very very soon.

There couldn't be a better molasses cookie. (Everyone that tried them agreed!)I have made them twice and they are so simple. My only advice is to try to make them as small as possible because they really spread out as they bake, so you can easily end up with GIANT cookies if you're not careful. 

I also put a bit more spice in them. (about 1/4 tsp. of cardamom, allspice instead of cloves, and extra cinnamon. I also tried using half and half white and brown sugar. (It doesn't really make much of a difference to the end result though)

Unlike similar recipes I have tried with margarine or  butter, the dough didn't stick to my hands while rolling into balls, which I'm guessing is due to the oil. I used approximately half white/half whole wheat pastry flour and the texture is light and soft. I added an egg and a little more spice (extra 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg) and a bit of extra flour. I chilled the dough before rolling into balls. I'll make these again.

Loved these cookies, the spice was just right!  I used butter in place of the oil.  With my oven, I found 12 min. cooking time was perfect for a chewy cookie.  Can't wait to make another batch!

I haven't had molasses cookies in probably 40 years!  I looked up and found this recipe, but then remembered that my great Aunt Em made a delicious molasses cookie, and that I had the recipe for them in my recipe box. I pulled out her recipe, and it is exactly the same as this one, except for hers called for "oleo" instead of the vegetable oil. I made these with the vegetable oil, as stated in the recipe, and they turned out just as delicious as my great Aunt Em's! Now, if I could just stop eating them!

We LOVE this recipe!!! We've made it several times, and the only change we made was to add just a bit more flour to make the dough stiff enough to be able to roll into balls...But you'll never buy store made again once you try these, and they're easy to make...

Followed recipe exactly as written. Baked the first batch 8 minutes and they were a little underdone. Baked the rest 10 minutes and cooled on wax paper and they were perfect. I took them to a work function and there were none to bring home! I even had someone say they were the best molasses cookies they ever had.

Everyone loves these, including my partner who would typically choose any other type of cookie before eating a ginger one.  I think they taste best 2-3 days after baking.

These cookies are amazing. I love that I don't have to cream butter so don't have to use a mixer. So easy to mix by hand. Added bonus of being dairy free. These come out crackly every time, and I cool on wax or parchment paper so that they stay chewy longer. Love love love them!

These cookies taste and look much like ones you might buy in the supermarket!  I formed my cookies using a cookie scoop, which produced cookies that spread pretty thin, but were still good.  next time, I will form smaller cookie balls before baking.

Loved them.  Second batch this week.  I doubled all the spices and only baked for 11 minutes.  Turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

These were a huge hit!!! I did adjust a few things... I made them thin in the beginning, but found that they are much better a little thicker. I baked them for 9 minutes. I used light brown sugar rather than white sugar. I spiced them up a hair more. And I used the wax paper trick that was referred to in an earlier post. Awesome recipe!

Thank you Laurie for this great cookie recipe! Everyone at work enjoyed these yummy cookies.  I baked them for 9 minutes.  Perfect!  Addendum to my review above.  I made these again a few weeks ago and subbed half brown sugar for half of the white sugar. They were so hard we couldn't eat them.  I had to throw out the whole batch. Tonight I made them EXACTLY as the recipe reads and they were outstanding. The best cookie ever.  Even beating out, in my family anyway, the Big Soft Ginger Cookie on this website. These Crackle Top Cookies are so much more attractive and they taste just as delicious, but without the saturated fat from the butter.  Do not press down the tops of these cookies, just roll them in the sugar and put them on the cookie sheet.  Perfect says it all.

PERFECTION! If you do nothing else, follow the summarization of suggestions in HOLLYE45's review and add salt, vanilla, heaping your spices, and making 1/2 your sugar brown sugar. I also made 1 cup of the flour called for whole wheat flour, and you can't tell the difference - promise! I highly recommend doing this as a good way to sneak some whole wheat in to make these a little healthier. I think next time, I will actually cut down on the sugar a bit overall, because these are definitely sweet. They're so rich I could only eat three, and my cookies were fairly small. I was a bit worried for a minute because as I was rolling the dough in my hands, it didn't seem to be sticking together quite right, but not to fear if this happens to you- mine turned out picture-perfect. These turn out brilliantly - crisp outer edges with moist, almost brownielike centers. Very similar to a gingersnap, but much more rich and moist. The finished product is quite pretty. Added bonus - they take no time at all to prepare and I only got one bowl dirty. Love it! 5 stars!

I don't like spices... and I was very tempted to folllow other reviewers' suggestions on cutting down spices... DON'T!!!  These cookies are amazing!! I am glad I did not change a thing on the recipe.   I never expected to love the spicyness of these cookies. I love crunchy cookies, and if you do too, bake them for 14 minutes and use a rack to cool them.  Thank you for such an amazing cookie.  This is exactly what I've been craving for.

Very good!I used a stick of butter and 1/3 of a cup of vegetable oil for my particular taste.I did add about 1 and 1/4 tsp. of the ginger and cinnamon and I didn't have any cloves so I used about 1 tsp. of nutmeg.I cooked them for 9 min. and they came out so moist and tasty.

Not the sweetest cookie, but still yummy. Milk is perfect for pairing with this treat. Odd dough consistancy for a cookie, but it still worked well. Making these in the summer makes me wish it was already fall!

Possibly my favorite cookie to bake so far. Used half brown sugar/white sugar. AMAZING! In order to make the flattened look, I rolled it into a ball first, rolled it in sugar, and flattened it with my palm. Then I sprinkled on some more sugar to give it a "sparkly" look.

These are so easy, I always have the ingredients on hand, and my little boy loves to roll them in sugar before they bake.  Just under cook them slightly and let them cool and finish on the sheet and they will stay soft.

Very easy, and definitely taste like soft gingersnaps.  Yum!  Gingersnaps are some of my favorite cookies!  I love how these crackle on top--I just love cookies that do that, and I really like the flavor of these as well.  Very very easy.  they don't make a huge batch, but I'm sure they are easily doubled.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy cookie!  Rave reviews from my husband and my teenaged son!  After reading other reviews I did reduce the baking time to 10 minutes and added 1/2 tsp of salt (something needs to make the baking soda work, right?).  My family doesn't like cloves so I used nutmeg instead.  I used my mixer when combining the oil and sugar and also after adding the egg to add volume.  The dough reminds me of soft playdough, very easy to work with.  Definitely going into my recipe box!

Unbelievable!  I followed the recipe but baked them for only 10 minutes as others have recommended.  They get devoured by my family.  My only other recommendation: bake a double batch!  My kids say they taste like Christmas.

I had a yearning to make cookies, but found myself without any butter. Not to fear - these cookies were perfect! I substituted Splenda for half the sugar in the cookie dough (not the "coating"" sugar) with excellent results. I'll make these again and again!

Mine did not crackle, sadly. I don't know why, but the past few times I have made soft molasses cookies, they haven't crackled. Hmm. Anyway, these cookies tasted fine, but I do have another recipe which uses brown sugar, and the family likes better. But thanks!

After making these several times, I decided to reduce the baking soda by half to get rid of the soda aftertaste and added 1/2 tsp salt to bring out the flavours. They are still turning out as nice and crinkled as before the changes. To me, these are a softer version of a gingersnaps, not molasses cookies.

Very yummy!  I only used 2/3 cup of the white sugar and didn't roll them in sugar.  With these modifications I'd give it 5 stars but the original recipe made them WAY too sweet.

This is a great cookie!  Really easy to make.  I was looking for a chewy type of molasses cookie (like the kind you can get at Starbucks).  While this isn't exactly the same as the Starbucks, it is delicious.  Crunchy on top and moist in the middle - yummy!

I was pulling out an old recipe and thought 'ah hah!  I finally have a recipe I can post on all recipes that will knock their socks off!' but alas - someone else had the recipe too.  This is without a doubt one of my all time favorite (if not THE favorite) cookie recipe.  Crunchy AND chewy! YUMMMMMMM

A tasty cookie recipe - I made just as directed and the 25 cookies :-) were delicious. I baked them a few minutes less than indicated so they'd be chewy. Thanks for the easy to make recipe Laurie.

These were fabulous.I did add some Nutmeg and thought it could have been a little spicier so I will add a bit more next time.Just a touch too sweet I may add a little salt next time.Great recipe thanks for sharing.

I am NOT a baker. I love baked goods, but I can't make them. They always taste good, but look horrible. I was so happy last night when these came out of the oven and looked like I had purchased them at a high end bakery. I took some to work and they got rave reviews by everyone. Someone even asked for the recipe...I was so proud of myself. I think I'm going to have to make another batch today!

A very nice spiced cookie.... but not overly spiced.... the balance is perfect! I added a teaspoon of maple extract to the mix. Quick, easy, and the family enjoys a molasses cookie, but doesn't like molasses.

I was disappointed in this cookie. It was the greasiest cookie I've ever worked with. And then to top it off they didn't spread at all! I ended up with 22 balls coated in sugar. The only thing I did differently was use egg replacer and others had done that with success, so I don't think it was that. Think I'll stick to my mother's recipe after all.

Doubld the spice, replaced half the white sugar with brown, and baked for 10 minutes a batch. All matters of preference. Still came out PERFECT!!! These were crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. They need to cool for quite a while before you attempt transporting them. Well worth the wait!!

I love these cookies! I didn't have all the spices called for, so I used my favorites, cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg, instead with great results.  I also shortened the bake time since I have the turbo-furnace - about 8 minutes was perfect. Also, you have to love a cookie that doesn't cost you $2 worth of butter to make!

These cookies look really beautiful, but I wasn't wowed by them. They reminded me alot of snickerdoodles. I prefer a molasses cookie that is a bit spicier. I'll keep looking.

This is an awesome recipe. You can use whole wheat flour instead and it really doesn't impact the taste (I've tried both ways).

This is a great recipe, a little chewy but crunchy on the edges  Easy and a bit healthier especially if you use Canola oil to replace the vegetable oil.  Too bad we don't measure flour by weight in the USA it would solve some of the problems the other reviewers mentioned about how much flour is needed.

This is one of the best cookie recipes ever. Much better than that other recipe with 500 ratings in that its easier. So easy. I dont find the oil gross at all and it makes the cookies moist. This is my third time making these. I add fresh ginger along side the dried and ground. Vegan of course. Thanks!

These are nice cookies, but I was hoping for a spicier flavor.  Very very easy to make, and they come out pretty.  I liked the batches that I undercooked slightly the best, they stayed nice and chewy.

Delicious old fashioned type of cookie.  They looked nice and tasted great.  Not oily at all.  I did not alter the recipe.  My batch was a harder cookie with a good crunch.  Great for dunking.

I am putting this in my recipe file... What I really liked about it is the oil instead of butter.  Sometimes it's good to have recipes with other options.  I did go with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.... And added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I also skipped rolling them in the sugar.
  I baked them for 10 minutes 
Easy, delicious and the perfect "after" the holiday rich goodies.  I like them especially with tea.  I will definitely be making these again.  My hubby really liked them too.

The best molasses cookie recipe I've used. Soft, chewy and delicious. The best part is how EASY they are to make! I can make a double batch, start to finish, in under an hour including clean-up!

Lot's of changes:
1. GF flour
2. Brown Sugar for white
3. Rolled in turbino sugar before baking
4. Butter and peanut butter for oil
5. Fresh ginger juice in lieu of all listed spices
End result was da bomb at the cookie exchange!

Followed the recipe to the T.  Knew it would be a disaster when the dough was dry and crumbly. Rolling it into balls, it’d just crumble to pieces.

I made it according to the recipe. First time, I added more flour and baked  12 mins. The were perfect if you like crunchy coffee dunkers. Second time, I didn’t add the extra flour and baked them for 10 mins. They turned out nice and chewy with a little crunch on top. I would make these again.

only used 2/3 cup sugar, half whole wheat half white flour, no cinnamon and did not roll in sugar. Each modification was done to meet the preference of each family member. the results were delicious. had to add a couple table spoons extra of white flour to make the dough stiff.

LOVE these cookies! They’re amazingly soft and chewy inside, with a nice crisp outside. 

As far as changes, I did choose to cut the amount of ginger in half. The first batch I made I felt like the ginger was a little strong, so I cut it to half a teaspoon and I think it was perfect that way! I’m picky about ginger though, so that’s just my own opinion. 

I’d definitely recommend this recipe if you want a delicious molasses cookie that will disappear just as fast as you can make them!

Beautiful and delicious! I tossed in a little nutmeg too! Refrigerate the dough for about an hour before making the cookies. This makes it a lot easier to work with.

Not an overly sweet cookie.  I really like the crispness (baked on an airbake pan).  Instead of all flour i substituted 1/3 of the flour for protein powder.  And i rolled them in confectioner's sugar.  These substitutions remind me of my grandma's molasses cookies.

Great cookies. Easy to make in stand mixer. Next time I will use melted butter rather than oil. We didn't like the trace flavour of the oil. We are used to butter flavoured cookies.  Also had to use fresh ginger with garlic press .... No powdered ginger in the pantry....

These were good, but I prefer my molasses cookies a little denser, softer, and chewier. These were very light and brittle. It is very important to take them out as soon as they crack, which for me, was much earlier than the time the recipe called for. Tasty and light, just not what I was hoping for.

I LOVE this recipe!!! The cookies are moist and delightfully crunchy on the edges. Everyone loved them! I would definitely make them again. The one change I made was to use grape seed oil instead of veggie oil. It is healthier, and is almost the same as veggie oil.

Made no changes.  This was a good cookie, soft and chewy when fresh out of the oven, and harder with a crunch after they cool completely.  Wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was a nice quick oil cookie.

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and it got rave reviews! In fact, four people have asked me to bake them a batch! The only substitution I made was to reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup and add a 1/2 cup brown sugar. I baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect--soft and chewy. As ovens vary, I would begin to check them at 9 or 10 minutes and go from there. P.S. They're even better the next day!!

I made these with dark cane syrup instead of molasses. They were delicious although we felt like it was missing something without the molasses. I will make these again as soon as I get some molasses!

Perfect! Not too sweet, spicy, soft and lovely! I used caster sugar to roll the balls in and pressed the balls of dough flat with the bottom of a glass like I saw my grandma do when I was little... They are Perfect!

My favorite cookies, hands down. Instead of all white sugar, I prefer 1/2 cup each brown and white sugar. Also, I tone down the spices just a bit so the molasses taste comes through more. Try them, they taste like Christmas!

These are awesome! I used heaping measurements for the spices and added a bit of nutmeg. Tem minutes in the oven is all you need. I cooled them on the baking sheet for 5 minutes and slid them on some wax paper after. Thanks for the great recipe!

excellent cookie. Mother in assisted living loves to store these in her room for a snack. All you need is a slice of bread inside the ziplock bag with the cookies and they will not get hard. Delicious!

I like these, but ended up adding AT LEAST another cup of flour to make  the dough at all possible to roll (& it was still way too sticky).

4 out of 5 stars because this was my first molasses cookie recipe ever. Batter was very soft though I was able to scoop it up and roll into a ball shape and dip it in sugar (very carefully). However, once laid out on the cookie sheet it began to spread out a bit. Recipe suggests adding a bit more flour (if needed) for better consistency but it wasn't totally unmanageable and I didn't want to screw with the amounts either. I did lightly grease the cookie sheets so that I wouldn't have cookie goop stuck on them. I used a medium size cookie scoop and the batter yielded (almost) 2 dozen cookies (I was short 1, lol). They crackled and kept a nice round shape. A few stuck together but it was easy to separate them. I sprinkled just a tiny smidge of sugar as soon as they were out of the oven for decor. The cookies are best the day of. The outer part is crisp and the center was soft but not gummy. Next time I'll use a small cookie scoop, I like thicker cookies.

I made these and made them a little smaller than recipe said.  I doubled the spices except for the cloves.
Very attractive and very crunchy.  I think next time I will add finely chopped candied ginger.  That would add to the chewiness.

I would second the other suggestions of using butter instead of oil, it helps the cookies stay moist, rather than going crisp the next day.  Other than that, they are tasty!

I had good results with this recipe. I think they'd be better (tasting) if made with melted butter. I increased the spices a little, and used half regular and half brown sugar. I got 31 cookies from this, and baked them for 8 minutes.

This is the best recipe for making "special" cookies I have ever used.  Friends and family alike agree.  I use coconut oil, which makes these babies taste perfect! For vegan cookies, try using 1/4 cup applesauce mixed with a tablespoon of cornstarch and a little water instead of the egg.  And instead of sugar on top, which makes these a little too sweet, try hulled hemp seeds.  DELISH

I just made these and only thing I changed was the baking soda.  Did  1 tsp. soda and 1 tsp. baking powder instead.  I haven't tasted them yet but they turned out beautiful.  I also made smaller balls using the smallest sized pampered chef scoop and I got 3 dozen out of one batch.  Baked them for 8 minutes and they were done!  Will update after I bring them to church tomorrow on how they taste!

I have been looking for a great gingersnap recipe for years......most are too soft for my family's taste.  These are perfect!!!  I did use butter instead of oil.  On my second batch I tried flattening them out a little but then you don't get the beautiful crackling and they really don't need it.  They also needed a little salt but really a great recipe.  Thanks!!!!

Delicious! I followed the main recipe exactly. I did put a little ginger in the sugar when I rolled the cookies.  I like the ginger taste

Super easy, super delicious.  I added a bit more cinnamon and ginger than the recipe called for.

I forgot and used SF flour. I added just a touch of salt and the soda so I thought I was goiing to have cookies that would never see the light of day. But to my surprise, they turned out really good. They are nice and crispy, not chewy but I love them. They are a perfect cookie in my book. I make try them with plain flour but when I want a crispy cookie this will be it. Thanks.

Great flavor and easy to work with.  However, mine didn't flatten out when cooked.  Perhaps more oil is needed or maybe just pressing a bit before baking.  I used allspice, vanilla, and cinnamon.

I used this recipe as a guide because I did not have all the spices. So instead of going to the store for the required spices I subbed them for 2.5 teaspoons of PUMPKIN PIE SPICE and about a teaspoon of Mexican Vanilla (sorry, I just opened the bottle and poured). I also made a random mixture of powdered sugar, course ginger sugar and table sugar to roll the dough around in and...they came out FANTASTIC!!!

Fabulous! The only significant changes I made were to substitute ~2/3C loosely packed brown sugar for the 1C white, reduce the oil to 1/2C, and add a dash of salt just to cut the sweetness a bit. I also used egg substitute in place of the egg just because I was out at the time, and rolled the dough in "Sugar in the Raw" as I wanted larger crystals. I'll keep these changes next time, and will also probably reduce the baking soda since the final product had a noticeable baking soda flavor about it... Awesome recipe, overall! Definitely a keeper [:

If you have cholesterol issues, you have to love a cookie with no butter or shortening.  I made just 6 cookies and used 1 TBS of Egg Beaters... and they were awesome!  They were so easy to make and 6 cookies were just right for my family of 3.

Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great but I didnt have any clove at the time so I didnt use it. When I was reading this I told myself Wow these sound good but why all the oil? So I subsituted half the oil with half a cup butter. I also added half a cup of molassas more than the recipe called for.(Grandmas Original works BEST!) Over all these were extremely good,but if you do what I did with the recipe it will taste even Better!!!

These are great! Look good too. To get them rise like nice, THICK cookies, be sure that the batter is quite dry and firm, as the recipe says. For me, that required a little less than 1/4 more cup of flour. These are easy to make, and I make them a lot. I often replace the cloves with nutmeg.

very yummy.  The only reason i'm not giving them 5 stars is they were too "cakey" but i served them with vanilla ice cream and they soaked it up...soo yum.  Next time i might add more ginger, just as a personal preference

We LOVE these cookies.  THey are SO easy, especially because most of the ingredients are ones that you would just have in your baking cabinet.  No special trips to the store! It was especially helpful when i had to go to a last minute function and had used the last of my butter!  NONE needed:)

MMMM!  I'll definitely make these again.  I followed some previous recommendations and did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, as well as 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour (plus adding a little extra whole wheat when i thought it was too wet).  I used canola oil for the unsaturated fats.  I baked 8 min. They were SUPER delicious!
