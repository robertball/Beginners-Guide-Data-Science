The sauce was sweet, delicious, and hot all rolled up in one. It was wonderful on ribs. Absolutely the best I have had on pork ribs. I loved it. Its a keeper. Easily becoming a family recipe for good.

This sauce is terrific, with just enough heat to make it addictive! I was unable to find fresh habanero peppers so I used dried ones. The only mistake I made was to puree everything at the end since I was after a smooth basting sauce for baby back ribs. The aeration from the blender made the sauce lose it's slick, rich color, so I won't do that again. I will probably just dice the onion much smaller next time. These are not for the faint-hearted!

Based on what I had on hand I had to alter the recipe a bit and it came out sensational. Didn't have any chili sauce so I subbed with two cans of tomato paste. No pineapple either, so I used a jar of pineapple marmalade. Red pepper flakes in lieu of the habanero, soy and hoisin sauce were added in just because I felt like it. Amazing sauce and thanks so much!

Thank you, TimSue. This is the best barbecue sauce ever. It tastes just like the Buckeye Barbecue sauce from Quaker Steak and Lube. I followed the directions as best I could. I couldn't find any habenero peppers so I just used habenero sauce. As one reviewer suggested, I added some liquid smoke and instead of crushed pineapple and pineapple juice, used pineapple sauce!! I also did add a lot more hot sauce simply b/c I wanted a really hot sauce.

No habenero pepper so I omitted it. I have two kids I fed this sauce to, so I wanted to be a little cautious. I did add one teaspoon of Liquid Smoke. I made no other changes or substitutions. I made this sauce yesterday and let it set in the fridge overnight before using it on barbeque chicken today. Very, very sweet. My kids really liked this (my oldest boy especially) but my husband and I were on the fence. For my husband and I, it was just a little too sweet. I think it could use a little more garlic, too.

Yikes! This is hot and good! I would cut back a little on the heat next time, but the flavor is fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, cooking it a little longer to thicken. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!! I did not add the crushed pineapple as I didn't have any. I also didn't have the habanaro pepper but substituted a small can of diced chili and added a few dashes of habanero sauce. This will be a regular barbeque sauce in our house. Thanks timsue!

I didn't love this recipe.  I would decrease the amount of onion & I found the ingredients expensive.

Great sauce spicy, and sweet.  I have made this sauce several times and really enjoy it.  I like to cook it longer as it tends to be a little watery if you follow the recommended time.  You might also want to throw it in a blended as it tends to have a salsa consistency if you don't (but my girlfriend prefers it unblended)

This was pretty good. My girlfriend can't handle excessively spicy things, so I cut the chili sauce in half, and didn't use the habanero. I also added 1/2 cup of soy sauce. Was easy to make, too!

This is a great sauce if you like hot food. It is sweet and hot at the same time I added a little bit of liquid smoke to give it a smokey but light taste too.

I guess it just wasn't my taste in sauce.  I thought it was a little too hot and that the chili sauce taste came through too strong.

This recipe is very versitile in that you can use brown or spicy mustard instead of the powder for a nice flavor or add a little extra habenero for more heat. Adding a little chopped mango is nice also, and put this sauce in a blender for a few seconds and it makes it even better. There are a number of ways to make this sauce to make it your own, We put it on chicken and fish as well as pork and we love it.

I really wanted to love this recipe.  It's full of stuff I love but the result was really disappointing.  There is some flavor I can't pinpoint that is just not doing it for me

I thought this was very tasty, but I got some strange reactions from others. I made a few changes; I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar. I only used a couple dashes of hot pepper sauce, since I'm not into spicy; I also left out the habanero altogether. And I used Jack Daniels whiskey, which was quite noticeable. Maybe I will cook it longer next time, after adding the whiskey. I mixed it with shredded pork that had been cooking in root beer all day, made a tasty sandwich!

If you don't like "hot" don't make this recipe. Your sauce will be maple syrup, basically... If you want it to turn out smooth purée your ingredients before cooking the mixture down. Loved it.
