I am no scone connoisseur...but these were easy and DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe to a T...with only one exception.  I had no huckleberries, so used thawed (purchased frozen) blueberries.  I served these at Easter brunch and EVERYONE (boys and girls from 5 to 85) loved them and several asked for the recipe.  Even my father-in-law, who usually thinks scones are too dry, loved these.  I'm already planning to make them again next weekend :)

These are the best huckleberry scones I've ever had!  Granted they're the first but as we're overloaded with wild huckleberries at our house we're always looking for new recipes.

I didn't have any fresh lemon or zest so I left the zest out and used my old standby Minute Maid frozen lemon juice concentrate and they turned out fine.  I can see how the zest would add another citrus dimension and look forward to doing them exactly as the recipe states soon.

My husband took one bite, rolled his eyes in happiness and stated, "Killer scones.  We won't be giving these away."

This is a great spring or summer-time treat. I used blueberries instead of huckleberries. The only comment I have to make is that these were very tart/lemony - make sure to measure exactly or use a little bit less than the recipe calls for.

Not the best berry scones I've had, but they aren't bad. The dough is a bit wet, and the berries on the bottom got burnt, but there are no major issues. I made half a batch and used almonds and almond extract in place of the topping and lemon juice.

I've been a baker of scones for almost 20 years and this recipe is absolutely a keeper.  Those who worry about the "too wet" dough should add only the amount of liquid (eggs/cream/zest) that is needed to make the dough easy to handle.  But if you pat it out on a floured surface, that shouldn't be a huge problem for most cooks.

Great great recipe! I substituted heavy cream in place of half and half- made the dough a little harder to handle although, they came out great! I did learn one thing- you have to use fresh berries!!!! I made one batch with fresh- perfect! The second time (actually in the oven right now) I thawed some of my once fresh berries I froze, they fall apart when folding in- I'm sure they'll be great but maybe next time I'll keep them frozen. Add some huckleberry juice to make the frosting and you're golden!

These scones were very good.  I followed the recipe all except for the huckleberries.  I substituted it with dried mango.  Very tasty!

Very good!  I doubled the lemon juice and used dried blueberries. They turned out light and delish!

This was excellent. The texture is just perfect-not too flakey, not too cakey, but just right. In proper All Recipes fashion, I did make a few changes based on availability of ingredients. I used blackberries instead of huckleberries because we don't have huckleberries in Arizona. I hand cut the berries in half so they wouldn't be too big for the scone. Other reviews also said that they could be kind of tart, so I used 4.5 TBS of sugar instead of 3 TBS because my berries weren't particularly sweet. I didn't have half and half, so I used whole milk. And I haven't decided if I'm going to glaze them or not-I think they're perfectly yummy even without the glaze. 

It really makes exactly 12 nice sized scones-more if you make minis. But these will fly off the plate, so you better start by doubling, rather than having to go back and make more like I am doing.

YUM!  The only change I made was using raspberries instead of the huckleberries.  These are so light and not overly sweet.  I make scones often and these are now on top of my list!!

I like this recipe because it uses a little less butter.  I added 1/2 cup of chia seed and substitited my garden fresh raspberries instead of huckleberries.

The scones were delicious.    I would have liked more huckleberry flavor (since I had to climb a mountain to pick them) and these are more lemony.  I would probably make them again with blueberries, and use a recipe with less lemon flavor for my hucks.

My 12 year old son was in the mood to make breakfast this morning.  He decided to make these scones, and they were very good.  The only reason I didn't rate it five stars is that the dough was really sticky and difficult to work with.  They are not very sweet, I would prefer them to be a tiny bit sweeter, but they were really good. We will make them again soon.

It's the lemon that attracted me to this recipe but I had to sub in blueberries as no huckleberries are available--they were still very yummy.
