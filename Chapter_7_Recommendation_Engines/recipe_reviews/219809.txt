Mushroom soups are fairly standard concoctions; usually some variation of mushrooms, cream, chicken broth and maybe herbs or spices.  Most are good.  This one is excellent.  First, roasting the mushrooms rather than sautéing them not only simplifies the preparation, it also lends a deeper, bolder mushroom flavor.  The wee bit of rosemary and thyme is subtle yet makes its presence known, and gives the soup definition and character beyond just the one dimensional taste of the mushrooms.  Outside of adding another four ounces or so of mushrooms only because I had them to use, I stuck to the recipe as directed and was quite happy with it. While it may not be a chunky, hearty soup it is deceptively just as substantial and filling.  Nicely done.

Very, very nice. I made the recipe as written with no changes whatsoever. I would definitely rate this as "above restaurant quality". Roasting the mushrooms provided a distinct and unique flavor that was unexpected. Light-textured enough for a summertime soup also. I did double the recipe as suggested, it froze and re-heated like a dream!
Thank you so much for sharing this.

Not the best mushroom soup there is but I've had worse.  Would have given it 3 stars but since i had to use milk instead of heavy cream, I gave it 4 stars.  Taste wise, the rosemary and thyme were spot on with the mushrooms, but I used 1 large onion and it was way too much.  Roasting the mushrooms for 15 minutes was not enough to bring out the flavor and added additional fat unnecessarily (with the EVOO).  If I try again, I would roast the onions with the mushrooms and roast for at least 30 minutes at 350.For mushroom lovers, definitely worth a try because it may fit your family's tastes.

The rosemary and garlic roasted mushrooms gave aromatic flavor, the thyme simmered with the onions and garlic, and it all blended amazingly into a fragrant, creamy soup. I cut the oil and butter amounts in half, for less fat, and also had to use rice milk for both the cream and milk, due to lactose intolerance. I added a couple of T. of coffee creamer to add richness. Would probably have to give it six stars with real cream.

Yummy! I skipped the cream/milk. Added more broth and thickened it with a roux at the end. Also added some tumeric for pretty golden color!

It tastes good, but I thought it was missing some creaminess and texture, so I added chunks of potato and used hand blender to crush some of it, left some chunks though... since soup was almost ready I had to boil the potato separate in order to fix the soup. So Next time I will add the potato with the liquid.

Mushrooms always disappear around me way too quickly, so I made a triple batch of this. :) I used a combination of shitake, white button, and portobello mushrooms, and replaced one of the onions with a large leek. Amazing!

This was an amazing recipe.  Made just as written, garnished with crispy pancetta, Parmesan, and a drizzle of white truffle oil.  Literally to die for, - Chef Keith

I used three cartons of button mushrooms (on sale; couldn't resist), which was a bit more than doubling it. I roasted the shrooms 20 minutes with some fresh rosemary sneaked from my neighbor's bush, plus some fancy lemon-flavored olive oil. Skipped the heavy cream and used fat-free evap milk. Sparingly used my immersion blender in the pot instead, cause I'm my father's daughter and like chunky soup. Then forgot and got caught up in a great old movie and came back an hour later to find the soup cooked down halfway but thank goodness not burned. Threw in a little more broth and a few spinach leaves that needed to be used. AMAZING!!!! Thank you!!!

This was great mushroom soup.  It was even better the second day after the flavors had time to work together. I used 3/4 cup skim milk and 1/4cup of cream so probably not as rich but still delicious!

Quadrupled it (with no ingredient changes) and all 3 of my kids LOVED it! Will definitely make again. It is thick, but can be easily thinned by adding more broth/stock.

I liked this recipe a lot since I can eat sauteed mushrooms by themselves. It was delicious! I did make a few changes though. I think the amount of onion mentioned was a little much so I used half of a medium onion. Instead of chicken broth, I used beef broth and instead of rosemary I used parsley. I also used garlic powder as a substitute for the garlic cloves since that was all I had on hand. But I would have definitely used the cloves instead if I had them. When the recipe called to process the mushrooms and onions together, I skipped this part. I like my soup a little chunky so I just roughly chopped the mushrooms after roasting. The end result had a wonderful flavor. I did change up the time on the roasting of the mushrooms though. Instead of roasting them for 15 minutes, I might would go for 12. It might be just me but the mushrooms ended up being a little too done. This is in my own opinion however. Will definitely make again!

I thought it was a different approach to the traditional mushroom soup and like always added my own personal touch, and was better than my expectations! Tasty to say the least!

I followed the recipe exactly and was really looking forward to it, but it tasted primarily like onions.  I've since checked other recipes and I am not sure why this one calls for two onions with so few mushrooms -- most other recipes call for almost 2 pounds of onions.

Roasting the mushrooms is a perfect way to elevate the flavor of this soup! I enjoyed eating this for lunch this past week, never tired of it. :) There is a lot of great mushroom flavor--with a nice subtle hint of rosemary. **I do think using a homemade (or at least a good quality) chicken stock is best and really makes a noticeable difference!

Excellent Mushroom Soup. I had been talking about making this for 3 days and my daughter didn't want me to (she's 22 and mushrooms are ok to her).  I did it anyway and she is giving it a 5, it was so funny how much she loved it. I stuck to the recipe.

Instead of minced raw garlic, I added a whole head of roasted garlic in the blender near the end.  I also found that I liked the soup smoother, so I ended up whizzing it in the food processor when I reheated it!

This is going into the rotation for sure! I used a combination of mushrooms-button mushrooms, crimini & shiitake & left the latter 2 sliced. It was heavenly.  You'll definitely want to double the recipe!!

Great Mushroom soup! Had seconds of this one! I used more mushrooms than called for because I love them. Roasting them made the house smell great too.  Will make again and again!

Yes, I love mushrooms! I added more shrooms than called for so upped the herbs as well. I roasted 1/2 an onion with everything else but cut the sautéed onion to one whole (chopped). Only had milk.....and veg broth...both I added to my preferred constancy. Plopped the stick blender in the pot and...POW! Doesn't look so pretty but taste is on point! Thank you for sharing!!

Nice taste.  Although I doubled the quantity of mushrooms when I used 1/2 &1/2 (tried to lighten the fat content a bit) instead of heavy cream, this was definitely thinner than I'd prefer and will take that into account the next time I make this.

I have tried several different mushroom soups but had try this roasted version. i love roasted veggies so I roasted a large onion quartered and separated, head of garlic, and a couple small red peppers with the mushrooms. I also doubled the amount of mushrooms and used a mix of several different types. I used the rosemary and thyme suggested as well as chicken stock. so glad I doubled it, it was yummy. I froze the remaining soup in a muffin tin for individual servings later.  I put a frozen serving of soup in a microwave safe dish in the morning and by lunchtime it is thawed just enough to heat up and enjoy. thanks for the idea.

This recipe was great and worked wonderfully.  For once I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception--I followed another reviewer's suggestion and roasted the onions along with the mushrooms.  I'm going to triple the recipe this weekend, but this time I'm going to add chopped bacon and maybe some spinach.  Either way, it was a lovely, lovely soup.
