This soup was so good I couldn't sit still and eat it!  I am a picky eater however and I don't care for lots of things so I left out the mushrooms, thyme and mixed vegies, I just added extra carrots and potatoes.  I also added a little extra liquid at the end as it got real thick.  I served it with crusty bread and a fruit salad-awesome!

My family loved this!  I did make some slight changes though.  I omitted the frozen vegetables and instead added a handful of fresh string beans snapped into small pieces.  I also added a tablespoon and a half of chicken boullion (granules)for a little more flavor.
This recipie was easy, healthy & hearty.  Thanks!

Really nice soup.  I didn't use mushrooms (hubby hates them) and I honestly didn't miss them.  I did find that the beef taste needed a bit of a boost so right at the end of cooking I added a shot of beef base concentrate.  That was exactaly what the receipe needed.  Next time I think I will start with 3 cups of chix stock and 2 cups of beef stock to approximate what I did this time.

My husband says he’s a meat and potato man. He says soup doesn’t fill him up. He likes this!!!! I sauté the vegetable along with the meat and warm the broth in the same pan to use the drippings. This is definitely a keeper. 
This works great in a crock pot.

i thought this soup was really good. i cooked the barley first because i didn't have the quick cooking kind. i also added some celery and a little more chicken broth at the end because i thought the soup was too quick. yum.

As with all recipes, I first try them 'as is' even if I've read other reviewers' comments. The soup is thick, almost no broth, not as flavorful and the beef is still chewy though the vegies are perfect. Next time, I stewed the beef in advance so it holds its shape but falls apart when bitten into, adding it and the juices in last 20 min to warm and integrate. I used 4 cups of beef broth and 3 cups of water. I prefer more carrots, so I used 2 cups and omitted the mushrooms and frozen vegies. It was perfect. I still give Melanie kudos for providing a good base recipe!

Felt the soup didn't have a lot of depth to it.  I added a tin of crushed tomatoes and about a tablespoon each of thyme, parsley and a couple of bay leaves, let it simmer for an extra couple of hours then it was good to go.  Good base recipe but needed the extra herbs.  Thanks.

Exactly what I was looking for.  Added a sliced stalk of celery with the onion and used beef broth instead of chicken.

Giving 4 stars for the modifications I made.  I doubled the water and broth, but then that came out too thin a broth for my liking, so I took out a couple of cups of the broth and whisked in about 2 tbsp of cornstarch, added back to the soup and boiled for 2 minutes, then served.  This made it a nice consistency with a good amount of broth.  I also used homemade chicken broth, olive oil instead of veg, doubled the garlic (next time I'll add more) and didn't put in the mushrooms (don't care for them).  Mine was done in an hour.  Was really good and filling!

This soup was very easy to make. I didn't have any stew meat on hand but I did have a london broil which I cut up to one inch cubes and followed the rest of the recipe and I doubled the liquid ingredients. When it came time to taste test, I thought that it missed a little something. I reviewed other recipes and noticed that tomatoes or tomato sauce was added. I used a can of tomato sauce and let it simmer a little longer. If you like liquid in your soup, I would definitely double or triple the liquid ingredients because the barley does like to soak it up. Everyone loved this soup and requested I make it often.

You really do need to add bouillon cubes or packets to this...but then it's great.  My husband gave it 4 1/2 stars...he said it needed a bit more flavor and I had already added 3 beef boullion cubes. I mixed and matched some frozen veggies I had and didn't do mushrooms. Quick and easy too!

This was good. Not amazing, but decent. We actually had some cooked filet mignon that needed using so I chopped that up for the meat. Not sure I would make this again but my husband did like it.

This is also terrific made with lamb stock instead of the canned broth. Lamb bones are very cheap and easy to use for making stock, and if the bones are meaty enough, you can use the lamb meat in the soup instead of beef. Lamb and barley go really well together--give it a try!

This recipe made the best stew/soup I have ever had.  I just cut back the water a little and threw the whole thing in a crock-pot for a few hours.  The flavor is great.

This is a good base recipe. I left out the mushrooms since my family doesn't like them and added more carrots and more veg. I also used home made BEEF stock -- certainly chicken stock would only detract from the beef flavor I was looking for. Also, I think the recipe should state whether to use regular barley or the quick cooking kind. I used regular myself.

This is a great soup!
I opted to bulk up on the carrots and potatoes instead of adding a frozen veggie mix, just because that's what I had on hand...
Also, I added a couple of beef boullion cubes with the stock and water to add a little more flavor.
This was a great base for me to play around with.

This soup was perfect as a main dish paired with a salad and/or bread. I've made it a couple of times, and both my fiance and daughter LOVED it. Anything that gets finished even as leftovers is a plus in my book! A couple things that I did differently:

1. Added an ENTIRE package of mushrooms instead of a 1/2 cup
2. Used 2 cups of beef stock, 1 cup of chicken stock, and 1 cup of water as the soup base
3. Omitted red potatoes

This is a great recipe that I will continue to use again and again!

I made this in the crock pot, not pre-cooking anything.  I put it together the night before, but did not add the barley or frozen veggies until the next  morning, right before cooking.  I added all the ounces of liquid together, put in TWO cans of beef broth and then made up the rest of the liquid with water.  I added extra garlic.   I did 3/4C of barley and next time will add at least 1C.  This turned out DELICIOUS!  I'm very pleased with this recipe... there was minimal preparation and yet it tasted like I'd been cooking all day (which technically I was!).

My whole family loved this. It was very easy, versaitle and delicious!. I used 2c beef bullion broth and 3c chicken bullion broth to start and it was enough. I used what veggies I had on hand. 
This made a nice warm stew (too thick to be a soup.)

Very good, although I did make quite a few changes. I added a can of diced tomaotes and 3 cups of tomato juice. I also left out the bag of frozen vegetables and instead put in 1 cup of corn and 1 cup of chopped zucchini. And I changed the chicken broth to beef broth. After all, it's beef soup, right?? Soooo hearty and good.

I used beef broth instead of chicken and water and added some other veggies (diced tomatoes, squash, Swiss chard stems). Found the broth to be bland so I added a mushroom soup recipe starter at the end and let it simmer for about 2 hours total.  Came out really nice.  Thanks!

The only change I made was to substitute some of the water with beef broth, which I had on hand. I  would do that again. Also, next time I'm not going to add the second amount of oil after the meat is browned. I don't think it's needed.

Easy and delicous -- but I made a few changes:  for 5 hrs. I slowcooked 2 1/2 lbs. stew beef - cut up with a big dash of worcestershire sauce, garlic and basil; 5 cups beef broth (because I couldn't get the 6th cup to fit in my crock pot); italian frozen veggies (cut up a little); definitely keep the stewed tomatoes and cut up onion, a small can of corn and a small can of peas.  I cooked the quick barley separately (and left in the 'fridge until the last heat through.)  I will make this recipe until May (because that's when the snow melts around here!)

I did not like this at all, but I'm a picky eater.  I would have liked a thicker liquid with more flavor and less grease.  My husband ate it and said he liked it.  I cooked it in a crock pot for Sunday lunch.  It was VERY fast and easy.  I used all fresh vegetables (instead of canned or frozen) and it was easy to make early in the morning.  Perfectly cooked by the time I got home from church.  I gave the leftovers to my family -- they liked it, so maybe I'm the odd one out?

Needed to add double the amount of water and broth as after forty five minutes all the liquid had almost boiled off even just simmering. Also just for myself, I added a few drops of Tabasco. Fantastic!

5 stars with these tweaks:  Substitute raw meat with cooked leftover pot roast, add last 15 minutes of cooking time.  Add two stalks of chopped celery and extra seasoning:  one tsp each of thyme leaves, oregano, and basil.  Use one ea 32 oz low sodium chicken and beef broth.  Simmer one hour, add 1/2 cup diced tomatoes and then bag of frozen mixed veggies. Simmer 15 min then add  pot roast.  Simmer 15 minutes; add water if needed.

I did not use the frozen vegetables and added extra carrots and potatoes. Also, I used unsalted beef broth as I'm on a heart healthy diet and did not use salt to season the beef. Lots of pepper, about four large cloves of garlic and a couple of bay leaves. Quite delicious and lots for me to store for future meals!

I made this soup it reminded me of my Moms. My husband loved it an he loved the thickness specially good on a cold winter night. It was the only one I could find that didn't have a darn Tomatoes base to it  since I am  not crazy for to tomatoes I was very very happy. It was quick an easy too
