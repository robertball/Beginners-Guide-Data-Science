Comida Chicken Haiku: "This meal surprised me. Didn't change one single thing. Ended up awesome!" I boldly bought oyster sauce a condiment that I've never had around b4 in anticipation of trying out this recipe and I'm delighted that I did b/c we ended up absolutely loving this meal! I can only imagine that swapping out a variety of vegetables would yield just as delicious results so no question we plan on making this again.

Delicious & easy to prepare! Dipping the chicken in flour is a great idea. I did not have any cauliflower but it still came out great. It will be on my dinner menu list:)

I was pessimistic about this recipe - the idea of just soy sauce and oyster sauce making it good was a long stretch I THOUGHT! But I must say I Really liked this! Of course I added some additional spices as I do to every recipe (garlic pwdr onion pwrd white pepper) and did use some jarred ginger paste and hot pepper flakes. But it was delicious! Good base recipe! I would ensure you don't cut the chicken into too small of pieces or they can get overcooked by the time bigger ones are done thoroughly. I even used frozen Normandy mix veggies with the fresh zucchini since that's all I had and it still turned out good! I also just used a 90 second packet of microwave brown rice/quinoa from Costco to save time. I will definitely be making this again and again. Tip: if you are watching salt use some unsalted chicken broth/stock and less soy and oyster to taste!

Typical Asian food and not that outstanding for me.
