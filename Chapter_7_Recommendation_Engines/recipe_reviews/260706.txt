Excellent flavor that does not overpower the salmon.  For my children I left out most of the sweet chili sauce, good flavor with a touch of spice, they devoured it. I especially loved the marinated slaw as an accompaniment. (I was unable to grill this, so I placed each fillet in foil and loosely wrapped it up, baked at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes before broiling it for about two minutes. It was perfectly cooked.).  I will definitely make again.  Easy weeknight meal if you premix the marinade.  (As a side note, I love this marinade—it tastes almost exactly like the Kung Pao chicken sauce that Pei Wei makes.  I’m going to try it on chicken wings!)
