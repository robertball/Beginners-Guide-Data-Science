My friend made this last night and it was THE BEST thing I've tasted in a long time. Understand that I am 1) a huge dijon mustard fan 2) an asparagus freak. It was a great combination. She didn't change the recipe at all and it turned out great. We ate it as a main course with a spring salad. 10 stars.

This one got rave reviews from my taste testers. It will definitely go into rotation in my appetizers collection.  One thing I did change was that I cut the puff pastry in half lengthwise to make two longer tarts.  I baked them side by side on the same sheet, but this way, you don't end up with any soggy middle pieces and its easy to slice and serve for a stand up appetizer.

Very Good. I wasn't sure if I should cut the aspargus into smaller bites but the full size worked out okay. My asparagus was very thick so if yours are as well cook it a bit longer. The only problem I had was the center of the tart was soggy and the filling didn't stay on the tart well while cutting to eat. The outside edges of the tart was nice and crunchy but I think I will cook a bit longer next time to see if I can get the middle firmer. Or I might mix the mustard with the asparagus then assemble rather than spread the mustard on the tart. I really did enjoy this, flavor was nice and I liked that it was an easy clean up too. My hubby liked this too.

Oh my!! This was SO DELICIOUS!! Everyone raved about this. By far, best app I have made in a long time, maybe ever. Followed previous reviewers suggestion and cut the pastry sheets in half and made two tarts, side by side. Was not soupy at all. Also, cut the asparagus into bite sized pieces. Perfection! Would not change anything else. Can't wait to make this again...

I'm always looking for new appetizers to try - and this was FANTASTIC!!  Our guests loved it - such a great medley of flavors.  I added a little olive oil and salt and pepper to the asparagus before adding the prosciutto.  I would also recommend cooking a little longer as the bottom of the tart was still a bit doughy which caused a few of the pieces to be flimsy and messy (I cut this up into appetizers pieces).  Can't wait to make this again and currently sending the recipe to family and friends!

I served this recipe for breakfast and used a smear of hollandaise sauce instead of the mustard. It was terrific and I will make it again.

These little savory puff pastries were very rich and heavy.  It also took a lot longer to brown and cook than listed.  When I thought they were done, they were still a bit undercooked so I finished them off on a skillet to crisp up the bottoms and they were a bit more enjoyable.  However, they are too rich for my taste.

This comes together nicely but if I was to make it again I would find something to use besides the mustard as it was just to much mustard for my taste

This was a big hit with my husband and guests but I thought it was pretty blah, also really should be served warm, not room temp

You should add more stars, awesome. I used honey mustard and Italian seasoning, which includes rosemary/thyme, as an experiment. Just flat out excellent; the mr. loved it too ;o]  Interestingly,  I had only used puffed pastry for sweet recipes v. savory in the past. What a light and delicious crust which I suspect could be topped with all kinds of other things too. Truly thanks ;o}

We loved this.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I had used prosciutto, but I only had left over ham which I had diced and added to the top.  My boys loved it and they are not big asparagus fans.  Also as a side note, my asparagus was very thick so I cut it in half.  Very yummy!

This was delicious. I followed recipe exactly, added about 5 min to the cooking time to crisp up the pastry a little more. Next time I might cut into two strips like someone else suggested, the middle was a little bit wet, but not soggy. served it with a nice salad. Will definitely make again.

This was easy and delicious! I used stone ground mustard and it gave it a nice kick. I would totally try this with artichoke hearts.
