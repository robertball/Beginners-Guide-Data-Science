This recipe calls for too much applesauce to give it a good muffin texture.   I cut the applesauce in half, and decreased bake time to 22 minutes.   This made excellent, moist bran muffins. I think raisin bran cereal could be substituted for bran cereal, or I think other dried fruit, such as cranberries, would also make a nice addition.   Also, I think next time I will sprinkle with a bit of white sugar fresh out of the oven.

The muffins baked up very nice, great texture but not sweet enough.  I used the whole egg to keep the moisture.  I would use all brown sugar next time and increase the amount.  I may also try using a sweetened raisin bran as well.  Nice muffin that I will make again with some tweaks.

I love bran muffins and these have really nice flavor.  In order to make them work for us I did make a few changes.  I used butter and whole eggs and I reduced the applesauce to 1 cup.  The cereal I used had raisins and I would absolutely add some if using a different cereal.  The next time I make them I will try using whole wheat instead of AP flour.  Thank you, Motts

A little firm but that was expected since we used applesauce instead of oil. Good flavor. Definitely a bring to the office muffin.

The muffins were perfect for our breakfast club. I found them moist and good texture. My changes were adding cinnamon 1.5 teaspoons and a handful of raisins. Will make again.

I used whole eggs and added a cup of yellow raisins  and 2 tablespoons of honey for sweetness.  These were super yummy and moist. Everyone raved about them.  Definitely a keeper!

These were ok, but very dense and definitely not one of my 2 year olds favorites and he likes almost any muffins.  I followed the recipe except split the flour with 1/2 regular and 1/2 wheat flour and also skipped the molasses because its not one of my favorites.  I followed the advice of others to try to make them sweeter by using brown sugar, but they still were quite bland.

Delicious!  Made with regular apple sauce (but added cinnamon) and used the whole eggs.  They smell incredible and were incredibly moist.  Next time I am adding raisins.
