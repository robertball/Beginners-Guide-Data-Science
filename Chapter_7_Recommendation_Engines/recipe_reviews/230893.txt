We missed the cilantro from our normal recipe, but didn't miss the sodium content!  I used thick and chunky salsa and added some extra onions (what Spanish rice doesn't have onions?).  Used a fresh Roma tomato instead of the cup of diced tomatoes.  My rice was done right at the 45 minute mark.  The family said they would enjoy it more if it was white rice, but personally, I liked the brown.  Next time I'll add some cilantro for personal family preference.

I love this recipe. I use my rice cooker. Also anytime I have leftover broth from vegetables or chicken, I use that in place of the water. I also add chopped onions, and sometimes throw in some frozen peas and carrots.

I do like this recipe but made a few small changes. I used brown rice because I did not have white.   I sautéed 1/4 chopped onion and 1/4 chopped red pepper in coconut oil. Added the rice to brown a little before adding the liquid.   Susbstituted some of the water with leftover Chicken Broth (1/4 cup) to use it up.   I used medium salsa (1/2 cup), omitted the tomatoes because I used onion and red pepper, and at the recommendation of some, added garlic powder and chili powder - 2 shakes of each.   I will make again and may add a little more of the seasoning because I love extra flavor.  I would give 5 stars but I altered the recipe.

This is really good!  I used low-sodium chick broth instead of water, added ~2/3 cup finely chopped onion and 1 chipotle pepper (canned).  Also increased the garlic to a tablespoon and added a small handful of Cilantro leaves for good measure and it was outstanding.  Attractive presentation as well.  Definitely use chunky salsa and diced tomatoes with chilies.  The only tweak I'll make next time is to cook it one full hour since the rice keeps turning out a little firm for my tastes.

Very good side dish to go with grilled steaks and Black Bean and Cucumber Salad (from this site). I sautéed half an onion and a bit of green pepper in butter before adding garlic and rice. After a couple of minutes, added other ingredients and just let it go. During the long cooking time, I was able to prepare the rest of meal. I'll make this again!

I just increased my review to three stars because I found the recipe to be ok if you turned it into something else. As written, it tasted to me like rice and salsa, not Spanish rice. But add onion, pepper, corn, black beans, green onion, and lime juice (plus salt), and it’s a pretty decent main dish salad.

I used all of the ingredients, but substituted the diced tomatoes with Chipotle diced tomatoes. Along with Herdez Salsa Casera (HOT). 
Just in case you want an extra kick of flavor ;)

This was very tasty! I do not use fresh tomatoes in the winter so I just used an additional half cup of salsa to make up for it. A very simple recipe that helped add some variety to my brown rice. Thanks!

Looking for a Spanish rice to go with the Spanish style chicken breast I was cooking.  I would never thought putting salsa in with the rice.  This was great.  I also added onions like another reviewer said.  I will make this again.

Loved this recipe. I used my frozen salsa from my garden which is in 2 cup jars instead of adding the 1 cup tomatoes. I love the chewy texture of brown rice, so this is a new favorite!

I used chicken broth instead of water and still thought it was lacking in flavor.  I think it needs more salsa and less other liquid.  I also added black olives after it was done.  Adding some bell peppers while it cooks might also help.  Like that it was brown rice though!
