I prepared this ahead of time, deliberately undercooking the beans a little so that they'd be just right when I reheated them in the microwave just before serving. I didn't want all the futzing around with caramelizing shallots, toasting almonds and blanching green beans in the midst of cooking the rest of dinner and it worked out well.  While I probably won't make beans like this routinely because it requires a little more effort, this will be something I'll remember when I want something more special.  I omitted the sugar  - there's enough in the shallots for them to caramelize on their own and I didn't want any sweetness. Once I cooked the green beans I arranged them on a serving plate, then topped them with the bell pepper/shallot mixture rather than tossing it all together.  It made for a very attractive presentation. This was definitely a welcome and delicious departure from the same old boring green beans.

I made this recipe for a holiday dinner last night. It got rave reviews.  The only comment, though, is that the recipe states that it takes 5-8 minutes for the shallots to caramelize.  It actually takes about a half hour!

These green beans were great.  I love the hint of garlic that the shallots add. I used french cut green beans and steamed them in a pan, although next time I think I'll use steamer bags in the microwave to save time and dishes. I toasted the almonds and they added great flavor.  I think next time I'll use more almonds.

I loved this!!! I did cut back on the sugar though to about 1 tbsp.  Didn't have slivered almonds but sliced and didn't have red bell pepper but green.  A keeper recipe!!!

This is my new favorite way to prepare green beans. These are delicious, and everyone at my dinner party loved them. I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar, other wise I followed the recipe as written. Caramelizing the shallots gives such a wonderful flavor to these green beans. These are going to be on my table for Thanksgiving also. Thanks for sharing this great recipe :)

This is a wonderful recipe! I didn't add the red pepper and used 2 med sized shallots otherwise followed recipe. Tip: make sure to lower the temp and maybe let the pan cool a little before adding sugar or the onion will over cook and get hard.  Did I mention this was a wonderful recipe?? Thank you!

This was absolutely amazing! I didn't use shallots too expensive but chopped white onions. I'm bringing this to my mothers Thanksgiving dinner from now on!! Great flavor even though I was tempted to use garlic but it doesn't need it!

I normally hate green beans, but my husband likes them, so I decided to try this recipe for something different. They were great (well, for green beans.)

This is a tasty, company worth vegetable dish that can easily be made ahead.  I toasted the almonds and steamed the green beans in advance, leaving the green beans just a bit crunchier than I like.  I caramelized the shallots with just a touch of sugar; 2 Tablespoons of sugar would have been way too much for my taste.  When ready to serve I warmed the shallot/red pepper mixture on the stove, briefly microwaved the green beans to warm before adding them to the shallot mixture, and sprinkled the almonds on top of the beans in the serving dish. Very good!

Normally I am not a fan of sweet dishes, but this intrigued me.  Green beans with caramelized shallots and toasted almonds?  Check!  And for some reason I could imagine a touch of sweetness working in this.  I was right!  I did like it, although I used much less sugar then the recipe called for, less then half.  The recipe amount would make this candy-sweet.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and I think that complimented the caramelization.  Also I was out of red peppers, so I substituted some jarred roasted red peppers.  That worked great.  Thanks Jen for expanding my palate and urging me to experiment with new flavor combinations!

didn't have shallots, but used some diced onions, probably a little less than 1/4 cup.  I steamed the beans & bell pepper in the microwave while I blanched the almonds and made the butter sauce.  Yum!  My 6 month old is all smiles while gnawing on a couple.  My older kids are chomping down.  They are not usually good eaters, but they got to blanch the almonds and snap the ends off the beans and put them in the steam bag then the microwave, so maybe that has something to do with it too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Modified slightly to accommodate what I had on hand, we really enjoyed this as a relatively quick and nutritious side dish tonight. I skipped the sugar (it's just to help speed the caramelizing process), used jarred roasted red pepper, and skipped the almonds since I had a lonely slice of cooked bacon to use up... I just chopped that and sprinkled on top. A nice way to dress up garden-fresh beans!

This was a huge hit at a when I made it for a client's Christmas Eve dinner for 30.  I added sauteed mushrooms and garlic to the mix and got rave reviews.  I presented the blanched beans on platters and topped with the shallot/mushroom/red pepper/garlic mixture and garnished with the toasted almonds.  Pretty, festive and very tasty.  Thanks for the inspiration Jen.  This recipe will go into my regular offerings for clients.

It was ok, I thought there was a little too much butter.  I probably won't make them again because the end output doesn't justify the amount of time.

Husband says, "You should cook green beans like this every time. These are good." Delicious. I cooked the green beans submerged in water for 10 minutes in the microwave first, but I just got a steam pot so I will be using that from now on. The sugar was a great addition.

Great side dish I used to pair with roasted chicken. Flavor is light and slightly creamy. I used frozen french cut beans and it worked well with the shallots. The almonds are absolutely the best part about this dish so do not compromise on that part! Really easy to make and it please everyone at the table! Definitely will make again soon!

I was making green beans with prime rib and mashed potatoes, found this recipe- had everything on hand, and it was fast and easy - looked fancy when done.  I used 4 shallots, a red pepper, and and small bag of slivered almonds, looked like the right amount, and a little extra sugar- why not.  I will probably cut the red pepper down to 1/2 -it was bit too much but all in all a great way to fancy up green beans. Good enough for company. It turned out delish! Exceeded my expectations, will make again.

I've made it twice, and both times I didn't use red peppers because my kids would turn their noses up at it. I also didn't use sugar...didn't see the need. It's now everyone's favorite green bean dish!

Delicious and a great side dish for company.  I suggest using 1 T sugar instead of 2, 2 T butter instead of 3.  Other than that, perfect!

Actually, I didn't use green beans.  Instead I used asparagus, yellow and zucchini squash.  Cut the squash into sticks like asparagus.  Cook the very same way - delicious!

Outstanding. Eliminate the almonds and add sauted sliced mushrooms and it becomes that elusive perfect nut-free green bean recipe for special dinners with a nut-allergic diner. Everything can be made in advance and quickly reheated. Used whole baby green beans arranged on a platter and topped with shallot/red pepper and then with mushrooms. Like many, I used less sugar (1 T demerara, but any granulated would do.)

This is very similar to something my mom used to make.  You don't need 2 TBS of sugar if your shallots are fresh.  And you can substitute a nice sweet onion like vidalia instead of shallots and it is still very nice. my kids love anything with caramelized onion on it.

The absolutely most delicious green bean dish I have ever eaten! My husband who normally doesn't like green beans even liked them! I used the steam in microwave bag of fresh green beans and that worked perfectly.  I found myself going for a second helping before I even cut into the pork chops I made to go with them! Yummy.

Very happy with this. The significant other isn't a big fan of veggies, but even so these were a hit. They were simple to make and the almond flavor was very good. Simple enough, but looked and tasted like a lot more work.

I doubled the recipe because we had so many fresh beans to use from the garden. No shallots so used 3 green onions and a white onion. Only had one red bell pepper so used one yellow bell pepper too. Cut down some on the sugar after reading other reviews, but didn't actually measure anything. Also I had whole almonds and slivered them myself. Got rave reviews and everyone going back for seconds, even the guy who doesn't like unusual things and my teenage daughters.

My sister makes these to go with Christmas dinner and everyone loves them. She says they're super easy to make, too. Some of the pictures on here look as if the beans were overdone, but hers are always tender-crisp and bright green.

unfortunately i wasn't impressed with this and green beans are one of my favorite veggies.. i left out the sugar b/c we don't like sweet.. even with the almonds i still felt like it was lacking.. i gave in and just added a three cheese blend of parm, romano, and asiago.. had added a couple cloves of garlic in the beginning and a combo of margarine and olive oil instead of butter.. maybe if the green beans had been sauteed instead of steamed it would have more flavor? i'm not sure..

Unexpectedly really yummy...I hadn't ever tried sugar with my green beans before.  I altered it by using less sugar (1 tablespoon), less butter (a little over 1 tablespoon), substituting yellow onions for shallots, sliced instead of slivered almonds (so I didn't blanch them), and french style green beans (so I didn't steam them ahead of time, just stirred them in).  It turned out really good.  Next time, might try a hint of lemon or vinegar for added tangy flavor  and try olive oil instead of butter.

So delicious! I added a bit of canned diced tomato to produce a little extra sauce. I even refrigerated leftovers for several days, and it was still yummy.

This side dish is absolutely amazing. We could have eaten this as our whole meal and been perfectly happy!  Looks beautiful too. I paired it with the balsamic and caper pork tenderloins and mashed potatoes for a meal that looked professional. Will absolutely be making this again!

I'm not a big green bean fan but my husband likes them. I made this recipe last night and couldn't get over how delicious it was. I woke up craving them!  Really the best green beans I've ever had - bar none!

I read the reviews before I made this, which really helped! Like others, I prepared the almonds, shallots, and red pepper ahead of time and heated them up the next day while steaming the green beans. The dish added color to the plate, and was delish! I will definitely make it again.

Loved it.  I steamed the beans until barely tender so I could reheat later.  Heated up very well.  Otherwise no other changes to recipe.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and a guest requested I make it the next week for New Years Eve dinner at their house.  A big hit and a keeper for special occasions.  Changes I made were based on feedback from other reviewers:  To make it healthier, I added no sugar and used olive oil instead of butter.  It just took longer for the shallots to caramelize, about 20-25 minutes.  To assist the caramelization process, add a bit more salt and a bit of water.   Also because of the longer cooking time, start the shallots first and then add red pepper halfway through.  I cut the oil by a third the second time as I thought they were a tad too greasy the first time.  I also used french green beans the second time as they are more tender.  Next time I may buy almonds already toasted as they are easy to burn.   I burned half of them the first time around.

I made this for Christmas Dinner & it was delicious.  Everyone loved it.  It was equally good when we had it for leftovers (unfortunately only 2 servings were leftover). The only change I made was to toast the almonds in oven.  I will definitely make this again as it is tasty, pretty & colorful.   It is a little time consuming for a regular meal, but a winner when you want to dress it up a little.

My husband and I usually prefer savory green bean dishes, but I wanted to mix it up.  We give the recipe (made as written) a double thumbs up, even though we won't put it on the regular rotation.   I would definitely make this for company or to take to a potluck.

Delicious!  I needed to double the recipe for a holiday meal, and it was a hit.  I felt the recipe didn't need as much sugar, so I reduced it by a third.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't disappointed.

only thing I did was substitute extra light virgin olive oil for the butter and maybe only 2 TBSP, I only blanched the beans for 7 minutes as I was  using for lunches to reheat and also to make it easier I bought the salad toppings of the toasted almonds. also cut out the sugar and used 1/2 diced red onion. SOO Yummy! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

A winner on the first try but I think you can cut back the amount of butter and sugar.   The shallots and peppers are great without any help.
