I wish I took a picture of this.  I made it before I knew it was on this site.  I got the recipe from the Hillshire Farm site. I made it about a month ago and just recently got the stuff to make it again.  It's such a simple recipe and very yummy meal.  I served it over basmati rice.  I used a mixture of colored bell peppers which made it very eye appealing as well. It will be a staple in my house.  You could sub Ham or Chicken for the meat.

This is a winner!  We came home started the rice in the rice cooker and tossed this together in just a couple of minutes.  I used Hillshire Farms Smoked Turkey sausage (delish) and added a little sliced onion that I had left over, along with the peppers. I used canned pineapple chunks packed in juice, not syrup.  Next time I will cut the sausage rounds in half or even quarters for easier eating and to brown them all over.  So easy, full of flavor.  The kiddos barely had time to wash up before dinner was ready.  Everyone loved it!

This was a quick and dead easy recipe to make.  I used a couple of tablespoons of canola oil and browned the sausage on medium high, then added Green pepper and Onions (not called for but should be), while stir frying for some minutes (didn't count).  Then I mixed a teaspoon or so of corn flour into the pineapple juice and allowed to slightly thicken, stirring until peppers and onions were  slightly crunchy.  Finally I added the Chili Garlic Sauce and heated through.  Served over white rice.  Delicious indeed.  The next time I make this I shall use pineapple with syrup as I think the pineapple flavor needs to be brought out more.
I have now made this two times and have it perfected to my liking.   For my liking the recipe has too much meat so I split the meat lengthwise and then cut into sections.  Then I browned the meat on med high for a few minutes , adding 2 each chopped green peppers and onion (not called for), then stir frying until partially cooked.  Then I thickened the syrup from a 20 oz can of pineapple, and added this to the skillet with the pineapple chunks.  Finally I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and the chili garlic sauce and blended. This made two batches and several days worth of meals.

Great recipe!!!! Not advised for children though.... the chilie garlic sause is way to spicy for children.... instead if you are making this dish for children I would use a jar of sweet and sour sauce and add garlic with maybe just a little chilli powder. For the adults this dish is perfect... will be making this again!!!!

This was so much better than I thought it would be! I added about 2 cloves minced garlic to the pan first with butter, to release the flavor, then added Eckrich turkey sausage, red pepper & about 1/4 of a large onion.  I used a 20-oz can of pineapple chunks and reserved 1/2 C of the juice & added it with 1 T. of hoison sauce.  I, too, could not find sweet chili/garlic sauce but had sweet Thai chili sauce. This really isn't a sweet & sour recipe, it was just sweet with a little chili kick. I made a total pig of  myself, it was just that good!

Very good and simple. I only had canned pineapple in juice. I drained it and added a little of the juice and Hoisin to the sauce, just because I like the flavor. I also sprinkled on some parsley at the end. Very good and easy. Sweet with some heat:)

My mom made something very similar to this when I was growing up, but she used pineapple juice and cooked the sausage in it until it became thick.  I adapted the recipe and put in the mini sweet peppers as mentioned here, along with onions - usually red, and sometimes some broccoli crowns if I have them on hand with pineapple juice and pineapple chunks and a little bit of garlic.  I also used the sweet thick soy sauce instead of the regular one and add that to it as well.  Once  it is thick, I put it over basmati rice with the tops of some fresh green onions chopped and added a little of fresh cilantro. Next time I think I will try adding the chili sauce along with the thick sweet soy. Delicious and very easy;  thanks for bringing back memories.....will be making this very soon again!

The way I understand it is a sweet and sour sauce is usually made of sugar, ketchup, white vinegar, and soy sauce, and additional ingredients can include pineapple, green pepper (capsicum), and onion. This is too sweet balanced by no sour?

The first time I try a recipe I always make it exactly as it is written.  This was SO GOOD!  The pineapple paired with the Keilbasa was awesome!  Next time, I might add a little broccoli.  I used white rice with my husband's and brown with mine.  What an easy meal.

So easy and so good! I made a few changes: I use turkey kielbasa and brown rice to make it healthier, triple the peppers, add some crushed red pepper to a bottled sweet and sour sauce, and use canned pineapple. This is in my regular rotation now.

Quick, easy, and tastes great. I would definitely recommend adding some fresh chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime as the note suggests.

I added minced garlic, chopped onions, and cayenne pepper for some extra flavor.  Instead of using a sweet chili sauce, I used Huy Fong Chili Garlic Sauce since the pineapple already brings out the sweetness. Loved this! Will be making it again.

Absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making this again. If you don't like things spicy, I would recommend 1/8 cup of garlic chili.

My fam and I loved this!  I substituted with Turkey kelbosa and used 1/2 the amount of rice (1/2 cup  of brown rice per serving) to make it a little healthier.  It made 4 perfect portions.  I do recommend adding lime juice and cilantro for a little freshness to cut down the "sweet" (as noted in "tips", otherwise, this dish is perfect.

Turned out really great. I didn't have sweet chili sauce so I mixed a little sweet and sour sauce and it worked great. I also added an onion just because I like it. I will definitely make this again. I will add more veggies to it next time

So, this gets 5 stars!! Easy to make. However, it took me about 40 minutes to cook this. Only because of all of the prepping and cooking the rice. I was also dancing while cooking too so I guess that took up at least 10 to 15 minutes of my time LOL but I modified the recipe a little. I use teriyaki sauce instead and skipped on the garlic. ??????

Very basic recipe. It could use a little work. The chili sauce  is very overpowering. I'll still make it again but I'm going to try different things like cooking the sausage and bell pepper in sesame oil.

I loved the recipe. My wife doesn't like sausages and she had me finish her portion which was great for me. I did add red onions and garlic as my sweet chili sauce did not include garlic. I also used mangos with the Hawaiian sausage.

Ridiculous amount of flavor for so little effort! We only had canned pineapple & mixed its juice with the garlic-chili sauce to make more sauce to pour over the white rice we served with it.

Adding a half of a small habanero paper gives it a nice kick in with the sweetness of the pineapple.

i started the rice first, and in the 20 minutes that it took the rice to cook, the rest of this dish was finished! Quick and easy week night supper, but might be a little too spicy for the kiddos. I had smoked venison and pork sausage on hand, so that's what I used. Also tossed in some diced onion just because I had it on hand in the fridge. This was a welcome break from the meat & potato syndrome!

We love this super simple recipe! Only thing I change is occasionally I add some crushed red  pepper to add a little more heat and double up the meat and pineapple.  I serve over Jasmine rice and my husband always wants seconds.

I did not follow the directions and added the sauce and pineapple at the beginning. Also, did not use smoked sausage but rather Italian sausage- better the next day

This is a favorite in our home. So easy and quick, perfect for weeknights. The chili sauce is a bit spicy so I use half chili sauce and half sweet and sour sauce to accommodate my two year old. Try it!

This was incredibly easy and amazingly delicious. I cooked the sausage a bit longer since I doubled the recipe.

It does have a little kick to it so cut back on the chilli sauce as needed.

Very good, and so easy to make! I didn't have pineapple, so I used fresh peaches instead.  Also used frozen mango once.  Both substitutions tasted great.  Added fresh garlic also.

I added a small can of sliced  water chestnuts to it . It was very good! For those with sensitive palates , it is a tiny bit spicy but not punishing. It kind of reminds me of the "tingle" that comes with ginger in Chinese dishes. A definite keeper for those busy work nights. With only five ingredients and about thirty minutes  start to finish, what's not to love?

Loved it! I cooked the rice from scratch, definitely not the same if you make it on a rice cooker. I used the Cajun sausage instead of the smoked sausage, that's if you like spicy food, and turned out delicious! Definitely making it again!

This recipe is sooo good and super simple. My boyfriend likes spicy so I thought is give this a try. I used Portuguese sausage one mild one hot, I also added onion and garlic to the pan when browning the sausage. I only had chopped canned pineapple so I used a little of the juice to make the sauce. I let it boil until it thickened. I will defiantly be making this again. Thank you for sharing!

On this recipe it called for sweet chilli garlic sauce and I could only find sweet chili sauce so  other then that small change I kept this recipe as is and it was very good. I loved how easy it was. Definitely will make this again.

I just made this recipe & I will keep it in my recipe box!! I had never thought of sausage & pineapple, I'm sorry now that I hadn't!!
It is so simple & quick! I put it over Brown Rice & used light sausage,  in order to make it even healthier.
A couple of suggestions:
1. I sauteed some onion with the peppers. (Our family is big on onion.)
2. No fresh pineapple, I used canned. I may even use crushed pineapple in the future! 
3. I didn't have the sauce, so I used the juice from the pineapple. Delicious!

Thank you for such a great recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and would not change anything. What a great easy and quick dinner packed with flavor with an Asian flair.

Wow! Yes, it is definitely spicy but Oh so good! I used ingredients on hand, i.e. 16 oz. canned pineapple tidbits and frozen pepper & onion stir fry and a Japanese stir fry. Once everything integrated itself, it came out excellent! As a reviewer commented, if you don't like it spicy, omit the chili and garlic sauce.

This would be fun with Little Smokies, too! I plan on using a variety of colored peppers for Variety. :)
