Yum to (almost) anything with yams in it!  I added the same amount of sliced potatoes.  I used the whole zucchini, the whole yellow squash and the whole red bell pepper (only).   Seasonings were excellent.  It would become 5 stars with more cheese on top!!

This was one of those times when I actually had all the ingredients listed for a veggie dish, so I made it exactly according to the recipe. Next time I might add a clove of minced garlic, but otherwise this was a nice twist on the usual broiled veggie recipe. I used a mandolin, which really sped up the chopping process and I cut the yams slightly thinner than the other veggies. It's a bright, pretty dish (see photos) and all around fairly easy to prep, not to mention super healthy. I think it would be fine to sub olive oil for the butter, though it does add a bit of flavor. BTW this makes your house smell so good!  I will make this again. Thanks Pegzhere!

Very healthy but just a little mushy for us. Maybe i overcooked the veggies because my house smelled so good!!! Think next time I will add a red potato and some carrots. We ate the whole thing and am thankful for the recipe:)

When everyone asks at the party "who made the fiesta casserole," you know you have a hit. This was an amazing potluck side to add to bread/meat based dishes for versatility. It's so so easy and I can see how it could be made with whatever you've got but I think the yams are key! Also, don't skip that butter step but if you do and the crust is burnt like mine, just add more butter and cheese on top. A little crisp is nice.

I loved it. I under cooked the yams a little so they they would not be mushy and added mushrooms.

Pretty good but mushy and not that flavourful.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and the vegetables came out perfectly.  I paired it with the baked dijon salmon from this site. The sweet yams and honey/pecan from the salmon were a great combo! Thank you for the recipe,  we will definitely be making this again soon!

Delicious, healthy recipe. Especially liked the flavor the yam added.
