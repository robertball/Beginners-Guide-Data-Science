This dish is great- simple to make and very tasty.  
I tested this recipe with about 1/2 pound of carrots, 1 tbsp of syrup and 1 tbsp of butter.  It was great.  Then I prepared the dish with the quantities listed and it was a lot less flavorful.  I recommend doubling the amount of syrup and butter for a 2 lb bag of carrots.   I also added pecans, which gave it a little twist of additional flavor.

I liked the flavor, however, I made a couple modifications that made these carrots awesome.  First, I roasted them with olive oil and salt at 375 for about 20 minutes, stirred and then turned the temp up on the oven to 425 for another ten minutes or so, or until tender.  I then heated about two tablespoons of butter in a skillet on med high heat and added the carrots as well as two to three tablespoons of maple syrup. I let it bubble a little bit, stirring frequently, and the butter and syrup carmelized together, forming a very tasty, carmel.  I served immediately.  They were great like this!

I tried this recipe thinking that the maple syrup would really spruce up the basic sweetened carrots that I have been making for years. It did not. Aside from the amounts listed not being enough maple syrup and butter, the texture of the sauce was quite runny compared to the way I make it and also more expensive to make. I use butter or margarine along with either light or brown sugar with my carrots and they are so much better and also less expensive to make. I then add parsley to them primarily to dress them up and make them more appetizing to look at. I will continue to make what I call "candied carrots" using my method.

This recipe was disappointing. There just wasn't much maple flavor. The carrots tasted like carrots  and not like they had anything on them. Sorry, I doubt that we will be having them again.

I, too, doubled the maple syrup and butter and added pecans.  Very delicious and easy!  Is already a family favorite for us.  Chris

Good simple recipe.  Adds a little sweetness to the carrots without overpowering them.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for.  I made this when we had company and I didn't want to serve plain carrots.  The amount of syrup and butter was just right to give a unique taste while still letting the flavor of the carrots come through.  Everyone loved them...there were no left overs!

This was very plain tasting. I tried adding more syrup like others suggested, but i found that the recipe was just too simple and tastes like it's missing something.

Excellent, and so simple! Even picky veggie eaters will love these carrots. I doubled the maple syrup and butter for a 2-lb bag of carrots. I cooked my carrots about 3 hrs before dinner, putting them aside. I was roasting a pork loin. Just before serving time, and while the oven was still hot, I put the carrots that I had tossed and coated with the syrup/butter mixture in a baking dish, popped them into the oven until good and hot. They were a perfect side dish to my pork loin. Loads of compliments, and so easy!

What a neat idea!  I love this recipe because I'm always looking for new ways to jazz up the viggies...(with two toddlers that are anti-vegetable).  Thanx for the recipe. :)

Wonderful...I even used sugar free maple syrup and light butter made with canola oil (Land O'Lakes). I added a little salt and pepper and VIOLA...so easy and so yummy!

This was really easy, but my husband & I didn't love it- it wasn't quite the carrot recipe I was looking for.  If it sounds good to you, I recommend you try it though.  We give it 3-1/2 stars.

An easy fix to plain old carrots.  Great as a side to a more complex meal, or for something as simple as fried chicken

My hubby and I also enjoyed this recipe.
We also added extra syrup and butter since 
the carrots we used were not very sweet.

This recipe tastes great. I did substitute agave syrup for maple syrup. I am making this several days ahead and think that in doing so will make the flavors incorporate nicely. Simple and delicious.

A simple classic, that allows for a change in side dishes. Very Tasty. I added a bit of honey with the syrup for a less maple taste

My DH cooked dinner that night, and I believe he added too much butter, so the sauce with a little runny.  I couldn't detect much maple flavour, they mostly just tasted sweet to me.  I would probably try to make these again, and I would consider not using butter at all.
