I was a little worried about the stuffing because it was fairly dry when I put it on the pork, but, it was perfectly moist once the pork was cooked.  I couldn't find the cranberry jam, so, I used whole berry cranberry sauce instead.   I cooked the pork to about 150 degrees for our taste because we don't prefer it well done.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really tasty recipe. My husband loved the spicy flavor. 
 Instead of 2 jellies I used Trader Joe's Cranberry Jalapeno Sauce and dried cranberries.
