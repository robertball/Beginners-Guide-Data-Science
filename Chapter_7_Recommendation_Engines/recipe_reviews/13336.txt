This is a great basic taco soup recipe! To lengthen how far this goes add an extra can of tomatoe sauce, another cup of water, omit 1 pound of ground beef, add 1-2 more cans of rinsed, drained beans and more taco seasoning to taste.I also never use corn and sub in-you guessed it-more beans! I typically use these 3 beans in one batch- red kidney beans, garbanzo beans and black beans. But ANY bean will work here! Kick the flavor up by adding a small well drained can of diced green chilis and chopped olives. Put a dollop of sour cream and small handful shredded chedder in each bowl just before serving. Don't forget the hot sauce on the side for heat lovers! Thanks Patricia for such a fun, versatile recipe!

The only reason I didn't rate this recipe higher is because I don't think you can really call it "soup." I followed the recipe exactly. It's fast and easy and it tastes very good, but it's a very thick consistency, almost like a chili or a dip. You could probably even use it in taco shells or soft tortillas as a filler. We topped it with sour cream, green onions, and cheese & served with  tortilla chips. It does freeze well, and I will make it again. It just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

Great recipe, used Ranch style beans instead of plain pinto beans. Added more tomatoes. Simmered a bit longer and added 8 cups of water to make it more soup like. Served with sour cream and fritos. Awesome leftovers.

This is the perfect taco soup -- nice and thick, and no kidney beans (I cant stand them!). I didnt like to use as much corn as called for, personal preference, and I also added garlic & my own spices as other reviewers had said.... I like my Mexican food with a nice heat, so I loaded in the cayenne and chili powder, cumin, red pepper flakes, etc. Leftovers are fantastic as well! Yum!

This is wonderful and is now one of my family's favorites!  I gave it 4 stars because I had to add more tomato sauce and water (one 15 oz. can of each).

This is a good recipe when you are tired of the regular tacos.  It's also a good busy weeknight meal when you don't have a lot of time to spend on dinner.  I found that this is more like a chili than a soup, and I added about 1.5 cups of chicken broth I had to use up and a can of water to thin it out some more.  Even with all that extra liquid, it was still pretty thick.  I also added about 2 cloves of chopped garlic, and extra chili powder and cumin, since one taco packet will flavor only 1 lb. of ground beef.  I served this by breaking some tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowls, adding the soup and topping with shredded cheese and sour cream.  Everyone enjoyed this, and I will make it again!  Thanks!

I always add the taco seasoning to the ground round just after it has browned.. makes a diff. somehow.  Also add a chopped green or yellow bell pepper.  Carrots would be good too, as a poster mentioned below.

Very tasty and easy soup.  I also added a can of beef broth.  Would be a good way to use up leftovers.  I also added 1/2 chopped onion, sliced carrot and some celery to get more vegies.

Very good and quick.  I made a few of changes.  I used black beans instead of pintos and used more tomato sauce instead of tomato puree( kids don't like tomatoes), I also left out the onion and used onion powder.  I also think next time I will add a little more taco seasoning.

This was quick, easy and yummy!  Great for a busy weeknight meal.  Topped with sour cream, shredded cheddar and sliced black olives.  Had cantina chips for dipping.  Could see adding shredded lettuce to the topping, just to add some greens.  Will make again.  Thanks!

I used this recipe to use up some vegetables in my fridge. So, I added celery, carrots, green pepper & cabbage. I didn't have beef so I just used some stewing beef. The whole thing was put in the crock pot. It was delicious.

This was a quick and easy recipe. We all loved it. I added cheeese, and we diped in nacho chips. Very good will make it many more times. I did have to add one extra can of tomato sauce. So make sure you have enough. (It still came out very thick.)

After reading other reviews, I subbed 1 qt homemade tomato puree + 1 cup of water for the puree and sauce called for, along with 1 put of homemade chicken bone broth.  I used 4 Tbsp of homemade taco seasoning (another allrecipes recipe - 2 tbsp per pound of beef) and I used 1 drained can of organic black beans and one of organic kidney beans (I'm not a fan of pintos).  I also used a couple of handfuls of frozen corn instead of the canned corn.  I mixed guacamole into the bowls of soup and it was SO good.  My husband said this is his new favorite soup recipe.  Thanks so much, I'm sure this is going to be a new frequent favorite in our home.

This more like a thick Chili rather than a soup.  Very easy to put together and can easily be adapted to what you have on hand.  I agree with another reviewer.  Cooked the meat (drain the grease if there is any)  and added the taco seasoning to the meat and onions - stir and cook that for a bit before adding the other ingredients.   You could add broth, diced green chilies, carrots, zucchini, cabbage - but that would be a different recipe, wouldn't it?

This was a good and easy soup that uses ground beef, but I substituted Johnsonville mild Italian sausage for the beef.  I removed the casings and broke it up with a wooden spoon while cooking.  It was really good!

Used beef broth instead of water, black beans instead of pinto and added a dash of chili powder.  Hearty and delicious!  My sons ate it with Fritos Scoops.  Moving this to our Favorites!!!!

This is now my favorite soup! I was looking for a recipe to use tomato puree I had drained off a big can of tomatoes I was drying to make raw ketchup (which didn't turn out). I omitted the tomato sauce so I could use more puree. So I had to add extra spices. I just kept tasting and adding until it was right! My family doesn't care for onions, but I do use onion powder and I did put in a couple dashes of garlic. I also added more beans and some leftover rice. All that to say this is a great basic recipe that can be tweaked to your taste!
