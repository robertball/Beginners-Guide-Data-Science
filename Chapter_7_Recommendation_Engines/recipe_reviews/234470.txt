A lady I knew several years ago made the best corn pudding. I looked for a recipe with ingredients similar to the ones she used and I found this one. I tried it last Thanksgiving and it was great. Making it again this year!

I've made this dish twice now and have had an empty dish each time. It's delicious just as it is...no changes.

I made this corn pudding for Easter. It turned out soupy and did not set in the middle.  Regardless, people like it.
