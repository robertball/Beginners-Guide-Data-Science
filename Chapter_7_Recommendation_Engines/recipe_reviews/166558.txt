Delicious and pretty as a picture! Just a wonderful blend of color and fresh flavors. Light, just right creamy sauce--not thick or too rich.  I didn't measure precisely, just kind of eyeballed the ingredients trying to keep in proportion to the amount specified in the recipe. I didn't have cayenne, so substituted a couple shots of Tabasco sauce instead. Served over a bed of hot, buttered spaghettini (thin spaghetti) and "Baked Zucchini de Provence"(also from this site), this was a dish I'd be confident to serve to anyone. And it comes together easily with just a few fresh ingredients--cooking the pasta takes longer than it does to prepare the dish itself!

All I can say is I am HAPPY to have found this recipe, it is wonderful! Very well balanced and flavorful, not to mention easy. The sauce is incredible! I will be making this over and over. Here's a hint though, you can also make it with boneless chicken breasts, sliced into bite size pieces. If you like mushrooms, they are a great addition. Thanks so much for this one!!

This is one of favorite recipes.  I do a few changes though:  I use olive instead of butter, use fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream for a more slimming version, use whole wheat pasta & Parmesan cheese. turn everything off and let it sit for 5 munutes or so to let the noodles soak out the sauce.  A very yummy recipe!

Incredibly delicious!  I made it with low fat margarine and cream and served it over whole wheat pasta - making it a very healthy main dish.  I will definitely make this again!  But the portion really was only enough for me and my husband.  I'd probably double it for 4 people.

This is a great company and family friendly recipe. I can't have garlic, so I sub with shallots or sweet onions. When cooking shrimp, don't overcook. It gets rubbery really fast. It should form a "C" not an "O" when done. If they curl up and look like "O's", they are overcooked. This is also cooked with lobster meat or crab. Living on Puget Sound as I do, I use the Dungeness Crab. (Fresh, not canned.) I've made this recipe for about forty years. Delish!

I used whole wheat fettuccine noodles and tripled the sauce as I wanted to be able to soak up a crusty bread in it.  I also used margarine instead of butter.  Used the salt, pepper and cayenne pepper to taste until it was what we were looking for.  Family loved.  Thanks

4 stars only because I think there should be a little more liquid (sauce) in this meal. If your making over angel hair pasta then it should be enough but I like to have a little more sauce with my pasta. Other than that this is a GREAT and QUICK meal to make. Even had a 5 and 7 year old happy!

After trying this last night, this is going to be a new favorite for us! When I asked my boyfriend what he wanted to have tonight he said, "Can we have what we had last night again?" 
I had to leave out the green onions because mine had gone to mush and I used light cream instead of heavy (probably why the sauce didn't thicken like I had wanted) - but mmm. Great quick dinner. Thanks!

Absolutely divine! I replaced half the butter with olive oil and used whole milk instead of cream, because that's what I had on hand. I made 1 1/2 the amount of sauce, added a little cajun seasoning plus mushrooms & broccoli. We served with fettucine. This was delicious! The sauce is quite light but with a nice richness. Thank you so much for a great recipe. We will be making this often!

Great for a nice Sunday meal - used vegetable broth instead of wine. I doubled the sauce and was glad I did as it wouldn't have been enough if I didn't.  Added more salt, asiago cheese, and red pepper flakes to give it a little heat.

This dish was fantastic. I often times change a recipe on the first try and add my favorites but I stuck to the writing this time. It came out fabulous! Actually, I did use half and half for health conscious cooking and the sauce thickened well. I am usually very critical of my cooking and I couldn't find anything lacking in this dish. I can't believe how much of it I ate!

Very good recipe, although I did make modifications. I added some baby scallops to the shrimp. Also threw in some dried oregano and basil, as I thought spices were lacking. Replaced the tomatoes with some finely diced red and yellow pepper, let it cook down a little bit. Topped the whole thing with parmesan cheese at the end. Delish!

So good!! Even my picky 3 year old liked this. It was really easy to make too. I had to peel and devein the shrimp myself, so it took me longer than twenty minutes prep. Will make again.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!! Only used 1/2 pound of shrimp and 2 TBLS of butter but kept everything else the same so there would be enough sauce for the two of us. Used half and half instead of cream but ended up throwing in a bit more at the end. SHEER GENIUS to cook the shrimp and then take it out of the pan as the sauce cooks. Ended up tasting better than most restaurant dishes I've had!! Definitely worth making again and again! (Oh, and quick, too!)

made as written except used broth in place of wine.  It was ok but not exceptional.  I have enough for today too but will not be making it again.  Thank you though for sharing it with us.

I’ve made this three times now, but haven’t reviewed it until now.  I’m giving it 5 stars because we’ve really enjoyed this in the past.  But when I made it a few nights ago, it didn’t really WOW me.  I’m not deducting any stars because I’ve learned that there are so many variables in cooking, a dish can often change from one time to another -  different tomatoes, different wine, etc.  I’ve made it with canned tomatoes and fresh and both are good. I doubled the sauce this time and served it over thin spaghetti.   I know we’ve enjoyed this very much in the past, so I know I’ll be making it again!

This is one of my favorite shrimp recipes! It mixes sweet, creamy, and spicy into the best possible combination. Definitely double the sauce, maybe even triple if you're serving over pasta. Enjoy =)

This is a great dish!!  I added mushroom (as we love mushrooms) along with the green onions and garlic.  I also doubled the sauce as others said.  I also added a extra tomatoe,a bit more garlic and I seasoned my shrimp in old bay and garlic powder before cooking them. I have made this dish a couple of times and it will stay in my recipe box!!

I make this recipe often.  It's so tasty and easy to make. However, I've never used the white wine due to never having it on hand.

I've tried the sauce twice-each time when I add the wine to the cream or vice versa, it looks like the cream curdles and separates.  My kids wouldn't touch it.  Even kept cooking it to see if it would come together but it didn't.

Not only was the shrimp (and scallops I added) happy, my husband and I were also happy! This was fantastic! I did double the sauce after reading the reviews, and was glad I did. I served this over angel hair, but next time, I will use a thicker pasta like spaghetti or linguine. We both agreed that this was restaurant quality! Thanks for sharing. :)

Terrific!!! This was a great recipe.  I added more cream and wine and did not have fresh basil so I used basil flakes. I also seasoned (lightly) the shrimp before cooking. I recommend pasta but you can also have it over rice as my husband is not a pasta lover. This is by far the best shrimp recipe that I have found.

I made thse without the green onion dip packet and they were quite yummy.  I'd like the cream cheese to be a bit firmer.  I did bake them on 350 degrees for about 25 minutes, very large mushrooms and they came out pretty good.

Very good! We will be making this one again. We used half and half as that was all we had on hand. At the end we stirred in our whole wheat pasta and shrimp and let it soak up all the juices and flavor.  Yum yummy!

Amazing! When I cooked the shrimp I added shrimp consomme (can be found at any latin market or international isle at the grocery store). I didnt have heavy cream so I used half & half and added cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Also added chicken boullion to the sauce.  Everyone loved it.

Yummy! Mushrooms were a great addition. Sauce was  thinner than expected, but overall flavor was very good. Made it in my recipe box and cannot wait to try again in the future.

Well this one didn't turn out well for me - not quite sure why ....but it turned into a bit of a gloopy mess without much seasoning, yet there was not enough sauce at the same time. I've made a 'shrimp with feta' version of this dish many time without any issues.  I don't know if it was me or the recipe - but it's my first failure off this site.  I ate some for lunch the next day anyway as it was made - I didn't want to waste the shrimp.

This was delicious! I made it with some angel hair pasta. However, I will double the cream and white wine next time, because the pasta kind of soaks the sauce up and I still want it to be creamy enough.

Nice, light sauce, a great substitute for an alfredo craving. I used light cream instead of heavy cut down on butter by a TBS, added extra tomato and basil, I am a vedgehead :). Also tried with rice pasta, doesn't get as soggy, healthy gluten-free option.

Quick, easy, and delicious. We used paprika and Louisiana hot sauce instead of cayenne because we couldn't locate at cayenne at the 9th hour. We will for sure make this again. We served over orzo.

Awesome!  Easy to make, family all liked it.  Used cherry tomatoes instead of roma and milk instead of cream.  Added parmesan cheese after plating, but could add during cooking to help thicken sauce.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious! I didn't change it except for making more 'sauce' as many suggested. I used 3 tomatoes, added 2/3c heavy cream and 1/2c wine. We loved this! I was nervous to add too much cayenne but next time I'll use a little more, and a little more garlic. But the flavor was good, just could use a little extra.  We had it over whole wheat spaghetti - fantastic! Definitely making this regularly!!

I doubled the sauce and added mushrooms as suggested by other reviewers...I served over fettuccine.  I also used 1 tsp corn starch to thicken the sauce.  This was very good, next time I will add parmesan cheese.

Delicious! I used olive oil instead of butter, and chicken stock since I didn't have any white wine. I doubled everything except the olive oil and shrimp so there would be more sauce. It is fantastic on pasta. Thank you for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  All of the ingredients work so well together and it doesn't taste heavy (like so many recipes with heavy cream in them do).  I did the recipe almost exactly as written.  While cooking the 2nd half of it (after shrimp is removed), I added some parmesean cheese and mozzarella cheese to make it thicker.  There is another recipe on this site that I love, cajun seafood pasta, but this recipe is perfect if you want something lighter with great flavor.  But, that is where I got the idea to add parmesean.  I used a fettucine pasta, which I would not use again - it holds too much of the sauce and overpowers it.  I would definitely do angel hair next time.  Also, I would double the recipe if you like sauce.  I found myself adding a little more cream.  Definitely do fresh basil - it makes it all taste so fresh.  This is a great recipe and doesn't seem really fattening.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Eh. I added scallops, green/red pepper, and mushrooms because we love veggies. But, it was still kinda bland. Needed maybe more garlic, or some parmesan cheese?

Wow! Absolutely delicious and very simple: the best of both worlds. I added a squeeze of lemon ( can't do seafood without it) and some crabmeat, though I'm sure it would be just as great without it. Making this one again!

I thought this recipe was pretty bland.  I followed the recipe, substituting dried basil because I didn't have fresh.  I put it over angel hair pasta and it really didn't have that much flavor, I had to keep adding more and more salt.  Won't make again.  I would recommend the Shrimp and Feta Cheese Pasta recipe off this website, it is one of our favorites.

The flavors of this dish were divine! We had to double the recipe and still had only enough for a smidge over 2 servings. We added more cream to thicken the cause...we're from the south! I have stored this into my recipe book. I will DEFINATELY cook it again-- DELICIOUS!!!

Sooooo good. Would have been better if I had made it as written, but it was a last minute dinner and I had to use what I had on hand. I used: 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil, extra garlic and finely chopped onion instead of green onions, 2 tsp dried basil in lieu of fresh, used correct amount of wine, a can of roasted diced tomatoes (with juice), and LOTS of crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper (we like things really spicy) and a can of evaporated milk instead of fresh cream. Even using only what I had available in the fridge and pantry it was amazing. I can't wait to try it again using the fresh ingredients called for in the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

This was quick, easy and quite good.  I'll definitely double the sauce the next time, however.

This was really good! I think it could have used a bit more spice, so I'm going to add some Old Bay next time...used these "happy" fellows to top cheese grits for Shrimp and Grits, one of my daughter's favorite meals! Thanks.

Where has this recipe been all of my life? Wow, this was GOOD! I did double the sauce, based on other reviews and I am glad that I did.  I also used precooked shrimp because I had them on hand. Thank you for an AMAZING recipe. I will make this again. And again!

This came out amazing! After I took out the shrimp I just poured in the wine and then steamed some broccoli and mushrooms in the skillet with a lid for about 7 minutes. Then I added the cream and reduced. My boyfriend said it was one of the best dinners I've ever cooked! Everything came out cooked perfectly, thanks for a really great recipe :)

I don't know about the shrimp...but, our taste buds were very happy! I didn't have heavy cream so, I used half 'n half instead. I also doubled the entire recipe so there would be leftovers. Oh yea, I served over wide wheat noodles because it's all i had. Thanks so much for this!

Sooo good!  I've made this a couple of times, each time with the "Seafood Blend" from Trader Joe's- frozen scallops, calamari, and shrimp.  Its soo yummy!  The different seafood flavors add so much to the dish and you can just throw them in the pan frozen and let them cook.  I add chopped baby portabellas and skip the salt/pepper/cayenne pepper and just add some creole seasoning and a splash of tobasco to spice it up.  Absolutely delicious and super quick.  A huge hit with the husband.

This recipe is amazing!  Marinated the shrimp for an hour or so in some olive oil and cajun spices.  We used the full amount of shrimp, but doubled the sauce ingredients.  We also added more cream than called for and just let it reduce until we were happy with it.  Added some grated parmesan cheese to the sauce for extra flavour.  My husband and I were very happy with this recipe, it's definately going to make it's way to our table again!  So tasty!

I didn't have shrimp, so I followed one reviewer's suggestion and used boneless/skinless chicken breasts. It was wonderful. My husband said he wants it on our regular rotation.

I doubled the sauce but not the tomato. I loved the hint of wine I tasted with each bite. When I make it again I plan to add more cayenne pepper, and a 1/2 cup of parm to the sauce. It was great!!

I don't know about the shrimp being "happy", but my husband and I were extremely "happy" with this recipe. Only a couple of minor changes....we cut back on the butter to two pats and added olive oil to saute` the shrimp and garlic.  We doubled the ingredients for the sauce and added the remaining basics when we added the shrimp back into the pan. The "happy" diners ate this meal on pasta, garnished with additional green onion, fresh basil, and freshly grated parmesan cheese. A very delicious meal. Thank you for sharing.

Well, I'm removing all other shrimp scampi'ish recipes from my Favorites because this will be my go to shrimp pasta dish from now on, absolutely delicious!  Made almost exactly as written with just a couple of minor adjustments. I doubled the sauce since I served it with 16oz of pasta, would not have been enough sauce otherwise.  Also, since my grocer didn't have ripened plum tomatoes (which I will use next time if they look good) so I substituted some beautiful and very flavorful cherry tomatoes instead. Agree with other reviewers that canned tomatoes will NOT do this dish justice. Also, I only used 1 clove of garlic since I thought it might overpower the other flavors, which I felt was a good call (personal preference). I can imagine that this sauce would be good with chicken or no meat at all!  Try it, you won't be disappointed. Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!

Absolutely wonderful recipe! Make sure you have everything chopped and shrimp peeled before hand. This recipe moves fast! Also, if you serve it on pasta or rice, start that first, or you will be trying to keep the shrimp warm while it finishes cooking!

Oh My!!!!  Was this ever delicious and so much fun preparing!  Even my hubby who normally thinks the only way shrimp is worth eating is to fry it, thought it was really good.  Didn't change a thing...all those luscious ingredients came together just right!  Thanks Proudwife for a great recipe.  It pairs well with angel hair pasta.

Excellent meal.  I doubled the sauce recipe and added more cayenne.  We like our sauce spicy.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious.

Delicious and very easy! I thought this was better than most creamy tomato pasta dishes you would find in a restaurant.  I made the following changes: 1) used 1/2 cup regular onions instead of 1/4 cup green onions, 2) added red pepper flakes, 3) substituted olive oil for half the butter, used 1/3 cup white wine, 4) topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese, 5) Before serving, tossed with whole wheat spaghetti.  This would probably also be good with some green vegetables mixed in, maybe peas, asparagus, or broccoli? We will definitely eat this again.

My boys love this recipe, but I do double the sauce. Instead of heavy cream, I use half & half.  We have a local winery that makes a white wine called Hot Jazz - made with jalapenos - this is awesome made with that, but it's really good made with even cheap white wine.  I use more than a pinch of cayenne also (my boys like spicey) and serve over angel hair pasta.  I always make this for my son before he goes back to college - it's his favorite!

Absolutely out-of-this-world!  If I could give this a "10" I would.  Made this for dinner last night for hubby and I and we ate the whole thing.  I did double the sauce and next time I will triple, as we loved the sauce.  Served it over angle hair pasta.  This will definitely go in my recipe box to make again.  Thanks "Proudwife" for this fabulous recipe.

This was alright. I think it needed more seasoning though but it was pretty bland. Also, I doubled the recipe and it was only enough for two. I would suggest doubling it again just to have enough sauce.

This recipe was very tasty, next time I would double the sauce for 4 people, there was enough shrimp but I would have liked more sauce. It might be nice with rice as well

I would definitely rate this recipe restaurant quality.  I made it for my husband who loved it so much he wanted me to make it again the next day!  I served this with pull-apart herb rolls, Caesar salad and a glass of Riesling.  Absolutely delicious!  This is a keeper.

This was delicious! I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp, because that was what I had, a little olive oil, and fat free half & half. Spooned over whole wheat pasta. I will make this again.

There is nothing amiss about Happy Shrimp!  My son made not one, but two happy plates with this dinner!  I cut it in half (kept same amount of sauce) since it was just him and me eating it and then wished I hadn't.  I didn't change a thing except to squeeze a wedge of lemon over my plate and it's an instant favorite.  This is a GOOD dish!

Tasty and easy shrimp dish. Would have been better if I had used fesh Basil. Dried just didn't cut it. I used half and half too so I had to thicken with corn starch. Will try again.

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. It is a very quite and easy recipe as well. First, reading the reviews we took some suggestions at altering the dish. We doubled the sauce and used fettucini. The first time we made the dish, I followed the direction of turning down the heat once the sauce has begun to simmer. This was a mistake for us. It was really runny but still able to eat it; paired it with assparagus and a Sauvignon Blanc.The second time we left the heat alone and the sauce turned out PERFECTLY. This time we paired it with garlic bread. This will become one of our favorite dishes and will be used quite often. The pictures that i took of this dish are of the first attempt at this dish... you can see how runny the sauce is.

Really good & easy.  If using fat free half & half, use a crusty bread for dipping (since sauce is much lighter) - if using heavy cream, serve over angel hair pasta.  And I make 1.5x the sauce.

This is delicious! I used half & half instead of heavy cream, added another tomato and some mushrooms (sauteed them first) and put some freshly grated parm on the side for the spouse. Love it! Thanks!

Made a couple of changes to this recipe by adding some mushrooms and heavy cream to the sauce.  My family thought that it didn't have a lot of flavor and didn't really care for it.  I thought it was pretty good, but needed some additional spices after it got to the plate to help give it some more flavor.

Very easy to make, with a pleasant spicy flavor. I made with canned diced tomatoes and it worked well. Definitely have bread on hand to soak up the sauce.

This recipe was very good.  I didn't use the hot sauce as my family doesn't like spicy food.  I added Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.  It tasted even better the next day.

Excellent recipe.  I just doubled the sauce for liquid because pasta seems to soak up all the fluid.  Other than that, the recipe as listed was great!  Will make this one again.  The happy shrimp made me very happy with its taste.

This was great and simple. I used precooked shrimp and made more of the sauce to coat the pasta. Topped off with fresh grated parmesan cheese. This will make it in our rotation.

How can such a simple recipe be soooo good!! I did lighten the recipe with FF half & half, 1/8 cup evaporated milk and a little cornstarch in the evaporated milk.  Also sauteed the shrimp mixture in olive oil instead of butter.  It was still wonderful. Thank you!

I added chopped sweet peppers to simmer in the sauce. In my experience, onion and tomato can cook down too much in a simmering sauce, so I added those ingredients when I added the shrimp back into the sauce. Tossed all with angel hair pasta and topped with shaved Parmesan cheese and a dash of red pepper flakes.

This recipe is simple, and flavorful as is. We have made it several times now, exactly following the recipe. The only thing we vary is the amount of spice - the kiddos like it mild, and my husband likes things that melt your face off. So, we make it mild and my husband spices his up more at the table. 

Great recipe, and seems like one that would be easy to tweak based on your preferences...next time we plan to add some additional veggies to the mix.

Excellent and company worthy.  I used Hunts canned diced tomatoes with basil and oregano vs. fresh tomatoes.   I added fresh basil as called for.   I also added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, only because I had it, and felt it would be a good addition.    Entire family gave it an A+

We made this last night with pasta. I used exactly the ingredients listed but did not go with the listed measurements since we were doing a big batch. It worked out great since we needed to use up the scallions we had and our basil plant was in dire need of a trim. Other than high calorie, this was great for us. Definitely a keeper for us, though, I may try half and half next time to cut calories. The pasta really helped to thicken the sauce.

I made this recipe as written and was disappointed. By the time the sauce reduced the tomatoes were nothing but red bits and it was more oily than creamy. Basically, what I got was pink, oily shrimp that did have a nice butter taste.
I made some changes: 
•	2 cloves of garlic instead of the dried, minced garlic
•	Shallots instead of the green onions
•	After the shrimp was cooked and set aside to stay warm, I added 1 teaspoon flour and the cream to make a roux. Then I added the wine, tomatoes, and basil and simmered until the tomatoes cooked through and sauce reduced somewhat.
•	In the meantime, I made angel hair pasta according to package directions.
•	When the tomato sauce was done, I stirred the shrimp and pasta into it; then tossed until everything was coated and warm.
•	I removed it from the heat, separated it into 2 wide soup plates, garnished it with chives and parmesan cheese, and served it with crusty bread and a salad.

This was delicious! My entire family loved it. I've also made it doubling the garlic, adding sliced fresh mushrooms after setting aside the shrimp, adding and simmering the wine for a few minutes, then adding the cream and tomatoes, replacing cayenne for crushed red pepper flakes and it's even better.

This definitely is a "do again"!  I find it funny though, when people take a recipe, CHANGE some of it... then say... it was "ok" well, try using the recipe as written before changing it silly... you just may like it! The only time I would change something is if there is an allergy problem then I'd find something close to what was taken out.

After first bite, Husband said, "Honey, this is a keeper"!  Enough said!!  Well, actually a bit more-----it was more than enough for two.  Also I doubled the sauce, but probably wouldn't next time.  I served it with crusty bread and a green salad with homemade vinaigrette.

This was amazing! Wonderfully flavorful, beautiful on the plate, yet light overall. My husband and I gobbled it down and I only wish I would've doubled the recipe so we had more leftovers! My only changes: I added a splash of Old Bay, used half and half in place of the heavy cream, and added diced yellow peppers. It was delicious! I'll definitely be making this again.

Although this was good, it was not scrumptious so I can only givie 3 stars.  The sauce would be better with some parmesan cheese and my family ended up putting the cheese on pasta before toping with this shrimp dish and then sprinkling more cheese.  1 1/2 times recipe was perect amount for 3 people. No one asked for seconds so that was disappointing.

All I can tell you is this..... My very picky husband took one bite and said "VERY GOOD!".  Followed recipe exactly (in lieu of changing all the ingredients and rating my own recipe) and it's perfect as is!

I made this last night for my hubby.  Flavor was wonderful!  I made it exactly as written.  However, my family loves sauce and next time I will double or maybe even triple the sauce.  Cayenne gives a nice kick!

I made this last night, doubled the sauce, and it came out great! 
I used a mixture of diced roma tomatoes, and halved grape tomatoes, about 1 1/4 cups.
Next time, which will be soon, I'm going to add about 1/2 pound of lump crabmeat. That's the only thing that I think could make this better.

Good recipe, but I can only give it 4 stars because I had to doctor it up to make it a hit with my family.  I followed everything exactly, but added 2 TBS of Old Bay Seasoning to the dish.  It made all the difference in the world.  If I don't make this once a month, I hear complaints.

I was not expecting to be WOWED by this recipe, but WOW!  These flavors exploded in a creamy, spicy, delightful melange.  I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand:  light cream instead of heavy cream, chopped FROZEN basil, 3 canned plum tomatoes, and a couple shakes more than a pinch of cayenne, served over quinoa.  Fabulous.`

Excellent!  Big hit at our house.  I used about 1/2 can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of romas, other than that, followed receipe to the letter.  Served over angel hair.  Will be in regular rotation at our house.

As I was working this recipe, I quickly knew I had to double the quantity of the sauce, and triple the amount of tomatoes in order to boost the flavor.  It was all right, but did not meet my expectations.  I'm removing it from my recipe box.

Made this tonight.  It is now my 'go to' shrimp dish.  I didn't have tomatoes or basil, but I had tri-color bell peppers/onions. I also added fresh nutmeg (always to any cream sauce). I made twice-baked potatoes...hubby doesn't care for rice.  But next time, I will make extra sauce...we're having this over RICE!! The sauce was to die for! This dinner was fabulous, fast and easy! Thank you!
I can't believe I made this tonight, this time with fresh garden tomatoes over angel hair, and we did NOT like it!!! I'm still keeping 5 stars, because the first time was the best.  I guess the tomatoes ruined it, made it kind of sweet, I just don't know!

This was other-worldly good...almost freakishly good...I normally change ingredients around a bit to suite my tastes in recipes on this site, BUT I followed everything to the last letter with this one, and I'm so glad I did. It is the best thing I have ever tasted. Ever. And I've dined at some of the finest restaurants. Amazing.

BY THE WAY...in case you're wondering what kind of wine to use with this, use a Sauvignon Blanc. I used a Fat  SB, and it came out reallyw ell.

Just the fragrance of the butter, garlic, onion, and shrimp should earn it 5 stars! What a great, simple dish! Because we're watching our diet, I used skim milk rather than heavy cream, and it was STILL a 5-star dinner! Served it over whole wheat spaghetti. Thanks, Proudwife,  for a great recipe.

Awesome recipe!!  I tweeked it a bit but not a ton.  Quadrupled the sauce cause I was feeding a family of four who loves sauce and leftovers.  Added baby portabella mushrooms, little more garlic and about 1/4 cup parmasean cheese.  After sauce was done stirred in 1 lb Orzo (which I think paired perfect for a pasta choice) and let simmer for a few mins to soak in flavor.  Served with my Bruchetta --Superb!!  Definitely keeping this one.

I used chicken bouillon instead of wine and increased the amounts of liquids to have enough sauce to cook the pasta in. I also increased the amount of cayenne for extra heat. I had to simmer it longer than planned, but it turned out amazing. Between the two of us, we polished off the whole thing. Next time, I'll definitely make more. I suspect this would be divine as leftovers. :)

The first time I made this it had a great flavor but there wasn't enough sauce. I like lots of sauce with my pasta. I doubled the recipe the 2nd time and it was great! One of my favorite's.

So so good!  I actually made the sauce about a month ago then stuck it in the freezer. I had bought the stuff to make it and didn't want it to go bad as our dinner plans had changed the night I was going to make it.  It was pretty easy and very tasty.  I served it on bow tie pasta. The sauce was a little  thin, I don't know if that was from freezing it or not, but it didn't matter, it was so very yummy.  I'll be making this often!

Very good! Made pretty much "as is".  I did up the garlic just a little, maybe to about 2 tsp. Served over spaghetti noodles. Looked like something straight from your local italian restaurant.

I have to just about quadruple this recipe for my family of seven, but there is never any left over...they eat until they are absolutely stuffed. Even the little picky tomato-haters just push the tomatoes out of the way and shovel shrimp in like no tomorrow. It's just that good. I believe I could make this weekly and my kids wouldn't get tired of it!

My wife and I loved this recipe.  I did the cooking and served it with a salad and garlic bread.  Preparation was quick and easy. I usually prepare a new recipe before I read the reviews.  I don't want to be influenced by other's opinions.  We will definately make this dish again and agreed additional sauce would enhance the recipe.

Very good as posted, but definitely benefitted from some tweaks as suggested by other reviewers (e.g., added mushrooms & Parm, more tomato, more garlic). Made this the second time last night with those changes. Also, I simmered the tomatoes, etc. for about 10 min before adding cream, then simmered another 10 min, which definitely enriched the sauce flavor. Substituted 1/2 tsp half-sharp paprika / lb shrimp for the cayenne from the very first; none of us like pepper heat to be more than a hint. My wife suggested we make this our new "traditional" Easter dinner; she seldom gives such compliments, so this one goes into the "Keeper File" !!

Yum! I subbed olive oil for the butter & 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream. I am sure the sauce would have been silkier with those original ingredients, but once you mix in the pasta, it is all good! 4 ounces of angel hair was the perfect amount of pasta. Thanks for posting the recipe.

This was awesome.  I didn't use the wine or tomatoes...simply because I didn't have them.  Which next time I will be sure to use.  I just doubled up on the cream....ughhh I can feel the extra pounds already!!!  But it was really really good...I think it will be a go to recipe for shrimp in our house! YUMMY

This was definitely happy shrimp!  Happy mouth anyway!  I was making it for 5 of us and was glad that I saw others say it didn't make all that much!  I doubled it, plus used a whole pint of whipping cream instead of the 2/3 it would have been doubled.  There was just enough with one serving left, which I am sure someone will snag for lunch tomorrow!  I did not put the basil, tomatoes or green onion in until the cream had thickened.  I didn't think those ingredients should cook so long.  I put them in right at the end.  I added a 1/3 cup parmesan cream and a little pinch of red pepper flakes also.  I served it over angel hair pasta. Was amazing!!

Yummy! I followed the directions here (all except adding tomatoes), and this was delicious! We served it over thin wheat spaghetti. Next time, I'll double the sauce and serve it over angel hair. My husband and I loved it!

This recipe was quick, easy and tasty!  I added some mushrooms because I love them (used about 250 g for 3 servings), and I doubled the tomato.  I served the recipe over angel hair pasta.  It looked and tasted like it came from a restaurant!  This recipe made me and my husband very happy, thanks "proudwife"!  :)

This recipe is easy and delicious! I added a tablespoon of tomato paste for a stronger tomato flavour and a little bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Served over spaghettini. Will definitely make again. Yummy!!!

Loved it!  Very easy too for a quick dinner.  I did double the sauce, used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream and tossed in 1/4 c grated Parmesean cheese at the end.  Added 3/4 box of cooked angel hair pasta for last 5 mintutes of cooking time, great meal!

Wow!  Totally simple.... and loved by all of us.  I doubled the recipe ingredients and used 32 oz frozen deveined uncooked shrimp.... and it was awesome.  Didn't get whole cream @ the store ...so I had to use what I had on hand which was 1/2 and 1/2.  The rest made just as written.  This really is a keeper.... the kids actually ate everything without complaint and my husband has enough for lunch tomorrow.  Served with heated canned artichokes... and I had some homemade olive bread I'd defrosted to soak up the sauce.  AWESOME!

So delicious. I cut back on the butter and used 18% cream rather than heavy, and it was still very rich. We did add more tomatoes than called for, and added the basil towards the end. Letting the basil cook for 10 minutes kills the fresh flavor and turns it black. Served with freshly grated parmesan and caesar salad.

Yummy.  Not spicy at all, though.  I substituted FF cream for heavy & it wasn't as thick but the taste was great! I doubled the sauce & didn't have enough shrimp so I added some seafood medley with the shrimp.  Delicious! Served over angel hair pasta

This recipe was awesome!  Printed it out at the last minute so had to make it with what was on hand: half and half instead of heavy cream and a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Just let the sauce cook a little longer. Nice light sauce yet very tasty. You'll definitely want to double the sauce!

Excellent and I made it gluten free! Use equal parts white wine to heavy cream, I used dried basil and 4.5 cloves of garlic. Gluten free linguine and gluten free garlic toast was served. Great for the entire family!

absolutely love this recipe. It is so easy yet so incredibly delicious. I like to make the sauce in advance before I add the shrimp, because shrimp is so prone to overcooking, I add it last and take it off the heat and serve it immediately once the shrimp turns pink. I make the sauce ahead by sautéing the garlic and the butter for a little bit, then add all the solids and seasonings and saute those for a while, then add the wine and let that cook off for a while as you do not want to taste alcohol, then last I add the cream and simmer it down to a consistency that I like. then I add the shrimp and serve the moment it turns pink. I used white wine one time and Sherry another and they both were delicious. I double the sauce now since I use it with angel hair pasta that has garlic butter and parmesan in it and I like extra sauce. But again this recipe blew my mind because it was so simple and so amazing, restaurant quality. It almost tastes like a Newburgh which I have not seen in sometime. one time I added a little old bay seasoning to it which just added another layer of flavor but it was not necessary

Easy and delicious! I didn’t have white wine, added a little more heavy cream and a little water. I didn’t have fresh tomatoes and used 1-can of Hunts Fire Roasted tomatoes. Husband said, “you can make this again”.   The shrimp were IQF 70/90 count, wild caught, peeled and deveined.

Wow - this was truly excellent! Husband loved it so that’s a win! Only adjustments I made were used chicken broth instead of wine (I don’t drink) added mushrooms and used sweet onion instead of green onions. Added a bit extra cayenne as we like spice. Served with leftover yellow rice (lol) and salad. I’ll make this again!!

Just made it for the second time this week. Love the recipe as is but due to pantry options I did make a few changes. I doubled the sauce recipe, using 2 cans of chopped tomatoes, plenty of wine (really enhances the sauce) and couldn't believe I was out of Basil! Since I did not even have dried Basil, I substituted dried Cilantro and it was awesome. I would strongly consider making it this way  next time even if I have Basil (which I will!)! I served it over Ratiatori pasta which is perfect for grabbing and holding on to all that wonderful sauce!

This was awesome for a quick meal for wife and me after return from a short vacation where we didn’t get to cook for days!
I love onions so added one medium finely chopped sweet onion to butter & garlic prior to the shrimp & green onion. 
The semi-fresh basil from chilled produce display worked great, too. 
Another key switch for us with ANY fish like this is to sub ZOODLES for the pasta. My favorite prep for the zucchini is to spiral cut it into a pan on the side that has some butter, garlic and salt already crankin’.

Nice flavor.  I like a bit more sauce so I added a bit more juice and then served it over far farfalle.  Definitely a keeper

WOW! I thought this recipe was too simple to expect much from it, boy was I wrong! My husband asked what this dish was called, I told him "happy shrimp" and he replied "is it because it makes me happy?" I added a chopped onion because I have onion with virtually every dish I make (sauteed with the garlic) and had two extra Roma tomatoes I needed to use up so I tossed them in too, I was also serving over spaghetti not angel hair so I mixed a tbsp of cornstarch (slurried in cold water) in with a 1/3 cup more cream and the thickness was perfect! I actually preferred the two extra tomatoes I feel just 2 would have been too little, they are absolutely divine in the sauce, the acidity cutting through that sweetness of the cream is toe curling! I subbed the white wine for white wine vinegar because I don't drink alcohol much and that worked just fine.

I think this recipe is good. I won't say it's bland, but its mild on flavor which some people like my son appreciate. You could easily add some seasoning here and there to pep it up.

This was different and pretty good. I scaled the recipe in half, but there was hardly any sauce. I eventually added some of the pasta water to it. I had it over angel hair pasta, and it was fine for that, but if you like a lot of sauce, you'd probably want to double or triple it.  I didn't have heavy cream on hand, but  used what I had opened....some coconut coffee creamer (gave it a very subtle coconut taste) and a little milk. I only had dried basil, but I'm sure fresh would be so much better. The shrimp cooks fast, and I took about a minute off of the time stated. I also added the garlic only at the last minute of cooking time.

The family thought this was good, but I agree with other reviewers about the sauce serving size. If you are making with pasta, you may want to make a little more sauce.

Oh yum! I used already frozen cooked shrimp, the small ones - a two lb bag, so instead of cooking the shrimp with the garlic and onions i added them the same time i added the wine and cream while they were still frozen, i left them in the broth until they thawed, then removed them.  I then cooked down the broth while i made another double batch of sauce. (This time i didn't add any  shrimp) I added the two double batches of sauce together.  I have 7 ppl to feed So I need to make alot. They are going to love this!

We loved this recipe. I made it almost as it was written. My wife doesn’t like spicy food, so I left out the red pepper. I served it with pasta and Parmesan Cheese. We live on the Gulf Coast, so we get a lot of fresh shrimp and  are always looking for new recipes. This was a real winner!.

I love this recipe! We probably have it every other week BY request. I now make 4 servings of sauce, replacing half the butter with a tablespoon of EVO, and use half and half instead of cream, but I only make 2 serving of shrimp. I serve over spaghetti.

Only problem was that everybody ate it all and no leftovers! we doubled the measurements for 4 adults and were satisfied. anymore would have been too much and anymore would have been eaten. the sauce is minimal but maybe that’s not such a bad thing. served in a bowl. forgot green onions and did heavy cream substitute (1/3 butter 2/3 milk).

Love this simple recipe.  If you like shrimp in a creamy, tasty,  garlicky sauce, it is great.  You don't need wine, I prefer using strong chicken broth mixture, but also enjoyed with the wine, and I mostly use regular tomatoes not Roma, both work very well. I have enjoyed this recipe many, many times; hopefully, you will enjoy it- as much as I do.

Amazing recipe and didn’t change anything from a flavor perspective...I tripled the wine and cream (which I subbed half and half).  I also used non-dairy butter just because...I probably would reduce the butter next time...didn’t need so much!  I also added canned Cremini mushrooms....everything from Whole Foods...Family loved this dish.

Great as is!  Don't change it, or rate it, until you've tried the recipe as written.  Definitely a keeper.

This was light and refreshing. I feel it is versatile in that you could add things, such as mushrooms, and it would be great still. Lovely recipe that I’m making again tonight.

I stir fried mushrooms and onions before I added the shrimp and garlic. After setting it aside I doubled the sauce ingredients and the tomatoes. Served this over Japanese noodles. We like the extra sauce.

This was so easy, quick and so, so delicious.  My whole family loved it and insisted I put it on the menu for next week too.  I served with fettucine -  about 3/4 lb was the right amount to have a light coating of sauce on the pasta.

I made Happy Shrimp last night, according to the recipe and it was superb. Perfect balance of flavors, served it with  home made bread for soaking  up that wonderful sauce. it was definitely a success. Thank you for this exceptional recipe.

it was easy to make. I didn't find it to be "spicy", but how much is a pinch of cayenne anyway?  I didn't have fresh basil and I had to sub chicken broth for the white wine, so perhaps having those ingredients would have increased the spice profile.
 I would make this again, and will probably use the cream sauce part of the recipe again for other things.

As typical ....... I follow the recipe exactly as written .... the first time.
It was a bit cumbersome as there are a bunch of steps and ingredients. I think it was very good, but, for me, it needed a "kick" somewhere to make it a GREAT.
The second time I increased much of the stuff for the sauce and used high-end red gulf shrimp, ..... added a few mushrooms and a bit more cayenne.
Pretty ............. light ........... but still not amazing.
I may try it a third time ............... but with so many great shrimp pasta recipes ........ I think I'll keep looking and trying others.

It was a quick and easy recipe.  We really enjoyed it and will be making it again.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I used 1/2 and 1/2.  Next time I will make sure I have some cream.  Had to use tomatoes from a can of tomatoes but I don't think it affected the quality of the dish.  Will make again!

I made 2 servings over fettuccine with dried basil and rotel. 1 tsp of dried equals 1 tbsp fresh basil. Drain the rotel well, I smashed all the juices through a strainer. Turned out well.

My kids loved this! I had to sub dried basil as the store was out of fresh. I added a little grated part into the sauce to help it thicken.

I would have given 5 stars, but after making as directed we thought it needed a few adjustments.  We definitely prefer a bit more sauce.  Next time I will double the sauce recipe, except I will use 3 tomatoes, and a bit more green onion and basil, but not quite doubled.  We made more sauce after we were done with dinner to use for the leftovers, and it was delicious.  We like ours topped with real parmesan cheese.  It was so simple, and not too time consuming.  So good, and easy enough for a week night dinner.  Thank you for sharing!

Excellent dish! I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of diced and added a red bell pepper. Next time I'll try with fresh tomatoes but I think I'll be keeping the pepper as well.

Love this.  I followed another recommendation and added a bit of Parmesan cheese.  I also added some fresh scallops.  Next time I’ll add another tomato but otherwise, perfect.  Our company loved it too!

This is a really good recipe and as others I just added to it with our personal touches. In large saucepan on medium-high heat melt butter, garlic, crimini mushrooms and sauteed until sizzling then added shrimp and removed them as soon as they got slightly cooked. Then added wine, evaporated skim milk, tomatoes, herbs and green onions. Simmered sauce while cooking angel hair pasta.  Added shrimp to sauce and simmered another minute then tossed with pasta and topped with parmesan. Yummy.

For 1/2 lb pasta used 2T butter but kept other ingredients the same to make more sauce.  Added some grated Parmesan at table.  Delicious.

I’m writing this review as I’m eating my happy shrimp over spaghetti. So good! SO GOOD!!! This my first attempt ever at making seafood other than fish and it is amazing, and super easy! My only suggestion is to double (or even triple?) the sauce. There was barely enough for three servings. This will be a regular at our house from now on! Thank you!

The only changes I made was I marinated the shrimp and cooked it on a charcoal grill. I also added some capers (why not?) and tomatoes. This is mostly because I can't leave anything alone but to be honest, this was so delicious I would have been just as pleased if I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I would definitely make this 100 times over again! Thank you for sharing!

I substituted zucchini noodles instead of pasta and it was equally as good as using pasta. I also used grape tomatoes. Very good if you are watching carbs using zucchini.

Didn't have Heavy cream at home so used 1/2 and 1/2 doubled up and a little extra wine then cooked it down to thicken.  Excellent flavour!  added a dash of cayenne and Tabasco to give it a little  zing but it got lost in the sauce.  Need to use about 1 Tsp of each.  Also would like to try it with Chipotle.  Maybe even mushrooms.  |Excellent platform for a lot of experimentation.  Thank You

Overall, this dish was Fantastic!  Though I think your recipes mostly stand on their own (thank you!), I did make a few changes/additions. I used 12 (yes!) cloves fresh garlic (chopped small), both green onions & sweet white onions,  chopped yellow pepper,  portobello mushrooms, 2 large “ugly” tomatoes chopped, & extra fresh basil.   I didn’t have heavy cream so used half & half combined with white dry cooking wine.   Just follow the same cooking sequences .  Placed over skinny linguine & topped w shaved Parmesan.    OMG, this is a keeper & worthy to serve to family, friends or dinner guests.  Note:  do not overlook your shrimp...... you will be amazed at how tender they can be!

Went well with angel hair pasta, as suggested.
This recipe made 4 to 6 servings for us.
I will make this again,

This was delicious.  I followed recipe but had to make substitutions for what I didn't have on hand.    Instead of  roma tomatoes I used a little more than half of a can of crushed tomatoes with spices in it (basil, garlic, and oregano) .  Also didn't have white wine, so used red wine instead.  Hubby and I loved it.  Will be making again. Served over thin spaghetti.  It is very happy shrimp!

I didn't have any white wine but I did have clam juice from a previous meal. This recipe is a keeper.  You need the crusty bread to mop up the sauce.  The angel hair pasta was a great addition.  I used 9 shrimp per person which worked out to 5.6 oz. not 4 oz. as per the recipe.

I got everything together and measured  as the water for the pasta heated. Then cooked it as the pasta cooked for 8 min.  Nearly perfect timing.  Pair it with a salad and breadsticks.  *i omitted the wine but otherwise followed the recipe.  
Simple, yet looks and tastes like you spent time on it.

Everyone loved it! Probably added a bit more garlic than was called for and I used already-cooked defrosted very large shrimp (because that's all I had in my freezer). In order not to overcook them, I didn't sauté them with the garlic and onions right away. I added them toward the end so that they would heat up a bit and get mixed in with the sautéed ingredients. Then I removed them when the recipe said to -- before the simmer ingredients. I made this exactly as stated (with the minor timing change because of the precooked shrimp), and with the exact ingredients. Delicious.

I made this for my wife and me . My son ate most of the shrimp because they were so good. So I ended up making more shrimp for my and me. I served it over white rice just to change it up a bit. Every one loved it. I’ll definitely make this again and recommend this recipe to everyone. I used a can of Roma tomatoes and sliced them up into large pieces.

Made as it but doubled the sauce and added 4 snow crab legs at the end before serving and scallions on top.  Everyone really enjoyed this.  Just take a kitchen sizzles and cut the crab shells open for easy removal of the crab meat.  It looked super fancy.

Made no changes and it was awesome. We are on a low carb diet so no bread or pasta.  We drank the sauce and it was like a shrimp bisque. Will definitely make again!

Made it pretty much as is. I scaled it back for two servings. That being said, next time I will double the sauce, since my husband requested it be “saucier.” I put the pasta directly into the sauce so it absorbed most of it, probably why hubs thought it needed more. I didn’t have enough shrimp so I supplemented it with sautéed mushrooms. I sautéed them before I did anything else so they wouldn’t release too much water. Added spinach too because vegetables. Nice recipe, endlessly adaptable.

I didn’t have wine, so I used chicken broth. Also, I used milk instead of heavy cream because that’s what I had. I did end up thickening it slightly with some cornstarch. It was good!

I never make anything perfectly but even with my mistakes, this tasted perfect. I added some partly cooked asparagus, put in too much cayenne, did not have fresh basil (only dried) and halved the whole thing. I put it over artichoke-spinach noodles. It was soooo yummy!

Very tasty and very easy. I had to substitute a few ingredients due to what I had on had:  halved small grape tomatoes for the Roma’s, 2 teaspoons of dried basil for the fresh basil.  I also doubled the sauce as I had 1 1/2 lbs. of shrimp.  I’m glad I doubled the sauce; it allowed for leftovers for another meal.

Delicious! I made double the quantity and it turned out great. The only change I made was I used herb butter because I had some left from another recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe. I made a few changes though. I substituted chicken broth for the white wine and doubled the sauce (broth, half and half) per others' recommendations (still wasn't a ton of sauce). I also substituted white onion for green onion because I wanted the onion to cook down; I didn't add the onion and garlic at the same time I cooked the shrimp either. I removed the cooked shrimp (which I seasoned with Old Bay) and then cooked the onion and garlic in the butter; I also cooked the tomatoes down with the onion and garlic for a while before I added the liquid ingredients. To add flavor to the sauce, I added Tony's Creole seasoning until it seemed right. I also added an Italian cheese blend at the end when I added the shrimp back in. Delicious! I would definitely make it again as described.

Loved it!  Finally the perfect shrimp-pasta dish that I have been looking for.  Used extra cream, 1 T dried basil, no tomatoes (forgot to get them, will use next time).   Thanks for this one!

Very tasty, but needs a pinch of salt, maybe about 1/4 tsp.  Would be best served with rice rather than noodles. Preferably brown rice.

4.5 stars.  We enjoyed this dish.  I didn't have any fresh Romas, so I had to use a can of diced tomatoes.  In the future, I will 1 1/2 times the sauce to make it more "saucy".

Followed the recipe closely. I didn’t have green onions, so substituted chives from the garden. Didn’t have white wine so used sherry. I doubled the sauce. It was excellent.

I didn't find it saucy  enough as others have said, so I added a bit more cream. I also found that adding some red pepper flakes to it helped give a bit more flavour. A nice, easy to make weeknight meal!

Will make again.  There are some other shrimp recipes on here I like better but this is a very good one.  I cook for someone who can't eat spicy so I had to lighten the spice and think that hurt it a little.  All in all a reliable good recipe.

The dish was super yummy!  I will definitely be making it again, only next time I will double my sauce.  I used a pound of thin spaghetti, it could have used more sauce.

I will make this again! I did make a few changes. Added button mushrooms, used lots of garlic, used dried basil (1 tbsp) since I didn't have fresh. Instead of green onions I used yellow onions chopped small. Substituted chopped grape tomatoes for Roma since that's what I had.  In addition to a very small pinch of cayenne I added a few shots of tabasco as suggested by another reviewer. It is terrific! Served on angel hair. Very easy to make.

I wanted a new way to make shrimp and this was simple and delicious.  Kudos to whoever submitted this.  Made as is except that I used Old Ba seasoning instead of cayenne.

Used low fat creamer and half the butter.
I like spice, so I added some more salt and cayenne.
Served over egg noodles.

This is delicious. I added some peppers and mushrooms to give it a little more flavor and texture. Also it took longer than 10 minutes for the sauce to reduce down, about 30 minutes.

This recipe is a keeper. I used wine, like the recipe called for, instead of using a broth. I think the wine is a definite must in this recipe. I used ready to eat shrimp and doubled the sauce.

this was a great, easy to make recipe.  Very simple for a nice quick dinner.  The key to knowing if a recipe is good or not is whether or not my 9 year old will eat it and he loved it!  I added a bit of fresh parmesan, and used half and half instead of full cream.  it was a nice sauce without being too thick

I followed the recipe almost exactly and only increased the liquids about 50%.  Served it over Angel hair pasta which my wife loved but my preference would have been rice. I also recommend taking the tail off of the shrimp as its a little tidier when its time to eat. Quick and easy which is great when you have a busy schedule. This is one of two great shrimp recipes that could also be used as an hors d'oeuvre, the other is Margarita Shrimp. By Harry D.

I made this for dinner last night for guest. It was delish. I made a few changes. I added mushrooms (yum) and removed the basil (this time). I added a bit of Italian seasoning and served it up with a side of roasted broccoli and garlic bread. They LOVED it.

Excellent!!! Doubled recipe and it fed my book group of 10 with leftovers. 1 box of angel hair pasta was plenty too. I used combo of olive oil and butter. Instead of all heavy cream used combo of half and half no heavy cream. Everyone loved it!

Wonderful recipe! Even my shrimp-skeptical son loved it. I added sliced mushrooms and went heavy on the tomatoes and scallions. This is very similar to my favorite dish at the Green Mill restaurant, which shut down in our town last year. Happy to have my happy shrimp back!

Above and beyond our expectations! Incredibly delicious, simple recipe. An instant favorite!! Absolutely cannot wait to make this recipe again. (Minor changes- Didn't have white wine, so I subbed chicken broth. Used white cooking onion instead of green onion and crushed red pepper instead of the cayenne due to our taste preferences.) Heavy on the crushed red pepper, because I like it spicy. It was perfect. Definitely need to serve it with a good, crusty Italian bread next time to soak up the sauce. YUM!

Very easy to make this impressive dish. Great meal for evenings when company comes over. The ingredients are ones I have on hand. I always have a bag of frozen shrimp in the freezer and pasta in the cupboard. I used dry basil and garlic as they are always in my cupboard as well as a regular tomato cut into chunks. I added a little Parmesan cheese before serving.

Awesome. Made it without the wine since I didn't have any on hand and added some parmesan cheese to the sauce. Made mine with button mushrooms in addition to the tomatoes. So delicious and easy. This is a classic recipe that could be modified with chicken and any vegetable on hand. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my new go-to recipe for shrimp.  My husband loved it and had a second helping which is unusual for him.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for it and I wouldn't change anything when I make it again.  I would say that it really is a two person meal not for four people.

My husband is not the "fish" eater I am, so when I find a recipe I think he will like, I try it.   This dish was so easy and wonderful.  He actually asked for seconds.  This will be a regular in our household. I changed it only because of my low carb diet and made it with heavy cream instead of milk.

I tripled the butter, wine & cream.  I doubled the garlic, and fresh basil, and cayenne.  I probably didn't need this much sauce but I like a lot of sauce so I followed other suggestions and made a little extra.  I'm so glad I did because now I have a little leftover!  This is delicious, fairly easy, and I will be making this again!

I loved this recipe as is. I can't wait to try this recipe as stated. I had to improvise due to lack of cream and a few other items. I added lots of pepper, lots and I do mean lots of garlic. I used the basil. Thankfully we had that. I added marjoram. I used almost 1/2 cup of butter. I used a 1/4 cup of Pinot Grigio. I also added more garlic in the form of garlic salt. This was absolutely tasty! Quite pleased with my changes. We will make this again.

This recipe is a keeper!  Made with whole wheat pasta and added to the sauce once cooked.  Will double sauce next time.  Also added a touch of red pepper flakes as well as the cayenne.  My husband and I like a little kick!  Sprinkled with shredded parmesan and served with a side of steamed broccoli.  Would also be delicious with creamy polenta in place of the pasta. Will try that next time.

Was good but something missing. Not sure what or the fact we are use to alfredo sauce.  Made this with  spiralized zucchini and summer squash.  And I also used only half the shrimp since it was for two but used full recipe for sauce.  Would make again.

We loved it! Easy!    Living in the mountains...you have to make due with what you have on hand. Milk allergy so subbed coconut milk, sauted shrimp and onion in 1 tablespoon butter and remaining  white truffle oil , to equal 1\4  cup. Subbed sweet onion, out of green onions. Served with linguine. Yum!!!!  I know I rated 5 stars with changes...but it's that good?? served with shaved parmesan and lemon pepper.

Don't make this if you don't have wine or sherry to make it with, and always make sure you use enough garlic and butter/olive oil.  Made this for a friend and my husband with crusty bread, white rice, and salad. They loved me for it.  Thanks.

I'm just as happy as the shrimp b/c my husband loved it!  I always take a gamble with him when trying a new dish.
I followed the recipe as written but added 1/2 butter & 1/2 basil flavored olive oil when sauteing the shrimp and chicken broth for the wine.  I used cooked shrimp but next time will try fresh. As one cook submitted, be careful not to over cook the shrimp or they will be rubbery. Next time serve with sugar snap peas or broccoli.
Great flavor. Looking forward to the leftovers which will taste even better after seasoning a day.

A quick and easy meal.  Came up short on how much shrimp I actually needed, but it still came out pretty good.  The only handicap I have when making these meals is that the Spousal Unit cannot have any sort of spicy food.  Had to leave out the Cayenne Pepper.  Course, I just added a little to my plate and I have to admit the dish is much better with it in.

Company worthy and easy to make!  I increased the garlic for a more flavorful taste.

This was really good.  I added chicken stock instead of white wine as I have a young child.  Added some veggies (mushrooms and asparagus) which made it even more yummy.

It was delicious!  I used half butter and half olive oil.  I will definitely make this dish again. I did put in mushrooms and left out green onions. My only suggestion is if you like sauce, I would make a little bit more sauce, we barely had enough sauce for two, we are both sauce lovers!

This was good.  I didn't have any fresh basil, and I'm sure that would change the flavor.  I used some fresh spinach and some mushroom instead and it was still good. I would make it again & probably try it with the basil next time.

I used chicken broth as I had no white wine.  It was excellent.  The only thing, I will do next time is double the sauce.

Excellent and easy recipe. Consider doubling the sauce or possibly omitting the pasta as the pasta was quite dry. Will be making this recipe in the future.

I substituted Chicken Broth for the White Wine.  I thought I had Cayenne Pepper but I didn't so it wasn't spicy. Even with my changes, it was very tasty.  I served it over spaghetti.

I used edamame pasta instead of regular. Not only was it delicious and very easy, high protein without the carbs.  My wife is not big on tomatos so the next time I'll use half peppers and half tomatos.

My boyfriend made this tonight as a belated Valentine's Day dinner.  He cut the recipe in half, added mushrooms, and instead of Roma tomatoes he used stewed tomatoes because we had a can open in the fridge.   He served it over spaghetti squash and the result was amazing.  This recipe is delicious and a keeper.

Made this dish for our Valentine's Day dinner. We loved it!  I used half and half, added a tablespoon of unsalted butter at the end of making the sauce. Served it with whole grain angel hair pasta. When I make it again, I'm going to double the sauce if I serve it with pasta.

This was delicious!  I used dry basil because that's what I had.  I gave it only 4 stars because I had to double the sauce to make enough.  It wouldn't have been as good as written.

It was delicious! Easy prep and goes lovely with a slice of garlic toast. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and a bit less butter. I'm newer to home cooking so would recommend Thaw and drain extra liquid off shrimp before cooking to save on simmer time.

If you don't have fresh basil, a spoonful of pesto added to the sauce does the trick.

Very, very tasty! I didn't have whipping cream so I used whole milk and it was just perfect. I also added broccoli, yellow and red peppers. Served it with a combo of rice and quinoa. Filling!

Delicious.  I used cooked shrimp, so I just added it in at the end to heat through.  I like spicy food, and this needed a little more.  Served it with zoodles (spiralized zucchini noodles) and really enjoyed it.

Was great. I added mushrooms and substituted chicken broth for wine. Perfect amount of sauce.

This is a great recipe but it needs a bit more cream in the sauce.  I doubled what the recipe calls for and it was just perfect.  We had friends over who do not drink alcohol so I substituted chicken broth for the white wine.

Okay I live in UT and made this last night. I normally don't follow recipes too much but I didn't vary from this one too much. I didn't have linguine in the pantry so I used something called a 'fino' noodle. cooked it separate. Med Shrimp was on sell at Smiths for $5.99 lb. so I ended up buying 1 1/2 lbs. I ended up adding the drained fino noodle to the shrimp mix when it was done (Stirred it up) and then added another 1/2 ? C cream and another pinch of cayenne pepper. I served it with a bit of shaved parm cheese and another shake of the cayenne pepper. OMG this is a keeper I served it with Hot Naan Bread with Garlic spread. Super easy to make and it would impress your guests!

I used extra wine and quite a bit more garlic. I liked this recipe, but found myself having to use more salt than I would like to enhance the flavor.

Tasty and super fast. If I hadn't needed to peel my shrimp,  I could have had dinner in the table in under 20 minutes. I tossed mine with some shirataki noodles and was able to have a big helping for under 300 calories. Hooray!

Made exactly as directed.  It was delicious!!  Used some left over German Riesling wine and in my opinion you must not substitute for the wine with broth etc.  Served over linguini and will definitely make again!!

Excellent recipe. This was one of my first experiences with making a cream sauce and I'm happy it was pretty simple. I'm a little lazy so I used pre-cooked shrimp, I also doubled the sauce. I serve this on linguine (hence the extra sauce, I'm kind of a fat kid haha).

I had to double the recipe and as people kept coming in to eat I saw that I needed more sauce.  There were two lb of fresh large shrimp in there so that was plenty,  so I added some more wine and cream and some more garlic powder. and at the end I sprinkled a good amount of parmesan cheese to help it get a little thicker.  My family ate it all.!

This recipe as written is very very good. It also lends itself to modifications;such as  using light cream, a quality butter substitute such as I can not believe this is not butter. Recipe will also work with precooked shrimp with alterations in cooking technique. My review is based on original recipe ...This one is a keeper.... great as submitted and flexible enough to allow for some modification to accommodate alteration for taste , nutritional requirements or component availability...

This dish was delicious.  I had to use half and half cream and as a result, the sauce did not thicken up as it should have; however, it was still very tasty.  Everyone thought it could have used additional sauce, but  we all agreed that we would have it again.  Served it with angel hair pasta.  Yum

Love this dish so much I am writing my first review! I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and canned tomatoes. Wasn't sure how the canned tomatoes would turn out but I used garlic and onion flavor tomatoes and they were great. The cayenne pepper gave the dish a nice kick without being too hot. Will definitely make this again.

This was quick and tasty.  I used a small amount of oil instead butter. Also, I used 2% milk instead of the cream. I added mushrooms that I sauteed before putting with other ingredients. I only had a half pound of shrimp. I will make this again.

This was an easy recipe to make. It was full of flavor. The only thing I did differently was I added parmesan cheese to the sauce to add a little bit more flavor and make the sauce cheesy. Everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

Good flavor! Served it with whole wheat spaghettini. Cut back on the cayenne since my family isn't big on heat. Definitely making this again.

Jeff really liked this.  I really liked too, only the angel hair pasta, which I tossed it with, kind of soaked up all the sauce.  I would either add the angel hair to the shrimp and sauce in the pan or use a larger size pasta.

Great picture with a good recipe.  Quick and easy, except I never use heavy cream and always have a bit of curdling.  I never learn. Make it with spaghetti.

We’re lucky enough to have shrimp that was 1 hour out of the bay.   Love shrimping season!  We wanted to try something different this time then the normal stir-fry or bbq.  So happy we did, this is really delish!  I doubled the sauce, used whole wheat pasta, fat free half and half, a favorite WA wine (Gewurztraminer) and topped it with parmesan cheese.  The sauce would be good with steamed clams or fish. Thank you for the recipe.

Great dish, just needs more sauce.  My husband mixed the final sauce and shrimp mixture with almost a whole box of pasta and the noodles really soaked up the sauce.  It was still delish   next time I will just double the sauce recipe.

This was a great base. I didn't have all the ingredients so go creative and omitted the half and half, used grape tomatoes and sauted then added a large handful of kale, squeezed a half lemon.... Saute, saute, saute....and served with some brown rice sprinkled with fresh parm. Bam-tastic!

This dish was delicious! I followed the recipe as instructed, but I did add a little seasoning to the shrimp before cooking them. My 13 year old picky son loved it and wanted MORE...I will be sure to make this again.

This is wonderful.  The second (and third) time I made it I also added a dozen fresh sea scallops.  I pan seared them first and then added them to the dish at the end.  Oh, if you do this double your sauce (or tripple if you love it like we do).  Making it again this week for my boyfriend's birthday.

Really nice, light pasta meal. I didn't add any salt and pepper, but will probably add a small amount of both next time plus a little more cayenne to enhance the flavor.

So GOOD! I followed recipe with all fresh ingredients. I did, however, substitute cream cheese instead of heavy cream and slowly added about 1/2 of cup milk after cream cheese melted down. I also served it over white rice instead of pasta.

This was outstanding!  I doubled the butter, cream and wine.  Used 1 tsp dried basil and about 1/8 tsp cayenne.  Added a small can of mushrooms and skipped the tomatoes.  I served this with thin spaghetti and some parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top.  The sauce seemed thin but turned out to be just perfect, not heavy, SO tasty!

This was so delicious!  My husband immediately told me to add it to my "top 5!"  I did make some changes, however.  In place of the heavy cream, I used feta cheese. In place of the white wine, I used Kudos Red. Also added a good pinch of cumin and black pepper. The pasta was  spaghetti, angle hair and rotini.   I'll probably make this every other week - it was that good!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Absolutely love this recipe and have made it several times now.  I have substituted dried basil if I didn't have fresh on hand and use white cooking wine (lasts forever in the pantry, no refrigeration required so it's always available).   Recipe is great as is and can be modified based on ingredients you have in the house.   Have used shallots instead of green onion and half and half instead of heavy cream.  All work well.   Thanks for a winning recipe!

I had high hopes for this recipe  but was sadly disappointed.  The taste  wasn't anything special.  It was so bland.  By the time I had to add all the extra ingredients to make it taste good it was no longer the original written recipe.

The sauce was rather thin and I only used half and half because that is what I had.  So I added flour and water mixture to thicken it.  Hubby loved it.

Great  dish and simple to make.  Thanks to the reviews of others , I  did increase the heavy cream and wine ( easy on the wine addition) as it does not make enough sauce .  I have made a few times and have slowly increased the cayenne pepper and  we like it even more.  I recently replaced the fresh tomatoes with sun dried tomatoes  and we  love that as well.  Served on angel hair pasta with  steamed broccoli .  Will try with chicken breast soon.

It was just delicious. I am so happy to have found this recipe!  THANK YOU @proudwife !! This has been my favourite dish in Piegari restaurant but this recipe is actually yummier. I served this sauce to feed 4 over black fusilli pasta and I made a few tweaks : 1) I put half a glass white wine, 2) used about 300mls cream 3) used 3 big garlic cloves minced 4) used about 300 grams cherry tomatoes cut in quarters 5) added half a Shrimp Stock cube dissolved in the wine.

Tripled the amount of sauce, doubled the garlic, added chopped zucchini. Added thin somen noodles to cook in the sauce. Bad idea! The noodles cooked fine, but it made the sauce way too thick and gummy. I had to add almost a full cup of water to thin it out. BUT it still came out awesome. The flavor is amazing. Next time will omit noodles and have the crusty bread instead.

Good. We did use red pepper flakes instead of cayenne because we like it spicy.  Served over noodles.

Very good!! I served mine over angel hair pasta. DO not use a substitute for the wine. I used apple cider vinegar cut with water... and it made small curds...thank goodness for the fat content because they cooked out within the ten minute cooking time.  Even with this mistake, the flavor was still wonderful!

This is a dish to impress!  I made the recipe as directed, except I did substitute the cayenne pepper for a couple of dashes of red pepper flakes!  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I want to try this with scallops too!

So good! I added more garlic, more cayenne, and a dallop of cream cheese...I didn't cook shrimp as long as recipe said and added pasta to completed  sauce! I have made 2 times  already! Delish!

Just made this recipe for the first time, excellent! I made it exactly as written using fresh basil, tomato, and onion from my tiny garden :)  I used a small pinch of cayenne pepper as stated.  I like some spice, but not hot food. I believe the cream and the butter tame the cayenne quite a bit.  Fantastic as is, but next time I will add a little more cayenne pepper.

I thought this dish was bland.  I don't know why. Maybe it would have been better with a sauterne or even a sherry wine.....

This is a great find! There are only 2 of us so I used the recipe adjustment feature. The only advice I would give is to double the sauce. I used 1/2 & 1/2 (didn't have cream) & Fideo pasta instead of longer spaghetti style. Was really good & I will definitely be making this again!

Fantastic recipe.  I added a few scallops and used coconut milk instead of cream.  It was a great hit and I will make it again.

I will rate this recipe as I made it (there were a couple of alterations). I added the wine (a little more than called for), cream and dried basil (didn't have fresh) to the juices left by the shrimp. This made the sauce very soupy. I forgot to add the pepper (we like spicy food so probably a big error here). I added chunky spaghetti sauce since I had no other tomatoes on hand. My husband and I had one conclusion: there are better uses for shrimp but that wouldn't stop me from eating this again. It's likely won't make it again.

So absolutely loved this.  Made exactly except used cooking wine instead of drinking wine.  Next time I'll double everything except for the shrimp (basically, I'll be doubling the sauce and spices).  Served over linguini.  Loved it.  Will even be better with more sauce to go around.  LOVED LOVED LOVED.

I like to make Shrimp Scampi for my wife, this is like Shrimp Scampi with a delicious white sauce served over pasta.  It is delicious!  I did leave out the tomatoes though. If this was available in a restaurant, I wouldn't hesitate to order it. It is our current favorite shrimp recipe.

Perfect basil cream sauce.  I'm so glad I tried this exceptional recipe. Excellent as is,  I wouldn't try to change or add to the basil flavor with other spices. If you're serving over pasta, make more sauce.  5 stars!

It's a basic recipe, but a good one. I've been making a slightly dressier version for years by sauteeing a package of cremini mushrooms first until the mushrooms lose their water, then proceeding with the recipe (albeit with a little less garlic because garlic gives me migraines if I overdo it), and topping the whole thing with some sliced ripe olives for color contrast. Even without the additions I usually make, the recipe deserves a solid 4 stars. I liked it.

I was out of basil and prepared the dish without it.  It was still absolutely delicious.  The only change I would make would be the name of the recipe.  It should be called "Happy Hubby".  Thanks proudwife.

This was very good.  I used one and one-half pounds of large shrimp  (for 3 people).  We like shrimp.  I used dry basil.  I didn't have fresh on hand.  Fresh is always better.   I used yellow onion because I was out of green onion, used half & half, as someone suggested to cut back on calories.  Lastly, I cut grape tomatoes in half because that's what I had on hand.  This one is a keeper.  Can't wait to make again in 7-10 days.  :)

This is absolutely delicious. We both loved the sauce it was light an creamy. The only thing I did different is added hot sauce instead of Cayenne pepper as I was out. The flavors were delish! Thank you and follow the recipe as is unless you are out of something!!

Delicious. I doubled the wine and cream as I was worried I wouldn't have enough sauce, putting it over pasta. I'm glad I did.  Also, I used half and half instead of cream.

This is wonderful!  We didn't use tomatoes, and we had some Pesto that needed to be used up so we used that instead of basil.  Served with Garlic Bread.  Instead of Cayenne we used Crushed Red Pepper flakes.  YUMM!

It was easy to make, and delicious. Would have made it 5 star and a favorite but for the amount of fat in it. It was too heavy for angel hair pasta (we had it that way), and greasy on the mouth. I will add broccoli or asparagus and use linguine or fettuccine in the future and make it as a special indulgence.

Love it.  Very easy recipe to make.  I did not have white wine so I used red Moscato diluted with seafood broth.  I also used sweet peppers instead of the plum tomatoes.  Served over thin spaghetti.  Will definitely prepared again.  Only served about 3 people.

This was okay for a one time meal.  My sauce never did thicken up.  But it was tastey.

Sooooo good! every single time I try a recipe I like to follow it to the T and this came out supppper delicious! The sauce is light but just right. If you would like more sauce just double the recipe on the sauce. I made mashed potatoes on the side with some garlic bread!

This was excellent! I had to vary by using half and half as opposed to heavy cream as it was what was on hand and had no time to run to store. Otherwise, followed to a tee. Served it over linguine and there was enough sauce that the pasta was not dry, but very flavorful. Super easy to make and whole family loved this. A definite keeper!

The whole family enjoyed it and because I used angel hair pasta, we had more than enough for this family of five.  I didn't use basil this time because it's early and my basil plant is small. Instead, I used fresh oregano and thyme. It would probably be good with whatever fresh  herbs and you have on hand. This one is definitely a keeper.

Very good...this dish will become one of our regulars.  We did half shrimp and half very small sea scallops.  We had to thicken the sauce a little at the end because it wouldn't thicken, but it was tasty and enjoyed by the whole family.  Served over angel hair and it was perfect with the tiny shrimp and scallops.

My 5yo loved this recipe! He said it was his favorite meal and was up there with cookies, but Oreos still beat it. :) I made a few modifications. I used chicken stock as I didn't have wine (I know, travesty!) ands killed on the cream. I added some spinach leaves and grape tomatoes and Parmesan cheese. Also switched the cayenne pepper for paprika. Very good!

My husband and I both LOVED this~ So much so he asked me to make a point of saving it so we could have it again!  :)  He told me he was at first disappointed that it wasn't a white sauce (the tomatoes and cayenne had turned it pink), but when he tasted it, he thought it tasted great and was very flavorful. Yum! It's a definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing!  It DID make us happy!

We really enjoyed this recipe. As several reviews suggested, I doubled the wine and cream and added parmesean cheese, but I found it was still too runny, so I thickened it with a bit of cornstarch mixed with more cream. I also used finely chopped onion in place of the green onion, because that's all I had. I served it with Fiorelli noodles and a side of roasted asperagus.
Next time I make it, I will use a third tomato and take the skins off them before adding them.
As a rule, both my husband and I prefer a red sauce with pasta, but this was so good (not to mention quick and easy), I will definitely make it many more times.
Thanks for a yummy recipe!

Wonderful flavor, easy to make.  Just right on the spice, but hubby added a bit more.  Didn't have cream so used sour cream, used chopped red onion, still delicious.  Served 2, probably double sauce next time, but will make again and again. Great for company!

Delicious!! I doubled the sauce as well - including extra garlic and another tsp of butter. I added 4-5 taps of Cajun seasoning and 3-4 pinches of cayenne and still needed more... It was just barely some taste of spice. Bon appetite !

easy & quick shrimp pasta! only thing I added was some parmesean (or 4-cheese italian mix), sprinkled on top before serving over pasta noodles.
can also use beer instead of wine; and milk instead of cream.

Easy to make and great taste! The only thing I changed was I puréed the tomatoes. I also doubled the sauce recipe because I find there is always more pasta than sauce.  This worked out perfect. I served it with garlic bread and I mopped up the last drop. Perfectly spicy and creamy.

I tried this recipe as written- except I doubled the sauce ingredients, and served it over angel hair pasta. My BF and I thought it was delicious.

This recipe is great! We switched out the cayenne for our preferred chili pepper (Matanzas chilis from the Spice and Tea Exchange), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It's a lovely mix of flavors and the sauce mixes great with the angel hair pasta. We had leftover angel hair pasta with lemon and pea greens, and it was a great base for these shrimp.

I tried this for supper last night. Very tasty.  It really brings out the flavours of the herbs and tomatoes add to that.. A hint of cayenne pepper gives it just the right amount of zip!  I served it on top of angel hair pasta and if I make it again for a dinner party of four I would double the recipe so that there would be plenty of sauce to be mixed thru the pasta!

This is so easy and delicious; this will be in my regular rotation.  I didn’t have any fresh basil so I used dried.  Also, I didn’t have any green onions so I sprinkled chopped chives over the top at the end after it was tossed with spaghetti. I loved it.

This was fairly easy to make and all ingredients are found in local grocery stores.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp because I had 2 12 oz packages and fresh parsley instead of the basil, for the same reason. For the wine, I used Chardonnay.  I will make it again.

We made this twice. The first time we used 30 CT shrimp which were too big. It was much better with fresh med NC shrimp. We also didn't add too much cayenne pepper as we don't like hot food. We served it over rice first than noddle’s both were good. We doubled the sauce.

Half way through making the recipe I did a quick taste thought the recipe would be bland, but the finished product was amazing!!  I have since made this over and over.  The recipe as is, is definitely a 5 star.  If you want to change it up a bit I often substitute a dollop of sour cream and some whole milk for the heavy whipping cream.  Sometimes I add a 1/3cup shredded mozzarella to it also.  Again this recipe AS IS is still a 5 star!

Very good. Sauce was alittle thin, and not much to go around. I used 2 pkg frozen uncooked large shrimp. Maybe double the sauce.

This recipe is pretty tasty.  I served it over pasta like some other reviewers suggested.  As written, it's a main dish meat serving and doesn't make enough sauce to serve over pasta.   Also - while it is tasty, it's not tasty enough to justify the fat.  I will make it again, but use less butter, try fat free half and half, and not serve it on pasta.

This was wonderful.  I made it for my 15 years old's Birthday dinner.  The only change I made was I used apple juice instead of wine since we don't use alcohol in our cooking.  It turned out wonderful and my soon to be 12 and 14 year old children want me to make this for their birthdays too.  It will definitely be on our menu again.

Wow, I made this last night and it was absolutely wonderful.  I used half & half instead of heavy cream and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I also added about 3 tablespoons of parmesan to the sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

This was great!  However, I didn't have all the spices called for so I used Ground Ginger and it came out so well.  Also, on the healthier side I used Fat Free Half-Half.  The sauce reduced perfectly.  My husband really enjoyed it and he is very hard to please.

This was simply delicious!  A quick meal to prepare and cook....doubled the ingredients for the sauce as other viewers had suggested, served with Brown rice vermicelli.....made exactly as directed and it was a huge hit with our guests. Served with Ceasar salad and french baguette.  Next time, I might add scallops and/or broccoli to the mix. It was a dish you'd expect at a fine restaurant....Yummmmmmmmy!
