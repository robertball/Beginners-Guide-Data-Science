We loved this sauce!  The only thing I did different was sprinkle with macadamia nuts because we have plenty from a tree in our yard.  My hubby  said it was the best fish he had ever eaten.  I will try the same sauce on tilapia.

I'd recommend a little less cayene pepper.

Super easy! I will make this again! Next time, I will probably only use 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, as this was really spicy!

Nice flavors. The tomatoes are a perfect addition. Next time I might cook the fish sous vide first, as it's tricky to get it exactly right otherwise, even with a thermometer. I cut the cayenne waaay back, and it was still spicy with the spicy peppers on the bottom.
