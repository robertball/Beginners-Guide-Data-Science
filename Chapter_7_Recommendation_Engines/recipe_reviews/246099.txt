I enjoyed this recipe.  Other reviewers said it was bland.  But in actuality, Chicken Parm is not a spiced or highly flavored dish.  Americans tend to overdo the flavor on marinara. If you want flavor and spice go for Chicken Arrabiata.

Made this for dinner this evening.  I followed the recipe exactly though some extra seasoning wouldn't go amiss next time.    I used chicken tenders for this dish and the cooking time was right on.  I'll take the foil off sooner so that the cheese can brown a bit. Overall, this was a good dish - quick and easy

i agree 100% with other reviewers when they say that this dish is as good as the pasta sauce that you use. i used my own. This recipe could use some pizzaz in the way of some fresh herbs such as parsley or basil. We really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again!

I took the advice of the other reviewers and made sure I used a really good sauce. With the melted cheese, it really made the dish... and so glad because it was quite delicious. Easy to make, quick, everyone was happy and the chicken was very tender.

I made this using mushroom flavoured sauce (I didn't love the sauce, and the dish is all about the sauce), cut the chicken into smaller pieces (mine was thick & slightly frozen), and used Italian Blend Cheese on top instead of Mozzarella because my grocery store didn't have any. We really liked it, but would add extra seasonings next time & choose a different sauce (maybe just a tomato basil type). Will definitely make again (& will likely use the Italian blend again as it was very tasty), but would change the sauce & season the chicken first. Try it: it's good & easy!

This was super simple to put together, my hubby happened to pick up thin sliced chicken breasts and it worked great for this recipe!  I also agree that the sauce you choose will definitely make or break this recipe so choose one of your favorites!  My family licked their plates and the left overs did not last long!!

I used homemade spicy tomato sauce, so i had no problems with blandness. Also, my chicken breasts were a bit  larger so i upped the baking time by 5 mins and broiled them until my mozzarella bubbled and browned a bit, about 5 mins. I served it with a broccoli salad and poppyseed dressing to get those veggies in, and tone down the spiciness of my sauce. So simple and will definitely make again! Thanks cracker barrel!

I love cooking chicken in sauce! Adding cheese prior to heating is always a great idea. We used a chunky home made one because this recipe can only be as good as the sauce. It's nice to have a parm recipe that is so quick and doesn't include the extra steps of breading and frying. Healthier too! Having the cheese pre-shredded is another time saver. Some in our family are avoiding pasta right now and they had theirs on cooked spaghetti squash.  The others had regular Barilla spaghetti. I tasted both and YUM!  Wish I could give 4.5 stars. Thanks Cracker Barrel!

This recipe is a fantastic base, especially for someone who is looking for an incredibly easy and lightning fast meal (long day anyone)?
I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was really good, and the chicken was really moist, but it was lacking a little bit in flavour.  Next time I'll definitely add some veggies, mushrooms, garlic, and maybe some chili peppers.  
I will definitely make this again.

This recipe cooks up fairly quickly but I prefer my cheese browned and this method of cooking doesn't allow that. I had small chicken breasts , 4 oz., and after cooking them for 30 minutes the internal temp was 196.  This recipe depends on the quality of the sauce for success as there are no other seasonings so choose wisely.  If I were to make this again I would lower the oven temp and remove the foil earlier.

I enjoyed this. It was simple to prepare and could easily be out together on a week night. I loved the fact that there was no breadcrumbs, it was a nice change . My chicken breasts were on the larger side, and the cooking time was spot on. The sauce you choose will either make or break the dish because the lack of seasonings and herbs. Make sure you use the best or make your own. Cheese in the sauce was great!

This was a tasty and fast weeknight dinner. I baked mine a little longer as I had 5 breasts that were a little larger. Since there is no seasonings, the sauce used really determines the success or failure of this recipe, I used a spicy sauce which added some flavour to the chicken, as did the Parmesan, which we enjoyed. Served over whole wheat pasta with sauteed onions, peppers, zucchini and mushrooms.

Followed directions precisely and found the result to be lacking flavor.  would recommend seasoning the chicken, breading it and pan frying it prior to baking it in the sauce.

Having very finicky kids, I was pleasantly surprised that they LOVED IT!  After reading reviews of lack of flavor, I decided to use the Perdue Perfect Portions Italian Style chicken breasts and my favorite pre-made sauce, Classico Four Cheese.  It had TONS of flavor and I will definitely add this one to the rotation!

I used 4 breasts and 30 minutes was not enough time to cook them properly. Had to microwave them for 4 minutes to get them to 160 degrees.  I used Classico Spicy Red Pepper pasta sauce and this  dish reminded me very much of canned spaghetti or spaghetti-o's.  Not very good and will not be repeating. Sure it's easy to put together but parmesan and mozzarella is not cheap and neither are chicken breasts so for something that's a bit  expensive, it really isn't very good.

Loved this, with my personal substitutions. We prefer our chicken parm with breaded chicken, so I bought frozen, breaded chicken breasts (didn't have energy to do this from scratch). Cooked the breaded chicken according to the directions. I also bought sliced mozzarella - just a personal preference. The type of pasta sauce I used made it tasty- used 1/2 jar Tomato & Basil + 1/2 jar Roasted Tomato & Garlic (mixed leftovers into 1 jar & froze for next time ??). And to make clean up a tad easier, I coated my casserole dish lightly with olive oil. I cooked everything according to instructions with my personal substitutes. It was easy; my husband and I enjoyed it immensely. Definitely making again and again!

Easy and good. The chicken took 45 minutes to cook in the preheated oven though. To melt the cheese, I put it on broil for about a minute or two.

I almost never change a recipe the first time I make it. The exception being the times I don't have the exact ingredient (fresh garlic vs powdered) or an ingredient we don't like (i.e. Mushrooms). That being said, I just couldn't bring myself to toss raw chicken breasts into the sauce mixture. Therefore, I lightly seasoned the breasts with salt and pepper, then quickly browned both sides in olive oil. That's the only thing I changed and this was absolutely delicious!!!  Much quicker than the mess of breaded chicken. I will definitely make this part of our rotation. Thank you for the recipe!!!

Oven pre-heated to 195C then when is time to cook:
""Bake 30 minutes or until chicken is done (79 degrees C)."

We liked this but the consensus was there was nothing special about it. Good basic recipe.

Made using Bacon Alfredo pasta sauce.  Tasty but a little salty.  Would make again.
