These were delicious! I used the juice and zest of one lime because we like heavy lime flavor. It doesn’t make very much though. I will double the recipe next time.

We tried making this twice. . Both times it had good flavor, but it didn't not rise much at all. It was pretty flat.

It was too sweet for me and needed more lime flavor.  I wanted he citrus flavor to overide the sweet.  I am not sure I will make them again unless I adapt the receipe  to those changes.

11.21.16  The recipe says to “grease a 9x5 loaf pan,” but then instructs you to “cut into bars” after they’ve cooled.  I have notified AR that this doesn't make sense, probably just a typo..  Blondies typically are baked in a square pan, like brownies, so I used an 8x8-inch pan.  I doubled the lime juice and lime zest and still think the lime flavor is weak.  I cut into 9 servings (not 6), and on the positive side, they are quite good and quite easy to make.  Garnished with a dusting of powdered sugar.
