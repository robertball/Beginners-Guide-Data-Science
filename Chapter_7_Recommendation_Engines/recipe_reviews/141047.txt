Very good, but I made a few changes. I used 3 eggs instead of 6, added more cinncamon and pecan pieces. Turned out wonderfully.

This is my first bread pudding and it came out amazing! I didn't re-fridge the bread pudding over night, but I did soak the bread for 10 mins and made sure the bread was fully soaked. I made half the recipe, used all milk instead of adding heavy cream, and also instead of having plane chopped apple for the top I added 1 tablespoon of butter (melted), 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Mixed it all together and spread it over the bread pudding. It came out tasty, moist, and perfectly sweetened. And, instead of using nutmeg, I used a all spice blend to give it more of a stronger spice taste. My husband ate half of it and he's not a fan of bread pudding. I will be making this again for sure.

I felt it needed more flavor.  My apples were still crispy after an additional 35 minutes of cooking time, and was still vey moist.  I will try it again, adding a brown sugar crumble on top andpossably some caramel sauce.

Almost becomes a souffl√© in the oven!  Very good as a dessert as well as a breakfast casserole.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half and all seemed well.  Nice way to use a lot of eggs and leftover fall apples.  Perhaps a little cinnamon heavy but still a great dish overall!  I made a rum sauce and my family loved it as a dessert for several days!  Very nice!

First time I've made bread pudding and it was great! I used 4 eggs, low fat milk and no cream. Soaked the bread for 10 minutes and also cut down the sugar in half and felt the sweetness was perfect. Will be making again.

Yum-my! This was my first bread pudding attempt, and I'm glad I found this recipe. I did a of couple things differently: added 1/4 cup apple cider to the egg mixture, just because I wanted it a little more moist and "appley." Took about 10 mins longer to bake, but still came out great. I also omitted the diced apples on top, and poured a bit of  half and half over individual servings. Super recipe, thank you!

It was just okay. My son didn't really like it, my daughter wouldn't touch it and I thought it was too sweet (even though I used half the sugar called for in the recipe). It left my kitchen smelling like burnt sugar for half an hour, though I'm not sure why.

I used two apples on the bottom of pan and two apples on top. I also used a 13.5 oz can of coconut milk instead of milk and the cream since I can't have dairy and increased cooking time by 15 mins.. LOVED  IT!!

Turned out good. Kids really liked it. I added custard as a topping. Nice just to throw something in the oven in morning and then eat with all prep done night before.

Next time I will choose a different bread. The French bread was fine, just made it taste more like French Toast reversed a dessert.

Very tasty - hubby and kids loved it. Tried this for something different for breakfast.  Used french bread since that is what i had to use up, golden delicious apples, no riasins, and half the brown sugar.  Versatile recipe that i will be making again.
