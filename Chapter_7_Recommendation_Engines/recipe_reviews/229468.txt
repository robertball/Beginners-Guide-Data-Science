If you like sweet bbq sauce, this one will do it. But I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and it was still sickening sweet. Next time, I'll cut it even more. It's a good sauce, I liked it, got all of that sweet and sour tang and bite I was looking for, just too sweet.

I don’t know how Kansas City BBQ sauce is supposed to taste, but we liked this recipe...a lot!  Had a bunch of ingredients, but they all had a good balance.  This had just the right amount of spiciness for us, you could taste the cayenne, but it didn’t overwhelm.  We did the omit the liquid smoke because we don’t care for it, and I think we’d cut back the Truvia a little next time, as it was just a bit too sweet.  I have a favorite BBQ sauce I’ve been making for years that I clipped from the paper (Chickashaw Sauce from Jake’s Ribs in Chickashaw, Oklahoma), but this could be a candidate for our new favorite sauce.  It’s a keeper.

This is so delicious. Substituted sugar for only 1/2 cup stevia in the Raw.  Still was too sweet. But awesome.

I used no salt added tomato sauce, one can and 1/4 cup no salt ketchup, eliminated the additional salt, for a tasty low sodium version. I used apple cider vinegar and substituted a small amount of brown sugar for sweetener. I was out of cinnamon so I cooked with a cinnamon stick. Looking forward to having it with my pulled pork I cooked in the crockpot.
