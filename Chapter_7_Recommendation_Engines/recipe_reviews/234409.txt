I don't keep Miracle Whip in the house, I used Hellman's mayonnaise instead. This did need more mayonnaise than what was asked for. I cut the sugar way back to two tablespoons and I used white wine vinegar. Very simple side dish I could throw together before work. The longer this sits, the better it gets. Next time I will take the previous reviewer's suggestion and add sunflower seeds.

This is a very basic broccoli salad recipe.  I ended up using prosciutto in place of bacon because I was making something for another recipe and had extra.  I also like to add some sunflower seeds for even more crunch.  THANKS for the recipe!

I have made this salad about twenty times. It is a family favorite, and a great go-to for summer salads. I frequently pack it in my lunches for work and it keeps for days. I have made adjustments from the first time but this review is for the original recipe. Excellent! a little on the sweet side, but I have since reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and it is still sweet enough for my sweet tooth. On other occasions, I have added craisins, and had to substitute green onions for the red since I didn't have any on-hand. The fact that I can make substitutions or add things just speaks to it's versatility. Thank you for this recipe!

A nice and tasty broccoli/cauliflower salad recipe.  I only had enough vegetables to make a small batch, so I just changed the servings size and proceeded from there.  Loved the dressing on this, but I'm a Miracle Whip® kinda gal.  We enjoyed this salad with 'Mini Meatball Subs' from AR.

Tasty. Would cut down on the sugar by more than half. Used apple cider vinegar and added salad topper for nut and cranberry

I can't get enough of this salad!  I ran by the local Farmers Market and picked up the broccoli and cauliflower and the rest of the items I already had on hand.  I honestly wasn't expecting this salad to be so good, but now I can't stop thinking about it.  It was so easy to make and good gracious, the next day it tasted even better.

Great base recipe. I adjusted the bacon to a full package. I also added sunflower seeds (3/4 cup).  I diced an 8 oz block of sharp cheddar rather than shredded cheddar.  I also increased the miracle whip to 1 cup. Very refreshing for a summer meal!!

Delicious broccoli cauliflower salad! I used half mayo and half plain Greek yogurt trying to lighten it up a bit. Still delicious! Perfect side to take to a summer cookout!

I’ve made this salad for years and I always get rave reviews! I use real bacon pieces (not bits) rather than frying the bacon and it works wonderfully. I also add a handful or two of Craisins. Be sure to make it ahead of time because it becomes more flavorful as it sits in the fridge.

I really like this salad. The only thing I'd do differently is add less sugar. It was too sweet for my taste.
