This was great. I made it for a party, so I doubled the cream cheese, feta, and garlic. Added an entire can of artichoke hearts (pulled apart by hand), and only one box of thawed spinach. Completely skipped the ranch per suggestions, and added some cracked black pepper. Mounded it in the center of a plate, covered with plastic and chilled it for about 2 hours before serving it alongside baked pita chips. Was completely gone by the end of the night! Will make again.

I did not add the ranch dressing, I added about 1/2tbs of parm cheese instead, used the sundried tomato basil feta cheese. I prepared this the night before the party just to save time. The SECRET to this dip being fantastic is: ***HEAT*** this up in the oven about 10-15 minutes & the flavors taste incrediable melted together. I served this with the "pita chips" from this site. I think between the pita chips & this dip---this is the BEST appetizer you could ask for. Thank you!

This is good, but the Ranch dressing makes it taste too canned and salty - don't forget the feta is already salty!  It also covers the feta taste...

This was a big hit at a bachelorette pary I attended over the weekend.  I didn't even bother with the ranch dressing mix - just seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and dried parsley.  I also rolled it in sliced almonds to make it look nicer.  I will definitely make this again!

This was pretty good, I'd make it again with modifications. It was easy to shape into a ball. I would warn people not to add the entire package of ranch dressing mix all at once...add a little at a time and taste along the way.  I added only half of it, and it was too salty for me at that point (and I normally love salty foods!) so I ended up adding an entire can of artichoke hearts, plus an additional 10-oz package of spinach, and only that cut the salt down, but it was still fairly salty.

Great dip, I used half of the ranch dressing mix and I also put all of the ingredients into my food processor and mixed it that way.  The ladies at work all asked for the recipe.

Made this as wriitten for a Halloween party, everyone loved this (even young kids). Will make again. I am going to try it with only 1/2 a pack of ranch dressing just to see how it turns out.

Update tried this again for Thanksgiving and we liked it better without the ranch mix. Still  very good both ways.

What a fantastic recipe! I'm a big fan of feta, so when I came across this recipe, I had to try it. Huge hit at our New Year's Eve party.  Took advice of previous reviews & cut the ranch mix by half. Next time, I'll probably cut it back a bit more.  I also rolled it in chopped walnuts to make it "pretty".  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

My DH and I thought this was excellent after trying it before I rolled it into a ball and covered it in sliced almonds as a few other reviewers had.  I am taking to a baby shower today for my stepdaughter and I am sure it will impress.  I wanted to make sure there was enough to go around so I modified the recipe as follows:  2 10 pkgs of frozen spinach which I squeezed with my hands really hard to get juice out.  One 8 oz. pkg cream cheese (used the 1/3 less fat) 10 oz. pkg of feta cheese, 14 oz. can of  artichoke hearts, 4 tsps. minced garlic and one heaping tbsp. of dry ranch dressing mix.  I didn't know whether to add the ranch dressing or leave it out based on other reviews and although I am sure it would be good without it, I am a ranch fan so I figured based on doubling most of the other ingredients, what I added would be subtle and I was not disappointed.  I am going upload a pic of the finished product and will try to update my review after the shower. UPDATE - Was a hit.  Wish I would have been bolder and ask to take home the leftovers.  Most was gone and only reason leftovers was there was ALOT of food there.  I think this is best when at room temp, brings out the creaminess!

We used this recipe as a base, left out the ranch, added some diced sun dried tomatoes and filled won ton wraps with it, folded them over, sealed and fried until golden brown than added a sprinkle of parm cheese over the top.  They were a hit!

I changed this quite a bit but it ended up being DEADLY good!! I didn't use the ranch at all. I used about 2 oz garlic and herb feta and about 2 oz regular feta. I also added about 1/2 tsp onion and garlic powder and pepper to taste and omitted the minced garlic. I used about four artichokes from the can and about a cup of squeezed out spinach. It turned out SOOO well! OMG! It was freakin FANTASTIC!!!

I am only rating this four stars because the ranch seasoning makes this too salty for my taste. I replaced the ranch seasoning with some prepared ranch dressing (about 3 Tbsp.) and added a little cracked black pepper. With these modifications itâ€™s definitely a 5 star recipe. A must try!

My mom made this for Thanksgiving - everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  Highly recommended, but it does need to be taken from refrigerator to soften up.

I made this exactly as suggested except I used half of the ranch mix.  It was great!  I took it to a Christmas party and everyone liked it.  It only took a few minutes.  I served it with pita chips but I think that mini-toast would be really good and not so salty.

Wonderful, I skipped the ranch mix.  Added dried parsly, oregano, salt, pepper and used lemon herb and plain feta cheese which provided the perfect seasoning.  Next time I will use either less spinach or more cream cheese,  it was more like a spinach ball then anything else.  I rolled it in almond pieces which made it look pretty and added flavor.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used less than 1/2 packet of ranch mix, will use more next time.  I liked it best heated!

I didn't use the ranch packet because feta cheese is already a really salty cheese.  It was AWESOME.  I also put in some extra artichoke hearts.  DELICIOUS!

Wonderful! As per several reviews below, I left the ranch dressing mix out completely. It really doesn't need it. I increased the garlic and served with those little crustini garlic toasts from the deli. It's been to several parties already. Definitely a keeper!

The 2 times I've made this recipe it was too wet to form into any decent looking "ball" so I simply put it in a bowl for people to scoop.  The first time I used frozen spinach as directed but the second time I used fresh, and still it was too wet.  What am I doing wrong?  The tastes, however, are spectacular.  It doesn't even need the ranch seasoning as I find that stuff too salty.  Half a pack is all you need if any at all.  Add some slivered almonds in with the ingredients and you'll have a great balance of textures.

I did not care for this recipe. With the ranch, without the ranch. It tasted like feta and spinach with no flavor. After all these great reviews I was very disappointed and embarrassed to serve this. I put a ton of white pepper in it to give it some taste and it did cut the salt factor. I think this might be good heated up but it needs spices or something added to it.

Super awesome.  I ommitted the ranch and used marinated artichoke hearts.  This was very popular at my get-together and I only had leftovers because I ran out of the toasted baguette I served it with.  The leftovers were awesome in a griled cheese sandwich with the ball spread where the cheese would usually be.  Very yummy.

This App was great- granted, the ranch combined with the feta made it a little salty.  For a little extra kick I added some fresh chopped chives.  Next time, I would say a little less ranch powder- and make sure that garlic is truely minced!!

Well, I'm finishing up this recipe as I write, and I must say that I tried a little bit of the mixture with just a tiny bit of ranch dressing in a separate bowl and I"m glad that I did.  It's a no brainer for me.  Definitely leave the Ranch Dressing mixture out.  It tastes more "real."  The ranch makes it taste really salty.

Made this as a log and took to Thanksgiving buffet dinner.  Everyone commented on how delish it was.  I didn't use the whole pkg of Ranch, just about 1/2 of it and I thought it was fine and not too salty. I plan on taking this to work on Christmas munchy day.

I served this at book club to some of my favorite girlfriends. This recipe is scaled for 16, but the four of us devoured it. It was too tasty for us to let it sit.

I accidentally bought the tomato basil feta cheese and didn't have time to run back to the store.  I dumped it in and left out the ranch dressing mix.  I took it to a family picnic and it was gone in minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I also altered this a bit and used parm cheese and no ranch mix and heated it up. It was really good!

I made this twice.  I took out the ranch and it was good.  I also shaped it into a Christmas Tree and put on a platter and it looked very pretty and festive.  

The second time I made it I added 7 sundried tomatoes to the mix (and whirled everything into a food processer).  It came out even better and it really added a great flavor to it.

This was good but,not as good as I thought it would be. It didnt set up much. No matter how I tried to form it (ball,log...) it was lumpy and didnt look nice.  It needs something.... I WOULD try it again and play around with the recipe a bit.

Really good and easy to make.  I added a little bit of mayonnaise to thin it out to make it more of a dip than a cheeseball; served it in a bowl with an assortment of dipping crackers.  Rave reviews.

Holy cow, this is good!  I made some before dinner last night.  I didn't think my husband would put down the crackers and come to the table.  I agree that it is a little salty...I'll try to find a low-sodium ranch dressing mix, or make my own next time.  Yummo!

This turned out great! I made it for mother's day as an appetizer with crackers and everyone loved it. I only used 1/4 of the ranch packet and I used a drained 14 oz can of marinated artichoke hearts. Next time I make it will use less spinach and add some red pepper flakes to give it a little heat. This is definitely a keeper!

Altered recipes based on suggestions as follows: * Left out Garlic and Ranch * Added Nature's Seasoning  * Added a tablespoon of tomato basil pesto sauce * heated the ingredients slightly so they blended together better * rolled finished ball in almonds almonds for decoration (looked beautiful!), may also roll in dried parsley.  Loved it - the pesto really made it though.

I liked this a lot. I made the mistake of adding extra spinach trying to get more veggies in. It was too much, it made it difficult to cut into, wasn't as visually appealing, and the taste of spinach was a bit much.  That said, I still gave the recipie 5 stars because it was still good and I know when I make it with the proper amount of spinach it will be great. I used half a pouch of ranch and it was perfect.

This dip went over well with friends and family.  I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of mayo to reduce the thickness and cut the saltiness.  Next time I will used only 1/4 or 1/2 of the ranch packet.  The ranch seasoning combined with the feta cheese made this rather salty.  It was still delicious!

Made this today for a pot luck party and it was a huge hit! I did not add the dry ranch mix as per other reviewers, but did add about 2 tablespoons of prepared ranch dressing instead. Turned out wonderfully :) I made it into a snowman, as it was a Christmas party and served it with assorted crackers, carrots and celery.

This was totally awesome. I did as others suggested and used only part of the dressing mix. (about a teaspoon) The garlic was a little overpowering though. I made this 2 days before I needed it. It held up very well wrapped in plastic wrap in the refrigerator. Thought about doing the nuts as others suggested but it really didn't need it. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good! I added finely chopped red bell pepper just because I had some leftover from another recipe. It was great both ways. I will definitely make this again, but I might use a little less Ranch.

I made this over Christmas and also omitted the ranch seasoning. I also rolled it into tiny balls and flattened them out for individual cheese balls. 

I agree with other reviewers about the ranch being too salty - I have had it in other cheeseballs. And like another reviewer has said, the feta is salty enough.

The cheeseball is perfect without the ranch and my family loved it. We will make it again and I may try to add bacon crumbles to see how that would work in this yummy combination.

Easy and festive.  This is nice enough for company on a holiday.  I made mine in the shape of a ball.  I did not use the ranch dressing and rolled it in sliced almonds before I chilled it for a few hours.  Great taste and texture.  Next time however, I will take it out of the fridge for alittle before serving.

Honestly I was expecting to be more "wowed" by this one, the flavor was definitely good but just kind of another spinach artichoke dip, maybe warming it up a bit would make it better and left out the ranch mix, can't see how it could add just take away from the flavor, it has plenty just not what I was expecting, didn't go as quick as expected.

Every year I amasked to bring the cold spinach dip made with vegetable soup mix, but I needed a change. This recipe is AWESOME. To quote my brother it was was "restauraunt quality". I doubled the cream cheese, used the whole container of feta cheese, and halved the ranch mix as others suggested. Served with pita chips, bagel chips, and tortilla chips. If I could give it 10 stars I would!

I found it awfully strong (garlic), and it wasn't touched much by the guests.  It could probably be tweaked to make it milder.

This was excellent. I used fresh garlic, which was really strong and I didn't add atrichoke. Took this to a tail gate party and it was gone in 20 min.

My family requests this for every occasion.  Don't use as much ranch dressing mix as it tells you though - it will be way too salty.

I love spinach and artichoke dip so I had to try this. It was a nice alternative and more healthy than the dip we usually make. It was a hit for Super Bowl Sunday!

I made this for a block party and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I took the suggestions and left out the ranch and heated it up.  I will make it again.

Great, unique flavor! Did not use ranch dressing, just little salt to taste and few spoons of jarred minced garlic. Delish!

great last-minute party dish - however, i would recommend reducing the amount of feta and ranch dressing mix a bit because they can overwhelm the other flavors.

This is one of my favorite cheese balls.  A couple tweaks I do is to use fresh spinach instead of frozen and very little ranch seasoning (less than a tablespoon).  Great with crackers or sliced French bread!!!!!

I had not read reviews before trying, but I did not have ranch dressing mix and  improvised with seasonings 
 Glad I did. Dip was a hit served with fresh sliced marble loaf

I agree with reviewers that said it lacked flavor regardless of what you added. I heated mine up eventually, but it was still mediocre.

Left out the ranch dressing mix as suggested. Also used a mixture of parmesan and cheddar cheese instead of feta only because it's what I had in the fridge. Rolled the entire ball in crushed walnuts. Served it with Ritz crackers. DELICIOUS!

I liked it, though there was way too much salt in this recipe from the combination of the feta (which is a pretty salty cheese) and the ranch dressing mix. Next time I'll leave out the ranch dressing unless I can find some low sodium ranch dressing mix, but I think this would be better without the ranch dressing mix in its entirety.

this is a excellent recipe with one minor change - don't use the entire ranch package! That's it and it is delicious and everyone who eats it will think you're amazing but it was simple to put together. I recommend serving it with a butter cracker for the full, gluttonous effect. Your guest will be in love.

A friend (whose husband is a chef and a little zealous on her opinions of food) and I enjoyed this delicious cheese ball.  As other reviewers, I was a little skeptical on the ranch, so I only added half and still was a little salty.  She must have really enjoyed it, cuz it was all gone.  It is addicting, I think perhaps next time I will warm  it, as another reviewer suggested.  I served it as a ball and also stuffed the cheese in little red and yellow bell peppers with it as well.

I only used 0.4 oz of ranch because I accidentally grabbed the wrong size package. The final product tastes good, so I can't imagine using the entire ounce, I agree it would be too salty. IMPORTANT: I can't believe it's only been mentioned once but the "serves" is way off! If this person is feeding this to 16 people that must be the worst party ever. This only made a cheese ball about 4 inches wide. I'm taking it to serve 7 people and it's not going to be enough and now I have to stop at the store and get something else. DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THIS.

Left out ranch dressing, but otherwise made it as-is.  Between squeezing the spinach, chopping the artichokes, and mixing in the cream cheese, it took longer to make than I had expected.  But tasty!

Turned out okay. Followed suggestions and just skipped the ranch mix...but it seemed way too spinachy. so added extra (Mediterranean) feta and fresh parm...then some hot sauce...and a bit of cheddar cheese.  The artichokes were the jarred, marinated type for extra flavor... I made logs (4 total) rolled 3 in toasted pecan pieces and 1 in crushed French Fried Jalapenos for fun.  I put the artichoke in the chopper to finely mince...do the same for the spinach! It just does not serve pretty with all the stringy green blobs...still was well received!  We can definitely have heat added to this and be happier!

I taste almost everything as I cook it, knowing the ingredients are not always reliable.  I used  goat cheese feta, squeezed the heck out of the spinach and drained the artichoke hearts (as always) on a paper towell.  Mine was perfect but I like a little more garlic (added some garlic powder) and mine was not the least bit  salty so I added two heaping teaspoons  ranch dressing mix (I buy it in the jar.)    Thanks for the recipe.  I made it for tomorrow but having trouble keeping my husband out of it!

READ THE REVIEWS! Most of the reviews that are positive massively change the recipe. This is a review of the recipe as stated.

I followed the recipe exactly and this turned out disgusting. I used it for the inside of a flayed face cheese display for Halloween and it's so salty that it's almost inedible! I spent a lot of money to triple this recipe for my display and now it's just going to sit there because the flavors are way too strong. Super disappointed, the spinach would have made the perfect moldy inside of my zombie face :-(

It was a little expensive to make but it was worth it!!  Rave reviews and compliments from everyone who tried it, over and over!  hahahaha   It actually made a bigger ball than I thought and I did go ahead and roll it in the last few walnuts I had.  I also put just a dash of the Ranch Dry Mix in...   I'll have to make again, so they tell me!  Thank you!

This was a great combination of familiar flavors wrapped up in a different package.  I found I hadn't gotten the spinach and artichokes as dry as I should have so my ball turned into more of a spread as it was too soft to hold good shape.  Next time I'll only use 1/2 the ranch mix as I liked the flavor it added I also found it too salty.

Very tasty, somewhat healthy dip to go with baby carrots.  I substituted 1oz of parmesan cheese for the ranch dressing mix.  And I probably used more artichoke hearts than asked for.  I also didn't squeeze the water out (got home super late from work, forgot this step).  But it still worked out well.  I also wonder what it would be like with plain Greek yogurt instead of the cream cheese for more of a protein punch.
