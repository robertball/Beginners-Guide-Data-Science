Tasty!  However, this is not TRUE North Carolina style BBQ sauce.  I've lived in Sanford, Chocowinity, and Forest City and the BBQ is the same.  There is NO tomato base at all.  That is what makes NC BBQ unique and special.

Great recipe! It simple with few ingredients, and tastes great! Perfect on the vinegar, that's what it's all about!

I am from Eastern North Carolina and this is what it is all about, except we use apple cider vinegar, It is mostly used when grilling pork or chicken, you use it as a basting sauce through out the cooking process, we mostly use it for cooking our pigs for chopped BBQ. It can be a little strong if use on meat after it is done, but used correctly it is the best way to cook pork and eat pork, The vinegar is what makes it so famous for being Eastern North Carolina style BBQ. Try it!!! next time you grill ribs or chicken.

Almost there, but it needs Apple Cidar Vinegar and you mop it on the food as it's cooking. The distilled white vinegar makes it way too srong.

yeah!this is the good stuff. as for whether NC has a tomatoe based sauce or not- it depends on who is cooking and whether there is enough ketchup. as a NC native, have eaten it with and without the tomatoe base and either way is great.

I don't know anything about Carolina BBQ, so I can't whether or not this is TRUE Carolina BBQ.  What I can tell you, however, is that I thought there was, indeed, WAY TOO MUCH VINEGAR.  I had to do a lot of 'doctoring up' to make the sauce palatable for the rest of my family (ketchup, tomato sauce, onion flakes, more sugar).

Oh my goodness, I think the only way a person could enjoy this sauce is if you enjoy drinking vinegar from the jug.  Holy cats!!!  I tried it and it's not for our taste.  I think it would also be a nice way to ruin a good piece of pork.  Thanks anyway.

This was just ok, I am usually pretty happy with any bbq sauce. Not such a big fan of this one though, Sorry:( I even took the advise and used cider vinegar instead and doubled the sugar. Maybe it will taste better tomorrow. Thank you Janie. :)
