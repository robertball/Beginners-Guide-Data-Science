Turned out very good, although I made changes.  Used mushrooms, red & green bell peppers and chopped onion, and didn't have turmeric so I used mustard powder (figured it might add a bit of yellow to make it look more like eggs), onion and garlic powders and a pinch of curry powder.  Topped with fresh herbs and wrapped in a tortilla.  Next time I think I will season and start cooking the tofu first, then add veggies because it took about 10 minutes to cook off the liquid and by then the peppers were cooked too much for my taste.  So next time I'll saute the tofu for 5 minutes or so before adding the veggies.

This recipe is very similar to mine. There are many variations to scrambled tofu. Make sure you use firm or extra firm water packed tofu and not silken. Also, only use spoonful of chopped tomatoes or salsa. This dish tastes great with toast and salsa.

I made some modifications to this recipe. First, I didn't put any cheese.  I sauteed the tofu with diced green pepper and sliced mushrooms, and added the tomato in last.  I also crumbled the tofu into the pan instead of "mashing" it, so it looked like scrambled eggs.  It was a tad soupy.  The vegans loved it, and I thought it was pretty good too.

I didn't have any green onions so I just subbed other dried spices (basil, oregano, thyme, and red pepper flakes) and it turned out quite yummy.  Definitely squeeze out the water from the tofu before you cook it (I found using non-silken tofu worked better).  The cheese added nice flavor at the end.  This is good, and makes a quick and easy snack or meal.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good. I used half the tomatoe juice, but it was still very liquidy. Next time i will drain the tomatoes completely.

I added cumin, coriander, curry, and cayenne to this, which spiced it up nicely. I also drained the tomatos and next time I too, would use firm rather than silken tofu because it was a bit soupy. But this is a good easy recipe!

I give this 4 stars in concept. I took some mods from other posters and the finished product was absolutely FANTASTIC! 

I've been cooking with tofu for a few years. My son is a football player and Tofu is an excellent source of protein. The trick with cooking with Tofu is to make sure you press it. Take a kitchen towel and fold it around the tofu. I used firm tofu for this recipe. Press as much of the water out by using you hands. Change towel and press again then put a heavy pot on top of it for about 5 minutes.  Lay the pressed tofu on paper towels to "air dry" for about 15 minutes. Then it's ready to use.

I used 1/2 of a large red bell pepper, 1/2 scallion, 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 c. Shitake Mushrooms, 1/2 c. of Baby Bellas a can of Original Style Rotell (drained), and used spiced Himalayan Salt, Hot Madras Curry Powder and the Turmeric. I chopped all veggies into little diced pieces and sauteed them in garlic and olive oil for about 3 minutes and then added the crumbled tofu. Once the tofu was cooked well, I added the drained rotell and spices. Cooked until heated through....

This was a BIG hit and will become a staple brunch/snack in our home. I will have to double, or maybe triple the recipe next time because everyone wanted seconds, but there was only enough for three servings.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was great!  I didn't have green onions, but used green peppers, a little spinach, and portobello mushrooms.  I also didn't add tomatoes because I was afraid it would be too soupy.  Also, next time I will cook the tofu and the sauteed veggies in a separate pan.  Once you add the tofu (and the water that inevitably comes with it), the crispy green peppers got really soft.  Overall, I really liked this recipe and will experiment with it again!

I thought this was great.  I'm not strictly vegetarian but do try to add soy into my diet and tend to have bits of leftover from soups and such.  I had a half a box leftover and so added soy sausage, mushrooms, onion and 1/2 cup of leftover canned tomatoes (which I rinsed and drained otherwise I believe it would have been too much liquid)  I then added 3 scrambled eggs at the end and topped with the cheese.  My three kids liked it also and had seconds for breakfast.

OMG!!  This was so much better that I anticipated. I made a few modifications. I mashed up a pack of firm organic tofu. Chopped up a med yellow onion. One small green bell pepper. One medium organic russet potato and turmeric to taste and a little sea salt.  I made this for my 16 year old daughter who is very vegan and does not like tofu. She had no idea there was tofu in this dish. The only thing she asked was, " Is this fake egg?" I replied with a yes!  She loved it and never knew the difference nor will I ever tell her. It is so hard to get enough protein in her with her extremely picky diet. But, this dish is a definite keeper.  :-)

Really enjoyed making this - we added mushrooms and green peppers. The tofu seemed to added a nice velvety texture not the same as eggs but somewhat similar. Delicious!

I added mushrooms to saute with the green onions. I added water the first time I cooked it and it was soupy as mentioned by someone else. I used fresh tomatoes both times and did not add any water the second time I used this recipe and it turned out perfect.

Didn't care for the turmeric taste, or how liquidy it was. Worth experimenting with though.

Quite delicious and easy!  I opted to drain the tomatoes, and I'm glad I did because the tofu still had some liquid, or I would have had breakfast soup instead of a scramble.

I am vegan, so do not use any dairy. You can really put anything in this; however, I use firm tofu & put through a ricer.  I saute with fresh onions, peppers and garlic, then add turmeric and Braggs amino acid (or soy sauce). For breakfast, I add hash browns on the side -- very filling and delicious!

I picked this recipe because I liked the idea of the tomatoes mixing with the tofu, but I found it to be too much-maybe half a can would have been better...but then what to do with the other half? :P I omitted the cheese-not in the diet. I added chopped garlic and a few mushrooms, along with some cayenne and cumin. I also crumbled some firm tofu (not silken). But I still thought it tasted like tofu-not sure how people can mistake it for eggs :P It was a nice change, but I'm not sure it satisfied.

I made this as I'm avoising eggs since i may have an intolerance to them. I think the sucess od this recipe depends on the brand of tofu you use, as their are significant taste/texture differences between them. I used "unisoya" and did not like this at all despite adding more veggies, cheese, a little soy milk and mustard powder instead of turmeric since I didn't have any. I also did a dash of salt, pepper and a little Italian seasoning. Didn't turn out this time, but may try again with a different brand.

This wasn't my favorite tofu scramble recipe but on average still better than most I've tried.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, nutritional yeast, and a bit of soy sauce.  I'd recommend letting this cook 10-20 minutes to reduce the liquid from the tomatoes.

This one is in regular rotation at our house -- delicious, nutritious, cheap, and easy to make.  As others have pointed out, you need to buy extra firm tofu and freeze it then thaw it.  This will allow it to hold together as you squeeze the liquid out of it.  Only then should you crumble it.  I rarely have green onions around, and usually use one med yellow cooking onion instead. I use diced tom's that includes roasted garlic and onion.  I've never tried it with cheddar; we use jack cheese instead.  For a main dish, serves two.

Great for a summertime lunch! Modifications: I used ready-made salsa to substitute for the tomatoes and onions, and added minced garlic & cayenne. I omitted the cheese though. This would make a good pita wrap filling! :)

I didn't like this. I thought the tomatoes were sour next to the tofu. It has a pretty strange taste and I didn't think the turmeric helped.

My family LOVES this, I made a few changes.  
  I put swiss cheese on top and put it into pita pockets... wonderful meal.. You won't have to drain the tomatoes if you wrap the tofu up in a cheese cloth and let the water drain totally out of it.

Excellent!  I made substitutions to use what was on hand:  white onion ,sun dried tomatoes and v-8, and added red pepper and spinach -- it was awesome!  Served it with sliced avocado on the side and hearty bread toasted.  A wonderful breakfast!

This is a vegan staple! I am new to veganism so I make this all the time.  However was using to much oil.  Reducing the oil made all the difference.  I am lazy so I used canned tomatoes with chili's (spicy, yumm).  I added garlic powder and ate this with a banana and small bagal.

I made this today and it was great!  I used dry mustard instead of tumeric, as one reader suggested and also added a little creole seasoning for some heat. I omitted the tomatoes and cheese because I'm not wild about either in my eggs.  I thoroughly enjoyed the dish and liked much better than egg beaters.

I rated this recipe a 3 only because I made several modifications and used the recommendations from the other reviewers. My husband and I are not vegetarians, but currently doing P90X and were looking for a creative way to use tofu.  I subbed roasted red peppers for the tomoatoes.  To try and get rid of some of the water in the tofu, I crumbled the tofu and placed it in a strainer.  While that sat, I sauted shallots, garlic and green onions until tender.  I added 2 cups of spinach and cooked for about a minute.  I then set those ingredients aside and added about 1/2 cup of egg beaters.  Once the eggs were set I added in the tofu and cooked for a couple of minutes to cook out any remaining water.  Next I added the spinach mixture and roasted red peppers.  To flavor I added in tumeric, salt, and pepper.  I didn't have cheddar cheese so grated in about 1 oz of pepper jack cheese at the end.  All in all it was very tastey and high in protein!

Excellent- especially for my daughter who is allergic to eggs. A great alternative to the $3 box of tofu scramblers- I found if you cook then place in warm oven the consistency becomes more like scrambled eggs. Sprinkle chees at last minute. Tum!

To make this totally vegan for my son and his friends I used extra firm tofu and drained the water out. Also added about half a tsp turmeric (did it by color) and then cumin, onion powder, salt and pepper to taste. Fried in vegan margarine for flavor (Nucoa works well). Cooked it for about five minutes to dry it up a bit and then crumbled some soy cheddar cheese into it. Served with avocado and tomato on the side. They totally were impressed by it and have always asked for it since when they are over for breakfast.

Easy, delicious and good for the planet. I have used tofu since my college days when I read about Island Springs Tofu, a manufacturer located on Vashon Island. Back then, I often made tofu lasagna for special dinners. Always keep tofu in the fridge for a quick high protein meal. A recipe like this is very versatile.  One could even add eggs to disguise the tofu for those who have repulsion to it. .

ingestable  but my husband and I didn't like it. runny, wondering if maybe adding in a bit of chickpea flour might help?  I knew it wouldn't taste like eggs so my expections were not too high. Our son actually liked it so I'm sure some will and some won't. I was a big egg lover before I went plant based so my eggs expectations are probably too high.

I made this for my guests with firm tofu which I dried well. I also dried with kitchen towel the canned tomatos and added cayenne pepper to it as well as yellow pepper.  My guests loved it and it came an instant hit.  Colorful, toasty and healthy morning treat!

I'm not eating dairy right now, so I needed something to use up some veggies that wasn't with eggs!  This fit perfectly and is a very versatile recipe.  I did use firm tofu, and I think that's what the submitter was trying to say. It says "firm silken".  Anyway, use firm or extra firm.  Be sure to drain it really well, and I preferred mine crumbled rather than mashed.  I used the veggies I had on hand - spinach, asparagus, red pepper, and sweet potato.  I did not have tumeric so I used garlic power, onion powder, and cayenne pepper, in addition to the salt and pepper.  I also used 2 tbsp salsa instead of the diced tomatoes.  Seriously, this is great!

Good basic recipe. This is easily customized to individual tastes and to whatever ingredients one has on hand. I used one fresh tomato, added about half of a bell pepper, about a tablespoon of red onion (in addition to about half a bunch of green onion) and a clove of garlic to my scramble. I served it with corn tortillas and had shredded cheddar on the side for whoever wanted it. Good stuff. Will definitely keep it in my recipe box.

Very good! I poured too much oil into my pan with the tofu, so it was a bit oily.  I made some changes since I didn't have the exact ingredients and it came out nicely, but it's missing something...  I pressed the tofu for about 10 minutes before I started cooking (I should have waited longer, but I was pretty hungry) then "scrambled" the tofu in the oil and added salt, pepper and random herbs and spices I had on hand (I think they were minced garlic, basil, cilantro, cinnamon, and a cajun salt mix). In another pan I heated a can of Rotel (mild tomatoes and green onions) until the juice was boiling and poured the entire thing into the pan with the tofu. after that cooked a bit I scooped out a lot of liquid with a spoon.  To finish I mixed in a handful of shredded cheese and then topped with extra cheese.

I made 1/3 of the recipe with fresh tomatoes, no turmeric or cheese and added a clove of garlic and a pinch of sugar.  I was looking for a Chinese egg-and-tomato replacement, but this didn't do it justice.  Okay dish by itself, though.

Not as good as I expected but still good enough to try again. If you don't like tofu you may not fancy this. I added about 1/2 tsp turmeric which may have been a bit much.

It didn't remind me of scrambled eggs but it was really good, it kind of reminded me of lasagna filling.
