A very good sauce.  I added about 1/4 cup of mayo to the recipe because I found the consistency to be rather gritty.  I wanted a creamier sauce and the addition of the mayo was just what I needed.  I received raves from my guests that ate this sauce along with roast beef... a perfect compliment!  I also made this with an addition of a teaspoon or so of tabasco - a wonderful zing!  Try it!

A very good sauce.  If I were using this for roast beef, I would probably leave it the way it is, but tonight I need something to top off grilled burgers so as another reviewer suggested I bumped up the horseradish and added some mayo. That did the trick!

great sauce, make it as hot as you want by adding more horseradish. Tasted great on LTH's meatballs and as a dip for green peppers

We really liked this recipe.  I didn't have dried onion so I minced about a tablespoon of fresh onion and it turned out great!

This was just what I was looking for to dip "Deep Fried Dill Pickles," recipe also from this site. It's a little light on the horseradish for our tastes, so I added more, ending up with nearly double the amount called for.  I liked the addition of the lemon juice just to brighten the mellowness of the sour cream, but I didn't bother with the tiny bit of dried minced onion called for.  Mmmmm, fried dill pickles with horseradish dipping sauce - not as a good as our favorite restaurant in Memphis but this was a fine substitute until we get back.

Really great - though I usually use the Hot Horseradish, and bump it up to nearly a half a cup.

Great sauce! I cut the sour cream in half but kept all the other amounts the same. I did add some mayo as others suggested to help the consistency. Thank you!!

It is what it is.  I don't recommend using this for an entree but for an appetizer instead.  Fried green tomatoes or possibly sweet potato fries as another reviewer mentioned.  I tried a dab on a bite of steak and it killed the flavor of the steak, definitely took a wrong turn there, lol.  This is perfect if you want to mask something.

Pretty tasty... served with chicken fingers and the sauce provided a cool, creamy contrast to the crunchy chicken fingers. However, I felt like something was missing. Can't put my finger on it. Maybe more garlic salt.

I made this to go with cod and it was so tasty!  I love horseradish and felt a mere quarter cup was getting "lost in the sauce" so I increased it quite a bit. Just kept adding it in little by little. End result was just fantastic. Thank you!

I made this to dip sweet potato fries in. I also added mayo like others suggested, however next time I make this I will only use one cup of sour cream and add a little more horseradish. My hubby said all he could taste was sourcream.

Pretty good. It's a little runny. I think you can safely double the horseradish and cut down on the sour cream. I had it with Prime Rib and wished it was more substantial.

I was disappointed w/ this recipe.  I guess I was hoping for more of a horseradish sauce that is usually served w/ prime rib and this wasn't it.

I hate to give this a bad review, but we did not like this very much.  I served it with the Herbed Beef Tenderloin from this site.  I made it the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The recipe also made a ton even for our Christmas dinner for 8.

Exactly what I was looking for. This tasted similiar (a little heavier) to the sauce we serve at the steakhouse I work at. This was nice with my prime rib but you have to be a sour cream lover and add extra horseradish. Thanks for sharing.

This was really good and very easy to make! Went perfectly with prime rib, my sister in law used as a salad dressing AND with the leftover prime rib I made a beef stew and put a couple of tbsp. scoops in my bowl and it was awesome!

I started out with 1 cup of sour cream, intending to add the second cup little by little to taste.  I didn't add ANY of the second cup and also ended up adding more of everything else.  I served this with the Parmesan Spinach Balls from this site and it was a hit (a couple of people even had a spoonful of the dip on its own!)

I decreased the servings to 4 and made the following changes: doubled the horseradish (2TBLS) although I used extra hot, I still think it could use more horseradish especially if you are serving this with prime rib or roast beef.  I omitted the salt, and used 1/8 tsp. of garlic salt, paprika, and onion powder.  I let the dip sit overnight but I don't think it's necessary.  I served this with oven baked zucchini sticks from the recipezaar website.

Great, I used it for chicken bites I served as an appetizer.  I might add just a little more horseradish next time.
