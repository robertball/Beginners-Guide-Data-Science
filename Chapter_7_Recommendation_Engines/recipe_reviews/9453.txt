I absolutely love these. They were so simple to make. I didn't have any raisins though so I doubled up on the nuts ( which by the way I used Honey Roasted Peanuts). That's all I had handy... but ya know they came out great. They tasted awesome!!!! I would defnitely make these again and again!!!! A+ to the person that submitted this recipe :[]

These turned out really well, and couldn't be any easier to make.  The chocolate didn't pool on the bottom, which happens to me a lot with this type of candy.  They look very professional and pretty.  And taste great!  The only problem is that they melt awfully fast in your hand.  I'm sure a more experienced candy maker would know how to resolve that.

This was SO easy to make! I needed something fast and easy for a potluck party. I followed the directions exactly except I only had walnuts. So with walnuts, raisins, it was GREAT. I used the Barefoot Contessa's trick and added 1 teaspoon of instant coffee to brighten the chocolate flavor...this was amazing. I almost didn't want to share! Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

These are great and very simple.  My husband was wary of them, but I was curious, so I went ahead and tried it.  He loves them!  I had to use honey roasted peanuts since that is all I had, and they actually worked.  I did not chop the peanuts, and some parts of the treat are hard to bite into, so if you have the time or are making them for a party, I would go ahead and break them down just a little for ease. But for us, it was fine.

This recipe is wonderful, easy, and fast to make. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and they were delicious. The name, however, could use some work. My brother and I decided that we didn't want to tell people that they were called "cow pies" thus draw up such an image in their heads. Instead, we called them "Bonzai". Much more appetizing.

So delicious and so simple! Go ahead and use any old nut you want! They are scrumptious and I personally love them with walnuts, but hubby likes them with cashews. That's the beauty of this recipe - it works deliciously with a variety of nuts and if you don't like raisins (I love them!), then go ahead and leave them out. Prefer your chocolate a bit more rich and deep? Use semi sweet chocolate chips. :-) I've even been known to  throw in coconut, mint chips, peanut butter chips, etc. (Just not all at the same time!)  ;)

These were easy (especially since I microwaved my chocolate to melt it instead of breaking out the steamy double-boiler) and tasty. I used pretzels and cheerios in place of the almonds. Next time would probably add more raisins, but overall yummy enough to make again!

Pretty delicious. I'm not sure if the shortening is that much needed other than making it shiny-er though. I do agree with the fact that it melts a little too quickly (probably due to the shortening). Make sure you use good quality chocolate!

This is so yummy.  Perfect for that chocolate craving they have a nice crunch and chew and sweet/tangy.
I used dark chocolate instead of milk, dried cranberries instead of raisins and the butter flavored shortening (they were all what I had on hand).  They turned out wonderfully, the butter shortening actually added a nice subtle depth of flavor.
Anyway, these totally took care of my chocolate craving!!

Yummy!  I am 8 months pregnant and was craving something with chocolate and raisins...this was perfect.  I didn't drop them into individual candies, but spread the mixture into a round cake pan.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are so yummy! I've made them for a party and I made them today for my friend's graduation reception. I substituted dried cranberries for raisins and threw in about a half cup of marshmallows. The first time I used milk chocolate, but the second time we didn't have any so I used semisweet chocolate chips and it tastes just as good. Thanks for this recipe. :)

These were delicious but melted VERY quickly. I used peanuts instead of almonds and everyone liked them. Small is good.

I love these!  They are very easy to make and remind of Chunky candy bars that I ate as a child.
