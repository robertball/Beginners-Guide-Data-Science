I never take the time to review the recipes, but I thought everyone should know that this is the best marinade I have found! The steaks come out perfect everytime...no matter what cut it is.

THIS MARINADE IS A MUST FOR ALL STEAK LOVERS!!
I used this marinade on 1 inch thick sirlions and let it 'get happy' for 24 hours. The ONLY thing I added was as suggested by other reviews was about 2 or 3 T of A1 sauce to cut down on the soy sauce taste. When i put it on the grill, I did put more black pepper on top and added a little bit of grated parmesan cheese too. And basted the steak with left over marinade while cooking.
My boyfriend said "is there anymore" and i made sure there was no leftover juices on my plate when my steak was gone. This was BY FAR the best steak i have ever made and i've made some good steaks in the past. Thank you for sharing the recipe. I have emailed it to LOTS of people and printed a copy for all meat-eaters here at the office. 
I am never using any other steak marinade.

Excellent and easy. Had to use white vinegar, tried also balsamic vinegar - both good until I got red wine vinegar. Makes a LOT of marinade, so you may want to adjust down.

This was a very good marinade.  I made a half recipe and combined the ingredients in a gallon zip lock bag.  I then added about five pounds of sirloin and allowed it to marinate about eight hours, turning regularly and "massaging" the marinade into the meat.  Also, I scored the surface of the meat slightly with a very sharp knife, in a "diamond" pattern to aid in the absorption of the flavor.  The steaks were about 1" thick.  I cooked half of the meat then, it was delicious.  The other half I allowed to marinate over night and that was even better.  The steaks were very tender and flavorful.  I, out of habit, added some pepper sauce before tasting the meat, but everyone else enjoyed it without additional condiments, except a little salt.  We will make this again, possibly even this weekend.  We cooked the steaks on a cast iron grill pan over medium high heat for about 7 - 8 minutes per side.  Husbot just finished some leftover steak and remarked yet again how delicious it was.

This recipe is awesome.  I first used this to make steak fajitas.  Turned out so well that I have used over and over again on all different meats.  Used on Rib Eye for a party with over 20 guests.  Was told by many that this was the best steak they have ever had.  I usually add a touch of honey to help caramalize the outside of the meat when cooking.  Can use on steak, chicken, and grilled salmon.

Really good.  I substituted cider vinegar for the red wine and added a little brown sugar.  Perfectly tender and flavored.

Fantastic marinade!  Cut the recipe in half and had more than enough to marinate 3 filet mignons and 1 strip steak.  Allowed to marinate for 8 hours in the fridge then grilled the steaks.  So tender and flavorful, didn't even need a knife to cut the steaks.  Served with the Roasted Vegetables recipe on this site.  Along with a glass of red wine this is the perfect dinner.  Boyfriend loved both, told me I'm a better cook than his mom :)

This steak as good.  Had a nice flavor, although it was a little too salty for my taste. I used light soy also.  The steaks were tender and juicy and didn't require any additional steak sauce.  Because of the salt content I probably will not make again though.

I have been using this marinade recipe for over 3 years and it's the only one I use. I have tinkered with it and in my opinion improved it by using olive oil in place of vegetable oil and a double dose of minced garlic instead of garlic cloves.

OMG!!  This was awesome!!!  You MUST take the onions- make a foil packet - add some of the marinade- and sautee on the grill!!!  Next time- I will triple the amount of onions for that reason.  This was a great marinade for steak.

DELICIOUS!!! I was having company over for dinner and one of my guest also likes to cook. Each time I have had him over, he always likes to talk about how HE prepares his ________ (fill in the blank with whatever I made for dinner that night). To hear him talk you would think he is the only person who can cook well. Needless to say, I was looking for a recipe to put him in his place...and this was it. I used this marinade on NY steaks and let them soak a day and a half for good measure. I watched his face after he took his first bite and I could tell my mission was accomplished. He did not come out and say he liked it, but kept trying to guess what was in the marinade. I was vague until he finally asked for the recipe at the end of the evening. The score is: MORO 1 GUEST 0! Ha ha Thanks Kat!

FANTASTIC!!!!!!  We had two huge Porterhouse steaks - I marinated them for THREE days!  The only thing I did different - was I used shallots instead of a white onion.  Here's my TWIST:  While the steaks were broiling, I took all the leftover marinade - took a little time skimming as much oil off the top as I could -  and brought it to a rolling boil in a saucepan.  I then added one package of Peppered Boursin (5.2 oz) and about 1/2 cup milk and reduced a little.  This made a fantastic and rich dipping sauce for the steak (these steaks were just too beautiful for regular steak sauce!!!!)  Now - I have leftovers of this sauce and I plan to sautee some mushrooms with the leftover sliced steak - and add that to some fresh cooked green beans and toss with this rich sauce!!!  Nothing goes to waste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If the sauce if too rich for you for this mix - you could add a can of mushroom soup and some milk - you get the drift.....Thanks Steveskat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was wonderful; we licked the plates lol Well Almost... Made a few changes though.  Used Spicy Brown Mustart instead of Dijon, 2 TBS white vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, 1/3 cup Worcestershire , and 1/4 cup A1. Also added Steak Seasoning instead of Black Pepper.  I know it was different from the original but it was excellent.

Fabulous! We marinated a couple steaks, cut them into pieces and grilled on kabobs with tomatoes, zucchini, onion, red pepper, and shrooms. (We marinated on kabobs for 20 minutes or so before grilling. It was to die for! Thanks for the fabulous (easy ) marinade! We'll make this again for sure.

After all the rave reviews of this recipe, I was a little dissapointed. Overall, I consider it a good recipe....quick, easy and our ribeyes were very tender. But the marinade was way too strong...it overpowered the meat. I only marinated my steaks for 3 1/2 hrs...I can only imagine what would happen overnight. I do think that it deserves a second chance though, and will try again maybe with a little less of everything, especially the soy sauce.

Really good. Will probably cut the vinegar a little bit next time though. It was really nice to be able to use all these ingredients I already had on-hand instead of having to buy a one-time-use marinade.

Very Tasty... I made it to serve 10 and had plenty to marinade 2 large steaks in a 1 gal. zipper bag. 6 hours is all I did and I think a little more time is needed.  24 hours may be to much time... I will make this ahead of time and then add it to the meat and onions first thing in the morning...

I used 1/2 c. olive oil vs. 1 c. veg. oil and used low sodium soy sauce along with green onion.  I marinated two NY strips for about 8 hours and they came out nice, but I think the amount of black pepper (1 Tablespoon) might be a bit too much.

This really is the BEST steak marinade I have ever tasted. I have never been able to find a delicious mariade for steak and FINALLY I have found it. I never liked steak before this b/c it never had a flavor that I liked. I used Rib Eye's. The only changes I made was to substitute Balsamic Vinegar instead of Red Wine Vinegar (b/c I didn't have any), Lite Soy Sauce, 4 garlic cloves and I added 1 Tbsp. of A1 sauce as suggested by another viewer. I poked holes in the steak with a knife so marinade would get into the steaks. I marinated it for 8 hours (turning every hr or so) and grilled on gas cooktop stove using a cast iron griddle. Family said it was the best & most tender steak they have ever had and I totally agree. Definitely will be making this one a lot!!! Thanks a bunch!

This was a good marinade. I did not have red wine vinegar so subbed apple cider.  Everything else was by the recipe. BUT, I added about a Tblsp of honey. I just like what it does when grilling. I add it to most marinades.  Really good.

i added more garlic and some green tobassco sauce. i marinaded chicken breasts for @ 24 hours, bone-in. it was a strange combo, and i was worried about the fresh lemon juice being in it so long...no problem. the marinade was weird to taste after just making it, but the results were out-standing. a great marinade on chicken! try it!

The steaks had a wierd taste and when cooking it the oil sizzled all over and made a mess - I made it on my GF grill. I had to constantly check it because it was more like frying then grilling.We did not care for this marinade at all. I will not be making this again.

This was delicious - but I should have read the fact that it serves 20!  I would definitely do again - but would definitely cut it down to fit my family of 3.

I used this recipe with Ribeye steaks (which are good without a marinade) that I cooked for a family gathering and everybody loved them. The steaks melted in your mouth and there was no need for steak sauce with this marinade. My 4 year old is very picky when it comes to meat and she had 3 helpings. I will be using this recipe again and highly recommend it.

I wouldn't recommend this for an expensive cut of steak but it worked like a charm on my cheaper cut. I was more impressed by its tenderizing power (I let them marinate for 24 hours) over the flavor but the flavor wasn't bad either. We like our steaks more on the well done side and this kept them tender.

Oh My! This is by far the best marinade on the planet! I made it once and froze half to use again. Well I used the rest tonight on some sirloin steak tips and it was FABULOUS! I was moaning after each bite. Wouldn't change a thing...I will never use another marinade.

Excellent marinade! I have a case of NY strip steaks that weren't very good - had even done just plain italian dressing marinade and didn't help.  This marinade made them FANTASTIC - I will never use just italian dressing again!

I made this as part of a buffet for a party of 45 people and it was EXCELLENT!  Many compliments!  I doubled the recipe for 12 pounds of tri-tip steak but used 1/2 the amount of oil (olive oil). Substituted shallots for onion, added 2 teas. dry thyme and oregano each, and marinated for 12 hours.  Cooked meat on gas grill.  It came out juicy, tender and flavorful.  Heated the marinade and drizzled over meat, but it wasn't necessary.  Would definitely make again.

I am not a steak eater normally, but if I could eat steak daily if it were marinated with this!  A few small modifications I made were to use canola instead of vegetable oil, and cut back to half a cup.  I also used light soy sauce and added a little more red wine vinegar.  I didn't find it to be to salty at all this way.  My husband raves that steaks marinaded in this are the most tender he's ever had.  I usually marinade overnight to get the best flavor.

Used the last of my lemons on my new lemon tree.  Did not use the garlic and it still was a delicious steak.

this has become my go to marinade.  the only change I make is to omit the onions.  Have used it with different cuts of meat.  Usually marinate in my vacu vin marinader for an hour.  Did once martinate overnight, and it was even better.  Very tender.

Worked pretty good, but I dont recommend leaving too long to marinate, like overnight is just too long.,   We use thgis all the time though.

Absolutely the best marinade ever.  We added a few tablespoons on HP sauce, a can of beer (Dark Stout) and used balsamic vinger instead of red wine vinager.  We only marinaded a few hours and was terrific...can wait to marinade it overnight.  We also did not find it to salty at all.  Great recipe...I will not use any other again.

This was very good and will make again soon. I followed the recipe but used fresh garlis infused olive oil instead of vegetable. I also included a few lamb chops in the marinade with the steak and both were great!!

Substituted 1/2 cup Soy Sauce with 1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Sauce.

Also added 1/2 cup of A1.

Marinaded overnight (about 20 hours) on some porterhouses. well... I'm not much of a steak lover but it was amazing. Great flavor and definitely added tenderness to the meat. The girlfriend is an avid steak lover and said it was by far the best tasting steak she had ever eaten.

2 thumbs up.

Marinated flank steak.  Loved by EVERYONE which is a huge accomplishment.  Just enough tang and mild enough to still taste the beef.  This one is a keeper.

This marinade gave our steak a wonderful flavor!! Since it was raining cats and dogs today I put the steak along with the marinade in the crock pot and the end result was better then I could ever have imagined! The steak not only had wonderful flavor but I didn't need a knife! It fell apart and was so juicy!

Holy Yumm-o!  I didn't have any dijon mustard on hand, so I used a southwest style spread (think Subway) instead.  It made my cheapie steaks amazingly tender and gave it such flavor too.  This is a keeper.

Best marinade ever!!! Didn't change a thing.  Let the steak sit in the marinade all day, then boiled it after the steak was on the bbq.  When I sliced the steak, I poured the marinade over.  We devoured it.

Excellent marinade.  I used it overnight for a flat iron steak (which can be a fairly touch piece of meat) and it was SO tender.  Flavor was delicious-- tangy and succulent.

I think I just found my new favorite marinade!  I marinated flank steak for about 2 hours and it still turned out flavorful and tender.  I used it to make steak sandwiches and it was perfect.  What a great blend of flavors with everyday household ingredients. Thanks for the delicious recipe that is a definite keeper.

My family loved this!  Even the fussy ones.  And my hubby said he could eat steak cooked this way every time.  Thanks for sharing!  :)  I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I substituted a blackberry basalmic vinegar that I had; it turned out beautifully.  P.S.  As suggested, I also added 3 Tblsp. Worcestershire sauce.  Perfect!

The first few times I tried this the wine vinegar kept coming in too strong... but once I put it to a tablespoon, it turned out to be my now standard marinade.

I marinade for 24 hrs. I use steak that I drive 2 hrs round trip for. My kids fight over this steak and when I don't have time to marinade---they are disappointed.

I used this marinade on big thick steaks. Marinated them for about 8 hours. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because it's all I had. I omitted the lemon juice as I didn' have any. I barbecued the steaks and they were fabulous, very tender and great flavor. Will definately use again.

This was the first time I ever cooked steak myself. It turned out wonderfully. I loved it. With the vinegar I used a little less the 1/4 cup. Also, I don't have the luxury of a grill being that I am on the 3rd floor of a condo so I purchased a standard griddle pan and that worked out great. As for meat, I used 2 T-bone steaks. I will be using this recipe again!!! Thank you

I had several steaks I bought on mark down due to close dated sell date. I brought them home and froze them. Came time for a cook out I wasn't sure how good they'd be. Tried this recipe. Followed other reviewers suggestions by adding some A-1 sauce. I also added zesty Italian dressing as a matter of personal preference. Marinated the steaks for 24 hours. They were a huge hit! All of them turned out tender and juicy and full of flavor! This marinade isn't good for any cuts of meats, it's GREAT for all cuts of meat! I will definitely be using this recipe again! My better half was still commenting the next day on how well the steaks were with this marinade! Thank you so very much for sharing such a great recipe!

It's a good marinade, tasty, and helps tenderize.  I used it to marinate two thick round steaks and they turned out pretty good, actually really good for round steaks.  I'd use it again.

I use this Recipe all the time now, very good for Tri-Tip.
One thing I do is mix the Ingredients in the blender so the onion has a better  chance of giving it's flavor up.

so freaking good I could drink it straight. I also threw the ingredients in the food processor  and then simmered the sauce down, thickening it with some water blended with flour. I then used it as a steak sauce. my mouth is watering just posting this! I also put it on veggies, rice and pasta.

i added a tablespoon or so of brown sugar to help it carmelize.  everyone loves this!!! i poured it into a ziploc bag over skirt steak and sliced vidalia onion and marinated overnight.  i have also taken the whole bag with onion, steak and marinade, sealed without any air and frozen. as it defrosts it marinades. throw the onions in a foil pouch on the grill and after 30-40 minutes add the steak and you have a quick meal!

Awesome!  I am very picky when it comes to marinades and we loved this one. I used it for sirloin shish kabobs.  The only thing I did different was that I used about a tbs. of dried onion instead of slicing an onion. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!

Great - I tried this on some sirloin steaks on July 4th.  I marinated for most of the day and then grilled them; they were juicy, tender and delicious; and I like my steaks well-done, as the rest of the family eats their medium to medium rare.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

Used it on our steaks for our bbq this weekend. Everyone said it was great. No one flavor overpowers another, and we didn't need salt or steak sauce. I will definitely use this again.

thanks for a great marinade! I only had time to let the steaks sit about 2 hours but the flavor was all throughout the meat. Even though the steak was a lower quality cut, it tasted wonderful!

I loved this marinade. I only did one little thing different. I added 1 teaspoon of mesquite liquid smoke to it. And it added just the right touch my husband was looking for. Will add to my recipe box and use again and again.

This was o.k.  Used it for marinating small slices of steak for cooking on hot stone.  Everyone preferred my maui rib/steak marinade over this one. Something was missing, not sure what.  I will have to try this one again.

Great marinade!  Very simple...I usually have all these ingredients on hand.  I follow the recipe with the exception of adding lots of extra garlic (love garlic!)  It makes steak very juicy and tender and doesn't alter the flavor, only enhances it.  You definitely won't need a steak sauce!  Be sure to marinade at least 3-4 hours so the flavors really have time to mix and infuse the meat with lots of moisture.

Like a previous reviewer, I thought this marinade was a bit sour. I cut out the vinegar (only using lemon juice) and added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to use the marinade on chicken wings. The flavour was still great, though, and I'm definitely using this recipe again.

This marinade is great!  I did leave out the red wine vinegar because I wasn't sure how I would like it and the steaks were expensive, so I didn't want to risk it.  I marinated the steaks for about 3.5 hours and they were really good!  So flavorful and tender.  Great recipe!

I used 1/2 canola and 1/2 olive oil, and dry instead of dijon mustard, but I followed all the measurements exactly. We used New York strip steaks. Neither my husband or I particularly liked the taste of the marinade - I felt it was kind of sour. Maybe cut back on the vinegar or lemon? Our guests seemed to enjoy it, though (or else they're just polite)

This is the best marinade I have ever had! I was looking for a good marinade recipe for grilling steaks and this one looked good because of all it's rave reviews. I let the meat sit in this marinade in a large ziploc bag overnight, then grilled it up the next day. My family was blown away! It is great, and the meat is so flavorfull!! This is definitely a keeper.

This was ok, but not as good as other marinades on this site. This needs salt! Made exactly to the recipe. Used this on strip steaks that were very lean, which could have contributed to the problem. I won't make again but thanks anyway.

This marinade was absolutely FANTASTIC!!!  I actually used it on a 4 pound top sirloin roast done in the oven.  Marinaded for about 18 hours and it came out so tender and full of flavour, everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed was using 1/2 c. of olive oil instead of 1 c. of vegetable oil and I didn't use the onion.  Wonderful, will continue to use and am anxious to try it on some steaks!  Thanks for the great recipe!
**UPDATE Nov 1/08** - have used this a few times & it is truly wonderful!  We personally don't feel that all of the oil is required, I cut it in half at least.  I have always used olive oil and have also used whole grain dijon mustard (yummy).  This marinade is full of flavour and yields moist and tender meat!  My most recent use of it was a 2lb sirloin tip roast and I cut the marinade in half (which was PLENTY!).  Only had time to marinate for 3 hours, still SO GOOD!

I made this last night and used rib-eye steaks. I marinaded them about 10 hours and grilled them on my electric barbecue. They were delicious!! Extremely tasty...I used a half recipe for one pound of meat. This was enough. Thanks, Kat!!

This was excellent.  My husband & I have been looking for a good steak marinade for a while now-- this is the one!  I only added 1/3 cup soy sauce b/c soy sauce is always too salty for my tastes.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This was terrible!  The flavor was mostly vinegar/mustard and after using up quite a few ingredients, I was very disappointed.  I will not be making this again.

I was so happy with this, thank you. I wish I had planned this better but I just Googled at 5:00pm 'steak marinade' and this came up. So I prepared the ingredients as quickly as I could (so easy because virtually everything most people have). I could only marinade for 60 minutes because everyone was starving but they all raved about it. I'll do it again with more time to spare but even in the 60 minutes, it was a massive hit. Thank you so much for sharing :) so kind.

I thought that the marinade was delicious. I even sauteed the onions to go on top! we only marinaded it for 2 1/2 hours. My boyfriend doesn't like soy sauce at all so he wasn't a huge fan. I want to substitute it with the A1 sauce and see how that works out for him. All in all it was very very good on our steak!!

This is the best steak marinade I've ever used! I marinated a chuck round (after tenderizing) for about 6 hours prior to grilling, and it came out great! We had people over for dinner and everyone commented on how wonderful the steak was. My modifications: I took the advice of other reviewers and added some A1 to the mix. I also used white wine vinegar because I didn't have red on hand. This was a wonderful and easy recipe and I'll definitely use it again.

I followed the recipe to a T but did not like the results at all.
I used a grilling steak, so it should have been tender on its own merits - however, this marinade added nothing and I let the meat marinate for 24 hrs.  Very flat taste.

I shrunk this recipe considerably and also reduced the oil to 1T and it was still fantastic after a 6 hour marinade on grilled sirloin steak. This marinade is good because it subtly flavors and tenderizes without overpowering the taste of the meat itself. That is, the steak still tastes like steak when you're done - just a really good one.  I'll be using this one again.

This marinade is delicious!  What I like about it so much, is that most of the ingredients are items I already have at home.  I only marinated my steak (an extra large top sirloin) for an hour in the fridge, and I couldn't believe how amazing it was.  I did add a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce to the recipe, only because my husband likes spicy food so much.  I used spicy brown/deli mustard since I did not have the Dijon-style on hand that the recipe calls for.  I also modified the amount of the recipe because I wasn't cooking multiple steaks.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Don't even need steak sauce with this one! Thanks for such a great recipe!

I am so sorry, but this recipe really didn't go well in my house. I used sirloin marinating steak, and marinated for a few hours hoping it would come out nice and tender. Unfortunately, the flavours did not absorb into the meat, and the meat was still really tough and hard to eat. I was very disapointed. So sorry, but thanks for sharing!

Hubs reluctantly agreed to try this even tho' we rarely marinate our steaks.  While I am more open-minded about it, I found I was not moved by this and wondered why I wanted to mask the flavor of a good piece of beef in the first place. Maybe I'd appreciate this more with a tougher cut of meat like flank or skirt steak.

I used this recipe, but didn't have dijon mustard on hand, so we didn't put any in. We marinated the steaks over night in the fridge. It was a HIT! My husband said "This is a keeper, don't forget how you did this". (I won't forget, because it's now in my recipe box.) LOVE this site. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I have been using this recipe for over a year, and it is the ONLY way we make our steaks now.  Delmonico steaks are our favorite, and instead of throwing away the marinated onions, we wrap them in a foil pack and grill for about 15 minutes. Serve over the steaks.  Delish!

I've used this mari many times and it is always a hit.  Realy works well for grilled foods and is a star on beef but pulls double duty as a flavorful mari for substantial fish (salmon/trout) as well.  One batch can be used to satisfy a mixed crowd of meat eaters and fishies alike.  It makes selecting sides easier since the flavor notes are the same.

This was great! The only major change I made was I used regular mustard instead of dijon. I was only able to soak it for about 3 hours, but next time I will try for overnight to really make it great! Our steaks were as good as you can get anywhere!

What I like most about this marinade is that it uses ingredients that I have on hand.  It does the job and it does it well!  It's even better than my moms marinade...now that's saying something!!

Top notch! I cooked the steaks on a grill pan on my stove and cooked the onions on the side of the pan. Topping the steaks with the marinated onions added a ton of flavor and pizzaz. Great recipe!

I used this marinade and because of scheduling conflicts it ended up marinading for close to 36 hrs. Boy, were my T-bones tender. Loved it!

Best Marinade!!!!!!!!! I used this recipe at my daughter's graduation party for the kabobs. Peoplejust couldn't get enough.  I had to make more the next day for my household. I suggest that you marinade the meat overnight, it will make the meat perfectly tender and won't take long to grill.

this is the first review I have written after using this website for years. This is by far the best marinade for steaks. I omitted the mustard but used the rest of the ingredients. I used these amounts on 5 ribeyes. I put some of the marinade on the grill prior to putting the steaks on. It was yummy and everyone loved the steaks. This one is  a keeper for sure.

Just finished preparing the marinade and it really does taste delicious!  I can't wait to taste the final outcome.  Will let ya'll know how my steaks turned out.  I'll rate the marinade itself on taste to be 5 stars.  The real test is how the steak tastes.

OK> My steak marinaded for 24 hours. (not by choice but "life happens" anyway.  I thought it was good.  I will use again because I love the way the marinade tastes before you place the meat in it.  A little less time on the marinade and it would have been perfect! I think.

Im sure this is a great marinade for some, but I found it to be to strong with vinegar.  I even added brown sugar to sweeten it a little.  Didnt help.  Then again, I dont like steak sauce either.  Thats what this reminded me of.  I prefer barbeque sauce with steak if it doesnt have a flavor .

fantastic, allow to sit at room temp 1 hour before cooking.  Spicy brown mustard tastes great in place of dijon

I am reviewing this for my 15 year old son since he is the only one who ate it. I made 2 steak and he ate them both before I got a chance to taste them! I will be making this again so that I might be able to get a bite next time.

Wonderful!  My husband, who is not very opinionated and rarely expresses strong likes or dislikes in food, sat down, took a bite of this steak and let out a long "mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm".  Enough for me!  We're going to keep this close at hand.  Delicious!

Very very good on New York Strips.  Even the kids loved it.  Had to substitute the Red Wine vinegar with Apple Cider vinegar and didn't have enough lemon juice on hand so I added 1 lime.   Served this with large baked potatoes done on a charcoal grill (yum!).  When you put the steaks on the grill you have all that good marinade full of onions...what to do?  I scooped out the onions and a little marinade and put it in a pot on the grill side burner.  I let that cook down until there was only a little juice left (and no raw meat germs) and then dumped the mixture over the steaks as I plated them.  I will definitely do this again!

I was excited to try this marinade since it had such a high rating.  Since it states "a great marinade for any cut of beef" I purposedly bought less expensive chuck steaks to try this recipe on, hoping for good results.  I marinaded the steaks overnight figuring they would need it since they were steaks of a lesser grade.  I have to admit we were extremely dissappointed.  The flavor was too strong overpowering and yes, like other reviewers commented "sour". The steaks were not even slightly tenderized.  Since I have used soy sauce and worcestershire in other steak marinades I am inclined to believe it may have been the lemon juice/vinegar mixture that we were turned off by.  I will not be making this again.

This was the perfect marinade for my family.  I followed it exactly and left my Texas Broil marinating all day when I was at work.  THe steak was tendar and FULL of flavor.  Not overpowering, just enough.  We also grilled the onion slices in the marinade, very good!

We did not like this marinade at all. It did not taste good and it burned the outside of the steak. I could tolerate that with a good tasting marinade, but this was barely worth eating.

This recipe is awesome! This is one of the best steak marinades that I have ever had and my friends agree! I have no complaints about it whatsoever. I like to take the leftover marinade and boil it on high for a few minutes (to kill all of the bacteria and to soften the onions) then I use some of it to baste the steaks while they are on the grill and then I serve the rest of it with the steak. Excellent!

This recipe is SO delicious!  I've used it several times now, and found the onions are great if you slice them, and then grill them next to the steaks, in a little foil pouch.  My guests have RAVED over steaks marinated in this- regardless of the cut of meat.  ENJOY!

Excellent, excellent, excellent!! I took the advice of others and also grilled the onions. I wrapped them in foil with a handful of garlic cloves - delicious. I grilled the steaks, topped them with the onions and garlic, and topped that with some bleu cheese crumbles. This marinade is absolutely perfect and delicious. Oh, I marinaded for 24 hours.
I also cut the soy sauce in half and used some Cattleman's BBQ sauce to replace the other half.

This is an excellent marinade, even for cheaper cuts of meat.  I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, which I always do and added more garlic, simply because for me, the more garlic, the better.  Definitely a keeper!

In the nine years I have been with my hubby, he refuses to let me marinade steaks, but yet he douses them with ketchup! He raves about steaks when we go out to eat and I have tried to tell him they use a marinade. Finally tonight he let me marinade them!!!!! I sliced the onions large and soaked them with the meat. When it came time to grill, we placed the onions in foil and grilled them seperate. His first bite was of onion and he raved about how good it tasted. Then he bit into his steak....he didn't even put ketchup on it!!!!!! He loved it! I also loved it. I did not change anything in the recipe. We will be using this from now on....even if it is just for onions!

Our family eats steak almost every Friday and we have prepared it in a million different ways, all good but this is such the "BOMB"!!!  Love Love Love it, the flavor is amazing!  You will not be dissapointed in trying this.  We always use either Rib-Eye or New York and it's great on both.  Will use this when impressing company for sure.

I marinaded some sizzlers for about 2 hours in the fridge then turned and basted them with the remander of the marinade on the grill. They turned out great. Very tasty and the meat was still tender. I will use this recipe again.

Wow!  I won't ever make steak on the grill again without marinating it.  This was great, the only change I made was to cut the recipe in 1/2 since it was just steaks for 2 of us, and I used regular vinegar instead of red wine since I didn't have any.  I added 1 Tbsp of red raspberry dressing. This was so good, and I only marinated them for 2 1/2 hours.  I didn't need to use A-1 sauce!!

Oh wow this was soooo good!  It was just a bit too salty on the outer edges, even though I used low-sodium soy sauce and only marinaded for 3 hours (which was perfect).  I'll use less soy sauce next time, but otherwise this was goooood stuff!  Thanks for sharing!

Truly outstanding -- everyone at the party asked for the recipe for this marinade (which I started calling the "kitchen sink" marinade!).  The only thing I didn't add was fresh onion -- instead, I added dried minced onion and dried shallots.  I doubled the recipe and marinaded 4 2-lb london broil.  Highly recomended.

Excellent marinade!  I followed the recipe, only changing it to 3 cloves of garlic (which I pressed), and then marinated the steaks for about 9 hours.  The flavor was outstanding, not too salty at all.  The meat was so tender as well.  My boyfriend called it the best steak he had ever had.  I will make this recipe again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful!  My boyfriend thought it was amazing.  I'm not very true to recipes, but this one was very simple, easy and, I'll admit, only marinaded for about 4 hours.  Still great.  Goes to the top of the recipe box!  Thanks.  Rita

This was my first attempt at marinating steaks. I usually season steak with salt, pepper, maybe some garlic or onion powder and butter. Because I like the flavor of the actual meat, I'm going to stick to my old ways. the marinate was way overpowering. I will probably not make this recipe again. My husband described the onions and the meat as "sour" tasting. I'm sure that was due to the red wine vinegar... I did marinate overnight, so maybe if it wasn't marinated as long it would be okay.

I am very new at cooking. I used the 20 servings version of this recipe to marinade 4 steaks. Is that the correct amount of servings? If I scaled the marinade to 4 servings, it wouldn't fully cover the meat. At the 20 servings version, the soy and the Worcestershire dominated the flavor. Any suggestions?

This recipe is excellent.  I double the recipe and make it in a mayonaise jar and keep it in the fridge.  I use usually once a week.  Everyone that has tasted it has asked for the recipe.

This is an excellent marinade!  I've tried several over the years and this is the tastiest.  It made the steak so tender and flavorful.  The only change that I might make next time is add honey to balance the saltiness.  It wasn't overly salty, but for a variation I might like a slightly sweeter flavor.  Overall, this is a fabulous recipe that will replace all of my others!

This made our steak taste like it was from a restaurant! We used about 1 1/2 lbs of flank steak and used it for fajitas. So juicy and flavorful! Definitely a keeper recipe for a quick and easy marinade!

This marinade was delicious! I used everything except the onion and the cloves of garlic. Instead, I used a few tablespoons of garlic powder. I didn't pour the marinade over the meat however. I used really thin slices of meat (it was pepper steak meat) and I dipped each one into the marinade. After that, I rubbed the top layer down again with the marinade and I let it sit for about 30 minutes. It came out delicious and everyone loved it!

The best steak marinade I've every used!    I warmed the marinade in the microwave before adding it to the steaks, it tasted good enough to drink.  Used a cheap cut of meat, added a little extra garlic, used half olive oil, half butter, was PERFECT!  When the steak was done, I topped with melted garlic butter.

My family has used a recipe very similar to this one for years. We use a bit more Worcestershire and soy sauce, lemon juice, and red wine vinegar, omit the onion and add 1/2 C of olive oil. If you don't have prepared Dijon mustard, 2 T of ground mustard works fine, and throw in 2 tsps of parsley.

I tried this one to impress a female friend with my culinary skills on Valentine's day.  Mission Accomplished.  It made our steaks so tender and flavorful. Excellent marinade.

Pretty good marinade but honestly the steak was not as tender as other marinades have made it. Probably stick to the old marinade I was using.

I have made this marinade for my steaks three times now and will be doing it again for my husband's fire crew (USAFA). I love it! Very tender and yet it doesn't take away the steak flavor. I have used a wide variety of steaks with this, and they all turn out great...except when my hubby left mine on the grill too long and burned it. I was so mad because I had been looking forward to that steak all day...and it was burnt to a crisp. His was done perfectly though...imagine that! I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good marinade.

Used this for filet mignons and it was well received. I thought it needed a bit more salt but hubby thought it was the perfect amount. My daughter also thought it was great and ended up eating mine (I made her turkey tetrazini).

This makes the tastiest steak.  When the grocery stores have their buy one get one free sale on London Broils, I get two, make this marinade and put the steak in a ziplock bag with the marinade and freeze them.  It makes a wonderfully tender steak!

Mmmm.  Whoever said this tasted like vinegar must've forgotten to add the soy sauce, cause this has a tangy/zippy thing going on.  Which I love.  I'm not a big meat eater so am not that experienced at getting a great steak, so this is exactly what I need to get one. :-)  Used with a London broil, marinated overnight and grilled.  I estimated this to be good for about 4 lb. meat, but I like some extra for dipping.  The store had more London broils on sale a few days later & I bought another just to make this recipe again.  I'd like to see what this would do for chicken.

Maybe we did something wrong, but this really didn't live up to the reviews, it didn't add much flavor to the meat.

I made this for a new year's eve dinner party for my mother-in-law's freinds.  Everyone loved it--even my mother-in-law that doesn't like steak.  I marinated overnight and used sirloin steaks.  It was better than going out to eat!  Thank you!

Delicious, marinated a moose steak and topped it off with portobello port sauce for steak (also on this site).  Served with broccoli cheese stuffed baked potato and red wine.  Perfect.

Great recipe and very easy.  Tried it with a roast, let it marinade for 4 hours then cooked in a convection oven.  The result was delicious.  Will definitely use this marinade again.

This is a large amount of marinade, so I cut this recipe in half for marinating two steaks.  My husband and I eat steak about once a week and this is now the only marinade I use.  It is delicious.  I get a lot of compliments from guests that our steaks are the best in town!

Love it!!! I accidentally added a little too much worchester sauce but the steaks tasted awesome. By far the best marinade I have EVER tried and I have made quite a few from scratch as well as purchased more of the pre-made marinades you see in stores. This is great. Ill be using this much more in the future. Kudos to whoever created this. Awesome

This turned out very good but I made a pretty big substitution. I did not have soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce. I then added about 1/2 tsp garlic salt. The addition of sweet was a nice touch.

I have never posted a review, but this is the best marinade. I have used this recipe countless times with rave reviews. The roughest cuts of meats become fork-tender when left to marinate over 24-48 hrs. Thanks for such an awesome recipe. The only change I made was to use olive oil which is a staple in my kithchen.

I made the this recipe exactly as printed.  It was ok if you like a tart flavor on your steak.  I didn't believe it enhanced the flavor of the meat.  I will not be making this recipe again.

Have been waiting for some time to try this, and tonight was the night.  Following someone's suggestion, I made the marinade and bagged it with a  kc strip, and then froze it.  Got it out to thaw, and, as it was thawing, the ingredients were working.  I had one tender, juicy, tasty steak.  BUT, I am not a fan of red wine vinegar on my steak.  However, I used it anyway, just so I could see - did not like it.  (I *have* to have red wine vinegar on my subs.)  Next time, and there will be one, I am going to substitute either lemon or lime juice for the red wine vinegar.  The other flavors blended so nicely that I don't want to fool with them.

I've been using this for years. I used Jack Daniels honey Dijon mustard when I first started using it. Now I just add a tablespoon of honey and a couple shots of bourbon to the mix.  I have a reputation for making fantastic steaks thanks to this marinade!

Marinated a pot roast overnight and tossed the roast in the crockpot the next day with a can of tomatoes on top.  Yummy!!!!  Served it with a multigrain rice/quinoa medley, steamed veggies and salad.  Made a nice "Sunday Dinner".

A definite keeper in my home and I've used this recipe twice already. I use it on my cheaper meats to get a tender and tastier meal. I did switch it up a bit to fit the needs of what were in my cupboards. I used red wine and stone ground mustard.

GREAT marinade! We've tried it on steak and chicken, but think it's the most flavorful on grilled fish!

I am an awful cook when it comes to steak!! I tried this recipe and it was great!! The steaks weren't even bad when I over cooked them.  I also took the left over marinate from the steaks and threw some button mushrooms in to soak and then threw them on the grill in aluminum foil!!! Now I make the marinade just for mushrooms once in a while!!! Thank you for the recipe!!

This was by far the best we've ever had! Thanks a ton. Unfortunately we didn't have red wine vinegar, so I replaced it with a smaller amount of balsamic. But next time, we'll try it exactly as written.

This made quite a bit, so I had extra. The first time I tried it, it was following the recipe. We liked it, but it was a bit bland. The next time I used this marinade, I put in a few drops of Franks Hot Sauce, and oh, boy was it yummy!

This marinade is quite good. My husband liked it and he is fussy about marinades. I fried my steak on the stove but in warmer weather I will try again on the barbeque. I threw a couple of cans of mushrooms in with the steak, drained them then cooked them. This made the mushrooms a little too vinegary so I don't think I would do that again. But the steak was tender and tasty.

This recipe turned what I thought was freezer-burnt filet mignon into amazing steak kabobs.  This is an amazing marinade, which I am sharing with my entire family and am planning to make again and again.  Perfect for tailgating! Thank you!

An excellent marinade. The first time I used this was on some thick cut, cheap steaks. Made them so tender, and gave them an excellent flavour. The only change I made was using steak spice instead of the pepper. Would make any steak tender and tastey.

I used this marinade in place of my husband's usual, and it was great. I only let it marinate for about 30-45 minutes before cooking, but it was still very flavorful. Couln't taste the dijon which I don't like anyway. Used McCormick's Smokehouse black pepper for an extra kick

This beats the usual bottle recipe anytime! I'm really not the biggest red meat eater but it was worth tring.  I let it marinate for a little over an hour, then cooked it on low/med flame, it turned out great!  Usually I have to add A1, or salt, or something, but this was full of flavor and I didn't have to add anything.  Thanks, it was amazing

Good flavor.  Did not overpower the meat. Will definitely make again.  I was a little uncertain of the lemon juice but it did work well.

AMAZING!! It made my steak almost buttery it was so melt in my mouth good. I used balsamic vineger since I didnt have any red wine vineger. I also limited the amount of soy sauce from the suggestion of the other reviews. I will definitly use this one over and over again. I love that it is made with ingrediants that I had in my pantry

I loved this marinade. It was so easy and I had everything in the house already. I did two different bags because I'm dieting. I did one bag the regular way and on the other one I omit the oil. But they both were very good and tasty.

I have used this marinade for every cut of meat out there and it ALWAYS turns out juicy with this! I have left the meat in over night or for 1 hour before I cook it and either way it turns out fabulous every time! I do add about 2 tbls of A1 and subtract 1/2 of the soy sauce (too salty for me) but other than that it is my favorite!!!

AWESOME!  I used Apple Cider Vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I added some of the suggested items, like 2 TBS Brown Sugar & 2 TBS A1.  It was the best steak.  No need for any extra sauce after it was grilled.  So tender and flavorful.

Really good!  Scaled down for just a few steaks and had to sub balsamic since I was out of red wine vinegar.  Very tasty.

OKay so i bought everything and instead of red wine i used sherry vinegar. So i wrote down the recipw and come back online somehow the recipe was for 20 ppl lmao. But it was okay because i used it on top round steak, they were huge so the marinade worked. For about 2 hours, then i poured most of it out then just enought to keep it moist and tender for about a whole day. But i cheated and cut a chunk and cooked it, omg it wassss delicious! I will tell everyone, or maybe keep it to myself. but next time i am going to check the servings twice! lol. it was okay because it was with roasted veggies! the taste palette mixed well.

I also dont often review recipes, but this marinade was exceptionally tasty!  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and marinated some beef chuck steaks with it for only about an hour.  It was so simple, yet so amazing!  My family is a bit spoiled by my cooking, so they dont hesitate to tell me when they dont like something that I make.  My wife, 3 year old, AND 2 year old scarfed this down!  My 2 year old had seconds and thirds.  Highly recommended!

A good marinade.  I would recommend leaving it overnight to give it more flavor.  I'll try that next time.  I may add cilantro and jalapeno next time as well.

This was good. The flavor didn't blow me away...but I wasn't disappointed either. We grilled a large london broil after letting it marinade several hours and it was pretty tender. We'll likely use this one again.

Simple and easy....wished I could remember to make this and marinade the steaks over night.  No doubt they would be amazing.  Still great with only a few hours of marinating.  Husband LOVES this and ask me to use this marinade every time I grill the steaks.  I did adjust per everyone's suggestions.

I rarely rate recipes.  I also rarely use a marinade for steak, but decided to step out of the box a little bit.   This is bar none the best way I've ever done steak. I used New York Strips, marinaded them for about 4 hours then threw them on the grill. They didn't need anything else - no steak sauce, nothing.  My husband has told me this is the only way I'm to prepare steaks from now on.   They had so much flavor and were so very very tender. DEFINITELY A KEEPER!! THANK YOU!!

I bought two strip steaks and cooked the first one without marinading it. The next day I decided to marinade the second steak, so I found this recipe. What a difference it made! I marinaded the steak in the fridge for four hours, and it was like this was a totally different steak compared to the first one. It was so juicy and tender, and so much more flavorful. I picked this marinade based on the high rating, and because of the fact that it was so simple and I already had all the ingredients at home. Thanks for this simple but great recipe!

A great marinade.  The only change I made was onion powder instead of the onion.

This is the best steak marinade.  It's so simple.  The only thing I've changed is the tablespoon of pepper.  I use steak seasoning instead.  Be sure to let this marinade all day and your steak will be so tender and moist.  Even the fat will melt in your mouth.  I can't stand fat on my meat, but when I use this marinade I can't resist the tiny bit left on them.  YUM!

this marinade was like a little piece of heaven dancing on my tongue, I followed the recipe, except I omitted the garlic powder and used fresh minced garlic instead. I'm will definitely use this again, thanks again for the recipe!

It smelled like it was going to be very flavorful, but all it did was maybe make the steak tender. My husband and I enjoyed it, but our 3 year old said he didn't like it.

I used this to marinate meat that I was putting over a salad.  the steak was SO good I didn't use any dressing b/c i didn't want to mask the flavor of the meat.  Definitely using this for ALL my steak from now on!

Oh my!  This is the only marinade I will ever use for steak.  It really made for the best steaks we've ever had. I'm sure the onions would have made it even better, but I didn't use them and it was still amazing. Thanks!

Loved this recipe.  I actually marinated for 48 hours because it had been raining and we could not grill when we wanted to.  This recipe reminded me of the seasoning a local mexican restaurant uses on their fajita meat.  It was delish!

Pretty good marinade-It does the job, and the flavor is very subtle for those who really enjoy that meat flavor and don't prefer a steak that tastes like the marinade you're using. (side note, I reduced the soy sauce by 1/2 for the less salty flavor) Also, no matter the directions, I always soak a steak for at least 2 days, and I use mainly sirloin and rib eye. Not sure how well this marinade would be for other cuts.

We all loved this recipe! I basted the steaks on the grill until the last 3 minutes of cooking and ohmygoodness, they were amazing! The marinade basically makes it's own steak sauce.  The only thing I changed was the oil; I used olive oil instead (healthier). Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!!

It was edible. That's all I can say for this marinade. I think it's the red wine vinegar that really made it taste poorly ... maybe a different vinegar would yield a better flavour.

I've been using this for every steak I make and it comes out fantastic.  I marinade it about 6-8 hours before my hubby grills it. If it sits in the marinade for too long though, the oil will cause it to burn on the grill.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used this marinade on some london broil I had cut up into bite size pieces for kabobs, it sat in the marinade for two days in the fridge and it came out fantastic. My hubby who is the grill master of the house-didn't even request any sort of steak sauce or BBQ sauce to put on the kabobs. The marinade was just perfect. I did dice the onion but that was the only change I made. GREAT marinade!

Best steaks I've ever grilled!  Used the cheapo sirloin tip steaks.  3.29/lb and they came out tender and delicious.  My boyfriend loves this marinade and we will be having it again next weekend when we go camping!  I put the marinated onions in a foil packet on the top rack of grill at the time i fired it up, and by the time the steaks were done, the onions were perfect!  BEST MARINADE RECIPE FOR STEAKS EVER!  Thank you!

This marinade is delicious!  My husband and son put A1 sauce on every steak I've ever cooked...but not this one:)!  I substitute A1 for the worcestershire, since I didn't have any.

Excellent...I didn't have any dijon, so I used regular and it was still very good.  Next time I will make a foil packet of mushrooms / onions and use some of the marinade on them.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent! I agree with other reviewers that this marinade is great. I followed all the ingredients, changed one step. I took the onion and put it in my mini food processer and pulverized it to a juicy paste. I then added it to the marinade. It created a thick consistency that adhered to the steaks beautifully. I also do this with onion and add it to am hamburger meat for burgers. Juicy!

Very tender.  I did take other posters' advice and used 1/2 the oil (I used olive oil) and substituted 1/2 of the soy sauce with a steak sauce the hubby made.  I also doubled the amount of garlic because we love garlic in my household.  The steak was very good and very tender, but the onions were phenominal.  I will definitely keep this as a possible veggie marinade as well.

We made this recipe as stated- but with changing the amount based on our smaller amount of steak.  The meat had a great flavor and we definitely liked it.  Marinaded it for about 8 hours prior to broiling.

It was okay, definitely not the most flavourful marinade I've ever had. But I really liked the red wine vinegar, I think I would use more of it and maybe eliminate the lemon juice.

We like the taste of all the additives.  Next time we will decrease the worscetershire sauce.  That would be the only thing we would change.

Love this marinade.  I even love the way it smells when I'm making it.  What I do is make extra marinade, slice up a bunch of onions and mushrooms and marinate them as well.  I then saute them in the marinade.  After grilling the steak (I always use skirt steak) I slice it up and add to the onions and mushrooms and cook it all together for a few more minutes.  OMG!  Unbelievable delicious!

I used Ny strip steak with this marinade. I thought it was good but seemed like too much oil and marinade all together. Maybe its better with a different steak. I dunno Ill try others. May use again.

I marinated Filet Mignon for about 9 hours and adjusted the measurements to how many cuts I had and followed this recipe to a T. I was completely disappointed. I will not be making this again. The flavor completely overpowered the meat and had a bad after taste. I have made the “Filet Mignon with Rich Balsamic Glaze” on this website and loved it. If you’re looking for a marinade for filet mignon I would not use this recipe.

This was excellent. It adds some taste but doesn't overpower the flavor of the actual steak. Just perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was excellent! I didn't add the onions because I was really wanting more of the garlic flavor. I was generous with the amount of garlic. :-) I didn't have enough regular oil so I used some olive oil too. I used this marinade on 3/4 inch t-bone steaks. I only had a few hours to let them marinade but they still turned out tender and flavorful! (My husband does a great job grilling!)

I recently started cooking so this might be operator error but I wasnt crazy about the marinade. It wasnt bad but it wasnt anything worth doing again....maybe i made a mistake somewhere although it seemed dummy proof.

Very tasty.  I actually made this twice in 2 days.  I followed other reviewers advice and cut back on the soy sauce.  The second time I also cut back a little on the red wine vinegar, found it just a tad overpowering.  The first time I marinated for about 6 hrs the 2nd time for about 24 hours.

Out of this world!! Even my self-professed "king of the grill" husband was impressed!  Very easy to make.  Because we are garlic junkies, I added in additional minced garlic to taste. This recipe will definitely become our "house marinade".  Thank you for posting it!

I have made this several times this summer and I have to say...hands down..this is the BEST marinade I have ever made.  We have used it for everything from steak (Tri Tips from Costco are great!), chicken breasts and even pork chops.  The flavor you receive in the end product is just out of this world and everything we have made has come out juicy and delicous!  Just remember not to overcook your meat and let it rest under foil for at least 10 minutes before serving!  5 stars all the way!  Thanks so much for posting the recipe!  :)

This marinade was pretty good.  I cut it down to 10 servings as I wasn't sure of how much meat 20 would marinate.  I let the meat (top sirloin) sit for about 24 hours and it was tender and juicy.  I did tenderize it prior though.  I subbed honey dijon as it was what I had and used onion powder instead of fresh onions since my 5 year old will only eat them if he doesn't know they are there.  Overall good but seems like too much oil...

I tried this recipe with eye of round steaks since this recipe was labled as "a great marinade for any cut of beef".

 While I know eye of round is a lean cut, I thought the 8 hour marinade along with the many "forks" I did would help tenderize it. 

 After grilling the meat and found out how tough it was, I braised the meat for an hour in about a cup of water. I also found the taste somewhat bland, so I added about 2 tablespoons of steak seasoning to the liquid the meat cooked in.

 This might be great for a tender cut, but it does not help any lean cut you have.

One of the BEST marinades I’ve tried!
I used red wine, and a splash of white distilled vinegar because I didn’t have actual red wine vinegar.
Just before taking the steaks off the grille I put the onions in a pan with the remaining marinade over high heat to caramelize them…the marinade and onions turned out fantastic!

Fantastic flavor. This is the best steak marinade that I've ever tried. My ONLY complaint is that it didn't really help in the tenderization process. Maybe if we had marinated it longer (only an hour) it would have turned out less tough, but it was such a wonderful flavor, I'll probably use it every time.

Very happy with this! The only changes I made were to halve the amount of oil (I used light olive)-- and double the garlic!! The marinade doesn't SEEM like anything special alone. But it really compliments the meat when grilled. DO GRILL THE ONIONS! YUM!!!!(Cut them thicker to lessen the heartache of losing them through the grate.) Great recipe!

This marinade was excellent. I used teryaki sauce instead of soy. I am only 19, and I haven't done too much grilling before, but I grilled the marinaded steak on a gas grill and grilled the onions also.    The steak turned out great, especially with the grilled onions on top!  And this was SO easy!  : )  Also, I only marinaded the steaks for 3 hours, and I could still taste it well.

I marinated 3 huge chuck steaks in this yesterday and grilled 2 of them on the George Foreman grill for dinner. I left the 3rd one in the marinade and froze it that way for later use. Can't wait to see how it turns out. I will use a more tender cut of meat next time though.

The only reason I marinate any of the meat I cook is for my husband who loves to have a lot of flavor in all his food. Usually I will save some unmarinated meat for myself, but this time I marinated two steaks for my husband and I...and I was very pleasantly surprised. It had a really great taste that was not too overpowering of the actual meat flavor. It was really good and my husband loved it as well!

Wanted to try a different marinade. I was a little worried that the soy sauce may dominate the flavors and although it was a good marinade, the soy did indeed.
I used a baggie and put the striploin steaks into it in the fridge for around 3 days. Very tender - next time - less soy sauce (1/2 - 1/2 with something else - steak sauce?).

I loved this recipe.  I usually don't like marinades but I had 2 pounds of cheap steak that I wanted to "beef" up a bit.  It was outstanding!  What a great way to avoid paying a kings ransom for a good steak!

I'm giving a four star because I thought it was a great marinade for the veges although I did not think it added anything to the meat.  Maybe it was because I cooked the veges/meat in a stir fry instead of grilling like a kabob...all in all, definitely will use again!!!

This was okay! We used T-bones and Porterhouses. Maybe I will use a flank steak next time.

We thought this was the best steak of the summer.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Like others had said, no flavor stood out so that's why it was so great.  In-laws raved about it.

Easy and delicious! Steaks were VERY tender. No one even added more spices(salt, pepper, etc.) to them when eating (a great sign in my family!)

This can be a little salty for my taste but my husband LOVES this marinade. I've used it several times, on different cuts of steak and each time the marinade worked like a charm.

Excellent! My husband even said it was better than a lot of steaks we get at steakhouses! Marinade is perfect (I didn't have garlic cloves, so I used garlic powder) - brings out the steak flavor perfectly. Couldn't ask for a better marinade!

Great marinade.  I thought my steak was a little salty, but my husband and son had only rave reviews.  I used 1 tbsp. wasabi in place of the mustard.  Next time I will use 2 full tbsp. for more zip.  Thanks Kat!

this marinade had great flavor. I left the meat in it for about 4 hours. I started with a tough round steak and was hoping for my tenderization, hence the 4 star rating. otherwise, flavorwise, it was definatly 5 stars.

Loved this recipe!!!! I did not have dijon mustard so instead, I added a little honey mustard. Not sure if it really changed the taste of the original but, WOW! I will use this again for sure!!!!

I marinated rib eye steaks for 4 hours and then grilled.  It was good, but considering the rave reviews, I thought I was going to jump for joy.  As I said in another review, I'll make the marinade again, but if I do not have ingredients on hand, I'll stick with italian dressing.  Thank you.

this was by far the best marinade i have ever used.  I used it on a london broil, and let it marinade for about 8 hours.  I topped the meat with blue cheese butter recipe I got on this site also.  This was a huge hit.  Will use this one time and again.

This was a good marinade.  It lacked a little kick.  Next time I may add some honey or bbq sauce.  It was however very tasty!  Worked wonders served with mushrooms and onions as well.

This marinade was easy and delicious! Considering that this was my first time making a marinade from scratch AND grilling steaks, they came out great. I marinated NY Strip steaks for about 8 hours and threw them on my George Foreman (not technically grilling, but hey...) and everyone loved them, even my picky little 7 year old.

Really good marinade!! I was a bit leary because of the soy sauce and thought it would leave that soy sauce taste but it's a nice medley of ingredients that evens it out. I only marinated the steaks for about 6 hours. Next time I will marinade longer.

Thanks!

We prefer other allrecipes marinades.  This didn't tenderize the steaks (and I used good steaks too).  And I agree with Rita... needs salt!

We love this marinade!  I use it every time we barbeque.  It always turns out great.  I like to put the onions in the food processor instead of chopping them so the meat absorbs more of the flavor.

Great marinade, both my fiance and I loved it. Very easy too. I used low sodium soy sauce, still great taste. Much better than store-bought marinades.

It needs a little bit of salt added to it. Otherwise it was pretty good

I marinated steaks in this overnight. They were the BEST steaks I have ever made at home. Rave reviews. I substituted red wine for the red wine vinegar, but think either would be fine.

This wasn't the best, but good. We only marinated the steaks for an hour and they were nice and tender. I tasted a vinegar taste in some parts of the meat from the red wine vinegar which I didn't really like, but I think if I marinate the meat overnight the flavors will blend better. Will try it again. Thanks!

Really good and just what I was looking for.  I didn't have wine vinager and used half cider vinegar and half red wine...can I do that?  Well it still tasted great.  I also like it because you can "play" with it if you wish, and add other things according to taste.

This is very good, the steak turns out very tender. I is a little time consuming which is why I gave it four stars but it is well worth the trouble ofputting it together.

Wonderful marinade!  Marinated 2lbs. sirloin tip steaks for about 9 hrs.  Fantastic!  Everyone raved!  I did cut down a little on the Soy Sauce, but otherwise kept to the recipe (except that I used dehydrated minced onion for ease and convenience, but I look forward to using fresh sliced onion next time).  Excellent!

I don't eat meat, but I made this marinade for guests and everyone loved it!  I marinated it overnight and the result was an extremely tender, tasty piece of meat.  A great recipe!

This is GREAT marinade.  I use it for my steak kabobs.  I just add whatever vegetables to skewers along with the marinated meat and then grill.  If I don't have a particular ingredient I just use something else or delete it.  All the ingredients work together very well.  I have used it many times and even if it only marinates for 1-2 hours, it is still good.  You don't necessarily need the whole 24 hours.

This recipe is wonderful.  My husband (who HAD a favorite way to season our steaks) actually requests this instead.  It smells so good when I'm preparing it, that I'd lick my fingers were it not for the raw meat!  It tastes so great on our grilled steaks!  Thank you.

My husband and I really like this recipe and will definitely use it again! I used less oil though which didn't compromise the juiciness whatsoever. We marinated our steak overnight and it was the juicest steak we've had in a LONG time - wonderful!

I love it. The citrus from the lemon comes through without being overpowering. I had unknowingly run out of garlic, so used garlic powder instead. And we always use Ponzu sauce instead of Soy Sauce, but those were the only, minor, changes I made.

I had thin cut steak I marinated for about 24 hours and the flavor was wonderful! My family really enjoyed the flavor, so I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand!

Excellent marinade.   I used this on a small ribeye loin.   I vacuum sealed this along with a loin, set in the fridge for most of a day, then to the freezer until today, 2 months later.   It was juicy and flavorful.

Very tasty. I threw in sliced mushrooms with the onions. I broiled the steaks and pan seared the mushrooms and onions until the juice was gone. Very tasty over the steak, and/or as a side.  The meat was tender and good. I  used infused vinegar- garlic, and basil- because I had it handy. It is not necessary. Very flavorful just the way it is written.

I am not the cook in the family so I was looking for a fairly easy and highly rated marinade for our petite sirloin steaks. I made this recipe but did not have lemon juice. I use chopped dried onion instead of a fresh, granulated garlic instead of fresh, added Montreal steak seasoning, basil leaves, and to spice it up 1 tbsp red pepper. I mixed it in our Vitamix and it made a thicker marinade. I did one pass with the tenderizer on each side of each steak and then pierced both sides of the steaks so the marinade could seep in to the meet.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe but added a few tbsp of HP Sauce to help cut the soy sauce a bit.  We tried this with Steak, and it turned out really good, so we also tried it on beef ribs.  This is now my husbands new favourite.  Will definitely do this again.

This is the only steak marinade I use!  After trying 4 or 5 others, this one is the winner.  The meat is so savory and tender with this.  I love it when you can eat the steak without adding anything to it (because I hate steak sauce).

I love using this marinade! I usually buy a large flatiron steak. A large flatiron steak can easily feed 2 people, making a pretty cheap steak dinner.  My favorite part of this recipe is the onions. I wrap the onions in foil and throw them on the grill and serve them on top of the steak. Delicious!

I've use this recipe for about 10 years now and it still gets me every time. This marinade plus my husband's grilling skills… That first  bite is pure heaven. No A1 needed here! The only thing I change is to use less oil.  While the steaks are  on the grill, I boil down the remaining marinade with the raw onions  to serve with dinner.   It makes a great sauce to go with mashed potatoes or baked potatoes too.  Happy grilling season everybody!

Excellent marinade.  After putting the marinated steaks on the grill, I threw the onions from the marinade  in a pan and grilled  until translucent. I then added mushrooms and continued grilling until the mushrooms were tender.  Made for a great sauce for the steaks. I will definitely make this again.

Hey this recipe was really good!we have a family marinade recipe that we always make but I just wanted to try something different and my brothers and dad liked it! it turn out all right even tho they all caught on fire on the grill lol! charcoal is good for you right! haha. no a lot of them were still fine.

This marinade is fantastic.    I added a bit more garlic and (although may sound strange) substituted the vegetable oil with coconut oil that my wife had picked up.    I was worried about the flavor of coconut and a good cut of steak...weird right?! But wow, it was awesome.   The oil flavor comes out in it for sure, but not overpowering.    Was definitely the best marinated steak I have ever made.    We made it with thick top sirloin (don't usually marinade those). But will be doing it again soon.    Might try it with a flank or in/out side round too.    Do it! Try the coconut oil!   I was so worried when we made it, but it was outstanding!

Great marinade.  Used on NY steaks and truly enjoyed.  I, also, combined the ingredients in a gallon zip lock bag and did not marinate very long (approximately 10 minutes).  Will use this recipe again.

I made this with a london broil cut and I let it marinate for 3 hours in a zip-lock bag. I halved the recipe and used low sodium soy sauce. Great recipe !

Fantastic!!  I agree with other reviewers who said to scale it.  The current amount is for 20 servings, I scaled to 6 and it was plenty for 1lb of steak.  Very, very tasty!!

Pretty good marinade.  I grilled the onions along with the steaks.  I liked the onions better than the steak (5 stars for the onions).  I scaled it down to 6 servings for 2 fillets and it was the perfect amount.  I actually estimated the amount of the ingredients rather than measuring and it worked fine.

It was ok. Not as wonderful as the reviews suggest. I'll be trying a dry rub next. This one tasted like soy sauce, which is good if you are really into soy sauce I guess.

Fantastic!  Made many times!!
Made per recipe, but used low sodium soy sauce Great!
And then varied amounts due to what was in the pantry - still great - just a fantastic base recipe - marinated mushrooms in it put them on skewers and then basted them and tenderloin steaks on the grill with it - Wonderful!

I added only a couple tbsp of Red Wine Vinegar, then finished off with 1/2 cup of Balsamic Vinegar, added fresh basil and one package of Good Seasons Italian dry salad mix.

It made an excellent salad dressing.

Now my automatic go-to for steak!  Everyone loves it.  Very nicely balanced.  Makes ordinary choice-grade meat for the grocery taste like steak-house fare.

Almost made it to 5 stars, but too much soy sauce in the original recipe...cut it back to 2 tbsps. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added 2 tbsps A1. Otherwise it is amazing. Also if you slice the onion big enough you can add these to the grill when you are done with the marinade and they are amazing as well!

This has become my go-to marinade for any kind of beef.  I always reserve some of the marinade to use as a steak sauce also.  It has a wonderful fresh flavor which complements the meat without overpowering it.  Thanks!

My husband and I both agree that this is The Best Steak Marinade! I used top Sirloin and we cooked them to medium rare on the BBQ. I used reduced sodium soy sauce instead and added a teaspoon of honey and some extra garlic. They were soooo flavourful and tender. No need to eat out at a Steakhouse anymore, this steak is better. :) Thanks for sharing this Amazing recipe!

BBQ strips of sirloin were delicious.  Tender and
juicy.  Taste of marinade was prevalent but did not overpower the meat.  
I put the marinated slices of (Vidalia) onion on foil and bbq'd them along with the steak strips.  
very tasty.

This was absolutely delicious! Bought cheap steak and this marinade made it taste like I was dining at a steakhouse! Yummmmm! Made no changes to the recipe. Served it with sauted mushrooms (butter, onions, garlic, shrooms) and Bobby Flays grilled corn off the cob a sauted with lime, butter, peppers.

This makes the best steaks! We had New York Strips from our local market and cooked them on a charcoal grill. I added only a minced jalapeno pepper and used half the soy sauce with a low sodium variety. Awesome flavor. Great!

Nice flavor...used on tough steak tonight and it helped and trying on pork chops tomorrow! Didn't make in the volume as listed and kind of add-libbed and it was good! Thanks!

This is very good. I halved the onion, however, and was confused when the oil chilled out on top of the mix, but all in all, it did well to marinade my steak. Less oil I think, next time, but it's five stars as is!

I have to say this was the best steak marinade I have ever tasted and my husband would agree.  It made the meat so tender and the taste was amazing.  Would definitely recommend it to others.

I wasn't really impressed but I didn't have the time to let it marinate as long as it needed and I had to sub cider vinegar for the red wine.

This was an EXCELLENT marinade.  I substituted red wine for the vinegar and added a bit more (perhaps up to 1/2 cup).   I also added some fresh rosemary springs from my garden.  The steaks were so tender and succulent!

Very good, did not overpower or change the beef flavor.  Sometimes all you taste is the marinade, this just enhanced the steak.  My husband prefers his steak "plain"  but I talked him into letting me marinade his too.  He was impressed and said this recipe was a keeper.

good marinade. i normaly do a dry rub so i can achieve better grill marks but i desided to try a wet marinate because i had a few steaks from the reduced bin. so they needed a lot of doctoring. only things i substituted were freeze dried onions insted of fresh and i used a mesquite and jalapeno dijion mustard to give it a little kick

Thank you Gderr for recommending this marinade. All I did was mix and pour over the meat and cover and let it sit in the fridge until I was ready to broil it. I used a cheap cut of meat (we really splurged on steak, we don't have it often) but you couldn't tell. This needs a little somethin'-somethin'. Can't put my finger on it. As is, it's a decent marinade for even the cheapest cut of meat.

I have used this marinade for over a year and it makes every cut of steak juicy and flavorful- I usually get the Delmonico Ribeye steaks, they have more marbling and are very tender cuts.  But this works with flat iron, strip steaks, etc.  A great go to marinade!

Excellent marinade! I have never been very good at cooking steaks - no matter the cut, they always came out dry and overdone. I used this recipe, put the steak in a sealed ziplock bag for ~8 hours and actually broiled it in the oven ~6" from the broiler for 10 min. per side, then let it 'rest' for 5 min. - which produced a wonderful medium-well, juicy, flavorful steak.

We had steak at the Keg a few weeks ago. We enjoyed our steak done in this marinade alot more. I would highly recommend this for any grade of steak. I marinaded for almost 4 hours. Perfect! We will keep this as our #1 marinade. Thanks for the recipe Jessie!

Great marinade!! My husband is a huge steak fan and now insists that we use this marinade everytime we have steak. Great taste and no added spice needed when grilling!

This was excellent.  I marinated New York strips for less than 2 hours - in a vacuum sealed bag - and the flavor was rich, the meat juicy, and very tender.

This was yummy stuff. I only added half the oil and soy sauce. The oil seemed a little excessive and I didn't want it to be too salty from the soy. We enjoyed this very much =))

I had tried the brown sugar beer marinade from the site the week prior and wasn't impressed.  But this marinade was absolutely outstanding!  I cut the oil to about 2 tbsp. and added 1/2 c. water to make sure it wasn't too strong (also used low sodium soy sauce), and skipped the onion because one guest was allergic.  I marinated about 20 hours overnight after poking both sides of the steak with a fork, and I could not be happier with the flavor (same with my guests!).  I used 1 inch london broil cuts, and even the meat that was medium well was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife.  I'll be using this again.

This was just OK for me.  It didn't really add anything flavourwise.  Given the other reviews, I was really expecting my steaks to be bursting with flavour.

I had high hopes for this one.  It definitely wasn't bad, but not as flavorful as I was expecting given the ingredients, such as fresh garlic and onion.  I marinated a london broil for 9 hours in this marinade, and it was just "ok".  Not terrible, but I probably would try another marinade next time.

Pretty Blah..Cut oil by 2/3, add some 7 up(bubbley sugar), and tiger sauce. Now that's a marinade. Best on tri tip or top sirloin not a ribeye or New york.

I thought it was pretty good.  Nothing special though.  I marinated the steak originally for fondue night, and then cooked up the leftovers the next day for a steak sandwich.  The sandwich was better then the fondue, I give the marinade credit there, because I tossed the remaining marinade in the skillet while cooking the steak up.  I added the steak sauce as others suggested, which made it taste more like steak sauce then anything.  I would use it again though for a steak sandwich dinner, as that was really quite tasty.

This just didn't work for us.  Although it smelled and tasted good before I added the meat, it did not penetrate the meat at all.  There was barely if any flavor after grilled.  We marinated a flank steak for 10 hours which you would think would be long enough for some flavor.  Maybe I'll try it on chicken and write an update b/c the marinade alone did taste good.

I would probably give this 5 stars but after marinading them for hours my dad took them and grilled them on the BBQ....so they were too charred and BBQ tasting to even taste the marinade...I will try this again and broil them though, bc it seems like an awesome marinade!

I was very skeptical of the vinegar since we don't really care for it in anything normally but I am glad I took the risk. This marinade made an already tender ribeye melt in our mouths.

Delicious marinade.  I didn't have lemon juice, but the marinade was still one of the best I have tried.  We marinated rib eye steak and vegetables.  My husband wished we had extra marinade to use as a sauce.

This was really good. I used half vegetable oil and half olive oil.  I also added 4 tablespoons of brown sugar and about 1/4 cup of bbq sauce, and used only 1/8 cup lemon juice.  I let it marinate over night in a big ziploc bag.  Everyone in the family enjoyed it.

Exceptional. I used low-sodium soy sauce and ended up salting the steaks slightly near the end of grilling. They were perfect. I marinaded the steaks overnight and the extra marinading time is definitely worth the advance planning. Change it if you must to put your own mark on it, but there is no need. It's just right. Everybody at my house loved it.

I got a little worried reading comments about "too sour" or "too much soy sauce", so I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. Whether that made a difference or not, I don't know. I also used light soy sauce, so it wasn't salty. The end result was superb.

This marinade was exceptional. I substituted A-1 for the Worcestershire and marinaded my ribeyes for approximately 7 hours. I complemented the steaks with a well aged Chateau LeBlanc Chilean Malbec. Thanks for this recipe!

Will definitely use again. I scaled it down for only 2 steaks and used olive oil instead of veg oil.  Hubby loved it but said it needs more pepper.

This was ok.  A little to peppery. Will try to marinade a little longer next time, maybe it will soak up more flavor.

We loved this marinade.  I used a little yellow mustard instead of Dijon (that's what I had on hand) and it turned out great.

Used on some Strip steaks-poked steaks with fork and marinated in frig for about 3-4 hours.  Flavor was great, next time will marinate for longer time.  I'm sure the onions would've been great, too, if husband hadn't forgot them on the grill :)  Will definitely use again!

one word---EXCELLENT!  We also used olive oil vs. canola oil as others suggested and then followed the recipe to the 't'.  We actually had NY strip steak and marinated this for 9 hours.  We topped it over with a little blue cheese crumbles and smothered onions and bon appetite!!!  Thank you!

OK, not great. I guess I had too high expectations. I couldn't get to my usual butcher where I get very good quality steaks that don't need much marinade or extra flavoring, so I got a less expensive supermarket NY strip. It was marinated for 8 hours or so and the flavors seemed a little run together.

We have made this a few times now, and really enjoy it. We didn't have more than a few hours the last time, so I poked the steak with a fork and put it in a ziplock with the marinade, it still had a nice flavor. I have used both dijon mustard and regular when out of dijon-and I think it still came out great.

this is a good starter recipe--I add a tablespoon of steak sauce and 1/4 cup of beer,and sometimes I add a tablespoon of bbq sauce. I let it marinade for three or four hours.

Fantastic marinade. I made it exactly as is, except I used a mixture of red wine and white vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar, since I didn't have any.  Even so, the steaks (a fairly cheap cut) came out tender and had a very nice tang to them, but weren't overly seasoned.  I'll definitely use this one again.

I just tried this marinade tonight, and was very impressed!I cut the oil in half and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic, and low sodium soy. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Awesome! Excellent! Best marinade for steak. Leftover's were still so tasty the next day. Moist and tender, yum yum! It's all I will use now.

Awesome marinade for our ribeyes that we cooked on the grill. I didn't change a single ingredient. I only marinated them for about an hour and a half, next time I plan to try it overnight to see how they come out. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I halved this recipes as I was only marinading 2 steaks, and that made more then enough.  Make sure you marinade them for AT LEAST 6 hours but I recommend longer as I could hardly taste the marinade.  Probably overnight is best.

This was GREAT!  Although I used it for a cheaper cut of meat, it was a big hit.

Made this last night with steaks for company.  My brother-in-law (not one to hand out compliments) said it was the best steak he's ever had.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Excellent!

YUM! Amazing flavor. I had some filet mignon that was a few days old and I decided to marinate just to be safe. Because it was filet I only marinated for 2 hours. We grilled them over charcoal. This is a new favorite.

Excelent marinade.  10 servings to 2 steaks is plenty.  I also substituted shallots for the onion.  Will definitly use again.
