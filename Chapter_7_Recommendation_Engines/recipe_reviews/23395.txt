I wish this recipe had a face so I could punch it.  I was in a rush, so I only read the first two reviews, neither of which mentioned the salty issue.  And while my baker's instinct said that there was too much salt and baking soda in the recipe, I followed it anyways.  These were so salty. If I wasn't fortunate enough to have some leftover vegan orange/cream cheese frosting in the refrigerator, they would have been inedible.  A shame too, because the muffins would have been delicious if I had followed my instinct and not the recipe.  How anyone who follows this recipe exactly can give it a positive review is beyond me.  I give it a two because there's a lot of potential here.

5 stars for the concept, that is for sure.  The carrot and apple mixture are great together!  1 star lost due to the needed tweaking.  I only used 1 tsp of baking soda, and 3/4 tsp of salt - otherwise we would have tasted nothing but those two ingredients!
Also, I omit the oil to cut fat, and replaced it with two small mashed bananas.  These muffins turned out fabulously!  Thanks so much for the recipe. :)

This muffin recipe is definately a keeper- however, I changed the cooking time to 400 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes since the batter is so dense. Yet, everytime I have made these quick breads, I am quick to notice the taste of either the baking soda or baking powder; I am in the process in trying to eliminate this. I also use three bananas as my egg substitute which seems to work just fine. My advice, use the recipe as a guide and let the creative take over the rest.

I work for program that provides healthy snacks to students in elemantary school. These muffins worked great! I decreased the salt and used 3 mashed bananas instead of the eagg replacer. The kids love these. I made them into mini muffins and was able to get about 72.

Thanks for this great recipe. I love the muffins and they are the perfect snack for my todders, who can't have dairy or eggs right now! The only changes I made was to use 1 c. of whole wheat flour and 1.5 c. of white flour. I cut the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. as other reviews said they found them to be salty and I cooked them at 400 degrees for 20 min. I will be making these often!!

For a good for you muffin that still tastes good this recipe is great.  I did cut the salt down by half, add a little more applesauce and a little less oil, and replace 1/2 cup flour with whole wheat flour. They turned out great and very moist.  Also an easy way to sneak in some fruit and veggies for my 3 year old.  I will be making these again.

This is one of the best muffin recipies I have ever made! And the best part is that it's vegan! They are moist and delicious. I made smaller muffins so I got 24 instead of 12.

Five star, but I made many adjustments:  Half whole wheat flour and half white, omitted the white sugar and used 1 cup raw sugar, 3 tsp soda and 3 tsp powder, half the cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp sea salt, no egg replacer, 2 medium bananas, 1 cup unsweetened applecauce, 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup water (all else the same).  Lastly, if you use organic apples, you can grate them with the peel on (they do get soft).  350 for 25 minutes was perfect - they were fantabulous!  This makes two dozen.

These didn't work for me.  They were very heavy too mushy for muffins.  My kids wouldn't touch them and they usually like anything in muffin form.

These muffins are delicious!! This was the first time for me baking vegan style and my whole family and I loved the recipe! First looking at it though it seemed that it was going to make a lot more than just one dozen muffins so I split all the ingredients in half and then it made about one dozen. All of the kids loved these muffins and begged me to make them again soon!

The final product turned out to be a 4.5 star muffin, but a lot of changes had to be made, so I'm knocking this recipe as written down to 3. Otherwise, it's a great starting point.
1) The sweetness was too much. I had 1 cup brown+1/4 cup white, but this could probably be reduced to just 1 cup brown (all the apple and applesauce already provides sweetness, as well as banana-see below)... 
2) I didn't want to use up 9 tsp my egg replacer, so 3 mashed bananas substituted just fine (which also provides sweetness)...
3) Like many reviewers said, the baking soda and salt was too much, 1 tsp baking soda and 3/4 tsp salt should be enough)... 
4) I used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. This made it healthier and I couldn't tell any difference...
5) Finally, because the batter is wet and dense, put it in for 400 ÂºF for 35 minutes.

I have made this 4 or 5 times as a vegan option for fellowship at church.  Everyone loves them!  They are always gone before the doughnuts.

I also tweaked this recipe. I omitted the white sugar, 1 tsp of sea salt, used 1tbsp of flax meal with 3 tbsp of water to sub for the egg replacer/egg, and 1tsp of vanilla extract. I was gooey at first right out of the oven, but after cooling down on the rack, it was soft and moist.  Next time i'll try adding nuts for texture.

Excellent Yummy Muffins. My son is allergic to eggs, milk and peanuts so I was trying to find a recipe for some carrot muffins and came across this one. I made a few changes below and it turned out amazing.

Here are my changes...
I cut back on the sugar and only used a 1 cup of brown. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and then 1 and a half of all purpose flour. I only used 1.5 teaspoons of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of salt. I didn't have any egg replacer so I used 3 mashed banana's in place of it. I also made mini muffins because they were for my toddlers. I fiddled with the timing and found that they were best at 375 for approximately 25-30 minutes. They seemed a little gooey when I first took them out which I am assuming is because of all the banana but after I let them sit they were amazing. I put them in the fridge over night and just had my sons begging for more. So yummy...more sugar then I would want but at least I was able to sneak in some carrots, bananas and apple :)

This is a great base recipe. I got creative and these turned out SUPER delicious! I used: only 1 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp of salt, 2 c. whole wheat flour & 1/2 c. rolled oats, only 3 real eggs, 1 mashed banana & 1c. fat-free plain yogurt instead of the applesauce, and I added a tsp of ground ginger for good measure. Oh and sunflower seeds on top for a little crunch :) yum... these will be a breakfast staple!

They turned out delicious and moist! I did put a little less soda and baking powder and way less salt. I always do that. I used real eggs but next time will try a substitute (flax or chia seeds - i don't really want to use chemical egg replacement, however its always an option.) Also I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 c of raisins (soaked them in hot water to make them soft). I think as a baker you can always be creative - all depends on what you're trying to make. Thanks for the recipe !!!

Delicious!!  I'm not a big measurer, but I did tweak the recipe toward what I wanted.  I used all the same basic dry ingredients (incidentally it was NOT salty at all baked with my alterations for whatever reason) except 1.5 c whole wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached enriched flour (rather than the all-purpose), an extra tsp of cinnamon, a total of 5 med carrots, one apple, and one zucchini, and two eggs (rather than the egg substitute because I'm not vegan).  

Sooooooooo moist and wonderful and I don't feel guilty eating them!

These were fantastic! I did reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. and the baking soda to 1 tsp.  I also raised the oven temp to 400 and baked 20 minutes because I was afraid they would be too gooey from all the moisture in the apples and carrots. Also, I used corn starch instead of egg replacer. They turned out moist and delicious. I think next time I'm going to try them with all whole wheat flour and agave nectar in place of the white sugar.

This is a really quick, easy and tasty muffin recipe -- and I just happened to have egg replacer!  None of my muffin batches have ever baked well until this recipe.  Thanks to Krista B for providing a great vegan recipe!

LOVE this recipe. My kids have egg allergies and its great to find a delicious recipe that is also good for them.  I substitute 1c whole wheat flour, added some ground flax seed and some wheat bran.  But these rise quite nice and are super moist compared to my failed attempts at baking egg free.

SO delicious! You would never know they were full of healthy ingredients. I made only a couple of minor changes. As other reviewers did, I decreased the amount of baking soda and salt. I also used real eggs instead of the substitute. And I added some raisins. I definitely plan to make these often. They will be a great afternoon snack.

Super nummy.  I threw the carrots, apples, applesauce, oil, and egg substitute in the blender.  The muffins were super moist, and huge.  I have kids they ate them up.

Pretty good muffin, but the contents stuck to the muffin paper cup.  Not sure why - maybe w/my subsitutions it altered how it baked.  I took others' suggestions - I changed the measurements of the baking soda & powder, changed the temp to 400.  I didn't have the egg substitute so I used 4 eggs and one very ripe banana.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half regular.  I'll bake this one again, but make the recipe in half b/c it made 2 dozen muffins.

Wow, these are super yummy, kind of like little carrot cakes without all the fat, calories, and cholesterol :)  
Based on other reviewers' suggestions I decreased the baking soda to 3 1/2 tsp and the salt to 1 3/4 tsp.  I increased the baking powder to about 1 3/4 tsp and added 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  I was able to make about 22 muffins using 1/2 cup of mix for each.  Now I just have to find someone to help me eat all of these tasty little gems!

I was pleased with the outcome of this recipe in general although I thought they were a little too salty tasting- maybe cut back on the baking soda or salt next time.  I also made a coulple of alterations:I cooked at 400 instead of 375, I used 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup almond meal instead of the 2.5 cups flour and also I added some walnuts and dehydrated berry mix from Trader Joes (dehydrated cranberry,cherry,blueberry and golden raisins.) They came out very yummy!

Great Tasting, moist vegan muffins!!  What a great, healthy snack for my toddler.  Recipe works well, just turn up the heat to 400, for 20-25 mins. so that they aren't mushy.  We'll be making again!

I've made this several times now and love it!!!I followed others suggestions, omitted the oil for mashed banana and changed to 1 teaspoon soda and 3/4 salt. Also I added 1 tbls chia seeds(added to apple sauce for a few minutes before mixing to "gel"),1 tbls ground flax seed and 1/4 cup walnuts.I also added a sprinkle of ginger, allspice, and nutmeg. I have made it with and without the white sugar. I think with the banana you can cut out that sugar and not miss it at all. Thanks for the recipe this is so good!

Very tasty and so moist. I made these gluten free also using Betty Crocker's gf rice flour blend. You have to cook them longer because for some reason gf baked goods take longer to bake. They are really moist and shredding the carrots and apples was easy with my cuisinart. The only problem I had was they stuck to the muffin papers and I'm not quite sure how to avoid this next time. I doubled the batch for and the second round I cooked them 7 minutes longer and sprayed the papers with oil but had the same result. Maybe omit the papers and just grease the pan as the instructions suggest. Totally worth a remake though; these are the best muffins I've ever made!

So so so so good!  Having read other reviews, I followed with similar suggestions of substituting some wheat flour for the white (about 1.5 wheat, 1 white), reducing the salt to 1 tsp., and substituting one mashed banana for the 1/4 cup of oil.  And because all I had were baby carrots which were a nightmare to shred, I substituted 2 cups of shredded squash for the 2 cups of shredded carrots.  I then cooked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  Moist and delicious!!!!

After adjustments to this recipe these muffins were so good. I used (instead) 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 3/4 of salt. And for the egg replacer I used 3 smashed bananas. I am definitely going to make these again.

We made these and altered them just a bit.  We added 4 tablespoons of whey powder for added protein and cut the oil in half and added a little more applesauce.  We baked a few with walnuts.  This is a delicious muffin and we'll save the recipe in our treasured recipe binder!

I have to give this recipe four stars because I also changed up the baking soda/salt amounts. I used only 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt. I also used one large banana instead of the oil. With these changes these muffins turned out great! They had a good spicy flavor to them and were very moist. My husband and I have been eating them for breakfast, snacks, and dessert all week long!

Tasty little muffin.  I too cut the salt by half and replaced 1c of the flour with whole wheat flour.  I made mini-muffins instead of the regular size so they would be better for snacking.  My only complaint would be that they were a little too moist and fell apart a little as a result.  Overall yummy.

These are wonderful! My mother was a little worried that they were too liquidy, but they turned out nicely. I did not use the whole 2tsp for salt, more like 1 1/2 tsp. I did not use egg replacer, but with 6 eggs it turned out well. I can see using the egg replacer for my vegan friends.

Great for my too skinny kids!  I used the 6 eggs instead of the egg replacer b/c my kids need the fat.  I also subbed 1/2 cup flour w/almond meal.  They really liked these and they are p-i-c-k-y!

Just made theese and they are pretty good. I made a few changes to suite me. After the carrots & apple were grated and added 3 t. sugar mixed together and let sit to draw out the water, squeezed them dry and then added to the flour mix. I also used 6 real eggs, the applesauce and oil but had to up the flour content to 4 c. With these changes the batch made 2 dozen. Very good warmed and split with butter.

pretty good all round.  bit too sweet but that was my fault as i used 3 really ripe bananas instead of egg.  i used 1 cup of wholemeal flour in place of just plain flour.  i also cut the salt in half and the baking soda down to 3tsp.  cooked for 20 mins at 400F. all this based on other reviews.  i managed to make 18 with my batch and my vegan sister gave them a big thumbs up. cheers guys.

These were great. Moist, but with a healthy dose of flavour and certainly didn't taste outdoorsy.

I made them with real eggs and used the 1.5 tsp of salt and 3tsp of baking soda suggestion and baked for 25mins at 400F. They made 16 in total. Very moist, almost sticky, but delicious. 

If you're getting bored hand grating carrots, try them in your blender, it should work just fine. Same for the apples. 

I think it really needs a lemon icing to carry that carrot flavour. Maybe next time.

Finally, a good recipe using egg replacer! This is a really good recipe. My 3-year-old loves these muffins. I followed the recipe to the letter, but next time I'll try using 1/2 whole wheat flour for a slighly healthier option. My muffins overflowed the cups, so watch out! I used Ener-G brand egg replacer. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first attempt at vegan baking and I am so excited, they turned out Wonderful!!  I added some pecans and walnuts and that is a great addition.  Next time I might cut the sugar back a bit, also I got 16 muffins out of this recipe and not 12.

I substituted Egg-Beaters for the egg replacer, maybe this was too much liquid? The recipe made twice as many muffins, they had good flavor but bad texture. They were sponge-y, almost rubbery. I fed them to the birds, but they wouldn't eat them. I like the flavor combination, but will look for a similar "conventional" recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and I think theyâre fabulous! Made 24 muffins with the serving size set to 12... Iâm assuming that the serving is two muffins. From the reviews I see that some donât like the salt amount but I like the balance between salt and sweet so it works for me! Definitely a great vegan muffin!

Moist and delicious! Upon other reviews, I used 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt. Perfect!!  Used all the batter to make my 12 muffins, filled to the top of cup, and they baked up big and beautiful.

These muffins are a family staple! I have never personally tried them but everyone in the family loves them. The concept on these muffins is amazing, the recipe just needed some tweaking. There was way too much salt and baking soda in this recipe and that would be all we tasted, so I cut down the baking soda to 2tsp, and the salt to 1tsp and the recipe still worked fine. The muffins stuck to the muffin wrapper so I just spray a little cooking oil in to make sure that they aren't as sticky. I also found that they didn't need the full 20 minutes, and they were fine with just 16 or 17 minutes, just stick a toothpick in the centre to make sure they are ready and if the toothpick comes out clean, then you're good. Overall, these muffins are great and will be made many times from now.

When I was making this recipe I thought it called for a lot of salt, but I went against my gut and followed through anyways. Literally all I tasted was salt. AWFUL recipe. My kitchen smells like a salted pretzel now. I had to throw them away do to them being so inedible. I now have to deal with a very grumpy son who has been looking forward to muffins!! Very unhappy.

I made this with 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour & 1 cup all purpose flour, 2 t baking soda instead of 4 t, and 3/4 tsp salt. It made 12 small (not mini) muffins & filled about half a 9 X 5 loaf pan. It took maybe 35 mins to cook, with all of that in the oven.

I found that the loaf turned out a lot tastier than the muffins (in our opinion), so I'll probably just do the loaf  next time.

Thanks for the recipe!

We just discovered that my grandson is allergic to nuts, coconut, eggs and gluten. This was my first attempt at egg-free baking . . . I read all the reviews and decided to implement others' successful ideas. I used gluten-free flour, 1 cup organic sugar, 1T. flax seed, Granny Smith apples,  squeeze of honey, 3 very ripe bananas instead of egg substitute, melted butter instead of vegetable oil and a handful of raisins. I sprinkled a bit of sugar/cinnamon on mine prior to baking. Surprisingly, the taste and texture were great!

Delicious, very moist so I might tweak things a bit next time. Only did a few pinches of salt and I used ground flax seed instead of Egg Replacer.

These were pretty good. Made them for people who don't like things too sweet and it was a hit!

I made these muffins following the recipe exactly and they were moist, flavorful, and delicious!  Not salty or tasting of baking soda like some reviewers are mentioning.

YUM! 
Except, like other reviewers have noted, I had to make some exceptions. The main difference was that I used chia seeds as the egg replacer. I used 2 tablespoons. Also I only used one cup of brown sugar (skipped the white). I used white whole wheat flour. I only included 1 tsp of baking soda and 3/4 tsp of salt, as recommended by other reviewers. 
Super good, we already chowed down on three each, and can't wait to eat more!!

This recipe was delicious! I used many of the modifications suggested and they turned out great: 1 tsp of baking powder, 1.5 tsp baking soda, 2 bananas and 1/2 cup of water instead of egg replacer, and 1 cup of applesauce + 1/2 cup of canola oil. And I added vanilla for good measure!

They turned out to be quite gigantic and very much delicious! I put 1 cup of honey instead of the white sugar so it's a little healthier, thanks for the recipe!

I love these muffins! I use this recipe as a base for other vegan muffins-- My favorite combination so far is strawberry banana! I always add an extra touch of brown sugar, too.

This is my new favorite recipe. My kids loved it. I ofcourse followed the needed tweeking, less baking soda and salt. I also omitted the oil, but next time I won't because the muffins stuck to the muffic cups. I used liquide egg substitute and added chopped walnuts. I used medium muffin cups, it made 36 muffins.

This recipe was wonderful.  I did turn up the heat to 400 and cook them for 20 to 25 mins, as suggested.  My sons playgroup ate them all up.
