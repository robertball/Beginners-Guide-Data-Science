I wanted to love this recipe, but it was the first treat I made in my ice cream maker that didn't turn out.  I've never had this problem before.  After a spin through the ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's directions (30 min.), it was just as soupy as when it was poured in.  So I transferred it to a stainless steel bowl and decided I would put it in the freezer and stir it periodically, adding the nuts and chocolate bits when thick enough.  After a few hours, no change.  When I was getting ready for bed, I checked one last time for the night and it had some ice crystals so I added the nuts and chocolate bits.  The next morning, it was finally in a better state.  The thing is, the texture was very crystal-y and it melted VERY quickly once served.  It's too bad because the flavors are fantastic, but the crystal-y texture and time to solidify just stink.  Not worth making again.  What a shame.

Häägen Dazs eat your heart out!  This recipe is absolutely fantastic!!!!  My hubby doesn't like "busy" Icecream, but he can't get enough of this one!  I bought an Icecream maker 2 weeks ago and have made this deliciousness 3 times already!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Wouldn't change a thing!  I highly recommend this easy and scrumptious recipe!  Thanks DogsboroDave!

This was delicious! I made this for an ice cream social and won first prize with this recipe. I didn't have espresso so I used strong, brewed coffee. This recipe doubled is perfect for a 4 quart ice cream maker.

Made the recipe; liked the flavor, although it could use more of an espresso flavor.  Will increase it by adding some espresso powder to it, when next I make it again.

We made no changes and absolutely loved it! We had it for a birthday and then only a few weeks later when the next birthday came along it was requested again. Yum, yum!

Will definitely make again. Substituted half & half for milk and cream (had lots to get rid of). Added the extra shot of espresso suggested by OP (like lots of coffee flavor) reduced sugar by 1/3 and mixed 2 Tbsp cocoa powder in the sugar (like my chocolate dark) and I still would have liked more flavor.

Heavy cream would probably have helped a lot (ours was a little icy) and I might try heating the cocoa in a little melted butter first. This is a great base to experiment from.

This was my 1st attempt and it turned out really good! I mixed it in my KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker for 20 minutes and it thickened up and filled it up to the brim. I scooped it out and put them in dishes that went straight into the freezer...to enjoy tonight. :)

Oh...I did not add the almonds nor the chocolate pieces for my 1st attempt. My husband isn't fond of "things" in his ice cream. But I anticipate adding some dark chocolate slices in it for me another time. :)

It was to sweet for my family. I used less sugar and instant coffee the second time and it was good.

I made two changes: I used dark chocolate syrup and plain almonds since I could not find cocoa roasted almonds in our local stores. This recipe is terrific. When ice cream socials season comes around, this is what I'm requested to bring.
