This was a great recipe!  My husband was really surprised.  I cut down the red pepper to about 1/8 tsp and used the "milder" Ro-tel tomatoes.  Tht was plenty of spice for us - any more and we would not have been able to taste the fish!

This was excellent!! I would however, leave off the cayenne pepper next time. The can of tomatoes and green chilies would be plenty of peppers. My husband and I loved it and even though we both like spicy food agreed that it was a little too peppery.

This dish turned out quite good, i served it over steamed rice, which was a nice absorbant for the spiciness of the fish. I used the indicated amount of spices per each medium size catfish filet, which made it quite spicy & flavorful indeed. Perhaps sprinkled on would make it a little milder.

Yummy! Ok I put a lil "spin" on this. I noticed in the comments it says that this is a " dish with a cream sauce". Not sure if anybody else caught that or not. So what I did was baked the fish with seasonings as per directions. In a skillet added the tomatoes and green chilies. Cooked the juices down a bit. THEN I added some heavy cream and cooked til it got really thick. I also also added one pack of Splenda. After the fish was done I simply topped and served. YUMMY!! I imagine it would be good for chicken too.

This was excellent, although it took a lot longer to bake than the recipe said.  I was out of cayenne pepper and was worried that this would be bland without it, but it wasn't.  It had a lot of different flavors going on that mixed well together.  It was easy to prepare, too.  This is definitely something I would make again.

This was so easy and flavorful.  I don't really like the fishy flavor of catfish, so I tried it with orange roughy, but my favorite (by far) is the tilapia.  This tastes like something from my favorite seafood restaurant.  An easy yet elegant dish to impress your guests with!

Very good baked catfish recipe.  As much as we like spicy food though, this one was a little too spicy for our taste.  (Too spicy = cannot eat without watery eyes & sniffles.)  I'll do one of two things next time to remedy this: use less cayenne pepper or use the mild Rotel tomatoes.  Definitely serve this over steamed white rice & have a Corona or two to wash it down with.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe! It turns boring catfish into a delicious meal! I used cut the amount of cayenne pepper, dill, and thyme in half, but kept the rest of the spices the same. It was perfect! Also, I didn't need all of the butter... next time I'd say only 3 tbsp. for 4 fillets. still, this recipe is a winner! It's great if you serve it with noodles or rice to balance out the spiciness.

This turned out pretty well. The ingredients for coating the filets did not stretch far enough so I will use more of them next time. My family and I liked it and I will make it again

I was really skeptical about this recipe, but I was very pleased with the end result.  I more than doubled the spices plus added a few of my own as well as a few tsp of flour, but the end result was fabulous.

Easy and very good.  I skipped the butter (sprayed with Pam instead), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My husband commented that it didn't taste "fishy".

I was looking for a new way to cook catfish besides my usual frying with Cajun Seasoning and this was delicious!  The mix of herbs and spices is very flavorful and we enjoyed a new catfish recipe, a fish we both enjoy.  I did make slight modifications to cut down on 1) saturated fat - used olive oil in place of margarine, and 2) salt - used no-salt diced tomatoes and added 1 tablespoon canned diced green chilies.  I also cut the cayenne pepper in half to fit our tastes.  
I was in a hurry so to speed up cooking I mixed all ingredients except the fish and olive oil in a saucepan and simmered them together while I pan fried the catfish, approx. four minutes a side.  I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of Cajun Seasoning.  Then I served the fish with the sauce on top.  I think the flavors remained true to the recipe and I was able to have this ready to eat in 15 minutes. I also love that except for the fish all the ingredients are ones you would have in the pantry so no special shopping needed.

Super easy and very tasty! I simply drizzled the fish with olicve oil then sprinkled the seasonings on top. I served it with rice and beans, and ended up having the leftovers in flour tortillas. Good stuff! Thanks, Nick!

Few changes: sea salt instead of regular salt, butter instead of margarine, and I put the canned tomatoes beneath the catfish.  Instead of 40 minutes it cooked in 30 minutes and cooked off some of the liquid from the tomatoes.  It tasted great, a little heavy on the spices so next time I'll reduce so we can actually taste the fish.  By the way, if you don't like fishy fish, make sure you buy fresh fish that doesn't smell.  If it does, then it's old.

I love this recipe!!! It is the best catfish     that I have made on my own. I really like spicy food so the heat didnt bother me. I have tried the exact recipe and a variation and they were both great!! The way I made the variation was instead of all the different spices I only used cajun spice mix and cayenne pepper, and instead of canned tomatoes and green chillis I used fresh ones. My husband liked the fresh veg one better.I would really recommend this recipe to everyone, especially if you're really not into fish, this is great way to start!!!

My husband is the catfish lover and the more savory or spicy I can make it is best. This was a good recipe and you can tune up or down the heat.

The kiddo and hubby really liked it.  I used pace since I did not have the diced tomatoes and chili peppers.  I sprinkled the seasoning on instead of dipping the fish in because I didn't want to dirty another dish.

I loved this, and would have given it 5 starts,  but I think I would not have liked it if I had used all the cayenne.  I used a scant bit, but added some Old Bay seasoning in its place.  As I did it, it was  spicy and had heat, but wasn't overpowering.

Terrific recipie. I did a lot ofimprovising for items I did not have but was truly amazed at how terrific it turned out. I'll tell you my changes. 1) didn't have dill so I used some juice from a bottle of salad olives. 2) ni thyme so I used some itallian sesoning 3) to big a can of diced tomatoes (I buy the big cans for when I make my spagehetti sauce) so I used cans of tomatoe sauce and added 2 teaspoons of salsa for chips for each 10 oz can used. 4) I opened a can of green chile peppers and added 2 teaspoons of to the tomate sauce mixture.  5) I then cut up some fresh vidallia onion and green peppers and added it to the t sauce mixture. 6) I added some fresh garden green beans that were steamed first then added to the mixture. 7) I added a dash of olive oil for flavor. 8) after following the fish directions I noticed that there really wasn't enough seasoning mixture to cover both sides so I sprinkled the fish with more garlic powder then onion powder, adobo seasoning.  9)  trying to add my own signature I topped it off with some fresh grated cheese.  10) I cooked it to half the recipie time then added the the tomatoe mixture and continued to bake the second half -=- enjoy  - I did

I'm sorry, neither my husband or myself enjoyed this dish at all.  It was easy to prepare, but it didn't seem like there was enough seasoning to coat the fish.  The directions say to put the fish in the seasoning dish; I had to literally take pinches of the seasoning and sprinkle it on the fish to make it last.  And the fish ended up being way, way, way too spicy.  My husband and I enjoy spicy food, and we had to scrape the tomatoes and the spices off the fish to make them edible.  It was like fire in our mouths.  I won't be making this again.

The amount of ingredients was not enough to coat one piece of fish. We ended up using pre-made redfish blackening spice.  The tomatoes on top were a nice.  The cooking time was too long.  I cooked mine for a total of 25 minutes.  It was much easier using a pre-made blackening spice, instead of making this from scratch.

Easy and yummy, and my husband loved it. I was uncertain about the tomatoes, especially after I added them, but he loved the whole dish. I will probably try it again but leave the tomatoes off. I used only 1/4 tsp ceyenne pepper, poured the butter over the dish, and cooked it for less time... maybe 20-25 mins?

A great way to prepare catfish.Serve it with hot potato salad and corn niblets.
 Newfoundlanders usually coat it with flour, and add salt and pepper while frying(good that way too).
