To have a really authentic taste, consider these two notes:  1- Saute one onion untel soft and translucent in the pot then add the liquid with the lentils but, DON'T ADD SALT before the lentils are soft, then continue as per above. 2- Saute the other two onions in a skillet separately until they are DEEP GOLDEN AND CRISPY, the onions will taste sweeter and more interesting this way. Set aside until they are cooler. Garnish the mujaddara with it and enjoy.  For those who felt it was a bit dry, Mujaddara is supposed to be eaten along side a fresh green salad or yogurt.  One more thing, consider a bit of all spice and cinnamon along with the cumin to give it more depth.

My husband is Lebanese and this is a staple in our house.  The kids love it.  I don't prepare using the garlic powder or cumin but sometimes I do add allspice.  We serve this with a yogurt sauce consisting of plain yogurt, crushed garlic and mint.

I thought this recipe was great. It was so economical and such a comfort food. As per other reviews, I added 1 tsp garam masala to the lentils just before I stirred in the rice. I also sprinkled 1/2 tsp cumin seeds and a few dashes of cinnamon onto the onions as they fried / caramelized. Serving this with yogurt was a must. We used greek yogurt, and it was amazing. The tang of the yogurt with the sweetness of the caramelized onions and cinnamon went so well with the hearty lentil and rice mixture. I fried one large yellow onion, and that seemed to be enough. Next time, I will chop the onions instead of slice them into rings because the rings were difficult to incorporate into the lentil rice mixture. I will absolutely make this again. (I also made homemade whole wheat pitas to go with this dish - they were the perfect for this meal. Used a mixture of whole wheat and AP flour, 2:1 for whatever recipe you use.)

I love lentils and rice.  And this is pretty good with a bunch of modifications.  However, it would have been very bland had I not added a bunch of ingredients.  So the rating is for the recipe as written, but this can be made lots better by:
* using a vegetable or chicken stock
* adding the salt after the lentils are cooked, else the lentils will be tough if you add the salt earlier
* adding some onions at the beginning, while the lentils are cooking
* add an extra 1/2C liquid - even on my lowest simmer and with a lid on the pot, this still ran out of liquid before the lentils were cooked.
When its time to add rice, also add:
* extra water (you need 2 cups water for every cup of rice, so if you are going to add 3/4C rice, you should be adding 1 1/2C water, not just 3/4C water).
* add 1 tsp or so of curry powder depending on how hot you like it.
* add 1 tsp of garam masala (or allspice).
* add 1/2 tsp ginger.
At serving time:
* provide greek yogurt or a raita.
* provide sriracha hot pepper sauce.

I didn't use the vegetable oil as it would have added a bunch of unnecessary calories.

A bit bland as the recipe reads, but with a few seasoning changes, it was fantastic!  Here's what I did to make it tasty:

- vegetable stock instead of water
- 3 onions caramelized until dark golden brown
- cumin added to onions instead of lentils to toast
- tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice, 3 cloves added to lentil water
- lots of salt and pepper

My only comment about the recipe is that the proportion of lentils to rice was way off.  One cup of lentils was too much for the amount of rice in the recipe.  I would recommend either increasing the amount of rice and/or decreasing the amount of lentils.  I also added a pinch of curry powder and topped it off with chopped parsley when it was done.

This was great, easy comfort food. Definitely caramelize the onions! So-o-o good! I use broth instead of just water, and as suggested mix a spoonful of the yogurt with parsley or mint as well, into my serving, or eat it on the side with cucumber slices. I took others' suggestions and added or used in place of other spices, garlic powder and powdered ginger, allspice, powdered clove and cinnamon along with cumin. I have also used some sweet curry powder.  This is not particularly spicy so for more flavour you can double the amounts of some of the spices. To avoid getting gas, add 2-3 whole clove (the spice, not the garlic) in cooking water of lentils. Gives nice subtle flavour and helps your digestion! We also like to add French Fried onions on top, along with the caramelized onions. Gives a nice salty crunchiness and texture. My husband added chopped fresh chilis from our garden for heat. So you can personalize this recipe depending on what you have on hand.

I love Lentils and Rice, so I was happy to find this recipe.  I followed it pretty much as written except that I used one cup of rice instead of 3/4 and upped the water added with the rice to one and a half cups.  The rice only took about 10-12 min after reaching the boil to be done too. Also, around here anyway, the arabic restaurants serve it with crispy onions.  To get that, they need to be fried for much longer than 7 - 10 minutes.  Mine took around 40 min on a med-low heat, stirred once in a while to get them to fry evenly.  They look almost burnt by the time they're done, but they're oh so good! I had to make two batches of this because it disappeared so fast.  My 16 month old grandaughter loves it!  And my sister and neice requested the recipe as well, so it will get used a lot.  Thanks for sharing!

With a few alterations, this has become my de-facto side dish for lunch.  

I cut the recipe down to 1/2 cup lentils and 1/3 cup rice, with less garlic and cumin.  I use chicken broth to cook the lentils and add chopped onion at the rice cooking stage.  I divide it up into thirds for lunch, giving me something filling and tasty that's under 200 calories!

My husband is from Lebanon and thinks he can cook better than me (German)! So to proof him wrong I cooked this today while he was at work. I also added allspice and cinnamon and 1 tbl Knorr Delikatess Br√ºhe (vegetable broth granules) while lentils were cooking. I added rice and 1 fried chopped onion. I had to keep adding water to lentils and rice, about 2 cups, to get the right consistency. I didn't add the second tsp of salt, but added 7 spices my husband brought from Lebanon. And do add some sugar to caramelize onions. Overall I love this recipe, kids and husband did too!

Came out great but a little too salty. I added a little allspice and  I would highly recommend sauteing the onions for longer - until they turn brown preferably. it takes around 30 min but the taste is incomparable.

I am American and don't have a particularly adventurous palate, but my husband and I loved this dish. Next time I make it, I will cover the lentils while they cook. Too much water evaporated, resulting in a little scorching on the bottom. We didn't have any yogurt, which other reviewers recommended, so we ate it with sour cream, which was delicious. I chopped the onion instead of slicing it, as one reviewer suggested, and I'm glad I did. Next time I will cook more onions; they were so good. My husband cooked them with a little paprika and garlic salt. Next time I will serve this with some kind of flat bread.

Ok first of all this recipe was shared by someone who has a cool name- Osiris. :)
Now that I have that out of the way- this was delicious. I didn't have All Spice (which some reviews recommend) so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice- kind of the same thing. Sounds weird but it came out delicious. 

I have no clue if this is authentic or not but it's pretty Middle Eastern in taste and delicious. Yeah for non soup lentil recipes. 
Thanks for sharing.

Very yummy! I would also suggest adding just a dollop of plain yogurt when serving to give it just a little tang. Other than this this recipe is awesome.

My local middle Eastern restaurant serves this dish as a special only on Thursdays.  It is my FAVORITE dish but they wouldn't tell me what it is called!  They call it the lentil special. I thought this recipe came closest to what it is they are serving there so I thought I'd give it a try.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used vegetable stock instead of water and I put cinnamon and allspice in with the onions while they were cooking.  I am thrilled to say it tastes exactly like their lentils!  Im so excited I can now make this at home :)

This is okay. I cooked the lentils in chicken broth for flavor, and added cumin as other reviewers have done. The flavor just wasn't strong enough for me,

I fixed this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Only thing I did different was cook the lentils in chicken broth instead of water and I added a teaspoon of garam masala and a pinch of curry. Also as others suggested I doubled the rice.  It was a perfect ratio. I also added about a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the onions as they were browning.  Tasted very much like what I've eaten in a local Lebanese restaurant.  Thanks for a wonderful and easy side dish that goes with just about anything.

SO EASY!! I prepared the rice (brown rice) in my rice cooker WITH the lentils. It worked out perfectly. My 10-cup rice cooker held 4 cups of lentils and 3 cups of rice along with the water specified by the rice cooker. The cumin was too strong for my taste, and since I used only 3/4 tsp. per recipe, I will lower it to 1/4 tsp. per recipe. Added a little cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. allspice per recipe (2 tsp. for my cooker). Also left out salt (heard it toughens lentils) and added to taste later. Like my Syrian grandma, I served with plain (Greek) yogurt atop.

I had to make it a four, because despite that this recipe is very good, it can use more spices.

To enhance the flavors, I used a walmart Lebanese kebab spice (which has a mixture of cumin and other good Arabic spices, ground loosely). I used one large onion, a very large (fried) green pepper, and half a bunch of fresh coriander leaves (chopped), 2 large sprigs of fresh mint (chopped), 3 larger sprigs of fresh basil (chopped), diced, raw garlic (2 cloves) instead of powdered garlic, only olive oil (and as needed, no 1/4 cup, goodness that is way too much!). I think it can use more rice, so I'd add 1 c. next time instead of 3/4 c.

Served with a salad of roundly sliced (skinned) cucumbers, and diced fresh red tomatoes, topped with the Walmart Lebanese spice mix, salt, and sprinkled fresh coriander, basil, and mint.

Both items were lightly spruced with lemon juice (I only used one quarter of a rather small, but juicy, lemon, but I recommend using as much as you like to enhance the flavor of the herbs and veggies!)

This recipe is a 3 or 4 as is, but with my adjustments it became a 5. I would make this exact thing again, and serve with both fresh, plain thick yogurt (full fat), some creamy rich homemade hummus, and fresh or warmed pitas or other flat breads (ie. Afghan bread). I served it with water, but I would like to try this with icy, cold mint tea. I didn't follow the times for this because I forgot, and it turned out perfect on the first try. It's almost a 5, just try it!

Excellent simple, healthy dish!  I followed the advice of others here and added a bit of cinnamon to my onions while they cooked, which was a great idea.  I'd definitely recommend trying this out!  It's cheap and easy!

I really like this.  I had an alternate recipe that used cracked wheat instead of rice and I had lost it.  I like using rice better as it is easier to sift rocks out of than cracked wheat!  I made as directed and it was great.  I also make it ahead for potluck and reheat in the oven.  The rice/lentil mixture then gets a little bit of a crunchy crust, which some have shared that they really enjoy.

I made this hoping to mimic the lentils and rice from my favorite lebanese bakery.  This was pretty close and was very good but seemed to be missing something.  I read the reviews and did see the suggestion to add cinnamon and allspice.  I did add a bit of cinnamon but I didn't have any allspice.  I visited the lebanese bakery yesterday and mentioned that I had tried to make this but it was missing something.  She just smiled so I knew she wasn't going to give up any secrets.  I will try the allspice next time and maybe try replacing some water with vegitable broth.  Also I diced the onions and mixed them through.  Overall this was really good and I am so excited I can now make this for myself when I can't get out to buy it.  Thanks for sharing and thanks for all the helpful reviews.

Spot on recipe.  Tasted exactly like the authentic dish I've had countless time.  I do believe I did add a bit more cumin.

I've made this dish many times, I just love it.  I don't follow the cooking times exactly.  I just keep an eye on it.  I added extra cumin, as well as allspice and cinnamon.  Caramelizing the onions is a must!  I serve this with a yogurt sauce consisting of salt, finely chopped cucumber and cilantro or mint...follow Aprilbeauty's advice

I did not add the salt to the lentils while they cooked, it would make them hard and take longer to cook.  Used about 3 cups of water for 1.5 cups of lentils. 
I added 1.5 cups of rice along with 3 cups of  chicken broth cumin, allspice, ginger, bay leaves, curry, garlic powder.
I presoaked the rice and it cooked in 12 minutes. I used Jasmine long grain rice.
I sauted 4 large onions for 40 minutes till very dark brown. I added salt and a bit of sugar to the onions too.
Very good dish had a lot of flavor. Served with garlic and mint yogurt.

I grew up eating this and have always loved it.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and sauteed one of the onions before adding the lentils and then adding salt after the lentils were soft.  I also sprinkled a little allspice and cinnamon w/ the cumin.  Finally, I fried the onion until golden and crispy and put it out on a napkin so that it would remain crispy.  Recipe came out very similar to what my mom makes.  Also, this recipe is meant to be eaten with yogurt or a salad mixed into it, so we added yogurt.  It was delicious and we will definitely be making it again!

As per another reviewer, I saut√©ed one whole onion first before adding in the lentils and vegetable broth (instead of water).  I used minced garlic versus garlic powder, and waited till I added the rice to add the salt.  I ended up adding more water  as well as about a tsp of garam masala during the last cooking/steaming portion since I felt it needed it.  With those edits, it tasted great!

Very good! I skipped the second teaspoon of salt and it was fine. I also used a half of oil to cook the onions (I used 1 1/2 large onions and could have used 2 whole. The big white ones from Costco.), and my daughter and I are very happy with this dish. Thank you!

This needed a lot of salt to get the flavors to pop, but once they did the dish was really good! I am SO bad at making rice and lentils (in any combination), so I won't fault the recipe when I say that mine turned out really mushy. I've never had this dish before, but from the pictures it looks like the rice should have a little fluff left in it. Mine did not. It was almost the consistency of mashed potatoes (almost).  Again, I think that's due to my own inadequacies rather than the portions in the recipe. Even with the consistency being a little off, I was satisfied at the end of the meal! I definitely think I'll make this again, and hopefully I'll be able to tinker with the portions so that is looks more like the photos and less like gruel! Oh, added whole cumin seeds and a pinch of cinnamon to the fried-onion process and I'm glad I did.

Super easy and delicious. I make this all the time. I'm often too lazy to cook the onions the way it says here, so I just toss them in the pot when the lentils and rice are almost done cooking.

I spent a semester in Jordan, and this tastes quite like my host mother's dish.

If you think it's bland, add some yogurt on top and some vinegar based hot sauce to taste. This may not be truly authentic, but my host family did this, so I don't feel as though I'm defiling the dish.

A little dry but good otherwise. I sprayed oil and baked the onion slices instead of pan frying.

The flavor is spot on. Delicious! (using only 1/2 tablespoon of cumin)
Unfortunately the cooking time is way too long for everything. Mine turned into a big lump of mush (I will still eat it).
Next time I will cook the lentils and rice together for 30 minutes tops.

My family has been making this dish for years. After my Mom passed away I couldn't find her recipe and have been trying various ones from the internet. This one has way too much Cumin and rice. The rice isn't supposed to be the dominant ingredient the lentil is. I would adjust this recipe to 1/4 cup of rice, 1/2 tbs. of Cumin, if that much, and half the garlic. it called for.

I made it a bit differently. 

I first put water and lentils in the rice cooker, and cooked it for a full cycle. 
Then added the rice and necessary water, mixed, and cooked for a full cycle too. 

I put in a large wok all the oil and cooked the onions and all the spices. when the onions were done, I added the rice and lentils and cooked in the wok for a while longer. 

I found it easier to cook both lentils and rice in the rice cooker as you just set it and can forget it.

Delicious!! It reminds me of the short time I spent in the Middle East. I have been looking for an authentic mujadara recipe for years! As a time saver, I cooked the rice and lentils together in chicken broth, adding more liquid as needed. The total cooking time was about 30 minutes. Then in olive oil I saut√©ed the onions and added the cumin and some garlic salt. This mixture was added to the lentils and rice during last 10 minutes of cooking time. Yummy! And it makes a LOT.

This was a fabulous, easy vegetarian meal! I followed suggestions of the other reviewers by adding 1 tsp each of garam masala and curry, as well as not adding salt until after the lentils were cooked. I also cooked the rice and lentils in a rice cooker while I roasted the onions in the oven and mixed everything together when cooked at the end. Definitely will make it again!

I used chicken broth instead of water (1&1/2 Cup )with lentils.I added 1tsp. Aleppo red pepper, small amount of Allspice. I as others agree you need to add 1&1/2 cup water for rice. I saut√© my onions in butter and add at the end on top. This is delicious . A staple in our house!

I did cook the lentils as instructed here but cooked the brown rice separately.  Then I served a scoop of each over greens that had been tossed with a simple lemon and oil dressing and a scoop of hummus.  Topped with the delicious fried onions.  Only thing I will do next time is double the onions!

I doubled the recipe but otherwise made it with the same ingredients and directions.  It turned out well.  My wife, who is hesitant to try new foods, went back for seconds.  This is an easy dish to make after a long day at work taking about an hour from start to finish.  My family topped theirs with sour cream. I topped mine with Siggi's Icelandic plain yogurt. Yum!  This dish is now going into the menu rotation.

It was ok. stuck pretty close to recipe. added about 1/4 t ea of allspice and cinnamon.  Used whole garlic sauted instead of garlic powder. Cumin completely overpowered it all.  That was all we could taste. I think i'll try it again but i'll cut cumin in half.

It's almost not fair to rate this because i made so many changes. here goes. I use brown rice, so needed to increase both liquid and cooking time. Added leftover canned diced tomatoes, canned spinach, and canned mushrooms (with liquid) and some of my veggie broth from yesterday. Also increased the cumin and garlic powder, and added white pepper and curry powder. Now I suppose I'll have to make it again as written! No hardship there, I'm sure.  Also must see how the leftovers are tomorrow.

This was quite good but but i found the salt to be a bit much although still good. Next time i will probably reduce the salt while cooking the lentils and reduce the salt when adding the rice. Also I added 1 cup rice instead of 3/4 to serve more. Make sure to fry enough onions. I only had 2 and that was not enough. Also from personal preference.... fry the onions longer to get a nice brown sweet caramalized onion. This really makes the dish tasty. I served this with a tomato/ mint/ green corianer raita.

It's a really tasty dish, and easy to make. This dish pairs really well with them some hummus and flatbread for a middle eastern vegetarian kind of night.

This is good but made changes to it for more flavour. I used fresh garlic instead, and added grounded cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.....deeeelish!

I've never had this dish before and wasn't sure how it should actually taste. Although I forgot about sauteing the onions, I thought the dish was very good. I had to add more water after adding the rice and extend the cooking time. The rice was fine, but the lentils were tougher than I expected them to be. I'll follow the other reviewers next time and be sure to not add the salt until after the rice and additional liquid. See Aprilbeauty's recommendations.

This was pretty good. We're not vegetarians, so I used some chicken broth in place of the water, and I think that kept it from being bland. My only question is about the cook time - at 40 minutes, my rice was overcooked and starting to get crunchy. Is that what is supposed to happen?

Delicious, quick and simple. Also lends itself to being adjusted to your personal tastes. (In case you'd like more or less spice, or more veggies.) Definitely will become one of our regular dishes.

Family liked it.  Cheap and easy.  Saved this one.  (I cheated and used left over rice.)  Also finished off in the oven so I wouldn't have to worry about it scorching.

Very nice recipe, but used quinoa instead of rice and added a can of organic chicken. I used chicken broth instead of water and added to sauteed chopped onions, finely chopped carrots, and garlic. I also added turmeric to the spices. Added the salt at the end or the lentils will stay al dente.

Excellent! I did cook the lentils in veggie broth, and added garam masala, cinnamon, and allspice with the rice. Very, very good, especially with the carmelized onions on top. Thanks for the recipe!

The spices are just right, but if you cook it as written, the lentils turn to mush. I cooked the lentils and rice together in the rice cooker together with all the ingrediants as written and it came out perfect!

This recipe is a keeper, my family loved it and it is even better the next day. I used Spanish Pardina lentils, basmati rice, yellow onions. I dry-toasted the cumin in a small skillet beforehand as I think it tastes nasty otherwise. I didn't add the salt until step 2 and, because the lentils had absorbed almost all the water after 20 minutes, I added an extra half cup of water with the rice. I sauteed the onions in 2 T of olive oil, they took about 20 minutes to carmelize. As suggested by other reviewers I added a good pinch of allspice and cinnamon.

This recipe was really good. I made it in like half of the time by throwing all ingredients into the rice cooker. Also, I felt it was missing a little something, so I squeezed some fresh lemon wedges over the finished product right before serving. Yum!

Over an HOUR later and it still isn't done? Are you kidding me? And the flavors are BARELY there, even with other people's suggestions. I'm going to have to cook something else entirely now. SO disappointed.

I've never made lentils and rice before but have enjoyed it many times.  This is very good and reheats well - I took some for lunch today.  As others have said, make sure the onions get nice and golden - let them go with the stir here and there.  My husband doesn't like beans much and he loved this.

never had it before but my neighbor (who is from the middle east) loves this dish (its comfort food for them) so I decided to give it a shot.  very tasty, very good - much better than any lentil soup receipt's that I've have ever made in the past.  By the way, even though I've never heard of this dish, let alone made it, I did and it was pronounced EXCELLENT!  which is truly amazing considering I don't even know how its supposed to turn out like.  I did use chicken broth instead of water and increased amount of rice to 1 cup (and 3-1/2 cups chicken broth) and real garlic, not powdered (3 cloves).  they told me allspice is typical and so I used some of that.  I must say that even though I've never tasted what it should be like, but it was very good and recommend this highly to everyone, especially considering that lentils and rice are very good for you.

My grandfather used to make this when I was a girl, he was Greek born in Egypt and raised in Saudi Arabia. I never knew what it was called and just happened to stumble on this receipe. Can't wait to make it. Though I am sure he also used spinach.

Delicious, my go to cheap and easy dinner! I've never happened to have garlic powder on hand when making this, but I think it is great without. It takes about 20 minutes for my onions to get soft and sweet, but it really does add great flavor!

This was so good. It is like comfort food, but good for you! I cut out the vegetable oil completely and fried the onions with cooking spray. I used 1/2 the olive oil. By doing that this is a very low cal, low fat, extremely good for you as well as a super yummy meal. YUM!!!

This was good but I think only because I used veg. stock instead of water, and I added garam masala. I think it would have been bland otherwise. I did have to use an additional 1 1/4c. of liquid, as it kept drying out and sticking to the pan before the lentils and rice were tender. I added salt to taste and put salt and cinnamon in with the sauteing onions. I cooked the onions way longer than the stated time, more like 40 min. I strained some reg. plain yogurt to make greek yogurt and served it on top. We ate this with a greek salad I made; all in all a tasty meal!

This was absolutely delicious! Never had it before so had no expectations in comparing it to restaurants, just looking for new ideas.  Appreciate the tip on waiting to add salt til the lentils are soft.  Made a difference.  Served with the yogurt sauce is a must as well.  Thank you heljammal!

I have made this several times now. 
I prefer to use a couple of cloves of garlic rather than garlic powder and brown basmati rice so I add a little extra water.  I also caramelize one extra onion and add it in to the lentils as they are cooking sometimes.

My sons both love this dish and request it.  The caramelized onions really make the dish.

Very tasty dish. I did add a bit of garam masala and cinnamon, as others suggested. I also cooked the lentils separately from the rice, since my children don't care for "spicy" food. Served with a side of saut√©ed veggies.

Excellent vegy recipe that may also serve along with meat (as in my case). A claasic and a must try from Eastern Mediterranean cuisine. Spice up to your taste.

This was a BIG hit.  I served with fresh warm tortillas.  Surprisingly, eating it with a fork vs. the tortillas made a pretty large difference in the taste. I liked both ways.  I agree with others that you have to really brown the onions.  I changed the cooking time on my lentils to 25 minutes before adding the rice and followed the cooking time recommended on the rice (20 minutes).  I added a touch of cinnamon to the onions.  YUM.

My bf and I really enjoyed this dish. I did have to add extra water to get the rice and lentils to finish cooking and i cooked the onions longer. Overall very easy, perfectly spiced, dish to make. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe! Also leftovers are great in taco's

Tasted great. I only had brown rice on hand though and used chicken broth for added flavor. To add some crunch to it, I made a greek salad on the side and sauteed some almonds to sprinkle on top. Delicious!

I too had to add more liquid because of scorching and this resulted in the whole dish becoming mushy. Next time I will adjust the liquid. Flavor was good.

Loved it!  Easy and savoury.  Did add a little curry as mentioned in another review and will next time try a dallop of yogurt but it was wonderful on it's own!  Definitely going to be a regular...
