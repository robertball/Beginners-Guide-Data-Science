I loved this casserole, as did my dinner guests. The green beans were nicely complemented by the mushroom flavor. It took a long time for the breadcrumbs to get browned, though ... about 40 minutes, not 20, as the recipe says. Maybe my oven is off. In any case, it was worth the wait!

This recipe was ok. I thought the flavor was bland. I would saute the green beans next time and skip the Panko Bread Crumbs.

Th original recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of soy sauce added to the mushroom soup. Don’t leave that out!

This is a big improvement on the gb casseroles of my youth because of the substitution of fresh ingredients for canned or frozen.  I do keep tradition by substituting canned fried onions for fresh and for the bread crumbs as topping.  Sprinkle them on top with about 10 minutes cooking time left to crisp them up a bit.  Also, I add some soy sauce as the original recipe called for.  This recipe is basically just a starting guideline.  You can vary the amount of mushrooms, beans, soup or onions by eyeballing it.  You'd be hard pressed to ruin this.

I didn't like this.
Better to go with the bacon, garlic green bean recipe.

Excellent base recipe, fresh vegetables are always worth that extra effort! Subbed the bread crumbs for French fried onions, doubled the soup added 6 slices of crumbled bacon. Not many leftovers

Yes! This is very good and easily adaptable. I didn’t have mushrooms or mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken soup and a diced red pepper. Everyone loved it and I will make it again.
