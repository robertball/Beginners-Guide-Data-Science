I had the starter made already,  and kneading is difficult for me so I was intrigued by this recipe, which starts out in the bread machine......I was NOT disappointed!!!!!! I'd give it more stars if I could - easy and turned out beautifully.  I did note that the cooking time says 15 minutes, but actually it's fifteen minutes, remove water pan, then additional 15 minutes. Thank you, Sam for giving me a homemade bread I don't have to knead for 10 or more minutes.

For a Starter, just type sour dough starter in the search and it will bring a few up so you can pick the one you would like.  This recipe was simple to make.  It tastes wonderful!

I just made this recipe and it was perfect. the outside crunchy and the inside beautifully moist. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour with 2 cups of white flour. I also did not use egg whites or dairy milk, instead I brushed on homemade almond milk. This was delicious! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Super recipe! I make a lot of bread using the bread machine with Dough cycle. I spray the dough when it's ready to rise with an olive oil or good quality cooking spray to keep dough from getting a skin.

This recipe is wonderful and it does not say that it is a baguette. It is just plain old sourdough french bread. Very easy to make and tastes wonderful.

Didn't make any changes. The Sourdough French bread came out great! The texture was fine the crust had a real nice crunch to it . Used the wash and spray method when baking. Will make this again. It was sooo  good.

Attention All home bread makers. I have tried many many recipes for bread and my bread ALWAYS turned thick and dense, never fluffy or airy. I FOUND THE SECRET. Add 1 small EGG, the whole egg, and 1 Tablespoon butter to the mix as you make the bread. The egg will make the bread rise and fluff up just like it should. No amount of extra yeast or backing powder or anything will do the trick. 1 EGG and 1 Tablespoon of butter. The dough will be softer and wetter, no problem, it will be fantastically airy and light.

A baguette must be crispy on the outside and chewy inside. This was not a baguette.
