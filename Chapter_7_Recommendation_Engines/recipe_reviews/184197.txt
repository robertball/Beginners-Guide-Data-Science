This is a STEW! Why would you want to use an expensive cut of meat like a beef tenderloin in a crock pot. OMG!  I live in Albuquerque, born and raised and any lesser cut would work just fine!  We never put beef in our Green Chile Stew just pork!  Do use the masa, it adds depth to the stew and remember if you are not from around this part of the country that if you have fresh green chili that you need to roast it first.  There are several ways to do it:  You can put it on a pan and broil it, turning it when each side gets black and blistered.  You can put it on your outside grill, or my preferred method for just a few chilis at a time, I roast them on the top of my gas range.  After blistering the skin, put them into a large resealable bag and let them steam for about 15 minutes then peel off the charred outer skin.  To tell if your chili is hot, look at the stem end.  The more points it has, the hotter it is.  If you don't want you chili hot remove the stems and seeds.  Enjoy!

We New Mexicans are VERY protective of our cooking heritage!  It takes a lot to impress us.  As "Valencia" said, nice but not authentic.  Grew up in Albuquerque's north valley.

Not authentic try Chile Verde II from this site. This is the real thing. Top with fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime. We make this in huge batches and then freeze it. YUMMY stuff

We loved this recipe and although we did change some things, we feel it would be worth 5 stars as written.  What I did differently was, I left out the beef and doubled the pork (we didn't have any beef on hand), I substituted whole wheat flour for the masa harina, used sweet yellow onions instead of red (my husband's preference), and coriander instead of cilantro.  One thing I did also was substitute a rutabega for the potato, in order to cut the carbohydrate count considerably (we try to watch our starches when we can).  This was so wonderful, and even though it may seem like a lot of prep at first glance, was quite easy.  We served it to guests on Halloween and they all loved it!

This is very tasty as written, but having grown up in NM, agree it's not quite authentic.  Stick with pork, don't waste beef tenderloin in this, replace the cumin with chile powder or ancho chile powder.  Cumin has NO place in authentic NM food.  The masa adds a unique flavor that wheat flour cannot duplicate; don't make that substitution.  Most of all, enjoy this tasty NM dish!

I would use a lesser cut of beef; I agree with the other reviewers, this is not authentic, but is tasty--

Very good and comforting for a cold day.  I used leftover grilled pork loin & no beef.  Pretty much followed recipe except no masa, as we wanted it brothy.  Served with sour cream and cheese on top with fresh flour tortillas.

I live in Albuquerque and this is close to what we get in the restaurants but leave the beef out.  Make it with pork or chicken and it will be much better and cut down on cilantro since that will overcome the great taste of this stew.

Excellent recipe! I do agree it's not authentic per se but I don't believe the Author ever stated that it was. You hit the 
key components. If it were an ingredient that was cheap for field workers and easy to come by, it went in the pot and was served with tortillas, chips or over rice with beans!

I made it and it has a lot of freshness to it. Reminds me a lot of Mexi-Cali recipes. It’s really good, but not really the New Mexican green chile stew (not as thick and doesn’t have a deep flavor) I was imagining from my childhood. Also, to liven up my meat before adding it to the liquid, I heavily seasoned the corn meal before tossing the meat in it, so it brought out some really good flavor.

The Green Chile I make is similar to this recipe than the Green Chile II recipe. I only use pork. When browning the meat, I some of the flour/masa to blacken. I deglaze the pan with the broth.  I do a 1:1 tomatoes and green chile.  I've done many variations.  I've added chorizo, used white wine to deglaze, chipolata peppers.   I have never used potatoes

I'd make this again, but I did modify it somewhat. First off, I sauteed everything in a cast iron skillet, meat first, and put that in the slow cooker. 2) I used Tomatillos instead of Tomatoes 3) I cooked the pork tenderloin separately and then I set it aside. I added it at the end of the cooking run for the last hour. Pork tenderloin is much more tender naturally than beef stew meat, so I didn't want to overcook it in the slow cooker for hour and hours.

Native New Mexican here, this is as authentic as it gets. I make a fair number of substitutions to this: canned tomatoes if fresh aren’t in my fridge at the moment, venison (if stew meat I try to cook it for 8+ hours in a slow cooker on low, if burger meat it only needs ~2 hours of simmering on the stove top), I’ve also tried adding carrots. Every time this comes out great, despite my various substitutions. The masa harina (I’ve substituted corn meal) gives it a heartier taste so don’t skip that! Excellent recipe.

Is very good!  I made a big batch for reheats during the week for lunch and dinner in a rush.  I substituted a 2.5 pound pork shoulder for my meat.  When I make it again I will add a little more potato.

We really enjoyed it and I am sure that this will become a cold weather staple.

I was trying to match a recipe from a restaurant meal. It didn’t match. It might actually have been better. I would definitely make it again.

I made this for sale at the local Christmas Market ...in New Mexico. Obviously, I calculated for 70 people so was barely made in a roaster and large soup pot. IT WENT OVER ASTOUNDINGLY AND SOLD AMAZINGLY. Very little  left and many wanted the recipe!

It was a little hot, but I had frozen green chiles from Hatch New Mexico.  I think that was why it was so spicy. We added cheese and sour cream and that cut the heat.
Very good!

This is a great recipe. The flavor of the stew is really warm and comforting. I made similar changes to the recipe that Amy used. I doubled up on the pork shoulder, and did not add any beef. We are on a low carb diet, so I used flax meal instead of masa harina. I used chicken stock instead of beef stock, and diced canned tomatoes, drained vs. fresh. Next time, I will try rutabaga as a potato substitute.

Love this recipe! Had to make a few changes because we were a half hour from any stores and had to use what I brought as well as what was available at our VRBO. Next time I will follow it exactly because I think it will be better. Used it more as a gage as to how much ingredients for proportions. One thing, DO NOT SKIMP ON THE CHILES! And use frozen if possible!
Thanks!!! My family loved it!!

I was so pleased to find this recipe for New Mexico Green Chile Stew especially since I have moved from New Mexico to Washington. I think that it is very authentic especially when you use New Mexico green chili. We get it at our local Whole Foods in late August and stock up on it and freeze it to use the whole year round.I give this recipe two thumbs up.

Loved this recipe!  I like things pretty spicy so I used extra cayenne, swapped the potatoes for hominy, served with cornbread.  Will definitely be making this again soon!
