absolutely delicious, I would change a few things though: 1. perhaps half the sauce because it makes a lot or make it into chowder the next day! 2. couldn't find porchini mushrooms so we used regular mushrooms along with portabella which worked well. 3. use half and half or whole milk instead of heavy cream, you won't notice the big loss of fat :) 4. cut chicken broth and use as much chicken broth as cream to allow more thickening. overall awesome recipe!

I have done many great salmon recipes with different flavors.  I made this one last night for a romantic dinner with my wife.  This recipe has the taste of "Romance".  Some recipes are good for whenever you are in the mood for them.  But this one, in my opinion, is for those romantic nights.  I halfed the recipe and used two Salmon portions, and there was plenty of sauce.  I noticed nothing was mentioned about sides by the recipe, or by members who left reviews.  I decide to do a side of medium white rice, and some baby carrots cooked with butter, salt, and pepper.  The sauce was great with the rice.  This is also a good recipe to share wine with.  All in all, I loved this recipe.  Oh, and some people had problems finding the porcini mushrooms.  I did also, I think they may be seasonal.  But I did find them at the grocery store in the produce section package in a dried form.  All you have to do is soak them in boiling water for a few minutes, and they are good to go.  hope that helps.

Woah, this was good. I wish I'd left out the celery though - just didn't seem to go with the other flavors too well. Apart from upping the amount of curry powder (I used some pretty spicy Madras Curry powder) and adding some dried curry leaves, I made this pretty much as written. Turned out very rich and flavorful. It would work great with chicken and/or shrimp, I think. Thanks!

I was blown away. Made for a romantic dinner with my husband, and he loved this! As did I. I cut the recipe in half and we still have tons leftover, but I am glad! Thanks for the recipe, it was amazing!

This recipe was amazing! It was super easy, and extremely tasty. The sauce was incredible! Next time, I will cook the vegetables down a little more so they are more tender. Absolutely fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

Very good dinner.  The saffron and curry combination in the sauce gave it a really delicate flavor and turned it a pretty yellow color.  I roasted my salmon at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes, since I prefer roasted salmon to seared.

I made this for my husband and friends and they RAVED about the taste! However, the sauce was quite watery so I'd recommend adding a little cornstarch to thicken it up. The following morning we thickened up the leftover sauce and added it to scrambled eggs. FABULOUS!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out good.  It is not too spicy, and the sauce was also good on asparagus and potatoes.  It does make a lot, so that's what I used the extra for.  I used regular white button mushrooms instead of porcini, as well.

I halved the recipe and had lots!  It was wonderful and will definitely serve again.  Rave reviews from the guests.

This was amazing!! I served over shrimp instead of salmon all over angel hair. Such a rich and unique taste. Way to change up dinner time. It was something I would imagine I could only get at a restaurant! Sooooo good and super impressive! Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I added a little lemon juice at the end to brighten it up a little. I also used half milk and half cream. I think I did end up needing to thicken the sauce a little with a cornstarch slurry.

This was an interesting mix of spices and vegetables.  Very tasty however I did not taste the curry at all.  I might add more next time.  I added the chicken broth powder with the other spices and then I added only 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk (to replace the cream). There was still plenty of sauce for the amount of portions it made.

Interesting combination, yet it works! We had a lot of mushrooms and celery so added about 3x the amount and so ended up with less liquid in the sauce but the taste was still great! Will consider making again...

This salmon was delicious! I also couldn't find porcini mushrooms, so I also used regualar ones, and it was still really good. I used fat-free half and half, too. The sauce turned out great, but I agreee that you could get away with about half as much, but you can save the extra and put it on just about anything-it's that good! this is a real restaurant quality meal, although it is a bit expensive (the salmon, saffron, special mushrooms). Great for a special occasion.

The flavours in this dish went together wonderfully - I was scared that with so many ingredients in the sauce it would be a little overwhelming, but everything was very balanced. 

My only suggested variation (which I found very successful) is to set aside half the sauce once finished, then puree the other half in a blender, then combine the two back together. Gives a little more of a variated texture. 

All in all, an excellent dish I will make again!

Very tasty dish! I'm lactose intolerant so I substituted a blend of reduced fat coconut milk & almond milk for the heavy cream. Also added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I couldn't find the fennel bulb so I substituted chopped celery and a teaspoon of anise seed which seemed to work alright.  Served it over orzo pasta. Yummy!

I expected to love this, however the sauce was extremely thin. I would start with a half cup of broth and add more only if necessary. If you served this with rice to soak up the liquid, you would still have leftovers if you followed the directions. I used fennel seed in place of the bulb.

Decided not to sear but rather bake as I usually do. Poured the sauce over the salmon after 10 minutes in the oven. Will do it again for sure.

I served this over a mixed rice and it was simply amazing. Fairly quick and easy and very, very tasty. I can already tell this will become a favorite for us.

I had to make a few minor changes based on what I had in the house. I didn't have celery so I put in some diced red bell pepper instead. As far as the fennel goes, I used every part of it - the bulb, stems, and fronds. Like other reviewers, I also added in much more curry powder, probably about 1 Tbs total. Also, I didn't have saffron so that was left out.

This was just ok for me. The only change I made was halving the broth to allow for a thicker sauce.  It seemed to be lacking flavor.  I think I would have prefered more spices in addition to the curry powder.
