Better than Fanny May any day. I used roasted salted almonds and it was quick and taste so good. I am a chocolate lover and just picked up 3 lbs of the following, Peanut M&M's, Peanut butter M&M's and chocolate covered Almonds which wont last long but now I will make my own Almond Bark and stop buying the other guys candy. I am making the Best Toffee Ever recipe on Allrecipes later tonight with walnuts. MMMMM Good.

I followed the directions to a tee, once I added the butter the wafers became more difficult to stir, and lost the glossy shine that it had before, I added veg oil to mixture which thinned it enough for me to spread, but I must have done something wrong.  Will look at other recipes to see if there is a remedy to my situation.....oh, I have it three stars, because in spite of how it looked, it was delicious.
