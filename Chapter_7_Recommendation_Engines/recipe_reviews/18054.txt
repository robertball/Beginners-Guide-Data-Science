The beef is very tender. I used a 4pound rump roast and cooked it for about 12 hours. Added 2T. steak sauce to the gravy mixture as well as chopped garlic. The last 2 hours,I added red potatoes and carrots to make a complete meal! 
Also thickened the gravy with cornstarch.
The whole family enjoyed it. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Based on previous reviews, I ad-libbed a bit.  I put in 2/3 cup of onions, twice the minced garlic, added several dashes of worchestershire sauce and two tablespoons of honey.  The sauce was wonderful & I served it over white rice.  Great recipe!

I was planning to make a different roast but didn't have all the ingredients. Fortunately, I stumbled across this delight.

I made this exactly as written, with the exception of the cooking time. I cooked it on high for six hours.

I will definitely make this recipe again, except next time I will add a few drops of Tabasco or perhaps a jalapeno-based sauce to wake the sauce up a bit.

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the sauce as is, and my husband liked it as is, but a smidgeon of some spice would make it pop just a little.

This is really good!  I read the other reviews and did some addlibing.  I added a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce, about 3 table spoons of Texas Pete, a couple shakes of Cajun seansoning, a dash of A1 and since I didn't have any honey, I used Caro syrup.  Oh, and I did add extra onion and doubled the garlic like the others did.  It was great!  It had a more BBQ flavor, and had a little kick to it, but not too much!  Served it over rice.  I will certainly be making this again!

This turned out yummy.  It wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped, so I added some extra zing...garlic, a little Lawry's seasoning salt, which livened it up.  Just the right amount of moisture, though, the texture of the roast was perfect.  Will definitely make again

This was amazing! I used Barbeque sauce instead tomato sauce and it fit in perfect. The meat was tender and perfect for sandwiches. Whenever I have a craving for shredded beef this will be my go-to. Thanks!

I didn't find it to be very flavorful.  
In fact, we added bbq sauce to the 
sandwiches while eating in order to have
some pep.

This was good but didn't have a very BBQ flavour. The sauce was more a spicy tomato flavour than BBQ. I still prefer BARBECUED BEEF from this site.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe with only one exception...I used about 2 cups of beef broth instead of bouillon.  It was great over mashed potatoes...

This was amazing!! I followed the directions completely, except for using less onion and chili powder and I used a teaspoon of regular mustard in place of mustard powder. I also added about 1/4 cup of Karo syrup. It was amazing! The first go round we served it over white rice with corn & green beans. Then the leftovers we ate on hamburger buns with a little mustard and pickles & potato chips on the side. Excellent use of a roast! My husband was very pleased! THANK YOU!

Very Good! I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used garlic and onion pasta sauce. I also added bullseye bbq sauce and honey. I checked mine at 5.5 hrs and it was perfect??!

made this for dinner tonight and LOVED it. My boyfriend said it was one of the best dinners Ive made. I had a 2.5lb roast, and used a small can of tomato sauce then filled half the can with bbq sauce and added that. Didnt have any mustard powder, so didnt use it. I served this with coleslaw on top...I ate mine as an open faced sandwich with a fork. I put it on at noon and at 5 I pulled the whole roast out and shredded it, and threw out the fat, but it back in the crock continued cooking on high and ate it at 7. I will make this again and again!

This was really good even with my changes. I didn't have tomato sauce, I had a jar of store brand pasta sauce 28 oz (used the whole jar) I also didn't have mustard powder on hand so I used 2 tbs of spicy mustard. I also added extra chili powder... While I was making it I thought Man this is going to be a waste, but to my surprise... WoW it turned out well. :o)

Really enjoyed this! Didn't change a thing to the original recipe and it was flavorful and extremely tender. The roast fell apart when I touched it with a fork to shred it! Great on sandwich buns and in wraps. Thanks for the submission!

I would give this 4 stars on taste, but not as barbecue....more as a roast with a tomato base sauce.  I just didn't get the barbecue/sweet flavor at all.  Part may be user error as I eyeballed the measurements, but this was WAY off.  Wonderful recipe for a roast though.

Good tasting, and very easy to do. It has a homemade bbq taste not store bought bbq taste and is a good one to have in your recipe arsenal. A definate keeper.

I made this barbecue,  but I didn't add any flour (not necessary).  I also added some apple cider vinegar, liquid smoke, cayenne pepper, extra garlic and onion.  It was very good

This recipe is a keeper! Instead of using tomato sauce, however, I opted to use barbecue sauce as per other reviews. I didn't have any beef bouillon so instead used chicken bouillon and the recipe turned out to be just wonderful!

Other than adding Sazon to the meat initially, I followed the ingredients in the recipe to a tee. One thing I would change is cooking it for 8 hrs on low, not high. It doesn't need to cook for that long.

Really excellent recipe and very easy too.  Followed the recipe exactly except I skipped the bouillon cubes and added a 1/4 cup beef broth, but that probably was not necessary as the roast made its own broth as it cooked all day.  After about 7 hours in the slow cooker, my 3 pound roast was fork tender.  Refrigerated overnight, skimmed off the fat the next day and then warmed everything up and loaded up some good rolls - fabulous.  I did add some BBQ sauce too for added flavor.  This makes plenty!!

I ran across this recipe yesterday, and it sounded wonderful. I just happened to have a beef chuck roast in the freezer, but I did not have all the ingredients on hand, so I had to improvise a little. I threw the frozen roast in the crock pot with 1 cup of water, the beef bouillion cubes, and two bottles of BBQ sauce. I did not have all the seasonings either, so I just added my favorite seasoning (Montreal Steak Seasoning). I let it cook on low for about 12 hours, and it was absolutely fabulous!!! It was so tender it fell apart on it's own - no shredding required! I would have never thought to cook this that way, but after how great it turned out, I won't cook it any other way again! Thanks for your recipe!

As written requires some modification to liven it up. Added BBQ sauce towards the end just to give it a "BBQ" taste. Good base though.

I thought this was pretty good, my boyfriend liked it more than I did. It is not exactly like barbecue beef, but it's close. It does have a nice presentation. Nicely done, but not quite worth 5 stars. Something seems to be missing.

This was a very tender beef and it did taste very good, but it did not taste like BBQ at all.  It was more like a roast.  I would make it again, but not when we are in the mood for BBQ.

First time for me making for roast beef sandwiches and Everyone loved it.  I added a tbsp of teriyaki sauce, and per some of the other reviews I also added more onion and garlic.  Save some of the sauce to put over the beef in the sandwiches. I used the long sandwich rolls.

This was a delicious meal. I changed a few things - eliminated mustard, brown sugsr, tomato sauce, and added 1/2 255 ml bottle Woolworths BBQ sauce, and one 1 1.2 cup box od campbell's beef stock, plus ptoatoes and carrots. I cooked it on high for 7 hrs. The meat was a dream, and my guests really enjoyed it.Elizabeth, Australia.

This has become a new household favorite! I did tweak a few things and it turned out so good. I used 1 whole onion, 1/2 chopped and half thrown in the processor. I added half a bell pepper in the processor as well. I upped the brown sugar to about a 1/2 cup. I dissolved the bouillon in two cups of water and added the water as well. I wound up using 5 cloves of garlic as opposed to one and used 2 teaspoons of mustard powder. I also used about 2-3 teaspoons of Chollula to finish it off. After cooking I also skimmed off the fat from the liquid and used cornstarch to make a thicker sauce from the remaining liquid. It tasted even better as leftovers the next day.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Start it the night before and there is nothing left to do until next day. Very tender and it pulls apart with fork.  Even fussiest eaters enjoy it. Made it with worchestire sauce as well. Both ways fantastic

Didn't like the sauce so much, however, we used the high temperature method...might be better to cook longer at the low temperature.

After reading other reviews, I added more garlic, few dashes of worchestershire sauce, beef broth instead of beef bouilllon and two tablespoon of honey to the recipe.  Used a Dutch oven and cooked for five hours on low heat. The beef was very tender.  My kids loved it on a bun or on white rice.  Will definitely make it again!

This was a really easy recipe, however like the rest of these reviews I feel you do have to add some more ingredients. I added Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce, didnt measure it, just tasted it to see if it tasted good :). I cooked it on high for about 7 hours and then took it out and shredded it. I put it back in and added a little more SBR and added some Open Pit as well. Really good so far. Waiting for my husband to come in from hunting and then we will put it on some Kaiser rolls :)
