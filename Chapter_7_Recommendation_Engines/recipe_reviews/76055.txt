I have been making this recipe for years.  I spread yellow mustard on the crescent roll pie crust before adding the zucchini mixture and use garlic salt in place of salt.  This recipe is always a winner and has been passed on and on.  Enjoy!!!

This recipe was great, and makes fantastic leftovers for lunch! I modified it to make it less dense.  Zucchini: 1T butter instead of 4T. Filling: 3 eggs, 1.5 C mozzarella, 1.25 C ricotta, 1 small tomato (diced). Bake: 9x13 pan with crescent crust for 30-35 minutes.  Even my anti-zucchini family didn't protest!

This recipe was delicious! The only problem I had was that the center didn't seem to want to cook, so I had to cook it longer, and the crust became too well done. Maybe the zucchini was too watery? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

Always excited to find another zucchini recipe for those summer days when the garden is overflowing! This one is very good and have made it several times. A suggestion for the reviewer that said it wasn't getting done in the middle: When cooking the zucchini and onion, be sure allow the liquid to evaporate almost completely! Have had this problem with another zucchini recipe, but this does the trick. Thanks, Mrs. Walter, for the recipe.

I just made this today to reheat for dinner. I my 8 year old daughter scarfed it down. I asked her how many thumbs up and she said 8,000. I read all the reviews and took some advice.  I added some minced garlic to the zucchini were cooking. I also added some parm cheese to the egg and cheese mixture. I also followed someone else's advice and let the veggies cool a little before I mixed it with the egg and cheese. This is a keeper, which is great because we have so many Zucchini. I just made this again last night. This time I added fresh tomatoes to half to try it out. Hubby loved it.

This was a very good pie. However I did not add the eggs right of way let the mixture cool before you add eggs or the eggs will cook. I also added fresh Parmesan cheese for extra flavor. You will see when you pull the pie out of the oven that there is a puddle of moisture in the middle. Put a paper towel on it to soak it up. I will make this again. Very easy recipe!! I posted a photo check it out.

I notice the directions call for a square baking pan - it actually should be a 9-inch pie pan.  Not sure how that got mixed up!

Super easy and delicious!  I add some garlic and often use other vegetables instead of zuchini - brocolli, mushrooms and/or asparagus.  Brought this to an Easter brunch and it was a big hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm sorry, this just tasted a bit boring for my husband and my tastes.  I made it just as specified, and added a brush of the suggested mustard, but it just tasted like melted cheese and zucchini, nothing more.

Im not a huge zucchini fan and was looking for a better for you alternative to breading and frying it which is the only way anyone in my house will - maybe - eat it.  This was suprisingly Fantastic!  Everyone loved it and its the only time my family has requested and asked for seconds of anything zucchini!

I used 1 tablespoon butter and triple the onion.  I also added some basil and garlic.  But the most important ingredient I added is 2 teaspoons of yellow mustard.  Spread the yellow mustard over the crescent rolls after they are pressed into the pan.  This really brings this recipe up a notch in flavor.

I've made this many times.  I add 1/4 tsp. each of garlic powder and basil.  Leftovers are also good the next day.  A good way to use up the extra zucchini.

This was better than I expected and everyone went back for 2nd's. I only used 2 Tbsp of butter and substituted egg beaters. I think I'll try it without the crescent roll next time and see which way I like the best.

This is a great basic recipe as is! I used fresh garden spices, because I had them, and garlic because I love it! I also used olive oil for part of the butter and added some mushrooms. But if you fixed this without changing anything..it would still be great! And the leftovers are yummy for breakfast!

This was sooo good.  My picky 12 year old, who won't eat zucchini, loved it.  Maybe because it's called pie!  Was easy to make too.

Awesome awesome awesome.  I like to use more eggs in a 9x13 for a more quiche-like casserole, but the base ingredients are right on.  Everyone LOVES and requests this meal from me.  One of my staples...

Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. I don't even like zucchini pie recipes, but this turned out wonderful. I just beat the eggs longer than suggested and it was not running at all. I will make this again!

Fantastic.   I used 2 yellow and 2 green zucchini and just a little diced purple onion and sauted until all the moisture was gone.   It turned out so dense (not runny at all), cut and looked beautiful when plated.   Thanks.

This was quite delicious!  I didn't follow any of the suggestions regarding sogginess...just followed the recipe as written, and my crust turned out absolutely PERFECT - crispy and brown all the way through.  The only thing I changed was I used 1 cup of mozzarella and 1 cups of swiss (only because I ran out of mozzarella).  Will definitely make, again! :-)

So easy to make and delicious! I only wish the crescent rolls came in 10oz packages so it worked better with my larger pie pan.

Easy to make, but just a starting point for us. I did use less margarine & used 2 cloves garlic as others suggested. Next time I'll try adding some hot or smoked sausage. I've used both crescent rolls & a pie crust & don't feel it makes a difference, so use whatever you have on hand. I do like it that there is no evaporated or regular milk used because it sets up nicely. Using a cheddar jack cheese adds more flavor than mozzarella.

Too-Lish.  A bit labor intensive, but not hard.  I had no problem with the center being wet. I used an 8 inch cake pan, added parm cheese, but all else the same as original recipe. Did have to cut and piece the flattened crescent roll dough to fit pan. No Problem though. See Pictures. Will make this again, and again.

Oh, my!  This is by far the best vegetable dish I have ever had.  After reading the reviews, I added 2 tsp. minced garlic and an extra egg, and allowed my sauteed vegetables to dry a bit.  This turned out beautifully, and was a big hit with my darling husband too.  Thank you Mrs. Walter!

This was very good,  love the crescent rolls as crust. I baked the crust by itself first I wanted to make sure it got crispy in the middle.  Also very easy.

I used reduced fat crescent dough and cheese and also substituted egg beaters. It still came out delish and I make this several times in the summer when we have plenty of zucchini

I think this could be delicious, but was was too soggy. I am going to try and cook the "crust" slightly and maybe draining veggies some before adding filling. Will make again and cross fingers :)

Amazing! I made some substitutions because of what I had on hand. I made the dough for my pie crust with the Butter Crescent recipe on this site.I used a mix of zucchini and yellow squash. I didn't have parsley or oregano but I had fresh basil(a handful)and I didn't have the mozzarella so I did a cup of cheddar, a cup of white Mexican cheese, and about 1/4 cup Parmesan. I will definitely be making this again!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I have made it so often in the past few months that I have committed it to memory.  I add some wine to the zucchini as it was sauteeing, and some fresh garlic (I am teased that I would add fresh garlic to a dessert) and then I used the Mozzerella / Provolone mixture of cheeses.  SO GOOD!!

When asked "should i make this again?" and the husband and kids vote "Yes, it's super yummy", the recipe receives 5 stars. The flavor was savory and not bland at all. Added the Dijon mustard, Parmesan, and used kosher salt. Only downside was I used the dough I had on hand which was Grands biscuits.  This made the crust too doughy. Also, only used as much oil to needed to saute onion and zucchini.  Make sure to drain veges before adding to egg mixture.

I add 2 TBl. of prepared mustard to this recipe. It adds a really distinct flavor to the pie. It is wonderful served with Italian sausage with strips of green, red, and yellow pepper, with a side of garlic bread. YUM!

This was very delicious and I would definitely make it again. Just two things....tasted a bit salty for some reason so next time I would cut out the salt. Also, I had to put aluminum foil on the crust halfway through baking as the crust started to look as if it was ready to be over browned. Other than that, it's a keeper!

It looks delishes but the center is way too watery even though i drained as much moisture out of the veggies that i could. Ive had it baking for 40 minutes with a pie crust cover on the crust so it wont burn. Please tell me what i can do to cook the egg.

Yum!  I loved this and will definitely make it again in the future.  Some people complained of it being tasteless.  I made the following changes and it was full of flavor.  First off, I used 3 eggs instead of 2, because it just seemed like there was too much zucchini for only 2 eggs.  I also added approx. 1/2 tsp of ground mustard, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a small pinch of cayenne pepper to the egg mixture, and added about 1 tsp of minced garlic to the pan while sauteing the zucchini and onion.  The small amount of cayenne I used does not make it spicy in the slightest. I used "casserole" cheese in place of mozzerella.  It's a mixture of mozzerella, monteray jack, and cheddar.  Because the extra egg I added made it more dense, I had to bake it longer to get the middle to set.  Doing this caused the crescent roll dough that was sticking out above the eggs to burn slightly, but I just cut it off with a knife before serving.  I will have to fiddle with the temp/baking time in the future.  This was just as good reheated for breakfast as well!

I also have been making this for no less than 20 years! this was the only way my kids would eat zucchini, besides bread. Mine calls for 2 tsp Dijon mustard spread on bottom and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder. To the person who tried garlic salt- mostly salt very little garlic. This is a Great recipe!!

I used all the previous suggestions--added another egg, prebaked the shell, drained the zuccini after sauteing.  I even dabbed the top with paper towels a few times during cooking to get  rid of the moisture.  In spite of all this, it was still soggy.  Won't make this again.

My family lived on this pie when we had a surplus of zucchini. It was printed in the Toronto Star (Canada) after winning first place at the Canadian National Exibition about 3 decades ago :) It's a terrific recipe and yes, you do spread some yellow mustard over the crust before you add the filling.  ;)

This recipe was easy to make and really tasty.  I added some tomatoes and used some tomato, garlic and basil seasoning I have instead of the parsley.  Next time, I’m going to add another egg to make it a bit more firm.  Letting the veggies drain before putting them in the crust was a great idea.

Delicious! Wonderful blend of flavors.  I used reduced fat crescent rolls and eggbeaters to make it a little healthier.  I used cooking spray to cook the veggies and left the margarine out completely.  I also added mushrooms and basil. YUM!

Delicious. I had no dill or parsley, so I just used oregano and thyme for the seasonings. I added garlic and celery to my sauteed onions which I sauteed in chicken broth and omitted the margarine.  I don't like store bought crescent rolls at all because they are ridden with partially hydrogenated oils, so I bought a pie crust from a natural market and used that instead. I  spread coarse ground mustard on the bottom of the pie shell, and topped with parmesan. Oh holy yumminess!! I'm going to get seconds right now.

I was a little worried making this, it was my frist time, I read all the comments. So with that in mind I made some changes. Not many. I used the dijon mustard. I also added garlic cloves. Used fresh dill. When I removed the veggies from the skillet, I placed them on a paper towel while they cooled just a little bite,  I cannot stop telling my husband how yummy this was and he agrees. I just emailed some of my friends this recipe. Thanks so much.

Great recipe.  I used fresh squash from the garden in place of the zucchinie.  I added some bell pepper and cooked the squash until all the moisture was gone as others suggested.  I also covered the crust with foil when baking.  It turned out perfect.  My family loved it and it was a good recipe for using up some of the squash from the garden.  Thanks for the great recipe mrs. walter.

The pie would not set for me.  I had to double the cooking time in order for it to cook in the middle.  Once it was set it tasted alright.  I think there has to be an easier recipe out there.

We loved this recipe for Zucchini and it turned out excellent.  The only change I made was to add fresh dill in place of parsley. It was easy to make and looks like it took a long time. It will be one of our favorite recipes during zucchini season!

I made this to use up garden zucchini. Both my mom(who is an excellent cook) and my husband loved it. It was a nice change of pace from the usual zucchini recipes and made great lunch leftovers. Next time, I think I will add diced red pepper. Thanks for the great recipe.

I'm always looking for new zucchini recipes, so I decided to try this one since I had all the ingredients on hand.  It turned out excellent!  My husband and mother-in-law loved it.  The only change I made was that I used a blend of cheeses...asiago, provolone, and mozzarella.

When we had a bumper crop of zucchini, it was All Recipies to the rescue, and this has been one of our absolute favorites.  Think it will probably even do well this winter made with the frozen excess zucchini.

I found this in a magazine 40 years ago and have made it continually since.  I did start adding about a third of a cup of heavy whipping cream to the egg mixture to fluff it up a bit.

I had trouble getting it to cook in the middle, as others mentioned. I took it to a gathering my sister’s house and we put it back in the oven at 250 degrees until lunch was ready, about an hour, and it was perfect. Everyone loved it.

Very yummy ! I used a combination of cheddar and Parmesan because that's what I had. I used about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning for the spices. I didn't have any crescent rolls but I did have some canned biscuits. I split them in half and used that for the crust. It took 50 min for this to finally set. Then I let it set for about 15 min out of the oven.  About half way through I had to put foil on top (loosely )to keep the crust from burning. Versatile recipe I will use again!

You can kick this up several notches by spreading a thin layer of Dijon mustard on the crescent rolls before you add the zucchini.  Yum

I liked this recipe a lot except for the crescent roll crust, but I suppose that's more of a personal preference issue, so I don't really feel it's fair to dock it any stars for that, lol. My husband liked this a lot, too, so I will definitely be making this again with a basic pie crust for the bottom. I loved the zucchini and I really enjoyed how easy and quick this was to make. Thanks for the recipe!

Been making this for a few years now. Really good as is... But I always add a little extra of the seasonings called for. I add a little basil also.  But the main thing is I added cooked chicken to it making it a complete meal. I really like it. Even the guys at work liked it. Well the ones that will eat vegetables did.

This was certainly delicious.  We made a few changes because we had it on hand.  We used yellow squash in addition to the zucchini and we used 1 cup of mozzarella and 1 cup Kraft Italian 5 cheese  blend in a refrigerated pie crust. We also used 3 eggs instead of two.  We had some yummy tomato quarters as a side for a great garden meal.

It's a good base recipe. I would blend in a cheese with a bit more flavor, like a good quality Swiss, and add more onion. I also nearly doubled the amount of herbs that the recipe calls for and it was still somewhat bland.

This is a good basic recipe as a starting point.  For  my first time making this I didn't change anything other than I used a refrigerated pie shell instead of a tube of crescent rolls since that's what I had on hand and I did bake it about  5 extra minutes.  I didn't have a soggy center and the extra time is probably why.  Next time I think I'm going to add more onions in slices instead of dices, sliced mushrooms, cubed ham, eliminate the salt and oregano from the seasonings, add garlic and chili powder.  Might also substitute gruyere cheese instead of mozzarella.  It'll be a full meal in a pie shell.

Will definitely make this again.. delicious.  I put 2 tbsp Dijon on crust, will put more next time.  It was a huge hit at dinner.  
One problem I had was the centre did not bake in 20 minutes, I cooked another 5 and then turned oven off and let sit in oven for 10 mins.  The crust did not burn but was overdone.  The centre was cooked howeever.
Any suggestions?

I used a pie crust instead of crescent dough. Prick the crust with a fork and precook it at 450 for 10-12 min. Watch the crust around the edge to make sure it doesn't get too brown. Reduce oven temp to 375, take crust out of the oven, and fill with zucchini mixture. To prevent the pie crust from getting soggy, I scooped out the veggies from the pan with a slotted spoon so that any excess liquid stayed in the pan. Once veggies were in a separate bowl, I added the egg and cheese. I lined the edges of the pie crust with foil or silicone protectors so it didn't burn and baked as directed in the recipe. I also added only 1 tablespoon of parsley flakes because 2 seemed like too much. It turned out great! My daughters hate squash and they gobbled it up. The egg and cheese help "disguise" the squashy flavor if someone at your table isn't a fan. Great recipe and I love that it really only takes 20 minutes to bake!

Instead of using the crescent rolls, I used a frozen pie crust from our local co-op which was very convenient and tasty.  I also used fresh parsley instead of dried and substituted basil for the oregano.  In addition to the mozzarella I added 1/4 cup of Romano cheese.  I've made it three times already, and everyone who has tasted it, loved it.  I will be making it again.

This was outrageously good. I gave zucchini and the recipe to my brother and his family loved it as well. I didn't have oregano by itself and used the Italian herb mix instead. Still great! I like the use of sliced squash instead of shredded as I've done before.

Yum. Yum. I too have made this for years. Always a hit. I spread prepared mustard after putting the rolls in the pie pan.

This was amazing. I put foil around the edges after 20 min, because it looked like it might burn. I also added minced garlic to the onion and zucchini saute. I can't rave enough about how awesome this was.

I made it as is, I may have put more garlic in it but I stuck to the recipe. I would have preferred a regular pie crust, so the next time I make it I will make t like a quiche, loved the filling.

Fantastic with two changes.  We made in  a store bought pie crust and added Italian herbs to make more tasty.  Results were excellent and we will certainly make it again.

Mom's Zucchini Pie Haiku: "More egg and less cheese. Middle soggy, edges charred. Drop the crescent rolls." If I make this again, I'll skip the crescent rolls entirely and just make it as a crustless quiche instead b/c at 35-40 min. the center stayed soggy (due to moisture in the sauteed zucchini and onion, I suppose) and the crust edges were too browned. I thought 2 cups of cheese was overkill, so I used only 1 cup, and ended up adding a 3rd egg b/c 2 seemed like way too little "binder" for the veggies. To appease to meat-eaters, I put in some crumbled turkey bacon. I don't think that my small adjustments compromised the integrity of the written recipe b/c I think that it really does need some alterations in order to be a successful dish.

Excellent!  So easy to make.  Twicked it a little,  used 3 eggs, minced garlic, Italian seasoning, and mozzarella and jack cheese.  Would use more zucchini next time.  Did let it cool a little before putting it in the eggs cheese mixture.  Keeper!

Instead of the pre-made crescent roll, I made it with a 9 inch pre-made frozen pie crust.  Substituted olive oil for margarine and added mushrooms to the ingredients.  Fantastic.

Ok I hate reviewing a recipe based on what I did different but I wanted to share. Looking at the ingredients, I couldn't help but think pizza. I love pizza so I took the recipe and changed it slightly to make a heather, filling "pizza." I added turkey pepperoni and pizza seasoning to the filling (as opposed to the other spices) and brushed the crust with pizza sauce instead of mustard, as many reviewers suggested.

This was a big hit at thanksgiving! I also used some yellow squash and skipped the parsley and oregano. One whole stick of butter and DILL AND GARLIC POWDER with the zucchini!It makes all the difference!

I made this recipe three days in a row for different events. Every crumb was gobbled up, and many asked for the recipe.  I did make three changes however; I used a 9x13 pan, used three eggs, and I beat in 1/4 c flower as a binder because the zucchini and onions give off some water when cooked in the butter.  This has now become a staple comfort food.

Great recipe!  I used both yellow squash and zucchini (total 5 cups) and added a swirl of yellow mustard on bottom of garlic-butter crescent roll crust...oh so yummy!  Thanks for sharing your mom's recipe with us.  I will be making this again and again!

omg! all my friends loved it! even the ones that hates eating veggies found this pie delicious =D!

I modified it into healthier/ diet version by substituting butter with grape-seed oil / sunflower oil, and not using any pastries. But would be a better idea to switch the pie pan to flat baking containers~as it'd be better and easier to get it off when serving since there's no pie crust =)

This tasted great--even the zucchini-hater said it was good.  But there was a ton of liquid in the bottom of the pie plate, even though I baked it for a couple extra minutes and let it sit for almost 15 before cutting it.  I only used two tablespoons of butter, but maybe I'll drain it next time.  I also added about a teaspoon of minced garlic and 1/2 cup of diced ham, and used 1 cup mozzarella and 1 cup combination of swiss, cheddar, and Monterey jack (assorted open bags).  Might have to try the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow!

Very good receipe.  I used about 1/2 of the butter and before baking cut up a tomato and also added some shredded parm cheese.  Cooked for thirty minutes and used paper towel to absorb moisture in center of pie as it does come out a little soggy in the middle!  Thanks for a great receipe!

I have been making this for years....  It is THE BEST!  I always used muenster cheese instead of the mozzarella.  Basil instead of parsley and I spread 2 t of prepared mustard on the crescent roll just before you add the vegetable mixture.

I love this recipe. I have used one very similar for years. My recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard to be spread on the crescent roll crust before adding the zucchini mixture. It adds a nice flavor.

Excellent! I used Colby/Cheddar shredded blend and about 1/4 cup Parmesan. It was delicious. We really enjoyed it. Using the crescent roll dough made a very good crust. We'll definitely have it again and again -- Thanks, Mrs. Walter!

Not much to it but i think that's the way it's intended. Whenever you have extra zucchini lying around you'll do the same.

A zucchini recipe that even I, a self-proclaimed squash-a-phobic can enjoy!  Definitely add parmesan cheese with the mozzerella cheese, and also sprinkle parm on top.  You won't be sorry!

Yum! I liked this a bit better than my husband, but he still enjoyed it and said he'd like to eat it again. I brushed the crust with dijon mustard. I also added some green and red pepper.

This was very good!  I did brush mustard on like the others.  I do think it could use a little garlic.  other than that it was delicious.

Very good but I found it a bit rich and fatty. It definitely isn't one of those dishes you eat to get more veggies because the cheese and crescent rolls detract from the healthy veggies. But it is definitely a good dinner dish for the occasional treat.  Thank you!

I made this for lunch and my husband said he wouldn't eat it.  He doesn't eat any vegetables.  Well, I went out and when I came back the entire pie was gone.  He snuck a piece and said he liked it and ate the entire thing. This is definately a keeper and will be made again.  Thanks.

Great recipe.  It's the same as my grandma's, except she used to sometimes make it with roll-out biscuits as the crust, used colby-jack cheese instead, and also 1/4 teaspoon of basil.  One key thing is to brush the crust with dijon mustard before putting in the filling.  That really makes it!

I found this recipe because I had some zucchini I had to use up.  I served it to friends with rave reviews.  It isn't too eggy and those who don't like pie crusts loved this crescent roll crust.  It was especially nice because I baked it in a stoneware pie plate.  The cheese and seasonings gave it an Italian taste.  Yum!
