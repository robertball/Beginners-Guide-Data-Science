I tried this one because there were not any reviews on it yet, plus the ingredients sounded so good.  I followed everything as stated except I used low fat vanilla yogurt because it was all I had, and I added extra blueberries.  I made them for my husband this morning and sent some with him to his buddy's house.  He told me that one said, "What in the world did she put in these?  Because I think she added some heaven".  And I gave some to my brother & sister-in-law, and they said that they were the best blueberry muffins they had ever had too.  So, I would say that this is a keeper :)

Thank you!

I made these this morning because I had some peach yogurt to use up. They turned out great! I used all brown sugar in mine.

I took the advice of using only brown sugar. I also used strawberry light-and-fit yogurt and substituted vanilla for the almond extract. The muffins were moist and delicious. Everyone enjoyed the muffins.

I truly hate to rate these so low & I've gone over the recipe many times to see if I did something wrong. I followed this word for word, other van using low fat vanilla yogurt in place of plain. The topping is delicious, the muffins baked up beautifully(really, the prettiest muffins I've ever made) & I LOVE the fact that they don't use lemon. That being said, they did not come out very moist, the batter was sooooo dry I had trouble incorporating the blueberries without smashing them & the muffins are tasteless. Another submitter used brown sugar in place of white....maybe that's the key. I'm sorry :(

The dough was super chunky, not like a batter at all. Even with the yogurt, it needed some oil or applesauce. I do like the almond topping. I also like the low sugar flavors. I don’t know what I did ‘wrong’ but I’m not giving these out tomorrow.

Amazing!! Super soft and tasty! Nutmeg adds a little extra and it’s delicious. If you’re not a fan of it, maybe cut it in half. Didn’t put almonds on top, didn’t have any and I’m not a fan of nutty muffins. I’ll be making these again!!

Batter was very thick.  Added some milk until it was the right consistency.

Bland flavor even with extra blueberries. I tried to stay with the recipe, but the batter was so thick as others have stated that I ended up adding an extra few tbsp of yogurt until the consistency was right. Also after adding the 1 cup of blueberries it seemed like it was lacking blueberries, so I added an extra 1/2 cup. Maybe my fresh blueberries were just big and fat so 1 cup wasn't enough. They cooked up nicely at 375, but were done in about 17 minutes instead of the 20 recommended. I think I might try with the brown sugar as others have suggested or just try another recipe altogether.
Added notes after eating a few more...
The blandness comes from the muffins not being sweet enough. Funny because when I was putting the 1/4 c of sugar I did a double check thinking was was such a minimal amount for muffins. Will try again with more sugar.

This was my first time ever making blueberry muffins. I decided this one cuz I love the strusel topping. These turned out moist and delicious. They're not overly sweet, the strusel adds a crunchy sweet bit. I followed it directly. I used a mixture of vanilla, strawberry, raspberry and blueberry yogurt (I had cups for lunches not a tub) and I added extra berries. I didn't realize the batter was so thick so I just added extra yogurt to lose it but it also just kept the extra moisture in. I'd recommend this to anyone.

Made a first batch this morning. I used all brown sugar per one review. They are great! Gave away the first batch and made another double batch this afternoon. I used crushed walnuts in one batch, and added 2tbsp raspberry jam to another batch. All great! Moist and just sweet enough. Love the small amt of sugar. Keep for sure.
