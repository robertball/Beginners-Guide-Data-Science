I didn't have wild raspberries.I used store bought raspberries. I took the suggestion from submitter. I added more berries and omitted the cinnamon. It was creamy and refreshing.

I'm the submitter of this recipe and I would like to state that I tried to delete the cinnamon but my edit didn't take prior to my recipe being published.

Made this recipe for my husband and he said the texture and flavors are so good. So good as in I'm going to have to make more tomorrow! I used 2 cups of sugar free frozen berries (defrosted) and followed the recipe as written. No need to change anything! I don't have an ice cream maker, but I knew my Ninja Pro could make ice cream.  I probably should have checked out their site first as it would have saved me some time, perhaps. After letting the mixture cool in the fridge, I poured it into ice cube trays and put them in the freezer. Once frozen, popped the cubes in the Ninja and pulsed away. Poured/spread it into a cold bread pan and popped it in the freezer.  Glad I did make it this way though to get the seeds out. This is going to be even better for a nice treat in the coming weeks when my fruit loving hubs gets 5 teeth removed! Thank you for the recipe Shorecook!

Good, captures the tartness of the berries. It would be neat to find a use for the pulp left from straining.
