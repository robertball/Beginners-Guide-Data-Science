Delicious! my only suggestion would be that when you blenderize the kiwis with honey, puree the kiwis first, THEN put the honey in.  i put the honey in first, and it all sunk to the bottom of the processor.

I didn't take the seeds out of the kiwis... how do you even do that?  Being new to puff pastry, I didn't let it rise enough so it was doughy and not big enough to fit all of the strawberry filling.  All in all, it was a good recipe and I might try it again.

Wow! I made these tartlets for my foods class and they were awesome. The glaze on the shells was amazing. They were a tad messy when eating but so worth it!

Good solid dessert.  I didn't think the kiwi/honey combo was as good as plain kiwi would have been.  Also a little messy/tough to eat.  Overall the taste was good. I added a bit more sugar to the whip cream and doubled the amount of whip cream suggested in order to have enough whip cream for all six that I made.  In short, good, but I'll probably try a few other strawberry desserts before returning to this one.

These were very good and my family thought that I bought them at the store!  Maybe I should be offended...anyway, they turned out great!

This recipe is good, however the kiwi sauce was a bit tart for my taste. Perhaps my kiwis were not ripe enough. But even without the sauce, this makes a great and pretty easy dessert.

These were great and really easy to make.  I did everything according to the recipe, but the kiwis at our local market looked really bad, so I used mangoes instead.  I brought them to a get together and they were gone right off!  Thanks for sharing!

I used the recipe for the idea and took of with my own version. I used puffed pastry in the Pampered Chef tart pan, omitted the Kiwi and Honey part.  Then used a tub of  Fat Free cool whip with 1/2 tsp cinnamon for the topping.    I got rave reviews but I will try again.

This was a fantastic snack! It was easy to make and it tasted wonderful! Except how do you take the seeds out of the kiwis? I just cut them out in a way! Then again it was very good and I plan on making it again sometime!

This was good recipe but when I was making it we couldnâ€™t find the correct puff pastry and so we made it with puff pastry sheets. It came out good anyway. It was sweet and tart and the whipped cream added extra flavor and it was very nice alltogether.
