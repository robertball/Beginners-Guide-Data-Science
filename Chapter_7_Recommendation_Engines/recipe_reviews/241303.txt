This recipe was a fun twist on traditional cornbread and a creative way to use up ripe bananas. I did change one item. I used brown sugar instead of white and only used 3/4 cup. Cornbread turned out moist, full of flavor and was a hit at the potluck. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!

Okay. I'm just saying... it has been weeks since I made this and I am sitting here looking at the recipe and I find myself beginning to salivate. It isn't natural to want something this much. LOL Nice job, easy, fast and just worthy of medals and prizes and sainthood.

I read the previous reviews and tweaked the recipe as follows: I used 4 medium bananas instead of 2, 1 tsp of salt instead of 2tsp, 1/3 cup vegetable oil and 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of 2/3 cup oil, 1 cup of light vanilla soy milk and 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk instead of 2 cups of milk, and 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup raw honey instead of 1 1/3 cup sugar. I also combined all the wet ingredients and dry ingredients separately and then added them together because I feel like it makes sure everything is mixed together more accurately. I used a 9X13 glass baking dish and adjusted the temperature to 325° instead of 350° because glass heats up faster than metal. It took about 35 minutes to cook. The cornbread came out really tastey. Still not very banana-y flavored which is good, but so moist and heavy. Good with a cup of coffee or tea! I would definitley make it again.

Instead of a dish of cornbread,  made corn muffins (always have some in the freezer) baked in mini muffin pans.  I halved the recipe, baked at 400°F for 10 minutes, and ended up with 30 mini muffins.  The recipe doesn't state what to do with the banana, but I assumed it was to be ripe and  mashed.  I'm sure part of the reason these muffins are so moist is the banana, but that flavor is subtle.  My banana  was VERY ripe and sweet, and I did cut back the sugar because we like things less sweet (personal taste preference).  These turned out perfectly tender, full of flavor,  and are very simple to make, so thumbs up in this house.

This is delicious! We are trying to eat clean so I substituted 1 cup of brown rice flour and 1 cup of flaxseed meal for the flour and a mix of coconut oil and butter for the vegetable oil. Also, 1/2 cup sucanat and 1/2 cup honey for the white sugar. I also used coconut milk and regular milk in place of all milk and drizzled honey on the finished product. I will definitely make this again, my family loves it!

Very good recipe. I doubled the banana and cut the sugar in half.  Love that it is vegan. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe!  The most moist cornbread I ever had.  I was very surprised to taste the moistness the banana made this.  This bread can be used as part of a dessert.  Maybe with baked bananas with cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, maple syrup.  Yum!

Made 1/2 recipe as suggested and drizzled the honey over it after baking, as suggested.  Great!

Since I didn't have regular cornmeal, I used a box of Jiffy cornbread mix, which was slightly under 2 cups, so I added a little more flour to the mix. Also, since Jiffy is sweet, I used only 1 cup sugar (instead of 1-1/3 cups) and reduced the baking powder from 7 tsp to 5. It turned out really light and delicious - hubby thought it could use a little more banana flavor, so I may add 1 tsp of banana extract next time, but otherwise it was wonderful!

Really enjoyed this recipe with a few alterations. As others suggested, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of white, four bananas instead of two, and I added about 2 tsp of cayenne pepper for the heck of it. Made mini muffins, which reduced my bake time to about 16 minutes @ 350.

Super easy and came out delicious. I added a cup of sour cream to make it extra moist. Can't really taste the banana too much but I like it that way. This is gonna be my go to recipe since I looove me some cornbread.

I love this!  Have made it many times and because it makes a lot, I share it with friends who love it too.  Only substitution is soy milk because I have a dairy intolerance.

I tweaked this a bit, swapped veg oil for coconut oil, and used raw cane sugar. I added some cinnamon, Himalayan pink salt,  3-4 tablespoons dark cocoa powder and sprinkled finely chopped walnuts on top. Turned out like a delightful chocolate nutty banana bread of sort. Yum!!

Turned out okay - made muffins out of it, followed the same recipe instructions though (30 mins at 350 F). Made 24 regular size muffins. A little crumbly just like cornbread. We couldn't really taste the banana, so next time I will use twice the bananas. I used thawed bananas (overripe-frozen) that I mashed up before mixing in last.
