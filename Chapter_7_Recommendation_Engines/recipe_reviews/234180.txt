We enjoyed the flavors, and the chicken came out very moist.  I doubled the recipe and cooked a few on medium and a few on medium-high and I think we prefer them darker/crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, so I think the best way to do this is to cook them in the butter for approximately two minutes on medium-high until each side is crispy and blackened and then pour in the marinade, turn the heat to medium, cover, and cook for about 5-7 minutes until the marinade and chicken reach 165 degrees.  I used the "Taco Sauce" recipe from this site as the first ingredient which lent a nice flavor to the dish and served this with a side of mashed potatoes (because my husband eats them with every meal) topped with "Easy Black Beans and Tomatoes" from this site.  I also made a spinach salad as an additional side.  Overall, it was a nice weekday dinner (quick and easy), and my husband said the flavor of this chicken is one of his favorites.  So happy we made extras for leftovers!

I made burritos with it by adding it to rice, cilantro, tomatoes and fried onions.
