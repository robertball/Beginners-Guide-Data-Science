This is a great recipe, but I combined it with another one that I found so I'll let you know my helpful tips.  I used the maraschino cherries that have the stems still on them, it made it so easy to dip them in chocolate.  Plus people will know that they are homemade.  You use less chocolate this way as well.  I still used slightly more chocolate than the recipe called for, but not much more as you can shake them off a little bit by holding onto the stem and spinning them.  I also soaked my cherries in Taylor's Port for a couple of days before hand.  This makes them a delicacy.  The alchohol combines with the fondant that you wrap around the cherries and makes a great cordial.  It also cuts down on the extreme sweetness of the fondant.  This recipe would not have been as good without it.  I wrapped my cherries in the fondant and then froze them on a cookie sheet for a couple of days before dipping them, that way they were good and hard.  I had no trouble with them melting.  To wrap the fondant around the cherries with out it sticking to your fingers, it is best to spray your hands with nonstick spray several times throughout the process.  It is also good to blot the excess moisture off the cherries with a paper towel after draining them from the Port.  I tried dusting my hands with powdered sugar too, and that didn't work as well as the spray.  After these were cooled, I arranged them in little foil cups like miniature cupcake cups and placed them in Candy boxes that you can

Living in Saudi Arabia you can’t find chocolate covered cherries so when my father was visiting – I tried  making these.  They are time consuming and you need to allow at least a week to allow them to age but so worth the effort!

Here are my best pointers:  1)  drain and blot dry the cherries, then freeze them on cookie sheets.  2)  Divide the fondant into four equal pieces and then after lightly dusting it, roll it onto an arm’s length piece of wax paper that you will fold in half.  Then turn the fondant over and dust it on the other side so that it won’t stick and place between the two sheets of waxed paper.  Stack the layers in the fridge.  3)  Take out 10 – 20 cherries from the freezer and use a 2” biscuit cutter to get the right amount of fondant.  MAKE SURE THE CHERRY IS SEALED WELL and then freeze the fondant rolled cherries overnight.  4)  When you are ready to dip them, take them out 10 – 20 at a time use a good quality semi sweet chocolate. (Candy dipping tools makes it easier although I've used chopsticks before I had those...) Place in the freezer for 15 minutes and then paint the bottom with chocolate again to seal in the fondant.  You might need to “repair” other places that were not covered by the chocolate to keep the cherries from oozing.  I then allow them to freeze overnight and then place them on the counter under saran for 1 week after giving my family the “don’t you dare touch them” look.
I will redip them after the week to make them look fresh.

I read many different recipes before trying my hand at making chocolate covered cherries.  They're my Dad's -FAVORITE- and I decided to make them from scratch this year instead of buying them (which has been a Christmas tradition ever since I can remember).  This recipe ROCKS.  He absolutely loved them (and I can honestly tell you he is VERY picky about his chocolate covered cherries! -and would have been honest about what could have been done differently 'next time' to make them better).   **My advice for making them (I read a VERY complex review before making them and thought it would take me a whole day just to put them together...) however, my success (which came without the ultra-complicated procedure) was guaranteed with this recipe (it's really, really easy-just a little time intensive when wrapping the cherries).  Hints: *Do start with a pan that will fit in your freezer, lined with Parchment Paper* 1. Always use REAL butter (nothing is like REAL butter- nothing).  2. Don't let your cherries dry out like crazy dry before you wrap them.  Make sure the outside is really dry so the 'dough' will wrap around it well, but the juice that's still inside the cherries lends to the 'liquification' process that happens in the next few days.  3. Don't use a huge amount of dough around each cherry.  I found that using about 1/8 inch (and of course, I'm NOT measuring...just eyeball it & don't pack it on like a golfball  :)  this stuff is really rich -and delicious- but RICH...and yo

Great recipe. Whoever had problems b/c she melted butter with the chocolate -- NEVER melt butter with chocolate. You MUST use shortening. The high water content (20%) makes the chocolate freeze up and you'll ruin the entire batch.

This recipe is AWSOME!  I made it for valentines day and was greeted with rave reviews.  After reading several other reviews I used the idea to soak some of the cherries for 24hrs in different kinds of alchohol such as rum, cognac and port, then made mixed boxes as gifts (Hint: use white chocolate to create identifying marks on each flavor). Since it was only about 4 days from creation to consumption the centers hadn't completely liquified but no one minded; however, I will definately make them further in advance next time.  I agree the fondant should be cut in half and the chocoate doubled (at least). I also rolled out the fodant between wax paper to 1/4" thick and used a 1 inch round cookie cutter to get the perfect uniform amount of filling.  This one will be made again and again.

I have given my children a box of chocolate covered cherries for Christmas, almost every year of their lives. Thought it would be neat to make them homemade this year. These are definitely more fun to make it if you make it a two-person job & add a glass of wine onto the ingredient list. ;o) I drained my cherries, patted them dry & then layed them out on a  parchment paper covered baking sheet & froze them for a couple of hours. Then I made up the fondant (cut recipe in half if you don't want extra for later), wrapped the cherries & then froze overnight. I only pulled a dozen or so out of the freezer at a time to dip (I did use stemmed cherries...very easy to dip). I used ghiradelli double chocolate dipping chocolate & just kept it over a double boiler while we dipped. Drizzled a bit of ghiradelli white chocolate over all once they were dry. Hubby wasn't as conscientious as I about using a thin layer of fondant so next time I might enlist the help of someone else or do it myslef. LOL You really do need to be careful & avoid excess or it's like "find the cherry in the fondant". I saved the remainder of the fondant & I think I will use it w/ some cherries soaked in brandy or port as suggested by some reviewers. Can't wait to give these to my kids...thanks Kathy Nowell!

5-star taste, 4-star rating because of excess fondant quantity. Scaled to 16 servings to = one 10 ounce bottle of stemmed cherries. 4 ounces of confectioners sugar = 1 cup. Also, easy to do chocolate in microwave on 30 second bursts--no need for double boiler. You will need WAY more chocolate than recipe calls for.

I have made a recipe similar to this for some years but tried this and it worked great.  It is not a difficult recipe, but you should plan on taking some time out to make them, or do as I did and wrap and freeze the cherries one day and then dip another.  In order to make sure that the batter does not stick, you must make sure to drain your cherries VERY well, and if need be, dust your hands with powdered sugar as needed.

This recipe..yes, is time consuming..So, if you want something quick..just buy them. But, they are worth the time. They taste awesome. The only thing I will do differently next time is to wrap the cherry thinly with the fondant and leave the stem on. Very, Very GOOD! I gave it four stars because the measurements were alittle off.

I couldn't get the dough to thicken so I was unable to "knead" it, no matter how much powdered sugar I added. What a waste of ingredients!  I'll just buy chocolate covered cherries from now on!

It does NOT form dough, it is impossible to form them around the cherries, and IF you can, it just melts when you remove from freezer.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Some of my tips would be...I only used 2 jars of cherries, so I did about 2/3s of the recipe. I could have used a little more fondant. I had about 1 doz cherries left without fondant. 2 jars equals about 100 cherries.  The chocolate is way off.  I used about 5-6 cups of chocolate.  I slightly dried the cherries on a paper towel and I did soak in a rum overnight, too. I didn't have any trouble with the fondant sticking to my fingers, but rubbed butter on them ever couple cherries.  My cherries didn't have stems, so I froze them with toothpicks in them.  I found it easy to take a few cherries wrapped in fondant out of the freezer at a time, like other people had said. I used the toothpick to dip them in the chocolate, shook off the excess chocolate by tapping toothpick on side of bowl.  When I set down on the wax paper, I slid the toothpick off.  Then I dipped the toothpick back in chocolate and smoothed it over the hole it left in the top.  It made a fancy swirl that really impressed my kids!!  My 4 year old loved licking the chocolate off all the toothpicks when I was done!  I went back after a couple days and checked the bottoms for leaks.  I only had a few.  I just swirled a little more chocolate on and set to dry!  These are perfect!!  I can't wait to give as gifts!

Exellent! Very time consuming but i was suprised at how pretty they looked on my first try. A few tips: spray your hands with cooking spray to keep it from sticking to the white dough. Also once you have wrapped the cherries, freeze them before dippng them in chocolate. Makes them so much easier to dip. To dip them, i found it easiest to use a different toothpick for each one. I put the toothpick in them, rolled them in the chocolate and placed them on a cookie sheet with the toothpick still in. I put them in the freezer again and then removed the toothpicks. I found it was easier to make them stay up this way and most of the chocolate got covered and looked quite pretty. Much more chocolate is also needed then it calls for. Overall, very time consuming but so tasty!i probably won't make them again for a long time as i dont have that much time to devote to making food...

WOWOW! Awesome recipe! I drained my cherries and soaked them in brandy for 1 wk, drained them again and lay them on paper towels while I wrapped them in the dough. It is easier to dip them in the chocolate if you freeze them solid and just pick them up by poking them with a tooth pick, after the cherry is covered just use a spoon to pop it off and drizzle a little chocolate on top to cover the hole. Letting them sit will liquify the dough...YUMMY!! ;-)

What a mess!  Recipe didn't bother to mention that the moment you remove the cherries from the freezer they begin to melt.  After the first 10 were chocolate coated, the rest were oozing masses of goo.  I had to throw them - as I did with the recipe. Big waste of time and even bigger waste of money.

These were sooooo delicious.  I tried making them last Xmas with a different recipe and I ruined them because I added too much was to the chocolate.  I love this recipe.  Very Yummy.  I added a bit of cherry juice to the fondant centers for a bit of flavor.  I will definitely be making these again.

I found that wearing vinyl disposable gloves lightly spritzed with baking spray with flour (from aldi) makes the dough much easier to handle.  I love this recipe, I only use 4 tblsp of corn syrup though.  I drain the cherry juice and marinate the cherries with 1 tsp. almond extract and 1/2 tsp. orange extract (or orange liqueor) overnight in the refrigerator.  I drain the extract liquid into a little cup and put it in the dough mixture before I roll the cherries in it.  Love it!

Very delicious!  Best tips for making this recipe:  After preparing the fondant mixture,form into small balls. Keep most of the fondant in the fridge to stay cool while wrapping the cherries.    Use the bottom of a glass to press fondant balls, wrap the fondant, around the cherry and place back into fridge.  When dipping the cherries in chocolate, dip them two separate times to prevent the cherry juice from leaking.

Overall, very good.  There was too much fondant, but half wasn't quite enough.  Be very careful to dry the cherries well.  If they stay a little wet, the fondant won't really stick, and the chocolate really won't stick.  I'd leave the shortening out of the chocolate.  I had trouble with the chocolate just not sticking to the fondant-covered cherries.  If there is a hole in your chocolate coating, the fondant will leak out once it liquefies.

These taste great! My only dissapointment is that the fondant has not turned to liquid like people say it will. I've had them stored for two weeks now, and it's still white fondant surrounding the cherry. Any one know how long it takes for them to liquify? Still, they are very tasty. I had to dip them twice for the bottoms to get completely covered with chocolate.

I have made this recipe a few times now - and it never, ever fails to impress.  I don't care for cherries myself - so I've never tried them but you should see the reactions of my guests!  They think I'm amazing! (and of course - It's rude to argue with your guests -ha).  I've made these for in between the cupcakes on a "Wedding (cupcake)cake and also for some special anniversary and birthday celebrations around town.  Last time I used real cherries (with pits) - and everyone still raved - but I have to admit it was a pain because I wa constanly telling people - Don't eat the pit!  Anyways - A really beautiful and delicious recipe!  I'd give 10 stars if I could!

I did not have a problem with the mess. I did half the fondant recipe but I used a small cookie scoop to portion the fondant and halved that, one scoop=2 cherries.  I put powdered sugar on my counter and my hands to prevent sticking.  I also used milk chocolate cand coating mixed with semi-sweet choc. chips to coat.  I did freeze the cherries before and after wraping.  They turned out great, not to sweet and the coating turned liquid within the chocolate just as it said it would! Perfect!

These cherries are really good.  I used the ones with stems as they were easier to dip.  They do make huge candies, though, and I wound up with more fondant than cherries.  Next time I will buy twice as many cherries & not put so much fondant around each cherry to make them smaller.  My father's comment was, "I think I will try one of these chocolate covered pears!"  I also used dark chocolate Wilton candy melts to dip the cherries in.  There were definately a big hit.

These taste great!  I needed more chocolate and added a little more shortening to thin the chocolate a bit, but they turned out very well!  I found that the easies way to dip them in the chocolate is to skewer them and dip then gently tap off the excess.  Be sure to spray your hands with nonstick spray before rolling the cherries in the dough, it makes life alot easier.  They aren't difficult to make and are already a new holiday favorite!

had a great time making these with the grandkids. Placed in ice cube trays to freeze, taking out 1 tray at a time to dip in the chocolate.  did have to double the chocolate amt to make it work out.  Had extra fondant which we rolled out between sheets of waxed paper, chilled for a while then spread it with peanut butter, rolled it up, then chilled and sliced for an extra treat.  yes my kitchen was a mess, but the kids loved it!

These were very good, but a little difficult to make.  I took the advise of another reviewer and froze the fondant and the cherries.  That made the process a lot easier, but it was still time consuming.  I also used a fraction of the fondant that the recipe called for.  I made three types: semi-sweet chocolate, white chocolate, and cherry-flavored chocolate.  I brought them to work for Valentine's Day, and disappeared quickly!

Great recipe.  I took another user's advice and soaked the cherries in port wine for two days.  I found that the fondant part of the recipe made A LOT.  I didn't use all of it. My step-father is going to LOVE these.  He is a BIG fan of port and chocolate covered cherries.

I have made these several times.  Everyone loves them, definately need more cherries & it is very messy & time sonsuming but it is well worth it.  I also make them a week or 2 in advance so they have time to liquify.

Absolutely amazing. I halved the recipe for the dough and had just enough to cover all of the cherries!

DEFINITELY keep spraying your hands with Pam or something while you're wrapping the cherries. After about seven cherries, I had to stop, run warm water over my hands and spray them before doing more. That may seem time consuming, but in the long run, it's quicker, because the dough goes on with very little trouble. I put the wrapped cherries in the freezer for two days. I used a ton of chocolate to coat them. I mixed chocolates, too. I started with chocolate bark, eventually combined it with semi-sweet choco chips, and ended with semi-sweet and milk choco mixed together--turned out wonderfully! 

My brother was rendered speechless for about thirty seconds after eating the first one. And if you know my brother, you know that's a miracle;)

I didn't like the condensed milk taste with the cherries.  When I make these now, I just use about 1/2 cup butter, melted, with about 1 - 2 teaspoons of almond extract (instead of vanilla) stirred into the butter, then and enough confectioner's sugar to make the 'dough' shapeable.  I usually let them sit for three days for the inside to 'set'.

WONDERFUL!!! I am so sorry that the first review is so negative.  These will become a holiday tradition at this home! Two minor suggestions for anyone nervous about trying these. First don't melt the butter to mix with the corn syrup, let sit at room temperature until very soft.  Next, keep your hands dusted with powdered sugar as you roll the fondant around the cherry.  The cherry juice tends to leak out fo the cherry and may make the fondant sticky.
WONDERFUL *******

We use this recipe for the dough but it works much better to use a dipping chocolate for coating. Also, the trick is to freeze the cherries before wrapping them in the dough...it makes the process much easier. Then chill the wrapped cherries before coating. We make 150 to 175 cherries with this recipe.

I quit wrapping cherries when I had 130 wrapped.  I still have some dough in my freezer.  Luckily I had the extra chocolate chips for all the extra cherries.  Giving it a 4 because the doughm, cherries and chocolate just dont add up correctly.

Very pretty and very time consuming.  Mine did not liquify - fondant stayed solid.  I think they would be better if it would have turned to liquid.  Taste was great and made everyone think I was a super-cook.  Thanks!

good flavor!needs some modifications though, the fondant needs to be rolled out thin between wax paper then wrapped around cherry-makes for a more uniform appearance (not golf ball sized) and the chocolate dip sauce came out spreading just enough to ruin the appearance, so i quickly switched to the micro melt choc found in your produce dept next to the fruit. also freezing does make it easer to work with. the "melt factor of fondant started on day 2 however it is so thick i doubt it will liquify by day seven..thinner fondant quicker liquify and hard to tell from the boxed version i had sitting next to them, of course doing comparison tasting!!

These are FABULOUS! Very time consuming, but worth it. They make a great gift. I used the stemmed cherries and it made them much easier to dip.
I bet if someone had a chocolate fountain, that would make the dipping go much quicker. 
ALSO, to the review who said butter makes chocolate seize up, it is WATER that makes chocolate seize, not butter. Butter is fat and works fine.

I changed several things.Almond for the flavoring. Dark chocolate bars 70% cocoa for the dipping and drizzled them with melted white chocolate.   Now we are waiting for the magic to happen. Yes I have allready tried them who can resist? Thank You for giving me a recipe I am proud to share with family and friends.

These candies are so delicious but they are also VERY VERY sweet. Next time I will only add a little of the fondant to the cherries instead of wrapping the whole thing. They also taste much better than the store bought ones and are quite easy to make, just a bit messy.

This is the best!  I have made about 8 dozen cherries this year off one recipe of this fondant!  I agree with the other reviewers that spraying your hands with cooking spray helps tremendously!  I use the butter flavor...it adds more to the recipe I think!  Also it's easy to make a jar and freeze them until your ready to dip.  I hope you and your family enjoys this recipe as much as my family does!  Merry Christmas!

These are awesome little treats. Suggestions: cut the dough recipe into a fourth of what it is for the same amount of cherries. I had sooo much left over. Soak cherries in brandy overnight for a zing. Use dried cherries and fresh cherries for something different, they are all good! Use ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips for an expensive taste :)

Excellent!  I made these for a party and what a hit.  next time I'm going to halve the "dough" and use one jar of cherries.   I would reccomend coating your hands with powdered sugar when you get ready to assemble.

To the reviewer who had problems with the fondant sticking to their fingers, try using powdered sugar on your hands and any work surfaces, like you would use flour for bread or cookie dough.

If I could I would give this recipe a zero. It was a mess! the cherries didn't even turn out right, a few did but most did not. I should have cut this batch in half but I didn't. The results don't justify the mess.

Double YUM!  You can easily cover 6 jars of cherries with the amount of fondant, and I needed 3 bags of chocolate chips for 3 jars of cherries.  These are delicious, and they have been added to my list of annual treats to make :)

Fantastic recipe.  Be sure to keep the dough thin around the cherries.  Othewise you end up with very large, super-sweet cherry cordials.  I also suggest chololate bark or candy melts in place of chocolate chips and shortening.  Definately freeze the cherries prior to dipping.  Everyone will love them.

PROS: Tastes like store bought. Makes very large candies. Flavors meld nicely when stored for a week and the centers turn runny. Yum!
CONS: Very time consuming...altho, I used chocolate flavored almond bark for the coating which saved some time.

These were good but kinda sweet.I had trouble dipping them because the dough kept melting,so I used the corn-on-the-cob-sticks and stuck them in the cherries and spooned the chocolate over them.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!!  It does take some time to make but it is definitely worth it!!  Make sure you have extra chocolate on hand because you will need it!!  Also I placed the covered cherries on baking sheets in the freezer to set before I covered them in chocolate, which made it easier to keep up with them before they started to melt.

Definitely a yummy recipe.  If you like the store bought chocolate covered cherries, you will love these!!!

This was such a great recipe.  The first time that I've ever made chocolate covered cherries!  It made a perfect christmas gift!  The dough was at first a little hard to handle, but after it settled, it molded into the cherry fine.  A whole lot more chocolate is needed though than what is called for.  Other than that, what a treat!

Will make again!  These were a Christmas tradition at my house growing up so it was fun to try to make some.  Not hard, but is an act of love and takes some time so skip if your in a hurry. I followed recipe exactly with one exception.  I marinated half of the cherries in amaretto.  These marinated cherries seemed to be easier to work with then the plain ones.  I agree with others that there is way too much fondant and to try to use it all would result in candy the size of goofballs or larger. You can cut this in half and still have plenty.  I regulated size of fondant by using the large size of my Mellon ball scoop.  I rolled this in a ball and flattened with a glass.  I then used my small pastry roller to flatten out more.  I wrapped this around cherry and pinched off sides then smoothed out. It gave a very nice, even coating around the cherries.  I froze these for about an hour and took out in groups of ten and quickly dipped with a toothpick leaving top open like a buckeye ball (I used only two toothpicks for entire batch). I then went back and covered tops.  This worked well because if I put toothpick in too deep and juice started coming out top it did not mix in with chocolate and ruin it.  After they cooled in refrigerator for ten min I resealed the bottoms. Used 2x chocolate recommended and melted with wax instead of shortening as my family has done for years for a better set on chocolate. Fondant is nice and liquid after 2 days. Getting rave reviews.

Make this every year.  I only make two jars of cherries.  The rest of the fondant I mix with coconut flavoring and coconut-freeze and dip to make homemade mounds.  Or mix with pepermint and a drop or two of red coloring.  Make flattened discs and dip.  Peppermint patties!  Yummy too!

These turned out wonderful. The only things that I would have done differently is to use a very thin layer of the findant, and make them several weeks in advance so that the fondant has enough time to disslove and form the juicy part in the middle. I think that I made mine too thick and it took thema  while to for the juicy part. But they have been a big hit with family, friends, and co-workers for the past couple of weeks.

This was a great recipe! I made some for my mom to take to a christmas party and used the rest as Christmas presents and sweet treats for my brother around the house. I halved the fondant and still made three jars of cherries. My advice would be to drain the cherries and set them on paper towel to remove exess moisture. I also froze the fondant coverd cherries for a few hours which helped. I used a toothpick to dip the cherries in the chocolate (which by the way you will need alot more of)This was a great recipe and everyone loved it!

I really really really wanted to love these.  I was excited about making my Mother chocolate covered cherries for part of her Christmas present, they are her favorite.  Perhaps I can try these again and tweak them a bit, I think perhaps if I got less fondant on the cherries they would turn out better.  I have had mine sitting for two weeks and they are nice and gooey in the very center only, it was just hard to get less fondant on the cherries.  And it took a LOT more chocolate to coat than the recipe calls for, I might try again.  They turned out very pretty.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars because if the time it takes.  It is a rather involved candy.  I don't know if I did something wrong but it took me 3 bags of chocolate to coat the cherries.  Now for the good part, they taste great, look like a million and I will make again.  My Husband thinks they taste wonderful.  Give yourself enough time and work in a cool enviroment and enjoy.

This recipe is great!  I've never made chocolate covered cherries before.  I was very pleased with the results.  I thought the dough would be hard to work with, but it wasn't at all.  I drained the cherries and then patted them with paper towels to remove excess moisture.  The only problem is that I used at least twice the amount of chocolate that the recipe called for.

these were so good!  so easy to make... i made a few changes to the recipe.. i halved it because i made way too many the first time around... i also found the first ones a bit sweet/rich, so i added about half the juice from one of the jars of cherries....  this made the dough alot stickier so make sure to powder your hands well with sugar!  they froze just fine though.. the finished product was alot smooth and less "make your teeth hurt' sweet.. i think they will melt better, too when stored... all in all a delish recipe!  oh, and  used 4 cups of chocolate chips instead of two and i omitted the shortening, i just had no need for it...

These were great! A huge hit, especially during the holidays. The first review may be negative because they didn't weigh the powdered sugar? I had no problems. In future I would temper the chocolate though.

I made these tonight and they are excellent. Only thing I should of done before is to read the reviews, because I should of halved the dough part of it. I have a lot of that left and no cherries and no chocolate. It does take time to wrap the cherries but it is worth it. My husband already hid them so no one else can find them. LOL

This recipe turned out great.  I wasn't expecting much as this was my first attempt at anything like this, but the chocolate covered cherries taste just like the ones you buy from the store.  I had some difficulty handling the dough at first, but I devised a method of wrapping the cherries and from then on it was fun (if a little time consuming).  I have to remind my sister the cordials are gifts for others and not just herself.  Great recipe!

I had so many problems with this recipe! The fondant was sticking to my fingers so much that it was impossible to roll the cherry in the center. I tried wetting my hands but that just made the fondant thin. Also, when I melted the Toll House chocolate chips and butter, the chocolate became a big ball of gunk. My batch went to the trash.

This is the best recipe for chocolate covered cherries that I've found!  I love making them in advance and freezing the dough-covered cherries.  I pull out as many as I need and dip them in chocolate for a very FRESH flavor.

These turned out great! They reminded me of the "Sees Candy" that my family used to make, only no coconut, just a cherry in the middle. My 8 year old daughter enjoyed rolling them with me.

the recipe calls for too much milk, unable to mold around cherries.

I made this recipe using cherries I had soaked in bourbon. They are delicious. I would cut the fondant recipe in half as it made way too much. But I’m using the leftover fondant to make coconut bonbons.

Wonderful recipe. My best tips are: 1)DEFINITELY get cherries with stems, saves so much work. And 2) don't dry the cherries, it makes the center liquefy faster.

Too much fondant for amount of cherries listed. When allowed to set for a couple of weeks to liquify, these are delicious!
