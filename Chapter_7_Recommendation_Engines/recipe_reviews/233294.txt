I had a flank steak that needed used up, so I made this recipe on a whim. We really enjoyed this, my husband kept going back for more. I didn't have any strong beer on hand, just a Bud, so that's what I used and it was just fine. This was a nice change of pace from my usual flank steak preparation.

This was amazing! Loved the deep richness of the molasses and beer. I used Autumn Maple Ale which blended well with the flavors, I let this marinate overnight. The grill marks lent for a nice presentation and it was so flavorful. I mistakenly purchased a top sirloin instead of flank steak and was pleasantly surprised, when sliced very thin, I actually prefer it's slight chewiness (the price was right, too!). I mixed up a 1/2 cup lite sour cream, a teaspoonful or so of both Dijon & horseradish, a bit of honey and spooned a ribbon down the center of the sliced meat on each plate. Thanks, Chef John, this is a keeper and I am anxious to grill the other steak I have in the freezer already in the marinade.

Three out of four in our household liked this.  One thought the  cinnamon and allspice were too much.  I personally liked the addition of these spices and the depth of flavor they gave to the dish.  Maybe next time I will reduce them so we will all be happy.  It was a very good meal and I will definitely make it again.

I used bison flank steak instead of beef, not an issue because the marinade is what you really taste anyway.  IMO the cumin, allspice, cinnamon spices really ramp up the flavor on this, and they do dominate, perhaps just a little too much for us.

Didn't need to use the cinnamon, allspice and the cumin. I used Guinness and black strap molasses and marinated the Flank Steak overnight and it was fantastic!

This was very well liked by my family and was not a lot of trouble to make. I like the idea of boiling the marinade to use as a basting sauce instead of just pouring all that flavour down the drain.  Thanks!

I don't like the sauce and flavour but appreciate the method for marinating and grilling.  Will try with a different sauce.

This is delicious!  My entire family of six...ranging in age from nine to age seventy...loved it.  I prepared it exactly as Chef John's receipe suggested...used an instant read thermometer to test for internal temperature, let it rest ten minutes before slicing and the steaks were perfect.

Followed the recipe without the cinnamon, allspice, and cumin per the reviews.  Unfortunately, it was not hit.  The meat was quite sweet with the beer and the molasses running the flavor show and taking over the meat.  If you like a sweetness in your meats this might work for you but, if not, then find another recipe.  The methodology was spot on so the meat was very tender but the deep sweet flavor profile was not for us.

Made as written and is very tasty and tender.  I used Guinness beer and on a gas grill it took quite a bit longer than 5 minutes per side but it turned out perfect.  You can really taste the cinnamon and allspice and it was definitely edible but kinda weird so I might leave those out next time or maybe just the cinnamon...but there will be a next time!

I used tritip instead of a beef flank, marinated for 12 hours, and it came out so well! I'm going to pair it with some potatoes and asparagus this time.

We did not care for the flavor of this meat.  I think the molasses, cinnamon and allspice were the culprits for the unpleasant (in our opinion) taste.  I will not be keeping this recipe in my collection.

Pretty easy to make and the results are delicious. I still struggle getting grill temps right and that affected cooking times. I only grilled on 3 sides for 7.5 minutes total before the basting cycles and the diamond grill marks are more like a char web on one side. The steak is tender and the sauce is savory and rich.

Yum! Whole family liked. Forking it so much with the marinade really helps tenderize this cut as well as make it tasty. I used a bottled bbq sauce plus all the seasonings and a strong tan ale. Marinated about 5-6 hours. Grilled over high propane grill 5 min each side per Chef John instruction. Turned out perfect.

I used apple cider vinegar rather than red wine vinegar. I marinated it for 8 hours and it was delicious!!!  Good flavor and almost fork tender!  Will definitely do again!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated except I used a 2 lb. flank steak and thought this was amazing. The marinade/basting sauce was really flavorful. I was worried after reading reviews that it might be too sweet or have a weird flavor but it was great.  I used Guinness and marinated overnight. I will definitely be making this again.

Made this sauce as written but it was much more bitter than expected and ruined the taste of the steak.

Did not have cumin - still great flavors.  To be redone.  Also served the suggestion for sauce i.e. sour cream, honey, mustard

I'm used to flank steak being rolled with things like bacon with hollandaise and tarragon as its sauce. This was okay. But no more using flank steak when you can use a London broil!
Again, the leftovers, not used to it!

Followed directions exactly for Fathers Day dinner.   I thought it sounded different and interesting.  Did not like the results a lot.  I don't know if it was the cinnamon or the all spice, or what, but the finished product brought out a resounding 'meh' from the family. Looked beautiful and was perfectly done, but the flavor was not for me.  I would not make this again.

This was fairly easy to make and I thought it would be a typical bbq flavor, but was pleasantly surprised with the beer addition. Comparisons between this marinade and another home made teriyaki marinade, at a party, all the guests were stating they liked THIS marinade best! I will make it again!
