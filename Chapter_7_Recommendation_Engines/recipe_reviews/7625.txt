I just made this cake and I must say its great unlike others have said I don't think it came out dry at all and the center was cooked perfectly. Its light, fluffy and has a nice texture. I myself doing a slightly more low carb baking style, replaced the 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup splenda baking blend. And cooked it for about 32 minutes. So altogether a great cake.

This cake was pretty tasty. The only problem I had was that it tasted a little dry. I would try baking it for 5 or so minutes less. I tried it with "Cool Whipped Frosting," and they went together very well. My family liked it as well.

This cake is awesome! I was looking for a quick cake recipe for my son's 4th birthday. It was easy to make, followed the recipe exactly. Yummy!!! Light, delicate, fluffy, and just the right sweetness.

I will definitely be using this for my "standard" white cake recipe. Thanks!!

Easy, delicious cake!  I made it because I had a large carton of heavy whipping cream I needed to use up and was really happy with the way this turned out.  Very light and much better tasting than store-bought cake mix.

This cake is excellent! The more days that go by the more it tastes like a pound cake. It also freezes well. Perfectly moist, reminded me of a wedding cake flavor.

I didn't care for this cake at all. It tasted just like Jiffy muffin mix to me. Not a good thing to make cupcakes out of. They fell completely apart and the edges were very crispy. I will keep looking for a good cake recipe.

It's still in the oven, but as far as being easy to make, it's been fine.  The 9inch pan was not large enough, and now my oven needs cleaning, and my house smells, but hopefully it will be tasty after the mess is cleaned up.  I'll edit my review upon completion...

Think I found my go-to homemade cake recipe! Followed the recipe exactly as listed and it turned out beautifully moist with a good flavor. I doubled this to make a two-tier cake and had enough for two 9" pans and a dozen cupcakes.

I made this and the texture was fine.  I used lemon flavoring instead of vanilla.  Good tasting cake. Quick and easy.

WOW! This cake is delicious.  It tastes like a gourmet split between wedding cake and pound cake.  I put it in a 8x8x2 square pan and it made a thick cake.  Delicious!

My mom used to make a cake with whipping cream.  Her recipe is impossible to decipher ("half carton this and a pinch of that...").  This recipe came closest.  First time for me making cake from scratch and this turned out just as good as my mother's!!  I did not have cake flour so I substituted 1 1/2 all-purpose minus 2 tbs and added 2 tbs of corn starch (something I found on the internet).  And I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cups.  My mother usually baked hers at 375 for about 25minutes.  It turned out wonderful and even better the next day!! I will be making this again and again!

ok - but nothing really special.  Hubby thinks it's better than box, but I prefer the flavor and texture of box.  This is certainly an easy recipe.

Overall it was a good cake. A little eggy. I cooked it for 5 minutes less than the recipe required as someone had suggested. it was still quite raw in the middle. i left it in the oven for 10 mins more, when it came out i tried a piece of the cake while it was hot, but didnt like the texture. i let it cool in the fridge, then ate it with butter and tea. kind of reminded me of a biscuit style cake. would go well with a rich, and creamy frosting.

I found this recipe because I had already whipped cream left over and needed to do something with it so I put whipped cream into the search bar. I settled on this recipe and I'm SO GLAD I did! 
It's very forgiving. The recipe calls for 1 C whipping cream. Mine was already whipped and since it was leftovers I really didn't know how much liquid cream I started out with. AND it already had sugar in it so I just threw a little bit more in. AND I was cleaning up and saw that I'd forgotten to add the vanilla! The batter had been in the oven just 2 minutes so I pulled it out, sprinkled some vanilla on top & gently mixed it in.
Cooked exactly 35 min. ~ cooled and IT'S WONDERFUL! Sort of the consistency of angel food but much better tasting!
I didn't make cupcakes. Put the batter in an 8 x 8 pan. It doesn't need icing.

This turned out great! Very nice cake texture. I set my timer for 30 minutes with the thought that I could leave it in longer if needed. Glad I did this because it was done at 30 minutes using a dark non-stick round cake pan.

This recipe is awesome. I almost never use a homemade recipe for cakes because they never turn out light or moist. This cake, although the batter was thick, made a fluffy and airy cake that made my husband say "yum!"

I was looking for a recipe to use some whipped cream that was near expiry, I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. I must say I was very surprised that it tasted so good. This is now a favourite in my home. Everyone loved it.

I made white bread and corn bread before, but this is the first time I make a cake. I baked it for 25 minutes instead of 35 based on my limited baking experience, the cake came out fine with a bit crust outside, but I didn't feel its dry inside like others said. thanks to my choice of a shorter baking time, I guess. my husband liked it. I will still need to find a better recipe though.

I gave it a 2 star rating ONLY because is was a very easy cake to make.  HOWEVER.....it was VERY dry.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  But I used 2 8 inch pans and baked at 325 for 20 minutes.  I don't believe I'll make this particular recipe again.
