FOR THOSE HAVING TROUBLE "SHAPING" THESE INTO EGG SHAPES, SIMPLY USE THE PLASTIC FILLABLE EASTER EGGS. OPEN THEM UP, PRESS MIX DOWN INSIDE, PLACE THEM ON A COOKIE SHEET IN THE FREEZER FOR A FEW MINUTES. TURN THEM OVER, TAP ON THE COOKIE SHEET, AND THEY FALL RIGHT OUT BEAUTIFULLY SHAPED LIKE HALF AN EGG...!!!!

Well... you just wouldn't believe what I did with this recipe!! First, I recognized this recipe to be very similar to 'buckeyes'.  So, I decided to make numerous easter eggs (like the size of a cadbury egg - with a flat bottom so they can stand on their own) and decorate them with different colored chocolates. I changed the recipe just alittle and added 1 t. vanilla. 1/2 creamy and 1/2 crunchy peanut butter AND I added about 1 cup of Rice Krispys.  After mixing, I shaped the eggs (I got 16 eggs from this recipe)  and put them in the freezer for about an hour.  I then dip each egg twice into the chocolate. (This takes a bit of time.) After that, I divided the white chocolate (& shortening) into smaller portions and added food coloring so I had White, Blue, Green and Pink colors.  Using a spoon and one color at a time, I 'sprayed' each egg using a swift motion back and forth across the pan the eggs were in.  I think they look very festive!! Happy Easter!

This is a great recipe! We made them for a housewarming party the day before Easter and everyone loved them. We used half creamy and half crunchy peanut butter and used that new Baker's dipping chocolate to coat them. We doubled the recipe and had about 35 eggs. It took 4 of the little dipping tubs to coat all of the eggs, but I found it a LOT easier. We also used a little of the chocolate to "stripe" the eggs by going back and forth very fast with a chocolate covered fork. They were very pretty. We put them in paper muffin liners since we were taking them to a party. One more note for the candy novices like me -- when you combine the ingredients it seems very dry, but it really holds the shape so don't be scared!

Awesome recipe!  What I was looking for and more!  I was in a pinch and needed to make my own PB Eggs, my kids said that these were "The Best"  I used a good quality peanut butter (Jif) not the cheap stuff. The better brand of PB gives these a more PB taste...which is what we want. Also instead of the semi sweet chocolate and shortening,  I went to a bulk food store and bought Milk Chocolate melting wafers. Very yummy! I already have had people requesting me to make these to sell and orders for next year. Wow! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!!  I'm sure these will become a tradition in my household :)

4.5 stars for me! Almost made ourselves sick from eating too many at one go!
I followed suggestions of melting the butter, and using crunchy PB, but mixture was still v. crumbly, so mixed in extra 1T milk and the mix came together. 

Eggs are very sweet (but SOOOOO yummy), so next time I will   use 1/2 c. less powdered sugar, and mixture probably won't be as crumbly.
V. easy to shape - this batch made 36 walnut sized eggs. Didn't need to freeze the eggs for an hour - 10 minutes chilling time and the eggs were good to dip. Adding melted shortening to the chocolate thins the chocolate and makes dipping easier. 2x10 year olds and 1x4 year old made the eggs and dipped them within 1.5 hours. Excellent recipe - a real keeper!!

I followed this recipe based on the reviews of 4-5 stars without actually reading the reviews.  After I made the eggs that turned out VERY dry and too sweet, I revisited the reviews to make sure I wasn't imaging that this recipe had received such high reviews.  I found that the majority of the 4 and 5 star reviews mention having to alter the recipe in some way to make up for the sweetness and dryness!  So, if you're thinking about making this recipe, please take the time to actually read the reviews and follow everyone's advice about adding more peanut butter or less sugar.  Unfortunately, I assumed that 4 or 5 stars meant that the recipe was a winner.

I made these eggs last night popped them in the fridge over night and coated them in the chocolate mixture this morning. Wish I had made them a little smaller than I did. Afeter chocolate coating them I put them in the fridge again while i melted some white chocolat with food coloring. Scooped this into a plastic baggie and swiped it across the eggs. Very pretty. Very tasty. Arranged on a plate with some green tinted coconut. Cant wait to hear my father in laws reaction!

What can I say besides OMG! These are so good! (My sister-in-law actually "swooned" after biting into one). To counteract the sweetness of the peanut butter mixture, I used bittersweet chocolate instead of semi-sweet to coat the "egg." The combination was to die for. Thanks so much for the recipe.

If you use the plastc easter eggs as a mold, here is an easy way to coat and shape your eggs: "paint" the inside of the plastic egg with melted chocolate.  Let the chocolate harden (the freezer speeds this up), then spoon in the PB filling.  Again, let the candy set and then add more chocolate to cover the PB filling.  Once the final layer is set, the candy will pop out of the mold in the perfect shape.  This is much easier than shaping and dipping, and it comes out looking perfect!

These were awesome!  Following the advice of others, I used crunchy peanut butter.  I did have to modify the recipe a little, as the mixture was extremely crumbly I had to add about an extra half cup of Peanutbutter.  After that the mixture worked out perfectly!

Instead of making eggs(Though I do plan to make them for easter)I made hearts for Valentines Day and gave them away, everyone who ate them liked them(My lil' hasn't ate his he's about as picky as they come!!!)But they tasted wonderfull and even without the peanut butter, which I left some uncoated to to me not using a double boiler and burning the chocolate, well my mom got to eat some since she eats no chocolate!!! Anyways the point is they're EASY to to make and they're delicious and they could be made for ANY occasion!!!

Absolutely delicious, peanut buttery and melt-in-your-mouth. Shaped them like buckeye balls and left upside without chocolate. Will definitely make them again. Hardly took me 10 minutes for shaping + 10 minutes one hour later to dip in chocolate.

I doubled this recipe and got about 36 eggs. I used a deviled egg tray to get the shape and freeze before coating with chocolate. Excellent recipe!

I've used this same recipe for years to make into balls at Christmas, and even into hearts for Valentine's Day.  One thing I do add in:  I use a small amount of "dry roasted" peanuts, which I have whirred in food processor until VERY finely chopped - almost "dust" (about 1/4 - 1/3 cup).  The saltiness and texture of the nut crumbs is very much like "Reese's" peanut butter cups.

These are delicious!  The filling was a little dry and crumbly as other reviewers mentioned, so I added half a cup more peanut butter and 4 tbl. of milk instead of one.  These are a memorable treat to everyone I've given them to!

The eggs were too dry to hold together.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  With it's rating, I didn't think I would have to read any reviews.  It seems many agree.  I was able to save it by following reviews.

I used an ice cream scoop that was like a half shape, w/o the mechanical part, so it made a pretty good egg shape with a fairly flat bottom. I made half with white choc and half with milk choc. and then pastel choc drizzled over top.

My first really successful attempt at making choclates of the 'coating' genre! I used 'Whole Earth - Smooth Peanut Butter with No Added Sugar' so that I could control the sweetness of these. I used almost 2 cups of confectioners' sugar and had no hassle with 'too sweet' and they were moist enough without adding the milk so I skipped that. I made these into small balls and managed 48 of these! I left them to freeze over night. And followed the coating instructions to the T. To decorate, I took the advice of other reviewers and melted white chocolate, poured it into a baggie and drizzled over the set chocolates! They were a hit on my Easter platter and I'm getting more requests to make these again! thank you Valerie for the lovely recipe! And thank you reviewers for your advises! (Btw, I haven't changed the recipe, I've only modified the sweetness or else they may have been tooo sweet!) :)

If making the smaller eggs, bypass trying to hand dip these, which is really fiddly and difficult, and buy a couple of inexpensive plastic candy molds from the craft store to use instead. I tried both ways and the molds were the easiest by far, especially as it becomes a fun project for the kids that way. Just coat the inside of the mold with chocolate, pat in a ball of filling, cover with more chocolate, then chill to set. We used colored candy melts to hand color the molds first. If you do hand dip, make sure to keep the eggs in the freezer and only take a few out at a time to dip as they soften extremely quickly and will turn to mush when you try to dip (at least they did for us). I would also use milk chocolate next time and reduce the butter in the filling as it was really soft and greasy.

Great recipe.  I doubled the recipe - added milk as needed.  Then I divided the dough into two circles.  Cut eight equal wedges and shaped each wedge into egg.  This way all the eggs were of equal size.  Froze them overnight.  Melted choc on top of stove.  Used two bags of semi sweet morsels and a couple of tablespoons of shortening.  Dropped them in the bowl of chocolate - turning to coat.  Used an off set spatula to pick them up and tapped the eggs on the side of the bowl to remove excess chocolate.  Put them in the freezer again overnight.  The next day - I melted some white chocolate in microwave - added food coloring and wrote each persons name on them (with a pastry bag).  I then used extra large cup cake liners, filled bottom with green (food color) coconut, and placed each egg on top.  Wrapped with a Easter themed plastic bag and tied up with curling ribbon.  Everyone said it was the best Easter gift they had received.

It was a rough week emotionally, so both Hubby and I needed a chocolate fix.  This was the only recipe I thought I could handle given lack of energy and emotional fortitude.  HA!  This is a winner!  I'm allergic to peanuts, so I substituted almond butter for the peanut butter, boosting the value of these suckers to at least double that of their cheaper cousins.  But OMG!  TERRIFIC!  Very rich (as they should be :D)!  But I had no trouble with the dough or the sweetness.  I ended up kind of molding the chocolate to the almond butter as it was kind of stiff, but it was fun and yummy.  Once again, look who's proudly strutting as Queen of the Lab for trying a new recipe -- and succeeding!  Thank you, Valerie Lynn, for submitting this lovely  recipe!

Very tasty treat - my husband *loved* them.  The only changes I would make is to melt the butter before adding to the mixer, and more chocolate for the coating of the eggs.  I ran out early on and had to make scraggly-looking eggs by the end.

Made these into small eggs last Easter and everyone loved them.  I kind of forgot about this recipe until yesterday when I was looking for something to take to a Super Bowl gathering.  I doubled the recipe, but used only 4 cups of powdered sugar.  I added enough milk to make it creamy enough to shape.  I like to use Peter Pan p.b. for cooking...it seems to be less dry than some other peanut butter.  I shaped these into bite sized footballs, and dipped them in a combo of melted semi sweet and milk chocolate chips.  Then I melted a small handful of white chocolate chips in a ziplock bag, snipped off a TINY corner of the bag and piped lines across the top to look like stitches on a football.  They turned out great and were the hit of the party!  Everyone raved about how cute they were and how much they tasted like a Reese's cup.  It made enough that I also shaped about 15 hearts and put them in the freezer (before dipping) to use for Valentine's Day.  This recipe is time consuming and messy, but worth it!!!  My 8 year old said they taste like a cross between Reese's and heaven. :-). Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Very easy to make and kids love to dip.  I used the microwave dipping chocolate.  Big hit.  Will do again.

Big hit in the Easter baskets! I used a silicone egg mold for these, rather than dipping them. Just coat the mold, allow to harden, shape mixture into the desired shaped and place in the mold and cover tops with more chocolate. Sounds more involved, but was actually much easier!

WAY TOO SWEET!! After reading other reviews, I cut the sugar in half and doubled the amount of peanut butter. The mixture turned out to be very easy to mold/handle but after adding the chocolate it was overwhelmingly sweet!

This tastes really good and my entire family loved them. It was a little hard to get the chocolate to cover the peanut butter smoothly though but that may be because i've never really done anything like this before. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and it tastes BEYOND AMAZING

We used these as place settings in place of the decorated dyed-eggs that we usually use for place settings on Easter.  I dipped the eggs in Bakers dipping chocolate, and then I piped on dyed frosting to write a name on each of the eggs.  They were very cute, and most people enjoyed the taste.

I absolutely love Reeses peanut butter cups. Thats why next time I will be using MILK CHOCOLATE instead of the semi-sweet. I also added more milk to the peanut butter mixture till it was creamier. Extra milk make the peanut butter mixture easy to mold and extra creamy when you eat them! yum!

EGG-CELLENT! Easy.  Use as much milk to bring peanut butter mixture to workable consistency.  Shaped by rolling small balls until smooth, then used a plastic egg shape (think silly putty) draped with plastic wrap, press mixture into shape, pop out plastic and presto the perfect egg shape--all the same.  Used a large, 7 oz. Hershey bar for the dipping chocolate, though you may need about    1 1/2 bars to cover eggs completely.  I yielded 24 eggs easily.  Delicious and smooth.  My family and coworkers thank you.  YUM!

Ihave been making these for many years, but I add 10 graham crackers-ground up, and use chocolate morsels melted in the microwave. They are so good they rarely last past Easter. My grandchildren ask me to make them even when it is not Easter.

I really hate to give this three stars since I altered the recipe.  Please take that into consideration.  I just wanted to put a waning out there for anyone who wanted to use my alteration.  I used natural peanut butter (found in a market in Ecuador- it's just ground peanuts).   My peanut butter eggs were gorgeous and my kids loved them. I however thought they were not to my liking.  So, next time I have available some nice creamy peanut butter that doesn't cost me an arm and a leg, I will try this again.  And again, I am sorry for the rating.  It wouldn't let me leave a review without one.

oh i was so sadly disappointed with this recipe, especially considering its high rating!  i might be a novice candy maker but i consider myself a pretty accomplished baker so this shouldn't have been too much of a stretch... but the dough needed more milk, it was far too crumbly and wouldn't hold the egg shape as written.  i had to add significantly more shortening to the chocolate to get it thin enough to dip the eggs, and i still had to sort of just roll them in it, it never became liquid enough to just dip.  when i stuck the fork in the frozen eggs they still fell apart despite having added extra milk to hold them together.  and now that they're done the consistency is like peanut butter flavored powdered sugar!  not enough pb, too much confectioners sugar..... overall just not what i was hoping for.

These contained WAY too much sugar for the amount of peanut butter it called for.  They were a crumbly mess.

I couldn't find my mom's recipe to make my normal eggs so when I saw this recipe I thought well it has all the same ingredients.  Boy was this a big mistake.  I used my digital kitchen scale to masure the ingredients.  Way to much sugar.  It wouldn't stick together let alone form eggs.  I will never use this again.  When I find my mom's recipe that was handed down from my grandmother I will share.  As for this recipe I wanted my eggs to taste like peanut butter not sugar.

Great recipe.  I cut back on the powdered sugar.  They were plenty sweet enough without it.  I shaped small eggs using a teaspoon.  After dipping them in the chocolate I sprinkled colored spring mix sequins on them.  Made the decorating easy.  I ran out of dipping chocolate so next time I'll use more.  I'd like to try milk chocolate next time, too, as I'm more of a milk chocolate person.

These were SO good!  I used half of a plastic egg to make the egg shape and placed them in everyone's Easter basket.  I also chose to use half crunchy and half creamy PB.  I used Ghiradelli melting chocolate (half a package) and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips along with the shortening as I was out of semi-sweet squares.  Came out wonderful and the kids loved them!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made these to put in my boys' easter baskets and they turned out great! I used chunky peanut butter because that's what I had. I think these were pretty sweet, so I might try to use less sugar next time.

I am currently making the eggs and i love it. It is taking longer than i thought to shape them but it is understandable. I am using cookie cutters to shape them into very small shapes. I have little cousins and i think they are going to love it! I am so excited about this recipe and how it is going to come out. I followed the recipe and everything is working out as it says it should! I love this recipe and am definitely going to make it again! Thanks for the awesome idea and recipe! :-)

What a Easter Hit! Everyone raved about these and gobbled them up in a hurry! And they wanted the recipe and asked me to bring more on the next holiday too! The only things i changed (based on the other reviews) is that I used 1/2 the sugar in PB mix, and i used bittersweet chocolate for dipping. They were creamy (not crumbly) and still really sweet too! I drizzled white chocolate on top and pink or yellow sprinkles for a little Easter dazzle. Put them in colored cupcake papers and they are even cuter and easy to hand out! I recommend using good quality chocolate and peanut butter for these... It makes all the difference in the taste and texture! SEE MY PHOTO!

These make great peanut butter eggs. Now I revised this recipe. I but in a qaurter block of cream cheese and a half cup more of peanut butter and a teaspoon of vanilla. Then freeze them and I melt milk chocolate chips and add 2 tablespoons of shorting then dip them in using a spoon. They turn out creamier and have more of a peanut butter taste rather then sugar. Everyone raves about them.

Good and creamy but very sweet.   Good, simple recipe, but I personally probably wouldn't go through the trouble for these.  I'm usually all for homemade stuff, but these just weren't good enough for the effort for me

I'm only giving this recipe two stars because my sister, who is a sugar maniac, seemed to enjoy these. To me it tasted like sugar with a mild peanut flavour. Way too sweet.

Very delicious & absolutely adorable.  Changes included: 1) subbed crunchy peanut butter for smooth 2) added canola oil (in addition to shortening) to melted chocolate because it was difficult to get smooth, even after stirring with a wire wisk for a long time 3) made 1.5 times the melted chocolate b/c it hardens quickly.  Used half of a plastic Easter egg that opens lengthwise to form the eggs, then placed them in melted chocolate by sliding a fork under the flat bottom to pick them up.  Great treat for the holidays...enjoy!

Love this recipe! it's easy enough that the kids can help. Since we are having an unexpected early snow storm I decided to get the kids together and make this. Instead of the egg shape we used small silicone pumpkin, fingers and bone molds to make these awesome candies.  Will make again for all holidays

Made the peanut butter dough the night before Easter, shaped the next morning into small 2 bite size (size of mini cupcake papers) and they were PERFECT!! Followed the recipe exactly and sprinkled with sprinkles while the chocolate was still wet...put them in the frig for a few hours and BOY were these GOOD!!! People were hiding them, they were so good  ;)  THANK YOU!!!!

Have been making these for over 50 yrs. - sold many dozen.  Using this basic recipe I also used crunchy peanut butter - rolled into balls and only coated half the ball - Also make coconut eggs - just use more butter and a small bag of coconut or 15 oz. of confectioners sugar and 1 cup butter with butter or vanilla flavoring and we called those "Butter Jets" - rolled them in a ball, than flattened the balls.

Made these for my kids to give to some friends for Easter, and all of the kids loved them.  I needed to add more milk than called for, probably an additional 2-3 tablespoons.  Once the dough came together, I found these pretty easy to shape and dip in chocolate.  Although a little time consuming, this recipe is great to make once a year for Easter.

Excellent recipe! I doubled the recipe and used whipping cream instead of milk. It took about 1/4 cup of cream to make a smooth mixture. A 1 pound package of Candy Quik was enough to coat the balls-doubling the recipe made about 80 of them.

These tasted great; I had a hard time getting the chocolate to stick evenly, but I've had that problem with other recipes, so it's me, not the recipe.

I liked these, the only way i eat p-nut butter is with chocolate. I did put slightly less sugar since p-nut butter had sugar and made them small eggs(or sloppy rounds in my case)Mine weren't pretty but i'm only one eating them so thats ok this time. I also rolled a few in chopped nuts. Will make again

I made these for my family for easter. They were so good...everybody loved them. I didn't change a thing about the recipe. While I was mixing it it was very crumbly and I didn't think it was gonna come together, but it did. I didn't quite master the "egg" shape very well, so they didn't look the best, but they tasted much better than they looked!  I doubled this recipe and used semi-sweet chocolate on half of the eggs and milk chocolate on the other half, It made about 35 eggs. My boyfriend couldn't even wait for the chocolate to finish hardening before he had to eat one :) thanks for the recipe!!

I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cup and used crunchy PB.  I used salted butter.  I did not add the milk, but increased the PB by about 2 or 3 tablespoons since it was crunchy.  This made a nice dough.  I recommend tasteing before adding more sugar since "too sweet" or "not sweet enough" is a personal thing. For the coating, I used a combination of semi sweet and milk chocolate chips w/ a little bit of butter flavored shortening.  I put them in the freezer to set and to keep. These were a huge hit at a family get together for Easter.  This recipe is a keeper. I will definately make these again next year.  My girls (7 & 9) had fun molding the peanut butter into egg shapes.

They need to be renamed buckeye eggs!  Taste just like the buckeyes!  I packed the peanut butter in a wilton egg shaped silicon pan, popped them out, froze them on a wax paper cookie sheet for at least one hour (mine were 4 inches long, and 1/12 inch high)  To make 12 I doubled the recipe. I decorated the tops of them with wilton colorful sprinkles while the chocolate was still very warm, so they would stick.  Can't wait to show them off on Easter as part of my edible centerpiece with my flower cupcakes and mini bunny cakes! Thanks!

These are too cute!  So easy to make, and pretty quick if you make them small.  I did reduce sugar by 1/2 cup, added 1 tsp milk and 1/2 cup Jiff pb.  JUst like the consistency better.  Did use 1/2 Bakers semi-sweet squares and 1/2 Nestle chocolate chips.  It made around 30 small eggs.  They look beautiful, and my husband can't stop eating them!  Thank you!

These are very good and SUPER easy to make, i added 1/2 extra tbsp of milk though, thought they needed it. I used chocolate confectionary wafers instead of chocolate squares. Wafers are already tempered so your chocolate won't melt once your eggs are dipped.

This was the best peanut butter Easter eggs, that I have made with my children. They shared them with their classmates and our close friends.  Everyone loves them.  

Thank you.

These taste good, but I have some issues. I pressed the pb mixture into the bottom of a silicone muffin cup, and they came out resembling reeses. But when I dipped them in chocolate (after freezing for quite a while), so much of them crumbled off that the chocolate was a mess, and the "reeses cups" came out looking rough. I would like to add more pb next time to see if they could be a little less crumbly but still be handled. I used super dark chocolate to counteract the sweetness of the confectioner's sugar. I also think tempering the chocolate would be a good idea, as mine didn't set up as well as I would like. I also used coconut oil in place of the shortening, so I don't know if that affected how it set up. If I tempered it, I don't think I would need to add anything to the chocolate.

First I have to say that my family went nuts over these! I did leave out a little of the sugar so they were not so sweet. I only had milk chocolate bakers chocolate to cover the eggs in, but they still came out AMAZING! I made smaller eggs and used a teasppon to help shape them. I dunked them in chocolate (let them set) then drizzled colored white chocolate acrossed the top. I WILL FOR SURE BE MAKING THESE AGAIN!!! Thank you :) Family is already asking me to make them again.

The basics of this recipe are good, but you definitely need to tweak the amounts. I added more peanut butter to make it less crumbly and less confectioner's sugar to make it not too sweet. The final results were good, but if I'd have stuck to the recipe as written, they wouldn't have worked.

Yummy! I made them first per the recipe, but next time I will try cutting back on the sugar, as I think they don't need quite this much.

Pretty good!  The peanut butter to chocolate ratio is not equal!  I would do smaller sizes next time.  Also, the dipping is a pain because the peanut butter doesn't stick together well enough!  I tried all sorts of ways to get this to work, but it  definitely wasn't easy!

Very Dry even after adding more milk than it called for. Had very little peanut butter taste after adding that much powdered sugar. I was able to fix it up but would not recommend this recipe to anyone!

I made these yesterday with a friend.  They were fun to make, but I was disappointed in the outcome.  Maybe I should have made them smaller, because I felt the chocolate to peanut butter ratio was off.  My friend thought that they were pretty good, but not excellent.  Also, did not need to chill the peanut butter eggs before dipping them in chocolate.  I think I will stick with Reese's.

Taste just like reese peanut butter cups!!! I used milk chocolate instead, I also did 1 and 1/4 cup peanut butter, and 4 tablespoons milk. I did use 16 ounces of confections sugar but then added a little more by eye ball to make the dough more easier to work with. Will deff make these again!!!

great for any occasion. I highly recommend using fresh ground peanuts ( a store near me called The Fresh Market sells fresh ground peanuts, cashews and almonds) makes a HUGE difference. I use a little more butter because the fresh peanut butter has less oils

I had to add twice the milk to make the "dough" workable.  Rolling them into egg shapes was too time-consuming so we just made balls.  Not sure this is the best Buckeye recipe out there..

These are great! I melted a bag of Hershey's semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the squares it asked for. Also, I melted the butter it asks for and mixed that right in to the perfect consistany dough. Every one that tried these said that they tasted like Reese's penut butter cups without knowing that the previous person had already said the same thing! The Hershey's chocolate chips I'd say is responsible for that.

This was an easy, fun and tasty recipe!  Made it with the kids and they loved it and so did everyone who tried them.  We drizzled ours with colorful melted chocolate and they were beautiful.  The ONLY thing I might do differently is to add a touch of salt to the peanut butter to give it that yummy sweet/salty taste that peanut butter cups have.

Made these for my nieces for Easter and they were a hit with the entire family!  I found the finished recipe way too dry and crumbly, so I added much more peanut butter and milk to get the right consistency and taste I preferred.  This also reduced the sweetness as other reviewers mentioned.  I didn't have squares of chocolate, so I just used semi sweet chips.   Was told I have to make these again!!

These were very good. I did a double batch and dipped half in white chocolate and the other half in melted semi-sweet chocolate chips. Delicious! Thanks! Very peanut buttery.

These are a nice change to the same old rice krispie treats, but the sprinkles are a little overkill and they don't keep well at all.  We used semi sweet chips because we don't like milk chocolate and it worked just fine.  Might make again, but prefer them without chocolate covering.  They are cute and looked great in an Easter basket! Thanks!

Tasted more like chocolate covered sugar than peanut butter. If I made these again I'd cut the sugar in half.

Easy!  I had good comments on these.  I can't eat peanut butter....so I didn't have one....but everyone said they were good.  Only one negative comment about how you can really taste the 10x sugar and they were kinda dry. Otherwise great comments on these....and super easy.

Very good recipe...I used about 1 1/4 c. of creamy peanut butter and about 5 T. of milk to get the right consistency.  Delicious...if you are going to decorate with sprinkles, sprinkle immediately after dipping in chocolate because the eggs tend to harden quickly.  I know they will be a big hit at our Easter dinner...will be adding to my "must make again" list!  Happy Easter!  :)

These eggs were great!  I used half crunchy/half creamy peanut butter.  One thing I wasn't sure of from original recipe was weather to use a mixer, and whether to have the butter softened.  I chose to soften my butter in the microwave and just stir the ingredients by hand.  I also melted my semisweet squares and shortening  in the microwave for about 2 minutes rather than on the stove.  Also, I only let my eggs sit in the freezer for about 10 minutes before dipping them.  However, poking them with the fork tines didn't work for me, so I just dropped them in and lifted out with the fork.  My single batch made over 20 eggs.  Have fun with these!

This is wonderful!  I did end up using 5 Tbsp. of half n half instead of milk.  Just too dry to mix.  Also an entra spoonful of p.b.  I shaped the eggs in the small plastic halves, then froze.  It made 21 eggs, and 7 round bon bons.  I ended up using 12 chocolate squares as all of these had to be dipped and an extra 1 1/2 tsp. of shortening.   My (adult) kids will love them!!  Excellent filling!

These are really delicious!  I made them for Easter this year adn they were very well recieved by anyone who tried them.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I needed 3 Tablespoons of milk instead of just the 1. I made small eggs and I got about 54.  We liked them best right out of the fridge, so we stored htem in there and had tehm as little treats throughout the day.  Very good and very easy.

I give this 5 star only because my father is a BIG pb egg lover! He always gets the ones the churches sell at Easter time. He told me the other day he thought these were better, I told him I disagree that I like the churches better, but he doesnt agree at all!!

My daughter and I made these for an Easter dessert this year and, what a hit!  I doubled the recipe and gave some away as gifts--everyone raved.  We used the toppings suggested and, also used toffee crunch, crushed cashews, and mini chocolate chips.  All who tried said that they could definatley pass as store-bought.  This recipe has definatley become one of our "Easter traditions" from this point on!

These were really good!  I added a tsp. of vanilla to the peanut butter mixture like another reviewer suggested.  I also used the milk chocolate wafers from our local "Hobby Lobby" craft store to melt & dip the eggs in.  I used the white mint wafers (tasted like andies mints) to write with.  Everyone loved them and thought we ordered them from a bakery.  This was easy, fun and now an Easter tradition in our family.

I halved this recipe & not sure if that was where the problem was, but many things did not work out for me... I added the sugar gradually, thank goodness b/c halfway through the sugar, the mixture turned very crumbly & when I tasted it, it was good but almost too sweet &I knew I couldn't add any more. It was still sticky enough to roll into eggs but just barely.  I used semisweet chips & they did not melt well- unfortunately I did not have shortening & subbed butter b/c I thought that would smooth it out but I added nearly 3 tbsp (to only 4 oz choc) and it still was not smooth or 'dippable', so I ended up having to smear it onto my eggs w/ a mini spatula & my hands. They were not pretty at all, good thing it was just for me & my husband. But, they did taste good when all was said & done. Next time, I'd cut down on sugar and use the chocolate that is made for candy making.

I reduced the sugar and increased the peanut butter, but later played with the quantities to get the right texture for molding into egg shapes, so I'll take a wild guess and say 1 3/4 c sugar and 1 1/2 cups peanut butter.  I used both melted milk and semi-sweet chocolate, dipping the eggs in one and drizzling with the other.  The flavor is good, not like a peanut butter cup - a bit lighter inside - but I would have liked the recipes that add crisped rice cereal to the peanut butter mix, or perhaps even using the graham cracker crumb/peanut butter mix from the peanut butter bars recipes on this site.  I think that would have made these better.  Still, easy to shape, and once you get the hang of it, easy to dip without wasting too much chocolate! (I would coat the bottom with chocolate, place on a fork and pour/spread chocolate over the rest with a spoon).

Alot of the good reviews had altered the recipe so I intentended to follow the recipe exactly and see how it was.   After mixing in half of the confect sugar I had a taste the mix was super- like Pb.cups, I continued to add sugar untill it was crumbly and difficult to mix (I had added milk too) had a taste and with over half cup sugar still to add it was too sweet! I stopped adding sugar there. The crumbly mixture did hold together fine tho. I made perfect teaspoon size eggs and got a little over 30 eggs.   I didn't have shortning + read someone had used butter instead- my chocolate turned to fudge! Fortunately I had extra chocolate handy and used that melted without shortning to cover my lil eggies decorated them with white chocolate and dustings of cocoa powder and confec sugar - I brought them to an easter lunch, everyone was very impressed with the look of them and some said they tasted really good. I look forward to making them again in different shapes and with much less sugar.

I live in Korea with a homestay family and the kids LOVED this explosion of sugar and taste! Nothing like straight Western sugar-coma to help them out!^^ I added vanilla and made about half of them white chocolate eggs. Instead of shortening (which doesn't exist here) I used simple butter and it was fine.

These are just like Reese's PB cups! I made mine heart-shaped and dipped them in almond bark. I suppose they could be made into any shape you please. We used cookie cutters, but the mixture was just the right consistency that you could mold or model them however you choose. I have silicone molds I think I'll try next time. I also think you could use them for 3-D creations, like a standing snowman or jack-o-lantern. This is definitely a recipe I'll drag out at nearly every holiday. Thanks!

I made these for Easter and they were awesome but I used MUCH less sugar than  called for. I doubled the peanut butter but I am not sure how much I used exactly b/c I just kept adding some until it tasted good. I probably used about 3/4 of a box of powdered sugar instead of the 2 that doubling the recipe would have required. These were a huge hit - everyone loved them.

I split the filling into thirds and added peanut butter to one, coconut to the second, then added a tsp of maple flavoring and a quarter cup of chopped peanuts to the third. Made a lot and the kids all loved them. Will definately use this recipe again.

T-E-D-I-O-U-S!  Granted I am not a baker, but these took forever!  I used exceptional chocolate (Gharardelli - spelling?)  and just feel that I wasted it.  Messy, timely  and the eggs need to be double-dipped for full coverage.  My family of 4 rejected them.  ...sorry!...

I added one thing that my grandmother use to always put in her  peanutbutter eggs. I crushed up and put in the food processor 1/2 a package of ritz crackers. They are AMAZING! My husband said they are better then Reese's!

This is so fun - and easy - tasted great, too.  I made into large eggs and painted the molds with chocolate.  If you do this, chill the molds after you get your colors down, then add the milk chocolate with a pastry brush in a thin layer.  Chill again and press in the peanut butter mix. Keep a little in from the sides, near the top so you get a good fill with chocolate to seal closed.  Chill well and peel back the silicone mold.  I only wish I had other colors to use as this was a really fun holiday project.

This recipe is very much like my peanut butter ball recipe.  Everyone's pictures were so cute.  I just wanted to leave a tip. Use your slow cooker to melt your chocolate. It prevents worrying about the hot water. An extra plus, you can work at a better space than your stove.  We always use Hershey bars with a small piece of canning wax to coat our candy.

These are good and easy. I think maybe there should be a little more peanut butter and less sugar though. The filling is pretty much flavored powdered sugar.

The first time I made these eggs they turned out dry. I then realized I had used fat free peanut butter. I made another batch and they were wonderful! We loved them so much I ended up making them three times! My family has raved about them! Make them! You will love them!

These are yummy.  I reduced the peanut butter a little and followed TheWelshmansWife's idea of adding some finely ground salted dry roasted peanuts for texture and flavor (more like Reese's) -- homerun according to my husband!  I liked these better than other peanut butter fillings I've made.

Made this recipe and loved it so much I was afraid to keep the eggs and eat them all! I gave most away to my neighbor and her family. They raved about them. I followed the recipe for the most part, adding just a little more milk to soften. I made some large and some small, then coated them in the chocolate mixture. Very tasty.

I made my eggs with this same recipe. It was great! :) To decorate, i melted caramel and drizzled it on top. It was kind-of difficult but I got it to work. This is a great recipe, and it's fun to make! I made this with my brother and we had a blast!

Yum! I made these yesterday and they were great! I had to tweak just a few things as we were on vacation all week and were missing some of the ingredients when we got back. I was out of milk so I added some ice cream instead. And I used chocolate chips with no shortening to do the chocolate covering. I wanted to make them pretty to I melted some peanut butter chips that I was going to dye with food colouring to drizzle on. When I added the food colouring to the first batch, it seized up and couldn't be used. So I just drizzled with peanut coloured drizzle. They still looked good and tasted excellent!

Very cute and easy to make. I didn't find them to be messy at all. I used crunchy peanut butter instead to give it some texture and eyeballed the milk until it was the consistency I liked. People were very impressed by the presentation. A little to sweet for my taste but still a nice little treat.

The recipe was really dry and would not stick together so had to add a lot more peanut butter and milk, then someone suggested buying plastic eggs so I stuffed the plastic eggs stuck them in the freezer.  When I tried to take them out of the egg they would not come out. However the mixture taste great but I ended up just throwing eggs and all out!

These were yummy and easy to make! We did have to add more milk to make the peanut butter mix workable. We just kept adding a splash until it was right. We shaped them by hand and used melted semi sweet chocolate chips. Tasted just like Reeses! Will make again. They are good for any holiday - just change the shape and add seasonal sprinkles!

I'm sorry, but I find that I'm just eating peanut butter with chocolate and there are already jams that have that combination. It's too rich even as a dessert.

Good basic recipe.  I only added half of the powdered sugar and increased the milk to 1/2 cup.  I also added a lot of salt (1/2 tsp) to bring out the peanut flavor.  I finished it off with some vanilla extract to richen the flavor.  It was great.

These were yummy!  I should have taken others advice and double dipped the chocolate though, it was a big too peanut-y for me.  I used dipping, or melting chocolate which made the chocolate part easy, but it was rather difficult to shape the peanut butter part because it fell apart in my hands, I don't know how others made theirs pretty.  (Not that we cared too much while we gobbled them down!)

Very good.  I made as directed, except that I needed 3 T. milk to get my ingredients to combine.  I made these bite size, which yielded 40+.  The only reason that these don't get 5 stars is because they were kinda dry.

I cut the sugar in half and used additional peanut butter and they were still way too sweet.  But kept in freezer for 24 hours+, and served directly from freezer they were much better

Delicious, but I ended up adding probably about a 1/4 cup or so of milk. Otherwise it was just peanut butter crumbs. Also, I formed the peanut butter eggs and then popped a tray of them in the refrigerator for about an hour and they were then perfect for the chocolate dipping.

I just finished making these. Very tasty recipe...did have to add a bit more peanut butter to make the filling stick together. however, as far as being aesthetically pleasing....not so much. I did the first batch egg shaped, the second batch I made into peanut butter cups. I had foil cups, so I just put a dollop of chocolate in, put a ball of chilled filling in, then topped with more chocolate. much neater of a presentation.

This got rave reviews from peanut butter and chocolate-a-holics so I'd say they were a hit.  I used crunchy peanut butter instead of smooth.

I had such fun making this recipe and then watching people's faces while they ate these tasty desserts! After reading comments about them being too sweet, I substituted natural peanut butter- with no added sugar- and found the sweetness level to be spot on. I had some trouble dipping the peanut butter balls in the chocolate after they cooled though- the chocolate didn't stick all that well. I had to go back over the holes later with chocolate on a spatula. But still a great recipe!

I made this recipe according to the recipe and they turned out great.  My only complaint was that they were difficult to form because of how dry they turned out.  I made another batch with a few modifications.  I added an extra cup of peanut butter and enough milk to bring the mixture to the desired thickness.  I also added a Tbls. of vanilla.  The extra peanut butter and milk made creamy peanut butter eggs, everyone at work raved about these!

These are really cute, and tasted pretty good, but I felt that they were a little to sweet, and not quite peanut butter-y enough. I used ambrosia chocolate coating to dip them in. The chocolate hardened very quickly on the frozen balls. I decorated the eggs with little royal icing flowers/leaves. They looked adorable and were enjoyed by my family. Thanks for sharing!

These were amazing! So rich, I could only eat half of one. I only got 12 eggs out of this recipe, however, I felt that I did make my eggs a little on the bigger side. I put dollops of the PB mixture onto wax paper and shaped them while they were lying flat...I found this was easier to get the desired shape. Put them in the freezer overnight, then dipped them in the chocolate and put them back in the freezer for about an hour. (A word to first-timers like myself: the shortening is necessary to get a smooth finish.) Then I decided to melt some white almond bark and color it different pastel shades, and I streaked the colors across the eggs to make a pretty design. I did have a little trouble with the almond bark design breaking off the eggs after hardening. Don't know how to fix that other than just handling them delicately.

I agree w/ others that it's too sweet.  i put a whole jar of creamy natural PB in and it was perfect.  very "peanut buttery", not overly sweet.  I also decorated the tops by drizzling melted white chocolate chips over the tops.  You can color the white chocolate w/ pretty spring green or pink by adding a touch of red or green food coloring to the white chocolate!

These were perfect. However, I did simplify the chocolate coating part by melting the chocolate and a tablespoon of Crisco in the microwave. Once that was melted, I just dipped the eggs in that. It saved me from having to mess with a double boiler, which I don't even have. They cooled very quickly, so be sure to put whatever toppings you want (I used sprinkles) on them right away. I will be making these again next Easter!

This was my first time making these and I must say I LOVED the peanut butter mixture, it reminds me of the peanut butter in a Reese's cup!  I even used little cookie cutter for different shapes, I will be using this recipe over and over.  Thanks for posting it!

These are the best darn peanut butter eggs I've ever had!  For those novice candy makers like myself, here's some specifics that worked well for me. Since many people found the dough crumbly, I started with 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and then sprinkled in small amounts as I mixed until it was no longer sticky.  You want to just soften your butter (mine took 25 seconds in my microwave) and I also started with just 2 tsp of milk.  The recipe says to add that as needed and that was all I needed.  Mix with a pastry blender.  I also used dipping chocolate and it was super easy.  I couldn't be happier with this recipe!

I did what someone else wrote in, and I used 1/2 cup less of powdered sugar.  I also, put in 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the mixture.  This was easy to make, and everyone loved it!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  It was so easy but I did add an additional 1/2 cup peanut butter. I also added a pinch of salt as my peanut butter was sugar/salt free. They are delicious and the perfect addition to our Easter table.

This was really good, and really easy!!!  I changed it a bit though...I used less sugar (I only had half a bag...) and added about half a cup shredded unsweetned coconut. It turned out amazing!!!!  Thanks:)

These are sooo good. Very easy to make. The texture is crumbly, but it does hold together well. I let mine chill for about an hour before I started dunking. I might have to make some more before Easter, my bag there in keeps shrinking. Hum! courious?

I make these several times a year. This is by far the best peanut butter egg recipe. I temper milk chocolate and dip them into that. I usually pipe on some white chocolate across the tops for decoration when I am finished. I HIGHLY recommend this wonderful recipe!!

Super fabulous. I used a combination of splenda and regular sugar instead, and it still came out fabulous :)

These eggs were so delicious and so beautiful.  I also made some in white chocolate that were a huge hit with non-white chocolate loving folks.  Next time, I won't use semi-sweet though.  I will use milk chocolate.

Turned out great- I made them almost exactly to recipe. Really tasty & beautiful presentation. I gave them as gifts for Easter & everyone loved them.
Note: if the chocolate is too thick just keep adding canola oil until is seems right- worked like a charm.

I thought this was a FABULOUS recipe!  The shaping was a bit time consuming, and of course the chocolate was messy.  :)  Using tongs made it a LOT easier than the fork method.  I made a double batch, the first dipping chocolate had shortening, and I left it out of the 2nd.  It works the exact same either way, I think the chocolate is less melty without shortening when you pick it up.  For those in my fam who had less of a sweet tooth, I only dipped the bottom of my egg in chocolate, laid it flat, and then used my tongs to quickly drizzle chocolate over the top.  VERY pretty.  I should have taken pictures.
I got many ooh and aahs with this one, and will be using it again.  THANKS!!

Hubby does not care for cream cheese so I chose this recipe. Made with 1/4 cup extra pb and Hershey semi-sweet choc chips w/half the shortening. Everyone loved them! Very addictive!

When I had my boyfriend taste the peanut butter part (before dipped in chocolate), his reaction (verbatim) was, "Whoa.. mm.. too good!" After dipping in chocolate, tasted even better. Caution: this recipe is very sweet & very messy, but even if both bothers you it may still be worth it. A very good treat, I would even say better than Reese's peanut butter cups. Followed recipe exactly with 2 exceptions: 1)Mixed some milk chocolate chips in with the semi-sweet, and 2)microwaved shortening/chocolate mix because I don't have a double boiler. This is a great treat for any time!

These taste fabulous, but I made mine quite small at first (about the size of lilliput eggs) and they wouldn't even stay on a toothpick in the chocolate.  As a few other reviews mentioned, I found them to be pretty messy and time consuming.  The tase was worth the hassle though!

Very yummy, so easy, and lots of fun to make.    Instead of using semi-sweet chocolate and shortening, i bought Bakers dipping chocolate.  Costs a bit more, but super easy...and i like the milk chocolate taste.

This recipe is awsome.Great tasting and very simple.I only gave it four stars because its a litte tricky coating the large size eggs,it was very messy and I had a hard time removing the fork. But when I mad a bunch of smaller eggs it was easy. I just used a tooth pick.I loved making this for my kids Easter basket.I will make these for years to come

I tried this recipe this evening and love it! The only changes I made was to use less sugar and add a little more milk to make it creamier.  My kids helped me make them and they had so much fun!  We doubled the recipe and made a couple of larger eggs and a lot of smaller eggs.  I bought some of the easter "boxes" at our local craft store to put the eggs in and we put some pretty sugared flowers, bunnies and chicks on top as decorations.  We put these in the fridge and are planning to pass them out tomorrow as Easter gifts to the grandparents, teachers and neighbors!  Thanks!

These were easy to make.  I added a little more milk and peanut butter to make it easier to mix.(Hint: Use your hands - it is messy, but much easier.)They are very sweet, so next time I would make them smaller.  One or two bites is enough for my sweet tooth.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Warning: these are extremely sweet!! They were a blast to make with my neices and nephew but the end result was litterally a ball of sugar. I couldnt even bite into it because it was so sweet, but the kids loved them.

I didnt like this recipe.  as it's written, the peanut butter ends up being very dry and crumbles.  also, id recommend using milk chocolate, the bitter chocolate doesnt taste like the church eggs i remember. :(
the eggs crumbling (even after freezing) made it very hard to dip successfully.  could stick anything in them because they just crumbled :(

Everyone loved these creamy peanut butter eggs. I used Skippy peanut butter. There were fantastic. And the semi sweet squares. Really great candy. Everyone loved them. And I used my deviled egg plates to size up each egg.

I made these as is and found them to be a bit dry so I added more milk (I think I doubled it) until it felt more pliable like play dough. It makes it easier to shape into eggs and gives it a smoother and creamier taste.  All in all, it’s a great recipe that my kids and grandkids love!  I have a 2 lb. egg mold that I bought that is 8 X 5 1/2 X 2 3/4.  Using this recipe with the added extra milk, it takes about 1 1/2 recipes to fill it and it weighs in at a whopping 5 lbs!

I made this as a treat, as I love Reese’s peanut butter eggs, but this came nowhere near. It is very, very sweet, and on the more difficult side to make. I doubled the recipe by accident, so I used 2 cups of peanut butter, and 4 cups of powdered sugar. I also used approximately 1/4 cup of evaporated milk to soften the mixture. I melted Hershey’s semisweet chocolate chips by running 2 cups of chips in the microwave for 2 minutes. I added 2 TBSP of coconut oil, to help the chocolate harden. It was relatively easy to dip, but I had like 4 dozen, so it took a long time. It definitely didn’t taste like Reese’s, so I won’t be making these again.

I made this last night for an Easter brunch today. Everyone loved them, and I've even been recruited to make them for my cousin's graduation party next month. The only problem I had was when dipping the eggs in chocolate, they'd break apart. My grandmother suggested using paraffin instead of shortening... Don't know how well that will work, so I'll have to try it.

This is an excellent recipe! Very easy; not too sweet; just right. After reading other reviews, I did the following: I used disc melting chocolate (found in bulk food stores); I added one  teaspoon of vanilla; I used plastic Easter eggs with the long opening to form them; and I used a spoon to dip the eggs in chocolate. I can’t wait for my family to try these! A keeper. BTW...it was my first time making Peanut Butter Easter Eggs. Thank you AllRecioes. Once again, you make me look like a genius!

I used coconut oil and almond milk to cut the dairy and they were delicious. The coconut and peanut butter flavors blended really nicely. The recipe made approximately 30 eggs and I used an entire bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips for the coating. Everyone LOVED them!

Very good although next time I may cut the sugar in half and add salt to taste.  Also, I added much more milk to the mix than the recipe said, in order to get the consistency I wanted.

They are beautiful & delicous! Since a family member is vegan I used coconut oil instead of butter. At room temperature the filling melted!

I did a small test batch using the exact recipe and confirmed that the proportions are way off. So I went looking for my old candy recipe. For those who complained of this recipe being overly sweet the correct proportion is 1 cup peanut butter to 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Add 1 T of softened butter. What you end up with  is a faux Reese's cup that actually tastes like peanut butter and not just sickening sweet. You can also grind up some peanuts finely or use chunky peanut butter. I quit buying commercial candy which is why I wanted to make these for Easter. With recipe modifications this is so much better than what you can buy in the store.

I am rating this only 3 stars because I had to modify it. I made a double batch with 1/2 the amount of sugar. I don't know what type of peanut butter was used by the writer, but I buy the no sugar or oil added stuff( you know the type that the natural oil sits on top of) and still found this to be ridiculously  sweet. I also had to add more milk than the recipe calls for to get my mixture to form( and yes I added the separated oil from the pb in also) after my modifications these were good but I couldn't rate it higher as I had to change it so much.

Okay, for my taste buds this is almost great. I found them a bit too sweet as many others do. I also want more peanut butter taste.  Even though I did use a good quality PB. Another problem was too crumbly to hold together when dipping in the chocolate coating. I was very pleased with the coating.  So Next time I shall try, less sugar more peanut butter. I will let you all know how I do.

These were a hit last Easter.  I refuse to use shortening, though, hence 4 stars.  I used butter on one batch, coconut oil on the second batch

We made these for Easter and they were liked very much by the crowd.  I would have liked them to be a little more moist, but they were easy to make and coat in chocolate.  I even added a little extra milk to the mixture to keep them moist after reading several other reviews.  Next time I may modify the recipe more by checking out other recipes but keeping this as my base.

I didn't shape these as eggs but footballs. I made 32 servings = 66 footballs using a cookie scoop. The recipe as is it too crumbly. I had to doctor it up a lot to have a smooth and moldable "dough."  With the 32 servings, I had to add 1 cup extra peanut butter and a few more tablespoons of milk (4-5?). Then I kneaded it by hand. With the modifications, the pb footballs tasted great. It is very dry, but still has a great peanut buttery taste.

Made today, but I had to make some tweaks. I'm not sure if this is based on the recipe, or from the fact I had to double it. The filling turned out extremely dry, and by the time I could actually get it into a workable paste that could go inside an egg I had added in the realm of 8 tbsp of milk. So if it turns out extremely dry, keep adding milk a few tsp at a time.

In addition, if you make smaller eggs than the recipe suggests, you may end up using more chocolate.

Otherwise, VERY good recipe. They turned out wonderful!

DELICOUS.  Made these for my daughter who absolutely enjoyed them.  That is a compliment; for every time we go into this candy shop in Helen, she makes me buy Peanut Butter Ball Chocolates.  These stood up to those.  I made them in the plaster easter eggs like one of the reviewers suggested.  YUMMY!

These were very good!  This was definitely a learning experience.  I've never made anything like these before.  My main problem was the eggs breaking apart when I dipped them into the chocolate.  I found it worked best when I only put chocolate on one side of the egg instead of trying to cover it completely.  They tasted okay, but didn't look too appealing, though that's probably my fault. I may try this recipe again.

Very fun and very rich and yummy recipe.  This was also quite easy, I was expecting it to be a little harder.  I used a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and the Tbs of shortening because I didn't have the squares and it turned out great.  I also drizzled some melted white chocolate over the eggs before adding the sprinkles and this was so pretty!  So yummy (and I had to give a lot away so we wouldn't eat them all ourselves)!  Thank you for the great recipe!!!

I really enjoyed these and so did the family.  The only thing I would do different is make them smaller.  I followed another reviewers idea to use the plastic eggs as a mold.  Well it was just too much peanut butter mix per chocolate.  Bit overwhelming.  Next time I will see if I cannot find a Easter themed candy mold that would produce smaller pieces then cover in chocolate.

These turned out great! I dipped some in regular chocolate and some in white chocolate and then I added some food coloring to 3 separate bowls of white chocolate to make green, blue and yellow and paint splattered the eggs and then added some Easter sprinkles! They were cute and the kids had a blast decorating them! Thanks!!

Pretty good but not great for me.  The filling was too dry imo.  I would have liked a creamier center.

Fantastic recipe!! I used melting dark chocolate wafers from the craft store. It was a great match. I followed other reviewers and used more peanut butter (about 1/4 cup)  and milk so the mixture would be less crumbly. Thanks for sharing.

A super-easy recepie! Using lots of flour to coat my hands, the eggs were easily shaped. I placed all nine of them on parchment paper in the freezer. The chocolate coating should be the easiest part!

Delicious and Easy!  Im glad i measured the sugar...the recipe calls for a 16 oz bag of confectioners sugar...all i had was a 32 oz bag, but i was doubling the recipe, so technically i should have been able to dump in the whole bag.  I measured 16oz (2 cups) each instead(twice), and there was still a lot of extra sugar left in the bag...perhaps this is where people are having trouble in needing to add more peanut butter.  Anyways, my daughter and i had a great time making these :)

I LOVED THESE PEANUT BUTTER EGGS!!! I cut back on the sugar, but only by an ounce or two. I also added a total of 1 1/2-2Tbsp milk. I made 24 eggs out of the recipe! I did have to increase the chocolate to 12 oz and the crisco to 1 1/2Tbsp. YUMMY and EASY!!!

Texturally, these were not perfect for me. So I added graham cracker crumbs until they were. Problem solved, and not a fault with the recipe--I'm still experimenting with what works for my family! Thanks for the recipe!

These are so amazint! My mom always made buckeyes at Christmas but they were never quite what I wanted. These hit the spot and they are super easy. My 9 year old son made them with me. The only thing that I did differently was added about 1-2 t vanilla and used almond bark for dipping. We are already making our second batch!

Great recipe. I made these for Easter and I must say that I preferred them while the chocolate was still warm and not really hardened. I found that once the chocolate had hardened it was slightly on the SWEET side. I'll try it next time splitting the melting chocolate between semi sweet and unsweet morsals.

I changed the chocolate to milk chocolate that you buy in bulk for the purpose of melting. I added less than a tablespoon of shortening to the chocolate, melted it in the microwave and the results were fabulous!!! I will definitely make these again. I'm already thinking of the next holiday I can adapt these for.

Wow!  Incredible recipe.  These peanut butter eggs taste like Reese's Peanut Butter cups, but 100 times better and without the preservatives.  I only gave it 5 stars though, because using the recipe spot on did NOT work for me.  This was the first time ever that I've had to deviate from a baking recipe; I find that following directions to a T has always given me the best outcomes.  Not this time, though, but no worries!  I found, like a few reviewers, that the filling was extremely dry.  I added about one extra tablespoon of milk and maybe about 1/4 cup more peanut butter.  That was perfect!  Also, I made a bunch of little eggs instead of two big ones, so I had to use a bit more chocolate.  I used about 16 oz of Ghirardelli, but I did have some left over.  Probably 14 ounces or so would have worked.  Overall though, hubby and I are VERY pleased!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Even after micing the dry ingredients the peanut butter mixture has an unstirred powdered sugar taste. The kids will eat them but this was not the finest of holiday recipes.  We added rice cripses and I think that helpped to salvage the recipe but not by much.

This recipe was wonderful! I'm an American currently living in the UK and it was quite helpful that the recipe having the conversion chart right there! (I miss my sticks of butter! lol) Instead of shaping the peanut butter mixture into eggs, which I found nearly impossible, I shaped them into balls and decorated them with brightly colored sprinkles. Hope these will be a big hit at dinner this weekend, I know I've already eaten 3!

I did what one reviewer suggested and added extra stuff.  I found that this recipe is amazing by itself, but does great with everything but the Rice Krispy addition. They became chewy and tough after sitting overnight and are best left out in my opinion. I did, however, welcome the addition of the vanilla and crunchy peanut butter. In fact, next time I make these I'll either use all creamy or all crunchy.  This is a great basic recipe that I hope to use every year with my son.

We make this at Easter every year and are beginning to make them for football season.  It's a great recipe.  We make our Easter Eggs really big, so we recommend sharing. :)  Definitely need a large glass of milk to finish one off.

I receive soo0o many compliments on these delicious little eggs!  They truly taste better than store bought easter candy.  I used the best all natural crunchy peanut butter I could find, and cut the sugar in half, per the other suggestions.  They were still very, very sweet, but definitely wonderful.  Will make again next year. Thanks for the recipe!

These were not too difficult to make. They are not too rich and just sweet enough. I drizzled melted white chocolate over top to make them look more elegant. Very yummy!

These eggs were fun to make and yummy to eat! Plus they are so darn cute!!! The smaller the egg the better and I would to coat with chocolate twice. It can be too much peanut butter if you dont have milk. Ill be making this every Easter!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Big hit. 
When dipping the eggs in the chocolate, turn the heat on the chocolate down to keep from burning on the bottom. Maybe add a little more shortening for a thinner coating.

I was really looking forward to bringing these to a little Easter get together. BUT, the peanut butter filling was way to sweet for us and the chocolate was very difficult to dip, maybe I needed more shortning as it came out very thick and lumpy.

What a fun project!  My four daughters and I made this recipe into 24 smallish eggs which we dipped into a pot of chocolate melting wafers.  They set up quickly and easily in the fridge.  We then drizzled colored melting wafers on top (pink, purple and yellow).  They turned out cute and festive for Easter Sunday treats.  The girls were so excited to show their grandparents!  By using real chocolate melting wafers, I find it lessens that shortening aftertaste that I don't care for.  Other than that, the recipe is easy, yummy, and adorable.  Great for bragging rights around the table!

These eggs rock!They're so creamy and nutty! And they turned out so pretty, I made them my center peice. Next time, I'm going to use almond butter! I used high quality peanut butter, and used dark chocolate(54% cacao).They were just wonderful!I finished them with little swirlys too! (:

These were really good!  I added some extra PB (maybe 1/2 c.) because I didnt think it had enough PB taste.  I made the eggs about the size of real eggs and it yielded 18 eggs.  I packaged them in egg cartons to give on Easter.  Really cute and delish.

Good, I added some salt because it was too sweet for me. It was a bit of a hassle to make a bunch of small eggs but they looked pretty (mostly!)

These were so good.  My son had such a fun time making them for preschool.  They did not last long in our house.

These were absolutely delicious.  Just like my mother used to make.  This was my first attempt at peanut butter eggs and they turned out great.  Will definately make them again, probably this weekend, since they are almost gone.

I made these with my 10 and 4 year old sons. These were awesome! Instead of the chocolate squares, I used dipping chocolate and chocolate chips. They taste just like that "peanut butter and chocolate" candy bars! Yum! Will use this recipe over and over again! Thanks so much!
