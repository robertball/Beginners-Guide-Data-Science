I'm sorry for the few stars but even though American folks seem to like this recipe it is not a túrós csusza. That's primarily because cottage cheese does not exist in Hungary. We use "túró" (hence the name) which is a slightly curdier version of what you buy in the US as farmers' cheese. We don't mix the pasta with sour cream, rather the cheese itself, and top it with the sour cream before putting it in the oven. Alternatively, the sour cream is mixed in with the cheese. Trust me, it is the right cheese that really makes this dish.

This is an amazing meal! This  recipe is the authentic way of making it, don't change a thing as it doesn't need it. My Hungarian parents always made this and it taste awsome!  You could skip the oven part and just warm cottage cheese and sour cream on stove top with the noodles. I made this for my family and my daughter loves it! Yummy.

My mom was of Hungarian descent and used to make this all the time, minus the bacon. It was my comfort food growing up! Can be made even easier with just the noodles, cottage cheese, salt and pepper.

Charlee, this is really good!  I didn't use bacon (because I didn't have any)...instead did as one reviewer suggested and caramelized onions.  I added a little balsamic vinegar & brown sugar as I was sauteeing them to add sweetness and nice color - and used whole wheat noodle pasta.  The taste reminded me of the noodle pudding I ate when vacationing in Prague.

We make this once a week on Grocery Day.  It is so easy and everyone loves it. Hubby's Family is Hungarian and this is just one of So many amazing meals to make.  A lot of the times we do not add the bacon and just salt and pepper it and we just make it on the stove top.  :)

This is truly authentic, just like my Hungarian grandma would make. I used bow-tie pasta instead of the egg noodles, and used a whole bunch more of bacon because it seemed the amount for the recipe wasn't enough to evenly distribute the little bits.

This recipe caught my eye when looking for something to use homemade egg noodles with.  The recipe for Egg Noodles by Linda was the perfect compliment to this one.  Used half the sour cream, twice the bacon and chives for presentation/flavor and this became the most unique outstanding side dish ever.  Lots of work...but worth every second spent!!!  To heck with fast and easy...this dish really rocks!!!

I was a little nervous about the combo of ingredients.  But I had a container of cottage cheese I needed to use and I was feeling adventurous!  Boy, was I glad I tried it-my husband was REALLY happy!  I made a few modifications-I didn't have bacon so I added chopped ham on top.  In the oven it became really crispy.  I also added 1/2 a container of onion dip and 1/2 sour cream.  It really added to the flavor.  This is a keeper!~

This is a dish my parents picked up from my Hungarian grandmother.  We called it "Cottage Cheese and Noodles."  Everyone in my family loves it.  The most important ingredient is the bacon grease.  Leave it out, the dish is bland.  We never cooked it in the oven.  It was all stove top and ingredients served individually and passed around the table.

My mom used to make this when I was a child and I had forgotten all about it until your post. It sounded bland and it had ingredients we typically don't keep in the house but I tried it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. I didn't have bacon so I used leftover smoked sausage, used lactose free cottage cheese and sour cream and served it with a little pepper.

I am Hungarian and love this dish. The only thing I always do is use farmers cheese instead of cottage cheese, and put about 2 tablespoon of bacon grease on the cooked noodles for more favor. Jo etvagyat mindenkinek a fini turos csuszahoz! ;)

I was tempted to add carmaleized onion to this because I was concerned it might be bland, but I stayed true to the way the recipe was written.  I used low fat, small curd cottage cheese and low fat sour cream and I was quite happy with the results.  The baking time is way off, mine needed 30 minutes, but that is easily remedied.  Thanks for a great quick meal.

This was a good dish, the baking time was off a little. I put it in the oven as directed, but it wasn't nearly enough time. I would suggest at least 30 minutes baking time. I put it in for 5 minutes, still cold. Added another 10 minutes, warm. When reheated for lunch, it was amazing because it was bubbling hot and the cottage cheese was soft.

Great!  For a lower-fat version, instead of smoked bacon use Lite Spam, grate or chop it into little pieces, and fry until the bits are crispy and most of the fat is out.  This way you can add more meat for lower fat.  Tastes great!  No need to put into oven unless you want to crisp the top.

This came out really tasty, but I did alter this a bit.  I used fat free cottage cheese and reduced fat sour cream, and also decreased the amounts quite a bit.  I used about 1 cup of sour cream and about half a carton of cottage cheese.  The amounts listed here seem way too much, but that's just my personal taste.  I used just a sprinkling of real bacon bits also. I like to cook as low cal as possible so bacon is not something I buy often.  I also added some sliced scallions on top of this and lots of freshly ground pepper.  I skipped the oven part, I just mixed it all together on the stove top.  I enjoyed this a lot!

I really didn't get this recipe.  It didn't taste bad, but it could be so much better.  Why only 3 and 1/2 slices of bacon for a whole pound of pasta?  It wasn't enough to even give it flavor.  Also, it calls to only bake in a 350 oven for 3-5 minutes??  This dish is still cold!  It totally lacked flavor all around.  Maybe I don't get Hungarian dishes.  I probably won't make this again.

I'm not entirely sure how I stumbled across this, but I'm a huge fan of making new and interesting things. Having no background in Hungarian cuisine, the combination of sour cream and cottage cheese on pasta sounded bizarre--so I knew I had to try it. It's extremely easy to make; at no point did I have to write down the ingredients and amounts, just eyeballed it and adjusted it to my taste. Cooking the bacon as the water boils means this dish is done in under 10 minutes. Super easy. The taste of it is incredible, too--warm and creamy and strangely satisfying. It's so simple and so delicious that it's going to become part of my regular meal rotation, and probably something I will pass down to my children. Thank you!

I stumbled upon this recipe after entering an ingredient search with the very limited ingredients I had on hand. My seven year old is rating it four stars and wants to say "this is a very good recipe and I want to have it again."  I will make it again because it was very easy and kid pleasing.  Next time I will add more bacon.

And I've made this many times. Farmer's cheese is used in the original version, cottage cheese is a derivative of farmer's cheese.  Simply put the cottage cheese in a towel and hang it for a few hours over your sink to drain away the fluid.  Then add to the noodles as directed.  This is too delicious to quibble about details.  I do add some onion, and heat the stuff in the microwave.  This is very simple food, which I dearly love.

I made this with extra bacon and that was the only thing that really saved it.  It was extremely bland.  Adding salt helped, but there was really no flavor for the salt to bring out.  On the up side, it was really easy to make!

Pretty good and simple.  Wanted an easy one pot dinner, and this worked out great.  Would of been fine as is, but to make it a whole meal I added a can of drained diced tomatoes and some frozen peas.  Also topped with carmalized onions along with the bacon as suggested by someone else.  Just needed a little salt and pepper :)

This is one of my favorite foods.  A Hungarian friend started making it for me years ago.   She uses the exact same recipe only cooks it on the stove top.  Delicious!

So good! I'm only giving it 4 stars because the real stuff is made with turo which is nearly impossible to find in Ontario but really makes this dish delicious. It's still very good with cottage cheese. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent and very easy to prepare. I omitted the bacon and added caramelized onions.
Perfect recipe on nights when you don't have a lot of time for prep, but really have a desire for good comfort food.

I tried using some left over ham to replace bacon.  It was great!

I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, but I eventually mustered up the courage to, and WOW! It was delicious, and the bacon really enhances the flavor!

Added garlic, used onions instead of bacon and re-heated in a pan.

I've never had traditional Turos Csusza and I found this recipe looking for a way to use some extra cottage cheese. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out...however, I had to take away a couple of stars because the cooking time did not work out for me. After adding sour cream and cottage cheese, the dish had significantly cooled down and even after 10 minutes in the oven, it was on the cold side. My family wasn't impressed...but when we reheated leftovers in the microwave today and had the dish warm, it was MUCH better. I should have left it in the oven a lot longer, or added the ingredients in a pot on the stovetop, as others have done. Also, I personally feel that this dish could have used much less sour cream. I would make this dish again, but I'd have to play around with it a bit.

This didn't taste as good as I thought it would. It just didn't seem to work. I've never had Hungarian food before. Guess maybe I'm not a fan? Simple to make, though.

good.  Everyone liked it but the 11 year old.  Not being Hungarian I don't know if I'll make again but I thought it was very tasty.

I had high hopes for this recipe but found it average.  I used bowtie noodles and fat-free sour cream and cottage cheese.  The bacon was the best part and it just lacked something in my opinion.

I used low fat cottage cheese, light sour cream and bacon crumbles.  It's very simple, but really good.  I used as a side dish, but it will be making an appearance as a main dish in future!

This recipe sounded kind of bland, but it was surprisingly flavorful. I would just add a bit more bacon next time.

The best Hungarian comfort food ever!  My family and I were in Hungary 2 years ago and my aunt asked what we would like for dinner - I requested she make this. My husband and son cleaned their plates.  The recipe is exactly how my mother used to make it, don't chagne a thing (we don't broil or bake -just serve as is)

I've made this dish for over 40 years now.  I recently introduced my new husband to it and he loves it.  My only omission is the bacon. Since we are cutting down on fat, I just use the noodles and cottage cheese and put it under the broiler to heat the cheese and brown it just a bit.  If you want to sweeten it a bit, carmelize chopped onions in a little butter or substitute and mix with the noodles before adding the cheese.  Also can use the left over dough from making perogies to make the noodles for this dish.
