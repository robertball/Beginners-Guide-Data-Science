They are awesome/easy to make. I added salt/pepper and 2tbsp of italian bred crumbs to the soup mixture. They turned out great. Thank you so much.

Didn't see the point of the mushroom soup.  It didn't add anything to the flavor and it made the mushrooms messy to eat.

I found this recipe by doing an ingredient search...it was as close to how I remember my mom doing her stuffed mushrooms as I could find, but I did make a few changes.  I took the mushroom stems and chopped them finely, then only took about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of stovetop stuffing (I had a can of it, so that made it easier...plus I put it in a baggie and crushed it a little finer)  I fried up the chopped stems in a little margarine, then added the crushed stuffing mix, then added a couple of shakes of parmesan cheese.  The liquid from the cream of mushroom soup is enough to make the stuffing 'stick', and these came out fantastic.

I made this a couple years ago at Thanksgiving and ever since, I get relatives making me assure them I'll be making "those stuffed mushrooms of yours" at every event. Everyone loves them so much and I almost feel guilty because they are so easy to make! I have family members that are allergic to seafood so that's why I first made these instead of crab stuffed ones, and there sure aren't ever any complaints. The ingredients are cheap too! I'm sure I'll be making them for Christmas this year too, thanks for the recipe :)

This was hands-down the best side dish on the Thanksgiving table.  I cooked it a little longer than the recipe said and that alleviated some of the mushy feel. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

The first time I looked at this recipe I sort of chuckled...Then I made it...WOW...

I can tell you this...simple and good.  For those of us who grew up with box stuffing, this recipe adds a little twist to "simple"...The mushrooms covered in the soup is heaven...Just ask some of my clients!

i didn't really like this recipe, although i think i might have if the mushrooms had been fried or something previously, and the stuffing as well. it was too mushy for me.

These were simple and delicious! I spiced up the soup a bit with some garlic powder and pepper, which was a great addition. I will be making this simple side again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
