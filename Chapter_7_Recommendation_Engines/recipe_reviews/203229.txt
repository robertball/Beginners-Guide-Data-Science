The first time I made these I followed the directions exactly and they were OUTSTANDING; light and fluffy as air.  The second time I made them I did not have any buttermilk in house so I made some buttermilk using milk and vinegar.  The second batch was good but nowhere near as good, or as light and fluffy as the first batch I made with the real buttermilk.  I don't know why they weren't as fluffy but if I have any recommendations to make I would tell you to use the real buttermilk for the best results!  Added fresh blueberries to the buttermilk batter and they were delicious that way as well!  This is so very simple to mix together, that I will never use the packaged pancake mixes again.  When I double this I double all the ingredients except for the salt.  I just love making things from scratch for my family whenever I can and this is just as simple as a boxed mix, but much, much better!!!!! Update!  I added a teaspoon of Vanilla Extract to the batter - took this recipe OVER THE TOP!

These were the BEST buttermilk pancakes!  They were super easy to make.  If you have 3 or more people, I would double the recipe.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!!! Also, I didn't change ANYTHING, but I would say it is always preferable to use Buttermilk if possible - and there's nothing like hot maple syrup on top :)  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it couldn't have been easier to make.

I tried this recipe as written and should have known better about the amount of salt it calls for.  A 1/4 Teaspn per cup of flour is enough.  I also think I would cut the baking soda next time to 1/2 teaspn per cup of flour as well.  There's sodium in baking soda.  With the recipe written as it is, I have to give it one star due to the high sodium content.  The recipe as written with the amount of salt plus baking soda makes the pancakes taste like brine.  I couldn't eat it.  I don't mean to be harsh but if anyone tries the recipe as written they will see what I mean.  Next time I will make the adjustments and think it will turn out excellent pancakes.

First time I ever made pancakes from scratch & these were so wonderful & EZ to make.  The directions were well written in describing the batter since it didn't look like any other pancake batter I'd ever gotten out of a box.  The end result was fantastic.  Light & delicious & just as described in the picture.  Thanks!

Yay! Homemade, easy to make pancakes and as someone else mentioned they do taste like Cracker Barrel pancakes! No more Bisquick mix for me. :) The batter was very thick for me, so I added a little more buttermilk to make it a little easier to spread, but I think its because my flour was packed down pretty hard, so there was probably more than 1 cup in there. My son loves them - he devoured three and had one without syrup just because he liked the taste so much. He's already scheming about having the 1 leftover pancake for dessert!

Wow, these were amazing. Everyone loved them, even the kids. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly. I made them again with Robin Hood Nutriblend flour to make these a little healthier and they still turned out wonderfully! Very fluffy and super easy to make :) Thanks for the great recipe!

The whole family loved  these. I doubled the recipe. I was almost out of milk, so I used evaporated milk. Putting 2 Tbsp. of vinegar in it for 10 minutes to make my own buttermilk.  Definitely a keeper! I served these with the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup. Thanks for the recipe.

These were great and super simple!  It seems like too much salt, but it's not.  I made it with unsalted butter.  If I used Salted Butter, I might cut back on the salt some.

the BEST pancakes! I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 tbsp of vinegar per cup of milk and let it sit for 5 minutes. They are great, they are the perfect mixture of fluffy yet not heavy. Normally I am barely able to get through one pancake, I ate three of these!

I made these pancakes this morning and my son thinks they are "BANGIN." They are are the fluffiest pancakes I have ever made and only took minutes. While they were cooking on the first side, I added blueberries and sliced bananas. Soft and buttery....EXCELLENT!!!!!!!

Simple recipe, but WAY too much salt. I think it would be perfect with about half of the salt.

I love this recipe!  I make it once a week.  The pancakes are light and spongy and have a great buttermilk flavor.  Are great with blueberries mixed in or berry syrups.  My kids and husband eat them up like crazy. They freeze well too.

I made these over the holidays while staying with my parents.  My mom accidently bought buttermilk instead of regular milk and wanted to get rid of it.  Boy is this the recipe to do it with.  I am a hard core breakfast eater/maker on the weekends, so I have made my fair share of pancakes over the years.  They all pale in comparison now.  If you like a light BUTTERY pancake then look no further.  They were so delicious most of us ate them plain.  The texture is unbelievably light (if you like your pancakes huge and heavy like a manhole cover this is not the recipe for you).  Now that says something.  They were also good with syrup or jam.  I was very careful not to over mix and let them sit like others recommended.  It does make a small batch - enough to feed my husband and myself and give my mom one.  These are definitely my new go to pancake recipe.  However, I think have the real buttermilk is probably essential.  Yum.  Time to go to the store!

I made these Christmas Eve for my husband and adult children and they were fantastic.  My husband ate them plain with no butter or syrup, just kept plucking them from the serving platter before they made it to his plate.  I added mini chocolate chips for my children and they were delighted.  Thanks!

Whole family heartily approved! My 5 yr old said they were better than Cracker Barrel. That is a high complilment because he would eat pancakes at every meal if I gave him the choice. It is our new Family favorite!

Delicious and super easy! Do half the salt and use buttermilk (do not substitute) and when the batter seems really thick, leave it that way. It will flatten out to make perfect pancakes as it cooks.

These are so yummy! I will probably cut down/out the salt next time, but I rounded 4 1/2 stars up to 5 for this easy, tasty recipe.

I thought these were very good.  I was worried about the amount of salt while reading the recipe, but they weren't as salty as expected or as other people warned.   I added maple syrup on top, so maybe the sweetness counter acted the saltiness.

Delicious, fluffy pancakes! I never follow the amount of salt listed in any recipe, I just put a little in without measuring. I would definitely suggest just using a pinch of salt as mine turned out great & that's what I did.

These were the best pancakes I have ever eaten! I did follow the advice of others and lesson the salt to 1/8 tsp. They were so good that we had them for breakfast and then the kids begged to have breakfast for dinner so we could have them again the same day. Amazingly fluffy and flavorful!

Great recipe! Ya just gotta love it when a few simple ingredients come together for something so good - and there's nothing like homemade pancakes on a Sunday morning!  I added 1 Tbsp. of white sugar along with a generous tsp. of vanilla to take these over the top.  Definitely light and fluffy and delicious topped with real maple syrup.  I served these with sausage, fresh fruit, and OJ!

For years I have struggled to make pancakes that cook through and don't burn.  These are the best I've ever made.  I think its because they don't have added sugar - your syrup or topping makes them sweet.  (BTW - I agree with other reviewers about not using all the salt).  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I love pancakes but always feel that I need a giant glass of milk to wash them down. Not with these. These pancakes are so perfect, you don't need that. I'll never buy pancake mix again!

I made these again and had to change my rating because these pancakes are fab but only with syrup.  The saltiness mentioned in the negative reviews is only evident if you eat them plain or with something other than syrup.  With the syrup, however, they are fantastic tasting.  Plus, they are not as light and fluffy as you would hope.  I think I might try to add a smidge more flour next time to make them fluffier.  If you like pancakes with something other than syrup, I would recommend cutting the salt by half and adding a bit of sugar.  Here in Ireland, most people eat pancakes with their hands rolled up with butter and jam or even plain so this recipe "as is" would not be a great hit here!

Cut the salt in half -- that's the ONLY change I made, based on reviews. I was hesitant to make them at all, but needed to use up buttermilk, so I tried them. Made them for my sons, so just expected to "taste" them. I ate two! They "look" heavy, but are not -- light and fluffy, in fact. USE buttermilk and do NOT over stir! Batter should be very lumpy. I cooked using NO OIL on a nonstick skillet. My nephew's a chef and says NEVER use oil for pancakes! He's right -- try it.

I've made these delicious buttermilk pancakes several times now.  They are always yummy. I didn't change a thing, they were similar but better than Cracker Barrel. I think they were the best pancakes I've ever made.  Actually, I think they're the best buttermilk pancakes I've tried here.  I hate sugar in my pancakes and I love a simple recipe!

I really like this recipe, simple, quick and beats box mix any day. I use whole wheat pastry flour instead and I double the recipe but not the butter, which I use smart balance for butter. I like the fact there isn't any sugar in the recipe since my kids like chocolate chip pancakes anyway.

These were simple to make and so delicious.  My two and five year olds kept begging for more.  I added the TBSP of sugar, but they would have been great without it.  They were yummy when topped with blackberry jelly.

These were so easy!  I whipped them up and had the kitchen cleaned up in under 20 minutes!  If you don't have buttermilk, use 1T of lemon juice or vinegar with the milk.  Delicious!

Well it's time to write a review on these delicious pancakes!!  We tried the Buttermilk Pancakes II, then realized how amazingly easy and great tasting these were.  We've made these reducing the salt a little as well as making them just as printed.   I think some people are sensitive to salt, yet I think they are delicious as the recipes goes.    I tend to add a tad more buttermilk - it stretches the recipe and tastes delicious - but don't stir the batter much.  Let it sit a few minutes and whalaaa!   Well we just really like these pancakes.

It might be a little unfair for me to rate this recipe, since I didn't really make these pancakes as written.  I had some cultured cottage cheese that tastes like buttermilk and used a mixture of that and almond milk instead of the buttermilk.  I'd bought the cultured cottage cheese on accident and I really didn't like the way it tasted by itself, but in this recipe it was DELICIOUS!

I had some buttermilk to use up and no sugar in the house - this recipe was the perfect solution!  Pancakes turned out great, light and fluffy!  Tasted like restaurant pancakes!  I'll definitely make these again for a special treat!

these were delicious! I only used half of the salt, since I don't care for salt. I also didn't have any buttermilk, so I used Powered Buttermilk! Wouldn't change a thing, except next time I will have buttermilk on hand... Much better than boxed mixes of pancake!

This is my new pancake recipe.  I did cut down on the salt.  Next time will try it using soured milk (milk + vinegar).  Nice fluffy pancakes!

Yummy!  I used whole wheat four, so I added a bit more buttermilk so they wouldn't be too thick.  I also added a bit of sugar, but that's not too necessary if you have a good topping.  I'll keep this recipe around!

Great buttermilk pancake recipe.  Quick and simple, just don't over mix the batter, gently stir so the buttermilk and baking soda activate.  Buttermilk lends itself a bit "salty" so if you're sensitive to salty taste, cut back on the salt to 1/2 tsp.   Can't go wrong.

Made it as others said - exactly as written.  Oh was it ever worth staying inside the lines.  These were light and fluffy.  Make a double batch though.  I used a measuring cup to pour the batter as suggested and only got 6 pancakes.  Oh these will be a standard everytime I get buttermilk for chicken marinating!

So good! Came out Perfect. One batch yielded me 6 pancakes. I just used a pinch of salt and a smidge of 2% milk b/c I only had exactly 1 cup of buttermilk.

I thought they came out great! Very light and fluffy. My husband dervoured them because they cooked evenly all the way across (and he's not one to usually eat pancakes). The only thing that I would change is adding a little less salt. Since there is already salt in the buttermilk, the additional teaspoon made them taste a little too salty.

This recipe is definitely worth 5 stars and more!  My husband who is a pancake lover from way back couldn't get enough of these.  I doubled the recipe but forgot to add the butter and they still turned out perfect.  Thanks, cinnken, for submitting a great recipe.

I was looking for a way to use up some buttermilk when I came across this recipe.  I made these pancakes this morning, and they were awesome!  The only thing I added was 1 teaspoon of almond flavoring.  They were light, fluffy and totally delicious.

These were excellent pancakes, my whole family liked them! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the buttermilk because I didn't have any so I did the milk/vinegar thing and they turned out fine. The pancakes were very light and fluffy and 1 batch of batter made ten 3 inch pancakes. This was plenty with bacon and eggs to go with them but if we were just having pancakes I would double the recipe for a family of 4.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Deeeelish! I followed the recipe exactly and these pancakes were super. This was the first time I ever used used buttermilk in pancakes and I will probably continue using it from now on! The ONLY reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I found that they were just a bit too salty, but other than that, 4.5 for sure!

We really enjoyed these! We added a little sugar and vanilla, but we do that with all our pancake recipes for our own taste. I didn't even need to use syrup, and my 1-year old had two whole pancakes!

Great recipe, love the butermilk flavor.  Only suggestion is to cut back on th salt a bit, or use unsalted butter to balance it out.  They seemed a little salty to my tastebuds.

I love reading all the reviews but there are times when a box mix comes in handy.  I use Aunt Jemima Complete - the one where you just need to add water.  The trick to this is to substitue club soda for the water.  The pancakes come out so light and fluffy - as good as or better than IHOP.  I also pour syrup in a glass mesuring cup and heat - yum!

I like to cook but don't feel I'm qualified to even call myself an amateur.  Notwithstanding, I've learned a few tips on how to enhance certain things.  When it comes to pancakes I like to use every little trick I can to make them turn out great because plain buttermilk pancakes are my favorite food in the whole world.  I have been trying to duplicate the flavor and texture of the ones served at the Original Pancake House and have tried adding different flavors and sourdough starters.  I fluff the egg whites, add sugar, vanilla, bring everything to room temp. etc. trying to make the perfect light golden brown buttermilk  pancake.
Today, I decided to keep my tricks to myself and just follow this recipe exactly as is was written.  The results left me humbled.  
This was by far the best buttermilk pancake recipe I have ever tried.  I have previously been a fan of Burygold's recipe on this site but this one blows that one out of the water.
I didn't do anything fancy, I just mixed the dry ingredients together (I did use Saco powdered buttermilk) then added the wet ingredients.  I mixed them together with a wooden spoon until just blended (the batter was lumpy).  I set my electric griddle to 330 degrees and very lightly greased it with canola oil.  I didn't wait until bubbles popped on the top and therefore didn't overcook them.
WOW!!!  They didn't match the unique flavor of the OPH but they were very light and fluffy and extremely delicious topped with butter and syrup.

These were so great and easy. I followed the recipe exactly and my boyfriend loved them!  You may want to double the batch if you have some hungry company or more than a couple people to feed though!

These were perfect! Super easy to make, light and fluffy, and a wonderful down home flavor just like Grandma used to make! This will be a keeper in my recipe box!

These are the best pancakes, my entire family loves them. The only thing I changed was I only used half of the salt, and because we like a thinner pancake I used half buttermilk and half regular milk. My kids say they taste a lot like the pancakes you get at the famous chain pancake restaurant.

These pancakes are the best pancake recipe ever!! I recently tripled the recipe for my family of four and every pancake was eaten! The first time I made them I followed the recipe as written and they were fantastic. The next time I added vanilla and they were still fantastic. Thanks for the only pancake recipe I will be making ever again.

Delicious and easy. I used reduced fat buttermilk and didn't feel cheated; they were still fluffy and rich. I followed the recipe for measuring and yielded 8 pancakes.

I am very picky about pancakes and have been finding a hard time finding a good recipe. These were excellent and as some previous posters said about the salt, I found them to be fine especially with syrup. My daughter who never eats a whole one ate 2.

These were delicious!!  I read a few reviews from people that don't like/sensitive to salt, so I almost didn't add salt.  I did add a little more buttermilk and it stretched the recipe and tasted perfect.  I think that people can salt to taste, but the recipe is yummy!!  It's my new favorite Buttermilk Pancakes recipe, tastes like Cracker Barrel.

Made a double batch of these, adding a carton of fresh blueberries to the batter.  Cooked them on my electric griddle set to "pancake" - took about 3 minutes per side to cook all the way through.  Wonderful with fresh maple syrup and sausage. Will never use a mix again.

Best Pancake recipe EVER!!!! My family quicky adopted these as our new favorite...sorry bisquick...we are going scratch from now on. This recipe is too simple and way too delicious to bother with buying a mix. Light fluffy and delicious prepared just as written. No substitutions or tweaking required!

I really wanted to like these. They were fluffy but they tasted bitter. The second batch I made with vanilla, a bit better but unfortunately not enough.I won't be making these again. Sorry...I really want to love these.

I made these pancakes for my family and they went nuts! I have tried other recipes, but this far exceeds all others. Because the ingredient list is not overwhelming, this is a great recipe for kids to participate with. I tried adding pecans in the batter and using honey instead of maple syrup for a different twist and it was awesome.

I've made this recipe many times. The recipe is ALMOST perfect as written. Cut the salt to 1/2 tsp and you have the perfect pancake recipe. This pancake is very versatile. It's great with grated apple and cinnamon, blueberries, or chocolate chips stirred into the batter. This recipe serves two hungry adults.

These were a big hit, the kids Loved these more than any of the others that we have ever made... Yes no more need for the boxed kind...  The only thing I think is a necessety to pancakes are the crunchy outer edge... However these were just perfect without it... I didnt even miss it. :D Thanks! We will make these more often.

My husband and I as well as grandkids loved this recipe. I thought it was perfect as written, but will try less salt next time to see if there is a notable difference. I like that there is no sugar in the recipe as there is plenty of sugar in whatever topping is used.

I read others reviews and followed the recipe exactly. Fantastic consistency, but incredibly salty! I read other reviews stating this only after I mixed the ingredients together. As is, the pancakes are not good.

I remember making pancakes as a child and this particular recipe brought back some good memories. My eldest daughter deceided to make them for me (following this recipe). I was very pleased with the finished product.

Fantastic, so fluffy!!! The only change I made was to decrease the salt to a half teaspoon as others had suggested. Will make again and again I am sure!!

Just made these this morning and they were excellent.  The batter is very simple to make and the pancakes were very fluffy.  Usually I only put butter on pancakes and omit the syrup because the cakes themselves are too sweet, but since this recipe doesn't call for any sugar I was actually able to use some maple syrup.. Delicious!  Will definitely make these again.

Excellent! We ate them 3 days in a row... we had a litre of buttermilk and didn't know what to do with it... I had never made pancakes from scratch myself... lots of crepes and french toast, but never pancakes!  They were so good I made them 3 mornings in a row to use up the buttermilk.  

On the last day, I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and I thought those were the best!

Thanks!

I love love love this buttermilk pancake recipe.  We've made it many times.   I dislike sugar in the batter, which is just one reason I love this recipe.  Also,  I salt every recipe to taste.  A good cook should always salt to taste and it will vary from one cook to another.  I personally like to add about 1/4 c. additional buttermilk to this recipe to stretch it.  Buttermilk does have a unique taste and perhaps some of the negative reviews are because they just don't care for buttermilk and think it's too much salt called -  i.e. the previous reviewer emphasized saltiness and bitterness.  I really don't understand the review, except they may want to stick with a fluffy pancake recipe without buttermilk.   Now this is just my opinion, but if you must add sugar and vanilla to the recipe, it becomes a new recipe. The simplicity of this particular recipe makes it a winner to me!!

Delicious and easy.  I'd add 1/8 cup extra buttermilk, though.  The pancakes were a bit too thick.

I haven't made buttermilk pancakes in quite a while, so at first glance I thought "no sugar?  no vanilla?" but I followed the recipe exactly (I doubled it), and these were fantastic.  Everything buttermilk pancakes should be - slightly sour, fluffy, and delicious.  We topped with strawberry yogurt and/or syrup.

This is hands down the BEST pancake I have ever eaten!  I would like to say that the first two times I made them, I forgot ingredients and they were still amazing!  First time I forgot the butter, 2nd time I forgot the egg AND butter and were still delicious so the recipe is very forgiving and impossible to mess up.  I will never buy pancake mix AGAIN!  Great recipe (hats off to ya!)

these are sooooo good. my boyfriend and I made these and they were great and very easy. Although one recommendation I have is to grease your pan with a tablespoon of oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. it makes the pancakes have a crispy coating. it fries them a little bit while still leaving the fluffy interior. Thanks!

A very nice pancake recipe!  I added a touch of vanilla flavoring.  Fed to my 7 year old son and he enjoyed as well, as picky as he is!  These pancakes are light and flavorful and rise just as well as any boxed mix and without all the questionable ingredients!

Some of the BEST pancakes I've ever had in my life!!! Follow the recipe *exactly* - YES, the batter will look WEIRD, but it's supposed to! The only trouble I had was spreading the batter on the pan. I recommend using the spatula to do that as soon as the batter hits the grittle.

Thank you so much for sharing a Buttermilk Pancake recipe that is exactly like my Grandma's. My ten+ years of searching is finally over.

TIP: Make more than you need. When the pancakes are cool, toss them in the fridge or freezer. Hungry? Throw a couple in the toaster. YUM

I was looking for a simple tasty buttermilk pancake recipe. This was the perfect match. Throw in some blueberries or chocolate chips and Bam! Kids love it. The batter is very resilient(?). I accidentally folded a pancake over while flipping it. The pancake did not fall apart and my daughter cut it down the side and made a pancake sausage taco :).

This is great! I omit the salt because I find baking soda to add plenty of salt for me, and I tend to add about two teaspoons of white sugar to my batter to get these to brown up beautifully. Just my preference! Also, these work really well subbing out buttermilk (vingar + milk, lemon juice + milk, plain yogurt thinned with milk or water, etc) if you don't happen to have any buttermilk on hand. I still recommend trying the buttermilk in this recipe though; it's unbeatable! Great recipe.
(TIP: melt your butter in your preheating pancake pan; any butter residue leftover just saves you the step of greasing the pan! Also, don't re-grease after the first pancake. The butter in the batter will keep it from sticking, and if you add a bit of sugar these will come out pretty and golden like restaurant style flapjacks!)

YUM!! The best pancakes I've EVER had!! I did like another reviewer did and added a teaspoon of Vanilla Extract and it surely did take it over the top. 

I will never buy boxed mix again as this recipe will become a part of our family now. {:O)

Do yourself a favor and read the negative reviews. They all say one thing. TOO MUCH SALT. They are inedible, I must have been stupid to believe that 1 cup of flour needed that much salt.

These pancakes are the best... hands down! They were so light, moist, and fluffy. The only thing I did was cut back on the salt, added a little vanilla and a little sugar to the mix. They are definitely better than any other pancakes I've had. You will not be disappointed with these! Yummm-oooo!

These are so good! Don't mix the batter too much. Pancake batter is supposed to be lumpy, even though many people don't seem to know that. Like someone else suggested, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and kept the rest the same! They're already all gone!

Very Good Pancakes - I doubled the recipe and next time I will not double the salt as one other review stated - It was a bit too much.
Thank You, we enjoyed these pancakes!

Made the recipe just as submitted. Very easy to make and so delicious. Much better than any box pancake mix. Whole family loved them. I even added frozen blueberries to half of the batter and they were wonderful as well!! This recipe is a keeper.

YUMMY!!  These are out of this world.  I did the vanilla and 1T. sugar...they came out perfect.  The old man had a fit...he's been around almost 62 years..and he said they were the BEST he'd ever eaten.  I don't know what it is about buttermilk but it makes everything better.  I will use this as often as I can.  Can hardly wait to make these for the "kid"...he will be blown away. Thanks "cinnken" for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.  Any more???

I just love how easy these are to come together in no time at all. Had some buttermilk that needed to be used up and needed to make a quick dinner tonight so,.......breakfast it was! Only thing I do different is add 2 tsps of vanilla extract to the liquid portion. Otherwise, it's made exactly as written. This batter makes about 10, 4 inch pancakes. Not quite sure how anyone can get 12 6 inchers. I had an assortment of syrups and toppings to go with and my personal favorite was a cinnamon apple syrup w/ whipped cream. Yum!

Buttermilk makes the best pancakes! You can buy dried buttermilk for greater convenience.  You can also make a buttermilk pancake mix & will only need to add the wet ingredients when ready to make them.

This is the most delicious pancake recipe ever!  And so simple!  I can't believe how light and fluffy they are.  I don't usually get pancakes in restaurants because they are heavy frisbees.  Also, I found a powdered cultured buttermilk in the baking isle of the grocery store, which I also use for cornbread recipies. You can keep it in the fridge and always have buttermilk available.

They would have been good if the recipe hadnt called for so much SALT! I thought it seemed like a lot and should have gone with my gut instincts and ommited it, but I didnt. If you plan on making these OMIT the salt!!!!!

I had leftover buttermilk and didn't want it to go to waste. I added blueberries to half of the batter and chocolate chips to the other half. Easy to make. I made extras and froze them in individual bags

These turned out GREAT!!  Everyone had seconds and asked me to make them again.  I doubled the recipe and used only 1tsp. of salt, I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat, and I added some ground cinnimon.  YUM!!  Definitely will make these again.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a great pancake recipe!  Very tasty!  I have been looking for a great and easy pancake recipe for a while and I think this one might be the winner.  I would agree on less salt though, I used 3/4 tsp. and it still was a little too much.  Next time I think I'll just use 1/2 tsp.  I also used powdered cultured buttermilk, found in the baking aisle.  I mixed the ammount with the water, let it sit for a few minutes then dumped it in, and it turned out great.  This made 6 medium size pancakes, so it was enough to feed me and 2 little ones.  Thanks again!

Everyone in my family LOVES these pancakes. They are so light and fluffy and super easy to make. I don't add the butter I use oil instead. I also add around 1/4 cup of water to thin it out a bit. SOOOO GOOOOD THANK YOU!!!

My family LOVED these. I agree with some of the other reviews concerning the salt. I will not add as much salt the next time. I actually tripled this recipe as there are five of us and refrigerated leftovers are a MUST for the next day. I added 4TBS of sugar and a tsp of vanilla and mini chocolate chips. FABULOUS! Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled this, used half whole wheat and added two tsp. of baking powder. I wisked together the dry ingredients, then folded in the wet until the dry ingredients were just moistened. These cooked up really fluffy. I served these up with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, which really made them extra yummy. I portioned out the rest in freezer bags and stuck them in the freezer for busy mornings.

I made these this morning. I have to say, they were really very good! I made them for myself and my 10 year old son and his friend. When my son took the first bite he said "Wow...these are so fluffy!" They ate every last bite. Very good recipe. The only thing I may change next time, I might half the salt. Still, loved these and will make them again!

Very fluffy, very tasty pancakes made right from the recipe with no modifications at all. My go to pancake recipe from now on, as long as I have some buttermilk on hand.

I used all organic ingredients,  and fresh laid eggs. These were the BEST pancakes ever. My husband does not usually like pancakes, but he ate these and said don't loose that recipe! I doubled the recipe, except for the salt. Perfectly fluffy and delicious.

Tried this with my kids this morning and they loved it. I made my own buttermilk as we didn't have any (1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice and top up with milk to 1 cup and let sit for 10 minutes makes 1 cup of buttermilk)The kids thought they were just like McD's pancakes I will definitely make them again

I have tried many pancake recipes, but this one takes the cake lol! I used buttermilk powder instead of fresh buttermilk for mine and they turned out amazing. It gives just the right amount of tangy and creamy flavor. You can find buttermilk powder next to the baking supplies (flour sugar etc.) in the grocery store. Basically you just mix it with water and viola buttermilk. So I pretty much followed the recipe except for subbing the powdered buttermilk about 5 tbsp and about 1 1/4 c  to 1 3/4 c of water (depending on how thick you like the batter). I also added a few tbsp sugar and 1 tbsp vanilla extract. I just mix all of the dry ingredients together like the recipe says and then mix my buttermilk powder in with the dry stuff. Then add the eggs and melted butter (careful not to add hot butter we don't want scrambled eggs). Last add the water, watching the consistency of the batter as you pour it in and whisk so it doesn't get too thin (don't over mix). Remember after you open the buttermilk powder to store in the fridge. So simple and sooo delicious! Easy ingredients to have on hand. My family loves this recipe! 
Note: Trial and error has shown me to use less liquid in the recipe when you are subbing the powdered buttermilk for fresh. Fresh is pretty thick so you need more. Also you may have to play w the amount of buttermilk powder you add according to the amount of tangy flavor you personally like, 5or 6 tbsp. was good for us.

This recipe truly is the best buttermilk pancake recipe!   So light and fluffy!  I've only made one modification.   My family thought they were a little sour from the buttermilk, so we added some sugar. 
It's also good with blueberries dropped onto the pancakes right after you put them on the griddle.

I had to add an extra 3 CUPS of flour!!! If I didn't the batter was water. The taste was good and so was the texture. And by the amount of pancakes this recipe made it looks like we will be eating pancakes all weekend long.

Absolutely dee-lish when the recipe is followed exactly.  I agree with another reviewer that the amount of salt doesn't need to be doubled when the batch is doubled.

Only change I made - I cut the salt to 1/4 tsp.  Made these this morning for my teenage son and as a 'breakfast in bed' for the hubby (who's a chef). A big hit!  I should've doubled the recipe though, as I only got to taste one :)

AMAZING, perfect pancakes. I was out of buttermilk so I used yogurt and a little milk - they were great! I can't wait to make them again with true buttermilk this time! This is the recipe I will teach my kids to make!!!

I followed this recipe precisely, and it was way too salty tasting!  Some of you may be thinking I used self-rising flour, but no... I used plain all-purpose flour.  I did, however, use salted butter.  I will make these again, but next time I'll cut the salt in half at least and use unsalted butter.  The texture was perfect and they were fluffy.

I had a craving for homemade pancakes and tried this one because I had no baking powder....wow. These are terrific! I won't buy boxed ones any more. I did have to use the milk/vinegar substitute for buttermilk, but I'll make sure I have buttermilk on had just to make these. Thank you!

These turned out fantastic!  So light and fluffy.  Because they are so fluffy you could eat 4-5 without blinking and eye, so be careful.  Not hearty at all, but good for the occasional treat.  I've needed to add additional buttermilk every time I've made these to make the batter pourable.

I'm assuming I messed up somewhere along the way because they were not fluffy or light.  They were very flat, but I'm giving the low rating because they were too salty and just not tasty.

First, to address the salt issue, I like my pancakes salty (I don't like my pancakes sweet at all... I like the salt/sweet combo of a salty pancake with sweet syrup) and I found cutting the salt in half is perfect. I have made these twice. The first time I added about 1/3 of the flour as wheat flour - delicious! The second time, I made the recipe as written, but doubled it for company. Perfect again! The recipe doubles well. This recipe, with half the salt, is now my only base pancake recipe. My guest for breakfast this morning said, "These pancakes are money!"

This would be a 2-star if they hadn't turned out so fluffy. Many reviewers said this was too salty but many also said this was perfect as-is, so I thought I'd give the author the benefit of the doubt and try it as-is. The batter was wonderfully fluffy, and the pancakes rose beautifully while cooking. Though the fluffiness is perfect, the flavor was VERY salty and bitter from the baking soda. I tried again and cut the salt in half, added 3 tsp sugar and a few drops vanilla and the flavor was a little more balanced, and still just as fluffy, but they were still salty and my husband did not like them, even with syrup. This batter is very thick and takes a bit longer to cook, so I found turning the heat down to medium and keeping a close eye on them kept them from getting too brown. IF I make this again, I will reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp, add 3 tsp sugar and 2 drops vanilla. Also, I added about 2 or 3 tsp more buttermilk the second time and it was not necessary to spread the batter with the cup, they turned out perfectly round and still just as fluffy.

My family loves these pancakes! They are extra fluffy.  I sometimes sneak in some chocolate chips and/or blueberries in there, and they love it.  You can definitely do variety with this to make them fun.

Hands down the best pancakes I've ever made.  I added 2 Tbsp. white sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla to the mix, let it sit for about 10 minutes before cooking and there wasn't a scrap left at the table.

Never thought you could make a pancake without baking powder.  Followed the recipe to a T, and they were the BEST I've ever made.  I wonder if increasing the buttermilk by 1-2 T. would be better.  I let the milk & egg warm up, and still the batter was quite thick.  Stop looking for pancake recipes--this is the one!

These were awesome! I had to substitute some ingredients because I didn't have them, but will share my changes. I used nonfat milk with 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon lemon juice stirred together and let sit for 5 minutes in place of the buttermilk. I also separated the egg and beat the white until stiff and folded it in after mixing all the other ingredients. I will definitely be making these again soon! Thank you for sharing!

Way too salty. My children, who adore pancakes, wouldn't even eat them. I would make again but reduce the salt significantly and perhaps add a bit of vanilla to sweeten.

Definitely a keeper!  Even though I used rice milk and lemon juice in place of the buttermilk, they were still super light and fluffy. Make a double batch, or you'll be left with kids begging for more!

This was terrible. Don't waste your milk and eggs! WAY TO MUCH SALT! I'm sure it would be fine if there was a 1/4 of the salt recommended. We had to start all over again.

Thanks to this recipe, I have finally made wonderful pancakes!!  I added a splash of vanilla, and I sprinkled on some chopped pecans before flipping the pancakes over. I had to make them one at a time in my cast iron skillet, so I kept them warm in the oven. They turned out perfectly, and they were so easy to make. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are excellent! I doubled the recipe but only added 1/4 tsp of salt.  And I added 2 tsp of vanilla extract.  BOMB! When my 3 year old says,"mmmmmmmm delicious!" Then I know it's a winner.

Alright, I'm no master baker but pancakes should be pretty easy, right??? Wrong!!!!!! This recipe leaves out a few important tips that you need to know. 

First of all, DO NOT FORGET to sift your dry ingredients together before adding the wet ingredients!!!!! If you don't sift the dry ingredients, you will be hit with a salt pocket in the middle of your pancake. My second complaint is that these aren't sweet enough, although that's a personal opinion. Next time I will be adding some sugar on top of vanilla extract. 

They did turn out as fluffy as advertised! Just be warned, the directions are not complete.

Too Much Salt! These are great pancakes, light and fluffy, but needs less salt. I could only eat one and that was it. Even my husband and son couldn't eat more than one. I hated to have to toss out what was left. I had made a double batch of these because pancakes get devoured in my house. I will make these again, but I will cut back on the salt, and possibly the baking soda. I should've known better because the pancake recipe I usually use only calls for half the amount of baking soda and salt.

We love this buttermilk recipe.  I just hate paying for pancakes at a restaurant these days.  It's so easy to make quality, "tastey," pancakes at home.  I've made this for visiting family members as well as our friends daughter and every one of them loved it!  Thanks!

I chose to make these because they were highly rated, required few ingredients, and also called only for buttermilk and not normal milk like most of the other recipes do. I only had buttermilk in my fridge leftover from something else, and although I could probably just have substituted buttermilk in those other recipes anyway, I have actually never made pancakes before so I wanted to do it 'by the book.' Well, these were pretty good but they were even better when I folded frozen blueberries into the batter. Topped with organic maple syrup and fresh blueberries.

Next time I make this I think I'll drop the salt content a little bit.  They weren't too salty but if you use a lot of salty butter they might be.

After reading the reviews I decided to try these.  I used only 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  They were great!  Fluffy and good but the recipe calls for a little too much fat for my preference.

These are delicious! The first time I made them they came out a little thick in texture and a little to salty. I always use salted butter, so now I cut the salt in half and add a half teaspoon of sugar per batch with a little splash extra of buttermilk. For a family of five I make a double batch with only about two pancakes left over. Everyone loves them!

SCRUMPTIOUS! Nothing quite like buttermilk pancakes, and this particular recipe is very lovely indeed. Like other reviewers, I cut the salt to 1/4 tsp and cooked the pancakes in butter. Very fluffy, excellent flavour. Would definitely recommend (given the salt modification).

I'm always on the lookout for a good pancake recipe. When I came across this one, which I made for my husband's and my own family, I not only enjoyed every bite, but everyone gushed about how delicious they were and that they wanted the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful pancake recipe.

I may have rated these years ago, but they are so good I have to do it again.  Just making a quadruple batch right now as the kids are getting ready for school - it was a special request from my graduating senior. This might be the biggest thing he misses when he goes off to college.  

The only thin I do different is use salted butter instead of adding salt - it's perfect every time.

These pancakes were light and fluffy and crispy around the edges.  I substituted whole wheat pastry flour for half of the flour and this worked very well.  I served them with real maple syrup and sliced strawberries.  Using a 1/3 cup measuring cup for the batter only yielded 8 medium pancakes.

These were awesome!  Definitely going to make these again.  I doubled the recipe, as I was serving breakfast to four 11 year old boys (birthday party sleepover).  

I was hoping that doubling the recipe (to get 8 servings) would feed four kids plus two adults and two teenagers, but it wasn't near enough.  It pretty much only fed the four kids and 1 other person.  So if I'm in a similar situation again, I would triple or quadruple the recipe.

I think this actually might be the perfect fluffy pancake. I made one test pancake and I have to admit that I couldn't put my fork down after the first bite.

We absolutely love these! I have already made them three times and are planning on making them tomorrow morning. I just found this recipe a couple of weeks ago and I am so glad I did. I will never use a pancake mix again. I always double the recipe to fit my family of 5 and I only use the amount of salt required for one batch. Also, I add 2 tsp of vanilla extract. These are great and my kids love them! Thanks!

Worked well, but I mix eggs, buttermilk and butter before I blend into flour. I also use 1- 1/4 cup of buttermilk.

Ignore the reviews that say too much salt. Just make sure to use unsalted butter.

Very light and fluffy. I followed the recipe to the letter this first time, using 1% buttermilk. I would reduce the salt next time though, as it was very noticeable.

I made these because there was no sugar, and I wanted to make something. They were okay with syrup, but too salty even though I put in less than 1 teaspoon.

I wanted to take a moment to say that these pancakes ROCK.  Not only do I think these are the most delicious pancakes I've ever eaten, they are embarassingly easy to make.  This is my favorite buttermilk pancake recipe!  I've been trying different recipes on the site and these remind me of Cracker Barrel!  They're perfect.  Thank you very much for sharing it.

The combination of the salt, baking powder, and buttermilk makes for a untasty mouthful of pancake. I suggest not using this.

This original recipe was super good just the way it was, but I wanted to see if I could substitute to make it a little healthier.  Used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour.  I only had 3 medium ones with lite syrup and it was very delicious and filling.  This is the only way I will make pancakes from now on!  FYI Note:  Not only do the ingredients on pancake mixes read like an elaborate science experiment (not healthy!), but if used after expiration, it has been known to make people extremely sick!

Perfection. LOVE this recipe. So simple, yet so flavorful. I have made these for the most persnickety of breakfast aficionado. This warms peoples belly's and smiles faster than hot choclate. You'll never make another buttermilk pancake recipe. I haven't. Thanks for sharing!

I had a horrible pancake craving and since I didn't have any mix I used this recipe.  I had to make some changes because I didn't have all ingredients at hand.  I used yogurt instead of buttermilk (it turns out you can't find it where I live) and used sunflower oil instead of butter and they were absolutely delicious!!!!  I will never go back to buying mix.

Love Buttermilk Pancakes, and these are the best I have tasted. Didn't change a thing in the recipe, and I am thinking that strawberries or strawberry syrup would be wonderful.

Exceptional recipe. Very easy to make and easy to alter (I added 1/2 cup of why protein to the mix to increase the protein content...doesn't alter the taste one bit). I have made these about 4-5 times in the past couple of weeks. This is definately a keeper!

I subbed half the flour for white whole wheat and egg beaters for the egg and added a tablespoon of vinegar to skim milk.  They really do taste like Cracker Barrel's!

This is very easy to make.  I have replaced the flour with whole wheat flour.  While the pancakes are still very fluffy, they were a bit dry.  I think it would have tasted better with white flour.  DO NOT SUBSTITUE.

Very good, but too salty.  I hesitated when I added the whole teaspoon of salt, but decided to follow the recipe exactly.  I was right--way too much salt.  Great recipe, though, and I'll definitely use it again with half the salt--or less.  It was a good way to use up the extra buttermilk from my red velvet cake.  My kids didn't love them because they're used to Bisquick, I guess.  LOL

I cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp salt and added 1 tbsp sugar. I wanted them to be a bit more fluffy, but they were pretty tasty so I will make them again.

Nix the salt and add 2 tablespoons of sugar, that will take care of the saltiness and sour taste.  Not too bad after that.

I thought these were too salty.  The texture was good, although my husband complained that they were gooey in the middle.  If I make these again, I'll only use 1/2 tsp. salt, and add 1 Tbs. of sugar.

Very easy and good, just a little salty. I would suggest maybe 1/2 a tsp of salt instead.

I searched many buttermilk pancake recipes after seeing my guy seriously impressed by some uberperfect ones he ordered in one of my favorite breakfast spots. I decided to give a try to making them from scratch. I usually don't make them, or if I have to, it's from a package mix.   This recipe seemed the easiest and made sense, so I followed it almost exactly with a few exceptions:   1: I added 1+ teaspoon vanilla with the wet ingredients. (There were just a few drops beyond 1 teaspoon left in the bottle, so I emptied it!) 2: I only used 1/4 teaspoon salt, after reading the reviews. This was adequate. I wouldn't add more than that when I make them again.  3: I added 1 tablespoon sugar to the dry ingredients. 4: He liked how puffy the ones he ordered were, so I separated the egg, whipped the white till very foamy, almost stiff, and folded it in at the very end. I do think this helped make them more light and fluffy.   I think this was a great recipe, and I think it will be the one I use when I make them again. I think the flavor was great and the texture of the ones that turned out right was very nice. I really don't make pancakes often, so I will need to perfect the process of cooking them correctly.   I used butter to cook them in and I think it burns too fast. I would either use cooking spray (blech) or canola oil.  Also, I'd like to eventually incorporate whole wheat flour to make it a healthier breakfast.

great and super-easy!! I added 1 - 2 tsp of sugar and equal amounts of flax meal lol so the fiber could justify the sugar in my own mind.  Family loved them.

These pancakes are way too salty so I unfortunately couldn't eat them and had to throw away the batch.  Pancakes probably would be good with just 1/4 tsp of salt.  If you are trying these for the first time I recommend you don't use a full teaspoon of salt.

These pancakes are very good except for the fact that there is so much salt in them. Putting syrup on them kind of mutes the saltiness but if I make them again I will definitely reduce the salt to at least 1/2 or 1/4 tsp.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and found a couple of things I'd like to work on to make perfect even more perfect: (1) omit or use half the amount of salt (I used salted butter); (2) when doubled, I could taste the baking soda, so the next time I double the recipe I won't double the baking soda; and (3) experiment by adding a little vanilla extract and/or lemon juice.

Buttermilk makes all the difference! These were great! One thing I will change for next time: either use unsalted butter, or omit the salt. I used salted butter and the recommended 1 tsp of salt and found them to be too salty. Very light and fluffy though. I used this recipe to make waffles.

i thought these were delicious... my husband thought they were too eggy. i doubled the recipe, and added a tad more buttermilk than called for because as is, it was pretty thick. these pancakes had a similar taste to french toast actually, which i LOVE. but like i said, my husband was not a fan. neither is he a fan of french toast. mainly because of the "eggyness" but anyway. my daughter and i loved these. very fluffy, very tasty. i would have given it a 5 star if my husband would have liked them also. thanks for sharing this recipe! i will be making it again for my daughter and i for sure!

These are a very good basic pancake, but they are exceptionally fluffy. If you like very airy, bubbly pancakes I recommend them. I made these with milk and vinegar instead of buttermilk(what I had on hand), and I thought the amount of salt was just right. I may make these again sometime, but my husband wasn't crazy about them.  They were so light they were almost like a dessert. I had them with maple syrup, but I have a feeling they would be even better with berry syrup next time- thanks for this tasty recipe!

I only had the powder to make buttermilk, so I just used milk.  They turned out SUPER fluffy and very delicious!  I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips and bananas (cut in slices and then quartered).  This is my FAVORITE breakfast!!!  Yummy!

We omitted the salt and added sugar in it's place. The first two cakes were kind of flat, so we just added a little more flour. We love butter and brown sugar on our pancakes. These were good. Thanks.

I am so glad I tried this recipe. I ran out of baking powder and needed a recipe that used baking soda instead. Didn't have fresh buttermilk on hand, so I reconstituted some SaCo powdered buttermilk (only substitution). My family LOVES these pancakes--in fact, the only criticism that my 8 year old daughter could come up with was, "They're good, but not as good as IHOP." Of course, she still ate 3 saucer-sized pancakes with gusto. :)  I plan to order more powdered buttermilk and make this recipe next weekend.

I was trying out a new grill I received for xmas, and used Mom's Buttermilk pancake recipe OMG, its amazing. Everyone gobbled down the pancakes, first time I have ever used buttermilk only because I had some left over from the holiday cooking, now I will make sure that buttermilk is on my shopping list when I run out. I will definitely try this recipe again and again I did add a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to give them a sweet taste, and also only used 1/4 tsp of salt, I think that's a bit too much salt for pancakes just need a sprinkle to enhance the taste. Better then any pancake I have ever made. tx

Fantastic recipe. I did reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp based on other reviews but then followed the directions exactly.  As the recipe states, you do have to spread the batter once you poor it onto the cooking surface.  This is a keeper.

These are perfect little pillows of perfection! These are really easy, nice texture, and very tasty. No changes needed. I make double batches and never have leftovers. This recipe is a keeper.

Have never tried this recipe before.. Last homemade recipe I tried my kids thought I'd used the "just add water" mix... This one got everyone's attention!!  Reminds of our favorite pancakes the we eat only once a year in Mammoth at "the Stove".  Loved this recipe-- would NOT change a thing, especially the salt.

I have to confess that I have often purchased frozen! However, after reading the reviews, I decided to try them. Wonderful, I did use less salt (1/4tsp) and incresed the buttermilk to 1 1/4 cups as I like a little thinner pancake. My husband loved them as well. I had fresh strawberries and a wonderful blueberry syrup that was enjoyed by all. This is my new "go to" recipe and it was easy too. Always a plus!

WAY, WAY too salty.  I wish I would have read sunfluer's review before I made my pancakes.  I'm sure it would have been a wonderful recipe with reduced salt.

This is our go to pancake recipe, it's perfect, except I add a tsp. of vanilla because we really like vanilla.
Recently I didn't have buttermilk and they turned out very flat like shoe leather, maybe my soda was old or maybe I over mixed, they usually never come out this way...always light and fluffy. The salt content seems to be fine for us also.

OMG- WHY did I ever use box pancake mix?? These were super easy to make and were SO DELICIOUS! I added chocolate chips :) One Tip: if you are using salted butter you my want to leave out the extra salt -- I used unsalted butter.

delish! a simple basic recipe that turns out so good and 'buttermilky' tasting! my husband said these were better than crackerbarrel, and believe me, that is something! Next time I will use unsalted butter in the recipe, and that, will be perfection!

I read reviews before I make anything, but this time I didn't, I just made these real fast one morning for the kids because I had some leftover buttermilk. These were seriously delicious. I eat low-carb, but they just looked so good I had to try one, it took all the will-power I had to not eat more. I cooked them on the skillet with my bacon, so they were very slightly crisp, and they were probably the best pancakes I have ever eaten. They were very fluffy, I didn't change a thing, thanks for this recipe.

I have to agree with "sunfluer" that there is WAY too much salt in this recipe. It tasted like I was eating very salty pretzels. I figured the salt amount was a typo. I reduced to 1/4 teaspoon salt and all was perfect again. Oh and I LOVE salt. so with that little adjustment, this recipe is great.

A little on the salty side, next time I'll cut back on the salt. Also I added 1 tsp vanilla extract. Everyone in the family, except the pickiest kid, gobbled these down.

These pancakes were super delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly but as someone suggested, I added 1 tsp. vanilla and tripled the recipe.  I served sweetened strawberries and whipped cream on top.  Kids loved them and keep asking for more.  Thanks for sharing.

I used freshly ground spelt flour as that is what I had on hand and soaked it in the buttermilk overnight. It was so easy to make and came out delicious! It is definitely one I will serve again; it satisfies even those who have a special taste for that boxed pancake stuff.

I always manage to somehow bungle my pancakes (I know, that is a very weird Achilles heel), but this recipe is so easy and they turned out really delicious and fluffy.  The only change I made was only using 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  Also, I added fresh strawberries just before flipping on half the batch and it was just as delicious as the plain ones.

Perfect pancakes! I did reduce the salt to a pinch only (make sure to use kocher salt!) and it was perfect, light fluffy and airy.i  Added chocolate chips, the additions to this recipe are endless ( e.g. bluberries). If you have a big crowd double or triple the recipe. Thx for sharing!

i have made this three times in the last month and they are so good, they dont even need butter on top. I have also used frozen buttermilk and it still worked great! (buttermilk is hard for me to use up the whole carton before it goes bad so i measure out and put in tupperware in the freezer. It has a slightly separated consistency but always tastes great in recipes). Thanks for posting this recipe! It is a staple at our house now!

These are UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I've made them 4 times, already and my hubby and kids LOVE them.  
I made the recipe as written (I thought) the first time, but it turns out I had too much flour.  Even so, I added more and more buttermilk until they were JUST pourable.  They turned out fabulous!  The 2nd time I made them was weird.  I'm not sure what happened-I made them exactly as written and though the flavor was good, the texture was not.  It was bumpy and squishy in places.  The pancakes themselves came out flat and flabby.  I'm not sure exactly what went wrong, but I suspect the buttermilk I used wasn't good.  I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with the recipe, because the 3rd and 4th time I made these were a hit.  They turned out PERFECTLY.  The 4th time I made them, I added about 1/2 TBS of cinnamon and 3 capfuls of vanilla, by the way.  STUPID DELICIOUS.  :)
The recipe does a great job of describing the way the batter (almost dough) should look, and that is REALLY helpful (especially for those of us used to making instant just-add-water pancakes).  
I will never, EVER make instant pancakes again!!  Thank you SOOOOO much for freeing me and my family!  :)

These are pancake perfection! I have been looking for a recipe for made-from-scratch pancakes, and now my Bisquick days are over. I took the advice of the reviewer who said to reduce the salt in the recipe, so I used 1/2 a teaspoon of salt instead of a whole teaspoon. I was able to make 8 medium-width, thick pancakes from this. They had a buttery flavor, and a soft and fluffy texture.  They didn't absorb too much syrup, either. I was also able to eat one plain, without butter on top, since there is such a butter-y taste within the pancakes.

This was our Christmas morning breakfast today, and it was perfect! Cinnken, thanks for sharing.

DOubled the batter to get 18 pancakes - 1/3 cup each panckae

My family really enjoyed these pancakes!! I did not have any buttermilk, so I substituted milk and vinegar.  Surprisingly, they still turned out nice and fluffy. I also added a tablespoon of sugar per batch, and replaced the butter with oil. They ended up being absolutely perfect!! Our new go-to pancake recipe for sure!! Thanks for sharing:)

My husband was in the mood for pancakes and I did not have any mix.  The last time I made them from my cook book, he said they were edible, so this time I turned to the web, found your recipe and HE LOVED THEM!  He gives you 5 stars. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Delicious!  I will never buy another pancake mix again! We had just picked blueberries and added a few to each pancake. Amazing light, fluffy, and fresh buttermilk flavor.

These are hands down the best pancakes ever.  I am keeping a copy to take on vacation to Maine.  I've almost always made mine from scratch; these take it to a whole new level. Thanks!

These are very yummy.  I also tried them with fat free buttermilk, and no butter to cut down on fat and they were just as good.

A bit too salty. I made a double batch - I shouldn't have doubled the salt.

Otherwise, fantastic!

These were almost perfect, except there was too much salt.  I took the first bite and said how good they were, and then after swallowing, all I could taste was salt.  Will definitely make them again, but will just use less salt next time.

These were awesome!  Best and easiest pancakes ever made.  I have no idea why but they were the fluffiest panccakes I ever made.  I used salted butter so I only put in half the salt.  And I would suggest beating the eggs a little in a seperate bowl first so you don't have to over mix the batter.

All I tasted was the flour and the baking soda.  So each bite was like a spoonful of flour with syrup on top.  
Wonder if the recipe is missing something?  I followed it exactly.

These were fantastic!!  As per other reviews, I halved the salt and found that to be just right.  I also added a tsp of vanilla as my family prefers that. A total hit!  This is definitely in our rotation!

These were very good.  I think next time i will add 1 tsp of vanilla as one reviewer suggested.  I don't use maple syrup so I would have liked some sweetness to it but that is just my tastes, but the pancakes were delicious!

Really light and fluffy but I thought they had a little too much salt in them.  I'll make again but cut back on the amount of salt.  Don't know if I add sugar if that will take away from the fluffiness but might try that as well.

I read the ingredients on what I thought was a healthier boxed version for pancakes, saw it had "bleached" flour and threw the box in the trash!  We don't have pancakes very often, but I knew I had to find a healthy, delicious and easy recipe! This is a good one.  I knew 1 tsp salt was too much for this amount of batter, so I cut it that in half.  Didn't have buttermilk, made my own, added 1 tsp real vanilla extract.  I made the batter yesterday, had the pancakes this morning with unsalted butter and real maple syrup!! Keeper!  Tweak it yourself if you like, have fun with a basic good recipe.  I will add melted coconut oil along with the butter next time, maybe mix 1/4 c each of coconut flour and whole wheat flour to the basic recipe!  I'll let u know how it turns out!

I have other pancake recipes that are good, but this is better than any of them. I have never seen a pancake recipe that didn't call for baking powder. Soda and powder are similar but powder, I believe, has somthing else added to it. I think it is cream of tarter. Anyone know what there differences are, please share. Anyways I did use 1 and1/4 cup buttermilk, I don't like real thick batter, it was still thick but awsome. I used half the salt, 1tsp vanilla, 1 Tbls sugar, and put blueberries in each cake after on griddle. Made 5 six in cake. Best!

This is the pancake recipe I have been searching for! They are very light and fluffy just like a restaurant. I took off  one star because of the saltiness. I used unsalted butter and after reading a lot of the reviews, i only added half a teaspoon of salt and they were still a little too salty for my taste. So maybe a heavy pinch of salt next time, and there will be a next time.

I've never been a huge pancake fan, and in the past, I always just used milk instead of buttermilk, but we had leftover buttermilk in so I tried these this morning - great, light, fluffy pancakes - these are delicious!

The texture and flavor of these was perfect, but I subtracted a star because they were extremely salty.  I think a whole tsp. is too much, so next time I make them I'm going to reduce it to 1/2 tsp.  Otherwise, they were delicious!

These were really good when the recipe is followed. The recipe deserves all five stars just as is. I think that  they would be GREAT if I added a little splenda and vanilla and a pinch of baking powder.

These were way too salty!!  As other reviewers noted, I did use salted butter, but it can't simply be due to that.  I would half the salt for sure next time, still worried that may be too much...

This recipe is Wonderful! I made it twice. The first time exactly as written, delicious. The second time I did cut back on the salt a little bit you don't need it. and added a splash of vanilla. Fantastic I will make no other pancake recipe this is it for me.

Excellent!  Per other reviewers used only 1/2 tsp salt, and added 1 TBS Sugar. My kids (who are very picky about pancakes, they don't like the boxed mixes) really liked them...yay!

I'll give it 2 stars because these were super fluffy. But, the taste was way too salty. However I will try these again, because I did like the texture of the pancake. I just won't add any salt.

My family loved this recipe! I'll be punting the bisquick as well. The pancakes are wonderful if you following the recipe exactly as it is, but I added about  a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of sugar because we like them a little bit sweet. This recipe is so easy and SO much better than bisquick!

I loved this recipe!  The pancakes turned out light and fluffy and so good.  My only complaint was that they were a little salty.  I think I'll cut the salt in half next time.  I also did one batch with real buttermilk and one with "homemade" buttermilk.  The real was much better, but both were still good!  This recipe is a keeper!

This one deserves more stars on the simplicity and finished product! I was looking for a quick buttermilk recipe that required a few ingredients, and not a huge list.  I used low fat buttermilk, whole white wheat flour and 1 tsp. vanilla and left out the butter.  They came out fluffy and delicious! It was like we went to the popular pancake house, but these were tastier and HEALTHIER! You can't tell that these are whole wheat with the using white wheat.---------------------UPDATE:  These are just so good and easy to whip up.  I made them again with whole white wheat and added frozen blueberries.  I leave out the butter in the batter and just use it to top my pancakes, if I want.  Just so yummy!  Don't forget to add 1 tsp of vanilla!  I never get 12 pancakes from this recipe, more like 6.  If cooking for more than 3 people, you will have to double or triple the recipe.

this is destined to become my new standby. Made exactly per the recipee and they turned out great. 

I can only guess that the poor reviews below have more to do with the tartness of the buttermilk that most people are unaccustomed to as the mixes and powdered buttermilk do not actually taste like real buttermilk. 

And to the person who complained about the taste of the baking powder... please read the ingredients a little more carefully next time.

Definately way too salty. Even without reading the reviews I knew to add 1 Tbsp of sugar to the batter but even with pancakes drowning in the maple syrup we  couldn't get over the taste of soda and salt in our mouths. The consistency of the pancakes is beautiful, but next time I'm definately going to reduce salt to 1/4 tsp, soda to 1/2 tsp and add 2 Tbsp of sugar and 1/2 tsp of vanilla in.

I was very surprised not to see not even 1 little TB of sugar in this recipe.  But I went ahead and made it as is.  It tastes VERY salty!  BUT, once you add syrup or jam they were so delicious!  My kids (11 and 6) like to eat them plain and they both commented on the saltiness.  When I suggested next time I will add sugar, they both said No.  That with the syrup they tasted great and that they would still eat them without.  Okay then!  We have a new buttermilk pancake recipe.

Very good recipe.   Because of the other reviews about salt I reduced the salt to less than 1/2 teaspoon.   Will make this recipe again and again.

Bye, bye ihop. This is a great pancake recipe!!!! We made it on an electric griddle (which is truly the secret to good pancakes....and good fried eggs for that matter). It was a bit salty, I will half that next time. I also added a tiny bit of water to make them thinner...personal preferance, but not necessary. I didn't think they would cook in the middle because they were so thick, but this concern was unfounded. They came out perfect!!!! Fluffy, yummy, the best pancake recipe I have tried.

I liked this a lot, but my pancakes were quite salty (perhaps I'm just sensitive to it--I don't know).  I will definitely make these again, but will cut down on the salt next time!  They were nice and fluffy.  My husband thought they were delicious.

We tried this recipe tonight as a way to use up some buttermilk. We were not impressed. The pancakes had a very strong buttermilk taste and sour after taste. I've had other buttermilk pancakes that weren't this potent.  Be forewarned if you don't have a taste for buttermilk. :)

I made this exactly the way the recipe was written, and I was not too impressed.  They were very fluffy, but I didn't like they way they tasted.  They were a bit salty.  I decided to make it again without the salt, and it tasted like there was something missing.

Well, I jacked this recipe up entirely.( I did double it to make 8 servings) But still, it made a really good pancake. What I intended to do, was to use whole wheat flour, substituting 1/3 cup flour for milled flax seed. I mistakenly added baking POWDER instead of soda..so I threw in some baking soda anyway...added two tsp van extract..that proved to be too much..did not have quite enought buttermilk..finished it off with 2%. Added a little truvia and sprinklede with cinn chips during cooking...family still loved them! So...you could say this recipe is foolproof! :)

overall pancakes were pretty good, better than store bought pancakes.  after reading the reviews I expected the pancakes to more fluffy than they were.  I cut the salt in half and wil probely use more salt next time and may add a little sugar.

Basic pancakes. I added just a tsp of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I made some plain and added rhubarb and chocolate chips to some. Nice use for extra buttermilk!

Very good, but definitely reduce the salt - I'd say by half.  The saltiness took away from the flavor quite a bit.  Otherwise, a nice basic pancake with a buttery flare, both flavorwise and in color.  Will definitely make again, but with half the salt.

1 teaspoon salt to 1 cup flour??! How has this not grossed anyone else out? It needs WAY less salt, probably 1/4 teaspoon, and about 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup more flour. Following the recipe perfectly yielded flat, salty pancakes.

I think this is a great basic recipe to add on with your favourite ingredients to increase the flavour a little. I found that it was a little bland the first time I made this, but they were definitely fluffy, light and easy to flip! I added vanilla extract, cinnamon and a tablespoon of sugar the second time around. This is a recipe that also calls for extra toppings like chocolate or maple syrup/fruit etc. Overall, this wouldn't be my favorite recipe for buttermilk pancakes - so fart, I found Truck-Stop Buttermilk Pancakes the best!

I made this recipe just as stated.  They were so light and fluffy. No more box mixes for me! As others have said, they were salty,  but I contribute that to my error and not necessarily the recipe's fault.  I used melted margarine instead of butter.  There is a considerable difference in sodium between the two...margarine 1Tbsp 130mg-butter 1Tbsp 3mg.  I also noticed there is a considerable amount in the buttermilk I use.  Next time will cut the salt at least in half and use butter instead.  Lesson for me is ...don't fault a recipe if I don't read all the labels for my ingredients.
Made it again this morning.   1/4 tsp salt and 1/4tsp baking soda.  Perfect!

The amount of salt is too high.  Cut the salt by half, or more.  For a little better taste, I add a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

These are delicious! They are also very fast and simple to put together. I make them exactly like the recipe says. I have added fresh fruit like  blackberry's and blueberries before and it's delicious too. Do yourself a favor and try these! :)

Ive tried this recipe exactly how it instructs several times but for some reason i get a melted butter taste you know that strong smell when just melted? Its kind of strong so ive added a couple splashes of vanilla extract hoping to get that taste yet the melted butter taste over powers it.  I like that they are fluffy but ill continue trying different portions of the ingredients to perfect it to my liking. Overall its an ok recipe how i make it of course.

I used only 1/4 teaspoon of salt since many others said the recipe called for too much salt.  Overall, the pancakes were ok.  The texture was fine, but they didn't have much flavor.  I will look for other pancake recipes to try.

Based on past reviews of this recipe, I decided to tweak it on my first attempt.  I doubled the recipe, and to that I added 3 tsp. sugar to the dry ingredients, and 2 tsp. vanilla to the wet ingredients.  For someone who has been in search of a great pancake recipe, and who has tried various versions over the years, these were, by far, the best pancakes ever!  I gave it a 4 because I had to change it a bit, but it ended up as a 5!

These pancakes turned out very salty.  In the future I would substitute the salt for some sugar.  I did add about 1 tbsp of vanilla, which helped it.

I tried this because of all the great reviews.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy, but terribly salty.  If you make this, cut the salt way down.  These are nearly inedible.  They also taste a big eggy and bland, other than the salty aftertaste.  I will keep looking for a good pancake recipe.

I made these pancakes today using the ingredients as listed. The only thing I did differently was that I mixed the dry ingredients together in one bowl, and mixed the wet ingredients together in another bowl. I also let the wet ingredients come to room temperature before gently folding the wet into the dry. I would think it would be difficult to not overmix if you added one wet ingredient after another into the dry. These cooked up very fluffy and made 8 large pancakes. We did notice the salt, but it wasn't overwhelming. I will cut the salt in half next time, but these were easy to make and tasted delicious. 4 stars for unclear directions.

Made the following changes based on other reviewer's comments: cut the salt to 1/4 tsp., I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I had never made buttermilk pancakes from scratch. I had left over buttermilk and decided to make pancakes. Read several recipes and decided on this one. Made the perfect amount for my husband and I. We agreed they were fluffy and tasty. Will be making this again.

Made these the morning, I thought they were salty (and I love salt) and very heavy. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I cooked them in a cast iron skillet.. My family said these are ok but you've made better. I really wanted these to be better then they were.

Tried this receipe and my wife and kids love it. Easy to make, light, fluffy and every bit as good as we have had in the US when on our holidays. These are now cooked every week in our UK home for Sunday Brunch and remind us of great times. Thanks and thoroughly recommended

Family loved them with syrup!  I though they were too salty so cut the salt to 1/4tsp, and baking soda to 1/2tsp.  Second batch turned out much better.  I eat them plain so the flavors stand out more.  Once you add sweet syrup it cuts the salty taste down significantly.  Will be making these again, but with the reduced salt.  Both versions were light, fluffy, tender and very easy to make.  Love buttermilk!

I agree with the most critical review that it doesn't need a teaspoon of salt. A quarter teaspoon is plenty. These are fantastic though. Definitely a keeper.

I make these for my son, but I veganize easily with Earth Balance, energy egg replacer and I take unsweetened soy milk and add 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and let sit while I do everything else to replace the buttermilk, I also add some chocolate chips and they come out perfect!  You can freeze and reheat for more easy breakfasts too.

Pancake perfection! Ridiculously easy, with ingredients I always have on hand. I decreased the salt by half, as it seemed like too much, and I might suggest lightly beating the egg before adding it to the mixture, but otherwise perfecly easy and straight-forward recipe! I subbed half white whole wheat flour with no issue (read: my boyfriend didn't even notice). Also, for fun, I added diced banana to a few of the pancakes. I WILL make this as a go-to pancake recipe!

Easy and Delicious! When I read the recipe, 1 tsp salt sounded a little too much salt to me, so I went with my gut feeling and only added 1/2 tsp salt. I think it was perfect that way, I didn't want it to be any saltier. Second time I tried it, I added 1 tbsp sugar and 1/2 tsp salt. This version came out great too. Both times I used real buttermilk. If you have any doubts about adding a whole teaspoon of salt, my suggestion is to try making it with 1/2 tsp salt first, and then see if you want it any saltier. This is going to be my go-to recipe for pancakes from now on!

Excellent pancakes! Make your own buttermilk by adding lemon juice or white vinegar to regular milk (I used a tablespoon of each). Stir it in and leave it for a few minutes before adding to the rest of the pancake mixture. If you have leftover Ricotta cheese, I highly recommend adding 1/4 to 1/3 cup to the batter for really splendid pancakes. I added a couple more tablespoons of flour to compensate for the additional volume from the added Ricotta cheese. Topped off with hot syrup and sliced fresh strawberries -with whipped cream, if you like - my family loved them.

Thought this was great.  I did follow another reviewers suggestion because the salt seemed like a lot.  I halved it.  My kids love me to add bananas and chocolate chips to our regular recipe so I did (and vanilla) and it adapted wonderfully!  I made no other adjustments,just added our favorites.  I've never actually made buttermilk pancakes and these were good!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I had some buttermilk in the refrigerator and thought I'd try this recipe to use it up.  Glad I did because they were absolutely delicious!  One of the easiest recipes ever and they were as light as air and super tasty.  I added just a tiny bit of vanilla with the liquid ingredients and used slightly less salt as I was using unsalted, melted butter. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

It was great! No problems whatsoever. Perfect sweetness with just a hint of salt. Perfect serving amount for 3 adults, 2 pancakes a piece.

This was the first recipe I used to make homemade buttermilk pancakes with, and I was afraid to try other recipes because this one is so DELICIOUS!  I finally tried another recipe (because I needed less than this) and it was awful.  I will never use another recipe besides this one again!  I make it exactly as it is written, and they are the most delicious pancakes I've ever had!

I never make pancakes because they turn out too thick and rubbery to be eaten.  I tried this recipe because the picture looked most like the pancakes I like, not too thick yet fluffy.  The results were amazing. Finally after 62 years I've made a good pancake.  The batter was quite thick so I added more buttermilk (1 1/4 cups total) and maybe 3 tablespoons of water to thin the batter.  The results were amazing.  Thank you for sharing.

Every homemade pancake I've attempted has always tasted like it was missing something. Flavor, probably.

I almost never have buttermilk on hand, but I'd bought some for a chicken recipe that required marinating chicken breasts in buttermilk.

This recipe is awesome. I mostly followed it, but I only had unsalted butter and I didn't really measure the buttermilk. I should have though, because I added too much and the mix was too thin. I just added a little more flour and an extra pinch of b. soda and it worked beautifully. 

Fluffy, flavorful, and no preservatives. 

This recipe has changed the way I'll shop, as I'll try to always have buttermilk on hand from now on. 

Thank you cinnken and cinnken's grandma!

Have to say this was the best buttermilk pancake I ever had. It did not fall apart from the butter and syrup. I made these for a birthday breakfast and it was a hit with everyone. I too doubled the recipe but not the salt. It yielded 18-6 inch pancakes. It's a great base recipe. I look forward to adding elements to the batter. Thank you, Suzanne

As written, this recipe needs some changes.   I had to add a little more flour as the batter was too runny.  Also, if I were to make these again, I would decrease the salt to 1/2 t...maybe 1/4 t.  The texture was nice though; nice and fluffy.

This is a great and simply recipe.  It taste great much like old fashion buttermilk pancakes.  I gave it 3 stars because of the amount of salt.  I was concerned about using 1 teaspoon in a recipe that only has 12 servings.  However I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.  You can taste salt and if you view the nutrietion information you will see that the sodium milligrams far exceed the allowable amount per daily serving.  I will make this recipe again but I will reduce the amount of salt.  If you like salt and don't have any health issues related to high sodium content then this may be okay for you.  However,  if you need to watch your sodium please reduce it for this recipe.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I followed the recipe exactly (using leftover buttermilk from a Christmas recipe) and they came out perfect - light & fluffy. On a side note, the recipe says it'll server four - it served me &  my husband with no leftovers. (Granted, he did eat SIX!) If I was cooking for more than 2, I'd double the recipe.

I doubled this recipe and got about eight 6 inch pancakes. Otherwise, this is a good recipe. I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of sugar per cup of flour. Stir by hand and don't worry about the lumps. Let the mixture sit for about 5 minutes before cooking.

Update:
I made them again, this time just changing the recipe slightly. Doubled the recipe, used half the salt and added just a capful of vanilla extract.
My family loved them. They raved about them being better than any restaurant around.

I make these pancakes for my husband and I must say that they are wonderful!  They come out perfect every time.
This is a great recipe and I will never buy a box pancake mix again.

Easy and delicious recipe, but way too salty! I use only 1/4 tsp. Even 1/2 tsp is too salty. Wonderful with the addition of blueberries and thinly sliced banana!

These really are the best......easy, absolutely delicious.  Don't try to tweak the recipe; it is perfect just as it is.  I first made them because I had buttermilk to use up, and this recipe is short, sweet, and the pancakes were unbelievably wonderful.  Thank you cinnken.  Your Mom's buttermilk pancakes are blue-ribbon certified!

I would love to rate this recipe higher because the pancakes were very light and fluffy. However, they were too salty! Was I the only one with this issue? And, no, I didn't accidentally use a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.

The best pancakes I've ever made!  I'm 49 years old and I have never been able to make a fluffy pancake, even if I use mixes like bisquick and such.  I can't make a good biscuit to save my life.  But these pancakes are light fluffy and yummy, even for a non-cook like me.

This is a simple but delicious recipe.  It is an excellent base for a variety of pancakes.  I've made it twice and both times added bananas, defrosted blueberries and chocolate chips.  I also recommend reducing the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  I have also added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla as well as some cinnamon.  I recommend also letting the batter stand for at least 5 minutes before cooking.

I doubled the batch, and it turned out excellent. I did make a few modifications that made the batch perfect.

(Remember this was doubled)

(1) teaspoon vanilla
(2) tablespoons of sugar
(2) cups of buttermilk, the rest of the liquid was water.

I agree with the comments about reducing the salt (I cut it down to 1/8 tsp). Other than that, this is an excellent recipe! Very fluffy pancakes; the whole family loved them.

OK, after reading this recipe & reviews I gave it a go. I resisted my temptation to adjust the recipe with adding sugar, but i heeded the reviewers saying to not adj anything. Well, THEY WERE RIGHT. Don't add, or omit anything. Light and fluffy pancakes are guaranteed. Also, do what other reviews say....DON't mix it smooth..leave lumps. They come out perfect!! BTW, this recipe is perfect for 2 large adults. More people = doubling  + the recipe

I doubled the recipe, used full fat buttermilk and omitted one tsp salt due to using salted butter.  I blended my liquids together and added to the dry. Quite tasty, very easy and filling.  My only complaint is that they weren't as fluffy as I was anticipating.

Batter was really thick, so I added a little more Buttermilk.   think I will leave out the salt next time b/c it was a bit too salty for my taste.  Otherwise very good.

Following the recipe as written: These were indeed light and fluffy, the batter was just as odd as described, however the taste left something to be desired.  For my household's taste profile these were too bland.  I will use the recipe as a base in the future though.

This was good, however I used unrefined seasalt for mine and it turned out SUPER salty.  I think the amount of salt needs to be decreased if you plan on using an unrefined product. otherwise, yumm :)

Just tried these pancakes -- very easy and very delicious. My only criticism? For the amount of batter you end up with, that's way too much salt -- for health reasons and taste reasons. When I make these again, I'll probably use 1/4 teaspoon. I though one tsp. seemed a lot, but wanted to follow the recipe the first time. But IMO, that's too much.

These would be exceptional pancakes, but they are so salty.  I only use course salt for baking & cooking and that could be why it tasted saltier.  I will probably 1/2 the salt next time.  Also, if you are souring milk to make buttermilk, I think only 1 cup is needed vs. 1 1/8 c.  They do melt in your mouth and that I love! :)

Good, tender pancakes, but I could taste the baking soda. Maybe I didn't get it mixed in enough, but I did whisk the dry ingredients really well together before adding the wet ingredients. I do like how quick and easy this recipe is to throw together. Just as easy as using a boxed pancake mix, and better, no preservatives!

I am SO glad I found this recipe.  I did find they come out fluffier if you cook longer on the first side than second (until all bubbly).  I also cut the salt in half and added a little vanilla, but that's just me.  The recipe is just as perfect as it is.  I will NEVER buy a boxed mix again.  THANK YOU!

EXCELLENT RECIPES, BUT TOO MUCH SALT! I think half a teaspoon would be good enough. I followed this recipe to the "T" and it came out fluffy and moist - just tasted too much salt. 

Thanks! :)

Since this was the first time I had made this recipe, I followed it exactly and the pancakes were very good. I only gave them 4 stars because I thought they were a bit too salty so next time I make them, I will do as others have mentioned and use half the salt. Just for variety I will try them with blueberries and/or vanilla extract. Oh, and using 1/3 cup batter for each pancake gave me 7 pancakes. Very good!

These pancakes are yummy, fluffy, and light.  I tweaked it a little by adding sugar to the flour mix and vanilla.  Very good and will definitely make these again.

I'm not a pancake person.  I know, shocking.  I am the only one I've ever met.  I don't like maple syrup, and I don't like pancakes soggy with maple syrup.  Whenever I try to make pancakes I waste half the batter trying to get the heat and timing right.  Also pancakes, to me, always have a weird, slightly metallic taste, like there's too much baking powder or something.  However, I don't think I've ever had homemade pancakes before.  I was browsing on here late at night and these sounded really good, so I whipped them up.  I used a vinegar and water substitute for the buttermilk.  I'll have to try them another time with real buttermilk, but even as they were I really liked them.  I had them with peanut butter.  I didn't notice any of the weird taste I usually get with pancakes.  I'm guessing that taste probably comes from some unnecessary additive in the mix.  My only other complaint was that these seemed a little salty.  I might use unsalted butter next time or go with half a teaspoon of salt.  With how easy and cheap these were to make from scratch, I don't know why anyone ever uses a mix.  Next time I want to add the vanilla, as someone suggested in the comments.  I burned just as many as usual, but these were good enough I might take the time to become a pancake person!

Phenomenal pancakes.  I added a tsp of vanilla for added flavor.  My family loved them!

This satiated my craving for pancakes this morning! This is now my go-to recipe for pancakes, though I will reduce the salt next time.

These were so good.  I have tried so many pancake recipes from this site and this is one of my two favorites.  I had mine with homemade strawberry syrup, my daughter had homemade cherry syrup, and my son went for chocolate chips - all three were excellent. I also like the amount it makes, the last pancake recipe I tried here made about 5 times more than we needed and even though it said it refrigerated well, it didn't - this was the perfect amount and I would rather make a new batch each time than use leftover batter.  I like that with no added sugar or flavorings, they were such a great vehicle for toppings.  thank you for the great recipe!

Edit: Wish I would have read my review first! This was too salty so I dumped in a bunch of sugar. These are okay but really flat and not fluffy. Not our favorite, we soured the milk and this was a runny mess. I had to add an extra cup of flour and it could have used more (tripled it). Next time, a different recipe if I don't have buttermilk.

What is with the SALT content?  I could taste the salt in each bite.  Maybe I'll try again with no salt added; my wife and I were unable to finish our 2 pancakes despite them being fluffy and covered in fresh maple syrup; nothing could cover the salty taste.

Pancakes were a little flat tasting to me. I added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and a 1/4 tsp of sugar the second time I made them everyone thought they were much better.

Out of buttermilk, try substituting almond milk if that is something you normally drink and have on hand.

I love this recipe!  I like a sweeter pancake, so I added 2 tablespoons of sugar.  They were fantastic!  I also eat Gluten Free, and was able to just sub in GF mix (brown rice, white rice, tapioca, potato mix) for the flour, and it turned out wonderfully!!

I too found the recipe quite simple, although the salt was a bit much.  Perhaps it's because I used regular salted butter?  I will make them again with this very important adjustment!

I cooked these this morning and made them as directed.  The only thing I added was a teaspoon of banana exact, and topped them with fresh bananas and strawberries.  They cooked evenly and beautifully, and it made enough for me to freeze some silver dollar pancakes for my kids to have later in the week for a really quick breakfast.  Very easy, nothing weird or hard to do. If you are like me and keep powdered buttermilk in your fridge, then you should have all of these ingredients on hand!  This will be my go to recipe for quick, noncomplicated pancakes from now on.

Terrific buttermilk pancakes!!!  They couldn't have been easier to prepare.  We were eating in 15 minutes, what more could I ask for?  Quick, easy, delicious, 6 ingredients.   I followed the recipe as-is. As all recipes, I salt to taste. The buttermilk can enhance the salt, feel free to cut back or even use unsalted butter if you desire.  It's your preference, I happen to like as is.  Delicious and the best buttermilk pancake recipe on the site.  I topped them off with maple syrup, but you can eat these with just a pat of butter, they have so much flavor!

Total pancake awesomeness!  I read over several reviews, and the only complaint I kept seeing was that they were too salty.  So I cut the salt in half.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 tablespoon a sugar per other reviewers.  These were the best pancakes I've ever made!  They smell sooooo good, too.  I made them with lowfat buttermilk, because that's all I could find at the store.  My second batch, I actually ran out of buttermilk and was a couple tablespoons short and that batch came out even thicker and fluffier.  Hubby says they were even better than the ones his mom used to make.  Great recipe!

Just a little too much salt for my taste. I think next time I would cut the salt in half. Otherwise it was a pretty good recipe. The batter is well described, as it is not what you would expect the consistency to be.

I followed the recipe, however using the dry buttermilk (adding the water with the wet ingredients) and it was a little too tart.  I'm going to try it again with less buttermilk.  Otherwise they did come out fluffy.

Mine weren't so fluffy but I am sure it is because I didn't have real buttermilk but I wanted to try it anyways. I made one cup of lemon/milk and then added another 1/8 cup of reg milk.  That was I am sure my demise.  Without the extra milk, I am sure they would have been better but my grandson was helping me and I wasn't paying attention as well.  But the flavor was good, I did add a tsp of vanilla.  He was hungry so there wasn't much time to let the batter sit.  So I will definitely try it again as I am sure it is all operator error :-)  But for what it is worth, he was ready to make some more.  :-)  Thank you for sharing.

I did not care for the amount of salt in the recipe, a half teaspoon would have worked better, they were very salty.  However, we still enjoyed them, and I cut down on the amount of butter too, I didn't need that much to make them tasty.

I cut the salt in half and added a touch of brown sugar and a bit of confection sugar. Then I mixed in some blueberries as they were going into the skillet and they came out wonderfully. Great basic pancake recipe with a few modifications to taste.

I make a lot of receipes for the 1st time and I always follow the instructions. The meals always come out perfect. However, this time I followed the instructions but when I took a bite of the pancakes all I got was a mouth full of salt. Blah, do u even need salt in pancakes?

I added no salt.  Next time I will change the baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon.  Pancakes were very thick with 1 teaspoon.  Both my husband & I loved the taste and texture.  We will make this recipe  our go to for pancakes.

Excellent pancakes......I'm 76 & have made them this way forever!  Tip.....instead of butter, put in 2 Tbsp. bacon grease!  Really adds to the flavour & the Vanilla is good to add in too.
If you don't have buttermilk, just add 1 Tbsp. any vinegar to the milk & let it sit for 10 min.  Works just as well to make them 'fluffy'.

My son asked me to make him pancakes, that was a week ago and I made have tried several different recipes. But today...I found THE ONE! It also is the easiest with only 6 ingredients.

Loved it so much I had to leave a review, thus had to create an account here in the site.

Thank you!

Waaaaaay too much salt! I added a little less than 1 teaspoon, as I used salted butter both in the recipe and to grease the skillet.

Was almost too salty to eat - even the maple syrup couldn't disguise the too-salty flavor.

I'd recommend leaving the recipe as-is except changing the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.

1 teaspoon of salt for 1 cup of flour is waaayy toooo much. this recipe made 9 pancakes for us, so I would double this recipe next time and still only use 1/2 tsp of salt. The pancakes rose nicely and were nice and fluffy with great texture. I will make again with adjustment to salt.

This was delicious. Will never cook box pancakes again.  My 1 yr old loved these pancakes. He doesn't like syrup so I have to give him a plain pancake. He has never ate his whole pancake. After making your buttermilk pancakes and adding just a splash of vanilla extract they were good. I cut his pancake up, sat him down, put the plate in front of him, and OH BOY! Did he eat the whole pancake.  I was so happy after seeing him eat his whole pancake. My husband like them too. This is going down in my recipe book. I will always and forever make Mom's Buttermilk Pancakes.

I think that I broke the record for "Making The Most Changes In A Recipe". Here are the changes that I made:

- I added 1/3 cup of flour
- I added 1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder
- I used 1 1/4 cups of 1% milk instead of buttermilk
- I added 1 tsp Vanilla
-1 pinch of Cinnamon
- 3 1/2 TBSP White Sugar

This was OK. We didn't have buttermilk in the house. Thanks for the recipe!

These are really good, pancakes should be made with buttermilk. Keep a little carton of real buttermilk in your fridge, it tastes so much better than vinegar and milk.  Always salt to taste and don't use salted butter in these.  :-)

I make lots of baked items and these were awful, I tried doubling the recipe and I should’ve know that just baking soda wasn’t going to end well. They looked great but the baking soda taste with the buttermilk was pretty awful and I would get little pockets of baking soda while eating them. If you drenched them in syrup you couldn’t taste it but I think I’ll stick to other buttermilk waffle recipe.

No substations. It made 7 excellent, tasty pancakes and as easy as from a mix. Well, almost. I like the buttermilk twang.

Texture was very excellent, but they tasted very salty. I would recommend reducing the salt, but yet say by how much.

Easy, Quick, and a Crowd Pleaser. I made these for 7 family members and everyone liked them. They were filling. They were light and delicious. I cooked them in the skillet with butter and I added 1 tsp of Vanilla.

They are great. The buttermilk adds a nice bit of tanginess. I did add 2 t vanilla. Still the buttermilk came through. I use Karo pancake syrup and it complements the taste perfectly. I also used self rising flour. It already has salt and soda. Works fantastic.

Easy recipe  and came out very fluffy. Way too salty even for my husband who puts salt on everything. Would decrease to 1/2 teaspoon salt and add a little sugar or vanilla to sweeten a bit.

I have been making a recipe similar to this for many years. Always loved by everyone. My only difference is that I used 2 cups of buttermilk instead of the 1 1/8 cups. So good!

MY family uses this recipe all the time! We absolutely love it! If you don’t have buttermilk, you can use the same amount of normal milk, and stir in a teaspoon of white vinegar. It creates a quick buttermilk!

I REALLY wanted to love these pancakes. I made the recipe as stated with the exception of adding 1 tsp of vanilla. They smelled great as they were cooking. I would give them 5+ stars for fluff and texture! However, they tasted a little too flour-y. There was not much flavor to them at all and we needed a lot of syrup to make them palatable (and usually don’t like adding soo much sweetness to my pancakes but that was all we had). They may be a good base pancake for adding fruit so that you’d get the flavor of that fruit? I’m not giving up on this recipe yet, though. I may try them again w/a tablespoon of sugar and some blueberries....

It was okay. I thought the one teaspoon of salt was too much. I used unsalted butter. Tasted very eggy and salty and wasn't light and fluffy like actual pancakes.

WOW, is it ok to say pancakes are amazing??!!!  Super easy, deliciously fluffy with crispy edges and as good as Perkins pancakes,  (the best restaurant pancakes!!)  The only change I made was I cut the salt down to 1/3 tsp and tripled the recipe.  Also, these are fantastic the next day in the microwave.  This will be the only pancake recipe I use from now on!!!

I've never made homemade pancakes before, sadly I've always used bisquick. Today I made these and my family really liked them. I added some blueberries to the last few and that was great too. I'll make these again, very easy. Only change was about half the salt.

This is my first negative review but I was very disappointed in this recipe. I made this exactly as written. The pancakes did rise nicely but were not done in the center. As noted by another reviewer I could taste the salt in them as well. I won’t be making these again.

While I was making the batter I actually went back and double checked to see if I wrote down the 1 teaspoon of salt wrong -- that's what it said. I should have trusted my instincts. These have W-A-Y too much salt in them. I don't know if the recipe measurements were cut back and they forgot to reduce the salt, but these were terrible as is. I made waffles which all ended up in the garbage can uneaten. My poor boyfriend ate 3 of them before I had one because he was afraid to tell me how bad they were, but I finally got him to admit it. So we at least got a laugh out of that. They might be good with much less salt in them because they did look good. I generally like salty stuff too, but these were nasty.

Made according to the recipe...way too salty. Cut the salt by half or more. Add a teaspoon of sugar. 
I'll make them again with z lot less salt and with sugar.

WAY too much salt. The recipe should call for half that. Maybe 1/4 teaspoon. this needs fixed.

The recipe is a good starting point, but there is way too much salt called for. I would half or even quarter the amount of salt recommended. There is something else missing from the batter, though I can't pinpoint what it is; perhaps some vanilla or other type of flavor infusion.

I've been looking for a good buttermilk pancake recipe for a while, and this is it! I did make a couple changes to the recipe. I used only 1/2 teaspoon salt, and I added 1/8 cup of sugar. I also normally double the recipe, and it produces 10-12 pancakes. The whole family (including my mom and dad, who were visiting the first time I tried it) loved them. They have just the right flavor.

I'm glad the recipe mentioned that the batter is thick. It's definitely less runny than any other pancake recipe I've tried. Make sure you spread it out with the measuring cup on the griddle so they don't come out too thick. Also, the uncooked side may not bubble as much as other recipes, so make sure you don't overcook them. 2-3 minutes per side at 300 F seems to work well.

CRAZY SALTY!!! Almost inedible and I felt sick after eating a few very small pancakes. Significant changes would need to be made to salt content to make this ok.

I found this a bit salty with no sugar to balance out the saltiness. Halfway through, I added some sugar and canned pumpkin, and thought it improved the taste.

Wow! I'm not a good cook and even this is foolproof! After Thanksgiving, I had extra buttermilk and was wanting ideas using buttermilk. These were amazing and oh so delicious! I had two pancakes (less than the 1/3 cup as suggested) and they filled me up. I paired this with "Grandma's Buttermilk Syrup" recipe (which I had never made before either). You can't go wrong!

These are the best buttermilk pancakes I've ever made and I've been making pancakes from scratch for 62 yrs.  They are  tender and light as air.  The batter is thick but don't be tempted to thin it.  I doubled the recipe but didn't double the salt.  This will be the only pancakes I make from now on.  My only regret is not finding this recipe sooner.  Absolutely delicious!  I'd give it a 10 star rating if I could!  I got 9 large (roughly 6inch) pancakes plus one little test pancake with the recipe doubled.  I don't think hubby will grumble about the high cost of buttermilk from now on. LOL

Just made them for breakfast. Was questioning in thought the amount of salt but I followed as called for in the recipe. As another review mentioned I would reduce the salt . Normally I do read the reviews prior starting a new recipe.
Hubby still enjoyed them- its a keep* with less salt

Overall it's a good recipe, but I felt it needed about 1/4 cup more flour. I just used regular 2% milk with lemon juice added -- I'm sure it's even better with real buttermilk.

I made a version of this for the autoimmune paleo diet. Used 3/4 cup cassava flour instead of regular flour, pure fermented coconut yogurt in place of buttermilk, 1/2 apple instead of egg and added cinnamon and vanilla. It worked pretty well, but—if you try this, watch the salt!!

The coconut yogurt was so salty that 1tsp in recipe was way too much.

When making batter, salt to taste. At least, if you’re using wacky substitutions like I did. :)

These are the best, but a wee bit salty. I make with a 1/2 tsp. salt and slightly more buttermilk. That makes them perfect. Buttermilk is naturally salty, but it’s all a matter of personal preference. Absolutely delicious!

This is quite honestly the best pancake recipe I've EVER tried, hands down. Try it once, and you'll never use a boxed mix again. And forget those fussy recipes where they want you to beat the egg whites into foam and then fold them into the batter. Not only do these pancakes taste better, they're sooo easy to make.

The only thing I changed was the amount of salt the recipe called for. I cut it down to 1/2tsp. Still could’ve done with less but these were very good none the less. I will definitely make these again because they were good, quick and easy:)  Next time will only use 1/4 tsp. per cup of flour though!

I didn't mind these, but  I have other recipes I prefer and will not use this one again. There was too much salt for my preference, and not enough liquid. (I didn't even use the full amount of salt and still found them too salty!) These are personal preferences, and could be modified if I didn't have other recipes I like better.

I loved these pancakes they turned out just like the picture! I do usually cut the salt in recipes down. I cut it to about 1/4 teaspone with this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing I'll be saving this recipe to make again for me and my husband.!!

Made these for the first time exactly as directed, and they were awesome!! I got 14 pancakes out of the recipe, and I could hardly step away from the stove before I was getting requests for more! 
I will make these again and again!!!

This is a wonderful recipe! I’ve tried a few others but this one is one of the best! A couple of the others were disappointing, however these are fluffy and light! Pretty straight forward & easy.

I made this recipe to specification and it resulted in extremely salty pancakes; a full teaspoon of salt per cup of flour is far too much.  Otherwise, they were simple to make, looked great, and had a good texture.   If I make them again (doubtful) I will be cutting the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon or less.

Look no further! I was a Bisquick pancake girl my whole life. I had buttermilk left over from another recipe and I thought about trying my hand at homemade pancakes this weekend. Wow! The only deviation I went with was I used half the salt and I ended up adding a 1/4 cup whole milk to the batter which was still thick, a bit lumpy and fluffy. I used about 1/3 cup for each pancake and gently moved the pan to even out the batter. Wonderful!

Way too much salt, family voted inedible. I compared after making them and based on other buttermilk recipes, there is double the salt in this one.

Thought I'd try these instead of my go-to Betty Crocker Favorite Pancake recipe. -- also a buttermilk recipe. I made just as directed. Mine were definitely not fluffy; I had to add more liquid. I too had questioned the amount of salt -- for me the "saltiness" shows up especially as an aftertaste that isn't pleasant. My go-to recipe is very similar, but for 1 c. of flour uses only 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 T of sugar and also baking powder.  Back to Betty next time.

I used half the salt, 1 tsp. of sugar and 10 blueberries a pancake.  The kids got the berries plus chocolate chips.  I had to mix the dry and wet more than recommended because it was thick to avoid flour clumps.  Fluffy & light and quite good.

It was very tasty..I used less baking soda and no salt yet it had some salty flavor. Next time I will use 1/4 t baking soda and 3/4 t of baking powder.  I only had 3/4 c buttermilk so iused whole to complete quanity needed. We enjoyed them. I did add blueberries to some delicious. Will make again with baking powder.

I didn't make any changes and left the batter lumpy like instructed.  There were "dry" places in my pancakes and they weren't "light and fluffy", just flat and lumpy.  Won't be making these again.

I have been making these a two or three times a month for the past four years.  This is the perfect recipe for two people.  It makes six (approx 6") pancakes.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and reduce the salt from one teaspoon to 1/4 teaspoon.  This is as good and as easy of a basic pancake recipe that you will find.

These aren't too bad if you put syrup  on them. I would definitely reduce the salt because when I ate them without syrup (which I usually enjoy), I was practically choking on salt. There is also this powdery texture, either from the baking soda or flour. I won't be making these again because I'm sure there is a better buttermilk pancake recipe out there.

Best homemade pancake recipe we've ever made.  We doubled the recipe, because of our big family, and used 1/2 buttermilk and half milk. Might want to decrease salt a little if sensitive to sodium. Very moist and no added sugar--there's enough in the syrup!  :)

Only made once so far, reduced salt to 1/4 teaspoon since I'm using salted butter and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. Turned out so tasty and fluffy! Great recipe, even with personal adjustments.

I love this base for pancakes. Who knew that they could be so easy? I always make my own buttermilk by adding vinegar or lemon to milk and then add anything else to the batter that I have on hand. Bananas, chocolate chips, oats, nuts, berries and so on. Great staple and have made this recipe multiple times!

My family LOVES pancakes. These are not IHOP or Bob Evan's pancakes these are the pancakes your grandma made when you were a kid...delicious!  I have since then made them for dinner as well (kids & grandkids will eat pancakes anytime). I have to double the recipe because everyone wants seconds. Thanks for sharing this tasty treat. I followed the recipe except I sifted the flour & beat the egg first.

This recipe was disapointingly way too salty. Considering that this recipe received over 700 reviews and an average of 4.5 stars, I'd figured that I'd try it out hoping for great pancakes. I don't know why this recipe has such high ratings to be honest. I tried to eat it after all the efforts of making it and craving for pancakes, but after a couple of bites I had to toss them. You can still eat something if it turned out too sweet but you can't eat something if it turned out too salty.

Devastatingly salty! I’d suggest ¼ tsp to ½ tsp of salt at the most!  I had to double the batch without the salt in order to save it.  I also added sugar to salvage the taste turning them into sweet and salty pancakes.

We made this with a buttermilk substitute, 3 tbsp vinegar and 1 2/3rds cups of milk. Let the buttermilk substitute set out at room temperature for awhile. We also added a tsp of vanilla extract. Awesome, simple and versatile recipe!

Very fluffy soft and tasty. Best I've had, but I think next time I'll use less salt it's a bit too much. Loved it!

The recipe as is was too salty for me. I ended up adding 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 2 tsp of sugar and left the recipe as is and with my adjustments the pancakes were perfect! My 2 year old ate them and ate them too she's a picky eater.  I will make again with my adjustments.  Delicious! It made about 8 pancakes I doubled the Drop size too the pancakes come out the size of silver dollars if not.

Made these this morning to celebrate a snow day off from school (I have a 10 year old). I always scan the reviews before I make something, and in this case, I saw the recommendation for less salt. I put 1/2 tsp instead of a whole teaspoon. I also used unsalted butter.  They were great! I did taste a little of the batter, and even with the 1/2 tsp, it tasted a smidge salty. But the finished product was yummy!  I served with some warm real maple syrup.

I also didn't have fresh buttermilk, so I used buttermilk powder. It's great stuff, buttermilk powder. You just add it to the dry ingredients, then use water in place of the buttermilk, and it works great for anything calling for buttermilk. 

The recipe made six large pancakes, so I'll have some to freeze. My son wouldn't taste them, since he's really not a breakfast person. More for me!

So close to perfect, great recipe! For my own tastes, I found them just a touch too salty, maybe half the salt, and I would have added maybe a T or two of sugar, I need to experiment... but for people who want the syrup to be the only sweetness, don't change it.  These pancakes were the fluffiest ever, seriously beautiful.

I also regret not listening to the reviews. The pancake was indeed light and fluffy but the salt content was way overboard. I will reuse this recipe however and adjust the salt .

Made today and followed recipe exactly.  They do make thick pancakes.  They reminded me of the "Favorite Pancakes" from my 1970s era Betty Crocker cookbook--except Mom's pancakes tasted a little salty.  I thought perhaps the saltiness was because I maybe didn't mix the dry ingredients enough.  I looked at the Betty Crocker recipe and it's almost identical to Mom's--except Betty's uses only 1 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. each of soda and salt, and adds 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 Tbsp. sugar.  I think Mom's recipe calls for too much salt.  I'll stick with Betty.

They are on the salty side, but I like that. It balances with the sweetness of syrup or jam.

I was making this this morning for my brother, husband, father and sister from out of state. She is hear taking care of my father who had surgery. I recently began churning my own butter and had the buttermilk left. So I want to make these pancakes the recipe seem easy to make. The batter was thin. The pancakes were flat didn't rise. Please check the ingredients, it calls for 1 cup flour and 1 1/8 cup milk that is going to make a flat pancake. So, I was embarrassed to tell them that there wouldn't be any.

I love this, its so simple yet so delicious. I even added some cocoa powder and sugar to make it my own, absolutely delicious. In the base recipe i added a little bit of cinnamon to make it taste a little sweeter and i found if you want to do that you have to add allot. Buttermilk pancakes are the only way to go.

We didn't have buttermilk but added in a couple of tsp of vinegar to sour the milk. They turned out beautifully, just as described: light, fluffy and delicious  with butter and pure maple syrup.  Also tried them with a warm compote of bananas sauteed in butter and brown sugar with a little nutmeg and vanilla. Wonderful.

I made exactly as written. They were mediocre tasting. Not the best pancakes I've ever made or had. Not bad. Just average. I could taste the salt. I would recommend using half the amount.

I found this recipe and made the pancakes within about 15 minutes and according to my boyfriend, these are "really freaking good". I added a dash of vanilla extract but made no other changes or substitutions. These would be great with a berry compote on top!

Good texture way to salty for my family. I think it needs a little vanilla and sugar.

I've been making pancakes for 25 years and this tops them all with no comparison. They are awesome even without butter or syrup of any kind. I reduce the salt by half.

Deelish! All around the table loved them. I doubled the recipe  and used only  1/2 tsp salt due to a reviewer's suggestion. Pinned, and I will make again. A double batch yielded 15 good sized pancakes.

These turned out to be some of the best pancakes I've made! Much better than pancake mix. My one thing is that there is waaay too much salt. You probably only need a quarter teaspoon.

These were kind of dense and heavy and lacked flavor, even after I added vanilla (after tasting the first one and finding it bland). Neither my husband nor daughter cared for these, and they are both pancake people. I thought they were okay, hence the three stars. Won't make again, sorry.

Great recipe. The only changes I have made is the addition of either vanilla, caramel or almond extract. It ads just a little extra flavor. Again, perfect recipe!!!
My wife is not a big pancake fan but she loves these whenever I make them.

I was hoping that other reviewers were right in that the amount of salt was fine, but no.  If you want to eat this plain without syrup, it IS way too salty.  Even with syrup, I was unimpressed.  I could smell the baking soda smell, and it just didn't taste great to me.  Will not make again

Box pancakes will never happen in this house again! I changed nothing and these amazing pancakes have been perfect and fluffy every time I have made them. I invited family over for Christmas breakfast, which was a chorus of, "Omg, these PANCAKES!"

My family inhaled these.  I doubled the recipe, only a dash of salt, oil instead of butter (and 3/4 of what the recipe called for), added 1 tbsp sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla.  SO much better than regular milk pancakes.   Next batch I'll add Oatmeal to the mix too.

Made these as written except for adding vanilla extract.  These were really yummy, but agree with a previous reviewer that they are salty as written.  Served with syrup it's not as noticeable, but next time I will definitely reduce the salt. Still a keeper!

Best buttermilk pancakes ever! No sugar, I don't like sweet pancakes or waffles, in fact, I don't even put syrup on mine! I know, weird, right?  These are light and fluffy on the inside and crispy on the edges. Easy to make, almost a easy as a mix. Will cut the salt a tad next time.

I'm not sure how recipe's get 4-1/2 stars. when it only shows 4 or 5 on the star pick???. Anyway I made the Pancakes with just a minor change or two. 1/2 teaspoon of salt and they looked a little thick so I gave them a splash of extra buttermilk. They came out great. I will make them again. Maybe add a splash, teaspoon of vanilla of a little cinnamon for a change to see how they might be enhanced. Thx. Good recipe.

I didn't change a thing, and these are fantastic! Light and fluffy, not at all crumbly or dense. They absorb just the  right amount of syrup. Every bit as easy as using a mix! This recipe makes enough for two if pancakes are all you are serving. If you have eggs and bacon then this recipe should feed four. This will be my go to recipe for pancakes from now on.

Light and fluffy, so much better than the Bisquick pancakes we normally make. A single batch makes about 6 pancakes if you use the 1/3 cup of batter. We doubled the recipe as written except for the salt - we kept that at 1 tsp. They were excellent and will be made again.

I made this this morning with the following changes.  I doubled the recipe but decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp per cup of flour. I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat pastry flour. one of my daughters likes blueberry pancakes so I set aside some of the batter and mixed in fresh blueberries. I let the batter rest for about 10 minutes and they turned out perfect.

OMG!!! So good. Added some vanilla but otherwise followed recipe. I have a great nonstick pan I use for Norwegian cardamom and vanillasukker crepe pancakes and found the pancakes were better when no grease was used on the pan. I was concerned about the thickness of the batter but forged ahead and spread the batter on the hot skillet with the bottom of my ladle as advised in the instructions.  They came out thick but beautifully fluffy and delicious!! I served them with a homemade blueberry syrup and they were  over the top! No more boxed mixes or bottled syrups for us. Words here cannot give enough justice - you simply MUST try. And sooooooo easy. Thank you for sharing.

These turned out great! They were super fluffy-- everyone loved them. I quadrupled the recipe, but I only used one teaspoon of salt. Any more would've been too much. The quadrupled recipe fed 10 people comfortably. I also added flour coated blueberries and some vanilla.

These were almost the perfect pancakes. They were beautiful and fluffy but as soon as I took a bite I was really bummed, they were too salty when using salted butter. Next time I will use 1/4 tsp salt if I only have salted butter again. Otherwise they were amazingly fluffy and delicious!

I used only 1/4 tsp salt per cup of flour as suggested by the other reviewer. Tripled the recipe.Really happy that it is sugarfree. Family members put their preferred amounts of syrup on their pancakes.

Fantastic! I made these as written but with whole wheat flour and fresh blueberries from our own bushes. Even with whole wheat flour, they still came out light, fluffy, and airy. The blueberries added a little sweetness and a nice tart zing. My only suggestion would be to use unsalted butter or cut the salt just a little.

O.M.G. This recipe is so so good! I made it mostly because I had some leftover buttermilk to use up, and I needed to make something quick for a last minute dinner. I can not believe how much I love these! My batter was a little thin, but I didn't have quite enough buttermilk, so I just topped it off with regular milk, so that may be why. Still, pancakes had a  light and fluffy texture and were absolutely delicious. Oh, and I didn't add any salt. I used salted butter, so I never add extra salt when I do that.

These are honestly the best pancakes i have ever ate.  I cannot believe the negative reviews on here.  I have made these for the past year and I do cut the salt in half sometimes.... just depends on my mood. The salty flavor with sweet syrup is so good.... but if you don't like the added salt just cut it in half.  This recipe is perfection!!

All I did differently was reduce the salt by half, add 1/2 tsp of sugar, 1/4 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of baking powder. 3 large pancakes (cut in half) fed me and my wife. We loved the flavor.

I am a total pancake snob and I LOVE these pancakes. If I make them per the recipe they are thick and fluffy.  As a personal preference, I like mine thinner so I add more buttermilk.  My roommates all love these and I make them on weekends for us.  The recipe is simple and quick, I will never use premade mixes again.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great.  They were light and fluffy - way better than anything out of a box.  Restaurant quality pancakes.  The recipe is so simple, just remember to get buttermilk and you are all set.

My sister spent the night and we wanted something special for breakfast.  I was scrolling thru recipes and saw buttermilk and remembered I had quite a bit left in frig to use, so this was it.   I made the recipe as written then tossed in some sliced frozen strawberries just before cooking. I panicked just as serving them because I didn't remember adding sugar  or vanilla.  But they didn't need it, Excellent!  Will definitely be making these again.   Very easy to make and cook.  Will try adding other fruits but the batter is perfect as is.

Not as airy as I expected, but they are fine. Like all pancakes, these cry out for a fried egg and tasty syrup or whatever. I used less salt, maybe half as much for a batch. Made 8 pancakes.

These were very good but the salt should be cut in half.  I used half white flour and half wheat flour. The first one in the pan stayed too stiff and mounded.  The rest I flattened a bit with the back of a spoon.  They were light and delicious.  I served them with real maple syrup and sliced strawberries and peaches.

What a treat.. Quick and easy to make on a weekend morning.  I added a teaspoon of baking powder for extra fluffiness along with vanilla and cinnamon to taste.  My new favorite pancake recipe

I made this as directed, they were melt in the mouth delicious.  I did as one person suggested and cut the salt to a half teaspoon.  I would also recommend using unsalted butter if you are worried about sodium

Possibly the best from scratch pancake recipe I've ever made and eaten.  Needed no tweaking in my opinion.  Easy and quick to put together too.

Pretty awesome recipe. I add some vanilla and brown sugar to it. My son begs me to make these EVERY morning. And if they aren't made for breakfast, he's begging for them at lunch and dinner.

Awesome pancakes, the saltiness is good.  Serves 2-3 people realistically though.
I substitute the buttermilk by adding 1T lemon juice per cup of milk, its cheaper and tastes the same in the end.

Way too salty. I think the problem is I made the mistake of using salted butter. I wish recipe authors would specify salted or unsalted butter for inexperienced cooks like me.

Just made these and they were very tasty!  I agree with a number of other reviewers in that I think the salt was a little high.  I would drop it by half and use only 1/2 tsp (or 1/4 tsp if using salted butter).   They were very light and fluffy but the texture was almost a little spongy which was surprising.  On the whole, they were far superior to any pre-made or box pancake mix, would definitely make again after adjusting the salt down a bit.

These are to die for! And very easy to make. I have found that a little more buttermilk is needed -about 1 and 1/4 cups total. Rule no.1 -You must use buttermilk. Any kind will do. Rule no.2- do not over mix. Just enough to get dry ingredients wet. And let the batter rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve with real maple syrup. We can't get enough of these. Just scrumptious!

The recipe calls for a teaspoon of salt and baking soda---the finished product was way too salty tasting.  If I made these again I would cut the salt at least in half.

I was going to make pancakes for breakfast for my kids, when I realized that we were out of Bisquick.  So I went online for an alternative, and I found this recipe. I search and  found that I had all of the ingredients  except for buttermilk, so I made the recipe with regular milk instead. I found the recipe just ok, there was too much salt and they tasted kind of eggy.  I would only recomend this recipe if you have nothing else.

I added a tablespoon of Malagasy vanilla (from Madagascar, I live here) and 1/2 cup more flour.  It turned out delicious!    Love these!   Was looking for a recipe without sugar and this hit the spot.

I was surprised there was no sugar in the recioe so I started reading the reviews.  I'm not a great cook so I followed the directions exactly, though I was worried about them being too salty.  They weren't!  They were delicious and a great way to transport syrup to my belly!  If you are looking for a sweeter pancake, look elsewhere.  I will use 1/2 tsp salt next time.

Way, way too salty, otherwise it was perfect.  My butter may have been salted as well.  Others might want to double if feeding a family.  All I had on hand was white whole wheat flour and they were still fluffy.

I read the reviews and I have to say when I did this recipe my pancakes came out perfecto! It was my first time making pancakes from scratch. I didn't change the original recipe at all! But what I did, I made the batter up at 2am and put it in the frig until not long ago (at about 11:45am). I split up the batter and made some plain and some banana walnut pancakes. I added 1/2 banana mashed, about 9 whole walnut pieces chopped up fine, and a 1/2 teaspoon of Ceylon cinnamon. It was really good! I used all the batter and made everything now so tomorrow I can just heat and eat. I made great BIG plate size pancakes just like IHOP. I'm sitting here stuffed now and don't want to move! But I know the dishes have to be done unfortunately. I wish my fairy godmother would do them for me.

I am BEYOND thrilled to have found this recipe! The one restaurant near us that made THE BEST pancakes ever, closed without my ever learning their secret! I have made endless varieties of pancake recipes and could never come close to that taste or consistency! THIS recipe did it! I only made one modification and that is to add about a half teaspoon of vanilla!! Pair these with REAL maple syrup and I DID it! A perfect copycat version!!! Thank you! Thank your mother!!!!

The buttermilk makes the pancake!  I tried it with regular milk, and it wasn't nearly as good.   Love it though! Bisquick is over rated! Homemade is just as easy with this recipe.  Light, fluffy perfection!

I tried this recipe and I made it with the above directions but added vanilla extract and six tablespoons of butter when I was about to make the pancakes I noticed it was only enough to make like three pancakes. So, I added more flour and baking soda and they were amazing and made almost ten pancakes.

First batch I made as written and didn't bother my children one bit but I as an adult had to step back and realize I did not like the flavor, hence a 4 star rating.  With that being said, I went for this modified version and was extremely pleased, but be warned it most likely will still be too salty for some.  My version I would rate 5 stars.  1/2 tsp salt, 3/4 tsp Baking soda, 1/2 tsp sugar, and definitely salted butter. Spoon flour into your 1 cup measure.. NEVER PACK IT IN!! I hope this helps some folks and doesn't get lost among all the reviews.

They burn entirely too easily and I followed the recipe to a dime. Even through i tried spraying my pan and even oiling it, the stuck very bad and burnt very easily. They also needed sugar.

Good, but way too salty! These were light and fluffy, but I am going to try halving the salt in this recipe next time, as everyone that ate these thought the salt was overpowering.

Great recipe but I think I'll use less salt next time. I added the vanilla as the other reviewer suggested and it turned out great. Using butter and buttermilk are key ingredients, delicious!

No one in my family liked these pancakes, even after drowning them in syrup.  We did not like the flavor, which I suspect is due to the relatively high amount of salt and the lack of sugar to balance out the buttermilk.  
Initially, the only change I made was to reduce the salt by half because the salt content seemed high and I was using salted butter.  After tasting the first few pancakes, I added sugar and vanilla to the batter, which improved the taste some but still wasn't something that I would make again.  
On a positive note, the texture was fluffy.

I made this recipe as written but tripled the recipe due to the fact that I have a big eatin family! Due to the reviews, I did NOT triple the salt but used the original amount and I have to say, that was MORE than enough salt! I consider myself an expert when it comes to cooking but I have to say these pancakes did not taste very good at all. I split the batter in 3 separate bowls (one plain), one added fresh blueberries, and one with sliced bananas and the blueberry and banana mixture tasted much better but not perfect. I also added a bit of pure vanilla and a bit of sugar in the blueberry mixture and those tasted even better but the texture was just not there. I'm not sure if it's something I am doing wrong or my old vintage "griddle in the middle" 1955. I make French toast, pancakes, and anything else that is made on a griddle and it all comes out fine. The center of my pancakes were doughy and heavy with a strange taste. I tried to adjust the heat several different times but they just didn't come out perfect. Some were cooking too fast on the outside or taking forever to cook when heat was lowered. Can someone out there please tell me what I was doing wrong? I just cannot figure out what went wrong with these pancakes!!  My non picky eaters (but know excellent food) were not impressed with these pancakes at all. I hate giving low ratings but these just weren't good. Maybe I just need some advice as to what I am doing wrong. Not making these again.

I like the texture of the pancakes. They cooked up nicely. They were indeed fluffy. But... I found them to be very salty. I will try these again, but next time use half the amount of salt. The tsp of salt combined with the tsp of baking soda was too much.

With the exception of way TOO much salt, the pancakes are good and very fluffy. Cutting down on the salt is a must unless one likes salty pancakes!

These were terrible pancakes!  I could not find my usual buttermilk pancake recipe so tried a new one.  The first batch all stuck to my normal pancake electric skillet.  Then the others were so salty and lumpy that we couldn't eat them.  So disappointing!  I wish I would have read all the reviews seeing how salty they were.

I doubled the recipe, but reduced the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp as the thought of putting 2 whole teaspoons was a bit mind boggling.

The Good: These panackes cook up fluffy and have good texture. The initial flavor was good.

The Bad: The aftertaste of baking soda in my mouth after every bite. Ick! Maybe that is why there is so much salt... to cover the bad aftertaste.

I will tinker with the salt and baking soda ratios and hopefully come up with a winner.

Made as written (almost).  I cut salt to 1/4 tsp, added 1 T sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla - just personal preference.  Added fresh blueberries before flipping.  They were really great.  No more box mixes for us!

Usually I can depend on Allrecipes reviews. These pancakes were WAY too salty. I should have known better from simply reading the recipe. At first I thought I read it wrong, but no. Terrible taste. My son wouldn't even eat them and I don't blame him! Cut the salt down by half at least!

Its TOO SALTY!!!  I cook on a regular basis.  While preparing the batter I thought 1 teaspoon was a lot of salt.  Unfortunately I didn't listen to myself.  I wasn't sure since it was the first time I was making it.  -I made waffles last week and it only called for an 1/8th of a teaspoon!  Even the crepes I make on a regular basis only call for a pinch of salt!   Unfortunately, I was just trying to use up my buttermilk and I didn't go through and read the reviews first.  I wish I had.  I agree with the one reviewer that said the pancakes tasted like brine.  I would definately cut back on the salt!! Or omit it all together. Severely disappointed.

These pancakes were so salty we could not eat them, and I'm an excessive salter.  I wish I would have read the reviews first because another person said the same thing.  That person was right, 1/4 tsp of salt per cup of flour is enough. I will make this same recipe again with much less salt.

The only changes I will make next time is to decrease the salt to maybe half a teaspoon or less and increase the buttermilk to one and a half cups. I like a bit less salt and I like my pancakes a little more "pourable" when cooking them in my cast-iron skillet. Otherwise delicious!

This recipe was WAY WAY WAY to salty! I should have read the other lower rated reviews, and saw that alot of people had the same problem!They were nice looking pancakes very fluffy and light,but so salty. Out of my family of 6 none of us were able to eat them.

Hey! Overall good recipe I think. I'm having some right now with oj and maple syrup. Now the only change I did was the 1 teaspoon of salt I changed it to about 1/4 teaspoon because I read on the reviews that it may be too much. Thanks good recipe!

Made this morning for my 3rd old birthday boy (and his brothers). They were delicious, but it was rather difficult to tell exactly how the pancakes stacked up by themselves. I used a cinnamon roll recipe and swirled the pancakes. I FOLLOWED OTHERS ADVICE AND CUT THE SALT DOWN TO 1/4tsp. I ALSO ADDED 1 TBS of sugar. (per single recipe). I did double the batch and ONLY USED 2 C OF MILK (milk/ vinegar for buttermilk substitute). They seemed to be a good consistency at that point. They were very fluffy yet very filling!

Super easy, great fluffy texture- just way too much salt as it is posted now (1 tsp).  Next time I'll reduce it by half.  I also accidentally used baking powder in place of backing soda- but that had no real effect on the final outcome though.

I made these tonight and I made some changes which is why it didn't give it a 5. I did not add any salt. I only used 1/2 tsp of baking soda and I added like 2 pinches of sugar. My family does not use salt and after reading the reviews I made those changes and they came out perfect! The family loved them and I used warm butter maple syrup. This was a great starter recipe since this was my first time making homemade pancakes. I will use my changes for my family though!

I made this recipie exactly as written and made the first pancake. My family wasn't bowled over, so I added two tablespoons of granulated sugar and that was the ticket. I guess my crew just needs a little sweetness to it. Delicious and very easy.

Way too salty.  It tasted like playdough.  When I make these again will cut salt in half, add 3tbs of sugar and less buttermilk.  I'm willing to give this one another try since its so easy.  Liked bisquick much better so we'll see.

I liked these pancakes, but they were not the best I have ever had.  We put lots of blueberries in the batter, but it still seemed like something was missing.  Maybe I will put about 2T sugar in the batter next time.  They were very quick and easy to make and I will make them again.

Way too salty, with a nutritional value of 41% sodium. I couldn't eat them. The batter was slightly runny. You may want to hold back on the extra 1/8 cup of buttermilk, so you can control the consistency of the batter.

I really like this recipe, the pancakes are fluffy just as promised.  If you don't have buttermilk add a teaspoon of lemon juice to your milk; stir and let sit for 5 minutes before using.  The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I like to use whole wheat flour and they just don't turn out very well when using whole wheat.
Thank you!

Perfect pancake recipe! I did however add almond extract and some sugar but that is my own preference. These were delicious.

I'll give it two stars for a great starting point but take 3 off for the salt content. It was through the roof for my family...but we don't add salt to most of our meals so I think we may be more sensitive to its flavor. I would like to make these again but with way less salt and maybe just a pinch of cinnamon sugar. I made this for my toddler and could not give them to her...the sodium worried me. They were light and fluffy as promised but all we could taste was salt.

Followed directions exactly. Very easy to make. They were a nice texture and fluffy, but had too much salt. I would cut the salt in half if I were to use this recipe again, but probably will experiment with some other recipes instead.

The pancakes came out alright, but I felt it was a little too salty.  Would make this again with less salt.

The reviewer who noted that there is way too much salt is correct--wish I would have heeded the warning and cut the salt significantly.  The texture turned out well but waaaayyyy too much salt.  I would try 1/4 tsp. next time.

I cut the salt in half like others suggested, and the taste was okay, but next time I'll probably add a bit of sugar, especially since the batter was so thin (runny). Btw, it made 10 pancakes.

Generally, this recipe is wonderful, however I have to give it only two stars because of the amount of salt. I read another review that mentioned how salty the pancakes ended up tasting, but so many others wrote that they wouldn't change a thing. I wanted to taste the recipe first as is before deciding to make adjustments. I regret not heeding the warnings of the other reviewer! I usually pile salt on everything I eat, yet these pancakes are way too salty, even for me.
With a reduced (maybe halved?) quantity of salt, these would be magnificent! The texture is wonderful and fluffy.

This recipe was very yummy and I loved the texture. Reminds me of the pancakes you get in a restaurant. I did double the recipe as someone suggested since there are five in our family. The only thing I would do differently is to use less salt next time. I doubled the salt and they were a touch salty.

Followed recipe except did not have buttermilk, so used regular.  I liked these better than Bisquick.  Hubby liked also but thought they could have used a little sugar.  Very good.

This recipe has way too much baking soda.  When you take a bite, the flavor is good, but the aftertaste is nothing but the soda flavor.  While the batter itself was VERY salty, I did not taste too much salt in the cooked pancakes.  My daughter LOVES pancakes, but would not eat these after the first bite.  I will try this recipe again, cutting the salt and soda in half, and perhaps adding a little vanilla.

I guess this is proof that just because a recipe gets good reviews, that doesn't mean it will be good for me! After reading the reviews, I figured that a couple of minor changes they suggested would be ok. We had no buttermilk, so I did the 1 cup milk to 1 T vinegar, which seemed to work well. I also added a little bit of sugar. For some reason my batter was very thin and the more I stirred, the thinner it seemed to get. Also the places where there were still lumps were VERY salty! Enough syrup can disguise that probably, but I tend to go light on it. Not sure what exactly went so wrong, but these didn't work well for us :(
