First sauerbraten I ve made in years. In my opinion the vinegar marinade needed to be diluted a little bit maybe adding a cup of water. I also added juniper berries as this is what I ve used in the past. I will probably try a different recipe next time but overall Imwas please.

It takes planning and time but the effort was worth it. I finished it in the dutch oven in the oven at 350 for 3 hours.
