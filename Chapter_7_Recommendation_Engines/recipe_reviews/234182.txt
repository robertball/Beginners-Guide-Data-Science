Very satisfying.  I made this for two in a cast iron pan since I did not have a wok.  As previous reviewer suggested, I partially cooked the harder vegetables (carrots, onions, celery, pepper) very quickly over high heat and removed them from the pan.  I turned down the heat and cooked the chicken until almost cooked but not browned, turning once.  Then added the vegetables back into the pan, added finely shredded cabbage and stirred until it was turning  green, then added liquids as per recipe,, brought it to a simmer then added snow peas.  Cashews were added last just before serving.   Texture was perfect with softer chicken, slightly crunchy veg, and crunchy cashews.  Yum. Served over jasmine rice.

I really love this recipe.  Anyone who says this is a bland recipe doesn't have a taste bud in their head.  This is a BASE recipe, add your spices to suit.  Most important thing is to have a big wok (14 inches) I use a 14 inch wok for just my husband and myself.  Years ago I took a cooking class on a Junk in Hong Kong harbor and was taught that the secret to a successful stir fry was to use the biggest wok you can find, then a high temperature so you can stir with abandon.   Have every ingredient lined up in proper order for how fast it cooks and spice to taste!  Rarely does a main dish ever take over 7 minutes to cook, start to finish.   If you're doing multiple dishes, do the ones that "keep" first.    Always remember:  a 10 inch wok is only good as a planter!

Very good, but I did make some changes. Coated the chicken in flour, five spice blend, and salt and pepper. Didn't  use snap peas. Used bagged Cole slaw instead of cabbage.added water chestnuts along with the bamboo shoots. I think it is a very good, forgiving recipe. Pretty simple to make, will make again

Great meal, especially when feeding a big family! I substituted mushrooms for bell peppers and used low sodium chicken stock and unsalted cashews. It was still plenty salty.  I also put it over long grain wild rice. Everybody loved it, had second and third helpings! (Even got my father in-law to like it, which is a miracle!)

Delicious. 1/2!recipe makes enough for 3-4.  Used steamable snap peas and asparagus and they worked fine. Added water chesnuts.

Made as directed with what I had on hand, adding mushrooms because we like them. I had New Orleans Style spice which I used for the seasoning. Also I put 3 TB flour as I did not have corn starch. I can't say we really tasted the spice that much so I may experiment with that.

This was a delightful recipe and easy to tweek with your own tastes (esp. on the chicken) - I say that bc I did not have cajun seasoning so used 5-spice and it turned out delicious.
The rest I followed quite precisely !
Tasted so healthy !
thanks !

I have been making something very similar, the soy sauce added a nice touch. I added about 3 Tablespoons instead of teaspoons.

I'll definitely make this again. The only change I did was, I used chicken  tenderloin, just because that's what I had on hand. I like that you can use just about any veggie you want. I made coconut rice to go with it.

This is OK and is fine for most people. I grew up in Springfield, MO and I have the original David Leong recipe for Springfield chicken, AKA cashew chicken, and this is not it. Call it chicken with cashews but this is not cashew chicken. His original idea to get customers from the south was to get people who liked fried chicken to eat Chinese food and he did it.

This was delicious. Gathering ingredients was a bear, though. 

I used frozen sugar snap peas, and they were fine. I doubled the amount of red bell pepper, because what could I do with an extra half pepper? Using the whole pepper seemed like the correct amount, honestly. I also used chicken thighs instead of breast. The thighs came out more tender than breasts do in stir frys.

If you make this, buy a couple cans of bamboo shoots and a couple of red peppers, because you'll basically have enough green onions and cabbage leftover to make this recipe a few more times.

I really like this recipe. It’s quick and easy which is so nice after a long day. I added more vegetables (red peppers, Brussels sprouts) and tossed in some shallots with the chicken when it was browning. I like my veggies a bit more done so cooked a little bit longer than what’s called for here. I’d like to sweeten it just a bit so next time might add some ginger or less soy.

This dish was beautiful and delicious. However, I found it to be too saucy. The next time I make it I’ll cut the sauce in half. I served this with oven steamed rice and a simple fruit dish of watermelon and pineapple.

A couple of changes...didn't have any asparagus or bamboo shoots but added a few mushrooms and half a bag of julienned carrots.  I really liked this recipe but we all felt it lacked flavour and needed a little zip.  We stirred in some chili garlic sauce and this did the trick.  I would make this again but I think I'd add some sautéed onions and a bit of garlic next time.

A good basic recipe, but bland the way it is.  I stuck to most of the recipe, except I added some minced garlic and used sesame oil.  After cooking, it was pretty blah, so we added spicy Sechuan seasoning and some more soy sauce to help spice it up and it was pretty good.  I think you could probably use a lot of other vegetables on hand with this recipe.

Great dish.  I toasted my raw cashews in a skillet, and added garlic and fresh ginger to the stir fry.  Family really enjoyed this.  Because of my vegan daughter, I used veggie broth and then added some beyond meat chicken to her dish and real chicken to ours..  Turned out great.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. We added red pepper flakes for a little flavorful bite.

Was a very good alternative to our normal "Chinese" type stirfry. Easy prep and cooking. Used additional seasoning on the chicken but definitely will make again!

Only because of taste preference, I used frozen peas instead of snap, and water chestnuts instead of bamboo shoots. Yum!

This is a very good recipe and a keeper for me.  I grilled the chicken as I always do on my George Foreman grill.  I believe it imparts more flavor and helps to cut down on the cooking time.  The only thing I would do different is to hand chop the cabbage, because shredding it caused it to almost disappear.  It is full of vegetables and filled my desire to have more vegetables and less meat.  Also, I love stir frying as it is one pot cooking.   This is a great recipe.

I don't get the cajun spices. Easily convert this into an asian dish. Get rid of the cajun seasoning and use chinese 5 spice. Get rid of cabbage, asparagus, and celery. Thrown in some shiitake, fish sauce, and thai-basil. BOOM!

I loved it, chicken was very tender, the texture of the cashews making it crunchy was awesome. I added enough but not to much of paprika to spice it up.

We used different veggies, as it was what we had on hand.  The sauce was ok but both my boyfriend and I agreed that that was the best we could say about it.  Not bad but not very flavorful either.  We probably won't make this again.

This was great.  I didn't have everything, but I came as close as I could and my husband couldn't stop saying how delicious it was, and went back for seconds.  I didn't have cabbage, so I used zucchini, the celery tasted perfect, and I had to substitute broccoli, sliced baby carrots, and cauliflower for the other vegetables, and onion salt for the onion because I was out of onions, and I forgot the paprika (oops!) but it was still good!

This was delicious! I made several changes.  I changed the veggies. I used matchstick carrots, shredded cabbage, broccoli, onion, orange and red pepper, and water chestnuts. I cut the chicken into bitch size pieces. I fried the chicken in a tablespoon of vegetable oil with a tablespoon of Tony's sprinkled onto. I fried chicken until it was a little pink, then removed from heat. I then fried all of the veggies except cabbage together, until tender about 10 minutes. After they were tender,  I added the cabbage,  chicken broth mixture, and chicken. I cooked about 5-10 minutes until cabbage and chicken were cooked. This was served over Jasmine rice, and was delicious! I did use Low Sodium Soy Sauce to cut down on the saltiness others complained about

Very tasty! I will definitely make again. I served with fried rice. Better than any  Chinese at restaurants in Florida. For those of you who want to know how many servings. My guess is 4-6.

Made it according to the recipe. Served it over rice. Found it a little bland. Added salt & pepper at the table, as well as more soy sauce and a little bit of teriyaki sauce. Next time I'll use more Cajun seasoning and more soy sauce while cooking.

The Tony Chachere's on the chicken really sets off this dish.  I used bean sprouts instead of bamboo shoots,(store out of bamboo shoots),  also added green pepper.  Served over brown rice; but I think it would be great over pasta.  

Have added recipe to my favorite list.

Recipe is good but need to use unsalted cashews and reduced sodium chicken broth as it can be too salty.  I added mushrooms and skipped the peppers and cabbage.

This is a good basic recipe. I used all vegetables listed except: I omitted the celery, and bamboo shoots. Added chopped garlic, some sliced greens (because I had them on hand), increased the amount of green onion, added some shredded carrot for more color and something a little sweet. Served over brown rice vermicelli with extra Tamari (my spouse is gluten intolerant so no soy here) and cracked red pepper (Siracha would be good too).  I say experiment and make what you love. I appreciate that this is not breaded and  fried.

It was delicious and not terribly complicated to make.  If you don't mind chopping all the veggies.  In the end I could not get the snow peas and had to substitute the cabbage with broccoli, because my kids don't like it, and the result was a delicious meal that everyone enjoyed.   I suggest you increase the portions a little bit since everyone here went for seconds.

I have not made it yet. I put the recipe in my diabetes ap and it only showed 21.94 carbs. That is without rice. There is no way possible it has as many carbs as the recipe lists unless they are adding 1 cup of rice, which is not mentioned in the recipe. I will add garlic and some sesame oil and ginger when I make it tonight. I will omit the Cajun seasoning. I do not care for that taste.

Uncle Mitch...Your recipe from David Leong sounds great.  Would you share it?  I like the Cashew Chicken recipe on this site, but would like to make your recipe also and compare the two.  Thanks.

This obsession with "carbs" is as ridiculous as gluten obsession. Carbs are not to be avoided. Carbohydrates are a basic food group and part of a healthy diet. The recipe is pretty good. Something is missing though. Needs a little experimentation to perfect.
