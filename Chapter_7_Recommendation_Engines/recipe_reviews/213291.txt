Made this for the first time and thought it was awesome.  Cant believe it has gotten such bad ratings.  Better than any I've had at a Mexican place.

i did this a bit different and a bit more healthy!  i added some fresh kale and garlic in with my onions. and instead of using sour cream i used nonfat plain yogurt.  i also use mozzarella cheese. (it was what i had, and a little healthier)  very tasty!

My kids call these 'Gringo Enchiladas'.  They say that these are definitely not the kind their friend's mother's make.  But for something different and for a sauce out of a can, they work in a pinch.  They are a whole lot easier to make than the traditional enchiladas......

Good eating here!!! Light....heart and stomach/pouch healthy. Great for Gastric Bypass Folks!!! Please see the pics and web site. The sour cream in the Green Enchilada Sauce is a must. I only used a 1/2 can of the cream of chicken soup.  That sauce is the key to me. The next batch I will make more sauce to put on the individual serving. During the 25 minutes at 350 degrees the Tortilla's suc up the sauce. I think a side of additional sauce is a must! Those things were Great! Thanks for the idea and help.

Fairly easy, with drained canned chicken.  Used Colby Jack cheese.  Cheaper than monterey cheese.  Spiced it is with 1 tablespoon jalapeno

Very tasty. I added in some extra seasonings, 1/2 teaspoon of salt,  1/2 teaspoon of onion power, and a dash of garlic. I also added in some extra cheese. These turned out great. Had the perfect amount of kick to them. These chicken enchiladas match up with restaurant quality. They actually taste quite similar to the Mexican place here in town. I don't think much could be done to make them any better. Thanks for sharing with us.

Good recipe to start with. 
I made some changes though and really liked what I ended up with. 
I used a mix that replaces the condensed soup that is much lower in sodium than any condensed soup (1/8 & 2/3 Cup milk, 1 1/3 Tbsp Corn Starch, 1/2 Tbsp Instant Chicken Bouillon, 2/3 tsp dried minced Onion, scant 1/4 tsp Italian Seasoning: Combine with 1/4 cold water whisk until well blended, cook on stove top or in microwave until thickened, then use just as you would a can of soup). 
I also added a 1/8 cup of jarred salsa verde to the sauce to give it more flavor as well.
