This is also good if you roast your baby carrots. Just toss with a little melted butter or EVOO, bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes, then toss with grated parmesan. It's one of our favorite side dishes.

I loved this recipe, but did it baked/roasted.  I just cut baby carrots in half (or bigger carrots into little pieces) and put them in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of melted butter and 1/4 parmesan cheese.  After mixing it together, I put them in the toaster oven for 20 min and they were delicious!  Yum!

VERY good! While the title "implies" baby carrots are the star ingreident, I don't see the point, considering the recipe submitter's instructions are to chop them.... As Sara Jo did, I also roasted my carrots  - and prep couldn't have been easier! I only had one hiccup (completely my fault since I didn't follow becky's instructions). It took FAR longer than 25 minutes / 350 degrees for my carrots to cook thru. I'm not sure if Sara based her roasting timeframe on using whole or chopped carrots (which obviously makes a difference - I roasted whole baby carrots), so I'll just consider it a "loose" guideline. :) My carrots took nearly 45 minutes to cook, but it was WELL worth the wait! Roasting is just plain AWESOME - it brings out the natural sweetness that you lose with other cooking methods, IMHO. NOTE: I sprinkled my carrots with cheese AFTER they were out of the oven, but wish I would have tossed them with it (and the EVOO I coated them in) beforehand. What didn't adhere to my carrots ended up as clumps of partially melted cheese, but was delicious nonetheless. :) Served alongside chicken Parmesan, a PERFECT pairing! Thanks for sharing, becky! I now have a new way to enjoy one of my favorite vegetables! :-)

Easy, delicious, and different. My husband raved over these. This from a man who loves his carrots as is plain and no frills. He had seconds and he even asked if I could make this for Thanksgiving instead of "those candied yams". So 5 stars because he raved. I liked them too but for me they weren't my favorite dish ever. I added a spoonfull of brown sugar to the butter as it melted and a sprinkle of salt.

Who knew something with this few ingredients could be so yummy! I used salted butter and steamed these until tender but still stiff, then transferred them to a foil pouch and finished cooking them on the grill, adding the parmesan the last five minutes. Amazing, thanks for the recipe, it will be used often:)

I liked that this was so simple and easy with ingredients I have on hand.  Plus there was no added sugar which I liked because carrots are sweet enough themselves.  The parm cheese globbed up even though I waited a bit before mixing it in as the recipe states.  It didn't add much flavor though, but I liked the recipe overall.

Very good-quick and easy. The parmesan crust was a nice savory contrast to the sweet carrots.

These are delicious!  Instead of dirtying two pans to make them, I just drained the carrots after cooking them, put them back on the burner, and added the butter in and let it melt.  Then I stirred them for a little while.  Then I added the cheese and followed the directions there.  I also used baby carrots rather than cutting up carrots.  Definitely a keeper!!

the salty richness of parm cheese doesn't blend well with the natural sweetness of the carrots in my opinion. Won't try it again.-

Yum!  I have a hard time finding carrot recipes, bc I prefer savory, not sweet, and I'm a picky one when it comes to carrots . . .but this is good.  I really enjoyed them.  I think the only criticism I have--and it's more of an addition--is I would love garlic with these.  I, too, roasted, but did not chop my baby carrots (they were large, too--some of the baby carrots in the bag are smaller, so keep that in mind), so they took about 1 hour and 15 minutes at 350.  I'd up the temp to 375 or 400 next time, but otherwise it's good.  I put the Parmesan in with the butter and carrots, and although it got a bit crisp, a lot kind of melted into the carrots and I ended up with a buttery, Parmesan-y taste.  Very good, actually.  I think I'll stick with roasted so as not to dirty a lot of pans, but I think this recipe is a great starting point.  Thanks for the recipe!

I also roasted my carrots then sprinkled the cheese on while they were still hot. It was ok, nothing I'd make again.

This was easy and tasted pretty good. Didn't find it outstanding, but good. May try roasting sometime. Used regular, full sized carrots chopped instead of baby carrots because that's what I had at the time.

This was a very tasty recipe for cooked carrots.  The only thing I will change next time is to reduce the cooking time significantly once the parmesan cheese has been added.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, becky1618!

Hmmm hmmm! My husband and I served these along with the Healthier Stuffed Peppers recipe, on this website, for my mother's birthday. Everyone loved them! The only downfall is there wasn't enough carrots for everyone to get seconds! Will make more next time!

The parmesan cheese melted and then wadded itself into unmixable wads of melted parmesan that just stayed in clumps. Removed them and sprinkled parmesan and salt on them. Not bad.

I rarely make a recipe from this at we don’t like, but this is one of the few.   I regularly make the dill carrot recipe from this site and we love, love, love that so the bar for carrots is set high.  With that said, I won’t try this again.

The main problem I had was that all the parmesan just fell to the bottom of the pan, so I didn't get any to stick to the carrots.  I may try again roasting them and see if that works better.

Yum!!! What a great and simple recipe. We really enjoyed this. We liked it so much, we are actually going to make it again tomorrow night. It will be in our vegetable rotation from now on.

Not being a huge fan of cooked carrots, I was skeptical of this recipe.  I knew my DH would like it as he loves cooked carrots.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this recipe.  Maybe it was because the only sweetness from the dish came from the carrots themselves and not the added ingredients.  I chose to cut my organic carrots into coins rather than slices.  I made the recipes with the cooking instructions listed, but I’m sure this could be made by roasting the carrots also.  I served this with a salad and ‘Honey Mustard Chicken with Pretzel Crust’ from AR and we had a delicious meal.

I used baby carrots, added some sliced onion as the submitter suggested; then followed directions as written.  We love carrots, so this was a new way to try them and enjoyed by all with no leftovers. Thanks for posting, becky1618

I made it exactly how the recipe states and they were wonderful!  We are not big carrot eaters, but these were a huge hit at our house.  The cooler the carrots got, the more flavorful they were.  I would suggest letting them cool a bit before serving.  Not cold, but just not right out of the pan.

I will try roasting next time but none the less these turned out pretty yummy.  My whole family loved them and the 4 year old asked for 2nds.  Will make again for sure!
