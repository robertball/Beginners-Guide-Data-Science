The salmon was 2.5 lbs and the amount of liquid was just right. It took me 40 minutes to bake and make sure the center was cooked. I marinated it overnight, did not wrap in foil but covered the dish with foil. It came out so delicious, everyone loved it. I did not have fresh parsley,but the dried parsley worked just fine. Will bake again.

My dad loves salmon so i thought i would try this version in the foil pack since sometimes when i cook right in the oven it seems dry, this came out wonderful, very tender and flavorful.  I didnt have oregano so i left out, i did add parsely flakes on top before i cooked.

Awesome. I added red pepper flakes and about 1.5 tablespoons of honey. Then topped with capers, cuz I love capers and salmon together. Plus used Himalayan pink salt instead of regular and ground peppercorn medley for added flavor.  Super tasty. Made a giant 4 lbs slab and divided into 1 oz portions for lunches, baggied and froze. Reheats at work super easy.

I followed this recipe almost exactly just subbed honey for brown sugar. Came out moist and flavor full. I wish my oven had a broiler so I could brown the top and glaze it a bit before serving.

This had good flavor. Are used fresh time because I had it on hand. Also I opened up the foil and bake for another 10 minutes  because I wanted it to be a little drier than it was.

Forgot to set the timer, but I believe the marinade coupled with the foil made a HUGE difference! First time my salmon came out so moist!

Hubby and son enjoyed it. I cut down the cooking time since I had a few smaller fillets I was using. They both said the would like it again.

This was delicious. I was looking for a recipe with flavor and this delivered. Next time I might increase the brown sugar from 1 tablespoon to 1.5 just so that it's evenly spread across the whole filet.

I didn't wrap it in foil, instead baked it on 375 for about 20 minutes.  I'm not a salmon person, and had no idea what to expect but this was downright delicious.  I LOVED it.  So did my roommate!  Great recipe, easy to make with things you already have laying around.

Didn't have any lemon juice, used a little lemon zest.  Husband loved it.  Great, simple recipe.

Not at the top of the search results, but I'm glad I had the patience to continue looking.  This recipe is a gem, and as said, simple to make.  Everyone at home loved it.  The only thing I did different was to add some sliced onions on top of the fillet before sealing the foil.  But I'm sure it would have also turned great without it.
