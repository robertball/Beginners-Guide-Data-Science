AMAZING RECIPE! Since I didn't have any coconut flavoring, I used some extra shredded coconut. Absolutely delicious! I use this on many cakes - carrot, white, yellow, coconut cake, coconut pound cake - everybody loves it! If you are looking for an all around good frosting that can be used on many cakes, this is the one! It is FABULOUS! You must try it.

Forget the store-bought frostings!  This is so easy to make and soooo yummy!  I didn't have any coconut extract, but I did use coconut cream instead of heavy cream.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!

I was charged with making a birthday cake for my sister-in-law this year for her 23rd. I've always been desperate to win over my in-laws, and this DID IT! The frosting was phenomenal! My husband's many siblings loved it, so much so that when I turned around to let the dog out they dove into the bowl and ate all of the extra in 3 minutes. If you ever need to impress, this is the frosting to try.

Incredibily good!  I made this to go on my daughter's 12 year birthday cake and all of the girls at the party went nuts on the icing and even ate the leftovers!  I didn't add the coconut or the coconut flavouring (since I made the mistake of asking the girls' opinion on coconut) and upped the vanilla extract to 1-1/2 tsp. and it was still fantastic.  One thing, this makes enough frosting for two cakes and still have leftovers for cupcakes.  If making 1 cake, half the recipe...there will be plenty for a layer and the exterior.

When I started this recipe I thought I had coconut. I fallowed this recipe except for the flavoring and coconut I tested it with Blackwalnut and Almond extract both were good . I went with the Blackwalnut. I felt 6 instead of 60+ licked the bowl and beaters clean. My husbands favotite carrot cake was a huge success.  FYI, don't rush out for coconut flavoring.

I tried this recipe before anyone else reviewed it, and I'm glad I took the risk!  This frosting was absolutely delicious!  The coconut flavor was not overwhelming, but it was definitely there.  I used it to frost a guava-pineapple cake, and it didn't take away from the fruity flavors.  I also tasted the frosting at every step of the recipe.  Without the coconut or vanilla, it makes a great cream cheese base frosting, and with vanilla alone it's a very tasty vanilla frosting.  The consistency is also great (I ended up adding about double the amount of cream) and it is just like store-bought frosting...but better!  My family and neighbors loved it.  I will definitely be using this recipe, or at least part of it, again!  Thank you!

My husband and I really like this! I added about a teaspoon of rum in place of the coconut and vanilla extracts and added only enough milk (in place of the cream) to make it the desired consistency. I agree with others who feel it was not too sweet. Definitely a keeper and thank you so much!

Amazing! I've made this a few different times for cakes, cupcakes and a carrot cake. It's delicious and is always a huge hit! I've done several variations on it as well with and without the coconut and it's always good. When I include the coconut I usually double or triple the amount of flaked coconut.

I don't understand all the high reviews, unless all these people like sickeningly sweet, runny frosting.  I doubled the cream cheese and left out the cream.  Then I put it in the fridge to see if it would thicken more.   I think there should be more extract and less powdered sugar- it's overpowering.

This recipe is amazing.  The frosting adds just the right amount of sweetness to a carrot cake.  I did not add coconut flavoring, but the shredded and toasted coconut gave it enough of a kick.  This recipe made enough for me to frost a layer cake,  with about a cup left over.

This recipe is GREAT!  My husband wanted a cream cheese and coconut frosting for his birthday cake, which I had never made before, and this one received two big thumbs up!  I read through several of the reviews because I knew I would change a few things.  1.  I halved the recipe for my 18 cupcakes.  2. I used vanilla extract instead of coconut extract.  3. I also used whole milk, and slowly added it after the confectioner's sugar to get the consistency I wanted.  4. I used unsweetened coconut, and added 1 tablespoon of agave nectar.  It turned out great!  I'll be using this recipe again!

This is the most delicious frosting I've ever tasted! I've never made frosting before so I was surprised how easy it is! I used this frosting on a chocolate cake which brought two of my favorite flavors together. Next time I don't think I will add as much coconut flavor because it did taste a little too artificial to me at first. However the next day it tasted better to me so I think it needed time for everything to blend together. I added more toasted coconut to the outside of the cake which looked nice and gave a nice texture and really added to the flavor. I really love this frosting!

I left out the coconut; I just wanted the vanilla frosting.  It turned out great!  It also goes very well with fresh strawberries.

This frosting was really good. I used it on top of the Hawaiian Wedding Cake recipe from this site and it was a hit. I would definitely suggest adding the toasted coconut on top - it seems like a small touch but it really makes a difference in the level of coconut flavor that comes through.

LOVE!  I needed a simple cream cheese frosting for a red velvet cake but they are all so thick.  The heavy cream thins it out just enough to make it so smooth.  I just left out all the coconut ingredients and it made for the best plain cream cheese frosting!!!

After trying it once, I made a few modifications to suit my own tastes. I prefer a less sweet frosting so I added a half bar more of cream cheese and a little less sugar (I eyed it and just put enough to get the consistency I was looking for to pipe them onto my cupcakes. But overall a good recipe. Everyone who I have given it to liked it. I just like mine less sweet and with a little more tanginess (hence the small changes).

Awesome. The only thing I would change is when I added the 1/2 cup of coconut to the frosting it didn't seem like enough (but then again I really love coconut)so I put in 2 whole cups of it. I kept everything else the same, and it was enough to put a nice thick layer on a 9x13 chocolate cake & still had a few spoonfuls left so I could lick the bowl :)  I would use this frosting on any cake!

Delicious! I used whole milk instead of cream.  I just couldn't buy a container of creamer for only 2 tablespoons.  Consistency was excellent. I think the salt really brings out the flavors.

This recipe was pretty good. I halved it to use on top of lemon cupcakes, and it was just right, not too sweet. I found I had to add a bit more sugar to get it thick enough to pipe onto a cupcake... so I would say in a half batch I used about 2 1/2 cups. 

I also omitted the salt (as I think the bagged shredded coconut is salty enough) and substituted the heavy cream for just plain milk because it's what I had and I didn't want to buy a whole container of heavy cream just to use two tbs.

I put the frosting in the refrigerator for an hour after making it. That made it stiffer and the perfect consistency for my cupcakes and cakes.

This recipe is fantastic. Like many mentioned, I used a little less sugar. Instead of using heavy cream, I substituted the same amount of cream of coconut. I'll be completely honest - this frosting whipped up to a consistency that is very similar to that of store bought frosting. It's amazing. You could use some milk and another flavor - goodness - the millions of opportunities with this icing. This will now be my go-to recipe. It's fantastic.

My husband licked the bowl and commented any cake I make for him he wants this frosting on it. I did use the coconut flavor & it was perfect. I used it frost the coconut cake mix cake on this website-so did not add shred coconut. Great reviews from co-workers!

Easy to make and tasty. I doubled the batch to cover 36 cupcakes, because the serving size was for 20,  and I had way too much frosting left after generously frosting 36 cupcakes.

WOW- this tastes awesome- my kids, who don't like coconut loved it!  They couldn't believe it had coconut... but they kept right on eating it.  Complements any cake.  Thank you!

Coconut heaven!  Licked the beaters, then the spatula.  I was very glad I was home alone (didn't have to share).  Can't wait to taste it on the chocolate cake tonight.  That I WILL share!

I made this last night to go on a coconut cake that I made and the frosting is really wonderful. The next time I will add a little more powdered sugar to make it a tad thicker (like suggested). Great recipe Lilster.

My first try at this frosting so I followed it exactly as written.  I did find it a bit sweet so I ended up adding another 1/2 cup of cream cheese.  The flavor was good, but I was a little disappointed with the consistency.  I really wanted to give my cupcakes some nice swirls but it is just too runny for that.

I was craving coconut, so decided to use this recipe to top my vanilla cupcakes.  Loved it - don't skip the toasted coconut - it kicks these up a notch ( and smelled so good cooking).

The flavor is awesome, but even after upping the powdered sugar to 7 cups, it was still too thin...it just ran right off the sides of my 8" 2-layer cake (which had been refrigerated for 24 hours).  Hmmm...I love the flavor, so Im going to experiment with this recipe to see if I can get a thicker, spreadable consistency.  It would be great for a 13 x 9" cake left in the pan, though, as it would be contained in the pan.

This was great, but I halved the amount of powdered sugar.  I also didn't need any cream to have the correct consistency with the absence of the sugar.  I like being able to taste the cream cheese, and since I added all of the optional sweetened coconut, it was plenty sweet.  I used this inside of a lemon sponge cake to make a jelly roll, and it was delicious.

This is an excellent recipe...everyone loved this cake and frosting...The only thing I changed was to put the coconut only on top of the frosting untoasted.  I used milk instead of cream and no salt.  I also spread the frosting on the center of the cake and spread a thin layer of my homemade strawberry jam on top of the frosting.

I left the coconut extract out because I think the flavor of an imitation extract would have detracted from the natural flavors of the other ingredients.  Using a stand mixer with the butter at room temperature and the cream cheese still slightly cool made a thick, smooth, spreadable frosting. Frosted "Banana Cake II" from this site.  Both recipes are VERY easy.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever made. I hate to review when I've made changes but they were minimal and due to necessity since it's what I had on hand. I used about 1.5 T milk (not cream) and a tad more confectioner's sugar to get the right consistency. No coconut flavoring so 1.5 tsp. vanilla. No salt (had salted butter). I used it on a 9x13 cake and I thought the amount was perfect. I also toasted my coconut till brown and thought it really added to the taste. It was wonderful!

This recipe is excellent - as is.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I used it on a white cake and it was delicious.  It was so good that I ended up making two cakes in a three-day span.  I didn't think the coconut extract was overpowering at all - it was the perfect ratio. Definitely toast the coconut if you have time because it gives the frosting a nice flavor.  I can't wait to make this again.

I used this recipe and the suggestion of the apricot layer to frost a white layer sheet cake for my Son's 4th birthday.  It was a huge hit with both the kids and the adults.  It was easy and appealing to the kids, while still being something sophisticated and different from the normal kid's party fare for the adults.  The coconut frosting was the perfect backdrop to the bundt train cake I put on top to boot.  The only downside is that the apricot layer made the drive to the party location a rather tricky process.  Looking back, some advance planning including a completely cooled cake and some well placed toothpicks were in order!

Great recipe! I followed the directions, except used fat free half and half because I didn't have any cream.  I piped the frosting onto carrot cake cupcakes. Everyone LOVED them!

Linda said "I dont understand the high reviews, unless you like sickingly sweet, runny icing..". Then the very next sentence she said she doubled the cream cheese and left out the cream". Ummmm, please don't rate the recipe poorly if you CHANGED the recipe-pretty ridiculous on your part. This icing is great. Just adjust at the end with cream or powdered sugar to make it thinnrt or thicker.

I made this frosting to go with Sam's Famous Carrot Cake. I will absolutely use it with other recipes in the future because it is SO good. It was not overly sweet and the coconut was perfectly subtle. I ended up using about 3.5 cups confectioners sugar (because that was all I had), whole milk and used half the amount of coconut flavoring because I was afraid it might be too fake-coconut tasting. It turned out even better than I hoped. I was also hoping there would be enough left after icing my carrot cake to eat some at the end--there was. :) Great, great recipe, a definite keeper.

This is the best frosting I've ever had. My husband says he hates coconut but he liked this frosting because it wasn't too strong. I'm not sure what other reviewers did to make it runny. I am not a master chef. I can barely make box brownies. But my frosting was really thick like the stuff from the store.  I made sure my cream cheese was not too soft. And my butter wasn't melted. Maybe that was the trick. Whatever it was, I hope it turns out as wonderful next time!

I like others did not have any coconut flavoring.  I was mixing it up anyway for a yellow cake and when I tasted it, I thought it would be very good with chocolate.  I added 6 heaping teaspoons of baking cocoa and wow, it was amazing.  It tasted like chocolate cheesecake frosting...yum yum!

I'll never buy another container of frosting. EVERYONE who tastes it (on my lemon cake) raves about it and requests it, in advance, for all future  gatherings.  I usually substitute milk for cream and I use 1-1/2 cups of coconut instead of buying additional toasted coconut.  One batch is more than enough to frost a 9x13 double layer cake.  And I've never had a problem with the consistency or with it sticking to the sides the way it should.

Everyone at Easter dinner loved this frosting.  I used it with pineapple cake, making it a pina colada like cupcake.  DELICIOUS and great consistency.  Really good recipe - thanks!!!

SO SO GOOD!  This frosting is perfect exactly the way the recipe is written.  I did not change anything, and had no problem with the consistency; I'm wondering if the writers of the reviews indicating it was runny had allowed the butter and cream cheese to get too soft before creaming them together.  I used this on white cupcakes (from the Cake Doctor cookbook), and they were just amazing.  Thank you for sharing, this one's a keeper!

The great thing about this frosting recipe is you don't have to have every ingredient to make it as long as you have the basics. I made this without the coconut flavoring and the salt. Also I only used two cups of confectioners sugar since I don't happen to like a real sweet frosting. I made Sams Carrot Cake from this site (My favorite) and it is delish with this frosting!!!

Very easy to make and tastes good.  The consistency was nice and thick even with only 1 cup of powdered sugar.  But I had to add more to make it sweeter and ended up at about 2.5 cups (after adding the cream).  Whether you mix the coconut in or not, sprinkling some on top looks better.

Kidlet says this is the best frosting I have ever made.  It's very sweet, a little thin (but easy enough to adjust), and the coconut extract/flavoring does WONDERS for this recipe.  Don't change a thing.

Absolutely divine.  I had unsweetened coconut on hand an it was enough sweet for me (but I like things on the less sweet side).  I'm sure sweetened coconut is delicious too.  Used on some pineapple cupcakes.  It will be used on much more in the future.  Bravo!

I usually don't give 5 stars to recipes because there is almost always something that ends up needing to be adjusted based on previous reviews but this recipe is PERFECT.  The only change I mad was halve the recipe since one reviewer said that would be enough for a cake with filling and she was right!  I put it on the Heavenly White Cake and added some fresh raspberries to the filling and it was amazing!!

Used this recipe for my son's fiance's birthday dinner.  She loves coconut and so does my very ill father so it made a great choice but I did not expect them to love it SOOOOOOOOOooooo much.  It was a really bid hit and will go in with my favorites.  Really good and simple to make.  I had no coconut flavoring but it was great with just vanilla anyway!

Decadent! I used this to frost Hummingbirg Cake I from this site. It was a bundt cake, so I cut the icing recipe in half but probably used a total of 4 tbsp. half & half instead of the heavy cream to get more of a drizzling consistency. This frosting is DELICIOUS. Try it you will love it!

A tasty frosting that has just the right amount of sweetness.  Next time, I'd leave out the salt.  The optional toasted coconut on top makes an ordinary recipe look special.

i made this without all the coconut stuff as a cream cheese frosting for a red velvet cake. i did not like the consistency [i ended up using 4.5 cups of sugar but i stopped there because i felt i was losing too much of the cheese taste]; i would give that a 2. but the flavor is excellent, i would give that a 5. overall a good recipe.

This recipe is delicious and a great alternative to surprise your invitees. (I love coconut) When i prepared it I made some changes, adding two tbsp coconut milk.  But the coconut milk made it runny.  To fix it I added two tbsp. more o cream cheese.   I put it in the fridge for 30 minutes and it got the consistency desired. It was very yummy.

I used this on a white layer cake for a baby shower, dying the coconut with red food coloring beforehand (turning it pink in honor of the baby girl).  I took the advice to use apricot preserves between the layers and it was a BIG hit!  Thanks!

I don't make homemade frostings very often but this one was easy and delicious. I added chopped, toasted pecans to match my cake. (I used it on a Sweet Potato cake.) Very sweet, next time I'll use less powdered sugar. This recipe makes a lot, no need to double for 3 layer cakes.

I thought the frosting was very good. I did not have any coconut flavoring so I was surprised at how intense the coconut flavor was without it. I think shaved coconut would be better, texture wise as I used shredded (unsweetened, as it was all I had) and it seemed a bit chunky.  It was plenty sweet for us.

PERFECT cream cheese frosting measurements.  What more can I say?  It was super yummy.  I didn't add the coconut flakes this time around (only because I forgot) but added the exact measurements of all of the other ingredients, including the heavy cream.  This will definitely be my go to recipe for anything requiring cream cheese frosting.

Quick and super easy but also very sweet and I used unsweetened coconut and didn't use the vanilla. I didn't have coconut flavouring but the coconut still came through great.

This has a good taste but too sweet in my opinion.. chose to find a different recipe and went with that instead. May have been better if I had reduced the amount of confectioners sugar.

Not bad... too sweet but nice consistency.  I tasted it while I was making it and I could tell it was getting too sweet so I only added 3 cups of confectioners sugar and it was still quite sweet.  Also barely made enough to frost a three layer cake.  I probably would not make again.

I will definitely make this frosting  again. It's easy to make and has a great taste.  I didn't have heavy cream so I tried the coconut cream as suggested by others.  I did have to add extra powdered sugar to make it firmer, so next time I will reduce the coconut cream.

I made the cake exactly as  specified and it was wonderful - so moist and had great coconut flavor. I frosted it with coconut cream cheese frosting and covered it with shredded coconut. This cake is delicious. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Very easy and delicious. Only change was I did not have any coconut flavor so I added  extra vanilla. otherwise recipe was spot on. good consistency. iced a 9x13 cake with extra left over. added only half a bag of the coconut due to 2 of my boys going oh no Mom not coconut!!!  added the extra  to the top of the cake !!!!  They won't eat it anyways and my husband will love it!

Followed the recipe and it turned out GREAT! Frosted a "Davids Yellow Cake" also found on this site. 
Toasted 2 cups coconut and pushed this into the frosting once the cake was frosted. Looked great and tasted great.

I've made this before and saved it because I liked it. However, I never toasted the coconut before and the difference having the toasted coconut sprinkled on top of the frosting was phenomenal. I used 3 cups of confectioners sugar, and served on a simple white cake. Wonderful.

Great recipe.  However, I use only 1 2/3 cut powdered sugar and it's very sweet.  I cannot imagine using 4 cups.  No need for the cream.  I omit it each time.
I use this for carrot cake and add 3/4 cup shredded sweetened coconut.  It's great with 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and cayenne pepper (ground) also.
Would like to try it with a bit of lemon juice or extract.
As for the runny comments, I don't see how.  My guess is folks may be melting the butter or microwaving the stick which will release the oils.

Absolutely awesome. Very smooth and creamy without being too sweet. The only change I made I took from another reviewer of another cream cheese frosting. For those who are having trouble with the frosting being too thin, I beat the butter and powdered sugar added cream and flavor then added COLD cream cheese in small bits.   My frosting came together quickly without added powdered sugar, perfect consistently. I will always use cold cream cheese from now on. Thanks for the great recipe.

I also didn't add salt.

Yummy on a snowman-shaped coconut cake! I didn't add all of the coconut since it would have been overkill on the same flavor of cake.  I had trouble saving the frosting for decorating...I could have eaten the whole bowl! SCRUMPTIOUS!!!

So very delicious!  Followed the recipe almost exactly - added extra powdered sugar to get to a buttercream-like consistency for a round cake.  Used a white cake and sprinkled the middle and top with shredded coconut and chocolate flakes.  Huge hit!

This was good. It's very pretty and WHITE. It would be smooth and creamy without the shredded coconut. It's good but it just tastes like an extra-sweet cream cheese frosting with coconut in it. It was pretty yummy though.

Delicious! Used it on a Coconut Cake that I had my for my grandson's birthday.  The cake's frosting called for a cooked white frosting and I used this one instead.  It made the cake richer tasting, and everyone really enjoyed it.

I used this as an icing for carrot cake (which also had dessicated coconut). I didn't have heavy cream, so I just used half-and-half. I also used 3.75 cups confectioner's sugar (again, all I had in the house) and it still tasted super-sweet. My opinion is that you should either use this to frost a less-sweet cake or taste as you add the sugar-- you can probably add less if you don't have a super-sweet tooth! Anyway, I'll try to add less sugar next time since I tend to eat 1/2 of it straight out of the bowl. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe! I didn't have any heavy cream on hand so I used milk instead and it tasted wonderful!
