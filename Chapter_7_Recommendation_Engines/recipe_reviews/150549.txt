Recipe taste was excellent.  a bit confusing to follow the directions, but once made found it will be quite easy to do again.  Next time I would serve the salmon on top of rice (white or brown).  PS when working with POMs don't wear white, and suggest an apron.

I made this for my son's thirteenth birthday, and all of my children loved it. I thought it was a really tasty, different way to prepare salmon and will use it again on special occasions. Fresh, interesting and very nice to look at to boot. 
Well worth a try.

We tried this as directed and loved it.  It is an easy meal to prepare and yet looks and tastes more gourmet.  Thank you for sharing it.

As one who loves salmon and always looking for new ways to prepare it I was excited to give this a try as I also really like pomegranate.  I prepared it just as the recipe says except that I made the pomegranate mustard mixture and tasted it and thought that from the start the mustard would would take over, so I remade it using half the mustard.  I was disappointed in that all the other flavors completely overwhelmed the pomegranate to the extent that it became an un-necessary ingredient. Having said that it was by no means a bad recipe, just not for me.  There is a lot of pepper and with the mustard, it is a little spicy so therefore not something I'll likely try again.
