This recipe is not only delicious, but also uses my favorite fruit--pomegranate!  Accented by good, tart pears and spiced, the pomegranate seeds come to life!

This is the kind of recipe I love. Nothing artificial in it. All fresh. Delicious. No, it isn't necessarily quick to fix. Sometimes good food takes a while to prepare.
Make sure your spices are not old. Give them the sniff test. If they don't have a strong aroma, toss and buy new. Buy the whole nutmeg pod and grate your own. It is easy to do, and you'll never go back to pre-ground nutmeg again.

SO good.  Easy & much healthier than most desserts.  I served this with plain yogurt sweetened with honey--fantastic!

I made this salad twice, once for book club and once for new year's eve.  It was a raving success both times.  It is very easy to make.  It is a nice change of pace.  The limited ingredients are great.  It's refreshing.  We liked it better with toasted pecans instead of almonds.  The almonds didn't seem to do anything for the salad, but the pecans you could really taste and seemed to enhance it.  Remember to toast them first.  My husband actually made this dish both times as I was busy making other things, so it's easy enough for someone to make who doesn't cook a lot.  One warning - if you bring this to a party it may cause a stir if people have never had pomegranate before.  Most everyone at my parent's new years party had never had it, so my husband ended up demonstrating how to clean a pomegranate and what part to eat.  It was pretty funny as he is fairly shy.  If you're looking for a refreshing and easy fruit salad recipe you just found it!

Yum!  It's not easy finding pomegranate recipes that use the arils so I'm really glad to have found this one.  

The little seeds in the arils are edible.  They add a tiny crunch, but in my opinion don't detract from the taste.

Wonderful! I love this recipe! It is super easy to make and really tasty. I have already made this twice. It also has a beautiful presentation.  I don't understand the people who give this bad reviews just because they don't like how crunchy pomegranates are. If you don't like pomegranates, don't make this recipe!

Wonderful presentation of pomegranate and pears.  It is well worth the effort to collect the seeds.  I customized the recipe with a little whipped cream topping.  Can hardly wait for the pomegranates to be in season again!

This is a good dish but very difficult to eat. Pomegranites have very hard seeds inside each little "berry" and although the presentation is beautiful the experience is less than desirable.

A quick reminder, Pom seeds are easily separated under water. The little gems float & all else sinks. Just scoop off suffice of water w/ slotted spoon

Very very good.  I love pears, and marinating them with pomegranates and the spice mix made them even better. Wonderful salad.  I might even make it again soon in the next week (I almost never do that!)  Thanks for the recipe!

An excellent way to use pomegranate.  I usually make them the night before I need them and let them sit for a while in the fridge.  They are good as a pancake topping or a short cake topping.  Whipped cream is good on top of it too.  Also good to use in oatmeal.

Good recipe... but here's a helpful hint for removing the seeds! First cut the Pomegranate into quarters and then soak the quarters in cold water for 10-15 minutes. After soaking start breaking the seeds and flesh apart from each other and into the water. The seeds will sink to the bottom of the water and the flesh/membrane will float.So then you just have to remove the membrane and drain the water and you have a quick and stainless way of removing seeds! Enjoy!

Delicious! I substituted honey for the brown sugar and it was perfect - just the fruit dessert that I was looking for. The method for seeding pomegranates on this site was great also. Thanks!

Very tasty and something different.  I served it as a side dish to an egg bake.  We added 10 pears, and used only one pomegranate, and thought that was good. I had way too much "sauce" in mine, I wonder if that could be cut back somehow.

An amazing dessert!  The flavors pair so nicely together, I would have never thought to pair these two fruits, but what a treat for the eyes and the taste buds!  I will be brining this to every holiday function I attend, I am always trying to find healthy, low fat, low cal dishes to offer at a holiday feast.  I subbed Splenda brown sugar blend for the brown sugar to cut down on the calories.

Easy..and my daughter loves it .  It is even better the next day after the flavors all come together.  The crunchy pom seeds (andrils?) are acquired, but simply delicious.  I have even made it with apples when I didn't have pears on hand, and it was just as delicious.

I increased this dish to use up 3 pomegranates that I had. I also used a combination of plums, apples, and pears. It was a huge hit at a potluck I went to; everyone wanted the recipe!

I cannot get enough of this recipe! It has been sitting in my recipe box for a long time, and I finally decided to try it... and then immediately made it again... and will be making again this week.  Healthy, delicious combination of tart and sweet, and lovely presentation! Perfect for company. What more could you want?

Just the kind of dessert that my boyfriend and I like. Crisp and fresh.

I was out of lemons and ended up using apple cider vinegar- not a bad substitute. Tastes like fall :)

This recipe was delicious and tasted like Christmas in a bowl!  I didn't have brown sugar, and refused to make another trip to the grocery store, so I used white sugar and it was awesome.  I will be making this again soon!

I followed this recipe exactly. It is delicious! I love that is uses fresh ingredients and it's healthy. The almonds and pomegranate seeds provide a nice crunch. This is the perfect recipe to use up the fruit in my yard. I will be making this a lot!

Though I halved the fruit portion of the recipe, I kept the other measurements the same. A little overpowering, but still delicious! I also added 1/4 tsp fresh grated ginger for some extra punch and it was great! Also substituted a packet of Stevia for the sugar. And I had to use lime juice instead of lemon as I didn't feel like going to the grocery store again! Don't know if I'd make again as removing the fruity seeds was a bit of a pain... I had just wanted to photograph a pomegranate and had to use it for something! Would recommend, though! Very interesting combination of flavours!

This was good.  I love both pears and Pomegranate, but would never have thought to put them together. I did reduce the amount of sugar.

A very nice, simple, healthy dessert.  Flavors and textures combine to make a dessert that both adults and kids will love.  I look forward to pairing a nice strong cheese with this.  I'm thinking stilton.

I sauteed the pears with the spices and sugar and butter, and served them and the fresh pomegranate seeds over ice cream for a more "winter" dessert. Very good.

This was so yummy! My 9 year daughter and I made it together. Its truly that easy! Great flavors! We actually used an orange from our orange tree and pomegranates from our tree. We substituted the lemon juice juice with orange juice because we didn't have any lemons and it was wonderful! This is definitely going to be a staple in our house!

Wonderful!  I made this as a vegan dessert for my family at Christmas and everyone raved about it.  Even my husband loved it and he is not often impressed with vegan dishes.  The blend of flavors is perfect.  I will be making this again!!

This was a good recipe but I think it needs a bit of tweaking. Not sure yet what I'll do next time. I did have to use frozen pomegranate seeds  (trader joe's) because I didn't have a fresh one. I know that in itself lended to a lot more liquid than was intended - so learn from my mistake - use fresh! I also used orange juice instead of lemon juice cuz it's what I had. The flavor was good though... just maybe not complex enough. Good basic recipe. EDIT - Okay. I made this a second time, exactly according to directions except with orange juice, this time using a fresh pomegranate... wow. HUGE difference. It was much better. Love it.

I made 1 serving of this for my boyfriend for work. I didn't wait for it to sit, but had a little taste & it was really good. I'll make it again shortly in larger qty when the rest of my pears are ripe.

I give this delicious recipe 5 stars! I also added some honey mixed with Greek yogurt, instead of whipped cream. Love the crunch of the pomegranate seeds. Pomegranates are pretty easy to seed too, so the only time you really put into this recipe is waiting until the hour is up so you can eat it.

I liked the idea of this dessert because it is so much healthier than other desserts, but the flavors just didn't come together that well for me. I am curious whether it could be cooked and served warm - I think that might help!

So I ended up scooping all of this into a pie crust that I had to see what that would be like (also because the cinnamon and nutmeg really screamed pie to me) and it turned out absolutely wonderful. I added peaches and made a oat crumble top. I served it warm with a dollop of  greek yogurt on it and it was amazing. I'm eating a slice cold right now and its even better.

This was a very disappointing dish.  The pears got mushy after only a couple of hours.  The sugary mixture was too sweet.  After reading all the great reviews I thought I had a winner, but none of my guests were attracted to the dish because of the texture.  I won't make this again.

Terrific fruit salad for Thanksgiving, Christmas, fall/winter parties. (I don't bother with the almonds or mint.) Vegan; no common allergy triggers; great for potlucks--probably no one else will bring one! And pomegranates are, of course, a high-fiber, high-antioxidant "superfood" (thanks in part to those hard little edible seeds!). It'll make you happy to see pomegranates appear in the grocery in the fall...

I love pears and thought this would be great.  But I think the sugar addition overwhelmed the natural sweetness of the fruit, and the lemon juice gave it too much of a citrusy flavor.  It was good, but I'm not sure I"ll make it again.

Made this with the exact ingredients listed.  We liked it okay, but I wouldn't say we loved it.  However, it did make a light and healthy dessert with a pretty presentation.

Very good! I love pears and I love pomegranates, so it was a win/win. The spices make it smell like Christmas. Love it.

I loved this, but pears and pomegranates are 2 of my favorite fruits. I followed the recipe exactly. My mom hates pears, and even she liked this.

I made this on afternoon when the girls came over for soup and bread. It was such a beautiful addition to our lunch and so easy to make! Very tasty I will make it again.

This was delicious! I used Yellow Delicious Apples instead of pears (that's what I had on hand) - but I will try it next time with the Pears. I liked the nutmeg but my kids were unfamiliar with it and didn't like it.  Next time I will just leave it out. This is VERY pretty and I love using Pomegranates when they are in season!

I really didn't like the cold fruit with the cinnamon.  I only had canned pears - maybe that was my down fall.

FANTASTIC dish - my only 'complaint' is that it runs a little sweet. Which isn't a bad thing at all for me, as I love sweet fruit dishes, but next time I will tone down the sugar just a bit before taking to friend's dinner. Or, make it a dessert! It looks beautiful and is positively delicious.
