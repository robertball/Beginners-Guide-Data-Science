I should have listened to the comments before trying this recipe.  I like to follow the recipe first before changing anything BUT use less onion when you try this.  It's an excellent recipe ---- very good, but a cup of red onions over powers the dressing.  It was still good with the BIG onion flavor but I imagine better with less.  I think next time I will use 1/3 cup.  Really good!

This salad was WONDERFUL and will definitely make again. My picky dinner guests (parents) loved it as well. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of onion based upon feedback from other reviews. Next time, I will cut up the apples in to smaller pieces (rather than wedges) and I will soak them in a lemon/water bath to keep them from turning brown.

5 stars for the salad but only 2 for the dressing.  I must have made the dressing incorrectly because others seemed to have loved it.  Even though I used 1/3 C onion, it came out super thick and didn't look very appetizing.  Next time, I think I will just run the cranberries through the processor and then wisk the rest of the ingredients by hand.  The salad on the other hand, was fabulous!  I coated the walnuts in a cinnamon sugar glaze (approx. 1/4 sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1 T water) and then toasted them.  This really created depth to the walnuts.  I'm usually not a fan of walnuts, but I couldn't stop munching on these!  I also threw in a handful of dried cranberries and topped with feta.

Fabulous salad served for Thanksgiving dinner.  The dressing was fantastic - I made a double batch so that I could have the leftovers!  The only thing I changed is that rather than puree the cranberries, I actually simmer them for 10 minutes in the vinegar with the sugar and mustard, strained it and let it cool.  I then hand-mixed it with a wisk rather than blend it.  Past experience with blending dressings left them too frothy for my liking.  Excellent recipe!

Delicious and open to lots of adjustments... I used less red onion and more (1/2 cup) cranberries as suggested by earlier reviews and pecans because I didn't have the walnuts. I also only made a small amount of salad and am saving the dressing for more later... absolutely delicious!!

Wow was this good!  I read through the reviews before attempting this and I'm glad I did.  I used 1/2 cup of red onion and that was definitely enough.  I added a little more cranberries and more sugar.  I also added a little apple cider vinegar.  I like my salad dressing a bit thicker and don't like all the fat, so I used half the amount of oil.  I chopped the apple instead of sliced and drizzled the dressing over the greens in individual salad bowls.

Very refreshing taste.  I didn't have fresh cranberries so I used dry, and I also followed other member's advice and didn't add the onion to the food processor, and instead tossed it in with the greens.  Tasted even better the second day.

Took this to our Harvest Celebration dinner at church and it was a real winner.   You know it is good when the best cooks in the church ask for the recipe!!!    I did modify it a bit by using only 1/2 cup of onion and a wee bit more sugar..........let me say again, this salad is a real winner!   We will be having this again and again and again!    PS.......I added a handful of crasins.

This was a bit success for our Thanksgiving dinner.  I used dried cranberries and olive oil.  The dressing is thick but covers the salad nicely when tossed.  I used fresh spinach.  This was a refreshing twist on your typical spinach salad.

This is an incredibly good salad! The recipe does make WAY to much dressing, though...I would cut the recipe in half next time. I did make a couple of changes...first of all, I doubled the amount of walnuts, and instead of toasting them, I put about 1 tbs. brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. water in a saucepan, brought it to a boil, stirred in the walnuts, and after the nuts were coated, stirred in about 1/2 cup more brown sugar, and some salt and pepper. I stirred it up, removed from the heat, and allowed to cool on some foil. These were FANTASTIC on the salad, for some reason, they tasted incredible with the dressing. I also added some dried cranberries, because I wanted more cranberry flavor than the light taste in the dressing. With these changes, this salad was one of the best I've ever eaten! Thanks for sharing!

When using an onion in any recipe like this, always buy large onions because they are milder.  Also, you can soak the cut pieces of onion in water to lessen the strength of the strong taste.

Really good dressing!  Even better when you sprinkle crumbled gorgonzola cheese on top.

I made this salad for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I did change a few things based on prior comments.  I only used 1/2 cup of onions, increased the cranberries to 1/2 cup, added an extra tablespoon of sugar, and 1 cup of crumbled blue cheese.

Delicious! I also reduced the oil to half. It does make the dressing thicker, but it is still wonderful. I used olive oil.  Also, blue cheese goes great with it.

Loved it! Apples are just coming into season so it was a fun way to celebrate the fall season =) The dressing complemented the other flavors very well - I used a white balsamic raspberry-blush vinegar (or something like that...) because I had it. We loved it! I think a little goat cheese would be a great addition for next time!

Definitely needs fewer onions than stated in the recipe, but otherwise very good!  I used half the oil (olive, not vegetable) and subbed applesauce for the other half.  Toasted the walnuts and added some white cheddar and it was fantastic.  There was plenty of dressing left over, which I am sure will only get better tomorrow.  Next time I'll make the dressing the day before to give the flavors a chance to "settle."

I thought this vinaigrette recipe was great!  I used it for my Thanksgiving salad of field greens, walnuts, dried cranberries goat cheese and pomegranate seeds.
Here's a hint to cut down on that biting "raw" onion flavor.  Slice the onion before chopping and place in a strainer over the sink (try to arrange the slices so most are exposed). Pour very hot water (just off a boil) over the onions.  The quick blanching will cut down on the raw bitterness and really helps balance the flavors.  I also sub agave syrup for the white sugar for better texture.

How I made it I would give this 5 stars.  I wouldn't even try to put all the onions this recipe suggests.  I used 1 shallot instead and added a little more sugar and cranberries to the sauce.  I used micro greens and boston lettuce. Will make again.

I chopped up the onions and cranberries first then added the vinegar, sugar, mustard and oil all at the same time.  DON'T DO THIS.  It turned into a paste - like mayo.  So I remade it, put everything into the processor EXCEPT the oil then added the oil and whipped with a small hand egg whipper.  It turned out ten times better and poured like a dressing.  I did increase the cranberries to 1/2 c. and added extra sugar.  Everyone really like it.

Amazing salad with a few modifications.  I candied the walnuts in a pan with some brown sugar instead of toasting them in the oven.  I also put half the onion in the dressing and the other half directly in the salad.  Threw some craisins in the salad as well.  Also, I used craisins in the dressing, not fresh cranberries as some reviewers were saying.  It was deeeeelish!  Everyone was talking about it at a dinner party I brought it to.  :)   Oh, one more thing!  I added goat cheese to the salad and it was SO yum with the apples and cranberry flavor.

I made this last night for my Junior Woman's Club and it was gone gone gone!  A few changes - I used Craisins because that is what I had on-hand, I added some cranberry juice (concentrate, from trader joe's) and, following the advice of some other reviewers, I chopped the red onions and tossed them with the salad rather than adding them to the vinaigrette.  Delicious!!!

This delicious salad started our Thanksgiving feast this year. Everyone loved it! I used ingredients I had on hand so I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and Gala apples instead of the Red Delicious. After reading the reviews, I added Craisins and a little feta cheese. This was so good I'm planning on serving it again at Christmas. Thanks for a keeper!

This was delicious. I used fresh spinach instead of mixed greens. I also used dried cranberries for the dressing, then tossed a handful of dried cranberries into the salad. This is a perfect Autumn salad!

I had been wanting to try this for a while and thought it would be great with the pork roast recipe I was making. Anyhow, I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this. The only reason it is getting two stars is because my husband liked the flavor. I could only handle one bit and gave the rest to him. Won't be making again.

Very good.  I caramalized the walnuts for extra flavour.  Big hit at christmas party.  I also used an assortment of apples.  Serve with herbed feta or blue cheese for variety. The dressing is amazing!

I love the combination of fruit and nuts in a salad and wanted to use some apples up. Our neighbors invited us over for dinner aand said they were having pork so I thought this would be a perfect combination.  It was a big hit.  I forgot the onion though! Added dried cherries.  Would add blue or gorgonzola cheese next time.

The best part by far is the salad dressing.  It can be a bit oniony so dont add as much if you don't favor onions.  I've made this salad several times and the dressing even more!

This was great alternative to salad.  I doubled the recipe but kept the oil amount the same.  I used olive oil and used 1/2 cup red onions in the dressing since I was not sure how strong it would be.  It was not overpowering at all.  I used dried cranberries and ommitted the sugar.  I added a total of 3 Tbs of mustard for the doubled recipe.  I cut the apples up and tossed with a few more onion pieces over the lettuce.  It was a hit.  Plenty of dressing left over.  I would recommend eating it on same day.  Not the greatest as a leftover.  Definitely worth making again.

I got rave reviews for this salad at a potluck.  I increased cranberries to 1/2C and decreased onions to 1/3C.  I also used regular mustard but only 1/2 tsp. and extra virgin olive ol instead of vegetable oil. I used a blender instead of a food processor and it worked fine.  A very good dressing that I will make to have on hand for other salads!

I'm giving this a 5-star for the taste.  Made it for Easter dinner yesterday.  Followed other reviews and reduced red onion to 1/4 c. in the dressing and added the rest as thinly sliced in the salad, also reduced oil to 1/2 cup and used canola oil.  Used pecans because I didn't have walnuts, added some grapes cut in half and used a pear rather than apple because I wanted to try something different.  Salad tasted wonderful, dressing was very good with one exception.  It was soooo thick and not at all like the bottled dressings that pour.  Any suggestions on how to "thin" this out without changing the taste??

I reduced the red onion, per multiple reviewer suggestion, and found that even 1/4 of a red onion (about 1/3 cup) was still way too much.  It was very distracting from the salad.  Next time I'm going to go down to 1/4 cup (if that much).  I'm sure this recipe will be perfect once the onion is properly adjusted - but the onion just way to much.  (Are we sure 1 cup of red onion isn't a type-o?)  Oh - and cranberry jelly from the can worked fine.  Served the leftover jelly with dinner.

I love this salad! Whenever I make it, I make extra dressing so we can have it to use for a while afterwards. I add feta because I love it, and I reduced the red onion to only a small amount just because I don't like to have onion breath. Other than that, it is amazing!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year and it was delicious.  The dressing does have quite the onion bite but I liked it.  I used canola oil instead of vegetable and next time I would use olive oil as I think it makes a better viniagrette.  I also think it needed more oil, it was a very thick dressing.  But alltogether really good and well received at the dinner table!

My family won't eat anything if they know onions are in it so I just put some onion powder (not much, just a few shakes) into the dressing.  I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of the vegetable oil.  It was great at Thanksgiving and I'm making it for a Christmas party next week.

This is a great recipe for a winter salad, although I agree with the person who said there was a bit too much red onion. I love the way the cranberries plump up in the dressing. I made this during the holidays when my family was over for dinner and they all loved it!

I made this recipe twice in one weekend - following the recipe exactly makes for a tart vinaigrette that everyone loved for Thanksgiving, but it was even better when I reduced the onion to 1/2 cup and increased the cranberries to 1/2 cup, and used yellow delicious apples instead of red.  The toasted walnuts are a nice touch.  I think I'll try adding craisins next time!

This recipe was very tastey, but the taste of onions overwhelmed the dressing.  The second time I made it I only used 1/3 of a cup.  It tasted much better.  I plan on using this as our Thanksgiving Salad.

This was too oily for my taste. It was good, but it didn't knock my socks off. I doubled the cranberries and used half the onions as suggested. I ended up adding more onions, and I should have added more cranberries.

This salad is amazing!  I LOVE the dressing so much.  The only change I make to the dressing is to use less onion (about a 1/4 of a LARGE onion) and to use only 1/2 cup of olive oil, other than that I follow it exactly and it comes out delicious!  I ususally use a mixed greens/baby spinach combo for the lettuce and add crumbled fat free feta cheese to the toppings - SO, SO, SO good!

I made this for a Christmas day dinner.  The apple-walnut-cranberry-onion combination was good, but the dressing wasn't so wonderful.  It tasted good, but the appearance of it was not very appealing.  It was thick and clung to the salad leaves alright, but the red color and thick texture just didn't look very nice at all.  Don't think I'd make this again.

Loved this, but I made an alteration and will make another the next time I make this. I did not put the red onion in the dressing as the recipe says, I simply sprinkled it on top of the salad when I was putting it together. I probably only used about a 1/3 of a cup, too. Also, the dressing was a little too thick for our family's liking so I would reduce the sugar (the dressing thickening agent) to 2 tsps.

Great salad dressing! I did leave out the onion in the dressing but chopped it in the salad as some recommended.  I also toasted the walnuts in a small pan and added some real maple syrup to candy them.  My husband was lucky they made it to his salad because as I was cooking other things I kept eating the walnuts. : )

Yum! I love this recipe as written, but I agree with the reviewers that suggest less onion in the dressing and adding onion to the salad. I put some green onionn and blue cheese in my salad this time. I also think this would make a great dinner salad with cold chicken or turkey, cheese and/ or bacon. Thanks for the recipe!

This has become an all time favorite of mine. I am a big time salad eater where my meal consists of a huge bowl of salad. The dressing for this salad is wonderful. I double the cranberries and keep everything else the same. Yummy! Yummy! I got the idea from seeing other salads to try this recipe with candied walnuts. So far, I've tried this recipe with cinnamon candied walnuts, regular candied walnuts, and store bought candied walnuts (Diamond brand, from Sam's Club) and all are excellent! I also add cucumber, carrots, red bell pepper, sliced onion, apples, (grapes if I have some on hand), lots of spinach and some salty feta cheese to finish on the top with the walnuts. Remember, this is my meal! I absolutely love this salad and all the fruits/veggies I add to this salad all compliment one another. The only thing I have found that doesn't fit are olives and tomatoes! Excellent recipe! Thank you!

This was pretty good.  I found the mustard in the dressing didn't really fit in with the apples and I also used less onions.  I also added some swiss cheese and crasins to the salad.  I'll make this again, just without the mustard.

Love the apples and walnuts in this salad.  The dressing is also great, but I will put in less onion and more cranberries next time.  I liked the thickness of the dressing and didn't actually add all the oil that was called for.

This recipe was OK. I will make it again, but with some substitutiions. The dressing had a very strong onion flavor.  I may try a different type of onion.  I will also try adding some fetta cheese.

This salad was a huge hit with my guests.  They all wanted a copy of the recipe.  I think the ratio of onions to cranberries is right on.  We're making it a new traditional presentation on our Thanksgiving table.

What a wonderful salad to make on a crisp fall day! The dressing is delicious! The "salad" part is so easy to make! This will become one of my favorites and a staple in our house!

Super delicious salad! I cut the dressing amount down to 1/4 and it was plenty of dressing for a 5 oz. package of salad greens (I used a spring mix)and used one apple. I added sliced red onion to the salad (and not in the dressing) and used only dried cranberries, which I let soak in the dressing I mixed up earlier using just a whisk. I had to use pecans instead of walnuts. As I stated I used 5 oz. of spring mix, but just added the amount of pecans, red onion, and cranberries I felt it needed.

This was delicious and very easy to make. As most other reviewers did, I reduced the amount of onion in the dressing to about half a cup and that seemed perfect. I used more cranberries, maybe half a cup, and increased to sugar by about half a tablespoon, and that was good for us. Thanks!

Good stuff! I took the suggestions of using a 1/3 cup of red onions, a half cup of cranberries & soaking the apples in a lemon water bath. I did not have vegetable oil on hand, but I had walnut oil & it came out great. I would only recommend toasting the walnuts about 5 minutes.

We found the dressing to be way too strong with the amount of onion - will try again with half of the required amount...

This was outstanding!  I cut back on the onion as I am not a big fan, and I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's all I had on hand.  The dressing has just the right amount of tartness.  Delicious!

GREAT salad!  I made it for my son's 5th birthday party and everyone really liked it.  People were asking about the dressing, saying it was really good.  I cut back on the onions adding only 1/3 cup based on others' reviews.  I also whisked the dressing together, because of someone's review of the food processor making it "frothy" (ew).  And I chopped the dried cranberries by hand.  VERY tastey!  Thank you.

Good salad for entertaining or bringing to a BBQ.  Dressing went well with apples and walnuts.  Added cranberries on top and fresh baby spinach.  It was a big hit.

Usually not a big fan of nuts and fruits in my salad, but this was great. The dressing was definitely the best part, and I wanted to drink it! Five stars for the dressing alone!

I should probably try this again when I run out of cranberry walnut dressing.  Bf decided to buy 3 bottles of it (or maybe it was 5?  can't remember now--we have three at the moment) so I needed something that would work with the dressing itself from our bottles.  This worked really well--I guess a sweet dressing needs a sweet salad.  I wasn't that impressed with it before.  I like it in this salad, though, so my review is more on the salad itself as opposed to the dressing.  Can't say I'll try the dressing soon with all those bottles of dressing running around, but I'll try to remember this and come back to it when I run out of those pesky things.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe numerous times and I love it.  It's wonderful no matter what, but if you follow the directions exactlly the onion can be quite overpowering.  I suggest halving the onion and then it's perfect.

This salad is wonderfully easy to put together. I served it with a homemade turkey pot pie and they went well together. I left the dressing a little chunky. It was more appealing visually and it was nice to get an occasional bit of cranberry.

As many of the other reviews recommended, I used less onion than the recipe calls for.  I used maybe a 1/2 cup and it was very good, but next time I would go with only 1/3 cup.  Otherwise, this recipe is great.  Even my parents who tend to like plain, boring food liked this!

I added some orange juice to thin out the dressing without adding more fat.  It really boosted the flavor.

My family and I loved this salad. I followed one of the users suggestion of coating the walnuts in a cinnamon/sugar glaze and adding dried cranberries. I omitted the onion from the recipe mainly because I'm just not a fan of onion but I wouldn't be opposed to trying it later just to see the difference. I thought the dressing was fine without. It is a little thick but does the job - once it's tossed it's no big deal! Next time i will also try with feta and also will cut the apples into smaller pieces instead of wedges.  This salad is definitely a keeper!

I'm not a big salad person but this one definitely changed my mind! I made a few slight changes. I toasted the walnuts with a little bit of melted butter and cinnamon and sugar. It was a great contrast to the dressing. Also, I used the cranberries and onions in the salad dressing as well as adding them whole to the salad itself. First I softened the dried cranberries with a little bit of cinnamon water. I found that making the dressing a night or two before gave it better flavor. This dish won first prize at my work potluck!

I cut down the amount of onion as mentioned by other reviewers.  I did not have cranberries so I substituted craisens in the dressing, then sprinkled some on with the apples.  Everyone wanted second helpings and my guests all asked for the recipe.  This is one salad I will make again.

The salad was very good and the dressing is out of this world.  This was my first attempt at a salad dressing and went so well that I can't wait to try another.  Just a note, I used shaved almonds because that is what I had and it was still good.  Also, per recommendation of previous reviewers, did not add the onion to the dressing but directly to the salad.  Perfection.

This was excellent, though next time I'll use a little less of the onion. To compensate for how strong it was, I just added more cranberries.

Yumm - I made this salad for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit with my guests.  I got lots of compliments on the dressing.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut way back on the onion and also glazed the walnuts prior to toasting.  I also sprinkled Craisins on the individually plated salads prior to serving.  This one is definitely a keeper.

The dressing was a little thick, easy to fix with a little more vinegar.  Used red d'anjou pears, bleu cheese, and sliced the onions.  Perfect holiday salad.

Delicious recipe!  Be sure to add the dressing gradually to the greens; I had way more dressing that I needed and it would have been overpowering if I used it all at once.  The walnuts finish it off beautifully.

Great salad!  Many positive comments when I brought it to a large group dinner.  I definitely cut back on the onion- as many suggested.  I also carmelized my walnuts, and used gala apples since I'm not a big red delicious fan.  By using a firmer flesh apple, it was able to hold up longer.

YUM!!  This ranks right up with the Spinach strawberry salad.  Couldn't stop eating it.  I left out the onion (not a big raw onion fan) and used about a cup of craisens for the dressing.  The dressing was really thick that way, but tossed in with the salad, it was very good.  Will be making this again soon.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I followed the suggestion of others and cut back on the onion.  I have a bad habbit of never measuring things, so I would guess that I used about 1/4 cup of chopped onions in the dressing, and then added about another 1/4 cup slivered onions to the salad itself incase people wanted to pick them off.  The walnuts were wonderful, and I would add more.  I used honeycrisp apples in this as they are our favorite, and they were SO good in there.  If you want more of a "bite" to the salad, you may want to add some crumbled feta cheese to the salad.  This goes so well with turkey.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very quick and easy recipe. I left out the red onion and cranberries since I didn't have any, and the salad was still great.

Great recipe for a delicious homemade recipe!  Only thing I would recommend is use half the suggested amount of onions.  I made the recipe to the specs and ened up adding more of everything else to balance the strong onion taste.  I also love cranberries so I added more cranberries to really taste them.

I left out the onion as suggested by previous reviewers.  I also had to add quite a bit more sugar to cut back on a very strong vinegar taste.  After the adjustments it was quite good, especially with the toasted walnuts.

If you thinly slice the red onions rather than adding them to the dressing you can control the amount of onion flavor - plus it's prettier.

Great taste and pretty presentation, Barrett! Our dinner company enjoyed this, as did we. I cut back on the onion as others suggested. Also, I had some cooked crumbled bacon that I needed to use up. Very tasty! Thanks.This will definitely go into our favs......

I thought the salad had too much onion, and I do like onions. I would recommend about half the amount. Overall, though, I loved the combination of the ingredients - made a good salad.

WAY too much onion, it was all I could taste and I only added 1/2 of the dressing. But I did get compliments on it so it's worth trying again, I think. Next time I'll try more of a mustardy vinaigrette with white onion.

Salad was a hit!  Never the type to measure exactly but nevertheless everyone loved my dish and left with an empty bowl.  Used whatever I had in my fridge/pantry.  1C walnuts, 1/2 crasins vs cranberry, 1 small wht onion, 1T spicy brown mustard, canola oil and didn't have to use salt & pepper.  Yes, dressing came out thick but it coated the greens very well and the extra walnuts were loved by all the nut fans.  Planning on making more soon.

I made this salad for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. I did change a few things based on prior comments. I only used 1/2 cup of onions, increased the cranberries to 1/2 cup, added an extra tablespoon of sugar, and 1 cup of crumbled blue cheese.

I made this for a ladies event at my church. It is absolutely delicious!!! I made more than enough to go around and an hour later when it was time to eat dessert everyone went for more salad!!!! I didn't change very much. I added extra apples and used 3 different kinds. I candied the walnuts and added gorgonzola cheese to the salad. It is beautiful and I will be making it for Christmas dinner along with almost everyone from my church!!!

Great recipe! It's the first time I make a vinaigrette and I was very satisfied with it. I did some modifications though. As others suggested I reduced the amount of onion for the vinaigrette so I used 1/4 cup. I also reduced the oil amount to 3/4 and used canola oil.  First I mixed the sugar, onions, balsamic vinegar, and mustard on a bowl. I pureed the cranberries and then added the mixture from the bowl into the food processor and pureed the mix. I then added the oil. It had the perfect consistency for a dressing, not thick at all, but not completely runny either. I also followed chibi chef's suggestion to glaze the walnuts and I was very happy with the flavor they added to the salad. I only used one red delicious apple (chopped in small pieces) instead of two and it added just a sweet flavor to contrast the vinaigrette. Overall a great salad!

We had a our Feather Social function this past weekend at our local Elks and I made this salad and everyone LOVED it. I agree with some of the others about cutting back on the onions and adding more sugar. Used white sugar as called for but after tasting decided it needed more sugar. So I added some brown sugar. YUM YUM!!

I was looking for a fall salad to go with a dinner I was cooking and this was perfect. I didn't have the cranberries so I just left those out. And I substituted the walnuts for pecans. But my whole family really enjoyed it. The onions were a little much but overall it was good. It was so much better than putting dressing on some lettuce and that is it! The apples gave it a really good crunch! I will definitly be trying this with the cranberries next time!!!

Fantastic! I used less onion as recommended and used toasted pecans instead of walnuts because that is what my family prefers and added a little bit of shredded mozzarrella. Great salad! Will definitely be making again! Update: made this for a dinner party and everyone went back for seconds! I was even asked for the recipe which means it is extremely good! It is a new favorite!

Excellent salad and easy to make.  Even though it's simple, it's special enough to make for company or a potluck.  I eyeballed the ingredients, and I probably used extra craisins and a little less onion.  You could do other things with this recipe as a base, as others have noted, like add cinnamon sugar or spice to the walnuts, add cheese, or add extra cranberries on top.

OH MY GOODNESS, love it.  I renamed it "Michigan Symphony Salad" because the flavors blend like a lovely piece of music!  Thanks for this amazing salad, I'll be serving it all summer.

This was excellent.  A refreshing change from regular salad.  I can never make dressing turn out, but this one worked very well. I took the advice of others and cut the red onion to less than 1/2 cup. It was still a very strong flavor in the dressing.  I also only used 1/2 c. olive oil.  Thanks for a great way to change up salad!

I thought this salad was delicious.  I read some reviews that said the dressing was too thick but I completely disagree; even using less oil than the recipe calls for.  I did however, blend this with an imulsion blender instead of in the food processor.  I have already made this salad again and prefer it with sliced pears instead of apples.

This was a tasty salad for New Year's Eve, although my finished version was based on lots of the changes recommended by others.  I reduced chopped onion to 1/4 cup, increased dried cranberries to 1/2 cup., added 1T more sugar, used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, reduced oil to 1/2 cup olive oil and thinned with 2T orange juice.  (It was still a very thick dressing that flattened down my lettuce, so I might consider adding more OJ next time.)  I also used the tip to pour hot water over the sliced onion to lighten the onion flavor.  I had additional onion slices for those who wanted to add onion to their bowl of  salad.  Also aded dried cranberries to the tossed salad and used Dole glazed walnuts instead of plain ones. 

 I used this tip to keep the apple slices from browning:  Mix 2T honey into 1 cup water.  Slice one apple and immediately put the slices in the water and hold underwater for 30 seconds.  Remove and place in a zip lock bag, removing as much air as possible.  Do the second apple (need to do them separately to make them fit into the 1 cup of honey/water solution.)  Remove and add to ziplock bag.  I left them in the bag for a couple of hours until it was time to toss the salad and they looked perfect and did not brown in the salad either.

Delicious but, sorry, I did make some changes. I used 1/3 cup cranberries and 1/3 cup onions, 2 t. mustard, only 1/2 cup oil for dressing and 3 apples in salad. I was making this for my grandchildren and family so knew I had to modify a bit. Otherwise it was very good. Thanks Barrett

Made this as directed.  The dressing seemed very "gloppy" and hard to mix with the tender lettuce and get good coverage.  The flavors were good, but I won't be making it again.

It was good except for the dressing.  1 cup of oil was way too much, the greens got soggy quickly and looked unappealing, so less was consumed.  Too bad!

Delicious, love this vinaigrette.  Used some suggestions from other reviews and cut the amount of red onion in half, still had a nice onion flavor in the dressing.  Added dried cranberries to the salad as well.  The recipe did make a lot of dressing - I lightly dressed the salad and then put the rest on the side and had at least half of it still leftover.  But it is so good we have been using it all week on salads!

Really good. At first we didn't have balsamic vinegar so we used red wine vinegar. It was sooo delicious. Tried it again with balsamic and ended up loving the first one better. Plus it makes the vinegrette bright pink, which looks better than the salmon-ish colour. Also added feta. So good.

I made this salad as a light alternative side dish for Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I did follow other reviewers' advice and cut back on the red onion, but otherwise followed exactly.  I used baby romaine for the greens.  My only complaint is that the dressing is a little thick. I made it again the next day for lunch and added leftover turkey.  Delicious!

I didn't have cherries so I used dried cranberries.   Will

My Grandkids made this to go with a nice Salmon patty and low carb cheesecake cupcakes for their Mom on Mother's Day. She raved about this dressing. She just loved it and the toasted walnuts put it over the top. We used a nice mix of greens and spinach. This is a real keeper. My Grandkids put this in their cookbook as a favorite

I left out the onion because they give me migraines and subbed in a clove of garlic.  Those of us who tried the dressing liked it, I felt it needed more sugar so I ended up putting in another tablespoon before refrigerating what was left.  I would definately make this again.

I agree with previous comments - cu the onion way down - maybe 1/4 of whats called for. I also used good olive oil. Great flavour.

Didn't like the dressing at all - to much onion & we didn't use all it called for.  I think it also had to much balsamic vinegar or Dijon mustard also.  We'll stick with other recipes that have cranberries & walnuts in from this site that we like.

I quite liked this recipe. After reading reviews, I too added feta and craisins. I used 1/2 an onion and felt it was perfect. I processed the first ingredients, then whisked in the oil (not quite as much as recipe called for, but I eyeballed it and added to taste). 

The best part is that I have lots of dressing left for another salad!

Did as others suggested and used less onion.  Definitely a keeper!  Our dinner guests even asked for the recipe!

This is a great dressing! I used a scant 1/4 cup on red onion and think you could do even less. When I make the salad, I'm planning to add in feta cheese, dried cranberries and walnuts. Yum!

The dressing is fantastic - I bought frozen cranberries and they worked perfectly fine. I would have done a full cup of the roasted chopped walnuts..mmmmm

Delicious! I omitted the onion altogether and skipped the cranberries from the dressing. In a bowl, I put baby greens, thinly sliced apples and chopped craisins. I made the dressing by whisking the vinegar, oil, 1/2 tsp regular mustard, sugar and S&P. I topped the salad with pecans roasted with butter, brown sugar and salt. It was a hit at Christmas at my in-law's! Truly scrumptious

A little too sweet for everyday use, but great as an occasional treat.
Downgraded to a '4' in favor of the better "Morgan's Waldorf Salad".

This salad was TERRIBLE.  I may as well have had my guests bite into a raw onion!  Even the odor of the dressing was overpoweringly that of onion.  I suggest renaming this salad Onion Salad or possibly Trail of Tears!

I forgot to follow reviewers advice.  I followed the recipe adding 1 cup red onion to the vinaigrette.  Strong onion taste dominated the entire salad. I suggest you cut WAY back on the amount of red onion.

While this recipe sounded good, the vinaigrette didn't really turn out all that well for me, and the apples ended up quite brown.  I think I'll stick with another vinaigrette.
