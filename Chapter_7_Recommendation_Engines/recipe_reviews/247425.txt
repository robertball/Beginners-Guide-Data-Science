To economize on cost, I made this with sliced up Criminis. Also, I prefer mushrooms with beef broth, so I used beef instead of chicken broth. Additionally, I only had smoked paprika on hand and used that. This soup was out-of-this-world delicious! The wild rice early sucks up the broth as it cooks, and even though I began with 2  qts of broth, between the rice and lost steam, I ended up adding another 1.5 qts of broth.  I will probably precook the rice next time and then dump in the already cooked rice. We will definitely have this again, it is one of my best soups ever!

Delicious! I added an extra cup of broth for more liquid consistency.  Flavor is delicious!  I'll make this again for sure.

Loved the recipe, we picked our own mushrooms and processed 8 cups and added a cup of Sherry as this made the mushroom flavor pop!
