Didn't really have much of a flavor. Mostly tasted like water. I personally added a lot more brown sugar and some vanilla. Can't say that I'll ever use it again.

Ok,  I tried this despite the reviews because I was looking for a thin caramel sauce to pore over bread pudding.  The other reviews helped me a lot.  I did not use as much water and I added a little more brown sugar and syrup and it made my bread pudding killer!  Next time I am going to add chopped toasted pecans.

This is absolutely the worst recipe I have ever made!! It was terrible tasting and had way too much water in it. I will definitely never make it again!

I made this recipe to put over a pecan pie. It was awful. The thin, watery, bland sauce did not even make it off the stove. It was not a good recipe in the slightest. This recipe should not be posted on this website because of its poor quality.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It came out looking and tasting just what it was...light brown sugar water. Sorry. I tried to make changes like adding more sugar and vanilla but it didn't help. Maybe you should decrease the amount of water.

I used dark brown sugar, half and half instead of water, and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  This is a terrifice sauce.

My husband made the sauce and, by mistake, measured the sugar in cups instead of spoons. To try and fix it, he added some cinnamon, vanilla and fresh nutmeg. The result: TERRIFIC...! You should try the variation...

I too wish I had read the reviews before making, tasted like sugary water. Thought these were tested recipes, hope you don't post just any junk on here like that one was. Went straight in the garbage.

Could it simply that the 2 cups water are meant to be 2 cups sugar? Haven't tried that out myself but wouldn't that seem more reasonable?

Use half the water and triple the sugar, more cornstarch and also let it come to a boil again after the cornstarch has been added.

my dad's family always made a "rice pudding" every xmas time & used this kind of sauce, I don't think I made it right cuz it kept turning out runny. I tried this & don't know yet. I can't cook or bake so doing this is a risky move. I want my RICE PUDDING WITH CARMEL SAUCE!  I may have to just ask my Aunt again for the carmel sauce thing. I got the other part down

A good sauce if you use it on something sweet- I used 1/2 the water instead of the full 2 cups. A good flavor, and just sweet enough. I'm keeping it!

Sorry but this sauce was awful.  It had very little flavor.  I was  looking for something to dip apples into and this was so lacking that I threw it out.

Thank you for your recipe for caramel sauce. I made it to go with bread pudding. I changed the recipe slightly, with the addition of dark brown sugar -- added a few extra tablespoons-- and powdered creamer (original flavor) to make it more flavorful, thick, and creamy.  I did not know how to make caramel sauce, and this was easy-to-make. Thanks again for your recipe.

Will never make again, nasty color and had no flavor.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to put it on Figgy pudding but yikes it was awful.   No offense but would like to see it tweaked to be more of a caramel color, I stupidly didn't read reviews or look closely at picture.

Delicious!! I read the reviews so when I made it I cut the amount of water in half and added more sugar.  I also added a teaspoon of milk to make it creamy. After cooking I still wasn't thrilled with the consistency so I added just a tablespoon of sifted flour. It came out perfectly! I drizzled it over vanilla ice cream and had that on the side of a hot apple pie. It was heaven!
