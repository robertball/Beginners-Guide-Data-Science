There are two types of meringue; soft and hard.  The difference between the two is the amount of sugar added to the egg whites.  Soft meringue is made with only a small amount of sugar and is used as a topping for pies and cakes. The more sugar in the recipe the crisper the cookie will be.  If you cut too far back on the sugar the cookies will be more like marshmallows.  Hope this helps clear up the sugar debate.

I am in school for baking and pastry and this is the closest thing I have seen yet to how I have learned to make meringues properly.  My suggestion for those of you having problems with it taking so long to make would be to let the eggs reach room temp before you try to whip them.  It makes the whipping process go much faster.

These are just like the gourmet meringues you buy at the specialty grocery stores.  They are soo yummy! I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and increased sugar by 1/4 cup to make up for the added liquid.  I also set my oven to 185, instead of putting a spoon in the door.  It worked great.  Next time I will definitely add a different flavor or chocolate chips! Also,  I used parchment paper on the pan instead of butter and flour. This is a much better way to go because they fall right off the paper and you have no residue on the bottom of the cookie.

Foolproof and delicious.  DO NOT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR.  The only thing that I did differently was that I scraped half of a vanilla bean into the egg whites when they reached the stiff peak stage.  (If you add liquid vanilla extract, you will have to up the sugar content, as the extra liquid WILL affect the outcome of the cookies.)  As many former reviewers have noted, the egg whites take a good 15-20 minutes to reach the stiff peak stage with an electric mixer.  (My KitchenAid Pro 600 took about 16-17 minutes.)  Next time, I'm going to try folding some toasted coconut into the finished mixture.

I have made this recipe several times.  I add 1/2 t. flavored extract to the mixture.  I make the cookie larger with an indention in the middle.  After they have cooled I use a coordinated flavor of chilled pie filling (spooned into the indention) and serve as a dessert.  In other words if I use lemon extract in the cookie I use lemon pie filling for the dessert.  I also add a dollop of whip cream on the top.

I don't have an extremely sweet tooth, and thought this original recipe is way too sweet.  So I cut the sugar to half and then I added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar to compensate. My husband's grandmother use to make meringues for him, and he said it is exactly like he remembered it.  So obviously the lack of sugar did not affect the sweetness so much as the rigidity of the meringues. But the technique of this recipe is perfect!

This is a no fail recipe.  As a chef, I'll give some tips for any beginners out there.  Take a papertowel and about 1 tsp of white distilled vinegar and wipe your stainless bowl with it.  This makes sure there are no oils that will interfere with your egg whites.  Further, I always add about 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  It doesn't change the taste and it makes the whites stiffen up quickly, especially if you don't have time to let the egg whites come completely to room temp.  After the egg whites were completely stiff, I added a dash of cinnamon and butter extract.  I topped them with mini-morsels and made them smaller so that they cook faster.  Hope this helps!  Great recipe and super tasty meringues!

I really don't like giving poor ratings and reviews, but I felt like I needed to give a heads-up to people who might be considering using this recipe.  I don't understand all the great reviews and wonderful results people supposedly got with this recipe.  My meringue NEVER got past the stage where it looked like melted marshmallow creme.  I let it whip in my Kitchenaid for about 15 minutes and watched it the entire time, so I know I didn't "over-beat" it.  I added the sugar about 2 Tbs at a time, letting each addition fully blend in before adding more.  There was no way I could pipe this into anything but a puddle on the baking sheet, so I ended up using the "Peppermint Meringues" recipe instead, omitting the crushed candy canes.  That recipe has cream of tartar in it, which I think really is necessary for getting the meringue nice and stiff (every lemon meringue pie recipe I've ever made called for cream of tartar in the meringue).

Tips for those who are having problems with these falling flat: meringues are very delicate and almost anything can go wrong with them. It is possible that you are either under-whipping them, or whipping them too much. If you over-whip something, you can make it fall flat by whipping the air back out of it. Conversely, if you don't have enough air it won't stay tall.  A few tips on meringues: *If you have ANY egg yolk, throw it out and start over. It will ruin the structure of the meringue. *Before you add the sugar it's better to be safe than sorry; make sure that your meringue is stiff at the very least, and I prefer to whip mine just before there are stiff peaks forming. (To test this, take a utensil and stick it in the mixture, then draw it out forming a little peak or tail; if it sticks up, it is a stiff peak, if it droops over you may want to consider whipping it more.) *You can also tell how stiff the mixture is by whether the mixture fills itself back out if you part it in the middle. Your mixture should separate and stay separate. *You do not want to have glossy peaks before you add the sugar. You have a greater potential to ruin it if you get to the shiny/satin stage before you add anything. *Oils will ruin the mixture, so be careful if adding flavorants or colors. *Add the sugar VERY slowly. So slowly it hurts. Never dump anything you add, including flavors. *Lift the tip of the pastry bag up and away when piping, don't smash it down in!  Hope this helps!

I served French Meringues at an afternoon tea...easy to make and visually elegant.  Even though I didn't have a pastry tube...I made them free-hand with a spoon...they were still beautiful!  Make sure you whip them for at least 15 minutes to get the desired consistency.

Delicious! I love meringue cookies and had only made my own meringue for pies in the past, but this recipe was great.  Tip for others-chill your bowl and beaters before you use them, I find it helps the mixture get the right consistency faster.

I had made creme brulee for my husband and was left with 4 egg whites - what a perfect answer this was since I am from the "waste not" generation.  Room temp egg whites made them whip up faster and the confectioners sugar must be the answer since these are the best meringues ever.  Thanks for this one!!

This was the best meringue cookie recipe I've found! I used to use the one in a cook book, but they never turned out- these were great! The only thing I would say would be is that they turned out better when places on a dark colored pan and placed on the top rack.

MUST BEAT A LOOONG TIME OR THEY WILL BE MERINGUE "BUTTONS"!! These were simple, delicious and elegant.  I added peppermint extract and extra powdered sugar.  Painted red food paste on inside of pastry bag in stripes.  Looked like peppermint swirls; most were pale pink and deep red striped.  EDIT: So I made another batch today (have made many times) and I added 1/2 packet of raspberry jello.  WOW.  Don't know if I prefer these to the peppermint ones.  Half the pkg. is more than sufficient-plenty of raspberry flavor.  Will post photo when they are done.  PARCHMENT PAPER IS PERFECT for this recipe.  I have now made it over 20 times, never had a bad result.

Great recipe!! I added a little almond extract and loved it even more!! Just one question though, is it possible to keep the meringues white instead of getting lightly browned while baking??

I have alwasy used cream of tartar w/ my meringues & I have always used granulated sugar. Not anymore! Well, I may add a bit of cream of tartar but I'll never go back to granulated sugar. The powdered sugar wasn't nearly as sweet or grainy. I used parchment paper instaed of buttering & flouring & I piped these into heart shapes, sprinkling them w/ some red sugar before baking. I'm fairly pleased w/ the result except that the sizes weren't consistent since I free-handed them. Smarty-pants hubby suggested that next time, I draw heart shapes onto the parchment paper & then pipe along the pencil marks. (I hate it when he is smarter than me but I will use his suggestion LOL) Thanks for the recipe RANDYVH!

Confectioners suger contains some cornstarch, which will contribute to the stability of the meringues.  If you substitute regular sugar, you should add a tablespoon of cornstarch at the end, along with any flavoring or food coloring.

Great recipe: the oven temperature and cooking time is just right, and if like me you live in a very dry place, there's no reason these won't turn out perfect! I start with about 1 cup of confectionner's sugar and then taste the batter until I find it sweet enough :) I also add a good teaspoon of real vanilla extract (makes the meringue taste more refined, in my opinion). Also, I do use a pastry bag when I intend to give them away since it makes them pretty, but I found that if I just shape the meringue by scooping some of the batter with a big spoon they end up being more fluffy, less flat... Last touch: dip the top half of each meringue in dark chocolate and let it dry... Heaven!

Awesome!  I am so pleased with myself that I actually made meringues. :)  My first batch didn't turn out great, so I went back and read reviews and discovered that I was supposed to beat the whites much longer than I did.  So I tried again, beat them for ten minutes, and they turned out perfect.  They were done 15-20 minutes sooner than the recipe said, but thankfully I checked them. Later Edit: Too much sugar. They tasted like sugar instead of meringue.

These are the best tasting meringues i have tried. I chopped up chocolate and did end up with little sugar droplets coming out of the meringues. I researched and found that this is because the temperature was too high. I would suggest knocking the temp down to 180 with a spoon in. I  whipped mine for 17minutes and don't think they turned out stiff enough. I think where mine messed up is the fact that i didn't beat the eggs whites alone long enough. I would suggest beating the egg whites till they are extremely foamy, not just a little, and then add the sugar a little at a time. I hope my mistakes help some of you!

These meringues are fantastic- light, crunchy, perfect! I scraped 1/2 of a vanilla bean into the egg at the same time I added the sugar. I folded in 3 crushed candy canes before piping and then sprinkled them with more candy cane. The result was great! I will make them every Christmas, I am sure.  FWIW, I did some tests with freezing them and had success. I put them in a ziploc bag and then into a plastic container and froze them. To thaw, just set the whole thing out at room-temp and DO NOT OPEN either container until the entire thing is room temp. The meringues should be just as good as when you made them.

Ive never had meringue cookies before! So easy to make. They just melt in your mouth. Did some with cocoa powder and almond extact. It was a good variety. Thank you for the recipe. Will be making this again.

Perfect Meringues. Some people like it chewy inside and some people like it crisp in every bite. Just FYI, if you like it chewy, just leave the meringues on a plate and let it sit without cover. But if you like it crispy, keep it in a tight container. BUT MAKE SURE YOU THE MERINGUES are dry completely before taking it out of the oven.

I love meringues, and have never had a recipe, that makes them firm and crisp like this recipe. I thought that it would be too much sugar, but it worked perfectly, and they were not too sweet - using confectioners sugar makes all the difference.  I did add a 1/4 teaspoon  of cream of tartar(don't know why, just never have made meringues without it) and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I don't know how long I beat the egg whites, but thankfully, I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer and not my hand mixer.  I did not butter and flour the pans, but used parchment paper which I think is a must when baking cookies.  I used 2 cookie sheets, so I set my oven to convection and did not put a wooden spoon in the door.  I also left the cookies in the oven after I turned the oven off as the oven cooled down.  I will add mini chocolate chips to half of my next batch, also almond extract would be nice.

Made lovely little baskets by overturning those disposable aluminum muffin tin things, spraying them with a thin layer of cooking spray then carefully piping over with meringue.  I filled these with fresh berries.  Would cook longer at a lower temp if I did it again.

I was shocked that I was able to make something close to as great as what they sell in Paris...Although I did have trouble keeping my oven at a low enough temp...I agree less sugar was needed...and I used a large zip lock bag with the tip cut out instead of a pastery bag.

Well, I didn't get 36 out of this but i also didn't use a piping bag so it's all good. Anyway, I signed up specifically to say that these are really good and really easy. I used my kitchen aide and the whipping time took about 15 minutes. My boyfriend who doesn't like sweets just hid some behind his back before telling me he's had about 5 since I started cooking (2 hours ago). They took me about 1.5 hours to cook. I'm going to make some more last minute for passover! Oh, Also, after everything was completely done, before spooning onto the cookie sheet, i added a tsp of pure vanilla (none of the imitation stuff, but liquid vanilla extract). Excellent.

These are beautiful cookies.  I forgot to butter my parchment and they stuck, but the texture was great.  I would like to try with some flavors next time.

This was a great recipe super easy. I piped the meringues out in the shape of a ghost and added eyes and a nose with frosting. Too cute for a holiday treat.

HELP!? I tried to make these 3 times in a row and each time they were more like icing and not "puffy." They look more like little pancakes on the baking sheet. Am I not beating enough?

My mom and I use to make cookies similar to this, but had lost the recipe.  So I tried this with some variations.  Instead of sugar I used raspberry jello and at the end folded in chocolate chips.  This is how we made them when I was little.  This were just like them.  Thanks.

We tried these for the first time a couple weeks ago and they turned out great.  Since then we've made a lot of variations and so far, they've all been good.  We added peppermint extract, mini chocolate chips and just a couple drops of green food color and made mint chocolate chips. Raspberry chocolate chip was good, too.  Cinnamon, Fresh orange, Lemon poppy--they were all good.  Thanks, Randy.

This recipe was fantastic! I had no issues at all..My egg whites whipped up in about 5 minutes, using an electric hand mixer. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups only and added 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar while whipping the egg whites. Also, I took some advice from previous users by wiping my bowl and beaters with vinegar (allowing to fully dry) before whipping the egg whites. I cooked the cookies in a gas oven at 200F, for the whole 3 hrs; with the wooden spoon proped in the door. Even though I did not use parchment paper, my cookies did not stick to the pan, as I used the suggested butter and flour on the cookie sheet. Great Recipe!

I LOVED the texture but next time I'll add flavoring.  Mine tasted funny - like eating a spoonful of powdered sugar: sweet, but weird.

Mine did not set up but I read a few other websites and think I did a few missteps that caused it.  You can't get even the slightest hint of yolk in it and I had a tiny bit.  It is also best to let the eggs sit out at room temp for 30 minutes or so before making it.  Instead I am currently baking meringuesque puddles, but I liked the flavor so hopefully I can try again minus my mistakes.

I thought this recipe was extremely easy.  After reading a lot of the reviews, I planned to beat the egg whites for at LEAST twenty minutes.... don't even think about less time.  The meringues were flavourful, but really sweet (for me- and I love sweets).  I plan to cut the sugar to maybe 1-1/4 cups and add chocolate chips next time.  Thank you!!!!

Melt-in-your-mouth delicious!  I used the specified ratio of whites to sugar.  Even with my stand mixer on almost the highest speed, it took a good 15 to 20 minutes to get stiff peaks.  If you want beautiful cookies that hold their shape, be sure to beat the egg whites long enough!  Also, two additional options for keeping them from sticking to the pan:  1) mix equal parts shortening and flour and smear on the pan (I do this for all my cakes and it prevents the gummy mess on the outside), or 2) use ungreased parchment paper (so fast and easy!).  A final note and word of advise stemming from my goof--if you have a gas oven, you may not be able to leave the door cracked.  I tried this and my cookies were not done after 7 hours.  I enlisted my husband's help and the oven wouldn't stay lit with the door open so they had basically been baking by the oven light only!  I shut the door, reheated to 200 and baked an additional 2 hours and they came out perfectly.  I think next time I will reduce the heat to 185 and bake the entire time with the door closed then turn the oven off and open the door to cool when the baking is complete.  I hope these tips help--these cookies really are delectable!!!

I love this recipe. I use regular suger run through the blender instead of the confectioners stuff and have had perfect results. To reduce/eliminate cracking, I keep my meringues small. I made some in extra-flat shapes and made peanut-butter sandwiches with them, now my co-workers won't leave me alone during the holidays!

I had left over egg whites from making crepes and I decided to make meringues with what was left.  This recipe was easy (tiring 'cause I had to hand whip it) but lovely and light, with that satisfying crunch.  Definately an elegant light cookie.   I believe it would be a great recipe to use as a base for different flavours.  The only drawback was the length of time for cooking.

I must say that I truly thought this was a flop... at first.  I beat and beat and beat and never got the eggs as stiff as I thought they should be.  My bowl looked full of a white slimy mess and I expected to have only "meringue puddles" as someone had posted in an earlier review.  BUT!! I spooned it into a ziplock bag, snipped a corner, and piped them onto parchment and they surprisingly stood up as they should and came out perfectly!  So don't give up too soon... and definitely PIPE the meringues, don't use a spoon.

These are the best! The confectioner's sugar is really the key, IMO. Remember, room temp egg whites whip up fluffy. My oven runs hot so I turned the temp to 175 degrees and let them cook for three hours, well, kind of, I kept sneaking one here and there just to test, of course.

These were melt in your mouth good.   I did two modification to the original recipe. I added one vanilla bean (about 4 inches long) and one cup of toasted coconut flakes. Added the vanilla when it reached soft peaks and then folded the coconut in.   Unfortunately, the coconut clogged my piping tip, so piped them without the tip.   My husband loved the melt in your mouth and then chewy coconut. It was a hit!

The key ingredient for this cookie is something called "Patience!!"  My husband loves schaum torts aka - Meringue cookies.  I have been searching for quite some time for a good recipe.  I made the first batch and they were flat and tasteless..Since I am determined - I made them again using my stand mixer and just let them mix FOREVER!! I think in all - it was close to 30 minutes.  First let the eggs reach a stiff peak...then gradually add the sugar...once it is all added - WALK AWAY!!! I actually had to tend to a sick baby - and this worked out prefectly! The batter was thick and stiff when I returned. I piped half of them and just did gobs of the remaining.  I put them in my convection at 185 degrees (I can't open the door as the fan will stop working)..They did not crack and they look very pretty - I colored them with red food color paste for Christmas! Good luck and remember - PATIENCE!!! I can't give it 5 stars because of the amount of TIME it takes for these - but my husband believes they are worth it!!! Maybe he should make them next time:-))

Incase this wasn't suggested, use unsweetened kool-aid to flavor the meringues.  It cuts down on the sweetness and doesn't add any liquid to the recipe. Try raspberry flavor and add mini chocolate chips.  I heard yesterday on Martha Stewart's show there is also  powdered vanilla that can be used.  And please, stop whining about it tasting too sweet, what did you expect egg whites and sugar to taste like?

you can also try melting the sugar and eggs together first by dunking the bowl into hot water and whisking for 15 seconds. this speeds up the process of reaching the firm peak stage and also cuts out the need to stand next to it for 100 billion hours pouring in the sugar

I had left-over egg whites and decided to give these a try.  I did bake at 185 for 3 hours and They turned out pretty good.

I did two sheets, one on the cookie sheet buttered and floured and the other on parchement paper on a cookie sheet. Unless it was a coincidence, the ones on the parchement paper were soft inside still but those on the cookie sheet came out perfectly.  I did add some extract and maybe should have added extra sugar based on a what a reviewer mentioned before.
  
Whenever I have left-over egg white I will be doing these again.

Ohmigosh....I just made these and while I worried that I didn't beat them enough or too much, they turned out AWESOME!

Andes sells their mints in a "chip" form and I bought both the (original) creme de menthe and what appears to be new - peppermint.  I tinted them greean and red accordingly and not only are they delicious they are gorgeous!  I found these mints at a WalMart SuperCenter...only place I have ever seen them!!  YUMMMM!!!!!  Can't wait to add them to cookie trays!!

Made these tonite and they are melt-in-your-mouth.  Made them a little larger than i usually would as they are going to be the tops of mushrooms for the Yule Log.  Smaller, pop in your mouth size would be a better size, i imagine.  Instead of using a pastry bag i dropped them by regular size spoonfuls (table spoon, not Tbs.)  Will definitely use this recipe again.

These turned out quite well.  It was the first time I had made these so I wish there had been more instruction on how big to make them, though.  Some of mine cracked, but I think I did not whip them long enough before piping.  I think that must have been what i did wrong, because I used a swirl tip and they came out smooth.  Those little guys are addictive, though! :)

I used 2 cups of sugar instead of 2 1/4 cups according to my preference, and I did without the wooden spoon, but I baked it for 30 minutes less, at 100 degrees C. They turned out great, and they melt in your mouth so nicely!

These cookies were amazing. They came out very light and melted into a creamy texture in your mouth. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla while beating which improved the flavor.

These are some of the best meringues I have ever had! They're light, fluffy, and chewy. :) If anything tho, I'd cut down on the sugar a little since mine also oozed brown sugar syrup, making them hard to remove. Parchment paper will do the trick though, I'll just have to keep that in mind next time. I also added some vanilla extract and to another batch some lemon zest. They were just too good, crispy on the outside, marshmallowy and fluffy on the inside, and they just melt.in.your.mouth. Bringing the egg whites to room temp. will help speed up the whipping process. Try it, they're well worth the effort!

This was my very first try at meringues and they were PERFECT!, light and airy crispy better than storebought...I feel like such a pro. I let the eggs get to room temp as suggested and I put my glass bowl and beaters in the freezer for about ten minutes or so and this really made things speedy.

This is a good recipe, but it takes too long. I have an alternate one, which increase the temperature to 300F (150C), and bake it for 25 mins. They come out fine and nice, and less time is needed.

I also tried adding finely chopped chocolates into them, they are so yummy

I'm pretty stingy with 5 stars, but these's meringues deserve it. Followed the recipe exactly and loved the results. These cookies are better than what I envisioned a meringue cookie to taste like, simple and delicous.

This is a real good recipe and simple.  I make these for Christmas for a friend that loves meringue cookies.  We call them AIR.  The only thing I added is 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cream of tarter to help the whites keep their stiffness.  Makes alot.  Thanks a bunch!

I tried this recipe, but they didn't turn out like I'd hoped. I don't know if I didn't cook them long enough or not mix them long enough, but after the 3 hrs of baking time, I had meringues that were firm on the bottom, but marshmallowy on the top. Any suggestions? I do want to try them again.

I used this recipe and feel that there is WAY too much sugar in it. If one breaks it down, per 1 egg white is over 1/2 cup of sugar!! I would reduce it by at least half. I recommend that once the egg whites "peak", add a spoonful at a time and keep tasting it. That way you won't over sugar it.

I know I'm in the minority with this low rating but I hated the taste.  Perhaps it was the confectioners sugar because most all other meringue recipes calls for regular white sugar and they taste much better in my opinion.

I have tried to make meringues many times and they always failed.  I followed this recipe and they turned out perfect for the first time!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and increased the sugar to 2 cups. I also baked them on 185 and kept the oven closed.  I left them in the oven for nearly an hour after the 3 hours baking time.

I suppose altering the recipe affects the authenticity, but if you're mainly looking for versatility, this recipe offers much of that too.  Rather than the full amount of confectioner's sugar, I dumped a package of jello mix into the measuring cup and filled the remainder with confectioner's sugar.  Results were great, offering endless flavor combinations.  I may even try it with a pudding mix next to see if I get the same results for another easy fix.  Will update.

I love this recipe! I used meringue powder instead of egg whites. ( 2 tsp meringue powder + 2 tbsp water = 1 egg white ) I mixed it until it was foamy and added the powdered sugar. Then i added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and almond extract and mixed it on high until it formed hard peaks. I used a frosting extruder to pipe them. I am baking them on a baking sheet with a silicon baking mat on top instead of greasing the pan. They aren't sticking at all and they are nice and white, not browned on the bottom even! they are in the oven right now but almost done, I took a few samples during mixing and baking and they are delicious! ( the good thing about using meringue powder instead of egg is you can sample it as you mix!!) Defiantly making these again!

Very good, but would have been better with some type of flavoring - cocoa powder or almond extract or something. I will make these again the next time I have a recipe that just calls for the yolks.

Wonderful! I added a little red food dye and some raspberry extract to mine. I don't like biting into meringues. I guess I'm strange but it always sounds kinda squeeky and gives me goose bumps. So I made mine the size of dimes. Took less than half the time to cook and after doing the math they're only about 2.45 calories a piece :D what a great treat!

These are incredible! Exactly what I was looking for. I left my oven closed on 185, as I have gas and didn't feel comfortable propping it open.  They came out perfect! Everyone loved them.  They'd make great ghosts for halloween with maybe dabs of chocolate for the eyes!

I made these for Valentines Day and added in a little lemon extract and a few drops of red food coloring. I then made them into heart shapes. Adding a bit of cream of tartar will help with those whites. Thank you Randy!

A tasty recipe. Be sure not to use a large mixing bowl. Use a small one that ensures your mixer can whip the eggs & sugar thoroughly; otherwise it won't thicken properly.

These had a great flavor, but I think I messed up because the texture of parts of them were chewy.  I whipped and whipped, but the egg whites never seemed to get stiff enough.  Maybe I should have let them come to room temp first.  They were too goopy to pipe out, so I just plopped down big globs.  They baked up really nice anyway- I want to try again so I can improve.

OMG! These are so good. i ate them all myself! (well not in 1 day of course haha!). I used butter for greasing the dish, i shouldnt have cause it absorbed inside the meringue causing bubbles and stuff.. Although it had a buttery flavor after that.

Gave it a 5 without making it yet because it sounds perfect.  Just wanted to tell you that meringes should not be made on a rainy or humid day -- they just have the marshmellow inside because they don't dry out.  Thought this might help.  It's like you can't make divinity turn out unless it is a dry day.  Thanks for the other comments on adding flavoring.  I will definitely try this soon.

When I made the first batch of these, they didn't come out... so I looked at the reviews and ended up adding more sugar and about a cup of cocoa powder. They came out really well after that. I will make these again, I'm really looking forward to trying different things so I can make them different flvors since I'm not a big chocolate fan. (:

I made the recipe with all the sugar and did not think the were too sweet. I also added food coloring and extracts yellow/pineapple,pink/strawberry,and green/mint. A big hit at our carroling party. I will make them again

Tried today for the first time on a humid slightly showery day in Seattle, and it is so simple I can't see why anyone would have a problem. Just beat the whites until stiff before you add the sugar, a little at a time, add a spot of vanilla extract along the way, and dollop them onto parchment-covered cookie sheet. I just dolloped them because I like them that way, and my husband who doesn't like the store-bought ones came back for more, so what can you say? I baked them long enough to get a little carmel-y effect.

OMG!!!!!  I have always wanted to make these. I was a bit afraid but went for it. I am so glad that I did! I added a bit of red food coloring and a drop of vanilla then added a bit more sugar. Great!!! I dropped mine from a spoon and gave them all a curly Q. Thanks to everyone on this page for your hints! Merry Christmas! I will be making more tomorrow. They just melt in your mouth. Magic!

This is one of the first recipes I've ever learned since it's easy, doesn't require a lot of ingredients, and yummy to eat.  For those who have problems with the meringue firming up, it's because it hasn't been beaten enough.  Though for some people it may happen after 15 minutes, depending on what you use and what you put into the meringue, it can take even longer, I know mine went to around 20-30 minutes when I was making pavlova.  You'll know when it's ready when it starts forming stiff peaks.  If the 15 minute mark has passed and it's still soupy, keep beating.  Over beating is probably better than under beating it.  For a crisp outside, you actually don't need that much sugar.  Halving the amount can also make a good meringue.  It's also important to -not- have any of the yolk in the whites.  Otherwise, they won't rise properly.  The most important things in making meringues is 1. patience and 2. following all the steps.

If the meringues burn, then it's because you have the oven too hot or you made them too small.  If they're too big, they'll crack as they cool.  If the meringues come out soft, then it's probably because the sugar content is too low to form a crisp crust.  If you find them tasteless, you can add flavoring, like vanilla extract or lemon zest.

I feel like most of the reasons why people gave bad reviews was because they aren't patient enough to wait until the egg whites become stiff and satiny (15 minutes +) or they had residual egg yolk in the whites.

My first go at this recipe wasn't good.  I did research on the best way to beat egg whites.  I had my stainless steel bowl, room temp egg whites.. making sure nothing was in them.  The only thing that may have happened is that maybe I started adding the sugar too soon? The directions say to add it after they get foamy.. which I DID. But my egg whites never got stiff.  It looked like runny marshmallow fluff.  Maybe I should have waited till the egg whites were stiff before I started adding it???? Idk!  I hate wasting ingredients so I puddled it on a pan and shoved it in the oven!  We will see what happens.... -_-.  I may try again, but add the sugar AFTER the egg whites have peaked.  Wish the recipe would clarify that!!

Made these for my fiance who had never had meringues before, and they turned out great! You have to whip the egg whites and sugar for a long time, though, but it's worth it. Next time I'll try it with a touch of vanilla extract and nutmeg and see how that turns out. I didn't have a pastry bag, but I just cut an opening on a plastic sandwich bag and it worked great. These go great with tea or coffee.

My picky 10 year old asked me for meringues and I couldn't believe I got this one on the first shot!  The second time I ran out of sugar and only used 2 cups BUT they were even better then the first! Next time I will use vanilla or peppermint flavor. Also, I like using sprinkles on top and meringues can make very nice cake decorations.

This recipe didn't work for me. I let them in the oven for just 20 minutes and they were ENTIRELY burned! I thought it was a bit odd to leave them for 3 hours, but I didn't expect them to get burned after 20 MINUTES! So the next batch I only let it bake for 10 minutes, so it didn't get burned, but some other weird thing happened... they puffed instantly, turned doughnut-like and kept growing until I got them out. Then they flattened almost immediately and there was pretty much nothing left of the inside.

Great recipe. A keeper. Use parchment paper on your baking sheets. Steer clear of any butter or shortening because fats will break down the egg whites. Completely fat free bowls & pans, and beating the egg whites thoroughly before adding the sugar GRADUALLY will solve the problem of "sinking" or "melting" cookies. I'm going to make another bath, trying the suggestion someone made of using Jello mix.  Plan to put that in my measuring cup first, then add sugar until I get a total of 2 1/4 cups.

Very good and easy to make, it just takes time. I didn't have a pastry bag, so I used a ziplog bag and I cut a small piece of the corner off one side. Worked great! :)

they tasted really good, but I only cooked them for an hour and half, and they were still flat and crunchy:( I dipped half of each one in chocolate, and added food coloring to some to mix it up.

These are great!!!!  I love meringues and these are so much better than store-bought, no cream of tartar after-taste.  I had a little trouble with the temperature of the oven, keeping the door ajar with a gas stove isn't really an option.  I put the oven at about 175 and kept the door closed.  There was some minor cracking but it was only cosmetic.  The taste is fantastic, melt in your mouth with a little chewiness  in the center.  Use parchment paper for no cleanup and they peel right off.  Also let the egg whites come to room temperature before beating and you shouldn't have any problem.  I've made these twice now and I make them a little bigger and get about 15 meringues from this recipe and they don't last long!

I'm not sure what went wrong. I followed the recipe to a t! Never got stiff, piped out round. I even tried adding more sugar to no avail. No pretty stars. Maybe they will be sutible for macroons, when they finish I hope.

These cookies remind me of the meringues that I was able to purchase at our neighborhood Publix in Florida.  They are fairly easy to make and have become a favorite cookie of a friend's child who must eat gluten-free items.

I've made meringues using this recipe 3 times now. They always come out perfect! My rating is based off of the first 2 times I made them, which is by the exact directions. This third time, I did add a little cream of tartar because I feel like I was having a stiffening problem because of the vanilla extract I added. So the rating is based on the recipe, the review is to tell you how I made them better (of course; it wouldn't be allrecipes.com if someone wasn't putting their 2 cents in!) I eyeballed the ingredients I added, so don't take it too literally. I added: 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp cream of tartar, an extra 1-2 TBSP confectioner's sugar. Once I had stiff peaks, I folded in 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips, and 8 miniature candy canes; crushed (add 2/3 of the candy canes to the mixture, save last 1/3 to sprinkle on top). Let me tell you: THESE are the best meringues I've ever had! But you may want to play with the cooking times and temp if you make it this way. Even leaving the oven door ajar, I had some that cracked... I think this way because of the candy canes--because they got so hot, they started bubbling. Bubbling candy canes look neat and are fun to pop.. but not very visually appealing on top of the cookie LOL. But, seriously, try it out. This version is going to be a definite repeat every Christmas.

Normally, in any recipe I use, I always decrease the sugar called for, but after reading the reviews carefully, I added the full amount. Wow! They are so completely sugary that it's a bit overwhelming. I think adding some vanilla would've balanced them out a bit and made them perfect. I don't imagine these will fly off the cookie tray. Also, I had 2 cookie sheets full of meringues. Used parchment paper to avoid buttering and flouring the sheets.

I've tried many recipes from here but never have i been SO HAPPY with a recipe. The recipe was perfect. I was being little impatient with 3 hours of baking time but it was worth it. Not only it tastes great, but also looks so beautiful!! It's just so white that its just a pleasure to look at it! Thanks for the recipe!! 
And I tried to meringues recipe before which needed only 15 minutes baking. now i know the DIFFERENCE.. thanks again!!

I think that I didn't mix it long enough because mine came out flat. They also cracked while they were in the oven. Next time that I have left-over egg whites from another recipe, I'll try this recipe again and add some cream of tartar to help keep them stiff. And also some sort of flavoring since by themselves they seem way to sweet.

Absolutely awesome.  I made these for a tea party.  I added some vanilla extract, and as a result had to beat them for quite a bit longer.  They were delicious days afterwards, but got a little bit chewy in the center when our weather turned to rainstorms and the cookeis weren't in airtight storage.  

I piped them out, and the consistency was perfect.  Next time I will try to fold in some chips for additional flavors.

Ok, I definitely did not whip the eggs and sugar long enough because my meringues came out really flat. Tasty still, but not as good as I imagine they were supposed to be. If you already put the mixture onto your pan and they look like flat little circles, just bake them for about 30 minutes and you'll have flat cookie-like meringues. Next time I'll beat my eggs and sugar for 15 minutes or so.

These were great I had 5 egg whites to use up and I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon so I upped the sugar by a cup.  I also followed a previous reviewers suggestion because I have a convection oven and propping the door turns off the fan.  Closed door baked at 185 for 2 hours but I had to leave the house so I left them in the oven at 170 for 3 more hours and they still turned out perfect! THANKS

They are ok.  Make sure to beat the mixture for a long long time in order for the cookies to hold some shape- otherwise you would get flat disks.  2nd time:  Don't "piecemeal" pipe the meringues.  I wanted to have a nice top so piped a swirl on top of "blobs".  The disconnect between the blob and swirls ended up crystallizing - which could be cool if you want a "volcanic meringue" type of look. :)

Very easy to make. I only used 1 3/4 cups of sugar, added unsweetened cocoa while beating in the sugar, and I folded in about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips before dropping onto the cookie sheets (i don't have a pastry bag :-) Too bad these take so long to bake because I COULD eat them every day :-)  Thank you for this recipe Randy.

I did try this recipe and it was really really good. I add 1 and 1/2 tsp of almond essence and use parchement paper. Bake at 175F closed dooor oven for 2 hours and it was good.  you don't see any speck of brown.  It was pure white and melt in your mouth.  The sugar part. I only put 2 cups and it was perfect.  2 cups of Confectioner sugar (or icing sugar) is not the same amount as 2 cups granulated sugar.  I will make it again and put some color in it :-)

Made these just yesterday and they turned out perfect!! I added a touch of vanilla to the mixture and that really upped the yumminess!! Gorgeous consistency and sooo tasty!! This is a keeper.
**And for those who live at altitude (I live at 5600 feet), this recipe works just fine. I never had to use cream of tartar or any other add ins to supplement the consistency of this recipe.

I've done the others have suggested:  Eggs at room temp, clean bowl with vinegar wipe, added 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and 1 tsp flavoring, but if you do this, up the sugar 1/2 c. 

Warning, be careful how much mint flavoring, I added too much once and they made our eyes water... they were good, just STRONG ;p

This recipe was a disaster.  It fails to accurately describe the state the whites should be in before you add the sugar.  'Foamy' is inaccurate and led to a waste of my eggs and time.  The whites should be whipped until they form stiff peaks.  Otherwise you end up with a runny mess.

Made for a birthday party, in three color - flavor combinations: green mint, yellow lemon, and white vanilla.  I had 5 egg whites, so I adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly. Prepared the recipe then divided it and colored and flavored it. Piped the cookies with a star tip into 1.5" to 2" cookies on parchment. Made about 100 cookies.  Green and yellow did not pipe as well, no doubt due to additional liquid from the flavoring. Not sure how to fix that but may add additional sugar to batches I intend to color / flavor. The few leftovers stored well in airtight container at room temperature for several weeks - until I remembered they were there. Then gone! :-)

I'm not really clear on the consistency of the finished product after beating and adding the sugar but mine came out like marshmellow cream. I was still able to pipe them onto a cookie sheet and they held their form well. I baked at 250 for 90 min and they came out perfect after letting them cool in the oven with door slightly open. But boy were they sweet! They had that strong powdered sugar taste even though I had folded 1 tsp coconut extract into the batter and dusted them with cocoa powder prior to baking. I really couldn't even taste the coconut flavor over the powdered sugar taste. Maybe I will try it with less sugar next time.

Turned out great! However, make sure you check periodically. I waited to check them until they'd been in for 2 hours, and they were more 'done' than I like (I prefer a chewy center). I have an oven thermometer and I propped the door, so I'm pretty sure the temp was right.

I am not a meringue fan, but I had a lot of egg whites, so I tried out this recipe, and the meringues did turn out perfect. My only suggestion is not to add peppermint extract, because you end up feeling like you're eating dried toothpaste. I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I still don't like meringues.

Really sweet and delicious recipe. For the reviewers that said that theirs did not set up: You need to beat the eggs and sugar more. I beat mine for probably 10 minutes and they turned out beautiful. I did have to cook mine a little longer than the recipe stated. After 3 hours they were still very wet inside so I closed the oven door and kept cooking them for about 40 more minutes. It was very cool in my house today (about 50 degrees), so that may have had something to do with them not being done in 3 hours; since the oven door was cracked open.

I had some meringues at my friends house and loved them at first bite. I was determined to make meringues so I kept looking and finally found this (I always use this site for recipes and searched the first time, didnt find it, then after 3 more days tried again and found it) I got discouraged and.....using my rage as help, finally got the egg whites and lots of powdered sugar(I think I used 3 cups) got the cookies to hit the soft peak stage. I piped them out in rosette formations. I put them on a cookie sheet, buttered and floured, and put them in the oven at 185 degrees, without the door open. I was not sure how to test they were done, because they were crispy after and hour and a half, so I ate one.....I ended up eating most of the batch by the time they were done! Very, very good.....I am just wondering three things. A.) Should I use oil-based extracts? B.) How do I test if they are done(Other than eating...they slid off even when they werent crispy) C.) How would I make these chocolate WHILE still being able to pipe them out? I would love to make Chocolate Chip meringues with regular base, and dip some of them in liquid ganache for my aunt's wedding.

Amazingly easy!  I have always loved meringue cookies but have been intimidated by them.  I tried this recipe (exactly as it was posted!) and they turned out great.  The only bad (?) thing was that I was pretty much the only one in my family that ate them - everyone else forgot they were (hiding) on the counter.  Guess I should have put them on the table or buffet instead of in the corner of the counter.

Love these! :)  I added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and could have added more for additional flavor.  I also used the recommendation made by Caron for gas stoves to change temp to 185 and leave the oven door closed.  Leaving it open just for the first 5 minutes made the house smell like gas.  But the meringues turned out crisp and delicious!

So easy, reviewers are spot-on in advice as well.  I increased the sugar to 2 1/2c as I added a teaspoon of almond extract.  Perfectly subtle almond essence, and paired with amaretto chocolate chip gelato.  Heaven!

Perfection.  Only took two hours.  Used parchment paper on top of inverted baking pans (cookie sheets lent to a friend!)  They are light and sweet.  No need for any additional vanilla or almond as some suggested.  Only problem is, I was supposed to bring them to a BBQ tomorrow - and now I have to make more in the morning because they are slowly disappearing!!!  Great recipe.

These are absolutely fabulous!  The first batch I made, I screwed up by not whipping the egg whites enough before adding the sugar. They turned out super sugary and flat.  Overachiever that I am, I sifted the sugar for the second batch and added that to the egg whites (I beat the egg whites until they were solid white and kind of stiff, similar to what Ashton suggested).  This seemed to make all the difference as they turned out very light and fluffy the second time around.  I baked them at 200 for an hour and dropped the temp to 185. These tasted like toasted marshmallows so I may try dipping them in chocolate and sprinkling them with graham cracker crumbs as an ode to a s'more.  Great recipe!

This recipe is incredible! my mom used to make meringues or as we would call them kisses for Christmas and these reminded me of them! I also added mini chocolate chips to the mix however I think they may have exploded or ran a bit because my meringues had bubbly spots where it looked a bit carmelized.  (but still tasted yummy) Anyone have any input on how to stop that??

Very nice. Exactly the same as those expensive boxed meringues. I did exactly what Allison125's review indicated- I beat the eggs and sugar for a loooong time. I also added the seeds from a vanilla bean- my DH loved them. Also, I only baked mine at 200 for 2 hours with a wooden spoon handle cracking open the oven door. The center became completely crispy overnight. Thank you for this professional,impressive and economical recipe!

I'm rating these a five because it is a great meringue recipe...if you like meringues.  I only tried this recipe to use up egg whites that I had left over from making crepes in the morning.  They turned out nice and shiny and everything you would want in a meringue, again...if you like meringues.  *I broke up some of them with the flat side of a meat mallet and used them to top hot chocolate.

This recipe comes out perfect everytime! It does take awhile to get the shiny firm peaks (almost 35-45 minutes in stand mixer) (just be careful the mixer doesnt over heat, and do not use a hand mixer because you will be there mixing forever!) and it helps alot if the egg whites are at room temp. Also I reccomend do not double recipe. The consistency does not work. So I just make seperate batches according to the recipe measurements. But this recipe is the best I've tried so far! Thanks!!

It took me three attempts to get this recipe right, and it was well worth it!  They came out okay the first time, flat the 2nd and perfect the third. (so good the dog stole them off the counter!)  Make sure you whip the egg whites until they are really foamy. (i think that is the key point)  I added my extract to them at that time.  I kept my mixer on top speed and moved it to medium only to add the sugar then kicked it back up and let it run for ten minutes.  It should be about the consistency of whipped cream.  Some of this info would be good to know in the recipe so we didn't have to experiment.  But it was worth it.  I still put the little flat ones in my cookie bags for x-mas as wafers!

These are the best tasting Meringues that I've ever had!  Awesome recipe!!  One question, my meringues cracked and I don't know why as I followed the recipe to a tee.  It doesn't matter to me that they cracked just wonder as to why this happened.  Thanks for sharing!!!

These were just okay. I added cocoa to about 1/2 the recipe and they were a little bitter. The taste of powdered sugar was just overpowering. I'll stick to making them with bakers sugar.

I used powdered sugar.  I also used a box of strawberry Jell-o for flavor and coloring.  I added the sugar a little bit at a time, and only wound up using the packet of Jell-o plus 1 1/2 cups sugar.

I piped them into pink ribbons for a Breast Cancer potluck at work, and they were a huge hit.  Everyone loved the texture, crispness, and flavor.  Most of the pieces cracked, but this was my first attempt at meringues so I'll figure it out I'm sure.

Turned out perfectly.  I used a gallon plastic bag to pipe out the meringues.  The meringues looked darling and totally professional!  Next time I will try adding chocolate chips.

very good, but such a hassle to make! i had to beat the egg whites for over half an hour until i got stiff peaks and the cookies took 2 and a half hours to bake. but when they came out, they were delicious. i got a few complaints though, that they were too plain. next time i'll fold in some chocolate chips. i'll make again if i ever have a few hours to spare.

Super easy recipe and my wife loves them. I am having an issue with cracking and weeping though so something is lost on presentation. Possibly something is wrong with my technique, I wipe the bowl with vinegar to ensure no oils in the bowl and dry the bowl, add the whites and whip with kitchenaid speed 7 for maybe 7 mins. Then add powdered sugar in 1 tsp increments about once a minute until all sugar is gone. After that its in the oven for 3 hours with the door cracked open @ 200F. Every time so far they have cracked in the oven while cooking / drying. If anyone sees a mistake in my process please email Jakaround@aol.com, I'd appreciate the help. No matter what I will continue making these because they are great.

I had a bunch of egg whites left over from making pasta dough and I stumbled across this recipe and decided I had nothing to lose. I didn't have berry sugar or confectioner's sugar so I forged ahead with regular granulated sugar which I didn't even measure that carefully. I like trying things the old fashioned way so I beat the egg whites by hand with a whisk for about 10 minutes. The egg whites won. I switched to a hand-crank beater and after reviewing the recipe for the 10th time  I thought "satin" was a lie designed to destroy my sense of self worth. Then I remembered this recipe is authentic French, which is designed to destroy one's sense of self worth,  so I persevered for another few minutes and lo and behold, I achieve a satin consistency that held its shape. Believing I could never reach this moment I had not prepared a piping bag (truth be told I do not own a piping bag) so I took a tablespoon and dropped the foamy morsels using the same twirling technique used for honey or pasta. My kid said, "they look like white hershey kisses" so I was pretty sure they would not be a complete disaster. Due to impatience we tested after 1 hour (don't bother) 2 hours (if you are going to serve these right away, imagine an egg shell full of sugared whipped cream -- that's how good they are), and 3 hours (yep that's what they're supposed to be like). Result: everybody orgasming over the best  meringues they've ever had. Next time: I want to try a dash of vanilla or some food colouri

Made these for a ladies group meeting. They were a hit and so easy. Followed one of the hints and made sure the egg whites were at room temp before beating them. Turned out perfectly. The gals wanted to take the extras home.

Great recipe.  I added a touch of clear vanilla and 1/4 tsp. of cream of tartar.  Meringues were perfect, light, crispy but not hard.  I'm going to try using this recipe for individual pavlovas with a little raspberry flavouring and lots of fresh fruit.

Thanks for all the suggestions in the ratings. I love meringues, and have never been able to bake them successfully before. This works. I agree with waiting a while to add the confectioner's sugar. I added mine a bit too early, (when foamy, not stiff) and I had to beat for 30 minutes before I could pipe them onto the cookie sheet. My "room temperature" also happened to be about 55 degrees F. Parchment paper works. I used a baking method that I had heard of: I warmed the oven up to 200 degrees F, baked about 10 minutes with the door closed, turned off the oven, and went to bed. The smaller ones were done perfectly; the larger ones were softer in the middle than I wanted, so I turned the oven back on to 200 for about 10 minutes, turned it off again and taste-tested until they were perfect.  Thank you to RandyVH and the reviewers.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night and for some reason they did not turn out as expected. I added a photo of what the final product looks like. Can someone please give me some insight as to what error I made?

Try it with a hint of peppermint (1/2 tsp), vanilla (1 tsp) and lemon (1/2 tsp). Plus add 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar to make up for the liquid.

The recipe is fine, but they left out CREAM OF TARTER, not sure why they did that, but without it i think   1/4 teaspoon would be fine, may be wrong. It won't set up like it should..... the recipe they have is for marshmallows

I added about a third tsp of cream of tarter to help with stability, and I cut the sugar back by a third.  Perfect technique description!  They needed a bit longer to bake, but that could be my oven.  I left them in to cool overnight, and lovely.  Next time a drop of lemon extract. . .

I made a few changes, and these turned out perfect!! I did use boxed egg whites and used 2/3 cup to equal the 4 egg whites. Because I forgot to bring the egg whites to room temperature, it took much longer to get my meringue to stiff peaks--20 minutes or more. I just whipped them until the meringue stood straight up when I pulled the beater off and turned it over. I piped out 2" circle baskets/nests on parchment and baked them at 185, not using the wooden spoon trick, and shut off the oven at three hours and allowed the meringues to stay in the oven overnight. They are being filled with a yummy homemade Meyer Lemon Curd for a party.

For people having trouble--meringues are a tricky business. If the weather is humid--forget it! If you get a tiny speck of yolk in your whites--forget it!! If you have residual grease on your bowl or beater--forget it!! Don't give up! These are SO worth it!!

Never had an issue with this recipe! It is a hard, cookie like meringue and they always turn out great. You can add food colouring and flavours to mix it up! For Xmas I like strips of red colour and peppermint flavour.

These are perfect. Better than the ones I had in Italy. Hint: never use a plastic bowl when whipping whites it can hold oils that interfere with the whipping. I tried the spoon idea and my oven shut off so had to bake at 185 and it worked fine.

I used this recipe for my first ever attempt at meringues and it was fantastic! My only mistake was adding the sugar too early. If you're a first timer, I recommend watching the short video that shows how these are made first. I also agree with all of the comments that you have to beat the mixture a LONG time before you get stiff peaks. During the last hour of baking, I checked two or three times to remove any meringues that lifted easily off the baking sheets as mine were not even in size. I will definitely make this recipe again - delicious!

For a person who knows nothing about meringues, these came out great! At first I thought I added the sugar too early but after a while with the sugar whipping, I decides to pipe them anyway and they came out perfect. Ferm and the perfect texture! I will definitely make them again! Making them for valentines day, I hope everyone loves them! Great gifts! Thanks for the recipe. : )

I added 1/8 teaspoon vanilla and a little extra sugar. The first batch cracked and oozed a bubbly syrup. The next just cracked a little since I reduced the oven temp. to start 'um out. Mine were done in 2hr and 15min. I also found that parchment paper worked well.

Second try with this recipe - turned out great this go around.  The first try was a runny mess.  I think I know what went wrong the first time and did the opposite this time - it worked!  I cut the recipe in half, but added a tad more sugar. Very tasty and went down a treat.

My mom use to buy these when I was a kid and I was happy to find out I could make them. I use white sugar in these from now on though, the first time I made these with powdered sugar they were a little too crunchy and sweet tasting. Oh and rainy days do actually effect these I have found out so make on a decent-ish day. If you don't have a copper bowl use a little over 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar after they start to foam IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE!! I add vanilla in mine. OH, and I don't like the idea of having a spoon hold open my oven (that's actually bad for it) so I turn the heat up a bit and cook them for an hour and they turn out great! For Halloween I made these orange and drizzle semi-sweet melted chocolate over them, they looked great and taste really good! I have made these a lot, they are so easy and good to make when you run out of ingredients but want something sweet. You can pop a lot of these babies onto one baking pan, I like that. I even halved the recipe and made loads. They go quick around here. I LOVE THESE! You don't feel bad about eating a bunch either, just tell yourself they are essentially air, but really good air. And HEY THESE ARE CHEEP TO MAKE! Go for it.

Light, crisp, and sweet.  Perfect meringues.  Mine got a little too hot and "bubbled out" a little, so I think I'll turn the temp down to 185, as suggested by another reviewer.  Super easy!

Excellent recipe.  I have made these three times now and the family loves them.  For variation, I have added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and to account for the 7000 ft in elvation for our home,  I have added 1/4 tsp cream of tartar. This recipe works every time.  The last time I made these, I did reduce the amount of sugar to 2 cups and I think I like them better that way.

These were great! I didn't want to make quite that many, so I used 3 egg whites and 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar. I also added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon juice. I think my oven runs a little cold, so I set it to 200 and baked them for 2 hours, then turned it off and left them in the oven to cool for another hour. They turned out perfect! :)

I could not get the meringue to be thick enough even after 1/2 hour of beating it. I tried added more sugar but that didn't help either. There was no way I could have piped it so I just dropped teaspoons of it. I also folded in chocolate chips to 1/2 of it. I baked it for 2 hours and 45 minutes.  They don't look like they should. They're flat like cookies however they taste great. I think I'll add some cream of tartar next time to help. It seems I had used another recipe to make these in the past and it called for cream of tarter.

Very easy to make - love them.  
I would recommend removing stove knobs (if on front of stove) before baking these, 200 degrees for 3 hours makes them very hot.

These were GREAT! I loved them, they were so easy to make and still tasted amazing. I did make a few changes though. I absolutly love chocolate so i added cocoa to taste. I also only cooked them for an hour and a half. This made them more chewy in the middle but not too much.

Fantastic! I've been trying to master the meringues for a decade. Back in Europe they were my favorite cookie, but we called it kisses. This recipe recreated the perfectly swirled peaks, my kids and I can't get enough of them.

Very, very yummy.  They taste just like the storebought gourmet ones.  The only problem I had with it is that it took a longgg time to beat, and also that when I finally took them out of the oven, some of them had cracked and had this funny bubbly texture, although the places where it was like that tasted just the same.  Anyway -- this is my go to recipe for hard meringues :]

I make these every Pesach holiday. I add shaved chocolate bits in before baking. They are light and fluffy. Does take a long time till they get stiff, but it's worth the effort.

These turned out for me following all the advice - mainly about leaving them in the oven overnight. I know that the amount of sugar was recommended to not be changed- but this was a little too sweet for me, and I love sweet stuff. So I might try to change these next time to be more to my test, and also maybe add flavoring. But I will definitely make these again.

I used the recipe exactly as it was but set the oven at 185 degrees, like somebody else suggested. I made mine on the smallish side, which cut down the cooking time to only an hour and a half. These were absolutely delicious and I'll be making them again this weekend as a present!!

MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH! I LOVE ALLRECIPES SITE--THE BEST COOKS ARE HERE-REVIEWERS ALWAYS SOOO HELPFUL TOO.  I MADE SEVERAL
DIFFERENT RECIPES THIS HOLIDAY SEASON, USING REGULAR SUGER, WHICH TURNED OUT FINE..SO TESTED MY LUCK & TRIED THIS WITH THE CONFECTIONERS SUGAR. I FOUND IT DID TAKE FEW MORE MINUTES OF WHIPPING, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MATTER. (I added flavoring to the sugar before mixing-worked fine) THESE WERE THE LIGHTEST AND JUST MELTED IN THE MOUTH..WHILE I STILL LIKE THE OTHERS-THIS IS THE REAL THING!!EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY. I ALSO LIVE IN VERY HIGH HUMIDITY AREA AND NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM. THANKS SO MUCH RANDY FOR SHARING %)

I made the meringue twice and both times the meringue bubbled out some brownish liquid (probably the sugar) that eventually crisped up.  The meringue was still very delicious, but the brown bubbles are a bit unsightly.  Anyone know why that happened??

I dipped the meringue in chocolate to cover up the bubbles which worked really well!  I still like this recipe very much though!

Very Very easy to make. I did leave the eggs out for about an hour before i used them to get them to room temp like some people suggested. These are easy and beautiful! Great addition to your cookie try. Just make them a day before the rest of your cookies. Mine only took two hours though in the oven.

Just awesome.  I did use 1/8 tsp of tartar and 1/8 tsp of almond extract.  SO amazingly delicious.  I also love knowing their low calorie and practically guilt free!!!

Made these to give away as Christmas gifts.  My husband had never had meringues, and he was very reluctant to try them.  Well, he ended up eating half of them.  :)  I piped them, and they (most of them, anyway) were very pretty.  I used toasted coconut in half of the batch; I liked them, but my husband didn't.  Personally, I don't think I would pair these with chocolate.  The chocolate could easily overwhelm them.  If I have occasion to make them again, I might try finely chopped toasted nuts or bits of candied cherries.  If I did the cherries, I might add a little almond extract.  I'd better stop before I get too hungry.  :)  Thanks for the recipe, they were super!

I divided this recipe into parts and added vanilla and cocoa powder to two; both were delicious (though I think the original and vanilla meringues were the favorites). Really amazingly good.

My first time attempting meringue. They taste really good. However, it took a really long to whip them. Will try again with the suggestions of room temp eggs and chilled beaters/bowl. Any suggestions on how to make them so they don't crack would be helpful.

This recipe is foolproof. The most important is to bake slowly. It is actually not baking, it is drying the mixture.
Has anybody tried to whip the egg white in a coper dish? It is said to be nuch better because of a chemical reaction between the dish and the eggs.

Excellent!! and soooo simple. Can't believe I have to look it up every time I make them. I added coconut to them this time - in the oven now, but I'm sure they will be even better than the last 2 batches I made.  Yummmmmers!

These were absolutely fantastic.  I haven't been able to find a truly good meringue recipe or find a good one in the store/bakery that wasn't chewey.  These melt in your mouth.  I did end up leaving in the oven longer as they weren't completely dried out after the 3 hours.  Left the oven on for another 15 min and then just left them in for another 45 and they were perfect.

They're ok...great taste! But the texture is not-so-good, too crispy. Then i reduced the amount  of sugar, as people suggested, but they still didn't have the soft texture i was looking for. I used a piece of rolled-up paper instead of a pastry bag and made the end star-shaped. The batter just splooshed out, didn't have any indents. I've made other French Meringues, and they had semi-indents. And you should have seen my electricity bill after this! Sheesh. They only took 2 hours 20 minutes anyway. This is an ok recipe.

This is an excellent recipe for French Meringues and it ticks me off every time someone rates a recipe poorly because THEY did something wrong and can't understand why it got such high ratings because theirs didn't turn out. It's simple chemistry, you need to make sure that the mixing bowl you are using is completely grease free. Wipe it out with white vinegar or lemon juice and give it a rinse. Also, if there is even so much as a speck of yolk in the whites they will not set up at all! So if you can't get the speck of yolk out of your whites and think that it won't harm it, you are sadly mistaken and need to start all over. 

Don't give a poor rating because of your own shortcomings and shortcuts that didn't work please.

I made this exactly as directed and as another person stated, I couldn't get it past the marshmallow cream texture either. I had to whip more egg whites and try to add them to the cream  only to waste three more egg whites. 
I'll try another version because this tasted like dried powder sugar when it was baked!! Sorry but I wouldn't recommend this one.

This is a really good recipe for meringues. The whipping time for me was a little over 10 minutes with my stand mixer on 8. I had cracks on most of the meringues, most likely because I whipped them on too high a speed. Probably would have been better with mixing on 6 for a longer time to give me smaller air bubbles. I added a drop of red food color and 1/2 teaspoon almond flavor. This will be my go-to recipe for egg-based meringues.

This recipe is SUPER fun to make with my 6 year old daughter. We added our own toppings and fillers such as marshmallows, gummy bears and white chocolate chips. I’m so glad we experimented with toppings b/c honestly, the flavour of these as a stand alone meringue cookie is not very nice. It’s like eating a giant bag of icing sugar. I may as well pour a bag into  my mouth. This was a disappointment and confirmed my hesitation about making this recipe. It even overpowered the RUM extract I added. If you try adding more flavouring, you risk ruining the meringue. On a positive note, the texture of these little guys are awesome! It truly was super fun, but I think I’ll pass on this recipe and try making one I found that adds Jello for flavouring, plus jello adds beautiful COLOURS! I can’t wait!

Totally didn't work AT ALL. Made a horrible hoppy mess and dripped out of my piping bag immediately- would not recommend unless you want to drink horrible suggary soup. I tried baking it anyway and it turned out as expected- still horrible. NOT worth it at all!

This meringue was absolutely amazing! If you want the best meringue, when the meringue is super close to being done, DONT open the oven door and leave the meringues in the oven overnight with the oven OFF. This will trap the little bit of heat left and leave no cracks in the meringue. Highly recommend this recipe

Nope. Didn’t work. My Mom suggested that I save the recipe by adding 200 g coconut and make macaroons...that saved it...

These cookies are absolutely great! The reason why I only put 4 stars is because some altercations need to be made. 1, if you bake for 3 hours, the insides but be a little undercooked I didn’t notice and ate them. After, I had a little bellyache. I would recommend about 4-5 hours. Yes, it’s long but it would give you better cookies. Next, 2 and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar is a lot. To oz, that’s 18 oz. As of right now I just made a new batch with about 13 oz of the powdered sugar and it still tastes great, just less sugar. They are delectable and tasty.

the consistency worked out very well, but on a few where they ended up getting a little dry on the outside because I have a convection oven that will not run while the door is open. but it worked out for an hour and 40 min. at 175 in convection mode worked well, although it had a very soapy taste to it. so I think next time I will try using some flavor shots of any kind. thanks for the recipe.

I used baking paper instead of Pam and flour. And we also didn't leave the oven door open because we have a missing rubber around the door and it was perfectly fine this way too!

Tasted great! For a winter twist, I added crushed peppermint before baking and it turned out wonderful. This recipe works with regular sugar (instead of powdered) as well.

Yeah!! This is the 1st time I've ever made meringues. I was always intimidated but as a Christmas present I got a mixer that I've always wanted. I used the recipe exactly, added 1/4 tsp of raspberry flavoring in it.   Because of the humidity and conditions where I live I increase the temp to 200 but only did an hour and a 1/2. After they dried and cooled I used melted white chocolate and dipped the bottoms in and added sprinkles.

These are terribly easy to make. One caveat: don't try to use egg whites from a container. You must collect whites from fresh eggs.

I completely messed this recipe. I added way too much sugar.  So I put it in the fridge to chill, and then spread it over my pan.  It still turned out amazing! Simple yet fun, a must try.

These are the real deal. They came out perfectly and were thoroughly enjoyed by all. I've made them twice so far; once exactly as written and once with the addition of a teaspoon of vanilla. I plan to try different extracts such as lemon, orange, almond and anise in the future. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I found these way too sweet. Eating them is like dissolving a sugar cube on your tongue.  I added vanilla and that gave them a nice flavor. They had a lovely shine to them. Not sure if the recipe would work, but even half the sugar would be more than enough.

I made these for a pot luck dessert and at first they were too stiff and sugary, bit I dipped them in homemade chocolate hard-shell syrup and a day later they were more light and airy with a slight sugar crunch. ???????

Ive tried it, but im not sure if its because of the "high" humidity in here, my meringue did not stay "hard". Due to the low temperature baking, I was able to see the process as it goes. After awhile, the meringue turns rubbery/marshmellow-ish texture, and once i stop the heat and let it cool down, it hardens and could be easily peeled off. However, when i try to pack them/take them out of the oven, they turn into marshmellow mush. It is just like melted marshmellows. It frustrates me as it takes so long to get ready, and I've tried it once - in a day! I don't know what i did wrong, maybe its because i have to let it cool COMPLETELY in the oven before taking it out? If i left it in there for hours to cool, would it not have "melted" when i take them out to pack? How do i make it like its store-bought,  stays hard even after exposing to air ? Although i do have to admit it tastes alright, I taste tested it while it was cooling down , which is why i knew it hardened and is easy to take off the parchment paper.

These never got stiff enough to hold their shape. I even added extra confectioners sugar, and still had little disks instead of stars. They were done at just over an hour as well. I'm not sure where I went wrong. I will use a recipe that calls for cream of tarter next time. They tasted good, and my family is enjoying them for sure. However, this is not what I would expect in a meringue cookie.

These were delicious and melt in your mouth. We added a bit of peppermint extract and food colouring so added a little more sugar. Per other reviews I added Cream of Tartar as well.

I'm not sure is so highly rated - maybe because it was "French".  Or maybe the people had never had any better.  I love meringues, and make them well - I made these, ate one, and threw the rest  away.

Never tried a Meringue Cookie before.  I thought this would be a good idea since I have been focusing on French Macarons.  I tried it and I LOVED it!  I will definitely be making Meringue Cookies again sometime!

Thank You for the recipe RandyVH!

I made these for a party and everyone loved them. They are super easy and delicious. When you separate the eggs, be sure that you don't let ANY yolk get into the whites. If your yolk breaks and gets the slightest bit into your mixer, it won't work. My 5 speed handheld Kitchenaid mixer did not get it to stiff peaks so be sure to use a higher speed stand mixer with a whisk attachment.

WARNING!!!!!!
THis was my first time making meringues and i have no expirience. Make sure you don't make the mistake I did! Whip the mixture after adding the sugar until you can hold the bowl up side down without drips! I know this is an ameature mistake, but it's quite easy to make if you're just messing around!

I think I did something wrong. My eggs whipped up really nicely and quickly in a glass bowl that I cleaned with a little bit of white vinegar before hand. When I started seeing soft peaks I started adding my confectioner sugar. But then the peaks got stiff and glossy really quickly and I had only just started adding my confectioners sugar. As I continue to add more sugar it just ended up turning into a melted marshmallow consistency. They baked nicely even though they didn't keep their shape but all I tasted was sugar. Not sure what went wrong. Probably won't try this recipe again.

Fabulous! These are so pretty! I lined my pans with parchment paper Instead of flour and spray. 
Made according to directions but turned oven off after 2 hours and let sit till cool for another 2 hours. This helps prevent them from cooling too fast and cracking (sort of like cheesecake). 
Before baking I sprinkled tops with some crushed candy cane to make them festive for Christmas time.

Made mine chocolate chip meringues and dipped one side in melted chocolate. So good! Use 1 and 1/4 cups + 2 tbsp of confectioners sugar and 3/4 tsp cream of tartar. Beat these forever!!! Then fold in however many chocolate chips as desired. After 3 hrs of backing if they are still a bit tacky keep on baking. I scooped mine out with your average size Ice cream scoop. They turned out beautiful and delicious!

The meringue never got to the point of stiff peaks.Instead,it had a thicker-than-soupy consistency.I put them in the oven as the directions said and although they taste ok,they are rather deflated looking and flat.

Fool proof recipe. First time making meringue cookies and they were perfect. I made mine much smaller since I was using them to decorate a cake. Made about 70 small meringue kisses and it took about 2 hours baking as opposed to the 3 suggested.

This recipient is really good and lasts a long time. It's is very simple to make, and tastes amazing. Some people said they had trouble getting it to firm up, this probably is because A) they had the bowl or the beater wet. Even a slight bit of moisture will cause the meringues to collapse. This also applies to B) If they say they cooked was humid or rainy, the meringues would absorb the moisture, and again, collapse. I hope that will help anyone trying to attempt this recipie again.

I loved it! Worked so well the first time! The second time I used pre bought egg whites and it didn't stiffen, so i added cream of tar tar and it made it look like normal but it made the batter taste terrible! Their cooking in the oven right now and i hope that they turn out okay. ( also while their in the oven sprinkle some cinnimon on the top to give it some flair)

I was really disappointed with this recipe. I made one batch and started adding the confectioners sugar once the egg whites became foamy, as per the instructions. The mixture thickened but not enough to hold peaks. I put them in the oven (they were very flat) and left them for the three hours. When I took them out, some of the sugar had leaked/bubbled out and when I flipped them over, they were still uncooked (raw) underneath and were wet. I put them in for another three hours and they are still uncooked at the bottoms.

I made a second batch and this time beat the egg whites until almost stiff peaks and then added the sugar. These ones cooked to the right consistency, but they cracked and separated between the top and bottom where all the sugar leaked out and bubbled brown from the middle.

Taste was great but meringues came out too hard and dry despite having baked them for two hours (one hour less than the recipe calls for). I will repeat but leave less time in the oven next time.  The recipe as is does not need any tweaking, just the baking time.

Awesome meringue recipe! For those who are having trouble with getting stiff peaks, I had my mix mixing for a little over 30 minutes. Just keep pushing through, you'll get those peaks eventually trust me! And I didn't bake mine for 3 hours, I put them in at 190 degrees and baked them for 1 hour and a half with the oven closed and then let them sit or "dry" in the oven for a few hours.

I loved the recepie, but I changed a little something. Instead of baking them for three hours, I changed the temperature to 130 degrees C, and baked for 50min. Other than that, it's amazing!

By far the best meringue recipe I've come across. I whipped the egg whites on slow/medium speed for a little over 20 minutes total (I did not wait for them to get to room temp). Once the egg whites were foamy (about 5 minutes in) I added the sugar in 1/8cup increments. Also, I did add 1tsp almond extract and then about 1tbsp extra sugar. After I finished mixing, I folded in some chocolate chips. I scooped the mixture in tbsp increments onto parchment paper and cooked on 200 (without a spoon in the door) for 60 minutes. Pulled them out of the oven and let them rest for half an hour. They did crack a bit but they were hard on the outside and soft on the inside... Basically perfect! These cookies are sweet but you can't compromise on the sugar because they will not set up correctly and you will have a gooey mess on your hands.

Tried this recipe twice. Both fails. Im over it. Second time I was so careful to do everything perfect. Only made these because i cant find them at stores. Make sure egg whites are room temp, absolutely no yolk, utensils are cleam. Think that cream of tartar stuff must be important, its in every other recipe. Tried kosher salt. Boo  was hoping for the best

I read a couple of the negative reviews and found that most likely, it might have been caused by a couple of things. Firstly, absolutely no egg yolks in your whites. And absolutely no fat or grease on the mixers and bowls. When your meringue doesn't fluff up to stiff peaks like is intended, that is likely because your whites had yolks or your bowls and mixers aren't spotlessly clean of fat and grease. Secondly, Some ovens have uneven baking temperatures. Some ovens are also sometimes too hot than the indicated temperature, so always check with a candy thermometer before using. Lastly, make meringues on a dry day. Humidity just doesn't help meringues at all. If you have humid climate 24/7 then I'm not sure how to help you. With all that said, this recipe was great. I might have not left them to dry in the over far enough since the inside was still marshmallowy. Great recipe though.

The recipe works, they came out beautifully, but I just am not a fan.  Also, if I were to make them again I would make them all small because you don't need much when they're that sweet.

This was actually easier than expected. I beater the eggs about 10 minutes then started adding the sugar and belated for another 5 minutes. Mine didn't become stiff, but was a marshmallowy consistency. They came out perfect and were light and airy! I loved them so much more than the ones from the store! ??

I think it is worth noting that you need to ensure that all the cookies are baked on ONE rack in the oven. I had two baking sheets and I put one on the middle rack and the other on the rack just below and  unfortunately all of the meringue cookies on the lower rack cracked and bubbled. They are still good and taste the same but they are not nice looking. Of course this is my mistake, maybe everyone knows this and I missed the memo so I still give this recipe 5 stars. Very tastey!

Just attempted to make these - it was so runny that I couldn't even pipe them onto the cooking sheet. Should the egg whites have been room temperature? I mixed for at least 7 minutes and added cream of tartar too and no luck :(  Tasted a bit off the spoon...cleaning up and trying again. 
Also, would lowering the temperature be better than leaving it cracked open with a spoon? I've got little kids running about. Open ovens and small children don't mix. Ha!

These meringues are delicious! I have literally memorized the recipe, and I use it very often. The merengues are also incredibly simple to make! I would definitely recommend this recipe to beginning bakers who are looking for easier things to make.

These are really beautiful cookies. My first batch I followed the recipe exactly and the bottoms of the cookies turned brown and they exploded a little bit. They did taste pretty good, a little like cotton candy.The second batch I made turned out better. I turned my oven as low as it could go (170 F) and none of the cookies exploded or turned brown. I flavored these with watermelon flavoring oil and dyed them pink. My kids just gobbled them up (and my husband loved them too!) I did use egg whites that I set out on the counter for a day covered with a paper towel.

I had an extremely hard time getting the right consistency of meringue before baking. When I thought the texture was right, I baked them.  My oven only took two hours and the cookies were rock hard.  I guess I used too much sugar, but I would have had flat cookies.

My wife first tried these 2 weeks ago, in Nice. She tried making them at home; the first batch were wonderful, the second would not stiffen enough. When we retraced her steps, the variable was in the extract used. In the first batch, she added the extract to the egg whites, and let them sit for 2 hours. When she made her third batch, presto! It's the propylene glycol in the extracts that does the trick....but, make sure you add the extract BEFORE you whip the egg whites.

For the reviewer that gave 1 star, it sounds like you are using packaged egg whites from a carton and not fresh egg whites. I have never been able to get the carton whites to whip correctly. You should try with actual whites and see if you have the same trouble, and use parchment paper as well.

I wanted to try out my new-to-me KitchenAid stand mixer and the whisk attachment thingie, so I tried this recipe.  After reading some of the previous comments, I knew I should check everything as I went along and not just follow the original recipe, and that turned out to be right for me.  My mixer had the egg whites at stiff peak in only 6 minutes (room temp egg whites in room temp metal mixing bowl).  I wanted to add 1 tsp of vanilla so I had measured out 2-1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  I only used maybe 2/3 of a cup. I just spooned the mixture onto an airbake cookie pan lined with parchment paper, set the oven to 250 and baked the meringues for 45 minutes.  Perfection!  I do live in Arizona, and it is very dry here now, so maybe that's why my experience was very different from others.  Overall, recipe was a good jumping off point for this novice.  I'll try this recipe again, with my variations, and use different flavorings and baking times/temps to see which I end up liking best.

These come out beautiful. I used convection at 175 and they were done in an hour. Crisp outside and slightly gooey inside.  However, only giving 4 stars as I could tell they were made with confectioners sugar.  Using a superfine sugar is probably a good fix, so I will source a recipe without the confection sugar next time.

This was a hit at my family Christmas dinner but personally I think it would taste better with normal sugar rather than confectioners. It was just too sweet for me. Otherwise good!

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out PERFECT!!! Only thing Was that instead of 3 hours they were done at 1 hour and 45 minutes at 200 degrees. You could tap them with a knife and they will sound like porcelain. Delicious, crunchy and not TOO sweet just PERFECT. I do need to improve the technique since they look a bit exploded, but for a first timer and using a hand mixer they are awesome!

Every single time I've made this recipe it's been perfect! Just a heads up, the bowl you use to beat the whites up has to be absolutely clean and dry and there can't be even a speck of yolk in the whites or they won't beat up properly. I even cut the recipe in half and it still works great!

Mine are the pastel ones.

I used 2 cups castor sugar and 1/4 cup confectioners sugar. Added a good splash of high quality vanilla extract and some gel colors. Put them in the oven for 1h5minutes at 185 with door closed. I can't remember if size 18 or 22 tip was better, but one was definitely better than the other for making the lines. Only issue is that they tasted way too sweet.

This is my first time making Meringues, and I felt that it is a great recipe for beginners! After they meringue was mixed I divided in half and folded in lime zest and green food coloring drops in one bowl, and in the other I used lemon zest and yellow food coloring. I then piped them onto parchment paper lined pans in very small bite-sized drops, about 1/2" in diameter. I baked them at 175 without the door cracked for about 1-1/2 hours. I probably could've baked them for about an hour and they would've turned out a bit better.

I have made meringues many times, each time trying out a different recipe.  This was the first recipe that ended in failure.  I did everything seemingly correctly.  I had a chilled bowl and whisk, I added the sugar slowly and over time (which the recipe didn't even mention, by the way).  I started at low whisking speeds and increased....

But no matter what I did, the texture just never was right.  The meringue wouldn't reach stiff peaks, even after whipping for over 20 minutes.  It got to the point where the texture was thick and impossible to work with, but still wouldn't form stiff peaks.  

I then popped the meringues into the oven.  Not only did they ooze out of shape, but they ended up tasting far too sweet.  In the future, I would definitely cut the sugar on this recipe, it probably accounts for much of my trouble.  I also personally like to add vanilla extract.  Either way, I don't recommend following this exactly recipe.

I also made sure to clean everything hot and soapy so not a speck of oil anywhere, I am an experienced meringue maker. Thought I would try a different recipe. This did not get past marshmallowy looking stage, piped it anyway, into little puddles of goo. Sticking with tried and true recipe from now on. Just sorry I used the last four eggs on it. Now I need to go get more eggs to make a recipe that will work.

Amazing meringues! Presentation and taste was wonderful I would definetly recommend this recipe. Note: Mix to THICK consistency. Don't judge it by time make sure its thick. Otherwise you'l get flat white shapes.

the slow bake method on really low heat is what sets this apart from other failed recipes i've tried.  it's crisp all the way through, just like its supposed to be.

Didn't think to include how many meringues it makes! I have 10 cookbooks all with this exact recipe.. none of them helpful in telling me how many meringues I'm making!

I was so sad. I've made meringue cookies before and they are always so good. These didn't turn out. They never got stiff when I was mixing them. I followed the advice of some others and added a little cream of tartar and they finally got stiff but when I baked them they turned into hard little flavorless disks of chalk. I followed everything to a T, I just don't understand what happened.

Very easy recipe, I think the person who had a problem with it may have had moisture in the bowl or even had a small amount of egg yolk which will spoil the mixture.

First time making them. The taste is just sugar, a lot of sugar. Next time I will flavor them with something. There are a lot of good suggestions in the comments. I baked mine @ 185 with the door closed for 3 hrs. I use a silicone baking mat instead of parchment paper and they came right off, no sticking. Can't wait to try them with flavoring.

This didn't work at all for me. maybe I didn't beat the whites long enough or too long, but once I placed it on the cookie sheet they lost their form and look like flats pancakes.

the minimum temperature on my oven is 110C, so i just left them in for 2 hours and opened the oven door once in a while to bring the temperature down. they turned out great, except that the tops are slightly sticky, so perhaps i should have left them in a bit longer. simple and easy recipe to follow, and the results look nice and professional.

At first, I had a similar problem to one of the other reviewers, my mixture was goopy and fell the minute I tried to pipe it onto a tray. 

I got much better results when I made sure the eggs were a nice pillowy foam before adding sugar. Then, when the sugar was being added, to whip on a higher speed than the recipe recommends. 

I also found that using just a pinch of salt (the grains help to create more bubbles) and cream of tartar for its lecithin.

This recipe worked out well with the help of my stand mixer.   I added a touch of mint oil and crushed peppermint candy on top.  The only difference I experienced was the baking time.  I live in the humid, wet Northwest and it took almost four hours for the meringues to dry completely in the oven. Using the spoon in the door helped keep the cookies from getting brown.  They were beautiful and are great for a low carb diet.

This recipe turned out beautifully, and helped me regain my faith in meringues! I added 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar because I've had bad meringue experiences in the past and feared the worst. But even on a rainy day, the ingredients and technique of this recipe turned out absolutely perfect - light, fluffy, barely any cracks. With a wooden spoon in the door, they still barely needed to bake for two hours before being cooked all the way through.

Okay, first what I love. I love that the recipe is simple, and exactly what it should be. One doesnt NEED tartar in their meringues. I also love the adjectives used to describe what place to get to when making it. Foamy, and satiny. However, at least with my own personal style... i might need to add more powder. I put them in a bag and cut a hole and put them on the cookie sheet (powdered and buttered a good tip) and they just sunk down a big and made a circle. a very pretty shiney circle mind you, but not a gorgeous meringue cookie. and do not open the oven at all (besides the wooden spoon) to peek in.   Oh, and that tip someone said about putting the eggs in running hot water so they foam up quicker? VERY true.
