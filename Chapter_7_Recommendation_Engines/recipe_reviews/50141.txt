Excellent recipe for turkey or pork.  I served it with roast pork and everyone loved it.  It took longer to cook than expected, but it was worth it.  Also, I couldn't find the cranberry/apple combo JUICE (only the 20% juice) so I bought a bottle of cranberry juice and a bottle of apple juice and combined them.  Now I have the second half for my next batch.  It does make a huge portion, though.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Even family members who are not too fond of cranberries liked it. Very easy to make and yummy served warm.
