Amazing pizza, the whole family raved about it, especially the boys and their friends. I used regular pizza dough since the grocery had buy one get one free. Used rotisserie chicken to makes things even simpler. For my wing sauce I used Louisiana original wing sauce, which is pretty hot, and then for the second pizza used Louisiana honey mustard, not quite as hot. The  blue cheese and mozzarella does give some nice creamy calm to the hot spice, and I was glad I had a thick crust too ;-). This really would make a great dish to take to football parties. My boys said to make this again on Monday night Football...Thanks Saveur for another great recipe.

This was DELICIOUS! My buffalo wing sauce was extremely hot, and since I was also feeding the little guy (who does like spicy foods), I mixed some w/ some ranch dressing and used that as the base sauce, which worked out really well. The flavors were great, and it smelled wonderful while it was baking. Everyone loved it...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks, Saveur, for sharing such a nice twist on buffalo chicken and pizza! :)

This was amazingly delicious!!!!  The key is to use a very good brand of wing sauce.  I used a local wing houses sauce and used more chicken...other than that exactly as written!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!

If I could incorporate Buffalo chicken into every meal, I would, so this pizza was excellent in my book!  For the wing sauce I made "Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce" from this site.  I used monterey jack cheese in place of mozzarella, but I'm sure either is great.  I usually buy storebrand pizza crust, but sprung for the Boboli (since it was the Super Bowl).  Well worth the splurge!

Original review from June 26, 2012: This is just what I was looking for. I halved the cheeses and sauce on all but a small area but that is because as the author states, it's very rich and we were having it as dinner for two. One of us preferred the drier version and one preferred it as written, but we both thoroughly enjoyed it :) Thanks for recommending this, I used a thin crispy crust and put it on an indirect grill for about 20 minutes (very windy and had a hard time even getting the grill 400).

Tasty and spicy.  I modified the pizza "sauce" to Chef Johns Buffalo sauce, then added two TBS of corn starch to thicken (let sit for a couple hours to gel up nicely).  

I used canned chicken and let that soak in hot sauce for about an hour, and also added diced red onions to the toppings.  

I baked the store pizza crust alone for about half the time so the sauce would not make the crust mushy.  After cooking in the oven, I always broil my pizza for a minute or two to fully brown the cheese on top a little.

This was a crowd-pleaser for my family that enjoys the spicier foods.  Looking forward to trying with some BBq sauce instead of hot sauce for a lighter spice.

Made this for the SuperBowl and it was a big hit. My intentions were to photograph an individual slice of it but the boys devoured it before I even had the opportunity leaving me nothing but the whole pie in my nappy well used pizza pan. I'm not a fan of the blue cheese but even I tolerated it in the leftover scraps I was able to rummage up. 12 minutes of baking time kept the celery nice and crisp which added a whole other texture element that suited the dish perfectly.This pizza is spicy spicy (as a buffalo pizza should be) so if you are sensitive to heat you might want to cut back a little or thin it down with ranch dressing. LOVED it Saveur and cannot wait to try it again. The recipe title couldn't be more perfect for this is the ultimate football food!

Made this for a SuperBowl party this last weekend.  Flew off the table.  Used Franks hot sauce and added butter and garlic powder.  Also added more chx and sauce.  Excellant!

Absolutely delish! I wimped out and mixed the hot sauce with some homemade ranch for the pizza sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. I used really good locally made blue cheese and good quality whole milk mozzarella. I also bought some fresh dough from whole foods and couldn't be happier with the results. Easy too! Thanks Saveur for sharing this yummy recipe.

Loved this pizza!  I had a pouch of pizza dough that you added water and let rise for 10 minutes.  It made for a super quick crust.  I used medium wing sauce and it was plenty warm for me.  Loved the addition of the thinly sliced celery on the pizza.  I used bleu cheese crumbles on my portion of the pizza and feta on my bleu cheese disliking hubby's side of the pizza.  Both of us were very pleasantly pleased with our pizza. Thanks Saveur, for sharing your recipe!  I know we will be making this one again.  Can't wait to try it with homemade crust.

Watch the buffalo sauce & blue cheese.  Too much makes it too blue cheesy or too spicy

Very good! Like others, I added more chicken. I ended up doubling the amount of chicken and thought that was the perfect amount. If I do it again, I will put less sauce on the pizza (maybe 1/4 cup plus 1 TBSP), but other than that it was yummy, and perfect for watching football.

What a great idea!  This was a hit at our house.  As another review said 'I sprung for the Boboli and it was well worth the splurge' :)  Never knew how great that crust was!  I did change the recipe a bit and added a good bit of Ken's Ranch Dressing on top of the hot sauce prior to topping with the mozzarella cheese.  Thank you!

Din't work for me. The taste of the wing sauce was overwhelming, pretty much the only thing I could taste.

Super delish!  The only thing I will do differently next time is use a bit less sauce on the crust - it was just a tad too saucy for our tastes.  Serve with creamy blue cheese or ranch dressing for dipping.  Thanks for sharing!

This pizza was amazing!  I used a Pillsbury crust, pre-baked 5 minutes, rotisserie chicken, and took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/4 cup ranch dressing and 1/4 cup Frank's hot sauce for the base to cut the heat.  Added some sliced green onions as well.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I just made this last weekend and it was great! I didn't cut it into tiny squares though, I just ate it like a regular pizza. I used Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce. My son told me 'This pizza is great! You should make it every weekend!' And the celery was a great addition to the pizza, providing just the amount of crunch and flavor! I'll definitely be making this again.

Just ok for me.  Used a Boboli pizza crust and had a can of chicken so that was what I used.  Only used 1/4 cup of sauce and glad I did, pretty spicy.  I did pour some blue cheese dressing on top after I ate a piece and that helped.

Nice variation on your typical pizza.  There is a lot of flavor so you don't need to add too much in the way of toppings.  Have some ranch or bleu cheese dressing to drizzle over the top to finish it off.

It was way too spicy for my family.and next time I will reduce the amount of sauce and crumbled cheese. The store bought crust was chewy so next time I will make my own crust. I do plan on making this pizza again with the  changes and I think my family will enjoy it more.

Great recipe. I won a pizza making contest with this one! I used Frank's hot sauce. I couldn't find Boboli's so I made my own crust.

I really enjoyed this pizza. I followed the advice of another reviewer and mixed my wing sauce with ranch dressing, and used that as my base. I also added sauteed purple onions and green peppers as a topping. I doubled my cheese AND meat. I omitted the blue cheese crumbles (me and the hubby aren't blue cheese fans). The celery added something special to the taste.... I liked the crunch it gave. Will definitely make this again.

Like others, I cut back on the bleu cheese and used about half of a 4oz container, which was plenty. I think I'll use a "real" crust next time and tame down the hot sauce a bit with some ranch dressing. As presented, the recipe is too hot and too "bleu" for us but it's easy enough to modify a bit. Very good flavor combo!

Not yet but when I have anything buffalo I use blue cheese dressing it takes the bite out better than ranch.
