I used this rub on a pork shoulder roast. Had to multiply the ingredients exponentially because it was a 9 pound roast but it was delicious. The beauty is that the base is perfect by itself but you can add to it whatever you like to make it your own.

A really fantastic rub for ribs.  I do my ribs backwards and grill them for a sear first before putting in the oven and the lack of sugars in this rub make it the perfect rub.

I have been using this rub now for over a year and it is the BEST.  This year I will make 2 batches and in 1 batch add 1 tea of Everglades Seasoning & Adobo Seasoning w/o pepper. These are my go-to seasonings and they never miss their mark.  Adding a little Accent (msg) never is a bad idea when you are doing a Bar-B-Que or a smoker outing.
