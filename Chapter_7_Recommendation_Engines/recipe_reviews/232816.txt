Works out awesome. Now my only pizza dough recipe! I layer the ingredients in my breadmaker on dough setting. Water, oil, sugar, salt, then flour and then yeast.

I made this crust on Thanksgiving eve, because I didn't have enough to do with making 2 pie crusts, baking 2 pies and prepping things for a salad!  Oh yes, back to the crust......we really enjoyed this crust.  I didn't know what 'hard white whole wheat flour' was, so I used 1 cup bread flour, 1 cup AP flour and 1 cup brown whole wheat flour.  I proofed the yeast and sugar before adding all ingredients to the bread machine.  I let the dough rise in a bowl 30 minutes after taking it out of the bread machine.  This dough was extremely easy to work with and I definitely would use this recipe again.  I'm going to try another store or 2 to try and find the correct flour. I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  Pizza and crust were delicious!  Thanks Miriam for sharing your recipes, I look forward to trying your other published ones.

This made two pizzas for us when rolled out thin.  Baked at 425 for 12 minutes. It might have needed a little longer but the cheese was already getting very browned. Not exceptional but held a lot of toppings well and was not too dense.

Will try again with half white half wheat flour. It was too dense and thick. Next time I'll try to roll it as thin as possible as the thickness if the dough almost doubled in height when cooked.

Loved this recipe! There was way too much dough for my liking (I like a really thin crust) so I split it between two pizza stones and invited the neighbors over to eat the second pizza. Next time I will likely just split the recipe in half. After rolling out the dough to about 1/8-1/4 inch thick I melted some butter and cut up fresh rosemary and brushed it over the top of the pizza dough. I put some shredded bbq chicken (wish I could say it was homemade but it was actually the Jack Daniels bbq chicken from Costco), onion, and fresh mozzarella cheese over the dough and put it in the oven at 400 degrees for about 11-13 minutes. My husband isn't usually a fan of things with whole wheat but he loved it and this recipe made it to his "make this dinner again" list.

Easy-to-follow instructions, basic ingredients, and fast prep!  The key is to roll the center thin, pushing the extra dough towards the edges for a thick & chewy crust.   Much healthier and tastier than store-bought frozen pizzas.

I don't have hard white whole wheat flour and didn't know what it was, so I looked it up.  According to Bob's Red Mill, it is flour ground from whole grain hard white wheat berries.  And now we know!  No clue if I can get it at my local grocery store, but I'll check the next time I'm in that aisle.  Since I don't have the flour, I used half whole wheat flour and half white for this and it turned out well.  I baked at 425 for about 25-30 minutes with toppings and hubs and I enjoyed it for dinner.  thanks for the recipe!

This was a little dry as far as pizza dough goes.  It was different. I will make it again, but I may change the recipe to make it more moist.

This will now be my go to pizza dough recipe. I took the advise of reviewer and used 1 cup bread machine flour, 1 cup all purpose and 1 cup whole wheat and made in my bread machine.  Precooked for 5 mins before putting toppings on.  Loved it.

If there was a way to do negative stars, this recipe would get them. I am an experienced bread maker and this recipe became unusable immediately.

No substitutions. First time homemade dough. Delicious. Challenging to roll out.

While combining ingredients, I found very dry so I added a bit more water.  Still seemed dry when I formed for toppings.  I did add some granulated garlic, dried oregano to give a bit of flavor.  
The end result was like a bit denser than I usually prefer, but it tasted really good and once serving was very filling.

This is a good recipe if you like a purely whole wheat dough. Because of this it is quite dense but it is good. If you like a slightly lighter dough substitute some regular bread flour. Also, I made this in my bread machine for 10 servings and needed to add 2 Tbsp morer water to what the automatic conversion function on the site calculated. Finally, using a flavor infused olive oil adds an interesting touch.

Crust was a bit doughy. I'm new at this.
