Atomic is an understatement! Holy WOW these wings will light you up. I definitely recommend having a cold beverage nearby. I chose to grill mine and they turned out good. I thought I made as written but I now see that I overlooked the cinnamon somehow. If I were to make again I might try substituting ground chipotle pepper for the ground jalapeno pepper to give them a more smokey flavor.

It's VERY SPICY, which is great, but that's the only flavor that comes through, which is not great. The sugar and salt and cinnamon do nothing.

I guess the name atomic should have been a clue. they were a hit with the teenagers,but yes they are spicy, they require a sour cream dip.
