Made as written except that I chose to grill my steak outdoors. We just like our steak better that way. I read this recipe several times and each time it sounded more odd than the time before. I mean feta and parsley on fajitas? Why not cotija and cilantro? Roasted cucumbers? I kept searching for something else for dinner but kept coming back to this recipe. Why not? These were definitely different but excellent too! I let my steak marinate overnight and it was super tender. The cucumber roasted just fine and the chickpeas had a nice crunch to them which added a nice texture. My husband and I both agree that this one is a keeper!

I loved these Mediterranean-inspired tacos! The marinade was straightforward and very tasty. Thanks for the clear directions to cook the flank steak! I didn't have an instant-read thermometer, so I let each side broil for 3.5 minutes on each side for medium-rare. Loved the veggies! Only tweak would be to hold back on some of the oil, my vegies came out a touch greasy. Make this for dinner!
