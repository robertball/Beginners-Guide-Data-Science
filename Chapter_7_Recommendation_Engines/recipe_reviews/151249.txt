Very tasty!  BUT I wanted it to be healthier and am trying to incorporate more fruit into my day. SO, I omitted the sugars completely.  I substituted 1 lowfat vanilla yogurt and 1 fat free coconut cream yogurt for the plain yogurt, mayo and sugars.  I did blend in a little mayo.  The flavor was very good and I didn't have the fat - and way less sugar.  So mine is definitely for the health-conscious!

This salad turned out great!  However, I used the recipe more as general guidelines than strict instructions.  I used 5 small/medium Fuji apples, two large stalks of celery, 1.5 cups of grapes, and 1 cup of dried cranberries.  I left out the pear and raisins and used 3/4 cup of walnuts instead of the almonds.  I followed the dressing instructions fairly closely except that I used fat-free mayo and reduced all the ingredients by around 1/3.  (I also tossed the chopped apples with the lemon juice so they wouldn't brown.)  I appreciate a recipe that can be tinkered with this much and still turn out so delicious.  The cinnamon was a great touch.  The salad was almost too sweet, so I'd recommend taking care with the sugar, especially if you use the full amount of raisins and dried cranberries.

My husband wanted a Waldorf Salad for Thanksgiving day and decided this on Wednesday night (and we were having 30 people over).  Well, all recipes is where I turn to when I want to quickly find a recipe.  This one sounded yummy except I didn't have any walnuts left but I did have plenty of pinon nuts.  Well, I followed the recipe but added the pinon nuts. Another thing I did was I left out the rasins and used red seedless grapes instead of the green. Come the end of the turkey dinner and we barely had any salad left for the next day.  Thanks for a good recipe...this one is a keeper. Everyone liked it, especially the kids.

This recipe is delicious!  Sweeter than than the classic Waldorf.  I left out the raisins.  I loved the dressing, but I only used 1/2 to 2/3 of it. I would suggest starting with less and adding more to suit your taste. The cinnamon added a perfect touch to it.

I'll be the first to rate this recipe as simply delicious!  I have been trying to find a waldorf salad recipe that is tart and sweet and not too mayonaissey tasting... This is it!  I found it!  I added 1/2 c of walnuts for some more crunch and cut back on the cinnamon.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

The first time I made this I used cottage cheese (that I pulsed in the blender) instead of yogurt, cause that is what I had on hand. It came out very well, but was a little too sweet for our tastes. The second time I made it (which was this past weekend) I omitted the golden raisins and substituted red for green grapes. Then I used a 1/4 cup yogurt, a 1/4 cup mayo, a half a lemon juiced and a sprinkle of white sugar (possibly 1 Tbsp). It was perfect! Thank you Jenny for sharing your twist on a Waldorf! Great way to use Asian pears

Yummy!!  I was a little hesitant using mayonnaise and yogurt.  But OMG! So delicious. I used vanilla yogurt and added some dried cherries instead of raisins.  Very good and refreshing on a hot summer evening.  Thanks!

Made exactly as written and none of my Thanksgiving guests cared for this.  The flavors didn't blend together at all.  Very disappointing recipe.

this is NOT your mother's waldorf salad. This is so good! I used vanilla yogurt. This says that it makes 8 servings...but it makes a LOT, and I only used 2 apples.  A recipe has to be really wonderful for me to take the time to review it! thank you

I was trying to use up some pears, so I put in plenty of those and skipped the apples. I didn't have dried cranberries so used some dried mixed fruit pieces and also chopped almonds. There was so much liquid in this salad that I had to add a good cup of leftover rice to it and some more raisins just to have something in it that people could chew on. It was like eating soup. But my family LOVED this salad and I will definitely make it again.

Wow - what a great recipe!  I went out on a limb and added some thinly sliced cabbage to it as my celery was looking a little wimpy...Oh and I also just noticed that I forgot the white sugar.  (Obviously the recipe is bulletproof if you can tweak it that much and still have it turn out great - my apologies to you purists out there who get grouchy when people review recipes they don't follow to a tee.)  The dressing itself tastes fabulous and the addition of the yogurt allows you claim that its 'healthy'!  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box, Jenny!  I will definitely make this again  :o)

I made this for a dinner of thirty people and the best part is the fact that you can change the number of servings and it changes the recipe. I used Walnuts instead of almonds…I’m wishing I would of used the almonds, I mixed my grapes half red, half white and also added Gala apples as well as the others. This pretty much liked by everyone and I should of printed out the recipe to share. I think it would be great with chicken added and served on a crescent for a special luncheon. This was a great recipe!!!! Will definitely make this a keeper.

This recipe was a perfect combination of savory and sweet.  I made it for thanksgiving dinner at the in-laws, and everyone enjoyed it.  I used walnuts instead of almonds.  Great recipe!

This is great, but try this.  Instead of Yogurt.....take 1 cup of 
whipping cream, whip it in a blender until it is stiff then add
3 tablespoons of powdered sugar to the rest.  Its really sweet and
delicious

I thought this would be perfect for fall with all of the fruits in season.  I read most of the reviews and would agree that there is too much sauce.  I cut the amount in half and still had more than enough.  I also agree that the combination of ingredients make for a strange mix of flavors.  While it was o.k. for hubby and I to have as a side with lunch, it's nothing that I would serve if I were entertaining guests.

Also used cut walnuts with the slivered almonds.   Used vanilla yogurt instead of plan, added sweetness.  This recipe made loads, had spare dressing and mixture after 1 big bowl made.

Great Recipe!! Very simple and it looks great too. I made it exactly as listed and added some red grapes. I made it about 4 hours ahead of time so the fruit would chill in a separate bowl, and the dressing chilled in another. Family and special visitors loved it. I did pay attention to the many reviews that indicated too much dressing. I simply put the dressing in a small pitcher and let everyone pour it on their own serving and mix it in. Some opted to go without dressing. This approach worked perfectly. I do agree, it would have been way too much liquid for the fruit if I had poured it all into the serving bowl. This way, the leftover fruit will keep much better as well. The leftover dressing - it is soo yummy. It is going on oatmeal in the morning. Next time, the only thing I will change is to eliminate the pear, and add a variety of apples since my husband, who doesn't like pears at all, was able to detect it in the mix (I thought he would miss it!). Love it!

Yummy, but a bit much going on!  I think it would have been better with less "sauce" too.  Next time I'd make the sauce as stated but pour it on little by little until the consistency seemed right.

Delicious, easy and fast! It was a bit too sweet ( and I have a sweet tooth) so next time I would cut back on the sugars and the mayo....there seemed to be a lot of dressing!

I love this version of a waldorf salad. I don't like quite that much dressing, so I cut it back by about 1/3. I added pecans, because they are what I already had. I also substituted a red pear, because I couldn't find an asian pear. If you are making this the night before, save the marshmallows to add shortly before serving as they will melt overnight in the dressing.

I was looking for a little extra for my meal last night and tried this.  It was fabulous.  I was feeding 5 children, 3 teens, and 5 adults.  One of the children really turned up his nose when he saw it, so I told him to just touch it with his finger and taste and if he didn't like it, the others could have more.  As soon as he tasted it, his eye lit up and he said, "Grandma, is this dessert!?!"  The only change I made, was the use of vanilla yogurt since I didn't have plain.  I think I will continue to use vanilla.  VERY good recipe!

Awesome salad - great for someone who likes Waldorf salad but isn't a fan of mayo. I followed another user's suggestion and used cottage cheese instead of the yogurt (because that's what I had on hand). When I blended it I added a little milk to get the right consistency and help blend the curds. I also added some halved red grapes and a few extra slivered almonds. Will definitely make again!

This was very good, but I ended up making changes.  Store had no granny smiths, so I used braeburn.  I had walnuts on hand, so used those instead of almonds.  I cut back the amount of cranberries by 1/2.  I also cut back the amount of dressing by about 1/2 and it was still plenty.  I also slightly cut back the amount of sugars and it was still plenty sweet.

I made a smaller quantity of apples so I adjusted 1 TBL of mayo and 2 Tbl of yogurt and a good drizzling of honey instead of sugars.  Delish!

I am giving 5 stars to my version of this recipe.  I can't stand Granny Smith apples, so I used a large Ambrosia apple, a large red delicious apple and a couple of Golden Delicious apples.  I used 2 Great Value Vanilla Yogurts (6 oz. each), and Great Value Cranberries with Honey Roasted Pecans instead of just regular almonds.  Since the nuts and cranberries were sweetened already, I did not add the white sugar and added the brown to my taste.....a little at first, then more later after chilling and tasting.

This was fantastic! I’ve made a Waldorf for years, but decided to try a different recipe this year. I had about 6 family members (the ones who cook) ask me for the recipe. I will be making this again! I made this recipe a day ahead and it was delicious.

This is a nice variation of the original salad. I? would decrease the dressing by half, unless you enjoy a soupy salad. The yogurt is a nice touch.

I've been looking for a good Waldorf Salad with yogurt for a while so I thought I'd give this a go. I apologize I had to make a few changes because of the ingredients I had on hand but this is still a 5 star salad. I couldn't find plain yogurt so I used vanilla and cut out the brown sugar and cut back on the white sugar by a bit. I didn't have a pear or almonds so improvised by adding an extra apple and used toasted walnuts.  I didn't add raisins which is a personal preference. I like how versatile this recipe is and it will be my go to for Waldorf Salad. Next time I'll plan ahead and use a pear and almonds. Thanks for sharing this recipe Jenny.

I was at out country home so I used what I had available and cut the recipe in half. I used one whole Granny Smith and one whole honey crisp apple but no Asian pear. Had no plain yogurt so substituted chobani 2% pineapple, mayo and added 3 tablespoons of lite sour cream. Trying to make it healthier, cut out all sugar, raisins, and used 1/2 cup of walnuts instead of almonds. Mixed dressing and fruit separately until chilled completely and then mixed 1 hour prior to dinner.  Turned out wonderful and just slightly sweet, there was just a hint of the pineapple. Next time I may add jicama for extra crunch.
