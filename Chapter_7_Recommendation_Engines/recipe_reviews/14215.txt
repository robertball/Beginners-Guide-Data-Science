I am totally impressed with this recipe! It tastes exactly like the cucumber and yogurt salad I've been served in many middle eastern restaurants. When I wrote up my shopping list, I neglected to write down how many cucumbers to purchase. As a result, I only bought two. The only change I made was to lighten up a bit on the mint, and it turned out just fine.

I did not like these at all, the salt caused the cucumbers to be watery, which watered down the yogurt sauce. I will not try these again.

My SO and I enjoyed this recipe.  It was refreshing.  I followed the recipe instructions except for the cucumber preparation.  I peeled, seeded and sliced them thicker, and I did not salt them.  They were not watery at all.  If any water did form on top, I just poured it off.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe!  Actually I used dill instead of mint and it was great.  It's a good side dish with spicy foods.

This wasn't very good.  I tried serving it over some fresh greens, but in the end there was just too much garlic and not enough flavor from anything else!

I took fresh produce from my organic garden and I turned this into a cucumber and yogurt chilled soup. I used dill from my garden instead of mint, and topped it with fresh diced green onions. I followed the recipe and loved it :) very fresh, clean, and healthy.

By subbing dill for the mint and adding just a tablespoon of chopped onion and a splash of lemon juice this went from good to tremendous!  Deleting the olive oil and using nonfat yogurt makes it so healthy, it's scary!

What a simple, healthy salad.  Whips up in seconds.  I used fresh mint instead of dried.  If you do this, you will need a lot more fresh mint than you think because of the concentrated flavor you get from dried.

Even more delicious the next day!!

We enjoyed this dish.  I used fresh mint because I had it on hand in my garden, and I drained the yogurt the same time I was draining the cucumbers.

I was looking for a recipe to duplicate the Raita (a Indian cucumber side dish) that we had at our local Indian restaurant. This came pretty darn close. I did add a bit of fresh chopped cilantro as a counterpoint to the dried mint. Next time, I might use fresh mint as well. Thanks Jen for sharing this recipe!

Love this recipie...reminds me of what the gyro places serve on the side for their gyros...cucumber sauce..YUM!  Great in a Low-fat/Low-carb Pita with any form of meat..turkey meatloaf, turkey slices, ham...you name it.  Thanks!  I think we could even add onions and stevia to sweeten :)

fantastic! I wasn't sure at first but so glad I went ahead and tried it. Letting the cukes totally drain and pressing with  a paper towel will make or break it.

I used fresh mint from my garden.   A very tasty change from the usual cucumber salad with vinegar dressing.   I enjoyed it as a topper for crackers, too.

This recipe has great potential as reviewed by other  cooks. I would cut down on the garlic and use 1 clove.  I  salted and poured off the excess moisture.  This is standard procedure for making a cucumber salad.   It also makes a great dip for raw veggies.

This recipe wad ok.  I used dill instead of mint but the recipe need acid like fresh lemon juice.  And I thought by cutting the cucumbers in quarters and slicing it thin took away from the dish.  I would leave it whole with some of the skin and slice it thinly.

i brought this as a side for easter. i made the dressing 2 days in advance to really soften the dried mint. it helped a lot and i would recommend it. i added some dried dill as suggested and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic (sometimes raw garlic grosses me out). everyone loved it. the yogurt and cukes really helped the dried herbs taste more fresh ones

This was just ok for me.  It was refreshing, and I didn't have trouble w/too much water like some did.  But it didn't have much flavor either.  Dill would prob. be better, but I'll try another recipe next time.
