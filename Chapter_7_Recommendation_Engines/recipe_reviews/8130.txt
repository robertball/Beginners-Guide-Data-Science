After reading through many of the 200+ reviews with all the changes, I thought it only fair to test and review this recipe as written. Other than putting it in a 9x9" pan, I made this with no changes. It's not difficult to imagine that some of the reviewers thought the cake was too sweet if they were doubling or even tripling the topping ingredients! The amount of topping as specified in the recipe is perfect, and makes for a not too sweet, "just hits the spot with a cup o' joe" coffeecake. That said, I thought the cake was a good, basic coffeecake- nice, but not extraordinary.  I'll still keep trying other recipes until I find one that really distinguishes itself from others.

I was a little daunted by a full cup of butter, so I cut it in half and added ~1/4 C. extra sour cream instead...what a success!!  This recipe is sooo good, and stays moist and fresh up to a few days.  Excellent w/milk =)

I have tried many coffee cake recipies and this is by far the best...I did make a few minor changes.  I baked the cake in a deep spring form pan and increased the cooking time to about an hour. I also doubled the crumb topping and and add fresh blueberries to the batter...PERFECT!

AWESOME MOIST COFFEE CAKE. I need my coffeecake to be very moist and this is the winner recipe for moistness. I did double the filling because the crumbs to me are so yummy.  I also baked in a 9inch springform pan for an hour and it was perfect.  Much easier to present on a dish and cut up when all you have to do is remove the sides of the springform pan.  Next time I will add some chopped nuts to the crumb mixture and drizzle a conf sugar icing on top when its still warm(1 cup conf sugar, 1 tbs butter, 1 tbs milk or cream) and that would be the ultimate coffee cake!  As a side note about all the reviews about the sugar being too much-I did not quite fill my cups full so I skimped a little- but I found it not to be too sweet at all.

I LOVE this cake!!  Everytime I make it people just can't get enough, including my husband who doesn't like sweets.  I doubled the topping and have added chopped pecans to it (1/4c), I've added a shredded Granny Smith Apple to the center layer, and I've added blueberries (1/4c) to the center layer also.  Will keep this one around and make often.

Soooo moist and rich! Every one I serve this too asks where I bought it ;) Like others I also doubled the topping and used brown sugar instead of white. Next time I think I'll experiment a little, maybe the addition of some chocolate chips?  *edit*  I made this again recently as a counter to all the chocolate covered abominations during the holiday season in my office. This time I added a bag of Hershey's cinnamon chips to the bottom layer of the batter and whoa nelly...best coffee cake ever.

Good recipe, moist cake, but the rising power wasn't impressive.  I might add an extra 1/2 tsp. baking powder.

I used a 9" square pan and added 10 minutes to the cook time and it turned out moist and tasty.  Everyone loved it!  I will definately do this again.

I followed the recipe exactly. The cake is good...but not what I was expecting. It's a cross between a butter cake & a coffee cake. It's very moist...almost a little too moist.

This is the first time I've ever left a review of any recipe, but out of all of them that I've tried on this website, this is my favorite by far.  I've made it several times and, not only do I love it, I get requests all of the time now.  I always make it the same way:  Double the topping (but put the majority of it in the middle bc it's better there :), add 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans to the topping and filling mix as well (toast in over 1st if you have time).  I use three small loaf pans; you can give one away, freeze one, etc.. I think they taste better this way too.  Also, baking time is about 50-60 minutes; I cover with foil halfway through and take foil off the last 5 minutes of baking.  This cake is PERFECTION.  I have to think that if someone gave it a bad review, they must have messed up somewhere.  I've never had anyone try it that didn't like it.  Thank you!

Well I cant talk as my mouth is full of cake right now!  It is not to be bbelieved how good this cake is!  It is fresh, moist, very tasty and made the house smell like Heaven while baking.  Only changes I made were soy based sour cream and parve margerine to eliminate the lactose.  Husband couldnt wait  to try the cake and  ate it before I took the photo.  He said I am lucky there is any left to get a photo of! LOL  Might try adding blueberries next time.  TRY this one!!!!!- - - - - - - - Made this cake again for a school bake sale as cupcakes.  I used real sour cream this time since the hubs was not eating it - I confess to trying one- wanted to see what the difference was between the soy sour cream and the full dairy sour cream.  To be perfectly honest I prefered the soy version.  I thought the cake had an odd tang it did not need and the texture was not as nice.  If making to give away I will still use the soy sour cream as IMO it is way better.  I love dairy - all of it but this was just not near as good as the soy.

A great coffee cake, but a 9 x 13 pan??  They must have been smokin' somethin'.  You would almost have to DOUBLE this recipe to get it to properly fit a pan that size.  Unless of course, you like cake that's one inch thick...  Double the filling anyway.

I haven't made a coffee cake in over ten years. I decided to try this one and was very thankful I did. It was soooo easy to make; all the ingredients are average enough that without planning ahead to make this, I still had all the ingredients needed. The only thing I did differently was double the cinnamon topping. Delicious. Between four of us, half of the 9x13 is already gone! Thank you!

Thanks for this great recipe!  I made it this morning and substitued 1 cup canola oil in place of the butter and it was still a great moist cake.  It came out looking fabulous.  Next time I'll try doubling the filling or maybe poking some holes in it and then pour a 10X sugar glaze on it.

This cake is very yummy and moist. I used a nonstick 9" springform pan and doubled the crumble filling. In the middle layer, I also sprinkled about 3 cups of fresh blackberries which had been tossed with a squeeze of lemon juice and 2 T of white sugar. The 1 C of butter seemed a little much, so I also cut it down to a little more than 1/2 C. Chopped walnuts also made a nice addition to the top filling. My husband, my parents, and my coworkers all love this cake and the recipe is just so easy to follow. I'd definitely recommend trying it, especially if you have a bunch of extra sour cream lying around.

5 stars for the moist cake.  2 stars for the crusty, hard topping.  Maybe i did something wrong?  I used 3/4 cup butter instead of 1 cup, but I will try 1/2 cup next time as a few others have tried.  This coffee cake was a bit tricky to bake as it did not bake evenly, leaving the edges a bit hard and the center soft.  Spreading 1/2 the filling into the pan then half the topping and then the rest of the filling was very hard to do...the dough was very very thick!

This cake turned out to be a disaster, way to much butter & sugar. The right amount for this recipe is 1/2 c. butter and 1 c. sugar. When I made this cake I baked it for 1.5 hrs. and it was still raw around the edges and in the middle of the cake.

This coffee cake was very good. I bakes it in a springform pan for around 45 minutes. It seemed done. The toothpick came out clean but the next day when we cut into it the middle was soggy. I'm sure it was my fault. On the plus side I was able to salvage the outer rim and it was delicious. I will definitely try again, maybe in another size pan.

I read most of the reviews and also noted that the cake doesn't rise that much.  I followed the recipe as instructed by the cook/author.

this is delicios.  i have been making this every sunday morning for awhile but decided to try to lighten up.  my husband almost always can tell when i do this, and he LOVED the new, light version (and doesn't even know it's light!)  i substituted 1/2 brummel & brown, 1/2 applesauce for the butter, used fat free sour cream, and cut the sugar down in the batter by just a bit (didn't measure, just used less).  i also used cake flour, and instead of vanilla extract used maple.  it smelled incredible and was delicious and very moist and tasted very rich.  this is a keeper, either way!!

I HATE giving bad reviews, but I followed this to a T, and it turned out horrible. The batter looked and smelled great, but when all was said and done, it was bland, dry, and very plain.
I am so sorry!!!!

I made this coffee cake for the first time and although the flavor was really good, I didn't feel there was enough batter for a 13x9 pan.  The next time I make it I will use a smaller pan and add a little more cinnamon and brown sugar and maybe some chopped apples.

For us just too much butter because using 3/4 of a cup produces an exceptionally moist cake (or bread).  Also, some complaints about it not rising and the answer for me was to add 1/2 tsp. baking soda which is normal when using sour cream or buttermilk.  Other than the above (and of course to our tastes) it is a good reliable coffee cake.

I love this coffe cake!  It is light and moist and always a hit.  I add a 1 tsp of vanilla and a few sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter and do not bother with putting the topping in the middle.  I just sprinkle all of the topping on the top! :)

Great taste, but had to bake for longer than the recommended time.  Could use more topping as well.

This was the best coffee cake. Everyone at the office loved it and wanted the recipe. I did substitute cake flour for all purpose in the cake ingredients but not the filling.

Just as a coffee cake should taste. Moist, sweet and with an essence of cinnamon. This recipe was easy and my guests all loved it.

Great cake!  Used 1.5 cups white sugar.  Added 1/2 cup soaked raisins and 1/4 cup broken pecans to middle layer with streusel topping.  Turned out great.

Okay, nothing overly special about this cake. Decent, but would not make again. Halved the recipe, don't think that changed flavor though. Thanks Edit: Was very moist, and much better after it sat a few hours.

In my opinion this coffee cake is just average. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I didn't put the streusel in the middle, only on top, and there wasn't enough of it to even cover the entire top of the cake. I would definitely recommend at least doubling it, if not tripling it if you want streusel in the middle and on top of your cake. Also, the cake needed to bake for 50 minutes. It was still a little gooey in the middle after 40 minutes in the oven. I don't think this cake is good enough to make again. I'll keep searching for a better coffee cake recipe.

After reading all of the reviews this has, I decided to just make it as stated. I'm glad that I did, cause it is wonderful! The only thing I did differently was to bake in a 10" springform for about 45 minutes. This is perfect and I will definately make this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I quickly put this together for a last minute brunch...it was really good. It was moist and fluffy. I also think I will use brown sugar instead of white for the topping. Cinnamon added to the batter would be a nice touch too.

I tried this recipe and I made one modification and that was to cut down on the butter by using only a stick and a half. I have one thing to say about this cake -- it is good, good, good!

Great Coffee Cake made it as a gift for pre-school teachers and they loved it.  Thanks for sharing, already have made this one again.  I did run out of sour cream for one of the cakes and used vanilla yogurt and it was still so delicious.

I love this recipe, its perfect as is! I have been making this recipe for over 10 years, its so simple & taste marvelous. The sour cream makes it nice and moist, everyone always loves it, I wouldn't change a thing about it. You can even mix it up, put it in a pan, & let it sit in the frig overnight & bake the next morning.

I baked a double batch of this to take to the office for our staff meeting this morning having never tried the recipe before.  I baked it just as it said except that I doubled the topping.  It was delicious.  There was no doubt it was a hit.  I think about 10 people tracked me down for the recipe after the meeting was over.  This is such a good basic recipe I am going to try it with some variations like adding nuts, blueberries or chocolate chips.  I highly recommend.

This recipe is the least difficult one I've used. I baked them as holiday gifts for family & friends. The first batch I realized I didn't have any sour cream, so I improvised & used nonfat plain yogurt. The substition worked great & the batter was creamy & the cake baked without any problems!

This cake is delicious! I did double the filling like other reviewers suggested and added some chopped walnuts to the filling mixture and it was perfect! So moist and so delicious. For those few comments that said it was doughy or did not rise correctly, I would suggest that you check the expiration date on your baking powder and flour (as well as all other ingredients). Expired baking powder and flour do not bake correctly and will most certainly affect the outcome of any recipe. Hope this helps!!

This cake is impossibly, irresistibly moist. YUM! I always use half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose. Adding a slash of vanilla doesn't hurt. I also don't like my coffee cake sickeningly sweet, so I decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. One mention: I have no idea how anyone could double or triple the topping. I almost had too much using the amount called for. I was DEFINITELY glad that I cut back on the sugar in the batter, as it would have been MUCH too sweet if I hadn't with the topping! I will definitely make this time and time again!

This is the best (I mean the best) coffee cake I have ever tasted! It was so easy to make, I did double up on the topping and baked it in a bundt pan for  hour. I will definately make this again, this is a keeper. This cake is way better than Starbucks coffee cake. Save your money and make this instead!

Lovely, lovely cake! HOWEVER, I did feel it was missing something..perhaps some pecans in the filling/topping.  I followed advice from previous comments and doubled the filling/topping...don't think I'll do it again, it was too much and I ended up throwing some out.  I also put half the cake in the freezer as it is quite a large cake. Other than that it was wonderful.

Excellent! I just made it and it was great!  I added a bit of cinnamon to the batter as well as the topping. I also halved the recipe and baked it in a bread pan - worked perfect for resisting the temptation of eating an entire pan of this! :) Halving the recipe fits perfect in a bread pan.

This coffee cake was so good.  I served it for a Mom's group and I got compliments at how moist it was.  I followed the ingredients exactly, baked in in a round springform pan for about 15 minutes longer, and took a knife and swirled the topping into the cake.  I will make this again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Disappointed!  After rave reviews on this site I decided to try this recipe. I wanted to make muffins for a bake sale/fundraiser. I was so upset to see that they didn't really rise. They are flat on top and the crumb topping just got too crispy and falls off. I don't want to take these to a bake sale. Also, for the record I am a very good baker and followed the directions perfectly with no modifications. I agree that the cake is too dense and has a strange texture. I prefer the other types of coffee cake. I guess I will make new muffins tomorrow!

I made this cake, but I changed it. I added twice the amount of vanilla,I made twice the amount of crumb mixture, and I baked it for 50 minutes.Everyone loved it! The recipe says to break up the mixture into two layers, I didn't have enough to do that , it would only spread half way for the top layer, and I used only enough to spread across the first layer.  It was a very thick cake mix.  The next time I make it....I will only make one layer and put the crumbs only on top.  Again....we loved this recipe!

Seriously the best coffee cake I have ever had.  It was so moist and yummy. I doubled the topping and I found it to be a little too much.  Next time I will cook it for more than recipe says, I cooked mine for 50 minutes and still was not cooked in the middle.

This coffee cake was absolutely fabulous!!!  It is best when it first comes out of the oven or heated up in the microwave.  I accidently used baking soda instead of baking powder..oops!  They still turned out great!  I'll have to do it the correct way next time or maybe not!

This coffee cake was pretty good.  I doubled the filling, recommended by the other reviewers, and it was very sweet!  I don't know if I would double it again.  I also made it in a 9x9 pan, and it baked for at least 15-20 min. longer.  The cake was very moist and had a wonderful flavor.  I recommend this to anyone, it is a quick & easy recipe to put together!

This coffee cake was so awful, I had to throw it away.  I don't know what everybody is talking about with the rave reviews.  It was so dense it never fully cooked and I didn't even like eating the batter!

This is a lot easier and just as tasty as a recipe I make for a tube pan. It was really moist in a 13x9 inch pan, and everyone at the office ate it up quickly! No crumbs remain!

Awesome! Didn't have enough sour cream...so I made a half batch...turned out great! Agree with everyone about the cinnamon. I also added diced Granny Smith apples to the center filling. My kids and husband LOVE it!

Delicious! So moist yet light. I had only about a half cup of sour cream so I made up the remaining cup with non fat yogurt that I had on hand. I also doubled the cinnamon topping because I like a layer in the middle also. 

I made it late Christmas Eve night for our Christmas Day breakfast, knowing that I myself prefer a coffeecake that has 'mellowed' for a few hours.  My husband and two grown sons loved it, and so did I. It went quickly!! I just had the last two tiny pieces tonight. 

The batter of sour cream coffeecakes are typically quite thick; what you do is drop dollops, then spread those around with a thin metal spatula :) 

Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is delicious!  The sour cream makes the cake very moist.  Next time I bake it, I may try doubling the filling part of the recipe to allow more crunch/flavor in the middle and on top.

I only had 1/4 cup of sour cream, so I added 3/4 c. of buttermilk to the mix. Otherwise, I made the recipe as written. Got rave reviews from my co-workers.

Recipe is just so-so. Needs at least double the topping... but the Cake Batter is pretty tasty/moist.  I will try again with some modifications...

I have made this cake twice already, once for my husband to take to work, and again on Sunday I followed the recipe both times without changing anything and it was exceptional both times.  supper moist, I also baked it in a bundt pan and turned out pretty.

Pretty good-- moist, cinnamon-y goodness.  I've tried it twice, once in a 9x13 pan, and the second time in a 9x9 pan.  Definitely recommend using the 9x13.  Also, I didn't think it was necessary to double cinnamon topping; I did that the first time, and I had some left over.  Thanks for a great recipe.

So delicious and moist. The changes I made was the sugar amount. I only used 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups. Two cups would have been way too sweet. Actually, I may reduce it even more next time. I also added some chopped pecans to the filling and top. I will definately make this again.

Wow. Best tasting coffee cake I've ever had. I followed the recipe to a T except I used an 8x8 pan and increased the baking time to about 65 minutes. So moist and delicious. Perfectly sweet.

This was very good. The first time I made it I did double the filling and I thought it came out great. The second time I made it I didn't have enough brown sugar to double the filling so  made it as the recipe stated and it was still good but I prefer doubling the filling.  I made this for my Sunday school class at church and received many compliments on it.  Will make again

I do love the flavor of this recipe.  Don't try it in a loaf pan though like I did!  First, it took almost 1 1/2 hours to bake.  Then, I removed it from the oven and it deflated.  This isn't to say it wasn't still delicious - it was.  I made it for a friend's birthday and saved a couple pieces for my husband, who loved it.  I doubled the topping and that was great, but next time I'll half the butter as other reviewers suggested and use the 9x13 pan so that it takes less time in the oven, maybe even increase the flour a bit.  Anyway, the flavors are just wonderful.  And even with a bit of a "flop" my results were very tasty.

Ok this coffee cake is truly to die for.  It is so addicting again I am embarrassed to say how much I've already eaten.  I used a bundt pan but beware...really butter your pan.  I also doubled the cinnamon mixture and layered it twice.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee.  Definitely not for dieters!!!

I whipped this up before some friends came over and served it with coffee.  It is the BEST coffee cake I've ever had.  Totally beats Bisquick, which is usually what I make it with.  I love Starbuck's coffee cake and this was so much better than that!  I can't wait to meet it again.  Note: NOT low fat. :)

This is an excellent coffe cake; the sour cream makes it nice and moist. I doubled the filling because I like to have plenty in the middle of the cake, and it came out very yummy! Even my husband who is not big on sweet breakfast foods enjoyed it. Definite keeper recipe!

It was quite dense for my taste...not terribly dry, but sort of like a day-old coffee cake from a cafe.  (Starbucks' coffee cake is more moist.)  Perhaps the flour to liquid ratio is off?  The batter was very thick and hard to spread in the pan.  However, the sour cream gave it a fabulous wang (I reduced the sugar by half).

Overall this was a pretty good recipe.  I think next time I would put in a little less sour cream.  I would also double the topping recipe as other reviewers had suggested.  It did make a very moist, tasty coffee cake though.

It is moist! I've been asked to share this recipe w/ all who have tasted the coffee cake. The only change I would make is to make more topping, but that is just a personal preference. The cake remains moist even 2 days later.

This recipe was excellent.  My two kids loved it and they're extremely picky.  I made a mistake and put all of the topping in the middle so I just put powdered sugar on top.  However, next time my family wants me to double the crumb mixture and put the same amount in the middle as well as on the top.  They said the cinnamon was not overpowering.

I have made other sour cream cakes but sorry about a bad review on this one.   Too much sugar, didnt bake at time suggested.  Too crunchy topping....it was hard.  Why put flour in a topping?  We didnt enjoy this at all.  sorry, but thanks anyway.

I followed the recipe to a T. Great flavor and very moist but a little dense for my coffee cake tastes. Everyone else loved it though so I will make it again.

This was so good that I ate half of it myself! Cut recipe in half and used an 8 x 8 pan.  Baked for 35 minutes.  Highly recommend this.

It really was perfect.  I made it exactly except I cut the recipe in 1/2 because I only wanted a loaf.  Good think too, because I could eat the whole thing myself.

I added the sour cream and the baking powder together and let the mixture sit for 10 minutes.  The reaction of the two makes the sour cream expand even more.  I also doubled the filling mixture and poured entire mixture into a tube pan.  This took 1 1/2 hours to bake at 350. Unfortunately the cake is bland tasting after letting it sit for 24 hours. I am not sure what I could have added to make the cake part taste "out of this world delicious."

Very moist.  Like the sour cream flavor but it was a bit too sweet for our tastes.  Next time I will try decreasing white sugar and will add some nuts in the filling.

My husband and friends loved this moist and cakey treat! I added about 1/2 cup more brown sugar topping mixture because my husband likes it sweet. It was everything I could do just to get him to share! :o)

I am sorry to give this recipe such a low rating. But it just needs a lot of work. It lacked in flavor and the 'moist' aspect of it tasted more underdone even though it wasn't (it was lightly browned on the top and the toothpick was clean).  I have a stove that is less than a year old, so it wasn't my stove either. I am on the hunt for the recipe I used as a teenager. I am going to try Betty Crocker next.

Followed the recipe as is and found it be very heavy.  Cake was very moist because of the 2 sticks of butter and 1 cup of sour cream.  The flavor was ok...nothing special to me.  I don't think I'll be making this recipe again with all that butter.

Yummy! My family devoured it! I doubled the crumb because it is the best part. I'm sure it would have been scrumptious with a whole cup of butter but I only had 1/2 on hand so I just threw in some extra sour cream. It was super moist!!! I could taste the baking powder a bit, but that may have been the price of omitting some butter. I wonder if I could sub yogurt for the sour cream? Thanks for a cravable coffee cake!!!

super easy to make and good. The only revisions to the recipe I made was to add an extra tsp of baking soda like other reviews suggested. I used a 9x12 glass pyrex pan. It looks like it will not be enough batter but will fluff up nicely when baked. I think I will try to substitue with yogurt next time instead of sour cream.

I followed the reviews and used half the butter, and a scant 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar instead of the 2 c whjite sugar.  I also like what someone had suggested to use Hershey's cinnamon chips sprinkled over the bottom layer, and the second time I made it I sprinkled cinnamon chips AND blueberries (1 pint) - very good!

This is a very dense coffee cake. I added extra cinnamon, doubled the crumb topping (still felt like it needed more) and added a drizzle of frosting. It's tasty but not my favorite.

I feel kinda bad rating the recipe since I did drastically change some things and I am certain it effected the outcome. But I wanted to let other cooks know how changing certain things worked for me. On the "Most Helpful Reviews" someone suggested removing 1/2 the butter and subbing 1/4 c extra sour cream (added with the butter). Usually when you sub butter, in my experience you do it cup for cup... so I went in the middle ground and used less than 1/2 c extra sour cream but more than 1/4c. I wasn't sure how that would effect the outcome. My coffee cake baked fine, needed 40 minutes for sure but my oven is a bit low-ish on its heat accuracy. My coffee cake  texture is not flaky or dry at all. It was very moist and while not terribly dense, it's relatively heavy almost like a pound cake. I doubled the vanilla and I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger to the batter and used a little less sugar (not even 1/4 c less). Next time I make this I might try another recipe but if I still have extra sour cream in the house I will make this again. If so I will certainly double the cinnamon mixture because it could use a lot more in the middle, in our opinion.

This was a very good coffee cake. I really liked the texture and the tang that the cour cream gave it. However, I did find it a little too sweet, and would cut out some of the brown sugar and butter next time I make it.

This tasted pretty good, but it was a nightmare to cook. We followed the recipe exactly, but had to cook it (in a 9x13 pan) nearly double the time. Even then, the middle was mucky and dense, and didn't rise. We were really disappointed, given the high rating!

I usually do not write reviews for the recipes I make, but this coffee cake deserves it.  The cake really was moist.  The only extra thing I did do was drizzle some homemade icing (that I made with milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract) over it.  I did not have to make any changes to the actual recipe of the cake, though.  I will definitely be using this recipe the next time I make coffee cake.

Don't believe the hype.  I am really surprised by all of the good reviews on this cake.  The final product was way too buttery, as well as being way, way too sweet (this is even after I cut the amount of white sugar to a little more than half of what the recipe asks for!).  Also, it needs to be cooked much longer.  After baking for the amount of time it called for it still looked a little pale, so I left it in the oven for about 10 minutes longer.  It still looked pale even with the extra cooking time, but when I checked with a toothpick it came out clean (as recipe instructs to do), so I figured that was just how it was supposed to look.  After it had cooled and I cut into it, the middle was the consistency of a fudge brownie, more than cake-like.  I agree with another reviewer who said it turns out more like bars (half raw cookie bars), especially since the recipe tells you to use a 13x9 pan.  There was hardly enough batter to spread around evenly in the pan for each layer.  I would never make this again.  Even with adjustments, such as reducing butter and sugar, and increasing the cooking time, it wouldn't really make a difference because it just doesn't taste all that great to begin with.  The taste is analogous to half raw shortbread bars with way too much sugar in the recipe to begin with, but then adding even more sugar with the brown sugar topping.  If you make this I would suggest halving the butter and sugar, and baking xtra 15-20 mins with foil on top.

Just made this for the 1st time.  I was in a hurry, and didn't read other reviews, so I made it as written.  I definitely think this would do better in a smaller pan, as I see others have suggested.  It turned out more like bars that you could pick up and eat than a cake.  It was also too sweet for my taste, so I'll try reducing sugar to 1 1/2 c. next time.  For now, 3 stars is the best I can give.  If that changes after I make it again with these modifications, I'll adjust my rating.

This cake is fabulous, and the possibilities are endless!  I mixed some canned pumpkin with brown and white sugar and cinnamon, cloves, freshly ground nutmeg, and spread it on top of the crumb filling...YUM!!!  Also, I used br & wh sugars, and half AP, half oat flour, and spices listed above in with dry ingredients, as well.  Since I only had butter that was frozen solid, homemade applesauce (the same amount as required for butter) was my substitute.  Can wait to play with this one some more!!!

Try this to make it healthier! Whole wheat (or half wheat if you prefer), light sour cream, and here’s the clencher… white beans! I did ¼ cup butter and ¾ cup white bean puree. This adds fiber, protein and an enzyme that cancels out sugar! With the whole wheat and beans, I up the baking powder by about 30%. It turned out really moist, sweet and just the right blend of dense and fluffy. My favorite method with the white beans is the blender. (Cook up a batch of beans, and throw them in the freezer, they will be ready and easy whenever you need them)  Combine all wet ingredients and beans in the blender and blend until smooth. This is definately going in my recipe book!! Thanks

This recipe was great. I used only 1/2 cup of butter. I also replaced half of the sour cream with some plain greek yogurt I had. The results were great with the changes I made. I always like to reduce fat in recipes if possible. We added fresh blueberries to half of the cake for those who like them. Will make again. Oh one more thing I made this in a spring form pan and had to bake for about 55 mins.

This cake is really good, and really easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I made was to add in blueberries. If you put in blueberries, put flour and blueberries in a plastic bag, seal, and shake before adding them into the batter. This way, the blueberries will not sink to the bottom of the cake. Very good!I plan on making it again soon.

My female child made this for breakfast this morning--she doubled the topping ingredients and baked it in about an 11" X 15" pan--delicious!

Made this for an addition to a Sunday brunch and it was better than expected.  Everyone loved.  I made as is.  I am not sure what people are looking for in a coffee cake, but this recipe delivered as a classic sour cream version.

This is a good basic recipe. However, it's not great. Why? Well, it's too plain. It's good, and I wouldn't feel embarrassed serving it, but I can think of many other better coffee cakes.

I made this one time and was asked to make for a fundraiser it was so good. I ended making 10 of these cakes with rave reviews and many recipe requests. I can't recommend this enough. I didn't change a thing. It's fabulous and sooooo moist!!

This is a good recipe however I made a few changes to make it great. Decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 Cups, cut the butter down to 3/4 Cup, increased the baking powder to 1 tsp., increased salt to 1/2 tsp., and added 1 tsp of baking soda. I also sifted these ingredients with the flour. This helped it to rise a bit more.  I also doubled the topping and used softened butter rather than melted and added extra cinnamon :). Given these changes I needed to increase the baking time about 20 minutes. It turned out great, very moist and delicious!

After 4 times of making this as is, I decided to change it a bit.  Another 4 tries I've settled on the improvements.  The original is too dense for my tastes - it was difficult to get the center really done.  

Here's my changes:
reduce to 3/4 c butter
reduce to 1/2 c sour cream
add 1/2 c applesauce

This produces a lighter texture more open crumb cake.  Still very moist.

I loved this as is! I made this in two smaller loaf pans. It did take a little longer to bake-I just kept and eye on it. I did add 3 tbs of ground flax & a carton of large blueberries to it. They were excellent. Do grease and FLOUR you pans. Mine tried to stick even though i greased them. Next time I will flour as well. Enjoy!

A weekend delight!  I made some changes to feel less guilty while helping myself to a large slice.  I followed another reviewer and did 1 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 butter instead of a full cup.  I even went as far the second time to do 1/4 butter, 1 1/2 c sour cream and 1/4c skim milk...no difference!  I used 2 c. whole wheat flour and Splenda.  The cake is moist and light.  Don't skimp on the cinnamon topping, it is the best part!

My family loves the coffee cake.  I have made a few adjustments--1 1/2 c. sugar in the cake.  In the filling, I've adjusted it as follows:  1/3 c + 1/6 c flour, 3/4 c brown sugar, 3 T melted butter, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I usually just mix the filling in with the cake so the flavor permeates the whole cake.  Delicious!

The most dense, flavorful coffee cake I ever tasted!  My husband, who HATES sour cream, LOVED this cake.  Great with a gingerbread cappuccino.  Was still moist and delicious three days later.  Going to make again this weekend for guests.

This is wonderful coffee cake with a perfect consistency. I added chopped walnuts to the filling since I had extra and I thought that was delicious. 
As someone mentioned, I wet my hands to spread the batter without sticking and that worked very well.

I baked this cake for a church-fellowship. Cake was tasty and moist, yet very crumbly....looked very messy.  Also, I had to bake for approx 70-80 min!  I probably will not make again.

This recipe is DELISH!  I took 2 recommendations from other reviews:  I cut the butter in 1/2, added 1/2 C more sour cream, and I also baked it in a springform pan!  Baking time was about 75minutes.  My kids LOVE THIS CAKE!  Thanks for sharing it!

I was asked to bring a coffee cake to a church lady's function (I had never made one before), so I looked at almost every coffee cake on this site.  I picked this recipe and was so glad I did!  I got rave reviews at church and then again when I made it for work.  The only minor change I made to the recipe is to put the crumb filling on top and "cut" it into the batter with a knife.  This has worked great and seems a lot easier to me!

I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it, as did my six year old son who is my toughest critic. It came out moist and NOT too sweet. I read the reviews and took the advice to double the amount of vanilla to 1 tspn and double the amount of filling. It came out awesome and I will definitely be making this again. I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (not that it needed it) and it made for a great dessert. Thanks for a winning recipe!
8/19/07 Update: although this cake did not last very long it tasted better each time we had it! I also forgot to mention I also baked it for 55-60  minutes.

Who needs Corner Bakery with this recipe?  This was so tasty and moist!  I doubled the topping and mixed it in (instead of layering it) and added a litte on top for some crunch.  Topped with powdered sugar and fresh raspberries.  YUM!  A keeper!

A great coffee cake recipe.  Simple enough, quick, and 100% gone in under a day.  My son and I made ourselves sick because we couldn't stop eating this cake.  Delicious, moist, and just sweet enough.  I made only two modifications: double called-for topping (I like lots) and a bit longer cooking time for 9X13.  I believe it took about 50-55 minutes.  This is a dangerous item to have available, as I have no self control, so I'll make it when I've got lots of company to impress.  Thank you for this cake recipe Jan, it's super!

Wonderful!!  Very easy to make, too.  I used a Bundt pan (thought it would be prettier), and baked it 60 minutes.  Would do it again (but note that the cake didn't rise as much as you typically see in Bundt pans).  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Very moist and delicious. I added frozen blueberries and used a different crumb topping (1c butter, 1c br sug, 2c flour), but I didn't put a middle layer in. I also added ~1/3c milk because the batter was too thick. I baked it for 60 min. It came out excellent.

Not sure what I am doing wrong but this always comes out really heavy and sticky.  It doesn't puff up like regular coffee cake.  It's almost as if it were underdone despite my adding 10 mins to the cooking time.   I've made this 3 times now hoping things would work out next time.  No luck.

This is delicious and very filling! I ended up swirling the brown sugar mix into the batter and it gave it a neat look. And I did in fact eat it with coffee!

This coffee cake was amazing! I added blueberries to the middle layer for extra flavor. It was a hit. People were actually asking if there was more (sorry... it was all gone). I think next time, I will double the crumb filling. And believe me, there WILL be a next time. A+!

ABSOLUTELY the best coffee cake recipe by far. Look no further.Moist, everything you expected.
I make it every month at least, doesn't last more than 2 days. Even made another one to share with my mother cause my family wouldn't let me share ours.

I baked this to bring to work, and my co-workers LOVED it and asked for the recipe. It is very moist, not soggy at all and a little on the rich side. I followed the directions EXACTLY. Next time, I will just put all of the filling on top to save time.

Just what I was looking for.  I did make the following adjustments:  I was low on butter so used 1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup solid veg. shortening.  Also, I put all of the cinnamon filling on top.  I used the 9x13 pan and baked for 40 min.  It stayed moist for the entire 3 days it existed.  I kept it covered in the fridge and microwaved each piece about 30 seconds before serving.  This is a VERY MOIST cake and does not rise much, so do not expect it to be like a crumbly, fluffy or drier style coffee cake.

This cake is superb! The first time I made this recipe, I made the mistake of greasing AND flouring the pan, which makes it very hard to get the batter to stick to the bottom. I doubled the filling as recommended, but I found it a little too much. The second time I did the filling plus an additional half recipe of it and that worked out much better.

This cake is very good. Its nice and moist, and not too cinnimony. I made this twice, and didnt put the cinni-sugar mixture on top because it was too sweet for my taste. Thanx for submitting this wonderful recipe.

Everyone I served this to raved about it.  I doubled the topping and made it in a 9X9 pan, but it took FOREVER to get done - so long that the topping looked burnt.  But, lo and behold, when we tasted it - it had only carmelized - making it even more delicious.  Next time I will make it in a 9X13 pan, and keep the struesel doubled.

This is one of my favorite cake recipes, everyone loves it. The only problem I have is spreading the second layer of batter on top of the filling, it always sticks to the crumbs but not the batter and I have to smear it all together so the filling layer gets lost. Maybe next time I'll use an 8 x 8 pan as other reviewers suggest, that may help. All in all a terrific recipe, thanks Jan.

I was really happy with this.  I made it in a 9x9 pan, so I baked it an extra ten minutes, and it was perfect.  It was very moist and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Great Recipe!  Made it for breakfast and the whole house loved it.  Pouring the cake into a 9x13 makes it pretty thin.  I might see what happens next time by putting it in a 9x9.  I am a crumb fan as well and reccommend doubling the crumb mixture.

I loved this cake. I subbed sour cream with 2% greek yogurt and also added a sugar glaze. I do not believe the glaze is necessary since this cake is sweet enough on its own. Delicious!

1) Add blueberries
2) 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 butter
3) instead of sour cream, use 1 cup yogurt, 1tsp baking soda, and a squirt of lemon

My husband said, "I don't think I have words for how good this is, other than, I want more!"
I made this is muffin pans and it made about 18 muffins. 
My only changes were adding about 1 cup of Hershey's cinnamon chips to the batter and about 3/4 cup chopped pecans to the crumb filling. The pecans give it a little crunch and the cinnamon chips add just the right amount of mild cinnamon flavor, not too overpowering. 
These muffins were soft and gooey right out of the oven, like old fashioned butter cake. When cooled they are nicely crunchy on the edges and slightly gooey in the center! 
This recipe is definitely a keeper!
One more thing I made this because I had a big tub of sour cream that was on the verge of too sour. I didn't want to throw it out so I was looking for something to bake with it. The cream didn't taste over sour at all, Great use for almost bad sour cream!!!

I thought this was great.  I added 1/2 tsp orange extract to the batter, and then added vanilla and orange extract plus some grated orange rind to the topping.  Gave it a citrus zest!

This is my go-to coffee cake recipe. Though I add chocolate chips! Takes it right over the top! So delicious and moist! I found that the cake was very dense and heavy in the centre, no matter how I amended the review or how long I baked it for. So now I make it as muffins! Some crumble on the bottom, in the middle along with some chocolate chips and on top too! They come out perfect every time!

I used 3/4 cup of olive oil instead of the butter and used 1.5cups of sugar instead of the quantity stated here.  I figured that the filling provided the necessary sugary balance.  Oil was also used in the filling.  I baked it in a bunt cake pan for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  The cake turned out awesome and it was a huge success.  Will definitely bake again.

We absolutely loved the taste of this cake. I wouldn't just wait for breakfast...have it for an afternoon snack! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the filling should be doubled so that it will taste just like a Drakes Coffee Cake (except it doesn't fall apart when you eat it)!!! Yummy!!

This was an excellent coffee cake- as written.  Reminded me of a sourdough coffee cake I used to make years ago when I maintained sourdough starter.  I made this with real soured cream from the farm. Wonderful.  This is not a fluff cake. It is denser, moister, and heavier than most recipies but it was also richer and more complex in flavor.  I did not ice it and it was plenty sweet.  We loved it and the recipe will definitely go into my keeper file when

It seems like it's a keeper :).  Family is enjoying the cake right now.  It is good, though I think it'd be better made in a bit of a smaller pan than a 9x13.  I mean, it's moist but it was hard to spread in the pan, and even harder to spread the 2nd layer of cake on top of the cinnamon mix.  Over all though, it's good and helped me use up some sour cream :).

Most coffee cakes are very dry. But I tried
 this one cause my husband likes coffee cake. Followed all the direction,but looked at the reviews and doubled the topping. This was really moist and delicious. Since I am not a cake eater I did try a piece of it and was really impressed with the moistness. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe it is super.

I thought it would be moister with the sour cream. It wasn't. Flavor almost non-existent except for the crumble. I even tried adding cinnamon, nutmeg and a touch of cardamom to the batter, still wasn't good enough. Most likely will not make again.

I thought this tasted fine but the batter was very, very thick making it nearly impossible to spread the second layer. I tried adding a little water to the second half of the batter before spreading it on top of the filling but it still didn't thin it out very much. Though I bake quite regularly, this was my first coffee cake...maybe the batter is supposed to be thick? I'll try it again and do what other reviewers have suggested: one layer with the entire crumb mixture on top.

I made this exactly as written.  It was excellent.  Other recipes for this type of coffee cake can sometimes be too dry.  This had a nice firm texture that was easy to cut and serve, yet was moist and delicious. Must be all that butter and sour cream.

Great recipe! I used a bunt cake pan and mistakenly used self rising flour but it still turned out GREAT! The cake was super moist and the sour cream gave it a nice tang to compliment the sweet. I will definitely be making this again and soon!

This was too moist for my liking of coffee cakes. It was also very sweet. I added a few chopped walnuts, to the filling. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 because the next day it was much better. My family really enjoyed it.

Very good recipe! I doubled the filling, and added chopped apples, i used a spring form pan, and I end up cooking it for an hr covered in aluminum then 30 mins without...I cook it that long because it always looks wiggly in the middle. Its a very thick and moist cake, I get raves every time I make it!

Very dense and moist coffee cake.  Maybe a little too moist for my taste (and my younger son's taste).  I took it to church for the snack after Sunday school and the entire cake disappeared.  So, it is a winner.  4 stars since I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet.  I also made double the filling/topping, but did not need use all of it so I would recommend sticking to the recipe in that regard.

I think this coffee cake came out really delicious, but it might be just a bit too rich for me (with all that butter).  I made a few changes to the recipe:  used plain yogurt instead of sour cream; made 1-1/2 times the amount of filling/topping; and substituted 1/4 cup of almond flour for the white flour.  I had to bake it an extra 15 minutes, but the result was very good.  And the house smells divine from all the rich cinnamon and butter!!  I will make this again, but maybe try reducing by 1/2 stick of butter.

Made it as is, except I screwed up and used baking soda instead of baking powder.  It made the cake rise more, but it was still delicious!  I think I will make it this way from now on!  It did take longer than the 35-40 minutes.  After 35 minutes, I increased the oven temp to 375 degrees, put tin foil over the top, and baked an additional 20 minutes.

Taste is great...but a 4 star because I think I slighty undercooked this cake. A little dense and "doughy" in the middle....The outside was cooked....just the middle. I did double the cinnamon/sugar/nut/butter mixture so there was pleanty in the middle and on top. Delicious flavor here....just an error on my part. I also made in a 10' springform.... I will try this again. Thanks!

This is my first review ever, but I couldn't let this one pass.  I had never made a crumb cake before and I absolutely LOVED this one! It was so incredibly moist, it's ridiculous.  I substituted the sour cream for plain low fat yogurt to reduce the amount of fat.  The only thing I had trouble with was the topping, which sank to the bottom of my pan.  I read somewhere else that if you let the cake bake for 30 min and then add the crumb topping, it will prevent this from happening, so I'm definitely doing that next time.  Thanks for the recipe! My husband can't get enough of this cake!!

I have  made this cake twice now. The first time I used half margarine, half butter & half splenda, half white sugar, baked it in a 9" springform for 45 mintues. that was WAY too long, came out burnt! So the second time I used all butter and all splenda, added a shredded apple to the center as another reviewer suggested and baked in the same 9" springform this time for 28 minutes and it was perfect! It's a very moist and simple cake. I found the batter was a bit challenging to work with and spread in the pan but if you don't mind getting your hands full of batter then it's perfect!!! Will definitely keep making! Thanks for a great, versatile recipe!

This cake was wonderful! It is sweet, but really hits the spot with some coffee. My only suggestion is rewording 'melted butter' for 'softened butter', as melted butter will make the filling the wrong consistency instead of crumbly as it should be. My entire family loved this and I'm going to make another to take to our church Bible study this evening. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made the changes suggested by another rater: 1 tsp vanilla, 1.5 cups brown sugar.  It was very good, but still a little too sweet with the glaze on top.  The family loved it and asked for another.  I also sprinkled sliced almonds between the layers.  It was very crumbly and moist just like the picture.

One of the best recipes I have used for Coffee Cake. I didn't bother with putting the filling in though. Too difficult as the batter is so thick. It didn't rise very high, so having all the cinnamon sugar on top worked great!

This is really good.  I had to use plain yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had available, and it worked well.  It's pretty rich and sweet, so it is a bit much for just a slice for breakfast or something, but it is a perfect pairing with a cup of tea or coffee.

WOW, So moist!  Best I ever had!  The only thing I changed is I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 coconut oil because our family likes the health benefits of coconut oil.  Also, added a little cinnamon in the batter when mixing.  Baked in a bundt pan.  No need to add any more topping- it was perfect.

Followed recipe exactly except pan (put it in a 11x8).  A bit too sweet and not enough of a salty contrast.  Kids loved it and it did taste yummy.

Unfortunately, the batter was too thick  and it was difficult to spread on the pan. The results were disappointing. The cake did not rise and it was dough-y.

OMG this is AMAZING! I did it in a 9 inch springform pan, and doubled the topping and put it in the middle. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!! It is sweet (especially with the extra topping), but isn't coffee cake suppose to be????

Needed a touch more cooktime.  I added some belgian chocolate chips and walnuts just to improve upon the artery hardening deliciousness of this already wonderful cake.

Awesome cake! We made it in a bundt pan and it tasted great - took a little bit longer to cook through, though (about 45-50 mins). Highly recommend it!

Very good. I halfed the recipe and used a glass square dish. Had to bake a little longer. I wonder how a little apple pie filling would be in the middle? I will make a cream cheese glaze to make this recipe a 5! Thank You!!

I made this recipe along with one other on the website that I had made before and we did a "taste test". This cake has a consistancy of cornbread and was much more dense than the other.  Not my favorite :(

I made this for the 2nd time last night...SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY FIRST ATTEMPT!!!!  I needed a huge coffee cake for a party so I double the recipe and cooked it uncovered for 40min and then layed a piece of foil over the top for another 50min so it wouldnt burn the topping.  After it cooled I drizzled frosting (1c powdered sugar and 1 1/2 Tablespoons milk)....extremely delicious!!!! I definently recommend :)

Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe & baked in an 8" square.  Good thing because I ended up eating the whole thing in about 3 days. I'll make it again after I take off a couple of #'s. It almost has a cheesecake flavor especially if you keep it in the frig.

I ran into a problem.  I had a hard time making spreading it into the pan evenly so it didn't come out as I expected.  The layers were uneven and just didn't look right.  However, the recipe is excellent and I will definetly make it again.

I made this and took it to work.  Everyone seemed to liked it and said that it's very moist.  For me, it's a little sweet so I will cut down the sugar on this recipe next time and will use some blueberries.  Otherwise, it's pretty good.

made this Christmas morning. along with quiche for the family.  It was delicious and easy to make.  The batter was very thick and I think next time I'll make a little extra struesel to put on top and maybe a little less butter and sugar in batter.  But will def make again

WOW.  This stuff should come with a warning on it!  Unbelievably delicious when made exactly to the recipe specs.  I am super picky about coffee cake, and this one is the best I have ever eaten.  Can't wait to add fresh berries when they are in season!  WONDERFUL!

I have tried many recipes from this site but never taken the time to stop to review one...until now!  OMG!  This cake was dreamy.  I didn't have any butter and had to substitute margarine.  We did reduce the amount to 1/2c instead of the listed 1 cup of butter.  We also used another reviewers tip and added 1/4c more sour cream to make up for the butter.  It was, by far, the best coffee cake we have ever eaten! I may try this with light sour cream to cut some fat and calories but it was worth the splurge!

Good coffee cake. Only issue, thought the sugar was too much , so I cut it down to 1 cup as I was adding sliced apples as a topping. Turned out wonderful!

This cake is sooooo good!! Very very moist. I love the filling, definitely don't double it, it would be way too sweet! But wow, the actual cake is amazing!! I might cut out the filling mixture entirely, the cake was that good alone! Oh, and I baked mine in a tube pan, so I had to add about 15 minutes to the baking time. I just checked every 5 minutes to see how it was coming along.

I made this twice just as written, except the second time I didn't have any sour cream, so I used buttermilk and a little extra butter. Both times it was super moist with just the right amount of tang to balance the sweetness. I want to try it again using blueberries or other fruit, but the recipe really is fine as is!

This recipe is fantastic.  I have made 3 times with minor adjustments each time to find the perfect cake.  I have discovered a few things... 1) the butter needs to be softened properly (don't try to rush it if the butter is still too cold.) 2) I recommend cake flour instead of all-purpose for the cake (I still use all purpose for the topping.)  The cake flour gives it a lighter texture that really does make a dramatic difference in the finished product.  3) I still haven't found the perfect baking time:  I did convection at 325 for about 35 minutes (not done enough) and 340 for 40 minutes (a bit.)  So next I'll try Convection 325 for 45 minutes. 4) I also doubled the recipe for the topping but had some left over -- used maybe 1.5x.

Incredible! Hands down the best coffee cake I have ever tasted. Like other's, I doubled the topping, which I found to be perfect.  The longer this cake sits, the better it gets.  I made this for the office and there was not a crumb left. Everyone raved about it.

I did make some subs and this turned out to be the best coffee cake I've ever had!  I used 1/2 c + 2 T butter and 1/2 c unsweeteneed applesauce for 1/2 the sour cream.  I also used about 1/2 cup 1% milk.  I used 1/2 the white sugar, 1/2 t salt and I added 1 t baking soda so it rose nicely.  Finally, I added some mixed berries (just about 1/2 cup) to the middle streusel layer.  For the streusel, I used 3 T butter and added extra cinnamon.  FANTASTIC!

I followed everybody else by doubling the topping.I thought it was a little to much topping and a little dry.The taste was good though.So the next time i will try a little less topping and not bake it as long.

This is a huge hit everytime I make it.  It is so moist!  I have never strayed from the original recipe.

The first coffee cake I've ever baked...and the last. I will never try another recipe after trying this one. It was absolutely perfect as written and I get asked for it again and again. Thanks Jan!

I made this today in the 9 x 11 pan and was worried that it would be too skimpy.  It wasn't at all.  I cut the butter in half, but made the recipe as written except I put all of the streusel filling in the middle and then topped it with my own crumbs.  I couldn't stop eating it!

This is VERY GOOD!  It's true that it is very moist.  I would have preferred a little more of the filling.

I am giving this 5 stars for taste and for being a moist cake.  I think 2 sticks of butter was too much so I used 1 stick.  My batter was thick.  I will add a touch of water or milk next time to replace for the lost butter.  Overall, I am going to keep this recipe.

This is the best I have ever made.....it is wonderful and moist. NO changes were made other than tripling the topping. Great and easy recipe! Thank you:) Update* I made this in loaf pans for bread to give away, worked wonderfully! I made over triple the topping and it was even better than the first batch!

WOW was this good - so moist and rich.  This keeps very well in the fridge and is great heated up briefly in the microwave.  I will definitely use this recipe again when i have extra sour cream lying around.

Absolutely Awesome.  The only thing that I'll do different next time is add more filling like others have suggested.  My husband said it was "" good.  I gave some to my parents and they were totally impressed as well.  My non-dairy allergic kids raved about it's taste as well.  I'd have to say that this is my most favorite cake ever.  And that's really saying something, because I've made some pretty awesome cakes.  Thanks to whom submitted it.

Very moist, buttery and chewey edges.  This is very sweet so I will probably cut out some sugar next time.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and found there was enough crumb topping for my taste.  The only problem I had was that it took at least 50 minutes in a 350 oven using a 9x13 pan as suggested.  I kept checking it and the middle just would not cook.  I've never had that happen before so I just kept an eye on it and hoped for the best.  I'll definitely make this again.

I was a little disappointed with this cake. There was very little rise in the cake (I made sure not to overmix the batter so I don't think it could have been that), and I found it way too sweet. It's not a bad cake for a real sweet-tooth, but I like more of a soft, moist, crumby coffee cake, and this was very dense and sugary.

This was a good coffee cake.  I did use low fat sour cream. Everyone at work raved about it. They didn't believe that I made it from scratch.  They were trying to figure out my "secret".  I thought it was good, but not the best I ever had.  I might make it again.  I did make one as a bunt cake and one in a 9x13 pan.  The bunt took about 20 min longer to cook.

This coffe cake was awesome!! I didn't quite have a full cup of sour cream, so I used some plain yogurt to make a full cup. I use plain yogurt interchangebly with sour cream in a lot of my baking recipes and it always turns out just as good!!! I've even used vanilla yogurt in my banana bread recipe before because I had no plain- still awesome! so I think that is a handy tip for people. Also I made double the filling/topping because I really like filling and topping!! and it was excellent! My husband and I loved it! It was so moist and flavorful. I will definatly make this again!

I'm throwing out all my other coffee cake recipes!  This is SO moist and flavorful, it's worth all the calories it has.  I halved the recipe so it we didn't indulge too much!
The only changes I made was to double the topping (but it would be good with the correct amount too) and double the vanilla.  I accidentally undercooked it a little, but it turned out nice and gooey. I would do that again next time.

Let me just say I've been making this recipe (or very similar) since I was two w/ my mother, and now every holiday season for my husband and family. It’s really a no fail. Also, this is a fairly unhealthy little treat but I've made it on many occasions using just SMART BALANCE butter substitute(half works as well)- it does very well; however, it is less crumbly/rich but its taste is still so good I use it to "persuade" butter-purists(butter is fatty and margarine will kill you). People in high altitude also need to watch their flour- I usually use the standard additional ¼ cup to prevent collapse.

I followed some other user suggestions on this recipe. I used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup applesauce (for the 1 cup butter). I used only 1.5 cups of white sugar (instead of the 2 cups). I used 2 cups whole wheat bran flour (instead of the 2 cups all purpose). I added ~1 cup of walnuts to my topping/filling and I didn't melt the margarine that I used for the topping. I baked it in a 9" springform pan. I find that the discrepancy in how long to bake it for is terrible though. I started at 40 minutes, added 20 more, and then added another 15! I'm very surprised no burning occurred, but it didn't burn at all.

All in all, a pretty good cake for my first coffee cake. I am going to drizzle some leftover caramel sauce onto it!

this was delightful! I made some changes like adding a cup of chcolate chips to the filling, and using 2 tablespoons of cinnamon instead of only 1 teaspoon. It was so very moist and tasty, Hard to eat only one piece!

I have been using this recipe since early 2003!!  I love it!  I have modified the recipe by adding a can of fruit in the middle.  I have used Apples, Cherries, Blueberries and Raspberries.  The Raspberries and Blueberries make it too sweet in my opinion.  Everyone that has eaten this absolutely loves it and begs for the recipe!!

I chose to make this recipe because I had sour cream that was going to expire. I read some of the reviews and added my own modifications to them to create a slightly different and more healthy cake. I used 1/2 c butter and two 3.9 oz all natural applesauce (kids single serving size), 1 cup fat free sour cream, 1/2 cup egg beaters, 1/4 cup - not packed - splenda brown sugar, and just under 3/4 cup splenda white baking sugar, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/2  cup AP flour and added cinnamon in the batter as well. I used a springform pan, which I sprayed with Pam, placed 1/2 the batter in, peeled a granny smith apple (I wanted thin layers) over the first layer of batter, sprinkled the apples with cinnamon, and topped with the remaining batter. After about 30 minutes of cooking, I made the crumble topping with butter, not melted, flour, brown and white sugar (I rarely measure but quantities are similar to the orginal recipe), and continued cooking the remaining 20 minutes or so. The cake was INCREDIBLY moist and delicios and gone the first night (OK, family of four are pigs!)Thanks for the recipe!

Moist, delicious, excellent!!! I added blueberries to mine (I had to do something with them before they went bad) and it was so delicious! I love the texture and the cinnamon/sugar struesel topping. I will definetly make this again, both plain and also adding different berries, nuts, etc. This is the perfect coffee cake recipe; tasty and wonderfully versatile. Oh, I will add that I wound up having to cook this for 1hr 20 min, but, as always with baking, take a recipe's *suggested* cooking time as more of a guideline, and not a definite rule.

Very good, moist and fluffy!! I do not like this dense cakes that stick to your mouth, so this one's a keeper for me. Added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup black coffee, just to see what happened... tasted like white coffee, lol. Give this a try, it's worth it!!

Delicious--and even better the second day!  I whipped the butter for a while and slowly added the sugar--then whipped that for a while longer.  Made the cake the consistency I like.  Pretty much made as is, except cut sugar to 1.5 cups (don't like things that are too sweet) and increased vanilla to 1 teaspoon.  It's a very moist cake and so easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

this coffee cake passed the true test, the batter was delicious!  I also cut the butter in half, increased the amount of 'lite' sour cream that I used, and cut the sugar some as well.

Excellent coffee cake.  Very dense and moist.  I doubled the crumb topping as well and had to cook it about 10 minutes more.  Made it in a bundt pan and put nuts on top!  Also cut the sugar to a cup.

i modified it just a bit by substituting the sour cream, one egg and a little of the butter for two individual yogurts (i used dried fruit and nuts with honey flavor) and it came out fantastic but just as a warning it took a while to bake so add the crumb topping twenty or thirty minutes into it so that it doesnt burn.  the yogurt makes it much healthier and even moister and richer.

this is a really moist and delicious cake. whenever I make it people keep comming back for fourth and fiveth helpings. I find that it is also very good with some diced apples or other fruit. Also it makes a great bread pudding or french toast for those special mornings. i folded teh crumble mixture into the batter instead of doing the layers.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling the filling/topping and it was definitely sweet and rich--perhaps too much so for some.  I would make this again.

This cake has the same texture and taste of the coffee cake my grandmother used to make.  Thanks for giving me a little culinary reminder of my grandmother!  This cake was great- I sprayed the bundt pan with baker's joy, threw some extra cinnamon in the batter- along with some walnuts and cooked it about an hour total.  It's delicious!  YUM!!  Thanks!

This had exceptional flavor. I did it in a bunt pan. The only problem that I had was I should have swirled the mixture in for the middle of the cake. When I popped out the cake it broke in half. All in all this cake was wonderful. I did double the filling, since I love that sweet crunchy topping. Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper!

YUM!  This is really delicious...but I've never met a recipe that I didn't change, just a little.  I reduced the white sugar in the cake part of this by 1/2 (made it 1c) and din't miss it AT ALL.  Probably because I also doubled the topping/filling.  I added chopped walnuts to topping also. I baked it in a round cake pan instead of square and found that it took longer than specified.  I'm not a clock watcher, but I'm going to say it took closer to an hour.  Great recipe - will make it again for sure.

This will be the recipe I use for coffee cake from now on. I read the other reviews before making it and only used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and it turned out great. I can't wait to make this again!

I used a bundt pan, 1/2 cup of buttermilk, and put all the filling in between the two layers of cake vs. dividing the filling in half.  Baked it 45 minutes, and discovered that this is the coffee cake I have been searching for!  Great recipe!

I didn't actually try the finished product because my mouth was numb from a trip to the dentist, but I brought this in for my class and everyone loved it. It smell heavenly and it looked great. The only thing I changed was decreasing the cooking time to 30 min.

DELICIOUS!!!  Forget famous coffee houses' coffee cakes.  Everyone that tries it loves it.  Me and my husband eat it for breakfast... and also for dessert! Edit: This recipe works in high altitude! I didn't change anything, except I used 1 tsp vanilla (home made).  I baked it in a 13x9 Temp-tations dish. Delish!!

Fantastic moist cake.  A bit on the sweet side, so I'll cut down on the sugar next time.  I used nutmeg instead of cinnamon, and a 9" round pan (bake for 1 hr).

Good, but very sweet.  Next time(if I make this again) I will cut down on the sugar topping.  I baked this in a bundt pan for 55 minutes, it was moist but way too sweet for us. I liked the Jewish Coffee Cake recipe off this site much more.

I did an ingredient search for something I could make for breakfast without using milk and this was what popped up. It was very delicious. Even though everyone says it is moist, I have to reiterate it. This cake is amazingly moist and I loved the hint of sour cream. This is not something I necessarily would have picked on my own but I am really glad I discovered it. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.

Excellent!  Tastes just like NY coffee cake!  I'll only change one thing - I'll double the amount of topping - there just wasn't enough!

This recipe was so easy to make!  I made it for a party at work and it was a hit!  It was very moist, and did not take a lot of time to bake!  I would make it again, and again, and again...!

I love trying new recipes and was very excited to try this one after reading the reviews. After making this recipe, I was very disappointed. The only word that comes to mind is that it was  lacking in taste. I will stick with my mother-in-laws recipe in the future.

This cake was very bland and the texture was too fine, almost soggy.  Even after making all the adjustments suggested, the best thing about it was the topping.

I like this coffee cake but I did as other recommended and used a 9 X 9 pan and baked it for 50 - 55 minutes.  I also added shredded apple and dates to the filling.  Very tasty!

How did this recipe get so many rave reviews? I can only imagine that it was due to brilliant chefs who adapted the recipe and achieved better results than I did (making the cake as the recipe direct). Very bland, and kind of soggy (yes, I _did_ bake it long enough). Perhaps it needs more baking powder? It did not have a nice texture and the decent flavor wasn't enough to make up for that failing.

This cake is very good. Easy to make and lasts long and stays moist for the whole time.  Not too sweet, for those who don't want anything too sweet.

Oh My Gosh!  This cake is soooo good!  I doubled the filling and was glad I did!  I brought it to church and the guys were going nuts!  Love it!! 

Update:  After making this recipe countless times, one of the main things in making this perfect is to allow the cake to cook fully --meaning, don't take it out until there are NO crumbs that come out on the tester (i.e. toothpick).  unlike other cakes, where a few crumbs are ok, i've found that this cake is better when there aren't any...unless you like it a bit doughy in the center....which, i don't. :)

I hate to say this, but I agree with some that the sour cream gave it a weird taste. It is an interesting recipe but unfortunately, not my taste.

Very good, easy cake to make. I doubled the filling/topping, but probably didn't need to. I may add some nutmeg to the cake the next time I make it. Tastes better eaten warm, so I just microwave it for a few seconds. very good!

I made this for a breakfast at work that I usually just buy donuts or muffins for.  I liked this and will probably make it again.  Next time, however, I would double the cinnamon and possibly the filling as I like pretty strong spices.

Absolutely wonderful.  I had very short notice to bring something in to work, this was quick, easy, and perfectly delicious.  I used a 9 X 13 pan with double crumbs and received so many compliments I had to send the recipe link to my whole team!!!

I'm not much of a coffee cake lover but I had a huge tub of sour cream to use up so I thought I would try out this recipe.  It was really good.  I drizzled a little cream cheese frosting on the top for an extra touch.

Excellent recipe.  I TRIPLED the filling/topping for extra crumbs!!  Didn't think there was enough batter for a 9x13 pan so I tried an 8x8 and it didn't cook properly.  A 9x9 pan works out perfectly. I also added 1tsp. cinnamon to the batter.

This coffee cake is very moist with a fantastic flavor and texture.  I served this to friends and they all enjoyed it. I am personally not a big cinnamon crumb topping fan, so next time, I am going to stir some mini chocolate chips into the batter and swirl some raspberry jam on the top.

This is a great coffee cake!  It's so moist unlike a lot of other coffee cakes.  Next time I'll probably add chopped nuts and/or raisins in the middle of the cake for a change.

I’ve made this a couple of times and the last time I used almond extract and lightly browned the butter before using it in the recipe. It was wonderful!!  
I definitely recommend trying it this way if you just want a little change but make no mistake the recipe is good just as it is too!

OK, I do confess to substituting brown sugar for white in the actual cake; don't hate me for reviewing anyway!  The cake was moist and had good flavor, though it wasn't anything special.  We all liked it, and I'd be willing to make it again, but it wasn't outstanding.

I made this coffee cake after reading other reviews - I cut the butter in calf, and added 1/4 c more sour cream.  I also added 1/2 tsp baking soda; doubled the filling, which I added chopped nuts to.  The cake was bland, and super heavy.  Very disappointing.  I cooked it in a bundt pan, so it baked a little longer than the recipe called for.  Definitely won’t make this one again.

Perfection!  I made it in a 9x13 pan and baked it about 10 minutes longer.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It's delicately delicious.

I’ve made this three times now with three different variations of filling or topping. I used a bundt pan and the time was 55 min. The first time was as the recipe was written with extra topping and it was perfect. I love how moist it is!  The second time I added blueberries to the batter and it too was awesome. Now on my third time, I put 2 teaspoons of lemon juice in the batter and dollops of homemade raspberry jam on top of batter with no topping. It’s still in The oven but I’m confident it will turn out perfect! Next time I’m going to try adding some chocolate to the batter to make chocolate cake and some kind of filling for that one. Maybe custard!

This cake tasted good, but it was too light and fluffy for coffee cake. I wanted it to be denser. Also, the topping didn't come out especially well, and I don't think there was enough of it. I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone else loved it, so I might make it again and double the topping.

Amazing! Cut the butter almost in half and was still super moist. I made it in an all edge brownie pan and it was such a game changer! Highly recommend.

I made this in the 9 x 13 pan with the only change being making it in one layer rather than putting some topping in the middle between two layers. It has a lovely, white-cake like texture. It’s sweet but, if you don’t go overboard and add more topping, it’s not too sweet. I liked it and would make it again.

I remember my moms sour cream coffee cake when I was growing up-it was great! This one surpasses hers!! (Sorry Mom) I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it and this will be my go to from now on. Excellent! The second time I made it in a tube pan and was just as amazing .

I followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I didn’t bother to layer the filling, just sprinkled it all on top.  Also, this cake is a pretty thin cake, there is just no way to spread half the batter in a 9x13 pan!  I spread all of the batter in a 9x13 pan to get just a thin cake.  Anyhow, the flavor was good, but just not great.  I will probably not make again.

I used whole fat yogurt (just what I had);  cut the sugar to 1.25 cup and it was still plenty sweet with the crumble. 

Very yummy and moist. 

As written would have been way too sweet!

Hands down best coffee cake. Tastes EXACTLY like my grandmas recipe but is ten times easier. As per the other reviews, I doubled the crumble and it was perfect. My family can’t get enough of it.
Sure to impress if you ever have company. 
I saw a suggestion of doing more sour cream and less butter. I just may try that.

Great recipe as written, but if you want to dramatically lower the cholesterol and saturated fat, yet still have a VERY rich, flavorful coffee cake, use:

 1/2 c butter instead of 1 c (1 stick instead of 2), 1/2 c vegetable oil, and fat free sour cream instead.

You can write me back when you taste how good it is!  Your heart will thank you for it.  :)  By the way, I also added a pinch of salt to the crumble part, which made it much yummier!

Made as directed and it was extremely tasty. Slightly too sweet so I will reduce the white sugar in the cake batter next time but I will definitely make again. This is my new standard coffee cake recipe.

I made this the first time exactly as written, and it was really good.  It is very moist, and pretty tasty.  The second time, I made some changes to the recipe, because where I live (Guatemala) I can't always get all the ingredients.  I added about a cup of sliced almonds to the topping for some extra zing, and everyone loved it.  When I make it again, and I WILL make it again, I will probably cut back on the cup of butter and the cup of sour cream, replacing some if it with either apple sauce or a peach sauce for both flavor and fewer calories.  Tonight I have nothing left but a cake pan to wash and some plates with crumbs.

I made it without any alterations and it turned out really good, but not quite what I was looking for. It's a very dense, moist cake. I think I would use less butter next time but I would definitely make it again.

I didn't make any changes as this is the first time I made it.  I think I may add more melted butter to the Streusel  topping next time.  But is is really delicious and the batter turns out so light!

Easy recipe with directions, I made this recipe as is with one exception.  Adding chopped pecans, placing 3/4 cup on top.  Next time, and there will be a next time,  I will add 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans divided equally between the layers and as the topping.  My husband enjoyed this recipe along with his morning coffee.

I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, mostly because I wasn't sure I had enough sour cream. It turned out amazing. Perfectly fluffy and lots of flavor. Will probably be my go-to coffee cake recipe.

I just made this cake and hooboy! It's really amazing. 
I added more salt than the recipe called for (1/2 tsp in the cake batter and 1/4 tsp. In the topping) and I think it really needed it. 
I also baked it in 4 inch round paper baking cups for 25 minutes. The recipe made 8 individual cakes. 
Let me tell you, it's just a super-moist, slightly tangy, crunchy and indulgent coffee cake. MUCH better than Ina Garten's recipe for sour cream coffee cake (which is baked in tube pan, and just lacks all the moisture and scrumptiousness of this cake), which I made three weeks ago. 
Definitely a great cake to give as gifts. I am bringing some to my sister, who is nine months pregnant and it will undoubtedly make her day!

I loved this recipe. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and to make it more interesting I added guava jam to the cake batter and it makes a beautiful combination. I used cream cheese frosting in between the layers and made kind of a naked cake. It is now a family favorite!

The only thing I would like to say is after you have all layered into the pan; I think a butter knife should be used to swirl through the mixers to blend it up just a little bit.

Very easy and moist.  I would recommend to follow direction!!!  I did add 1/3 cup of chopped pecans to toppings mixer.  I listened to someone else who said to use oil in batter instead of butter and to double the crumble mixture.  Do not do that !  Please follow this recipe.

I just finished making this coffee cake an hour ago. How delicious it is!! I followed the recipe exactly and I baked it in a 9 by 13 glass pan. It turned out perfectly. I did have to bake it 45 minutes, but it turned out beautifully. Moist and not too sweet, it will be perfect for my family and me. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with the exception of cooking it in a 9 inch springform pan for an hour.  Although I tested it with a toothpick, there were parts of the cake that were a bit under cooked.  Next time I will cook for 10-15 minutes longer.   I would also make the following changes as recommended by many reviewers....double to crumb filing and reduce the sugar.  This was a bit on the sweet side for me.  The kids and I loved it, but my husband said he prefers a lighter, more fluffy kind of coffee cake.  This is kind of a cross between a pound cake and coffee cake.  Still great, thanks for the recipe!

I made this and it was good.... I did double to crumb and used a 9 X 9 pan and baked 55 min....I noticed the lower ratings on this recipe and it's probably because you're looking for a true New York Style Coffee or Crumb Cake with a mile high topping.  That's just  the crumb cake I grew up with and there is nothing better to me. .. I searched for the perfect recipe and have been using the best ever from browneyedbaker.com--New York Style Crumb Cake... for years...  My family really enjoyed this treat... Thank you for sharing....

I added the extra 1/2 tsp of baking powder, used an 8x10 glass dish for 45 minutes and it baked perfectly.  I think doubling the filing was a little much and I'll cut back on that next time.

made this 3x so far just as it is stated 2x. I wanted a little more crumb mixture so I added one half of the crumble recipe to the original and that seems to be great for us. Either way, it is absolutely delicious! This was my 1st coffee cake recipe I used and it is so much simpler than I anticipated. VERY MOIST!

Made this as written--and I honestly won't change a thing when I DEFINITELY make this again. The batter itself is absolutely delicious and I found myself licking the spoon (which I really haven't done since standing in my Mom's kitchen at the approximate age of 11). 

I had my doubts while making it--there didn't seem to be enough batter to make a thicker cake, and there especially didn't seem to be enough topping . I'm used to coffee cake with a continuous layer of cinnamon topping--this was, as other reviewers have stated, more of a sprinkling. It wasn't until I tasted it that I knew it was just right--the perfect amount of sweetness.

While it was cooking, it smelled so amazing that as soon as I took it out and it was cool enough, I cut off two one-inch cubes--one for my fiance and one for me. Then another. And another. And another. Considering that this was WHILE dinner was cooking, I think that should tell you something about how delicious it was.

The changes I made to the recipe is halving the recipe to fit a loaf pan and using cake flour. The cake fell flat so I might double up on the baking powder next time. It was very soft and moist, but VERY sweet even though I didn't add the filling (only topped it with half the filling); I might decrease the sugar by 2 tbsp next time.

This was a very good coffee cake. The only change I made is that i didn't layer it and I subbed plain greek yogurt for the sour cream. The batter was very thick, so I spread it all in a 9 X 13 and added the topping and pressed the topping gently into the batter. I did add another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping because I really like cinnamon. 
Very good recipe. Will use again.

Awesome! 1st time I made it according to recipe and loved it. Wanted to make it again but I didn't have all the ingredients so I used buttermilk instead of sour cream , added 1/4 cup flour to offset liquid amount, used 1TSP almond extract and 1 Tsp vanilla, and baked in a bunt pan for approximately 45 mins. Also used 1.5 of topping/ filling recipe. Also awesome. Thanks for this great recipe that really is customizable.

Very good.  I made it as written the first time and found it to be moist and very tasty.  Because we like a lot of the crumbly filling/topping, I doubled that part of the recipe when making it again.  Also great baked in cupcake pans.

Awesome! At 5000 feet, I added 1/3 cup more flour  (it was consistency of frosting before baking) and baked it for 45 minutes. Super moist.

We love this coffee cake!  If you want to make a gluten - free  version, you can substitute 1/2 cup brown rice flour, 1/2 cup sorgum flour, 3/4 cup arrowroot flour or corn starch, 1/4 cup sticky white rice flour and 1 tsp. xanthan gum.

I made exactly like the recipe.  It was OK, but not over the moon.   Lacked a punch of flavor and came out a bit too fluffy for a good coffee cake.  I will try it again, but this time read some of the tweets suggested.

This doesn't taste exactly like normal coffee cake, but I think it's better! I also drizzled cream cheese icing on top and my family loved it!

Wonderful! Baked it in a cast iron skillet (12 inch) and added a little bit of Maple Extract with the Vanilla.

I learned this recipe 2 yrs ago. It is very moist and versatile. I was out of flour so I substituted cake flour (1 1/2 c.) cornmeal and flour to make up .  Then I poured it over fruit and brown sugar. Turned out great!

I just made this with two edits: I used half the white sugar ( 1 c instead of 2c) as I wanted a less sweet version.  I also used plain Greek yogurt 2% instead of the sour cream as that is all I had.  It came out very moist, still quite sweet, buttery and a little flatter than I was expected.  If I made it again, I would use 9x9 pan and replace half butter with apple sauce.  The reduced white sugar and yogurt substitution worked really well and I would recommend.

I made this recipe as is. The batter is quite thick and it is challenging to spread on the second half of the batter. The cake turned out very moist. I was surprised that some made this in a 9x9 pan because the cake puffed up very high while in the oven. I dont think it would have stayed in a smaller pan. The cake slowly falls to normal as it cools.  The only thing wrong with this recipe is that it is so good you cant stop eating it!

I have yet to eat this, but my review is from the feedback I received from the one I did make that I sent to work with my husband. The cake turned out very moist, and I was told I need to bake a bunch of these cakes and sell them outside where my husband works. My husband requested his own cake that I will be making for him today. I didn't change a thing from the original recipe, although today I will probably double the filling amount as advised by some other reviews. Thanks for a great recipe!

The center was fully baked according to my cake tester, but it was wet and gloppy. The tiny corner I tasted was WAY too sweet.

I thought this was great! I only made half the recipe (although I made the full amount of crumb topping) My family devoured it! The only change I made was I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I had on hand. I did think it had a little to much of a buttery taste, so next time I'll cut down on the butter, but that didn't ruin it for me.

It's a great coffee cake! Moist and delicious. 
I might try a bit less butter next time; I'm not sure that much was necessary, and it might make it a little less dense. But it's really great as is, if you don't mind all those fat calories! :-) 
I might also add just a bit more salt next time. Perhaps a 1/2 tsp instead of 1/8.

This was easy and deeeelicious! Calls for 9x13, I used 8x8 and 6 muffin pan.  I added quartered fresh cranberries to cake, and shredded coconut to filling. Very elegant dessert - they'll think you SLAVED over it :)

Made many, many times with this slight alteration:  cut the white sugar in half.  You don't need it.  Then double the topping recipe and add a little powdered cardamon to it.  Perfect.

I made this as written with one exception - I ran out of vanilla extract so I used the seeds from 1 vanilla bean instead. I thought the cake was slightly to sweet (and I like sweets!) and there was not enough topping. I made it in a 9x9 pan and it came out well, though had to cook it a little longer. My batter was REALLY thick - maybe I beat the butter and sugar together too long/ much or was everyone's that way? The cake part came out with fabulous texture though so other than the challenge of spreading the batter, it was fine. I might make this again but I'll make adjustments to it. I'd say it's about 2/3 of the way to being like Starbuck's traditional coffee cake.

Followed directions exactly. Was a little concerned about fitting the batter in a 9 x 13 pan, but it worked. Directions say cook for 35-40 minutes: I had to leave mine in an extra 20 minutes in a conventional oven to cook properly. Cake rose nicely. Many reviews suggest doubling filling/topping. I think doubling would have been too much. I could have used a little more for the topping: I wasn't able to cover the cake completely. My husband and I both are happy with the outcome. Good coffee cake.

Well, it needed much longer of a cook time.  I baked it for 35 minutes and it seemed really undercooked.   I then added an additional 15 minutes.  I allowed the cake to cool, and then cut into it and it still seemed half raw :(.  I was really disappointed about this, since I was making it for company.  I had to put it back into the oven for 15 more minutes at 400 degrees while our company was waiting.  Very embarrassing.  I took it out and let it cool for 15 mins.  Still, it seems very undercooked, especially in the centre.  I put it back in the oven with tin foil over top at 200 degrees for 20 more minutes.  The whole experience was just an ordeal.  I'll try another recipe next time.

Extremely moist and flavorful. A bit on the rich side, but for a special breakfast with eggs, bacon and all that good stuff we save for special occasions, this was perfect. Happy family!

The BEST coffee cake ever.  I make it for my honey with whole wheat pastry flour, flax meal, and I double the topping.  YUM!  Thanks so much!

I followed the recipe exactly and used the 9 x 13 pan.  I thought I would never get the batter to spread evenly in the pan, but finally it did after the batter softened up a bit.  I think if I make this again I will cut the sugar in the batter to 1 1/2 cups .  It is very moist but it is awfully sweet. Too sweet even with a cup of coffee.

Delicious.  The cake is very moist and the topping gives it some crunchiness.  I took the advice of some others and doubled the topping and added about 3/4 cup chopped pecans to the mixture.  Fabulous!!

batter was as stiff as cookie dough. Needed a rolling pin to roll it out in the reccomdended pan. (my mother who also made this had the same issue). So I had to add some milk to make more the consistency of cake batter. It came out alright. I've had better.

I followed the recipe and when I removed it from the oven, the center was liquid. I put it back in the oven and baked for 45 minutes more. Still, the outside was done but the center was not. I must say, the edges were delicious, I just wish the entire thing had baked properly.

Wonderful flavor, but boy does it dry out quickly.  When first out of the oven it was the best coffee cake I had ever tasted next to my Mom's (of Finnish decent) but the next day it was so dry we weren't happy at all even tho it was put into an air tight container overnight.

Family favorite.  I made the mistake of using all the struesel on middle layer the first time I made it so I had to make another 1/2 batch for the topping.  Now, I always make extra!!!

I found this coffee cake to be very moist and really good. Just a little sweet for me but my boyfriend loved it! He has more of a sweet tooth than I do. I made the recipe as written and think it is only fair to rate and write a review based on following a recipe to a tee. I will definitely make this again. It was easy too. Thanks Jan!

I just made this recipe this morning for my Mother and her company.  The only change I made was to double the filling/topping. Our company RAVED over it!  It was gone by the end of the visit!  My Mother even asked me to make another tomorrow morning for more company that is coming. I was a bit worried about the middle being done but it turned out perfect.

The taste is nice but the consistency is doughy.  The edges cooked nicely and crunchy but the middle was way too doughy (and I baked it longer than it called for).  I will not do it again.

Fantastic recipe.  So moist with the butter and sour cream.  I used the vanilla glaze recipe from this site to drizzle over the top.  I also made 12 muffins and a mini loaf cake out of this recipe.  We love these!

The flavor of this cake is great, but I made it for a work event and really, really should have read the reviews first.  It definitely needed more filling and topping.  Looked spotty and sort of weird.  Also was definitely more bar height instead of cake height.  I ended up not feeling like I could serve them since they looked short and spotty.  Next time would at least make more topping and probably use smaller pan.

SO good! used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar in the cake mixture, only 3/4 of the butter called for and put in a smaller pan for thickness.  The hubby is requesting another one already!

I would definately cut back on how much sugar goes into the batter. Just a little too sweet especially when you add the streusel. I also do not suggest using a bundt cake pan. It has a tendancy to over cook the outer layer and the middle with the streusel doesn't get quite done. Overall though a great cake just too sweet.

wonderful and so moist!!  almost hard to find the words to describe how good it was.  i would double the topping and i added pecans to the topping.  i also did a light glaze on top of the cake too.

Fabulous! I have received a pledge of undying affection because of this cake! I did tweak it a bit. Substituted I Can't Believe It's Not Butter for the butter, used low-fat sour cream, cut out a cup of white sugar, quadrupled the vanilla, increased the baking powder by 1/2 tsp., doubled the cinnamon, added a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the topping and increased the topping amount by a third. I also ended up having to add about 2 tbsp of milk to the batter to thin it out a bit. Should be about the consistency of cream cheese frosting (soft temporary peaks) Ok, I tweaked it a lot. I can't help it. I think I'll post the modifications :) It's a bit much for the review format

Fabulous just the way it is.  I didn't change a thing except add 1/2t. more baking powder because I read it didn't rise well.  The amount of topping is perfect and I do think it would be way too sweet if I added more.

This is really yummy! The sour cream taste is quite prevalent though. Make sure you bake it in the right size dish. Mine was a little too small and the middle didn't cook quite as nice as I'd hoped for. I will try this again though. Its a great way to use up leftover sour cream and is amazing with some berries thrown in!

This cake is fabulous.  My husband has always been a huge fan of the Starbucks coffee cake, and he couldn't stop raving about this!  It stayed moist and delicious, and was completely finished within a couple days.  The only adjustment I made was to use Light sour cream.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I sampled this coffee cake when a friend's mom made it.  It was so good that I made sure to get recipe directions.  When I made it the batter was quite thick, so I added milk, tablespoon by tablespoon until the consistency seemed right to me; all in all I added ½ cup.  I brought a Sour Cream Coffee Cake to a party and boy - did it disappear fast! I looked up the origin of this recipe and found it here.  Thanks to Jan Taylor for submitting it!!

This is such a forgiving recipe! I didn't wait for my butter to get to room temperature. I used grey sea salt that was too chunky (didn't have reg. salt). Even with these "user" errors, the coffee cake was fantastic. I can't wait to make it again correctly :-) Yum, yum, yum!!!!

The recipe on its own was fabulous, the only change I made originally was for convenience (had greek yogurt but no sourcream).  The second time I made this I added apple pie filling(chopped up) from the can into the cake park and did the rest as the recipe calls, It was amazing, the best applecake recipe I ever made, supermoist

This recipe is fantastic, very easy to make. I tweeked the recipe using cake flour in place of all-purpose flour. It is so good, it only lasts a few days.

My 16-year-old is crazy about this - I cut back the butter and added more sour cream - in order not to get another measuring cup dirty I just use a 12 oz container or guess at the amount from a big container of sour cream.  I put blueberries in the topping and they liked that also.

I tried!  Had some sour cream almost out of date so looking for a recipe for something easy, found this.  Sorry, it was very dense for some reason. Did it in an 8x8 pan (there are 2 of us) and it really got dark around the edges before the center was done.  It does taste great!  Just not moist and fluffy like we love in a coffee cake.

This was very good, but I think I would use a smaller pan next time.  I found it difficult to get half of the batter to completely cover the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan.  I also had to bake mine for quite a bit longer than the recipe stated.

Dove into this recipe without a total ingredient check. Short on butter (1/2 cup) added an extra 1/4 cup sour cream as in another review. Started the filling and found I was out of cinnamon so stirred a tablespoon of poppy seeds into the batter. Finished the filling as directed minus the cinnamon. Fantastic results!

This is the best coffee cake I have ever tasted.  My husband said he has never had anything like it!  The only thing I added was a bit more of the filling/topping--just because I like lots of it.  Thanks so much for the recipes.

I've made this twice and have gotten compliments both times.  Great with a cup of coffee or for dessert. It's dense and moist.  Next time I'm adding nuts to the crumb topping. Try it - it's a winner!

I too put this a 9x9 pan, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It was indeed a very good coffee cake, but similar to many I've made. I tried it again with blueberries, that perked it up a bit. I made one years ago that was THE BEST EVER, which I can't find the recipe for. This was not the mother of all coffee cakes, so I will still be testing out others.

Great cake. I made the following changes: Halved the recipe and baked in 8in" sq for 37-40 min. I subbed strained organic greek yogurt for the sour cream and oats for the flour in the topping mixture (to make it extra-crunchy). I added in 1/2 cup mixed berries and it came out extremely moist/dense. Will make again.

Cake came out fantastic. Super moist. I was looking for a recipe like this for a long time because my mom used to make a cake similar, but in a smaller pan, and she didn't fill the cake w topping, she just put it on top. I have to admit, this might even be a little better than her recipe. To spread the 2nd layer of batter I dropped lumps of batter into pan and spread carefuly to other clumps as not to disrupt the crumb on the first layer. I used a spatula w butter on it to sort of pull it to the next clumps and to the sides. This is a very thick batter as was the recipe that I am used to. Will make this again and again...and again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is my 1st review I have ever written but this cake is just THAT good.  I didn't change a thing, it is perfect the way it is.  I brought it to a ladies tea and about 10 people either asked for the recipe or just raved about the cake while they were helping themselves to a 2nd piece.

This was good...moist, good topping. I don't LOVE coffee cake in general, so that's why I didn't give it 5 stars (it has to involve cholocate chips to be a 5 for me :).

very yummy.  I didn't make many changes, just took out 1/4c. butter and put in 1/4c extra sour cream.  I would put more cinnamon in next time, maybe into the cake batter too.

This is super high in fat, calories and sugar so I wouldn't make it too often but it's a great treat.  My kids had a sleepover last night and I made it for breakfast and it was a big hit.  I used a bigger pan and was worried that it wouldn't have enough topping so I doubled it (thinking my sugar loving kids wouldn't mind!).  It was WAY too sweet with double the topping.  Even the kids said there was too much brown sugar topping.  Leave the recipe as it is and it's perfect.  Very moist and rich.  The only change I made was to use almond extract since I was out of vanilla.  Great recipe!

Wow!  This has to be the best coffee cake I ever had!  Normally when I think of coffee cake I think of dry, crumbly really sweet cake, but not this.  So moist and delicious!  I made this in a square 9x9 pan and it came out perfect.  Will make this again and again and again!

Added blueberries to the first layer and fired up a cup of coffee.  I could have handled a little more of the cinnamon topping-next time I will double it.  Delish!

The first coffee cake I have made and it was absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  Only made two slight changes.  Didn't have cinnamon in the cupboard so used some instant coffee instead in the topping mixture and instead of half the mixture in the middle I put a third in the middle and the rest on top. I'm a big fan of coffee cake topping.  A wonderfully moist cake and especially delicious served warm.  The best coffee cake my husband has ever had. (and he's had alot of coffee cake)

MMMM!!  I made it a big lighter by using 1 1/2 cups of low-fat sour cream and 1/2 cup butter.  I brought it for a morning meeting at work and even my dieting co-workers had a couple of slices... so yummy.  Once I made it with 1 cup of mixed frozen berries and it was good too.    Much better the next day so if you can, make it the night before you plan on serving it.

This coffee cake is fabulous. Every time I make it someone asks me for the recipe. As suggested in many other reviews, I doubled the "filling" and it turns out perfectly.

Excellent coffee cake. Very moist.  I didn't change any of the actual cake measurements, but followed the suggestion of others and doubled the topping. I also added nutmeg, cloves and a handful of chopped walnuts.  I think the increased topping worked out well.    I baked the cake in an 8x8 pan. It took a bit longer to bake, but made an excellent cake.    This will definitely be part of my baking rotation.

I made this in a bundt pan, as stated, and the top raised high and then deflated when I took it out of the oven. (I think another reviewer said the same thing)  I was supposed to take it to work but after trying a piece, I ended up not taking anything.  This weighted so much and didnt have that great of taste.  I admit that I ate a couple of pieces since it sat on my counter for 5 days, but I definately would not make this again.

This was a wonderful recipe. I wanted to try because I cook for the farmers market here. I tryed it in muffin tins so I could just sell single porshines and save a step from cuting, but that didn't work out.( a huge mess and flat muffins) It was still so tastie I tryed it again the next week but instead of putting some of the filling in the middle I put blueberries instead. it really made the recipe and everyone loved it. I will be adding this very tastie, MOIST treat to my list for the market. Thanks alot:)

I made this recipe as stated, no changes, & my husband said it was the best coffeecake he's ever eaten. He's in his 60's & I've been cooking for him for 30 of those, so I take that as high praise. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!  Just the perfect sweetness.  I would double the topping if I wanted something a bit sweeter.  I followed the exact recipe, but ended up having to bake it for 45 minutes to get it to set.

This is a great recipe!! I did a few things differently - I put more cinnamon, and instead of baking it in a square pan, I baked it in a bundt pan. It's delicious, and I get so many compliments on this recipe!!

Too sweet for me personally, but it is a really nice cake. I would decrease the sugar by a quarter cup at least if I make it again. Followed the recipe exactly.

This was a great recipe. My family loved it. The only thing I changed was I added apple filling to the center layer instead of the crumb layer. I thought the cake was a little but sweet because of this addition but my family disagreed. Great recipe and extrememly moist cake.

It is so Delicious!!! This cake is moist but not buttery, sweet but not too much sweet. This is the Best sour cream with cinnamon cake I have ever made. I add 2 table spoon of milk[2%] while beating the butter and suger mixture. This cake is very light and perfect moist :) I Love this cake! Thank you for the Best Recipe!

This is awsome!  I made it for Christmas morning brunch.  Everyone loved it!  I doubled the topping and I added a little more baking powder.  It took a little longer than it says to bake. I will make this again and again.

This was a very tasty cake...I like sweet cakes but this one is pretty sweet, for sure.  I read in some reviews to possibly add more baking powder, and I did.  My cake was quite fluffy with the added 1/4 tsp more powder.  I also made this cake in an 8X8 pan which was a mistake.  The cake took almost twice as long to bake and the edges were uneatable.  Otherwise, it was very moist and like I said before, Very Tasty.

Great cake! The only things I changed were I halved the recipe and was out of the spices for the topping so I made the topping without. Halving it was fine, still a moist yummy cake. Skipping the spice was not a terrible mistake. But I wouldn't recommend it or do it a second time, I'd skip the topping instead. I tend to never do the topping in the middle part on these kinds of cakes either, just for reference.

I could give this 10 stars, it is THE BEST coffee cake. I add pecans to the mixture and half way through the cooking time I take it out and sprinkle just a little cinnamon and sugar on top. It is even better the next day!!!

Yum! My only bummer was that my crumbly topping wasn't crumbly at all. Not sure what I did wrong. I then added a sugar glaze topping like someone suggested and it tasted like a cinnamon roll! We liked it anyways.

This was good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  And I love sweet stuff, so that's saying a lot.  I took the other reviewers' advice and doubled the filling, which is definitely the way to roll.  Mine took about 45 minutes to bake.  The final product was very moist.  If I make this again, I'll cut down on the white sugar.

This was very good. I made it in two 9x9 pans, doubled the filling/topping...could have tripled, baked for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. Will be making this again. Thank you!

Pretty good coffeecake recipe! My husband liked it, although he did mention it was pretty sweet..and would serve better as a dessert than breakfast.   But is was VERY moist and would probably make it again.

EDIT: Send what was left with hubby to work and everyone RAVVVED about it!! I think it's just my hubby, because everyone else said it was worthy of something bought from a great bakery..they were very impressed!

Wow!!  This was good.  The pan worked.  I usually use a bundt pan, and you could, but this way it lasted longer.  You would everything already in the house so it was easy and quick. Wow!!

This was so much fun to make. Definitely make extra topping, just double the recipe! It was very good and moist! will definitely make again. It took longer than 40 minutes though. At 40 minutes the outside was cooked and browning, but right in the middle was undone and loose. I cooked it for an additional 15-20 minutes and it was done.

I made this as is, except like others I doubled the topping .I also had to cook tem minutes longer , I checked it with a tooth pick and it was done. To lisa who made it in a pie plate that is a lot of batter for that small dish I can see why it took so long to cook. When I brought it to the office I had many requests for the recipe. And most of them were dietitians If they only knew how much calories were in that. But they do now cause they have the recipe. And one said it is the best she has ever had and that she wanted to eat the whole pan, I only brought some  not all of it, and it was gone in minutes

this coffe cake was very good but because of the fact the timing is off  SO Much, a rated this a 4 star. I baked in a big 9 in pie plate. I ended up almost doubling the time it took to bake. I took it out of the oven after an hour and 20 minutes because the topping was starting to burn and still it ended up not quite done but definaltly edible! next time I may try bread pans or maybe lowering the oven temperture

Amazing!! I too almost passed on making this due to the amount of butter necessary. However, the reviews were so great, I had to give it a try.  As recommended by a few others, I did double the the filling and it turned out great! Made it for the first time and brought it to a neighborhood "Tea".  It was a hit!! The kids loved it too.  My husband tried a bite and thought it was the best coffee cake he's ever had!!!

This recipe is a very good base for experimentation, or a good basic, moist coffee cake.
I made it once, per directions and decided that I wanted to add a little something extra. This is what I came up with...
Prepare batter as directed. Prepare topping, but add 1/4 c chopped pecans. Spread 1/2 batter in prepared bundt pan and top with ~1/2 can of apple pie filling. Sprinkle topping on top of pie filling and top with remaining batter. Bake @300 degrees for 1h & 20 min.

Very good.  I used 3/4 c butter and a bit of yogurt to make up and baked in 2 loaf pans for thickness.  Added 1 t of cardamom (1/2 to batter and 1/2 to topping), for a more fragrant result.  I can see using this recipe with a lot of variation!

I liked this recipe but made several modifications to it based on the advice of others -- used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce; used 1 1/2 cup sugar rather than 2 cups; used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour; and diced 3 small apples and folded them into the filling.  It was delicious, moist, and very tasty.  The cooking time was about 60 minutes so make sure to monitor it while it is cooking since it is so dense.

I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 cup lowfat yogurt, and grated three small granny smith apples into the filling mix. Had to nearly double the baking time (baked in 2 loaf pans), but came out quite well.

Excellent cake.  I've made it three times now.  I did have to extend the baking time to near an hour.  The first time I doubled the streusel as suggested - wayyy too sweet.  I just follow the recipe as is - but lengthen the baking time. Thanks!

This IS a terrific recipe!  In my experience, any recipe that you can modify successfully is a great recipe.  

I made a few changes, too, but only to suit our particular eating style and to use what I had on-hand:  I scaled the recipe down to six servings, used Earth Balance vegan "butter," whole-wheat flour, and organic sugar, sour cream, vanilla, and eggs.  And, only because I forgot, I put the filling on the top instead of in the middle, and it turned out wonderfully.

These are exactly the same ingred. I have for a Coffee cake recipe given to me by a Jewish lady many years ago. It is delicious. Her filling is a little different: 1 c. chop. nuts, 4 tsp sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon. I use a bundt cake pan.

This was delicious!  I was going to freeze half and my hubby wouldn't let me, he liked it too much.  It has a great texture, and looks scrumptious!

I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  It was rich and sweet for a coffee cake, but delicious!

Good recipe - I used FF sour cream and Splenda for baking as well as Splenda brown sugar.  My parents were so impressed by  homemade baking at 7am!

Not sure if I did something to screw this up or what.  The pan (9x13 right?) seemed too large for the amount of batter I had.  Made it tough to spread the second layer over the filling.  It didn't bake up too high, but it still tasted great.  Doubled the filling like others have said, but had too much left in the end.  Maybe I was having an "off" day!  Will give it a try again.

I was craving coffee cake this morning and just got done having a big plate of this.  It was really good but REALLY sweet, however, this is probably my fault as I took the other reviewers suggestions and doubled the topping.  In the future I would leave the recipe as is.  Only other change I made was to sub some whole wheat flour.

VERY good and moist. I used Splenda's baking blends in lieu of both regular sugars. I also used fat-free sour cream and light butter. Instead of layering, I swirled the filling into the batter and sprinkled top with cinnamon.

I didn't like this very much. Apparently I like the dry stuff, who knew? I thought it was too moist, almost made me sick to my tummy like it wasn't done enough. I thought it had a nice flavor though.

This cake recipe is exactly like the one I've used for years.   It is one of my family's favorites.   The texture and taste is unlike any other cake or coffee cake and is awesome.   My topping recipe was a little different, but this one might be even better.

i followed the advice of other people and made double the filling and used only a cup of sugar but next time i might use the whole amount because i didn't think it was that sweet. I also baked for about 50 min. and it came out great. My husband absolutely loved it, it came out moist on the inside unlike other coffee cakes i've tried before. I will definitely make it again!!

Wonderful! This is the best coffee cake I've ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly, and next time will double the cinnamon brown sugar mixture.  It is so moist and just perfect warmed up with a glass of milk.  YUMMY! 

I used an insulated air bake 9 by 13 cake pan and had to add an extra 15 minutes on to the baking time -- it came out perfectly!

This is delicious! I tripple the crumb filling because I found that it needed a lot more than what the recipe calls for (and that is my favorite part of coffee cake!)  Also, this can be frozen and then brought out when needed! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

This was an awesome recipe. I was able to use up many things from my fridge with it. It was very easy to make and the instructions were well-written. Personally, I would add more brown sugar to make it sweeter though :-)

Very moist and good flavor but I think next time
I will add chopped pecans to the topping.  I used double the topping ingredients; toothpick
inserted in center came out clean but center fell as it was cooling and it's kind of dense, so next time I will be careful to bake longer.

I made a huge mistake with this recipe. I used 2 cups of sour cream (read the 2 cups flour and sour cream at the same time). The cake, however, turned out awesome! It was so smooth and moist. It was similar to a cheesecake. Next time I'll make it right but I can bet it'll be great then too.

Super easy, super good, super GONE....We really enjoyed this coffee cake. It was moist even on day three.
I think I will add more filling next time. And maybe some chopped almonds in the filling and almond extract in the batter. Thanx for this wonderful recipe Jan!

I too doubled the filling and topping ingredients. When I added the melted butter, it got kind of pasty, so added more flour and brown sugar. Next time I won't melt the butter. I also added some almond extract since I like almond flavor in just about everything. It was really good. This really is a very moist tasty coffee cake. I will definitely make this again. It's even good if you don't warm it up!

A wonderful cake! I even used light sour cream and light margarine instead of butter and it still turned out great.  I also doubled the topping/filling, as others suggested, and added oats, although that step may not be to everyone's liking. I also added nutmeg to the topping/filling mixture.

I made this for work on payday and everyone loved it! I doubled the filling mixture though and I think without doing that it may have been too bland. I will surely make it again.

Great flavor, but so very sweet.
I think I'll cut the batter's sugar in half next time.

I baked this in a bundt pan for 60 min and it still fell a little when cooled.  However anyone who has ever had a piece has requested the recipe.

I made this coffee cake in a dorm room and it tasted pretty good.. But I was quite dissapointed with the outcome in presentation. I made it in a bundt pan and it was done in an hour. When I flipped it over, half stuck to the top, the rest fell. Perhaps next time I will bake in a pan.

This recipe is excellent. I added some frozen blueberries to the batter and mixed them in before spreading in the pan. I have made this twice for guests and have recieved great reviews both times- a very easy recipe

Loved the cake portion, but I personally prefer a non-butter topping because it is easier to distribute.  i did sprinkle pecans on top as suggested.  Husband's coworkers love it!  Thanks Jan!

The taste to the coffee cake was wonderful, but I had some problems with the filling.  I tihnk next time I will take another reviewers recommendation and swirl it into the batter.  But it still turned out well and everyone loved it!

My experience in making this wasn't a good one.  I decided to make it in a bundt pan.  After putting it in the pan,  I realized that I didn't layer the filling and batter right.  Being a bundt pan you would have to layer it upside down.  So I just kinda mixed the filling into the last layer with a butter knife a bit.  That was fine.  But I also didn't butter the pan enough because it stuck.  but as you see I gave it 4 stars because even though I messed it up, the taste is wonderful!!    I added slivered almonds and it cooked for 1 hr 10 min. being in the bundt pan it needed longer time to cook.  I will deffinetly try again, doing it the right way. The taste is out of this world!!!

A very good coffee cake, everyone else seems to like more than i do though.  I think maybe the sour cream taste is a little too strong, but that is what makes it so moist, i will be trying with plain yogurt sometime. Also, it works great as  a cake, but i've had no luck in trying to make muffins of it, they turn out all wrong.

I have made this coffee cake twice in the last two weeks.  My husband and I both love this coffee cake.  I have baked it in a bundt pan and also made it into muffins.  I adjust the baking times accordingly.  I have substituted the sour cream with low fat vanilla yogurt and it was great either way.  I also took the recommendation of others and doubled the streusel topping.  I added nuts to the topping for the muffins.  Great flavor and very moist.  I can't resist this coffe cake!

I made this recipe on Thanksgiving morning & it turned out great.  I sifted through all of the reveiws and went with using the 9 x 9 pan, doubling the filling recipe and cooking for 55 minutes.  Yum!

This was a great tasting coffee cake, but I think that the filling recipe needs to be doubled or tripled.  There definitely isn't enough to fill the middle layer as well as the top using the amounts listed.

If you prefer box cake mixes to an actual homemade cake, then you'll like this recipe.  I was very disappointed and decided not to serve it to guests but saved it for the family during the week.

This was the first recipe I tried off this site. From reading other reviews, I was concerned whether I should use a 9x13 pan or a 9x9 pan. I went with the 9x13 pan and found that there was enough batter to fill the pan for my liking.  I did 1 12 the filling (topping) 13 in the middle 23 on top. I also added 2 cups of cranberries which added tartness to compliment the sweetness of this recipe.  It was very yummy. I made it 2x in a week.

This is a moist, yummy cake with a tasty topping that I added chopped nuts to just because I had some to use up.  This cake's taste reminded me somewhat of the little Drake's Cakes of my youth on the east coast.  It will be a repeater!

Excellent recipe! Easy to make. I also doubled the topping. I did use a 9x12 pan and I didn't find it too thin. I wanted to follow the baking directions exactly as I had company coming and couldn't afford a mistake! Will definitely make again.

I did not like this cake and would not recommend it.  I doubled the topping/filling as other people did - maybe that is why it was too sweet.  Also the sour cream gave it a weird taste.

Excellent Recipe!  Good for a quick breakfast too.
I made a cinnamon drizzle for the topping and added an extra tsp of cinnamon to the batter.

My family loves sour cream coffeecake, and this recipe comes together quickly and more importantly bakes more quickly than the bundt pan recipes.  I often just use the filling as a topping instead of layering.

This coffee cake was amazing! I made it for my friends and served it warm at our Easter Brunch and it was a hit! It was so easy and quick to make. It stayed moist until we finished it off a couple days later. I have never made coffee cake before, but now I could make it every weekend!

I thought it would make a nice treat for when friends came for a visit - it didn't last the DAY with my husband and kids around!  It's great!

Really great coffee cake!  It really is moist.  I doubled the filling and topping
We like lots of crumbs on top.

OH MY!!  This is a keeper.  The first time I made it was a hit!  I added more topping and filling the second time and it wasn't as good. I will stick to the original recipe. Thank you from everyone! BMS
