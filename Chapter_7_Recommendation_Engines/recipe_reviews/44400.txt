This was super easy and very tasty. I didn't understand why it had to be cooked in the oven for TWO whole hours after the chicken was already cooked on the range but after I ate it I knew that there would have been no other way to get chicken that tender. Yummy! (and there are LOTS of left overs!)

I really gives this 3.5 stars because although it was "good " I wasn't as wowed by it either. When served over hot rice it IS filling and it IS tasty and everyone like it but I don't think the 2 hour cooking time made it all that much more moist or flavorful. I'm patient enough for a two-hour wait when it results in something "fabulous" - not just "good." Perhaps I should have started it the night before as suggested by the submitter. Either way my less-than-positive review is NOT a reflection on the taste just the prep time and final results. I'd say try it if you love chicken and celery (and you have the time). Thanks!

Great recipe! Heck it didn't last past the first night. I threw the celery etc. in with the chicken as it finished browning. I ended up using a smaller dish to bake it in; the 9x13 just looked too big. Smelled and tasted wonderful.

A crowd pleaser and it is more like 6-8 servings. If you I mean all 4 of you were Football players or Vikings it might be 4 servings. Exspecially good over rice that uses chicken noodle soup as the liquid.

I'd describe this recipe as "good grub." It is a good uncomplicated use of routine ingredients and doesn't require a lot of fuss. The results are decently good...not company fare but just fine nonetheless.

This was a really great and tasty recipe. I followed it to the letter and will make again. I served it over egg noodles. It is definitely more than four servings. More like 6-8. Thanks Paul!

I made the recipe exactly how it was listed but it was very "runny." It tasted fine but it didn't make me think of casserole in the normal sense.

Would reduce the onion to 1/2 a large onion or 1 small onion. Otherwise very good and easy.

Great recipe as is enjoyed it tonight with Brown Rice. IF you like it thicker (and I do) I dipped some sauce from the pan and mixed with 3 tbs cornstarch and stirred it back in during the last 30 minutes. Good add-in is a jar of pimiento and red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. Delicious!

This was very yummy. A definite comfort food! I added a cup of frozen mixed vegetables instead of just carrots. Not everyone in my family likes mushrooms so I omitted those. Added a bit more chicken a little more poultry seasoning. This was wonderful. We served it over egg noodles as one other reviewer suggested. I wish the sauce was a little thicker and creamier though.

This is a very basic easy chicken recipe and it tastes just fine. That being said there are sooo many easy chicken recipes that taste even better. I will skip adding this recipe to my favorites.
