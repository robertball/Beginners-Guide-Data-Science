This was really yummy.  I used leftover cut up lasagna noodles instead of egg 
noodles.  I think this is really more of a dessert because it's sweet.  The only problem
is that the top noodles get crunchy.  I would reserve some of the cheese mixture next
time to put on top so it doesn't get so crunchy.

I have been looking for this recipe for years. My aunt made this for all our holiday gatherings and since it was my uncle who was Jewish and it was his family tradition, when they passed away, the recipe was lost. The reviewer who commented that the top noodles were hard, should do as my aunt did with her recipe. She would top her kugel with corn flakes mixed with melted butter and they would get crunchy, but the noodles would not and it just gave it a little extra different taste. It is wonderful. My family will be so happy I have found this recipe.

We enjoyed this noodle kugel very much.  We added raisins, though.  We soaked 1/2 cup raisins in boiling water for about an hour, completely drained them, and stirred into rest of ingredients.  This added flavor and moisture.

Just a comment, the noodles on top are supposed to get crunchy, that's the way a noodle kugel is supposed to be!

Awesome, I did add 8oz cream cheese and reduced the eggs to 4 and halved the butter. I used reduced fat and it is still Delish!

This is amazing!!! It's almost my Na-na's recipe! She only used 2tsp. of vanilla, and added 8oz. cream cheese and 1 cup of milk. Sometimes, she would use plain yogurt instead of sour cream and then adjust sugar to 3/4 cup.  Some ppl add fruit like raisens or apricots. I love it just as is! It is good warm or cold from fridge and works perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or desert even!! I really insist you try this if you never have!!!! I don't know anything about this version being Kosher though.

This recipe was pretty good, similar to other kugels I've had.  I just wanted to note that when making it I forgot to put the butter in and it still tasted good.  So, if you wanted to have a little bit less fat you could probably reduce the amount of butter without changing the taste too much.  And the crispy noodles on top are the best part!

Didn't like it.  Too dry and not rich enough.
