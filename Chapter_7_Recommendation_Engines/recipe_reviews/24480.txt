Yummy! I scaled the recipe down to one serving and used about 2 T. peanut butter instead. Turned out great. Not too thick, not too thin. Thanks!

Whoa... This was thick! I had even added 16 ice cubes by mistake and it still came out pretty thick. I'm thinking if you add a little more milk and more chocolate syrup, it might "numb" the thickness down. But if you absolutely looooove gulping down peanut butter, just stick with the original recipe.

The ice didn't blend very well and it was pretty rich. I tried it after I had some mouth work done as I couldn't chew very well. It was definitely thick enough to stay with me for quite some time. :)

I'm sure there's something that could make it better, but being not very creative I was quite content with it in the first place. great on a hot summer day but if you eat it every hot summer day you're going to end up with a few extra pounds

This recipe is AWESSOME! I made a few changes: I made this for 2 people and used 1/4 cup peanut butter, 8 icecubes, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/2 cup chocolate syrup.  I also added 1/2 cup of whip cream. It was a nice balance and the peanut butter was not overpowering. I scaled back on the peanut butter after reading other reviews.This is a nice end to a very long day. I will definitely make this again!

This was a hit with my 5 1/2 yr old and my 20mth old at 630 in the morn! I was looking for a fun drink for them (and me too!) and this hit the spot! I used 1/2 a cup of milk instead of 1/4 cup to make it a bit easier to sip thru a straw for the kids. I also used more choc syrup on the inside of the glass to make it look cool!

I love peanut butter and I love chocolate, so this was perfect! I didn't measure the ingredients, I just sort of eyeballed the amounts (I was only making a serving for me and a small serving for my 2-year old). A great way to feed kids protein if they aren't fans of meat! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I read a lot of reviews and saw mainly, "Too much peanut butter!" So I used 2/3 cup Peanut Butter and 1/3 cup Chocolate Syrup with about the same amount of milk. Had to re-blend with more milk though. Then drizzled a little chocolate syrup on top and stirred it in. Tastes great! Will be making it again.

I read the reviews before I made this and decided to adjust the amount of peanut butter. This was YUMMY. Will definitely make again. We have a really good blender (Vitamix) and it was definitely as good as or better than a restaurant quality shake. Some blenders just can't handle the ice. ;) Here's how I made mine (made 4 generous servinigs): just under 1 C. peanut butter, a bit more than 1/2 C. chocolate syrup, 1/2 C. milk & 24 ice cubes (basically doubled it but kept the amount of peanut butter the same). Perfect.

I decided to give this a try, even though I could not see how the ingredients would give a satisfying milkshake.  If you act like this is simply a smoothie, I still have a few suggestions.  Like everyone else, I agree that less peanut butter should be used.  I would also suggest to crush up the ice in the blender or using another method before adding the remaining ingredients, because I had a hard time getting a smooth texture.  Aside from that, I would prefer the texture with ice cream, but the flavor with these ingredients was pretty good.

I made this when I was bored, hot, and thirsty. I scaled it down to 1 serving but used the same amount of PB. It was so thick! I was in peanut butter lover's heaven.

quick & cool energy booster! 
thx, andrew. 
your drink is totally customizable according to taste. 

MY SUGAR FREE VERSION

TIP: when making shakes/smoothies, ice cubes always get crushed first. then you add the ingredients.
 
i also cut back on the peanut butter to (ABS Diet levels) and having no choc syrup on hand i made my own. here's how:

grabbed 2 envelopes of my wife's diet swiss miss cocoa mix, stirred them both into 1/2 a cup of milk, and blended away... :-)

For one person, I blended: 5 ice cubes not quite 1/2 cup of peanut butter 1/4 cup of milk 3 Tbsp. of chocolate syrup It was decadent and delicious! Note: This is a recipe for peanut butter LOVERS, not people who just don't mind peanut butter.

My 4-year-old declared it really good!  Only problem I had was that it didn't mix well.  I had to add more milk, then more ice cubes.  And I think the peanut butter was a little overwhelming.  Next time, I think I'll decrease the PB and increase the chocolate syrup.

This is wonderful when you need a chocolate or ice cream fix!  I think the peanut butter is a little strong, so I cut back on that a bit and add more chocolate.

This was too plain and too peanutbuttery(not enough chocolate). I might make this again but instead of using ice and milk use ice cream for a smoother texture.

Delicious and so convenient since it doesn't take ice cream. We added a lot more milk and it could use less PB and/or more choc. syrup.

I followed some of the other reviews and added more milk and less pnb.  I also didn't have chocolate syrup on hand, so used hot chocolate mix.  It was pretty good, my 2, 3, 5 year olds like it.

Good recipe! I tried using less peanut butter, and it helped. Maybe try using ice cream instead of ice and milk? :)

I used less peanut butter. Very rich. It would be a good milkshake with ice cream! I like the orange glorious more.

Very good. We added more ice, chocolate, and milk to make it less peanut buttery. We also added chocolate chips to make it chunk,  tastes good that way

The measurements seemed to be off on this for us.  Based on other reviews I started with 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter instead of a cup.  This balanced out the peanut butter and chocolate flavor perfectly.  It was still way to thick for us though, so, I added another 1/4 cup of milk and then a splash or two more.  I would definitely recommend using crushed ice if you want it to blend.  The flavor was good though and did taste like a milkshake without using ice cream!

I think that this is really good but WAY TOO MUCH PEANUT BUTTER. I used the 1/4 cup of peanut butter not knowing that it would be so over powering. I put in the chocolate syrup and tasted it when it was done blending and all I tasted was peanut butter. No chocolate what so ever. I probably used about a 1/4 cup of chocolate syrup in order to get it to taste like chocolate but the peanut butter is still overpowering.

This was so simple to make and delicious.  For ease in the blender, make sure to add the peanut butter at the very end after blending the ice, milk and chocolate.  I used natural peanut butter (Teddys) and it mixed really well.

A perfect midday snack. :)

save yourself the time and eat some peanut butter off a spoon.  that's what this recipe essentially is if you don't adjust the pb way down and the milk/ice way up.  I made it was written to start and even my pb loving husband wasn't? into it.  made adjustments like everybody else and it was "meh"

Its good but add another 1/2 cup milk instead of 1/4 and maybe 1/3 chocolate syrup because peanut taste is bit too strong.

This recipe was really tasty! It was like a liquid peanut butter cup. I added about 2/3 cup of chocolate syrup and 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter instead of the original. It's great!

I should have read the reviews before I made this....there's definately wayyyy too much pb in it.  I added 1/4 more milk to fix it.  I made mine with soy milk, Silk Vanilla, and it tastes good with it.  But def. cut down the pb!

To make this recipe even better, add 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and change the amount of peanut butter to one tablespoon and then your good to go!!

This was yummy but i'd definitely make a few modifications. Using a cup of peanut butter was way too much, I only used half a cup. I also increased the milk to 1 cup. otherwise, it's too thick and peanut-buttery to be able to sip or taste the chocolate.

Great recipe!  I make one thats' similar with organic peanut butter and milk. It's also sugar free (made with agave syrup), which is a bonus.
