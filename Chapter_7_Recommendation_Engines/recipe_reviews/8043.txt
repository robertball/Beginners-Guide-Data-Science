Absolutely wonderful!  The only problem I had with this cake was the whipped cream frosting kept running down the sides as quickly as I could put it on. I had to immediately put it in the freezer to set it.  Any suggestions for this?

Make sure you COOL the cake in refrigerator before putting the cool whip topping on it! I make this in a 9x13 pan and bake for about 40 minutes..testing with a toothpick. You can make the cake one or two days ahead and make the topping just before you need it. The covered cake pan makes for easier traveling to potlucks or work..everyone LOVES this cake. We also know it as Pineapple Dream Cake.

I have made this cake several times, its a super moist cake with that light not too sweet taste.  Everytime I make it everyone comes back for second helpings. I usually just use a 9x11 pan instead of 3 8" pans and 8oz of cool whip. It's easier too!

I got this recipe from my ex's mother 28 years ago. but we called it cottin pickin good cake.  We add chopped pecans or walnuts, (bout 1/2 cup) to the icing.  It firms it up.  also if you make a day ahead the fruit soaks in better.  this cake is verrrrrrry moist.I have never served it to anyone that did not like it. Note:  I am also from Tennessee.

Everyone loves this. I use a 9x13 pan but never change anything else about the recipe. It is light, cool and fruity -- perect to end a rich meal and even better when made early the day you will serve it or even the day before.

We had a potluck at our lake place during the Labor Day weekend. I provided the desserts. Let me tell you, everyone went crazy for this cake. It was so moist, flavorful, and refreshing. I made one using the yellow cake mix as suggested, then one using an orange cake mix. Both were really good! Thanks teri!

I love this cake!  I am a Southern export, and people always ask me to make this recipe.  To answer the question about the frosting running, make sure the cake is completely cooled, and keep the frosting in the fridge until ready to use.

We really do call this "Pig Pickin' cake" in SC because it's often served at barbecues called "Pig Pickin's." I guess different areas of the country have different names for this recipe. Whatever it's called, it's an easy recipe that tastes great!

READ THIS FROSTING PROBLEM SOLVED: I make this cake at least once month.  The issue with the frosting is that you MUST drain the pineapple until most of the liquid is gone. AND keep the cool whip cold until you use it . Mix the pudding and pineapple together thoroughly first, and then fold in the whip topping.  I personally use the "extra creamy" cool whip when I do this recipe, it has a little more stiffness than regular.  HAPPY BAKING!

One of my most favorite recipes from White Trash Cookbook. I like to make this in a 9x13 baking pan and just frost the top with the whipped topping "frosting" and line the top of the cake with drained mandarin oranges. This is also good with toasted coconut both in the "frosting" and sprinkled on top. EXCELLENT for family get-togethers, potlucks or your own White Trash party.

I got this recipe from my husband's grandmother who's family were Virginia "mountain people". 
This is my favorite recipe to bring to potlucks because everyone always loves it. 
I follow the same recipe, but sometimes I like to add a little pineapple to the batter and some mandarin oranges to the frosting. It is best if it has been refrigerated for 24 hours.

Love this cake. So light tasting. For the person who had the problem with the icing running down, you have to make sure to really drain the pineapple and let the pudding thicken the mixture before you spread it on. Also, once cool whip gets liquidy, it won't get fluffy again so you have to be careful not to leave it out for too long.

I have made this many times through the years. The instructions I have had for the frosting is that you mix it and chill it in the frig for 1 hour before frosting the cake. It eliminates the problem of the frosting not being set up and therefore sliding off the cake.

This was very simple to make, and came out extremely moist!! I baked it in a 9x13 pan, but otherwise followed everything else exactly. I didn't actually try it myself, but it got great reviews from my family.They all loved it. Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe. I make this all the time. Everyone eats it up as do I. I use a small can of crushed pineapple because I don't like the pineapple to be overwhelming. I use only the good brand of mandarin oranges because the cheap ones have had a seed here or there in them. I can't stand how someone will rate four stars because they didn't make the cake they only made the icing. Ridiculous.

This was a favorite cake from childhood for my husband, who referred to it as "pineapple cake" and after searching for years for the recipe, I came across this one it realized it was what he was describing.  This really is good and refreshing, and it only improves with age in the frig.  Be sure to drain the pineapple well... i used my hand to encourage the juice to drain through the strainer and made sure the cake was well cooled before frosting... no problems with these suggested techniques. I used 9 inch cake pans without a problem, just monitored them in the oven to make sure they were not overdone. Next time I will not blend the oranges so thoroughly as I would have likes some little chunks of orange in the cake.  Thanks for posting!

Everyone loved this cake.  I used butter pecan flavoured box cake.  Some said it tasted like pancakes.  Next time I will use real whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping, as it makes too sweet for me.  Using real whipped cream would taste better and be fine if you are making it in a 9" x 11" pan.

This is a good cake, not a great one. It is definitely convenient and you can pick up the ingredients readily. The ingredients work well together. However, here is my issue: this is super sweet! I think putting in the mandarin juice to an already sweet cake mix makes it too over the top with sugar, plus you can't really taste the mandarin oranges. Next time I will fold them in rather than beating them in, since they broke up to basically nothing. For simplicity, I baked this in a 9x13 pan, which worked fine but browned very quickly at 350. I had to cover it with foil. Next time I will reduce the heat--again, I think the sugar caramelized quickly, another issue with sugar. I would also drain the oranges and put in a bigger can of them, then use plain water rather than the mandarin juice next time. I had no issues with the frosting except it was kind of stiff...i actually drained and squeezed the pineapple because I was worried about it being runny as other reviewers had mentioned. Next time I would not work quite so hard to make the pineapple dry...it definitely needed a little more wetness to work with the pudding. Overall, I will try this again, but it definitely needs tweaking. I may even try it with my own yellow (from scratch) cake recipe so I can control the sugar.

I wanted to try something new for Easter. The name is what got my attention. My family and friends loved it. Some people were surprised when I said that I had never made it before. Everyone wanted the recipe. It is also a really good base for some changes I'm going to try with it next time! I'll post them when I've done that.....80)

Delicious and moist.  Did not put the oil into the cake, but used a 15 ounce can of oranges with the juice.  Let sit in the fridge overnight, and the cake tasted great the next day.

Followed recipe exactly, but doubled it.  Used 3 10" cake pans (instead of slicing layers) to create a more dramatic effect.  Extra batter I put into cupcakes.  Thank you!

I was introduced to this cake while living in NC back in the early 80's.  Been makin' it ever since!   But my version has the crushed pineapple and pineapple juice inside the batter and garnished with the mandarin oranges.

SO GOOD! I made it the other night for a small friend-get-together. I didn't try it before I brought it, so I was taking a chance, but it was SO worth it. This cake tastes like it is from a professional bakery. Sadly the family kept the rest of the cake, but I KNOW I'll be making it again very soon...

Maybe if I were a real cake fan I'd rate this 5/5 stars, but a cake really has to impress me to rate that highly.  However, this is an incredibly simple recipe that drew a number of comments from my peers at work - several who went back for seconds.  As such, I'm sure I'll reach for the recipe time and time again.  I was particularly pleased with the frosting and am planning on experimenting with other pudding flavors for other cakes.  I was also happy that the orange taste was not overpowering, as I'm not a fan.  I chose to frost it like the main photo - ie. in between the layers and on top with the Cool Whip/pudding mixture topped with clumps of pineapple, allowing the cake to show through on the sides which looked really impressive.  I was sad that, though I hand stirred in the oranges, they broke up too much for chunks to be visible.  I am going to try to drain the liquid off next time and mix that in first, then fold in the oranges so there will be larger chunks.  I think this will make for a prettier cake, though it may disappoint my personal taste buds due to a stronger orange flavor in some bites.

This is my brother and I's favorite cake! I have to make it every year for his birthday, and if he had the chance I'm sure he would eat the entire thing all by himself. It tastes even better when it has been in the fridge for a day.

Yum - I would easily give this 4-1/2 stars!  I chopped up some mandarin oranges and added it to the fluff icing along with the pineapple.  I also took the drained pineapple juice, added some sugar and heated onto the stove into a simple syrup.  After the cake was cooled I punched holes into the cake with a fork and lightly brushed the cooled syrup onto the layers to keep the cake moist before icing.  I also iced the cake on the sides.  Anyone that had a problem with the icing slipping down the sides - make sure you refrigerate the icing for a little while before using it to help the pudding mix set-up.  I had no problems at all after that.  Great cake!

5 Stars!  Don't change a thing!  This recipe has been in my family for generations.  It is a staple at any good southern get together and a must have at Pig Pickin's.  This is also the same recipe Paula Deen uses.  My Grandma was using it well before anyone knew of Paula Deen though!

This. Is. So. Good.  My recipe calls for 1/3 cup of water, 1/3 cup vegetable oil and three large eggs (instead of four eggs and just oil) to be mixed in with the yellow cake mix.  I make it in three cake pans, and frost in between the layers and on top I sprinkle pecans.   It is SO pretty and ridiculously easy.

What a lovely cake--cool, light, and refreshing.  I only had two 8" pans, though, so I baked the cake in them, using the time suggested on the cake box.  Then I severed the two layers with dental floss, making a four-layer cake.  I stretched the frosting by adding about a cup of heavy cream (whipped) (since I had no extra cool whip)with about another 1/3 box of pudding mix. An impressive result, to say the least--it looked like a professionally made torte, and, man, was it tasty!  Another thing I may do next time, though, is to add more mandarin oranges.  Thanks for posting a great recipe.

Really light and cool cake.  It was a hit!  I only wish I had added more frosting between the layers.  I tried to make sure I had enough, but there was plenty.  I also had 9" pans instead of 8".  It still turned out great!  I'm not a huge orange fan either, but I could barely taste the orange, mostly the pineapple.

I have made this cake many times and it is delicious.  But, by looking at this picture, it is most unappealing looking.  When making the frosting, blend the drained pineapple into the cool whip and instant vanilla pudding powder, it makes for a nicer presentation.  Remember, do not make the pudding, just sprinkle the powder over c
ool whip and drained pineapple.

The icing is what makes this cake and its wonderful!!  The one issue I had was that the icing was a bit runny, but I may have not drained the crushed pineapple good enough.  Runny icing or not this was an awesome cake.

Growing up, this cake was the one I requested from my grandmother every year to be my birthday cake, and now I bake it for my kids on their birthdays.  It's easy, delicious, moist, and great the next day right out of the fridge.  Chill the whipped cream frosting after mixing to make spreading easier.  Unlike the pic on this recipe, you want to blend the frosting ingredients all together.
Truly, the best cake.

My friend told me about this recipe and I was happy when I found it on here and saw that it had many rave reviews.  
I don't know why it had so many great reviews...  
I didn't think it was that good.  It wasn't bad, it's just not something I would ever make again or crave.  
I didn't make any changes to the recipe either.

Reminds me of the kind of cake my mom made for us as kids.  Same ingredients, (except the mandarin) but less steps.  
Very tasty!  Does make you keep coming back for more.

I used 15 oz. can of mandarin oranges and it worked just fine.  I didn't use a mixer to blend the cake mix because I liked the chunks of mandarin oranges being in the cake.  I have made this recipe 3 times in as many days.  I have gotten so many compliments on this recipe.  Thanks for submitting this.

Pretty darn good cake! I used a pineapple cake mix, two large cans of mandarin oranges (drained one can)and mashed the oranges into tiny pieces. I put my cake into a 9x13, which worked fine. For the frosting I used cheesecake flavored pudding and added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans - this is a must! It gives it really great texture and nutty sweetness. The crushed pineapple is fabulous! I accented the cake with strawberry chunks - to give a little color contrast.  It got great reviews and will definitely make again - next time I will make them into cupcakes!

A very light and refreshing cake.  I used about 12 oz. of Cool Whip for the frosting and only lightly drained the pineapple.

This is always a crowd pleaser (My manager asked me to give his wife the recipe) and is not yout typical 'heavy' cake. Light and refreshing and always moist. I love this cake and make it in a 9x13 pan - you can also reduce the calories by using lite cool whip in icing and some applesause in place of the oil...I would say 'MAKE THIS CAKE'!!!

Really moist cake and the icing was perfect! My husband doesn't like icing usually because it's too sweet, but he loved this. I used a can of oranges instead of pineapple for the icing.

I made this for my son's first birthday, and it was a hit with everyone!  I used a pineapple cake mix and sprinkled coconut on the top for garnish.  Be sure to drain the pineapple thoroughly and refrigerate the cake after frosting.

If using dark coated non-stick cake pans, reduce cooking time by a few minutes. If cooked the full recommended cooking time, the cake will turn out dry. Put a generous amount of frosting/filling in between layers.

I used a homemade yellow cake batter and added the mandarin oranges with juice, and it made the most delicious, moist cake!  Paired with the luscious and light icing, the cake layers were absolute perfection!

By mistake I used a pineapple cake mix but everyone raved about this cake. It was very good and so easy. Also presents great for parties etc...
Next time I want to make it with the yellow cake mix but the pineapple was very good.

i accidentally added the pudding mix portion into the cake part (luckily i had an extra for the frosting) and it was extremely moist. incredibly tasty, i think i'll add some other kinds of canned fruit next time.

I loved this, It tasted fruity and fresh. I made the frosting early and frosted it before we ate it. The kids didnt want to try it , I cant understand why, what kid dont like cake? I made them sit and eat it. LOL What do they know? Anywho, It was too funny a total stranger at the store seen me buying manderin oranges and asked if I was making Pig Pickin Cake.  I knew it was gonna be good.

I made this for an office birthday. It was more than a hit.  I only made one change.  I was giving my son a bath while the cake was in the oven and I did not hear the timer go off.  I was distraught that I had ruined the cake. It was not burnt but I was afraid that it would be too dry.  I took the drained pineapple juice- I am lucky I had not thrown it out- and cooked it on the stovetop with 1/4 cup of sugar right up to the boiling point and let it cool for 20 minutes.  I poked holes in the cake with a fork and poured the juice mixture over the cake before frosting it.  I refrigerated it overnight and took it to work the next day.  It was awesome- not dry at all and the tropical flavors of the cake were so refreshing.

I was looking for a recipe for my grandmother's cake, and this was it! I called her and she confirmed it's what she used to make. This cake is delicious, easy to make, and elegant! The recipe is perfect as is, but is fun to experiment with as well. Thank you for this great recipe.

I have a confession to make.  My sister and I loved this cake soooo much that we vowed the recipe would be "our" little secret.  Well, I guess the secret is out.  This is by far my most favorite cake recipe. I am always asked to make it at various gatherings.

This is a wonderful recipe. Being from the TN mountains, I bring this to all community/neighborhood functions. Just a bit of history about the name, "pig pickin" is pulled barbeque pork here in Appalachia.  This light and fluffy cake is excellent after a heavy meal of pulled BBQ pork or ribs.

Very good and pretty cake. My advice is to make it the day before because it tastes even better the next day. Also I used a cheap (store brand) cake mix and I think it would of been moister with a Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines.

I grew up in the south, and my great aunt was known for her pig pickin' cake...and I've never found a recipe as good as hers...until now!  After trying it exactly as written, the 2nd time I made it I changed the recipe slightly to 1/2 cup oil and I also added fresh strawberries between the layers & on top.  (I only made it a 2 layer cake)  I received rave reviews!  Cake was extremely moist! My husband, who isn't a very big fan of sweets & desserts had 3 slices!  Thank you!

I added some flaked coconut to the frosting to make it a little like a "pina colada" cake and my family just loved it!  They keep asking for it again! Delicious and not too heavy-tasting. Thanx for the recipe.  =)

I have made this recipe for over 20 years.  I got it originally from a dear family friend in New Mexico.  Never thought I'd see it here.  I've made it so many times as a b'day cake as well as having company over.  It's so popular with everyone that tries it.  It's light and fluffy too.  One tip - make sure that the cake mix doesn't have pudding in the mix.

I had problems the first time not draining my pineapple enough so had runny icing. Now I frost it with a can of white icing and sprinkle coconut on it. Cake bakes great and easy.

Love this recipe! I have been making it for a couple of years now. My husband can't get enough of this cake. I take this to all get togethers and people just love it. I use 15 oz mandarin oranges and I use 1/4 cup apple sauce instead of oil. I also use fat free cool whip and fat free pudding. The cake is so moist. It is absolutely delicious!

Best spring/summer cake. This is just like the one Aunt Wanda used to make. Just fine as a 1 layer sheet cake - easier to tote and cut, frankly.

Lisa W make sure the Cool Whip is very cold. Also make sure house or apartment is nice and cool. I lay all indredients out and take Cool Whip out last. Once I start making the frosting I do not stop. You can also use less of juice from pineapples.  I made this cake again today and it was perfect as usual. I hope this helps.

This was a moist and delicious cake, and really quite simple to make.  Quite mild citrus flavor in the cake itself.  As a variation, instead of mixing crushed pineapple into the whipped cream and pudding, I layered sliced strawberries for two of the layers, and on the top of the cake, I arranged fresh pineapple and fresh strawberries slices.  I then put in a few chocolate curls amongst the fresh fruit for added touch.  It was well received at the charity banquet I served it at this evening!

I have made this more times than I can remember, always a big hit! I have subbed applesauce for the oil, no one notices. I also add an extra can of mandarin oranges for extra orange flavor (drain juice). Make sure cake is completely cool before frosting or frosting will melt. Have made this with 9x13 pan and also 2 or 3 layers, always delicious!

This cake is wonderful! It's light and not too sweet. It's perfect for a light dessert after a summer cookout. I bake for a living and I didn't change a thing!!

I guess we all have our name for this cake. I also from TN call it a Sunshine Cake. One thing my husbands's aunt told me; use a wooden spoon to mix the whip cream w/pineapple. Something about the wooden spoon keeps it stiffer and easier to spread. Using a mixer will make it runnier.

This was a big hit with my inlaws and family! I did alter it slightly for the waistline. I used low sugar cake mix, sugarfree-fatfree pudding, no sugar added applesauce in place of the oil and light cool whip! It was fantastic! I will definately make this again! Thank you for the great recipe!

This cake is divine! Everyone loves it! I like to put some of the mandarin oranges in the icing as well as the pineapple. Also, I double the icing recipe that way I can generously icing and if there is leftovers we just eat it out of the bowl!!!!

This is a great cake. I didn't think there was enough liquid for the cake so I put the juice of the oranges in a measuring cup and added pineapple juice to equal 1 cup, and it turned out great. I baked it in a 9x13 pan so it would be easier to take to my in-laws. I also put pecans on top of the frosting. Next time I will try some coconut in the frosting. It is a great summertime dessert. Everybody loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

I wish I could've given this 5 stars, but I've made this twice and I don't think I'll make it again.  Perhaps it IS a good recipe, and I'm just not impressed with Pig Pickin' Cake.

Super Delicious!!! I LOVE THIS CAKE!! My mom in law makes this and she can't make enough. My mom made it for her Christmas Party and it was a major hit. It is very moist and full of flavor. We refrigerate for about 2 days before eating so its nice and cold and the juices have time to mix and soak. Yummy!!!

Light and delicious, it turned out wonderfully. Next time, I'm going to glaze it with some coconut rum, heated in a pan with simple syrup. I suspect that would give this even better flavor.

My sister-in-law comes from S. Carolina and I first tasted this cake at her place.  This recipe comes close to hers.  I should have read the reviews before cooking, then I would have cooked the layers less.  My cake was bit dry.  Nevertheless, my husband loved this cake so I will be making it again.  Thanks.

I was surprised to find this recipe!  My mom made these cakes when I was little, and I haven't had one in years!  I made this cake for my husband last week for the first time...it's awesome!  Everything I remember it being.  The only thing I would change is decrease the baking time on the cakes, because as thin as they are, they dry out.  I bake them for 15 minutes, and they come out perfectly!

My husband loves this cake!

This cake is the best. I have made it countless times since getting the recipe for birthdays, cookouts, pot luck suppers and it always comes out moist and delicious and everyone loves it! Sometimes I buy an extra can of crushed pineapple and spoon it over the cake layers before icing. This makes the cake even more moist and it's a BIG hit with pineapple lovers. Thanks for the great recipe.

I really enjoyed this cake as did my in-laws and husband.  The topping was absolutely delicious.  I think next time I will add more pineapple and mandarin oranges.  My only mistake was making the cake in two layers instead of three.  It turned out a little more dry than it should have I think.

I laughed out loud when I saw your title...it's actually a PEA Pickin' Cake...LOL...but whatever you call it...it's a delicious cool dessert for summertime.  I don't know of a single soul who doesn't like this cake!  Always part of our Easter dinner!  I suggest wrapping cooled layers in plastic wrap and refrigerating or freezing before putting it together with frosting.  Drain pineapple well in a sieve, pressing out all liquid possible.  Mix frosting together, pop back into the fridge to get it very cold before putting cold cake and frosting together.  Will make your cake prettier and will keep everything from sliding around!  Delicious.

I made this as directed except I added  an extra can of drained mandarins to cake batter and  I added a can of drained mandarins to the frosting along with the pineapple.   I let the cake rest in the refrigerator overnight to maximize flavor and moisture.  In the end the cake was very  easy to make and looked pretty, but it really didn’t have much flavor.

This is my family's favorite. I do customize it to our preferences. I use orange cake mix instead of yellow, only 1/2 cup of oil, and I bake it in a 9x14 rectangular pan. When it comes out of the oven, poke holes in it and pour a can of sweetened condensed milk over the top. Cover and let it cool in the fridge overnight. For the topping, I use another can of oranges, drained, instead of pineapple, mixed with the pudding mix and 2 containers of cool whip, plus I add 1/3 cup of lemon curd. Then I break the cake up into large chunks and layer it in a large bowl alternating with big dollops of the whipped topping. My husband loves the lemon/orange combo. It doesn't last long in my house!

I replaced the 1/4 cup of oil with 1/4 cup softened butter. I added 1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract to the cake blend. I added 1/4 cup powdered sugar to the icing mixture. I also made sure to use only 1/2 cup of the reserved juice from the mandarin oranges.  Consistency is proper for a recipe.

One of my family's favorites! It is so moist and not overly sweet like most cakes. I made the cake as a 9 x 13 then split the cake and layered the frosting in the middle and the top ! Yummy & so pretty with the mandarin oranges adorning the top.

I've made this cake 2 or 3 times a year for the last 15 to 20 years. I always put a package of vanilla pudding in the cake mix and another package in the whipped cream frosting. I only have two cake pans so I just do it as a double layer cake.

I have substituted the instant vanilla pudding with banana cream pudding or coconut cream pudding to give it even more of a tropical flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly, except for baking it in a 9 x 13 inch pan. The cake itself was tasty, but it turned out very flat. In fact, the icing was twice as thick as the cake! I wonder if it has to do with the fact that I live in a high-altitude area (4, 500 feet)? I am going to test out some other "Pig Cake" recipes to see if I have the same problem.

Its great!  I dress up the box a bit more with sour cream and 1 pkg instant pudding mix.. just because that's how I make all my cakes.  The whipped cream is melty on warm cakes.  A trick to moist cake is to wrap the cakes, right out of the oven while they are still hot, with plastic wrap and put in the freezer and freeze solid. The cakes otherwise lose a lot of moisture cooling on a rack or unwrapped in the fridge.  This also helps assembly of this recipe since it uses cool whip.  I set wrapped frozen cakes on the counter in a single layer while preparing the frosting.  They soften enough by then.  and then place finished cake the fridge until we're ready for it... its never been frozen on me when cut, so far.

I'm making it for family dinner and everyone loved it. I found it really helpful to put the frosting in the fridge so it could set up. I used french vanilla and regular vanilla pudding and put a can of oranges in the frosting that made it taste awesome.  I give it 2 thumbs up.

My husband says this is the most dangerous dessert I make, cause you almost always want seconds. I like to add shredded coconut to both the cake and frosting and have had it with nuts in the frosting as well. Best kept and served cold, it's a lovely light dessert perfect for picnics, BBQs, potlucks, and the traditional southern pig pickin.

Almost didn't try this recipe just based on the name, but I'm glad I did. A couple things I noticed with the recipe- Cake mixes where I live are around 15 oz, not 18. canned mandarins do not come in 11oz cans, and pineapple does not come in 15 oz cans, so I bought the closest sizes I could, then just left some out. For oranges, it says "juice reserved" which usually means save the juice, set aside; but the directions say to use the juice. SO after I took some fruit out of the cans, and removed the juice that would go with the removed oranges, I added the remaining oranges and juice to the batter. I made my cake in a 9x13 pan, turned out fine. For the topping, I did as others suggested, and drained the pineapple but also squished it down some to get more juice off before mixing with the cool whip and pudding. Instead of coating the whole cake, I am keeping the topping separate in the cool whip container in the fridge, and using it as we need it since we don't like soggy cake. Changes I would make next time- I would use all of the mandarin oranges, (I think it was 15oz) but still eliminate the same amount of juice, as it was perfect texture. I would also try half orange, half pineapple in the cake batter as well. Hubby thinks that would be great. Overall, very nice, love the light topping, and will make again for sure, probably trying different fruits in the cake.

Yummy!  Made some personal preference changes (who doesn't, right) ...
No nuts or coconut, hubby doesn't like them and it was HIS birthday!

Great spring time dessert. Made for Easter dinner.  Delicious as always.  I only have two round pans so I only have two layers.  Yummy

Made this and have already had people asking for the recipe.  Put a layer of bananas on the cake before frosting and topped with pecans.  Have used many great yellow cake mixes but  for this particular recipe Jiffy yellow cake mix makes it seem lighter.

Great recipe!  Simple and delicious.  I have a house of 7 and it was certainly a hit.  I also made it in a 9x13 pan, when cooled sliced in half and put filling in the middle.  Will certainly make again.

This cake was okay overall. the frosting was delicious, but  the cake was surprising dry...would have thought the mandarin oranges would have made it moister. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 2, 9 inch rounds, rather than 3, 8 inch for baking. I don't think I over baked...watched them carefully and removed when toothpick came out almost clean. I think I will try the version with cream cheese if I make this type of cake again.

A great summer cake.  My mother's recipe is exactly the same except calls for 1/2 cup vegetable oil.  Be sure to not drain the oranges, but DO drain the pineapple well.

Followed the recipe to a T and it was divine! Nice and light for a summer dessert. Even my husband, who said this sounded "disgusting," agreed that it was excellent. 
My only future edit might be to use one 8oz tub of Cool Whip instead of 2 (16oz total). We had a TON of frosting on the cake and there was still a good 2 cups we didn't use. Still, we happily ate that with a spoon so maybe the amount is perfect, lol!

With all the 5 star reviews, I was a little disappointed. I guess it just seemed a little too good to be true, an easy cake that gets 5 stars in my book. I will admit that I am a dessert snob, so maybe I am a little less likely to rate a cake 5 stars unless it is absolute top notch. It was good, but nobody went back for seconds, which is odd in my sweet-toothed family. I don't see myself making this again, but it was worth a try. For a beginner cook, this is probably a great recipe to try. Based on taste alone I would have given it a 3 rating, but because it was so easy to follow I bumped it up to 4. Thanks!

A big hit at our Super Bowl Party! After wings and chips and chili etc, everyone was in the mood for a lighter dessert. To those who had trouble with the frosting: make sure you take the time to drain the pineapple and keep the frosting in the refrigerator until you need it (and after frosting). Thanks for a great recipe!

No other words but "SIMPLY DELICIOUS"..this cake is awesome. It is so moist from the madarin and the pineapple whip cream frosting is light, airy and not real sweet. My family just loved this. IN fact I made one for a family gathering it was gone in minutes and I had to make 2 more the same night. Which reminds me - it is a quick and easy recipe!!!

This is always a family favorite, I have been making this for years but last night I decided to make it a bit "healthier" and it really turned out GREAT.  I used fake eggs, sugar-free pudding, low sugar cake mix, fat free cool whip, 1/2 canola oil 1/2 applesauce.  I also used 2 - 8 x 8 pans and froze one for later, put 1/2 the topping in the frig for later as well.

I've made an nearly identical variation of this recipe. I used cream cheese instant pudding instead of the vanilla. Another varation is to use Orange cake mix in place of the yellow cake mix.

Great cake to bring along.  I am not a fan of the ingredients in the processed topping and used 10 ounces of heavy cream, whipped it, added sugar free instant pudding, cheesecake flavor, the can of crushed pineapple and it was soooooooo good!  I think next time I will add the oranges closer to the end to have more bits and pieces in it.  Great cake!

Never heard of this cake before but the name got me to try this delicious cake. Very moist and flavorful. I made it in 2 8inch pans because I didn't have a third pan and it raised so much it made a small mess when it raised up so high. I have subsequently bought a 3rd cake pan to do this. It was a hit with the whole family. Thanks for posting.

I LOVE this cake! I saved some of the drained oranges to put in the topping but that was the only change I made.

Delicious! And very pretty, too! Next time I will make it in 9-inch pans, though, as my layers were very high--almost too high to fit in my cake keeper.

GREAT cake. Made it for my mother's birthday cake. Only changes were I added a few pecans to the whipped cream icing with the crushed pineapple. Everyone loved it.

I tried this cake because of it's unusual name, and also because my husband loves Mandarin oranges and pineapple! This cake was very easy to make, and turned out fluffy and moist. I didn't change a thing on this recipe except placing a few Mandarin oranges on top for decoration. I can't wait until tomorrow, since other reviewers said it was better the longer it sits in the refrigerator! Thanks for sharing this great cake recipe.

I'd give this a 10 if I could! Been making this recipe for about 3 yrs. now. Made one for my neighbor Ed & he
said I could sell these & make a fortune--- best cake he's ever had. Our family's favorite & sooo easy. I do make it in a 9x13 pan though.

This was very easy to make and tasted good too! It's a great summer cake - very cool and refreshing.  I couldn't really tell if the folks who ate it liked it or not though.  No one really said anything and no one went back for seconds.

This is a fabulous cake!  Very easy and so tasty.  This cake doesn’t last long, great for summer parties.  The fruit makes it naturally sweet. I’ve made this cake several times and its always a great hit.  Thanks!!
