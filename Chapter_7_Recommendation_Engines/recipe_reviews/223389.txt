I'm rating this for the beef sauce, which is simplicity itself and lent a wonderful flavor to my stri-fry. I used different veggies, no water chestnuts or cabbage, and omitted the 4-minute simmer because we like our veggies tender-crisp and there was no liquid in the pan anyway. Because I was using dryer veggies I should have doubled the sauce and will from now on. The sauce makes a great base for beef stir-fry and couldn't be easier. I wasn't serving wine tonight, so used mirin for the wine and it worked well. The sauce is my new base recipe for beef stir-fry. Thanks!

So, I actually changed this recipe quite a bit, I tripled the sauce and substituted Apple juice for the white wine. Added 2 teaspoons garlic powder to the sauce. I made this without Beef. Instead of coating beef with the sauce I coated my veggies after I let the veggies cook just a bit (about a min or so) then let them cook until soft. Poured over brown rice was fantastic!

Very good sauce. I made it with a frozen bag of vegetables and added fresh green beans.  I also added fresh Ginger and garlic to the pan before cooking the beef.  Hubby and two out of three kids loved it...that's a keeper!

Great Recipe!! It was Delish!! I added colorful peppers and a few mushrooms instead of the water chestnuts, bok choy, and Chinese cabbage.. I also added just a splash of teriyaki marinating sauce to the sauce mixture for the steak.. To make it easier to shop, I just picked up a stir fry veggie mix from the produce section at Walmart.. My family enjoyed it!! Will try again.. And again!!

I really like this recipe. Although, I have changed and added a few things.I did not add frozen veggies, I like them fresh. And I have added to some mushroom soy sauce and Hoi-sin sauce, just a few tsp. for some more taste. I only tried it with water and I will try it today with Apple juice :) Also, I did not add water chestnuts because I did not have any. Lastly, I doubled the ginger and added garlic. SO GOOD! Thank you!

I just made this and it is FANTASTIC!  The only change I made was, instead of fresh ginger, I used the equivalent in dry ginger.  I don't think it hurt.  According to my dry ginger, 1/4 teaspoon of dry ginger equals 1 tsp of fresh.  I seriously don't think it made a difference as my result was incredibly tasty.

I altered the recipe a little, in that I did not use bok choy or water chestnuts because I am not a fan of either.  I also added more broccoli, onions and added mixed veggies to stretch the meal. As far as flavor, my family thought it was bland and thought it was missing something, so I added garlic, some more soy sauce and soyaki that I purchased from Trader Joe's.  Although I altered it somewhat, I will use this recipe again as a base.

I'm not sure what happened. I have tried this recipe twice, exactly as written, and both times the sauce turned into a gelatinous blob. The flavor was good but I ended up scraping the sauce out while cooking the beef because it was turning into gelatin. Maybe adding water would've helped? Also I used all fresh veggies and added water chestnuts.

The flavor was great but I just can't imagine the 10 minute prep time! It took my husband and me at least30 minutes to wash and prep and the large bok choy and cabbage would not fit in our huge wok. Maybe we were supposed to use the small bok choy. Next time I think I will try using the frozen veggies!

Restaurant taste at home! My husband and I were very pleased with this recipe. I did add 1 clove of garlic. I'm not a ginger lover, so next time I might lessen the ginger to 1 or 2 teaspoons. My husband loved it the way it was and said he wouldn't change a thing.
Great recipe! Thank you!

Delicious! This was popular with both my adventurous and picky family members. It strikes the balance of interesting, but not overwhelming flavors.

This was awesome! The only changes I made were to add some red pepper flakes and mushrooms. No Bok Choy because it was horrible looking in the store. Will definitely put it in next time. Loved the flavors.

This sauce is a go-to now. I will never make stir-fry any other way! I always double the sauce cause its so great- add canned babycorn and take out the cabbage.

I made each set of vegetables & beef separate and kept them in a warm oven, then just combined it at the end since my wok was not big enough for everything at once.

Quick, easy , and yummy with stuff I have around the house!  The longest part of the cooking time is by far the rice, so use white rice if you're in a crunch and you'll cut out 30 minutes.  I didn't use the veggies listed here, but it turned out amazing with broccoli, sweet potatoes, carrots and onion.  I also addd fresh garlic to the marinade  Yum!  Will defintely star this and keep for later!

Really glad I tried this recipe.  Tastes fresh, not artificial like purchased marinades.  Put marinade in big ziploc along with sliced beef.  Squished it all around and then put it in refrig till I needed it, about 1hr later.  I used broccoli, carrots, snow peas, water chesnuts, and red pepper.  Gotta have the minced fresh ginger; that's what makes the marinade!

This recipe is pretty good.  You can change the veggies with what you have on hand.  The only problem tends to be the sauce. All I did was add about 1/4 cup or so of water to the pan near the end.  If you double the sauce, I think it would tend to be too salty or too much soy sauce flavor, if you choose to use low salt soy sauce.  Other than that, it's a good recipe.

WOW.  This was absolutely spectacular!  I'm glad I read the reviews and doubled the sauce.  I added half the sauce while cooking the meat, then threw in the rest after I added the veggies back in.  I added some minced garlic to the marinade and to the veggies while sauteeing.  Also threw in some sliced red bell pepper with the veggies.  My 10 year old daughter raved about this meal as well.  I had never tried bok choy before, and really enjoyed the crunch and flavor it added.  Asked my grocer about the Chinese cabbage and was directed to the Napa cabbage, glad I found it.  All in all, this has become a new family favorite!

Easy and good. It does not tell when to put the ginger sauce in when cooking. I put it in when the meat was finished along with the veggies. It is a very good sauce.

This is really good. I have tried many different stirfry sauces and seasonings and this is definitely one of the best. I didn't use vegetable oil or cornstarch. I used the sauce more as a marinate than a sauce. If you want it as more of a sauce, using the cornstarch is probably a good idea.

This was a simple and delicious meal. I doubled the portions because  I had more beef and I also used brown sugar instead of white sugar.

wonderful and quick weeknight meal! I substituted fresh snow peas, broccoli, and julienne carrots and left out all other vegetables and it was great with just the right amount of "sauce"

It was a little salty and I love salt, so next time I’ll use less soy sauce. I also doubled the sauce, which I’ll do again next time. We used Asian stir fry noodles with it. Delish!

I liked this recipe. My first time cooking this and I increased the volume of all ingredients by 33% to get leftovers. While all was good my personal taste would have been less soy sauce and more onions.  I used riced cauliflower instead and it worked great.

I read a lot of the reviews and decided right then that the sauce would be doubled. The whole family enjoyed this to the end. I added extra broccoli and pea pods and omitted the bok choi and cabbage. (Not family favorites)  Will definitely make again!

I had to cook the veggies in two separate batches... stir constantly. Doubled the ginger... yet flavor a bit lacking. 
I'd suggest you increase the soy/starch mix by 50%.
I'll make it again!

Great recipe! I used what I had—broccoli, celery, regular cabbage. And I didn't have any dry white wine so I used half cabernet and half sauvignon blanc. I also used just 1 T of sugar instead of 2—absolutely no harm done. Simple and delicious recipe. I can see all kinds of ways to use this with whatever ingredients I have on hand.

Used a different combination of veggies because I just buy whatever I buy. I thinned the sauce a bit with beef broth once the beef was cooked. Makes a thick savory sauce.

this was fine. I cannot say my family was blown away by the taste. I marinated the beef for about 1/2 hour before cooking it and that didn't help bring out the flavor. It was an ok base, but needs some extra spices to make it really great.

Used sirloin tip steak, sliced on the diagonal against the grain, for tenderness. Recommend doubling the sauce. Added 2 crushed garlic cloves to the sauce. Used Apple juice in lieu of wine, because I'd rather drink the wine!

I thought I followed the instructions quite closely, but my sauce turned to paste while stir frying the meat, and made the dish look quite horrific.  The flavour was good though.  Next time, I'll just toss the beef with the ginger and stir fry, then add the soy mixture last as a sauce.

What I like about this recipe is that it makes a great base from which to experiment. No bok choy? No problem! Just toss in whatever you've got in the vegetable drawer. When I made it, I didn't even have any broccoli. Just tossed some extra red and green peppers and some frozen pass in found in the bottom of the freezer. Forgot to turn on the rice cooker? No worries;  3 minutes in billing water and the rice noodles were ready. It turned out great. Thanks for a new favorite.

I apologize for rating a recipe when I made changes, but I did make the sauce more or less as directed. However, I did use  frozen stir fry vegetables since I had them. My family and I really enjoyed the flavor.  I may add a little garlic chili sauce next time. Thanks for an easy, delicious recipe.

Like LucyLove, I am rating the sauce.  I had to change the vegetables to suit everyone's tastes.  
Will definitely make this again.  The sauce was a hit with everyone!  Only substitution in it was using chicken stock in place of wine.  Next time I'm going to try Apple Juice

We loved this recipe! I was out of water chestnuts and compensated by using a few more veggies. Omitted the Chinese cabbage, but the bok choy has a great flavor and didn't miss it at all!

Excellent meal. I have made this meal several times and it is a huge success every time. I did not use as much soy sauce as called for (1/4 cup less)

I made this for the first time. It will not be the last time.  I substituted chicken stock for the wine and left out the cabbage as I don't like cabbage.   my daughter came home from work and ate some of the leftovers. she asked if we ordered from a new place. that it was much better then our usual takeout.  when I told her I made it she made me promise to make this again.  this is her new favorite

I made the sauce exactly as the recipe said and just had vegetable stir fry as a side dish.   I enjoyed it but found it a bit bland.   But still, my family enjoyed it and ate it all.

Added crushed garlic and seeded chilli into marinade and used rice wine. Also used more varied mixture of veggies with less broccoli & whole large onion. I added noodles into stir fry instead of having over rice.

This is my new "go to" sauce for stir fry.  It was absolutely delicious.  I liked the fact that I didn't have to add any pre-made sauces.   The next time I am going to try substituting garlic for the ginger to make a garlic sauce.  I did double the sauce but not the corn starch.  It was really thick so I thinned it down with chicken broth.  I also used 1/2 low sodium soy sauce and 1/2 coconut amino (which is soy free soy sauce and much lower in sodium).  Thank you for posting this recipe.  It is yummy!

The sauce for this recipe is outstanding, will prob double next time though.  What can I say, I like sauce.  There are just two of us and the full recipe will have us eating left overs for a couple of days.  But what a great way to get your daily requirement of veg's, and with that wonderful sauce the flavors just keep getting better.

I minced garlic and added to the marinade which I boiled and made a sauce. I added a lot more carrots and onions to clean out fridge.
The bok choy at grocers were huge, maybe 2 pounds each, so I only used one.

Rice is never served with meat and vegtables served over it.  Put the stir fry in one bowl or plate and the rice in another.

Loved this. Even my picky eater husband liked it. I used only pea pods, though, as my husband won't eat many veggies. Had to use ground ginger, too, as I had no fresh in the house  (1/4 tsp ground ginger to replace 1 tbsp of fresh. )

This was super delicious.  The amount of sauce was perfect (I find that most recipes are dry for me).  The basic recipe is fantastic, but I made some changes based on my own tastes.  I added a red bell pepper, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes, halved.  I left out the cabbage and bok choy because I think they are just sort of fillers and don't provide a ton of texture or health benefits to a dish.  Lastly, I don't care at all about rice, so I used yakisoba noodles found in the produce section.   Such a tasty meal - I will definitely try this again.

Kitchenista Jane, baby take a bow!This recipe is wonderful. I made this today for the first time and used apple juice instead wine for the meat . It turned out great. If your making a large quantity of this stir fry you may want to double the recipe. Be careful follow the recipe, I almost forgot to add the sugar. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

I found the base a little thicker than I like and added Chinese Five Spices  to the base to give it an authentic asian taste.  I also didn't use the bok choy or water chestnuts because I didn't have any and added mandarin oranges at the end.

Absolutely the dish for leftover steak! Steak had no BBQ seasonings just steak seasoning and Worcester sauce. I had no cabbage used apple juice no wine. I added more apple juice and water to ensure a sauce, in total between 1-1/2 to 2 cups of liquid.  Yum yum!  By using the leftover steak the cooking of the meat was bypassed.  In total 40 minutes from bringing out the pans to serving!  Excellent dinner for during the work week.  Try this you won't be sorry!

This recipe was great and easy to change and make unique. Instead of the suggested veggies, we only used onions and peppers. The dish turned out great. The meat was so full of flavor. If I had to choose to do one thing differently, I would use smaller pieces of meat because the meat i used was to small to cut and to big to put in your mouth.

Family loved it...so did I!  Adjustments made:  Didn't have bok choy on hand and substituted sugar for 1 tblsp of honey.  Also, used spicy soy sauce instead of the regular one for some added flare and instead of white wine, used red since it is what I had on hand.  I must say....it turned out awesome!

this was SO good!  always using what we have on hand.. i used some rice cooking wine instead of white.. regular peas for the pea pods.. green onion for white.. and 2 stalks of thinly sliced celery for the water chestnuts.. regular green cabbage for the chinese cabbage and left out the bok choy all together as well as the sugar and cornstarch for the marinade, but added a large clove of garlic to it.. added about 4 oz sliced mushrooms to the other veggies.. cooked the marinated beef first.. took the beef out once cooked.. added the leftover marinade into the wok.. then threw in the veggies.. cooked until crisp tender.. added the beef back and then added some linguine instead of the brown rice.. like others there wasn't enough sauce left at the end.. but the veggies and beef were moist and salty enough to go well with the pasta.. ty so much for the recipe

This is a good base. I used fresh steam in bag asian veg and steamed 2 min.  I subbed 1 tbl ground ginger and added to corstarch mixture. Seared sirloin in sesame oil (reserved liquid) then added the steamed veggie and reserved sauce. Then added about a cup of water just because we like it "saucy". Excellent! A keeper and soooo easy.

This is by far the best stir-fry sauce I have tried, and so easy!  You can certainly add whatever veggies you have on hand- I also used garlic and sliced onion.  I would only use fresh veggies though, as well as double the sauce.

Followed all the directions, except left out Chinese cabbage because I couldn't find it. The sauce gives a very low yield in comparison to the vegetables required. And you'll need a huge skillet or frying pan. Mine was overflowing with veggies. All in all, it was very bland even though I had added extra minced and ground ginger, and I was disappointed since I had to buy ingredients I normally don't have.
