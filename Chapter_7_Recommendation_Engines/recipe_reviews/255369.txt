This sandwich was OK, probably not something I would repeat. I only used maybe 1/2 T of chocolate chips and just a sprinkling of a cinnamon sugar mixture instead of a full tablespoon of sugar. I thought it was plenty sweet with the bananas and peanut butter and all the extra sugar wasn't needed. I toasted this in the broiler for 5 minutes. I found myself thinking it needed to be "chunky" since it is called "Chunky Monkey"-- I think chunky peanut butter would be good on this.
