SO. GOOD. Oh my gosh! I could go on and on just about the dough alone--it's perfect! It's beautiful to knead, it bakes up wonderfully, tastes fantastic, and has the best texture! The only things I did differently was to make this all by hand (I used a good ol' fashioned wooden spoon) instead of using a mixer, and used ground ginger in place of mace. Oh, and I needed 4 tbsps of melted butter to dunk all of the dough balls into as well--2 tbsps just wasn't enough. If I had one minor thing I'd do next time, it would be to add a lemony glaze over the top when it's done baking. While there is lemon flavor through the bread, I felt it could use just a touch more (I love lemon though). Highly, highly recommend making this! I know I'll be making it again for sure! (Maybe with some blueberries in it next time too!)
