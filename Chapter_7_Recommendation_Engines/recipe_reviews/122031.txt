yam! I used 2 sticks of margarin in this recipe, and about 3/4 cup of each  sugar instead of 1 cup. It turned out very well! Crunchy, brown and healthy. My son likes them a lot!

This was my first time using whole wheat flour and it came out amazing! Esp. for the 420 crowd. Everyone loved them, thanks!

These are super easy and SO TASTY! I used all butter (I don't use shortening in my baking) and it worked perfectly. I also didn't flatten them down with a glass (just being lazy) and it made for a semi-crisp outside, and soft, semi-gooey inside. Next time I will flatten them a bit and see which way we like best. Thank you for a great, no-fail recipe!

I was looking for a "healthy" cookie, and this was great.  It was wary b/c there was only wheat flour, but there wasn't that wierd wheat flavor you get when you bake bread with only wheat.  I also replaced the sugar with Splenda sugar substitue not regular Splenda,(1 cup total instead of two) then added a little molasses to make up for no brown sugar.  I am not a big fan of shortening, so I used two sticks of butter and 1/3 cup shortening.  I skipped the sugar covered cup, and just pressed them down with a fork once.  The kids loved them, and were excited that they were "healthy"- thanks for the great idea:)

Really delicious, but healthy? No. Great "regular" cookie.

These cookies have a nice, crispy texture.  Our family could taste the whole-wheat flavor, and the cookies were also a little bland.  The next time I make them, I will probably add some cinnamon, nutmeg, or other spices.  Otherwise, these are great!

These were fabulous!  I followed the recipe but added a tsp of ginger to the mix.  I used Smart Balance instead of margerine or butter and Canola Oil for the shortning.  Pretty darn healthy considering they taste that good.  According to the red lines...I can't spell at all.

Very basic.  Bland.  I like baking with whole wheat flour, I enjoy the taste but this recipe is missing something.  For my second batch I added a couple drops of almond extract and a nice big dash of cinnamon ~ which were both great decisions.  With those modifications I may consider making this recipe again.

This is a great basic sugar cookie recipe that uses whole wheat flour.  My cookies turned out significantly darker than those pictured.  They make great "tea biscuits."

I'm giving this 5 stars because I never thought a cookie would be this good when made with whole wheat flour.  It is an unadorned sugar cookie.  I really wanted something with more flavor, so I added coconut flakes, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  Next time, I'll add chopped nuts.

The weirder the name of the recipe, the more I want to try it.  When I grew up, cookies were always sweet, most had chocolate, and they were usually soft and chewy.  All good.  This was very different but in a GOOD way!  They're less sweet than I'm used to, and they are excellent with milk or coffee.  And, yes, my children who like sweet, chewy cookies that usually include chocolate DID like these, too.

A very crunchy cookie!  We love whole wheat flour- these cookies are a great way to eat it more often! Next time, I will play around with adding spices.  I used all butter, no shortening.

Great recipe for diabetics. I sub the sugar with truvia & also I didn't have vanilla flavoring so I used coconut flavoring. Everyone really liked the coconut but I got to bake them again with vanilla. Very easy to make. I'm glad I found it.

These were amazingly delicious and much better than I expected!  They were nice and sweet, and mine actually had a soft center which was great.  Will definitely make again and I would recommend anyone to try these, even if you are not a fan of whole wheat.

Really enjoyed these. They are thin and crunchy sugar cookie type cookies. I used all brown sugar since brown sugar is essentially white sugar covered in molasses--it's already a mix of the two--and used whole wheat pastry flour which has less gluten. I think it could also be a base for other delicious cookies!

I loved these cookies! I messed up with one batch and put the oven on 325 instead of 375 so that batch came out soft. They were still so good!

Very, very good! A new favorite in our family. Perfect combo of crunchy and chewy. The recipe made 4 dozen for us and I baked them for only 9 minutes.

These were pretty tasty. i used a lot of honey to make up for my lack of sugars and had to add more flour til i liked the consistency of the dough. so i made a lot of cookies. personally i like them frozen...weird definitely worth a try!
