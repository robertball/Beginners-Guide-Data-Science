Something is not right with this recipe as written.  The taste is good, but the consistency is soupy!  I don't see how this dough could be rolled out!  I had to add 1/2 cup flour to drop this dough onto my pizzelle iron, but that was not thick enough to roll out!  As is, these cookies are rubbery!  I will do some tweaking when I make these again!

Most recipes for Goro call for 6 cups of flour, which is probably why the other reviewer here said it wasn't a good consistency. Also, traditionally, you whip the cream and fold into the eggs sugar etc, then add the flour. If you want to try Goro, I suggest you look for a different recipe than this one.
