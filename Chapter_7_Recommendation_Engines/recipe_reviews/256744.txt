This recipe turned out really well for me. I was looking for a cookie recipe versatile enough to be used to make Valentine cookies. I know shortbread type recipes do not spread too much. I halved the recipe and used a cookie scoop. I placed two cookie scoops near each other. Then pressed them down inside  a heart shaped cookie cutter. I baked them on parchment. Half the recipe, prepared this way, made 12 cookies and they needed an additional 5 minutes to bake. Thanks, and happy valentines month!

Delicious cookies.  The instructions don't say that they will remain in the ball shape. If you desire flat cookies like the picture press them down or use a cookie cutter.
