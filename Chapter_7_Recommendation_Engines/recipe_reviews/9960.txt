This recipe was super yummy, with my tweaks!  I think what was missing for all those who thought it needed an oomph was some vanilla.  I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, omitted the molasses (for an unadulterated cinnamon flavour) and went crazy with 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon.  Definitely use real butter.  Yummy!  *munch, munch*

Perfect!  I have never had cinnamon cookies before...but after reading the reviews, I decided to try them.  I love to bake and cook...I would not change a thing.  They are wonderful.  Three baking tips:  as one reviewer suggested, use parchment paper...they'll be even more perfect!  Chill the dough just a bit before dropping them onto cookie sheets.  They won't spread thin. (Because of the butter)  Lastly, for perfectly round cookies that are all the same size, as odd as it sounds, shape them into squares that are 1 inch on all sides, and maybe 1/2 inch on top and bottom.  They'll look like they are tall, but they *do* come out perfect.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This is an "okay" cookie with the potential to be better, but as written only merits three stars.  Some reviewers were disappointed that this cookie turns out flat and some of the submitted photos illustrated that. That didn't appeal to me, so in an effort to eliminate that problem I used half butter/half shortening, added an extra 1/4 cup flour, made sure not to over-cream the butter and sugar and chilled the dough for about an hour.  I was tempted to reduce the amount of butter too and ultimately wish I had, because the cookie still turned out flatter than I would have preferred.  Noticing this was missing,  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon salt and I can't imagine how flat tasting this cookie would have been without those additions. The cookie is light and crispy/chewy, with a mild cinnamon and molasses flavor - four stars with my changes.  I'd call it an enhanced sugar cookie.  Not a bad tasting cookie at all, but if you're looking for the cookie to reflect its name I'd increase the cinnamon significantly.   Bottom line, I suppose I could play around with this even more to resolve some of its issues, but a good, well-written recipe should require no changes.

This is a great recipe!  I get 7 dozen cookies using a 100 scoop.  If you work too slowly, the dough will start to dry up.

These cookes spread out flat while cooking so give them room.

Hint:  Spray your measuring spoons (for the molasses) with vegie cooking spray and the molasses will not stick in them.

WONDERFUL Recipe!!!  These cookies are delightful!
I added a tiny bit more flour (after the first sheet baked) so they wouldn't spread as thin.  They have a light buttery-cinnamon taste and are tender-crisp-chewy.  Everyone loved them.  THANKS!  I'll make these often.

A very good cookie recipe. I replaced the white sugar with turbinado sugar and eliminated the molasses, and the result is even better than the original recipe. Much more cinnamony without that molasses taste.

I thought these were AMAZING. Best cinnamon cookies I have ever had, if I do say so myself. Followed the recipe exactly aside from adding an eensy extra bit of cinnamon, because I really like cinnamon... :] Oh, I put a few pinches of white sugar on top before baking them as well. They had crispy edges and soft centres... Delicious! Even everyone at school and my parents loved them. This recipe's a keeper.

These cookies are unlike any I've made before, and I loved them. They taste like Cinnamon Life cereal. However, I had to cook mine for a lot longer than ten minutes, and they still were mushy and flat! Not too appealing to the eye. However, the second batch I made the cookies much smaller (about the size of a walnut) and had better luck. I also sprinkled them with more cinnamon before baking.

These are possibly the best cookies I have ever had.  I had to freeze some of them so my family would not eat them all in one day.  Great for fall, curl up with a book, a mug of hot chocolate and a plate full of these.......thanks for the GREAT recipe!

My kids, husband, and I really enjoy these cookies. The first time I made them I followed the given instructions, but the next time I revised a couple things. Instead of using molasses I used honey, and instead of using 1 1/2 cup of white sugar, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. They turned out amazing!

I am so glad that I tried this recipe.  Not only is it easy, they're delicious!
It's amazing something this easy can taste so good.  One quick word of advice. 
If you freeze the dough make sure it is thawed out before baking, otherwise, the
cookies have a different puffier texture.  (but it doesn't affect the great taste!

I didn't add vanilla or salt, even though I meant to... I'm glad I didn't though, because these cookies have a perfect flavor.  They taste like a cinnamon bun in a cookie. :)  Yes they are flat, but I find it charming.  I probably doubled the cinnamon, but I didn't measure, so I'm not sure.

I rate these at 4-1/2 stars!  I used 2 tbsp cinnamon and 2 tbsp molasses and decreased the sugar to 1-1/4 cups.   I ran a test batch through @ 11 minutes.  9-10 minutes works best.  Nice and chewy if not overbaked!  Thanks for sharing!

Over all, the texture and everything was great.  Golden brown on the bottom and soft all over.  But the taste for me was so-so.  Not bad, just not something I   would ever crave.  I did change a few things...I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of white,and about 1/4 cup of shortening in place of butter.  The original amount of everthing was still there, I just had to sub in a few things bc I ran out of white sugar and butter.  :)

Quick. Easy. Very easy. Piece of cake to do, and the cookies are so delicious, I was tempted to make a whole extra batch because I just know these will not stay long. The cinnamon taste lingers delightfully. Hmmm... maybe dip them in Cool Whip?  I think I'll try it...

This cookie has that perfect crunch.  I made it exactly as written using high quality Vietnamese cinnamon.  The flavor was just right and perfect with a cup of coffee or glass of milk.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing!

A lovely cookie that tastes like autumn!  It made the house smell incredible.  I didn't want a flat cookie so I added a half cup more flour and a bag of Hershey's Cinnamon Chips.

These were amazing but having just baked the big and chewy chocolate chip cookies and having read reviews I did alter the recipe. I made the following changes:

-1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup of light brown sugar (didn't have plain brown sugar)
-I did the one egg and added an egg yolk(at room temperature instead of right out of the fridge)
-1 1/2 tbsp of vanilla in place of the molasses (I love cinnamon too much and wasn't going for a gingerbread taste)
-2 tbsp's of cinnamon instead of 1
-I melted the one cup of butter and let it cool to room temperature before using it
-I only used 1 tsp of baking soda instead of 1 1/8.  Honestly, I just didn't have the right measuring spoons but it still turned out fine.
-I added 1/2 tsp of salt and used salted butter because it was all I had
-Cooked for 13 minutes exactly after rolling into tbsp sized balls

Delicious!!!

I used brown sugar in place of the white sugar I'm out of at the moment, and it made for quite a nice cookie.  Particularly good fresh from the oven!  These put me in mind of the types of cookies 1950's housewives would send in their husbands' lunchboxes everyday.

We think these are awesome! The cookies DO come out flat but they're beautiful cookies, crispy around the edges & chewy in the middle. Perfect amount of cinnamon but I suppose you could add more if you wanted. Mine were done to perfection at 11 min. I'll be making these often-they go great w/my coffee:) Thank you!

This is a GREAT recipe! I took the advice from "spiritanointed" and replaced the molasses with 1 1/2 tsps of vanilla.  I also used 1 cup of white sugar (like the recipe says) but substituted the remaining 1/2 cup with brown sugar.  This adds great texture and tast to the recipe.  As a final touch I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top of the cookies right when they came out of the oven.... so yummy!!!  Happy baking.

Next time I'll probably double the cinnamon for this to TRULY be a CINNAMON cookie.  When I first tasted them, I didn't get the cinnamon taste until the end, and I really wanted BAM - CINNAMON cause I love cinnamon. 

These are a flat cookie as the pictures show, but that was okay for me - made them different than most cookies that I make and they still were chewy.

So good!  The only change I made was to use and extra TBS of cinnamon & was very glad I did.  These taste sort of like what you would get if a molasses cookie and a snickerdoodle had a baby.  Thanks for sharing, my coworkers loved them!

These cookies are wonderful.  They are a big hit in my house.  They weren't puffy and cakelike like in the picture.  They ended up being flat which was fine and I only cooked them for 8 min.  They seemed to stay soft and chewy that way. They have great flavor but I thought they needed an icing so I made a cream cheese icing to put on top of the cookies.  I used 4 oz of cream cheese, softened, 1 T of butter, 2 C powdered sugar and 1 1/2 T of milk.  I would probably half this recipe as it does make quite a bit and I think half of this would be sufficient to ice the amount of cookies in this recipe or you could always double the cookie recipe because they will disappear fast.

Recipe as described makes 5 dozen cookies. Dough is not sticky so it is easy to work with. I couldn't stop myself from eating a dozen of these as they were cooling.

This is just about the easiest cookie recipe!! Unfortunately my mixer broke, so I whipped this up by hand and I think it was as quick if not quicker without the mixer! It's a real winner in our home both with ease and time and makes a ton of yummy cookies! (Though I must admit, I do add a tiny bit more cinnamon!!!! I just love the stuff!)Thank you Mellan for sharing this recipe!

These fabulous cookies are simple, elegant, impressive and addictive. Try using Vietnamese cinnamon (I got some from Bakers' Catalog) for bright, strong cinammon flavor.

These cookies were so warm and comforting.  I definitely made these more than a few times already.
They turned out perfect each time. 
Perfect cookie to go with a hot cup of coffee on those cold nights.

This recipe was super easy and quick, yet yielded a beautiful batch of tasty cookies. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I made a few alterations - I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of the molasses and doubled the cinnamon, like other reviewers suggested. Without the extra cinnamon it would've been a bit bland. With the adjustments, I recommend this recipe!

"OKay" cookies. Didn't flatten out as predicted.   For my repeat batch I would: use same amount of butter, 1 cup of sugar, same egg-molasses-baking soda, 2 cups flour, and more cinnamon.

Ok so it's been two days since I first read the recipe and made it two days in a row...! They are just amazing..! The kids love them and the recipe is just so easy and it takes so little time to make them AND to bake them!   For baking I would suggest placing three to four teasp. in a row in order to give the cookied space to cook evenly.   Sprinkling some extra cinnamon before baking and some brown sugar makes them divine...!  The baking time is just right, because even though they look and feel really soggy after 10 mins in the oven, when they cool down they are as crunchy as a cookie can be!  Adding some vanilla and some more cinnamon literally cover the egg smell!  Awsome!

These turned out great but I changed them up a bit. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, omitted the molasses and the baking powder and added a little extra cinnamon.

This recipe does make a good tasting cookie, but I would not call it a cinnamon cookie.  The molasses kinda takes over the cinnamon, but then again it doesn't taste like a molasses cookie.  I tasted more like a cross between a brown sugar cookie and a molasses cookie.  I suggest you tasting the dough and adding more cinnamon to suit your taste before you bake them.

I tried making this, and the results turned out great. Instead of using molasses I used an alternative of karo syrup or glucose syrup, and made it 2tbs. The cookie became very chewy and all of the people who tried it loved it. I just looks dull and plain tho -- like the pizza dough. So I covered it again with sugar and cinnamon on top to look more livelier. -- loved this recipe!

They were just okay. Really, nothing exciting. Boring.  Very soft and doughy, not "chewy".  Even though I baked them for a lot longer than the recipe stated and watched them carefully they still seemed to have no crunch at all, even around the edges, and too soft in the middle.  Flavor is not great either, although I did take other reviewers suggestions to heart and added brown sugar with the white, vanilla, and doubled the cinnamon.  I also added about 1/8 tsp. of allspice and 1/2 tsp. of ginger. Still didn't have much taste.  BUT, I got beautiful looking cookies by measuring with a small ice cream scoop, rolling into balls and then rolling in coarse sugar.  Looked great, but blah and ho hum.  Won't make again.

WOW!!  These are some of the best cookies I've ever made, and I make cookies at least twice a week.  I did make a few changes after reading the reviews here.  I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added about a tsp more cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp salt.  The salt is really needed to compliment the sweetness of cookies.  The dough was easy to work with--I just scooped about a tablespoon into a rough ball and slightly flattened it for each cookie.  Baked for 8 minutes, and the results were fantastic.  I used Silpat baking mats and had no problems with the cookies sticking or falling apart, but did let them cool for a few minutes before removing them to wire racks.  I won't even admit how many I ate before the kids got home from school!  The cookies are crisp on the outside, but so buttery and chewy on the inside.  The flavor is fantastic.  I will certainly be making these again soon!

I dropped these by tablespoon fulls on parchment paper. I baked for 13 minutes and let cool on pan for about 5-10 minutes. Everyone loved the bigger cookies! It's the perfect combination of a crisp outside and soft inside.

These tasted wonderful!  The only thing was that the dough was so wet and gooey..  I would advise using more flour.  And when I took the cookies out of the oven, I couldn't get them of the sheet!  They crumpled, so I refrigerated them overnight and then poured milk over it and used it as cereal the next morning!  Yum.

These are excellent. I replaced the molasses with corn syrup and decreased the baking soda, used half brown sugar and upped the cinnamon a bit. I still think they need something else to bring out the cinnamon more, but they are great cookies.

These were great - quick, easy, and delicious! I made the recipe as stated, and divided the batch into 3 parts - one part I added nuts, another chocolate chips, and the last batch I dipped in cinnamon sugar. Made them for a co-worker's birthday - they were gone by 10am! Will definitely make these again!

I am making a variety of different cookies that go well with coffee and packaging them with some high quality beans to give to my office staff this year.  I made these, and took the suggestion to roll them into small balls and coat with white sugar.  They turned out perfectly and will complement coffee nicely.

Mmmm! These were the the best cookies I have EVER made! I love it! Very cinnamony! (is that a word?) We absolutely loved them- and the kids said that the dough was extremely good. I would have given them 10 stars if they would have let me!

These cookies were wonderful!  They were light and crispy, but still slightly chewy in the middle - the texture reminded me of ginger snaps.  I added a little bit extra cinnamon, and they tasted perfect.  I baked them to take to a meeting, and they were a big hit with everyone there!

Great cookie! I used turbinado sugar instead of white,alsopressed each pat of dough into a mixture of turbinado sugar and cinnamon. The course texture of the sugar gave the top a nice crunch. One batch I added some grated apple with the excess moisture pressed out. Quite yummy indeed.Thanks!

Great recipe.  I sifted the flour, baking soda and cinnimon.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening.  Cooked 8 min on convection bake and left on the cookie sheet for 3 min.  Excellent cookie, I will make again.  Thank you!

Double the cinnamon, add vanilla, chill the dough, roll it into balls before baking, and these are the best cinnamon cookies in the world. Amazing every time.

Very unique cookie.  I used the one tablespoon of cinnamon in the recipe and sprinkled the cookies with some cinnamon sugar because I like the sugary glitter it makes.  These cookies are divine!!  It will be interesting to taste them cool because I don't think they will last that long.

Only leave in for 9 - 10 min. 
9 for softer, gooey cookies.
12 for harder cookies.

Very delicious and moist cookie which didn't take long to prepare. I loved that the recipe called for ingredients that I already had on hand.  I followed recipe as directed. I did refrigerate dough for approximately 30 minutes as others suggested. I also dipped each ball of dough into a cinnamon and sugar mixture for that added sweetness and attractiveness of the cookie. I almost cut the recipe in half, glad I didn't because I'm almost ashamed to say I've already eaten the majority of the batch they were that good.

Something different & will make again. These are nice & soft in the middle. I did take others suggestions & used both white & brown sugar. Also decided to use part hone & part molasses because molasses can be strong & suggestions were to substitute honey. A nice fall season cookie.

I added the vanilla extract as another reviewer suggested. It was looking too dry before adding the vanilla...I would like to try it with a bit of added apple juice if moisture is needed. Also, instead of molasses I used brown sugar as a substitute since I did not have molasses. According to another Web site, 3/4 the amount of the molasses called for is the amount of brown sugar to use...so 1 1/8 tbsp. in this case. Awesome cookies and one of the easiest recipes!

I took the suggestion of other reviewers and decreased molasses to 1 tbspn and increased cinnamon to 2 tbspn.  I sprinkled one batch with sugar and left the other plain - they were equally delicious!  Thanks for a great easy recipe!

As someone said, they added a little extra flour.  I made it with 2.5 cups and worked well.  They are like sugar cookies, but with cinnamon and molasses.  Definitely will make again.  Recipe said it would make 36.  I made 78.  Came out perfect size.  Instead of dropping by teaspoons, I rolled into a log form about the size of a nickle circumference and cut into about 1/2 inch pieces, rolled into a ball, slightly flatten them.  Regular size 1/2 sheet baking pan, used parchment paper and baked for 11 min.   Definitely will make again. 35 cookies fit perfectly on one sheet.

Just made these...they're really good!!  I took some suggestions from other reviewers, omitted the molasses, added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and put in 2 tbsp of cinnamon.  To me they taste incredibly similar to snickerdoodles, just a whole lot easier.  They came out flat (which I love), slightly crispy on the outer edge, and soft on the inside.  Mine took about 13-14 minutes at least.  Now...have to fight the urge to go back in the kitchen and devour several more.  =)

These were delicious and I got a lot of compliments when I took them to a party.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and molasses...since I didn't have any molasses.  I also added extra cinnamon (about 2 TBSP total).

This is one of our new favorite cookies!  Like others I omitted the molasses - leave that for ginger snaps - But I felt compelled to substitute something in its place so I used honey.  The dough was sticky but I chilled a bit and formed it into two logs and chilled until firm.  I sliced it into 1/4" thick slices then layed one side in a cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Baked for 9 min.  They did spread out to a thin but wonderfully crisp/chewy cookie - LOVE THEM!

Anything with cinnamon in disappears at a rate of knots in this house and these were no different. I used black treacle for the molasses which I think is the UK equivalent. In my oven 10 minutes was the perfect cooking time, crisp on the edges chewy in the middle. Thankyou Mellan.

When I first tasted these cookies, I was in love.  They are the best cookies I have ever tasted in my life, I swear!  I chose this recipe because I am a cinnamon addict, and I'm glad I did.  You see, I generally opt to bake the boring old chocolate chip cookies that can be very fickle.  With these, I had them in the oven for ten minutes and every single one was perfect.  I did change one thing though: I substituted the 1/2 cup of white sugar for 1/2 cup of brown sugar because I am also a huge brown sugar enthusiast.  Everyone who tried these was so glad that I made them.  =D

I followed spiritanointed's suggestions, adding 1 tsp vanilla with the egg, using 2 Tbsp cinnamon, and omitting the molasses. These are fabulous! Not the prettiest cookies I have ever seen, but once you take a bite you won't care. Easy dough to work with.

These were very good. They do as others have said end up a little flat, but they are great looking and great tasting. Just be sure you don't cook them too long though. When I baked them for 12 they came out super crunchy like ginger snaps. 8 minutes resulted in a great, chewy but firm cookie.

I would recommend using a small scoop (I have a small 1/2 inch melon baller/ice cream scooper) this way every cookie is exactly the same amount.  It will ensure the cooking time. 

This recipe was a huge hit.  I have gotten many requests to make it. Thank you!

Oh my flippin' god, these cookies are delicious. I made them with a friend - it was so quick and easy and they taste amaaaaazing. We overbaked them a little (you gotta take them out while they're still kind of soft), but a few seconds in the microwave fixed that. Soo delicious. Thanks for posting!

I made these as written and they were perfect. I baked for 12 min. I did roll some in cinnamon and sugar. They were a little too sweet with the extra sugar os I will just sprinkle more cinnamon next time. These were crispy on the outside and chewy inside- perfect. I rolled them into balls and they flattened and rounded nicely. Picture perfect! Thanks!

I thought these were very good!  The dough is hard to mix as it gets so stiff, but I was hand-mixing and used slightly chilled butter.  They do spread thin, but are nice a chewy.  I used a small ice cream scoop to measure out the balls and baked for 13 mins.  They cam out great, edges were crispy and slightly sandy, with middle being firm and chewy.  A great cookie to have with tea!

These were just WONDERFUL!!!They came out looking very much like  gingersnaps (thin and crackle topped) but were MUCH tastier with just the cinnamon. Slighty crisp around the edges but chewy in the middle.. JUST YUMMY!!!!!

This was just what i was looking for! I wanted to make some cookies to bring to my family's house except i didn't have that many ingredients, but these were perfect, i just substituted pancake syrup for the molasses. The cookies were soft and sweet and my family LOVED them!

I followed this recipe to a T, as I wanted to taste the cinnamon "unadulterated", not with the addition of other spices.  Don't let their plain appearance fool you--very very yummy!

A simple recipe which produces a light cookie with a nice buttery flavor.  I used unsalted butter and molded the cookies into ball form rather than simply dropping the dough per teaspoon onto the baking sheet.  The edges were crisp, the center soft.  These cookies pair nicely with a cup of French Roast. 

I feel as though the recipe could be developed to have a more enhanced flavor; perhaps placing a halved pecan atop the dough or rolling the dough in a mixture of chopped walnuts, cinnamon, and granulated sugar before baking would give a little more depth to the flavor.

Very good, very tasty.  I rather enjoyed the texture and taste of these cookies.  However, they were a bit sticky, so I had to add extra flour, and the cinnamon flavor could have been stronger, so in the final batch, I added extra.  All were very yummy, though, and I enjoyed several before prying myself away from them. :)

Great recipe, although I rolled them in a mixture green and red sugar (the kind of sugar you sprinkle on sugar cookies) and some white sugar.  They looked very fesitive for Christmas. Husband said they were the best in the world. (These are flat tho - at least mine were and probably meant to be -- I would like them to be a little thicker so may add a bit of b. p. next time -- have to cook them exactly at the right temp, which for me was at 350, for 10 minutes, with the baking rack positioned in the middle).

Delicious taste.  I replaced the molasses with vanilla and cut the entire recipe in half.  I got two dozen cookies.  Despite thoroughly chilling my dough and even rolling the dough into balls, My cookies turned out extremely flat, however.  I think it's because of how much butter is in them.  You definitely taste the butter along with the cinnamon.

Based on prior reviews, I decided to make some changes of my own.

Firstly, I upped the flour from 2 1/4 cups to 2 1/2 and doubled the cinnamon. I also substituted the sugar and molasses for 1 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.

Secondly, I added 2 tsp of ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp each of nutmeg, cloves, and vanilla extract. The vanilla gets beaten in with the egg, and the rest of the spices get whisked into the flour mix.

Finally, instead of dropping the dough on the cookie sheet, I rolled it into balls and coated them in white sugar.

These turned out fantastic, and now I have over 6 dozen of them.

Delicious. My changes:  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar with the 1 cup of white sugar.  I added a quick shake of powdered ginger into the dry mix when I added the cinnamon - enough to flavor but not overwhelm. I wasn't sure what type of butter to use and compromised with one stick salted and the other stick unsalted.  I baked in a convection toaster oven at 10 minutes.

Delicious! However, I had to add vanilla, some honey, and a second egg. I didn't melt my butter; I had only softened it. Cook time is somewhere between 10-15 minutes when you make very small cookies. These will probably get pretty crunchy once they cool.

If you use baking powder, it will help the cookies rise instead of being flat.

These cookies were awesome! The only thing I added was a little bit of nutmeg and they turned out perfect!

I took other commenters' advice and added 1.5 tsp vanilla, substituted 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown sugar, added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon (so 2 total), substituted honey for the molasses, and added a little extra flour. The taste was wonderful, even though the cookie was VERY flat no matter how much or how little dough I put on the cookie sheet. I even tried a nonstick muffin tin (without any liners), which didn't work too well (trust me - a flat mess to clean out of the holes). The proper cooking time at my house was 8-10 mins, with 8 mins being for smaller cookies (when I used less dough). My finicky bf ate a ton of them, but he'd eat anything containing cinnamon lol. I liked them quite a lot too - even though I'm not a huge cinnamon freak. Do not overcook them, or like any cookie, they'll get hard and burned on the edges/bottom. I'll probably make these again, but man, I wish they looked more normal lol.

I changed it a little, like most of us. I used 1 tbsp molasses, 2 tbsp cinnamon, added 1/8 cup toffee just for fun, and approximately 1/8 tsp vanilla. I put the dough in the freezer first. After making the walnut sized balls, I put the cookie pan in there fridge for another 5 minutes. 
It cooked for 12 minutes. I took it out after 10 and let them cool but it was clear after a few minutes that wasn't enough time. I took pictures of the before and after oven. I added a roll of quarters for scale in the before pic. Very tasty!

I started with such good intentions. I'm forever modifying recipes I find on the dinner spinner, and I really started out this one with no modifications in mind. Until, that is, I discovered I had run out of cinnamon and had to substitute apple pie seasoning. With a dash of ground ginger added (in for a penny, in for a pound). And then added the salt and vanilla other reviewers had suggested. A touch more baking soda (1.25 teaspoons instead of 1.18 teaspoons). And then rolled them in red sanding sugar, because, why not. 
Seriously so good. I wish you could smell them, worth making just for the smell alone. Favoriting for sure, and making a comeback for holiday cookies this winter I'm positive!

Outstanding. Know your oven as mine were done at 9 minutes, then I let them sit on the baking sheet for another minute. I made them as-is the first time and the second time backed off on the sugar a little bit and heavy on the cinnamon with more successful results. Made little ice cream sandwiches for company using coffee no-churn ice cream. (Dead simple as "Nigella No-Churn coffee ice cream.")

Great recipe! I made a few adjustments that made them perfect! I baked them at 325 degrees for 12-14 minutes and increased cinnamon to 1 1/2 tablespoons, 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. These changes made the cookies soft and delicious.

The taste is okay, but the insides are still gooey, after being baked for 14 minutes.

I combined many other suggestions as based on some reviews I read here: a brick of cream cheese instead of butter, honey instead of molasses, 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 tablespoon extra of cinnamon, and added salt and vanilla.

My brother and sister loved them. However, we won't be making them again.

These came out so soft and chewy! They have a great cinnamon flavor. I subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar for the white sugar and omitted the molasses and added vanilla... just personal preference. This is a great cookie I will be making again!!!

very nice cookie! 10 min was perfect. Delightful with coffee. My mom enjoys coffee and I am giving some of these to her for Christmas :)... I did reduce molasses to 1 tablespoon because I haven't baked with it before. Subtle touch :)

the only reason why i put 4 stars is because i used brown sugar instead of white sugar because i didnt have any white sugar.next time ill try it again and hopefully it'll be good!

Awesome cookies. I didn't change a thing. I thought at first that it would be too sweet but it was just right.

These are AMAZING! They are my families new favorite cookie. I did substitute sucanat for the white sugar & added 1 tsp. vanilla. I baked them for 12 minutes exactly and the middles were a wonderful, chewy cinnamony delight. The outside was crisp and nicely crakled. But it was the taste that was really over the top! Yum! Oh I just remembered I did add an extra 1/2 cup flour so that they would not be flat. I threw everything in my food processor so that these were very quick and easy to make.

I liked these cookies--almost as is.  I say that bc I added just a drop of cinnamon extract to them, and I think that made the cinnamon pop.  Unlike others, I don't mind flat cookies--I like to be able to stack cookies because I tend to be making them for other people, which means I have to find some way of transporting them.  Stackable cookies are just easier for me to wrap and put in containters or ziploc bags.  Other than adding the extract, I didn't do anything differently with these.  They don't look done when you pull them out, but you need to leave them on the cookie sheet for 2-3 minutes to allow them to flatten and crinkle, then transfer them to the rack to cool.  Mine were done at 12 min in the oven.  These turned out slightly crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, how I like cookies!  Thanks for the recipe!

The cookies are delicious, crisp yet soft and chewy. I changed the sugar to 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, and 1/4 cup of this darker coarser brown sugar instead of molasses. I added 1/2 a tablespoon more cinnamon as well, and shaped them into 1 inch squares as suggested. I think these cookies are excellent, but changing it means it isn't the same recipe, so if I could, I would give 4 1/2 stars.

I am rather unsure of these cookies. I've never had a cinnamon cookie like this before. I ate several of them, but I don't know if I'd make the recipe again. I froze part of the dough, so maybe the next batch will be better since the batter will be nice and firm. I wish that I chilled my dough before baking these the first time because they baked very thin. We'll see. =)

Flat, crispy cookie with slightly chewy center.  I used only 1 Tbsp molasses, and almost 2 1/2 cups of flour.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 extra Tbsp cinnamon.  The taste is good but nothing super spectacular.  I would also prefer a softer texture.
...Several days later I am changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  The more I eat, the more I want!  They were not what I wanted to begin with, but now I can't stop eating them!  Truly addicting.

Great tasting cookies.  I substituted molasses with 1 tbsp of dark corn syrup and 1/2 tbsp of honey.  I also added 1 tsp of anise extract and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  These cookies turned out delicious!

These are very tasty cookies. I used the suggestion from another review and omitted the molasses, added more cinnamon and added vanilla. They turned out great except they don't look anything like the photo. They were puffier, which didn't bother me. Great recipe.

I was very excited to make these cookies based on other reviews, but was extremely disappointed with the way the first batch turned out. After a few alterations they are delicious. I guess They are no longer specifically cinnamon cookies, but are way better.     Add:  50g Self raising flour  the rind of 1 lemon finely grated  8 globes from cloves finely ground  1tspn vanilla essence  2 cardamon pods worth of seeds, crushed    These ingredients give the cookies more bite and make them much more tasty.    Also keep the mixture in the freezer in between batches to stop the butter melting and with dosage.

Ok, I noticed something strange here. The recipe supposedly yields 3 dozen cookies, but it says to "drop" them by teaspoons! First of all, the dough was stiff enough to be able to roll into little balls after scooping them with a teaspoon, making the finished cookies look like cute little coins. Secondly, teaspoon-sized cookies in this recipe makes way more than 3 dozen. Perhaps the writer of this recipe meant to say drop by tablespoonfuls? Regardless, these are delicious! I like my cookies chewy and on the softer side, so I only baked these little cinnamon coins for 7 minutes and they were just right. I still have over half a batch of dough left, so I may make some larger ones, but I actually like them bite sized. I cooled them on the sheet pan until they were hard enough to move to a plate. Yum!

I had everything in my pantry already which was perfect at 10pm.  These cookies tasted pretty good.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  My husband ate them all in 3 days.  Next time I will definitely use all-purpose instead.  The cookies didn't come out looking at all like the photo's submitted, lol.  It's a keeper for sure.

This recipe is great. I added a few things and they were wonderful. 1/2 tsp salt goes a long way. I also tried 1 cup of walnuts (chopped fine) It is a thin cookie so I was expecting to fall apart, but they held up well. Finally, I added a 1/2 cup of chopped candied ginger (works best in a food processor with a couple of tbsp of the sugar from the recipe. They came out great! I made them for my boyfriend and his mom tasted one and asked for the recipe!

These cookies are indeed amazing! I followed the recipe to a T other than I added some cinnamon chips I had in the pantry. We loved these and as long as you dont let them brown to much they do stay soft and chewie. These are a nice change of pace from the regular chocolate chip cookie!

AMAZING. These are absolutely delicious, melt in the mouth cookies!! Tip: Don't let them brown around the edges, take them out before they do and they'll be deliciously chewy when they've cooled.

Heavenly! The best and most popular cookie i have ever eaten/baked. Definitely add some vanilla and extra cinnamon. I like to add some ground hot pepper to spice them up even more. Otherwise they are perfect and always come out crispy and a little chewy, like a home made gingersnap. I love molasses cookies and these are my fave.Whenever there is a family gathering people ask me to make them. YOU MUST MAKE THESE ! Addition to this review: I have been making these for a few yrs now and their popularity has expanded, everyone knows x-mas is cinnamon cookie time, i make about a thousand, no-one has ever disliked this cookie, THE BEST RECIPE EVER! Do not substitute the molasses, it makes the cookie.

Very tasty but maybe a little bit harder than what I was expected.. but I was disappointed of the presentation: too flat !!  Ohh and I just replaced molasses by honey because I didn't have some! And add a mix of sugar and ground cinnamon on the top of each cookies before cooking them!

Oooooooh yeeeeeah, are these good! They call for very few ingredients, they're easy to make, and they taste fabulous!  I wasn't sure about the dough at first because it was really crumbly, but they baked up beautifully. My family was eating them as fast as I was putting them on the cooling rack. They have the perfect texture, light & crispy on the outside & chewy on the inside, yum! I DID make some substitutions, but regardless this recipe definitely still deserves 5 stars!  My substitutions were: whole wheat flour, 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening and honey instead of molassas. These cookies are my new favorite, and next time I'll have to make a double batch!

Amazing. Had them on the table at Christmas and they were the first to go. Soft chewy texture, fabulous cinnamon flavor. Mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law both begged for the recipe :)

Wonderful! Quick, easy, delicious. I didn't have molasses so I used honey instead and they were great.

At first I was a little leary about making these...I have never even seen molassess before.  But my husband loves cinnamon and ginger snaps, so I thought what the heck.  I am glad I did.  They are absolutely wonderful!  Also...very easy to make.

I loved this receipe!  My tweaks were to forgo the molasses. Mine were a little too cinnamony, but not much.  I put a little more cinnamon (since I nixed the molasses), but next time I'll just stick w/ the recommended cinnamon amt.  I also added walnuts and chocolate, and it did not alter the test of the cinnamon cookie underneath!  Loved it

These are delicious!!! I ate about 7 or 8 of them. I used 1/2 cup of butter and a 1/2 cup of shortening. I also reduced the molasses to 1 tbs and added extra cinnamon.
FANTASTIC!!!!!!!

I didn't have enough butter, so I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup margarine.  I increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  They turned out perfect!

I was looking for a cookie recipe that included molasses and for which I didn't need to buy a lot of spices, since I just started setting up my own kitchen. These were not only easy to make, but the dough was easy to handle without chilling. I was able to roll it into balls right then, but instead I was lazy and just used a teaspoon so the blobs of dough were uneven. Still, when they came out of the oven they were perfectly shaped! In my oven it was 9:30 for a perfect result - not too hard, slightly chewy, but I experimented and 8:30 or so would still be good if you want a slightly chewier cookie (I guess my oven is really hot!)
And they taste amazing!!! Will definitely make these again! They look so great, I can use them to impress my mom when she visits :P

These were excellent. I did put extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg. The dough was somewhat stiff, and I burned out my mixer, so I suggest hand mixing. Unlike the other reviews, my cookies did not spread but puffed up. I started out making them too small, but when I saw they did not spread, I was able to make them bigger. I wish I had doubled the recipe, they are good!
They are great with coffee.

Very delicious. I wanted a molasses cookie without ginger, and this was a great option. I took the liberty of sprinkling some white sugar on the tops just before baking, and they turned out wonderfully.

These are very good! I took the advice of another cook and put these in the fridge for 5-10 min., used parchment paper on the cookies sheet(do not use waxed paper-it is a different product), and I did not change any part of the recipe.
I did combine 1/3 C. of sugar and 1 tsp. of cinnamon, rolled these in the mix., and then baked like directed.  Came out delish!  I will make these again. Thanks

Yum--made dough exactly as stated, but added my own twist at the end. Roll cookie dough into balls and then roll balls into cinnamon sugar (about 1/3 c of sugar and about a tsp of ground cinnamon) This just makes the cookies look prettier and taste even better! This recipe is a keeper!

The first time I made these cookies, they actually all melted down into one giant sheet and started boiling. I'm not exaggerating. 
I had recently moved, and didn't have an oven thermometer. Turns out, when I set my oven to 350, it was actually baking at 425!
Tip: get an oven thermometer if you don't have one!

The second time I made these at the right temperature, they were absolutely the most amazing cookie ever! Crispmoisttender, just the way I like them! I added a smidgen of nutmeg and chilled the dough before rolling into balls and baking and they came out beautifully. Absolutely wonderful! Thank you!

This cookie is very easy to whip together on short notice.  It's got a nice balance between the crisp edges and chewy center.  However, I will add more spice to it next time.  It just didn't have enough "umph" for me.  I like the idea of it being a base---that you can add chips to it, or nuts... and that it will be very forgiving.
Overall, a great cookie!

These cookies are awesome. My kids like to use this as a good base and add "extras". We really like adding toffe bits the most. Dont get me wrong they are great as is but how wonderful to have a cookie that can be so versatile.

I loved these! I followed other reviewer's advice & put extra cinnamon in them. I took them to work at 7:30am, & they were gone by 10! Everyone told me they loved them, although they thought they were gingersnaps.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! These were the very very best cookies I have ever had. These were a lot like chewy ginger cookies, but the ginger was cinnamon. All my friends who tried these cookies fell in love and asked for the recipe. Thank you so much for the gift of taste Mellan!!!

This cookie is great if you switch the amount of cinnamon and molasses that is called for.

My 13 year old son likes baked goods, somewhat.  But I've never seen him eat more than a couple of any type of cookie!  But he ate pretty much the whole batch himself, with a bit of help from DH.  I got ONE.  So, a GREAT recipe!  Thanks!!!

I loved the flavor of these cookies!  My only problem was keeping them crisp.  (Probably due to the humid climate I live in)  Otherwise, an excellent recipe for when you feel the urge to bake but have no special ingredients on hand!

These are so good my husband and I can't stop eating them!  Not too sweet which is nice for a change.  I added a little allspice to the mix for kicks and pressed the cookies down on the tray with a fork to make a little design.  I can't say enough good things about them!

My family really enjoyed these cookies.  The recipe called for a little too much molasses for my taste, but that is just my opinion.  Other than that, they were great and turned out very nicely.

After tasting these, I've decided that my new favorite kind of cookie is Cinnamon Cookies.  These are very good.  Be prepared to fight off your family when you pull them out of the oven.
