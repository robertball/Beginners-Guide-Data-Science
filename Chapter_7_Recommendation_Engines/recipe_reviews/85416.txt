You didn't state if the manicotti shells are cooked before stuffing or not. Everyone should remember that new cooks are trying to find recipes they can use, so don't leave out 'important details'. Thanks for listening

Emily hit the jackpot on this one!! Turned out fabulous. I do have to admit that I cheated and used mile italian sausage instead of just the plain pork. For future reference the noodles are NOT precooked. I did add 1/4 of the jar of sauce and about 6oz. of fresh ricotta cheese to the meat mixture before stuffing the shells. The addition of the bread crumbs wasn't really necessary so I cut the amount used in half. The sauce will cook the shells completely as lond as you keep the dish covered tightly. I hope others enjoy this recipe as much as we did. Also if looking for a real kick, add some pieces of chopped pepperoni to the dish...yummm :-)

This was very tasty. I did make some changes: added an egg and about 3/4 cup ricotta to filling. I also used more sauce than called for. I assembled the dish the night before and refrigerated, was able to just pop in the oven next day. Will make again.

My recommendation to someone who wants to make manicotti is to stick to the recipe on the back of the manicotti box. It is much better. This was the 1st time in 6 yrs of marriage that my husband has told me that a dish was bad. Shells were tough & chewy. Not enough sauce. Needs an egg or 2.

I added 4C fresh mozzarella cheese, 2C ricotta cheese, and 1 egg to this mixture before baking - I had much more filling than I needed, so I froze the extra for next time.  It was the perfect solution to getting both meaty and cheesy manicotti!  I use the end of my spoon to really pack in the filling so the noodles don't collapse.  Great recipe!!

Yummy and not too difficult. You don not need to pre-cook the pasta shells on this one.

A Simple and Easy meal to make, I really like this one.  I have prepared this with a side of pasta/spaghetti and topped with some melted parmesean/mozzerella.

I should have known when there was no eggs and water in the recipe that it would not be that great. Very dry once baked in the oven hardly any sauce. Also just a jar of ragu made it taste mostly like spaghetti. I tried this any way and it was not that tasty, noodles were alright just the taste of the other ingredients. Also should have known when the recipe said to cook up the onion and to add breadcrumbs. I will not be making this agian. Just not our taste but I am sure others mite love it. If you are going to make this be very leary of the star rating and the reviews. Almost everyone changed the recipe to add ricotta and eggs or water and such. They did not rate on the acual recipe. I suggest looking elsewhere for a manicotti recipe that actually includes either ricotta or cottage cheese as manicotti is suppose to. I just hate when some one will give a 4 or 5 star rating yet changed the original recipe to where it is a completly different one. Try the original first then rate it! If you dont like it then change it.

I found them a little dry.  I even added some ricotta cheese. Also - you need to pre-cook the noodles.  Or at least boil for a few minutes to soften them up.  I put them in uncooked and they did not cook all the way.

This is one of the first pasta dishes I've ever made (I'm just a beginner!) and it turned out great! I did use some recommendations that the others stated. I used 1lb of lean ground beef instead of the 1/2 beef 1/2 pork. I threw the chopped onions and a few cloves of minced garlic in with the beef while it was cooking. I added an egg to the meat mixture as well as a quarter of the sauce,(I think that helped with cooking the pasta) as well added extra spices (mostly just some Italian spice, I like lots of Italian spice flavor in my pasta!) I also didnâ€™t put in the bread crumbs. And at the end I did add more cheese! It's such an easy recipe to work with! I did notice that there is always extra meat leftover, I'll usually just sprinkle this around the shells before I put the rest of the sauce on (makes for a real meaty pasta!)This manicotti has become a regular on pasta nights!

This was great!  I used 1 lb. ground beef instead of beef and sausage.  My family loved it.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I made changes to the original.

I changed up quite a bit but am pleased with the idea - I used ground chicken and mixed it with sour cream and garlic cream cheese. I used a garlic flavoured shredded mozarella/cheddar cheese (I believe they just add garlic butter). This was so good, I could not care about portion size AT ALL. :)

I made this and it was great. I also made this the night before and put it in the frig for the next day. My sister put it the oven for me so it was done when I got home from work and it was WONDERFULL and that is how I will cook it from now on. This is a regular dish in our home now.

This was pretty good...hearty and filling and the kiddo had seconds so that's a good sign.  I didn't pre-cook the noodles but just added 1/2 cup of water and covered tightly.  The noodles were fine.  I cut the recipe down and cooked for 35 minutes at 375.

I made it for my boyfriend and his dad, we all loved the flavor, but the noodles didn't come out good, at all. They were hard and chewy. I would love to make again, but don't know if I should try pre-cooking the noodles a bit, or adding more sauce, or even both.

I made this according to the recipe but it came out dry, it needed more sauce. The flavor was good, not great but not bad. Also check your cheese frequently, I took this out of the oven early and my cheese was already burned. : (

This was delicious!! Flavorful and easy.  I too used Provolone along with Mozzarella,Parmesan,and the ricotta. I  used Lasagna noodles instead of the traditional tubes, and then rolled them ...easier than stuffing.

My first time making stuffed Manicotti and it was great! Added ricotta to the filling and garlic(never make anything without it) I used a lot more sauce because I was afraid the manicotti wouldn't cook in the oven. It came out perfect.

I did not have very good luck with this recipe.  The noodles came out a little crunchy on the top (yes, I sealed the tin foil).  And my family didn't think there was much flavor.  It didn't suit our taste.

Turned out pretty good. Simple and basic manicotti recipe, but that's not a bad thing. Don't always have to go all out with a recipe. Easy to make and the directions are easy to follow except for leaving out details about cooking the manicotti shells. Easy, tasty, and filling home cooked meal.

The family liked this a lot. I enjoyed the flavor of mixing the meats. Very good. This is a simple, delicious recipe. To stuff the manicotti I used a toddler spoon. No problems with shells splitting that way.

This was pretty good. Husband said it was "screaming" (meaning really good!).  I added ricotta and mild green chiles to the filling, and used extra cheese and sauce. Thanks for the recipe!
