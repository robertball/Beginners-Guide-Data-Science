For folks who think or have read that okra is too slimey to enjoy- try this recipe! I found this recipe delicious, a snap to make, and it's really healthy.  I used a can of real Italian cherry tomatoes, fresh thyme, and added a bit more garlic, and it was wonderful. Okra-phobes, you won't regret trying this!

This is as authentic as it comes and I should know because my Creole mamma made this all the time.  She would also add a little fresh or frozen shrimp at the end for a slightly different taste.  Great recipe!

A very good Creole Okra recipe!  I made two changes.  I used Ro-Tel tomatoes and, because it is summer, I substituted some of my fresh lemon thyme for dried thyme flakes.

I used fresh okra and it was great. Even the folks in my household who think they're non-okra eaters gobbled it up!

I thought this was a little spicy, and I do like hot dishes. It was a nice meal for one or two, but nothing I'd serve to company. I think I'll add some chicken and shrimp and rice to the leftovers to make something similar to gumbo so the leftovers will at least get eaten.

Mmmmm!  Really good!  This was my first time making okra (and second time eating it...first experience wasn't too great) and it was really yummy!  We like lots of garlic so I doubled it and ended up adding the entire can of tomatoes.  Delicious :)

This is a good creoled okra recipe.  I was born and raised in Louisiana and this is almost how we would make it.  I make mine in a slow cooker to make it even easier- just chop and heat. (Short on time.) I add basil, thyme, and Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning (instead of salt and pepper-it gives it more of a kick.)  I just add to taste.  My great aunt used to make this a lot and she used a cast iron skillett.  If you have one do use it.  It adds to the flavor, plus it adds iron to the diet. I use one when I'm not in a hurry and it is well worth the effort.  Plus the cast iron burns off the slimeness of the okra.  My aunt never once had slimey okra!

I've been making a similar recipe since I started cooking. Its great for frozen okra and even better if you can find fresh. Also, you can add a couple of stalks of dices celery to it for additional texture. I also will add browned ground beef and serve over rice for the ultimate in comfort food that still has some spice. Enjoy.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used red pepper flakes instead. It was very good. I think next time I will add some shrimp. Thanks for sharing.

Definitely my favorite way to have okra.  Even my kids enjoyed this recipe, (I was afraid it might be too spicy).  I mixed the leftovers in a gumbo soup I made with it and served them together which worked well too.  Yum!

Very nice. You may want to add smoked fish to this recipe to give you a bit of the african type taste.  Switch thyme with basil.  Serve over steam rice.  Okra is a staple in many african countries.  The acidity in the tomatoes cuts down on the sliminess.

I love stewed okra & tomatoes, but have never prepared it. This recipe was exactly what I was expecting it to be. I did add a little spice, just because we like more spice. I can't wait to make this again! Thank you!

Very good, even as leftovers.  I had to add more liquid while simmering, but otherwise we cooked as directed!  Making it again tonight as a main meal with rice and andouille sausage.

Just made this minus the green peppers and I loved it!  Served over brow rice. It wasn't slimy for me either, maybe because I fry the okra that is I add them to the onion/ garlic and fry for a few minutes before adding the tomatoes. Will be making regularly.

This is a wonderful dish.  I fixed it for a Creole style dinner party and everyone raved over it.  I will certainly fix this regularly.  I doubled all the ingredients except the okra to serve nine adults and it was just enough.

I love it.  My variation was to use Rotel with green chilis instead and not add the cayenne.  My way was probably too hot for most but if you can stand the heat...

My boyfriend loves okra so I buy the frozen kind everytime it is on sale. I pair this recipe with the Seared Catfish from this site. It goes perfect with it. This recipe also goes well with zucchini.

This is a wonderful recipe for okra. Followed it exactly, except I used 2 fresh medium tomatoes with a 3rd one squeezed for its juice. The okra, tomatoes, pepper and parsley all came from my garden. Nice heat from the cayenne pepper and tangy from using fresh tomatoes. Will definitely make this one again.

awesome awesome awesome. I did some tweaking that I think made it a little better: used fresh okra and  fresh tomatoes from a local organic farm...yummy! Since I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, I just used tomato juice where it calls for the reserve of the canned tomatoes in the recipe. I didn't have any parsley handy, but used fresh basil instead. Superb!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it for a diet I'm on, but when I'm through will add some shrimp, chicken and/or sausage.  YUM.  Very easy and very good.

Excellent. Easy to make and something different to do with okra. My husband enjoyed it and said that the okra wasn't slimy cooked this way. Used rotel instead of canned tomatoes.

This was a family favorite when I was growing up and I still love it in my 60s! The only things I change is no bell pepper (can't eat them) and I add about 2 cups of cooked, elbow macaroni. The left overs are frozen to be added to soup or gumbo or I will add some cooked, shredded chicken or cooked and crumbled ground round for a one pot meal. It is a fast and delicious dish.

Outstanding! Added turkey sausage, a can of Rotel, 1/2 cup of chicken broth and seasoned with Tony Chachere's rather than using cayenne. Served over rice; awesome dinner...

This was really good! I LOVE okra and am always looking for good vegetarian dishes to use it in.   I didn't have any parsley on hand so I omitted that and I also used Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning. I served it over white rice as a full meal. I think next time I will double the recipe so I have more leftover!

Thanks for the recipe.  I didn't have quite the amount of okra called for, so mine ended up with a higher tomato ratio...seems like it would be good either way.

Delicious, easy, and healthy! Since finding this recipe, I try to keep the ingredients in the house for whenever we need something quick. I've made this recipe exactly as written a bunch of times and loved it. I've also added more tomatoes, tomatoes with green chilis, chopped cooked chicken, hot sausage, different spices etc. My husband, mother, and I love it.

Was an okra hater, still not a lover but this is good.  Wasted a clean bowl straining the tomatoes when I used the entire can anyway? Only four stars because I was an okra hater.

This was very good. I used okra from the garden. Instead of the cayenne pepper, I used half a jalapeno (deseeded) also from the garden. I could have used the whole thing. I was afraid a homegrown cayenne would be too spicy, but I might try that next time.

This was great! I had some leftover brown rice and spicy chicken sausage that I needed to use and this was the perfect accompaniment. The next day I added the leftover okra, rice, and sausage to a vegetable broth and it made an excellent quick and easy soup.

Very good and I will make it again. It goes superbly with rice and  my chili con carne. I added more Cayenne, much more as it happens. I omitted thyme, as I was out. I used fresh okra, not frozen.

I added 2 stalks of chopped celery to the onions and peppers. I mistakenly added one can of fire roasted medium salsa and 2 cans of stewed tomatoes. I used 1 quart of chopped fresh okra. I did not add spices as the salsa flavor was strong. It was most excellent served over hot rice.

I used canned okra and cut simmer time in half which made it easier on a busy school night. Also, thought cayenne was a bit too strong so will cut in half next time. But def a great healthy side!

This was delicious!  The last time I had okra (long ago), it was slimy, so I was looking for a recipe that made it delicious but not slimy.  This recipe did just that.  Lots of flavor, plus it was so very easy - I had all the ingredients already.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was my first time making this recipe and I will make it a regular. I used fresh okra from the farmers market and the texture was just right. I ran out of cayenne pepper so I substituted some Don't Cajun seasoning for the cayenne and the salt. I also didn't have thyme so I subbed in some poultry seasoning. I added a bit of roasted garlic tomato sauce that I had on hand for some extra moisture. My stepson, who had never had okra before exclaimed "this stuff is amazing". That's enough for me.

This was very good… not at all slimy.  I did need more liquid than the recipe called for, but that might be because I used a black iron skillet.  I didn't have any tomato juice, so I used a little chicken broth as needed … it did the trick.

We get lots of okra from our garden all summer, and usually we just stream it plain or eat it raw. To shake things up a bit I decided to try this recipe, and everyone loved it! I did make a few changes to the recipe: left out the spices except for salt and pepper, (didn't feel like hunting through our cupboards!) and used fresh okra and tomatoes instead of frozen and canned. But it still turned out really good and everyone was going back for seconds and thirds!

I've been making a similar recipe for many years.  Mine is probably a bit more fattening, as I use bacon drippings rather than oil.  And as some other reviewers mention, I use Rotel tomatoes.  I don't use thyme, and I always add a sprinkle of sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes.  This is how my Creole aunt taught me.

I thought it had a slimy texture, and would prefer okra cooked into fritters.  However, my husband loved it, and asked if I would make it again! (He tends not to pay attention to texture as much as I do.)

This was a great way to cook okra. I sometimes have issues with okra's slimy texture but not with this recipe!! Will make again!

yum! I'm not a huge okra fan, but thought this was great.  It wasn't slimy like other times I've tried making this.  I add extra tomatoes and cayenne to mine, but I like it spicy.

Very good! I didn't have green pepper on hand so I left it out. I added a 1/2 tsp or so of seasoned salt, and spiced it up with a jalapeno. It was great! Served over white rice, this can be seasoned to anyone's liking.

This was an excellent recipe. I sauteed several slices of bacon as shown on a similar recipe from this site and added some instant rice at the end of the veggie cooking time. I used fresh okra from the garden. Rave reviews from husband who hates okra! Will be using this recipe many more times.

This stuff is delicious! It's not nearly as slimy as other okra dishes, and it has lots of flavor. I used the canned diced tomatoes with jalapenos and that added a bit more spice to the recipe.

Really easy recipe and tasted AWESOME!  My DH thinks this is the best okra and tomatoes he's ever had.  The pepper adds a really nice kick.

This was very good.  I substituted the canned tomato with 1/2 cup tomato sauce and a 10oz can of tomato soup (basically what I had on hand) it was delicious. The combination made a great sauce that I'm going to try with shrimp or chicken one of these days. Thanks!
