This was quite a good base, but I modified it a bit. I used only 1 can of tomatoes, doubled the garlic and wine (so I simmered it a little while longer - uncovered - to boil off some liquid. About 20 minutes all together). I also added basil and crushed red pepper while sauteing the onion and garlic... this added to the flavor a lot. Very easy to make and really delicious. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was easy and tasty. I've made it several times now. The last few times I have added more spices (salt, pepper, italian seasonings, basil). I have also used pre-cooked shrimp that were thawed and just thrown them in for a minute or two at the end...much easier. I was also generous with the wine. At first I worried about what wine to use, but now I just dump in whatever I've got going and it turns out great every time.

I did enjoy this.  However I did add LOTS of crushed garlic.  It is a little bland but it was good.  I think what I would do next time is not add the shrimp to the sauce but pan fry the shrimp in garlic butter with some lemon first, then add it on top of the pasta and sauce.  This way the shrimp would have more flavour.  Was a good basic recipe.  I would make it again but with my changes.

Great! But I did add a 1/3 cup tomato sauce to the recipie, and I did not toss together but placed the noodles in individual small ramikins and ladled the sauce over, sprinkled the parmesean with a little added mozzarella and baked until bubbly. Fantastic, it is now in my favorite recipie book!

I sauteed some zuchinni in it before adding the wine and tomatoes. Also added some ground red pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and parsley. It was awesome!!! My husband and 11 month old loved it.

This was a really good recipe.  I made a change,however.  I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes and I used 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese that I add to the pasta instead on just sprinkling it on the top.  It was great with garlic bread!

This sauce has such nice flavor. Usually I find that the sauce is missing something or that it has too much of something in it.  I did not find that to be the case with this sauce. Yummy!

This was simple but it was a little plain to me.  I added lots of extra garlic and some basil.  I omited the wine because it already seemed a little too soupy.  After tossing it with the pasta I decided it needed more substance so I put in 1 cup of tomato sauce.  I didn't put the whole cup of cheese on it because I am trying to watch my wasteline - I let everyone sprinkle their own desired amount of cheese on.  I used a bag of frozen shrimp because I had them on hand - just thawed and pulled the tails off and threw them in the last few minutes to heat up.
My husband LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!!  So even though I thought it was just so-so I am sure I will be begged to make it again! :)

Excellent!  My changes:  I used 4 cloves of garlic and 4 T chopped fresh basil and sauteed those with the onion.  I added only 1 can of diced tomatoes (the kind with basil, garlic and oregano), and about 1/3 cup of white wine.  I added a bit of sea salt, fresh ground pepper, and 1/4 T crushed red pepper.  I let that simmer, but not for the full 10 minutes, as I felt it was reducing quickly.  Added the shrimp, and when finished I served it over whole wheat couscous with freshly grated romano.  Lots of flavor with a little kick, but still light and healthy.  Definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic with just a few changes.  Instead of penne, I used dough spread thin in a pan.  Then I topped it with the drained tomatoes and garlic, skipping the shrimp altogether.  I thought a cup of parmesan was a bit much, so I used mozzarella cheese.  Where I really saved time was instead of all the sauteing, I just baked it in a very hot oven until the dough was golden brown.  Yum!  Could have been a 5 star recipe, but I only gave it 4 because it would have been better with pepperoni.

This is a great recipe.  Yes, it might be a little bland as written, but some people like that.  If you like your meals more seasoned, it is super easy to just season to take to create the flavor you want.  I used fire roasted tomatoes, lots of garlic, and Italian seasoning paste.  I also sauteed the shrimp separately, after rubbing them with a blend of minced garlic, paprika and italian seasoning.  I served the shrimp on top of the pasta and sauce, and topped with parmesan.  One of the best and easiest meals I've made in a while.  Great base recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Needs a lot more flavor. Add in some basil parsley oregano. Be very generous with the wine. Also needs more garlic. Plate top with a spritz of lemon juice. Also I added mushrooms with the garlic and onion.

Awesome recipe.  I made a few modifications.  I seasoned the shrimp first with garlic powder, a pinch of black and red pepper, and a little sea salt.  I used a ton of minced garlic for the sauce, maybe 2 tbsp.  I drained a can of petite diced tomatoes, and added a lot of basil, some oregano, black pepper, salt, and crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce.  Finally, after adding the shrimp I threw in a few handfuls of spinach as well.  It was delicious!

Loved this recipe. All of you that say this is bland give it another try. Use Rotel can tomatoes/lime juice and cilantro flavored. Unbelivable

My hubby, son and I all loved this! Light but very tasty! I didn't have white wine so I subbed sherry, and I used more onion (yellow instead of red). Delicious! Would definitely make again! :)

SO GOOD!  Very short & simple ingredient list (they're all staples in my kitchen).  The ease & tastiness of this recipe will definitely make it one of my "regulars."  YUM:-)

We really liked this.  Simple and tasty.  I used one can diced tomatoes with balsamic vinegar and one can diced tomatoes that was italian seasoned.  This added a lot of flavor to the dish and if I had used unseasoned tomatoes, I think it would have been a little bland for our liking.  Even my 4, 2, and 1 year old gobbled it up!  Thanks!

I've been using allrecipes since 2001 so I've used a ton of recipes from this site.  I really wanted to like this one but I just didn't see why this recipe was getting 4 1/2 stars.  I didn't change a thing. (I hate finding recipes that have all of these alterations that essentially no longer makes that on hand the actual recipe.)  I just wasn't impressed.

Made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious! I did omit the wine because my kids don't care for anything w/ that flavor. I just added the juice from the canned tomatoes and added fresh basil and oregano. My kids asked for thirds!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!!

I thought the recipe was very good! I did add about 2 teaspoons of dried basil and 1 tablespoon of sugar to cut down on the acid.  I will make this again.

I drained and saved the liquid off of one can of the tomatoes and increased the wine to 1/2 cup.... I also added about 6 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, and 2 tsp red pepper flakes. After the liquid was reduced, I added heavy cream for a cream sauce... I used the reserved liquid from the tomatoes to thin it up some since it was a little too thick...

Nice!  I followed the directions exactly except for adding basil and oregano.  I also upped the garlic to a heaping tablespoon.  I used frozen shrimp, and had every intention of thawing it completely before using it, but it didn't thaw fast enough.  They were still mostly frozen when I added them to the pot.  They took a little longer to heat, but it still turned out good in the end.   For those of you counting calories at home... one portion size didn't really fill us up.  Be sure to have a salad or veggie on the side.

I thought this was a good basic recipe to follow. I did add more garlic, basil, oregano, white wine and parsley to the recipe. Had a very good flavor and I will definitely make it again.

I loved the health factor of this recipe.  Next time I will follow the advice of some of the others and saute some zucchini and add a little more spice to it.  Overall it was simple to make and tasted good.

Very simple for a kitchen novice like me trying to learn to cook.  Not too much room to screw up.   It's tasty and light.  In short, easy to make and was a big success.

Bravo! This was easy, fast, tasty and healthy. I only gave 4 stars beacause I made it using the modifications recommended by Sky,  plus a couple of my own. I doubled the garlic, onion and wine. I added 1/2 t dried basil and 1/8 t red pepper flakes (for a half recipe) to the garlic and onion before adding the wine. I used tomatoes that were already flavored with garlic and sweet onion and chopped them up more in the food processor (a few pulses). My sauce tasted a bit too acidic, so I added just a tiny pinch of sugar to balance it out. Served with a simple garlic toast & a bag salad mix--easiest dinner of the week!

Great concept, but overall, it was lacking/very bland. Will modify and make again, but will definately decrease the canned toms to ONE can, double the wine, garlic and onion for starters. On the positive, it was super easy/quick to make, just needs some tweaking, plus spices.

Hubs had been asking for a shrimp dinner so I decided to try this one.  For the two of us I used 1/4 of the penne and half of the other ingredients.  Even though I used canned tomatoes that were already seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano, I thought this recipe still needed a boost of flavor.  Next time, I’ll add more basil and oregano (fresh if I have it), more wine, and maybe some red pepper flakes or cayenne for a little kick.  We did enjoy this and it’s worth another try, but I’ll be bumping up the flavors.

This did not have enough flavor for us--too bland. I used fresh, quality ingredients & followed the recipe to the letter, even measured! Added basil, salt & pepper to the leftovers. Better.

Good base recipe, but take the advice of other cooks: add more seasoning! This recipe on its own is sooo bland. Garlic, basil, oregano, salt, pepper...whatever you like: add it. The more seasonings the better.

My sister made this on Christmas day.  I loved it.  It was tasty and not too heavy.  A nice change from ham or turkey of course, but would have been great anytime.  Using freshly grated parmesean is a must!

I just made this for my family and it is absolutely delicious! I followed fellow reviewers' suggestions and upped the garlic to 2 tablespoons. I also added dried basil and crushed red pepper when the garlic/onions were cooking. Finally, instead of crushed tomatoes, I used a 28 oz can of whole San Marzano tomatoes--they make this dish amazing! Sauce was not too thin, sauce was not bland; sauce and dishe were super!

Great, simple recipe. I didn't have any 'canned tomatoes' on hand and it proved a positive! I used about 1.5cups Fresh Grape Tomatoes, haved and added about .75cup Tomato Juice. Served over Gluten Free Pasta with a side salad. Perfect workday dinner!

AWESOME!  Took others advice and used 1 can of diced tomatoes, and doubled the wine and garlic and added crushed red pepper.  And I let it simmer longer, about 45 minutes unvoered to reduce.  Will definitely make again!

Good - I did not have parmesan cheese so we used about a 1/2 cup of feta for a little Greek flair - also tossed in a little Italian seasoning. yummy and pretty low fat, considering...

Quick and easy! I only had 1 can of tomatoes, so I added 2 fresh romas. I used pre-cooked frozen shrimp and that added a bit more liquid so total simmering time was about 20 minutes. The white wine I used was a moscato, which is a sweet dessert wine, but it worked! Added a little salt and basil to taste. Hubby thought it was shrimp creole so you could probably even serve it over rice. I would definitely make this again.

This dish was very tasty. I took others recommendations and added more seasonings and salt.  I sautéed 2 onions with 3 garlic cloves.  I used fire roasted tomatoes with garlic.   I added dried oregano and parsley. Added chipotle chili seasoning for a little heat.  I did not have wine, substituted cooking sherry. Added a little half n half toward the end.

Fantastic, and super-quick.  I used a can of tomatoes that was flavored with garlic and basil, and whole wheat penne.  My husband is a really picky eater, but for this, he dove in for seconds.  We both agree that the sauce could use a little something --perhaps a really general Italian seasoning--but I will absolutely make this again.

Was a quick easy recipe...but I felt it needed alittle more ZIP for our taste, I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and substituted the white wine for apple juice , then to make this dish alittle lightier and more diet friendly I served the shrimp, sauce,& etc. over a bed of ANGEL HAIR PASTA!   Hubby loved it!

This was excellent!  Used the list of ingredients as stated, with the minor change of using fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I increased the garlic, and used less red pepper, based on our tastes.  This is a keeper and will definitely be made again!  Thanks!

This was a very light and easy dish. I took into account the reviews stating it was bland and used a flavoured canned tomato mixture, as well as adding extra garlic.

Wow!  This was declicious...although I did make some changes.  I hate to review a recipe based on changes I made, but too many people said it was bland for me not to take note.  My changes were:  Use whole wheat penne; increase garlic to 2 tbls.; add 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper, 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 tsp. dried basil.  I used Contessa frozen shrimp.

This was a huge hit!  I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little.  Next time I'll throw in some fresh roma tomatoes to see if that'll make it even better.

I combined suggestions from several reviews and added zuchini and fresh spinach, used one can of petite diced tomatoes with green chiles, and added italian seasoning and basil.  Also, I added some balsamic vinegar and a tsp. of sugar.  I know I changed quite a bit, but wow, sooooo good!

Very delicious start.  I used Rotel hot canned tomatoes plus fresh basil and parsley.  I also added oregano and red pepper plus some chopped spinach because I didn't feel like making a salad on the side.  It turned out terrific.  Perfect Monday night meal in June!  Flavorful but light.  Hubby cleaned his double serving bowl and went back for more.

Great base dish! Loved the simplicity. I made a few changes: used 1 can of diced tomatoes; used chicken stock and tp of sugar instead of wine; added basil and red chili flakes; used pre-cooked shrimp. 
Took no time at all and was restaurant quality! Would love to think of a low carb version (no starches).

The 4 stars is for when I made it as the recipe stated. I think it was a little bland. It's just me and the hubby so I made enough pasta for 2, kept the shrimp, onion and garlic as stated (we love both). I used only 1 can of the diced tomatoes, did 1/2 cup of Sauvignon Blanc and added a little bit of salt, some cracked pepper, and basil. I just eye balled it so I have no measurements to give. We loved it with the changes.

I usually don't review recipes but this one was good I had to.  I have tried several pasta and shrimp recipes and this one is 2 die for.  However I did make some changes just because I didn't have all on hand.  I used chicken stock instead of white wine, angel hair pasta instead of penne and I added basil to it.  It was by far the best thing I have tasted in a very long time.

this was pretty good - I followed the recipe pretty closely, with a few exceptions; I didn't have penne, so used rotini.  I also used diced tomatoes with green chilis as some others had recommended.  It was good -but pretty spicy, so if you don't like spice, I would recommend one with green chili/one without... or both with no green chilis.  I added a dash of italian seasoning, as well.   Instead of mixing the parmesean in, we sprinkled it on top so we could decide how much we wanted; 1 c. seemed a lot for us.

Excellent recipe.  Some reviewers thought that it was a little bland so instead of canned diced tomatoes, I added canned diced tomatoes with green chillies.  If you like spicey food, you will love it with the this change.  Another possibility....add one can of diced tomatoes with green chillies and one plain diced tomatoes for a not so spicy, but still flavorful meal.  Thanks for sharing!!

Great! But I agree the dish didn't have enough of a "hit."  I just sauteed the shrimp in butter and creole seasoning and laid on top of the penne with the sauce.  Wonderful and thanks for the recipe.

It was a very simple and fast meal. The fact that it was healthy was great too. I personally like thicker sauce so I let is simmer for a while to thicken it up. And for a little more spicier flavor I added a bit of white pepper.

I made this for dinner last night and it was loved by all.  I only gave it four stars because I added some red pepper, basil, zucchini and extra wine to make it perfect.  I will definitely be making this again, it tasted like it was from a fancy restaurant.

Very good, will definitely be serving this again..I combined some other suggestions when preparing. I sauteed the shrimp in butter prior to adding to the sauce.  I added a pinch of crushed red pepper and fresh basil.However, I did have to add some dried basil later,as it still needed a little more(dried did the trick, but we do love basil in our house, so you'd have to adjust it to your own preference). I also used petite diced tomatoes.

Very good recipe, really simple and easy to fix. As in other reviews, I had to spice it up a bit with extra seasonings (oregano, parsley, garlic, onion powder)and also sauteed the shrimp with a little lemon juice and butter then added it to the sauce just before serving. My 8 year old son who is a picky eater loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I sliced up sweet sausage and cooked this with the onion. Plus, I added more garlic and Italian spice to taste. I liked the consistency of the sauce as it stayed moist.

I often riff off Italian recipes, and this was no exception, but it was not much of a diffrence!  Judging from the comments, I adjusted the seasoning a bit, and as in my custom, I let the sauce simmer 90 minutes to 2 hours ON VERY LOW, with the lid half-on the pot. I did NOT shell the shrimp-I bought uncooked shrimp which were already de-veined, pulled the "feathers" off, and leaving the shells ON,continued the recipe as stated. The shells add a LOT of flavor to the end product. IT IS VERY flavorful, a little more prep and cooking time, but this is added to my recipe box and we plan on making it frequently!

I added some Italian spices and some red pepper flakes because my family likes spicy food.  It was light tasting since there wasn't any heavy sauce.  I may add a little olive oil to help the sauce stick to the pasta next time.

This recipe is delicious with the extra Alfredo sauce - thank you for the suggestion!  I sauteed mushrooms, garlic and onion in the oil and then added the wine (to taste) and 14.5 oz of well drained diced tomatoes with chile and then the shrimp.  It was a little spicy for my taste but after i mixed in some Alfredo sauce it was perfect!  Of course some people added crushed red pepper at the table but most of us found it had just the right amount of spicyness.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I love shrimp with pasta so I was really excited to try it.  I didn't use the red onion though - I don't like onions.  I added lemon, as someone mentioned in the reviews.  Very good.

Pretty good.  Added more wine just to get to consistency I wanted. Added oregano, red pepper flakes, a little ground thyme, and some garlic salt.  Overall, pretty good.  My husband (who is picky) said it was better than he thought it would be so...

This was ok, but it was pretty bland. I ended up adding 1/2 teaspoon each of dried basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.

Tasted very good! 
Heated up well for the next 2-3 days for leftovers.
I used linguine pasta instead of penne. I would highly recommend doing so! 
Will definately be making this dish again.

This recipe is excellent!  It is a light dish with a lot of flavor!  I took the previous suggestion to partially cook the shrimp first in the olive oil, garlic and small pinch of salt first for added flavor.  I removed the shrimp and added it back in at the end to finish cooking and absorb the flavor of the dish.  My kids are not big tomato fans, so I  only used one 1 can of flavored tomaotes (diced tomatoes with onions, garlic and oregano) and I chopped up some fresh basil and threw that in as well.  Definitely a keeper in my household.

This recipe tasted better than Olive Garden when I created it. Instead of can tomatoes, I used fresh tomatoes and instead of Parmesan cheese I used Romano cheese. Delicious!!

YUM!! I did tweak it a little for my families liking. We are from South Louisiana so I had to add some more flavoring. I used more onion and garlic, seasoned the sauce w/ salt and pepper. I also added a tsp of sugar! I sauteed the shrimp in butter, salt, pepper, garlic powder and squeezed some lemon. I cooked them till they were just done and added them to the sauce (make sure to drain the juice). It's such a great flavor. Added a side of corn and some garlic bread.

With a couple alterations, i thought this dish was absolutely delicious.  I used only one can of tomatoes with jalepenos in them and half a pound of small penne and added more garlic and italian seasoning, basil and hot pepper seeds and about a tablespoon of sugar.  I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time and am so happy to have found this one.  Next time I am going to use all the same things but add spicy italian sausage  and some green peppers instead of the shrimp just for something different.  We will definitely have this many more times.  The family loved it too!

I can only give this a 3 star (2 star seemed too harsh).  This wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular.  I found it to be too plain.  Basically all this is, is cans of tomatoes with shrimp over pasta.  I doubt I will be making this again.

This was very good, I used Chicken broth instead of wine, added some crushed red pepper and some tomato sauce to thicken it, otherwise it would have been to watery. Also, it needs more garlic that the recipe states. I like these base recipes, they allow you to adjust to taste.

While this is a pretty good recipe base it is definitely lacking some ingredients. I decided to do it like the original recipe stated and it needed a bit more flavor. It was not bad by any means, however it did need some more seasoning for a kick and more flavor. Overall it was a good recipe.

This recipe is a good base recipe.  I added basil, oregano, and italian seasoning.  I also added some sliced red, yellow and green peppers.  I cook the sauce separately, and then add a bit of corn starch mixed in water to thicken.  I've also used pre cooked shrimp.  It has many possibilities. . . I usually just use what I have on hand, and it is good every time.  It has become a repeat recipe in my house.

This recipe, as noted below, was a bit bland, but.... I cooked the shrimp in Move Over Butter, and garlic. When the shrimp was done, I added all the liquid from the shrimp. I also bought the specialty shredded parmesean from the specialty cheese section... and ... OH MY.... delectable. I would make this again in a heart beat.

The sauce is light like a marinara but a little bland. I added a whole roasted red Bell pepper.  Also, I decreased the amount of pasta to 12 ounces & it was a bit too much still, probably 10 would have been plenty.

Excellent recipe and very easy to prepare. I'll do this one again. Also, works well without the wine as the wine opener was broke, and I now have a new one.

Great recipe that can be modified to what is in your kitchen! I used a little less pasta because I like my pasta more saucy. I also added another cup of wine and simmered for a little longer than stated. I also had some pitted green olives in the fridge that I sliced and added as well. It turned out wonderful and my boyfriend said it was better than the pasta he ordered in a restaurant!

We enjoyed this.  I also added Italian Seasonings, basil, oregano.  It was  easy and quite tasty.  Will make often with other variations.  I think would be good with scallops.

Great low cal recipe!  I added extra garlic, fresh basil and red pepper flakes as others suggested.  I also added a little extra wine.  My sauce cooked at a higher temperature than it should have, so it coooked down quite a bit, but was still wonderful.  It was a very light pasta dish and I will be making it often!

This recipe  made a wonderful summertime meal.  I added fresh basil and zucchini  and increased the garlic - ideas I got from other reviewers - otherwise followed the recipe exactly,  The flavors were subtle but delicious - just right!  It was also very quick and easy to prepare.  I really enjoyed this meal and my husband and daughter both rated it a 5+.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was good, but not really great.  The sauce ended up being a little bland, so I would suggest adding some fresh basil and a little more garlic.  A good starting point for a great recipe.

We thought this was a great recipe! Very easy to make. I used 2 cans of rotel in it which made it a little spicier that I thought so next time I wll cut it back to one can and a can of regular stewed tomatoes.

This recipe rocks! I added some crushed red pepper and dried basil to Dr. it up a little bit and it was great.  Probably the easiest thing I have ever made.  I used both cans of tomatoes and thought it was perfect.  I wouldn't use any less.  Also, i agree, no need for 1 cup of parmesan cheese, but topping your dish with it at the end is a must!

This recipe was really great - easy for someone who really doesn't cook too much and very tasty! I made it for my husband as an anniversary dinner and we had a nice bottle of red wine with it. I added some broccoli (which wasn't in the recipe) while the sauce was simmering for 10 min and it tasted great.

This was a big hit! I added turmeric, oregano, basil and cayenne pepper. (I guess I was a bit worried about the several commenters who said it was bland.) We loved it. The turmeric adds a nice orange color. We noticed that the dish was even better the second day after the ingredients had a chance to blend. Yes, I will make this again.

We loved this.  We took the suggestions and added more garlic ( 6 or more cloves), 1can of Rotel and simmered the tomato mixture for a couple of hours, adding more wine as needed.  We sauted the shrimp in 1 1/2 tsps. of butter with more garlic until the shrimp was cooked, but not tough.  Poured the shrimp on top of the pasta/tomato mixture.

I thought this was delicious.  I made minor changes.....doubled the wine, added a few shakes of crushed red pepper, fresh basil and used diced tomatoes already seasoned with garlic and basil.  Will definitely make this again.

This dish was quick and easy but I also modified it based on some of the other reviews. I think it would be bland without additional seasonings. I added crushed red pepper, 1 tablespoon of sugar, italian seasoning, no salt seasoning and broccoli. I only had crushed tomatoes and Moscato wine on hand but think it still tasted great. When I make this again I'll add mushrooms and sausage because we really like them. All in all it was tasty and well received in my house. I will definitely make  this again.

Neither my hubs or I were all that impressed with this. No doubt, the quality of tomatoes you use makes a HUGE difference. I purchased a can of Italian-seasoned tomatoes from Wal-Mart (value brand) and really regret doing so. They were SOOO sweet! I've purchased other store brand tomatoes that were less sweet, but having never tried the Wal-Mart brand, I had no idea what to expect. If I were to ever make this again, I would definitely use a name brand to ensure a better outcome. All in all, this was "OK" but nothing to write home about. Maybe this will float your boat, but it didn't do much for me. Thanks anyways, GILSDORF.

This is a nice recipe with clean, healthy flavors.  The only changes I made were to add chopped sun dried tomatoes, and sprinkle a chiffonade of fresh basil.

I used this as a base for my recipe so my review is not a "true review" but I love what I made.  I used chicken instead of shrimp.  As other reviewers did, I added seasonings to this.  I used Italian seasoning, garlic poweder (in addition to the fresh), basil and chili flakes.  I also added peas and mushrooms to it.  It was DELICIOUS!!!

I made a similar recipe I found on this site, which called for fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  Try them.  They may be hard to find, but without them, this dish is a bit bland.

so simple and so good!  i used pre-cooked frozen shrimp instead of fresh and added them to the sauce about 2 minutes before it was done just to heat them thru.  trying it as a freezer meal, too - when i made the first batch i also mixed the prepped ingredients in freezer bags for 2 other batches. similar enough to other freezer meals i've made that it should work well.

Cooking is not my thing, but with so much shrimp leftover, I had to, since hubby won't.  But I also made some for him with chicken.  It was so DELICIOUS that he keeps asking when I plan to make this again.  Thanks for a simple but a great recipe.

Even with seasoning, this meal was only okay. Might be better with the alfredo as suggested, and I think I'll use chicken if I make it again.

Good, simple taste.  The sauce came out very watery.  I might drain the tomatoes next time.  We also used frozen pre-cooked shrimp, which may have contributed to the liquid.  We didn't use a whole cup of parmesan cheese, but it was a nice addition.

This was a bit bland, and I increased the garlic and onion some, added some spices, and increased the wine as well. I also put in some zucchini (chopped into pieces) and decreased the amount of tomato a bit. It just doesn't really have enough flavor for me to love it. I don't think I'd make this again.

This is excellent...very light and flavorful.  I followed the advice of others and used only one can of diced tomatoes and doubled the wine and garlic.  I also added sliced mushrooms, basil, and crushed red pepper.  Outstanding!

This recipe was super easy to prepare. I used small shells instead of penne, and cooked them just short of being al-dente. I also used frozen shrimp, which ended up making my tomato, onion, garlic, wine sauce watery. However, that was resolved by putting the pasta in the pan with the sauce mix for a few minutes and tossing/simmering the whole lot.

I will use this recipe again, but will probably add some broccoli florets for color, and maybe some basil for additional flavor.

Good, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs more seasoning. I added red pepper flakes, salt, Italian seasoning, as well as extra garlic and wine. It still seemed a little bland. Next time I will use less penne, keeping the same amount of shrimp and sauce.

Some of my favourite ingredients were listed in this recipe...all of which I had on hand...so I was really excited to try it for supper tonight! It turned out to be very bland and disappointing.  Not sure if I will make it again but if I do, I would have to zip it up with some herbs and spices.  I’m not so good without suggestions and measurements so I think that truthfully I will look for a similar recipe with extra flavour enhancers listed.

This recipe needs a few more ingredients. It's a little bland. The basic recipe is fine but it needs some thing like some green onions, parsley, other herbs. I would certainly make it again but add something to it.

Really a good recipe. Perfect for summer as it isnt a heavy meal. I took a few suggestions from the reviews and added  crushed red pepper , basil, and oregano to the garlic and onions and that really set it off. I also added fresh diced tomatoes , simply because I had them cut  up and needed to use them , and that gave it an even fresher summer taste.  Delicious.  Good with chicken  pieces as well. Just cook them in the oven with olive oil, salt and pepper, dice the chicken pieces and add.  Thanks so much!  I've used this recipe several times.

This recipe is quick and delicious!  It will be an easy goto for busy nights.  The shrimp can easily be substituted with chicken or pork.  This is going to become a family favorite.  Since there are only two of us these days, I cut it in half.  Another time, I will probably make the 4 serving version and freeze half.

I always switch things up in recipes so I only added one can of tomatoes, more garlic, a little Parmesan and some fresh basil.
Thanks for the recipe.  We really enjoyed it!  And I got to drink the remainder of the wine for dinner!

Good base, but I agree with those who added more garlic and wine, and fewer tomatoes. Some black pepper helped, too.

I used whole grain pasta and fresh, greated parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper. I added the aldente pasta to the finished sauce and allowed it to soak up the extra liquid. It was perfecto!  I will make this again and again....

This was actually a really good dish.  I was concerned when I saw a few reviews calling it "bland".  So I used extra garlic / onions and I also used fire roasted tomatoes.  Lots of flavor!

Excellent especially with a few variations for our particular taste.  After reading the comments I decided to use just one can of chopped tomatoes, 1/4 cup tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of wine.  I like the Italian taste so I increased the minced garlic to three heaping tablespoons and added basil to onion and garlic mixture as it was cooking and Italian seasoning in the tomato mixture as it was cooking in a small pot..  Before serving I added a small amount of butter and garlic salt to the penne so it wouldn't stick together and negated the need to have sauce on every noodle.  I thought about adding the crushed red pepper but my husband like simple and not spicy.  He loved this dish and told me would definitely eat it again.

Surprised at this recipe, it looks very simple the ingredients but turned out quite well.. looked at the comments online and found out that it is a good idea to add butter and the garlic to the shrimp in a separate pan and then add it to the tomato sauce fantastic recipe was looking for second helpings.

Great and easy. I did however adhere to the other reviews and added some additional spices. You have to make that sauce hurt in order to make it less blend.

As someone recommended, I cooked the shrimp separate with sea salt, pepper, and butter. Also added more garlic to the sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I love recipes that are tasty and easy to make.

Good starting point but as others have said more wine, crushed red and black pepper, fresh basil and ripe vine tomatoes instead of tasteless canned ones really boosts the flavour.

I will make this again!  I was out of canned tomato, I used a fresh one, it was good, next time I will get the canned tomatoe. Also I used organic vegetable broth for the white wine. I really like red onion with pasta , it has great flavor! Shrimp is so cute and fluffy I plan on making it more often and trying the other Penne pasta recipes.

Absolutely delicious...Just made a few changes. Left the wine out, added 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup of chopped fresh basil and precooked shrimp. More like a Fra Diavolo.  This basic sauce, however is easy and quick! Will make again.

I made it as the recipe called for but when I make it again, I will use the diced tomatoes that have the garlic already in them (very time saving) and will use more of it.  I didn't think there was enough sauce or shrimp for the amount of pasta. Really like the flavor combination though.  Maybe fresh parmesan would be nice ,too.

This was a very easy, quick and healthy recipe.  I made it as is and liked it.  After tasting it, I shook a bit of seafood seasoning on it and, because I'm lactose intolerant, I added a very small amount of lactose free sour cream which I think made it a bit creamy and I liked that change.

This is a great base for a start.  I dbld the garlic, added chopped baby bell peppers, a bag of baby spinach and added 1 cup of white wine. I seasoned it with Italian seasoning, basil and crushed red pepper flakes, salt and pepper to taste, and let this simmer  while I cooked the pasta and shrimp. I tossed the shrimp with olive oil, salt and pepper, Italian seasoning and 1 clove minced garlic and sauted before adding to the pasta and sauce. I tossed 1 cup of parmesan cheese in the dish and served some on the side. Hubby loved this. I will definitely be making this again.

Made significant changes based on reviews by others.  Reduced the pasta to 8 oz. to serve just the two of us. Used only one can of diced tomatoes and doubled the garlic, wine and red onion. Also added chopped fresh parsley when tossing the pasta in the sauce.  This is destined to become one of those non-recipe recipes that will evolve over time. 

Thanks so much for the inspiration!

The wine made the sauce a bit tart but I think it was the wine I used, LOL! ;) Very easy and good recipe- my son and husband really enjoyed this. I also added a dash of sugar (Sorry- had to) and oregano and simmered for a while before serving to calm the tartness. I topped with fresh Italian Parsley, fresh grated Parmesan Cheese and served with nice garlic bread and a fresh salad. YUM! Great weeknight meal.

I use a better grade of grated cheese by Locetelli , which is found in the child section of the deli department. This way I can get a blend of both pecorino and parmesan.
Also added more garlic as it is needed for a better flavor. Light does not have to mean no flavor.

This lacked flavor as others have said.  Should you want it more robust, add some red pepper and a lot more garlic.

Made this tonight for dinner for me and my husband.  It was really good and I made it pretty much by the recipe as written.  I just splashed the wine...didn't measure...used a little less shrimp and only one can of petite diced tomatoes.  Chopped a little fresh parsley and added it.   I thought it was pretty excellent but it did need a little more of something.....a little bland.   Will make again...quick and easy and would be restaurant quality with a little more salt, pepper and maybe a tich of cayenne.   Will do it again soon

This recipe is OK. I agree with man who say this is a good starter. Also, like others suggest, the recipe needs some herbs. I added a tiny bit of tomato paste as I noticed that it was too watery. Maybe try Italian style diced tomatoes for added flavor and more garlic. The recipe is not WOW! but is not bad either.

This would have been boring if I just followed the recipe here, but it was a good base. I added more garlic, a lot of Italian seasoning, some basil, and a lot of Parmesan cheese ?? I think it would have been really good with some Cajun seasoning too!

I changed the recipe up by first sautéing the red onion, garlic in butter instead of olive oil (didn't have any on hand) with a teaspoon on red pepper flakes. Then added 1 cup of wine into a wine reduction, then added diced tomatoes with oregano. The meal turned out to be delicious!

Followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers- added basil and increased the garlic. Had only pre-cooked shrimp on hand but will follow the suggestion to get uncooked and saute in garlic butter. Very mild flavor but I really liked it. I used a Chardonnay that I had which worked well

Excellent, quick & easy.  Used precooked, frozen shrimp and added Italian seasoning to taste and tomato paste to thicken the sauce a little.

I accidentally put in diced tomatoes with chili's and garlic. It came out nice and spicy. The directions didn't say to drain the tomatoes but with that and the wine , I reduced it longer. Plenty of shrimp. Will make again.

Pretty darn good.  I added a squirt of tomato paste and more garlic but changed little else.   We added fresh whilted spinach for extra color and a bit of sugar to reduce the acidity of the tomatoes.  Easy,  adaptable and flavor easily improved using fresh herbs/spices and good quality ingredients overall.

This is a simple, quick and delicious meal, a great weeknight dinner. I made 1/2 recipe, albeit with the full amounts of onion and garlic (since I love both), and added Italian herbs, as other reviewers suggested. As the sauce was cooking it looked somewhat dry, so I added a bit of pasta water & another splash of wine. The result was much tastier than I had expected--nice tomato flavor  with plump, juicy shrimp. Yum!

We  loved it. I  did modify it some by using grape tomatoes instead of  canned and I added Italian seasoning for more favor..  It is a definite keeper.  So easy to make.

This was very tasty, with only a couple of modifications. I used a quart of roma tomatoes canned from the garden. The onion and garlic were sauteed in herbed olive oil to add more flavor. A little salt and pepper and the rest is history. My husband loved it and looks forward to me making it again. .

This recipe was very good as a start---but I thought that it was too bland for our tastes. Add some extra garlic, a pepper blend of spices and some crushed red pepper flakes. Served with a bit of extra parmesan on top, it was delicious.

I found it to be 2 dry, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, but it was still pretty bland, and I think a 1/2pound of penne would probably be somewhat better, it was too much pasta.

Made it as the recipe directed. It was good, however I and my wife agree it could use more garlic and some additional spices like crushed red pepper, basil, oregano , etc to kick it up to 5 stars.

Like many other reviewers this was pretty bland.  My typical procedure with a new recipe is follow directions the first time ; however, after tasting, I knew it needed more flavor.  I added a lot of garlic, basil, Italian seasoning and even after all of that, I am on the fence about making it again.  The upside is that the recipe is simple and fast and sauted chicken could replace shrimp.

The recipe was great! I didn't change anything. The only change I wish I knew how to make would be to make the tomatoes a little less "biting." Somewhere, I've read that a teaspoon of sugar might counter the acidity of the tomatoes--maybe that's the solution.

I made it exactly according to the recipe. I loved the simplicity and all ingredients, but found it somewhat bland. I'm not the kind of cook who knows intuitively how to improve recipes, so I appreciate the other reviews that provided suggestions. I will make it again incorporating some of the suggestions I read.

It was light, simple, and boring.  There is a bit of the garlic flavor that comes through, but the sauce is thin and watery.

I used 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp and it needed some spices - salt, pepper and basil. With a salad and bread would serve 5 or 6 comfortably.

Awesome and easy!  I added cod loin, mushrooms, and spinach. And bumped the wine to a cup. Turned out great!

I enjoyed it, but made a small change. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used 3 diced  and peeled fresh tomatoes. I love the fresh taste.

It was incredibly easy to make, which is always a plus and the flavor was light but definitely there. It wasn't bland or boring. I really liked this dish. Had it for lunch at two days in a row.

Just made this tonight and my husband and I both loved it.  We are watching our carbs so I cut down the pasta by half and then cut down the tomatoes so the pasta/sauce ratio would be correct.  I added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  Very tasty and very easy!

I made a double batch and used Bay shrimp, 16 ounce of penne and one package of tortellini, oh and no wine! It was fantastic!

This is one of my favorite shrimp recipes, thank you! To those who are worried about the blandness- I have never had that problem and I have also used "Italian Style" diced tomatoes. That must be making the difference because I hardly ever need to add extra seasonings, besides garlic salt, which I add to everything. (I also followed another's advice to double the wine and garlic). SO AWESOMEEEE! I serve it over rice if we've already had pasta that week...

This is a really great homemade recipe that has lot of flavor but isn't hard to make. I only added a few dry seasonings:
Salt, pepper, dried red pepper flakes (1/2 tsp.) and dried basil. I don't make many recipes twice - but this is a great quick meal that definitely impresses.

This is a great base to start with.  It does need seasoning and about double the wine it calls for.  Still rather good on its own.  I make it occasionally.

Great recipe! Every time I dine out, I'm always looking for a good shrimp pasta dish. I was happy to find this recipe! I sauteed mushrooms and green onions along with the onion and garlic. I used a little extra white wine and added in some garlic powder, black pepper and a little crushed red pepper.  Once I tossed it with the pasta, I felt that it was still a little bland and missing something.  Guess what? I three in 3/4 jar of alfredo sauce during the last five minutes.  THe end result = PERFECT SHRIMP PASTA DISH!! Thank you so much for sharing this one!

This was great! Thank you for the recipe! I added yellow squash, fresh basil, and used fresh plum tomatoes (instead of canned tomatoes) because I had these ingredients on hand. I also added crushed red pepper, black pepper, and garlic powder, as other reviewers mentioned. We loved it!

My whole family loved this meal.  I only used 1 can of tomatoes as I'm not keen on tomatoes and added some diced green onions.
