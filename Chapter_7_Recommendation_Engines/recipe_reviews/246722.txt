I made these into cupcakes, frosted them with Dream Whip frosting and took them to a meeting. They were a hit. I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract because it helps eliminate the box taste of a cake mix.

This was very good and easy.  Hubby loved it. I added some golden raisins and used a cream cheese frosting instead of store bought.  Came out great.

This is really light. The only problem I had was the flour was stuck to the cake sides & bottom. I managed to get most off though. Otherwise, the applesauce adds a nice flavor without overpowering. My husband, whose mother used to make spice cake from scratch, even liked it! (Her's was much denser) I will definitely make again

Very moist! The cinnamon was just a hint in the frosting but made the difference.

Hubby loves spice cake. I used cream cheese icing and added salted caramel bits to it.  Very tasty cake.

Everyone I served it to loved it.  Tastes just like homemade.  Will definitely make again.  It was fast and easy.  I didn't have canned frosting on hand so I made cream cheese frosting instead. That made it taste even more homemade!
