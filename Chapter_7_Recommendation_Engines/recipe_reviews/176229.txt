This is the method I use and it always works perfectly.  Another hint...If you are making deviled eggs, or a dish where it is important the yolk be centered...try this trick...while the eggs are still in the carton, place a rubberband or two around the carton and place in refrigerator on its side.  Leave on side overnight prior to cooking and you will have perfectly centered yolks every time!

Makes perfect hard boiled eggs. If you plan on using the eggs immediately after cooling you can tap them with a spoon to slightly crack the shells before placing them in the cold water. The shells will peel off like butter in about an hour letting you skip the refrigerator step. This recipe produces gorgeous firm eggs with brilliant yellow yolks and deviled eggs have never looked better!
Thanks for sharing!

For the longest time I did not know how to boil eggs the correct way. As silly as this recipie may seem I think it is a must to have on this site for the new cooks.

I have been using this method for years and it works every time. I have one extra step, though, which eliminates the 2-hour refrigeration. When the eggs have steeped in the water for 15 minutes, I drain them and put the lid back on the pan and shake it vigorously until each of the eggs is cracked. Then I put ice cubes in the pan to cover the eggs and fill it with cold water. I let it sit for 15-20 minutes and the eggs are cold. Because the cold water is underneath the cracked shells, they almost fall off the egg when you begin to peel them.

I've been boiling eggs this way all of my life.  It always works for me. Just to reiterate what a couple of other people said, if you use older eggs, they will peel easier.  Fresher eggs are always harder to peel.  So, don't blame the recipe if your eggs don't peel well.  Next time just use them closer to the expiration date and they'll peel easier.  One tip that I've heard that might help, though, is adding a teaspoon of salt to the cooking water right after taking them off the heat.  The salt doesn't actually make the egg inside salty, it just loosens the shell to make peeling easier.  Give it a try and see if it works for you!

I could never figure out how to hardboil eggs without the green tinge until I met my father in law. This recipe is EXACTLY
the same way he used to cook his. If you have family members who are hardcore about hardboiled eggs(or like deviled eggs as much as my husband), give this a go. You'll be pleasantly surprized.

I did this over the 4th of July for deviled eggs and they came out perfect!  A couple other tips: never boil more than 12 eggs at a time and let them get to room temperature before boiling - that reduces the chance of them opening while in the water.

Even though I'm embarrassed, I'm going to review my epic fail with my eggs.  My way of making hard boiled eggs is similar but I've always needed a 'tester egg' so I thought I would try this recipe (using 3 eggs because that is all I needed) and I followed it to a T.  Came time to peel and cut my eggs.  Pull an egg out of the water, spin it on the counter (see a hard boiled egg will spin beautifully while a raw egg just wobbles around..hmmm, my egg isn't spinning like it should...hundreds of people can't be wrong so I'll go with it) peel, and cut.  Imagine my surprise when it was only soft boiled. Let's just pop these other two in a bowl of water and finish them off in the microwave...yes, I've been alive 42 years and NO ONE has ever told me that I couldn't/shouldn't do that...Kaboom and my microwave door blows open and I have hard boiled eggs EVERYWHERE!  Here is what worked for me: 1) Bring eggs to boil and turn heat to the lowest setting 2) Set timer for 18 minutes 3) When timer goes off, take an egg out of water and see if it spins on the counter top.  If it spins it's done, if it wobbles a bit put back in water for a few more minutes and re-spin to check 4) Run cool water over eggs, while in pan.  5) You don't have to cool for hours.  I peeled mine after 2 minutes.  Just make sure you peel under a trickle of cold running water.

Followed the directions exactly and the eggs turned out PERFECT.  As someone else suggested I cracked the shells with a spoon and soaked the eggs in a bowl of cold water to cool them rather than waiting for the refrigerator.  They cooled as I prepared other parts of the meal and were ready to peel in about an hour. Made great deviled eggs and added to potato salad. This is a VERY SIMPLE yet VALUABLE recipe.

Don't try the cracking with the spoon thing like someone suggested- those were the hardest eggs to peel EVER!  Just let them chill according to the recipe.

These turned out perfectly as you can see in the photo. Look how pretty! I have always had trouble knowing for sure when they are done and either the yellow would turn gray or it would have an uncooked bit of yolk. I even used extra large eggs, and they still turned out perfectly! Thanks!!!

This recipe works better if you put 1/2 t. salt in the water as you fill the pot.  That delays boiling until the temp is just a bit higher, and will take care of the issue experienced by many reviewers of eggs not quite done.  Some of the inconsistency in the results probably came about because the recipe does not say what size pot to use.  A larger pot (more water),  would hold the heat longer than a smaller one just big enough to hold the eggs.  These two omissions (salt & amount of water) is why this is not a 5-star recipe, even though it may work perfectly for some of the users.   Of course if you live at high altitude, you may want to simmer the eggs on low 1 or 2 minutes after they first boil and before you take them off the heat.  Once you find eggzactly the right timing for where you live, you will have a foolproof formula.

One more thing about taking the shell of the eggs - this may sound crazy but it is so easy and saves alot of time.  Crack the bottom of each end of the egg. Peel it off about the size of a small coin. Then, put your lips on the bottom of the egg and blow.  The egg will instantly come out of it's shell.  Make sure you hold the other end of the egg, or it will fly across the room!  Try it...

I add a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil to the water before boiling the eggs. The shells actually absorb some of the oil making it a sinch to peel! You will never have problems peeling eggs again!!

Yep, the best way to make a hard boiled egg.  My sister taught me this years ago and I've been doing it this way since.  I just had to add my 5 stars for this!

I can't wait to try the "put a rubber band around the carton and put it on it's side the night before to center the yolk" tip.   I cook mine in my large tea kettle.  Seems I always step away just when they start to boil and spit water on my cooktop.  This way I don't have to watch.  The whistle alerts me.  Also, I've always waited 10 min. and they've been perfect, but will try the 15 to see if it makes a difference. After the wait period I gently pour the hot water out of the kettle, put a little tap water in and finish filling the kettle with ice.  No frig step, no other bowl to wash, no 2 hour wait, and they're perfect.   Thanks for the recipe.

IMPORTANT NOTE: it is helpful to know that you need to bring the eggs to a ROLLING BOIL. If you bring it just to a boil, your eggs will still be liquid inside!

This is exactly the way I've been doing my eggs for years.  The only difference is after the 15 minutes I rinse them under cold water, crack the bottoms and stick them in an ice water bath for about 10 minutes.  This lets the water get into the shells so they are always easy to peel & ready much faster than this recipes cooling method.  I also agree with other reviewers to use "older" eggs, if they are too fresh you will have problems peeling them no matter what you do.

Works every time!  This is very similar to the method recommended by the American Egg Board.  The egg board recommends 12 minutes for medium eggs, 15 minutes for large eggs, and 18 minutes for extra large eggs.  Be sure to allow the water to come to a FULL, ROLLING BOIL before taking them off of the burner.  Also, they may not cook all the way through if you don't cover the pan after removing it from the heat.  allowing them to boil for too long will cause a green ring around the yolk, which won't hurt you but sure doesn't look appetizing.  :)

Great recipe - for those at higher altitudes, boil eggs for 5 minutes and then take off the burner and let sit for 15 minutes. I live in Colorado (over 5,000 feet above sea level) and following this recipe exactly left me with slightly undercooked eggs.

I love hard boiled eggs and this recipe is foolproof. It's great to have some in the fridge to garnish salads, to take for lunch or for a quick protein snack. I don't think you need the 2 hour chill time before peeling though. I just leave them in the ice water and peel them once they are cool enough to handle.

I tried this recipe for the technique but I only followed it up till the part where you place the eggs in cold water cause I needed the eggs right away. My eggs turned out perfectly cooked and it saves on gas too, not having to boil it for 10-15 mins. My eggs peeled with no problem after I sat it in the cold water for 5 mins. I will definitely be using this technique from now on. Thanks for sharing.

I just left the kitchen after hard-boiling 10 large eggs for tomorrow's Deviled Eggs, basically using this recipe . . . almost. Took the eggs out of the refrigerator about 10 minutes before placing them in the 3-quart pan. I always do them in a single layer; don't know if that makes a difference, but it seems to work for me. Add enough water to go at least 1 inch over the eggs. Add salt. (I never did understand why this was done since the eggs were in a shell, but I've come to the conclusion that it's done to make the eggs more buoyant and off the bottom of the pan, like swimming in the ocean.) Place pan on high heat with lid slightly ajar until large bubbles appear on top of water, then immediately move pan to cold burner, put lid on tightly and set timer for 15 minutes. When timer rings, pour water off eggs and refill pan with cold water. Let eggs sit there while you fill a bowl with ice water. I find that peeling eggs as quickly as possible, even while they're still a little warm, makes the shell come off more easily. Once peeled and 'swished' in the water still in the pan to remove any little pieces of shell that might remain on them, I put the peeled eggs in the ice water, and then into a covered container to use tomorrow.

This is a good recipe, but one thing I've dicovered after years of boiling is not to use very fresh eggs. For some reason, 1-2 week old eggs work best, especially when peeling them.

Major Tip for getting eggs to peel easily learned from PBS Test Kitchen show--put ALOT LIKE 4 TABLESPOONSFUL OF SALT IN pan (it will not affect taste) but any egg will peel beautifully--I have always made boiled eggs this way just read the recipe to see if they got it right!!

Just an additional hint.  Don't just use cold water use ice cubes in the water which will keep it cold.  You can continue to add ice cubes until the eggs are completely cooled.  This works beautifully particulary if your like me and rarely use the ice cubes that have stacked up in the automatic ice maker.  I printed this info off and tacked it inside a cupboard door since I can never remember the times.  Thanks, since I have been using this method my eggs are always perfect and they never were before this.

I followed the directions to a T.  The eggs were cooked but not overdone and the yolks were creamy with no hint of green.  The problem I encountered was these eggs were really hard to peel.  Out of 6, I had 4 that had "dings" in them.  The other two peeled cleanly.  I'm going to give this a 5 star because maybe my eggs were too new.  I find that older eggs peel better than newer ones.  I really loved the taste and texture of the yolks.  I'll make eggs this way again.

Love this method! Couldn't be easier. I've even forgotten to plunge the eggs in an ice water bath after cooking and left them just steaming in their own hot water, and while a couple shells were cracked, the eggs themselves were perfect. This is foolproof!

One note: I have found that small eggs require only 12 minutes; then I cool 'em. Big ol' eggs require the full 15 minutes. 

Not only does this method yield perfect hardboiled eggs, but imagine the saved energy (gas or electric) since you don't boil for more than a minute, as opposed to other recipes that require 12 to 15 minutes of boiling!

Hardboiled eggs should always be peeled as soon as possible, and under a stream of cool water to make the egg retract away from the shell. Don't put your eggs in the frig if you want to get the peel off and keep your eggs looking pretty for presentation.

Yup! Yup! Yup!  This is the way my mother taught me to boil and peel eggs because it's the way her mother taught her.  And we always salted over the eggs before boiling.  Mom said it was to help keep the water from boiling too hard and keep them from banging into each other and cracking while boiling.  Others have told me it's to make them peel easier.  Whatever the purpose, it's the way I've always done it.  And I agree with the reviewer who said to use older eggs for easier peeling.  That's the absolute truth!  The fresher the eggs, the harder they are to peel!  Something about the albumen skin letting loose from the shell with age.

I used this recipe to hard boil my eggs for deviled eggs. They came out perfect. I used the trick of cracking one end with a spoon then putting in the water to cool. They peeled with no issues.

Over the years I have made dozens of hard boiled eggs, tried many different "recipes" and have always gotten the green film around the yolk.  This year for Easter I thought I would try one more hard boiled egg "recipe" and I have to say they turned out beautifully.  On another site it says 14 min. for medium eggs and 17 min for extra large.  I had large so I left mine in the pot of hot water for 16 min.  They turned out perfect!

Doesn't work at high altitude. If you follow this recipe at high altitude, you will not have cooked eggs.  I will try this again, but will experiment with leaving the eggs in boiling water for maybe 5 minutes before removing from heat.

I've always had trouble in getting my hard boiled eggs not to have the green colored ring around the yolk. These directions are definitely the way to remedy that. My yolks could have cooked a few seconds longer, so next time I think I will let them come to more of a rapid boil before I remove from the burner - I think I pulled them off too quickly. Thank You for the quick fix to my problem.

Cooked the eggs exactly as the recipe states, except when I took them out I put them in an ice bath and skipped the refridgerater step. They came out perfect. The prettiest hard boiled eggs I have ever made. The yolks were bright yellow all the way around and fully cooked :)

I keep chickens so I only have VERY fresh eggs.  The "trick" of slightly cracking the eggs before cooking them has NEVER failed.  Eggs cracked before cooking peel very easily and I never worry about a bad egg or one that has acquired other flavors from refrigeration.

Eggs turn out perfectly.  This is the method that I always use.  FYI: the ease of peeling an egg depends on how old it is.  When a chicken lays an egg there is no air in it.  As it cools (from body temp) an air pocket forms inside.  For some reason, the older the egg, the larger the air pocket.  They recomend that if you have 2 dozen eggs for easter to boil the older dozen and use the newer dozen for other egg related recipes.  Keep in mind also, that the shelf life of a hard boiled egg is lower...you can only keep them for about a week due to the protective covering being removed when you boil them.  However, unboiled eggs are good for 4-6 weeks in the fridge.  Hope this helps with some of the "too hard to peel" reviews:).

Here's the thing: If the eggs are cold, coming to a boil too quickly will cause them to crack or burst. Allow them to come to room temperature in a pan of warm, not hot water, and then follow the recipe. And, I use ice to cool them even more quickly.

The first time I did my eggs following this recipe they worked out just perfect!  The second time (just a few days later) they turned out awful.  The whites were sort of mushy and the yolk was not hard boiled.  Definitely did NOT work.  I can't figure out why it didn't work the second time. :(

Works lovely, but I crack the shells of the ones I put in the cold water so they peel easier, the ones that won't be eaten right away go straight to the fridge w/o the cold bath though.

Solid recipe.  I used extra large eggs and them sit for 17 minutes.  I also didn't wait to peel the eggs.  I peeled them after they sat in the cold water for 10 minutes or so.

I have a hard time making hard boiled eggs for some reason. The first time making them from this recipe, I kinda effed it up myself, but third times the charm! The shell slid right off the egg! Thank you!

I would have given this a 5 star except mine came out as soft boiled eggs. I could not use them for deviled eggs. Next time, will either allow eggs to room temp or boil 2-3 minutes. I live in NY so no high altitude issues.

Great directions.  I never know how long to cook my eggs.  Sometimes they are undercooked in the middle and sometimes they are overcooked and greenish.  This is perfect.  Thanks for making it so simple.

Maybe this one is for a different altitude, but I live in Montana and I followed these instructions EXACTLY. When I went to peel the eggs, the whites ripped open and the yolks totally weren't cooked. :(

I've been making deviled eggs for 50 yrs & needed to take several dozen to a Christmas party today.  I cooked 30 eggs for this.  I followed this recipe to a "T" & they were the worst eggs I've ever peeled.  The membrane was tightly adhered to the white of the egg making it impossible to get the shell off without damaging the white.  It took me 1 1/2 hrs to pull off the little pieces of shell.  Out of 30 eggs, instead of getting 60 deviled eggs, I ended up with 34 deviled eggs.  I will never use this recipe again.  Back to my old "tried & true".

I hate to be the first person to give these a bad review, but these did not work out for me at all- they were totally undercooked. The whites were mushy, the yolk had a gelatinous, almost liquid, consistency, and they were impossible to peel. I even let them boil for a few minutes before taking them off the heat and covering them, so they should have been overcooked if anything, right?  When I saw this recipe, I thought I was missing something spectacular, but it looks like I'll be going back to my old method.

Perfect method.  I usually only let them sit for about 12-13 mins. and it's perfect.  No unsightly green rings around the yolk and no more rubbery white!

I have been using this method of hard boiling eggs for years.  I only let them sit for 13 minutes in the hot water and they always turn out perfectly.  I don't usually boil a dozen at a time so that may account for the difference in timing.  Using this method there will be no more green ring or rubbery white.

Sometimes this recipe works perfectly - eggs peel easily.  Other times, this recipe doesn't work at all.  Have to assume it is the eggs.

IF your eggs are REALLY fresh & they will not peel - try this: Leave them out on the counter for 24 hours at room temperature & boil them according to these directions after the 24 hour period & they will peel perfectly.  I buy farm fresh eggs all the time now, & got this tip from someone in the food industry, we finally found something that works for farm fresh eggs.  Enjoy!!  :o)

This is how I have boiled eggs for years and they do come out perfect.  Like some others, I shake the pan hard and make sure they are all very cracked, fill the pan with cold water and ice and the shells come off very easily, sometimes the shell is off before I go to peel them!

This is a good recipe.  One thing that I learned many years ago from an agricultural lesson, was to take a needle and push a little hole in the large end of the egg.  Dianne

I think the sitting time after reaching the boil point, depends on what size the eggs are.  There is a big difference in cooking time, between small eggs and extra large eggs.

I basically do my eggs this way all the time. I never have the green line. If you let the eggs sit in hot water for 15 minutes and then in cold water and keep cold, the eggs shells will slide right off if you gently tap all around shells to crack.

I'm giving this four stars because the process makes you take more steps than you need to. Follow the instructions to the point of letting the eggs sit for 15 minutes. Take the pot and place it under cold, running water. (I do this until the pot itself is cool.) Leave cold water over the eggs. Check the water temperature every few minutes. When it starts getting warm, cool it off again. And, from my experience, the eggs are much easier to peel when you're done cooling them than they are after they've been in the refrigerator for two hours. In fact, when I take a hard-boiled egg out of the refrigerator, I put it in a glass with warm water in it for 2-3 minutes. I roll the shell on a hard surface so it breaks up a lot then start peeling at the bigger end. The key is to pick up that membrane at the top. The shell will almost roll off. Warming the shell of the egg makes that membrane much easier to get a hold of and peel off easily.

Everything is fine with this recipe except that you don't need to cool them in the fridge for 2 hours.  If they are cool enough to handle you can peel them and use them right away.  As soon as you place them in the cold water they stop cooking and the time in the fridge is wasted.  I know this because I often have to use them right away as they are usually an afterthought.  I use them to make egg salad for sandwiches, use them in potato salad, or even eat them for breakfast as soon as I can safely peel them.  Yummy.

After the fifteen minute cooking time has passed, I take off the shells under running cold water. It seems to help remove the shells better. Then I refrigerate.

This was a total failure. I followed the recipe and when we tried to peel them, the shells stuck and the membranes stuck to the whites. I used our oldest eggs since we have our own hens and I've always been told that fresh eggs are impossible to peel. I decided to try another method because we needed some prettier eggs to pickle and these were absolutely UGLY... I boiled a pot of water and added the eggs one at a time. After about 15 minutes I rinsed with cool water and covered them with ice. I peeled them once they were cold and the shells almost fell off. I even used eggs that were only a week old(fresher than any egg at the supermarket).

Except for the fact that these weren't quite done enough for my liking, they were otherwise perfect.  I'll just make a note to leave set for another 5 minutes the next time.  But followed instructions exactly, left them in the fridge for a couple of hours before peeling. Not only did these eggs peel easier than I have ever experienced before, they were bright white and yellow and tasted divine.  THANKS!

Making hard boiled eggs seems like a no brainer...its all about timing! This is a great recipe for newbies, or anyone in search of making perfect eggs (ie. minus the green tinge or sulfurous odor)

I only gave this 3 stars because the yolks did indeed come out a beautiful yellow, but 3 of the eggs were a little underdone and all of the 24 eggs shells stuck.  I was super excited to try this, because of all the great reviews. Been looking for a recipe where the shells don't stick. I followed this down to the last letter and my shells stuck. I even followed adivce from those who said to use eggs closer to the expiration date. They were one day from expiring.  I only boiled 12 at a time also.  I was hoping I somehow screwed up the first pot and the second pot would come out fine...but nope..both pots yielded stuck shells. I was doing deviled eggs for easter tonight, and my egg whites looks jagged...thank God they taste good cz they look horrible... :( Back to the drawing board.

PERFECT !!!! I'm eating them right now, because I'm too hungry to throw them in the fridge... Yumyumyum. Yolks are perfectly yellow and centered. I used to always boil the hell out of my eggs because I never knew the "right" way to make them. So glad I do now!!! Thanks so much for sharing. :)

This really works for hard boiled eggs! I always have just guessed at the time for eggs and most of the time, they turned out fine....but...there have been some times when they were not done! I will always do them this way from now on.

to peel the eggs i usually just pour off the hot water, put the lid on the pot and shake the dickens out of them.  then rinse in cold water until cool enough to peel.  older eggs are easier to peel.

I Learned this from a friend many years ago. When you are ready to drop the eggs into cold water...use ice water.  It separates the shells from the eggs perfectly and the shells literally slip right off! So glad to get this great cooking method too!

Always cook my eggs this way & they turn out perfect every time.  I have a egg piercer and when I remember to use it, it helps when peeling the eggs.  The shell comes right off!  Another way is to wait until the eggs are cool enough to handle & crack them all over & place them back in the cool water for 1 hour allowing the water to seep between the egg & the membrane inside the shell.  Learned this from Chef John on this site during his how to cook an egg video.  I found that it's never too late to learn another kitchen trick.

I hate to give a bad rating but I've tried this a few times & I wouldn't think that I could mess it up but it's never turned out for me.  I found another method where you bring the water to a boil, carefully add the eggs, boil 14-16 minutes & immediately submerge eggs into ice water until cooled.  I run the eggs under water while peeling and the peel just falls right off!  The yolks also stay wonderfully creamy & yellow!

Great! Just a couple of tips to add. For easier peeling, don't use really fresh eggs. Just learned this recently after being unsuccessful many times with trying to peel boiled eggs (thanks, RE friends!) Also, being at higher altitudes may neccesitate a slightly longer cooking time before you turn off the heat (mine were slightly underdone).

I don't want to give this a bad rating because apparently this method works for most of you, but I live in Hungary and the eggs here taste and look much different than back home in the states, and this method didn't work for me.  I used fresh eggs from the market and after following these steps the yolks were still uncooked in the very middle.  I have to leave my eggs in the hot water for 20-25 minutes for the middle of the yolks to be completely cooked.  So I guess the cooking time depends on the size and freshness of the eggs.

Who knew you needed a recipe to boil eggs.  This is one of those things that we should all know how to do, but how many of us still have green yolks?  Foolproof directions for perfectly boiled eggs. Thank you!

Suggestion: Run a little cold water over 2 eggs while you crack and peel to make sure eggs are truly cooked! Put a little butter, garlic powder, salt and pepper on those hot eggs and enjoy! I cracked the other eggs with spoon, dropped them in a bowl of water with a little ice and stuck em in the frig. They peeled perfectly, looked beautiful, yellow yolk, no probs! Thanks so much for this basic info!

Thank you so much for sharing this. My mother taught me differently and I got to say this is the new WAY! Boiled 2 dozen eggs and not one cracked. They were easy to peel. Made beautiful deviled eggs. Also, used some for potato salad. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Some reviewers are finding the eggs hard to peel; it probably isn't the recipe. The fresher the egg, the 'stickier' the shell. My sister used to keep chickens, and when she planned on hard-boiling eggs, she would let them sit in the fridge for at least a week before cooking. Otherwise they were really impossible to peel without the shell shredding the egg white.

You'd think boiling an egg would be simple, but it's not.  The method in this recipe REALLY works!  It produced beautiful yellow yolks with no green.  The hardest part is peeling the eggs.  I think the biggest factor in peeling eggs is the freshness of the eggs.  Very fresh eggs will not peel easy.  I tried the baking soda method and gently cracking the egg shells before cooling and neither method made it easy to peel the eggs.  My eggs were too fresh.

Thank you SO much for sharing this cooking method! I so rarely boil eggs that I can never remember how, and this worked perfectly. To anyone having trouble peeling them, pay attention to the "age" of your eggs. If they're too fresh, they'll be nearly impossible to peel, regardless of the method you use to cook them.

I am trying this way of hard boiling eggs right now...I too want the perfect hard boiled egg so thanks Rockyroad for this recipe :) I just wanted to add a little trick to peeling the hard boiled egg perfectly every time. You put a little baking soda in the water when boiling eggs. Then when the eggs have cooled break a little shell off of each end of the egg. Hold the egg to your mouth and BLOW hard. Catch the egg with the other hand as it pops right out of one of the holes you made in the shell...works perfect everytime. I haven't tried this deshelling method with this recipe but just cooling the eggs with water for a bit this deshelling method works awesome...I will try it with this recipe also and let you know if it works too. :o)

The eggs were perfectly done!  They even peeled easy (although that could've been the age of the eggs...fresh eggs are almost impossible to peel).  I refrigerated them overnight and peeled them the next day to make egg salad.  YUM!

Green tinge is usually when the eggs are cooked too long. I usually bring the water to a boil, cover the pot and turn off the heat and leave it on the burner for 12 minutes. Meanwhile I take a big bowl and fill it with ice cubes and cold water in the sink. Once the 12 minutes is up, I poor out the hot water from the pot and shake the eggs up to crack the shells and dump them into the bowl of ice water. Then I stir them around to cool them off. I never have a problem peeling the shells off after that. Using fresh organic/farm eggs are always the best!

I wish the recipe would've called for older eggs. I used fresh eggs & they are impossible to peel. I'm glad other reviews commented on this issue as well. As for the cook time, I could have probably been better leaving them in a couple minutes less - as someone else mentioned elevation is a big factor as far is cooking time is concerned. I am in Miami Beach elevation is basically at sea level. In any case the yorks were a bit stiff but color was good none the less

One added trick to this recipe is add a shirt pour of white vinegar. It will help when peeling your eggs. My grandmothers advise and it totally works!

Always cool to see different ways to cook eggs. So auto 5 stars for this. I usually bring my eggs to a slow boil and as soon as it does i turn the heat off and leave it for 12 minutes..perfect yolks everytime. Sometimes i shock them in ice water or when lazy I toss them in the freezer.

Surprised that no one mentioned adding baking soda to the ice bath. This has been very successful for me in having a good peeling experience. I will try the salt method too.

An easy recipe for making 18 eggs at a time.  The eggs did taste and look good. I did add 1 tsp salt and 1/4 cup white vinegar, hoping it would help make the eggs easier to peel.  I'm not sure if the salt and vinegar did anything, more testing needed.  I'm wondering if the ease of peeling the eggs is more related to the  freshness of eggs, as other reviewers noted.  Fresh eggs=harder to peel, older eggs=easier to peel?  This will be my go to recipe for the infrequent times I need hard boiled eggs.

I have cooked eggs this way for years, and it's by far the easiest and most foolproof. If you forget them nothing much happens because the water is steadily cooling off. If your shells stick it is not because of the cooking method but is the result of cooking eggs that are too fresh.  They lose moisture as they age and will come out of the shells more easily if you wait to cook them at about a week or less before the date on the box.  Also, as others have mentioned, I leave them in the pan with plenty of ice water and they will be cold about twenty minutes after cooking.

The correct way to hard boil eggs--you can find it in older cookbooks.  For those who have trouble peeling the eggs, the key there is not how you boil the eggs but the age of the eggs.  The fresher the egg, the harder they are to peel.  If you can anticipate your need for hard boiled eggs, buy the eggs and let them 'age'.

I was always told that putting salt or vinegar in the water is so that if an egg cracks, it will keep the white from seeping out into the water.  But I've recently read a tip that adding a little baking soda will make them easier to peel.  I've tried it, and it works! I no longer bother with vinegar or salt. For all those who have trouble peeling the eggs.....I always put the cooked eggs IMMEDIATELY into a bowl of ice water, even if I'm not using them right away.  The ice water shocks them and stops the cooking immediately.

For those complaining of eggs not being done or being hard to peel, there are more factors involved. Extra Large eggs will take a little longer. Water boils at a lower temperature in higher elevations, so they may need more time in those circumstances. The freshest eggs are hardest to peel. Older eggs peel easier. For most people, this is the perfect time. I have done my eggs this way for years, and they are perfectly cooked every time. I also just plunge them in ice water. I don't bother to keep changing the water. It is not necessary.

Using older eggs makes the peeling easier.   The egg material shrinks when eggs get a few days old so it creates a little bit of air within the shell.  Makes all the difference in peeling.

Perfect every time. I hadn't made boiled eggs in a very long time and remembered a version similar to this. I think the cooling process in this recipe is what makes these eggs so "divine."

This works like a charm, but I have a tip for those out there with induction stove tops.  The water comes to a boil so quickly, you can't follow this recipe verbatim. You need to bring the water to a boil more slowly, like a normal cook top would do.  I set my stove to 8 for 7 minutes, then turn it to high until it comes to a full boil; but this is when I do a full dozen eggs. Rest of the recipe works like a charm. Took me a few attempts to get this right on my cook top when I first got it.

I have always cooked my eggs 12-15 minutes at a softly rolling boil and they turned out well cooked with firm meat and soft, butter yellow yolk. I've heard of this method a lot so decided to give it a try. I followed the instructions exact and it just didn't work. I've always cooled my eggs in water and never had the green ring. I put some ice cubes in the water this time; maybe I stopped the cooking process too fast? Regardless, I'm going back to my old method. If it ain't broke don't fix it :)

Living at altitude, I followed the advice of a reviewer and let the eggs boil for 5 mins., then let sit for 15 mins. covered.  I did add ice to the pan after draining and let them sit in the ice for about 15 mins (I was vacuuming) :).  I couldn't wait to see if they were good, so I peeled one right away.
It was perfect...thank you.

These are THE BEST eggs I have ever made! I went exactly by the recipe...no salt, no vinegar. If you put the eggs in the pot at the VERY beginning and follow this recipe EXACTLY you will also have perfect eggs to eat!

Perfect! The only thing I did different was that I let the eggs cool in cold water and then peeled them without putting them in the fridge.

Many thanks to the reviewers who shared the tip of cracking the cooked eggs before plunging into ice cold water to help with peeling! I would've never thought to do that and it worked great.

Great!  My husband had given up on trying to make hard boiled eggs because they would never peel-most of the egg's white always came with when peeling.  We had tried many different methods.  This is the keeper!!  Only thing I did differently was to add 1 tsp salt to water at beginning-this helps to be sure they peel easily!

If peeled eggs are needed at once, drain the pan after the eggs have cooked and fill it halfway with cold faucet water. Shake it about with the lid on to crack the shells.  Then, in turn for each egg, fish it out of the water, peel its shell off under cold running water, and lay it in a colander to drain for a few minutes.

Just hard boiled my eggs for egg salad using this recipe and they turned out perfect. The suggestion of Little Old Lady on this site said to turn heat down to low and let the eggs simmer 1 - 2 min longer for high altitude and I know that's why this recipe worked for me as I live in Colo.  I too had never had any luck guessing how long to boil eggs!  And also make sure your lid is tight on your pan.  If you have old pans like me where the lids don't fit tight anymore then put saran wrap over the top of your pan after taking it off the heat and then place your lid on top of the saran wrap so the heat doesn't escape.

I always make my boiled eggs this way.  Mom always put salt in the water though.  I think it was so that if the egg cracked it would not "spread" all through the water.  Anyway, for those people who said this recipe did not work, I think some of them are not putting the cover on the pot when they first put the eggs on the stove (at least one failed review read like that).  You have to cover the eggs with water (I use cold water), then put the lid on the pan, then bring it to a boil.  After that leave the lid on the pot while timing for 15 minutes.  And if someone has trouble peeling the eggs, I think it's the fault of the freshness of the eggs, not the fault of the cooking method.  I cool the eggs in cold water first, but then I peel them under cold running water (I don't refrigerate first).  This helps get the peel off, but if an egg is too fresh, it will be harder to peel.  Anyway, this method has always worked for me!

This is a PERFECT way to boil an egg. I only let the eggs sit in the water for 10 minutes after boiling. I also peel within about 1 hour of sitting in cool water. Sometimes sooner. The yolks never have that nasty green layer around them. Awesome evry single time!!!

Tried this recipe twice. They WERE NOT EASY TO PEEL either time. In fact, I lost at least half of the white every time I tried. It's true that the yolk stayed nice and yellow, but I don't know how anyone would be able to use these for deviled eggs because there would not be enough of the white left in tact to do so.

shelled perfectly.....extra hint...put ALOT of salt in the water....breaks down the shells just enough to make peeling easy and less time consuming for the little ones who like to help mom in the kitchen

I'll give it a 2 because they came out hard-boiled.  They are very ugly due to the fact that they look like they've been through a wood chipper.  The shells were impossible to peel and most of the egg white went with them.  They will make for an interesting topic at Easter dinner....

Made three batches of a dozen eggs. All eggs have butter yellow yokes. Perfect! My poor choice to buy fresh eggs probably led to a few being hard to peel (6 of 36 were difficult. Cracking lightly before adding to ice water bath seemed to help.

This was great!  I always just sorf of guess at how long to boil them for and whether to put them in the water before or after it starts boiling...i always hear different things of how to do it "right", but this was super easy, and something I'll be able to remember and not have to research every time I need boiled eggs.  THANKS!

OMG! This is the ONLY recipe on AllRecipes where EVERYONE followed the recipe and rated it off of the cooks intended result! HA! Not that I have a problem with people making their own recipes. Its just funny when people are like "I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT for bla bla bla and I added bla bla and it didn't taste good!" Ohh I love you allrecipes :-)

These turned out really good - I usually have trouble peeling my hard-boiled eggs, but the inside was perfect and it peeled quite well.  Will use again.

I used this recipe to make colored eggs for Easter. Because the eggs still had to be warm in order for the dye to work, I only soaked them in cold water for a short time. This seemed to work just fine, because the eggs came out beautifully with no green tinge on the yolks. Thanks for sharing!

The 1st time I tried this the yolks were perfect...but I'm having trouble peeling the eggs (the white wants to come off with the shell). Maybe they needed more than 15mins?? I'll try leaving them a little longer next time.

I really like this method of hardboiling eggs, but I think that I would have liked 1 more minute of my eggs. The color is lovely, and they made good deviled eggs, but next time I'll do 16-17 minutes.

Thanks so much for posting this! I've always had trouble with hard-boiled eggs not peeling well, and of course my yolks of many colors :)... anyway this technique solved all the problems I'd had... also thanks to everyone for the additional great tips!

If I were being technical, I'd have to say this is more a cooking method than a recipe.  But I don't really care.  I don't usually have problems with boiling eggs, but I thought I'd try it this way.  Works just as well as my method of boiling for 10-15 minutes, then cooling.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used to be hesitant with this method of hard-boiled eggs, but I followed the recipe to a T and it worked perfectly.

Seems my original review was "edited".  This is exactly how a certain celebrity cooks her eggs on her daily show and it never fails - - the shells come right off with no trouble.

I live at altitude 6800 and figured I needed to cook a bit longer.  Followed directions, but cooked at rolling boil for 5 minutes - 4 may have been enough - followed by the 15 minute sit. 
 Then I cracked them with a spoon and put them in ice water until they were cool - 30+ minutes.  Peeled easily.  THanks!

This works really well. But the best way ever to peel eggs, and the fastest , is to let eggs cool, then place in a glass about 8 oz. glass will do. Then shake it. The shell breaks completely, then take off shell. I do this over the trash container. Rinse with water. Done.

The eggs turned out perfect
I tried them this way and I actually prefer it so I don't have to worry about burning hot water splashing up while I try to put the eggs in. The yolk was exactly how I had hoped they would be. 

I'm 15. So it's safe to say, it's pretty easy, safe, and works amazing

Although I did not do the refrigeration because I simply could not wait to eat this scrumptious looking egg, it tasted really good and came out perfectly. It is my first time boiling an egg, and I must admit that this is a great start to doing so!

I felt very silly looking up a recipe for hard boiled eggs, because isn’t the method in the name? Just boil them? But I kept getting dry green yolks. Totally unappetizing. The first, and every time since, I have followed these instructions, I have managed to make perfect hard boiled eggs. If you’re looking for softer yolks, just leave them in the boiled water for a shorter amount of time.

Quick & easy way to hard boil a dozen eggs. Just don't start yapping on the phone like I did and overcook them. Otherwise they were perfect for my air fired scotch eggs! Think I will do them again this weekend.

been doing this way for years with great results every time. I also add some plain white vinegar (a good splash) in case any eggs have cracks you can't see, keeps the egg from leaking out into the cooking water. also if you use the pasta drainer basket, it's very easy to lift all the eggs out once boiled, then use same large pot for the cold water bath

This is the easiest and best method to get perfectly cooked, hard-boiled eggs that release from their shells without an ugly greenish-grey film around the yolk, no vinegar or baking soda needed.  Use old eggs (1- 2 weeks old), follow the directions exactly, and you shouldn't have any trouble.

Makes lovely, not-gray eggs that are easy to peel, especially if you crack the shells a bit when immersing in cold water.

Turned out excellent. Only difference is,  after boiling, I transferred the eggs back into the carton right away (labeled them as Hard Boiled) and put them in the refrigerator with the lid up for faster cooling.

Horrible never had such a hard time peeling my eggs. I made some the other day without chilling from same carton of eggs and had no problem. Not sure if chilling made the problem but the egg shell stuck to all the eggs and could not peel them with out eggs coming with it. Was making deviled eggs for get together , but now had to go to store and buy something pre made very disappointed!!

These are perfect! Followed the directions exactly. I also took the advice of other reviewers and did not use fresh eggs. Tapped them on the counter on all sides to crack the shell and peeled under running water, the she'll peeled off super easily.

Nope. For eggs that peel easily, gently lower eggs into boiling water. Lower to a simmer for 11 minutes.

Followed the recipe exactly and could not peel even one egg of the 2 dozen without destroying the eggs.  Peels stuck so bad I had to salvage the pieces and make egg salad.

Thank you Gail.  I used your trick and the eggs came out perfect.  Very easy to peal.  No eggs pulling apart.  The colder the easier to peel.

Thank you again Gail.  Great tip.

I made this with only one adjustment: I let them sit for 12 minutes before putting them in a bowl of ice water. It came out perfect! I'm doing it this way from now on!

Sure, my yolks weren't green, but I couldn't peel the eggs... the shells held on for dear life to the whites and peeled up some of the white when I did get them off, or the membrane stayed behind... not a good mouth feel at all.  I am still looking for the perfect hard boiling recipe.

Overall, this method worked out great. They were cooked perfectly. Out of 20 eggs, I had about five that were difficult to peel. As suggested, I used the older eggs I had instead of the ones I had just bought. I didn't have time to let them cool in the refrigerator for two hours, but cooled them in ice water. Maybe that's why some were difficult.  Will definitely try this method again, though.

I never thought "hard boiled eggs" would be a recipe I had to look up each time I wanted to make them. But I do, and it works every time, and without double checking the recipe I would do something different and the outcome would be at best, unpredictable. At least with this recipe, the outcome is 100% perfect!

This method worked out great. I've tried making boiled eggs in the past and they'd either not cook through or I couldn't peel them. Did just as directed and they cook just right. I did as other suggested and shook eggs till broken just after draining them and they peeled just perfectly.

It always takes longer than 15 minutes off the burner.  I think 18 minutes is more like it.

Made it twice and each time the shell stuck to the egg when I tried to peel them. Even left them in the fridge longer the second time to chill. Still they stuck to the shell. I'm trying a different recipe next time.

I've tried many different ways to make hard-boiled eggs, this is without a doubt the easiest and best way. Not only did the eggs come out perfect but they were very easy to peel.

I made these eggs but added another 2 minutes in the water "just in case." I really don't know if the extra time was needed...all I know is that they turned out perfectly! Thank you Rockyroad!

Works great. When using a lid that vents the steam,  I leave it in the burner after it's turned off.

Thank you for this! I'm a first timer, however, and I was confused. At first you say leave pot covered (assumably with eggs in it) for 15. The you add "Meanwhile...add eggs to cold water." I'm learning so what may seem "common sense" to you isn't for me. Chef John offers unquestionable directions in 'How To Make Perfect Hard boiled Eggs."

You have to let them boil for a minute or two before moving them to the cool burner. Otherwise, this recipe makes perfect boiled eggs.

I've used this method many times for hard-boiled eggs and this is all you need to do. No need for baking soda, salt, or vinegar. If you just empty out the hot water and fill it with cold tap water, that will make it cool enough to handle.  I love toasted whole grain bread topped with sliced avocado then sliced a egg with a side of fruit for breakfast.

This method worked well.  I took the advice from some reviews and gave my eggs a vigorous shake in the pan after draining and must have been too vigorous.  2 of my eggs broke apart, shell and egg together.  So if you try that suggestion, maybe don't go for a vigorous shake, just a shake.

I have used this method to cook eggs for over 30 years, it is the best and fool-proof. I have always called them Hard-cooked Eggs, because there is no boiling  involved.  Also, living at a high altitude (5,000 feet) , I leave them in the hot water 30 minutes, and they have always been perfect. It took me a long time to figure out that older eggs work best as some other reviewers mentioned.    Basic tips like this one are so appreciated. Thanks for posting. Bobbi Marie

I tried this cooking procedure, twice.  Both total failures. Eggs whites were runny as were the yokes!  After the first time, I thought I must have goofed up the timer.  After the second ruined batch, I thought about it and noticed the recipe does NOT specify the size of the eggs (I used extra large)!  Nor does it say if the eggs are put in the water from the fridge or started at room temperature - both the egg size and the starting temp of the egg makes a difference!  Adjust your cooking time if you are using extra large eggs - as I was!

This is the ticket! The eggs are done perfectly. Seems strange the first time you cook them, but they make the perfect eggs!!eggs are a little hard to peel but you have to deal with that at times.

Great recipe. Simple and easy. I've made this one several times and the yolks always come out perfect. As others have pointed out, it may be difficult to peel eggs that are too fresh. I find that eggs that have been in our refrigerator for at least a week peel much easier. I also add salt to the water before boiling.

This is the BEST way to boil perfect eggs. As a reader suggested, I drained them after 15 minutes, shook pan vigerously to crack them, added ice cubes and water to cool them for 10 minutes or so. They peeled beautifully when run under warm water. Best method I've found in over 50 years. THANKS!

I always cook my eggs similar to this. I boil for about 1 minute, turn the pot off and leave it on the burner. After about 20  to 30 minutes, I dump the water and I am good to go!! No green yolks.

As easy as it might seem to boil an egg it really is hard to get it just right, and this does it! Really makes a great hard boiled egg

I boil eggs using this method all the time and it works like a charm - however, do NOT crack them and put them in cold water as other reviewers have suggested. I was using some very fresh eggs that were difficult to peel so I tried this, and I ended up throwing 8 out of the 12 eggs away because half of the egg peeled off with the shell!  Whenever you can, use eggs that have been in the fridge for a week or so.  Peeling goes MUCH easier that way.

I was the worst at making hard boiled eggs. When I peeled the shell off, half the egg would come with it. So frustrating!! Especially when your taking deviled eggs to a party. They would look terrible. Now after finding this way of cooking them, they come out PERFECT every time. No more worrying.  Thank you!

Love this recipe. Super easy and straightforward. The only addition I made was adding crumbled bacon to the yoke mix and combined cayanne pepper and paprika for garnish. I wish I had green and black olives, but was out.

I first learned this method from chef Daniel Ahern a few years ago and couldn't believe that I'd been making the hard-cooking of an egg such a big deal! I'd add that it helps to use a nice roomy pot and lots of water so you retain heat for the entire 15 or 20 minutes. I'm going to try the salt and vinegar suggested by several reviewers to assist shelling. Believe that difficulty in shelling is more a result of the freshness of the egg than the cooking method.

Thank you! Thank you!!  I am a pretty good cook and I could not for the life of me hard boil an egg.  I am kind of embarrased to even say that and if any of my friends read this they would laugh.  But now I can cook one and it has open my world up to some new dishes.  Honestly I think this should be one of the first things any cook should learn.  It teaches treating ingredients lightly, timing and temperture.  You turned me into a better cook.

I thought it was great to find the proper way to hard boil an egg on here. I learned this method years ago, from a cooking show, but so many people still cook them incorrectly. Kudos to Rockyroad for posting this!

Make sure you use a big pot for this, lots of water, bring it to a full rolling boil, then put the lid on the pot when you remove it from the heat.  This way the heat is retained as long as possible.  If you put a generous amount of salt in the cooking water (2-3 tablespoons), drain the water from the pot after cooking and shake the eggs around in the pan before putting them in cold water (which by the way you can just pour into the cooking pot, no need to dirty a bowl), the shells of even fresh eggs will come off easily.  If you decide to cook fewer eggs in a smaller pot, you will probably need to extend the time that the eggs sit in the water by 5 or so minutes.

I had never hard boiled eggs before but really wanted some for a cobb salad.  This was easy and they turned out great! A little hard to peel but probably because I didn't refrigerate long enough.

wow these turned out perfect, ive never made suh fluffy, light egg salad before! at first i thought they looked like they had a tiny small spot of undercooked yolk but then again, i only set them in the cold water for like ten minutes. once i smashed em up , stirred em around and started fluffing them, i realized how much i have been over cooking hard boiled eggs for so long though, these looked great.

I definately suggest letting the eggs sit for a couple of extra minutes at higher altitudes. This has been the easiest method to get perfect eggs, by far! Thanks for sharing!

Looking forward to trying this method when I return to a more civilized elevation.  I'm wintering around 8,000 feet, and as another reviewer noted, following the methods as written leaves you with not quite done eggs.  Let 'em boil a few extra minutes and they'll be properly set.  As for the batch I made first, my dog is enjoying them very much- usually she only gets the yolk!

It might sound silly because I've been cooking for years, but I never really knew how to hard boil an egg properly. I followed this method exactly and got beautiful, non-rubbery eggs. Thanks.

Yes!  This is the CORRECT way to make perfect hard boiled eggs.  I only let them sit covered for 14 minutes instead of 15 but other than that this method delivers beautiful hard boiled eggs.  If you chill them in ice water they will be ready in 20 minutes and will be easy to peel.  Just remember to remove the shell and membrane together.

These came out beautiful. I do find that cold eggs are really hard to peel so minutes after I transfered to the first batch of cold water I peeled them under running warm water with no problem. The I wrapped in paper toweld and put them into a ziplock bag in the fridge. No more guess work this is great!

Yolks turned out great, but they were very hard to peel.  Next time, i'll try cracking the shell with a spoon before refrigeration as someone else had suggested.

Followed the instructions to a T, and I thought the yolks were a little under-done. That wouldn't have mattered to me if I were using them in egg salad or deviled eggs, since the yolk gets all mixed in with other stuff. But I was using these straight up, quartered for chef salads, and the yellow was very pretty but just looked and felt under-done. Next time I will leave them sitting in the hot water for an extra few minutes. Thanks for the recipe, and there are lots of helpful tips in the reviews on this one.

Perfect Eggs!  Just a tip ... Fresh eggs are harder to peel, so buy the eggs a couple of days before you plan on using them.

Pretty funny that I happened to stumble upon this recipe. Who would have thought you would find it here on AR? But it was definitely helpful! I too have always wondered how long to cook eggs! They came out perfect - With a yellow yolk and no gray coloring around the yolk!

This method for hard-boiling eggs did yield very yellow yolks.  However, the eggs didn't seem any easier to peel.
