This salad should be called Perfect salad! I didnt have some of the colors so I added other things to make up for it. No shrooms,, instead  I used fresh cheese, I used a peeler to make carrot ribbons and totally forgot about the peppers:( Next time I will put them in. Delicious Thank you Black Lace Rose.
