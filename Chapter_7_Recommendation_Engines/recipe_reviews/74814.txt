These were a success, everyone loved them.  For those who have not tried the recipe yet, follow the amounts listed.  I was improvising a little and the result was too much spinach, but that was my own fault.

Pretty delicious and simple to make.  I did not have heavy cream and simply substituted milk and melted butter whisked together.  It worked out well.  I served it as a side dish, but it would definitely work as either a lunch or dinner.

This was tasty. When I was pouring the cream on it seemed like it would be too much, but once it baked and set it turned out fine. I used soy bacon to make this vegetarian--if anyone else is going this route, cook the soy bacon separately first to get it nice and crispy, then add it to the onion. This will majorly improve the texture of the finished product.

These potatoes are fantastic!  Made them for the holidays and people couldn't get enough.  So nice to have another potato casserole option at dinner time.  Thanks for sharing Erin

Packed with flavor!  I think this recipe is perfect as is, and I wouldn't change a thing.  It's very rich, but I think it could be lightened up if you wanted to cut a few calories.  I would saute the pancetta, drain it, and clean the pan.  Then saute the onions separately.   Go for a part-skim cheese and half & half instead of cream.  But I think I'll just keep it as is!

This had great taste, but an hour was not enough to cook the potatoes through. Mine were still chewy after an hour and 10 minutes! I also substituted regular bacon for the pancetta.

Easy to make and tastes pretty good. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and bacon instead of pancetta.

Delicious!! Used 8 cups of fresh spinach and wilted it with the onions once they were soft.  I left out the bacon and added a little salt to each potato layer.  Will definitely make again!

Hhhmmm what do I do with these left over potatoes? This recipe was perfect. I had everything except pancetta bacon which I substituted for regular bacon. This turned out so good my husband ate the left overs the next day for breakfast and lunch. Thanks for making me shine in the kitchen!

Great way to use spinach! I used fresh spinach, didn't measure it just used enough to cover layers and made it without meat. Tasted great! Used plenty of cheese and for heavy cream used half 2%milk , half cottage cheese and threw in 1 egg. Will definitely make again. Would be great by adding spaghetti sauce for a noodle less lasagna!

I followed the the recipe exactly.  I thinly sliced 6 potatoes just in case, but found that it was way too much for the medium sized baking dish I used.  I also found that the potatoes were still a little bit "el dente" after the 1 hr 30 min. cooking time.  I would cook it for about 15 minutes more next time.  It was still absolutely delicious!! Don't change the recipe at all - perfect as is.  Will definitely make again!

This was delicious!  I used regular bacon as I couldn't find the pancetta and I cooked it in the crockpot as to not heat my house up.  I will definitely be making this again!

It was a little too cheesy for me. I think next time I will use less cheese and maybe add a little flour or cornstarch to the 1/2 & 1/2 or cream

These are very yummy!!!  My husband (who isn't a big fan of spinach) kind of turned his nose up when I told him I was making "spinach potato casserole"  Ended up with him saying we should have these with a holiday dinner!!!  Relatively simple to make! Thank you for the recipe!!

To save time, I left the skin on the potatoes, used fresh spinach and more cheese as my family really loves cheese. I also added 2 eggs to help congeal the milk. It was fabulous!

These were very tasty. I halved the recipe but used 4 oz of pancetta. I really think they could have used even more, but this dish was very good as written. I will make this again.

Considering my homey ate half the pan of this tonight I’m gonna day an instant winner. I did not use the bacon (didn’t have it) and used fresh spinach not frozen I cooked (was given 5 lbs of spinach to use up from my mom). Used milk mixed with butter to dump on it and added chives one top.

Easy and delicious. I didn’t include mushrooms, as my grandkids don’t like them and tripled the spinach.

Used red and white small potatoes, added thyme, tarragon, garlic, smoked paprika and red pepper flakes. Used fresh spinach; threw in after onion sautéed. Used cheddar cheese. This was fabulous. I only changed the recipe a little as I used what I have on hand and I love adding herbs.

I had fresh spinach instead of frozen and just washed it and layered it in.
I used regular bacon instead of pancetta.
I also messed up and missed covering it for the first hour, so I covered it for the last half hour instead.
I plan on trying this again but I think I'll cook the spinach with the onion and bacon next time, and cut back on the cream a bit (might also use all or part plain yogurt and milk instead for a slightly healthier take).
Any issues I had with the dish were my own doing except that I had WAY more potato than needed (even when I increased how much I put in each layer).

Delicious!  We are vegetarian so I made it without the pancetta, and I had fresh spinach so I used that and added some garlic.  It came out great, and I feel like it's an easy recipe to modify according to what's on hand - some chopped sauteed bell peppers would be good, mushrooms, etc.  Will definitely make again.

While this was good I don't think I will make it again. There's too many changes that I would have to do to make it suitable for my family. For some reason, we just weren't 'turned on' by these flavors combined together. 
Good start however and thanks for sharing.

I liked this dish, however it is somewhat bland.  I like the addition of the spinach.  When I make it again I will add a little more spinach, some garlic and maybe some diced spicy sausage.  The potatoes I used were very large, so I may reduce it to four next time.  Good dish!

This is very tasty. I used canned new potatoes to save on cooking time
