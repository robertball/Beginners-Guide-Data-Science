This is a great recipe!  I either double the recipe and use a 9 x 13 pan or quadruple the recipe and use an 11 x 17 pan.  To make this easy recipe even easier, I just melt the butter on the stove in a big saucepan, take it off the heat, and dump in all the other ingredients, mix with a whisk, and pour it in the pan.  It takes me like 5 minutes to make these when I do it this way.  Since these brownies get a "film" on the top of them when they bake, it's best not to frost these.  They are so rich anyways, they don't need frosting.  Instead I just add chocolate chips, toffee pieces, nuts, or whatever else right into the batter.  I have also added instant coffee powder, rum, and butterscotch sauce.  Everytime I make them, they turn out so good and are so easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I couldn't believe how easy these were to make once I tasted them. I used all purpose flour and they came out nice and fudgy. They also had a nice crisp top and moist center.

Great recipe! Substituted 1/2 All-purpose flour plus 3/4 tsp. baking powder plus an additional 1/4 tsp salt (making 1/2 tsp salt total) for the self-rising flour. Did 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter. Mixed with a stand mixer. Add a little powdered sugar mmmm the kids loved it. we ate the whole pan right when it came out of the oven!!!!!

Took literally 5 minutes to make!  Turned out moist, and not too sweet (so you can eat more of them!). Perfect for drop-in company. Try adding crunched up Heath toffee bars to the bottom before pouring the batter - wow!  Thanks for the recipe!

These brownies were so delicious.  I used margarine and all-purpose flour, and they were still the best I've ever had!  First batch was eaten so quickly that I had to make another the same day.  Double the recipe and cook a bit longer and they'll turn out heavenly.  :)

These brownies are nice.  I have a serious sweet tooth, and this recipe was still too sweet for me.  Consider using less sugar.  Thank you Jenn

Use regular all-purpose flour and add 1/4 tsp. baking powder, and you've got "Best Brownies" from this site.  No wonder I liked these.

I think this is one of the best brownie recipes
I have ever tried! They rose well, and they were moist and delicious. I made them for my children and they loved them also, and they were very easy to make. I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 inch pan, as I have a large family.

Made double the recipe in a 9 X 13 pan and baked for 30 minutes. These brownies are a great return for the effort you put in. As per another reviewer, I mixed all the other ingredients into the large pot that I melted the butter in, thus cutting down on dishes. I didn't add nuts, but I'm sure they would be good too. Dusted the greased pan with cocoa powder so that the brownies would be prettier. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I will be sure to make again.

Needed a quick dessert to take to a New Years Eve party.  I only had self-rising flour on hand, so I searched for that ingredient.  It let me to this recipe.  I'm glad it did.  They turned out great!

My family liked these...but I found them a little dry (even though I cooked for 5 min. less then recommended - could have done with even less time in the oven).  I did like the richness of the chocolate flavour though.

Nice brownies, moist and chewy, but not spectacular. I put snickers in my brownie instead of walnuts. Also very easy to make.

Fantastic! These are the only brownies I make now. The only thing I changed was that I use all-purpose flour instead of self-rising as we all prefer a chewy brownie to a cake-like brownie.

These were really good!  I prefer more of a cake-like texture than a fudgey one, and these fit the bill.  Because I like a deeper chocolate flavor, I melted 1 square of semi-sweet chocolate with the butter. Since I don't have a double boiler, I melted them in a small saucepan placed in a larger pan filled with boiling water. I then made the recipe as written. They disappeared quickly.  Next time, I may try melting 2 squares of chocolate with the butter -- perhaps unsweetened this time, to see how it enhances the chocolate flavor.

This is my favorite recipe. I have been making it for over thirty years. I use all-purpose flour. Instead of cocoa, I melt two unsweetened (1-oz. each) chocolate squares, with the 1/2 cup butter/margarine. At Christmas, use peppermint extract, instead of vanilla extract....Frost...Great for gift giving. Make sure to attach a recipe card....They always ask for the recipe.

A couple weeks ago I tried this recipe, and the brownies turned out alright. The reason I chose this recipe initially is because I accidentally ended up with self-rising flour, and I wanted to bake brownies. The texture did turn out cake-like which was good. I don't feel like it was rich enough, though, but that could have been my second (possibly third) rate chocolate powder. Usually when I bake brownies I prefer to melt chocolate squares or chocolate chips. If you have a chocolate powder you like then this recipe might turn out better for you. I didn't feel they turned out great, but they weren't bad.
I tried the same recipe last week, and they turned out so much better. They disappeared much more quickly than the ones the week before. For some reason these brownies turned out more dense which I felt made them richer. I think I might have not followed the recipe exactly initially because these ones turned out sweeter and richer and my roommate said it was because of the vanilla.  I don't have a proper measuring spoon, and I think the one I used the first time was smaller than a teaspoon. So I initially rated these brownies 3 stars, but after the second batch (even with low quality chocolate) I give these brownies 4 stars because the second batch turned out so delicious. Maybe with better chocolate, these brownies can get 5.

These are, without a doubt, the BEST brownies I've ever made from scratch. I only had all purpose flour but I think that just made them better. Crispy on top, soft and chewy inside. Absolutely perfect.

Tried these brownies last night. They were a big hit with the family. Very fudgy. I added about 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter. I will definately make these again.

these brownies were great! I made them yesterday and now they are pretty much gone :) I followed the recipe exactly except I changed the cocoa powder for about 1/3 cup of melted chocolate. Definitely will be making this recipe again!

I would say that these are good brownies.  I certainly didn't think they were the best and I certainly didn't think they were the worst.  They fell right in the middle for us.  I'd maybe make them again if I don't find anything better.

Yummy-yum-yum!  I agree with the reviewer who said to make a double batch (in a 9x13 pan)...you can never have too many brownies!  I cooked mine for about 23 minutes (like my brownies a little moist and gooey) and I always recommend using real butter instead of margarine in chocolate recipes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these brownies yesterday. My husband and I loved them. It is absolutely 'a piece of cake' to make these and ready in no time. So great for last minute guests. I did not have self-rising flour and added 1/8 tsp baking powder; and also I added pecans instead of walnuts. I cooked it for 30 minutes. We loved it either 'a la mode' or with a nice cup of coffee. Absolutely a keeper!!

These brownies are awesome! I add a quarter of a cup of hot fudge ice cream topping and a cup of chocolate chips to my batter and it is sooo yummy!

These are absolutely the best brownies I've had! I added pecans and that just made them better!! The second batch I made I omitted an egg for the boyfriend because he prefers a more consistent brownie which he requested more of! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!! =3

Incredibly easy and delcious. I cooked for 30 minutes and followed the recipe to a "T". Not the absolute best but definitely up there. And being just as easy, or maybe even easier than using a box, these deserve five stars. Thank you!

This is a wonderful and easy brownie recipe. My 4 year-old loves to help measure the ingredients and mix the batter! I usually reduce the amount of butter to 1/4 cup, and add 1/4 cup of apple sauce to the recipe. It it an easy way to reduce the fat and the brownies taste just as delicious!!! Thank you for submitting!

I really liked this recipe overall.  I doubled it to fit a 9x13 pan, but didn't double the sugar.  It was still sweet enough for me.  I also added walnuts and peanut butter chips.  Unfortunately, I didn't get that shiny crust that usually comes with boxed brownies - the top looked more cake-like.  Maybe I'll add an extra egg white next time.  However, I decided to make a quick peanut butter frosting with vanilla icing, peanut butter and a couple of tablespoons of milk.  It looked great and got lots of compliments!

Way too salty.  Self-rising flour already has salt in it, so why the extra salt?

These brownies are excellent.  They were extremely easy to make.  Next time I'll make a double batch.  They tasted exactly like I'd hoped for.  In fact, my 7 year old ate one and said he could eat the whole pan in one second.  He also said the only thing he loved more than these brownies was me!

These were good.  A bit cake like as other reviewers mentioned.   Made a second batch and used 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I added a heaping teaspoon of espresso powder and it was just what this recipe was missing.  The brownies were more chewy and had a richer chocolate flavor.

Wow! I think these were the first homemade brownies that had the texture of box-mix brownies with the taste of real chocolate! Of course, it doesn't hurt that my (chocaholic) daughter substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts!

For those of you who, like me, don't use self-rising flour or keep it on hand, for each cup of self-rising you can substitute 1 c. all-purpose flour, 1 1/4 t. baking powder, and 1/8 t. salt. (Either double the recipe or keep the other 1/2 cup on hand for the next batch.)

I substituted crisco butter flavored shortening for the butter.  I also quadrupled the reciepe.  I added dark choc chips as well.  I have a child who is lactose intolerant and allergic to nuts.  The shortening took these from good to AWESOME.  Much lighter yet they were fudgey as well.  They were dry with the butter as well.  The shortening also cuts the fat in half.

I made these brownies today about 20 mins. ago with the intention to send them with my husband for him and his co-workers to enjoy at work. As soon as they cooled down and I was able to cut them it was like a race to see how many I can put on the platter for his co-workers because he was just putting them away! :) lol he loved them and so did I. I will say that I did not use walnuts or the self rise flour BUT they came out DELICIOUS. So i can only imagine how much more yummy they would have been had I used the right ingredients. (I only had all purpose flour on hand but it did the trick!)  Thanks so much for the recipe o will definitely be using this recipe again and again ...now let's see what his co workers have to say :)

One of the BEST and WORST things about working from home is being able to throw brownies in the oven in less than ten minutes.  These were super simple to make and very yummy.  I can see adding all kinds of additions to this recipes such has toffee chips, butterscotch chips, etc.  Thanks for a super simple and fast recipe that is super yummy in the tummy!

I made it both ways, I did not have self rising flour but used the cheating way of using 1 cup of flour with 1/2 tsp of baking powder + 1/2 tsp of Salt.(I doubled the recipe to fill 13X9 pan)   It was better/softer/moister with the baking powder and salt.   Good both ways as well!

Although I haven't made this recipe, I do make almost the exact same one and the brownies come out fudgy and moist with that great shiny crackly top.  I double the ingredients (use 3/4 cup cocoa), replace the self-rising flour with all-purpose and 1/2 tsp baking powder, and use a 13x9 pan.  I add the vanilla with sugar to make it easier to incorporate and I add the eggs one at a time beating well after each.  This is actually the recipe that comes on the Hershey's Cocoa can and it's a guaranteed winner.  So if you prefer a fudgier brownie experience, try making them this way!!

These brownies were sooooooooo good! They were the best I have ever made and were quick and easy! Thanks Jenn 

I did not have any self riseing flour so I used all purpose and added 1 tsp of baking soda. They did not come out cake like b/c when they were rising I put a hole in the center and it fell. But they were still great!! Thanks.

These are cake brownies, not fudge-like at all.  I might convert this recipe into a chocolate cake instead. I prefer thick, fudge brownies ... the kind you choke on and these aren't it.  I didn't put walnuts inside, I'm glad I didn't because the brownies would be super dry.

There is nothing special about these brownies.  They're okay, but not the best I've had or made.  I would have liked to rate it a 2.5...  They are very easy to make and will satisfy young kids to a point...

I've tried many brownies recipes is this is by far my favorite. They come out moist and sweet and you just can't stop eating them. The only change I made was to replace the walnuts by choc chips. Thank you for this recipe!

My mom who doesn't generally like sweets couldn't stop eating these. They are very rich and almost taste like a chocolate torte. The thing she liked the most about them was that they were so fudgy and dense. They were very easy and quick. Bake them in a pie pan and turn upside down on a cake plate and dust with powered sugar and they look wonderful. I will be making these again. For those of you who are complaining about the dryness just make sure you bake them for EXACTLY the time specified, you WILL think that they are not done but once you let them set for ten minutes they are SOOOOOO moist. Fight your gut on this one and they will turn out wonderful.

I really like this recipe.  It is very easy to throw together with ingredients I already have on-hand, and the results are great.  I double this and use a 9x13 pan.  When I double it, I also use almost a full cup of cocoa and a tablespoon of instant coffee for a richer chocolate flavor.  I add anywhere between 1/2 to a full cup of chopped pecans.  These are great as a base for brownie sundaes too!

I made these last night and while they are absolutely easy to make, they weren't nearly as fudgy as the recipe I've used for the past 5 years which calls for unsweetened chocolate squares rather than cocoa powder.  I had a hard time thinking of these as brownies.  They were more like a snack cake.  I'm defintely going to try other recipes from the site though because I think homemade far outweighs any box mix and I'm looking to experiment for a little baking excitement.

This was a pretty good browine-fast and simple. I made it one night while the kids watched Lilo and Stitch :) We liked them. I will do this recipe again when I have a chocolate craving going, butI must admit I do like a fudgier type brownie--but great if you like a cake-like brownie :)

The texture of these brownies were too cake-like for my liking. I even used regular flour and added some chocolate syrup to make them more dense, but it didn't help much. The flavor was only okay, too.

I loved this recipe! It was incredibly simple. I used a light margarine, and cut the amount by half. I also used egg beaters as opposed to whole eggs, so that I could cut down on the fat. They came out perfect inspite of my changes. They were moist, chewy and my family loved them.

First time I ever made brownies from scratch. I doubled the recipe, opted for the walnuts and used a 9x13x2 Calphalon non-stick pan. In lieu of greasing and flouring the pan, I used waxed paper which appeared to have done the trick, no stick whatsoever, but I still wonder why I had to do that if the pan is of the non-stick variety? 

The only other variation  was I used self-rising flour, Dutch-processed Ghiradelli cocoa and after baking sprinkled a hefty portion of Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips on top, stuck the pan back in the oven for a minute, removed and spread the melted chips over the brownies. All equalled great brownies!

These came out pretty well! Not mind-blowing, but a lot better than most of the other highly-rated brownie recipes I've found on this site. These actually were kind of fudge-like. I added some chocolate chips and they came out well.

I just made these tonight and they were delicious.   I added some chocolate chips.   I also underbaked them by 5 minutes and they were just right.   Whipped them up in like 10 minutes.  Gotta try 'em!

I've given 5*s after trying this ABSOLUTELY BEST BROWNIES twice.  This is one of my tried and true recipes.  I feel it does not need a topping, as it has a hard top layer.  My first attempt itself this came out very well. I used all purpose flour and added little less than 1/2 Tspn. of B.powder. My husband and two childed loved this so much. Its so rich and yummy!  Thanks a lot Jenn for sharing this with us. Very quick and easy recipe.

These are the best brownies made from scratch.  They are moist, chocolaty, and delicious.  I will be cleaning my box of all other brownie recipes and will be replacing it with this one.  I changed only the flour, using all purpose.  Be sure to cool these completely or they'll seem undercooked.  I ate these warmed with pistahio ice cream.  Yummy.

The boys at my husband's workplace beg him almost daily to bring in more of these brownies! I first found this recipe to use up some self-rising flour, but feel they are even better with plain flour. They're quick and super-easy to make, and taste delicious! (Especially warm out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream!)

If you're wanting them a little more moist with a crunchy top, try making it with only one egg and a splash of milk.

These are the easiest, and most delicious brownies I have ever made! They weren't too cakey or too fudgy and the flavor was perfect! They have a slight crisp crust that gives way to moist decadence! Perfect midnight snack ;)

These brownies were wonderful.  They were the perfect balance between cake-like brownies and chewy brownies, and they had a wonderful flavour.  I omitted the walnuts, but I think they would be equally good with them.

My husband and I adore these brownies!  I have never before made a recipe that I like as much as boxed mix, but I'll never make a box again.  I used 1/4 cup stick margarine and 1/4 cup veg. oil instead of the 1/2 cup butter, plus I'm a little heavy-handed with the cocoa.  I threw in some chocolate chips and took out the walnuts.  We can never wait for them to cool before we *have* to dig in.  Yummy!

These had very good chocolate flavor. I added about 3-4 tablespoons more of cocoa powder just because I like super rich chocolate taste and added about 1 more tablespoon more of flour, but should have added at least three more becuase the batter was way too liquidy and I just knew the mixtue would not fully come together and it didn't.  After it completely cooled the "brownies"  were not solid they fell apart and it was kind of like chocolate bread pudding.  The flavor was great though, will make again, but with more flour.  P.S. if you want a great chocolate frosting, don't make brownies with this, just use the batter.  It had perfect consistency.  I forgot to add that I changed the quantity of this recipe to 24 instead of 12 and it was still way to small of an amount. I can't imagin making the recipe for 12 servings, there would be nothing there.  I would triple this next time, just to get an amount that adequate.

Thank you for this wonderful experience!  What's more, I used butter I made from the Homemade Butter recipe found on this site, and I really feel that it made my brownies that much richer and true to flavor!  Thanks Again!  *^_^*

These are so delicious! I used all purpose flour and following others recommendations, made 1 & 1/2 batch but I kept eggs & salt the same.  Also followed recommendation to use 1/2 butter & 1/2 oil but since I made 1&1/2 I used 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce instead of adding more oil/butter.  Also added mix of peanut butter and honey to the middle of batter (from peanut butter honey brownies recipe) - so glad I did but they do have a great chocolate taste even without.  Love that I can use organic ingredients & used organic cocao powder -- no more boxes for me! Husband says these are 10x better!! also, thanks for tip to mix chocolate chips in flour before adding so they don't sink - worked perfectly.  Brownies do crumble a little but think they'll set up fine overnight.  When they taste this good, nobody would really care anyway!

Love these brownies.  Only brownie recipe I've ever liked trying to make them from scratch.  HOWEVER....at least DOUBLE the recipe.  If you double the recipe in a 8x8 they are what I would consider normal brownie depth otherwise hardly even the depth of a 'bar'.

For the record, other than doubling the ingredients for a larger batch, and substiting regular flour for the self-rise (no addtional bp in hopes of a fudgy brownie). I only gave three stars because even though they were sweet and tasted good (cant go wrong with those ingredients!), they didn't taste like brownies, but like a flat chocolate cake. This was the first time trying to make brownies without a box... I will try a different recipe next time in hopes of finding a more fudgy brownie from scratch. Thanks for posting though!

These were soo good.  I was out of vanilla so used  a little less than 1 tsp of peppermint extract instead, as it can be a bit overpowering.  Rave reviews on this one.  Will make again.

Snowed in and out of key ingredients for my usual brownie recipe, I gave these a try. They are quite delicious! Very quick and easy to whip up, the kids liked them, not cloyingly sweet, and a great cake-y texture. Loved them. Will try the chewier version next time to see how it turns out, but overall very impressed. Kids loved them too!

Very good brownies!!  I usually double this recipe because they are so tasty they go very quickly.  I don't make them with the nuts.  Not overly sweet and cut nicely.

These were so amazing!  I used all-purpose flour since I prefer my brownies to be less cake-like and they really did turn out perfectly!  The recipe was so simple and quick to put together, and it used very common ingredients so I didn't even need to go to the store to buy more ingredients.  They came out of the oven so moist and chewy with that perfect brownie crispy top.... mmm... delicious.  My friends and I could not wait to eat them ^.~  We grabbed them out of the pan while they were still quite warm and devoured them quickly.  They really were great brownies!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!! This recipe is most certainly a keeper (actually I joined the site so I could rate this :P )!

These were nice!  A little too cakey for me, but the taste was nice.  Next time I'll increase the cocoa powder for a little extra chocolate wow.  I missed the distinctive brownie crakle top though.

These are delicious brownies.  The only thing I did differently was to take the advice of a few other bakers and use regular flour instead of self rising.  I love soft chewy brownies, and these are the ones.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the other's advice and mixed in baking powder and salt in with my flour and they came out really good, although it was really cake-like.  In fact, it was more cake-like then most cake like brownies I have tried.  I wouldn't call these brownies.  I would rename them chocolate cake bars.

I just wanted to say that I first reviewed this recipe 8 years ago and it's now become something I make every Super Bowl. I find using a good cocoa powder really makes the difference - I usually use Ghiardelli. My friends look forward to them every year. I've also since gotten married and my husband requests these on a regular basis. Thank you for giving me a lasting recipe to add to my rotation! 


These were delicious and gobbled up at a super bowl party I went to! I used the 1/2 cup flour/1/2 tsp baking powder/1/2 tsp salt combination since I did not have self-rising flour. I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 inch pan, baked for 25 minutes. Came out perfect! Thanks!!

Used all purpose flour with some baking powder. Also left out the walnuts because the kids don't like nuts. I was expecting a lot more out of these and didn't think they were that fantastic. They were dry and I thought they could have used more chocolate flavor. I am giving them a four because my husband liked them.

I didn't have self rising flour so I used cake flour and 1 teaspoon of vanilla flavoured baking powder. I read a few reviews saying that they could use more chocolate so I added a fistful of mini chips. They really came out great. I will use this recipe again. Thanks.

Not sure about the use of self-rising flour and the amount. My brownie seemed to not have enough flour - it rises too much and has a very moist texture. When I took it out of the oven and poked it, you could say that it was like chocolate mousse. Better off with all-purpose flour and 3/4 - 1 cup amount.

These are absolutely the best. I baked the batch for 20 minutes once the surface began grow crusty and crack, it led to a cakey, yet fudgey brownie. No one bothered eating the Brownies sticking to the side of the pan since the middle is always the best part. Add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder if you prefer cakier brownies. These were amazing

These were really easy to make, and my Starbucks coworkers loved them! I made them quickly in the pan I melted the butter in, and I used a mix of half regular cocoa powder and half dark cocoa powder. I also added 1 packet of Starbucks Italian Via, and chocolate chunks. The via adds just a little something to all chocolate things, and none of my coworkers believed me when I told them it was a special ingredient! One coworker said "These are the best brownies I've ever had" and they were gone within 4 hours at work!

Excellent recipe!!  I was in a pinch and needed to make a last minute dessert to take along to a July 4th party.  I had all ingredients on-hand so I decided to give this recipe a try.....I'm so glad I did!  Brownies had a rich chocolate flavor, and a true 'brownie' texture, not cake like at all.  The brownies were the hit of the party and were the first thing to go.  Had 3 people ask me to go home and bake a second batch!  I used regular flour instead of self-rising, only because it's what I had in the house, and omitted the nuts.  Added a layer of homemade cream cheese icing & decorated to look like the American Flag.  This will be my go to brownie recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Was scramblin to find a desert for a meal with my sons families- had ice cream but wanted something else.  Decided to make some brownies to serve warm with ice cream on top- thes were so easy and good with ingredients I always have on hand -makes it ridiculous to ever buy box mix.  Would definitely need to double for a 9x13 pan.  Glass pie plate worked perfect for a small batch like I needed- just cut in wedges topped with the ice cream. Gkids don't like nuts in brownies so I served chopped nuts on the side as a topping

Wonderful!! I was looking for a recipe to use up some self-rising flour, and to use flax meal as an egg substitute. I used a little less sugar (3/4C) and replaced one of the eggs with flax meal/water. The batter was tasty, and I had to cut into them as soon as they were cooled enough. They are so good!! A great quick and easy brownie recipe!

These are very good brownies...a little too cake like for me.  I doubled the recipe and used regular flour, I think I should have used 1 less egg (3 instead of 4).  I also used mini muffin pans for bite sized brownies.  All in all they're good =)

I've never made brownies from scratch before until I found this recipe. They are truely the very best!!! My family did a comparision to the Betty Crocker  brownie mix and my kids liked the homemade ones far better.  I did not have self rising flour on hand, so I used all purpose flour and they were fabulous.  If you're looking for a brownie recipe this is the one you don't want to miss.  I'll never make boxed again!!

I tried this recipe for a work function. It was very quick and easy. I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 inch pan, as I see some other reviewers also did. The brownies were very good and not dry at all. The only issue I had was that the bottom of my brownies were not flat. The walnuts made up the bottom, which made it a little weird when holding a brownie to eat it. Next time, I think I will chop up the walnuts a little smaller. Overall, this was a good recipe. I don't know if I would go so far as to say that these were the best brownies I've ever had, but they were definitely good. I got a lot of compliments at work, so I will definitely use this recipe again!

This was a great recipe after upping cocoa till it was half the amount of sugar (I like a very dark brownie!). However, I baked it in an 8x8 pan and it seemed like it was not a good size for the brownie. For an 8x8, I would need to multiply the portions by 1.5. it was quite an ugly sight, trying to flatten the batter out into a pan too large. But great recipe!!!

Shockingly good!   I only made them because I had limited ingredients in  the house, and I expected them to be disappointing...but they were GRRREAT! I did not add any extra liquid even though the batter was more like dough.  I did add extra walnuts

Made these the other night while having a chocolate craving, didn't want a big batch so I chose these.  I was out of butter so I used butter flavored Crisco.  Mine turned out fudgy, with that nice crisp top.  Very yummy!

This the best scratch brownie recipe I I have found yet.  Just not quite rich enough for me.  I just havent been able to find a real rich, chewy, fudgy, brownie recipe and I cant bring myself to by boxed brownies.

I can't really call this a brownie--it's really more like a cake. That being said, nice little cake! Very easy, turned out moist. I like that it makes a small amount. Would be great with whipped cream or a chocolate frosting. I added a tsp. of espresso powder and substituted loosely packed brown sugar for the white sugar.

Very Very Good. I'm not one to leave a good recipe alone so I added my own touch. I doubled the recipe and use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup veg oil, all purpose flour, 1 TBLS of instant coffee, and 1 cup of choc chips to all the other ingredients. Even though I liked the original very much these aren't to shabby either.

This is a great recipe.  Super easy to make, and very tastey.  I made it with my gluten free flour mix and they turned out great!  (I figured the recipe would work well since it only calls for 1/2 cup flour.)  I also added white and milk chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  Delicious!!  
I've also made this as a gift - put all the dry ingredients in a jar with a note to have the recipient add the butter, eggs, and vanilla and mix well before baking.

These turned out good. I don't think they tasted any better then a box mix, but at least I know what the ingredients are in the homemade version. I would use this recipe again, but I will continue searching for the perfect one.

Very good - nice and dense with the all purpose flour. Maybe it's taboo to say it - aw hell: you might as well go with a Duncan Hines mix!

I baked these with self rising flour and then put in chocolate chips.  They are more cake like than my hubby likes but they are good.  Will try again with all purpose flour.  Just eats more like a cake

I am a firm believer that homemade is always better, but I have yet to discover brownies that I like better than my favorite boxed mix. I tried a million brownie recipes from this site and others to try to find one that I liked better than my favorite boxed recipe. This recipe is the best of the ones that I have tried so far. If I frost them they are my favorite ever, but if eaten without frosting they still don't have that tasty crusty top that boxed mixes have. But super tasty anyways!

Really good.  Tried it with both self-rising flour and regular (flatter, more chewey).  Great either way.  Excellent with white chocolate chips and self rising flour.

Mmmm... these are wonderful. I had a craving for brownies, but didn't have any baking chocolate, but rather cocoa powder. I found these and they were a great success. I used all-purpose flour and they turned out perfect since I prefer more of a fudge brownie than a cake-y brownie. I served them with powdered sugar on top and strawberries on the side. Perfect!

Given the ease at which these are made, they are fantastic!  They are not, however, the best brownies I have ever eaten.  If you are looking for a fast recipe that tastes great, use this.  I will definitely make again - great for a work night!

ABSOUTELY!  I may have made another rating "some other" brownie...but I take it back!  These have gotten RAVE reviews.  I double the recipe, use regular flour, substitute chocolate chips for the nuts and bake in a 13x9" pan for exactly 30 minutes.  Perfection.

Edited review: Once I tried these with self-rising flour, they were very good. They could still be a smidge sweeter for my taste, but they came out moist and fudgy, like brownies should be.

Maybe i made a mistake in baking these brownies... i thought i followed the recipe exactly but these were not the best brownies at all. Dry and overly cakey. I will not be making this one again.

This is an update to my first review.  I did not use self rising flour the first few times we made these, however, this time I used part all purpose and part self rising and they were MUCH better this way!  Love these, they are our only brownies now!

definately an easy "chocolate" fix.  Doubled the recipe as suggested by someone else and used a 9x13 pan.  For a little extra kick I added 3tbsp amaretto and 1 tsp pure almond flavouring.  MMMM good!  Rated this a 5 because they would have been a 5 without the extra flavour, but I like something a little different to take to pot lucks.  (nothing like 5 people taking brownies...  at least mine wont be the same as anyone elses!).

These have become a Christmas tradition.  I double the recipe--add the cream cheese mixture from "Cheescake Topped Brownies" and top with homemade chocolate buttercream frosting!  Absolutly sinful!!!

The flavor was good, but the texture was very strange for a brownie.  This is more like a fluffy/spongy cake than a brownie.  I added a little bit of instant coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor and some chocolate chips to up the ante.

Very Easy to make and was done in 1 bowl.  Not too sweet which is good.  I baked these for 18 minutes.  Pretty good but nothing extraordinary IMHO.

Yep, I rate these a 5 since they are very simple, fast and tasty brownies.  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet for me.  Double the recipe if you want two pans of brownies.

This recipe is just like its name 'absolutely best brownies'.  It's so simple and so easy to make.  During Christmas season, I have baked six batches of brownies with this recipe and the consistency of the result is always good...so tasty and so moist.  My husband is very picky about food, but he loved these brownies I made and gave it A+++.  For your information that I use all purpose flour for this recipe and normally bake it for 28 minutes even if I double the recipe.  Thank you for sharing your perfect brownies recipe.

This is the first time I have made brownies from scratch.  Wow was it easy.  I just made them and my 11yr old came in and said these are great mom! I snarfed that down is there more?  She is taking a quad batch to school tomorrow as a treat after a pizza party.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been looking for this cocoa brownie recipe for a long time-I used to make these from a recipe on the can, but havent found one since. My friend with 3 children wanted a good recipe that's easy like this, and she started making them for her kids.The recipe i had used regular flour, so i was so excited to make these (i dont use self-rising)i forgot to add baking powder til i put them in the pan--i added it anyway and stirred in the pan.So,that was my fault,but i'm sure they'll come out great-i just peeked in the oven & they look good!

Absolutely delicious!!!I doubled this on two different occasions now, and was VERY happy each time. The first time I didn't include nuts, the second time I included sliced almonds, chocolate frosting and caramel. Its VERY rich that way, probably too much so for most, but absolutely heavenly! But, just by themselves these are gorgeous brownies by far. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about them both times! I have stocked my shelves with ingredients, haha!

I must had done something wrong. It was crumbly and I read one message left from someone that said she would make the cocoa 3/4 cup and wow was that too much cocoa for me! But it still had a good taste just couldn't get it to stay together.

Although these brownies were a great quick light treat, they weren't soo choclatey, I did without the walnuts and I found that the cooking time was closer to 20 minutes than 25. I also used an 8 by 8 which was too big even though that was the smaller of the reccomended pans.

I really liked these brownies.  The second time I made them I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 inch pan.  This made the brownie a little thicker and I liked it better.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe using half all-purpose flour and half self-rising flour and a 9x13 pan and they came out great, slightly cake like yet still moist and fudgy. I will most certainly make these again

Turned out soft and yummy, and very easy to make!  The only complaint I'd make is that they're not aesthetically appealing -I've been trying to find a brownie recipe that comes out shiny and crackly on top.

This recipe definitely needs the self rising flour.
The side note about how you can use regular flour for less cake like brownies was not helpful unless you want flat brownies.
Also, this recipe was too sweet. Less sugar would be better.

There are two other recipes on AR for these exact same brownies! How funny is that? Proof they're truly the best brownies no matter what they are called -- everyone everywhere is submitting the recipe and getting 5 stars all over the place. You won't be disappointed in this recipe! Thanks for submitting. The other two recipes are called Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies and Best Brownies. For the Absolutely Best Brownies, it is the same recipe if you use regular flour rather than self-rising (as submitter suggests if you want less cake-like brownies) which I did. No matter which of these three recipes you follow, it is so easy to make them and they are simply scrumptious. I did not use a mixer, I simply stirred the ingredients. I did not add nuts. I baked them in an 8x8 pan and cut them into small squares. I wouldn't change anything. The Best Brownies Recipe includes a recipe for frosting. I did not make frosting -- I will another time, but honestly the recipe does not need it in order to be divine.

Excellent just as written for perfect brownies. I made a double batch and baked in a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes to get 16 brownies. Perfect with all purpose flour (& no other changes) as well as self-rising. Thanks for a good, reliable recipe!

Absolutely fantastic recipe - quick, easy, and DECADENT! I heartily recommend using all-purpose rather than self-rising flour for a true brownie texture. Sprinkling semi-sweet chocolate chips on top immediately prior to baking added extra richness. Take ten minutes out of your day and mix up these ingredients... moist, dense, chocolatey goodness awaits you!

Really sugary, I added reeses pb cups, but the cooking times didn't work with how I baked it. I 4x the recipe because I was trying to make it to give away as gifts, but it was SO gooey that they were barely cuttable. I may try again. We'll see.

Super easy and great tasting brownies!  I substituted AP flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder and an extra 1/4 tsp of salt, then used two mini-muffin pans (24 mini-brownies) and baked for 15 minutes.  After they cooled completely, their texture was soft and fudgy on the inside, crisp and chewy on the outside.  Delicious!

These were the BEST brownies I've made by far! I've never made brownies from scratch before and these turned out AWESOME! I highly recommend DOUBLING the recipe as well as the TIME for thicker brownies, but that's a personal preference because I don't like thin brownies.

It'll take about an hour if you double the batch but it's TOTALLY worth the wait! If you have two pans then I'd make a double-double batch if that makes sense? 

Basically double the recipe in each pan, so once you bake them you'll take both of them out of the oven at the same time and you'll have 2 batches of brownies instead of just one. Hope my review helped and ENJOY! =)

These were very good and will be easy enough for the kids to make.  My only complaint is that they took about an hour to bake! I always set the timer for the earliest suggested time and then check it every few minutes after that.  Seriously, they took an hour. I've never had that problem with any other recipe, so pretty sure it's not my oven. They are delicious, though!

These were great! I know there will always be a bad review somewhere in the list, and that always makes me nervous, but these were great. All I did extra was add a generous squirt of chocolate syrup and a handful of marshmallows! Fudgy and Fabulous!

These are great!So fast and easy!! I've made them as listed w/ a.p. flour. Then again w/ self rising,using veg oil instead of butter, (added butter flavor extract 1/2 tsp) 1 c. choc chips and the nuts.They turned out moister and less cake like. Oil, and the additional chocolate made the differrence more than self rising vs a.p. I think. Try these!

I thought these brownies were pretty good. I didn't use any nuts because we didn't have any on hand, but I will make them again using nuts or chocolate chips. They are a bit plain for my taste. My mom, on the other hand, said they may be the best homemade brownies she's ever had. They were a bit dry for me. I may prefer using all-purpose flour. I will also do that next time. But I served them with vanilla ice cream, and that made them just right in terms of moistness. I give it five stars because the flavor was good, and these were SUPER easy to make! Everything I already had on hand, and, being a beginner cook, I love easy! Overall a very good, very simple, quick recipe that I will play around with in the future.

I chose the 24 Serving: I used 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 and replaced the 2nd cup of sugar with 1/4 cup STEVIA (natural sweetner)I love sugar but not overwhelmingly sweet stuff.  1/2 of the nuts I chopped pretty well, and the other 1/2 chopped.  Plus 1 tbl. rum for my own kicks.  I couldn't stop eating the batter.  YUMMM.  but I did get to cook most of it though and I thought it was great and added more powder sugar for added sweetness but enjoyed the brownie without it being sooo sweet.  Great! (I never give out 5 stars if I make it, if someone else did I may, not sure :)

Great recipe - I have my usual favorite brownie recipe which involves about 7 eggs and a LOT of chocolate, but we had no normal flour so I googled 'self rising flour brownie recipe' and found this. SO easy to make, took less than 5 minutes. I improvised by adding in chocolate chips, which made them more gooey, and doubled the recipe. Will probably quadruple it next time - my 3 male flatmates ate them all in less than 24 hours!

I am so pleased that I chose this brownie recipe! These are really good, rich chocolately brownies that aren't too heavy, or too cakey. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and 30 minutes in a 350 degree over worked perfectly. I did make a simple chocolate icing recipe I have and put on them and that just sent these brownies into orbit! If your hesitant about making these, don't be! Just follow the steps and you'll have one very delicious brownie as your end result! FYI I didn't have any nuts to put in them so made them plain and they were just as good without them.

These brownies were great.  I made them with my 5 year old son.  I am a terrible baker and these came out just right.  Mine didn't look like the photo, but they still are good!

These Brownies are awesome. They are very easy and they taste amazing. I have made quite a few batches and they always turn out well. I have made some adaptations as well, one very nice with peanut butter. I melted the peanut butter and made a marble design on the top and it was a nice compliment.

I thought these were just average.  Not nearly sweet or chocolatey enough for me so I frosted them with chocolate frosting.

This recipe is almost exactly the same as the one for "Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies" on this site. The only difference is that the vanilla is added at a different time. The "Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies" recipe suggests using butter in the description instead of oil; "self-rising flour" used in this ABB recipe is equal to the flour plus baking soda and salt used in the MMBB recipe. I'm very skeptical that this is an original. That said, the brownies do taste good. I like to cut the sugar by a 1/4 cup, b/c it is very sweet; I also add 1 TBSP ground golden flax seed meal to the dry ingredients to give the brownies a nice texture with a healthy bonus (omega-3s).

Used all purpose flour instead of self rising and added 1/4 tsp baking powder. The brownies didn't really seem to rise at all so I'm guessing the flour makes a big difference. Definately tasted good but would make a double or triple batch so they're not so flat next time. Also topped with chocolate icing and crushed walnuts. mmmm

Good brownies. Chewy edges and moist fudgy middles. Easy to prepare and fast too. I made these for hubby's birthday and he loved them. I left out the nuts. Thanks countrydayz, my husband said they were "awesome". They must be good as they've already eaten half the pan and I just took them out of the oven less than an hour ago!

My husband really liked these, but I would have preferred them to be much chocolatier. I've never made brownies from scratch before, so I didn't realise there wasn't as much chocolate as I'd have liked.

I didn't have enough cocoa powder on hand, so I melted 3 Baker's semi-sweet chocolate squares and added that to the wet ingredients. They turned out great, although they're more cake like than gooey/fudgy brownies.

These brownies were so easy to make, I doubled the recipe because I had a bigger pan to bake in. My only mistake was adding too much butter, they came out a little greasy, but they were so tasty! I also added a crushed up chocolate bar for extra chocolate flavour. My hubby who isn't a huge fan of chocolate even loved them.

I'm not a huge brownie fan, but I liked these more than most - not too sweet, not too dry, just plain good. Made them for a birthday party, served them warm with vanilla ice cream and they disappeared.

First time making it from scratch.  I reduce the sugar by 20 gram and still find too sweet for my liking.  And I do prefer the gooey texture so need to bake it under 25 mins. Overall, still delicious but need to adjust the amount of the ingredients to mine liking.

Great recipe!  Simple, easy, FAST, and the perfect mix between cake-y and fudge-y.  Not too rich, not too sweet (even for my Indian fiance, who is very sensitive to these American overly-sweet desserts). 

I used the 1/2c flour, 1/4tsp baking powder, 1/4tsp salt mixutre instead of the self-rising flour (as another reviewer suggested).

Fantastic- this is the recipe I will be using from now on.

They had nice flavor, but they became rather dry and crumbly the next day.

This brownies recipe never fails! In fact, this is the only brownies which the family gobble up like mad. I've tried other nuts in it but personally I like the walnuts.

My son is allergic to chocolate so I was looking for a brownie recipe with cocoa in it. Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. My 2 and 4 year old now think it is the best food ever. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is amazing, and whenever I make these brownies, I double the recipe and they are still gone within hours. I do make a few changes, leaving out the walnuts and using all purpose flour instead of self-rising flour. Thanks for sharing jenn!!!

I didn't have any walnuts, so I made them without and they were still delicious!  I brought them to work and they were gone in a flash.  I recommend you make these on a Sunday and bring them to the office Monday morning.  They are too tempting to keep at home!

Super easy to make and turned out looking yummy in an 8x8 pan.  The taste was a little too buttery, and I followed the recipe exactly.  Nevertheless, they were pretty good brownies.

I made these with margarine and all-purpose flour because that’s what I had on hand, and I thought they were delicious.  My teenager prefers a fudgier brownie, however.

Always tried to make brownies - they've never worked!  This is definitely a working recipe that is yum. My 2 y.o. also doesn't eat cakey things and wanted 'more please mummy'!  Kids are always the best judge of a good thing!

Very nice.... next time, I will double the recipe as
others have suggested, because I don't have an 
8 x 8 pan, just 9 x 13.   I spread it over 3/4 of my 
9 x 13, and the batter leaked to the ends.  Thin
brownies, but tasty anyway!

Made a very thick batter that wasn't pourable at all, but that was okay.  I spread it out as best I could and then the heat of the oven melted it into the corners and edges and smoothed it out nicely.  Very, very easy to make.  Definately something the kids could do.  I didn't mark it "the best" overall, but that is because I am still trying out brownie recipes, and can't declare one to be tops yet.  ;-)  I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN, HOWEVER!

Fabulous brownies! I doubled the batch and took it to our employment family meeting--they were eaten all up quickly! My husband thought they were the best he's ever had--and he's a hard palate to please. Thanks so much for the recipe. Very quick and easy to make too.

Could anyone tell me why these brownies came out for a soggy mess? The recipe called for spreading evenly and I knew this wasn't going to happen when it poured like milk into the pan. I had to bake it at almost an hour to get it to point of looking done. My kids were not declaring these the best.

I am never going to buy a box brownie mix again! These were super simple and I had all the ingredients already in the house. Mine came out moist and delicious. I doubled the recipe so I could use my 10 x 14 glass baking dish. I think my co-workers are going to love this recipe.

Great chocolate taste.  I used all purpose flour but failed to measure the baking powder,  probably used too little, so they were flatter than I would have liked, but still very good.

I love this recipe. I do tweak it just a bit and add a little almond extract with the vanilla about half and half. It makes it taste a little bit of cherries. ( I personally love the taste of cherries and chocolate) they came out so delicious.

These brownies DO NOT disappoint! I have made them several times over the years. My oven requires a little more cooking time, but that's normal ;)

I followed the recipe, omitting the nuts, and love these brownies. They are relatively easy to make, my 9 year old helped, and most will have all the ingredients already on hand. I will definitely make them again.

Very Good. Brownies are my Achilles heel. So finding this recipe has saved me. Based on other reviews, i took their advice. Don't use SRFlour, use AP instead. Bake for 20 min. Check after 10 then 20min. Mine were perfect.

My boyfriend and I are addicted to these brownies. They are absolutely the best homemade brownie recipe I've ever found. I use all-purpose flour with 1 teaspoon baking powder for a *double batch* of the recipe. I have 2 suggestions: 1) toast the walnuts in a pan on the stove and add them. Really adds a nice dimension to the recipe. And 2) When you add the dry ingredients to the moist, do it gradually and mix it in well with a spoon before using the mixer at the end. Otherwise, you'll probably end up with a cocoa cyclone and have a lot to clean up. When I make the double batch in a 9 x 13 pan, it always takes the entire 30 minutes, but they come out perfect! Fudgy! You won't regret making this! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Very good brownie and super easy to make!  I used all-purpose flour and added chocolate chips to the top before baking.  Baked for exactly 25 mins and it was perfect. This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious, quick and easy brownies. I usually make brownies with unsweetened chocolate squares but I didn’t have any. Was looking for an easy recipe using cocoa powder when I decided to give this recipe a try.. I didn’t have self-rising flour so I added baking powder and salt to all-purpose flour. Brownies were in between cake and fudgey.

It was delicious, but it was too much like a cake for my me and my mom. The note on the recipe says, for less of a cake brownies, use all purpose flour. I don't have any other flour in my house :). Other than the texture, the brownies were delicious!

They taste yummy,but something went wrong. I think I kept checking too much,I didn't want to overbake.. but then it sank a lot in middle. Then finally after taking out,they seem too fudgy. The time was good,just I think I ought to be more careful not to open oven too much. I won't be defeated, always another go is worth it. I was aiming for a cakey brownie.

Very delicious brownies!  The only thing I added was M&Ms since I didn't use nuts.  There was no need for me to add anything else that others suggested or modify the amounts given.  I let the brownies cook for 27 minutes.

WOW!!!! The most delicious brownies I have ever had! I guarantee I will be making them again! My only advice is to add a tablespoon or two of milk to thin the batter because it is a little thicker than what I had in mind. Thanks SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The only changes I made were 1) following another reviewer's suggestion and whisking everything together in the pot used to melt the butter, and 2) adding a handful of chocolate chips just before pouring into the baking pan. While I suspect not beating the sugar and butter together may change the texture a little, this wasn't a problem for me. They were a little more cakey than fudgy, but definitely more like a brownie than a cake. I did double the recipe and bake in an 11x13 rectangular pan, and had a bit of trouble telling when they were done - my edges were a little too done, especially on my first batch. Overall, I liked them, thought the chocolate flavor from using cocoa powder (instead of bakers chocolate like some recipes use) was really good, was happy with how easily these came together using only 1 pot to melt/mix and 1 small bowl to weigh dry ingredients, and would make again.

I love this. I did have to change it a little. This was the second time I made it. I added a little veggie oil cuz the first time I made it ... it was a little dry. I also added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract. It gave it a little more wow factor. Love it!!!

My family prefers a fudgy brownie, so I used all-purpose flour with no other substitutions. This is not a recipe I'll be keeping; I'd give it 3.5 stars if possible. Taste was wonderful - buttery, chocolatey, yum. However, the texture was... odd. Moist, yes, but spongy rather than cakelike or fudgy. I've been baking for some time, and I know I didn't overmix or undermeasure, or otherwise mess up the recipe or technique. Not sure what the deal was, but I'll look elsewhere for THE best brownie recipe.

I didn't have self rising flour on hand so I followed the suggestions to use all purpose flour and a 1/4 tsp of baking powder.  I also didn't have walnuts so I used pecans. Absolutely amazing.  I am keeping this one and hope to make it as directed soon!

easy recipe! I don't like using the box mix so this works perfectly! I ran out of cocoa powder so I had to use some chocolate chips but they still came out moist in the center and crispy on the edges.

Usually I have to undertake posted times for baked goods (and my oven is calibrated correctly). This recipe, cooked for  ~24 mins was perfect--dense and fudgy, but held together. They also cut beautifully. I used Perignotti cocoa and added Ghiradelli choc. chips. Awesome. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it as written the 1st batch... liked them just fine. Added 1/3 cup of oil liked them even better. I cut the sugar by a third and added a peppermint frosting for the holidays. YES!, I will make these again

Very, very moist and SO good.  Added Notes from Ali:  This is a great recipe! I either double the recipe and use a 9 x 13 pan or quadruple the recipe and use an 11 x 17 pan. To make this easy recipe even easier, I just melt the butter on the stove in a big saucepan, take it off the heat, and dump in all the other ingredients, mix with a whisk, and pour it in the pan. It takes me like 5 minutes to make these when I do it this way. Since these brownies get a "film" on the top of them when they bake, it's best not to frost these. They are so rich anyways, they don't need frosting. Instead I just add chocolate chips, toffee pieces, nuts, or whatever else right into the batter. I have also added instant coffee powder, rum, and butterscotch sauce. Everytime I make them, they turn out so good and are so easy. Thanks for the recipe!

Made exactly as the recipe stated.  Great taste although a bit crumbly but I believe that was the result of overcooking them.  I would make this recipe again.

Perfection! These were exactly the kind of brownies I was looking for - not so fudgy or gooey. I bought one of those pans that make mini brownies, so the whole thing gets evenly done throughout. My youngest grandson loved them. Next time I think I will decrease the sugar to three-fourths cup; I don't have much of a sweet tooth.

I don't know what went wrong with mine, the only change I made was adding a little bit more vanilla essence because i didn't have vanilla extract. It rose a bit but stuck to the sides and now after I let it cool, it's hard :(

It was yummy!! I loved how the mixture was that traditional brownie taste, but still had a little bit of that fudge-like taste. I only changed one thing. The walnuts, since my brother is allergic, I used chocolate chips instead. That made it turn out goo-y too.

Yummy! I did what others recommend--doubled the recipe and poured into a 9x13 dish. The end product is a soft and (not overly) sweet brownie with a crispy top. My go to from now on!

Simple to make.  I doubled the recipe, used all purpose flour and like all brownies I bake, I added chocolate chips.  I'm glad I added the chips because these brownies were light (in color and texture) and lacking in chocolate flavor.  I used a top quality cocoa so not sure what went wrong.  I won't make them again.

This is a really good brownie recipe and couldn't be easier! I gave this 4 stars because this was more of a cake like texture, whereas I like a fudgier brownie. Nothing wrong with the flavor at all and I will keep this recipe on hand for a quick homemade brownie!

This is the best brownie recipe I've seen so far, I'm surprised it's so easy to make! It isn't disgustingly sweet and you really don't need a glaze/frosting for it. However I did follow the other reviewers' suggestions and used ap flour + 1/4 tsp of baking powder. I'll be sticking to this recipe from now on.

I tried this recipe this morning, it was fantastic as given! Added eggs (one at a time, beating after each addition, seems to be  a no-brainer there) and a splash of Jameson whiskey in the batter, cooked for 27 minutes, added 4 minutes when the cake seemed 'runny', cooled and they were perfect. Thank for a great recipe! Will do this one again.

I think that this recipe was amazing but if you want a sweeter and sponge like brownies I recommend putting milk in the mix at the end until you think the flavour is right. Regardless this was a great recipe.

Chocolate heavenliness! I quadrupled the recipe as Ali suggested and baked it in a 11x17 for about 45 minutes.  I didn't have self-rising flour so I used a recipe off of allrecipes.com.  It did overflow the pan a bit doing this and I'm not sure if there's a good way of changing the recipe so it wouldn't do that.

Everyone including myself loves this brownie recipe. I always double it and bake in a 9×13 pan. Sometimes add walnuts, or peanut butter chips,  and have also made cheesecake brownies as well. They come out very moist and cake like if you follow the instructions of  whisking the butter and sugar together first until it's a creamy consistency. I like to seperate the egg whites and whip till they form peaks, mix the egg yolks and vanilla into the butter mixture before adding to my  dry ingredients mixing completely . I then fold in my egg whites  combining it well. This makes them rise nicely . Great recipe that I use over and over

Great recipe! I am usually quite critical. The only thing I changed was using demerara sugar instead of white. I also made an icing but it really didn't need it! Soooooo great! Will definitely make again.

Easy and pretty good. More cakey like I like. Seemed a bit overly sweet but that may be because I use organic sugar and the crystals are bigger. I think I might try blending my sugar first next time to make it more fine, and then try again. Otherwise I might have to cut the sugar a bit.
I added walnuts and a few chocolate chips.

I made them but to be honest they took much longer to bake it was at least 45 minutes.

YUMMY BROWNIES. Make sure you add the baking powder (3/4 Tsp)  & salt (1/4 Tsp) to create "self rising" flour in ADDITION to recipe. I add walnuts chopped up small. Use ALL "REAL" ingredients like butter not margarine (never use margarine for baking). Takes about 35-40 minutes to bake. I recommend mixing dry ingredients separate from wet & then combine. Baking is a science. Don't short cut & watch the time (start checking  5 min before) Don't overbake. Moist & delicious!!

Great recipe as it is. I can't find self rising flour where I'm at, but all purpose works just fine. These come out consistently good. And they're easy and fast.

These are, by far, the best brownies I have ever tasted. It had a crunchy outside and a rich, moist, chocolaty inside. Like many others, I chose to devour them with whipped cream (others could use ice-cream) and strawberries.  These are super easy to make, so if you ever run short you can whip up some more. Another thing I would do is I would butter the pan I am baking in before it goes into the oven. Also, I would butter it after the brownies come out. Try and eat them whilst they still are fresh out of the oven!!!

This wasn't a brownie but this was very very good and moist I will definitely be making this one over and over. I scaled this down to 6 serving I should not have done that it didn't make enough.

I used regular flour instead of rising flour. But these were simple and delicious! I think these were better and just as easy as a box version of brownies. They stayed perfectly moist but we're gone in two days.

These are pretty awesome brownies!  I love them as is, but next time may decrease sugar a tiny bit and add slightly more cocoa powder, just for my own preference.

I never make brownies. I wanted something chocolatey tonight. I looked up brownies from scratch and this recipe popped up first on the list and looked good and easy.  I had all of the ingredients.  I have to say, I just had one warm out of the oven and freshly frosted. ..so delicious, so easy to make.  My husband and I each had two ...truth be told. Yes, I would definitely bake these again.   They were rich, yummy, and moist. I baked in a glass pan, 25 degrees lower for 30 minutes. I skipped the honey in the frosting and used milk instead.

Will definitely make again.  My wife does not like cake type brownies and has had me searching for the perfect fudgy, moist brownie.  This is the one!  I used all purpose flour instead of self rising and made sure to mix everything by hand as you don't want to incorporate too much air in your eggs nor over mix the batter for a nice moist brownie.  Perfect!!  I made 1 and a 1/2 times the recipe and baked in a 8 1/2 X 12 glass pan.

I love the heck out of this recipe! I use it to make my now famous S'mores brownies, and not a single person who has tried them didn't like them! I brought them to my company Christmas party last year, and they were requested again this year! Definitely the best I've ever had

This is my mother's brownie recipe, which I had lost from the note card she gave me.  I tried it with all-purpose flour, then with self-rising flour.  The ones with all-purpose can be eaten bachelor-style without making a mess.  The ones with self-rising require a fork, or at least a plate.  I bake these in the wee hours when insomnia strikes and still don't set off the smoke alarms. The recipe is that simple.  Enjoy!

Super easy to make - easy and better tasting than any box mix.  I top with powdered sugar after I pull them out of the oven.  I always have these ingredients on hand, so it's a quick, anytime dessert to make.

I doubled the recipe and the only modification I made to the recipe was using half coconut oil and half butter, and I added 1/2 tsp. baking powder as I didn't have self rising flour. I wish I hadn't added the baking powder as I prefer them a bit more moist and chewy.  My fault as it did say to use regular flour and I should have just done that! Anyway, the flavor is very good, and I'll definitely try it again without the baking powder this time!

All in all it was pretty a pretty good recipe, I took some liberties with it because as I was following the recipe, I realized the texture of the batter was a little off and it needed more flavor. I pretty much out double the cocoa powder that it calls for, I added some fresh vanilla bean, a little siagon cinnamon, and a little bit more salt. They turned out really well.

This didn't quite work for me. Following the submitter's advice and not wanting cake-like brownies, I didn't use self rising flour. They were still more like cake than brownies and dry ones at that. I can't see myself making this again but thanks for sharing. :o)

Perfect texture. Throwing some stale mini marshmallows and chocolate baking chips was a good idea. Doesn't stick to the glass pan edges. Bottom didn't burn.

I made the recipe exactly as listed. These are definitely cake like & not fudgy. They are good as is. 2nd batch: I doubled the recipe & added 1 bar of unsweetened bakers chocolate to melt with the butter. Baked in a 9x13.25 glass casserole dish, greased with butter & cocoa powder instead of flour, for 28 mins. They're about an inch thick, rich without being overly sweet, & moist.

These were insane and disappeared almost instantly...and almost as easy as using boxed brownie mix!  Fantastic!  I also added a teaspoon of instant coffee to amp up the flavor and stirred in about a half cup of chocolate chips.

Made these into little graves with marshmallow headstones for Halloween. I enjoyed these save for not being able to get the same texture from the outside to the middle. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I've been making this for school bake sales all year, and they have sold out every time. They are great baked in muffin tins for birthdays, or just as a little treat.

These were great. They were very easy to make. The only thing that I would say is that they turned out thin. I will make a double recipe next time and use my 8x8 glass pan. I poured a glaze over them and they were gone in minutes.

I've made this 4 times, and it really tastes more like a 'cocoa' cake and not chocolate cake. It's mildly sweet albeit the 2 cups of sugar. I've tried adding more sugar (an additional cup) and some chocolate chips but alas, it just tastes more sugary and not chocolaty. I've given up on this recipe. I really wanted to like it.

really easy to make with basic ingredients.  I was searching for recipes to get rid of some self rising flour.  Took a few minutes to throw together and I baked at 345 for about 22 minutes.  I admit, I didnt wait to try a square, YUMMMYYY!!!  Ill be making these again and again, next time with some chocolate icing. Thanks for sharing.

Thanks.  These were quick and easy to make.  A little dry, but I added a quarter cup of M&Ms which made it taste a lot better and made up for the dryness!

i prepared this recipe as it was printed, with the exception of increasing it by half again, because my pan is larger than 9x9.
for brownies made with cocoa powder they are rich and chocolately - i would have liked them a bit more dense, but perhaps next time i'll use chocolate chips as well. all in all a great recipe and i'll be making them again!

one of those brownie craving times, but i've always gone out and bought them. this time i decided to make some. melted the butter in a pyrex bowl in the microwave, added a healthy squirt of hershey's dark chocolate syrup to finish up the bottle, probably used a bit more than cocoa powder than it called for, added a very healthy handful of raisins, and very coarsely chopped a handful of almonds.  8x8 pan is in the oven now set for 25 minutes...but, as usual, i didn't hear it go off, so it went a little longer. looks okay, though and is cooling now...ooooh!  pulled up a corner one: yum! i thought they'd be too sweet, but they're wonderful! i just ate a whole row!  soo good, but soo much butter! i wonder if i might cut it in half and replace with apple sauce?  i'll try that next time, and use half the sugar...

I've been making these for years,since a friend passed the recipe along to me.They are amazing ,and super easy-I could not bake at all when I was given this recipe.I use all purpose flour.They have a nice crust,and are soft and gooey inside.I follow the recipe except for switching the butter out for margarine-kosher reasons(always at least doubling  it) and they are delicious as is.But for fun,I've added different things to them:mashed banana or banana extract is delicious,mint extract was fabulous.(the extracts were in place of the vanilla extract)Baking chocolate or chocolate chips are always nice.Have fun with it!

These were super easy to make and taste awesome!!!  I followed another reviewers advice on making the self rising flour as I didn't have any.  They turned out perfect...just a little chewy which I love.  I added chocolate chips to the batter.  Will definately make again!

I always double batch this recipe and I never have self-rising flour on hand. I just make it as needed: 
1 Cup flour, 
0.5 tsp salt, 
1.5 tsp baking powder. 

To make this perfectly chewy and crunchy at the edges First 
I melt the butter in a non-stick frying pan.
Then add the sugar until melted/coated. 
Then the vanilla. Stir.
Then turn off the heat. 
Then the eggs. Stir. 
Then the cocoa. Stir until completely dissolved. 
Then the flour/salt. Stir. It should be dark and slightly runny. 
Pour into a greased/floured 9x13 pan. 
Bake for 30.

I followed the recipe for these brownies exactly and they turned out perfect!  These brownies are moist and not too cake like at all.  I did ice them with a Peanut Butter Frosting recipe I found on here submitted by Suzanne Stull because my husband loves peanut butter and he LOVED them, but they do not NEED a frosting at all.  I am saving this recipe and will make them again.  They were very easyto prepare. I may never make a box brownie again.

I don't know about the BEST brownies(I personally like gooey rich ones) but they were very good and quite easy to make.. my 13 year old daughter made them for us and they turned out great!! We put cream cheese icing on them when they were warm and it was really good! Had one this morning without icing and they were still good and moist! Won't be needing box mixes anymore. We doubled the recipe and put in 13 x 9 pan for 30 minutes!

I made these brownies today and made the following changes after reading reviews.  I doubled the recipe, added 1 C of Chocolate chips, and baked them in a 13 X 9 cake pan.  We love this recipe and will be making them again.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were way too cake like for me.  I was hoping for a more gooieness.  without the powdered sugar I added on top...they would have been like decent cake with no icing.  Won't make these again..sorry!

These live up to their name. I use regular flour and substitute chocolate chips for the nuts. I could eat the whole tray!

This is such a great simple recipe!
 5 minutes from start and into the oven it went. 
Even if you don't bake this one's a keeper. 
It's so simple even my 9 yr. old can make it and it always turns out great. 
 Try adding chocolate chips, caramel bits and pecans for a yummy variation.

I don't know what went wrong because I've made brownies a million times before and they have always turned out great but I cooked these for only 20 minutes at 350 and they were super thin and rock hard. I used an 8x8 pan and when I was pouring the batter I didn't think it was enough and it looked pretty thin but I figured it would raise up or something. the only thing I did differently was I used Splenda instead of sugar. Maybe that was it. But I've baked with Splenda before and things have turned out. I must have done something wrong but for the life of me I can't figure out what. Sorry, I have to give this a bad rating because I've never had a brownie recipe go bad so I'm going to have to blame it on the recipe even if I did mess something up.

I didn't have self rising flour so I used all purpose, they were super fudgey.  I wouldn't go back to the self rising flour.

These brownies are definitely GREAT. I LOVE fudgey brownies, and my husband likes it somewhere in the middle.. this brownie is the perfect balance.  This almost identical to the "Best Brownies" recipe on the site, except without vanilla.  Also, the "Best Brownies" recipe calls for baking soda, this does not.  I prefer this recipe because by not adding baking soda, it makes for a "fudgier" (is that a word?) brownie.  Now, if I only I didn't gain weight from eating the whole pan! lol

Not the best, but not the worst. They could stand to be a little more chocolatey. I like my brownies to be more fudgy than cakey, but perhaps they would've been better if I had used all purpose flour. Overall not bad.

I don't usually have self-rising flour so I used all-purpose flour adding the conversions.  I, also, substituted the white sugar with brown sugar.  Since I did not make it the why it was listed, I can not say mine were better but they were the best home-made brownies I ever eat.  Very light in texture and taste.  I took them to a tail-gate party and everyone loved them.  The brownies have been requested for our 4th of July party.

I'm giving this full marks, because if i was able to make them properly they would have been fantastic. it was really quick to mix together and wasnt long til i popped it in the oven, putting it on top grill!! which resulted in my 'brownies'baked to a crispy crunch on top and a sticky chocolatey pudding thingy at the bottom. if i had put the oven (which i've never used before) correctly they may have come out fantastic. i didn't have walnuts so just added some crushed peanuts instead. it was still fine. Fiance liked it though.. he thought it was some sort of chocolate pudding.. oh well better luck next time!

This was my second attempt at making brownies and did I blow my away my lucky co-workers who were privileged to eat these.  I followed a tip from another member and I added a 12oz bag of semi-sweet choc chips....OMG, I don't like chocolate but these are AMAZING brownies....I am so happy to be using allrecipes.com

Ridiculously simple and delicious. As per the suggestions in the description I used all-purpose flour and Dutch processed cocoa, and the brownies were crisp on the top and crazily fudgy inside. I won't use another recipe (or a store mix) again!

I just made a batch and they are cooling. WOW, they smell SO good that I had to try one while they were still warm. I couldn't believe they could taste better than they smelled, but these are AWESOME! I can't wait until they cool so they harden a bit! Only changes are- used all purpose flour, only 1 egg and a splash of milk (as someone suggested). BEST BROWNIES!!

This is a perfect brownie recipe. No need for buying chocolate squares when you can achieve flavor like this. They have this dutch chocolate taste and they are so easy to make. Not too sweet but just right. Everyone in my family loved them! Thank so much for this totally awesome recipe!!!

I screwed these up and they still turned out great! I didn't notice that I needed "self rising flour" until half way through the recipe, so I used all purpose flour, and added 1 tsp. of baking powder and 1 tsp. of baking soda (this was before reading all the reviews and realizing that I didn't need the baking soda or as much baking powder!!) I doubled the recipe, and it turned out delicious!

Not quite as "fudgy" or chocolatey as I like, but still good nonetheless! I'd make them again, but try to get it right next time. ;)

I left out the nuts and added some chopped semi sweet baking chocolate, maybe 1/4 cup. This recipe is SO easy and SO good!! Don't buy a box, these are so much better, I promise!

I will never buy a boxed brownie mix again. Quick,easy,moist,chewy.I had a few chocolate chips so I threw them in along with pecans.We ate every last crumb! If they last long enough they even taste better on second day.

Excellent Brownie recipe. I added 1 cup Dark chocolate chips instead of the walnuts. I think the chips helped make the brownies more gooey (my favorite!), but they were very rich.

Okay. This recipe is good, but nothing great. Chewy, yes, but the top of the brownies tend to stick to your teeth. All-in-all, these are no better than brownies from a box.

I use this same recipe all the time. My 13 year old son made it 1st. He double the batch and they were delicious. He took them to school for his cooking class and the teacher just loved them. The whole cooking class made them the next week.I will have to try the allpurpose next time.

this was an absolute hit in my house. i made it once exactly how the recipe goes and it was quick and easy. the second time i added a spoonful of fat-free chocolate pudding which made them amazing and moist. perfect for a little vanilla ice cream on the side

I love this recipe.  They turn out soooo good, and the recipe is so easy!  Definitely double the amount you make - if you don't, you'll wish you did when they're all gone!

Very easy. I doubled the recipe, followed it exactly then mixed in 3/4 cup of chop chips. Sprinkled the remaining 1/4 cup of choc chips on top before baking. Texture was perfect. Used two 7-inch round trays, and because of the thickness I had to increase baking time to 45 minutes

This was the first homemade brownie recipe that I tried.  Very Good, but I didn't have a comparison.  I made according to directions (used butter and all-purpose flour).  I doubled the recipe and put into 13x9 pan for 25 minutes.  They were quickly gobbled up!

Horrible.  They turned out flat, and with a bad taste.  Not at all like the normal brownie taste.

These were incredibly quick and easy to make.They tasye yummy too. My only complaint is that the edges were too well done by the time the middle had cooked through.Although that's not too much of a problem in my household-my husband likes them well cooked and I like the gooey brownies :)
So he has the edges and I eat the centres!

I have so many people asking me for this recipe.  Its quick, simple and delicious!!!  Never found better and my daughter made them the same day as I did.  We both agree, never a store bought recipe again.  I can't understand how anyone could screw this up??  I wish I could help them out, but try again.

It's so quick and easy - they've become a real request when the school has it's cake stalls.
