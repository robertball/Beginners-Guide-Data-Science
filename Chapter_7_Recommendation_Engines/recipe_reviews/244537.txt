Made exactly as written. Easy to make. Taste very much like the candy bar. Would recommend 1-2 more cups of nuts and a larger pan to thin out the nugget (as is, nugget is about and 1" thick). Must keep refrigerated otherwise nugget softens and becomes gooy (maybe more marsh mellows would help).
Will definitely make again with the adjustments.

Just so we’re clear on what caramel is... it’s melted sugar. This recipe isn’t missing the caramel it’s just not easy to replicate a candy bar made by a manufacturer that can use highly processed ingredients.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only had a 10 ounce package of peanut butter chips.  Something  burned and stuck to the bottom of my pan while I was stirring, and it flaked into the mixture, but it still came out great! I can't stop eating it straight from the fridge.

I made it just like the recipe except I used dry roasted peanuts with sea salt. Turned out delicious. I would definitely make them again.

I made it. Was good, but the peanut butter taste was just a bit overwhelming. I think next time I'll try toning it down some by using a little less peanut butter chips & more marshmallows.

Really wanted to put bars on my Christmas cookie tray but too gooey and sticky to cut and keep shape. I wonder  if adding more peanuts like suggested by some would have helped since there seemed to be way too much gooey sauce.

Flavor is unbelievable!!  Just LOVE these!!  They are sticky though.  May be better to roll in more nuts after cutting so that they can be picked up without getting VERY sticky fingers.

While tasty, does NOT taste like a PayDay Bar.  PayDay Bars have a caramel center as stated on their wrapper.  This recipe  has a peanut butter center.  Big difference in taste.  Want a PayDay clone, look elsewhere.

This worked out so good, I will never buy the Pay Day Candy Bar again!  After reading the other comments, I made this in a half sheet cake pan and it came out nicely.  I doubled the nuts and added sea salt to half of it.  I will make this again and again.  Great recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

Made exactly per recipe. Very nice and EASY!  Folks eat-em-up.  Tastes like a "Payday" for fraction of cost if ingredients bought in discount stores.  Have made many batches.  I tried the "adding more nuts suggestion."  Looks nice on the dish.  But a bit too salty and nutty for me.  Original recipe is a good balance of sweet and salt as is.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Super easy to make. Everyone loves them. I did sprinkle a little salt on the nougat at my husband's request, and it made it even better.

I used dry roasted honey nuts, dulce leche and Carmel chips for more Carmel flavor. Was a little sweet but oh so good
