I wanted to try something different and this was a perfect choice.   The CAULIPOWER Pizza Crust made an excellent pizza crust.  Who knew?  Nora nailed it with the combination of flavors.  I baked it on my pizza stone which I had preheated in the oven.    My husband drizzled a little duck sauce on the pizza as his usual habit with spring rolls but I thought it was perfect as is.  For those on a gluten-free diet don’t let this pass you by.  It’s yummy!

Add bean sprouts. Add fresh ground peanuts. 

Peanut sauce they didn’t explain. I take peanut butter and liquify more into a sauce with Worcestershire sauce and some soy sauce. Do it to taste. Go easy and add liquids slowly. You don’t want it too runny. If it gets too runny add more peanut butter. 
 
I usually use shrimp vs chicken when making this. 

My recipe is based on trying to duplicate CA Pizza Kitchen’s Thai Pizza.

Optionally leave off chicken.  When pizza is done sprinkle with sautéed shrimp, copped and chopped bbq’d or boiled pork.  Then go to step 6.

Really easy and really good.  As another poster noted, duck sauce gives it an added touch.

Easy enough to make and pretty healthy! I enjoyed it, but my husband was not a fan. I baked one of the pizzas and the other I put together and froze for later. I doubt that I’ll make it again only because it’s a lot for just one person.

Fresh, crispy, gluten free!  This nontraditional pizza starts with  CAULIPOWER  crust making this a super easy, quick dinner or even a great happy hour appetizer.  I made my own peanut sauce and did not use the mint, opting for green onion instead.  The Cilantro and Basil are a must in my book. Definitely will be making this again and using the CAULIPOWER crusts for this and other pizzas.
