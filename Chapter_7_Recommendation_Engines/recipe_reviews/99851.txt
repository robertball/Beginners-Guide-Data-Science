-Kalligirl, 
I have always used a pre-cooked ham (Kentucky Legend brand) and cooked it @ the 6-8 hour setting on my crock pot.  When I submitted the recipe that was changed.  I know some people have been using an uncooked bone-in ham on the 10 hour setting.  Hope that helps!!

HELP!  I want to do this recipe but it doesn't say whether the ham is one of those "pre-cooked" ones that you just heat and serve or is it uncooked?

I will not be tring this again. I bought a precooked ham and as others suggested I planned to slow cook it for 5-6 hours. Even though I cooked it in a ton of apple cider, the meat was extremely dry (unless you like jerky). I though it made the house smell horrible (my hubby didn't think so)... Very embarrassing since we had 15 co-workers over for dinner.

This was wonderful!!  I used a cooked, smoked ham and shortened the cooking time to 6 hours and it was just perfect. We used the liquid to drizzle over the ham once on the dinner table, and it was so delicious.  Everyone raved about it!!  This is a definite keeper in our house!

I made this ham for Easter and it was a big hit with the adults, but the flavors were a little stong for my liking.  In fairness, I did put everything together the night before and kept in the refrigerator, so perhaps this additional time allowed the flavors to permeate more than they would have.  This has a very interesting flavor and I may well make this again, but I think I will cut back a little on the spices, especially the cloves and cinnamon.  Overall very good though!

This was amazing - However 3 cups of cider is NOT enough (you want to make sure that the entire ham is covered becasue anything not covered will be dry) I used over 6 cups of cider...the other thing and this is really important - MIX THE SPICES with the cider BEFREO you put any in the pot.  When you mix the spices with the remaining cider at the end it is not mixed as well as it would have been if it was done in the begining...ALSO - you can never have too much brown sugar....It was an Amazing Easter Ham - and so easy becasue I prepared it the night before and then that morning all I have to do was turn it on...I used a pre-cooked bone in ham adn it cooked on low for about 7-8 hours

This recipe was one of the best slow cooker recipes I have ever tried.  The flavors were exquisite and the meat was extremely tender.  We didn't even have enough leftover for sandwiches.  We picked it clean!! This will definitely be a staple in our house from now on, especially because it was relatively inexpensive as well as delicious.

It was ok.  I used a little less cloves then the recipe asked for but it was still alittle strong.  Our 15 mo old liked it alot though.  I may try again, but with even less cloves (maybe 10?).

True confession:  I got the slow cooker idea and then found your recipe.  My husband didn't want the extra flavors you added so he just put the 6+ lb. precooked Kentucky Legend in the slow cooker for 3.5 hours on low and it was perfectly heated through and juicy.  Your recipe sounds terrific--I just wanted to let people know that the slow cooker option is a great way to save oven space at holiday times.

I was a little afraid due to some of the negative reviews, but I went ahead and tried the recipe and I think it was great! It was a little weird to have the ham soaking in all that apple cider, but it turned out juicy and succulent. I used an almost 6 LB sprial cut already cooked ham and did not use any spices (personal preference) and honey instead of syrup and I used less than the amount of brown sugar and syrup(honey) called for. I cooked it for 7 hours and it was almost falling apart but not quite and it was really good. Nice to come home to part of the meal all done on a work night, thanks for the recipe! I don't understand how anyone could have ended up with a dry ham using this recipe like some reviewers complained of? For me it was easy and tasted great, just what I want on a work night!

I made this for Christmas my family LOVE it, thanks--I bought a Farmland Ham fully cooked spiral ham about 8lbs., had to turn it on its side to fit in crock pot and removed some ham, i score the portion on ham that was on top used about 10-cloves, did use 3 cups of apple cider, 1 cup of brown sugar and maple syrup, 1 tbsp of the cinnamon ,1tsp of nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, no vanilla or orange peel.  I cooked it on low for 7 hours---it was wonderful!!!!!   My family love it--super tender with delicate combination of flavers not over done in the spices.  I saved the leftover cooking juices from crock pot to immerse and cook the ham that had not fit in initially.  DELICIOUS

Welp, lemme tell you.....my whole family agreed this is the best darned ham we've all had. EVER. Now that I know now how it cooks and what I need for next time, I'll use a spiral cut ham (because the recipe didn't say....I had a fully cooked ham, but it wasn't cut) and if I have time, I'll marinate the ham in the "juice" beforehand and maybe I'll thicken up the "juice" with a cornstarch slurry so it'll have more sticking power. The ham didn't get as full of flavor all the way around as I'd hoped, but the pieces that did were AMAZING. I made no changes. Thanks for such a great ham recipe. (Oh, and the smell of this while it's cooking.....ohemgee. So wonderful.)

We have this cooking right now.  9 hours on low...uncooked and unsmoked nearly 8 pound bone-in ham. I am going to finish it off in the oven with roasted veggies so there will be a crust on top. Just wanted to say a few things regarding these reviews. First, there is NO vinegar in this recipe. Use apple cider...that is what the recipe calls for. Spices are definitely stronger when left to cook for long amounts of time. Use your discretion. I did not put in any ground cloves and halved most of the spices. So we will see. I hope that in the future people will not criticize this recipe because they "don't really like cloves or nutmeg". That seems silly. If you don't like a spice, don't use it and don't give the recipe a bad review because it has it in it.

This was a really tasty slow cooker ham.  I especially loved that on a Monday, I came home from work and had a great tasting ham to serve due to the wonders of a crock pot.  I had my misgiving due to some of the negative reviews stating that it was dry, too much spices, etc.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly (I know, I know, it's not fair to judge a recipe if you're changing it, but let's face it we all do it), but next time, out of curiosity I will follow as stated, except for the amount of apple cider which I used only 1 c. and next time will use 1/2.  Here's what I did: I used 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount of spices, used only about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg because nutmeg can be overpowering in my opinion.  Omitted the maple syrup, orange peel, horseradish, vanilla and the whole cloves.  Added about 1 1/2 T dry mustard.  I wanted a more traditional spiced ham and it realy came out moist and delicioso.  For those who are looking for an oven looking ham where the meat doesn't fall off the bone, than place it in the oven in the traditional manner.  But if you want mouth watering easy pleasy ham when you come in the door after a long day's work, or for that matter - enjoy yourself on the weekend instead of slaving in the kitchen, this is the recipe for you.  And yes, like most of you, my ham jutted out of the top a bit so I covered it with foil, placed the lid over it, duct taped the lid to the pot and weighed the lid down with a jar.  Used a smoked pre-cooked Smithfield picnic shoulder

PHENOMENAL!  I made this tonight and we all said it was like Christmas dinner.  I did find that Kentucky brand ham at Target.  It was REALLY good.  I was skeptical about the vanilla, but it was spot on.  It is worth forking over the coin for the real maple syrup too.  I didn't have an orange, so I used the zest of two clementines then cut the clementines in half and tossed them in.  Cooked on high for 2 hours and low for 4.  It was the BEST ham ever.  This is the only way we'll eat it from now on.  THANKS!!!!

There is a difference between a country and a "city ham"  I usually buy a spiral cut pre-cooked ham that just needs to be heated at a low temperature for a couple of hours.  So I will try this with the crock pot on low for 2-3 hours.

I am going to be one of those irritating people that change a recipe so much that it is dumb!  But what I actually did is took a precooked ham, sliced it 90%, so it was still standing together.  Put it in crockpot. Poured maple syrup between each slice.  Then poured a 16 ounce bottle of GingerAle over it.  Cooked it on high for 4-5 hours.  It was fabulous!!!!

Excellent recipe.  This was the main course for our Christmas dinner for the whole family...in-laws and all.  You will read some bad reviews on here about this recipe.  My advice is to truly know your cuts of meat (in this case, ham).  All hams are not the same.  I used a pre-cooked spiral cut honey ham, and tied it together so the ham would not fray.  You may want to avoid smoked hams, as the flavors may not blend well.  

I slow-cooked for 6 hours and it turned out great.  I followed some of the advice here about scaling back on the cloves, as well.  I only used 15 whole cloves and 1 tbsp. of ground cloves.  But overall, a fantastic recipe.

I used a 7.5# boneless Cure 81 ham and it was way overcooked.  1/2 that time would have been plenty. Other than me overcooking it, this recipe was VERY good and i will make it again. So easy and saves on oven space for our Xmas dinner. if i would have used a bone in ham i'm sure the time is correct, therefore will give this 5 stars.

Phenomenal Ham! I have never posted a comment before, but this ham is worthy. I made it for a Christmas party and prayed I didn't have a flop/disaster on my hands. I have already had 3 requests for the recipe. I don't know why it has any bad reviews! Perhaps they used the wrong ham. Don't use a spiral ham. I used a fully cooked bone in 8 lb ham. I couldn't find anything smaller at the grocery. I sliced off a small chunk to fit it in the crock. I cooked the chunk the next day in the leftover sauce- great too. I was afraid of all the spices- 2 whole T. of cloves. But I did use the full amounts. I thickened the sauce slightly with cornstarch & water, but it really doesn't need it. It was even moist without the sauce. I will definitely make this again- it's goin in the recipe box.

Awesome recipe!! I would suggest adding the sugar, maple syrup and spices to the apple cider before pouring it into the crock, so it mixes all together.

I loved this!!!  I used a pre-cooked ham at 8 hours as others had suggested, otherwise I followed it exactly.  It smelled great and tasted even better!  Thanks reinejessica!  ps.  I also tried it with a bone-in ham and I really didn't like it too fatty and it picked up too much citrus.

PERFECT!!!

I actually heard of a yummy Crock Pot Christmas Ham from the infamous Kate Gosselin. So, I searched the internet for the recipe. After reading most of the reviews, I made my ham.

 I got a 6 pound bone-in ham. I did add the 30 whole cloves. I just added them to the liquid. I didn't stick them in the ham. I didn't have the orange or the ginger.

The ham was pretty much perfect. The only thing I would change is the cook time. 10 hours was too long for our ham/crockpot. It fell off the bone lovely, but it seemed a tad dry. We just solved that by pouring sauce over the ham on our plates.
Also, when I make this for Easter, I may add cornstarch after cooking to thicken the sauce a little for more of  a 'gravy'.

We got RAVE reviews from family! We served with pineapple casserole (which was amazing), as well as all of our other traditional Christmas dinner sides.

Wow!  I made this yesterday with an 8lb fully cooked spiral cut ham.  A little bit of the ham stuck out of the cider in the crock pot, so every so often I would open it up and baste that section with the juices.  I only cooked for about 3.5 hours on low and then turned the crock pot to warm for the next 3 hours. It came out perfect.  The whole ham was so moist and flavorful.  My husband absolutely raved about this ham, and my step daughter and her husband really loved it too!  I couldn't believe just how tender and moist the ham was and  there was flavor all the way to the bone.  I didn't use whole or ground cloves, or the ginger because I didn't have them on hand. I did use a sprinkle of allspice, with the nutmeg and the Cinnamon.  I used the brown sugar and the maple syrup as specified, but it took a whole jug of apple cider to nearly cover the ham because of the size of my crock pot.  I will be making this ham again and again for sure.

I read all the reviews first, I followed some of the tips.  I had a 10 lb spiral cut ham.  I cooked it for a shorter period of time as suggested in tips.  EPIC FAIL! It fell apart in good sized pieces, it was so dry and it basically tasted like salt.

Awesome recipe..everyone loved it ..even the kids. From now on it will be our favorite family ham recipe. It is a keeper for sure and the house smelled great all day..very welcoming. Some adjustments I made were I lowered the brown sugar and maple syrup to 1/2cp each and added 1/4cp honey, lowered the nutmeg and cinnamon to 1tbsp each, lowered the apple cider to 2cps and added 2cps orange juice to ensure enough liquid in the pot being I had a large sized ham as well as it added a lovely fruit flavor. It was fabulous..you have to try it!! Thanks..great recipe:)

This was delicious and a crowd pleaser!  It does smell wonderful.  I didn't use the ground cloves and it still turned out great!  I used a pre-cooked spiral cut ham and cooked on low for 5-6 hours.  So yummy!!!

The flavor was good but the ham came out so dry. Maybe I did something wrong because so many people say it was juicy, but I followed the directions exactly. Sorry!

I thought this was very tasty.  It yielded a very tender, moist and flavorful ham.  I used a 3 lb pre-cooked ham, halved the other ingredients, and cooked on low for 6 hours.  The ham had a very sweet flavor to it.  The only thing that is missing is a good "crust" on the top, so the next time I make it, I might not completely cover it with the cider.

I really wanted this to be good. For our family preference, the spices overwhelmed the ham flavor.  It was very unusual; it was like eating nutmeg meat. House smelled great, though. Due to the rave reviews, I keep thinking (and hoping) I did something wrong! I know I could change the ingredients to our preference, but I would have to change so much, it wouldn't be close to the same recipe.

This is now the only way I will ever cook a ham again!  Make sure to get a smallish ham - say 8-10 lbs at the most.  I cut mine into several large chunks in order to get it into the slow cooker.  I didn'st measure the apple cider - just poured it in until it nearly reached the top.  Made it for Christmas dinner, then we enjoyed the moist leftovers (but not for long - they went fast!)  Every Christmas dinner should be THIS EASY!

This is hands down the best ham I have ever eaten.  I'm not a great ham enthusiast, but this one takes my highest praise.  I made it for Easter, and even my semi-vegetarian guest was snitching pieces from the kitchen after dinner.  Grand cudos for this great recipe!

I made this for Easter this past weekend. I bought a 4 pound spiral ham. I added some ground cloves & the juice of I can or pineapple slices with the pineapples. I CANT TOLERATE TOO MUCH SALT  so I soak it in water fro about 3- 4 hours changing the water once. I came out so delicious. I would definitely make it again. for a 4 pound ham I cooked it just about 4 hours. I WILL definitely make it again.

Wonderful recipe, I followed it exactly and have never been disappointed.  My family can't keep their hands off it so any leftovers don't last long at all.
To the reviewer who mentioned that she is going to cut down on the vinegar the next time she makes this..... Reread the recipe, there is NO vinegar.  Yikes!

Hmmmm....very tasty and moist ham. I used a 6 pound precooked ham, not spiral sliced. I cut back on the cloves to about 10. I didn't use the orange peel. Otherwise, I followed the directions. It was very moist and tasty. Even my hard to please husband loved it. I will definitely make all my hams this way from now on!

Great ham recipe! It made the house smell great all day and the end result did not disappoint! The meat was moist and tender and the flavor was a perfect compliment to the cool fall day. A definite make again. We made it as suggested with a precooked semiboneless ham but only cooked it on low for 6 hours. After we carved what we needed for dinner we put the the rest back in the slow cooker as it cooled for about an hour.

I have not tried this recipe. I read the reviews and some people say theirs turned out dry and ham was falling apart. The recipe calls for Bone-in country ham. Now, does that mean the country ham that's salty? Not a precooked ham? Maybe I should go to recipe exchange and ask.

Too sweet! Too many cloves. If cooked for 8 hours you are going to have a ham that just falls apart. A fully cooked ham, needs just to be heated, not cooked. There is way too much liquid. The ham doesn't "bake" it stews instead. A soup results. A very sweet soup at that.

I made this for Easter and it was WONDERFUL!!   I marinated the ham upside-down overnight in the juice and spices in the crock pot and then turned it over and let it cook all morning while we were at church.  The spices gave it a wonderful flavor.  I  think with the scent & flavor especially with these spices, this would be the perfect recipe for winter holiday cooking.

YUM, YUM, YUM !!!!  Me and my family loved this ham and we couldn't believe how easy it was to make !  When I mentioned to people that we were making a crock pot ham with a cooked ham, they all thought it would just fall apart (like roast pork or something) - but it didn't.  It was just very soft and extremely tasty !  The only changes we made were that we flipped the ham over in the middle of cooking it and didn't add as many cloves (although that's half of what made it taste so good).  The ONLY change we'll make the next time we make this is (since we're huge garlic lovers), we'd add whole, cut up and/or crushed garlic cloves all over it.  I think that's the only thing that would make this recipe a full 5 stars !  Thanks for this great recipe !

I think this could have been better for me.  I am debating whether or not to try it again.  I bought a precooked ham and as others suggested I planned to slow cook it for 5-6 hours.  That was definitely too long for me - and I had an 8 lb ham in a huge crockpot and I drowned it in apple juice..  Even though I cooked it in liquid the meat tasted a bit dry and overdone.  I should have taken it off by 4 hours I believe.  It really did not even smell up my house like I expected.  Who knows what I did wrong.

I tried this recipe using a spiral pre-cooked ham and it only needed 4 hours on high.  I did have to rotate the ham halfway through since it was too big for the slow cooker and I wanted to make sure both sides were absorbing the apple cider mixture.  I didn't use any cloves but added pineapple juice and brown sugar to the top of the ham during the cooking process.  Very easy to make.  I have given the recipe to mys sister who will be making it for Christmas dinner this year.

Absolutely delicious!  This is a new family tradition.  Cooking in crockpot also makes preparing the Holiday meal much easier.

I cooked two hams in two crock pots for Thanksgiving yesterday. I used smoked spiral-cut hams. The results were delicious. Since these hams were fully cooked they probably didn't need the full 8 hours. The only problem I had was that one crock pot was a new model and one was an old model. The ham cooked in the old model was perfect. The one cooked in the new model, which probably cooks hotter than the old pot, was overcooked but still moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing.

THIS WAS MEGALICIOUS!!! I used an uncooked smoked picnic ham.  I thought it had too much liquid and my crock pot was not quite large enough so I cut down on cider, and ground cloves to 1-1/2 T. and covered it with foil but still overflowed onto counter.  I mixed the spices with the brown sugar and put 1/2 cup on bottom of crock pot and spread rest on ham. Ham dark on bottom due to dark colours caused by cloves and maple syrup so I cut down time to 6 hours but while not overdone it could have been 1-2 hours less.  Put a few slices on the griddle next morning and wonderful scent permeated the house once again.  This definitely a keeper!

I was very disappointed. I had never made a ham in the crock pot before but I was expecting it to be very moist and tender. It was very dry. I have to say it was the worst ham I've ever had. I cooked it for Easter but there was a lot left over which is unusual for one of my dinners.I tossed it the next day. It was even too dry to use for beans or casseroles. I followed the recipe exactly and followed the time line for the cooking time.I will not be making this again.

Overall average ham.  Used an 8 pound, bone-in, pre-cooked spiral sliced ham.  Did not use the ground cloves based on other's comments.  Also omitted the ginger since I simply forgot to buy it from the store.  Used all the other spices as called for in the recipe.  For the 8 pound ham I decreased the amount of whole cloves to 10.  And then the peel of one orange as recipes calls for.  Cloves and orange dominated the flavor.  Not the greatest combination of tastes.  If you prefer a simple ham, I think using good old brown sugar will be enough.  Also very very tender.  Sprial slices just fell to pieces when pulling apart, that in itself is neither good or bad, but just a personal preference for me to have full slices of meat.  Not piece-meal bits.  A bit of a turn off.  Overall, OK.  Totally agree with Elvis Presley 99's review.  Too floral indeed.

This was really excellent.  I used a 7 lb pre-cooked spiral cut ham.  I only used about 12 whole cloves and cut back the ground clove about half.  I cooked on the low 6-8 hr setting and it was more than done in about 5.  and was faling apart when we served.

I think next time I try think I'll 'cook' it on warm for 4-5 hours.  The clove spiceiness was just perfect.  You could taste it but not overpowering at all.

I will definately be making this again.

I must have done something wrong, since everyone else loves this. My whole family shunned it, and I was left putting another meal together. All the spices were just too much for us.

Our oven heat element went out and we needed a GREAT recipe to use. Found this one and used it with a 10.5 lbs precooked spiral cut ham. So I multiplied the whole recipe by 1.5 except the cloves. I just put them between each spiral cut layer spacing about 1 1/2 to 2" apart.Covered the ham with 1 c. brown sugar BEFORE adding the cider. Then using another 1/2 c. brown sugar on the exposed top 2" after I fill the pot with the cider. Cooked it for 7 hrs & it turned out WONDERFUL, such great flavor, lots of great comments. Only thing agreed on was that it was a wee bit dry. We all agreed that it would be best if cooked for 6 hrs since it is precooked.

I used a precooked ham in a crock pot for about 6 hrs; and while the taste was great the consistency of the cider that it soaked in was a little weird. It kind of seperated and when I basted the ham the globs of seasoning stuck to the cloves.  I can't really explain it but it was different.  Sure didn't affect the tast but definitely wasn't expecting that type of sauce.

Great recipe!  I will always make this ham for the holidays! I omitted the maple syrup only because I didn't have it on hand and it still turned out wonderfully.  I also used a 64 oz juice container of apple cider.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I really want to try this recipe and was wondering if it was possible to put the ham in the slow cooker for about 3.5 hours to get it to soak in all the spices and juice and afterwards pop it in the oven for another 1.5-2hours to get a nice, gentle crisp on the outside???

Well we learned last year that we didn't like much cloves at all so we only used 6 cloves.  But I did everything else as prescribed (very unlike me).  I'm not  sure how, but mine came out dryer (when cooked in liquid) than if I baked it in the oven. I also think I don't like as many spices as this.  I think I'll go back to my frozen orange juice concentrate and brown sugar rub/baste.

Excellent! At least that's what my family and all my guests said! Very easy. I used a ham from the meat counter and sectioned it so it fit better in my crock pot. Used less cloves as we're not huge fans of that spice. Also did not add as much cider - 1 cup was plenty as the ham let off a lot of juice. I agree with another reviewer ... save the cooking liquid for other dishes! Just freeze it for later. Thank you for such a nice recipe!

UPDATE! This was incredible as leftovers! My family has been asking for ham sandwiches over and over. Wow - very good!

GREAT! Loved it. The only thing I might change next time is less cider. I think that stood out a bit much. And my, my it sure did make the house smell good. So easy, just my style. And I sure do love the slow cooker. Will definitely make again.

I tried the recipe it was real good.!!  I had a bigger ham than 6# couldn't find one that small..  It was good..  I thought some of the spices amounts where a little high just by looking at it so I backed off some. It was perfect..  Good recipe.

This was amazing and absolutely delicious. My small children who are not too crazy about ham gobbled it up and wanted more. My Husband could not get enough either. It was a sure fire hit with our guests. The house smelt great with the apply cider and seasonings. I used a little less brown sugar than it called for and used a drizzle of honey instead of the maple syrup. Thanks for a very memorable meal and a new family receipe.

I only put one star since you have to have something. I paid $17.68 for a ham, because so many people rated it so high. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and when I checked on it, it had completely fallen apart. It was a 10lb ham and the only thing I changed was to add more apple cider. This was the worse disaster I have ever had and I have been cooking 54 years. It doesn't even taste like ham. I guess you might like it if you were adverse to ham. Will never try this again.

The most delicious ham I have ever tasted.  It was so moist and flavourful.  We needed to double the cider and spices to account for the size of our slow cooker.  We could not find any prepaid apple cider so we used instant packages.  All we heard around the table was mmmmmmmmmm.

My boyfriend and I both love the way this ham turned out!  I used a 3 pound boneless precooked ham since there was only the two of us.  Due to personal taste (my boyfrined and I prefer dishes that are less sweet) I cut back on the sugar, syrup and spices.  Also I did not use the whole cloves.  The ham was really soft and had a very nice flavor. I will definitely be making this again soon!

Way to many spices. All you could taste was cinnamon and spice - not the ham. I will stick to the traditional ham baked with a bottle of coke poured over it. Not fancy, but delicious.

Pretty good... I made it for Christmas Eve dinner for the family.  Used only 12 cloves.  May not use the orange peel, or maybe only half, as it was really citrusy.  Almost tasted like corned beef.  Have made it for sandwiches today.  Family, especially the kids, thought it was good.

Wow - this was excellent, the best ham I have ever had, hands down.  It was so juicy, and stayed that way for leftovers as well.  And using the slow cooker was a perfect fit (mine is oval) for the ham, and I didn't have to touch it.  The house smelled wonderful - my new ham recipe!

This recipe is great and falls apart in the slow cooker. The one thing I would do next time, is cut back on the amount of cloves used. It was really strong of clove, but it was pretty fantastic anyways.

NOTE:IF YOUR HAM IS PRECOOKED THIS WILL TURN IT INTO A ROCK OR LEATHER other than that we subbed the apple cider for orange juice because we realized to late we had no cider and we absolutely LOVED the orange juice

I seldom knock a recipe (if you can't say something nice..) but this was really a disaster.  The ham was so overcooked that it fell off the bone as I removed it from the crock.  The meat was dry and had a really weird consistency..sort of leathery, and a strange color.  Two tbsp. of ground cloves seemed excessive to me so I used less.  Thank God I did because the taste of cloves was overpowering, even with the lesser amount.  This was not a cheap recipe to make, between the ham, the cider and the maple syrup.

This was hands down a disaster! I followed the directions exactly and it was overly sweet and had a jerky texture, just as another reviewer had stated. Everyone that took it left it on their plates. I ended up eating a few pieces but it pretty much went to waste.

I made this ham for my fiirst easter gathering for my family and it was a huge success! Everyone enjoyed it! It is so simple yet delicious. I didnt make any changes to it at all and it turned out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again.

Tried this for Easter and it was DELICIOUS! The whole family loved it. Used a boneless ham because I wanted a smaller than was available with bone-in. Used a 4 lb. boneless hickory smoked ham and cut it in four pieces, reduced the amounts and cooked it for at least 8 hours, occasionally opening the crock pot and pouring the juice on top of the ham. We used the leftovers for two nights. Thanks!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but took others' advice and reduced the cooking time to 6 hours since I had a pre-cooked ham.  I was really disappointed with the result.  The meat was so dry and it was overwhelmed by the apple cider flavor.  Loved the idea of using the crock pot but not sure why it came out so tough and dry.

Made this for Easter. The only thin I did dfferent was put some brown sugar at the bottom of the slow cooker before I put the ham in and I left off the whole cloves since I didn't have any. My family thought it was the best ham I have ever made. Also wonderful because now I have more oven space for other holiday foods.

This recipe is great, we just made it for a family Easter of 8. We could have used just half but we have lots of delicious leftovers. It fills your home with an amazing aroma.  Instead of 1 6lb. ham we used 2, 3lb. boneless precooked hams.  We cooked them for 9 hrs. on low and let them sit for another hour on the warm setting. We made a few small adjustments. Only 16 whole cloves and 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 Tbsp. more of nutmeg.

When I went to make this in my crock pot I found that my crock was to small(4 quarts).  I put it in  my electric frying pan with the lid on & on low heat setting, thinking it would be ok.  We went out for a short while & came back to the burning ham, I salvaged as much of the ham as I could & took it to our church's potluck dinner(I was little upset at this time but took it anyway) that night, to my surprize it was liked, especially from one gentleman!  AND at the time I cooked this I was cooking in my basement because our kitchen was being renovated, the frying pan & crock were on the floor being used for our meals :)  That certain gentleman has been asking me to make that ham again, I don't know if I'll be able to match the same results.

This recipe was fantastic!  I was a little worried about all the liquid but it worked.  I condensed some on the stove with cornstarch to make a sauce.  Based on other reviews, I cut back on the spices...10 cloves and half of everything else.  We did have a much smaller, three pound, ham.  It wasn't too spicy at all and next time I'll add a bit more.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

This was the moistest, tastiest ham I've ever had.  It was a hit at Easter.  I used an uncooked, bone-in ham at 10 hours.  The meat fell off the bone.

Delicious, moist and tasty blend of sweet and smokey. I used a 9.5 lb spiral cut, hickory smoked ham as a second entree to our Thanksgiving meal. I did not alter the ingredients at all except for the size of the ham a/o our family's needs. My daughter will be making it again for the family Christmas potluck. Diced up and scrambled with eggs made for a great morning after meal!

We tried this last night.  I followed the directions, which were easy enough, and used an uncooked picnic bone-in ham.  The meat was tender, but the flavor was too overpowering for our palates.  The house smelled like Christmas, but the ham itself had too much of a "floral" after-kick that didn't seem like it belonged in the meat.  While this recipe seems to be a favorite with a lot on the site, it just wasn't a set of flavors my family was used to, and that probably put them off.  Sorry :(

I made this for Thanksgiving this year (along with a turkey). It was a huge hit! However, it was a bit strong in the cloves. Next time I will just use the whole cloves instead of also adding the ground cloves. Great recipe!

I used an 8 lb. spiral-cut smoked ham.  8 hours in the slow-cooker was too long for this type of ham.  It turned out a little dry around the edges, 5-6 hours on low would do the trick since it is already cooked and just needs to heat.  I love the concept though, it freed up my oven and I'll definitely be making my ham like this all the time.  I omited the whole cloves and cut the rest of the spice amounts in half, it just seemed like way too much and I'm glad I did.

This was a great recipe! I made this for my first Easter dinner, it is the first ham I have ever made. It came out wonderful. I was slightly worried about what others said about it being dry, so I cooked it on low for 6 hours. It was on warm the rest of the time (about 2 hours) until I served it. During that 2 hours I basted it every 30 minutes or so. I used a semi-boneless ham that was fully cooked. It was so tender it fell apart as I moved it to the platter. I mixed a ladle full of the juices with 2 heaping tablespoons of apricot preserves to make a glaze. This is how my mom always served ham. It was great and very tasty. I will be sure to make this again!

Absolutely wonderful. I Served it for Easter and then made a second one for a potluck one week later.  Both hams were delicious and everyone commented on how good they were.  Like many other people I only used 15 cloves and increased the apple cider till it covered all but a little of the ham. The second time I also halved the clove powder but this was only a personal thing because the clove powder was from a freshly opened package and seemed strong.   I will definately be making it again.

The ham was very delicious, although the outside was way too clovey for me, which was disappointing, since I was hoping for something kind of sweet.  The inside was very tender and juicy, though.

We thought this was just okay.  The flavor of cloves was more than we liked.  It probably didn't help that the particular ham I purchased was very salty. It did make the ouse smell good, but I don't know that I would make this again.

This is my staple recipe for ham.   I have made it at least once a month for the past two years .   I always use a picnic ham.  
 It seems to cook best (more tender and thouroughly cooked) if left on the 6 to 8 hours slow cooking .  
 With any leftovers I have, I make the Delicious Ham and Potato Soup recipe (found here in All Recipes).  
 These two recipes really go hand-in-hand. Even if I don't have time to make the potato soup the next day, I'll freeze the leftover ham and throw it in the soup when I am ready.  
 Notes: I've only use the orange peel once and I didn't notice any difference positive or negative with the flavor.   I use high-quality maple syrup from Canada,  and just high-quality ingredients for everything else. It really seeps into the ham. I sometimes keep the liquid (using a sieve to catch the spices), and use it for storing the leftover meat as an added 'sauce' for the ham.  I also sometimes add a bit of this liquid to the above mentioned soup.  What flavor!

Turned out great, just have to make sure the ham isn't too much out of liquid or that part gets dry/overcooked.

I made this recipe for Christmas and everyone loved it. I am cooking another one today along with a pot of beans. I used a spiral sliced ham so that the apple cider, spices, and maple syrup etc. would be infused between the slices.  I read some reviewers who said their smoked, cooked ham was too dry using this recipe; try the spiral sliced one instead.  I grew up with relatives who smoked their own hams in a smokehouse so I have to say the store-bought hams are too dry, they are also overcooked.  If you look, you may be able to find an old farmer who still smokes his own meat, there are some who still do.  There are ranchers in my area who raise their own cattle and sell them to buyers in the area; they will cut it up and wrap it for you.  It may cost you a little more but you know where the meat is coming from, what it was fed, etc.  The meat is more flavorful.  I enjoy this recipe and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys using their slow cooker.  Vary the spices according to what you like the best.

I love this recipe. I loved the way the house smelled and you could taste every ingredient. I did use a precooked ham and cooked it less time. This is my family's new holiday ham.

This was incredibly good!  I made it for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it.  I used an uncooked picnic ham.  It was so moist and flavorful.  I love lots of spice.  I also thought it smelled great.  I used the bone the next day to make split pea soup and it was the best I have had.  I'm thinking the poster that said it was dry used a spiral cut ham.

I have a small crock pot and just tried this for Easter.  Probably due to the smaller pot, this ended up being VERY heavily seasoned.  I am not a fan of cloves so next time I will 1/2 the whole cloves and cut out the ground cloves all together

This recipe must have been intended for an uncooked ham. Most hams at the grocery store are pre-cooked, so I'm not sure where I'd find an uncooked ham.  While the combination of seasonings sounded fantastic, and most things cooked in a slow cooker are moist and delicious, this ham turned out very dry.  It was awfully disappointing to have for Easter dinner, but thankfully we did not have guests over or it would have been a real disaster.  Am I missing something? Because many of the reviewers for this recipe seemed very pleased with the results...the reviews were what prompted me to choose this recipe.

This is so easy and super delicious!! I prefer to use Tropicana Simply Apple instead of Cider. But I made this for Thanksgiving for a really picky family but it got devoured! I love this recipe and I am going to use it every time I make a ham!!!

This ham was phenomenal!  The flavors went so well together....I served it for Easter and the guests raved on and on -- including one very picky eater!  It's a week later and we're enjoying this ham as much today as we did at Easter.  DE-LICIOUS!  Thank you for the recipe.  I didn't change a thing, by the way.  :-)

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  It's extremely easy and it is very tasty.  I think it might have had too strong a taste but I really liked it overall.  I think next time I would use less cloves and it would be perfect.  After 10 hours it fell off the bone when I took it out.  It was so tender.  We are still eating it 3 days later.

I made this with a 7lb Dearborn Ham for Easter. It was really good, sweet, and extremely tender..it was falling off the bone. The only thing is I dont think I will make this in the Spring. The flavors are really fall or winter. But, very tasty!

No, no, no. We didn't care for this recipe at all. Followed the directions exactly except cut down a bit on the cooking time. Watery, tasteless, dry. The excess spices kill any taste of the ham. I don't recommend it!

I used a picnic ham needing cooked and I cooked it in the oven overnight. I put my ham and all the ingredients in an oven friendly stock pot with the rest of the ingredients, except for maple syrup which I didn't have, and set my oven at 225 degrees and I went to bed. I let the ham cook verrrry sloooowly all night and what a ham. It was literally falling apart tender and what flavor. I am very impressed by this recipe, thank you. I will definately do this one again. Irene

A few years ago I tried this recipe and it did not turn out as well as I would have liked. Even so, I decided to try it again. This time I did not use a spiral cut ham. What a difference! I have used this recipe several times since.

My picky family loved this!  All of them.  I did decrease the cooking time to 5 hrs though as suggested by others. I used a 5 lb picnic precooked, not raw. I also cut the amount of cloves to around 15...less to pluck out. This will be finding it's way to our Thanksgiving table alongside the turkey!

I liked this recipe a lot. I'm on my second try and still trying to get the cooking time/temp right.  Last time it was overcooked and fell apart -- not that I've ever complained about incredibly tender and delicious meat -- but it wasn't exactly what we were expecting for Easter dinner.  Still very good, though and I used the leftovers mixed with a little honey bbq sauce from Fresh-n-Easy for the best BBQ sandwiches I've ever eaten!

Love this recipe! Made it for Christmas dinner and I had NO leftovers! Also my Mother and Mother in Law both asked for the recipe! This is a keeper! Next time I will omit the vanilla though as I think it put the sweetness of the dish over the edge for our family!

I just made this now...it was a delicious.  I made a smaller ham (only 3.5 pounds) but it still turned out delicious.  I did cut back on the cloves (both whole and ground) as others had suggested. This was my first ham and my first slow cooker recipe ever!  Great first experience.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.  I will make it again

I used a 5 1/2 lb fully cooked picnic ham, used fresh grated nutmeg ( I was born in CONN.) added a couple handfuls of mixed rasins, a seperated mandrin instead of o-peel. Was GRRRATE. next time might try dried fruit

This was the perfect recipe for my very busy oven on Easter Sunday.  The flavor was great and there was none left.  Will keep this on hand for each time I serve ham.

This was very good right out of the crock pot. Leftovers, however, were very bland. We ended up throwing the leftovers out. Perhaps the cooking time is too long.

There is WAY too much clove in this recipe. I actually made this without the 30 whole cloves pressed into the ham and only 1.5 tablespoons of ground clove instead of 2 and it was still too much. I'll make it again but with only 1 TEASPOON of ground clove if any at all.

I made this, but severely tweaked the recipe.  First of all, I did not make it in a slow cooker.  I baked it in the oven on 350* for about 3 hours.  I did not use any cloves.  I used the brown sugar and maple syrup, although probably a bit less.  Used all the other spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, etc. - and instead of apple cider, I used beer!  I was never a big fan of ham, but this has changed me forever.  It was SOOOO sweet and juicy.  All my guests loved it.  I served it in a crockpot, to keep it warm and have it rest in the juices.  Can't wait to make it again!

I made this ham for my family for our Christmas Day dinner! I put a 6-7 lb smoked ham in the crockpot at 9:00 a.m. using the directions provided. At 5:00 p.m. I removed the ham and let it sit for a few minutes. The ham was so tender and juicy that I could take it apart with a large fork and I served it on a platter leaving half in shreds and chunks for people to serve themselves and the other half untouched so that we could "shred or cut" as needed. I served some of the crock pot liquid on the side for anyone who wanted it although it wasn't really needed. Some poured the liquid over their sweet potatoes - delicious! My 6 ft 5 in son had three helpings! The best part was how easy it was and the early prep allowed me enjoy the day with my family. I will definitely make this dish again!

I cooked it in a big foil pan instead of the crock pot because I forgot I was making scalloped potatoes.  I omitted  the cloves and used everything else.  I added sliced pineapple on top and just kept basting with juices.   This was the best ham I ever made.  I also covered it with foil while cooking and cooked it 
for 3 - 3 1/2 hours delicious and juicy!

I tried this for Easter. My family wouldn't eat it. It looked like pulled pork and was very vinegary. I used apple cider vinegar but should have used organic vinegar. My husband thought apple cider might have worked better. Thankfully I made an other
 ham and they liked it.

On Easter I invited about 10 guests and I have never cooked a ham before...I thought I would give it a try and WOW! I was soooo nervous that it wouldn't turn out but EVERYONE loved it and said it was the best ham they have ever had! Made me feel so good and confident :) My fiance requested that I make this for our Christmas dinner, he loved it so much!

I used sparkling apple cider and didn't bother measuring the amount I put in since, I don't think it matters. Because the seasoning were so strong, it reminded me of Christmas in my home. I ended up taking the ham out earlier than scheduled because I noticed that it was falling off the bone. I served it for Easter dinner and I got to say it was very sweet. All in all, it is a good ham; however, not one I would make again due to the lack of the "ham" taste.

I made this for easter and was VERY disapointed.  I made EXACTLY as directed. The cooking time is WAY TOO LONG and my ham was mush after about 5 hours set on low.  Will not ever make again.  It sounded like such a good recipe but turned out so bad.

I did not care for this recipe at all. I followed the directions to the T....the ham was dry and did not smell good while cooking, which shocked me because i would have thought it would smell good with the spices and cider. it had an okay flavor...nothing to rave about. i would not make this recipe again.

I was nervous about this recipe as I'm very new to cooking but it turned out amazing! I used apple juice instead of cider and left out the cloves and ginger as I'm not a fan and didn't have on hand. I did everything else as state. The flavour was subtle and really nice! I used a smaller precooked smoked ham and cooked on high for about 4.5 hours. Both me and my picky boyfriend loved it!!!

This is a great recipe. I made this last year for a brunch and it was a big hit- I used an already smoked ham, and it still came out juice and delicious.  It will make your house smell like Christmas.  I am making it again this year for my family get together.  Yum!

Lesson learned never try a recipe for the first time for a work potluck... I used a 8lb uncooked bone-in ham and cooked it 8 hours while I was asleep. I thought I was going to awake the next morning to a cooked ham ready to slice and serve at the potluck. I admit the ham was flavorful but it just fell apart when I tried to slice it. It was not presentable at all. So I went to plan B and used the now shredded ham in another family favorite recipe to serve at potluck. I was late to work but I did have a dish to pass. I'll keep searching for a recipe to use to cook a ham :-(

I will not be trying this recipe again. I agree with a previous post, the smell of the ham while it was cooking almost turned me off from trying it when it was ready to eat. I followed the recipe exactly as stated - very disapointing. Turned out dry.

I normally use a basic ham recipe where you put the ham in the slow cooker and add a few handfuls of brown sugar  SET and FORGET    the ham turns out beautiful.

Well, for my husbands birthday I wanted to make his favorite meal (Ham and mashed potatos) but I didn't want it to be the same ol ham I always serve him. So i made this!! WOW!! JUST what I was looking for. Its a "fancy ham" as he called it.  SO yummy SO easy.  A keeper and I will definetly be making again SOOON

I made this yesterday.  I did not turn out well at all.  I used a smithfield pre cooked ham.  10lbs.  It cooked for the 8 hours in receipe.  It turned to mush.  Sorta like pulled ham. I'll go back to the old fashion reheating in the oven.

This ham was really moist, easy and good.  The meat was very tender.  I think I'd cut down on the spices, but that's due to my family's personal tastes.  I got rave reviews on this one.

A great way to do ham....this recipe inspired me to join Allrecipes so I could leave a comment thanks REINEJESSICA for a wonderfully easy original recipe!
I used a 5lb picnic bone-in precooked smoked ham cooked for 5 hours on low.
I reduced the cloves to 10 due to the size of the ham and omitted the orange peel (due to personal preference). The combo of sweet and smoke was perfect and the ham was very tender. This will not be one just for the Holidays.

Made this for Easter yesterday, and it was SOOO good!  My 5 year old thought I gave him sweet bacon!  The only thing I changed was the number of cloves--used approx. 15.  Made with a 7.5 lb spiral ham.  I would definately make this again, but cook it only for about 5 hours.

Tasty, fork tender, and wonderfully moist! Delicious recipe!! As suggested by some others, I decreased the seasonings by half. Using a spiral sliced bone in ham, I sliced the ham from the bone before placing in slow cooker. I also topped the ham with sliced pineapple and cherries. The ham was cooked on low for 7 hours, next time I will be decreasing that time to 5 hours. Lots of rave reviews from my family at Easter dinner!! Thanks so much for sharing!!

We loved this recipe! I used a fully cooked kentucky legend smoked ham. Only used about 15 whole cloves and omitted the ground cloves as other suggested. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It turned out wonderful! I had a hard time finding Apple Cider this time of year. I asked the produce manager if they had any - and luckily they had just gotten a shipment in. He went to the back and brought me some. :-) The ham was moist and perfect. I will make this again. It is a simple worry free - no fail recipe!

I made this for Easter dinner. It was pretty good, not the best I have ever had. I personally think it was the ham itself and not this recipe. My husband and kids LOVED it though. I put it in the crockpot with all the ingredients and soaked it overnight in the fridge.I omitted all the whole cloves and added an extra tsp of ground cloves instead. I also inserted a cinnamon stick into the center of the ham to keep a slight barrier between the top of the crock and the meat. (My ham was floating from the apple cider) Hubby doesn't like orange peel so that was also left out. 
  Overall I'd make this again, however I will add more brown sugar and less maple syrup.

This is hands down the best ham I've ever had.  I just got a normal ham, bone in, spiral cut from the store and let it cook all day.  The house smelled so good and everyone wanted some to take home!

I don't like ham, but this was great.  It was so easy and simple.  The ham came out so tender that it just fell off of the bone when i tried to get it out of the slow cooker. My ham was a little large for my pot, so i justed basted it with the juices every few hours to keep it moist. This will definately be my ham recipe for all of my family get togethers.

Easy, fast to prep and delicious!  I cut back on both the brown sugar and the syrup and didn't miss it.  I highly recommend this, especially during busy times with lots of family to feed.  The house smelled great!

I will try it in the crock pot another time.

This is my 'go to' ham recipe. I have used both spiral sliced and whole hams.  If you are looking for the spiced flavor in your meat you really have to use spiral sliced. The fragrant juice does not penetrate the meat very far. I particularly like the addition of the orange peel to the juice.  The last time I made this I reduced the powdered spices by 2/3 and it didn't seem to diminish the flavor (Make tablespoons teaspoons)  This is and easy way to make ham.

It was really good.  I substituted the pineapple juice and orange juice for the vinegar and I think I will lower the spices a bit if I make it again - we really enjoyed it otherwise though.

I will definitely be making this again! We made it for Easter dinner and it was a hit!  I followed the recipe except that I mixed the spices and brown sugar with the cider before pouring it over the ham.  I added the whole orange in slices instead of just the peel and added a can of crushed pineapple.  It was delicious!  When I served it I thickened up the cider with all the spices and pineapple with a little cornstarch and mashed up the orange, minus the peel, to use as a sauce!  Wonderful!  The only thing I would do differently next time is add some peppercorns to the crock pot.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I loved this recipe ... best ham I've ever made!  Not a fan of cloves, so I left them off.  Also didn't have any nutmeg and I kept the ginger to a minimum .... but was really happy with the results:  very tender, moist and wonderfully delicious!  

Also, for those who found the ham dry, try cooking it loooooonger, ten hours, on a lower heat setting ... that makes all the difference in the world!  Also, make sure you use apple CIDER and NOT apple juice or especially apple cider VINEGAR!  Someone gave this recipe a bad review because they used apple cider VINEGAR (must not have read the recipe carefully!)  .... uh yeah: apple cider vinegar would be AWFUL!  No need to marinate this overnight either:  just add the ingredients into the crock pot with the ham right when you make it.  Make sure you also fill the crock pot with as much apple cider as you can to cover as much of the ham as possible.  So GOOD!

Sooo good!! Made it for xmas supper, then used the frozen leftovers and juices for another xmas family supper a week later! Everyone loved it! I did however use the measurements more as guidelines. I don't think i put quite as much cider in. And adding in a little more syrup and brown sugar  after I flipped it part way through to let the top soak it up. Yum! Will keep this as a go to recipe for ham. It definitely fell apart it was so juicy

I’ve made this recipe 3 times using pre-cooked spiral cut. The first time it turned out wonderful and everyone raved about it just like the positive reviews on this site. The portion above the liquid had dried out considerably but the portion within was very moist and flavorful. I thought I had hit the jackpot with a super easy way to set it and forget it while I get everything else ready.   The second time I made it- it turned out extremely dry. Yesterday we had a large holiday party and I so I thought I’d give it a third try. I cut the crock pot time to 4.5 hours on low for a 9.5 lb piece. The resulting ham was dry - above and below the liquid.... such a disappointment. It was hardly touched and now I have 9 lbs of dry ham to consume with my small family!

Had this for Thanksgiving along side the turkey and it was wonderful!  Moist and juicy and full of flavor! I used a bone-in, fully cooked spiral about 8 pounds. Only thing I did different was the cloves......   too inpatient to stick them all in so just put a bunch in cheesecloth and placed it into the apple cider.  I put it on high for an hour and then on low for about 4 to 5 hours.  Will definitely do it again......  thank you for a winner recipe!

I tried this recipe for the first time today and the only thing I changed was I used Cranberry ginger ale instead of apple cider since my friend is very allergic to apples.  It turned out fantastic!  I used the leftover juices and made a sweet glaze for the ham and veggies.  Very wonderful! I will make this again!  It was awesome!

Wonderful flavor, aroma and moistness!  Many compliments for Easter.  I did not use whole cloves.  Only had 1/2 cup of maple syrup, used a little regular syrup.  Will be making every Easter.
update:  second time I made it I used whole cloves and cooked it on a higher temp.  Dried out and clove flavor too strong.  I will definitely make again but make sure you go low and slow.

This was great - made it for Easter and everyone loved it. I used a 10 lb bone-in ham butt. Used all the ingredients according to the recipe except used more apple cider to the ham and left out the whole cloves (which my husband doesn't care for). There was plenty of clove flavor with the ground cloves. Everyone took home some leftovers and we had them the second night just cold, then the third night I diced up the rest and made hash. This one is a keeper!

I used a 4 lb smoked ham bone in. I cut the recipe in half, except for the apple cider. Mixed the spices in with the cider., and made sure the ham was covered. Cooked  on High for 3 hours. Turned out moist, and everybody loved it. Will make this again.

I made it with a spiral ham. It turned out bitter. Kinda like eating a lemon. I will try it again but not with a spiral ham as I seen in a few other reviews. The meat fell off the bone and it was juicy, just a bitter taste.

Try using a precooked spiral ham and cook on low for 2-3 hrs.  It only needs to warm up.  and this always comes out perfect.  6-8 hrs seems like a very long time for smoked/precooked ham

Made this for Christmas for 18 people who thought I couldn't cook. What a surprise when they tasted this! What was left people fought over to bring home with them. :)

We didn't care for it. The ham fell apart and it took on the color of the syrup. It was too clove tasting. If I made it again, I would cut back on seasonings and cook it way less time.

It was ok.  Not my favorite recipe.  It had an odd taste and smell and while it wasn't bad, I didn't care for it much.  I found that the ham came out dry.  

My hubby liked it and my daughter did not.  

I will not be making this again.

Made for holiday family dinner.  We wanted to like it but something with the spices no one did. Lots leftover, and none of us want it and there were about 20 of us.   Not worth the expense of the good apple cider I used.   Made exactly as recipe states including the bone in ham.  Think the cloves gave it a flavor we all hated.

Good ham.  I would suggest cutting back on the apple cider a bit as it was a little overwhelming.  I would also cut back on the nutmeg as it was a little strong.  I will make this again for sure.

It must be a  matter of taste, followed the recipe to a tee, clover flavor was overbearing, and though the ham was thoroughly submerged in the cider for the recommended cooking time, it  was dry immediately on serving.

Not worth the effort.  The flavor was okay, but the ham was drier due to the long time sitting in the juice.

I had intentions of slow cooking my ham, but my ham didn't fit in my crock pot :( So I used the same spices called in this recipe and baked it in the oven for 2 hours (11lb half ham). At an hour and 30 mins, I took it out and poured the maple syrup on it. It turned out really great. My cousin who brought home leftovers texted me 3 days later saying she was has been eating the ham since then for lunch and dinner. Haha.

This was a really juicy and flavorful ham.  I mixed everything together- only because I was in s rush and wanted to get this in the oven.  Yes, I used the oven, not my crock.  My ham was so huge...14 1/2 lbs!!  We really liked the flavor, however, next time I will cut way, way back on th ground cloves.   They were just too over powering.  I didn't have Apple Cider on hand so I used a crisp gala apple juice.

Made this for Christmas and it tasted wonderful. Will try again with less cloves  (didn't know I didn't like the taste of cloves ) and maybe cook for an hour less. Otherwise, this recipe is spot on.

I had high expectations for this recipe and may try again. Followed the directions exactly. This was way to Clovey, almost overpowering. Next time, will cut down on the cloves and probably the cinnamon as well. I used the Kentucky ham and submerged it til 2" were exposed. I Basted it every hour on the hour. I stored it in an airtight container and now is dry as Jerky.

The ham turned out dry and not very good.  I followed the directions very carefully and it turned out barely edible.  Very disappointed.

This was a big hit with picky teens!  My fifteen-year-old kept going back for more slices after finishing everything else on his plate.  It's very moist and flavorful.   We're looking forward to sandwiches and leftovers!

This would likely work with a bone in ham, but don't try it with a boneless ham like I did. I cut the cooking time but still ended up with a dried out ham that we will have to use in quiche and other casseroles - and ham is expensive these days!

I gave this four stars because while it is easy and delicious, it calls for an over abundance of spices and way too many cloves for the average person. Most will find that many cloves (which has a very pungent and strong flavor even in small doses) to be overpowering and ruin the ham. Unless you and all the people you will be serving this meal to enjoy a very, very strong clove taste with your food, cut the  amount called for back by half (at least). In fact, I cut all the ingredients in this recipe back by half (with the exception of the cider and the ham of course). I only cook mine on low for about 4 hours (I use a pre-cooked, spiral cut ham) and it is always moist and delicious.

Cook your pre-cooked ham (Cloverdale tear-drop ham @ 7 lbs.) ONLY @ 4 to 6 hours. Also, make sure that the entire ham is covered in the cider... anything not covered will be dry! I used @ 6 cups of cider...one more thing... MIX THE SPICES with the cider before you pour it in the crock pot. I only use @15-20 whole cloves, sometimes I don't stud it and omit them entirely.

Smelled awesome by 5-6 hour mark. Should have served it then. 7 hours is too long - started to burn in my crock pot. Maybe less ground cloves also.

I had a 7lb picnic ham and it had been so long since I cooked one,  I went looking for a recipe.  I was wary about the amount of spices and not a big fan of slow cooker meats.  I used half the amount of spices , skipped the vanilla and cooked on low 7 hrs.  The ham was moist, tender and flavorful.  Next time I will trust the recipe and try with the whole amount of spices.  Thanks to Reine for a real winner.  I served with Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes and Roasted Butternut Squash.  My guests were very happy.

This recipe turned out perfect.  I used a butt portion bone in ham.  It was very juicy, flavorful and delicious!  I would recommend a few less cloves if you wanted a little milder flavoring of this spice.  A keeper!

I'm so glad I found this recipe! It was so delicious and smelled amazing! This was my first time making easter dinner and really wanted to try a ham. I recently bought a crock pot and have made a couple of dishes before but this was by far the best! My boyfriend agreed! He raced about it all day and went back into the fridge later on just to snack on it lol It has so much flavor and is very tender! I will definitely be making this again in the future!

I made this recipe for the first time last year for Easter.  I will never make it any other way again.  Soooo good!!  And your house will smell delicious while it's cooking.  This is the one I tell everyone about.  I made it just as the recipe says.  I did leave out the ground cloves the next time.  That was just too much clove flavor for our taste.  Otherwise, BRAVO!!

I was all happy to see a spiral sliced ham in the picture only to have the recipe call for a bone in ham. Sadness on my part, but looks great otherwise!

Nice tasting - on try 2. At first I accidentally purchased a precooked ham... After following the rest of the recipe I had ham jerky.

This is excellent. I accidentally bought a pork joint, instead of a ham joint, and the meat turned out so delicious and succulent. Made for excellent BBQ pork the next day too. 

Looking forward to making the ham version tonight!

I really loved the scent of my house while this ham was cooking...and if you're looking for a great air freshener this is it lol.  As for flavour...a little too gingerbread for my taste.  Was ok, but won't be repeating....Update:  I lied. I repeated this one, and adjusted the seasonings, also switched the liquid to pineapple juice, was great then.  I really, really, liked having a crockpot ham, so couldn't give up on this one. Play around till you get the taste you want, but the method is wonderful.

Tried this for our Christmas Brunch yesterday.  I would never recommend putting a spiral cut ham into a slow cooker for 8-10 hours!  The ham was very tasty but fell apart and the presentation was awful!  I would only place a fully cooked ham in a slow cooker to heat through!  I was so happy that our guests were our best friends so I was not too embarrassed!!!!!!

It smelled amazing and tasted pretty good too, but I will make some modifications next time I make it. The cloves were a touch overpowering and sometimes there was just too much spice. I also think it got a little overcooked, but I was juggling a dinner for 8 that also included a turkey with only 1 oven and a stove that only half worked while attending classes and working, so I was a bit distracted. Worth another try, but modifications needed.

Hard to review this.  used less brown sugar (didn't have it...)  Had to supplement the apple cider with ginger ale, I needed more liquid.  It was good. But not my taste.  No ham taste, just lots of spices.  I like ham!  Not my cup of tea, but may be someone elses......

I had a "pre-cooked" ham and followed the recipe but the meat turned out very dry (and too sweet for my taste). Thankfully it was just my family and not guests and the sides we had were great.

Turned out great. I didn't have any cider, so added apple juice and cider spices. Very juicy. I never removed the cloves.. so I surprised some of my guests.. next time I'll take those out before serving. :) I'll make this every time I make ham from now on.

This ham is by far the best ham I've ever had. I made it today (Easter Sunday). It was juicy, tender and just delicious! In fact it was falling off of the bone before I could carve it. I followed the recipe exactly except I made one change...I used orange juice instead of apple cider (didn't have any) and it was fantastic! I have to wonder why other reviewers rated this recipe so poorly. Maybe the cut of meat? I don't know, but I used a butt. Maybe there's more fat to it...not sure. But it truly was the best ham we've ever had. My husband, 3-year-old and 4-year-old all agreed!

This came out amazing.  I used a pre-cooked ham and cut down on the cloves.  I make this all the time now!  My family loves it.

Very flavorful and easy! I cut back the spices in half and flavors still came through very strong. I used an 8.5 fully cooked spiral ham on low for 4 hours. I'll use this as my easter ham in years to come b/c I can put it in before church and its ready when I come home. Everyone loved it!

Like 94S girl, my ham turned out very dry. I halved the amount of cloves, and it still tasted like nothing but cloves. Very disappointed since this was our family's Easter ham.

I made this but cooked it longer than I was supposed too, but I loved the way it just shredded in big chunks. So tender. Now I am thinking about making BBQ with the leftovers. Thanks for the recipe.

I started cooking this last year and have made it a few times.  It's now a Christmas must along with the turkey.  Not only is it to-die-for delicious, but it smells devine.

It looks awesome, smells awesome and tastes awesome.  I used a smaller ham so what I did was only use half of the other ingredients. This is the best and easiest ham I have ever made.  thanks for sharing the recipe.
