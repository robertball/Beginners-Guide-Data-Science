I served this with a thyme and rosemary seasoned pork roast last night. I scaled it to four servings, as we are a small family. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband, who always said he "hates" rutabagas and parsnips, loved this recipe. He went back for thirds! My mother-in-law also loved this, and I will definitely make this again. Peeling all the vegetables was worth the effort.

I made this for Thanksgiving thinking it was rather risky because the potatoes would be "different." What a pleasant surprise! Even the kids loved the slightly different flavor and the potatoes were devoured. I made a double batch, so I sat down in front of the TV the night before and peeled my heart out. That's the only drawback, those nasty rutabaga and turnip skins. Buts it's worth it.

Was looking for a different mashed potato recipe to serve with our annual New Years Eve Lamb roast and found this one. It was perfect. The only changes I made was to cut back on the butter and instead added a little of the leftover broth to the mashed vegetables. I also sauteed the onion in mostly olive oil with a tablespoon of butter. Just Hubby and I and we loved this, but I plan to make a big batch for my next family potluck!

This was an experiment, not just for us but also for the dinner guest we had this evening – something I would never recommend doing!  I got so lucky on this!  We didn’t just tolerate this, or even just like it.  This was a real hit – for all of us.  Fairly even amounts of the potato, rutabaga and parsnips ensured that each would contribute to create a new flavor all its own - and oh, what a wonderful flavor it was.  The “icing on the cake” was the caramelized onions on the top. What a rich and lovely finish, but you MUST let them cook slowly for a good, long time until they truly are golden brown and caramelized.  I half-heartedly made this as an alternative to mashed potatoes with our roast beef and gravy dinner tonight. While the entire dinner was perfect and delicious, this side dish single-handedly took my dinner from JUST delicious to exquisite.

I served this last night with steak. I think everyone liked it ok, but no one raved about it. I used potatoes,parsnips,and turnips. Was a little pesky to peel everything, but otherwise easy and I did make it ahead and reheat it. I still think it is a nice fall sidedish.

I scaled the recipe to suit the smaller number I was cooking for.  I have made it a couple of times and think it is a great fall/winter dish - a change from 'mashed potatoes again!'.  Haven't made ahead yet but have used lefovers as a topping on shepards pie delish.

I was really excited about trying this one for a twist at Thanksgiving.  The taste was okay, but the chunks of rutabaga were rock hard even after cooking and it was stringy.  Nobody ate it, so I won't be making it again.

A great recipe with that distinctive taste of rutabaga.  Instead of the parsnips, my wife substituted carrots.  Fantastic results.  The added flavor and texture of the carrots made it an instant favorite.  With the carmelized onions on top and baked till piping hot; it make a great dish to  accompany main course such saugage, pork loin, lamb,; etc.

I have made this dish for Thanksgiving now four years in a row so I thought it might be time to write a review. My mother-in-law always specifically asks me in advance about whether I am going to make this because she has come to look forward to it. One of our guests this year said it was the best thing on her plate. The parsnips and rutabaga give the potatoes a sweet/savory twist that is really tasty--different but not too different. This year I spaced out and boiled the vegetables in water instead of broth, and it was still as good as ever, so if necessary, you can omit the broth, I think. Caramelized onions really can't be beat, and in this dish they compliment the flavor perfectly. I caramelized a huge vidalia onion this year and it was awesome. I think that this recipe deserves to be a popular favorite.

Fantastic! This is my new dinner party staple. Unable to find parnips, I substituted sweet potato.

I didn't use parsips, used more rutabaga,  or the clove but dish was excellent and so healthy! I baked over browned pork chops and it was delish!

Got compliments at a holiday dinner. Was a nice alternative to plain mashed potatoes. I likely wouldn't make it frequently since rutabagas are so difficult for me to chop.

My grocery store was almost out of parsnips so I also added in a white sweet potato.  My only other change was that I accidentally put in too much butter...oh darn!  This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!  We're adding into into our meal every year and I'll probably make it again soon since I didn't have enough leftovers to satisfy!  You must make sure everything is very tender..the potatoes will soften first so be patient.  I think I'll broil it right at the end next time to get the top a little more crispy too.

A flavourful variation on the standard mashed potato and a great addition to the holiday turkey dinner. I like that it can be made a day ahead of time and leaves vegetable stock for the gravy to be made the next day.

I accidentally made it with half the butter and we still were talking about how savory and satisfying this dish was.  We had left overs and since we aren't vegetarians, we browned up some 93% lean ground beef and shredded 3 oz of Tillamook Cheddar cheese and sprinkled both on top of the left overs and baked it for about 35 minutes and 375 degrees.  It was delicious again but in a different way, kind of like a Shepard's Pie.  The dish was wonderful and we will make it again!

Delicious new twist on potatoes. I was mostly glad that my family didn't take a bite and ask what was in it... the rutabaga and parsnips add a very subtle flavor change. However, the star of the show was the caramelized onions. I will definitely do those again on mashed potatoes!

Made this tonight and I think I could have eaten the casserole myself! Delish! Did it just as instructed but without the parsnips because I had none....will try again with them. This is so yummy and I highly  recommend it even if you've never eaten rutabagas this is THE WAY to try them!

I have made this recipe for years. I make it with the apricot glazed Turkey and it is simply amazing! My favorite and my family looks forward to it each year! Don't skimp on the broth. It's worth using it to boil the veggies! You will fall in love!

I have made this several times and still find it hard to not eat the whole thing!!!!  Since I am just one person, I adjust the amounts accordingly but almost any combo works:  today I added carrots because I did not have enough of the others.  I also make at least double the amount of caramelized onions because, well, they are so evilly good!!!!  You don't really have to "bake" the casserole since the veggies are already cooked. I like the addition of a bit of nutmeg to the mixture.  Licking the spoon and the beaters is one of my favorite parts of the recipe......
