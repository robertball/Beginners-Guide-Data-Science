The first thing my husband noticed when he walked in the house was that it smelled just like the restaurants around the spice markets of Morocco! Though, he said, and I agree, that it was even fresher and better than any Moroccan dish, add some mint green tea and the traditional dessert of sliced oranges sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and this may be your new favorite dish!

This recipe was delicious!  I did have to add a little more broth than what was called for and I used 2 tsp. ground cinnamon instead of a stick and doubled the cumin.  I didn't have any couscous, so we ate it as is and really enjoyed it.  It even went over well with my 2 and 5 year old.

This recipe is AWESOME!  Not only did everyone in our family love it (even the pickiest eaters), but I recommended it to a friend, and her family loved it, too.    Some suggestions:  use fresh mint instead of cilantro as a topper.    Use brown rice instead of couscous (especially with the left overs, when you run out of couscous, as we did!)  I doubled the recipe and had so much left over, we were eating it for at least a week.    Note for meat eaters: you can add meat if you like, but trust me, no one will miss it!

Stew was hearty and savory just like stew should be. You can easily adjust the recipe or make leftovers last longer by adding pine nuts, golden raisins, etc.   My couscous was bland and stuck together. So, when making more for leftover stew, I sauteed minced garlic in 3 tbsp. olive oil, then added the water, brought to a boil, and added couscous. The couscous had garlic-olive oil flavor, and had much better texture than the first batch.

Great starting recipe. I added a carrot, few sprigs of thyme, 2 bay leaves a cup more vegetable stock and a teaspoon or so of tumeric. I omitted the topping. I prefer this as a soup rarther on top of the cous cous mainly because when i put it on the couscous it lost its flavour because the veggies didnt have the chance to absorb all the flavour in the short cooking time, but as a soup / stew alone it is yummy! It is one of those recipes I will make again because I always have those ingredients on hand.

Absolutely lovely! I was out of chickpeas so I sauteed brown lentils with the onion mixture, and it turned out wonderfully. But I'll make sure to have chickpeas on hand next time to see what it was intended to taste like! We have a large music teaching studio in our home, and my partner's students were in heaven because of the smell.

The house smells delicious! I didnt have canned tomatoes, so i used two cans of tomato paste. Turns out the stew was rich and thick!!!! Loved it on a bed of couscous or quinoa.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some butternut squash. I like Moroccan food so I thought I would give this a try. I substituted 1/2 cup of raisins for half the olives to give this some sweetness as Moroccan dishes usually have. I found I needed to add more cumin and some ground cinnamon along with the cinnamon stick because it was bland. I also didn't like the potatoes in this. I've never had potatoes in a Moroccan or Middle Eastern dish and they threw off the texture and flavor of the dish for me. To keep this vegan, I skipped the yogurt and added toasted pine nuts. I also substituted mint for the cilantro. Overall, not a "wow" in our family. We'll finish the leftovers  but I won't be making this dish again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish; it was flavorful and satisfying. I did take some of the advice of other reviewers and added a can of tomato paste and 1 tsp. of ground cinnamon instead of using a cinnamon stick. I did cut the potatoes and squash in 2 inch pieces. As a result, the cooking time was much longer than specified. When I make this again, I will cut them in bite-sized pieces and alter the cooking time proportionately. For the couscous I sauteed garlic in a tsp. of olive oil then added the water and couscous. Overall, a great recipe.

Overall, a good solid dish. I would hit it w/ some sweetness; like adding, raisins, dried apricots, or a raisin-onion relish.

The aroma of this stew cooking is as delicious as the taste! I would add a little more broth but not change anything else.

I loved this! If you're having vegans/vegetarians over for dinner and don't know what to serve, don't hesitate to go with this. I visited a friend who was doing just that, and it was perfect. She doesn't like lemon so I think she left the zest out and just squeezed a bit over the cilantro at the end, and served yogurt on the side. I'd leave out the olives but that's personal taste. Served with a salad of butter lettuce, slivered almonds, and pomegranate seeds and bread sticks and followed by a fig-cranberry-honey compote with almond ice cream, regular ice cream, or greek yogurt as preferred. It was a wonderful meal!

This was pretty good but you do need to kick up the spices IMO.  It was a little bland to me, but I still gave it 5 stars because I did not add the couscous.  It may have been heartier with that.  I did add cauliflower and spinach though, yum.

A good, easy to fix meal for working families.  The cilantro was a nice touch; I might omit the olives in favor of raisins next time.  My wife and young teen both enjoyed it.

i made this for my husband and he really liked it. he is not a big fan of exotic foods.  however this went over well.    changes: i used regular potatos rather than red potatos.    i added one extra cup of vegetable broth in addition to the 2cups.    i used the cinnamin stick but also added 1/2 TBSP of cinnamin.    i also added one extra TBSP of ground cumin.    i used 1TBSP of pepper and 1/2 TBSP of salt.    i used only 1/2 the ammount of olives because my husband doesnt care for them.  but i think he actually liked them in this dish.    i bought plain, pitted olives in water and sea salt, so they were mild in flavor.    i also added a bit of the olive juice to the stew just for added flavor.  i still feel like it could have used something more, but overall it was a great new recipe to try and i will make it again!

This is a very good, hearty stew.  I omitted the cilantro and olives because I hate them.  Each portion was seasoned with salt to make up for the lack of the olives.

I've made this several times and have found that I prefer it with extra lemon zest and extra garlic.  It is especially good with the yogurt on top, but if you can't have dairy, it's also good with coconut milk instead.

I did not want to have a lot of clean up this evening so I made this in the crockpot and it was very good.  I did add a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in addition to the stick and 3tsp of cumin instead of 2 and a bit more water(as previous reviews suggested). I did not have potatoes so I did not use any and used 2 cans of chick peas to make it meatier.  Delish. Will make again.

Carb-loaded comfort food. My husband and I prefer spicy dishes with complex flavors. Even after adding generous amounts of dried hot peppers to our individual servings, this was a relatively uninteresting dish. If (that's a pretty big if) I were to make this again, I would use more flavorful veggies. Perhaps carrots and cauliflower in addition to the butternut squash. Golden raisins would also be a nice touch. And if you're not a vegetarian (I'm not), I'm sure chunks of stewed beef would do a lot for this dish.

I currently live in Israel and we recently signed up for weekly deliveries from an organic vegetable farm from up north.  When they brought us a ton of potatoes and a huge butternut squash, I had few ideas about what to do with it...this was delicious and filling!  I had no olives on hand (yes, embarassing to admit, living in this country), but it was tasty without it as well!  I also used a bit of ground cinnamon instead of the stick, and I think it added the right amount of flavor.  Yum!

Yummy!  Olives, lemon, yogurt and cilantro really finished it off nicely.  The only problem was the potatoes took much longer than 20 minutes to cook.  Next time I will sautee them first before anything else, or microwave them first...

Very good for a cold night. Plus it makes a lot that you can save for the next day. This is a perfect way to feed someone veggies... my bf didn't know it was vegetarian until the third helping!

Great recipe!  Had to leave out the olives, lemon zest, and cilantro since I didn't have those on hand.  I added an extra cup of vegetable broth because 2 cups weren't enough and a teaspoon of ground cinnamon (in addition to the stick).  The flavor is wonderful.

This was an easy dish, only time consuming thing was dicing everything, but it cooked up fast. I used quinoa instead of couscous which increased protein in meal. Family loved it!!!

Will make again. I served with sourcream and harissa mixed and topped with a mixture of chopped cilantro and fresh mint. Served on Lebanese couscous (Moghrabieh). Super tasty!

Good base to adjust as you like for seasoning and what you have on hand. I followed it pretty closely, and like others, I had to double the cumin and used ground cinnamon in higher dose than the cinnamon stick (2 tsp?). In the end, I added ketchup to thicken it up a little, used about 1/2 tsp of dried orange rind I had, threw in about 1/4 cup raisins,  two dashes of lemon juice and a dash each of cayenne, coriander, all spice, and ginger. After that, it was much more flavorful.

Husband and I thought it was delicious and had unique favors, different from the usual. Filling meal, too. Would make it again. Wonder if it would freeze well?

A good hearty vegetarian recipe. I had some cubed butternut waiting to be used, plus two chayote squash. I doubled the recipe, and between the two squashes, had nearly 2 lbs. I did not double the onion or garlic. Definitely recommend using golden raisins with the olives, rather than doubling the olives. Like others, I omitted the potatoes and used ground cinnamon. Mint was a good suggestion; we had both mint and cilantro. One thing that I think helped give it a better texture: use an inversion blender if you have one, before adding the olives and raisins.  Whir it a bit until the color is a bit more opaque and creamy. We found the spice levels a bit mild, so added our favorite hot sauce.

I liked this but didn't love it and I'm not sure why.  Reading the recipe sounded like something I would really love but for some reason I felt it was off. Not sure why. I have to say that I love olives but they didn't taste good in this recipe. Not a big deal because you can just push them aside. This did taste better the next day so maybe the flavor just needed to mesh longer. Not sure if I'll make it again.

I like it, nice clean taste, but I have to say there is something missing. Maybe add some tomato paste, or some other personal tweak. I bet you could sub the Butter Nut Squash with Sweet Potato. To get all the ingredients was a little expensive. I'm going to give it a shot again one of these days.

Great recipe! I ate mine over white rice and left out the olives. All of my friends and even my husband loved this hearty vegetarian dish.

It was a good recipe but lacked a bit of flavor.  I ended up adding extra cumin for a kick.  Also, the amount of liquid is not enough.  After the specified cooking time, the liquid was absorbed and wasn't really a stew anymore.   It is a great base for making it your own.
