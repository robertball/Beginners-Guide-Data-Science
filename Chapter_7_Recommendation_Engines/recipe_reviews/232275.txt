I've never written a review and made lots of things of this site but I had to with this! These are fantastic! I made a couple changes because they were for my 21 month old. I used all whole wheat flour, brown sugar instead of Splenda. I did not use any nutmeg, nuts, lemon or orange zest and still delicious! Even if I had the orange or lemon zest I don't think I'd add it next time. Next time I think I would try to sneak in some parsnip like another reviewer did. The only mistake I made was putting them in muffin liners and they definately stuck so using just the pan and spraying or greasing would work much better. My only regret was I halved the recipe (I was worried he wouldn't eat them) I would definately double it next time because he loved them!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe :)

I liked these muffins, but it took me over an hour for all the shredding and measuring - maybe I'm just slow?  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and substituted pecans for walnuts.  The muffins were pretty tasty, though not as sweet as I somehow expected.  My son thought they had too many veggies, but he still gobbled them up!

My 3 yr old daughter and I made these today and they turned out fantastic! She's already eaten two and asking for more. I LOVE that this recipe is health conscious. I always try to put the best food into my kids tummy's. Only thing I did differently was used brown sugar instead of the sucralose because I didn't have any and used pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg and allspice. Highly recommend!

Very easy to make with a food processor. I made mini muffins (1/2 the recipe) and the recipe worked fine for mini muffins. Definitely need to spray the muffin paper cups with spray - I did not and they stuck. Very tasty, nice texture, my 5 year old loved them. I can't wait to put one in her lunch box every day for a healthy snack. By the way, I had a parsnip so I added shredded parsnip and some powdered ginger for even more good health. The only reason I would not rate 5 stars - I am not a fan of orange zest and I can definitely taste it. I will make these again!

These are spectacular! I didn't have the brown sugar blend so I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. Also I used large muffin pans and just cooked them the same and it ended up making 9 (giant!) muffins. This recipe is a keeper!

These muffins are great! Just the right amount of sweetness for a healthy-style muffin. I read everyone's' reviews and made adjustments. It was a melting pot of everyone's ideas. So instead of the sucralose mix, I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar (next time I want to replace the white sugar with honey); instead of the apple sauce, I used canola oil;  instead of the walnuts, I used dark chocolate chips. I also replaced 1/2 cup of white flour with 1/2 cup of oat. It was delicious!!!  Now we have breakfast for a week+!

I simply left the sucralose out and the muffins were sweet enough yet entirely too heavy.  There's just too much flour. I would make  these again but adjust the wheat to plain flour ratio.

Delicious! I used a food processor to puree the veggies and apple. I used a cup of white/brown sugar blend as I don't like artificial sweeteners. I baked for 20 minutes. They are moist, substantial, and perfect for breakfast and snacks. My kids and husband loved them!

Muffins are very good. You can tell they are  not made with real sugar, but with the apples in the muffins it definitely makes up for it.  They taste healthy and you donâ€™t have to feel too guilty about eating one of these muffins.  They are a healthy alternative.

These are delicious!  A hit with me and my friends.  

Next time I will also try a version using all whole wheat flour.

My daughter is 6 and still picky about seeing vegetable "pieces" in the dough so I will also try pureeing the carrots and zucchini after they're shredded, next time.

I liked these, but changed a few of the proportions after reading some of the reviews. I used what I had on hand - 1/2 zucchini, 1 carrot, 1 apple, 3.25% plain yogurt, regular milk and a regular brown sugar/white sugar mix. I also omitted the nuts. I then cut the flour to  2.25 cups of white flour and added 3/4 cup of bran. All in all these turned out to be moist and flavourful and will make them again this way. I think they can easily be adjusted to your personal taste.

As far as a healthy, more savory muffin goes - this one is pretty good!

I did swap out 1/3 of the flour for oats, and also because I did not have applesauce, I added oil instead.

I read from other reviewers that they had cut back on some of the sugar, so I did the same - but I think that I would have liked mine a little bit sweeter, so next time I will use the full amount!

For a healthy muffin - I'm quite happy!

Love these muffins!  It's a great way to get my picky 1 years old to eat some veges.  You can't even taste the veges in them!  I wouldn't recommend making the full batch unless you have several people eating them because they don't keep very long.

Made these again, cutting the recipe in half and this time my son wanted to make some in a mini tin with miniature chocolate chips.  They tasted great!  Next time I will add chocolate chips to the whole batch.

These are so yummy! My 4 year old, that refuses to eat vegetables and throws a complete temper tantrum when they are on her plate, gobbled them up. Even though she helped me make them and knew what was in them. I was shocked. The lemon and orange zest really make them perfect.

I will definitely make this again.  I substituted real brown sugar for the sucralose blend and will cut that down to 3/4 cup next time.  I also added 3/4 cup wheat bran and reduced the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  I baked them 5-10 minutes longer than called for depending on my cup depths- one of my tins is much deeper than the other.  The deeper ones could have used another 5 minutes extra, therefore 15 minutes more than called for.  Moist, yummy muffins which are relatively healthy-a winning combination!

These were good, but I made a few changes.  (I didn't add the lemon or orange zest and just used regular sugar, 1 Cup for 24 muffins.  And I substituted oil for apple sauce, in equal amounts.)  The muffins did stick to the muffins papers the first day but not anymore on the 2nd day after baking them. For a family of 4, I would make the full recipe of 24 muffins.

Delicious, healthy, and fluffy. Thanks for the recipe! I modified and used almond meal in place of the wheat flour, honey in place of apple sauce, and used the walnut as a crumble topping with brown sugar instead.

I baked for the alloyed time and tested with a skewer. All came out clean. I went to remove one from the pan and they simply broke to pieces. It's far too moist inside, and they have all sunken in the middle.

Awesome recipe! It did take me longer to shred all the ingredients..so allow some extra time! I wanted to do some sort of veggie muffin for my toddler and she LOVED them! THANKS! This recipe is a keeper!!
