THis recipe has possibilities...Personally, I did not like the grahm bottom and the directions should be diferent...not mixing the butter and crumbs and pressing into the bottom of the pan makes it a very crumbly bottom bar!  I think I would consider grinding gingersnaps to make a crust with melted butter for better flavor!  I would have loved an extra apple as well.  The only thing I added was about 4 Tbl. of cinnamon chips because I was short on the butterscotch!  I will try them again, my way.

I thought this was great!  I tried it out at a party, and everyone loved it!  Would definately make it again,  I used Granny Smith apples on it for the sweet and tart contrast.

I have been making this for years in the fall BUT I always make it with chopped pears!  It is absolutely scrumptious (as I'm sure it would still be with apples)!

The idea of apple and butterscotch chips is good, but the sweetened condensed milk makes this WAY too sweet... 

Didn't hold well too... The crust became soggy...

Won't make again!

I took the advice of Mnikolaisen and mixed the crumbs and butter and patted into bottom of dish, so the crust was not too crumbly.  I used chopped pecans mixed with the coconut on top. Also I used 4 apples instead of 2. Just made it for a Thanksgiving dessert and everyone loved it. Served it with a dollop of whipped cream on top.
