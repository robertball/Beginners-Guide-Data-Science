I'm rating this a 5 for it's awesome potential, not becuase it was at all what I expected it to be.  "Soup" is very misleading.  I think I will make this often and use it to serve with plain non-fat yogurt, which will make a great snack, breakfast, or even a lunch.  Right now I am eating it for lunch with plain yogurt and a cut up banana.  Yum!  It's very sweet and very thick -- I don't think I would eat it alone.  Also, for all you first-time makers: be assured that it thickens up ALOT as it is chilling -- you do not have to get it completely thickened by cooking it (you will be cooking forever if you try).  All in all, I'm very pleased with a healthy and tasty alternative, thank you for giving me something that I would never have discovered otherwise!

My kids were lukewarm on this one, until I doubled the barley and added a couple of pureed bananas!  Now, the entire family enjoys this for breakfast.  Thanks for sharing it!

Pretty good. Adding some fresh fruit gives it a little bit more flavor.

This recipe is great as is.  I like to experiment and tried it with bananas- not so good.  Although I substituted peaches & mangos for the raspberries, cherries & raisins and it was VERY good.  I use half the sugar when I make this and I like it.  This is a fantastic recipe to personalize after you've made it once or twice.  Time consuming, but worth the effort for the price and health- factors.

Very different type of recipe, great for a quick breakfast with a piece of toast or a half bagel! I liked it although I was skeptical at first when I read the recipe.

A good soup, but it's very sweet.  Use a lot less sugar so that you're not eating so much sugar for your breakfast.

This is a really nice change of pace. I especially think the cold fruit "soup" would be great on hot summer mornings. I topped it with toasted, mixed nuts and a little cream.

I adapted this recipe based on what I had on hand and it worked out really well.  I didn't have any pearl barley so I used 3-4 Tablespoons of instant tapioca. I cut the water to three cups and used 3/4 C of Splenda instead of sugar.  I kept the fruit at the same amounts.  This cooked pretty quickly. I put the tapioca, water, raisins, and raspberries  in a microwaveable container, and microwaved for about 10 minutes, stirring every five minutes.  Then cooked for about another five minutes until it boiled.  Then I added the cherries. It was still pretty thin because it thickens as it cools and the raisins disappeared completely.  Will definitely make again.

I just didn't love this. It was not what I imagined it would be. First, definitely not a soup. It's a breakfast mash or porridge. It got really old after eating it for a couple breakfasts. Then I started warming it up and adding some milk, which made it better, but not great. As it is, it's expensive (cherries and frozen raspberries aren't cheap) and not that great for the price. Maybe substituting other kinds of fruit, like other reviewers suggested, would help, but I don't plan on checking.

I was camping and didn't have barley. But I dis have a box of "Raisin Bran" cereal flakes. This works nicely with any berry combination, (sugar accordingly). The flakes cook much faster too.
