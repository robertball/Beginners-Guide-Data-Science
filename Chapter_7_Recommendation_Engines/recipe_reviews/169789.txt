As a greek american living in Greece just a few suggestions.  Make sure you drain as much juice from the cucumber before mixing.  Use then about a 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil in the mixture to smooth it out.  In Greece no one uses mustard so that is up to taste of anyone.  It is best if it sits about 8 hours in fridge and put a piece of loaf bread on top so it will soak up extra moisture from cucumber.  Remove bread before serving.

Just like the sauce served at our favorite restaurant. I prefer this sauce over similar recipes because it is made with sour cream instead of yogurt. I used English cucumber and fat free sour cream. It was divine. I want to eat it on everything.

A++ I used one cup plain Greek yogurt, 16 oz of lowfat sour cream (I accidently bought low fat), 2 single cloves of fresh garlic pressed, one regular cucumber (de-seeded) half grated and half diced up tiny - we like the added texture and a couple dashes of garlic-salt... so it was sort of a double batch... LOVED this.  I could and will make this 1000 times and eat it on everything.  Thank you for your recipe.

This is an excellent gyros dip, very close to what I grew up eating in Cicero/Chicago.  I added thin sliced onion to mine and it completed the taste for me.

I liked the fact that I had everything on hand to make this, but I really prefer the yogurt based gyro sauce. This is great in a pinch, though!

I wasn't sure about the sauce with sour cream but it was very good. I followed the hints of others and cut out the seeds of the cucumbers and after I grated them I squeezed them out with a paper towel. It made a difference in my sauce. One of my complaints about homemade tzatziki is the way it gets watery. With this technique it didn't get watery at all and I made it over an hour before we ate. Thanks for this recipe.

Not bad. I subbed 1/2 c. yogurt for 1/2 c. of the sour cream, and added a Tbl. of sugar, as well as some feta cheese, crumbled. I shoulda thrown it all in the blender, b/c I like a thinner sauce. This recipe was simple, and it was okay, but I may still use another recipe if I have more time on my hands next time.

We loved it.  But, I think it would be healthier and maybe even tastier with yogurt.  We'll try that next time.

I omitted the mustered and added some finely minced onion.  It was as good as the Greek Gyros palce we go to all the time.

I was looking for a way to make a Gyro sauce that did not call for yogurt since I had none on hand and I did not want to make a trip to the local market. I came across this, and I am glad I did. I liked it very well. I did not have the fresh dill either so I was forced to improvise. I usually make recipes EXACTLY as directed the first time, but was not able to this time.  So I used 1/4 tsp dry dill weed instead.  It turned out great. Thank you for posting a simple way to make gyro sauce when you don't have or don't want to use yogurt.

This reminded me of a Greek restaurant back home. Oh yum. I made it per the recipe. It was great. Then I made a second batch with added garlic, onion and that came out great. This is a great BASE recipe.

I did not use the mustard. Recipe had a good flavor, but was still "off" of what I am used too. But overall a good recipe.

I  also use yogurt instead of sour cream (who needs the calories!)
After peeling the cuke, I cut it it chunks & put it in my food chopper/processer. I, then put it in a metal strainer and squeeze the juice out. This works for me and my family loves it. I hope this is helpful.

Exactly what I wanted, thanks for a great recipe.  I used 2 cucumbers and after shredding them put them in a dish towel and twisted it to remove as much "water" as possible. That is my only hint, the rest was wonderful!

It's a great base recipe! I added just a little salt to taste. I run mine through the nurtibullet, so it's a little thinner than if you'd used greek yogurt. It's great on gyros, salads and turkey pita sandwiches. Thank you for sharing!

Love this recipe! I only gave it a 4 star though because I don't follow it exactly. I used another review to make some adjustments and it's amazing. No mustard, strain and deseed the cucumber. We like dill so we add 1tsp. Def. let set for at least 4hr, but overnight is the best, so flavorful!

I served this with the Feta Cheese Turkey Burgers from this site and it was great. I did not add the mustard or feel the need to add garlic powder since I used fresh garlic already.  Also had to substitute dry dill for the fresh which I know is not as good but we still liked it.  I blended it all in my food processor.

First of all, I hate cucumbers. I was wary of gyros and the sauce! But they need each other, and the sauce (cucumbers and all) made the whole meal. I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, so it was somewhat nutritious, too. Nice, light, and flavorful. Just perfect! Thanks for sharing!

I found this recipe and made it right away. At first I didn't add the dill and it was really good; now that it is in it's even better. Great with falafel and pita or nan bread.

This recipient was great! I used it in conjunction with Chef John’s flank steak, added some Naan bread, literally whipped it up right before we ate and it was delicious - a twist on the traditional gyros. Next time I’ll prepare it ahead and see what happens. I did exchange the sour cream for Greek yoghurt as I don’t use sour cream, but otherwise it was made as described less the overnight sit.

I followed the suggestion and left out the mustard and added a 1/2 cup of EVOO. I also added some salt to taste. The family loved it on the Gyros we had, even our picky eater!

I used dried dill and garlic instead of fresh.  This is so easy and delicious.  I taste tested it as soon as I had it mixed... it's yummy!  I am going to use it on grilled chicken wraps with dinner.

Would definitely make this again! Both my Husband and I loved it! Made a couple of changes to it: omitted the mustard and added a small Vidalia onion, grated and also a quarter cup of extra virgin olive oil. Marinated overnight. It was so awesome. Served it on a grilled chicken pita with tomatoes and then the next night with shrimp soft tacos.

Good, not great. Didn't realize how much I needed to drain from the cucumbers before making and it turned out runny. I will try again now that I know this and see how it turns out.

I used Greek yogurt and drained the cucumber as others suggested. So yummy!  This was the first time I ever made any kind of cucumber sauce. I will be making this again and again.

I used stone ground mustard and a small amount of crushed garlic for my tastebuds. Went to City Market for most of the ingredients.  Will try Greek yogurt next time.

This sauce is better than any other I have had either in a restaurant or store. It is very fresh tasting.  The only thing I changed was I added a couple squirts of lemon.

Used 1/4 tsp dried dill instead of fresh.  Delightful!  Oh, and I processed the cucumber in the blender instead of shredding.

I tweaked this recipe a little by, after grating the cucumber, squeezing the water from them because what wasn't used was really watery the next day, and I also only used fresh garlic, no garlic powder, and added a dash of salt to taste.  But it was really good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Used all ingredients, but added a little more sour cream and olive oil. I did not have grader, so  put all ingredients in the blender and let it do the job--there were not any seeds left over or anything. Tasted great. I agree with the other people. If I were to make this often I might switch it up and use greek yogurt instead.
