I have been roasting fresh brussel sprouts and thought this would make a good way to continue into the warm weather.  Unfortunately, my first attempt came out poorly.  I did use fresh brussel sprouts instead of frozen, so that may have made a difference.  I found the cooking time indicated (10 minutes) to be WAY too short for my taste. Even at 20 minutes of roasting, they were still not cooked to my taste.  I will try it again - possibly using frozen sprouts, or soaking or microwaving fresh to improve cooking time and flavor.  My old stand-by method - "steam-roasting" in the oven (adding a couple tablespoons of water and covering) first for 15 minutes and then roasting on the top shelf of the oven is still the best, though, in my opinion.

I am a BS Fanatic! Started sipping Limoncello while I was grilling and forgot to cut them in half, hee hee. Drizzled a little grapeseed oil instead of the butter, lol blame adult sippy cup again;)// So I grilled them a bit then nuked them for about 5 minutes. They were very good, snacked on them with fish tacos. Thank you Chef Clay:)

We loved this! I didn't cut the smaller ones in half. Brushed with olive oil instead of butter, but drizzled a little butter on them when done. Freshly ground sea salt is good on these, too!

Followed recipe to the T, except we use a charcoal grill which is not quite as hot as gas, so it took a bit longer for me to cook these. They were still a bit firm for my tastes, but hubby really liked them.  The flavor was great, but cooking times will vary depend on what type of grill you are cooking on.  We used fresh veggies, so not sure if this might be a factor in the outcome than maybe using frozen brussel sprouts.

I think grilling just makes everything taste better. This rates up there with the best in Brussel sprouts.

Loved the idea of grilling Brussels sprouts! They were a little bland but otherwise pretty good. I cooked them longer than 10 minutes, mainly because the sprouts I had were very large. I threaded them on kabobs making it easier to flip them all at once and to prevent them from rolling around the grill. Worked beautifully! Definitely will grill them again thank you for the technique!

I think these would have been fantastic...if they weren't so peppery!  I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing - I didn't put them directly on the grill grates, but in a grill bowl on the grill.  It took just a little longer to cook, but otherwise the process was the same.  All of us except my super-spicy-food-loving son had to pull off the other leaves in order to eat them.  I will try these again, just with MUCH less pepper!

I made this for Easter and was a huge success.  I had a lime but forgot to use it.  Dang.   Everyone also loved the wasabi sauce.

These were delicious. I used EVOO instead of butter and skipped the lime juice. To make them easier to grill I threaded them onto metal skewers.
I will definitely be grilling more brussels sprouts over the summer. Yum!

Not bad, but I've had better.  I found the amount of pepper too much for my taste. I used olive oil and good balsamic vinegar, so perhaps next time I'll just stick with the butter.

Used half a lemon. Didn't have lime. Used grilled tray so wouldn't fall in when turning.  Otherwise excellent!
