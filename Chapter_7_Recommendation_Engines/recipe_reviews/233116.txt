I tried this recipe on a whim, since I had blueberries and raspberries about to go bad. I followed all the ingredients to a T, and it turned out great! I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I cooked the berry mixture in a pan first, and then transferred it to a dish where I scooped the topping on top of it. I feel the topping didn't cover as much of the berries as I would've liked, since the berries were poking out from underneath all over the place, but I may have made the scoops too big. Word of advice, dish out small scoops to make sure you have enough to cover it all evenly. I would definitely do this recipe again; simple, easy, and verrrrrry good!

These were tasty! I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and baked in ramekins. I used blackberries in place of the blueberries (because that's what I had on hand). Any berry would work well in these! I found these to be not too sweet, which I liked. The tartness of the berries really shines through.

This was super yummy! I will be making this again and again with a few modifications. 

The first time I made it I used 2 cups blueberries, 3/4 cup raspberries, and 3/4 cup blackberries. I cooked the fruit in a saucepan instead of a cast iron skillet and baked it in an 8x8 glass pan. It was good but here are a few changes I will make the next time I make it.

I would cut the sugar in the filling down to 1/2 a cup instead of the 3/4. It was a little too sugary for my tastes. I would use brown sugar instead of white for the topping. I would also add some vanilla and/or cinnamon to the topping as well. Though the topping is yummy as is I think it could use a little more pizzazz.

Overall this is a great recipe and it works with any berry! Yum! And bonus this can be made dairy free and even gluten free if you use a GF flour!

When I can get my husband to eat fruit itâ€™s a 5 Star recipe. 
Very easy in whatever pan you make it in. I made a plain cheesecake to also serve it on.  Very good!

Easy enough to make, and a big enough hit, that I've made in twice in two weeks.  Great by itself or ala mode.  Used home grown raspberries and u-pick local blueberries.

Added frozen strawberries...no problem.  The pre-boiling step really  =helped it to hold together when done.

Tried it, and was wondering what to do with the 1/4 boiling water listed in the topping ingredients?  With no one to ask, I processed the dry ingredients and butter in my food processor, and then poured in the 1/4 cup boiling water gradually.  It lumped, and then after proceeding with the berry filling mixture, I placed spoonfuls of the "dough" on top, and baked it.  Turned out fine, so I must have done the correct thing.
