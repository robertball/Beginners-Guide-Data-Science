Made these for Recipe Group...Well, the name says it all...AMAZING!!!! Made these exactly as written, and would not change a thing. The combination of flavors w/ the texture of the cookie is truely addicting (I'm not even gonna say how many I've eaten already, lol)! These will definitely be on my Christmas cookie platters, as well as my favorite cookies list! SHORECOOK, you did it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are incredible! A coworker brought these into work and I just had to have the recipe. He directed me here and I was not disappointed. I didn't add the peanut butter chips and it still had plenty of peanut butter flavor. I also used a mix of semi-sweet and bittersweet chips because I didn't want them to be overly sweet. Amazing recipe that is sure to be crowd pleaser.

Amazing! Didn't have crunchy peanut butter so added some slivered almonds. WOW! Hubs liked them even without them being dipped in chocolate.

An incredibly delicious peanuty biscotti. The recipe is perfect! The dough was so easy to work with and baked up with bakery quality results. After I sliced my biscotti and returned them to the oven for 10 minutes on each side, when I turned the oven off I laid them on the oven rack and left the door open while they and the oven cooled to crisp them a little more. Once cooled I put the chocolate chips in a baggy to melt in the microwave as instructed smooshing the bag till the chips were melted, made a tiny snip on one end and drizzled the chocolate across in a zigzag pattern. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks SHORECOOK for sharing. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)

What a fabulous selection for the Recipe Group for 11/24/2012.   Shorecook never disappoints with her marvelous recipes.  These are very, very good â€“ too good in fact.  So much for dinner.  I made these exactly as stated and would not make any changes.  If you have a cookie swap coming up, you may want to make these.  People will love them!

Another 5 star recipe from Shorecook!  I had never made biscotti before and decided I would give this recipe a try. The crunchiness, the peanut butter flavor along with the melted chocolate chips made for a tasty cookie.  My whole house smelled sooo good while this was baking. For a more festive holiday look, I sprinkled decorative Christmas candies on top of the melted chocolate chips. A definite keeper and will be on my Christmas cookie tray. Thank you for this AMAZING recipe.  Christmas blessings to you and your family Shorecook!

I made these for Recipe Group.  This was my first time making biscotti, and this recipe turned out beautifully.  Next time, I may add just a few chocolate chips to the batter for a little extra chocolate, but this recipe really didn't need any changes.  I love the pairing of peanut butter and chocolate.  Yummy!

Results are good.  The only thing I was really worried about was my little mixer.  I have a hand mixer and this dough is so thick I was afraid I was going to burn out the motor!  The  dough was very sticky.  There was no way to roll it out.  I just took a big glob of it and put it on the silpat and shaped and patted it into a flattened rectangle.  I put two on each of two cookie sheets, one with a silpat and one with parchment.  After that, all went well.

Delicious! I had never made biscotti before this recipe. I really had fun with it, and enjoyed the process.  The recipe is well written and easy to understand. Cookies are fabulous! With my melted chocolate, it helps if it's good and warm, then I smoothed over the edge with a butter knife. These cookies were gone on 2 days in my house and only three of us are them! Thanks shorecook!

Definitely not a biscotti texture. It is more like a cookie than biscotti. Very thick and dry. Sorry, but would not make this again.

Recipe Group Selection:  24, November 2012 ~ SHORECOOK, this recipe is delicious!!!  5-stars for sure!  I have always wanted to make biscotti, but very leery of trying. With this being the RG selection this week, I knew now was the time.  So happy they chose your recipe.  Your instructions are so well written.  I dipped half of them in white chocolate and the other half in the semi-sweet dark as the recipe calls for.  Since I will be using some of them in Christmas baskets I added holiday sprinkles to some.  The end result is a nice crisp, but not hard biscotti.  Now that my fear has been lifted and biscotti have been crossed off my food "Bucket List" I look forward to trying other recipes.  Thanks SHORECOOK for boosting my confidence in making this delightful treat.

This is my first attempt at biscotti and it did not disappoint!  I didn't have the peanut butter chips and do not recommend leaving them out.  The texture and taste were spectacular, but because I didn't have the chips, my batch lacked more of the PB taste.  Will make again with the chips!

I have been baking biscotti, but certainly this is not it. I suggest to put it under cookies category because it's not. Anyone who calls this biscotti simply don't know how a real Biscotti taste like as like as far as texture is concerned and that sets it apart.

I don't believe I did anything wrong, but mine didn't come out quite right.  I halved the recipe, but otherwise kept it the same except for using creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy because that was what I had (oh, and chocolate chips in batter rather than PB).  Either way, my batter/dough came out kind of crumbly and would not hold together well.  My finished product was a bit dense for biscotti, and mostly ended up in pieces than slices, but those pieces did taste pretty good.
