Sweet, moist, cake-like cornbread that's absolutely fabulous! Plus it's so easy to put together using buttermilk baking mix (a.k.a Bisquick)! I did "tweak" this a bit to get more of a cornbread flavor. I used 2 & 1/2 cups of buttermilk baking mix and 3/4 cup of cornmeal. I do like a sweet cornbread, but I did cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet. I used 1 cup of buttermilk vs. milk and it baked up nice and golden brown in more like 35 minutes. This was oh so buttery and moist served nice and warm. The leftovers are great for breakfast served with jam!

This was like eating a moist cake.  Very delicious.  If it weren't so crumbly, I would call it the perfect cornbread.  I definitely will make this one again.  Thanks.  You can also try it this way, it's less crumbly and still good: 3 cups Bisquick, 2 cups milk, 1 1/4 cup sugar, 3 eggs, 2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp vanilla.  It's a Filipino receipe for Bibinka NOT cornbread but tastes the same as this recipe with a lot less crumbs.  You can add drops of creamcheese on top and sprinkle with sugar before cooking.  Yummy.  I'm eating it right now.

When I lived in Hawaii, we used to eat at the Yum Yum Tree restaurant specifically because their cornbread was so exceptional.  If this isn't their cornbread recipe, it's remarkably similar--and every bit as good.  Every time I make this cornbread, folks ask me for the recipe.  It's simply the best cornbread I've ever tasted.  I think if you try it, you'll agree!

I'll never make this again! I ate almost all of it by myself!  This tastes like a good moist cake.  My kids liked what little they got to taste.  It gets moister as it sits.  It's a little crumbly at first.

This was delicious.  I've been looking for a sweet cornbread recipe.  I was a bit unsure of what was meant by "buttermilk baking mix." Maybe pancake mix? I used Bisquick and it turned out fine.

Here are the changes I made on this recipe to make it lower in fat & calories (there was no way I could bring myself to use a cup of butter! Yikes!)As another suggested I reduced the baking mix (reduced fat) to 2 1/4 C. and incr. the cornmeal to 1 cup. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 c,substituted Egg Beaters for one of the 3 eggs, and used 1/4 c. melted butter & 1/2 c. Lite sourcream. They were very moist! To make 18 muffins fill "Pam" sprayed cups with 1/4 c. of batter and bake for 18-20 min. These were fantastic fresh out of the oven, and I'm anxious to see if they're even better tomorrow with my soup.

I liked the taste, although, I was expecting something a bit moister and it was also crumbly to eat. I will try it again..maybe I did something wrong.

Is is weird to say that this cornbread is...fun?  It is, though!  I had to substitute some non-fat buttermilk for the milk in the orig recipe, and I use a popular light margarine brand instead of butter.  (Bisquik or other pancake/baking mix for the buttermilk mix.)  I baked in two 8x8" brownie pans for 24 minutes.  They are perfect!  Sweet but not too sweet, just a hint of tanginess from the buttermilk I used, light texture, great pale color... everybody loves it.  This would be great with butter and syrup for breakfast and it was awesome with my spicy chili, too.  A wonderful recipe, I am so glad I found it!

This cornbread was good but differs from traditional Southern cornbread. Based on reviews, deviated from recipe with aim toward a less sweet, more corn flavored bread. In spite of decreasing the Bisquick mix to 2-1/2 cups, increasing the yellow cornmeal to 3/4 cup, and cutting sugar to 3/4 cups, the cornbread was still sweat and tasted more like cake than bread. While my bread held together okay, it wouldn’t take much for it to be crumbly as many others have mentioned. Once again, I’ll be back searching for a more compatible cornbread more aligned to what we ate when growing up.

I did not have Buttermilk Baking mix, so I made my own "Bisquick" mix.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Absolutely the best cornbread I have ever made!  If you like your cornbread sweet, then this is the recipe for you!

Oh my goodness!  This was awesome.  My 15 year old son liked it so much he said he wanted it instead of a cake on his bday!  Only 2 changes... cut sugar to 3/4 and used 1/3 cup butter! Totally delicious!

We really enjoyed this - very simple and easy to make, great flavor without being dry and crumbly like so many cornbreads are.  I used Bisquik and added about 3T of buttermilk powder, I added about 3T extra cornbread too.  To avoid having it crumble and break apart, allow it to sit for about 10 minutes from the oven, slice and allow to rest another 8-10 minutes before removing from the pan.

I'm so glad that I was pointed to this recipe while looking at the reviews for White Chicken Chili I--this was the perfect side dish for that. It was surprising that cornbread could be both moist AND crumbly, but the crumbliness was just right for soup. I even almost messed this up by forgetting to add the cornmeal! As I was putting it in the oven, I realized "something" was missing--I just stirred it in and it came out great, anyway. I used bisqick, as I figured that was what it was calling for and I halved the recipe (used 2 whole eggs, though) and put it in an 8x8 pan. This isgoing to be my go-to cornbread recipe from now on!

Flavor more than good, it was EXCELLENT!   The only downside, it’s way to crumbly.  As others, I used 2 1/4 cups mix, and 1 cup cornmeal.  I did decide to refrigerate, and it held together better. Next time, I think I will add even more cornmeal.  This recipe needs a little TLC, so only 4 stars…the taste definitely deserves 5!

Loved! Very cake like and crumbly....but delicious! I made a couple changes....I used 2 1/2c of the baking mix and upped the cornmeal to 3/4c as did another reviewer. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4c and  the butter to just 1/2c (1 stick)....thought 2 would be way too much. Worked out perfectly. A very tasty cornbread....just not as "corn-y" in texture like I am used to. Thanks!

Sweet cornbread at its finest.  I made this using all  of the ingredients listed, plus adding 1/4 cup of leftover corn.  I baked in a 10 1/2" cast iron skillet and it baked perfectly, golden brown all around.  I did not have the dried out, crumbling problems other bakers appeared to have.  It served up nicely in pie cut pieces and was a nice addition to 'Boilermaker Tailgate Chili', another AR recipe.  I will be using this recipe again.

My guy was upset when he found out I wasn't making extra sweet Jiffy cornbread. He actually pitched a pretty good fit, but after he took the first bite of this recipe, all he good do was tell me how good it is and it is the best cornbread that he has ever had!! I did follow another reviewers suggestion and cut the baking mix down to 2.5 cups and increased the cornmeal up to 3/4 cup. I also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. My only complaint is that this cornbread is very crumbly.

My 9 year old has recently discovered that he loves cornbread.  He's been eating the box mix, but I didn't have any on hand so I made this recipe instead.  He loved it and said to make this instead of the box mix from now on.  I think next time I will double the cornmeal though, for me it didn't have enough cornbread taste and texture.  As for the buttermilk baking mix, I just used plain Bisquick and it turned out fine.

I made this cornbread and loved it! However, I did bake it in a pre-heated cast iron skillet that browned it on the bottom edge- delicious!!

My husband and I LOVE this cornbread!  I have been making the cheapie jiffy cornbread for years, and decided to try something different when having guests over.  I think we gobbled up the entire pan!
If you are looking for a dense cornbread, similar to the box kind, this is not for you!
This recipe is for a very sweet light bread, and I often serve it on a plate with a fork, like a cake.
It also makes a HUGE 9x13 pan, so it's great for groups.  (or families!)

If you like a sweet cornbread, this is wonderful.  It does have a more cake like texture rather than crumbly.  I used non-fat milk rather than whole and it came out fine.  It is very buttery and moist.

Although I changed the recipe somewhat, I am giving this 5 stars based on the texture of the finished product and the versatility of the recipe. I used less sugar, more corn meal, and less butter. Next time I will use even less sugar and more corn meal. I love the cake-like, tender quality; my husband prefers old-fashioned cornbread & said he did not care for this (although I did notice he ate 2 hunks) but I will definitely make it again. I paired it with Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili from this site, and what a great combo!

Tastes like cake. We enjoyed it. Hard to eat like normal cornbread because it's so crumbly. But it was great crumbled over chili. I do like more corn flaver in my cornbread!

I was very skeptical about the pancake mix in this.  But I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to try it...I'm glad I did!  Absolutely delicious, great texture, no "chalkiness" like you can get sometimes with cornbread.  Nice and sweet, but not too sweet.  I guess the pancake mix is the secret!  Thank you for sharing the recipe Shelly!

Not your typical cornbread.  I usually don't like how "corny" and dry cornbread can be, but this is so moist and soooooo good.  If I could change anything, perhaps I would reduce the baking powder to only 2 tsp.  I think I can taste the baking powder a little bit.  Other than that it's just excellent.

I know that the recipe is not specific on what to use for the buttermilk baking mix.  I used Bisquick and it worked well for me.

VERY yummy. I love really "corny" cornbread so I decreased the buttermilk bicsuit mix to 2 1/4 cups and increased the cornmeal to 1 cup. Delicious, and I think it's even better the 2nd day.

Mmmm this was so yummy! Yes it was a little crumbly but what good cornbread isn't? My husband and I both loved this recipe and will definetly make it again. I used an insulated 9 by 13 pan and had to double the cooking time and increase the temp., 30 minutes at 350 was way too short for me.  Give this cornbread a try, you won't be dissapointed :)

Although on the sweeter side, this was pretty good! I'm still a sucker for bluegirl's golden sweet cornbread (it's THE best!), but this was decent nonetheless. I agree with everyone who cut back on the sugar. I only used 3/4 c. and thought I could have used even less. In addition to cutting back on the sugar, I also agree that adding cirn (canned, frozen or fresh) is an absolute must. I added a cup's worth of frozen corn to my cornbread and am glad I did. My only problem with this (other than calling for too much sugar) is that my bread was so crumbly, I had to eat it with a fork! I wish I would have followed EKERR19's advice. She suggests allowing your baked cornbread to rest for 10 minutes, slicing it and then allowing it to rest ANOTHER 8-10 minutes prior to serving. My soup was ready to dish up so I served mine immediately, but I am curious to know if her advice holds true. Mishap aside, this is a fine cornbread but certainly not one of my favorites. Thanks anyways, Shelly! :)

It had a nice, sweet, taste, but it was impossible to eat.  The bread literally fell (crumbled) apart before I could get it out of the pan.  I saw where other people tweeked the recipe to avoid this, but I made the bread just as the original recipe stated.  I may try it with the suggested revisions.

This is really delicious, and that's coming from someone who's hated cornbread his whole life. Tried this on a whim a long time ago and it was excellent. I always skip the baking powder as I don't usually have it around and forget to buy it (bachelor living). Doesn't really make a difference as far as I can tell. I also add some vanilla (a dash or two), seems to work well. Makes good corn muffins, too. They'll look a little too brown on the outside, but stay fluffy and delicious inside.

I halved the recipe. A little too sweet for us, so I'd reduce the sugar next time. I also increased the amount of cornmeal and reduced the baking mix for a stronger corn flavour. These are quite crumbly, so I don't recommend adding anything in them (we added hot dogs and it got kinda messy to eat). We have had better, but this is good in a pinch and for less fuss.

This was delicious, and very easy to make. It was very crumbly though, and difficult to serve nicely. I made it twice-once I added some frozen cooked corn, which made it more intesting. Worth making, for sure!

I don't really approve of others customizing someone's recipe, we should just write our own but I'm excusing my own rule here.  The recipe sounded great but in the midst of it, I added twice the cornmeal (white), vanilla and added a couple of tablespoons of the powdered buttermilk baking mix by Sago into the milk.  Served with my 15 bean soup and a dash of Habanero sauce.It was wonderful.  Kudos to the author of this!

We went to a friend's house for chili, and I brought this cornbread.  It was a HUGE hit.

I'm not a very experienced cook, so I was a little apprehensive about some of the ingredients at the store.  I saw Buttermilk pancake mix and Buttermilk biscuit mix -- I looked at the ingredients in both and wasn't sure which one to use.  Then I didn't know whether I was supposed to get "self-rising" yellow corn meal or not. There were cornbread recipes on the back of both kinds of corn meal, so I was really confused.  Finally, my husband had salted butter on hand, but I didn't know whether to use that or unsalted butter.   I ended up using Bisquick buttermilk pancake mix, self-rising yellow corn meal, and unsalted butter.  

It was perfect.

Sooo delicious! So easy and quick.  I wasn't sure what buttermilk baking mix was so I used bisquick.  Also, note that the recipe serves 15!  Thats a lot of cornbread.  I halved mine and baked it in a 8 x8 glass dish.  It's a keeper!!!!

WOW!!! Changed my world when it comes to cornbread. So sweet and buttery with still that familiar taste of cornmeal to balance it all out. Made this yesterday with plans to serve it at dinner. Decided to try it warm out of the oven and almost couldn't stop myself from eating piece after piece! The only thing I did different from the written recipe is use homemade baking mix. This will definitely be making many repeat appearances in my house.

Family really enjoyed this one!  It was very cake-like and quite crumbly while warm, but they still gobbled it up with the chili we made.  
Tried it today and have to say it's much better the day after.  Perhaps next time I'll make it a few hours before dinner's ready so it has time to set up. Yum!

I used Bisquick and subbed milk for the butter, as well as made my normal adjustments for high altitude, and this is hands down the BEST cornbread recipe that I've found yet. Thank you so much for sharing!!!

This is a sweet and delicious recipe with an almost cake-like texture.  I used Bob's Red Mill Whole grain corn flour instead of cornmeal.  I too wondered what was meant by buttermilk baking mix.  I used Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix and it turned out well.  
My batter almost overflowed my pan - this makes a very full 9x13 recipe.  I also added 5 minutes to the baking time.  (My altitude is 4800 feet)

I made this to go with Dad's Cheesy Bacon Wrapped Meat Loaf when I realized at the last minute I didn't have any potatoes. I used a homemade whole wheat white baking mix that I make myself and upped the baking soda to a full tablespoon. I also used buttermilk and organic eggs. This is a really sweet cornbread for those who like a real bread-y cornbread with a hint of corn. My men enjoyed it and the little bit I had I loved. This was a great recipe for my littlest and I to make together, too. My only issue was how fall-apart-y it was. Anyone else have that issue? You take a bite and the whole piece would fall to pieces in your plate.

This is not "cornbread" in the traditional sense, but it is outstanding.  Cornbread is normally quite nutritious, but this is more like yellow cake (there's only a 1/4 cup cornmeal in the entire recipe).  I will make this again for a delicious change of pace, but not too often because I felt so guilty eating/serving it :)

This is the best sweet, cake-like cornbread! Not a dense, savory variety so try a different recipe if that's your preference. I halved the recipe but still used 2 eggs and had no problem with crumbliness. Delicious with white chicken chili II (this site) and just as good the next 2 days with leftovers and breakfast. Surpisingly full corn flavor for just an 1/8 cup (in half recipe) of cornmeal. My half recipe fit perfectly in a deep 8x8 square pan & looked as good as it tasted. Can't wait to make this again!

This is similar to the cornbread our sorority house cook used to make.  We LOVED it and would fight over it.  Hers had less baking powder (1 t.) and cornmeal (3 T.) and more milk (1 1/2 C.).  Maybe that makes it less crumbly because I don't have that problem.  Everyone who tastes it asks for the recipe.  One family friend even made it a new tradition at her house for Thanksgiving.  But it is sweet-- I even eat it with ice cream sometimes :)

Absolutely wonderful. My family loves this corn bread. It tastes like there's a bit of pineapple juice in it, but there isn't. Very light and crumbly. I used only 3/4 c. sugar, 3/4 c. Egg Beaters and 1 c. of canola oil in place of the melted butter. This recipe is a keeper.

Since I'm from TX and we don't normally make our cornbread to taste like cake....I have to try this one. We eat cake if we want some sweet bread. One of the things I remember about my dad (and so do the children who are old enough to remember him, he passed away 30 years ago)is every night before he put anything on his plate he crumbled his cornbread in his glass of milk to eat as a finishing touch to his meal. Don't see folks doing that anymore. :( So right now I won't rate this recipe as good...

I made this cornbread last year for Thanksgiving (which was held at my home).  This year I had soooo many request for me to make this again that I could not say no.  I made it, and the funny thing is that everyone ate it before the dinner was even served!!!!

I also changed the cornmeal to 1 cup and baking mix to 2 1/4 C. I thought it was too sweet..the next time I will only add 1/2 c. sugar. It was better than any other cornbread I have made.

This is the best cornbread I have ever had. My husband couldn't get enough of this. He even took some to work to share with some coworkers and they loved it too. I followed everything exactly, but used 2% milk.

My husband can't get enough of this stuff.  I followed the advice of several other reviewers and decreased the baking mix to 2 1/4 cup and increased the cornmeal to 1 cup.  I use store brand baking mix and it was wonderful.  We serve this crumbled over sausage and shrimp jambalaya.  It's wonderful.

Wonderful and just what I was looking for. I used Martha White self-rising buttermilk cornmeal mix instead of buttermilk mix and left out the baking powder. I will be making this quite often since we like the "SWEET" cornbread. I also didn't grease the pan and only used pam and it worked wonderfully.

Delicious!  My husband (not a cornbread fan) loved it!  Only be sure to use a large baking dish - I halved the recipe & used an 8x8 pan and it overflowed in the oven.  Definitely will make again.

This is very good cornbread. To make it crispy around the edges (the way I like it), I recommend baking for an 10 additional minutes.

Sugar-free version- This was incredible! I went with the reviewers that said to add more cornmeal and less Bisquick. I also substituted the 1c. sugar for half  cup in stevia. 
I made it as muffins for my diabetic husband but this time I could not help myself from eating his muffins. They came out very light and cake like, not crumbly at all! I'll be making these quit often. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious recipe!  I only made a half recipe, using 1 egg and buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I also used the Homemade Biscuit Mix that is also found on All Recipes.

I've always used this cornbread recipe except instead of the full cup of sugar I use 1/2C sugar and 1C honey.

Dangerously Delicious! Cut the recipe down to 5 servings and baked in 8" square pan without any recipe changes for 25 minutes. All the reviews are right - this is sooo good that it's difficult to stop picking at it. I had mixed the Heart Smart Bisquick with regular and that didn't seem to affect the taste. Also, melted the butter in the pan while oven was preheating and that was perfect way to prepare the pan. Try this - you're going to love it. I'm giving out the recipe with the exact amount of cornmeal in a plastic bag to encourage people to try it - they might not want to buy a whole bag of cornmeal until they know how good this is and they're sure to have all the other ingredients.

I have made this recipe several times and every time I make it for company, they want the recipe.  I couldn't find the buttermilk baking mix the first time I made it so I used regular Bisquick and used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Very, very good recipe!

Good, but wondering why the Waikiki in the name?  I was expecting pineapple or some other type of fruit in it with that name.

This was definitely very yummy! Although, my husband and I were looking more for the "crunchy" cornbread texture. This was more like a cake mix. Next time I'll add more cornmeal to it.  If you put a little whipped cream and strawberries on top, it could be used as a good dessert!

Delicious, easy, and a fun alternative to the crumbly version. I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly into an 8x8 pan. I also added a small can of sweet corn to the mix. Yum!

Best cornbread I've ever tasted and I'm from the South!  It is SO moist and cake like and sweet.  I added a small can of corn "nibblets" (drained the juice out first) to add texture and my guests raved about it.  Fantastic recipe.

This Waikiki Cornbread was the best cornbread I have ever made. It was perfect.  My kids and husband said to make this one again.  I did not have baking mix so for each cup of flour I added 1 1/2 tea of baking power and 1/2 tea salt and 1 tablespoon butter. I followed everything else as stated in the recipe except, lastly, folding in 2 cups of corn.

The best cornbread I've ever tasted- husband, kids, friends all agree!  But beware - it does not keep well.  Two days, tops, but it's so delicious it will be easy to eat immediately!

Not traditional but very easy and tasty.  I halved the recipe and doubled the cornmeal to make it more "corny".  Didn't have any problem with crumbling.  Served with Hawaiian Style Chili from this site that we like very much.

There are only a few recipes that my family would consider 5 Star, but this is one of them! Easy prep for me and my family enjoyed every bite.  This cornbread is dense, moist, buttery and yummy, with a nice sweetness and a crumbly texture.  It was still delicious and moist the next day, when I reheated and served the leftovers.  I'd recommend this recipe to anyone looking for an easy to prepare, sweet cornbread!

This is the only cornbread I will make from now on!  My husband doesn't usually like cornbread because many times it's too dry and crumbly.  After tasting this recipe he said, "Don't lose this recipe!  I love it!"  I like that the cornbread is sweet enough that you don't really need to spread butter on it, but still good if you do.  Yes, it is still crumbly, but the soft cakey crumbs are easy to scoop up and eat!  The only downside to this recipe is that I found it didn't taste as good the second day - not sure why.  But it didn't last long in our house anyway!

Just because you put cornmeal in the batter does not make it cornbread.  More like a sweet cake or breakfast cake.

Extremely crumbly.  Very sweet and soft cornbread, probably best for using over a stew or chili, as others had already said.  My guests would go to put butter on and the cornbread would just collapse in their fingers.

I made this fantastic moist, fluffy and sweet recipe last night for 3 people. We had 1/2 the pan left over. When I woke up this morning I planned on having a piece with breakfast, but there was none left. :(  I will make this often!!!!

The cornbread tastes great.  It has good flavor, good consistency, and it is best served warm.  Like some of the other reviewers, I am picky with cornbread, but this one simply tasted better than all of the other cornbreads I have tried in the past.

I think there's too much sugar in this recipe. It stuck to the pan pretty badly. I would suggest that you grease and flour the pan very well. Once I got it out of the pan, it was delicious, though.

Really good flavor, but a little too cake like for what I had planned.  I served it warm as a desert with a dollop of honey butter on the side.  As a dessert it was a hit!

I used Buttermilk Pancake mix instead of Buttermilk Baking mix.  Wasn't sure if this was what they were going for - but tell you what...it turned out awesome - so oh well!  Yummy!  Very Moist and delicious!

I hate cornbread...BUT NOT THIS ONE.  It is just awesome served with chili or ham and beans. Not dry and grainy like most cornbread. I made the adjustments using less mix, more cornmeal and people raved about it. Definately a keeper recipe.  It is soooo easy and is great left over the next day too.  It is crumbly but just let it fall in with the chili and it is delish!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it tasted so darn good, but be forewarned, it is ~not~ your traditional cornbread.  It's very, very much like cake.  And delicious!  It would be good crumbled on top of chili, that's what we had it with.  It was rather crumbly, I don't know how to fix that.  But I will definitely halve the recipe and make again!

Oh, wow - this is the best cornbread ever!  I made this to go with our annual Christmas Eve stew, and it was the first thing to go!  Everyone kept commenting that it was like cake (as they went back for 2nd and 3rd helpings).  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect.  This is now my official cornbread recipe - I'm making another batch tomorrow to go with our New Years Day black-eyed pea soup (recipe also from this site).  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

My husband likes this cornbread so well it's all he ever wants now. It does crumble easily though. I always let it cool down before serving which seems to help.

Excellent recipe - my family couldn not stop raving about this cornbread.  Instead of "buttermilk baking mix", I used "buttermilk biscuit mix" - which is probably the same thing.  I also used margarine instead of butter (because I had it on hand), and the cooking time was almost 1 hour! (And I have a convection oven) - I will definitely make this again!

I had to come back and give this recipe a WOW.. I made this to go with a batch of New Year's style black eyed peas and my family gobbled it up with rave reviews.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it came out phenomenal.  This will be my cornbread recipe from now on.  If you like a more "corny" cornbread I would swap some cornmeal for some of the bisquick mix, but this is a GREAT recipe as is.

Yum, yum!  This cornbread has a wonderful, sweet taste.  I used Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix as some others did, and it worked great.  The cornbread is a bit crumbly, but I just shook the crumbs onto the top of my chili and enjoyed.  Great recipe!

Wonderful, moist and flavorful. It was perfect without any changes. It was a big hit at a recent barbeque.

I was a little disappointed with this cornbread recipe, especially after reading all the rave reviews.  Don't get me wrong; this cornbread was very good -- fluffy and sweet.  It was a little on the greasy side, perhaps too much butter.  It wasn't enough on the corny side.  While I agree with other reviewers that too much corn isn't good, this recipe didn't have enough corn flavor.  Maybe I used the wrong buttermilk mix (the recipe's not specific here, so I chose Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake mix).  This was more like a breakfast or a dessert bread than something to go with soup or chili.  I will continue looking for the perfect cornbread recipe.

This was so good. I thought it was almost like cake and my husband said it was like sweet bread.
