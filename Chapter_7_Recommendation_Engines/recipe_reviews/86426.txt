This tea is awesome!!!!!!  It is refreshing and tasty.  If you love the almond taste you will love this tea!!!! It is great as is but it was a little sweet for my taste so I used half the sugar and it was great!!!!!!

This was very good.  I used 3 of the large iced tea bags instead of instant tea and only 1/2 a cup of sugar.  I thought it was plenty sweet.  Would definately make this again!

I also used regular tea bags. Never would have thought to make tea with almond and vanilla extract but it was good. Like the subtleness of the flavor. Didn't include the sugar as we sweeten to individual taste.

This is great.  Almond extract gets expensive...you can buy it a lot cheaper at Sam's Club.

This is wonderful.  I used the splenda sugar mixture in place of the straight sugar and it was super.

I used my Mr. Coffee tea maker for this, only making a double-strength batch with my regular tea bags but half the water I would have normally used. (I hope that makes sense, I don't have iced tea powder, so I had to make a quick change. I used ten regular sized no-tag tea bags but only a quart and a half of water when it brewed in the tea brewer.)When the tea was done, I added the sugar, frozen lemonade concentrate, vanilla and almond extracts, then two ice cube-makers worth of ice. After I added the ice, I set the iced tea pitcher in the fridge for a couple hours until the ice had melted and the tea was cold. My husband and kids thought this was good, but my husband thought that the almond was a little too overpowering. I thought this was too sweet. I'd like to make this again but cut the sugar back by half and maybe only use a teaspoon of almond extract. I think then it might be just right. Awesome change on your everyday glass of iced tea.

Delicious! If made precisely according to the directions, it's a bit heavy; not bad at all, just slightly unsuited for a hot summer day.

Too much almond flavor. Use 1/2 of what recipe calls for.

This was first introduced to me by a nice lady at a family get-together.  She had made this and it sounded and tasted so good!  I had never heard of it before and she told me the ingredients.  I went home right away and found this recipe that had what she told me was in it.  I made it and it was very close to what she had made.  It was a little more "lemonade-y" tasting than hers.  So next time I will add half the lemonade and taste.  I think the whole can of frozen lemonade gave it too much of a lemonade taste and hid the tea and almond flavor.  Also instead of instant tea, I brewed my own tea bags and made it a little stronger than I normally would with regular tea.  Great and different recipe!  I can't wait for warmer weather to make it!  It will be a nice thirst quencher!  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out wonderfully and it was super easy to make. I know someone that had made this tea before and I had loved it. This was an equally good recipe. I will definitely be recommending it.

Perfect just as the recipe is written!  What a delicious summer refresher, and I'll be taking the advice from another reviewer and make this an adult beverage SOON!  Thanks, BahamaMama62!
