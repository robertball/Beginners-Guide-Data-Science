5 star recipe, though I have to admit, I had saved this recipe from junior high's home economics class (many, many, many moons ago).  Easy variations are to add pepper jack cheese, sausage, bacon or ham for breakfast.  Turn it in to a pizza bread by adding smoke mozzarella, pepperoni or salami.  Or a veggie bread by adding a variety of vegetables.  This bread is so versatile and forgiving you can add anything and it turns out well!  Thanks for the memories bfr610!

So this is just a plateful of sinful goodness.  It hits all my pleasure points for decadent snacking.  Soft chewy bread!  Gooy melty cheese!  Bright spicy peppers!  What's not to love....  except the uncooked doughy bits in the middle when you make monkey bread without using a bundt pan.  I did find if you cut the biscuits into 8 pieces instead of 4 that does help and I baked the first layer of biscuits for about 10 minutes before adding the cheese and remaining layers.

Another great recipe bfr610, thank you!  I found a can of biscuits in the fridge and knew exactly what I wanted to do with it.  I thought the taste of this would compliment a large dinner salad really well, and I was correct.  My SIL had just given me a jar of the fresh jalapeños that she had canned.  I drained them really well (between paper towel) and they were great in this recipe. It was doughy (in a good way), cheesy, spicy and oh soooo delicious.  I won't hesitate to make this again and make it for company. I look forward to trying another one of your recipes, bfr610!

Nice recipe, I really like this.  I followed advice to cut in to eights, not quarters and tossed them in a bowl full of melted butter.  Combinations of fillers are endless.

This was really good. I made some modifications to suit what I had  - made my own biscuits, used cheddar and cotija cheeses, and cilantro instead of parsley. Will make again for sure!

My family loves this and it is so quick to make.  I use Marzetti's "tamed" jalapenos (drained) which are wonderful.  This goes great with a brothy soup on a cold day.

AWESOME!  Absolutely delicious!  I did need an extra Tbs. of butter for dipping.  After laying out the first layer, I realized there was no way I was going to get 3 layers, so I just made 2 which meant, since all my ingredients were measured out for 3, each of the 2 layers ended up with extra toppings because I wasn't about to wrap and put anything back in the fridge.  Mine took 40 minutes to bake and it came out tasty and beautiful.  The only thing I did differently was to chop up my jalapeno slices a bit to provide better distribution.  Wished I'd had a beer to drink with it because this stuff was hot...but soooo good.

Love it!  I added some crumbled hot sausage, (about 1/2 lb).  It was done in 30 min.  I'll be making this again.

I was afraid using all that jalapeno pepper would make it way too spicy, so I cut it in half.  Actually, when I make it again, I'll use the amount of jalapeno called for, as it wasn't very hot at all.

I made this recently for a football watch party. It was a bigger hit with me than anybody else. Turns out, the extra jalapeños I added weren't appreciated by everyone. With the leftovers, the next day, I tore off a few pieces, sprinkled them with some shredded cheese and put them under the broiler for a few minutes. Made for excellent breakfast "cheese toast". Anyway, it's easy and delicious. I'll be making this again and again.

This was so easy to make and turned out perfect! I used Mexican oregano in place of the parsley.

It’s definitely awesome to add more cheese. It should be perfect when it comes out with a nice gold edge. Such a fun party food. 5/5!

Easy to make and something different to serve with chilli or soup or as a snack. Made it for a football game, along with other apples, and it was a hit. Made it a second time and added black olive slices. Thanks for the recipe!

This was OK...as one reviewer mentioned, too dry. And I added more cheese in hopes it would alleviate the dry factor but it fell short.

I made as written but I thought this was too dry. Maybe more cheese?
Update, I made this again with more cheese, more butter, more jalapeño and it was very good. Be prepared to double or Tripple the cheese.

We used about 1.5 cups of fresh jalapeño slices and added about a Tbsp of garlic. We only had cheddar cheese so I added an extra 1/4 cup to replace the mozzarella. We will make this again and try it with olives & sun dried tomatoes too. This will be a regular for us. Thank you!

This is a big hit for those who like the spicy jalapeños - which I do. I'll be making this again for sure. This would be a good dish to bring to a party.

Made this two ways now, first time I left off the jalapenos, so all family members would eat.  I was a little heavy handed with the cheese, and after I put it all in the bundt cake, I put the remaining butter over the top.  

Second time I used pickled jalapenos, and both times were delicious.  Everyone loves this recipe, will be a standard in our house, as it's simple and quick.

This was a winner!  I over did the cheese and jalapenos but it got a lot of praise.  I will make this again and add sausage.

Sooooo good ! I used a deep dish pie pan which worked perfectly (center the dough pieces, there will be a inch or so space from the edge of the pan but it spreads out when baking). I also drizzled about 1/4 stick of melted butter over the top dough, than the cheese, bake time was 30 mins. I used canned jalapeños & the bread wasn’t hot / spicy at all. This is such a good & easy recipe to make I’m definitely going to keep it in my recipe file & will be sharing it.

I took this to a party and everyone loved it and said I needed to bring 2 next time. I used pepper jack cheese and sun dried tomatoes instead of the jalapenos, as I don't like jalapenos. It had a nice kick without being too hot.

Loved it. Easy to make. I used a fresh Serrano Chile because that's what I had. I think next time I'll add the last layer of cheese half way through the baking time. I'm sorry I didn't try this sooner since I pinned it a few years ago!

Crazy good! Surprisingly, the jalapeños are not all that hot. Very rich,  not for the day you are counting calories. Well worth the count.

Loved this bread. So easy! I thought we had a jar of jalapeños but no. So I used jalapeño stuffed olives. Turned out great!  Next time I'll try sun dried tomatoes. Great with soup.

Made it last week,  and it was a big hit. Making it again this weekend in hopes that I can enjoy it alone.

This was very easy to make and a home run in my opinion.  I used mild jalapenos, just because I didn't want it to be too hot, and followed the recipe with no modifications.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you.

Made this for Labor Day weekend. It was delicious!!  We did dip it in some ranch to cool the heat down a little. I added some cayenne pepper to the spiced layers.  There is so much room to change up the spices and toppings!!

I've made this several times and everyone loves it.  I even made this on a camping trip for a group of 6 and there wasn't anything left.
