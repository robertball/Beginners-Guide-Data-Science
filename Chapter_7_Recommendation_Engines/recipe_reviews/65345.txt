I was looking for a peanut butter bread/cake recipe that reminded me of the same cake I used to eat as a good at my elementary school in L.A. back in the 80s.  I was sooo pleased with this recipe.  It was not as great as the one at my school but it was pretty darn close.  The one I was looking for did bot have a topping but this topping was extremely good.  I would recommend this recipe and I plan on making it again.  Also, I preferred it cold rather than straight out of the oven.  Happy baking!!

Funny story, my friend and I were looking for a recipe that was reminiscent of the peanut butter cake they used to serve in the LA school district in the 80s.  I come across this one, read the first review and breakfastbelle also tried this recipe for the same reason!  I agree with her that it is not exactly the same, but it is delicious in its own way. I halved the recipe (baked for 20 min in a 9x9 pan) not knowing if I would like it and I wished I would have just made the whole recipe.  It is sooo good, moist and just perfectly flavored.  The only thing I changed was added a handful of crushed peanuts to the topping just like they did in the elementary school cafeteria.

Fantastic!  I used creamy peanut butter in the cake, and also added four bananas, then used crunch peanut butter for the topping.  YUM!

MAde cake exactly as recipe called for, except I added just a bit more peanut butter.  It was actually pretty good.  Next time , I will make it in a bundt pan and omit the "crumble". and than cover it with the Satiny Chocolate glaze from this site and sprinkle with chopped up peanuts.

Wow! Great recipe. The only thing i changed: I used 1 cup & did a mix of crunchy, smooth & white chocolate flavor peanut butter. with that extra PB I melted it after I did the crumb topping & added to make more crumbs. & I didnt have milk so I used 1/4cup vanilla creamer & 3/4cup water.

Being an absolute fan of peanut butter, I was excited to try this cake.  We had it for breakfast and it was yummy.  I added milk chocolate chips to the batter and also to the topping.  Very good!  I do wish the peanut butter flavor was a little stronger so maybe will add more next time but the consistency of the cake was great.  The family loved it so we'll definitely be making it again.

I am a BIG peanut butter fan so I am always trying new PB recipes.  But I must say I was very disappointed in this one.  I found it very dry and crumbly.  I will not be making this one again.  Sorry JIF.

I was excited to try this recipe b/c it was rated well. I did not care for it. I'm still looking for that perfect peanut butter cake...maybe something more moist, sweeter, w/ more peanut butter flavor. My kids wouldn't eat it...and they eat just about all cake!

Sorry Jif but I made this with almond butter and added some cinnamon chips on the batter before adding the crumbs.  It was easy to make and everyone loved it.  An alternative to those with peanut allergies.

Like Breakfastbelle and Love2eat, I too was looking for that LAUSD peanut butter coffee cake that I had as a kid in the 70s. I have looked everywhere online for that recipe, and now that LAUSD school kitchens only heat food and no longer cook their own, that recipe is lost to the wind. This is similar, but not as good. I did use natural peanut butter, and it was tasty, but I'm not sure how different the end result is when using Jif, which I've never tried. Maybe I'll add some more salt next time and trade out the shortening for butter, since it's flavorless.

I think this coffee cake is just right for a breakfast item. It's not too rich with just the right peanut butter flavor. I made a half recipe in a loaf pan - I was short on eggs. It was great and I'll definitely make it again!

As a peanut butter lover, I really love this coffee cake. Moist and light, but not falling apart. The only changes I made was cut down sugar by half, used about 2 tbsp LESS butter (I used butter instead of shortening), added about 1 tbsp of vinegar and 1 tsp of vanilla, and added at least 1/4 more peanut butter to the cake. I melted (not completely) the peanut butter with butter first and then beat using hand mixer with sugar and egg. Then I mixed the rest BY HAND. Oh and for topping I used half flour and half quick oats. When fresh out of oven, the peanut butter taste is very mild you wish you had put more, but the next day (I'm eating it as I'm writing this) there's defniitely more peanut butter taste. I would make it again and again! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This is wonderful!  I just took it out of the oven and it is almost gone!  I made a few changes, I used margarine instead of shortening and Adams Natural peanutbutter.  I think it has a great peanut flavor, almost like a soft peanut butter cookie.  I really like the topping, gives it something extra.

Peanut butter lovers are in heaven. Took the priveledge of adding chopped walnuts to topping, although I was tempted to use peanuts, the walnuts seemed to be a nice, crunchy addition.

I could spend hours praising the virtues of this coffee cake!!  It has the perfect peanut-buttery taste, an extra-yummy topping, and a wonderfully moist texture.  Plus, it's easy to make!  I took it to work and received so many praises that I sent everyone a link to this recipe.  Try mixing about 1 cup of mini chocolate chips in the topping.  YUM!

This is now my husbands favorite coffee cake! The only thing I did different was to use creamy peanut butter for the crumble on top and crunchy (1-cup) for the cake part. Next time I might try it with chocolate chips in it.

Great recipe- i've made it twice, but i leave out the crumb topping, add chocolate chips, and pour it in a bundt pan.  When it cools i melt chocolate frosting in the microwave and drizzle it on top.  More of a peanutbutter chocolate chip cake.

I was looking for something simple and use the items I had in my home. I used the crunchy peanut butter and maybe that was my mistake. I was disappointed. It was very dry. I melted chocolate chips and drizzled it over the top which tasted great but cake part just to dry. Throwing this recipe out.

Very good coffee cake, good peanut butter flavor.  I've made the cake a couple of times.  I made the following changes: I used 1/4 canola oil instead of CRISCO and I used 1 TBL margarine and 1 TBL canola oil in the topping, instead of all margarine.  I baked the cake at 350 degrees instead of 375.  This cake, like most coffee cakes, could be easily overbaked and become dry.  I watch the cake very closely towards the end of baking to make sure it doesn't overbake.
The family liked it best re-heated for a few seconds in the microwave.  I plan to cut the cake into pieces and put in the freezer to be eaten as a quick breakfast or snack.
