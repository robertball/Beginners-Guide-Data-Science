Easy to make and very tasty. A nice change from drinking coffee all night! It was a little to sweet for my taste, so I will cut back on the sugar the next time I make this. I added club soda to my second cup and it added a nice fizziness and helped cut the sweetness. Defintely a keeper.

Delicious!  Is a beautiful rosey color which is very attractive! I strained the leftovers and refrigerated it.  Delicious cold, and I think the flavor of the spices came through a little better the 2nd day.  A keeper!!

The flavors in this "tea" are just wonderful, not too sweet, not too tart. Perfect for sipping by the fire with your family on cold winter evenings. My family already loves it, and wants it part of our winter traditions.

Tried this for the first time for a christmas gathering and it was a great hit.  I will follow the recipe closer next time though -- I tried to stretch it by adding 4 qts. of water instead of 3.  I ended up adding more juice than called for, orange, lemon and lime (since that's what I had on hand).  It was good, but not as strong of a cranberry taste as I would have liked. Have already passed on the recipe to several others.

I am one of four siblings of Terra who posted the recipe :-) It was my Great Grandmothers. My mom would often try different sweetening methods, like adding 1c honey or 1/2c sugar and 1c honey. Its all good anyway you make it. I would have added to strain the cranberries so that it is smooth.

Used stevia instead, leaving it undersweetened so family members could finish off by adding a touch of sucanat, white sugar, honey, or more stevia (each producing a different result).  Left out the oranges and lemons for the trial run (informal family evening).  Simply made this in the slowcooker instead of cooking it and moving it to the slow cooker. IT WAS WONDERFUL anyway.  It will certainly be a richer experience with the oranges and lemons, but will probably make again with just the cranberries at times.  This was a lovely change from other crockpot drinks we make in our crockpot in the winter (ginger punch, chai tea, cocoa, mulled cider, and a lemon-almond sweetened tea made using instant tea).  I loved watching the cranberries gradually fall to the bottom of the slow cooker during cooking.  With them being at the bottom, they were well out of the way until people who wanted that last sip had to work for it - helping them savour the moment a little longer.... fun to watch the young ones willing to work so hard for one more drop!  I guess we'll miss that if we cook this on the stove top first as indicated in the recipe.... hmmmm, but will have to try that sometime....  This actually went faster than any of the other drinks I've made in the past.  It might even become a holiday staple.  Might try adding almond extract or some instant tea one of these times.... maybe.... it's pretty wonderful as is, though.

I've tried a couple of these cranberry tea recipes on here, and this is my favorite.  It's more about the cranberry, and less about the other juices.  It smells like Christmas, and I like the clearer red color!  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup, and then add a couple of teaspoons of sugar to one large mug, to taste.

The taste of Christmas! Hot or cold it is a great standby at Christmastime for those who don't drink alcolhol. A great 'pick-me-up' after a long walk in  cold weather.

Loved it.  I only used 1.5 cups of sugar, but that was my only change to this wonderful recipe.  2 cups would probably be way too sweet for my taste.

Yummy! I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup because I prefer a little more of the cranberry flavor to the super sweet. OTherwise it was perfect!

This is holidays in a drink! I loved it! So did my sister and my husband says it has a good flavor! Hot or cold makes no difference on taste. I happen to enjoy the hot it makes me all holidayish. It was devoured before I knew it and I am off to make more!

This was a wonderful way to use cranberries without making another sauce.  Being on a low carb diet I substituted Splenda for the sugar and two packets of Orange flavored Crystal Light for the orange juice.  I didn't have whole cloves so I used ground cloves to taste.  My husband adored this and we'll be making it again.

Mmmmm.  I put the berries and water in my crockpot on low the night before - then added the rest the last hour and cut the sugar in half.  Next time I might try adding some white tea leaves as well.

This tea was very nice. Smells like mulled wine when cooking but obliviously no alcohol. My Fiance even liked it and he wont usually try fruit tea but the smell of this one got him and he really liked it as did I. I halved the receipe just for us two and got enough for a decent mugs worth each. Definately do again sometime. Recommended if you like mulled wine and/or cranberries.

So good.  The cloves are a natural pain anaesthetic and were great for the sore throats and stuffy noses my husband I were nursing in January.  The only change I made was to add a little more orange and extra cloves.  So good, I have made this about five times now.

I was pleasantly surprised that something so easy could be so delicious. I used a lime instead of a lemon. I will say that cutting the sugar in half would probably be okay; I think the flavor of honey would go well with this, for those who want a sweeter cup. Also, try adding some Jameson for a special treat :D

Great recipe, I was a bit skeptical, but the flavors of this blend together perfectly. I used brown sugar instead of white and cut it down to 1 1/4 cups, along with a good squirt of honey.

This was a big hit at my cookie exchange last night. I think we would have polished off the whole batch (we were a small group) if only it weren't so sweet. I suggest only 1-1/2 cups of sugar or maybe even just 1 cup and then sweetening as you go. I will cut leftovers with fizzy water as that also sounds like a good idea to cut that cloying sweetness.

After having to quit coffee, I have been making several types of fresh teas.  My favorite flavors to add to this would be a couple of pears (or apples)and about an inch of ginger. I don't pre-sweeten. Slice the ginger very thinly, and cube the pear.  You can save the dredge of cranberries, pears, and ginger to make a nice fruit compote, or add to oatmeal or rice for breakfast the next day.

I've made this recipe two times, the first with red hots (candy) instead of cinnamen (i have awful spelling) sticks. And then the 2nd time, i made it using the sticks. I perfered it with the red hots. I think that it added a different, yet still cinnamony taste. :)

I just made this and absolutely love it.  I'm cooling it down to take to my MOPs group.  I only steeped the cinnamon and cloves for about 20 minutes, though.  Just my preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was refreshing, healthy and wonderfully festive. I will cut back on the sugar next time and maybe even use honey instead, though, because it was a bit too sweet for our taste. Also, I added six lemongrass leaves, since I have it growing in the yard and we love lemongrass as a tea and as an herb. This is deffinintely a keeper. Thank you!

i loved it! i use Lakanto or stevia for the sweetener, so its not so high in sugar. i make it just to have on hand for a hot winter drink. Really helps on super cold Wisconsin nights.

I've been looking for this recipe for years and  am so excited to finally find it.  I had it at a school Christmas function when my daughter was young and failed to get the recipe from the woman who brought it.  I didn't have any whole cloves on hand so I put a couple of dashes of ground cloves in it.  It was absolutely wonderful, though my husband asked for me to add another 1/2 cup of sugar to it which I didn't think it needed.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

An instant Christmas tradition. It even impressed the mother-in-law. I always make sure I use whole spices, actual lemons, and the whole shebang. The presentation and aroma of a punch bowl of Cranberry Tea is irresistible. (As a side note, I've also had success brewing it in the slow cooker.)

This tasted like fruit punch to me. I used 1.5 cups of sugar.

It was alright for me. I made it once and I'm happy with it, I don't know if I'll make it again. It was on the sweet side for me, but that's easily something I could have controlled.  I'm glad I tried it.
