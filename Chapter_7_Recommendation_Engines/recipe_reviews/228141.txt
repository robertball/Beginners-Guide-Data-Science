We really liked this dish and plan to have it often.  I was afraid that the spices would overwhelm it but they turned out to be perfectly balanced.  The only thing we thought it lacked was salt, but we add that at the table anyway.  We did make a couple of changes in this.  The flounder fillets I had to work with were incredibly thin and I was afraid the double breading would overwhelm it.  So I skipped dipping it in the egg and the second dredging.  The single layer of flour coating turned out to be plenty, but with a thicker fish it would be better with the extra breading and would probably deserve the 5.  I also cut way back on the amount of oil I used.  I used only 1/4 cup and got it VERY hot before I added the fillets.  Cooked in a flash and worked very well.

This is very easy to make and has a great flavor. . I followed the recipe exactly, the only tweak I'll make next time is a pinch of salt.

This was delicious! I substituted black pepper instead of cayenne because my kids would be eating it.  Still turned out very flavorful. I even was a bit short on the marinade cuz I had over a pound of fish and it was still perfect! The batter is nice and light which I like for fish. Will definitely make again!

Was very pleased with this recipe! I did add salt to the flour. It may have been a bit bland without it. My son did not like the’fruity’ taste the lemon gave it but he’s just a kid lol. I will make this again and maybe try broth in place of the lemon juice just for him.

It was very flavorful!  I used Cod . I replaced the dill with oregano.  I also used a half flour half breadcrumb mix.  I will make this again and again!
