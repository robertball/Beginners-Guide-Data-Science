This was recommended to me when I did a recipe request. I will say I was doubtful, but after trying it, I'm hooked. Tastes just like a rootbeer barrel. I think I might just go fix another and sit with a big stupid smile on my face, ;)

This is such a yummy drink, but look out because it doesn't take long to get drunk because it goes down so easy!

This really good!  I'm a huge fan of Jagerbombs (sugar-free Rd Bull & jager) so when I stumbled across this recipe I thought I'd give it a try.  Now, I honestly don't remember the last time i drank root beer, so it may be the root beer taste that I'm enjoying, but this is good!  My only complaint is Diet Root Beer isn't usually on the menu out so I don't think I'll be wasting calories on "real" root beer when dining out, but I'll def keep some diet root beer at the house for Diet Drunk Germans!

Great drink!  I've always been looking for something to mix with Jager - just to add a little variety to the "Almighty" Jager shot ;););)

Jagermeister, meaning hunt master is a German bitter liqueur. Dating from the seventh century it is made of a complex blend of 56 herbs, fruits and spices. In my study of German, this was enjoyable research. I had never heard of this liqueur but it was easy to find. Very relaxing beverage. I plan on sharing this with others.

Ut oh.  These really are as good as everyone says they are.  And knowing full well what Jager does to me, I'm going to be in for an interesting evening, LOL!  My new hubby doesnt even like Jager, and he's joining in as well, because even he likes this drink.  Woohoo! Jager is evil!

A friend left a bottle of jagermeister at my house, and since I don't enjoy it plain, I did an ingredient search and found this recipe.  It is a great use for this type of liquor!

This goes down real smooth and tastes sooooooo good! IT'S LETHAL STUFF! My husband and I both loved it, though. It's also great with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream in a beer mug. Thanks for an awesome drink.

This was a great drink. I had a dinner party for 11 and served these as guests came in.  The women loved it, the men preferred German beers.  I gave it 5 stars for good flavor and ease of preparation.  It doesn't get much better than that.

They go down very easy. I usually hear this mixed drink called a "Jim Morrison".

Goes down easy.  Will make you drunk.  Easy to make, and very sweet.  Okay if you like root beer.
