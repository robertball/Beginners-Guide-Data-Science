This is a fast and simple recipe.  I precooked the apples with the sugar (reduced to 1/2 c.) until tender and juices were reduced.  Allowed to cool, then mixed in raisins, cinnamon (only 1 teaspoon), and walnuts.  Precooking the apples kept the juices from making the pastry soggy on the bottom and assured that the apples were cooked completely.

I made one strudel as the recipe stated and made another one with my changes.  The original recipe was overly sweet IMHO, the 2 teaspoons of cinnamon overwhelmed the strudel, and the apples were still a little firm. 

I folded the end of the pastry over the filling before folding over like an envelope, no fruit or juices escaped out the ends.

Yes, I used Apple pie filling as I had decided to make this at the last minute. Made my own sugar topping with raw sugar and 1 packet vanilla sugar mixed sprinkled over egg wash.
Before it was completely cooled I sprinkled red and green sprinkles as it's time for the holidays.

Next time I won't use as much sugar. It was a little on the sweet side for me. But my husband seemed to enjoy it. So I will probably make it again.

Yummy! Yummy! Easy to make and tastes great. There was so much apple filling that I made a second strudel.
