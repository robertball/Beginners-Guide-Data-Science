My suggestion is to cook the bacon first and then brown the chicken in the bacon grease. Leave about a tablespoon of the grease in the pan and deglaze with the wine scraping up all of the browned goodness. Then poor this into the slow cooker. This will give more flavor.

I used a wine I didn't like  and the chicken turned out quite good. The seasonings and chicken broth helped. I also used some very aged mushrooms cooked in butter for extra flavour.

It was ok but Iâ€™d stuck with a traditional cooking receipt next time for this classic French dish

Added onions and mushrooms rosemary and thyme. Cooked it 4 hours and it was done. However we did not like it at all. Maybe because I bought an inferior wine.

Turned out just okay. We skipped the bacon and only did 2 cups of wine because it was making SO much stew. Tried to thicken it up a bit with corn starch afterwards. Just was lacking some flavor, maybe because I used dried rosemary. Would have to figure out a way to tweak it to increase flavor for next time.
