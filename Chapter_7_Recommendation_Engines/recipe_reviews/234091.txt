This smells amazing! Brines are always a must when I make turkey.  I brined a turkey breast overnight and it came out super juicy.  I loved all the added aromatics and flavors, however this was a little sweet for my tastes. Next time I would cut back the sugar to about 1 cup, especially with the additional sugar in the apple cider. Just be sure to rinse with water thoroughly after removing from the brine, and to use KOSHER salt, not table salt.

This will be my third thanksgiving using this recipe. It is a wonderful recipe producing the moistest turkey for the big day. We use to hate the white related to it's dryness. This is no longer the case as the white meat, using this brining recipe stays so moist. No more battles over the dark meat. The ingredients add a wonderful flavor. Love it!

I cut the sugar down to 1 cup simply because I didn't have it on hand!  Loved it
