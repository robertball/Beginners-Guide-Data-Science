We really enjoyed these. I doubled the recipe and replaced 1/2lb of beef with pork because I needed to use up the pork. I loved using the brown rice instead of bread crumbs. I used a whole lot of black pepper and it was great. The fried onions were a nice touch. I usually like some kind of tomato flavour with my meatloaf but I didn't miss it here. Thanks Joyce. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe looks great. I'm going to make it today. Just a note though...Worcestershire Sauce, delicious and fragrant as it is,  is not gluten free. I only mention this in case people are staying 100% way from gluten for health reasons.

This recipe is delicious and free of so many allergens.  No gluten and no dairy. I also substituted half of the ground beef with ground pork.  I used the leanest ground beef I could find and it was still very juicy and good.  The grilled onions on top make it extra tasty. I will definitely make it again.

I think this is my new favorite meatloaf recipe found here on Allrecipes. I wasn't sure if I would like the cooked brown rice as an ingredient, but it worked wonderfully!  I liked that it did NOT use a sugary, "ketchupy" (I know, it's not a real word) or gravy topping. The fried onions make a perfect, tasty topping.  I doubled the recipe and like other reviewers, I used half pork and half beef. I also used a standard muffin tin and formed 12 meatloaf muffins. Terrific recipe! I will come back to this one. Thanks Joyce, for submitting your recipe.

I gave it 5 stars because it was a very easy and tasty recipe to make. Of course you can alter anything to make it more or less whatever you'd like. But this recipe is great as is!

Hubby , who doesn’t care for meatloaf, liked this. He said it was a keeper. I did add some baby Bella mushrooms to the carmelized onions midway .

The meat loaves themselves without sauce were winners. My sauce made this a 5 star recipe at my house. Just didn’t have time for the onions so made the sauce in a jiffy while loaves were still cooking. Cooked about 30 minutes. Rather than onions I made a sauce 1/2 C ketchup, 1/3 C brown sugar, 1 tablespoon prepared mustard. Mix and heat on stove top. Spread over cooked mini meat loaves. Delicious! Still would like to try this with the onions.
