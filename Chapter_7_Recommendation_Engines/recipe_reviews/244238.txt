This was a very easy recipe to get together and had great flavor.   It  does have more sodium using the onion soup mix than I would normally use on roasted vegetables, so, it wouldn't be something I use every time, but, it was a nice change from my normal recipe.    I did need to cook mine about 40 minutes to cook the carrots and to get a little color on the vegetables.   I also didn't need quite as much oil as suggested in the recipe.

I made it with potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, onions, and yellow peppers.  I liked the onion soup mix for flavor, but the oil was too much.  the next time I will use less oil.  The vegetables were too greasy for my taste.

A new, easy family favorite!  I like to do a bag of small potatoes, half a bag of baby carrots, one pepper, one onion, and sometimes add mushrooms.  Delicious and easy!  I normally serve with "Awesome Slow Cooker Pot Roast."

My husband was recently put on a low fat/low cholesterol regiment.  These veggies work well with his diet and are just delicious.  He's never cared much for roasted veggies until now.  We both LOVE them!!!  Super Simple!  I've made them multiple times and this recipe is now in my normal veggie rotation.  (I delete the peppers, as we are not fans, and add parsnips - sometimes sweet potato too if I have one on hand)

Made this for the first time yesterday and it came out awesome. Did not use that much oil, just a drizzle. Also added mushroom and old bay seasoning with half the suggested onion soup mix. Will definitely make it again.

So good!! I did reduce the oil used by a little bit, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This suits my palate perfectly! I’m currently pregnant and finished half in one sitting.

Lovely twist to the average potato serving. I was concerned about the amount of olive oil but if everybody cooks to the right consistency somehow the oil blends so nicely with an interesting sort of roast beef n vegies/ potatoes taste minus the meat. I will keep this on my table. 
Thanks

I have always loved the Lipton onion soup mix for making burgers but this ended up being just as delicious! I didn’t realize if you add some red pepper and add some spice to it.

Insanely tasty and filling! Way too much oil for my preference though, I added more veggies than the recipe asks for, and it was still greasy as all getup.. Aside from needing to pull back on the oil flow, this is a really easy and delicious dish. I added broccoli florets to soak up some of the oil and onion mix and they make for very tasty flavour-packed tiny trees! Also great for students on a budget.

This was quick and easy and delicious for a comparable side dish to pair with salmon. I've used one-third of one restaurant style baked potato and sliced it in half, not as in wedges. I also used  yellow , red and orange peppers and did a small amount of onions. The mix coated it very well, though it would've been better on foil than the baking pan alone. I would make it again with fresh salmon.

Loved it except the salt will look at the “homemade” onion soup one of the other reviewers mentioned.
My wife loved it and she isn’t big on veggies

Tasty. Made as written aside from using cut carrots, not baby carrots. Roasted for the full 30 minutes. Might try less oil next time.

I think this is an excellent way to prépare vegetables but I agree with many others that it does not need 1/2 cup of olive oil.  Next time I make this I will use 1/4 cup. Also, I suggest that you keep an eye on this is the oven as there is a chance that the onion soup will start to burn.  I think it may be a good idea to use a spatula to turn the vegetables on the sheet pan after about 10 minutes.  I used a small sheetpan and I used a pyrex dish to bake the vegetables.  Both of them got crispy but I think the metal sheet pan got hotter and burned some of the vegetables.  I like how crispy they were but mine on the sheetpan got a little over done.  I would serve this to company. But, I always try a recipe before hand just to see how it turns out so that I know what to expect.  Great recipe for every day and I think also very good for when you're entertaining. VERY EASY!!!

I made it, following the recipe.  I cut the vegetables a little smaller to make sure it was done in time for dinner.  I used rosemary infused olive oil and it was so good, my guests asked for the recipe!

I pretty much guessed at the normal amount of oil drizzle I used with less onion soup mix as well.  LOVED it. 
Thank you for the inspiration.  I will use some fresh sage or rosemary as I have available next time.

I used less oil and some fresh rosemary, garlic salt and pepper instead of onion soup mix but the recipe was inspirational. I will make it with the soup mix but when I make venison or roast beef.

Easy and delicious!
I also added parsnip. Divided it onto 2 trays and roasted for 20mins! I used 2 packets of onion soup mix and red peppers instead of green bell peppers.  Perfection! Will definitely make again!
