This is pretty good.  The texture was a little odd, but that was because of the pound of ricotta! Mmmmm!  Also, I put the salt in the water for the noodles, because it didn't say what to do with it.  I might try it in the mixture next time.

This was very good. I put strawberry topping on it and made it even better.
