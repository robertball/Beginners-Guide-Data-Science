I added zest of one lemon to the wet inredients, and borrowed an idea from MANDA2BH and added the lemmon glaze  "tsp of lemon juice, 2 tsps of water and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar together and brushed over the cookies once they were done." Made an exquizit cookie!

This recipe was great.  It did make a little more than 4 dozen cookies.  It made about 6 for me.  Also, I made an iced lemon glaze to brush over the cookies because they really didn't have a distinctive taste.  I just mixed 1 tsp of lemon juice, 2 tsps of water and 1/2 cup of powdered sugar together and brushed over the cookies once they were done.  My husband really doesn't like lemon desserts, but loved these cookies.

Very good soft sugar cookie. I thought it had too much of a nutmeg taste though.  But I will definitely make it again and just omit the nutmeg. Makes more than 4 dozen, about 5 dozen.

I haven't baked these yet, but I can tell you, I couldn't mix them, too much flour, had to add another egg, as well as more buttermilk, should be interesting to see how they turn out. Almost burnt out my mixer, had to mix by hand. 
Update, did not care for these cookies.

These were great with some buttercream frosting- my mom wanted the recipe right away, but would want NO frosting-so preferences vary! I will make again- my roommate said they remind her of her grandma's- she loved them!

These were very good and easy to make. My family loved them. I didn't substitute the buttermilk the first time I made them but if you have to a cup of milk mixed with a tablespoon of white vinegar works though actual buttermilk is the best as it is thicker.

I guess I was warned that these would be cake-like - they certainly were!  I was hoping for a cookie I could ice, but they were way too poofy.  Oh well!

We loved this recipe!  I used the suggestion to brush a lemon glaze on top of the cookie, and my family loved it. Thanks for sharing!

These were the worst cookies I've ever had. A complete waste of $5.00 in butter. I can't get the taste of baking powder off my tongue.

Pretty tasty cookies and easy to make. As some other reviewers suggested, I think they would be even better with some sort of glaze. The dough is velvety in texture and makes pretty cookies!

This is a great spiced sugar cookie.  I love it the way it is, but, may omit the nutmeg the next time for a more plain cookie so I can ice them for the kids.  All in all, a great recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make.  It was a soft cookie which I didn't expect, but it is delicious.  This a good, quick recipe that I will make again.

I had to substitute (milk + cream of tartar) for the buttermilk.  But I can't imagine this substitution would have rendered them the complete inedible mess they were. They flattened to nothing.  If this is all because of my substitution, my apologies!

I was looking for a good soft sugar cookie recipe.  These are awesome!  Super soft, sweet but not too sweet.  I left the nutmeg out altogether because I didn't have any.  Pretty sure I wouldn't put it in if I did have it.  If you're looking for a "great for dunking in chocolate milk" cookie, this is it!!

This is different kind of sugar cookie, it soft like a tea cake and very plain. I added lemon zest and I had to add a lemon glaze because this is NOT a sweet cookie. It has to be spread out are you will have a large puff. I didn't use the nutmeg. Overall it is a good cookie.

I just tried this recipe. The texture was quite nice but the flavour was surprisingly bland.

They don't look anything like the picture. I was hoping that the cookies would flatten out but nothing worked. As well I thought they would have an intense vanilla flavour but ended up bland. Cake-like yes but that seemed to be the only redeeming factor. I am always on the hunt for an awesome sugar cookie - this was very disappointing.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. Instead of buttermilk I use a cup of milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice & I omitted the nutmeg. DELICIOUS!!!
