Way to go Rodnobi!  Sure hope you notice this review of your SPECTACULAR cookies.  I cannot speak highly enough of your recipe, let alone these cookies.  I don't use butter-flavored shortening so I just used the traditional type and I prepared the dough exactly as specified. I would do precisely the same thing next time - to do otherwise would be messing with perfection. I did NOT, however, grease the cookie sheets. Perfectly spiced, perfectly cinnamony, perfectly tender, light, crispy and chewy.  Perfectly beautiful too. This is just a perfect cookie all the way around! I used Hershey's cinnamon chips which I know are only sold in limited regions of the country. But the cinnamon chips are really essential in this cookie so if you can, do seek them out rather than eliminating them or making substitutions.  While it may be pricey to order them online, I've seen them at King Arthur Flour, Calico Bean Market and on Amazon.  One of the better cookies I've ever made, above average in my opinion. Great "cookie-jar" cookie.

I cut this recipe in half and I also made a few small substitutions to make up for what I didn't have on hand. I don't have shortening on hand so I used butter in it's place. I don't normally keep a lot of brown sugar on hand and I never have dark brown sugar on hand at all so I used half white and half light brown sugar and for the extra quarter cup of dark brown that the recipe asked for, I added 1/4 cup of molasses (which is what google told me to sub in a pinch). To compensate for the extra moisture that the molasses added to the recipe, I added an additional quarter cup of flour. I did not add the full amount of salt, a half teaspoon was plenty. After I added the one cup of cinnamon chips, I didn't think that was near enough so I dumped the rest of the bag in. The more the merrier, right? This recipe turned out a soft and chewy cookie, which is a favorite in this house. Very cinnamon-y and just......wonderfully comforting. What I liked best about this cookie dough is it was ready to go right off, you didn't have to chill the dough, even with using butter, and it didn't spread much and it adapted well to substitutions, which I think speaks volumes for a great recipe. I'll make this again! NOTE: Next time I make these, I'll roll them in sugar. I think they might be prettier that way.

I followed the recipe almost to the T.  I used butter instead of shortning and since I had not dark brown sugar I used all light, and they turned out excellent.  This recipe made 26 large cookies scooped with my ice cream scooper.  An excellent fall cookie!

These were great, I followed the recipe exactly!  I made them as part of our cookie exchange and everyone loved them.  These will be on our list for next year.

These were mentioned on the Buzz the other day and I had a bag of cinnamon chips sitting in my cabinet forever, so I thought I'd give them a try.  Holy delicious cookies....if I could give them more than 5 stars I would.  They had the perfect hint of cinnamon and spice and the chips just put them over the top.  I didn't add the pecans, because the guys here don't like them, but next time I will add them to a batch, because I know the crunch would make them even better.  These cookies give me the perfect excuse to stock up on cinnamon chips!

I used butter instead of shortening. And I replaced 2 cups of the all-purpose flour with 2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour.  These are so soft, plump, easy, and yummy. In a word AWESOME!

I loved this cookie...and so did all in the cookie exchange!  I too added more cinnamon...and I couldn't find any cinnamon chips, so I used white chocolate chips instead.  A full flavor cookie...loved it!!

These are AMAZING!  The only change I made was to use regular shortening (didn't have butter flavored) and I didn't add the nuts.  Hubby said they reminded him of a cinnamon bun.  Note: I got slightly over 60 cookies.  Cookie perfection!

These cookies are wonderful!!  Yum!  A great use of cinnamon chips, which I love.  My 4 year old named them "The Best cookie in the world".
I halved the receipe and still got 3 dozen good size cookies (using a large cookie scoop).  I used parchament paper on the cookie sheets, and did use the pecans chopped finely.  Delicious!

Great cookies. Made 10 dozen with a 1 TBSP cookie scoop. Next time I'd halve it. I made no substitutions and loved them.

These were woooonderful! Only thing I'd change is if you prefer a more solid, crunchy cookie, you may want to bake them for few minutes longer. My first batch I took out at 10 minutes (I like more chewy cookies) but they were still very wet. Second batch I let go about 15 minutes and they were perfect. Still chewy, but solid! Thanks for this recipe, definitely a keeper!!

I made these almost exactly by the recipe except (1) I didn't have shortening so I used butter, and (2) I didn't have nutmeg or cloves so I substituted pumpkin pie spice. They were a huge hit. They have a really smooth spice flavor and the chips are just a perfect complement. We will be making these again and again!

I did use all butter instead of shortening in this recipe, so my cookies were flatter than what is pictured.  The cinnamon chips I used are from King Arthur Flour, and those are the best-tasting ones I have tried.  I didn't use the pecans because of the little girls I was making these for.   These are delicious, buttery cookies!  They are a big hit with my audience!  Thanks for the recipe!

Following the recipe exactly as written, these were the most amazing cookies I've ever made!  I have to say...if a guy made me these and then served them warm with a scoop of vanilla or maple walnut ice cream and caramel sauce drizzled over top...I'd say yes to them!!!

These are the best new cookies I've found in a long time!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were a huge hit with family and friends.  Nice and chewy, which is hard to find in cookie recipes -- maybe it's all the brown sugar!  I think these would be almost as delicious with chocolate chips, if I didn't have any cinnamon chips.

A tasty cookie! My kids weren't crazy about it, but my coworkers loved them. Maybe a cookie that's more for adult tastes. Great with a cup of coffee!

I think my main problem with this recipe is that I didn't like the cinnamon chips very much. The only brand I could find was Hershey's so I don't know if another brand would be better. I got several compliments from others on the cookies, though, so maybe it was just me. I did add a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips since the cinnamon chips I bought were in a bag with 1 2/3 c instead of 2 c. I left out the nuts and increased the cinnamon to 2 1/2 tsp and the cloves to 1/2 tsp. Oh, and I substituted unsalted butter for one cup of the shortening.

I love these cookies! They're a bit off the beaten path and so tasty. I did a few things differently out of necessity, though. I only had light brown sugar, so I added a tablespoon of molasses to compensate.  Also, instead of 1 1/2 cups of Butter Flavor Crisco, I used 1 cup of regular shortening and 1/2 cup of softened butter. This produced a cookie that may be a bit different in texture from what was intended (a little flatter, a little crisper around the edges). The one thing I would change, and this may be because I used salted butter, is to reduce the salt to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Still, very very very tasty cookie.

I haven't made them yet but I wanted to tell everyone I ordered the cinnamon chips online.  Also wanted to ask about the light molasses I can't find any so was wondering if I could used light Karo OR regular molasses.  Let me know please.

These cookies are delicious and remind me of gingersnaps.  I guess I'm not a fan of the cinnamon chips because the chips ended up making the cookies too sweet for me.  I will continue making the cookie dough without the cinnamon chips.  I used half shortening and half butter for the recipe.

Very nice.  They flatten well if you just let them cool on the pan and they have a nice flavor of salty, sweet, and cinnamon.  Plus, if you underbake slightly you get chewy, yet soft cookies.  A great addition to my Christmas cookie tins.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good cookie! crisp outside and chewy inside, just perfect! Love the cinnamon flavor. Great fall season cookie!
