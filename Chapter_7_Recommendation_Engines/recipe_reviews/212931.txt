Great recipe. A bit time consuming because of making the shredded chicken but so delicious I've made it a few times now (and I'm very picky about recipes when they take over 45 minutes to make). Achiote powder was hard to find. You might look for it under Annatto seed instead if you can't find it (it's a bright red powder). This flavor is what really makes this dish, in my opinion.

I used oyster ear mushrooms and turmeric (it was all I had) and added shredded cabbage to the boil (for the fiber ;) ).  I dipped a warm hard roll in it, added a light salad and some iced tea.  More than a meal.  I thought it was an excellent recipe and far better even than I expected.

This had a wonderful flavor. I couldnt find achiote powder so i used achiote paste and it didnt desolve well, but it was still very tasty. I think next time ill add a bit more broth because i like it a little more soupy. Im half filipino so this was a comforting and nostalgic dish.

Ginger is a must add!  My grandma does it that way too and it adds a whole other level of flavor.  This is my comfort food go to.

Despite the extra preparations needed, it was well worth the trouble for a really good Pinoy comfort food. I didn't have the achiote powder, but it was not missed. Thank you for another wonderful recipe, Lola!

This was comfort food to me...similar to my Mom's. The older I get the more I want to learn Filipino recipes for my daughter to eat since she is mestiza. A little time consuming but worth it... I couldn't find the achiote powder but I found the seed so I crushed it to powder (be careful it may stain). I will have to try it with cabbage and carrots next time. I like my veggies. Also, my mom adds ginger to her recipe. Super tasty!

Incredible . The best ever. I have a chineese exchange student, and she raved about it.

Most of the work of course is boiling the chickenand shredding. Otherwise it's really good and easy. Next time, I"ll turn off the pot a little earlier as the noodles became soft later. Definitely add ginger to make it like Moms.

We made this tonight and it was wonderful.  I highly recommend it and will make it again.  I also used a mixture of turmeric and paprika which I found on the internet as a substitute for achiote powder.
