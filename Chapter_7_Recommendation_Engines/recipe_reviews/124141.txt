Putting the apples through a food processor after peeling/coring is definitely a time saver.  I have made this twice now - great reviews from everyone, young & old.  Nothing like kick starting your morning with an applie pie taste to your toast. :)  I get 7 jars of jam from this recipe.  THANK YOU for posting this!!

Amazing! I made this as a Christmas gift, and it was so appreciated. Thanks for the awesome recipe! I actually made the jam two days before Christmas. Just a note: The jam takes two days to fully set and I found that I added a lot more than half a cup of water to the apples. If you need to, add water little by little until you achieve the right consistency. I also mashed my apples at the the end of their cooking to make sure the jam was not to chunky.

Great!  It was also my first try at jam and has turned out great!  I used about a cup of water.  Next time I will add a little less nutmeg (it was a little too spicey for me) and will also make sure I chop my apples smaller (it looks great in the jar but it is a little to chunky when eating it).

This jam tastes divine.  I made two batches; one yesterday, one today.  For the firt batch, I ran the apples through my food processor, and decided to forgo the spices in favor of a more caramelly flavor.  For the second batch, I diced the apples as directed and used the spices.  I'm not sure what happened, but the first batch set up wonderfully and tasted delicious.  However, the second batch remained syrupy, though I followed the recipe more exactly.  I'm not sure why, but jam is like that sometimes!  Still, even though it didn't set up, that second batch is going to be a delicious syrup for pancakes, so it won't be wasted.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This jam is awesome.  I agree with other posts/reviews that it tastes more like apple pie that caramel apples.  I had a tonne of applesauce in the freezer so I used 6 cups of sauce and left out the butter.  I used everything else as listed and it turned out amazing.  I made two batches and ended up getting 19 - 250 ml jars.  This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe tastes great, but I have issues. Understand you are making applesauce into a "jam". So process your apples in your favorite way and then follow this recipe. There are certainly more time and product efficient ways to process apples than dicing them. This has similar flavor to the "All Day Apple Butter" on this site without the all day cooking. Because you are using pectin you are actually gelling the liquid instead of cooking it out,so,I suppose one could call it a jam in stead of apple butter. But- apples have pectin naturally adding pectin just makes it gell faster. I tried this recipe because it sounded interesting, but I doubt I will make it again.

I have made this twice now and it is so good! It tastes just like apple pie. I use my food chopper to chop the apples really small. This is really easy and it makes a great presentation in the jar. I'm planning on making this for Christmas gifts if I don't eat it all first!

This is a great base recipe. Based on my jamming experience, I modified as follows: I increased the water to a full cup, added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the chopped apples, reduced the white sugar to 2-1/2 cups, and for spices I added 1 teaspoon apple pie spice (makes it taste like apple pie.) I've canned three batches so far (the recipe gives me a little over 6 half pints) and the feedback from friends and family is really good. Note that sometimes the jam takes a day or two to really set.

Why isn't this recipe famous???  It is the MOST DELICIOUS fruit-based recipe I've ever made and the flavor is out of this world.  I sliced (not chopped) my apples, so it didn't set up like jam and I've been using as cheesecake and pancake toppings.  I'm also eating the apples right out of the jar...mmm.

I'd like to hear from the author...  I found this jam to  be very thick.  Are you sure only 1/2 cup water is needed?  Otherwise, very good flavor

12/26/10:  I'll have to come back and rate again when I've tried this jam, but for now I'll just rate on the process.  I processed the apples--worked really well.  I got 6 full jelly jars out of this and had about 1/4 left over.  It looks beautiful, and it jelled just fine.  Not sure about other's issues with the pectin, but mine worked well and jelled the day I made it.  It was very easy, too.  Don't be afraid of the water bath processing if you've never done it--all you need is a large pot of boiling water:  put the jam in your jars, seal, then place in the water for ten minutes, then take out.  The jars should seal--you'll hear a popping sound--as they cool.  Mine usually seal within a 1/2 hour or so, although one took a lot longer than that--no matter, it still sealed.  Any jars that don't seal can be reprocessed or stored in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe!  Update 2/12/11:  We had this for breakfast on toast and we think it's delicious!  The caramel flavor is subtle, but I think it's still there.  I like the combo of spices and brown sugar; if you added more brown sugar and less spices you might get more caramel flavor, but I have to say we love it as is.  I'm glad I processed the apples so they weren't big chunks, but even so, it looks and tastes very good.  For those of you still having difficulty with the jam setting, try following the pectin package directions; sometimes that helps.  Thanks for the recipe!

I refrained from adding the spices - opting for more of a pure caramel flavor.  Changed the measurements for the 2 sugars to 50/50%.  Still didn't give me the caramel taste I was hoping for.  Next time - I'll increase the brown sugar amount....

Overall this is a great recipe! I did however make a few adjustments per reviews of others. 
I used 1 cup water and 1/4 c. butter to cook apples in. After cooking apples I used hand blender to mash up the real soft apples, but left chuncks to make the jam look pretty in the jar (which it does look beautiful). 
Another note that I think may be useful is that the recipe calls for 1.75 oz package of pectin, but I buy the pectin in the bulk jar, not packets, so after much research I found that 3.5 Tbsp is equal to a 1.75 oz packet.
The jam is great! delicious on a slice of wheat toast with coffee in the morning!
Thanks for the recipe :)

5 star definitely! with one modification, chopping the apples small, really small. Like everyone mentions, it doesn't really taste like caramel, but it does have the caramel color. A few things to consider: My sister-in-law made some soon after I did and all she had was dark brown sugar (I used light brown) and I think it looks better with the light brown sugar, though they both tasted excellent. And also, when it says to bring the water and apples to a boil, it doesn't really boil, per se, because it's not like you've got a soupy/watery texture yet, so more just wait to hear air bubbles rise to the surface (little air noises -poof-). If you make this you might know what I mean. I only added 1/2 c water, like the recipe states and so you aren't going to get a "boil". Anyways, and yes, once you add the sugars, it gets very liquidy, then it will boil. Oh, and sooo incredibly tasty on fresh baked cinnamon raisin bread. Almost makes me want to carve a pumpkin or rake leaves or something. Very "fall" tasting.

This was very good. It made 7 8oz jars. I used Pink Lady apples fresh from the orchard and diced them small. I left the skin on and it didn't affect any of the setting process or the taste. I did add a sprinkle of apple pie spice by accident (misread my spice jars) and it seems to have enhanced the apple pie flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I also made a few modifications.  I used 1 and 1/4 c unsweetened apple juice.  Also I blended the apples (left a few chunks for aesthetic appeal).  Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  We love it..thanks for sharing!

Quite savory!  After looking at the comments I thought about omitting the spices because I thought it may taste more like a caramel apple.  I'm glad I didn't.  I will say I think it should be called apple pie jam.

I am giving this a 5 star because I am sure it would have been. My husband was helping me make this. While I was stirring he was adding ingredients and i suddenly smelled chili, well he put cumin in it instead of cinnamon. We went with it and added more cinnamon and nutmeg to cover the taste. Can't do anthing but laugh! Still taste great! Although I have to say it was not a quick recipe to make, Someone time consuming comapred to most Jelly recipes.

I made this twice and both times the jam did not set up properly. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that the initial part of the recipe, cooking the apples with a tiny amount of liquid and butter, results in very little liquid in which to boil the pectin. I did use a food processor to chop the apples (so much faster) and that sped things along, but I have to say I'm disappointed in this one. I'm going to try and re-make the jam but would have much preferred that it come out right the first time.

As a sampler said today, Apple Pie in a jar. Did not find this to taste like caramel apple. Will make again only will reverse the sugars and omit the nutmeg, in an attempt to enhance the caramel taste.  Very good recipe as it is, just would call it something other than caramel apple jam.

Yummy....so yummy that I have none left. Makes a great gift! I used fresh apples from my grandparents apple tree and diced them into very small chunks in the food processor.

I made this a few months ago. As it was the first time with this recipe, I followed it exactly. It took a bit longer than the 1 minute of boiling time for mine to set up, but I believe that to be a problem of high elevation cooking. This is simply FANTASTIC! Everyone who has tasted it loved it. Thank you Robert Atwood for the best jam recipe I've ever had.

Ok I made this today and I really did change it up.  I used 3 pkgs of ham glaze that we did not use on our sprial cut hams insstead of the sugar and brown sugar. Plus it already had the spices added to them. Did not add water but the apples and pectin the exact same.  I did use 3 tbs. butter and it is GREAT!  Really good on top of cream cheese puffs.

Tasty....but this did not set up as I thought it should. My neighbors enjoyed it and compared it to a "chutney" in texture or as a great topping for ice cream. This was my first ever attempt at any jam so I was nervous to boot. My jars sealed properly and again it was pretty yummy tasting. Just not firm and spreadable as I would have hoped. I did run my apples through the food processor for finer pieces. Other then that made 7 jars of jam, thanks for my first "canning" experience.

We have never had apple jam before but I was tired of apple butter so I decided to make jam this year instead with our apples from the orchard.  I used Mcintosh apples, followed the recipe, and it turned out wonderfully so I made 2 batches!  The first batch made 7 jam jars with a little extra I put in the fridge and the second made 9- I think this is because I was a little quicker with the second batch and didn't let it simmer for so long.  Will make again and am planning on giving it for Christmas!

Excellent! Only change was to increase the cinnamon to a full teaspoon, and since my pectin came in a large jar I used 3 1/2 Tbsp after searching online for an equivalent to 1.75 oz.  It set beautifully, with little bits of apple suspended throughout.    Tastes a lot like apple butter, but more jelly-like.  I got six 8-oz. jars (plus another about 3/4 full) out of one recipe.  I used Cortland apples, but would like to make another batch with a more tart apple next time (soon!).  Great recipe!

Fantastic!  You need to make sure and use tart apples because the amount of sugar in this recipe is almost rediculous, almost...  I made up multiple batches and am using them as Christmas presents this year.

Not all that great. The flavor was ok -- but as other reviewers have noted, not much caramel flavor and more like apple pie. With all the work involved -- peeling and chopping -- probably not something I'll try again. I also had trouble getting mine to set up, so I just relabeled it "dessert topping".

Oh wow this is so yummy and good! I took someone's advice and added most of the slow cook mixture of apples to the blender where I pureed it. But I saved a bit of the apples in their chopped form. When I filled the jars the apples glistened as little specks of gold. I cant wait till Christmas to give these to my friends and family ^_^

Excellent fall Jam recipe.  This is my second season making this jam. My family and co-workers look forward to their jar each year.  It is on the sweet side and more like an apple pie than a carmel apple. I was told by a few friends they have put this in the center of an acorn squash in replace of butter and brown sugar. Sounds wonderful and another great use for the jam!

I must have had really sweet apple because I cut the sugars to 1/2 and it was sweet enough for me. I think next time i'd like to food mill the apple and have it be smoother. But I will make it again.

Loved it. I had a bunch of apples from when we took our kids apple picking and made jars and jars of this. I even gave some as gifts and was told how they are having it with everything! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, can't wait to make some more this season!

This product is outstanding.  I made a batch and then made a double and then another double.  I can barely keep up.  I save some time by dicing about half of the apples and grating the rest.

One of the best apple jam recipes I have found. I altered recipe by increasing the water to 1 cup and cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Next time I think I may add raisins.

Absolutely delicious.  Set up very nicely.  I did a batch with and without the spices and both were amazing.  With spices, I call it apple pie jam, without I call it caramel apple.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I made this today and it's like an apple pie in a jar! I used pint jars and it made six and a little extra I put in the refrigerator. I like it chunky so the only thing I can't figure out is how to keep the apple chunks from floating to the top. I am fairly new at this and can't wait to make more. I mixed up my apples and used 1 large fuji, 4 gala and 3 delicious apples. I started with a 1/2 cup of water but it seemed really thick before adding the sugars/spices. Just in case I added another 1/2 cup of water and it was fine.  I also added some (a handful) of frozen cranberries chopped up. I thought the color contrast would be pretty. The cranberries boiled down but it's still really good. Will play more with it and looking forward to making it again.

Love it! My kids love it! I used small green apples that my mother-in-law brought me from her tree. I have 20 jars of this right now that I am saving to give out as gifts. I mash the apples with a potato masher just before adding the pectin and it works great. But I used 3/4 cups of water instead of 1/2 - just seemed like too little. My kids warm this up and eat it as is or with crackers.

It does taste like apple pie...but has a hint of caramel taste.  I did leave some peel on like other cooks suggested.  I used apples from a neighbors tree that were really sour and it came out delicious!  Great recipe!

Wow! Yummy! Loved it, I reduced the recipe to 35 servings because I had a smaller jar. Instead of ground cinnamon, i just threw in 1 cinnamon sticks (broken into 3 pieces) for a more homemade look. Still gave it the same great taste! Great great recipe!

easy, quick, and even though I didn't have nutmeg, I think it tastes pretty good.  Perhaps a bit too sweet, but still good.  The true test will be in a few weeks when we finish the leftovers and crack into a canned jar.

I agree with most of the others - this jam was delicious and just like apple pie!  I added 1 1/2 cups - 2 cups water to the apples to get the right consistency, and for those of you who don't know what the boiling water bath is, skip it.  If you process your jars and lids properly and add the jam while it is hot, you will be fine!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and made two batches.  I got 16 250ml jars out of the two batches.  And the food processor is the way to go!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe, I used the crab apples from my back yard and it is wonderful. I did not peel the apples though, I think it is prettier with that little bit of peel. Very easy to make.

This is a great recipe1 Thank you! I upped the servings considerably and will still have to make more for gifts. I added some vanilla bean to it. Tastes just like great apple pie. My husband puts it on everything from waffles to icecream.

This is GREAT for the holidays!  I made this Carmel Apple Jam as Christmas gifts for everyone at my office.  It was a hit!It's very tasty and is like having desert on your toast in the morning.  One person I gave it to said it was delicious on top of vanilla ice cream.  I think the jam tastes more like apple pie than carmel apples.  Either way, it's quite yummy.

The flavour of this recipe is very nice, and is a nice change from regular jams. I did find I had to add extra liquid. I also found that, despite stirring and skimming, the fruit kept floating to the top of the jar as it was thickening, and so I had to keep turning the jars so all the fruit didn't settle at the top. I agree with the previous reviewers that it tastes more like apple pie than caramel apple, but either way, it is very tasty.

This is delicious.  HOWEVER,  you should keep in mind this recipe only makes TWO pints of jam.  I cut the sugar back in the second batch..........this is very time consuming for such a small amount of jam, and it does taste like apple pie filling, but it is still very yummy.

Made as stated except I used 3 cups brown sugar and 2 cups white sugar.  I really loved this recipe, I left some apples chunky, and it looks good in the jars.  Next time I might use all brown sugar.

Overall a really good recipe to use up those extra apples! I think next time I make it that I will use less nutmeg. That was a bit much for me. I think I will add a bit more brown sugar to get more of a sweeter taste.

First time jam maker and this was very easy and the result was delicious!! I altered it by only using 2 cups brown sugar and no white sugar, used 6 1/2 cups apples and used 1 cup water. Next time I will probably only use 1 cup brown sugar as 2 was still pretty sweet.

I would like to shake this master baker's hand and I don't even like apples!  This was awesome, and I did need to add a little more water to my dry apples but it came out delighfully! It was easy and I had a ton of free apples to deal with. I can't wait to present my jam in my holiday gift baskets.

I made this today, and it turned out great!.  The only thing, I made a double batch, but only got 3 qts, plus a cup full left over.  A lot of apples are needed if you are going to make many quarts of jam.

Great recipe! The pectin doesn't set the jam up too much... the consistency is still like a jam. I always double the recipe to get 12-14 tiny jelly jars full. I've given almost all of them away as gifts. They look beautiful. A great way to get rid of those excess Fall apples! Thanks!

The flavor of this jam is good, but it did not set up as firmly as I would have liked and I followed the directions exactly.  I think next time I'll add a cup of chopped peanuts to make it taste even more like a caramel apple.  Very unusual recipe and will make great Christmas gifts.
