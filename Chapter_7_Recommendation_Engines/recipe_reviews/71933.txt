This is an authentic recipe...We have made it almost all of our lives like this. But have always left out the black pepper and when I can it in mason jars I leave out the cilantro...Tastes smoother. Very Very Good!

This salsa was excellent after I followed suggestions by another reviewer to cook off the raw taste from the salsa.
I cooked the salsa for 5 mins on med to med low heat.I also added lime juice and some ground cumin to add a little more smoke to the flavor. I will make again for sure.

Wonderful!  I used two jalapenos, but will do one next time so it will have heat that doesn't get in the way of the flavor.  Can't say enough about this one.  Only change I made was to do more of a roast (400 degrees for until "roasted" looking, then broil to brown well).  Perfect.  Two of us killed this in about 2 days.

For those of you that aren't certain about roasting the tomatillos, the skin should be very dark brown to black.Also, if you halve the tomatillos and put them cut side down on a foil lined cookie sheet, you don't have to turn them. 
This is the method I use to roast my tomatillos and peppers for Chili Verde and it worked very well for this recipe.

Loved this!!!  I took another reviewers advice and added some finely diced onion at the end. I used 1 1/2 lbs of tomatillos (grew them in the yard--very easy) two jalepenos and added a little ground chipotle (1/4 tsp).  It turned out wonderful.  I highly recommend it.

I LOVE this stuff.  It was surprisingly easy to make, despite the fact that I was nervous about charring vegetables for the first time - also my first go with tomatillos!!!  It doesn't exactly taste "smoky" - maybe I should leave a little more of the charred skin on next time (I wish there was a bit more technical advice in the recipe, because the tomatillos charred up and became very soft, so it was hard to "scrape" them).  It also has some nice spice to it - if you like salsa's very spicy, I would even dare say you could add another jalapeno or two.  This recipe does not make a lot, so if you are preparing it for a party, I would double the recipe (let's put it this way - I could wolf down the whole thing in one sitting if I allowed myself to!!!).

Excellent!  Roasting all the ingredients really makes the difference.  I used three different types of mild peppers in addition to what was called for in the recipe, and added some cumin and cinnamon.  Really worth the time and it keeps really well.

I'm not sure if it's fair of me to rate this because I changed it a little, but I feel I must because I loved what I ended up with so much!  Basically I followed the recipe but instead of the 3 jalepenos I used 1 jalepeno and one poblano pepper, and cored and seeded both of them, to create a mild salsa. When roasting I put the pan on the middle rack and did not preheat, because I thought that would help the tomatillos have time to soften before burning. When one of them split open is when I removed them. I also added about 1/8th cup of chopped red onion to the blender.  WOW! I was blown away by the delicious flavor!

This was a great recipe... VERY spicy!  To tone down the recipe I added lemon juice to the final product.  Very good.  I will make again!

I deviated a bit from the original recipe, but it inspired me to make a great salsa.  I added a few Thai peppers and about an eighth of a red onion, and cut back a bit on the garlic and cilantro.  I also left out the black pepper.  What I came out with was a smoky green salsa with considerable kick.  I'll probably double the recipe next time, because this looks like it'll go pretty quickly.

This was very different, but good.  We used only the jalapenos called for and it was HOT!  It seems to be missing something, but I can't figure out what it is...

AMAZING!! This was my first time using tomatillios and I have been wanting to make a verde salsa for awhile now, so happy to have stumbled upon this recipe.  It was a real crowd pleaser.  I left almost all of the ribs and seeds in from the jalapenos to give it lots of spice.  The roasted flavor from the garlic and jalapenos was phenomenal.  Excellent recipe, thank you, I will DEFINITELY be  making this again and again.

OMG. This was my first year to grow tomatillos and I will be sure to grow them again next year just so I can make this. I used only 2 jalapenos and added lime juice at the end. I then simmered it with some precooked shredded chicken, rolled it all in some tortillas topped with more salsa and some shredded cheese. This recipe is a HOME RUN!

this salsa is amazing! i modified the original recipe a little bit. i used 2 lbs of tomatillos since that was what was ready in my garden that day, 2 jalapenos (the salsa still has quite a kick), 2 heads of garlic, 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro leaves (no stems), 2 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar, 1/4 tspn ground chipolte, and a pinch each of cumin and cinnamon, 1 tspn of salt and omitted the blk. pepper. i used my food processor to grind the garlic and cilantro together with a wee bit of olive oil and then added the peppers and tomatoes and processed until 'smooth'. then i transferred everything to a saucepan, added my seasonings and cooked it all for about 10-15 minutes before transferring to clean, warm ball jars. i yielded 26 ounces of the best tasting salsa i have ever had in my life. really. i wish i knew if i could safely put up a bunch of this because i would load my pantry with it. it is soooo good.

This was quite nice to make and eat, even if it wasn't very spicy at all (I like my salsas blazing-hot). It was also the first time I'd ever cooked with tomatillos, and also (I think) my first time roasting veggies under the broiler. I made it exactly as written, although I might not have roasted the veggies to the required doneness - I was worried about overdoing it. The garlic cloves were a bit browned when I took them out, and the tomatillos and jalapeños were a bit blackened, but not very much. The results had a nice body (I added less than half of the 1/2-cup of water). The refrigerate-until-serving step is a must, I found. I hastily tasted the salsa right after it was put together, and it wasn't that great. The chilling definitely makes a difference. I'd like this a lot hotter, and perhaps should try adding some lime juice like others suggested, but as is, I still enjoyed this a lot - thanks!

I made this salsa and it's just ok. I didnt add any water since I like a very thick salsa. I really liked how the roasted garlic flavor came through. I did add some lemon/lime juice to try and brighten up the salsa and some cilantro, but this just didnt taste bright and vibrant which is what I was looking for. I will continue my search for the best tomatillo salsa.

Excellent salsa! I also didn't add any water or salt and pepper, just wasn't needed. I did make a double batch and it went quickly. Part of it was used to make my version of chicken verde... I saute onions & peppers in EVOO, place in a baking dish, top w/ skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cover w/ a mixture of equal parts of this salsa and sour cream, then sprinkle w/ shredded Monterey Jack cheese and bake at 350F. for 40 min. I served this over steamed rice w/ chopped cilantro to garnish... got a great response from my dinner guests..thanks for a great recipe, SairajB!

This was very good, and it seems to be a forgiving recipe.  I forgot to pick up cilantro and garlic making it, so my charred veggies had to wait a day before being blended together and they still turned out great.  I ended up just subbing minced garlic for the roasted cloves, I'm sure it would be even better if I had roasted the garlic like the recipe called for.  I also added about half a small onion like some reviewers suggested.  And I only had 2 jalapenos so I subbed a hot cherry pepper for the third.  My only complaint is that it really just tasted like spicy cilantro to me.  The tomatillo taste didn't really come through like I had expected.  Next time I will use more tomatillos or a smaller bunch of cilantro.  Thanks for the recipe!   ETA:  I need to change this from 4 to 5 stars.  After it sat in the fridge for a few hours, the strong cilantro taste had faded and the other flavors came through.  After a couple days of the flavors mingling, it was amazing!  It makes for a life-changing good taco topping as well.  My husband said if we had this all the time, he would never need hot sauce, the flavor of the salsa is just so much better.  Next summer I am going to seek out bulk tomatillos so I can make a lot of this and can it.  YUM!!

I saw the tomatillos at the farmers market and knew I needed to find a recipe to have fun with.  I only added 1 jalapeño because it was good sized and that was just the way we like it.  I also added the juice of 1 lime and a pinch of cumin.  It certainly was easy enough, and the family liked it!

Loved the recipe. The only modification I made was adding a bit more jalapenos. I like my salsa spicy!  I used this to add to a green chile I made.  I want to make more to eat with tortilla chips.

Use fresh lime juice instead of water. I've been doing it this way for a few years ever since I got a food processor. The only way to make Tomatillo Salsa.

Very Tasty!! I bought tomatillos at the Farmer's Market anad the farmer told me to roast them.  I found this recipe and followed it to the letter only adding some lemon juice at the end.  It's perfect!  Thank you.

It was a fun and easy recipe for me. I've never cooked tomatillos. I took an advice roasting tomatillos (400 degrees for 20min) then broiled with Garlic & chili. I also added a bit of lime juice. I think it is good with or without lime juice. It was great!! I will definitely try again.

I grilled the tomatillos on the grill along with the jalapeno's. The more cilantro the better! I added a little sugar, cumin and lime juice to kick it up a bit. Yummy!

The roasted flavor was great but this still needed something more when I tasted it. I added in a few squirts of fresh lime juice and a good spoonful of red hot sauce...that was better.

Oh my goodness!! What a great recipe. Only thing I did differently was add some chopped white onion and I didn't need to add any water. I made a jar for my neighbor and she is from Porta Rico and she said, and posted it on her facebook page for all her friends to try, it is the BEST she has ever tasted!!

Wonderful salsa verde! Be warned that 2 jalapeno peppers still makes for a hot salsa.  We like spicy food in our house and I would only use 1 jalapeno next time.  I felt that by using 2 the hotness overpowered the flavour a bit.

This is a pretty good recipe. And my first time roasting tomatillos. I skipped the water (didn't need it) and added just a bit of lime juice. I think next time I make this I'll skip the cilantro (changes the flavor) and either add less jalapenos or take out the seeds prior to roasting. Otherwise yum.

I deseeded the jalapeno's before roasting them to kill the heat some since I knew Grumpy wouldn't be able to handle it!  I had never used tomatillos before but had received them in my weekly field-goods package.  I found this recipe and loved the idea of roasting.  I had super huge garlic cloves and no cilantro to be found in the grocery-so I used the fresh cilantro "paste" in a tube (about a tablespoon).  Turned out really well.  Ate this on steak fajitas on homemade tortillas.  DELISH!

This recipe is a great start but I made a couple of additions for a little more flavor- lime juice and smoked paprika. This is a great way to use up the millions of tomatillos we get from the garden.

I received two tomatillos in my CSA box this week (just two!) so I set out to find a recipe.  I found this one and decided to use most of the other salsa items they gave me; two tomatoes, one jalapeno pepper and one green bell pepper.  I also had some garlic.  So I pared it down and threw one tomato into the blender with the mix, then diced the other and threw it in at the end.  I took another reviewer's advice and added cumin.  This is a great salsa and I'm so happy I got to use so much of my CSA produce this week!

This was very good.  I was surprised by how much the peppers mellowed when roasted.  I have made this recipe twice,  the first time I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I added a pasilla pepper, fresh onions and a squeeze of lime juice-fantastic!

Loved the spiciness to it.  The flavor was excellent and I used the left over salsa to make a green enchilada casserole, which added to the flavor of the casserole immensely.

I made it exactly as stated and thought the cilantro was overpowering. I like the idea of roasting so I will try it with another salsa recipe.

Made as the recipe states, and it was amazing over chicken breast.  Tastes like summer, with just the right amount of heat.  I did not de-seed the jalapenos or tomatillos, just tossed them in the blender after a rough shop, and did not need to add water.

This recipe was fantastic, and it carried with it a nice KICK! I roasted the tomatillos, garlic, jalapeno and also added an onion for about 20 minutes and then I broiled them. Then mixed in the blender and added some slat and lime juice.  This will be good with chips and also enchiladas.

This salsa goes great in chilaquiles. After reading the reviews I roasted the ingredients in a 450 degree oven and then broiled. I too added onion. I also added fresh lime juice. It was very spicy, but that's how we like it!!

Hoo! This is HOT! (But my jalapenos were huge.) Very nice tangy, smoky flavor, and so easy to prepare. Next time I'll add just a bit of onion, and I wouldn't mind a touch more garlic. This is perfect with avocado and goat cheese quesadillas.

I made this with one jalapeno, and I broiled some diced yellow onion along with the other ingredients. I also used Adobo seasoning instead of salt. Turned out great. Thanks!

Delicious flavor (I passed the recipe along to several friends), but INCREDIBLY spicy.    Blending the jalapenos releases more of the capsaicin (the hot stuff), so if you are not going to leave the peppers chunky, you might want to cut down.

I loved this and so did my family.  I used 3 jalapenos as the ones I had weren't particularly hot.  I didn't have any cilantro in the house so I didn't use any and it was still great.  Fantastic flavor.

The (almost)classic recipe.  Some folks have mentioned something missing.  Dice white onion and add after prep.  No need to refrigerate unless you want to tamp down the heat -- fresh salsa always packs more heat.

Easy recipe and very spicy.  The only reason I give it a 4 star is because I think it is lacking a spice or two.

Use Chicken stock instead of water, and make sure you don't "scrape" off the charred parts of the chiles, because the skins of Jalapenos don't need to be removed like other chiles. I don't use the black pepper. Great Salsa Verde!!

I used about 10 tomatillos and 2 jalapenos , as well as a head of garlic cloves.  I didn't use a whole bunch of cilantro, just added 7-8 stems of leaves.  Not the whole stem because I only have an immersion blender stick, and I thought it would take too long to get all the stems chopped.  Two jalapenos was not hot at all, which is fine with me.  I will add another next time I make it though.  Fresh, delicious taste!  I don't know what other reviews meant about cooking the raw taste out of it.  It's fine to me!

This was so much easier to make than pico de gallo or guacamole for that matter. I followed all the directions exactly except I did not add any water. It was delicious. I left all the seeds in from the jalapenos, too, so it was pretty spicy. I might blacken the veggies a little bit more next time to get more of that charred/grilled flavor. I will definitely make it again and use it on more things. I just used it to dip tortilla chips into.

Easy to make and delicious! Mine came out spicy, but any salsa is going to be as hot as your peppers are anyway. For about 1 lb tomatillos, I used 4-5 cloves garlic, 1 jalapeno, and 1 serrano (had 1 that needed to be used up). Out of habit, I also roasted 1 small yellow onion (my Mexican SIL always does this). I did not use 1 full bunch of cilantro and just slowly added as much as I needed by taste. For us, 1 bunch would be too much. I added a little water at a time until I reached the consistency I was looking for. No need to add black pepper in this recipe at all. Salsa was very good, but I felt it was missing something and will squeeze in a little lime. Thanks for the recipe!

The cilantro was way too much and I only used about 1/2 the bunch. I tried adding avocado to dilute the taste but didn't have good results. I wouldn't make it again.

First time to makes any kind of salsa and this was easy to follow and not at all scary! I made just a couple of changes based on my taste. I realized I had bought jalapeños that were getting a little old, so I only used one so it wouldn’t add bitterness. Will definitely add more next time! Then, I like a really tart salsa, so I substituted lime juice for the water and just added a bit as needed. Maybe 2T total. Maybe. I added 1/2tsp of ground cumin to tone it down a notch. If I had used all the jalapeños called for, I might not have used the cumin. The color is to die for and the flavor is excellent!

I followed the recipe using some other reviewer tips:
*roasted the tomatillos (I cut them in 1/2 and laid flat side down)
*sliced the garlic in 1/2
*used one jalapeno and one cherry bomb pepper (took the seeds out)
    **covered those veggies in olive oil and baked them at 375 degrees for about 15 mins and then broiled for two minutes, checked on them, added one more minute, took out the peppers, allowed the tomatillos broil until a nice brown coating (don't take off any peels bc it adds to the flavor)

I then added the rest of the recipe (fresh cilantro from local CSA)

After tasting it I threw in 1 1/2 uncooked regular tomatoes (still greenish from CSA) - that helped with the flavor

My two teenage daughters liked it but my son doesn't eat weird stuff (he prefers raw normal veggies and fruit :) )

I made this as an appetizer for a Jamaican Jerk themed gathering. This salsa was a huge hit. The roasted tomatillo, jalapeno and garlic gave this dish some nice smokiness, while the cilantro kept it very fresh tasting. During the blending, I added a 1/2 tsp of whole allspice berries, which really rounded out the dish.

Oh, My!!!  This is a great recipe!  I added 3 fresh tomatoes from the garden and a generous pinch of oregano, YUM!  My tomatillos got soft before they charred-my fault...I had them further away from heat of broiler as I thought they would char before softening...I'll start with a hot oven and close up broiling next time!  Thanks!

I pretty much followed the recipe with the addition of a TBS of Lime Juice at the end,  I used frozen cilantro from earlier this summer and used 5 halepenos because mine were pretty small.  All I can say is WOW, what a kick, made my tongue stand at attention, but really, really good

Very good but I had to really tinker with the salt.  I wish I measured how much I added total.  I added several more cloves of garlic and a red hot pepper I had on hand.  The red pepper specks made the salsa very beautiful.

I've not much salsa verde before and don't like cilantro, but we grew tomatillos this year  so we tried several recipes.  I liked this roasted salsa recipe the best.  It mellowed the taste of the cilantro and blended the flavors nicely.  My husband who does like cilantro also preferred this recipe to other salsa verdes we tried.  Will definitely make again, (we have lots of tomatillos.

This was so simple and my first time making anything with tomatillos, the only change I made was I also added some serrano peppers to spice things up a bit, otherwise great recipe!!!

This was a great recipe. Due to sensitivity to spicy heat I subbed pasillo peppers for the jalepenos.  I also added juice of 2 limes, & roasted sweet onion- 1 whole onion, probably about a cup & a half cup.

I thought there was too much cilantro, and in the end, something was missing. It was usable, and my husband liked it however. Very easy to make.

I also added lime juice and cut back on the cilantro (I don't really like it, but you can't leave it out or it doesn't taste authentic). I also found I didn't need to add any water. Good stuff!

I didn't seed the peppers so it was a bit hot for me, but all of my guests loved it.

This is easy and so tasty.  Leave the seeds in the jalapenos for more "kick."  Serve over grilled pork tenderloin or just with lots of chips and sliced vegetables.

I normally love the flavor that roasting and charring gives, and love tomatillo salsa, so I was really excited to try this one.  The first time I made it in the oven both roasting and then broiling.  The flavor was good but 2 dimensional.  I added some onion and what I thought was cumin but turned out to be coriander.  OOPS!  The second time I made it I used the cumin, and it was much better, but still not great.  This salsa is really lacking something.  It's almost like the carmelization from roasting ruined it rather than improved it.

This was good but since we don't like it to hot I only used 1 jal. pepper. I also followed others advice and used some white onion.
