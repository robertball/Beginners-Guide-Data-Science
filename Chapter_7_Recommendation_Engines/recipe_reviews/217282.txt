We made with whole wheat flour (all I had) and I think that they would be much better with white flour.  Even still, really good and a lot of fun to make with the fam.

I just made these 20 minutes ago, my oldest says, "these aren't pretzels, but they are still good". They look and taste nothing like a pretzel, but the taste was fantastic! I had a little dough left so I brushed it with a little melted butter mixed with honey after they baked and put cinnamon sugar on them, upon my sons request. They just tried them and they like them also. Great recipe I can see these being requested quite a bit. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!

Excellent family pleaser. Would be great for a get together or football party. Would also be good done with cocktail weiners. Well worth the time and effort put into them.

Yum! My picky boys loved them. I made half the recipe (I only wanted 6 dogs) and had extra dough so I made pretzel bites...these were the real hit. Also, I used turkey dogs which were shockingly good.

It was a nice tasty change for hot dogs, worth the effort. Next time, I will add some more spice to the dough mixture itself, maybe some poppy/sesame seeds. No additional salt is needed to sprinkle on top of the finished product, though, as hot dogs are already salty enough. I ended up with alot of extra dough, but froze it and hope it keeps for my next attempt!

The dough was a little bland, but fine.  I added sesame seeds on dog and made them "mummy turkey dogs".  Note: Do NOT make this with gluten free flour!  I tried 1 batch with the gluten free and it was a mess and disgusting!

Picky kid approved!  I halved the recipe and still ended up with a ton of dough, way more than I needed for 10 hot dogs.  Requires a good bit of effort but the end result was quite tasty.

The recipes was okay but it was for 20 hot dogs. I cut it down to 10 but i fogot that most hot dogs are sold in packs of eight so i had too much pretzel dough for what i had. 

They tasted good even if it was too much pretzel per hot dog. Still needs some fine tuning but work probably better if your making it for a party and need twenty of them at a time for guests instead of a simple meal.

The dough didn't taste like pretzel.  It was edible, but not what I was looking for.  The only change I made was to make a half batch, otherwise followed the directions.  I won't be making this one again.

These are good as is, but I found I needed more hotdogs for the amount of dough.

I have since just made the dough and made ‘hotpockets’ with many different fillings. Ham and cheddar. Mozzarella and pepperoni. I even made a cream cheese filling, froze it in balls and then put it inside. This a a great recipe for kid’s school lunches or picnic food. We love to make them for road trips!

These aren't actually pretzels, to make them more like a soft pretzel I brushed it with an egg wash.  I don't know what the size of a golf ball is where this recipe is from, but it is definitly not enough to make a foot-long  inch and a half strip.

This was really good. I made it with some lamb sausage. I followed the recipe's directions for the dough with the exception that I used half whole wheat flour, parboiled the sausages and wrapped them. I took the extra dough and formed it into pretzels, sprinkling half with kosher salt and half with sesame seeds. Both the pretzel sausages and the pretzels were excellent. Easy five stars and will make again.

Great recipe. One step that makes it easier and just as tasty is to skip the baking soda bath in hot water, and instead combine one egg yoke with a tsp of water. Brush the pretzel dog with this mixture just before baking. Pretty darn easy and very good.

They were alright.  The dough was too thick around the dogs.  Next time I will use half of what the recipes calls for to wrap each hotdog.

This was very easy and tastey!! I halved the recipe and still came out with 8 dogs wrapped and 8 stand alone pretzels. I should have brushed an eggwash on them before baking as the required 20 min baking time wasn't enough to get them golden brown. I ended up baking them for 10 min more. Then brushed melted butter on them and added coarse kosher salt. Excellent and quick! My family loved them.  Will definitely make them again!!!
