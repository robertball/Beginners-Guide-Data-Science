I made this for dinner tonight and it was to die for! I added a can of green chiles to the meat mixture, and put tots on top at the end with the cheese. I broiled it for a few minutes to add a little crunch. We ate it with sour cream and hot sauce. It was sooo yummy. Next time I might add some tortilla chips on top too. What a great find!

This can be adaptable for the slow cooker during the hot weather, when you don't want to heat up the kitchen. Follow steps 1 and 2 exactly. Step 3--grease the cooker and add 1/3 of enchilada sauce to bottom. Step 4--line the cooker (all the way up the sides if possible) with the tater tots. Step 5--spoon the meat/bean/corn mixture in the middle of the tater tot "nest." Step 6--drizzle the remaining enchilada sauce over the meat mixture and any exposed tater tots. Step 7--cook on low for 5-7 hours (or high 3-4 hours). Sprinkle cheese during last hour of cooking. Slow cookers vary in heating, so cook until the tater tots are hot and steamy!

This was just OK for us. As is, neither my hubs or I were all that impressed. With a few tweaks we'd be much more receptive to having this again. The concept is creative and the potential for improvement is there, but the execution is completely wrong, IMHO. Combining the tater tots with everything else was where this went downhill. The tots were mushy and barely noticeable. I suggest layering the tots on TOP of the meat / corn / bean mixture. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over all, cover with cheese and bake as directed. I also do not think it's necessary to use frozen corn (I used canned Fiesta corn but PictSweet brand sells a frozen Southwest blend that would also work and eliminate the need for a separate can of beans). Since beans are only sold in 15 oz. cans at my local grocery store, I added a *tad* more than called for. My final change (per the advice of others) was to add a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies because my hubs and I LOVE spicy food. The usual taco garnishes (i.e. shredded lettuce, tomato, green onion and sour cream) added a little pizzazz to our plates. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Mama Smith. I am looking forward to trying this again - with MY changes! :-)

This recipe was really good! I did a couple things differently...I used ground chicken instead of beef (because thats what I had thawed) I also used regular frozen corn because I couldn't find Mexican Style and I didnt put cheese in the dish because my husband doesn't like cheese. I just sprinkled some on top for me! :) This will definitely be made again, and I will thaw beef out next time to try it that way! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good. I didn't have tater tots so I made the recipe on the stove and topped it with homemade hashbrowns and cheese. I also made the enchilada sauce from the ten minute enchilada sauce recipe on here! I used plain frozen corn and co jack cheese.  Really good.

This recipe is bomb!! I forgot to add the taco seasoning until I was mixing the meat/corn/beans with the tots but it didnt make a difference. I didn't let the meat mix cool either, the frozen tots did that. Also I added chopped green onion & fresh chopped tomatoes to the top right after I pulled it out of the oven for a little zing. Love love love!!

This is one recipe that continues to make an appearance in my kitchen. Definitely a favorite in my family.  So hearty and filling. I use the frozen Santa Fe vegetable mix so I get the corn, black beans and peppers all at once (perhaps that's just me being lazy?). Comes out perfect. I also add a little extra cheese--there's no such thing as too much cheese. :)

This was a great recipe!  My family loved it.   Served it with sour cream.   Only thing I used differently was the lower sodium packet of taco seasoning mix.  Made the recipe just as written and I would not change anything.

I modified this recipe only because allrecipe was down and I had to go from my memory which turned out to be very poor. I forgot the corn and beans all together. I sautéed the onion before browning the beef. I added the enchilda sauce and taco seasoniing to the beef and then in what turned out to be a delicious decision I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and about a cup of sour cream. I pre-cooked the tots in a casserole dish while making the meat sauce. Poured on the meat sauce,very lightly stirred, topped with cheese. Baked only 10 minutes since i pre-cooked the tots. Oh my! This was ridiculously good. I imagine if you followed the recipe it would be equally as good!

I really liked this!  I used ground turkey and put the onion and garlic in while I was browning the turkey.  I also used the red enchilada sauce.  Very good comfort food, my kids even liked it!  Thanks!

Sorry Mama -  I was not at all pleased with the outcome of this recipe.  I was confused as to if I should drain the beef after cooking it and before adding the corn and beans. As I do with all first try recipes, I follow the recipe exactly, so i DID NOT drain it and regretted it.  The casserole was VERY greasy.  I thought the tater tots got completely lost in the recipe.  Meaning after I cooked the casserole I could not see or taste them.

It was good but the tots were a little too moist. I followed the directions for the taco seasoning and added 3/4 cups water. Next time I think I will skip that part.

sorry, but I was not nearly as impressed with the outcome of this recipe as other reviewers. Nothing I can really put my finger on, just didn't "do it" for me. Thought the enchilada sauce gave it a "funny" taste - I did use the green enchilada sauce, as that's what the grocery had; perhaps if I had used red sauce? Regardless, it took almost 45 minutes to "prepare" to then put in the oven for 40 minutes . . . way too long for such a mediocre dish.

Delicious! I used the ten minute enchilada sauce recipe for the enchilada sauce and added extra beans instead of corn only because I hate corn in things. I also grated montery jack and cheddar for the cheese. When putting this together I mixed half of the tater tots into the mixture and put the remaining cheese on top after the sauce and then topped it with the remaining tots so they would be crisp.

My husband, who is not a tater tot fan, absolutely loved this! I added olives to the top of mine and next time I will add a layer of tater tots to the top like some other reviewers did, since those were my kids favorite part of it. I wouldn't think of leaving out the onion or garlic, it had great flavor.

This one was a hit! Added some green pepper, fresh corn, and a little salsa to the mix. Then topped the casserole off with some black olives and tortilla chips. Also I just combined the enchilada sauce in the tater tot mixture instead of pouring it on top. Served it with a dollop of sour cream.

This recipe is so good, and I love how customizable it is. I used a taco seaoning that was pretty spicy, and it was delicious.

This recipe is so easy and family friendly. It fits into our comfort food rotation. I sometimes make it with a can of fiesta nacho cheese soup instead of the enchilada sauce and that is also tasty. I agree with the folks who recommend adding sour cream and adding some zippy hot sauce (at least to my serving). If you have time to sauté some chopped onion that is also a nice addition. 

Still LOL-ing at the person who gave this a bum rating because they were confused as to whether or not to drain the oil from the ground beef (and therefore DIDN'T!)!!! Oh well, I guess we were all newbies to the kitchen at one point. :)

This was not hard to make, I enjoyed the entire process. Great dish with wonderful flavors. I tweaked it just a bit - I pre cooked the tator tots and used about 20 ozs of them (so more than the recipe called for) and I would maybe even use more next time. I used pepper jack cheese for more kick - wonderful!

This was so delicious and easy to make. I added more tater tots than called for and thats the only change I made. If you don't like this then your taste bud challenged. It must have been good the family plowed through it.

This dish is wonderful.  I did make a few changes.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.  And I could not find the frozen Mexican style-corn.  I just used frozen corn and chopped up a red, yellow and green pepper.  It was great.  And used a little more enchilada sauce.

This is good.  Quick and easy to make.  I honestly think the meat mixture w/out the tater tots would be great all by itself wrapped in some tortillas or in some taco shells.

This was delicious.  The only change I made was putting the tots on top instead of mixed in since we like our tots to be super crispy. Just put the frozen tots on top with some of the cheese then baked. Everyone liked it. 3 kids, 4 adults!

My husband rated this a 3, it tasted like chili with tater tots thrown in (which didn't add much in my opinion).  I added a can of green chilis like many other reviewers - and definitely think those were a good addition.  I used red kidney beans instead of black because that's what I had on hand.  Served with chopped red onion & sour cream.

This is a very good recipe! I have two very picky little kids and they eat this every time. I have made this with both red and green enchilada sauce and even once did Christmas style. My personal preference is the red enchilada sauce whereas my husband and children like the green, it has a more mellow flavor and often isn't as spicy. 

Also instead of a pack of taco seasoning (I often find them too salty) I use salt, pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little bit of chili powder.

WOW! YUM!  I didn't have black beans, but had kidney beans on hand.  I also used ground turkey breast and only half the can of sauce.  I then layered tots then meat mix then more tots and some cheese.  This was a hit in my house!

I made this for the staff at school. I used the ten minute enchilada sauce recipe from this site, rather than canned sauce. It was so easy to prepare and full of many Mexican flavors. It smells scrumptious...Now I have to go back to the store - I'm making it for our dinner as well! Thanks, Mama Smith! =)

This is like a taste explosion in your mouth!  So many yummy tastes and textures...  I used a can of regular corn and a can of olives, but everything else was per the recipe.  When you bite into the tater tots, the feeling is indescribable!  Both of my kids loved it too.

It truly was easy to prepare. I did bake my tater tots first and followed the recipe. I will make this again!

Great and easy dish! I did add a little water to the beef along with the seasoning. I choose to rid of the corn and beans but wished I had added it at the end. Regardless, it was delicious and will make for a nice snack later, even! Thanks!

I didn't care for the flavors; specifically the enchilada sauce mixed with tater tots. I tried this recipe because of the high ratings but it just was not for me.

This is delicious! I made some adjustments to mine - I baked the tater tots at 420 degrees for 20 minutes while I made the beef mixture. I used canned corn and added green chilis, red beans and a can of diced tomatoes. after the tots are baked, I poured half the red enchilada sauce over the them then spread a can of refried beans over the tots. I then spooned the beef/vegetable mixture over this to reduce some of the moisture, poured the remaining enchilada sauce over that, topped with cheese and baked for 20 minutes! absolutely delish.

My family like this meal! Used Mexican corn that already had black beans and peppers. Added more cheese just cause we love it. very easy to make after a long day at work.

Cooked tater tots separate then layered in bowl with cheese and sour cream. This mixture would make a great dip! Also mixed all main ingredients up and stored in fridge until ready to cook. So easy but outstandingly delicious!

As a very amateur cook, I use the recipes on this site as starting points to get better, and this is my first review. I am positive this recipe is totally awesome as is, but here are my tweaks for anyone interested: I didn't have Mexican corn, but I did have a 1/2 bag of frozen regular corn and a 1/2 jar of salsa...hello, mix the two! I also had a 1/2 bag of Mexican blend cheese so that went into the beef/tater, etc. mix. I also threw in a small can of sliced olives, a couple fork fulls of roasted red peppers, and a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I was lazy and used a tablespoon of minced garlic from a jar and "my" measurement of minced onion. Lastly I had a 1/2 bag of tostitos chips, so crushed them up and topped off the whole dish with them and another bag of Monterey jack cheese. It came out awesome with those mods and following the rest of the recipe to a T. KIM this was only for me, I like hot, spicy, and cheesy because that's what I am.

Made this for dinner tonight and hubby said it was a keeper.  I did add a fresh jalapeño and cilantro and layered the tots on top with cheese on top.  I served it with fresh avocado and sour cream and a sprinkle of cilantro.  Went back for more. Lol

I have to say I enjoyed this made with tator tots more than with flour shells or the manicotti I have used before. Good  flavor , maybe a bit more taco sauce over the top after the enchilada sauce and also I will add a can of diced tomatoes with juice to the meat mixture next time I make this. I topped it off with sour cream and some crunched up nacho chips. Avocado, lettuce etc.....  would be a great addition also.

Yum! My family loves this recipe!  I've only made it using a can of Fiesta corn (Mexican corn).  I find the recipe needs more than 12 oz of enchilada sauce though.

I made all kinds of changes, using what I had on hand and this casserole was still delicious! First of all, I doubled the meat and cheese, used 1 can of regular corn and 1 can of pinto beans (drained), plus a can of Rotel and an undiluted can of cream of chicken soup. Didn't have Mexican cheese, so used cheddar. Also added about a cup of sliced black olives, which I put on top before the first baking and before the final 1/3 of the cheese. I didn't have any enchilada sauce, but it wasn't missed and there was still plenty of liquid. Everyone loved it, and I fixed a pan of cornbread to go alongside. You can't mess this one up!

This was a great spin on the tater tot casserole.  It is very adaptable to what you have on hand.  I made it pretty much as stated, but put half the tater tots in the casserole, and half on top, then topped with cheese.  I also used a larger can of enchilada sauce.  Next time, I will add green chilies and try it with pinto beans. It was very yummy and I will definitely make it again.

This was yummy! I used the 10 minute enchilada recipe from this site because I didn't have any.  I added garlic bc I add garlic to everything. That was I all that I changed. My husband is really picky and he loved this recipe. Thank you very much. Oh, I put potato crowns on the top as well.

Hubby loved this one. I put the tots on the top so they were crispy. Added the cheese on top of them in the last 5 minutes. I used the enchilada sauce for the 10 minute enchilada sauce recipe on this site.

It was super easy to make and pretty good. I wasn't crazy about it but it's a good quick meal. My Mexican corn had black beans in it so I did not add a can of black beans. I used dried onion and garlic powder instead of fresh.

I used the big can of enchilada sauce because we love it and I also browned the meat with the onion and the garlic.  We used pinto beans because we prefer them.  Everything was delicious!  Also, if you happen to be near a Target store, check out their Archer Farms brand Southwest seasoning!  It's got a great chipotle flavor that made this a little more special!

Yum!  I did use picante sauce instead of enchilada sauce because that's what I had on hand.   I added a small can of green chiles. Instead if mixing the tater tots in there I put a layer of tots then the meat mixture. Then remaining tots in top. Good stuff!  Not your old fashioned tater tot recipe!!

Found this recipe while looking for something to use my leftover taco meat.  This was great, I did not have enchilada sauce or black beans so I substituted a can of rotel and a can of ranch style beans.  I also used a can of regular corn and added extra tater tots on top. We ate with sour cream and salsa.  Everyone was a little skeptical about eating a tater tot Mexican casserole but they all loved it. My husband and teen daughters went back for seconds.  Great recipe that can be adapted to whatever you have on hand.  I will be making this again!!

i tried this recipe a couple weeks ago, and my hubby and i just loved it. i made it with shrimp instead of beef because we're pesci-tarians, and i ended up omitting the enchilada sauce all together, but it was still SUPER tasty!! thanks so much for this recipe - it's a keeper!

I thought this recipe was very easy to make, but my husband and toddlers weren't fans of the tater tots.  I think it was a little soggy rather than the typical crispy tater tot.  The flavor was good, but not a favorite for my family.

Deeeeelicious! Easy to make and seriously good comfort food. I did use canned corn since that's all I had and skipped the black beans because I don't like them. Definitely a keeper.

I  just fixed this for super. It was a hit!!!  I did do some variations also. I added a can of green chiles and also put the tater tots on top for crunch. I did everything else like the recipe said. My husband said it was keeper!!!

Made this for the first time after waiting three days for my oven to be fixed finally! SO GOOD! the only thing I forgot was the corn but I bet it would make it even better. And I will add, That because I like sauce, I will be using more enchilada sauce next time I make it. :) LOVE!

This recipe is definitely a hit. I know some people might turn their noses up at tater tot casserole but seriously it should be tried at least once. I made this a few months ago, added some green chiles as others did and wow was it good. I think I will make it again this week with ground chicken or turkey to change it up a little bit. Being from Texas I love the Mexican flavors that were added to it, makes it so much better. Great recipe, thanks!

This was super yummy!!  For those that rated this "blah", you must have missed something.  Instead of beef, I used ground turkey with a little olive oil.  After it was sauteed, I added the corn (just basic frozen corn kernels), a can of diced green chilies and the beans (seasoned, drained the liquid but did not rinse) along with the rest of the ingredients including GREEN enchilada sauce.  Husband and I are on a pretty strict diet and try to do one "small cheat day" a week.  This was the perfect "cheat"!  Tasty, colorful and definitely a keeper.  I believe making it with turkey is probably better for you with little to no grease/fat.  Common sense is to drain the fat anyway.  Give this a try and thanks for posting!

A nice twist on the traditional tater tot casserole! I used the Taco Seasoning I on this site and my homemade red enchilada sauce, along with Crispy Crowns. I layered everything:  pre-baked tots, a few ladles of enchilada sauce, shredded cheddar, meat/bean/corn/cheese mixture, and a final layering of sauce, then cheese. I subbed my mother-in-law's pinto beans (as they're just far better than canned black beans!) and only 1 cup of frozen corn. I liked mine with sour cream and crushed Doritos on top. Hubby loaded his with  homemade HOT salsa, but 4 year-old DD wasn't too impressed. Easy, filling comfort food especially on a cold, snowy night.

Muy excelente! I followed the recipe exactly as written with 3 small exceptions: 1) I couldn't find Mexican-style corn at the grocery so I used regular 2) I added a couple of seeded, diced Jalapeno's for a little added zing and 3) I assembled it a little differently. Instead of mixing everything together as it calls for in step 3 I added the enchilada sauce in step 2, poured the entire mixture when heated into a baking dish and then topped it with the cheese and finally the tater tots which I topped with a little taco sauce.

I strongly suggest serving with a little sour cream as well. Takes it right off the charts!

"It's on the hit list!"~hubby
"Yummy!"~kids
Try this.  Really.  I didn't have any black beans, so I used pinto.  Used regular frozen corn because my store doesn't have mexican.  I also had mini tater tots instead of regular, but I think they worked out better because you didn't end up getting a big bite of potato.  It made quite a bit and was a breeze to whip together.  Fed 2 adults, teenage boy and 2 younger girls with enough leftovers for lunch the next day (even though everyone really liked it).  Reheated very nicely also.  Thanks Mama for a great family recipe!

Really good.  I used half grnd beef/half grnd turkey, reduced-sodium taco mix, regular corn & cheddar/jack cheeses.  I used Ore-Ida's Crispy Crowns for the taters.  Recipe came out GREAT. Husband loved it too!

I've had Tater Tot Casserole before and didn't like it, but this was GOOD!  Ended up using can corn (error in purchase) and cheddar cheese.  Still worked out ok.  Really enjoyed.

Easy to make and bake. Of course the tots cant be crispy but this is very yummy and you get all the flavors. The corn helps balance the heat really well. Definitely a winner for me!

It was awesome. We added some white queso cheese mixed with a can of rotel tomatoes with green chilis. After baking the tots, we covered them with the taco meat, the queso and rotel sauce and then completed it with fresh chopped cilantro. It was superb and will definitely make it again! The family loved it.

As a fan of Tater Tot Casseroles I have made many different versions.  This one by far has now trumped all the other versions I have made.  My entire family gave a thumbs up and went back for more.  I did not change a thing in this recipe.

Fun new way to have Mexican. Corn adds some crunch and sweetness. Added a can of chiles to the corn instead of using mexican corn.

I made this tonight and my kids and grandkids lived it. I did layer the tater tots on top like I do with a different version of this dish, and I put it on broil for a few minutes at the end to crisp them up. I also used a bigger can of enchilada sauce after reading reviews.  This is easy and soooo good!!!

This was very easy to make and I even made a vegan one for myself at the same time!  Instead of mixing up the meat mixture with the tater tots I layered it so that I could add more meat and tater tots because my kids are teenagers and eat a lot!! I also added a layer of spinach so I didn’t have to make a separate vegetable dish.

How Boy, this was good!!! Brown onion, burger, add garlic, then stir in rest.  I didn’t have much taco seasoning so added chipotle chili powder, cumin, granulated garlic, coriander, and a little oregano.  Use cojita cheese - stir some in mixture, top with tots, bake, then sprinkle with a little more cheese.  My family loved it!!

Out of this world. I used Crispy Crowns instead of ToTs and no onions.  Added a small can of diced jalapeños and ate it with tortillas chips. Wife loved it.

This was a very good casserole. The only change I made was to put a few tater tots on the top of it to crisp up.  I also used a little extra cheese on top .

I will definitely make this again. I added a can of mushroom soup and a can of diced chiles. I used a 28oz bag of tater tots and saved about 1/3 of them and put on top. I covered them with shredded cheese and drizzled some enchilada sauce over them as well.

Very simple to make! Love taco anything, so this is right up our alley. I did add sliced black olives because my daughter loves them, and I used shoepeg corn because I didn’t have the Mexican style corn. Very tasty.

I made this for our family as a test run for preparing a meal for a family in need.  Our family loved it, and the other family said they did, too.   I ended up testing the two methods of mixing the tator tots in vs putting them on top, and we really couldn't tell much of a difference.  I ended up making it for the other family (and our family again!) using the tator-tot-on-top method, just because it's easier.  I could not find Mexican corn, so I just used regular corn, and added a small amount of green chilies.  Very yummy, all of our family except the picky youngest loved it, and are looking forward to having it again tomorrow (as I make it again for a different family in need).  Thank you!

Be careful if you’re adding all the ingredients to the shopping list on the app. For this one, it didn’t give me the right ingredients or the right amounts! I joined the people who put the tots on top of the meat mixture, which was a good call. Overall, fairly tasty but needs sour cream on top.

Yum! Made it per recipe with a minor change.  I could not find frozen Mexican-style corn at the store I was shopping so I used 11oz of canned instead. I also used candied onions as this is what I had on hand. My family loved it & requested I save the recipe.

My 3 kids loved this! I added VERY finely chopped white mushrooms, spinach and extra onion, as well as green onion on the top....always trying to sneak in extra veggies! :) I also used a large can of sauce so it was pretty saucy, but delicious. I made it two days ahead of time so the tater tos fell apart but it was still really delicious!

This is a great receipe and no I'm not going to be like others and change it cause it's good, but maybe just the layering part would be better if you poured the mixture in the baking dish then top with the tots, drizzle sauce on top, then the cheese, this way you don't lose the tots so much when mixed in.  I tried it that way and my gang preferred it, but again All the ingredients remained the same!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This turned out very well and tasted even better as left overs. I substituted with ground turkey. I spiced it up with ground red pepper and  cayenne pepper. I used a can of green chili as recommended by another reviewer.

I used french fries with mine because I didn't have tater tots.  It was good!  We really liked it.  It was a simple dish that I made in my cast iron dutch oven.  The family loved it.

I made a vegetarian version by swapping vegetarian crumbles for the beef. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and black beans. I didn't put cheese in it so my vegan daughter could eat some but I did cheese up the top for most of it. It was amazing and super simple!

I prepared it exactly as directed.,and it was too bland for my family's taste. The tater tots get lost in the other ingredients which gives it a mush texture.

Our family loves this recipe as is. I also have made this substituting baked tilapia fillets in place of the browned ground beef, also earning high praise from the family. You'll be sure to enjoy, making it either way!

Very tasty. I doubled the recipe and frozen one. Two weeks later I got it out of t by e freezer and it was actually better than the fresh one because the flavors all melded together.

This recipe is quick and easy, and really yummy! I accidentally put all of the cheese in the casserole instead of reserving some to sprinkle over the top, but it was still superb. Will make again!

Good starter or quick meal. I made some changes. I make my own taco seasoning and homemade enchilada sauce. I omitted the beans. Into the meat, corn etc mix I added a can of Ro*tel tomatoes. I put the enchilada sauce in the bottom of my13x9. put the tater tots on top of the sauce, then added meat mix over the tater tots. Add cheese as recipe states about 5-8 mins of cooking. Comes out fantastic.

My family loved it! I did not give it a 5 star rating because I made some adjustments. It was a few days ago and I can't remember exactly what I did. Overall it was rated as a keeper in my house.

Turned out great! Added sliced mushrooms as a modification. Quick Tip: Added onion and minced garlic in food processor til almost a paste. This way those who don't like onion/garlic will still eat it, cuz it's hidden, while not sacrificing these essential flavonoids to the dish! ^.^

I love this dinner! It's a great dinner for my family that meets the gluten-free requirement, and it's enough for leftovers. I can make it extra spicy, or milder for a potluck contribution (where it disappears quickly). 

I've also used ground turkey in place of the ground beef, and it's just as tasty.

SOoOo Good! I didn’t have black beans, so I chopped up some black olives and dropped those in. I also put in a dollop of sour cream in the meat mixture. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

No changes to original, except adding some extra sharp shredded cheese on top, for last 5 minutes.
I will use more tater tots to cover just the top, but still stir a few in mix.
We enjoyed it, even left-overs are good.

It turned out amazing. I used a green enchilada sauce for one and red for the other. Also I added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of green chili’s as we couldn’t find any Mexican corn.

Quick and easy.  I added black olives and used more cheese and tater tots than the recipe calls for.  Kids loved it!

Only change I made was to bake the tots first then press them into the bottom of the dish to make a crust. They stayed crunchier that way

This was absolutely amazing. My family ate the whole entire pan! Only thing I did different was that I left whole onions, the corn, and beans out due to my husband not liking vegetables. This is definitely a keeper!!!!

My family really liked this.  I chose it because it contained ingredients I already had in the house.   (I didn't have corn, so I used a can of hominy, and I think that was a really good choice.  I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef.)   The completed dish needed just a touch of something more, and I like one reviewer's suggestion to add chopped green chiles before baking, and sour cream for serving.  I'm going to add those the next time I make it.

No changes on ingredients. I changed the execution (but don't think it made any difference on taste/texture).  It's really good, I'm glad I made it. I will probably make it again. It's a big pile of tex-mex flavor with potatoes and cheese, who doesn't love that! It's also a big pile of mush where all the flavor blends together. I give it 4 stars because it needs more texture, but I haven't figured out what to make it better. But I did put fresh cut crisp jalapenos on top, and those were amazing!

This dish is super yummy! Definitely took the recommendations previously made: added green chilies, layered the tots on top. I also added minced jalapeño and cilantro. Needs a little more heat and some more salt. This is perfect meal for kids and I think it would make great party food. This recipe is a keeper.

I loved this. It was a hit. My husband said it needed only some taco shells, but was O.K. without them. Served it with sour cream. next time I make it I will 1/2 the recipie as there was too much for just us two. Good leftovers though.

Definitely enjoyed this recipe.  Very tasty and very filling.  Used the green chile enchilada sauce for a little more flavor.  Next time I'll add some chorizo and go less on the tater tots.

Very filling, and completely able to optimize the heat with hot enchilada sauce and taco seasoning. I make the mild version for pot lucks and the hot version for when I make it for myself.
I wouldn't recommend changing anything, the recipe is great. I myself add more taco shredded cheese, but then again I need to go on a diet.

Turned out great!  We mixed the sauce with the meat and put the tots on top. Served with a dollop of sour cream, black olives and taco sauce. Can’t wait to make it again!

Super easy, tasty and filling. The only substitutions I used were ground turkey and canned fiesta corn.

This was really yummy. My entire family loved it. I mixed 1/2 of the tater tots with the cheese and layer the rest on top to give it extra crunch. Thanks for a fun new recipe!

This tasted ok, but sort of mushy. More like a dip then a dinner. Easy to make, but not sure i would make it again.

I really liked this idea. 4 stars because it taste so much better when you season the meat yourself instead of those packets(Cumin, chili powder, season salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder). Also docked a star because the tater tots would turn mushy if mixed with meat, they belong on top. I also put the whole can sauce and bag of cheese with meat mixture. Then about another half bag cheese on top of tots at the end, granted that made it a touch greasy on top.

My husband and I really liked this, sadly my kids didn't. They rarely like anything new. I'll still make this again as I really enjoyed it and hopefully my kids will eventually too. For a little extra kick I suggest having some siracha, salsa and sour cream as optional toppings.

I'm sorry to say this was just okay. I really wanted to like it.  Despite draining the meat, it was still very greasy. The taco flavor was just too much.  Tried topping with sour cream and black olives but wasn't enough to salvage. Won't be making again.

Good dish to bring to a potluck. My wife is a big fan of tater tot casserole, so I found this recipe to please her. She liked it much better than other tater tot casseroles.

This is a great recipe!  I used regular corn because I could not find the Mexican style.  I also pre-baked the tots  for around 15 minutes to be sure they would have a little crunch to them. So easy and a big hit.   A little sour cream on top once it was dished out  was perfect.

This recipe was AMAZING! Very tasty, I will definitely make this recipe again. I did make a few changes though, I wanted to make it a bit healthier. So, I used chicken, onion, taco seasoning mix, frozen corn, black beans, cheese, potatoes, and green enchilada sauce. I mostly changed the beef to chicken, the tater tots to potatoes, red enchilada sauce to green enchilada sauce, and no adding garlic.

I loved this and will definitely make it again. I followed the ingredients with the addition of 4oz of green chiles. I did not follow the assembly instructions based off my past experiences with tater tot casseroles. I mixed all ingredients together except the tots, and put that in the baking dish. I then put a layer of tots over the whole thing and a drizzle of enchilada sauce over the tots. Then I put a sprinkling of shredded cheese over the whole thing. Was very good.

We LOVE this recipe. I like to add the onions when cooking the meat so the onions get soft. I also substitute diced red bell peppers instead of corn as hubby doesn't like corn. I also sautee the bell peppers a bit before mixing in the other ingredients to soften. Great recipe!!

I have made this several times now and turns out great each time. I use the mini tater tots and make the 10 minute enchilada sauce from this site as well as the taco seasoning. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was a huge hit for my extended family! I did use ground turkey instead of ground beef and it was very tasty!
I don't like canned enchilada sauce as it tastes metallic.  Use the pouch or jarred version instead.

This is a simple and tasty item. Quick easy and full of flavour , the tators add a nice texture too. It even re-heats really well the next day. I made it exactly as shown and may add some fresh cilantro and a bit of lemon/lime flavour  next time.  Also I’d like to try it with roasted chicken in place of the ground beef. Just for a twist.

Pretty darn good! Very easy. Tweaked it by adding a cup of 1/2 cup green chili, half a pound of chorizo, sliced olives. Then garnished with some chopped lettuce, diced tomato, and sour cream only because it looked like it needed some color on top.

I made this tonight for the first time and used the suggestion of putting the tots on top instead of mixing them in with the meat/corn/beans. It turned out great!! The only thing we added to it was sour cream. Love this recipe!!

This is a great recipe. I did make some slight changes. instead of mixing in the Mexican corn and black beans I layered them on top of the meat mixture. I also slightly deep fried the tater tots and placed some on the bottom of the dish. I added the tater tots on top with lots of three blend cheese. It was so good.

I absolutely loved this casserole, but my husband who is sensitive to spices, thought it was too much. If I make this again, I will not use the enchilada sauce and just use the taco seasoning. I may try topping it with picante sauce so it doesn't get too dry during baking.

I could only fin 32oz package of tots, that seem to work just fine.  This was a quick and tasty meal and I took some into work for breakfast the next day.

I almost skipped over this recipe because I was unsure of the tater tots but so glad I took a chance on it. This recipe was so easy to make and my husband loved it. I took some over to my parents and they loved it too!

I made this for a pot luck dinner.  Everyone liked it and 4 people wanted the  recipe.  I did make a few changes:  I used diced hash brown frozen potatoes, and 2 11 oz frozen seasoned corn by Green Giant Steamers (couldn't find Mexican corn), added 1 medium jalapeno pepper & 2 small sweet peppers, seeded and chopped with the onions; used a 10 oz can of red mild enchilada sauce plus a 7 3/4 oz  Mexican hot tomato sauce.  
It makes a big casserole,  had a bit left over.  My daughter tried it and wanted the recipe.  It is definitely a winner and will become a  regular at my house.

Im giving 4 stars on taste despite the absolutely idiotic  recipe...
"Mix 3/4 of cheese and tater tots with beef mixture" do you mean 3/4 of cheese and 3/4 of tater tots. Or do u just mean tots and 3/4 of cheese bcuz thats is how i read it. Then i see pour rest of sauce of tot layer.. when did we create a tot layer? Is that the last fourth or the whole amount?? And seriously when was this made? Anyways i mixed it all and its fine..
Also where do you live where any of these measurements are even avail? Tots dont come in that size... cheese doesnt.. enchilada sauce doesnt... i mean i searched but i just compromised at the end of it.. why not just say cups since your measurements are not a real thing to be found...
Silly to be frustrated over that but it is what it is..
Anywayd it still taste great. Family loves it. I remove the repulsive onions and its fab

My family and I didn't care for this  much.  The tater tots do get mushy if added as told within the directions but I would suggested layering on top of your meat meat  mixture however that wasn't the main problem with this.  The enchilada sauce was WAY overpowering.  Honestly, its all I could taste so I am about to try this recipe again with some changes but my review is based specifically on this recipe made exactly as written.

Assembled this the day before, covered with foil and placed it in the refrigerator.  (Hubby asked to take me out for dinner - what's a girl to do?)!!!  When I got home from work the next day, popped it in the preheated oven and baked according to directions.  So yummy!!! Just topped with a little sour cream!  Will definitely be making this again since you can do the prep ahead of time!!!

Made this & everyone seemed to enjoy. I would lessen the tater tots as they take over the dish. Taste was spot on & flavors. Versatile recipe that can be adjusted to anyone's tastes. Happy with it overall as is.

I've made this recipe a few times. I like to double it because I have older boys who eat a lot.  This time I did not have the frozen Mexican corn so I used 3 cups of frozen mixed vegetables, hesitating because I wasn't sure if carrots and green beans would be good in it.   It actually tasted just fine!  You can't go wrong with taco flavoring and enchilada sauce with Tater tots!  So easy to make my 21 year old son finished making it so I could get to my own dinner date with the hubby!

I hate changing the recipe and then reviewing it but I loved the idea of this and changed it to my tastes. I found the onion and garlic did nothing for taste, got lost. Next time I will omit as more work. I used the packet of taco seasoning and I used 1 whole jar of Tostitos hot salsa in addition to other ingredients listed like corn and beans. NO enchilada sauce.  I layered like so....meat mixture on bottom, tater tots next and cheese on top. I served with Tostitos and sour cream. Perfect!

I used green enchilada sauce .  Noticed reviews that said the tots got mushy so I did the recipe as written but held back the tots and after everything else was in the pan I arranged the tots on top.  This worked well.

It was good but not quite enough flavor.  It needs either the green chiles that others mentioned, or another half packet of taco seasoning.  All those beans and corn need to be seasoned too.

Served it topped with sour cream, chopped tomatoes,  green onions, and avocado.

Does not warrant the 5 star reviews. Kind of ordinary. Needs something to spice it up. Several people suggested green chiles - that would improve it. Perhaps adding some real Mexican spices instead of the "Taco" flavoring packet. The tater-tots come out all mushy - not crispy like they are if you bake them as usual.

We really liked this dish. Next time will use more hamburger and try it with hash browns. I also used salsa instead of enchilada sauce.

I made a double batch for my teens, who have hollow leg syndrome. All I did different was stir n' coat the tots with the enchilada sauce instead of pouring the sauce over the top. It turned out perfect and the left-over's sustained them between meals for 3 days! They were happy. I was relieved. Great recipe!  I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty good!  Subbed a diced tomato for the corn (but mixed in right before baking, not sauteed in with the onion) and added 2 jalapenos and a cayenne pepper with the onions to give it just a touch of heat.  Will likely make again.  Might try a layer of refried beans next time.

I used ground Turkey and a homemade taco seasoning due to food allergies.  Not a fan of black beans, but they complement this recipe.  I browned the tater tots also on 450 for 10 minutes also to give it some crunch and then broiled it at the end for some cheese crunch.

This is my go to casserole.  My hubby doesn't like casseroles or tator tots, but he loves this! A definite keeper. I tweak it according to what I have on hand and to our tastes. It doesn't change how good it is, in fact I would suggest it.  You must try this recipe!

To reduce the amount of time it cooked in the oven, I heated up salsa (used this instead of enchilada sauce) corn and black beans with the meat and cheese mix before putting it in the 9x13 pan. I placed the tater tots on top, added more cheese and baked it for 25 min, until the tater tots were crispy.

This was fantastic!  Due to package sizes I made a few modifications.  I used 1.5lbs of ground beef, a medium onion, 2 10 oz packages of southwestern corn, 2 10 oz cans of medium red enchilada sauce, a 14.5 oz can of black beans, and a 32 oz bag of tater tots. Oh and almost 2 cups of mexican cheese.  Served it with salsa and sour cream.  Definitely a keeper!

I'd say it was ok and needs improvement. Tasted like it was missing something and had no pizazz. I followed recipe, even tried to bake a little longer to crisp up the tater tots. I've been trying all new recipes every day for about a month and this one I won't be sharing with family or saving for myself.

I used salsa instead of enchilada sauce, no garlic, combo ground  beef and pork (cheaper), chili seasoning instead of taco seasoning, I added broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms and yellow peppers and cut up canned mini corn spears as we had no frozen kernels. Lastly I added shredded cheese into the mix, on the taters as well as on top.  And used salsa because I had no enchilada sauce.

We r not a big casserole family but I like the concept. Still searching for something with a more distinctive flavor. I did like the convenience of this recipe. I also made a tofu version which turned out well but same thing, not amazing. I probably won't make this again.

I made this for myself and my three roommates. Being four college boys, we usually don't have a problem putting away large quantities of food. There's about 1/3 of the casserole left over, but I'm thinking that will be GONE tomorrow. They loved it! With the changes, it had just enough spicy kick and really stuck to the bones to provide a filling meal. 

Changes:
Hot & Spicy Taco seasoning for a little extra kick.
DON'T MIX THE TATER TOTS WITH THE BEEF MIXTURE!
Save the tater tots to put on top.

Really good dish. Pretty quick to put together. My kids ask for it frequently. As I do most recipes, I  change it a little according to what I have available. I find that skipping the mixing of tots and just layering everything is faster and comes out basically the same. Definitely a thumbs up.

We all loved this great take on shepherd's pie. Great taste combination that was easy to make.

While I love the basic recipe, I also tried the recipe holding the tater tots aside. Started with a layer of enchilada sauce, half of the meat and beans mixture, and splitting the enchilada sauce, cheese, and tater tots. Then another layer of meat and beans, enchilada sauce, tater tots, and the last third of cheese. 

While the tater tots in the middle still melted into the meat mixture, the ones one top had a little more texture.

Very easy and really yummy. I did not have tater tots, so I used frozen cubed hash browns and it worked out great. I also added some crushed tortilla chips to the cheese added at the end. Also had enough leftovers for another meal, always a bonus!

This recipe surprised me. I don't normally make things like this but I thought that my husband might like it. It turned out to be very tasty! I added some sliced black olives and topped it with a little sour cream.

Six people ate almost the entire 9x13 pan.  Ridiculously delicious, and so easy to make.  I made it ahead time, refrigerated it, and then took it out to bake.  I did use two more cups of tots, and next time I will use entire 32 ounce package.  I used Las Palmas green enchilada sauce. People were wanting the tater tots.  I used little extra enchilada sauce because of the extra tots.  A real crowd pleaser, and I will make it again.

This was easy to prepare, and came out pretty good. I think it would have been better without the corn. I substituted Morningstar veggie crumbles instead of the meat (:

Eveyone in my family loved this.  It was a little dry but I didn't get to eat it straight from the oven.  It was very tasty.  I might try to add a can of petite tomatoes.

This was better than anticipated. I kept the tots for a top layer with the cheese underneath so they would brown. I also used home made New Mexico style Green Chile, more of a gravy, instead of enchilada sauce.

I made this meal this evening & it was ok. I used ground turkey instead of beef, didn't use the corn or black beans since my family doesn't eat either. I also used Pict Sweet seasoning blend & sauteed it before cooking my meat. I think the biggest issue was adding the enchilada sauce on top of the mix made it kind of soggy. Next time I make it, I won't add the tops with the meat mix & will top add them at the end. Other than it being somewhat soggy there was no complaints. I may also add some green chiles or jalapenos to give it some more color & a little kick.

This was delish! I put the onion in with the ground beef to brown it then drained the fat before adding the rest of the ingredients, and I don't know if it made a difference, but I got 'extra crispy' tater tots. Leftovers tasted even better the next day. Also, put sour cream on top when you serve it...you won't be sorry!

Did this one in the slow cooker because it's too hot outside right now. I only used 2/3 of the taco seasoning. I used regular corn and shreaded cheeze. I added 4 oz of whipped cream cheese, 4 oz of green chilies, and salsa. I browned the meat with onion and garlic, added the chilies and whipped cream cheese, corn, and a can of kidney beans (don't care for black beans). Greased the slow cooker, covered the bottom with 1/2 of the enchalada sauce, dumped in the tater tots, dumped in the meat mixture, put the remaining enchalada sauce on top with about a cup of Pace picanta sauce (you could probably use any kind of salsa but this is what I had on hand). I let it cook on high for 3 hours but think it could have been done in 2 hours. Then I added shredded cheese on top and let it cook for 1 more hour. Then I sprinkled sliced black olives on top with a little freash cilantro. We topped it with sour cream. Perfection! Family LOVED it!

We (okay, I) really enjoy a good casserole and this recipe looked interesting.  The only tweaking I did was to trade pinto beans for the black beans (we're not fans).  That was a good call.  Talk about YUM!  When you want 'comfort food' this is the kind of thing you want.  The family loved it so much that it has now been added to my repertoire.

My mother who hates stuff like tacos, burritos, etc. LOVED this and demanded the recipe from me. It was delicious! I didn't use as much of the beans or corn, I used about half and it was awesome. Highly recommend.

Excellent!  I added canned corn, green chilies, and diced tomatoes to mine.  The taco seasoning mixed well with the enchilada sauce and it was not too moist when it was done. I layered the tater tots on top and browned them, which worked well for texture.   I will definitely be adding this to my recipes!

Other than using regular frozen corn, rather than Mexican, I followed the directions exactly.  Both grandkids loved it, even our adorable, but picky eater, granddaughter, gave it a thumbs up and said it was a 'make again' recipe!

This was good, but not amazing. I think I only used half the cheese it called for by mistake. That may have made a difference. It seemed like the ratio of tater tots to everything else was too much.

This is a keeper.  Very easy and full of taste.  I added some sour cream on top after it was cooked and plated.  Cooked all the ingredients ahead of time, put it in the fridge and added the tater tots when it was time to bake it. Came out great

We enjoyed this  tex-mex casserole.  Before I try most  new recipes,  I read the comments and suggestions of others.  I used canned Mexicorn with jalepenos, drained.  Used only 1/2 cup of the sauce on the bottom of the baking dish.  I poured the remaining sauce over the tater tots, and put them in a single layer on top of the meat and cheese mixture.

I rate this overall 3.5 stars(rounded up to 4).  I have heard a lot about tater tot casseroles, so decided to try this one out.  It was pretty good, but nothing that stood out enough for me to want to make it again.  It isn't something that you would want to serve to company, but good for a family night dinner.  I went pretty much exactly by the recipe with a little tweaks here and there, and made my own enchilada sauce.  The flavor was good and the tater tots somewhat get very soft and taste similar to hashbrowns once done cooking.  So I think if you don't have tater tots, to use frozen hash brown would work the same way in this.  We ate it garnished with sour cream, salsa, and green onions.  This recipe makes a lot!  And is also very filling, that it gave us 2.5 dinners worth for the two of us.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it but assembled it differently. Mixed all the ingredients, plus a can of sliced olives, except tater tots and cheese.  Spread meat mix in pan and topped with some cheese than tater tots. Baked till bubbly than topped with rest of cheese put back in oven till melted and bubbly.

I added a few things to it (more garlic, seasoning, bell pepper, green chilies, jalapeños, etc), and this turned out really good.  My hubby loves tater tot casseroles.  Me... Not so much.   I needed to find something other than the usual recipe so I wasn't disappointed before I even finished cooking it.   I think as is, it would have been a bit too plain, but it's a very good base to go off of.  2 thumbs up from the boys in my household!

I made this the other day as directed, without the corn (I thought I had some when I started making it, but found I was out).  It was OK, but not sure I will make it again.  It just did not WOW me like I thought it would.

I made this as soon as I got the recipe.  The family liked it so much they requested it the following weekend.  I could not find frozen Mexican-style corn so I had to use mexican-style corn from a can, put two in as one was not enough.  I have passed this around in the office to my friends it was so loved by my family.

I made it vegetarian and it was terrific and full of flavor.  My changes to the dish were as follows:  I left out the garlic and onion (did not find either necessary), I used HOT enchilada sauce, frozen southwestern vegetables,  1 package of Morning Star farms vegetarian hamburger crumbles, 1 small can of chopped jalapeno peppers, and two small cans of sliced black olives with jalapenos (one can was used on top of cheese topped  casserole).  Otherwise I used the listed ingredients (with a little more cheese than listed).  I also found it easier to put the cheese topping on before baking in the oven after covering the casserole with aluminum foil.  One hour at 375 degrees did the trick.  It was delicious and even my meat eating friends loved it.  I will make it again soon!  Yummers.

This was fabulous! Had it with and without salsa and sour cream and was equally good! I used the red enchilada sauce and sweet corn because I couldnt find mexican corn, but I bet it would be even better with mexican corn!

Tastes wonderful!  However, I constructed this the way I was taught to make a tater tot casserole. Mixed all the sauce with the meat, onions, garlic and seasoning. Add to pan, top with all the cheese then beans, then corn. Top with tots so they are crunchy, not soggy!

My family loved it and my husband is not a traditional tater tot casserole fan.  The next time I make it I will use 1 1/2 lbs ground beef, as 1 lb. wasn't quite enough.  I added 1 small can of sliced black olives and used a 19 oz. can of enchilada sauce to ensure enough liquid to adequately cover.

Great tasting casserole! My daughter is very picky and won't eat potatoes. So, I used hash brown potatoes and told her it was a rice side dish. She loved it too lol!

Easy to make and  flavorful. I am going to add green chiles next time I make it and serve with more toppings (avocado, green onions, sour cream). Enjoy- freezes well too.

We loved it,it was something different instead of the same thing over and over. We would use potato rounds next time, the bed of shredded lettuce was a key component, it added a freshness and crunch,

This was awesome...  My son helped with Enchilada Sauce and he made it using the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce from this site (which is also very yummy by the way), and it looked, tasted and smelled amazing. I will definitely make it again. I actually will also try using the dish minus tater tots in tacos... Thanks for the recipe :)

I thought this was delicious!   I added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mixture and used just regular corn since that was what I had on hand.  I put the tater tots on top of the mixture instead of mixing it in like the one review said.  That was a good decision because it kept them crispy.  The tater tots were sooo good in this recipe, they are what gives it the yummy flavor and chewy consistancy.  Next time I'm using the entire bag instead of just half!  One bowl of this completely fills you up and in a house with three boys, that's a huge plus!! Definitely a new staple in our house.

Love how this recipe is versatile. I used a 32 oz bag of tator tots, placed in pan and baked 10 minutes first, then added sauce on top (probably about 3/4-1 cup), used can of chili beans drained and regular frozen corn.Topped with salsa and sour cream.  I would definitely make this again.   I think this recipe could be tweaked any way a person would like and it would turn out great!

This is fantastic!  My family loved it and there were no leftovers!  I did not use the corn and made my own enchilada sauce for it. It is very easy to make, and we will surely have this again!

I made it with sweet corn. My husband enjoyed it but i wasn't a fan...too much starch and cheese...needs more veggies or something to offset the fat content.  Not sure if i will make it again.

Only changes we made:
*Doubled the amount of tater tots.
*Can was only 10 oz for the enchilada sauce, so we added some salsa to it.
*Added a can of green chilis.

Quite good.

Incredible easy to make and so full of flavor!  Looks like tater tots will be bought more often in this household!  The next time I make it my wife asked if I would crunch up fritos as a topping once the casserole is done.

Made this last night, using the slow cooker as someone mentioned in their comment.  It turned out great and my family loved it!  I was hesitant about putting tater tots in the slow cooker, thinking they might be soggy but they weren't.  They fell apart a bit while serving, but were almost crispy on the outer edge.  This was a perfect one pot meal for everyone to dish up as they arrived home from their various activities.  I am adding this to my favourites!

I tried this on Cinco de Mayo and it was a good choice. The flavor is very good, but I agree with others who mentioned that the tater tots became mushy and disappeared into the meat mixture. Next time, I will put the tots on top. I stirred in a can of sliced black olives but otherwise followed the recipe, until I wasn't paying attention and put the entire can of enchilada sauce in the meat mixture but it turned out fine. I will make it again, maybe with sharp cheddar cheese.

The kids loved this!!!!  I added more tater tots and one and a half cans of enchilada sauce.  I left out black beans...  Serve with jalapeños and sour cream on the top of each plate if you like.  I'll be making again.  Going to add shredded chicken and rotel tomatoes to the next batch instead of beef.  Lots of possibilities with this one.

I have made a similar casserole without the "Mexican" flare.  One time I was out of potato tots but had frozen hashbrowns patties and used those instead.  They worked out great as they fit my casserole dish perfectly, I didn't have to take time arranging the tater tot's on top of the casserole, and it made cutting the casserole into servings easy.

This was pretty good and super filling. I'd bet you could make changes to make this work with whatever you have in the house and still have a crowd pleaser.

Really loved it and have made it twice now.  I'd recommend tasting the enchilada sauce and splashing some hot sauce in there to taste if you're a fan of  spicy food.  I use potato rounds instead of tater tots with the thought that it'd give the dish more crunchiness.  I really like the taco seasoning recipe on here as well and recommend using it with this casserole.

I used chicken in place of hamburger.  I also mixed mild and hot enchilada sauce, 10 ounces each.  I had a little left over. My husband loved it and is looking forward to leftovers  for dinner tomorrow night.

recipe is easy and versatile.  I added cumin and taco sauce to the meat sauce.it tasted flavorful. I only added beans to the meat (turkey). 
to change it up I poured half the enchilada sauce on the bottom. then added the meat and cheese mix. I then layered the tots on top, poured the remaining enchilada sauce then topped with cheese. 
will make again.

Oh was this yummy!  Love the way the tater tots just blended in with everything else to create  cheesey-gooey goodness!
Easily modified to suit different tastes, and it can also be adapted to the slow cooker!

Yummy and easy!  I followed recipe as is except I couldn't find the frozen Mexican corn at the store so I got a (frozen) Southwestern veggie mix instead.  The SW mix already had black beans in it so I did not use the canned beans listed in the recipe.  I can't wait to make this again using the Mexican corn (and beans) as I'm sure it is just as yummy.  For those of you who like leftovers, (I love them) this dish is best eaten hot out of the oven.  Tater Tots historically don't make good leftovers no matter how you serve them up.  I had some leftovers and ate them the next day.  They weren’t bad – definitely edible but not nearly as good hot out of the oven.  LOVE THIS DISH!

I made the recipe exactly as given and loved it! The second time I mixed in a can of diced tomatoes that had chilis in it and that was good too. Really this is a great recipe to try a little something different with it for fun.  Yummy! And thanks for sharing!

My picky family loves this recipe. I layer the tots on the bottom and top with the meat mixture in the center. It looks more presentable that way. I don't change the ingredients at all.

This is the best recipe I have ever found on this website or on the internet for that matter.  I loved this simple casserole and could easily make it with leftover enchilada sauce.  I used canned corn and simply drained most of the liquid.  I also didn't have black beans so I used another can of beans I had on hand.  The canned beans I used were Mexican style and had spices mixed in like cumin.  My son doesn't like corn but inhaled this dish.  Loved it and will make it over and over!

This was absolutely delicious. I personally didnt bother softening the corn, cooked it for an hour instead of 40 minutes, and the whole thing came out perfect. The corn tasted fresh and juicy and the whole thing didnt seem excessively cheesy or anything!

I only used how much I thought I would need, so I didn't use all the onion and garlic, but I used most of what else it called for. I don't like Mexican dishes but this was actually pretty good. Great leftovers with chips.

Just made this tonight! The husband, son and myself LOVED it!! Great flavor and easy to put together. Just a heads up- I have a convection oven and wasn't really thinking the sauce was a little thick on the bottom (whoops! )  So keep an eye out for that!

I never had tater tot casserole before and my husband loves Mexican food, so I thought this would be a real treat.  

I looked at 2 major grocery stores near my home and with the exception of the ground meat (I used ground turkey instead of beef), onion and garlic, I couldn't find a single ingredient that came in the amount listed in the ingredients.  So, I improvised and it came out good.  

I never realized how difficult it would be to find Mexican corn in San Antonio, so I used frozen sweet corn (not in the specified amount, either).  I used black beans with jalepenos (also not in the specified amount) and used almost twice as many tater tots and cheese.

The recipe turned out to be a good comfort food.  I'll make it again sometime, but it won't be a regular meal.

Easy to make, yes, but is a better enchilada filler  than main course. We ended up using the left overs with taco chips as a dip.

It was really good!!! U must leave the onions and garlic I added sour cream too and extra sauce so it would not be dry I may add a little more taco seasoning next time for more flavor also added the green chilis overall glad I made it will definitely do it again!

This recipe is easy and hits the spot. I couldn't follow the recipe to a "T" I had to use ingredients
I had on hand. Nevertheless, it was a hit!

Made this last night. I didn't have all of the ingredients listed, so I substituted peas for the corn and a mix of salsa and taco sauce for the enchilada sauce.  I know some ppl don't like reviews when you change the ingredients but I think it speaks to the flexibility and quality of the original recipe.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream and some Frank's Red Hot and it was fantastic.

I made this pretty much exactly as the recipe called for, altho I did add a small can of diced green chilies. I also added a few tater tots on the top just for presentation's sake. (My family loves the super crispy ones on the top.) This recipe is good as written. Next time I might add some chopped jalapenos and maybe use green onion. This one is a keeper for me.

My kids liked the tater tots. I didn't use enchilada sauce, but instead replaced it with 8 oz of tomato sauce. I also baked the tots first until nice and crispy. I added a can of diced chilies. I put the beef and veggie mixture at the bottom of the casserole dish. I covered that with the cooked tots and sprinkled the Mexican cheese on top. I then placed the dish in a preheated oven (375 degrees) until cheese was nice and melted. It's a nice quick meal for busy days, but not amazing or anything.

Very good!  My whole family loved it, especially my husband!  He likes spicy food, so he added hot sauce to it, but I enjoyed it without.  Very easy to make, too!

Its so simple and yet sooooo good. The only changes I would make just for me not because it would be any less tasty. I would added green peppers. I also would not mix the tater tots in but just add a layer on top then add cheese. Even tho my dad liked the mixture. I would have love to taste whole tater tots instead of the mushed up tater tots which is what ended up happening. I also cooked all ingredients ahead of time and just heated up cheese in the casserole. No need for 50 min bake I feel.

Yum! Perfect use for random frozen leftover French fries and taters tots. I used a combo of both and a mixture of leftover cheese. I topped mine with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and green onions. Black olives would be a nice garnish as well.

It was delish. I only had frozen hash browns potatoes so I used those and substituted frozen veggie mix for the corn and beans. Also I used ground turkey instead of the beef. So basically I completely changed the recipe!  Seriously, it was good and other than the cheese and using a canned sauce, it was fairly healthy.

Really good! I incorporated other reviewers' suggestions of a can of green chiles, a little hot sauce, and crumbled tortilla chips on top toward the end. We ate it with a salad of lettuce, tomato, avocado and yogurt/lime juice (the "cold parts" of a taco!) and it made a delicious meal. My family loved the tater tot twist on a Mexican casserole.

I love love love this recipe! it's easy, quick, and always a hit. I've made it dozens of times and even love the leftovers. the recipe is great as is but I've made a few tweaks which take it over the top. I use one whole can of green enchilada sauce on the bottom and one can of red enchilada sauce on the top. I like to use the crowns tater tots and reserve some to put on the top rather than mixing in so they get nice and crispy. of course I use more cheese. I also add some cumin to the meat. so delicious!

I won a staff put luck contest with this recipe. I made it pretty much as is. I do not like onions so I left those out. There were several comments about it looking pre-chewed or gross. But once people tried it they were in line for seconds. 

The second time I made it, I did a couple of things differently. 
1) I added part of a packet of dried enchilada sauce mix and subbed HOT taco seasoning. I think it made the dish much more flavorful. 
2) I used 1/2 mini tater tots and 1/2 regular tots. I think it gave it some extra texture.  

If I were making this for people that really liked spicy food, I would add some sliced jalapenos to the top with the cheese.

Soooo awesome!!!!  Baked in the oven for 25 min then added a layer of cheese and more tater tots on top.  Returned the pan to the oven and baked according to the directions on the tots bag (425 degrees for 20 min). I also used a tablespoon of dried minced onion instead of fresh.  Only thing I will change next time is doubling the enchilada sauce.  I used hot red enchilada sauce.   Extra veggies would also be great in this.

My whole family loved this one! Even my 15 month old who doesn't like corn, ate it up. I did make a few changes. I added a can of Rotel, used canned corn instead of frozen, and added sour cream to the mixture instead of cheese. I then added the cheese on top (my family loves cheese!).

Was really impressed at how good this was! Only substitution I made was to use onion powder in place of the diced onion as my wife and I aren't huge fans. A little dollop of sour cream made this delicious!

We enjoyed this recipe. Just a few things to consider...It makes a lot, we are a family of 6 and we still have almost half the pan left.  We had a salad with it, but it was just a little side salad.  I added extra cheese, I always do, we are a cheese loving family:). We didn't need to bake it that long.  We took it out after 25 minutes.  This recipe is really good using venison!!

When making this, I thought for sure I would have alot left over. WRONG. My husband went for seconds(YAY!!!)which is an indicator of how he likes a dish. The kids really liked it as well and my daughter took some left overs in her thermos for lunch. It was a bit spicy with "medium" enchilada sauce - the store was out of mild and I used ground turkey. I was short on time so I baked this at 400 for 30 mins and it turned out great with some of the taters coming out a bit crispy if the were on the very top layer. Y.U.M.  Will defintely make this again for the fam.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very easy to make.  I found I didn't care too much for the black beans, but that's just my taste.  It was a very big hit with the rest of the family.  Next time I make it, I'll probably leave out the beans.

We made it last night. It was really good. My one year old ate the entire (kid size) bowl we had given him. I loved it and I don't like black beans but am planning on making it again.

I made this and I have to say it was FANTASTIC! My husband usually snubs his nose up at kid type recipes, but he ate three servings!!!! The corn and the enchilada sauce make this. You have to try it, you won't be sorry!

It was really good. I added a can of green chilies to the ground meat.  I made my own taco seasoning, and  I added fresh cilantro. But the base of the recipe was great. Thanks!

I made it with vegetarian burger as I am vegetarian, however, it was great! I liked it a lot! I used a little habanaro cheese on top as well as the Mexican cheese. I think I will make this one again...

Hubby loved it.  We are meatless so I subbed green pepper, red pepper and mushrooms for 1 lb. hamburger.  As others recommended I added a can of green chillies. The last 5 mins where you add the additional cheese, I thought it seemed a little dry so I added some salsa and poked holes so it could get into the casserole.  My grocer didn't have frozen Mexican corn so I used frozen roasted corn and it gave it a yummy sweet flavor.  Will definitely do again.

I made this for the family last night and they LOVED IT. I topped it with crumbled tortilla chips when I put the cheese on at the end. I also served it with chopped lettuce, black olives, tomato, salsa and sour cream. Next time I would add more enchilada sauce or possibly some salsa. We will be having this again for sure!

I was so happy, happy, happy I made this.  The flavors were great together & I used everything in the original recipe. I used lean ground sirloin & did not have to drain the meat. It was not dry at all. I definitely will make this again.  A keeper!!!!  :-)))

This was pretty darn good. A bag of tater tots were opened so I wanted to use the remaining tots before they went bad and came across this recipe. I used Alexia potato puffs with garlic and cracked black pepper, so it gave the casserole extra flavor. I also added a small can of green chiles and topped my serving with sour cream. Goodness gracious! I'll definitely make this again but will double the recipe. It went entirely too fast!

Wasn't too sure of this recipe. I cooked it last Friday when my girls arrived at the house. Wow! They scarfed it down. We went through more than half the pan. The prep was easy and fast. I see making this at least once a month.

Not spicy but very tasty!  Hubby and daughter loved it too.  Only (minor) subs were using taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce and chili beans in place of black beans because that's what I had in my pantry.  Will definitely make this again.

A GREAT RECIPE!!!  I made a few tweeks: I added a jar of chunky salsa to the cooked ground beef.  And I added another jar of salsa to the bottom of the pan.  (I omitted the enchilada sauce entirely).  I also cooked the tater tots on a baking sheet ahead of time because I like them to be a bit crispier.  Once they were cooked I placed them on top of the ground beef, topped with cheese and baked.  I served with a side of sour cream (seasoned with a few dashes of adobo seasoning) and chopped avocado seasoned with a few dashes of lime juice).  I'm going to try crushing corn chips instead of tater tots next time. YUMMMMM!!!!!

I made this recipe last night, but altered it to vegetarian. It was absolutely delicious. For this version I omitted the ground beef and instead combined the taco seasoning, onion, garlic, corn, black beans, added diced red pepper, and 1 can of green chilies in a non stick skillet for 6-8 minutes on medium/high. Then combine the tater tots and cheese (I used Monterey Jack) along with the corn mixture in a large bowl. Layer the 1/3 enchilada sauce, then tater tot mixture, then remaining enchilada sauce in prepared dish. Bake, top with a little extra cheese, bake for 5 more minutes. Absolutely wonderful! Will be making this again soon!

I must admit, I was a bit hesitant to try this recipe, but my husband wanted to try it - very glad I did.  Loved it!  When I try a recipe for the first time I follow it to a "T", then from that point on I adjust to my liking.  Only thing I will add is  alittle more cheese and a bit more enchilada sauce.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

Made this recipe last week and it was delicious!!  VERY easy to make as well.  Left out corn and beans, don't care for them in it but added a can of Rotel.  Used more enchilada sauce and less cheese just to try to make a little less fattening.  Husband wanted seconds and thirds!  Will definitely be making this more often!

My husband and I didn't care much for it. We both didn't like the tater tots in it. It was good before adding the tater tots and sauce. Sorry.

Added extra sauce since most cans are 11 oz and extra corn, beans, etc because of the same. Also did the green chilies and it was GREAT! Good next day as well!

I've made regular Tater Tot Casserole and it was OK. This recipe for Tater Tot Taco Casserole is fantastic. The only thing I added to this recipe was some Salsa while eating it.

A great recipe and have enjoyed it with both beef (undrained and drained) and chicken!!  I added a can of Ro-Tel (diced tomatoes with green or red chili peppers) along with an additional half packet of taco seasoning, and served with jalapenos,sour cream and salsa for a bit more heat and flavor...all good...thanks for this...well done!

My girls and I really liked this dinner. It was super easy to make and smelled great cooking. Left out the onions and garlic and used regular frozen corn. I think this would be great as a potluck dish. Will definitely make again. Thanks!!

I made this (doubled) for the Youth Group at my church yesterday & it was a HUGE HIT! The director & assistant asked me for the recipe. I followed it exactly as written & was not dissappointed. I served sour cream on the side along with pickled jalapenos (sp?) for those that wanted a little more spice. Thanks for a great recipe. I will be making this again.

A keeper. My adaptions-used regular frozen corn, 28 oz medium green sauce, and a small can of diced chilis, garlic/parsley mix, and a heaping big spoonful of bulk taco seasoning.

I was in need of a quick meal when I found this one, I did not have all the ingredients so I made some changes used refried beans and easy melt cheese.  Turned out great. My family loves spicy foods and my picky little eater loved it too. Also I precooked the tater tots while browning the meat, sped things way up. Total cook and prep was about 40 minutes.

cheesy comfort food at it's finest!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, used low sodium taco seasoning, omitted the corn since I figured the potatoes were starchy enough and served it topped with plain greek yogurt.  This is definitely on my splurge list and may make it for an upcoming potluck :)

When I first mentioned this recipe, my family thought I was crazy to give it a try.  However, three times making it later, they love it!  There is barely anything left, and there are only three of us.  Even the picky eater goes back for more.

This was wonderful! I did, however, have some confusion as to how to mix the meat and tater totts (do I mix the meat etc and layer OVER the totts?)...what I did was mix the meat and all other ingerdients including the totts, pressed and and layered over spanish rice with diced tomatoes in the baking dish.  I also added sliced olives to the meat mixture.  This dish ended up amazing!  Served with hot corn bread....it was a five star hit! Thank you for the idea! Will definitly make again!

After reading the recipe and many reviews, I decided to try this casserole and I'm very glad I did!  I didn't necessarily stick to the measurements exactly, but threw things all together and the end result was very tasty!  I couldn't find canned enchilada sauce at my grocery store so used a jar of green salsa to which I added 1/2 tsp of cumin.  Next time I'll try the 10 minute enchilada sauce off this site as recommended by another reviewer.  I would definitely make this again - thanks for posting the recipe and thanks to all who left reviews. Happy cooking, everyone!

Love this recipe! I do use diced chicken in place of ground beef since I don't really care for it and I double everything except the corn(I use plain frozen corn)and the black beans. Top with some sour cream and you have a tasty meal. My kids devour it even my 2 year old. Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for a useful recipe. There are times I need a casserole type dish, church, school and this works very well. I made it this afternoon with the addition of green/red/jalapeno peppers and roma tomatoes all diced. Very Good! Thank you again

This gets 5 stars for ease of preparation, versatility and flavor.  I did double the amount of tater tots, which I would definitely do again.  Also, I think I'd add some jalapenos, but that's a personal preference.  Sour cream is another topping option.  This reheated nicely and was very tasty, especially as leftovers.  Overall, it was a nice change of pace that will now go in my rotation!  I'd also be interested to know if anyone has tried freezing this.

Really good! I left out the corn and beans per family request. I would have liked it with them. I used the red enchilada sauce that came in a 10oz can. I also used frozen onions since I had those on hand, and threw in a little bit of frozen green pepper.  I used the whole bag of tater tots (28oz) and added a layer of them on top for some crunch. I pre baked them as a previous reviewer suggested. Very good, will make again.
