Pretty good made just as the recipe says, but there are a couple of changes I may try next time.  For starters there are A LOT of noodles. I would cut them down to 16 oz. instead of 24. I also added 2c. more cheese because someone else said it was more macaroni and tomatoes than mac n cheese. I'm glad I did because it was better cheesier. I also browned the beef with a little pepper and garlic salt for flavor.  I think maybe next time I will use a little less juice (since I will use less macaroni), 6c. not 4 of cheese, and also add some italian seasoning. Maybe using v8 or spicy v8 instead would also kick it up a notch? Anyway, I liked it and it's a good versatile recipe you can play with or use as is. My toddler loved it and ate like a piggy!

My daughter and husband really liked this dish. Like the others before me, I too made some modifications since I thought 2 boxes of pasta would be way too much. I used one box of tri-colored rotini, a bag of Soy crumbles (made it vegetarian!), one 16 oz bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, a 14oz can of diced Fire Roasted tomatoes, diced onion and green pepper, shredded zucchini, carrot, and mushroom,  and half of a 16 oz bottle of regular V-8. My husband liked it so much he wants it again this week, but with 'real' meat in it this time! :)

This recipe is simply fantastic.  I was looking for an easy Friday night meal for my family and came across this one.  I have three teenage boys and they loved this.  It has become a weekly staple.  I added a little more ground beef for my boys the second time we tried.  GREAT!!

I read the other reviews and thought I needed to add a little more to the recipe- I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and gluten-free noodles instead of regular ones. I also added another 1/2 bag of cheese and even added some cream cheese to make it even creamier. I added some chili powder, which I think was a mistake. That or the cream cheese. I think simply adding garlic and onion powder with a little salt would have done much better.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  However, even using just the 16 oz box of macaroni noodles, this recipe makes a TON!  I will probably try to halve it next time.  We have eaten it twice and still have alot left.  I used the mild Rotel tomatoes.  It was a little spicy, but my husband said he liked it that way.  I used 6 cups of cheese instead of 4 and loved that.  Next time, I will use more ground beef because I think that will enhance it even more.  But, seriously, if you make this recipe, even with the 16 oz of noodles, please put it in a bigger pan than is called for or it will boil over in your oven like mine did.

This was delicious!  It honestly looked pretty bland, but it was VERY TASTY!  I of course made modifications, as other reviewers did.  I used a 16 oz box of elbow mac, Hot & Spicy V8 (3/4 of the 48oz bottle), 1-14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes w/green chilies, and once mixed and put in the baking dish, I poured some pasta sauce over the 'exposed' noodles to avoid drying.  Then topped with the cheese.  I would say...make sure to broil at the end because this really made the dish delicious!!!  Freezes well!

Where as my childrend LOVED this, it really shouldn't be called Macaroni and cheese.  It's more like a goulash.  There was not even CLOSE to enough cheese in it to constitute calling it Macaroni and cheese.  Also, the recipe said it served 7 but in reality it was enough to serve an army.  Our family of 6 ate it for dinner, lunch the  next day and lunch the day after that!!!  My husband and I thought it was OK.  Will make again in a smaller batch as my children enjoyed it.

I also would not call it macaroni and cheese, but I WOULD call it good. Used Ro-Tel tomoatoes as someone suggested. (the recipe is incorrect, it needs only 1-12oz box of pasta, probably just a typo), and I did saute' the optional onion in with the meat.  Thanks for this recipe, I have a feeling the leftovers will taste even better once they absorb more tomato juice.

The taste is good, but I am surprised no one has mentioned that the directions are off a bit. The ingredients mention a chopped onin, but the directions don't tell you where to add it (I am guessing while browning the beef).  Also, the cheese in the ingredients is measured in cups, whereas in the directions it says "one package of the grated cheese". I pretty much did a lot of this recipe by common sense, but just had to mention these things. Also I agree, it is a lot like goulash rather than mac & cheese, but it is still pretty tasty.

I did not care for this recipe.  First of all it is NOT a macaroni and cheese recipe, it is a "beefaroni" recipe, and not a good one at that. It is like pouring ketchup on pasta and calling it spagetti.  It is watery, has no flavor, and most of all no cheese flavor at all.

I LOVE this recipe!  I do agree with the other reviews, that it is more like a goulash.  Here are the changes I made: one package of noodles, about a cup more cheese, olives, onion and mushrooms. This was a huge hit when I brought it for everyone to eat on Christmas Eve.

This turned out great.  I added the onion and garlic when I browned the ground beef.  For tomatoes, I added 4 C of diced cherry tomatoes from the garden.  I also threw in about a cup and a half of parmesean cheese.  mmmmm mmmm good.

Interesting way of making mac n cheez.  Waaay too many noodles, tho!  Best to play it by ear.  Don't use prepacked shredded cheese.  For some reason it just doesn't melt!  Will make again with a few adjustments.

Very easy & popular at a pot-luck luncheon.  My changes include Rotel tomatoes and a touch of Bloody Mary mix to spice it up a little.  Even better as leftovers!

OK so I think I added too much Macaroni, when something says 2 (12 oz) ... I think 24 oz, dont you? well this made so much, and it was not cheesy at all, so perhaps Ill try again with less pasta... not bad other than that let down.

This is a great, easy, weeknight meal!  It reminded me of the cheesy goulash I got in school as a kid.   I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I doctored  up the meat with salt, pepper, and a little cayenne.  I only used 16oz of noodles and about 3/4 of the tomatoes and juice.  I also used about twice the amount of cheese.  It makes quite a bit (a full 9X13 and probably enough left in the pot for an 8X8 as well) so next time I would half it.  
We really enjoyed it!  I'll be keeping this as a go-to staple.

It was just okay...a bit bland. It needs something for pizazz. I did add salt scantly, a bit of pepper, onion and garlic powder. I suggest serving with a green vegetable or salad.

I agree with previous reviews that this recipe, as is, would make  enough to feed way more than 7 people.  I used 12oz  package of macaroni and I still made enough to fill one large rectangle glass pyrex dish as well as one large round corningware dish.  after my dh and I were finished eating generous size servings, we have enough left over to feed at least 6 people, easily!  And that was using half the recommended amount of noodles.  Aside from that, I didn't have any tomato JUICE on hand, so I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce +1 can of water, and a 10oz can of Rotel.  6. of sharp cheddar that I grated myself (Tillamook, yum!) plus I added 1 small squash and about 3/4 of red bell pepper just because I had it and I wanted to add some veggies to the dish.  Even though it wasn't as saucy as maybe its intended to be it still was very flavorful and we enjoyed it.   I will probably make it again, but use the recommended tomato juice or V8 as others recommended.  I wonder if the recommended amounts were a litle more than it needs though? because with one 10oz can undrained tomatoes and 8oz sauce +8oz water, it was still watery even after the oven time.  A recommended cook time would be helpful too.

I jimmied with this recipie quite a bit but it turned out great.  I used boxed mac 'n cheese and ground turkey breast to cut the fat and calories a little bit.  The only tomato product I had on hand was sauce, so I used about a half a can of that.  I sprinkled a handful of chedder cheese and some breadcrumbs on top.  It was REALLY good.

I personally like it and it's easy to make...but if you...or anyone in your family, doesn't like tomatos, it's not for you.  It should be macaroni and tomatos...not macaroni and cheese.
