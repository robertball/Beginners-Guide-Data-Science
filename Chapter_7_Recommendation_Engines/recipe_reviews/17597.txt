This was the most delicious thing I have ever cooked! However, I modified it by stuffing with black beans and putting the ingredients in the recipe on top before baking. A++++ Many compliments from my family and definetly a winner!

This was great, didn't even need the picante sauce.  I used a mix of hot peppers to increase the heat.  Will definitely become one of my regulars!!

This was delicious!  It was easy, quick to prepare, and very flavorful.  My grocery store was out of diced jalepenos, so I used mild diced chiles, which were a fine substitute.  I skipped the picante sauce.  A bonus: My house smelled great while this was roasting!

This was different but I wasn't impressed. Won't make it again.
