EXCELLENT!!!  This is the best soup I have ever made.  If you like cream of potato soup then you will love this.  I doubled the recipe to serve at a Halloween party and did NOT add the margarine.  You do not need that at all so save yourself the extra fat/calories and you won't have that grease sitting on top of it when it seperates.  Thanks so much for the recipe...I will make again and again. :o)

Hi! I am Rebecca.  I like this recipe.  When I was making this, I had a bad feeling that I might make it wrong, or it wouldn't taste good.  But at the end, I tasted it, and it was so good!  But I cut the bacon too big, and my mom said the onions were too big.  My brothers liked it.  For a side dish, we had corn bread.  My family liked it.  But I loved it!

Unless you live alone, or you're on a 1,000 calorie a day diet, just double this recipe, it's that good. I've shared some with friends and family, and everyone thinks this is my best effort yet.
The only thing I changed was to add a can of regular corn as well as he cream style corn, and I fried the bacon crispy before adding the onions.
You'll love this soup!!

Very quick and easy soup. Delicious! The only change I would make is to add the bacon drippings for more flavor. I took advice from others and added 1 can whole kernal corn and used low sodium beef broth in place of the water. Will definitely make this again!!

This is THE best corn chowder we have ever had!  Cooked the bacon very crispy (we don't like gobs of fat chucks floating around) and added an extra can of regular corn.  Simply delicious!

This chowder was absolutely delicious!  Hearty, hot and flavorful.  We only used half of the amount of cheese called for (bagged/shredded), but it was just as creamy as we could have hoped for.

Good enough for me!  I threw in some leftover kielbasa and used shredded (probably doubled the amount, I like my cheese) cheddar cheese instead of what's listed in recipe.

This wasn't exactly what I was looking for, but it turned out ok.  The flavors were good but a little on the bland side and I didn't like the thin consistency.  I ended up adding cornstarch to try to thicken it but it was still pretty runny.  The family ate it nontheless.  Will try a different version next time.

EXCELLENT!  Made it for my husband and I and we absolutely loved it.  I will definitely be making this again!  Made it exactly as the recipe said and it was perfect.  Next time though I think I will try the Campbell's cheese soup instead of cheese cubes.

Pretty good! I didn't have a scale to weigh 3 pounds of potatoes. I only had a 5 pound bag of red potatoes so I just used a little less than the whole bag. Plus, I read some comments about the broth being watery, which I did not want. So I figured if I diced some of the potatoes smaller and then boil/simmer them a little longer, they would break away and thicken the broth...which they did! I didn't bother peeling them either. I put a little chicken broth in with the water which was probably of waste. I used cheese whiz which is all I had. Either that, or sliced American cheese. So I went with the whiz. And I added the extra can of corn like some suggested. I also used a whole pack of bacon because there's never too much bacon. I didn't add very much salt, but a Lot of black pepper and a little garlic powder. And I let it all simmer for about 35 minutes or so to really give the broth a chance to thicken. It's not terribly thick, but far from watery. It's perfect. It seems to get better with every spoonful! I can tell this is going to be a GREAT left over. Excellent recipe! Next time I'm going to try it with some of the better cheeses that others have suggested and get a better handle on how much potatoes I use.

Love this recipe! I made half of the recipe and it was perfect for the 3 of us and we had leftover for all of us for lunch the next day.  I think it may have been better the next day too! I did add about half a cup of diced red pepper, but that was the only change made.  Delicious soup, definitely a keeper!

I didn't make any changes to this recipe.  It was just OK for me.  That's why I only gave it a three.  Was a little to bland for me.  I'm not sure what it was missing.

Too thin, and lacked flavor.  I doubled the amount of potatoes, and then whipped about 3 cups of the potatoes with milk in blender.  Added this to the soup to thicken it.  I added shredded jack and cheddar cheese, and then added milk until I got the consistency I wanted.   Also doubled bacon so we had enough to garnish soup.  Added salt and pepper to flavor, and this became a true winner.

Made this tonight for dinner.  It was great!  I discovered I was out of evaporated milk so I subbed 2%.  Also, I added the kernels of 2 fresh ears of corn - I just happened to have them.  Delicious!

Corn chowder is my most favorite soup and I was on a mission to make it. I never knew how easy it would be to make it! This recipe is super easy and came out tasting WONDERFUL! I think I put too much water in it because it was a little thin, I covered the diced potatoes with water - but it maybe had 1" of water above them once they settled. I also forgot to put the whole milk in - until after I had finished my bowl for the night - but added it in the next day and it was wonderful. It also makes A LOT of chowder - I froze half of it thinking I would be sick of the chowder by now - but I am going to defrost it soon since the half I left in the fridge is almost all gone. I used the Campbell's Cheddar Cheese as suggested (wow! I never knew Campbell's made cheddar cheese in a can until I read reviews here - I'll be using that for other recipes) - but I quickly took out as much as I could because I did not like the cheesey taste. And, I put in 6oz. of bacon and 2cans creamed corn + 1 can regular corn as others suggested - and I felt that was the perfect amount for the soup. YUMMY, easy to make corn chowder - and I am still excited that I now know how to make my favorite soup! Thanks!!!!

This corn chowder is awesome!!! Just make sure you don't add too much water that way the soup is thick! Although i would recommend using chicken broth instead of water,its better, more flavorful!

Did not like. I ended up adding a lot more cheese, salt and cream. Very bland. Maybe next time drain the potatoes and substitute that liquid for milk or cream instead of just adding the other ingredients to the potato water it was boiled in. I had to add a lot to make it taste good.

This is wonderful as is, but I've found this recipe makes an excellent base to ANY type of chowder. Toss in some clams, oysters, shrimp, other veggies... anything you like and you're guaranteed to have a tasty dinner. Really good paired with some cornbread or a thick slice of garlic toast.

This was great! I adapted a few things because of not having all of the ingredients. We used just whole milk instead of canned, and cheddar cheese rather than processed cheese. It was a hit with the whole family!

Yummy!  I would suggest using precooked bacon to stop your whole chowder from becoming greasy.

Very good soup. Like some other people, I used chicken broth instead of water. I don't really measure anything and I used a combination of mostly cheddar cheese and some Munster. Seems like a very forgiving recipe. All I had on hand was a frozen bag of mixed veggies containing corn, carrots and asparagus. It came out very good and my children LOVED it!

This soup is growing on me... I didn't love it when I first made it, but I froze a bunch and I'm finding that I like it quite a bit. I followed other suggestions and added a can of corn. Also, some people said it was too watery. The recipe doesn't really say, but I think maybe you are supposed to drain the potatoes after you boil them, rather than keeping the water in the pot. I took out about half the water and it was fine, but maybe slightly too watery. Next time I would take out more of the water.

This is the first time I ever made corn chowder, and this was simple and very tasty.  I tripled the recipe because a single or even double wouldn't have given us leftovers.  Very tasty, I didn't change anything.  I added chicken to it to make it like a chicken corn chowder I buy, and this was better than that.  Definitely will make this again, it's a keeper!

Amazing! I used 1 can of Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup instead of the cubed cheese and it came out perfectly. Great dish for the fall.

This soup is great! I'm eating it RIGHT NOW!! I didn't do it EXACTLY as said. First off, there is absolutely no need to put butter/margarine. Second, I didn't put the bacon in the soup (well, I put there slices without cooking them first... you know, sorta like when you make baked beans??) - but I don't think that did much. What I did, is like someelse said, I sprinkled the bacon on the soup. Right now, I also put gruyere on top... It melted and is sooo yummy.

Wonderful!  I followed the suggestions of others in that I used chicken broth in place of water, added more bacon (doubled the recipe to 1/2 lb), and added a can of corn.  However, I cooked the bacon without the onion, then sautéed the onion in the bacon drippings.  I also used a combination of 3 oz Mexican Velveeta and 1 oz American sliced, and added a small can of crab meat. I garnished each serving with crab meat from a second small can.  For the pot, use the least expensive crab as it disappears into the chowder.  It was a tremendous hit!  I will make this often and double it next time to have leftovers.

This was nice and easy and tasty.  One thing, though - I used real cheddar cheese, grated into the chowder until it was thick enough for my liking.

This soup is great.  It was quick, easy, relatively inexpensive, and I usually have the ingredients on hand other than the cheese.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this.  Thank you for the recipe.

Incredibly easy and good!  As I was making it, I thought it would be bland because I wasn't adding any spices, but it turned out great!  the only cheese I had on hand was grated cheddar, so used that.  Next time I'll try the Campbell's cheese. I've added another comfort food to my list of favorites!

I did it all backwards.  I didn't read the directions before hand and I put it all in a small pressure cooker and put it on too high of a temp.  Despite it all I will definitely make again and just throw it all in together in the crockpot.  I'm sure that it will work just as well that way.  Excellent after a cold day.  Thank you!!

It turned out really good. I doubled the amount of cheese, added 6oz of bacon instead of 4 oz and did not add any salt or pepper. The whole family liked it including my picky 4 year old.

I made this when I stayed with friends over New Year's Eve and it was a big hit. A hearty soup that will stick to your ribs and impress your friends. I did add a little hot sauce to the soup for extra flavor. Grab some wine and crusty bread and enjoy. Thanks for the great recipe.

We LOVED this soup. I do think there is a misunderstanding in the directions for some people. You do need to drain the potatoes or I’m sure it’ll be very bland.

This was a good soup...one change I made was to use Irish cheese. I didn't have any velveeta cheese. It still gave a good flavor to the chowder. My family liked it.

Great recipe but i didnt use that much liquids the 3/4 cup milk was too much, i also used 2 cans cream corn and 2 1/2 regular corn. Everything else i kept the same. It tastes great ! Just wish i had slowly poured in the milk to see how much was necessary because the chowder did come out a little thinner than i wanted but in all i think it was wonderdull for a first time recipe!!! Thanks for sharing (:

I have been making this recipe for about a year.  Very good!! I do add extra potato and can of kernel corn (I crush some to get the corn juices in the broth).  I use lite 3 cheese mexican cheese - my first time I made without the cheese, but it definately adds flavor and a little thicker.  A trick I got from a magazine-if you have used corn cobs, add to the potatos while cooking and remove and scrape kernels into pot before adding rest of ingredients-did this last summer and the flavor was very corny. No pun intended.
