Love this dip!  I used smoked paprika and traded ground red pepper for cayenne to keep the heat down for kids. I tried to use less olive oil but the texture was off.  You need the full 1/2 cup.

Turned out great!  Simple and easy use with feta.  I used Greek yogurt and not a true measure - resulted in nearly 2 cups but I added a little more feta, etc.

Turned out great and would make it again. Used a bit more garlic and lemon juice.

this is delicious! i made it with a few changes. no cayenne. only one clove of garlic. used 1/4 cup buttermilk instead of yogurt just because i was out of yogurt.  the consistency was thinner, almost like ketchup consistency. but so delicious with cucumbers tomatoes and pita chips!

Really good. It came out silky smooth in the food processor which I love. I added a few sundried tomatoes since I was out of garlic (added dried). Nice flavor. Salty but okay.

Salty and tangy. Next time I will add way more cayenne for extra spice (wasn't super spicy) and more paprika for extra colour.

I made a 1/3 recipe because I only had 6 oz of feta but I just ate half of it myself.... I added a bit extra garlic and used quite a bit extra Kashmiri chili powder (closest I can get to paprika) to make it spicy. Delicious! I ate it with veggies and a spoon by the end :)

My crowd liked it. I cut the recipe in half because I had a small processor and added extra olive oil to thin it. Will make again but with my full size processor to really smooth it out.
