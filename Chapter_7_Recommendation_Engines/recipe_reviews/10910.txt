You won't have problems with these being too gooey if you allow them to boil for approximately 2.5 minutes. I didn't stir during boiling time. For variation these are good with dry roasted peanuts and raisins, too. Yummy treat, Diana, thanks.

I made these alot when I was a kid.  To make things even faster we would spead out 4 or 5 sheets of wax paper and put and put 1/4 or more on each paper and roll them into logs.  We would put them into the fridge right away and they would set quickly.  After a few hours you unroll the log and cut into pieces.  My kids love them because they are so easy for them to make and eat.

I love these cookies.  I made 1-1/2 batches yesterday afternoon and they are already gone. (I'm not going to tell you who ate them all *smile*).  I didnt' even bother making these into cookies...it was eaten right out of the pan. I didn't add the coconut because I didn't have any.  And when I do have chopped pecans, I like to throw a handful of them in.  Diana...I too know this recipe by heart since I make these so much.  Thanks for your submission.  OH..and I do add a spoonful of Peanut Butter.  :)

I have made this same recipe for years!  The only exception being without the coconut.  My family love them!  I always run out too quickly.  They are so easy that my husband will even make them!  He even taught me that if you don't want them to be so gooy, cook them for one full minute once they start come to a full boil.  This makes all the difference!  But be sure to drop them onto wax paper quickly, they will set up much quicker by doing this.

These were fun, easy and yummy. However I did change the recipe quite a bit.  Instead of milk I used coconut milk, instead of butter i used coconut oil.  I also used WAY less sugar and added cinnamon at the end.  I also added raisins.  I can't be bothered to measure with recipes like this so i encourage you all to use this as a template and I'm excited to see what other cooks come up with.  Enjoy!

Wow... I had no oats... I used "Quaker Kids' Oatmeal" I wasn't sure how it would turn out but it tasted great, just like my mom used to make!!  This is very kid friendly and my son helped me from beginning to end.  It was really fun because the Oatmeal had "Hatching Dino eggs" so there were tiny colourful dinosaurs through them.. and when we were done we put a "Smartie" on top of each one!! What great tasting quality time we had!! This will be a regular treat in my house.. thanks so much!

We made these when we were kids - my Mom called them Hot Rods (because they go so fast) and my husband called them Frogs (because they looked like one).  Only difference is that my recipe calls to boil and stir for 5 minutes - makes all the difference in consistency.  Enjoy.

I used 1&1/2 cups oats added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. I also added 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. To try for a low calorie treat I used skim milk, splenda, 1/2 stick butter and 1/3 cup smuckers oil/shortening substitute.I made these many years ago when my mom thought I was too young to use the oven. It has a little different texture with all the diet substitutes but they still got firm and helped my sweet tooth. thanks Diana!!

Easy and tasty!  I modified a little and used coconut oil instead of butter, 2 cups of Bob's Red Mill Natural granola and 1 cup oats.  The sweetness in the granola led to only adding 3/4 c brown sugar (instead of white).  Also the granola adds a crunch to it all.  Finally, I added 1 lidfull of vanilla- turned out great!  Thanks!

Yum!  I thought these woulld have a little more crisp for some reason.  I think I'll try Rice Crispies instead of oatmeal, just to see if I can get that slight crunch.  Had great flavor!

real easy, real good! can't imagine it without the coconut. and if you use coconut, the sugar could probably be reduced big time. a little bit too sweet.

This is not the type of recipe that can ever really earn 5 stars - has nothing to do with the cook, it's just that there is not enough ooey gooey to it.  It borders on the verge of health food for me - it's one of those recipes that kids need to make to introduce them to cooking, or one that you make when you have that can of cocoa still sitting on the shelf and need something to do with it.

I thought adding 3 cups of rolled oats would make it really chewy, so I added 2 cups of quick oats and 1 cup of rolled oats: I'm glad I did!  I also added a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter, because I didn't have quite enough cocoa powder.

These are sooo delicious. We made them for a church cookie exchange. It took us about 30 minutes to make 60. I would make these again. One of my new favourites!

So yummy, sweet and a nice treat that is easy to make.  I appreciate that there is no peanut butter as is the case with most no-bake cookies.  I was able to send them with my son for a camp bake sale.  Thanks!

These turned out so well. I had these ingredients on hand and saw this recipe and decided to make them. I didn't have any rolled oats so i used 2 packs of instant apple cinnamon oatmeal and one pack of maple & brown sugar oatmeal. It turned out to be a little less than 3 cups total. I did everything else as followed and they turned out great! My three year old son just has a blast making them, we will def be making these again soon. Thanks Diana!

Just like my sister and I made as kids.  I added some butterscotch chips to half of the mix since my husband doesn't like chocolate as much as I do.  Love it!

This recipe is just OK.  I love the bold chocolate flavor, but mine never set.  I ended up putting them in the freezer, but they melded together when warm.  I am going to play around with the recipe to see what works.

Can't beat these for a quick and easy treat to satisfy a chocolate sweet tooth!  I guess I was in a hurry and ate some too soon as the oatmeal was dry & chewy and they didn't hold together well.  Keeping them in the refrigerator overnight seemed to be the solution to that problem...  Instead of coconut I used raisins.  mmmm-chocolate covered raisins

Kids and husband agree - only three stars! Oats are too chewy even when I used 2 cups of quick cook oats and 1 cup rolled oats.  The coconut made these very sweet- too much even for my sweet tooth husband!
Next time I try this I will use only quick cook oats, 1/2 the coconut and add peanut butter to help the texture and cut the sweetness.  Good overall concept though.

These are good, not superb. Definitely quick and easy and great to make with kids. They should be called a macaroon since they're very gooey and super moist. **UPDATE** Yikes, I originally gave this 4 stars, but after tasting it the morning after, I will have to change it to 2 stars - at best! After it sits overnight, they get hard and grainy in texture. Awful to eat,  This is definitely something you eat the day you make it or else the texture the next day is terrible: hard, sugary and grainy. Will not make again.

Love it!  Same as my mom used to make when I was a kid. I don't use coconut but I do add a bit of vanilla extract (I think I add that to everything I bake though)...Delicious and fast!

Just like the cookies I used to have as a child. I like to freeze them and eat them cold. whenever I make them they don't last at all because everyone eats them so fast.

extremely quick and easy to make. I ended up making 2 batches (one for myself). The only thing i didnt like was it was a bit too oily.

I added a tsp of vanilla.  In order to save a few calories, I used 1/3 cup butter and they were still yummy and a nice change from the peanut butter oatmeal no-bakes I usually make.  The coconut added a nice touch.  Thanks!

Oh so yummy!  This is a great variation from the way I usually make these(off the Hershey cocoa can).  I reduced oats to 2 cups, and doubled the coconut.  Very easy and very yummy.  In my eagerness to get these to set ASAP, I put them in the freezer.  Then, I forgot I put them there.  What a mess!  Do not do this unless you want to pick wax paper off your cookies.

I love this recipe.  Nice and easy to make and has the benefit of being gluten free so it's great to take to parties.
I've used both sweetened and unsweetened coconut and I would much recommend the unsweetened coconut.  But the coconut is a must for me.

When it comes to a full rolling boil you really have to cook it for at the very least two minutes. Three is a little more like it. If you only cook it for one minute you will have sticky cookies not fudge like cookies

We have made these for years.  One thing about the boil time. Depending a little on your humidity, but somewhere between 1.5-3 minutes is good.

This is a very good recipe for throwing together something quickly when I have those chocolate cravings. I read a review that stated it was too gooey. When in doubt, add walnuts (or pecans, dried fruit, peanuts, more oats, etc.)! I added about 1.5 cups to make it more of a treat/snack than a cookie. Also, since I'm a die hard chocolate fan, I typically add an extra pinch of cocoa. I sprayed a cake pan and allowed the mixture to set in the freezer for an hour. When I took it out and taste tested it, it was very rich and sweet! Instead of normal sized cookies I diced it up into one inch squares. The cake pan allows them to set into a pretty shape rather than spooning them. They are pretty hard to resist. Thank you for this recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

I had to make a tweak since I didn't have plain oatmeal.  I had a box of Maple Brown Sugar packets and used 6 of them with only one cup of sugar.  The rest of the recipe was the same and they turned out wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I had a craving for chocolate, and only cocoa on hand. I made this up and it was quick and super-chocolatey-- just perfect.

These cookies were great and easy to make. My daughter helped all the way through. I doubled the recipe and then added an extra cup of coconut. These are great and I'll definitely make them again.

Yes to chocolately, yes to quick - no to texture, no to flavor. I prefer the bake in the oven cookies. I'd rather clean a cookie sheet than a pot too.

The easiest cookies ever.  My mom used to make something like this when I was a kid, so I thought I would give it a try one night when we wanted cookies but didn't have any chocolate chips.  This is now my wife's favorite cookie!  We have tried them with and without coconut.  I think both are great, although I think the coconut improves the consistency.

I grew up making these, they are so wonderful! These cookies were actually one of my first 4-H fair projects as a kid, and I was so glad to "re-find" the recipe on here! I added two spoonfuls of peanut butter (just how I made them as a kid) and it really adds a great flavor!

This was my first time making no bake cookies. They were very tasty and I would make them again but I thought they were not as good as baked cookies. This recipe is great for summertime when you don’t want to turn on the oven.

I love this recipe. If you want a little more than just chocolate i would recommend adding frappe coffe mix. When i substitute the mix for the cocoa i like to add heath toffe pieces it is AMAZING!

These taste great.  I actually like them better without the coconut...probably because that's how my mom always made them.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I might have rated this better if it wasn't stolen from the side of the cocoa container. They are good, but not so original.

These did not work out at all. They becamse this hard bran-ish consistency. The taste wasn't bad, but it was more sugary than anything. I won't make them again.

Really easy, really quick, and really good!  I found that they tasted better after being refrigerated overnight.  Also, I used more coconut than oatmeal since I was running short and they were still good.

If you let them set up long enough, they aren't gooey. Also, they taste like fudge with some oats thrown in. I think they are great!

They have a good flavor but I did'nt care to much for the texture it was to gooey.
