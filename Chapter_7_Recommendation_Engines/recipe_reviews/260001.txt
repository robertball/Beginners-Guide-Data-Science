This is a really and tasty recipe!
My only suggestion is to let the hibiscus soak the night before and then boil. This will allow it to have a softer texture. You can use the juice that extracted to make Jamaica water.

I used fresh Jamaica flowers this time, because they were available at a local Mexican supermarket. 
 
The only change I made to the recipe, other than soaking the flowers overnight after boiling, was that I added chopped cilantro to the saute. 

So easy to keep vegan or add a crumble of cotija or some crema de avocado.

I served this to a large group, including Mexican nationals,  vegans and meat eaters and EVERYONE LOVED IT!

So simple, so perfect and stunningly delicious.
