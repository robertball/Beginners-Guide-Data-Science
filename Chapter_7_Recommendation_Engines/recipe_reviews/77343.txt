This really turned out well, and was zapped up at the holiday Christmas party. I would recommend doing the following: double the crust and double the chocolate glaze. Othwerwise, there really isn't enough to spread over the whole pan. Also, the glaze comes out with a consistency like fudge. As the recipe states, spread it over the cheesecake while the glaze is still warm (or else it will set just like fudge and you'll be SOL). Use a butter knife to spread the glaze over the warm cheesecake, and then chill the whole thing. Cut up into small squares, as this really is very rich.

I took this into work for my usual "treat day" for my coworkers.  They said it was the best item I've made so far.  I doubled this recipe and it was all gone in just a couple hours.  I recommend trying this for a very rich treat.

I made these for a family picnic, and they were a hit!  I was out of confectioners sugar, so instead of the glaze, I just melted a bag of chocolate chips together with a couple tbs of butter and spread it over the top.

I followed the recipe exactly and these cheesecake bars did not turn out as I had hoped.  All I could taste was the sweetened condensed milk.

These cheesecake bars are delicious.  They are the first cheesecake-type recipe that I have ever made and they are so easy!  They were a hit when I took them to a church gathering and I'm making them again today for my brother's birthday.  I have a feeling I'll be making them a lot!

My family and I agreed this recipe was just ok.  The topping was a little bitter even with the amount of confectioners sugar in it.
