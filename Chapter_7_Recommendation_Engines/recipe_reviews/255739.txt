This cake reminded me of two things, the egg custard pies I used to make for my Grampa and Creme Brûlée.  So, with that being said, the two things I did was add 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract before cooking and torched sugar  on top after.

First off I must say that I am not a baker, I can cook my but off, but baking can be a challenge sometimes because you can't easily add your own twist unless you know the chemistry of baking, which I do not.

This was super easy and quick to make.  I did not stray from the recipe, however I have seen a version that had brandy replace 1/4 cup of the milk, I am thinking of using grand marnier instead.  Stay tuned.

Loved it!  It is a unique custard and cake combination.  The recipe is odd giving such a HUGE window of time it might take to bake. Mine was completely done in 50 minutes. Next time I make it, I will grate in fresh nutmeg and call it an eggnog cake.

I made one little change in the recipe I used mostly almond extract and a little vanilla. Also it said to fold in the flour and that wasn't working so I used my hand mixer to add the flour. If you make this cake don't be discouraged with the batter. It is VERY thin. As I was pouring the batter in the pan I kept thinking this isn't going to work but...I came this far just put it in the oven. Surprise!!  It turned out beautifully and the custard set up and wasn't runny at all. My husband enjoyed a couple pieces with his coffee at work and told me there was somethIng about the cake that made you want to keep coming back for more. I will definitely make this again

This is tasty.  4.5 stars.  Its a simple cake that really did have a custard layer.  I wish there was a video with this, just so I could know exactly what the batter was supposed to look like before it went into the oven.  My egg whites didn't really seem to incorporate well with the mix, but turned out fine in the end.  Only addition I made was half unsweetened Almond milk and half whole milk.

Easy and fast to pull together. As per others, I also used a combination of almond extract (1 tsp) and vanilla extract (1/2) tsp.   The recipe is great. Next time I would definitely consider using rum (or lemon extract with some lemon zest mixed with the flour, or coconut extract with coconut milk for the liquid).  This cake can have several flavor profiles depending on your individual preference.

This was so easy, as others have said, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I had almond milk on hand so substituted that for the cow milk, and also added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. Everyone that tried it absolutely loved it, and my sweetheart enjoyed it so much he asked me to make him a second one a few days later. A winner and a keeper.

This cake came out amazing.  My first time and I got it right. I am a big fan of custard. It was right up my alley. I'm going to have to make another one soon. Every one pigged out on it.

Recently made this. Doubled the recipe. Only modification was a bit more vanilla extract because I LOVE vanilla. 
Topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar.   Everyone loved this.  You will have a sink full of dirty dishes however, after preparation

This sounded to different to pass up...turned out great. Such a strange firm-custard consistency and texture, but really good. I added almond flavoring and then served it with hipped cream and sliced strawberries. Like eating creme brûlée with a fork!

This cake is magic. There were three layers. A sponge cake layer on top, a custard layer in the middle, and a more solid custard layer on the bottom. Delicious

I really like this cake.  Made according to the recipe - no changes.  This is the third time I've made it and still can't get the egg whites to fold in or blend well.  When done, the top is very lumpy whereas the picture shows the top as smooth.  Still tastes great -

I thought it taste really good. It's like a custard inside but not too sweet. It was very easy to make. I will make it again. 
Going to pass this recipe on to my family and friends. FYI...don't try to flip the cake out of the baking dish onto a plate or the top comes off as you can see it happened to me. Keep it in the baking dish. It's only my husband & I so it didn't make a difference. Lesson learned. My husband like the cake also.

This cake came out perfect and is delicious.  I watched the video first, which was really helpful.  I could see how it looked when they folded the stiff egg whites in it.  It cooked for 45 minutes.

I made this amazing cake this rainy, Sunday afternoon, and it made a big hit with everyone in my family! It is SUPER easy to “put together,” and bake. I baked it exactly 1 hour, and it was perfect. The raspberries were a great compliment and lively, colorful garnish. The only alteration I made was that I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract...... More vanilla is always better! This will be a new family favorite and a very nice “take to a sick friend/neighbor” cake.

I just made this cake today, following the directions exactly.  I am a very experienced cook, so I don't think I did anything incorrectly.  However, the cake part was oddly spongy and eggy tasting.  The custard part tasted all right, but overall I didn't like the result at all.  Would not make it again.

The cake looked promising, but the “custard” layer was not liquid whatsoever, and had more of a dry-sponge consistency. On top of that, the cake didn’t really have much flavour, even with the sugar topping. One thing to make it taste better though is whipped cream or ice cream.

This is the strangest cake I’ve ever made.  My family says it’s a cross between haupia and flan in texture but has the flavor of vanilla custard.  It’s really good but different.  I made vanilla cream sauce for mine and added some green food coloring for St. Patrick’s day.  My kids loved it and I really liked it.

I really liked this recipe, but I also love custard. Like others have recommended I added a half a tsp of almond extract. My kids thought it was too eggy so next time I think I will add a pinch of salt to bring out the vanilla and milk flavors and maybe cook at a lower temp for a little longer time to prevent the eggs from curdeling (which I didn't notice anyway).

I made thos tonight because I wanted something sweet and I was interested in how it separated. I used lemon juice and zest instead of vanilla. I could have added more lemon. the only disappointment is the bottom didn't really bake. I baked it for 70 minutes, didn't want to go longer because the top was brown.

I found the custard tasteless.  Definitely  needs something.  Lemon  might  be nice.

This is such an easy cake to make and is absolutely delicious.
I would recommend to everyone to try it. The custard middle was such a surprise to me.

I used this cake as the base for a scientifically accurate layers of the earth/volcano cake for my nerdy science geek of a 6yo Bday cake. It didn’t actually turn out any layers, which I was pretty distressed about initially, but after pouring into my cheesecake pan(the only one big enough to House the bundt “volcano” and still leave a little room for a lava flow) and having it dump out of the sides(oh NO!) and having to pour what was left into a bowl so I could line the compromised pan with foil(4ways)& then place in a roasting pan(thank GOODNESS I did that or I’d have ended up with a GIANT MESS!!) either the layers got distrurbed& sloshed out of existence or they were what was left in the bottom of my roasting pan after nearly 2 HRs of cooking(yeah, I know, the extra layers) my experience was all kindsa cattywompus after the pan leaked, so nobody should base their experience off of mine or be at all apprehensive- this cake was a dream to assemble& the custard that resulted was delicious, tho, yes, a bit “eggy”but with a strawberry lava flow engulfing this layer at the end of the eruption, no egginess was commented on by any attendees to my sons party by adult nor child:) I’m sure it’s a wonderful recipe& look forward to trying it again!

I am definitely not a baker. I live in high-altitude but followed this recipe to the letter without trying to adjust. I agree with one other review that said the egg white didn't fold in too well, but it turned out perfectly after 45 minutes. Will make this Again.

I made this yesterday and although I followed the recipe to a T, it came out gluey and really tough, with no discernible layers at all. I have made other similar cakes, lemon pudding cake and a chocolate one, and they turned out brilliantly. No idea why this one went so wrong.

I attempted to make this with Cup4Cup All Purpose Gluten Free Flour. I typically have positive experiences when turning regular recipes gluten free but not this time. Unfortunately for me there was no magic as you can see in my picture. My family did eat the cake but to mixed reviews, the biggest complaint was the texture. It wasn't cake or custard-y, a bit eggy. The cake did have a mild flavor and could use something more than a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top to help it out.
