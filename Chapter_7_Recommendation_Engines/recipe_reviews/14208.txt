I'm having a ladies luncheon on Saturday. The problem I have is they are all great cooks and have all tried every new recipe. I found this recipe to be something totally different. I know they'll just love it. I never serve anything new until I've tried it first. I have to say that this is wonderful! I increased the amount of dressing as others suggested; and anyone who knows me, knows I just have to add a cup of celery. I also left out the cheese and increased the grapes adding red as well as green. Oh my, how wonderful! I'm excited to have found a recipe that none of my friends have yet! Thanks Allison!PS I used seashell pasta. The shape seems to hold onto the dressing better than other shapes.

FABULOUS RECIPE!  I checked out everyone's recommendations first and then:  doubled the sauce, also added halved grape tomatoes, julienned swiss cheese.  Whatever you do, definitely double the sauce.  YUM!

This was different. I followed everyone elses advice and doubled the dressing ingredients, otherwise it would have been way too dry. I also cut the cheese down to 1 cup, omitted the grapes and added a diced red bell pepper. The dressing has a stong dill taste. I thought it tasted better the  second day. It was a nice change but I won't make this again.

Very good salad.  However, I don't understand why everyone wants to double the sauce.  The recipe calls for 1 3/4 C. of pasta, which is hardly anything at all.  After making the sauce, I realized I would need more pasta and cooked another batch.  It was still plenty moist and I ended up cooking about 12 oz. of pasta.

This salad was awesome!  By far the tastiest pasta salad I have ever attempted.  I noticed that in many of the other reviews, people said they omitted the grapes.  I would highly recommend trying them, because they add a nice sweetness to the mix and really set this salad apart from others.  The pasta shape I used is called Cellentani (I had never noticed it before.  It's hollow like elbow macaroni, but has a long, spiral shape to it).  The one thing I didn't like was the diced cheese - I thought the pieces were too big. Next time, I'll try using shredded or grated cheese.  Thanks, Allison!

This recipe is fabulous! I was skeptical of the grapes, but I'm glad I put them in---they really are tasty.  I made this according to the recipe with the exception of using lemon juice instead of the vinegar (just because I didn't have any cider vinegar) and my guests and family loved it!  I used deli sliced ham that I cut into small bites and I diced the cheddar very small.  I also added carrots and cucumbers for some extra veggies.  This is so good and easy, this is THE pasta salad I'll make from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Made it four times now, we love it.  Vinegar is key, I tried it once with lemon juice instead and it wasn't as good.  Measured generous portions with the dressing, used light mayo and sour cream.  Substituted chicken for ham (Perdue Shortcuts- precooked!) and red for green grapes.  Cut back on green onions, added more dill.  Bought pre-diced cheddar cheese and I'm done in 20 minutes.

Wow after making hundreds of recipes from this website this is my first review. I was not too sure of the combination of this salad, but I was very very surprised that it turned out much better than I had hoped!!!!! I was looking for something to use up some grapes. I never seem to eat grapes after the first time and they always to to waste. So I tried this recipes and I will definately make again. I made it almost as written. My only changes were white vinegar, because I didn't have cidar, and med. cheddar...because of preference. I really think the sauce is what makes it great but also really love the great combination of ingrediance!!! YUM

Very tasty! I used red grapes for color contrast. And in my error I used shredded cheese instead of diced cheese. I think the diced cheese would flow nicer and I will do that next time. The mustard in the dish is really differennt...I liked that surprise very much.

Wonderful flavor combination! Thanks a million - will use frequently! I would like to add that since this was for a large group of people, I made a 1lb box of farfalle, doubled the dressing, and used 1/3 more ham. I personally don't like for any salad to be dripping with dressing and doubling the amount (for me) was perfect for 1 lb of pasta. Also, if you let it sit in fridge overnight, it will absorb a lot of the dressing, so make sure to keep some in reserve to add before serving. Fantastic Allison - everyone loved it!

This is sooo YUMMY!! I did use lemon juice instead of vinegar and added a little extra sugar. I added more ham and cheese and used sea shell pasta. I also doubled the dressing. I loved it and will use it every chance i get. Thanks!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! Creamy yet has a little kick fromt he dijon mustard. So easy, I made it with my baby on my hip!!! ;D I substituted the grapes for raisins, and it worked well, giving the dish a chewy surprise here and there. Yum Yum Yum!!

This is awesome exactly as it is.  I never have used the dill but everthing else is exact and it is soooooo addicting.  I have also changed it up a bit with subbing the grapes for apples and the ham for smoked turkey and adding a little bacon and that is my daughters new favorite salad.  This is a total keeper that I will make time and time again.  I do like to use small shells instead of the farfalle, but that is just personal prefrence.  Try this salad!  Made exactly to the recipe you will not be dissapointed!

We have made this salad now probably 10 times since we first tried it. We make it for ourselves occasionally, but most of the time, family requests it for parties, etc. We are not allowed to bring any other kind of salad now! We make it exactly as called for, although we have noted that there is always extra ham and cheddar left over when the salad is gone. I think you'd be fine halving the ham/cheddar and it would still have plenty. Just a personal preference though. It does have a very unique flavor combination, but we love it! Thanks for a great recipe!

The first time I made this recipe was for a summer get together, and every single person at that party asked for a copy of the recipe! Since then I have made it for every single potluck gathering, and it is a HUGE hit every time. One thing I do differently is substitute lemon juice instead of the vinegar. It takes a little of the "bite" off, but still tastes wonderful!

Perfect!  The grapes really were a neat twist on pasta salad!  I was skeptical, but they ended up being delicious.  This recipe would lend it self to the more 'traditional' pasta salad ingredients as well.  I did double the sauce, but I also used an entire box of small shells too, and it was perfect.

I made this salad because I had some grapes I wanted to use up.  I didn't have quite enough Cheddar, so I put some Swiss in too.  I thought it was a really good salad and it was a nice mix of flavors and textures.  My only complaint was that even in the relatively short time I chilled it, the dressing pretty much got sucked up by the pasta.

I cannot stress how much I enjoy this salad. By far one of the best salad I've done. I make this for parties and people go crazy over it to the point that they ask for the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe!

I like to add some spicy mustard and extra sharp cheddar cheese to this recipe for a little tang!  One of the best pasta salad recipes I've made so far!  Thanks Allison!

This was absolutely delicious. I have made it several times and each time have had a request for the recipe.  I did not change a thing except to double the dressing. After chilling the salad overnight, I add the "extra" dressing to bring it to a nice moistness before serving.

Really unique flavor.  I used 1 T. cider vinegar and 1 T. lemon juice.  I left the sugar in. The dressing was delicious.  I love the grapes....so fresh! I used shredded cheese because that's all I had. I liked it...it was subtle. I did add green onions, but only about 1/4 cup. I waited to add the green onion until right before serving.  I find that green onion left to sit in a salad overnight can be overpowering.

This was a really good pasta salad!  As suggested, I doubled the dressing ingredients except for the dill (only because we're not dill fans).  I made a little extra pasta so we'd have leftovers and reserved 1/2 of the dressing to pour over the pasta salad the next day to suit each person's taste.  Since I didn't have ham, grapes or green onions, I used what we had on hand: 1 can red kidney beans, 1 small can sliced black olives and some chopped hard boiled eggs.  I also added some chopped green pepper but hubby said it didn't fit with the dressing so I won't do that again.  The dressing is really what this recipe is about.  You can play around with the ingredients for the salad but the dressing is great as is.  I'll be making this again.

great recipe! i followed the recipe to a T, except using miracle whip instead of real mayonnaise. it turned out really good. though only downside is that it takes a really, really long time to cut everything up (esp. cheese). i would suggest using shredded cheese instead. oh, and this probably has millions of calories as well...but it's sooo good!! :)

I doubled this salad, and left out the grapes and ham (I didn't have any) and added cut up cucumber, and red pepper. I also shredded my cheese instead of cubing it.  It was delicious, although I don't think I will ever add grapes to it, doesn't seem like it would fit with the salad.  I think that salmon or tuna would compliment the dill, though.  It was very good, stayed relatively moist.  I will definately make this again!

This salad was good, but a little on the bland side for me. Next time, I'll double the spices/herbs and also double the grapes. I thought they were the tastiest part!

This salad was the hit of my party! I did make a couple of adjustments, I reduced the cheese to 1 cup, and I used 3/4 cup of sour cream, and 3/4 of Miracle Whip (which I substituted for the mayo). I also did not add the sugar. Very novel approach to pasta salad for me, and I loved it! Thanks for sharing!

This salad was really very interesting, but good...the sauce was mt favorite part. My husband liked it and rated it "fit to bring to the in-laws." I think the next time I make it I will try shredded cheese and maybe finely diced red onion... just for fun! :) Thanks for a great new salad!

I know I have already submitted a review, but just had to say that I made just the sauce and used it to baste boneless, skinless chicken breasts. It was great, and used the leftovers to dunk the chicken in. YUMMY!

I think that the salad would have tasted better if not left to sit over night, the salad became very dry and tasted a lot like Dill Weed.

I would never have made this if it weren't for the positive reviews... it sounds so wierd! But it WAS really good. 
Based on the reviews, I did the following:
I doubled the sauce, but then did not end up using it all. I reserved about 1 cup of the sauce. I chilled the salad overnight, and added about 1/2 cup of the reserved sauce a couple hours before serving, which really helped with keeping the pasta moist.
I also used 2 cups of pasta, left over Easter ham, 1 T of cidar vinegar and 1 T of lemon juice, and I waited to add the onions and grapes until a few hours before serving. (I quartered my grapes so that my toddler could eat the saiad, and I thought they might dry out otherwise).
All said, it was really good, and the flavors worked suprisingly well together. My husband loved it.
Thanks for all the suggestions!

Absolutely 5 stars. I left out the cider vinegar & the grapes due to personal preference (I added lemon juice instead of the cider vinegar). This recipe is great for work, BBQ's, as a side dish - It is the nicest pasta salad I have ever eaten. Thank you :o)

I like to try new things and this was good but nothing to rave about.  The grapes were a little weird for me I didn't think they went well with the other ingredients in salad....maybe grape tomatoes would have bee a better choice?

Not bad stuff. I improvised on the ingredients.  I didn't use the grapes(sounded weird, not the brave yet).  Also, only had deli ham, so i cut that up, and it worked just fine.  Used shredded mozzerella instead of cheddar.  I didn't have much cheddar left,and needed it for the Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes(found on this site).  The dressing was good stuff!!!  I will be making this again.

Made the pasta salad this morning, the cheese and ham and grapes taste great.  Been chilling for a couple hours now.  Used the recommended amount of sauce though may have used more pasta, ham, cheese, and grapes than the recipe.  It tastes so awesome!!!!  Wow!!!!

Wonderful salad!  I made it for a wedding shower and several asked for the recipe.  I used medium shell pasta, feta cheese instead of cheddar (per previous review), and skipped the onions. I also doubled the dressing as suggested because I like creamier salads. Husband, kids, shower guests all loved it.  Thank you Allison, I will certainly make this again!

I made this for a baby shower I gave, everyone loved it, and a couple women asked for the recipe.  I doubled everything in the recipe, except for the pasta, which I nearl quadrupled, and every last bit was gone.  Grapes were out of season, so I added celery, I also used lemon juice instead of vinegar.  I thought the dressing had a bit too much "wang" so I added some garlic powder.  I refrigerated it for about 5 hours and it turned out great, and there was no need to mix it with more dressing.

This was a very tasty, yet different, pasta salad. My two year-old even liked it.  I thought that the grapes added an unexpected flavor, that was really good. I doubled the amount of dressing, and did not add the sugar. I will make this salad again.

This was very tasty.  I used lots of fresh dill and apple instead of grapes.  However, there isn't enough pasta in the recipe for my taste so next time will use more pasta and decrease the amount of cheese maybe.

Very Good Salad! What a nice change from ordinary macaroni salad. The sauce makes this salad. Don't be skeptical of the grapes as I was. It makes the salad. Also made this a second time and used chunk pineapple. Very good! Thanks for the wonderful new addition to our family's recipe rotation.

I loved the dressing for this salad! I didn't make any changes to the dressing, and I wouldn't to make it again. I did make some changes to the salad itself though. I used whole wheat bow tie pasta and I found that 1 3/4 cups of pasta was not nearly enough for the amount of dressing. I made probably 2 1/2 to 3 cups and still could have used more. Next time, I'll just use a whole package. I also left out the cheese, ham and grapes and used: 1 stalk celery, 1/4 of a red and yellow pepper, 1/4 of a cucumber, 1/2 of a carrot shredded and only a couple of green onions. For a more complete lunch, I added some chicken. It turned out great - I'll definitely make this one again!

I really liked this recipe.  I did add celery for the crunch.  I used red wine vinegar because thats what I had abd ditto for red grapes.   I think this recipe could be played with to make almost anyone happy.  I will make it again. Thanks a bunch!

This salad is amazing. I copied it down and took forever to try it, but am so glad I did. I substitute cooked chicken, pork, or beef for ham. And last night I substituted drained pineapple chunks for the grapes, and it was marvelous! I add a little more mustard, and use coarse ground mustard. This recipe is so versatile and delicious!!!

I made the recipe exactly minus the cheese. I usually won't rate recipes if I don't make them exactly because I feel like you aren't actually tasting the real recipe. However, since the only problem I had with this recipe is that it was too rich and I don't think the cheese would have made it less rich I decided to put my two cents in. I made it the night before and only used half the sauce as it makes alot of sauce. I added the rest right before I served it. My guests loved the first ten or so bites, but quickly got sick of the taste. I was able to eat seconds later in the evening but by the next day I couldn't even look at it. Don't leave out the grapes, it is a refreshing part of the taste.

I am sure this recipe would be great as is. I changed to chicken instead of ham and red grapes instead of green as I am not a big fan of ham. I used 3/4 teaspoon of dill as I like the flavor. For 2 cups of chicken instead of ham I used 2 chicken breasts, skinned breasts, salt and peppered them and wrapped in foil so they would not dry out as I cooked them. 1 hour at 400 degrees if on bone is about cook time. I cooked 4 breasts and used the other 2 to make another chicken salad later in the week. You can figure you get about a cup of chicken out of each breast. Great recipe will make this for future get togethers.

I dont know what I did wrong!? The reviews were great! It had too much mayo for me, and not enough taste, but my husband ate it right out of the bowl while watching tv! Mayo made me too greasy tasting.

Based on the other reviewers suggestions, I too used lemon juice, added celery, and because I'm veg omitted the ham. It was pretty good at the time, but I got sick of the flavor pretty quickly - there was something odd about it. I added a can of tuna to the leftovers the next day, and I enjoyed that combination. I probably won't make this again, however. It was unique but not thrilling.

I omitted the grapes and ham and just added my own ingredients. I used rotini pasta instead of farfalle. However, it did turn out to be a very dry pasta salad after chilling. But I used the dressing for potato salad and it worked out great!! Thanks Allison!!

I have to say, I am REALLY surprised at all the positive reviews.  I had to throw this away, and it was a big bummer because you have to buy and use a lot of stuff in it.  The vinegar was overwhelming, it just tasted BAD.  I tried to make sure I got a bite with everything and it still was just...bad.  I followed the recipe exactly...definetly not for me.

I loved the dressing, and will try using it with other recipes as well. I like grapes in pasta salad, but my husband doesn't, so they may not be for everyone. I used a little extra pasta, and substituted chicken for the ham because my husband doesn't like ham. Tasty and easy. We liked this one.

This salad was weird.  There were too many different flavours going on.  I didn't like it at all, my husband thought it was interesting. I ground some up and the baby loved it.  I will not make again.

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ and it was a huge hit with the kids (4 and younger).  The chunks of ham, cheese and grapes made great finger food.  I even missed the part about mixing the dressing separately and just threw it all in together and it turned out great.  All of the guests asked me for the recipe!

Made this for my daughter's first birthday and one of the guests requested it for a gathering at his house.  I use small bowties and about 1/2 cup less than the recipe calls for. I also add a little extra mustard for added kick.

This unique cast of characters makes a STAND OUT pasta salad!  I'm not a big fan of the same old same old, so I was intrigued when I re-discovered this going through my recipe box (apparently, I added it YEARS ago).  I finally made it today and it's delicious!  I did add some more veggies to use some of what I had on hand, but the base is the same.  I use light mayo w/olive oil and light sour cream for the dressing.   We're also out of cider vinegar, so I used white, and I used yellow mustard in lieu of dijon per personal preference.  I used all of the ingredients in the recipe, in addition to:  shredded carrots, diced cucumbers, diced red bell pepper, chopped broccoli, and chopped banana peppers (I also added a splash of banana pepper juice to the dressing!).  I used red grapes instead of green because the selection was better at the grocery store and I used mini sea shell pasta (measuring it to be 1 3/4 cups) because it caught my eye.  I used a good aged cheddar and it does make a difference.  DON'T LEAVE OUT THE GRAPES; they really help make the salad.  It works; trust me, it works...THANKS BONGOBABE!

I made this salad tonight to go alongside some ribs and I'm giving it 4 stars, but I think with one minor change, it could be 5 stars.  I did make some changes; I used 5 slices of crisp, cooked bacon in place of the ham (could have used 6 or 7 though), cubed mozzarella cheese in place of the cheddar (won't do this again), and added a bit of red onion along with the green (I didn't have quite enough green).  I will make this again, but next time I will reduce the Dijon mustard down to 1 tsp as the amount called for was overwhelming and we could taste very little else.

This was good; I don't know if it was spectaular, but it was a nice change.  I did increase the amount of dressing a bit, although not quite doubled.  I also increased the amount of dill (because I love it!) and I used less vinegar, along with some lemon juice, which gave this a great fresh flavor.  The combination of ham, grapes, cheese and green onions was a good one.  All in all, a very good recipe and I will probably make it again sometime.

I had to make a couple of changes.  My son hates mayo so I used salad dressing instead.  I also did not have any dijon mustard on hand.  I replaced that with hot mustard.  Doubled sauce and used a 12 oz box of penne (not sure what that measures out to cup wise)  and tossed in some croutons.  I didn't have a drop of sauce left over.  Didn't have any pasta left over either after hubby had seconds!  Perfect summertime recipe.  Thanks!!

This was just okay. I followed the recipe as written, and ended up with a lot of extra sauce, I am glad that I did not double it. I found that the sauce tasted too much like mayo and it just did nothing for me. My boyfriend liked this okay, but I won't be making it again. This was too rich for a pasta salad it seemed like. I like my pasta salad refreshing and light, and this was neither of those things.

I used bow-tie pasta, red seedless grapes & decreased the cheese tremendously (I only had about 1/2 cup of a shredded mexican blend... (colby, cheddar & jack I think). I had plenty of dressing...probably due to the decrease in cheese. I thought the bites w/out the grapes were just so-so...but if you get a bite that contains all the elements of the recipe....YUMMM! I did think it was best just slightly chilled...the flavors come through more. Thanks Allison!

I just made the dressing of this recipe for a pasta salad I was making so I'm just rating the dressing not the whole recipe.  I found that it didn't have quite enough flavor.  I added about 1 tsp more dillweed and sqeezed in some lemon juice to brighten the flavor.  I liked cutting the mayo with the sour cream it sure lightened it up!  Not bad with the tweaking I made!

Delicious and easy!  I was a little skeptical about the grapes, but they really made the salad.  Don't leave them out!  I left out the cheese because I thought it might be too heavy, and didn't have any dill, but it was still excellent.  I used with light mayonnaise and fat-free sour cream, and it still tastes rich and creamy.  My husband really liked it too.

The dressing on this salad is awesome.  I didn't have dillweed and didn't put in the pepper and used yellow mustard and it still tasted great!  I only added carrots and onion, I didn't have ham or cheese or grapes.  Really good salad.

This was definitely a different pasta salad, which my husband and son really loved.  I thought the dressing was a bit heavy, though, especially with the addition of the cheddar cheese cubes to the salad, but the taste was unique.  I may use shredded cheddar next time just to lighten up the consistency a bit. Don't leave out the grapes, as some reviewers suggested; they truly complement the dressing, which, by itself could have been a little bitter.  The grapes create a nice blend--especially with the ham. I omitted the onions, and  I used an entire box of farfalle pasta and doubled the dressing, as I was making this for a crowd.  I added lots of extra grapes and ham, as well.  I'll bet it would be great with crumbled bacon instead of ham....Next time.

this doesn't really make that much pasta and makes a lot of sauce (i would not say it makes 8 servings!!, more like 2-3, though it was used as a sidedish), though it does thicken up when put in the fridge to cool so the big amount of sauce turned out to be a good thing.  doubled the pasta and used 1 1/2 of the sauce.  i also used whatever veggies i wanted in there (minus the grapes and green onions as i'm not a big fan and neither is my partner) and a lot less cheese than what it called for.  also added a lot more pepper to give it some more flavor as i think it lacked a little bit the way it was.  it was great with bbq chicken breast.  will definitly be making again.  if you want something more subtle and plainer and simple this is a great recipe.

I too used seashell pasta and also added some chopped celery and green peppers for some additional texture, taste and substance. The dressing was a bit too much for me but we enjoyed this pasta and will keep it around for get-togethers and summer events. Thanks Allison.

This pasta salad is good, but I didn't care much for the ham. The dressing is good, very similar to the dressing I make for potato salad. I will make this again, only next time I might use leftover turkey instead of the ham and dried cranberries in place of the grapes. I also think it would be better with shredded cheese instead of diced. It does taste better after being refrigerated overnight. Next time I will plan ahead and make it the day before I want to serve it.

I made this for a luncheon and it was just okay.  Way too much cheese and dressing and the dressing needs a kick.  Maybe I missed something, but this one won't be a keeper.

This recipe is excellent!  My family raved about it the whole time we were eating it.  It's a good mix of flavors with the grapes, dressing, and meat and cheese.

I LOVED THIS!!! This was the best pasta salad I have made in years! I brought this to Thanksgiving with the in-laws and everyone loved it! The only thing I will change next time is I will used shredded cheddar instead of cubed. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is looking for a new side dish with a twist! WOW!

AWESOME salad.  I added a couple of ingredients like rainbow shreds to the mixture and made the dressing first and did not let marinate as long as it said and my party ate it up.

My coworker highly recommended this recipe. After making it for a Fourth of July party, I've been asked for a copy of this recipe 10 or more times.  I look forward to warm summer days to enjoy this cold pasta at our next poolside party.  The flavors of the ham and grapes make a perfect blend.  Great recipe!

This was good with the omission of grapes.  I think next time I will use chunks of american cheese instead of cheddar, just  a personal preference. I also might make a little more dressing because it seemed kind of dry.  The dressing for this is very similar to a recipe I love that is served at Souper!Salads Restaurants.  Thiers uses ribbon pasta and whole kernel corn.

I love the flavor of this recipe.  I use crumbled bacon instead of ham and half the amount of cheese.  It is a great salad that you can keep in the fridge and have as a quick snack.

I was looking for a pasta salad to make for our thanksgiving dinner this year and after trying other recipes with grapes (yes, suggest seedless red grapes) this is the one.  I agree tweaking the dressing a bit w/lemon juice and a little celery salt.  How can you go wrong adding cheese and ham.  Come on  :)

I can normally tell what to expect from a recipe by reading the reviews, but the reviews for this are all over the place!  A lot of people doubled the sauce, but some people said that there was too much, so I wasn't sure what to do.  I ended up increasing the sauce but not quite doubling it, and I still thought the salad was a bit dry after refrigerating for a few hours.  I added a few tablespoons of milk to moisten it up.  I used fat free mayo and light sour cream to reduce the fat and used chicken instead of ham because of my own preference, but other than that I tried to stick to the recipe pretty closely.  I thought it tasted okay, but you have to make sure that you have a grape in every bite.  It's mediocre without the grapes.  I wouldn't count on serving 8 people with this unless the people are small eaters.  I doubt I'll make this salad again.

I just loved this recipe. My family loved it, too and now I am busy sending it to my brother and my mother.
I changed few things though since I didn't have all the ingredients and couldn't wait for the next trip to the store. I used smoked pork loin instead of the ham and regular mustard instead of Dijon mustard and skipped the grapes.
We all liked it so much we took it on a picnic the next day. We are also going to use the same dressing for potato salad.
Thanks for the recipe, Alisson.

Regards,

Nicoleta

The only thing you have to do differently is to double the sauce. Perfection! (I did boil more pasta and added as I saw fit.) Do not skimp on the grapes. The dill makes this dish.

I love it!!!!!! I was looking for some good pasta salad that had my name in it and i found this... i made it and ate it. It was delicious! I didn't change a thing. When i first made it, i made it in a small portion and it was gone in 1 minute.  Since my family and I were going on vacation and had a long car trip i made this to eat in the car as lunch. I made 16 serving and it was gone after lunch and diner.   My family and I LOVE this recipe!!!! :D

I just needed a simple pasta salad dressing. i like creamy pasta but with an italian flavor...so I mixed this recipe with Antipasto Pasta Salad by Dayna. Both recipes were very good on their own but excellent together..I tossed with cheese tortellini and broccoli.

I’ve been making this recipe for years! I love this salad as does everyone else that I’ve ever served it to! I make this as is with the exception of the kind of grapes. I used to always make it with the green grapes but one time the store’s green grapes looked awful so I opted for the red ones. Now that’s all I ever use, it makes a better presentation. I can’t believe some people are making this without the grapes; I was skeptical the first time too, but the combination of all these ingredients is literally a flavor explosion in your mouth!

I made this as noted but I used the whole 1lb box of Mini Farfalle and probably cut up a bit more cheese, onions and grapes. The pre-diced ham is exactly 2 cups (16oz) so that was perfect. Just the right amount when done for a big potluck! Thanks for the recipe, I will for sure make this again.

Really good. I followed the advice of others and doubled the dressing.  I used champagne vinegar, as that is what I had on hand, and fresh dill rather than dried.  For veg I used cucumbers, red peppers, green onions, peas, and some pickled roasted peppers. The dijon adds a nice, subtle heat.

My whole family enjoyed this, even the kids.  I did use 12 oz of elbow macaroni and then doubled the dressing.  I cannot imagine doubling the dressing with only 1 3/4 cups of pasta.  It would be swimming in it!  I left out the cheese due to some allergies and kept all the other ingredients the same.  I did slice the grapes too.  Really tangy and delicious!

This is one outstanding pasta salad!! I have been making this for the past three years and it is a family favorite.  I did tweak a few ingredients over the years based on personal preference.  I omitted salt and cheese from the recipe but added 1/4 cup of celery and 3/4 cup of thawed frozen peas.  I also use seedless Red grapes and small shell pasta.  The dressing for this salad is sublime and I never found the need to double it.  However, I do need to double the entire recipe because it disappears FAST. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!
