Made using 10 carrots laid out whole on a cookie sheet lined with foil.  Needed foil - what a mess - but easy cleanup w/foil.  Used no pepper and very little salt.  Extremely mild carrot flavor; reminded me of baked sweet potato fries.  Still LOOKS like carrots so kids are reluctant to try - however, they can down them without making faces.  Will make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! Easy and tasty. I'll definitely make this again. I wish I took another reviewer's advice and lined my dish with foil - it makes a dark brown mess in the pan. But I used baking soda and my sponge and it rubbed right off!

These were DElicious!  Because they're left whole it takes a while to cook...so next time I'll cut them down to more uniform cuts for faster cooking- or maybe use baby carrots instead.  My 6 yr old said they were his "favorite" and actually bartered for more?!?  They are awesome!

I grew up with my mom making these and I love them.  I throw the carrots, olive oil, salt and pepper in a ziploc bag and give them a shake.  I throw them in a "Le Creuset" dish and dizzle honey on top.

Very good but I would suggest turning carrots halfway through baking, mine were a little too dark on the bottom.

Simple and delicious.  I've made this with the regular grocery store carrots and some little sweet baby carrots from our local farmers market and both attempts were delicious.  I'm trying to move to a healthier style of cooking and get the family to associate healthy with delicious.  Thanks for providing a recipe that was a great help with this!  I will be making this one often.  It's lovely as is, though one time I put some fresh thyme on it and that was great too.

SOOO GOOD!  I used baby carrots.  These carrots went perfect with the "Simple Slow Roast Chicken" I was baking.  As I had the chicken already in the oven, I partially cooked the carrots then drizzled with olive oil and honey.  I, too, am guilty of not measuring which makes this recipe very easy.   I put the carrots in the oven (which was set at 250 degrees) for the last 2 hours of baking the chicken.  Thank you FrackFamily5 for sharing your recipe!  We really had a FrackFamily5 dinner that was very yummy!!

I used a pound of organic baby cut carrots and cut each one in half.  Since my carrots were already very sweet, I used about half the honey, and I also sprinkled a little sherry vinegar over the mixture...just a few drops.  I roasted them at 400 degrees on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper for 30 minutes or so then turned the heat to 425 for another few minutes.  They were lightly browned and delicious!  I do think that 350 is a bit too low for cooking if you want them browned, so take note of your temp if you want them caramelized.  And don't crowd them too much.  Cooked this way, I loved these, and I'm already planning to head back to the store within the next day or so for more carrots!

Made this tonight as a side for pork chops. My 4yr old and 1 yr old loved them! It was just the three of us, so I only used 4 carrots and drizzled with olive oil and local fresh honey. Yum Yum! I also cut the carrots in thirds. It was perfectly cooked in 40 minutes. We will definitely have these again!

So simple and so delicious!  I did line my pan with Reynolds non-stick foil for easy clean-up.  This is a great way to liven up carrots and the roasting along with the sweetness made this a wonderful side dish.  Thanks for a very easy yet very tasty recipe FrackFamily5!

What an easy and tasty way to prepare what could be a boring vegetable for a side dish! I agree that the mixture should be mixed in a ziploc & foil should be used on your pan for easy clean-up. But the recipe followed exactly comes out delicious.

Can you have carrots for dessert? That's how delicious these were! I made a pound bag (which is about 8) and couldn't stop eating them! As other reviewers have noted... make sure you line your baking dish with foil! (I gave the foil a spray with a non-stick cooking spray as a little insurance.) I'll be making this again soon, and double the amount! THANK YOU!

I used baby carrots and cooked it at a slightly higher temp (400).  They were perfect in 20 minutes.  I love the flavor combo of the honey, salt and pepper.  For me. the honey didn't overwhelm the carrot flavor at all.

I've made this recipe many times and it's excellent!!  So delicious and so easy!!  I've used this recipe for company and family dinners as well.  My favorite is to use with baby carrots from the farmer's market.

Oh these were absolutely wonderful!  I had a million different things going on, so I had to adapt to my pantry & kitchen and a) used baby carrots, b) eyeballed olive oil & honey, and c) roasted at 400 for 25 minutes.  They were simply to die for - I could have eatten an entire bag of them.  Thanks for recipe!

I cut the carrots in half length-wise & used half the honey.  Sprinkled with Himalayan Sea Salt and lots of coarse ground pepper.  They still needed a full hour in the oven. The kids wanted seconds! Be sure to cook on tinfoil as it can get sticky if they are cooked long enough to be delicious.

I used a lot less oil and honey and lined my pan with foil.  I cut up my carrots to cut down on cooking time and found they were ready in about 20 min.

I had tried this recipe previously and thought it was quick and easy but average.  This time I used a little less oil and a little more honey.  I also  sliced the carrots legnthwise and baked it on a foil lined cookie sheet.  More of the roasted carrot flavor came out making a great side dish.

This is so easy and so delicious!!  I dumped a 1-lb bag of baby carrots in a large Ziploc bag, eyeballed the olive oil added to the bag, shook it until all the carrots were coated, spread them out on a foil-lined cookie sheet, lightly salted and peppered the carrots, then drizzled raw honey over them, making sure that each carrot had some honey on it.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes, stirred the carrots, then baked for another 20 minutes, and they came out PERFECT!  I will be making this regularly from now on.  Thank you for the recipe!!

WOW!!!
These are the BOMB!! . They were so easy to make. You'll love the sweet and the savory at the same time. I did add a little water like 1/4 cup in with the oil & syrup. It made the perfect steaming. You can also make this with canola oil. I had no olive oil on me. Also I only used 6  carrots Still the carrots were sweet and soft.  This will become my special side dish to come.  Like who needs frozen carrots...

I quartered the carrots and thought they were delicious.  I lined the pan with foil and there was more liquid than I expected.  I could have used more carrots.

Mmmm.....I love roasted carrots!! This was really good, but the honey all seemed to stick to the bottom of the pan and you couldn't taste it very much. Next time I will make sure and add extra honey. Otherwise, perfect!! Thanks for sharing:)

so easy and delicious! the first time I made it with whole carrots, which took a looong time to bake completely through. the second time I cut the carrots into small slices, which decreased cooking time but kept them delicious! this is a really simple dish and my go-to when needing to add some vegetables to a meal. I've actually made this dish multiple, multiple times! I love soft carrots, so I bake for the full one hour and cover the top of the pan with foil so the carrots stay plump. I definitely recommend covering the top of the pan to keep the nice orange color.

Made this for the first time tonight and everyone raved over them!  I made them just as the recipe dictated, baking them for 54 minutes total.  They turned out sweet and a bit caramelized, just like I like them.  I would definitely line your baking pan with foil, as clean up for this recipe would be pretty difficult without it!

This is just what I was looking for.  The carrots were tender, sweet, and delicious!  I added a little allspice to make them similar to a recipe I do on the cooktop.  These carrots were just as good, and SO much easier!

This was a good tasting recipe.  I had problems with the carrots not cooking evenly due to size.  Cooking in foil is a must as well as stirring a few times during the cooking process.

I have a large family very reluctant to change and I made these for Easter. It is now Fathers Day and I got the call a week in advance requesting these carrots....Kids loved them, grandparents loved them and my mother wont stop talking about it. I used Kosher Salt and fresh cracked pepper and they came out perfectly!....Thanks for this recipe it is now a new Family Favorite! :)

Served this for Easter dinner. 1 day ahead I put the carrots in a zip lock and added olive oil. Tossed, then added honey into ziplock and flipped to coat periodically until the next day. Thus was a real time saver on Easter Sunday. I also left a little greenery on the ends for show.

I like to cut my carrots on an angle, in about 5 pieces per carrot, rather than leaving them whole. I don't add the honey until they're done. I've found the honey burns easily, and honestly, I love them even without it. But my kids and hubs love the honey flavor. These will be on my Thanksgiving menu this year. Roasted, then drizzled with honey butter. Yum.

I made this  with a 1 lb bag of baby carrots and it was wonderful!! A touch of sweetness from both the carrots and honey.  I sprinkled nutmeg over the vegetable before baking. A little more honey next time just to increase the glaze would be the only thing I might try next time.

These were so GOOD! While looking for a new way to try carrots for dinner I stumbled upon this, simple, easy and oh so delish! Even my husband said how good they were. I used whole peeled carrots and I did line the pan with foil, highly suggested unless you feel like scrubbing later. Just the right amount of carrot/sweet/savory  ratio. Will be making this again :)

I love these carrots.  I am always asked to bring them to family and friends pot lucks.  There is one thing I due different over the holidays is add a little orange zeat finely chopped before baking.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I did cheat though and broiled them for 15 minutes instead of baking them, because I was broiling a steak anyway. It made a nice quick side dish. The honey is a little strong, but I also don't care for too much honey in recipes anyway. I made 1/2 recipe and it worked great. Thank you!

Super easy and super tasty!  Line the pan with foil - makes for easier clean up.  Added some parsnips with the carrots.  Drizzled the honey on top of the veg.  Kids loved it.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Just perfect! I didn't measure the olive oil or honey, just drizzled it over the carrots and roasted for about 45 minutes. I love roasted veggies and thought the honey added a nice subtle sweetness to the carrots.

I made this as  one of our Thanksgiving side-dishes and used the organic multi-colored carrots.  They came out  really well and  I got a lot of compliments on them.  The honey did burn a bit in the pan, so lining the pan with foil is a great idea.  I will definitely be making these again.

Made this for Easter... Delicious!  And so easy.  This recipe is a keeper. I lined a sheet pan with foil, sprayed it with Pam, trimmed carrots and tossed with oil, S&P, then drizzled the honey.  So pretty when you use fresh thin carrots with just a little of the green top left on...

A yammy way to serve cooked carrots. I lined my pan with parchment paper to avoid burnt-on honey. I will definitely slice carrots in half next time. Thanks!

I rarely cook carrots, so this was kind of new to me. I made it exactly as written, and the results were decent, but nothing spectacular. I used a baking time of 50 minutes, but even more might've been nice. I might make this again sometime, since it's so easy.

I cut up the carrots a little smaller to reduce cooking time, and added just a tiny bit of ginger.  I really enjoyed them, but my husband thought they were a little bit too sweet.

The flavor on these carrots was delicious.  I added a touch more honey, and since I was short on time, finished them up at 425.  They came out perfectly!

Used baby carrots & put in 400 degree oven for 30 min while fish was cooking. Still quite crunchy. Good flavor, but quite watery. Expected carrots to caramelize a little, but they didn't.

I didn't find the honey flavor very strong. However, they cooked over nicely in about an hour. I would maybe try cutting these in half next time to make them cook quicker.

We liked this! Since I have a toddler I cut the carrots up into bite sized pieces prior to baking, and I tossed them with the other ingredients in a bowl vs drizzling for good coverage. I would definitely make this again!

This was super easy and delicious!  I had about 3 pounds of carrots.  After they were peeled, I cut them into thirds and put them into my glass 13x9 that I had sprayed with baking spray.  I'm an "eyeballer" cook, so I drizzled enough olive oil until it looked right.  Sprinkled with salt & pepper.  Tossed this around.  Then I drizzled honey until it looked like enough.  Tossed this around.  Baked in oven uncovered during last 1-1/2 hours (stirred around halfway through) of my chicken roasting.  Came out perfectly, with a mildly sweet accent from the honey.  This was great because I have adult children that are picky about eating anything different from what they are used to, and they ate with no complaints.  I didn't have problems with any stickiness in my pan, because it created more of a thin sauce and the baking spray helps too.

This was really good!  My husband and I don't like cooked carrots but had a bunch of carrots we needed to use so I tried this recipe and we both liked it a lot.  It was very easy which was one of the reasons I chose it.  I used baby carrots instead of whole ones so all I had to do was coat them with the mixture.  I cooked them for 40 min.

Cutt carrots to baby carrot size, baking at 400 degrees for 20 mins. Perfect. No need for a silly ziploc bag! I tossed in oil first then honey. next time will try tossing in oil then drizzling on honey.

A delicious way to serve carrots. We served these with spicy grilled chicken and potatoes; the flavours were divine together. I cut the carrots in fourths to speed up the cooking time. Thank youFrackFamily5 for sharing this recipe.

Loved them! I used this recipe last year when I made my first thanksgiving dinner. I slightly modified the recipe though, in that I partially cooked them in a countertop (Nuwave) oven and then put them in with the turkey (since I had run out of space to cook everything). Turned out wonderfully, my family was SOO impressed!

I've made these twice recently and they're not only super tasty...but easy.  I shake the pan two - three times while they're cooking to ensure even heat.  My carrots were kind of on the thinner side (probably due to buying them in February in Northern Michigan), so they only took about 35 minutes.

Tried this for the first time and it was a hit!  Threw in some chopped pecans, used half the olive oil, and threw in 1 tbsp. agave.  Will definitely be doing this again!

Simple, Easy, So..Tastey!  
To make it even easier, I used baby carrots from the grocery store.  
Put all the ingredients in a ziploc bag (as someone else suggested)
Even my carrot hating members of my family enjoyed them.  The sweetness from the honey makes it almost taste like a delicious sweet potato. Be sure to make more than you think.  The carrots shrink a bit and it is a lot less when everyone is eating them. This is a staple in our home.

Used 1 lb of carrots and peeled and cut into carrot sticks and cooked 45 minutes.  The sauce was very liquidy so not sure why others had issues with a hard-to-clean pan.  Probably could have used more carrots for the amount of sauce but very good and will make again.  When I asked my husband if it was a keeper he said "OH MY GOSH, YES".

These are very good. Baking time was perfect. I had about 10 whole thin organic carrots left whole. A bit different then the butter, brown sugar glazed carrots I serve often.

Mmm.  These carrots were yummy!  I will make again for sure but maybe a little less honey.  I used a  non-stick metal cake pan and did not have any issues with sticking.

I thought these were very good.  I did cut the carrots in chunks and just eyeballed the olive oil and honey.  Added a little salt and pepper.  The were done in about 30 minutes.  My husband even liked them - and he's Mr. Plain when it comes to food - strictly plain!

This was SO GOOD! I made it for my boyfriend and I and it turned out better than I thought it would! I went a little light on honey and it tasted just fine. Such a simple but delicious recipe.

Had this as part of Christmas dinner. It added color to the menu and had just the right amount of sweetness. One of three of my picky eaters liked it so I consider this as a win. Hubby and I thought that the side dish was great. Followed the recipe and I definitely will make again!

My grandson & daughter-in-law who don’t really care for carrots loved this!  I used maple syrup instead of honey. This is definitely a keeper.  I do wish I had made two pounds instead of just one!

I added a tiny bit of Orange zest and juice. It was ok, but took it to a potluck with 40 people and brought home 3/4 of it.  No reason to try again.

The only bad thing about this dish is that I didn’t make enough of it - no seconds available for the 6 of us.  Definitely use the foil and turn them over as needed.  Use thin carrots or cut the thicker parts in half so they are all uniform.  Delicious!

Yummm!  I don't usually like carrots but these were great!  My daughter said I should make them again.  I increased the oven temp to 400 because I was cooking them with another dish.  I won't do that again.  Flavor was great.  Will make them again.

My family LOVED this!! (Even my toddler who professed not to like carrots asked for seconds). I combined baby carrots, oil, salt/pepper in a plastic bag and shook to coat, then dumped in a foil lined baking dish and eyeball drizzled the honey, making sure to hit each piece. I then popped in the oven and it took close to an hour, but the result is perfection! If my kids will eat it, I will make it - and this is definitely on the make again list! Thanks for such a quick, easy, well-loved veggie dish!!!

The problem was they took MUCH longer to cook than stated.  So I couldn't serve them with my Easter dinner.  But after I microwaved them for 5 minutes AND put them back in the oven for 20 minutes they were delicious.

These were just ok. I’m not sure what the fuss was about. They tasted like cooked carrots with a little bit of honey. I think it calls for two much olive oil. Maybe that had something to do with it. I don’t plan to make them again.

While carrots needed more than 40 minutes but less than 55 might put foil over (loosely) should I make again to avoid the appearance of the carrots drying out.

Better to add honey after roasting. But then you don’t really need it because of the sweetness of the carrots.

Easy and everyone loves them. You can put them in at lower temps if you’re baking other things in the oven and then finish them off at the higher temperature.

I’ve made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe and they got too done. They carmelized and had hard spots. Tasty enough, we ate them anyway. The second time, I cut the heat by 50 degrees, and didn’t add the honey until the last twenty minutes of roasting time. They came out perfect and were gone in minutes to rave reviews. Since ovens vary, you just have to tweak this to your liking. Good recipe!

I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 because my carrots took much longer to cook than the recipe suggested. I took them out after an hour, and there were still very firm. That being said, it's possible the oven I was using is not heating properly (my roast was also a tad underdone), and once I cooked the carrots sufficiently, everyone loved them!

These are delicious! I follow the recipe exactly. Since I’m cooking for 6 and we’re big veggie eaters, I tend to triple the recipe. Making these again tonight to go with a nice leg of lamb. I think they’ll provide a nice contrast to the mustard glaze on the meat.

Hubby almost ate them all before I could get any.  We did baby carrots instead of whole so I adjusted the oil and honey a bit and added a pinch of cayenne.

Since Honey is so sticky and hard to clean the dish, I put everything in aluminum foil.  Sealed the foil and contained the mess.  These were excellent and will keep making them.  So good!

DIdn't have Honey so I used Molasses.  Worked out great.  My 2 year old loved them.  I also added a little garlic as well.

Also I used Baby Carrots instead of whole ones.

I personally loved these carrots! However I made them for my daughter and she maybe ate two. I will continue to try to make them for her with tweaks to the recipe. She loves the sweet carrots grandma airways gets her at Cracker Barrel so I'm determined to find some home cooked version she'll love.

Turned out well!! I cut the carrots into fourths so they cooked quicker and easier to eat. Really couldn't taste the honey at all so I'm going to try another flavor next time. But it's def a different take on vegetables.

I cut carrots in half length wise, used avacado oil instead & added Garlic salt. I also roasted zucchini & yellow squash for 1/3 time. Mixed all together & served. Everyone was asking me for the recipe! Yum!!!

Probably should have been 375, gone for longer, or MUCH less honey in the mix. Mine turned out soupy and barely roasted. I may try again, but carrots are so sweet on their own I'm not sure why the honey was necessary. A good, roasted carrot should be tasty enough...

Made this with baby carrots in a clay roaster.  (Romertoptf).  Cleanup was not a problem and they were very good.  Served with a prime rib roast for a holiday dinner and it was well liked.

I just made these to take to Christmas Eve dinner and while I have only taken a taste of the finished product, I had to write my review before I forgot.  Please keep in mind that I am not a fan of carrots, never have been.  These were outstanding!  I used baby carrots, as that is what I had on hand, and I put the carrots, oil, salt and pepper into a ziploc bag and mixed it all together good.  Discovered that I was out of foil, so I used parchment paper to try and minimize the clean up.  I am sure these will be a hit tonight!  I will definitely add these to my rotation of side dishes!

Great recipe! Simple and brings out a sweetness in the carrots. I added a dash of chipotle powder and cinnamon, which  added a bit of a kick. Per another user, I turned to carrots a couple times, and since mine were large, I roasted them a bit longer than an hour. I agree with other people who commented that the honey didn't seem to add much; for me it had cooked off in the hour roasting time. Next time might add a bit of honey melted with butter and pour it on when serving.

The taste of these was nice, and it certainly was an easy recipe, but next time I'll flip them over halfway through, as the bottoms got a little burnt.

I made some changes that worked well. For starters I split larger carrots in half leaving some leaves on. Second I added small onions with green tops. Third I replaced honey with a balsamic reduction that worked wonderfully. It was easy ellagent and is sure to return in my regular line up.

I cut the carrots up in large pieces; used a lined pan.  I initially tossed the carrots in olive oil in a bowl then laid in a pan.  I sprinkled salt and pepper on them and drizzled with honey.  Just enough to give them a touch of sweetness, but they were still savory.  They really shrank quite a bit in the oven.  Next time I'll make more.

Honey Roasted Carrots Haiku: "Thanks Frack Family! This made carrots so yummy! And the kids agree." One of the reviews suggested doing these carrots for a longer time at a lower temp, and since I was roasting a chicken at 250 for 5 hrs., I put the carrots in the oven for the last 2.5 hrs. They were delicious! The leftovers went into a chicken stir-fry the next day and were even better!

Used baby carrots.... took about twice the time to cook because I mixed it all in a round casserole dish to bake it in.  Sweet and delicious.  I think the honey could be cut down a bit if you're watching sugar/calories.

This is a great side dish. I tossed some white honey balsamic vinaigrette in with the regular honey and it add a nice tan to the carrots..roasted them on 400 degrees for almost an hour and they still weren't as soft as I'd like them to be so I turned it up to 425. Next time I'll leave it on 425 for 45minutes. Great flavor though and very tasty and sweet.

the absolute best roasted carrots have ever had in my life. I use baby carrots because they are more uniform in size and cook more evenly.

We loved these carrots!  The only change I made was to cut them smaller so they would cook faster.... I didn't have an hour to spare.  They turned out delicious and will definitely make again!

Made these a second time and they weren't as good as the first. Had other things in the oven at the same time but even the baby carrots didn't get done in an hour on convection bake. I thought they were better the first time.

Simple, pretty healthy.  Will make again for any day side dish.  The honey just gives it a hint of sweetness.  It sort of seems like something is missing..a hint of nutmeg perhaps?

It was easy and pretty tasty. I wouldn't say it was anything really special, but I would probably make it again.

Just didn't enjoy this recipe. Followed the recipe as written, but we did not find this suited our taste buds. I  prefer roasting carrots without the honey and that way you taste the natural sweetness of the carrots. The honey really masks the natural sweetness.

We LOVED these! My 4 year old couldn't get enough. She's been asking for them almost everyday since!
