This recipe catches you by surprise.  I didn't think this would be anything more than just regular string beans, but it really was a lot more than that, it was superb! :)  The mushrooms are really important in order to get the full taste of this so don't forget them.  I used baby portobello.  The carrots add to the taste and make the dish look very appetizing because of the color contrast.  I steamed the carrots and beans instead of boiling.  If you prefer to do it this way as well, then I would suggest to make sure either a) the carrots are a cut little ticker than the beans before steaming all at once, or b) cutting the carrots the same thickness as the beans, but start steaming the beans for 3 minutes first before adding the carrots as the two vegetables won't steam at the same rate.  It's good to have the same texture for both rather than one softer than the other.  Also, as per another review I added 1 tsp of rosemary and 1 tsp thyme to the mix and everything came out great.  Even a little more of the sesame seeds doesn't hurt.  I had no issues with the salt content.  Will definitely make this again!

Very good base recipe.  Changes I made:
-Cooked mushrooms in olive oil and minced garlic until slightly tender
-Steam the green beans and carrots to firmness of liking.  
-Added onions to green beans and carrots to steam for 2-3 minutes to firmness of liking.
-Stir veggie mixture with mushrooms, add 2 dashes of seasoning salt, garlic salt, rosemary, and thyme
-Cook 1-2 additional minutes to warm if necessary

Key is to keep an eye on the steamed veggies.

This is a wonderful dish!  I think the carrots are a lovely addition.  I did however drastically cut the salt by using only the seasoning salt, plain garlic powder, and no plain salt.  A beautiful side dish with a very simple preparation.

This dish really melted in my mouth.  My substitutions: a dash of olive oil instead of the butter, 1 lb. each of mushrooms and green beans (instead of 1/2 lb. each), and Mrs. Dash instead of seasoned salt.  I can't get over how good this is.  Now I make it all the time!

This turned out very good. I would not recommend making it as part of a large, multi-dish dinner though because it took a while to prepare and I had to use several dishes while preparing it. The taste was very good though.

My husband would give this recipe 10 stars if he could.  He requested this two days in a row.  I too enjoyed this very much, though my two girls...well you know how kids and veggies can be!  I did make some changes to the seasoning portion since like the 1st reviewer said, there is quite a bit of salt called for.  I just added 1 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning salt, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, and added chopped fresh garlic (two cloves) along with the onion/mushroom mixture.  This is a great change from plain ordinary vegetables, and I will be making this again and again.

This was just average and I'm glad I only eyeballed ingredients rather than depending on measurements.  But if prepared as written there is too much onion for the amount of green beans and a real overload of salt, beyond what I think anyone would think tasted good, and that is reason enough to give this recipe two stars.  I've also discovered that carrots mixed in with green beans is not a tasty combination for me.

Too much salt. Used seasoned salt, substituted garlic powder and left out the regular salt.  Also sprinkled on 2 tbsp parmesan cheese just before serving and everyone loved them, even the veggie haters.  Thanks for a great base recipe.

A few will say that by changing a recipe to taste, you are no longer reviewing that recipe. I say, without this recipe, I'd never have found the BEST green bean recipe of my life. Hands down the only recipe I have where everyone will eat the hated green beans. I'd happily have absconded with the pan and had nothing else, & I'm not vegetarian. Changes I made, based on my desires & some pointers posted here: split the butter in half and added 2 tbsp canola oil. (Just don't like olive!) Omitted the salt, up the seasoned salt to 3/4 tsp, garlic powder instead of salt AND added 2 tsp minced garlic. At the end, sprinkled the surface with salt, and sprinkled 1/4 C Parmesan on top. I followed procedure, even when I didn't want to. Steamed my beans and carrots, which I had julienned. For anyone doing this, follow another reviewer's advice; steam the green beans alone for a few minutes before adding the carrots. I didn't. No major consequences, but the veggies would've been more uniform. However, as the mushrooms and onions ended up being a similar texture to the thinly julienned carrots, it didn't really matter! I give this a HUGE 5 STARS. The best veggie recipe I possess. I love all 4 vegetables in the medley. I can't express my thanks enough. As one reviewer mentioned, make this when the dish will accompany something that can be made ahead, or in an oven or slow cooker. This will come out perfectly if you give it your attention, and knife skills. BEAUTIFUL! So delicious. Thank you.

This recipe has fabulous flavor!  And so easy to make.  My husband just loved this one.  I will make this over and over.  I used garlic instead of garlic salt, and will cut down on the plain salt next time, however.

Too many onions and too few green beans.  I reccommend only using 1/4 of a large onion or 1/2 of a small onion and a whole pound of green beans to make 6 servings.  Also, reduce butter to only 2-3 tablespoons and watch green beans for over cooking.

This is a wonderful presentation dish!  It went over very well (kids picked out the shrooms & onion).  I put the mushrooms in when I added the green beans & carrots to the skillet because I like them a little raw.  I think that next time I will skip the season salt all together, this is great, Thanks Michele!!

Cut back on the salt in this and you have a winner!!  I had time to fuss with this, so I cooked all my veggies separately.  That way I could get them perfectly crisp tender and maintain their vibrant colors.  I used the seasoned salt and the garlic salt, but didn’t use the regular salt.  I assembled this early in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated.  Then reheated it in the microwave just before serving.  I’ll make this one again – a beautiful combination!

Very enjoyable side dish and I think I might even use this recipe for Thanksgiving this year, as the presentation is just too pretty not to show off (lol)!
As did others, I added no salt but for the seasoned. I also sauteed 2 cloved of fresh garlic with the mushrooms and onions, used a blend of peppercorns and added a touch of rosemary, thyme and parsley.
Many thanks to THE MOM!

Great recipe! Even the "doubters" enjoyed the dish. My variations - instead of butter, used olive oil and tamari (yep - made it in a wok); for the seasoned salt I used Old Bay; and I used fresh black pepper because I didn't have white pepper.

This wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  I did change a few things.  I omitted the carrots (don't like cooked carrots) and for seasoning I used garlic powder, rosemary, salt and freshly ground pepper.  Next time I think I'll add some white wine while a sautee the mushrooms and maybe add the green beans sooner.  The beans didn't get much of the flavoring.  I'll also add the seasonings sooner too.  
I'll try it again.

I have made this a few times and it seems to get better every time. Since my family are not big carrot eaters, I eliminated them and used slightly less oil. There is never a been leftover when I make this. A definite make again and again.

Very good, simple vegetable medley. I used black pepper instead of white, a little less butter and a tablespoon of olive oil. I have also made this using frozen green beans & carrots, I just partially steamed them before adding to the skillet. This worked out just fine when you don't have fresh. I will use this again, thanks :)

This is the best recipe!!  I DO NOT like green beans but needed a vegetable for a holiday dinner.  Since trying it, I crave this and have made it several times since.  You can experiment with the seasonings and the amount of butter and I also use baby carrots to make it quicker.

This recipe turned out really good. I too added Thyme and Rosemary. It was delich! Nice change for the green beans. I would give it a 5 star but I felt it needed something.......maybe the sesame seeds would have done the trick????

Ahhh-mazing! Made this tonight and the hubby and I were above and beyond pleased with it.  What a delicious veggie dish!  I thought it was a bit salty, but I eyeballed my measurements.  It was soooo good that we probably had only three servings out of this six serving recipe! I was unsure of season salt, because I'm not usually a fan, but I reallly enjoyed it.  I also used garlic powder instead of salt.

Made this at Christmas.  If you want a simple tasting dish this is it.  My mom commented that sometimes it's nice to eat simple.  Not sure if this was a compliment.

I skipped the butter and used a little Sage and Wild Mushroom Olive Oil, then seasoned with basil, oregano, sage and black pepper, skipping the salt altogether.  Turned out nice.

This was a lovely and colorful side dish at my recent dinner party (main entree was prosciutto wrapped chicken breasts).  I added a clove of garlic, minced, with the onion and used black pepper because I didn't have any white on hand.

We really enjoyed this and we made as directed. However, we probably will cut down on the salt next time.

Great meld of flavors. It's December in Minnesota, which makes fresh green beans a little frivolous for a weeknight dinner, so I used a pint (cut the recipe in half) that I canned myself (no added salt). Because they are already so soft I added them last and just heated them up to temp. The only other change I made was to use black pepper and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Using unsalted butter helped insure that the entire recipe was not too salty. Love it and will keep the recipe for when the garden is green again!

This is my favorite side dish!  I make this all the time. The only thing I have changed, is I use canola oil instead of butter.

This was great!! I have 5 kids and everyone thought it was really good.  I cut back a little on the butter, just to save calories and fat. No one picked out anything, but then my family is usually pretty good with their veggies.  It does have many steps, but absolutly worth each and every one.  I agree with a previous reviewer in that I doubt I would make this at the same time I was cooking a hugh meal, but possibly if I had the time before hand and got it all prepped I would.  It's that impressive. Thanks for a great recipe.
UPDATE: I forgot to add that I cut down on the salt.  I agree with other reviewers that it just doesn't need that much salt.  I'm making this for Thanksgiving this year.  I'm going to make it the day before, and then just warm it the next day. I might try to add some toasted slivered almonds too.  Someone else tried that and liked it.  It sounds good to me.  Yummmm

This calls for an awful lot of salt!  I omitted the regular salt, increased seasoned salt to 1 tsp. and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  It was quite tasty!

Olive oil instead of the butter is a good and healthy alternative.  It give wonderful flavor to veggies.  This is a very easy side dish to add to any meal.  To turn into a full on meal sauté a chicken breast, cut in small pieces and add to cooked vegetables.  Sprinkle lightly with parmesan before serving.

I thought there was just way too much salt called for in this recipe so I opted to use fresh Hawaiian sea salt and pepper instead. I also used half of an onion sliced instead of one whole onion. I skipped step one of boiling the carrots and green beans in water. I added 2T of butter to the skillet, then sautéed the onions and garlic before adding the carrots and green beans. When the vegetables were almost tender-crisp, I added the sliced mushrooms. I seasoned the vegetables to taste. The taste was good but had I used the entire salt called for I know it would have been an overkill and inedible. I also did not use the entire ¼ cup of butter called for as I felt that I did not need that much. The vegetables were crisp-tender yet colorful and eye appealing. As for overall taste I thought it was ok. I served this with, “Ono Spareribs,” also from this site.

Everytime I make this I love it better. And keep tweeting it a little and I have yet to serve it to guest that they want recipe.  I steam the green beans and carrots. I eliminate at lot of butter to 1 tbs and 1 tbs of olive oil. I dice the onions they fill in better that way. Add roasted red peppers or just red bell pepper. And the amount of salt in here will kill you.  I use garlic or garlic powder, no salt, 1/4 tsp of a seasoned salt. I get my spices from Penzys Spices.com and I add a 1/2 tsp of Tuscan Sunset.it completes the flavor without the salt. This is my veggie day dish...big pan of it and get it all. 1/5/15, just read my review and was wondering what to do for dinner..I will use this recipe and convert it into a soup with spinach tortellini, shredder leftover rotisserie chicken, and add some chicken broth. I will then try on neighbors and bet it will be a hit. This is my go to veggie day dish. Just with the few adjustments this is a really healthy dish.  And believe me I love butter and all that good stuff like anybody else, but "THE MOM" had a wonderful base to start with. Thanks MOM...

A very colorful mixture with just the right ratio of each vegetable.  My common sense urged me not to add the full amount of salt right away which was the right call for our tastes.  This recipe has 4 sources of salt if you use salted butter, so use your best judgment before adding it all.  I think 2 T. of butter is plenty to saute the veggies.  I sauteed minced garlic with the vegetables since I don't have garlic salt, and used only the seasoned salt of the various salts in the recipe.  I think this would be good with some other herbs added as well.

Far too much salt in this recipe. It overwhelms the vegetables. I'll use fresh garlic and 1/2 teaspoon salt next time.

This recipe is simply AMAZING! The blend of flavors is sooo tasty. The first time I made this, I cut the butter in half, and still thought it a bit too much. So the second time I only used 1/4 of the amount called for, and it was still enough to saute the onions & mushrooms.   I used a lemon/pepper seasoning salt and I thought it was just perfect! I steamed the green beans and carrots rather than boiling them, and used half the amount of salt called for - the full amount would have been too much, IMO.  Very, very good recipe! I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was great, although I altered it slightly.  I cut the amount of salt in half - good thing because even with half the salt it was way too salty!!  The second time I made this recipe, I sprinkled just a small amount of garlic salt and seasoned salt on the vegetables and omitted the regular salt entirely - it tasted great!  I also omitted the carrots since my husband is not fond of them.

This recipe is terrific. We've made it at least 6 times since Thanksgiving. We steam the fresh green beans & carrots for 25 min. That's the only change, everyone loves them! Extra mushrooms are a good idea too.

Very good recipe. The flavor was very subtle so it works well as a side dish. It doesn't take away from your main dish. The green beans and carrots make a complimentary crispness to the sauteed mushrooms and onions. It made for a nice balanced dish. Make sure you use fresh green beans, canned beans get mushy.

This recipe was delicious.  I also love the one on this site called Garlic Green beans made with canned beans but this one might be a bit better.  I like how it has color with the carrots and the onions and mushrooms make it just perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great.  I will make again.

Very good over all. I made some changes that suited me better. I left out the carrots and just doulbled the amount of beans and mushrooms. Also, I left out the garlic salt and used fresh garlic. It came out great. Had a hard time getting the dish away from my 6 yr old.. she LOVED it!!

Went off without a hitch.  It was a fantastic side to BLT sandwiches.  I may try to substitute 3 Tbs of infused olive oil in place of the butter next time just for fun.

This was a big hit with my family.  I made it for Easter  and have a very large family.  60+ for Easter.  There was nothing left to scrape out of the bowl.  All the kids as well as the adults loved it!  I made it exactly like the recipe called for except that I made it the day before and finished the last 3 minutes of cooking the next day.

Really enjoyed this recipe, but I did make one change.  Instead of 1/4 cup of butter I substituted 1 tbsp of olive oil and a splash of fat free chicken stock to sautee the veggies.  Way less fat and calories, but still a flavorful dish.  Will definitely make it again.

This is a very tasty spin on a vegetable medley. My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe, and it tasted great alongside the steaks and baked potatoes I made. I didn't use these exact measurements, but I used the recipe for reference and worked with basically the same proportions. I used all of the ingredients listed except for the plain salt (the seasoned salt and garlic salt were sufficient) and the white pepper (I used freshly ground black pepper instead). Also, I used baby carrots that I already had in my fridge, and I cut back on the onion. I used half of one large white onion, which was plenty. 

I followed the directions exactly except that I boiled the green beans a couple of minutes before adding the carrots after reading another review that stated the carrots cook faster. These little tweaks worked like a charm because the finished product was PERFECTION. I have to agree with other reviews that it tastes better than you expect. The butter, garlic, and seasonings really bring these already tasty veggies to life, and I will be whipping these up again soon!

Awesome side dish!  Cant go wrong with mushrooms.  All the flavors complimented each other very well.  Very easy to make.  Definitely a keeper.

Used more green beans, less onion, and only seasoned salt for salt.  Added little garlic powder, rosemary, and thyme.  Cooked green beans and carrots on "fresh vegetable" setting in microwave.

I only like to rate a recipe if its great without changes but if you add the changes i did then make this a 5 star..

steam the string beans and carrots
add minced fresh garlic to the onions
follow the rest except at end add 4 tbs of terriyaki sauce.  really makes all the difference... amazing!

I'm giving this 4 stars but it's really not a fair review.  We're on a restricted diet so I didn't use the butter but I bet if I had this would have been a 5+ star recipe.  Instead I used a little grapeseed oil but followed the rest of the recipe.  Took suggestion of other reviewers and steamed the green beans and carrots separately before adding.

This is an excellent vegetable dish!  I cooked it as a side dish for a dinner get together and it went like hot pancakes.  It was quite tasty and flavorful, yet simple to make. I didn't have garlic salt on hand, so I substituted it for garlic powder at half the measurement. It still tasted great.  I will be making dish again and again.

Great recipe, I make it for big family gatherings by doubling the recipe. I would caution against using as much of the 'salt' additives. I forgot that this past Thanksgiving and it was really overpowering.

This was so good, its so simple!  I cooked it today as a veggie side to a stuffed turkey.  It was so colorful, I made sure to not cook the shrooms too much since it will look wilted and unappealing.  I made one change, added fresh garlic, and 4 cloves minced.

DIVINE!!!!!!1

I HATE veggies, but I loved this!!  The only problem was that it was way too salty.  I actually had to rinse this dish off with hot water before I served it.  After that it was perfect!!  Will make again and again.

This recipe is great. I made it for several people, including small children. It was a hit. I did make some changes though. Olive oil instead of butter, a pound of green beans, mini bella mushrooms, red onions & green onions, crushed garlic, baby carrots cut in half. I also neglected the salt, opting instead to eyeball some all purpose seasoning and the white pepper. Very, very good. Will definately make it again.

One of best recipes I've found for fresh green beans.  I used about 3/4 lb. of beans.  Too many onions and mushrooms for the kids but the adults loved it.  Good pot luck covered dish.

I always mess up the vegetable dish for our holiday meals. This one looked simple, so I figured what the heck. It was terrific! I cut back on the salt, and used baby carrots instead. My guests loved it! Finally, a perfect meal!

I made this recipe before, but to forgot to review it.  Came across it again, and decided to make it.  I microwaved the carrots/green beans in 1 inch water for 2.5 minutes and used Montreal Chicken seasoning for the seasoned salt, but otherwise, stuck to the recipe.  Holy moly, absolutely delicious!!  I will be making this often!!

I absolutely loved this recipe (my kids too). I went back for seconds without feeling guilty. One suggestion I'd like to make, after I added all the seasoning together, I decided to use only 1/2 of them. I had a hunch it would be too salty and I was right. It does not need as many salts as the recipe calls for....

The best vegetable dish ever!  Even hubby (who generally avoids veggies)LOVES this.  The only changes I made were to reduce the salt content by at least half, per suggestions in other reviews.

This was very good, but way too salty. Next time, I will omit the 1 teaspoon salt and perhaps add fresh garlic in place of the garlic salt.

so gooood!  i made about two servings but ate it all myself! one carrot, half an onion, a handful each of green beans and mushrooms. i sautéed my mushrooms and onions in a little bit of bacon fat and used three large cloves of garlic (i have an obsession with it) and i also used a sweet chili sauce so i added a pinch of cayenne pepper.  i also added a bit of rosemary and thyme per other reviews.  i only seasoned with pepper.  it had just the right amount of kick. i ate it all before my main dish! will definitely make again.

I only write reviews when a dish really wows me, and boy, was this good! I recently decided I have to get more veggies in my diet. This is one of the first dishes I'm trying in my new food life and it was delicious! I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. The changes I made (and they're small) were using 3 carrots, 1/2 an onion (only b/c my family doesn't like them), mincing a few cloves of garlic into the dish and omitting the garlic salt and using Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt in place of the seasoned salt, oh, and reg pepper. This is an amazing side dish-you get 4 veggies in one dish and a little bit of garlic (I try to eat garlic several times a week) and it tastes great! So if you're like me, not big on veggies, try this dish, it will be on reg rotation.

I brought this to Easter lunch as an alternative to the usual casserole, and it was a hit! I doubled the recipe except for the onion and used olive oil instead of butter.  I will be making this again!

I haven't made it yet but can tell it will be good. I will steam green beans and carrots. I agree with others about olive instead of butter.

Interesting combo, worked well.  Only used the seasoning salt as I cooked minced garlic with the onions. Also microwaved the green beans and carrots rather than steaming.

I pretty much followed the recipe (didn't measure the veggies really), and decreased the amount of butter a little bit. Turned our delicious and was the perfect accompaniment for a dinner party. Looked lovely!

Rave reviews from household... used less salt and didn't use carrots.  Also used some garlic scapes in about the same length as the green beans (cooked exactly the same way) and everyone thought it was great.

This was very very good.  I took the advice of one reviewer and went with 2 TBS of olive oil and 1 TBS of butter instead of all that butter just to make it a bit healthier.    I'll definitely make this again.

Thank you for a good recipe. We added broccoli and leaks (you gotta wash them thoroughly by the way, because of the sand hiding in there, unless you want a medley crunch...) and we also used it in a soup the day after. Mmm tasty.

great base to start with; I used cremini mushrooms, no butter (just sauteed the onions, garlic, mushrooms, salt and pepper in olive oil), then added everything in a casserole dish with a splash of balsamic vinegar and baked for approx 15 min @ 375 degrees.... great!

Only changes: Steamed the beans and carrots (used baby carrots sliced lengthwise) Half butter, half evoo,and no regular salt. When I asked DH to rate it, he gave it 4 stars. I asked why not 5, and he replied, "It's not CHOCOLATE." I think that I ate more than one serving, okay, I KNOW I did!

This is honestly one of my all time favortie vegetable recipes.  One time I doubled it and I thought the spices were a little strong so I usually mix them all together and slowly add them and keep tasting until I have the strength I want.  I would absolutely recommend this recipe - and the colors in it are beautiful.

Very very good dish. It had a sweet flavor although there is no sugar, maybe from the garlic and the carrots and the fact I used a Texas sweet onion? This is very tasty. I used a frozen veg. medley with green beans, wax beans, and baby carrots. I also used minced garlic in the jar (about a generous tsp.) instead of garlic salt, and a jar of sliced mushrooms. I had to redo the cooking times because of the frozen veggies, but this turned out very nicely and hubby has asked for this to be repeated. Next time, I'd like to try it with the fresh veggies as I'm sure it would have gotten 5 stars.

I can’t help but think that this recipe is good only because of the 1/4c of butter and the four sources of salt (salted butter, seasoned salt, salt, and garlic salt).  Its like adding cheese to veggies so kids will like it.  Not a bad recipe but you loose a little of the vegetable flavor with so much butter and salt.  Try subbing olive oil or go half olive and half butter for something a little more lighter.  Add some actual minced garlic (about a clove, adjust for personal preference for garlic) just before the onion and mushrooms are done (garlic added to early can scorch easily and become bitter) and omit the to often used boring garlic salt.

Big hit.  Cut the regular salt in half and used garlic instead of garlic salt.  Nice change from the plain butter, salt and pepper routine.  Would be a great company dish.

This is a great side dish.  My husband loved it and so did my one year old son.  I am making for a dinner party this weekend. I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, but next time I will cut down on the butter, salt and onion.  I also may have cooked the vegs too long.  Watch the time on this one.

This dish was fantastic.  I had to use canned green beans, but it was still really tasty.  I can't wait to try it in the summer time when I have fresh beans and carrots from my garden.  A very addition to a meal because of the color.  I served it for Christmas dinner with ham and scalloped potatoes.  It was a hit.  Thanks!

I didn't give this one a kid friendliness rating as my toddler likes his carrots raw only.  For the rest of us, yum, yum, yum, yummy!  The sweetness from the onion adds a wonderful flavor.  I now have a new favorite side dish.  I served it with brown sugar meatloaf from this site and baked potatoes with all the fixings.  Comfort food heaven!

I had lots of mushrooms and green beans so I thought I would try this recipe out.  Changed the amounts of seasonings by reducing the salt, next time I would leave it out. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Added thyme. Next time I will add two cloves of fresh chopped garlic fried with the mushrooms and onions.  I also added some toasted sesame seeds. My husband loved this recipe and it looks nice.

Lovely recipe. Served it with Eggplant Parmesan and they went well together. I didn't have garlic salt so used fresh garlic instead, so for me the salt level was perfect. Thank you, The Mom!
I always find it humorous that people make a recipe and then give it 2 stars because the salt level was too high, or it was overcooked, or it was too much butter. Aren't we cooks? Don't we taste at every stage and eyeball for doneness and the amount of butter we need? These are subjective things to your own taste..

Made this last night for a dinner party with a few slight modifications. We don't have seasoned salt or white pepper. So we used regular pepper and no seasoned salt. But it was still delicious!  There were 3 of us for dinner, but I made the full recipe, and there is about 1 serving left. We all loved it, which is unusual for my husband since he is not a veggie lover. He actually had a second serving. Will definitely make this again.

I made this EXACTLY as listed (well, maybe except for the carrots- I used precut carrot sticks and I threw in enough to balance out the different colors- about 5 or 6).  Don't steam the veggies too long or they'll get soggy after adding them to the rest of the ingredients...was a BIG hit in my house, thanks a lot! Will DEFINITELY cook again!

So delicious! I steamed my green beans and shrooms just enough to take the crisp off then threw them into only 1 1/2 Tbs of butter and some fresh pressed garlic and oregano!! Steaming them a lil before they were sautéed added such an extra juicy component!!! To die for!!

A delicious colorful vegetable dish.  I normally don't care for carrots, but enjoyed them in this dish.  Only use half tsp of salt, and it was too much.

Looks delicious! I plan on cooking it when I can find out a couple of things about the recipe. Why is white pepper used? Actually I have never heard of white pepper. I also like steaming my vegetables rather than cook them in water. I love to saute onions and mushrooms that would add good flavor.

Awesome!  Husband said was the best veggies he has ever had.   I added fresh chopped garlic.  I will only use 1/2 the recommended butter next time.  Don't care for carrots, so omitted them.  Thank you!

My only problem with this recipe is that it calls for too much salt.  Instead of garlic salt use garlic powder. Otherwise I love this so much it could be my main dish.

This is excellent just as it is!!!  I used carrots that were small jullienes because I had a bag on hand and they worked great.  I steamed the green beans (fresh) and just added the carrots the last couple of minutes because they were so small.  It worked great and was a very pretty combination of colors and tasted grrreeaaatt!

These green beans were pretty much amazing! My husband, my two year old, and I really liked it. My five year old was not impressed, but three out of four isn't bad in my book. The flavor of this was great, although next time I think I will use real garlic instead of garlic salt, but other than that I don't think I would change anything. This takes a little while to make because of the chopping, but it is so worth it. The carrots were definitely different to have with green beans, but it was very good, and a different combination to try. Thank you for sharing the recipe with us!

This was surprisingly good.  Instead of blanching the vegetables, I just sauteed them for longer, which coincidentally carmelized the onions.  Making it again tonight!

Yum!!! I made this tonight for dinner as a side dish and it was delicious. I did follow other reviewers and decreased the amount of all the different kinds of salt. I only ended up using garlic salt and seasoning salt. I will definitely be making this again!!

This is an easy and nutritious go-to side dish but I had to make a few changes that helped bring it over the top. I switched out the carrots for sliced up red and yellow peppers and I used a few tbsp's of olive oil instead of butter. I sautéed the onions and garlic first, then threw in the veggies. I skipped the step where you steam the green beans. After about 5 minutes I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock and allowed it to reduce for about 10 more minutes. Then at the very end I added some chopped fresh parsley and sliced kalamata olives. I suppose I changed so much that it's practically a new recipe, but it really came out so delicious!

My husband is a green bean fanatic and loved this recipe. Based on other reviews I omitted the salt. I also used frozen string beans. I make this regularly.

I think it's amazing. Couldn't stop eating it, and it's a surprise because it seems like such a plain and simple recipe, which is probably why it's the best. My only change-up is using matchstick carrots instead of chopping. So I waited to add them until combining with the mushrooms and onions. I'm not a huge cooked carrot fan, so this was yummier to me and also I enjoyed the texture. You won't be disappointed!

made as stated.  very divine!  great combo of veggies...used sage and cumin and fresh garlic to season...used half butter/half evoo...could probably cut back on oils and still have lots of flavor....it is a new family favorite and keeper.

Very good flavor but way too much salt....three forms of it. I eliminated the plain salt and it was plenty salty.a 5 without the third salt. On the butter front: although it tasted good as is...there is a lot of butter on the veggies. I think next time I make it I will cut down on the butter or make it with half olive oil to make them a bit more healthy.

Couldn't quite give 5 stars for recipe as is. I did really enjoy the chosen veggies together. The seasoning just wasn't quite right. Will play more with it next time and also try recommendations from other reviews. Thanks for posting!

Great recipe. I doubled the green beans and trippled the carrots. Also, I sliced the cloves of one garlic bulb (we LOVE garlic) and sauteed with the onion and mushrooms. This is one of my son's favorite sides.

This was good but did not have that wow factor.  I skipped the plain salt-would have been WAAAY too salty with all those salts!  It was missing something though.  Next time I would also skip the seasoning salt and add some nice herbs.

Great recipe!  I intended to make a double batch, but due to a shopping list error, ended up with enough ingredients for a quadruple batch, so that's what I made.  For that volume, I did cut back on the proportion of butter (used about 1/3 cup total), which worked just fine.  If I make that large of a batch again, I would also cut the white pepper a bit from the full teaspoon that I used.  I froze the leftovers without a problem.

This was very good. Since we were having an Asian type Salmon dish, I threw on some toasted sesame seeds after we cooked them. Also used minced garlic in lieu of garlic salt since I try to avoid as much salt as I can.

Great side dish. I steamed the beans and carrots instead of boiling and cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon (and it was plenty). Next time I might add some fresh herbs.

This is absolutely perfect with just about any entree.  I have served this at several different events, and everyone has loved it!  The only simple changes I made were, I used between 1-1/2 lbs to 2 lbs of green beans and 4 carrots.  Otherwise, this recipe is great the way it is.

Made this for Easter dinner, everyone loved it. I did make a couple of changes. I used garlic powder and minced, to cut down on the salt. I sauted the onions and mushroom, then I mixed all ingredients in a bowl, then I put it in a casserole dish and baked it for 1 hour. Beans and carrots were nice and tender the way my family likes them. Will make again.

This was outstanding!   It was easy and added a great dose of color to our dinner.   I had roasted red peppers I needed to use up, so I chopped them up and substituted them for the carrots, but otherwise followed it exactly.  The salt was fine for us and I am typically very sensitive when it comes to salt.  Will definitely make this again.

I used a real garlic clove and only put in the seasoning salt and they were still too salty!  It was delicious though and I'll make it again with a bit less salt.  I used canned mushrooms and green beans and it still turned out great.

Great!  Everyone at tw0 T'giving dinners liked it.  Couldn;t find button mushrooms so used brwn sliced.  Found steam-in-the-bag green beans, great time-saver.  Carrots seemed too big, so cut them in 1-1/2 " pieces.  A pretty dish and very tasty

Not bad.  I used 1 TB of olive oil instead of butter.  I also steamed the carrots/green beans.  Didn't have white pepper so just used black.  Used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt.

I followed this one step-by-step, and it was absolutely delicious.   Thank you for this recipe.  I don't think I'll ever make fresh green beans any other way.

It was very good, but definitely cut the butter a bit. It was a little bit too oily for me. However, I don't think it would've tasted the same if I substituted it with olive oil - the butter flavor really comes out in this dish. I also used frozen green beans and it was fine :)

If I were to choose a green veggie to go with my meal....it would definitely NOT BE green beans........HOWEVER, these were absolutely delicious and was so very pretty on the table.  If my camera was charged I would've taken a picture for you!  I forgot to add the garlic salt and it was just fine.  The only thing I added was some cubed tofu that I browned in a little butter.  Will DEFINITELY repeat this recipe.

Very good!  This is good summer vegetable blend that's makes a better than typical side dish.  Will definitely be making this again.  To cut down on some of the work, we used a bag of fresh carrot chips (sliced like potato chips with ridges) instead of peeling and slicing the long, whole carrots.

I love this!! I'm on a pretty restricted diet right now and learning how to cook healthier.  I left out the mushrooms (don't care for them), used olive oil, fresh garlic and salts and pepper to taste, didn't bother to snap the beans--thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely wonderful.  Added more carrots and used lemon pepper seasoning instead of salt.  Made this with bacon mushroom swiss meatloaf from this site.
Will be a regular in our house!

This is a great recipe for fresh green beans. I omitted the carrots because I had 1 and 1/2 lbs of green beans to cook. I used an 8oz bagged of sliced fresh mushroom and it turned out great. Like other reviewers I didn't add the salt only used the season salt and my roasted garlic & sea salt grinder from Costco. I took this dish to my Mother in laws for thanksgiving and she loved it. She saved the few leftovers for herself. I will be making this again, it’s a keeper.

i really liked this a lot. i dont normally serve carrots as a side but hubby liked them this way with the other veggies. i hardly used any of the salt asked for in the recipe and subbed w/ garlic powder and lemon pepper. i also used olive oil instead of butter because the rest of dinner was pretty heavy(oven fried parmesan chix and mashed potatoes).

Although this recipe is incredibly simple, and easy to make, it was so good... it's like comfort food, I was really surprised at how delicious just a few ingredients can be! I will definitely be making it again, and probably try some different variations in terms of the vegetables! Thanks :)

This was fantastic! I'm not much of a cook, but my friends were all pitching in to make dinner, so I had to do something. This was so easy and so freaking good! I added some rosemary and thyme, just 'cause it was there. I was so proud of myself, it was ridiculous.

Amazing recipe (with some minor modifications). Who would have thought that veggies could steal the show at dinnertime?! I used fresh wild morels (which are in season here), substituted about 1/4 t of minced garlic (sauted with the onion) for the garlic salt and left out the salt, seasoned salt, white pepper and just did a generous shake or two of seasoned salt instead. Wonderful! Will now work at reducing the butter to see if that can be done without sacrificing flavor. Will definitely be making this again.

I was really surprised by the amount of flavor from these simple ingredients!  My husband, who does not like vegetables, even liked it!  I did not add as much salt as it called for, because it seemed like to much.  Instead of garlic salt, I added minced garlic and I only added the seasoned salt and not the plain salt.  I'm sure this would taste great with whatever vegetables are your favorites.

This was really really good! All the flavours combine perfectly to make the perfect vegetable dish, I ended up eating mine as a main served with basmati rice and it was excellent! I used fresh garlic instead, added some fresh thyme and a splash of soy sauce and reduced the salt by 3/4.. I also toasted some seeds (sesame, pumpkin & sunflower) cause I had them and added them at the end and it was excellent! A simple dish but the nicest I've had in ages! : )

This was a great, healthy side dish. My husband, who claims not to like carrots, green beans, or mushrooms, ate this for two days. He did pick out the mushrooms, but he raved about the carrots and beans. I too loved it. I doubled the green beans.

The sesame seeds added great flavor, as did the broth. The beans were less crispy than I like so I might reduce the cooking time next time.

You only need a tablespoon of butter - no need to add extra fat when it's not needed!  Very delicious combination of flavors.  Serves well with pork.

I wanted to try this recipe but forgot to buy the mushrooms!  I cooked it anyways & added sliced almonds that I cooked in the butter with the onion........so yummy!  I received raving reviews from the hubby on this one!  It will be even better next time wiht the almonds, and, of course, the mushrooms!

at the behest of other reviewers, i made sure to cut back on the salt. so, i used unsalted butter, used garlic bread seasoning instead of garlic salt (sadly do not have plain garlic powder on hand), & did not add any seasoned salt. please remember to cut back on salt in ALL your cooking! you most likely wont miss that *little* bit of salt & you'll be eating a lot healthier! other modifications that were made included using half butter / half olive oil, black pepper instead of white, & a touch of lemon for some sunshine. 

in the future, i will boil my beans for a shorter time, or steam them, & hopefully get some white pepper because i think that would be a stellar addition. in all, thanks for this recipe! it was really helpful in helping me figure out how to get rid of the mushrooms & beans in my fridge & i really like how fresh & healthy this recipe is (sans the salt).

I thought this was a great recipe EXCEPT that it's waaaay too salty for my taste. But, cut back on the salt, and my picky husband eats it without complaints! I served this with breaded baked pork chops...yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

This was super tasty, although I did change it slightly.  I steamed the green beans for a little first, I don't like to boil veggies.  I didn't use any salt or garlic salt.  Instead I coarsely chopped a couple of cloves of garlic and sautéed them with the onion and mushroom.  They got very sweet and delicious.  I left out the carrot (none on hand) but I bet it would be just as good.

This is a good dish overall. I love how it adds so many different types of veggies together. I have made this a few times and it is always a hit. I add lots of galic to mine as we are garlic lovers.

Our garden has been very prolific with beans, so I have been trying a lot of bean recipes lately, this was one every one liked. The only changes I made was to add a chicken oxo cube and worchester sauce. Very tasty!

A very nice vege dish.  I steamed the veges...and sadly got carried away with it!  Next time I'll be more vigilant and not over-cook them!  STILL--the dish was very nice, even with less than al dente veges!

Excellent side dish!  I used canned green beans in place of fresh, and used a generous amount of granulated garlic to sauteed mushrooms and onions. Delicious!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was very tasty.  I doubled the recipe but omitted the onions and carrots and added just a tad of honeybaked ham to the last stage.  I used fresh green beans and mushrooms so they were tender but still a bit crisp.  They were the first leftover to be completely gone and my child ate them voluntarily!!

Great ingredients but a little too mushy for my taste.  I steamed the fresh green beans and added them to the mushroom/onion mixture.  Definitely would add more spices.  I added garlic salt at the end and it made it better.

YUMMY!! I didn't have fresh mushrooms,so I used canned. Still tasted wonderful! I omited the seasoned salt and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Also, I didn't have white pepper, so I used black pepper. SO GOOD!

Fresh tasting, light & nice mixture of colors.  Excluded salt, and seasoned salt.  Served atop buttered egg noodles.  Next time I'll add sliced red bell pepper to make dish even more colorful :)

Very tasty veggie combination!  However, I steamed the beans and carrots instead of boiling, used extra garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and added 1 teaspoon seasoned salt (but no regular salt).

This was excellent.  My Aunt ran into a snag in bringing a vegetable for Thanksgiving, and I found this at the last minute, made it, and it was GONE!!!  It was easy to make and some of the easiest recipes are usually the best.  Definitely a keeper!!!!

Although I do love all vegetables, this was ok.  I probably won't make it again.

For some reason, this was a flop at our house.  I wanted to try it because of the great reviews, but it just didn't taste very good to my family.  In fact, we threw the leftovers away.  I wish it would have turned out better for us.

This was delicious!  Even the family member who likes green beans cooked for hours loved this recipe and wants to have it again.  Thanks for a great veggie recipe.

Great change from the usual veggies.  I added a bit more seasoned salt to give it a bit more "kick".  Everyone loved this one.

This was delicious! I have added it to my recipe file, very few recipes make it that far. Great combo of veggies, the only fat is the butter. Next time I will reduce the amount of butter, or use olive oil in place of, wich is heart healthy.

What a GREAT side!  We omitted the mushrooms due to an allergy and used about half the recommended amount of butter (this was plenty for us).  Also, we used a frozen Prince Edward Vegetable Blend.  Just perfect!

I made this recipe with a few minor changes (based both on the reviews and our dietary preferences). 1) I steamed the green beans and the carrots. 2) I replaced the butter with light olive oil. 3) I replaced the salts and seasonings with 1 tbsp. nutritional yeast, 1 tbsp. miso paste, 1 tbsp. Italian seasoning, 1 tbsp. fresh parsley and 2 cloves minced garlic. It was delicious! My husband asked for seconds. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent, I made it with steamed green beans and asparagus. I used three different types of mushrooms a whole onion and 4 cloves of garlic. I also cooked 3\4 pound of fresh shrimp and added it at the last minute.  with a slice of hot bread this made a complete meal for 2 with about the same amount of left overs.  I'm sure it will. reheat well and be great on a second day.  we both loved it.

This was really great. I just picked the beans and carrots in my garden and didn’t know how I wanted to cook them. The only thing I changed was I only used 2 Tbls of butter and I used minced garlic not garlic salt.

I will make this again but leave out salt.  I also cut the butter to 1 tablespoon and it was fine.

I made this last night as a side dish for baked chicken. It was delicious. I followed the recipe except for cutting back just a bit on the onions.  Baked chicken can be a little boring, but with this side dish, our dinner was yummy!

This was great.  I used petite carrots-no prep time.  I eliminated all seasonings and replaced with 1 teas Nature's Seasoning, 1/3 tsp each of Rosemary and Thyme. I precooked carrots and green beans in microwave separatey..  I used 1/2 butter, half olive oil.
I made a full recipe for just the two of us and used the leftovers 2 days later in an incredible omelette!  
This is great for company, or a do ahead at night, for an easy to prepare company omelet in the morning or for brunch.

Wow. This kicked up green beans a notch. I wasn’t convinced that they would taste different than my usual method of cooking green beans (long and low) but these were delicious. The mushrooms really add to the flavour and the carrots make them look nice on the table. Thanks for this recipe.

I made this leaving out carrots, all salts and butter. I substituted the ingredients with soy sauce and sesame  oil, 
ground pepper and toasted sesame seeds. Yum! These adjustments made this side heart smart, blood pressure friemdly and low cal.

I've Mae this quite a bit. I leave out the carrots because I just don't like cooked carrots. I've made it with the season salt and without. When I made it without, I put for red pepper flakes and extra salt in there. It always seems like a lot of butter so I don't worry about a tab or so taken from a 1/4 stick.

I had home-grown green beans in the freezer, and home-grown carrots, and wanted a recipe that incorporated both. So easy and delicious. Will definitely make this again. (I did reduce the salt to just a pinch, as I rarely add any salt at all.)

Perhaps it would have been better if I had green beans but not having those I added cherry tomatoes because it needed some acid. I also used a leek instead of onion. I felt it was very bland.

The only thing I changed was olive oil for the butter. Needed to cut the fat out for my husband. It was excellent with the olive oil so I can only imagine what it’s like with butter. Great flavors, good combination of vegetables. I wouldn’t change a thing. I hope this is looked as a fair review as I didn’t not add any extra spices etc to change it to the point it’s not the same recipe.

Used rehydrated onion & added minced garlic. Started steaming carts & beans then prepped the mushrooms. Used olive oil & a bit of butter to cook onion & mushrooms. Carrots & beans weren't quite done when I put them in the fry pan but they finished cooking while rest of dinner finished.

I've been making this for years and love it, it's always a big hit at my table.  The only change I make is in the onion, as I do agree that a whole onion is too much.  I use 2 slices, 3 at the most, and that's more than enough.  Everything else, tho, is perfect.

I doubled the mushrooms and beans as recommended.  Hot from the stove my adult daughter said that it was good.  She took it in her lunch the next day and said it was amazing.  She and her father fought over the left overs.  I'm making it again tonight with pearl onions.

One of my most-requested dishes from the family. I steam the veggies a day ahead instead of boiling them. Much less work the day of the event that way.

Great recipe and easy to make. Husband loved the flavor and to change up the leftovers we added 1 cup of bows and some strong parm/romano/asiago cheese. Will make it again.

Excellent inspiration. 4 stars as written because I think there's too much butter and salt. With changes to make it healthier, I give it a 5 stars. 
I halved the butter, reduced the following salt: 1/4 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp garlic salt, seasoned salt as is. I also put in 2 small carrots with stems person and left them whole. I cooked this once with onions and the other time without onions; I prefer without onions. I also used cremini mushrooms. My guests loved it.

I couldn't find white pepper at any of the stores in my town so I just used black pepper. Very good dish, nice alternate to green bean casserole during holidays.

I made this for dinner tonight. Now I did a few different things: carrot chips not carrot sticks, and I added a bit of garlic powder to taste about a table spoon of honey and two table spoons of sugar to give it a savory sweet taste to go along with our main dish. It turned out splendid, the only reason I didn't five star the recipe is because it doesn't give much detail on the timing of things or go into a lot of detail period. I managed to boil the vegetables for a good 10/15mins till I found the texture I was happy with before removing them and setting aside for the second step. I chose to alter the recipe because of my main dish being one that was in a rich side of the palette so I needed something to complement it. Either way I hope you or your family enjoy it.

I had a bunch of really beautiful fresh green beans and wanted to do something  special with them. This recipe was just the thing.  Not only did it look appealing but the flavors really played off each other and added another element that made the dish unique.  There wasn't a bit left and I was proud of how attractive the dinner plate looked. Definitely will be a keeper!  Thanks PRINCESS20NY!

This was WAY too peppery! I did make a few changes: Omit regular salt, increase seasoned salt slightly (I didn't measure the "extra" that I put in.) and I omitted the mushrooms since I was serving it  alongside chicken marsala.

These veggies were very tasty and the combination was great.  I don't like a lot of salt so I'm going to halve the amount of it (regular, seasoned and garlic) I use next time.  I also added a teaspoon of garlic to the butter before I threw the mushrooms in.  I loved the firm texture of the beans!    I cooked them for about 7 minutes with the carrots.  Thank you for sharing!

Tasty, but I think you could cut the butter by quite a bit, maybe even in half.

This really tasted good for seeming like a typical vegetable dish. I didn't have seasoning salt or garlic salt, so just added a little bit extra regular salt and I thought it was great! It might have been too salty if all the salt ingredients were added, though. So beware!

This dish was a big hit! I made for family dinner and everyone loved this dish.  I followed advice from some other reviews and prepared the vegetables separately.  I combined all ingredients the night before and warmed it in the oven on low heat for 45 min before serving.  Great flavor!  I will make this again.

The first time I made this dish it was very salty. I have since eliminated the teaspoon of salt, there is enough salt from the season salt. I also use 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt. With these changes, this has become one of my favorite side dishes.

Delicious!  But waaaaay too much butter. Ended up making everything a bit mushy. It could easily have been 1 Tbl and come out just as delicious. I should have gone with my gut and cut the butter at least by half.

This was awesome! I added 1tsp Rosemary, 1tsp of Thyme, and I eyeballed sesame seeds and did not add salt (I did use the seasoned salt though). The key is really getting the veggies to the firmness of your liking. I steamed the green beans and carrots separately and left them a tad firm so that when I added them to the sautéed mushrooms and onions they would cook a little more down to how I liked them. Big hit!

This was very easy, great tasting Side!!  We like green beans but finding a new recipe with great flavor is hard.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I cooked the beans and carrots in a skillet with the 1 inch water.  I cooked the mushrooms and onions in a larger skillet and combined them after mostly done.  I then used the larger skillet for my Chicken while the green beans simmered on low in the first skillet.  A 2 skillet meal!!  Yes!!!

Yummy.  I doubled the recipe for a gathering of about 10 people and there was only about one serving left.  I would probably use less butter next time.

This is a great combination of flavors and I think would complement main dishes year round.  I use Morton's Low Salt usually so I didn't have the salt issue some others commented on.  I steamed the green beans and carrots in the microwave and used about half olive oil, half butter.

Wow these are delicious!  Ok, I followed other reviewers suggestions...minced garlic instead of garlic salt, no regular salt added... and I didn't have carrots...but the beans and mushrooms are so delicious. Only problem is no one is going to want plain boring green beans again!

Terrific recipe, I loved it and it made a special occasion more special!  Since my husband and I are diabetic, I am always looking for healthy recipes.  I buy full length beans in a microwave pack at Walmart and just steam them.  I also tried this with match stick carrots that cooked along with the mushrooms and onions. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

With a few minor alterations, this is a great recipe, I've made it many times over the years, always well-received.
Forgo the plain salt, use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, use a good seasoned salt (we use Johnny's) to taste. If you make it as written, it'll be too salty.

I just made some changes, I saute 3 sliced garlic cloves (I love garlic) instead of using garlic salt, and saute the sliced onion garlic in oil instead and only had 1/2 pound of mushrooms on hand. Only used the seasoned salt and the white pepper. The combination of these vegetables is very delicious....

Wonderful. I used crushed garlic rather than garlic salt, no-salt seasoning, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 1 teaspoon sea salt.  Everything else was consistent with the recipe.

Even my husband loved this, and he doesn't like cooked carrots.  The only thing I did differently was to add honey during the simmer to match the vegetables with the rest of the meal.

Very good. I quadrupled the beans and carrots and I think double would be enough. Husband had seconds and it's good the next day reheated.

My family loves this! Make it every Thanksgiving. I do you a bit less butter and salt. Not much but I cut it a little! I also drain the liquid out of the mushroom and onions, or it becomes too watery.

It was super easy and delicious. It wasn't OMG delicious, but it is a good "safe" dish to make because basically everybody likes it. I took it to a party and every single person there had some. I think it was the only dish that appealed to everyone. It's not an attention getter, but it's a crowd pleaser.

Loved this side dish!  I added minced garlic, and instead of salt/seasoned salt/garlic salt, I added dried thyme and dried parsley, black pepper, and kosher sea salt.  It had a wonderful flavor!  will definitely make this again.

Delicious way to prepare green beans! I added twice as much green beans (1 lb) and steamed instead of boiled. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and a generous dash of cayenne pepper. Also, instead of 1/4C butter, I substituted 1Tbsp butter and 1Tbsp coconut oil. With double the green beans, the amount of salt indicated was okay, still pretty salty and I love my salt. I thought the sweetness of the onions and carrots really complimented the green beans. With purple onions, it makes a very pretty veggie dish.

Absolutely delicious side dish.  I think my only change was to use black pepper instead of white.  Served with a roasted chicken, wild mushroom couscous, and a large glass of wine!

This is a tasty dish with a very attractive presentation.  I did not add the carrots because I already had another carrot dish and still it was excellent.  Many postive comments from our family.  Think I will try adding garlic to the onions but the recipe did not have the feel of missing anything.  Did cut down on the butter and did not add the salt.  If people think it needs salt - they can add their own.  Will definitely make again.

A very tasty way to eat green beans, which our 5th grader recently declared a love of :)  I also only used Garlic Salt as the salt input and introduced minced garlic with the saute of onions and mushrooms.  My herb adds were thyme and sage.  Yummy and on the REPEAT list!!

I made this without the onion but I used onion powder to season it along with pepper, salt and garlic powder.

I cooked the green beans and carrots in a covered pan, keeping the green beans slightly crunchy. It was better than I thought, I will be making this again.

Awesome. Perfect blend of veggies. I also decided to steam the beans and carrots first, as well as use a little rosemary in the seasoning. Definitely will make it again!

This was absolutely delicious. I boiled the carrots about five minutes before I put in the green beans, and it all came out nice. I also skipped out the white pepper. The taste is explosive.

This tasted better than I thought.  I didn't have carrots or white pepper on hand.  I used black pepper and it still came out delicious.

I made this for Easter and it was delicious. I doubled the recipe, but only increased the butter to 3/8 cup. Also, I was out of seasoned salt so I used 1/2 tsp. of Emeril's Essence. This is a definite keeper.

I made this recipe exactly as submitted except I used my vegetable steamer for the green beans and carrots. Thank you for a great way to jazz up vegetables! Generally, getting fresh vegetables on the table is hard enough without enhancing them. This is a wonderful, simple way to turn everyday vegetables into a delicious treat. I should mention that I love green beans, carrots and mushrooms, so that helped. I'm guessing this would work with other vegetables as well.

This was a very nice addition to our Thanksgiving meal. I didn't measure the seasonings, just eyeballed them. I also diced the onions very small because I get grossed out by big slices of them in my food!

This recipe was really good.  I cooked it for Thanksgiving instead of green bean casserole.  It was my kids first time having fresh green beans and they both loved it!  The only thing different I did was to halve the amount of onions since my family isn't a huge fan of them.  Will definitely be making these again

I served this with Korean BBQ dinner, and everyone loved it. I used 1 Tablespoon less butter, and added a little bit of soy sauce at the end instead of adding salt to make it a little more oriental.  Super easy.  I will definitely make it again!  Thank you!

pretty good although I didn't pre-boil the beans & carrots so that they would be more firm; added extra fresh ground pepper and crushed red pepper flakes for an extra optional kick which turned out well

I used 1 cup of presliced carrots, 1/2 onion, 3 TBL butter and a bit of olive oil. The problem was the appearance! The mushrooms turned the onions brownish gray; very very, unappetizing. Luckily it wasn't for company. Guess I should rinse the mushrooms or saute just the onions first. Only added garlic powder, taste was ok, couldn't get over the appearance. Second day was worse. I individually rinsed all the green beans. I threw out all the gray onions, mushrooms and carrots. Changed the rating from 3 to 2.

We liked this very much. I used frozen farm fresh green beans and I only used the garlic salt. We found it plenty salty enough without the addition of the other 2 salts.

I am generally not a fan of green beans, but I really enjoyed this recipe. I used cooking spray rather than butter when I cooked the mushrooms and I threw in some garlic.

This recipe is perfect except for the excessive butter and salt. I used two tablespoons, and this was plenty. With the salts, I only used a quarter teaspoon of regular salt and kept all the others as per recipe. They were still too salty.

I was surprised by how tasty this dish was, so simple, but really good! I substituted olive oil for the butter and cut back a bit on the salt.  Instead of boiling the carrots and green beans, I just sauteed them a bit longer.  Loved it!

I had green beans but wanted to try something different but healthy. I forgot to buy mushrooms and cut back on the butter to 1 tablespoon. I also steamed the green beans and carrots instead of boil. I find that the green beans and carrots come out more crunchy and flavorful. It came out good and everybody else liked them, included my 12 year old daughter.

Update: Add a little ginger and a splash of soy at the end. Stir to heat - delish!!! You can definately use olive oil vs. the butter if you are watching your diet. I make this on a weekly basis. Great with grilled chicken or steak and especially fish.

This was surprisingly delicious!  I have a new favorite veggie side dish!   As written, this is too salty.  I will use about 1/2 next time.  You can always add more...much harder to take away.  Overall, this is a keeper and I'm sure I will serve it often.

This was great.  I used a bag of green beans and carrots from the produce section and microwaved that and added it to the shrooms and onion.  Yummy.  Thanks

I really love mushrooms and (big surprise here) the butter makes the mushrooms ten times better!! I enjoyed this medley. I personally am not a huge fan of salty mixes so I was happy to reserve a little of the seasoning - perfect for me:)

I love this combo of flavors. I used half the butter, and used baby portabellas for the mushrooms. The dual cooking of carrots and beans in one, then the mushrooms and onions in the other really makes this dish since you can make the texture just right. Healthy and pretty. I'll be making this often.

This was very good but I did tweak quite a bit based on what I had in my kitchen and to reduce the salt.  I didn't have carrots or onion so I added sliced multi colored peppers and onion powder.  I removed the regular salt and just used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  very tasty side dish.

Good recipe overall. Feel free to add peppers, cabbage, broccoli, etc. I use minced garlic instead of the powder and cook it with the onions, peppers and shrooms. Easy, freah and delicious! 
P.S. I dont really 'measure' the veggies. :)

This was a pretty good recipe. I didn't have any carrots so I left them out. I steamed the green beans and then threw them in the pan instead of boiling out all the nutrients. I used real minced garlic instead of garlic salt and just added some seasoning salt to taste and pepper (I only had black). It was good. It is almost the exact recipe I normally make just with mushrooms and onions except with green beans added. I liked the addition :) My version was a 5 - but I am rating yours a 3 because it seems like it would have been WAY to salty and used less healthy cooking techniques.

An incredible veggie dish with an irresistible flavor. I did use garlic cloves instead of the garlic salt to cook the mushrooms and also added extra virgin olive oil. Best way to go, do not overcook the green beans and carrots. Their crunchy texture will definetely make the difference once all the veggies are tossed together.

Seasoning was perfect, I may reduce the butter a little bit next time but we loved this blend of veggies.

I make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas - by request - for the last 5 years or so.  I reduce the salt, based on other reviews that I read - good idea!  Even my kids ask for it.  I tried a different green bean dish because I thought everyone was tired of this, and I had several ask why I didn't make this one - so it's back on the menu!  Thanks.

This was great! We accompanied this with some alderwood planked smoked salmon and sourdough bread. The only change I made was to half the recipe and used fresh garlic sauteed with the mushrooms and onion.  Will definitely keep in my list.

So delicious.  I am not much of a veggie eater, but this is something I would always enjoy!  I did omit regular salt and just used the seasoned salt, and subbed garlic powder for garlic salt per other reviewers commenting that there was too much salt.  I found it perfect after the switches!  Thank you!

This recipe was okay but I think maybe next time I will add minced garlic instead of garlic salt/powder for a more flavorful result.

I never thought of this combination of vegetable before.  It is excellent!  I simplified this recipe by using canned green beans and adding them during the last five minutes, used pre-cut matchstick carrots and cooked them with the onions and mushrooms.  Very tasty!

I do not use salt in cooking unless it is a pinch or a dash. This was still good without the seasoned salt. Thank you - my 4 year old liked it too.

This recipe seemed so simple so I just threw it together for a quick side with dinner.   It ended up being MY main course it was so yummy.  My husband could not stop raving and my 3 year old loved it.  A few modifications.. we don't like mushrooms so I left those out (and it was still delicious) and I was out of onion so I subbed a little onion powder.  Took the butter down to 2 TBSP and did about 3/4 of a pound of green beans with baby carrots cut in half.  I was simply amazed at the flavor.  Can't wait to try it with real onion.  I will use this again and again.  YUM!

Very tasty. Used fresh ingredients from the garden. It was all eaten up. I did use less salt than requested. Only used season salt, and just a quarter teaspoon.

This dish was a fabulous compliment to any flavorful main course.  Cooked in real, unsalted butter with minimal, if any, seasoning keeps it fresh and clean tasting.  The only difference in the way I prepared it was to keep the green beans whole.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my boyfriend and my son and we all agreed it was just average tasting.  For the work, and butter calories, I probably won't make it again.

Delicious!  I used baby carrots and 3/4 an onion, 1/2 sliced and 1/2 chopped.  I also used 1/8 of white pepper, simply because the recommended amount is usually too spicy for my family.  I normally dislike mushrooms, but in this, they are wonderful.  It will be a common dish in my kitchen when I return for my sophomore year at college.

I left out the carrots since I don't like them. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. I ate some of the mushrooms, but ultimately ended up throwing out most of it. I don't know why, but this did not taste good. Will not make again.

This is great way to fix green beans.  Next time I make this, I am going to cut back on the butter a little (maybe 2 tbsp.)  I thought it was just a little oily, however, the rest of my family didn't think so.

A nice twist on boiled beans and carrots.  Like many people, I cut the all the salts by half.  Next time I'll cut the cooking time a bit also, since I found the veggies a little overcooked for my taste.

Can you say staple?  These veges are the BEST!  Thank you so much, I'm never going back to plain steamed veges.  Thanks
