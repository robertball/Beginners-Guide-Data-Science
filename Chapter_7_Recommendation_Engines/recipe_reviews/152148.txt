I loved this recipe, it was simple to make and my husband loved it.  Just  make sure to use a mild cheddar, sharp overpowers the flavor of the cream of mushroom soup!

I used a bit more veggies than the recipe called for, and I also topped it with bread crumbs. Awesome!

We were impressed.  I took the footnote suggestion and used french fried onions instead of cheese. I used leftover rotisserie chicken.  It was great.  My husband told me to put it in the rotation.

This is a good  base recipe that  you can add  a  bit too to suit your tastes. Rethink if you don't much care for things made with oh the horror  cans  of soup, etc. Not for you.  But if you are like  most common yet good folk you  will appreciate the  guilty pleasure of it all. Used pennne pasta and healthy request cream  of mushroom soup since I don't want my toddler eating  msg  - then added poultry seasoning, a bit more ground pepper garlic and  onion. Also topped witht saltine and  a  drizzle of olive oil.  Good stuff.

This was a good quick dinner. I used leftover chicken from a roast chicken. Added 1/2 cup of sour cream, doubled the recipe, and used peas and carrots. For the topping I mixed leftover cheeses and bread crumbs. I also sauteed some diced onion, celery and garlic to give it an extra boost of flavor.

Made this tonight. I added a few ingredients of my own fresh carrots, peas, and corn. Also some fresh garlic and put bread crumbs on top of the cheese. seasoned the chicken with a little cayenne pepper. Turned out delicious.

This is not a "gourmet" meal but sure is comforting after a long, stressful day...when you really don't want to do any cooking.  I added some herbs, chopped garlic, seasoning salt, and Emeril's essence give it some more flavour.

Chicken noodle casserole came out good.  I doubled the recipe. For flavor just add 1 teaspoon each of salt, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, dried basil, dried parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme.  Cover the casserole with aluminum foil before popping it in the oven.

This is a solid - kid friendly recipe.  Comes together really fast especially if you have left over chicken or turkey.  Add whatever vegetables you like.  This is what I would call a "Kid / Family friendly recipe."

I tried this since I had the ingredients on hand.  This just tasted like alot of canned soup and frozen vegs mixed together.  I should have just warmed the soups and made grilled cheese sandwiches.

This is a great recipe. Instead of cream of Mushroom Soup I used cream of Potato Soup. It turned out great!

This is a good casserole. I used cream of chicken soup and added more seasonings like garlic powder and Italian seasonings. If made as is, I think it would have been too bland for my family's taste.

Great for the left over chicken. I changed a lot here but used the recipe more as a basic construct for what I needed. I used fresh  steamed veggies and twice the amount. Made a gravy out of chicken broth and used that in stead of the can of cream of mushroom. Added just a touch of milk and threw it all together. Bread crumbs mixed with shredded cheese was a good add in on top.

I used  no yolks egg noodles,skim milk and 2% cheddar to make it even less fattening & healthier. Tasted great(husband liked it too) and I had all ingredients on hand. Great, simple dinner!

I have made this a couple of times and the family loves it. At this point I do throw in a few extra spices and some chopped garlic. I also stir the cheddar into the mix, and then put some on top - bake covered in aluminum foil, removing it for the last 5 minutes or so. One reviewer said that she put in "Cheez Whiz" for the "extra zip". I'm not sure how that would make it better - Cheez Whiz has its own purpose, and cooking is not it. Very family friendly, easy to prepare, and quick and easy to make.

I chopped up leftover baked chicken and veggies I had hanging around-- peas, summer squash, zucchini and mushrooms. Added breadcrumbs. Used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar on top because that's all I had but it was still great.  This recipe is great for when you lots of veggies you need to use before they spoil!  Also I made it the night before so all I had to do was throw it in the oven before dinner.

Tasty and quick to put together. This is a great recipe if you're in a hurry one night. I did make a few changes, though. I added one small diced onion and a can of mushrooms. If I'd had the time, I would have made my own base rather than using a canned cream of mushroom soup. (I don't really like using canned soups and it's easy to make your own.) Still, my husband enjoyed this dish and it came together very quickly. For those reasons alone, I'd recommend it.

I made this in an iron skillet. Started out sautéing some onion and one Serrano pepper with the half the seeds.  I dumped all the other ingredients on top and stirred together (used rotisserie chicken).  I topped with cheese and crispy onions.  My husband and I thought it was somewhat like a chicken pot pie/chicken helper dish.  Not something you would make to impress someone but an easy, solid weeknight meal.   Next time I may use zucchini, broccoli or spinach instead of mixed vegetables.

I have a picky eater at home.  He loved it.  Both kids and the boyfriend were saying Oo and aaa the whole time.  It was great.  I didn't have too much of it because of all the cheese and pasta, but for the family it worked out well.  They asked to have it made again!

I enjoyed this! It was easy to make and was pretty tasty. I am obsessed with fried corn so I fried some before putting it in the dish. I'm sure this wasn't the healthiest thing to eat so It will probably be a long time before I make this again but it was good! I topped it with cheddar and shredded Parmesan.

THIS WAS GOOD, BUT NEEDED HELP. TO MAKE IT SNAPPIER, I ADDED SOME SOUR CREAM,(MINE IS HOMEMADE) WHITE WINE; MINCED GARLIC, CHOPPED ONION AND FRESH MUSHROOMS.....LEFT OUT THE BLACK PEPPER AND SUBSTITUED HEALTHY CAYENNE AND A FEW DROPS OF HOT SAUCE.  USED CRUSHED POTATO CHIPS SEASONED WITH GARLIC, ONION AND CHILI POWDER FOR THE TOPPING ON TOP OF THE GRATED CHEDDAR. YUM!/ arnetage 68

I actually received this recipe from my aunt and absolutely loved it.....I made a few adjustments though.... as I did not want too much cheese I omitted the cheddar cheese and used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs (progresso) and enough melted butter to make the crumbs moist (NOT DRENCHED) and used that as a topping .....also to cook the chicken breast i used my foreman grill as a healthier alternative to frying.......really simple and easy to make ....h

This was excellent for a quick meal with leftovers.  I made a few changed.  I used left over ham instead of chicken.  I sprinkles French's Crispy Fired Onions on top the last 5 minutes.  Everyone enjoyed it and would eat it again.

I made this and didn’t really care for the cream of mushroom soup. Next time I will exchange for cream of chicken. I wouldn’t put bread crumbs on top either just because it made the noodles dry. My parents loved it, but it was okay.

It’s a great base recipe, but I did kind of hijack it some. I prefer fresh ingredients so I did 4 cloves garlic, one stall celery, 1 carrot, 1/4 of a yellow bell pepper. I added a chicken bouillon cube, used cream of chicken, and added some plowboy seasoning yard bird, same I used on the leftover grilled chicken I used. Got rid of the parmesan, and used marble jack for the topping cheese. It was really good though and I definitely think I’ll make this again sometime!

Instead of using all frozen veggies I large diced fresh carrots, celery and onion and sauteed  them for a few minutes in butter. I had small amounts of frozen corn and frozen peas that I added to the pan for a moment too.  I used about half a bag of wide egg noodles. After assembling I put a layer of grated cheddar cheese over the top before baking, and as I put servings on plates I sprinkled them with French's Crispy Fried Onions. Sounds like a lot of changes to the original recipe but is basically the same and I think the original prep. method is probably really good too. My family all enjoyed it and dubbed it a "great comfort food!"

Definitely quick, especially if you use a cooked rotisserie chicken, etc, but it lacked a bit of “oomph” for our family. If I made again, I’d probably fry up some onions and add a bit more flavour.

I used broccoli,corn, and a few sliced carrots and added a half cup more milk because it seemed dry. I also added buttered bread crumbs with cheddar at the end.

This was pretty yummy but I made some modifications because I did not have the exact ingredients. I used left over cooked broccoli, zucchini, peas & corn instead of frozen veggies. I also sauteed about 1/2 c chopped onion with 1/2 t minced garlic and mixed that in. I cut the cheddar cheese in half & mixed it into the casserole then lightly sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on top. Would make this again. Quick, easy & yummy.

I love this easy dinner. I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of mushroom soup. I also added about 1/3 cup of sour cream. It made it very creamy. Great tasting and very easy to make. Yum!

I used chicken tenderloin and it had a little bit of grizzle in it for some reason.  Maybe I should have used chicken breast meat.  The flavor was good though.

A family member has a allergy to mushrooms so I substituted cream of chicken soup.  I also added some chicken base to boost the flavor and doubled the chicken ammount.  Otherwise it was delicious.

This recipe was great and so easy to make!  I used rotisserie chicken instead of cooking my own, and used a few tips from the reviews to add flavor - minced garlic, onion, celery and season salt.  It was great and will make this many times!

Solid recipe as a starting point. First run through, the only change I made was to add about 1/4C of Panko bread crumbs as a topping, along with the cheese described in the recipe.

For a fast and easy dinner, this is it. I use pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and add whatever veggies I have on hand. Mushrooms,
mixed vegetables, broccoli, etc.
Everyone loves it!

I  found this to be just OK,  needed more flavour. I added paprika,  but it needs something else. Next time I will add some Italian spice mix, and Worcestershire sauce.

Made this and it was excellent! I cooked a few strips of bacon when I cooked the cubed chicken until they were crispy, diced em up and tossed them in. Also added 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream. We doubled the recipe and yummmmm! **If you cover with foil the first half of baking and then remove, you have less chance of burning tge tops of the noodles.**

This was very good! I have to say I was skeptical since it was so simple but I'm glad I tried it. I used broccoli and cauliflower for the vegetables  and added garlic powder and onion powder . I used a white cheddar cheese. It was delicious! Next time I'll try adding the French onions  and maybe some extra mushrooms too.

Loved this recipe!  Was very easy to make.  I used leftover smoked chicken and added a 1/2 tsp of minced garlic.
It was really good and the family loved it too.

I found this to be a wonderful recipe,like others though I made some minor changes, instead of the 1/2 cup of milk I used a can of evaporated milk as I find it makes the casserole have a creamier texture.Like most of my main meals I do like to add a small amount of garlic powder. I also increased the amount of cheddar cheese from 1/2 to 3/4cup and added it to the top of of the casserole 15 min in so it had a chance to melt and seal in the moisture. The only criticism I would have is the baking time is too short to properly soften the frozen vegetables.

my family really enjoyed this! i added onions and a couple garlic cloves to the chicken while i was cooking it for some added flavour, and used a mixture of cheddar & mozzerella cheese for topping instead of just cheddar. it turned out really nice!!

Simple and a bit bland even with adding some mushrooms, garlic and a dash of cayenne pepper.

We liked it.  I added 1/4 sauteed-in-butter chopped onions and 1/2 cup rehydrated mixed dried mushrooms.  Very good and extended the meals I can get out of a rotisserie chicken.  Yay.

My husband and I both loved it. I made a mixture of butter and bread crumbs and sprinkled that on top prior to cooking, then omitted the cheddar. My mother will be having the leftovers for lunch. She's very excited as the assisted living facility serves "unpalatable" food - so she says. ;) I will try it with the cheddar next time. It sounds delicious. Thank you for sharing it with us.

So good and everyone loved it.  I cooked the chicken by boiling it then deboned.  I used the chicken water to cook the noodles.  I uses cheddar and pepper jack on top and crushed Ritz crackers.   So good.  I think I used three cups cooked noodles too.

This is an easy meal to use left-over chicken.  I used cream of chicken soup as my kids don't like cream of mushroom soup.  I also added a like more milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream to the soup/milk/chicken/vegetable mixture.  I also used 3 cups of noodles to stretch the casserole for 4 people.

Perfect for a quick meal.  This is not a gourmet meal, but a nice family comfort food.
