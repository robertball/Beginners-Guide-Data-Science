I made my own dry italian seasonings mix - check out the recipe for it at:   http://ppod.wordpress.com/2007/11/14/dry-italian-dressing-substitute/
I used the whole seasonings recipe amt in the sauce (next time i will use 80% of mixture), low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat cream cheese (i used a bit extra of the cream cheese) and the sherry.  We just loved it over egg noodles --  a keeper!!  Thanks.

Very easy slow cooker recipe.  I agree with everyone who has previously said this can turn out a tad salty.  It also is a very thick, dense sauce.  After it was done, I added water until it reached the consistency I wanted, which also helped reduce the saltiness.  So play with it to get what you want.  I enjoyed the suggestion to add broccoli - it needs something green to off-set the "whiteness" of the dish.  This is definitely something you  would want to serve "over" a bed of pasta, rice, vegetables, etc.  It reminds me of a very fancy Cream of Chicken soup.  My BF loves this all by itself, but then - he's easy to please!  Good recipe and I'll keep it as a great "go-to" meal when I don't have the time to do anything more complicated.  Thanks CHEFCATHY!

This a quick and tasty meal, great for busy days or hot summer days when you can't face turning on the oven. I like to use reduced fat cream cheese, Healthy Choice cream of chicken soup,  homemade italian dressing mix and white wine as well as sauteed fresh mushrooms, sliced onions and garlic. We like this over buttered pasta.

Very salty taste from the italian seasoning packet, would reccommend cutting that at least in half and I am a salt lover

Loved this ! Since we enjoy onions, thick slices of onion were layered on top of the chicken as it cooked, and to reduce the sodium a home made version of the Italian dressing mix was used along with reduced sodium soup.
 We chose to use lite sour cream and no fat cream cheese again as personal preference.
 This was Outstanding and would give it 10 stars if I could .

Just okay.  My finace like this better than I did.  I just realized that I used one package of dressing mix and eight ounces of cream cheese.  I liked the cooking method of cooking the chicken in the seasoning first, then adding the sauce.  I didn't care for the appearance (very WHITE) or the sodium (and I used less of the dressing).  I added a sprinkle of granulated garlic, dried parsley, and a tiny sprinkle of cayenne.  We served this with egg noodles and broccoli.  I stirred the leftovers together (chicken, noodles, and broccoli) and actually think it was better than the original, but we are big broccoli fans.

Not bad! I cooked the chicken in the italian dressing along with the butter and I think next time I make it I will not include as much sherry or cream cheese. The sherry was a bit overpowering and the cream cheese made it a little more richer and personally, not worth the added calories.

So, I decided to change it up a bit.  I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing, grilled it, and shredded it before putting it in the slow cooker.  I used less dry Italian dressing mix and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet white wine, instead of sherry.  I mixed it all together with some pasta shells and served it up.  Absolutely wonderful!

This was excellent!  I could have sat there and just eaten the sauce!  Some of us ate it over white rice, some over bread.   Used slightly less dry sherry, as I was afraid of overpowering it.  Also made my own Italian salad dressing mix, as another reviewer had shared, and fussed with the amount included a little.  Thank you for sharing this - will be making again!

Made this tonight but the four to five hours was way to long as the butter burnt on the bottom of the crock pot but I managed to salvage the meal anyway.  In addition to the soup mixture, I think next time the mixture should include some chicken stock to thin it out a bit and perhaps add some stock in the pot while the chicken is cooking so the butter would not burn.  It really needs to be "kicked up a notch" with maybe a pinch of ground red pepper and some chopped garlic.  The "sauce" was much to thick as is so I think the addition of the stock would help.  It's a good basic recipe but needs some culinary imagination.

I am on this site daily looking for something fast, easy and different and of course tasty to make for dinner.  This was absolutely the easiest, most delicious recipe ive come across in a long time. My kids, who dont like anything loved it... (that's a huge compliment).  I used neufchatel cheese to cut down on fat and low fat creme of chicken soup.  The sauce is rich and delicious.  I served with white rice and steamed carrots on the side.  I might try adding frozed green peas next time, but the recipe is perfect the way it is. couldnt have been easier too. thanks for sharing !

We did not like this recipe at all.  The flavors of the sherry and the Italian seasoning did not jive.  My husband and I ended up just eating egg noodles and the veggie side that night for dinner.

My husband raved about this sauce-better than Olive Garden!  It is quick and easy to just whip up the sauce and quick saute chicken, cook some noodles and then put together.

Four stars for ease and texture.  Loved how it went together easily.  Made it exactly as listed this time. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll zip it up with some herbs and spices.  I like my food to dance, and sing and this just needs some more pep.  It's a great base though - four stars for giving me a solid start!

I made this today and kept adding chicken bouillon because it was so dry.  Served over bow tie pasta and I couldn't eat it.  I am very discriminate about my food and this did not make the list!  Hubby said it was okay and ate my leftovers.  Hoping it was good, because it was so easy, but will not be making again.

You can leave out the sherry. Salt and pepper the chicken when it cooks in the butter.

I have made this recipe dozens of times.  The only thing I have changed is I do not add the butter (have done it both ways and cannot tell a difference).  I use lowfat cream cheese also!  Huge hit with my family including my three year old who asks for seconds!

This was good but salty.  I think it was the packaged Italian Dressing mix.  Would substitute with the home made version mentioned in other reviews.

My husband loved this!! Me, not so much. I used real sherry, from bevmo, so there was no salty taste (cooking sherry is all sodium), but the sherry was so strong, and it's not my preferred taste.  The chicken itself was great though, cooked perfectly. Next time I'll try chicken broth instead of the sherry.

Very simple and easy slow cooker meal. Served ours over some jasmine rice. Don't use store bought Italian seasoning mix WAY too salty, make your own or use a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch mix. I added maybe 2/3 of the package but I did use 6oz of cream cheese in the sauce. Served it with some steamed fresh broccoli.

It's okay, but thick and VERY salty. Next time I will take the advice of others and half the packet of seasoning. I will also dilute with chicken broth to make it a little more creamy. Besides the saltiness this tasted good.

This would be a very good,comforting recipe...but it is very, ,very salty.  If I were to make it again, I would use less Italian seasoning.  I also baked biscuits and  put the meal over them.

Definatly rich and way too thick for a sauce.  Needed to add milk and some chicken broth to thin it out so it could be used for a sauce over noodles.  It was simple and tasted fine, nothing overly special.

Very delicious. I made it for supper and everyone enjoyed it. I added a little bit of chicken broth to thin out the sauce. And instead of boiling the ingredients on a pan I went and softened the cream cheese then mixed the season and cream cheese and cream of chicken together put it in the slow cooker on high for an hour.

First thing Hubby said was, "This is salty." I'll make this again, but I'll reduce the Italian dressing, use reduced sodium soup, and add milk and maybe some water. I served this over rice.

This was delicious. I cannot have any dairy whatsoever so I used Tofutti cream cheese and made my own cream of chicken soup instead. My husband who can eat dairy said it was amazing.

Ive been making this for a long time...I have changed a few things, however...
I use chicken broth instead of sherry
zesty Italian dressing mix
Cream of mushroom instead of chicken 
and I use a whole stick of butter.

Typically serve over egg noodles with a veggie and bread....

I'm new to cooking and decided to make this for my parents.
I read the reviews and kept in mind that people have said that it was bland and too salty, so I made sure to constantly taste test, and add some things to it.
Keep in mind that I don't know much about what to add to things to add flavor to it, and I just had fun and experimented a little but not too much.

First, along with drizzling melted butter over the chicken, I also drizzled some Italian dressing over the chicken I've used to make the most simple Italian chicken I grew up having(marinade chicken breast in Italian dressing and bake it in the oven) and let it go on high for 4 hours.

For the sauce I used the 4 ounce cream cheese and 2 cans cream of chicken. I was lacking chicken broth but it was fine. 
It looked a little thick so I added a little water after I poured in the Italian seasoning in batches and constantly tasting to make sure it wasn't too salty. I also added in some parsley. 
There was a good bit of juices in the cooker, I didn't drain it, just poured the sauce in and mixed it.
Served it over fettuccine noodles. 

We all loved it, I'll be passing this recipe on to my big sister and I'll be making this again but next time I'm adding red and yellow peppers(we love peppers).

OMG this recipe is the most amazing new recipe I have made in a while!  It does not take as long as the recipe says (with a newer crock-pot).  I would recommend making this on a busy at-home day, as it does need a few check-ins. 

Along with most people, I did a few things differently. I used frozen chicken tenderloins (because that’s what I had) and added seasonings right away. I flipped & re-seasoned them after an hour on high, cut/broke up after another hour. I did not have the dressing mix, so I followed the comment that had the link to make your own – only I didn’t have everything so I eyeballed: garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, pepper, and subbed Mrs. Dash for the rest.  

When putting in the creams, I also added frozen broccoli florets, finely copped kale, and cut-up baby carrots. This added some much needed color & nutrients (and extra flavor cuz I love veggies)! Once it’s warmed up and boiling you’re ready to go! The carrots were still a bit crunchy, but that doesn’t bother me.  I layered over whole grain egg noodles and it was Amazing!

I double the soup and cream cheese, we love lots of sauce. Really good and easy. Love the fact that you can throw in the chicken breasts frozen like another reviewer suggested. How many times have we forgotten to take meat out of the freezer?

I made this according to the recipe the first time and it was way too salty, so I changed it up a bit the second time around. Instead of dressing mix I used garlic powder and a few different herbs that I like and it was much better. The leftovers freeze well, too.
