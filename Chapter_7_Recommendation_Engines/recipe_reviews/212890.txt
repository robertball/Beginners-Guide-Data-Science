I've made this several times to share with my son's school class - the kids love this!  Both candy canes as well as other various candies could be incorporated (ie M&Ms, sprinkles).  It also works well using melted white chocolate chips.   Dont hesitate to use microwaved popped popcorn as long as it does not have a lot of butter or salt - we make this recipe in batches of 2 - 3 bags at a time.  Here's a tip to mix this MESS FREE: generously Pam spray the inside of a large paper grocery bag.  Then fill with popped popcorn and pour the warm melted coating right on top (along with any other candies of choice).  Close top of bag and shake vigorously.  Pour the coated popcorn out onto a cookie sheet.  Once cooled, break apart and portion out into cellophane or plastic baggies.  Play around with colors by tinting melted white chocolate coating with food coloring then drizzling onto popcorn during the 'cooling' step mentioned above.

I would give these 10 stars if I could.  I tried the almond bark stuff but it didn't melt nicely so I melted white chocolate chips...mmmmmm....

I made this to give to coworkers. They loved it. A bit of a mess, but worth it. I used the bagged popcorn, and Andes peppermint crunch baking chips instead. I bought the white popcorn. 3 bags of popcorn,1/2 of the 10oz bag of Andes, & 1 12oz bag of white chocolate chips. I used the paper bag method to mix, like suggested in another review. Which seemed to be an easier way to mix. I did use my hand to mix after shaking the bag. It was a big hit!!

This is delicious! Laura, the amount is 4 oz. for chips or chocolate or whatever you use as a coating. Other posters are saying you can use more if you want.

I did not make this specific recipe but make white chocolate covered popcorn every year. EVERYONE asks for the recipe. When I give the recipe no one believes me because they think I did a lot of work. I love it! I always use microwave  popcorn. It is easy and the butter combined white the sweet is fabulous. I know adding the candy canes will be a new twist and be just as good. You gotta try this one!

This recipe was wonderful!  I was looking for something different to do rather then make popcorn balls.  My children loved it. The only thing different that I did was add a little more while chocolate, since my husband is a big lover of it.  Thank you for sharing, this will be added to our holiday treat traditions! As well as become a yummy gift for the neighborhood children :)

This is so addicting!  Such a great idea for popcorn!  My mom made 4 bags of popcorn with this and added in some m&m's in with it as well.  So good!  Crushing the candy canes real fine so that there aren't many chunks and giving it a nice subtle peppermint flavor it how I prefer it.  With the popcorn and m&m's, it would also be good adding in pretzels and peanuts to make a sweet n salty mix.  So good, thanks for this great recipe idea!

This is a great fun and delicious holiday treat for kids. I liked it too! Not too sweet either. One thing I would recommend is using a deep dutch oven to mix. I used my extra large mixing bowl which resulted in popcorn all over the counter. It gets your hands a little messy, but overall is very easy to whip up. I lightly crushed tiny peppermint pillow candies (about 2/3 of a cup) as I find canes are notoriously hard to crush evenly. I see this becoming an oft requested Christmas treat in my world!

Loved it!!! Used a popcorn popper and the kids loved it. Whizzed the candy canes in the magic bullet and it was perfect.  Easy to make but definitely not 40 servings, for us.  We made 3x to get 25 treat bags, and then another double batch for 13 smaller treat bags. Yum!

I'm giving five stars because it sounds like a recipe worthy of trying. Will make this great sounding treat this weekend with my six year old granddaughter.  Laura, what I'm planning to do is  start with  4 oz of vanilla chips in place of 4 oz of coating called for in recipe.  Will post a review after I make these.

I added Christmas M&Ms and peanuts to the mixture for some sweet and salty goodness. Also I followed some other reviewers' advice and used white chocolate chips. We loved it. But I had to divide it into two batches because I didn't have a big enough bowl for mixing. In one half, I sprinkled the candy cane, M&Ms, and peanuts into the popcorn while I was melting the chocolate. This doesn't work because the candy cane doesn't stick to the popcorn. Make sure to add the chocolate to the popcorn before the candy cane.

I used white chocolate chips instead of the almond bark and it worked just fine. I heated the white chocolate chips in the microwave and it was easy to get them to the right consistency. I used freshly popped popcorn from my Whirley Pop as opposed to bagged popcorn.

Great holiday treat!

This was very good. Subtle peppermint flavor, not overly sweet.  I used 2 bags of natural (lightly salted) microwave popcorn, 1/2 cup of melted white chocolate chips, and 5 crushed candy canes.  I took another reviewer's advice and used Pam on the inside of a large paper bag, dumped the hot popcorn in, poured on the melted chocolate and the peppermint crumbs.  Mix with your hands quickly, before the chocolate starts to harden and clump.  If you shake the bag too vigorously, you end up with more popcorn crumbs.

Delicious!!! I used a 3 ounce bag of unflavored microwave popcorn instead of the 1/2 cup air popped corn and I added an additional ounce of vanilla chips.  It was a perfect blend.

As for taste, this is a yummy and fun recipe.  Not to mention easy.  However, I wish it stated how many bags of popcorn vs. air popped popcorn.  I did 3 regular sized bags and ended up melting another 4oz. Of white chocolate chips.  And still, there was quite a bit of popcorn not covered with the chocolate and peppermint, which is fine cos I don't want it too sweet, but at the same time, a bit more would've been better.  So next time I will make 2 bags of popcorn and add 8 oz. of melted white chocolate chips.
