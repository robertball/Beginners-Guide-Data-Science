Yummy!  I made this for a NDC fundraiser.  I used alu foil cup cakes and followed the rest of the directions to the letter.  VERY easy to make and simply delicious.

This cake was really good. I made whipped cream at home and shaved some semisweet chocolate over the cream. Then topped individual pieces with the cream. I think the cake may be to dry without the cream, which is why I gave it a four.

This was just ok.  My husband thought it was too much chocolate though.  If you are a chocolate lover, might be good.  I probably won't make again.

I made this for a dinner at my husband's work.  Seems like everyone liked it and my husband and daughter said it was very good.  I don't like cherries so I am going on what they said!  It looked nice though and I would make it again since it was so easy.
