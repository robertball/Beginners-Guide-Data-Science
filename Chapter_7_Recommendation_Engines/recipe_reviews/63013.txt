Fantastic.  I made it for a friend who is a professional chef.  She loved it. The only change I made was to dot the squash with a pat of butter and sprinkle  of brown sugar before baking.

This was a delicious recipe.  Loved the apples and walnuts.  I think I would cover the squash when baking next time since it was not as moist as I prefer.  One could use sugarless maple syrup in lieu of making the syrup out of apple juice.

This was good. I used to eat my squash with loads of butter and brown sugar, but now I watch my diet. I made a few changes. I only used about a teaspoon of margarine, I used almond extract instead of maple flavoring (that's all I had), and I put in a shake of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.

Very tasty! Made this for a Christmas dinner two years ago and had requests to make it again for Easter. Must have been good to be remembered by a family of people who love to cook. I am new to cooking and found this recipe a bit time consuming, but very easy. For Easter, I'm putting the glaze over yams instead of squash.  Already did so once and it was very good.
