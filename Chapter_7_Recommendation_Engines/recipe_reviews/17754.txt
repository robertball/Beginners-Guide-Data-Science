Review update - after making many batches of this wonderful bread, I finally think I figured out where the "dry" reviews are coming from.  The bananas I used before were quite large.  The bananas this time were not as big and I only had the 3.  The batter turned out much stiffer than usual and I got a very dry loaf.  So use BIG bananas, or add extra if you have smaller bananas.  I guess a cup amount would be more accurate.

This recipe was delicious and quite easy to make, as promised. I used 2 eggs instead of 1, and added a tsp. of vanilla, but this was probably the moistest banana bread, and the slightly crisp outer crust was wonderful.

Excellent!  I added a handful of brown sugar (a trick my mom taught me for color and a nice crunch to the crust) and a dash of milk to thin it out a little.

The best banana bread ever!!! I've made several different recipes and they've always gotten rave reviews but NEVER has my 3 year old son wanted to eat it...this one he does! I doubled the batch using 5 medium over ripe bananas and adding 2 tsp vanilla, 4 Tbsp French Vanilla yogurt, and half yellow half white sugar. Filled one loaf pan for bread then added semi sweet chocolate chips to the remaning batter to make one dozen muffins. Reduced the temperature to 325 F. Muffins took 30 mins to cook and were perfect! Cooked the loaf for 30 mins, then covered with foil or 20 mins, removed the foil and baked another 10 mins for a total of one hour. Also, to make sure I had a nice moist loaf, after removing from the oven, I covered the loaf with foil for 30 mins...as I said before..PERFECT!!!!

I have made this literally 30 times.  It is the best ever.  Super moist and I find the more banana's the better.  This is my 2 year old's favorite thing to eat.  Even when he is sick this is the only thing he will eat.

This banana bread turned out great!  I have never made prettier banana bread.  I added an extra banana, a tsp. of vanilla and chopped walnuts.  I also took the advice of one reviewer and sprinkled brown sugar on top of the batter in order to create a crispy top. This bread was so moist and delicious.

My family just loves banana bread (especially our 2nd oldest son).  I lost my recipe for banana bread and was on the hunt for another one.  I found this one.  To tell the truth-it's better than my old one.  I've baked this several times and before it can cool off someone has sliced some and before you know it one loaf is gone!  I have a mini multipul loaf pan (which is great for my family-they feel like they have their own loaf) and then I have the jumbo muffin pan- I don't think I need to comment on that.  Made some the other day and our assistant pastor is relocating and he simply loves a special type of cookies and my jumbo  banana nut bread.  My daughter-in-law presented the two items to him as part of our church "send off".  I  have several friends (in different states) whom I have introduced them to this recipe and they love it.  There is one important items to remember-when baking the muffins or mini loaves CUT YOUR TIME IN HALF! I learned the hard way.  I now bake them for 25 to 30 minutes (they will not turn out dry).  Also an added ingrents (dried cranberries or coconut) what a nice surprise.  Most of the ingredients most bakers have on hand I buy bananas all of the time and keep them in the house.  The riper the better.  If you're looking for a banana bread recipe this one is it.  I'm in Chicago and snow is in the forcas for later today...I feel a bake on  coming on!! :)

This recipe came out great! Very moist and delicious. I added 2 eggs instead of 1 and added a little twist from the CREAMY BANANA BREAD recipe to this recipe. I mixed 2 TBSP of brown sugar, 2 tsp of cinnamon and 3/4c of chopped pecans together and only poured half of the batter into the pans. On top of the lower level of batter I poured the cinnamon/pecan mixture and then finished off pouring the remaining batter over the mixture. DELICIOUS!

Love this recipe.  Others have asked for a cup amount of mashed ripe banana.  I measured it to be just under 2 cups, which made this bread PERFECTly.  Also, I like to make mini loaves and wrap up for friends.  For the mini loaves, fill the pans to 3/4 capacity and bake for about 40 minutes in a 350 oven.  Just in case it wants to spill over your pans, be sure to place them on a foil lined cookie sheet while they bake.  I also like to have a crispy sugary top crust, by mixing some brown sugar, white sugar, and cinnamon together and sprinkling it over the batter just before baking.  Very delicious.

Oh my stars! This is the BEST banana bread I have had in years! When I made my loaf, I combined the butter & sugar, and then in a separate bowl I used 4 instead of 3 VERY ripe bananas(would have thrown them out they were so black if I had not made this banana bread)and combined them with the beaten egg before adding to the butter/sugar mixture. I ended up baking mine for about 1 hr and 10 minutes, or until the toothpick came out clean. It popped right out of the pan and-well, YUM! Very moist and flavorful. Thank you Janine for a great recipe! (I added the picture so you can see what mine turned out looking like)

It was pretty good but I think it needed more banana flavor and less baking soda. I followed the recipe exactly but the batter rose and rose and rose until it bubbled over and burned in the oven. So I might add banana or cut back on the B.Soda or something. It also took an extra 20 min to cook thru. It was better the next day too. But it has a great crust and texture.

I like this recipe.  I make it almost exactly except I fold in a few blueberries then top my batter with a sprinkle of turbinado sugar for an amazing sweet crust

WOW!  This banana bread is awesome!  I had to play with my oven temperature (gas stove) for the last 30 minutes because it was getting pretty brown and I still had batter in the center.  I turned it down to 325 for about 20 minutes and back up to 350 for last 10 minutes and it came out perfectly.  The instructions don't tell you but you need to insert a toothpick in the center to make sure it's fully baked.  I think the next time I make it, I'm going to chop up walnuts and put them in.  Other than that, it's wonderful!

I love this recipe! I was never a fan of banana bread but found myself with a bunch of bananas that were about to turn so I thought I'd give it a shot. It was simply amazing!!! It was the most moist banana bread I have every had with a little crispness to the crust. My alterations: 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 1/4 cup butter (the spirit of Paula Dean came over me :) ), 4 bananas, 2 oz activia light yogurt (very creamy), and covered with foil. Just took them out of the oven and my family is raving!!

I'm sure the recipe is good as written, but like many others, I made a lot of changes. I cut the recipe in 1/2 to make 6 (huge) muffins that were baked at 325* for 30 mins. I used all brown sugar, some cinnamon, 3 bananas, vanilla, and a whole egg. I also added 2 tbsp each of walnut and choc. chips. These are awesome. :)

Easy and delicious.  The outside was crunchy and the inside moist.  Even though it looked done on the outside before an hour, it needed to cook the full hour to bake the middle.  I added chopped walnuts and left out the added salt since I used salted butter.  I'll definitely make again.

GREAT RECIPE.  I add chocolate chips and pecans to this delicious bread. It is incredibly moist. Watch this bread while it is baking. You do not want to overbake it. I have made at leat 10 loaves and gave them to friends and family they keep asking for more. Try toasting the next day with butter>>>YUMMY

This banana bread turned out very good! After reading the reviews about it being dry I did what was suggested and used 2 eggs instead of 1 and 4 bananas instead of 3 and added a tsp. of vanillia. It was very moist and delish and I am a very picky eater.

I made this recipe twice in a few days to get rid of some nearly black bananas!  This is a good base recipe but, with some tweaking it can be perfect! The first time I followed the recipe exactly except I did add in a 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. The bread came out way too sweet and a bit dry.  The second time though, was a charm! I cut the sugar back to 2/3 cup, added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, added an additional egg and put the chocolate chips on top in the last 5 minutes of baking. = all problems solved. It was the best banana bread..so moist and fluffy and perfectly sweet!

My new favorite banana bread! It's not as dense as my old favorite. I make one minor change which is using 2 TBS butter, 2-3 TBS applesauce, and a few additions. I add 1tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg. Make sure your bananas are large, or use 4 smaller bananas.

Absolutely amazing! I used 3 bananas as instructed, used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 1/2 vanilla extract. I baked at 330 for 75 minutes and the top came out perfectly brown with the middle still staying nice and moist! Thank you for this recipe!

thanks janine, this recipe is awesome! i use half brown sugar, half white and added 1/4 c coconut and 1/2 c chopped walnuts, and it always turns out great! i do leave it in the oven for about 1hr 15 min, but it has never burned; only crusty goodness.

Easy, quick banana bread.  I used my electric hand mixer and first mashed the bananas, then used the same beaters (not a big deal!) to cream the margarine and sugar and rest of the ingredients.  Not a lot of clean up and it tasted delicious!

This banana bread was excellent! Turned out just like the recipe said it would - soft in the middle with a slightly chewy crust. I used all three bananas that were VERY ripe and I would do the same again. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. I made it in the morning and after letting it cool awhile, wrapped it up and put it in the refrigerator. The coolness really helps that banana flavor meld into the rest of the bread. Delicious! Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, Janine!

Loved this recipe, but I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't make it as is. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added an extra egg, and used 1/2 cup butter and teaspoon of vanilla. However, because my bananas weren't as ripe as I wanted, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used baby food bananas. Greatest suggestion ever!!! My hats off to her!!! 3 -4oz jars along with my not so ripe bananas. Turned out moist, and full of banana flavor! My family loved it! I made 2 loaves, added chocolate chips to one. That one was good, but the plain banana one was best. Finally, a banana bread recipe I will use. Thank You!  VLP

Today I made 2 versions of this bread, one w/walnuts & one w/peanut butter-chocolate chips. Both were quite good. To increase its nutritional value I used unsweetened applesauce & plain (Greek) yogurt instead of butter (as someone else suggested) & used white whole wheat flour and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. I will make this delicious and easy-to-make bread again!!

This is the easiest most delicious bread ever.  My 9 month old LOVES this bread.  I find the more bananas, the better.  I add a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon and it gives it just the right flavor!

like others, I made substitutions, but I thought it turned out delicious!!
I used 1 cup whole wheat flour (along with 1 cup all purpose), I used 4 large bananas, and instead of butter, I used 1/4c applesauce and added 1/4 cup yogurt.  I added 1tsp vanilla, cinnamon, and walnuts.
it was very moist and has a great flavor, but I feel that it needs the vanilla and cinnamon!!

I took some of the other reviewers advice and added about 3 Tablespoons of vanilla yogurt, 2 eggs instead of 1, and a table spoon of vanilla.  I also added my own touch by greasing the baking dish with butter and dusting the pan with cinnamon.  It came out great.  It only got 4 stars because without the added touches it is a bit dry.  But it is a great starting place.  Also make sure the bananas are veeeery ripe.  The blacker the banana the sweeter the finished product.

Very good basic banana bread recipe.  I used half brown sugar (to get that almost crystallized crust) and half Splenda (for less calories) as well as half whole wheat flour and it turned out beautifully.  Make sure you use very ripe bananas for an extra sweet quick bread!

I couldn't remember which banana bread recipe I liked the best, so I tried a bunch--and this one is definitely my favorite! So easy (only 1 bowl!), I made with my baby on my hip :) Very moist and flavorful. I did substitute half brown sugar for white and added vanilla and cinnamon to fit our tastes better.

I've been searching for the best banana bread and thought I had found it with all the great reviews. This one was good, but not GRRRRRRReat...it was not as moist as I had hoped for.  I'm still searching...

Much better the next day. So very easy to make too--took no time at all. I added a cup of mini chocolate chips. Did have to turn the temp down to 325 after the first 30 min, then baked an additional 6 minutes so it was completely done. Great texture & taste. Oh, and the banana taste isn't overpoweringly strong like other recipes.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I knew when I was making it that the butter to sugar ratio was off.  It ended up very dry and I did not over mix or over bake it.  The recipe needs another 1/4 cup of butter or applesauce.  I will stick to the Banana Sour Cream Bread recipe from this site.

I signed up to allrecipes just so I could say how much I love this banana bread! It's so delicious and so so easy, it's really a no brainer. It's perfectly cripsy on the outside but moist and light in the middle. Not dry at all and I only used 2 medium sized very ripe bananas. Love it!

I love this recipe. I usually do mine in muffin form. 
I decided to make a variation one day and here are my changes:
Oven 325 degrees for 20-25 Min (depends on the oven) Until golden brown on top. Also, you can stick a knife to make sure it comes out clean.
1 1/2 Cups of All-purpose flour
1/2 cup of Old fashioned oats
2-3 Tablespoons of mini mini chocolate chip. 
I took a picture of them too #26.

I hope you enjoy them if you make this variation too. 
I love this recipe and it has been the best one by far. 
Thanks!

The easiest and best recipe! I usually use about 6 bananas - makes it extra moist and sometime add in chocolate chips or peanut butter chips.

Perfect recipe.... I added butterscotch chips and a splash of cream and baked as muffins for 30 minutes.  I agree that you have to add an additional banana to make it a bit less dense.  It was more like a cake. FABULOUS!

I have used this as a base recipe for my banana bread over and over again. Usually I make my own little tweaks to the recipe here and there, either adding some nuts, or extracts, but this recipe has been my base starting point and it never fails. The only thing I would change is the white sugar to golden/brown sugar, but I always do that in my baking. Im not a big fan of dumping a cup of white sugar into my baking. Hurts my teeth just thinking about it, lol. Thank you to the person that posted this recipe. It has been a success at my house every time. I know the one thing I will never mess up is this banana bread. Its so easy and versatile.

Great and easy recipe.  I added an extra banana and some wheat germ, flaxseed, and bulgar.  Let the "dough" sit for about an hour to let the bulgar absorb some of the extra juices from the bananas.  Turned out awesome with a healthy kick!!

This was good.  I tried this recipe in particular because it uses less butter than just about every other recipe I've come across.  The result was a bread that was a bit rubbery for my taste.  I guess next time I'll use my standby recipe and just pretend it does not contain an entire stickof butter!

I followed the recipe exactly (other than adding 2 tsp vanilla) and it turned out quite bland.  There was just not enough banana flavor, which is strange due to the fact there are 3 bananas in the recipe.  I am surprised this recipe was rated so highly - I will not use it again.

Addictive! It was light and fluffy, unlike the many dense banana bread recipes I've tried. I used 3 large pretty rotten bananas. Since my bananas were so ripe, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (actually I used sucanat). I also used 2 tb. applesauce and 2 tb. butter instead of the full 1/4 c butter. I baked the bread in a 9x13 pan and served it topped with whipped cream and it was such a yummy but simple dessert! Thanks Janine!

very good, basic recipe I also used white & brown sugar I didn't have any problem with bread being dry - I also mashed bananas didn't let them become mush like very ripe ones often do.

this bread was very good.  But i'm always trying to cut back on sugar.  I replaced one cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of liquid honey.  Turned out great.

I LOVE this recipe!!!  I make it often, and I always have compliments.  I do add a 1/2 cup brown sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla and a 1/4 cup of milk to the recipe.  This is such a great bread, dense and full of banana flavor... sooooo good!  I make it in a mini loaf pan and they are the perfect size for my little ones.  I highly recommend this recipe!!!

Because I was searching for a moist very banana flavor,I read reviews from others and came up with a winner. I used 2eggs,1tsp.organic vanilla,4large organic bananas,a dash of salt and a handful of dark brown sugar. I also used organic flour and used real butter. The recipe made 2 mini loaves and 6 regular sized muffins. I had such a sweet full banana flavor and moist as moist could be. I shared a loaf with my best friend and she said:"your banana bread,its to die for!" Thank you ladies for all your input and Janine for a great basic recipe. I now have the recipe I have searched for so long!

Great tasting and easy recipe!!!   I followed a few tips from some of the reviews though.  I added about 2 tsp. of vanilla and an extra egg only because it seemed too thick. I mashed up the bananas but left them a little lumpy so there were lumps of bananas in my bread which was a great idea.  (not huge lumps, I just didn't "puree" the bananas).  Anyway, my whole family loved it and I will definately make it again.  I made one loaf and 6 muffins.  It didn't look like enough to make 2 loafs. - Just a little note to add, hope it helps!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Added 1/2 cup walnuts and raisins. Used 1/4 cup molasses and 1 Tbs. stevia for a sugar substitute.  Made it wheat-free by using 1/2 c. oat flour, 1/4 cup flax seed, and 1 1/4 c. rice flour.  Used canola oil instead of butter.  Turned out wonderfully!

I thought it was good but a tad dry, maybe I over baked... Not too sweet, but I used brown sugar instead of white.  Thanks!

This is hands down THE MOISTEST banana bread you will ever make! Make sure to use very ripe bananas - the peel should be speckled brown all over. Overall this was quick, easy, and fantastic. I used the recipe for muffins to bring to church - every single one was devoured within minutes.

Great easy, simple recipe. 
I used 1/4 brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar, and added some vanilla and cinnamon.  Tastes very banana-y and not too sweet.

I don't know what went wrong with this.  My loaf had kind of a swirl of something dark colored and bitter tasting in it.  Maybe the baking soda was not mixed well enough?  (Why would it be dark colored though?)  I believe the recipe should instruct you to sift together the flour, salt and baking powder for even distribution.  Even if the off taste is a result of my not mixing enough, I would still not rate it very high.  I felt it was not sweet enough and needs more banana flavor in it.  I used 3 large, very ripe bananas and 1/2 c white, 1/2 c  brown sugar.  It also took about 25 additional minutes to cook due to needing to reduce the oven temperature so the top  didn't burn.  Sorry, but I'd try a different recipe next time.  I have an oven thermometer, so I am very careful about the oven temp.

I'm not much of a baker but loved this recipe - perfectly crunchy on top and moist inside.  I added nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon - 1/2 tsp. each, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract and handful of chopped pecans.  Also used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar and white whole wheat flour.  Baked using 2 mini loaf pans (45 minutes @ 350).  Covered with foil the last 15 minutes to keep the top from getting too brown.

Wonderful flavor and very easy. I used melted butter for ease in mixing, and added l tsp vanilla. The recipe makes 2 mini loafs. As suggested by others I lowered the oven temperature to 325 and baked them for 45 minutes uncovered.  The outside was crunchy and the inside moist. Watch carefully, you don't want to overbake.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Delicious! Very rich tasting.  Also, very simple.  Has a very banana-ey flavor.  The only thing I addded was a litle bit of vanilla.  I also turned the temperature down to 300 after 30 minutes, then baked it another 50 on that temperature with a sheet of foil over the top (it was getting pretty brown, but then, my oven is hot). I checked it about every 15 minutes

Definitely a must have for the recipe box. :) Thanks a lot!

This loaf was very dense and had good banana flavor. It tasted like it had much more fat in it that what it has, but that was a good thing. I used half brown sugar and half white and added an extra banana because I had it. People at work inhaled it.

Bing, bang, boom. It is mixed and into the oven. Not a lot of muss and fuss like some of the the other recipes. Then, you come out with a loaf of DELICIOUS banana bread. Have given samples to friends and they all wanted the recipe.--- Might be nice to remind everyone that banana bread gets better if it isn't eaten the first day. Needs to sit a day or two to flavor through.

I made this recipe tonight but because I had several bananas that were given to me by a friend, I doubled the recipe and made a bunt size cake. In doubling the recipe I added 2 extra bananas for a total of 8 ripe bananas. I substituted 2/3 cup of brown sugar for the same amount of white sugar to get a somewhat crispy crust. I added some cinnamon to the batter and about 1 tsp. of vanilla. I must say, I have made banana bread before, but this one was nice and moist and slightly crispy crust on

This is my favorite banana bread recipe. It turns out great every time I make it.
Update: I've made this bread about 10 times now and still love this recipe. The secret is using very ripe bananas.

I hesitated making this banana bread for a long time, as the ratio of ingredients just seemed off to me - not enough eggs, not enough butter, no added flavouring - and I was always afraid it would turn out dry and floury. Well, I was wrong! It was very moist, with a crisp, rtrunchy crust, as promised, and an intense banana flavour. Perfect!

I made this recipe exactly as instructed. I never change things before trying a new recipe. This is absolutely fantastic!  I did bake them in bread pans of a different size and it only took 40 min. I also covered them in foil as another reviewer suggested afterwards for a while to make sure it didn't dry out. This is a moist, not too sweet bread that I will be making again. The only change I may make is more bananas. With the 3 small bananas that I used I would either go with large or 4 small next time.

I loved this recipe. I made a loaf for my husband and family and they loved it so I made two more and sent one back to his ship because he is in the navy and he says everyone raved over the bread and they are asking for more. I did put about 1/4 cups of chocolate chips though.

Loved this recipe! I added a 1/2 tbs vanilla & 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the batter, & sprinkled the top with a mix of white & brown sugars which gave it an extra crunch. Next time ill definitely be adding chopped pecans, which always gives a little crunch & make banana bread even better!

I had 4 medium bananas that needed used so in they all went! I also substituted 1/2 C. white and 1/2 C. brown sugar. Turned it down to 325 after about 40 min. and it need 30 more min. This was really good, but simple. I missed the walnuts.

Nice firm texture for spreading cream cheese on. It really needs three large bananas.  I had 2 large and a small, but it needs 3 large for more moisture and more flavor.

I only had one banana and supplemented with milk to make 1 cup (hence the 4-star rating--I didn't follow the recipe exactly) but it is still delicious! Baked in a 9x5 loaf pan at 325 for 50 minutes and it's perfect. Firm crust but not crunchy or burnt, and delicious with some Nutella spread on top!

My son just loves this and has turned into a 15 year old helper to coax me into choosing this as my baking choice.  I agree with a reviewer that a touch of brown sugar over the top is nice, and I like to sprinkle a bit of walnuts along with it.  But my first try was strictly following the recipe and made me a believer.

The best banana bread I have ever had, and I make a lot.

Changes I made: 
- doubled the eggs
- added 1/2 cup of brown sugar (instead of all white)
- added 1 cup bran muffin mix (instead of all flour)
- 1/8 cup milk 
- 1/4 cup walnuts

once all of this was done,  used the mixer and mixed all ingredients.

This recipe is so easy, so quick and a great basic recipe for add ons....To make this a 5* - do the following - 

1) Substitute the white sugar for 1c. packed light brown sugar
2) Add 1 t. of vanilla extract to creamed sugar/butter and banana mix
3) Add 1/2 c. - 3/4 c. walnuts or pecans

Today - I also added a little extra butter to really make the sugar and butter cream...The loaf turned out excellent.  Substituting the brown for white sugar gives the loaf more depth with the sweetness.

Apparently I'm in the minority here, but as written I feel that this is a 3.5 star recipe, IMO...This bread, for how simple it was and how few ingredients it used was good, but not the 'best'. I added in about 1 teaspoon of vanilla (glad I did, or I don't think it would've had any taste), but I feel that something else was missing, like cinnamon or brown sugar or something. I made these into muffins and got 17 regular sized. This would also be great with some kind of icing, which I plan to expierement with. I may try this again sometime, with changes. Thanks for sharing. :)

Pretty good!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla like some others did and added a bit of cinnamon too.  The top did start to get pretty dark, which I'm not a big fan of.  At 45 min I turned the heat down to 325 and moved it down lower in the oven.  Next time I might back at a lower temp earlier.

Easy and quick to make, I added walnuts to mine. The crust was perfect, crunchy and crispy, while the inside was moist and flavorful. I would make this again in a heart beat.

I originally rated this recipe 3 stars when I tasted it warm, but after having it later and it was still moist.. 4.  Not a 5 because it still lacks a richness in flavor that I think a 1tsp of vanilla extract, subbing brown for some of the white sugar, and a pinch of cinnamon might fix!  Good base!

SO delicious! Will definitely keep this as a go to banana bread recipe. Made a few changes....cut the sugar to 3/4 cup (1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup dark brown sugar), added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8th tsp allspice, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup of toasted coarsely chopped pecans. My 3 bananas I used measured to almost 1 1/2 cups so I didn't have a problem with dry bread. YUM!

WOW!  Yummy!  The more ripe the banana the better taste.  I made mini loafs.  8 to a pan.  I used a cookie scoop to put the batter in.  2 regular size scoops per loaf.  I experimented with them.  1 loaf - I chopped some walnuts and put on top before baking!  Kinda pushing them in a little.  5 out of 5 by my family.  I would give these as little gifts for friends or teachers.  Wrap them with a bow.  Very pretty!  On another I sprinkled brown sugar.  1 out of 5.  The sugar totally over powers the taste of the banana.  Not good at all.  Another just plain with no toppings.  4 out of 5.  Really good but the nut one we LOVED the best. I reduced the temp to 325 and cooked for 21 minutes.  ToothPick came out clean. This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever done!  Try it.  Quick and Easy!!

I had 2 bananas that would have spoiled soon, so I decided to try this recipe, except make a few minor changes: I used half whole wheat flour; I substituted some white sugar with brown... Also because I only had 2 bananas I used a little less flour & sugar! Next time I may add vanilla extract & nuts! I love allrecipes.com! It was awesome... both my 4yo & 1 yo agreed! I cant wait for the hubby to taste it!

This banana bread is basic, but very yummy.  I added a few tablespoons peanut buuter, used margarine instead of butter, used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and added a little extra baking soda (to make less dense bread).  Following another comment, I sprinkled brown sugar on top to brown it. It turned out perfect!

This has become my go-to recipe for banana bread; it's wonderful! I do add a bit of vanilla when I am adding in the eggs. A couple of suggestions for those having problems- one issue might be with the bananas themselves. Like others have said, use larger bananas. For a nice rich flavor and moist bread, you'll want to make sure the bananas are ripened to the point where they are nice and brown, & kind of "gooey" when you peel them. Some people even use black bananas. Also, be sure that you're not over-mixing the dough after you add the flour. I've also noticed that I usually have to bake this for an additional 10 minutes, but that may just be me. Yummy with chocolate chips, walnuts, or pecans!

I made it a tad more healthy, and swapped the 2c white flour for 1cup white, 2/3 cup whole wheat, 1/3 cup bran, and 2 tbsp gluten. I also used brown instead of white sugar (not that that's more healthy, just different). What GREAT results! Thank you for posting such an easy-to-make and flexible recipe!

This bread was fantastic.  I made the first loaf using black bananas from my freezer.  They were pretty much liquid (you get no banana chunks this way) and I made exactly as the recipes states.  It was delicious.  I made another loaf and tweaked it.  I greased my pan with butter and then sprinkled white sugar, tapping to get the excess out. Instead of 1 cup of white sugar, I used 1/2cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and mixed in a couple of shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I mixed in crushed walnuts into the final batter.  I liked my tweaked version better because it suits my taste but this basic recipe turns out a near perfect loaf.

I love banana bread and wanted to create my own special twist on this classic, so I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugars, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and about 2 tsp cinnamon. My loaf came out a wonderfully golden chestnut color from the brown sugar and cinnamon and tasted great. Delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream!

I've made this twice in two days! My family scarfs it up! The first time I added THREE bananas and they loved it. The second time I added all FIVE old bananas in my kitchen and it was even better!

The BEST banana bread! Added an extra egg, made the sugar half brown, half white, and greased the pan with butter and the bread was delicious! I should also say I only used two bananas and added the extra egg and a tsp. of vanilla to compensate. Made a delicious loaf of bread!

Really good. Crisp outside, soft, moist inside. I've made this several times and everyone keeps asking me to make it again. Make sure you watch it because it tends to brown too quickly on the ouside before it's done on the inside. I had to adjust the temp and put foil on it about halfway through. I added some walnuts and chocolate chips, plus a layer of brown sugar on the top. I also used 4 bananas instead of three.

A very good, basic banana bread recipe.  My family is really enjoying it.  I did add 3 bananas--I like a little more banana flavor in my bread.  Make this--it's easy and delicious!

I made muffins instead of bread the first time I used this recipe and used the suggestions from another user who had used chocolate chips, baked for 30 min. at 325 and they were amazing!!!!  I made bread today and used four bananas  suggested by other users and it was soo good.  This recipe is amazing and you can play with it and still get amazing results! This is the first thing I have ever baked ever and it was so easy and great! Great recipe!

So Good!!  I don't really know the number of bananas I used (because they were already mashed and frozen), but it was 1 1/2 cups worth, and mine turned out so tasty.  I made muffins instead of loaves, and didn't have any burning issues.

This is the best banana bread, I cut down the sugar a bit, and add egg whites instead of the whole egg, also if I don't have enough bananas to make the batter moist I throw in some applesauce. Delicious.

This banana bread is great! Fast and easy too. My family likes nuts so I chopped some and sprinkled them on top. I made six loaves and they all turned out nice. This is a recipe I will use from now on!

This was a good base for banana bread.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar, and also added cinnamon and vanilla.  I used a stoneware loaf pan and baked at 350 for 30 min, then covered with foil and lowered the temp to 300 and kept it in for another 45 min.  The bread was very dense, and had a good (but not fantastic) taste.  I think adding some roasted chopped pecans would be an excellent addition.

I was looking for an easy recipe to finish off the three bananas I had on hand, so I thought I would try this one. It turned out great, very tasty. I did add just a little bit of cinnamon, and some nuts. This is a keeper, I will make it many more times.

I used wheat flour instead of white, half white sugar and half brown, and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  The first time I made it, I baked for 40 min at 350 and 40 min at 300.  I loved how crunchy the outside was, but the inside dried out a little after a day or two.  The second time I made it, I made the same subs and additions as above, but also subbed applesauce for the butter.  I baked a little more than an hour at 325.  The outside wasn't crunchy, but the inside stayed moist after the frist day.

Made this yesterday and was very happy with the result.  Only change was adding a dash of vanilla, and leaving it to cook for an extra five minutes to make sure there were no doughy parts (I grew up with the doughy undercooked center because it was my mom's favorite part, but I prefer it cooked all the way through).  Was delicious!

Quick and easy.  Excellent bread that always gets rave reviews.  I find it comes out better in mini-pans.  If I make a large loaf, I do usually have to lower the temp as the recipe says, and cook longer.

I was a little disappointed in this, given the rave reviews. After an hour, the loaf was a lovely dark colour, but after letting it cool, found the middle uncooked. Next time I would use mini pans. The smell was wonderful, though.

We like to add chocolate chips! We automatically turn the oven down to 325 and add a little bit of time because it seems we always end up doing it anyway.

This is my go to recipe for banana bread.  But you really do have to use 3 large or 4 medium bananas to make sure it won't be dry.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and half cup of frozen blueberries. I also used coconut oil instead of butter to make it healthier. Before baking, I sprinkled the top with a teaspoon of sugar for a crunchy sweet finish.  Delicious!  Since ovens do vary, FYI, my oven needed extra 10 minutes of baking time.

Yes....first time ever making a bread, let alone, a banana bread. And it was awesome! My friends couldnt believe I made it (ha!). Best I ever tasted. 
If I were to add walnuts, for this recipe, what would the ratio be?

Disclaimer: I am NOT a baker. That being said, this was the easiest recipe to follow and the end result is A-MAZING!! I added the extra egg, a little extra banana (because mine were small) and a bit of cinnamon and my family LOVED it! I took some to work and got requests for some more. It's just GREAT!

This is my go to recipe for banana bread.  However, I reduce the fat by half by adding applesauce.  I personally think that this produces a more moist final product. The addition of the applesauce does not compromise the flavor at all.  Everything is better with chocolate, so I love to add a chopped up dark chocolate Dove Bar.  I have also used cut up canned peaches and caramel bee-bees which was different and really delicious.

So good! I make it for my roommates all the time because there are always bananas in the freezer. We do usually buy the bigger bananas, so three is okay, but if they are smaller I'll add a fourth. I always make it with chocolate chips and it is such a hit! The crust on top is deliciously crispy and the inside is perfect. The best!

I was looking for a simple banana bread recipe as I always have a few bananas that seem to ripen all at once.  The only thing I changed was I used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of butter, as I felt it was a healthier fat and my bread came out moist and delicious.   I made two mini loaves with this recipe. You could use any oil, Canola or vegetable.

This was EXACTLY the recipe that I was looking for! Made it as written, with the addition of a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and it was perfect- sweet, moist, and it rose nicely in a 9x5 pan, with a lovely rounded crown. My kids ATTACKED it. Great recipe- it's a keeper! Thank you!

Best ever banana bread. Soooooo good. I followed adjustments and added 1 tsp. lemon juice, extra 1/4 cup flour, and 1 tsp. baking power to recipe.  I also used 1 full cup of mashed bananas as directed.

Yes, this is the BEST banana bread recipe.  So easy and so good!  I substituted some brown sugar for the white (didn't measure, but probably about a third) and added about a half cup of mini chocolate chips.  Nuts would be wonderful in this too, but can't add due to allergies.  Sprinkled the top with some cinnamon sugar.  Took 70 minutes to bake in my oven, but it was worth the extra wait!

It was "okay". Definitely needs more moist ingredients, like yogurt or sour cream or something. I even minimized the flour but it still came out dry. I think I'll go back to my old banana bread recipe.

This bread is amazing. I don't even like bananas but I LOVE this bread. I made it exactly like the recipe said and it was perfect. It did take a little longer to bake through by about 5 minutes. I will definitely be making this bread again!

This is a really great basic recipe that is good as is, but I've also dressed it up with a bit of almond extract or 1/2 cap chopped up strawberries before and both were excellent.

Made this recipe first as the banana bread and loved it!  Just ate my first muffin from this recipe and it was delicious.  The recipe made 12 large muffins and the baking time was 25-30 minutes at 350 degrees.  A delicious and definitely the easiest banana bread/muffin recipe I have made to date!

I just made this banana bread and it really is great. I only had 1.5 bananas so I halved the reciped and put it in the oven for 25 minutes. My bananas were just ripe so I had to mush them up with my hands. Still really amazing, I will make this again.

The banana bread was delicious, inexpensive & easy to make, but it wasn't sweet enough for my family. I added an additional 1/4 cup of sugar, 2 tsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp vanilla & a dash of cinnamon to it and it's gotten rave reviews ever since.

Super easy to make and delicious. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to add some flare. May try nuts and nutmeg next time. If it's a little dry, just add more banana.

A definite keeper.  I accidentally added a whole stick of butter, but it was still really good.  Might add walnuts next time.  A very good use for the more ripe bananas.

Fantastic and easy recipe! I added an extra egg, 2 tbsp vanilla, 2 tbsp cinnamon. Make sure you have BIG bananas, or enough small ones to make a cup when mashed.

FINALLY, a banana bread that works for me!  This is the BEST I've ever had.  I substitute 1/4 cup of brown sugar for white, and add some chopped walnuts.  I've always had a problem before with banana breads being mushy in the middle, but not this one, it's PERFECT.

Make sure you use ripe bananas!! I didn't and the loaf came out too dense and the banana pieces got hard. I probably will not use this recipe again, even with ripe bananas. It was too dry and I like my crust a little more moist (I have another recipe with oil that I've used before and liked). But if you like a crispier crust, this will work for you.

This is a great basic banana bread. The only thing I changed was using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. I will definitely make this one again and possibly add nuts or mini chocolate chips for some extra "interest".

YUMMY!!! Very good recipe, I did add a few little things, only because I like lots of flavor in my banana bread...I used 4 small frozen banana's that I thawed, added a bit of orange peel, nutmeg & ginger to the banana's while thawing them out...I also used 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar...It was super moist and very tasty!!

This is absolutely divine!    I jazzed it up a little by adding 1 tsp vanilla and cinnamon in addition to a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and two handfuls of raisins.  I made the a decision not to eat any more (today) although I wanted to hoard the entire loaf for myself.    Will definitely be making again.  Thanks for sharing Janine!

Absolutely WONDERFUL bread...the best I've had. I made the batter into muffins, and added some sugar and chopped walnuts to the tops; they toasted as they baked, and the muffins were perfect after about 22 minutes. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!

Delicious banana bread!  I used some other peoples suggestions and used 2 eggs instead of one.  I added some chocolate chips (thats what my grandma always did)  and I used 4 normal sized bananas because 3 wasnt enough.  The result =  the best banana bread I've ever had. And for looks I sprinkled powdered sugar on the finished bread.  I will definately be passing this recipe on to my friends :)

LOVED THIS! So simple to make. I followed the directions but instead of doing 1 cup of white sugar, I did 3/4 white, 1/4 brown and the result was yum-o! I wasn't for sure how "mashed" I needed to get the bananas since I was just mashing them with my hands. I ended up leaving some chunks, which were delicious to bite into once the loaf was cooked!! Also, an hour was a bit too long for my loaf (but I do have a beast of an oven), so I'd keep a close eye on the color of the loaf as it is cooking. Next time I think I will bake for 55 or 56 minutes instead of the full hour. But without a doubt, I will be making this again!!!

Wow this was so simple, but yet so good.   Reading the other reviews I felt my bananas were not enough and so I added a can of pumpkin to complete the 3 loaves.    My husband, small kids, big kids and friends have devoured this.    Thank you for an easy recipe and I will now consider this to be my main one!

This is, by far, the BEST banana bread I have ever made or had the pleasure of eating! It's moist and delicious! I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon, but it's even great without that! Awesome recipe! Simple & delicious!

Great. I also make these in mini muffin tins so the kids can take them for snack. The recipe makes about 20-22 mini's and they take 10 minutes to cook! Absolutely a keeper, thanks!

This recipe meets all my criteria: fast,easy, kids like it and adaptable. I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg but otherwise made it as written. Next time I may add choc. chips but it's great as is too!

I did not change a thing in this recipe.  I finally found a banana bread recipe that is moist and not dry. Just follow the recipe and your bread will turn out fine.  No need to do any adjustments. My family loves the bread.  I will definitely bake more of the bread for Christmas gifts.

Too mushy. Followed directions and had to keep on baking it until the edges got too dark. But the center was still really soft.

My husband and son LOVED this!  I'm not much on banana bread (or anything like it), but I could even tell that it was good.  My hubby loved it so much that he didn't believe me when I told him this was my first time ever making banana bread.  Will definitely keep this recipe to use up bananas that don't otherwise get eaten!  I used 3 very, very, ripe bananas and an extra 1/2 of a very ripe one that my son didn't finish, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was PERFECT!

It's an overall good recipe but it came out dry and flaky. I should have read the reviews before making it. But overall, good recipe :)

This is the 2nd time I made this recipe and it's a great recipe.  This time I got a little more creative and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter and baked it a little over an hour (this varies according to your oven).  Turned out very good if you want that little chocolate "fix".

I adore this recipe. I always change it up just a little bit - 4 bananas, a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg, and 2 tsp of vanilla. My Swiss friends can't get enough of it.

Surprisingly for a first timer...My spouse and I love this recipe, even more than his moms...don't tell her! I took the advice of a few others and used less bp and added 1tsp salt, vanilla and cinnamon. As well I tried it with the applesauce rather than butter and it is AMAZING! NEVER using butter again!! Thanks for the recipe Janine! And thanks everyone else for the ideas!

Lovely bread, I also added white chocolate chips to this recipe, 3/4 cup. I reduced the heat to 300 degrees after the hour and cooked for a further 25 minutes. I then took other advise and kept the bread wrapped in foil for an hour before serving. It keeps the bread lovely and moist.

I put this recipe in my box 3 years ago and truly have no idea how many times I have made it. Wonderful recipe.

Update: after failing miserable with many zucchini bread recipes, I used this recipe substituting 1 1/2 cups shredded zucchini for the bananas and I now I finally have a go-to zucchini bread recipe!

I have such a horrible time getting my banana bread to bake thru the whole way without burning the outside but this was the first one that turned out great.  it was a little bland, but maybe i just didnt use enough bananas. will make again, with more.

loved this. im a beginner in the kitchen so i was VERY excited when this turned out so well. Very tasty, very moist. Although i did have to turn the temp down about 50 degrees for the middle to finish at the same time as the outside. Other than that, it was great.

I made it the first 3 or 4 times with an extra banana and egg, but last time did not have extra ingredients, so made as recipe called for, and it was so much better.  All I did was add a tsp of vanilla.   And used butter to grease the dish and it was perfect.  Did not have to turn oven down this time.  Stick with orig recipe!

This banana bread is amazing!  I half the sugar and put in a box of instant vanilla pudding mix to help keep the bread moist.  Comes out of the oven crispy outside but stays moist inside.  Freezes well, but doesn't stay crispy if it's been frozen.  Delicious!

Quite good! As others suggested, I baked it at 325. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour, added 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg. I also happened to replace half the sugar with honey, only because I had some very crystallized honey to use up, and that worked quite well. I will keep this recipe as a regular and will be eating this for breakfast tomorrow!

This was a really good recipe. Easy to do great for the kids! I added a little brown sugar for a darker color and it turned out great!

So easy, 5 stars because if you are like me and aren't much of a baker, this is a simple recipe! I was shocked how simple and great tasting this recipe was! My biggest fan, my 18 month old son and my husband! The bread went faster then it took to bake in the oven!

Very easy and very good.  I added more brown sugar and ground cinnamon.  Otherwise it was perfect.  Will definitely make again and also will add chopped nuts.

I made this bread following the recipe as is, with no changes and it was delicious!! I had all the ingredients on hand which was great (no trip to the store for buttermilk or pudding). The smell in the house taunted me or the whole hour it was cooking and the finished product did not disappoint! Perfect crisp crust on the outside and moist and dense inside. No need to try any other banana bread recipes- I will make this over & over!

This is the recipe we turn to again and again. Lower in fat than most banana bread recipes and terrific flavor. The crust gets slight crunchy and it ages beautifully!! Light and moist!

Great recipe . . . as previous reviewers have stated, be sure to use large bananas and/or 4 if they are medium to smaller in size.  I always add chopped pecans and bake in a metal pan--this does not bake well in glass loaf pans in my opinion.  I learned from my grandmother that banana bread needs to sit overnight--always tastes better the next day.  Don't know if there is any cooking logic behind it, but it works for me!

This was my first ever Bannana Bread, it was awesome!  Everyone loved it & the recipe couldn't have been more simple.  I read all the reader reviews and added vanilla & walnuts.  I can't wait for the next time we accidentally let the bannana's go "bad" so I can try this again.

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  Though it didn't turn out as sweet as I was expecting.  And I had to turn the temp down to avoid burning the top before the bread had cooked all the way through.  With a few little changes this recipe will be one that I use a lot.

This bread had great flavor and texture. I used 4 bananas since they were really small. It did take the entire time to cook and I did have to cover mine as it got quite brown.

After all the reviews, I was hoping for a spectacular bread.  Unfortunately, mine came out really dry.  Bummer!  Thanks for the recipe, but I'm going to keep looking for "my" banana bread recipe.

Yummy taste, really delicious banana flavor and aroma while baking. But it took about 1/2 hour longer to bake than the recipe said, and it ended up with a dark brown crust while the inside was still mushy. I turned down the oven like it suggested, but it didn't help. It ended up pretty brown everywhere except the center.

It is ok.  Not very sweet.  I even put 4 bananas in and they were very ripe!  I have made better banana bread, but thought with a name like Janine's Best Banana Bread it had to be better, I was wrong....

As advertised, this bread is crunchy on the outside and gooey in the middle.  Great texture and flavor.  I used white whole wheat flour for a healthier bread, and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar as one reviewer suggested.  Really, really good.

Loved this recipe!  My other recipe for Banana Bread called from buttermilk, which I never have on hand, or lots of bananas.  This one is easy to make at any time with things already in the kitchen.  And it is my favorite recipe so far!  The family is asking for seconds already.

Good, but not great. Made 4 mini loafs. I added chopped walnuts to the top. Next time would try another recipe or just add more bananas/moisture

I wanted a basic recipe to make my own changes.  I started with only 2 ripe bananas.
2c ap flour replaced with 1c ap flour, 1/2c wheat flour, 1/4c bran and 1/4c ground flax seed
1c white sugar replaced with 1/2c each white and brown sugar
also added 6oz vanilla soy yogurt
next batch will include some vanilla extract
Thank you for sharing!

Simply Amazing! I also recommend mixing in a little flax seed flower for added flare plus walnuts pieces on top. People will love you for baking this!

Awesome banana bread and very easy to make.  Added some spices (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg) and used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown.  Made my apartment smell delicious!

This is the best banana bread i ever made.. and I've made many from this website.  What makes me love this recipe is the little amount of butter it uses, yet manages to make a moist loaf that is light and fluffy, not dense. Most imporantly, it does not come out greasy.  

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (1/2 brown, 1/4 white) to reduce the sweetness and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I also baked them in muffin tins to reduce the cooking time.  My muffins turned out pale though.. I was hoping for a crunchy top so I turned on the broiler.

super easy, ingredients I had on hand, super yummy!!!

I did bake it at 325, as recommended by some others.  The mini loaf pans took ~45 minutes and the large pans took 1 hour.

I'd been craving some good banana bread for a few weeks, and had some nice ripe bananas in the fruit bowl, so I made this recipe tonight. It was delicious! Exactly what I was hoping for. I enjoyed it with a mug of hot chocolate. Yum, yum. Thanks so much!

Very good!  Nice crust and moist center.  Like others, I've found that it browns a little too quickly so I've decresed the baking temp to 325 and cover it with foil for part of the time.

Will be my go-to banana bread.  So simple and yummy.  I doubled recipe, using 3 bananas I had in freezer (thawed) and 3 greenish ones.  (I like that underripe taste).

This recipe tastes awesome- I could not get the middle of the bread to bake completely though; I think it is my fault because I added an extra banana, so do not do that!  Otherwise, the rest of the bread is fantastic.  I will make it again.

Very good.  I made some adjustments to my liking.  Half white sugar/ half brown sugar.  One teaspoon of cinnamon, one large handful of chopped walnuts.  Once the ingredients are in the pan and ready to bake I sprinkle cinnamon on the top.  My husband who has claimed not a fan of banana bread has changed his mind once I have made this recipe.

Thanks a bunch!

I've made this recipe tons of times, often with small variations (adding chocolate chips, nuts, or lemon essence) according to the season. Always a big hit. Goes well with vanilla ice cream.

A good recipe.  Better the next day than right out of the oven.  I added a tsp of vanilla and stir-ins such as raisins or wild blueberries.  Also used whole grain flour (1 c. WW pastry flour, 1 c. white whole wheat).  Very nice outcome.

My 12 year old son made this for me and it was Great! Very kid friendly/easy recipe  for him to follow. He did add 2 eggs instead of 1 and he mashed 1 banana and I thinly sliced 2 smaller ones instead of mashing them.(this was with a 10 serving recipe.)

It's a pretty good recipe and turned out great for banana muffins. I rated it a 4 because everything can be improved on.. but it was pretty good and simple! I used the 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and extra banana's like others suggested.  I also added some peanut butter to the sugar and butter mixture and a little bit of cocoa and oatmeal to the dry mix.  They turned out good.. cooked for about 45 mins in muffin tins.

It's baking now, but I wanted to write this review.  I'll adjust the rating when it comes out.  MODS: I used 1/2c white and 1/2c brown sugar.  Added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4c lowfat milk.  Batter seemed very thick....My 3 bananas had previously been frozen, maybe that's why?

Wow this is by far the best banana bread ive ever had! I followed the recipe exact, except i omitted the salt. I set the timer for 45 minutes on my stove then reduced the heat to 325 after the 45 min was over and finished cooking another 15 Thanks for the recipe I will definately use it again

I have made this bread a few times now and everytime it turns out perfect! My husband and I usually eat it all in one day! I did follow some other viewer's advice and use 1/2 c. of granulated sugar and 1/2 c. of brown sugar. As well as add some vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Thanks Janine!

This was ok. I have made it twice now. The first time I used more banana and it took forever to cook, finally came out very heavy and sticky. Made it with only three bananas this time, and it was the right texture. Still takes a long time to bake, definitely over an hour at 350. I do love the simplicity, things I always have on hand. Will use this as my default recipe from now on, with a few tweaks here and there. *Oh, this time I also did 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown. Perfect sweetness.

The ease of preparation and delicious taste of this bread makes it a winning recipe, although it was too sweet for my taste (and for the three other people who had it), so I would reduce the sugar or use half white, half light brown sugar.  Like others suggested, I used four bananas instead of three and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  However, the bread needed a good 1 hour and 10 minutes with the added ingredients...and yet it still turned out very moist!  I might also add some toasted, chopped pecans next time for additional taste and texture.  Still, an excellent recipe that was quick and simple to prepare, so it earns four stars.

Not bad, could have been a bit moister.  I thought the sweetness was perfect and it was a great way to use up some bananas that were on their way out.  Perfect in the morning with just a little butter.  I did use half brown sugar and half white and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again, just maybe add a little milk next time.

This bread is great. I've never made banana bread before and this was so easy and tasted so wonderful. I could hardly wait for it to come out of the oven. I only had 2 bananas so I added a jar of banana baby food in with the recipe and  I think it still came out great.

Well, I've never had banana bread before, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste like ideally, but I think this one is pretty good :) First, it looks beautiful, all golden and puffy, and I sprinkled it with sugar before baking to make it shiny. Very moist inside and just a little crispy outside. I added 1 tablespoon vanilla and a sprinkling of cinnamon for the taste, and used both white and light brown sugar to make it less sweet, although I'm not completely sure that this was necessary. Oops, and I've just realized that I got mixed up: I used baking powder instead of baking soda -that's probably why mine turned out so puffed up :). But I think the taste could still be improved -so next time I'll try to put one more banana, and maybe some chocolate chips, too.

Hi Janine, I love your recipe - the ingredients are always on hand. There is a small amount of butter and sugar and it still tastes fantastic! I use it every time I have 3 or 4 really ripe bananas on hand or from the freezer.  I usually add a 3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips and use lightly packed brown sugar which makes it less sweet and it is delicious. (better than the actual chocolate chip banana bread recipes, I think you add a tbsp of cocoa to make it darker bread) Thanks again.

I made 2 batches of the bread. Both were wonderful.  But, on the second batch I spilt the batter in two pans. I felt the bread cooked evenly through out, by splitting the batter.

Too floury for my taste. Hubby said it was OK after I had toasted and buttered his piece. Will keep looking for the banana bread of my dreams .Thanks anyway!

I follow the recipe exactly and it really is the best ever banana bread. I usually make it in a mini loaf pan (8 small loaves). Only bakes for ~15 mins. My family loves it, definitely recommend.

Added that 1 tsp of vanilla and took another reviewer's advice to sprinkle brown sugar on top.  (I also added some demerara sugar on top for crunch.)  I reduced the sugar  some, then, in the recipe  to compensate.  An outstanding banana bread (with a delectably crunchy crust on top).

Excellent and simple.  Was a little overcooked at 1 hour, but likely my oven running hot.  My bananas were super ripe and that helped the flavor.  I like that whenever I have extra bananas I will always have these basic ingredients on hand to make this bread.

I made it as written. 1 hour at 350 is way too long. I took it out of the oven after 45 minutes and it was over done. Outside was tough and inside was dry. I think by adjusting the temp and time, this could be really tasty.

Super moist and great flavor.  added a splash of vanilla and sprinkled on some brown sugar before baking. Created a super sweet and crispy top. Would definitely be making again.

I've made this 3 times. Twice w/o changes. Once I added some leftover chopped walnuts just to use them up. It was easy and great all 3 times. My only issue was the cook time. My oven is old, so it might be on my end. I've found 45 minutes to be enough in MY oven. Just keep an eye on it.

Tasty bread, I did use only 1/2 cup white sugar and added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup pecans- because I love nuts in my banana bread.  I would certainly make again.

I have made this bread a few times now and it is delicious.  Sometimes I have four bananas, sometimes five, no problem.  I have always used 2 eggs.  I have added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of baking powder to help it, here in Florida.

This actually wasn't dry at all! I was definitely pleased with the results. I also added orange juice to see if that would help moisten it. Don't know if that made a difference, but it still tasted as good as promised!

Used brown sugar instead of white (because that’s what I have in the pantry), like all other reviews crust is a little crunchy like how I like breads to be, the inside not too moist but soft. I dont mind if banana breads are not too moist as long as they’re not dry. This recipe I would highly recommend. Very good even without milk & vanilla extract like how I usually do it. My lil fella approves of it too. I added other things we have in pantry, in this case: frozen blueberries, walnuts & chocolate chips.

I loved the low sugar and a lower fat  bread.  I just wonder where the spices were. I added  a small apple and some spices- my Family loved it .  I will use this recipe in the future and just add pumpkin or apples or mix it up a bit.
Thank You for the recipe.  P.G.

Very moist.  I made cupcakes instead of a loaf.  I added vanilla,  cranberries, walnuts, and dark chocolate chips.  I also did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I did make a few without the additives and they were fantastic as is.  Great recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Omg this bread is delicious!!! I took advice from some other comments and did 2 eggs, 4 bananas, 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also did 3/4c white sugar and 1/4c brown sugar. I split this recipe into two smaller loaves and cooked for about 35 mins. I’ll definitely be making this again!

Very good, basic recipe! Caution against over mixing! I doubled the recipe, added 1 tsp vanilla, cut the sugar in half and used half coconut sugar(1/2 c coconut sugar + 1/2 c organic cane sugar), and added a handful of mini chocolate chips. Very tasty and plenty sweet! I’m hanging on to this one!

This is the only banana recipe I'll ever use!!! Sometimes I add walnuts cause my hubby & kids like it that way, but I can't eat walnuts.  I usually gotta make a double batch cause one is never enough lol. We also share the same name to lol

I have made this several times. I really enjoy it and so does my family! I also use 4 small bananas or 3 very large bananas. I also will add 1/2 vanilla pudding mix at the end and mix until just blended together. Makes a world of difference in the consistency. And I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and I use 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar and brown sugar  baking substitute mix. We love it!

I just made this and could only let it sit for 50 minutes before slicing off a piece [see: had it before my dinner lol], it is SO GOOD. It has none of the woes most reviewers mention - mind you, reviewers who didn't stick to the recipe exclusively in the first place. 
However, I did not ignore the fact that the one consistent negative was everyone's mention of its dryness and lack of moisture so I cut down on the main thing that would affect that, by halving the baking soda. 
I sprinkled my favorite streusel mix on top and let it go. It was brown at 45mins, I took it out at the 50 to glaze the top some more; Can you tell that at this point I'm really hoping those 4 reviewers who threw theirs away were just lunatics with heavy hands and everyone else who made 101 changes is annoying? Positive thoughts. 
I pulled this glistening brown baby out, with it's hard crisp edges.. lil brown cane sugar crystals clinging on for dear life - the smell, the texture, the moistness...delectable!  It does have that addictive bang to your taste buds, but that's the devil that is in white sugar. 
Make the recipe as is, just don't overmix. This might be in my Top 2 favorite PLAIN banana bread recipes - it's short ingredient list might make it #1, though.

I've made this recipe exactly as written and been VERY happy.  So my rating is totally legitimately for the exact recipe.  However I most often do half white/half brown sugar as one reviewer suggested and I like it.  The crust has a nice texture to it and soft bread on the inside.

Here are some variations I do.  One thing I've done is to throw in a cup of chocolate chips.  Usually I bake these in muffin tins rather than a loaf pan.  I usually get 12-18 muffins and bake at 350 for 20ish minutes.  This morning we tried something new.  My mom used to make Taste of Home's banana split muffins and I wanted to try doing something like it for a change of pace.  We did the half white/half brown sugar, I used 4 bananas because I had them, threw in half or so a can of crushed pineapple (I had some leftover in the fridge I wanted to use up), 1/2 cup of sweetened shredded coconut, 1 cup of chocolate chips and it made 18 muffins.  SO GOOD.  I loved it and the kids seemed to as well.  Will absolutely be trying this again sometime.

This was wicked good. Followed the recipe to a t but added 5 bananas. I put foil over bread after taking out of oven which did help to make it moist. Next time I`ll add some raisins and chocolate morsels.

This banana bread turned out very dry for me-- not a fan. The only way I could eat it was with butter slathered on top. I just read the comment that said large bananas are essential for this recipe, so I will probably try it again with more banana.

I've made this too many times to count, and each time it gets rave reviews. I like to use this recipe for muffins. I preheat the oven to 350 but turn it down to 325 for the bake. Add 1/4 tsp baking powder to the dry ingredients and stir in 1/2 c chocolate chips at the end. This recipe works great with herbal butters.

This recipe is basic and I tweaked it a bit. I added vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg and more bananas and I used a half cup each of organic granulated sugar and coconut palm sugar and it came out perfect.  I didn't try the recipe 'as is' though.

I made this recipe! It came out great. I had to make it gluten free and egg free. I used Ener-G Egg replacer and Bobs Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour. I also used 2 and 1/2 bananas. Will definitely use this recipe again!

Best banana bread I ever ate and definitely the best I've ever made.  Seemed the batter was dry though, so I did use 2 eggs instead of one.  Came out perfect.

Very good, but I followed the recipe exactly (I did add some chocolate chips), but found it a bit drier than others I've made.  I think I'll follow one of the reviewer's comments next time and add vanilla and an extra egg.

Added 1 more banana - glad I did.  Would have been dry without the extra banana.  3 really large bananas or 4 smaller ones would be better.

The sweetness is fine - I just like things less sweet than most people so for myself,  I will add less sugar next time.

I added 1 and 1/2 Tbsp of cocoa powder.  I also substituted shortening for the fat (to avoid dairy).
I divided the batter into 2 pans.  The pan shape and size seemed to make a difference re: doneness.    The thinner pan had overdone corners, but the standard size loaf pan is moist and evenly cooked.  Def would make again.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count.  I didn't really make any additional changes. So easy and it never disappoints.  It is as advertised.  Moist on the inside and crusty on the outside.  I usually make more than one and freeze it.  It is really good.

A good, solid banana bread recipe! Worked well for me as most recipes call for brown sugar and I had none on hand.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer, and made sure to use large bananas, and the bread did need another 20 minutes to bake.  The only other change I made was to throw in some chopped pecans I wanted to use up.  It tasted and looked great. I would definitely make it again.

I doubled the recipe and added a half empty bag of chocolate chips to one of the loaves. My 14 year old son loved it. He couldn't wait for the bananas I bought to ripen enough to make more loaves. Quick, easy, and delicious. I don't think I'll get the opportunity to try freezing them... there won't be any left!

I just made it and after reading a lot of recipes, I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  When I put it in loaf pan, I melted 2 Tbs butter, poured it on top, then added crumbled brown sugar all over before I baked it. OMG, sooo yummy!!

Loved the banana bread I made! It was easy to do and delicious! I added chopped walnuts to give it a crunchy texture. If your planning on making this banana bread ahead of time, I suggest you take out your egg earlier out of the fridge to allow the egg to become at room temperature. This will make the egg easier to wish and used for the banana bread.
Enjoy!

I have made this bread about six or seven times, and it hasn't failed me yet!! Awesome recipe!! I actually tried a Splenda swap today and my husband couldn't even tell and it cuts calories too!! The only thing I would say about the Splenda swap is that it cooks a bit faster... I pulled it out 6 minutes earlier and it was a tad dry according to my husband. The original recipe is always moist though!! Love it and thanks for sharing!!

This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as it is stated and it was very good, especially when you consider how simple it is.  I know I will always have the handful of ingredients needed when I have ripe bananas. Another reason it may have been dry for some is that they may not be measuring flour the correct way.  You have to spoon flour into a dry ingredients measuring cup and then level off with the back of a knife. Also, for the best taste, bananas have to be very,very ripe.

I doubled the recipe and used whole wheat flour, a cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, and a touch of milk.  Brought the mixture together but not over mixing, separated it, and added to one batch some left over peanut butter chips, and the other batch I used up some white chocolate chips and walnuts!   It turned out awesome.  Nice crust on the outside and soft and moist on the inside! Definitely will be using this recipe again .  Oh! And I baked it at 325, but my oven cooks hot!

I loved the fact that this recipe doesn't call for any oil or vanilla. It tastes great just as is - although I omitted the salt, as it is unnecessary. Nice banana flavour to this bread!

I think this recipe needs less flour to make it not be so dry. The taste is delicious but the bread texture is not what I was hoping for. I'm thinking about trying this recipe with adding oil and a little less flour to make it more moist. Otherwise, tasty!

Finally found the banana bread I was searching for! I followed some of the alternations from other comments- 2 eggs instead of 1, 2/3 cup of sugar instead of a whole cup. I added extra butter because it wasn't creaming very well so that became 1/4 cup butter to 1/2 cup. Also added 1/3 cup dried dates(presoaked in hot water, very sugary if you don't)into wet mix before adding dry ingredients.

I got delicious, thick, moist banana bread! This is the kind of banana bread that when I think "banana bread" I want! Great taste and texture. The only issue I found was the banana flavor slightly lacked to me and my family. Should I make it again I will probubly add an extra mashed banana to the mix. 

No issues in my oven doing 350 for 1 hour.

Just ate some, it's great. Ha! Ha! but like most posters I changed it a bit. I used soft margarine for butter and powdered sweetener for sugar. Can't taste the difference from the butter/sugar version my wife usually makes. And yes she agrees.

My go to recipe! I make it atleast once a week or more! Only I put 3, 4 oz jars of baby food bananas instead of fresh and it is always perfectly moist and stays that way! That's my little secret!

Awesome banana bread recipe! I use it all the time, and everyone loves it. It's moist and delicious and not difficult to make. I've added chopped pecans to make it banana nut bread, and even used it in a cupcake pan to make banana muffins (decrease cook time).

They looked pretty but tasted like pure baking soda and salt.  Something went very wrong.
I should have not stirred by hand and used the electric mixer.

This is a good recipe. I changed a few things based on recommendations. First, I baked it at 325 instead of 350. Second I added a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla to the wet mixture. I also added walnuts to the batter right before pouring it into the pan. The result was pretty good. Tasty and well textured. Overall, a good recipe I was just looking for something super dense and moist

Tried this recipe with my bread machine.  I made some mod.  Add only 2/3 cup of sugar, 2 eggs, 4 small bananas and one cup of trail mix.  It took 2 hours for my bread machine to bake it.  Bread is good, sweet with lots of fruit and nuts.  My only problem is the baking soda smell existing for long time.  Not sure why??  Maybe reduce the baking soda to 1/2 tea spoon?

I added several more bananas because I didn't feel 3 was enough. I also freeze the bananas as they get too ripe and when I have enough for bread, I thaw them and mashing is a breeze! Very tasty, definitely a hit when I make it! Very moist!

For those who think it's dry, I always add 1/4 cup or so of applesauce, very moist! I also add white chocolate chips or crushed Heath pieces...

I made a few changes to the recipe. Instead of white flour, I used wheat flour. I only added 1/2 cup of sugar
and added 1/2 cup of raisins instead. I used 2 eggs instead of 1. I also only used 2 bananas and added 1 cup of walnuts. I guess you can say I made a lot of changes.  It came out great!!!

6/8/13 - Easy to make, but a little dry/outside overcooked.
9/20/15 - Came out nice and moist this time. Baked for 60 min. Make sure you really mash the bananas, or you will get banana pieces in the bread. This bread was tasty, but I wasn't wowed.

Being a banana bread purist, I really loved this recipe.  The texture on the inside was moist and dense.  The outer crust baked to a beautiful golden brown with a slight rise in the center.  I'm not sure why anyone would "slice" the bananas unless you want those chunks in it which would alter the outcome.  I mashed mine.  I also added an additional egg and one teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe.  Next time I make this I'm going to add a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and a 1/2 cup of Craisins.  This is a keeper!

It was really dense and not a lot of flavor. I was hoping for something more moist with more of a banana flavor.

I made this with semi sweet chocolate chips and followed the changes submitted from the reviewers. I changed it by adding 1/2 c of white sugar, 1/2 c of brown sugar, (instead of all white sugar) 2 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon and added 5 bananas and semisweet chocolate chips and then followed the rest of the recipe with the other ingredients. It came out moist inside and crusty on the outside. I made this in a bundt pan since I thought it would overflow in my bread pan. I put cooking spray and floured it since it can come out of the pan easier. I wanted to add a white frosting but didn't since I wanted to try how it tastes. Next time I will try a white frosting but this will be my recipe for banana bread.

I added chopped pecans, chocolate chips and used 5 really, really bananas (why waste 2 of them?).  The taste of the banana bread is great!  I can't wait to make it again!  My husband and son LOVE it.

My go to banana bread recipe. Simple, easy, delicious. I've made it so many times I have it practically memorized. 
I usually cut way back on the sugar and use only a half cup and it still comes out great. Able to switch the white flour out for whole grain as well if you use a little bit less.

I love this recipe. Super moist and super easy to make. I did follow a suggestion that had me add a second egg and the tsp of vanilla and I also put in 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. What made this the best loaf I ever made was the fact I had just made banana crumb muffins from this site and I had leftover crumb so I put that on top. It was so yummy. So if you have the chance try it. It went over very well.

I just traded in my forever recipe for this one!  I love how moist this bread is and it tastes perfect...even without sitting overnight. My family is in love! Thanks so much for this wonderful, yet simple, recipe!

I liked this basic recipe but I always use vanilla and added 1.5 teaspoons vanilla and 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 white.  Then I made a crumb topping and this bread got rave reviews!!!

Awesome, exactly the flavor I wanted!  Moist, sweet, great banana taste.  Warm from the oven with butter=heaven! This replaced my old recipe card from years ago that I had lost so was so relieved to find this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I edited this recipe a little, but overall I think it's a great starter recipe.  I added an extra egg, so I had no problems with the end result being dry.  I also used 3/4 c brown sugar instead of 1 c white sugar.  It added a better crispness to the crust.  This is supposed to be a simple recipe, but I think it would benefit from perhaps a little cinnamon, and also a handful of nuts such as walnuts.  Will definitely make again with some additions!

It was really good! I just thought it was a little too sweet, but we still really liked it. I would just use less sugar if I make this recipe again. I substituted half of the AP flour with whole-wheat, which worked out well.

OMG-This is the best basic banana bread recipe! I tweaked the recipe a bit by using 5 small bananas, a tsp of vanilla and 1 1/2 c chocolate chips. It resulted in a very moist, dense bread. I will definately use this recipe again. Thank you!

This banana bread is the best. I have had friends call me up and ask for this. I add 1 cup a mini chololate chips to it and the kids love it, you need to cook it for 10 more minutes and lower the tempature by 25 degress and it turns out great ! Love it!

This is great! I do add 2 eggs and 4 medium bananas as well as a little less white sugar and a bit of brown sugar. I have also made these with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of AP flour and they turned out great. My 2 year old (as well as everyone else LOVES this bread). =)

I loved this as a basic base, which is what I wanted I was searching for.  I added a half cup of sour cream, a tsp. each of  nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, and I cut the amount of sugar in half. I also added a quarter cup of steel cut oats. The large muffins I made were moist and had a great flavor.

Best banana bread I've EVER had. Delicious, simple and couldn't be more moist. I did add vanilla extract to the mix, and sprinkled the top with brown sugar. The cooking time is perfect at 1 hr. Will definitely make again!

Great basic recipe. I doubled and made the following adjustments: used 9 smallish bananas, 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, approx 1 1/2 Tbsp real maple syrup, dollup of sour cream. One hr bake time was just about right for my oven, although i decreased to 315 after 45 min. Thanks!

Very good. A little more dense than other banana breads I have made, but still very good! I made mine in muffin tins, so I reduced baking time.

Perfect every time. I always use one extra banana and reduce the amount of sugar by at least 1/4 cup. The crunchy top is always a favorite. Excellent recipe!

Oh my gosh this was super moist and delicious! Everyone in my family, even the non-banana bread lovers, loved it!  I did add one extra banana because mine were medium sized.  I also, vanilla, about a teaspoon.  I baked mine in the mini loaf pan so I could easily share it with friends.  Anyway, delicious, will be saving this recipe!  Thank You.

Yum!  I made a double batch and put half in a muffin tin... they were done after about 25 minutes.  I added an extra banana because I had 3 frozen and 4 recently dropped and it was there.  I also added one extra egg making the total 3.  Plus I can't resist spices... 1 tsp cinnamon and some shakes of allspice since I'm low on cloves.  Thanks for sharing!

This is such a simple & easy recipe! My family loved it.  And usually I would make banana nut bread, but my 5 yr. old grandson won't eat a nut of any kind, so I just made the bread sans the nuts.  Next time I'll make a double batch!  Great recipe Janine...Thanks!

Best banana bread i ever baked! The only things i changed were that i added a teaspoon of vanilla and 2 eggs instead of one, and since i had smaller bananas i used 5 instead of 3. I baked it in a tube pan, then dusted with powdered sugar... delicious!!

Wow! So easy AND perfect! I did add some of a spice blend that I have called Apple Pie Spice which is ground cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves.

This turned out great! The only changes I made was, I used 1 1/2 cups of flour and 3/4 cup of sugar.

Very good. I used 4 bananas and the loaf was moist, but not too moist. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Remember to use over-ripe bananas as they mash up better than just ripe ones. I might try cutting back on the sugar next time...

honestly, i dont think i can give any banana bread a poor rating. banana bread is banana bread to me and its all very good.  this recipe was very tasty - not extremely moist, but still good.  i used 3 smaller bananas so i added a 4th decent size one...thought it might be too much, but definitely wasnt.  i could have probably cooked it a few minutes less too.  but all in all it really did turn out great!  thanks!

I did not change a thing!  This is absolutely the best recipe I have tried and super easy!  I made the batter into muffins and they were fantabulous!  I baked the muffins about 28 minutes.

I made it for an after new years party and it went before I could even get a piece. I would defiantly use 2 eggs and i added 1/4 cup light brown sugar and only baked 45 minutes.

I love this bread!  I actually replaced the sugar with Organic Sucanat, used 4 bananas, and substituted half the all-purpose flour with white wheat flour.  The results were fantastic, even with the substitutions.  I'll be making a lot more of this recipe in the future.

I tried the recipe last night.  I modified it a bit by adding two eggs and walnuts.  It turned out well!  However, it was too moist inside. I used 5 bananas. Could that be the cause?  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!    LadyCee

Love this recipe. I ended up using only a cup of flour and 3 1/2 bananas. Came out extra moist and super banana-ish. Thanks Janine!

This was very easy and very good. I made a few changes as some other people suggested and it turned out wonderful. I brought it for Thanksgiving as a little appetizer and everyone couldn't stop eating it. I added 2 egss, a little brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon, yummy! Thanks!

Exceptional and easy.  I used 3 medium size, ripe bananas.  I don't recommend using more than one egg as others have.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I added 1 tsp vanilla as others did.  I added a brown sugar topping that included cinnamon and nutmeg.  This gave the bread a nice, crumbly crust.  I too added walnuts.  This recipe needs very little alterations.  Thanks Janine!

I really like the fact that this recipe uses basic storecupboard ingredients and only a small amount of butter. This is a very moist bread which toasts beautifully. I'm going to try making in mini loaf tins next for gift baskets for my neighbours. Thankyou Janine.

An excellent recipe.  I had purchased some banana extract and was looking for a good banana bread recipe. I added a few drops of the extract to intensify the flavor and it was a hit at home and at the office. Spread some Panera Hazlenut Cream Cheese spread on it and it's AWESOME!!

Definitely the moistest Banana Bread I've come across, and it serves as a very good base recipe so you can add in all the extras you'd like.  I'll for sure me using this recipe again.

I have never had the urge to make homemade banana bread before, but I had three bananas that were too ripe for me to eat and I was feeling conservative, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and the finished product was superb!  My fiance and I have already polished off half a loaf (I just made it yesterday) and I don't think it will last through today!  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

Very easy to make, so that is a plus for me. It was okay, but I like my other banana bread recipe. I added only 2 bananas because that is what I had on hand, would have been better with 3, like the recipe asked for. It wasn't banana enough for me. I also added semi-sweet choc chips. Always adds more flavor, and very tasty.

This recipe was amazing.  I used a few extra bananas because there was no point to have 2 overripe bananas and it turned out perfect after 1 hour in the oven.  It's amazing toasted with a little butter :) and like others who have reviewed this recipe, my 3 year old liked it too!

I love this recipe, it is so easy to put together and the taste is amazing!!  I usually use 5 bananas, which makes it moister and I add two tablespoons of vanilla.  Having tried several different banana bread recipes this is by far my favorite!

the bread was good, but my problem was my fault for using a glass pan and forgetting to lower the temperature, so the bread came out burnt on the bottom but moist in the middle and top, I'm going to make again but in a metal pan

I really liked this banana and found it to be nice and moist. I did add a bit more banana as well.

This is a nice banana bread.  I only gave it 4 stars as I found it abit lacking in banana flavor and I even used a half cup more banana then the recipe called for.  I added 1tsp each of nutmeg and cinnamon and 1/2 cup of half & half cream and I also used 1-1/4 cup all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I'm sure I'll use this recipe again and maybe add some more banana.

This didn't turn out as well as expected.  It was too chewy for me.  It did taste good, just not a good texture.

Very good banana bread recipe! When my bananas start going too ripe, I throw them in the freezer. Then, whenever I have 3-4 (depending on size), I make this! I actually think thawed bananas work best, because they are practically liquid and you don't have to mash them.  I also throw in a handful of toasted pecans at my daughter's request.  We love this banana bread!

It's great- but I adjusted the recipe just a bit- I added 1 single serving box of raisins, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon... It was great! The whole family loves it!

This is great! I spaced out and forgot the salt (stupid me) but I'm sure it would be 5 stars with the salt. I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts and didn't change anything. Great suggestion with the temp change. THANKS!

This was an okay recipe.  Tasty, but not terrific.  I might have overcooked mine because it was a little dry.  I baked it one hour in a stoneware loaf pan, but I think 45-50 min. would be better because the bottom half of the loaf was much darker than the top half.

Substituted 2 tsp honey for 25g of the sugar and added some cinnamon. Took longer to cook than indicated, but was totally delicious.

I had absolutley no experience baking anything ever, and I was a success on the first try! It was a little bit over-cooked so now I put the oven on 300 for the last 30 mins every time and its perfect! My husband thinks im a hero! thanks!!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.. and it was great.  Though I think next time I will use some brown sugar and maybe some walnuts and one more banana... just to tweak it some.
But I will definitely make it again.

I thought it was great... The only thing I did different was put a couple crumbled walnuts on top... I also used to make a banana bread french toast recipe I found here the next morning. It was a hit with the guests!

Awesome. The most beautiful and tasty loaf of banana bread I've ever made. I love the crunchy crust.

This came out so beautiful. Unfortunately since I gave it as a house warming gift, I was unable to taste it, but it sure did look good. I added a topping of flour, brown sugar, butter and cinnamon to it. I want to make it again for us now!

this is amazing banana bread. i'm a vegan so i replaced the butter with a vegan margarine and the egg with some extra mashed banana and a pinch of baking powder. i also used half whole-wheat flour. i did have to bake it for a little longer because of the extra banana making it so moist, but it came out very nicely anyway.

This bread rocks!  Very moist in the middle and crunchy on the outside.  I couldn't stop eating it.  It's great with butter or peanut butter spread over it.  I did find that I had to decrease the temp. about halfway through as the outside was getting very brown.  This is a common problem when cooking banana bread.  Thank you, Janine.  I am putting this one in my recipe box...credited to you, of course!

Very easy basic Banana Bread recipe. I added a handful of walnut halves and baked it in a stoneware deep dish pie plate for 45 minutes and it was perfect.

This was a good, simple banana bread. The only changes I made was adding more cinnamon and one more banana. Very dense and moist, just like banana bread should be.

I doubled the recipe and added extra milk and vanilla based on others recommendations.  I thought it had very good flavor, but still was too dry for my tastes.

turned out well, with a great 'crust' on the top and moist on the inside.  i doubled the recipe, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and 3 eggs.  also added a little mild at the end, and walnuts.  it took longer to cook than an hour, but maybe i filled the pans too much.  the only slight change i'd make is to use less sugar... it's REALLY sweet

This was so fantastic!  We are not big banana fans in the family but I had some over-ripe ones that needed used.  Everyone loved this bread from a picky husband to the picky three year old.  Will for sure make again - and will double the recipe!  Thank you for submitting!

I planned on submitting a photo for this recipe, but I didn't get a chance to photograph it before my friends ate it all! Next time I might add a bit of milk to make it just a tiny bit more moist.

When I first mixed this batch together it looked a little dry, so in order to bring a little moistness to the recipe I added about 5 Tbsp of Milk which thinned it down, but no too much. It turned out GREAT! It was gone by the next day! What a wonderful recipe! I will definitely make it again...infact I'm about to make another right now!!!

This is good bread.  I added walnuts and a little vanilla to it.  I just ate a piece still warm out of the oven, and I think it might need to be a little bit more moist, so I might tweak it a bit next time.

So easy and turned out great. I added an extra egg yolk (accidently), a little cinnamon and a splash of vanilla. Sprinkled brown sugar on top. I'd recommend cooking this at a lower temp, as mine burned a tiny bit, even after reducing heat to 325 in the last 25 minutes. Very moist and not doughy...Thanks for this recipe!!

Great recipe... I added 1tsp vanilla and 1 cup of walnuts and made them into mini muffins.  My 2 1/2 yr old loved them!  Thank you!

This recipe gets big points for being so simple. I added some cinnamon and made three mini loaves. I baked them for about 45 minutes. They turned out moist with a lovely dark crust. I also sprinkled some poppy seeds on top to make them a bit prettier. Thanks Janine!

I added chocolate chips and vanilla as suggested.  Good. Next time I think half a cup of chocolate chips would be plenty and I'll increase the raisins -- they got lost in the chocolate taste.
