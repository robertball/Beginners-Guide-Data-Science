Everyone loved it! To Linda, one fourth cup equals 4 tablespoons.

I have tried this recipe, but I put in shredded carrots, black olives. small burpless cucumbers and small grape tomatoes. There is an error in the Mcormicks salad supreme the recipe calls for 4 tablespoons of the seasoning NOT 1/4 cup. It comes in a small spice container.
