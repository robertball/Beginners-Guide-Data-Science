Very smart base recipe! Polenta works wonderfully as a substitute for noodles, and makes the meal lighter and let the other ingredients used stand with their own flavors. I did mine in this order: layer of polenta, layer of pesto, layer of fresh spinach, layer of onions (1/2 of a white) and fresh tomatoes (about 7 romas), layer of ricotta cheese, layer of sauce, next layer of polenta,layer of mozzarella, then topped with pinenuts and fresh parmesean! It was fantastic and I may never eat noodle lasagna again!

Very tasty.  I improvised a bit.  I pre-baked the polenta to crisp it up a bit.  I also added fresh spinach, fresh toms, onions, and red bell peppers.  Will make again and maybe improvise some more.

This was excellent!  I used pizza sauce (that's all I had on hand),  sauteed spinach and onion in some olive oil and layered that over the pesto, then added cottage cheese (again, that's all I had on hand), then sauce, polenta and more sauce.  Before assembling the lasagna, I sprayed the polenta with Pam and baked it for about 8 mins, then put it under the broiler for about 5 mins each side.  That helped with the consistency, I think.  And I sprayed my pan with Pam instead of olive oil.  This was delicious and I will definitely make again.

This is a great alternative to using pasta. I purchased pre-cooked polenta but it was expensive and didn't provide me enough to make 2 layers unless I sliced the rounds thin. Next time, I'll make the polenta myself-it's easy and much cheaper. I sauteed garlic, onions, zucchini and mushrooms, mixed them into some ricotta and added that as an additional layer. The pine nuts on top provide the perfect finishing touch. Yumm...

My best friend is allergic to wheat and gluten. Polenta lasagna is one of our favorite main dishes to share at dinner parties, since all us wheat-eaters love it too. I've made variations with spianch, sun-dried tomatoes, itallian sausage, and ricotta - the dish lends itself very nicely to variations and is suprisingly quick to prepare.

Excellent.  Delicious.  Followed directions exactly except that my portions were off a bit:  16 ounces polenta; 32 ounces marinara (still used half).  Plus, served as a main dish, would not serve eight...at least not in my household.  My sixteen-ounce tube of purchased polenta stated four total servings on the nutritional label and that is what this casserole comfortably serves:  four.  We had a tossed Greek-style salad and green beans on the side.  We will definitely have this again.  We would like to try adding some veggies to make a total one dish meal: zucchini; onions; tomatoes; peppers?

Simple and deliscious. My one complaint is that the recipe calls for all pre-made ingredients (not always available). I made my own polenta (maise and water) and tomato sauce with spices. Since pre-made pesto is so expensive where I live, I dosed the tomatoe sauce with a lot of basil! Otherwise, polenta as a substitute for pasta is a great idea and a healthy alternative. Thanks for the idea!

I'm pretty sure I used too much pesto (oops!) and the result was extremely oily.  If using store bought pesto, be sure to mix well or even skim the oil off before using.  This would have been great otherwise.

I have made this twice, so quick to put together and nice flavor.  Have had several requests for the recipe. Lends itself nicely to add-ins ... mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes ... nice recipe, thank you.

We loved this, too - it satisfied our non-vegetarian family and our two toddlers quite well.  I sauteed some garlic, onion, mushrooms and fresh spinach together, added it to some ricotta and shredded parmesan cheese and added that layer just before the second layer of polenta.  I'll be making this again!

This was a good recipe but it needed tweaking. I saut√©ed veggies (onions, mushrooms, red pepper, and spinach), and roasted the polenta so that it would be a little crisper.

Turned out great.  Nice alternative to regular lasagna, we are adding it our rotation to break things up because we eat alot of pasta.  The polenta is a nice creamy alternative to noodles, otherwise it tasted just like lasagna.  It was easy to make using premade pesto, and packaged polenta.  I did use my own marinara sauce, but we always have that on hand so still very easy for a good home cooked meal!

wE ADD LAYERS OF SLICED COOKED ITALIAN SAUSUAGE AND SLICED HARD BOILED EGGS, PLUS. SOME SHREDDED ROMANO CHEESE.  HAVE NOT USED PINE NUTS BUT PLAN ON IT.  YOU CAN MAKE POLENTA BY MIXING ONE PART CORN MEAL WITH TWO PARTS SALTED WATER.  BRING TO BOIL. POUR OUT ONTO A COOKIE SHEET AND SHAPE INTO A LOG.  ALLLOW TO COMPLETELY COOL AND THEN SLICE AND USE.

This is a very good basic recipe starting with pre-made ingredients. However, I always have homemade marinara sauce in the freezer, and pesto is so simple to make. The packaged polenta is okay, but I do prefer to make my own. Also very simple to do. And many of these things can be made in advance and thrown together at the last minute. I think it's much easier to control the sodium content and also the "mystery ingredients" that are found in pre-made foods. Also, try adding some sauteed mushrooms on top of the sauce for a meaty "meatless" dish.

Delightfully delicous! I added fat free cottage cheese and (steamed and drained) spinach to the layers and some fresh basil, topped with a few slice black olives. My husband loves it, he took what was leftover to work for lunch and co-workers were so jealous! This is a keeper!

Most excellent recipe! I baked the polenta before assembling the lasagna, and I took the suggestion to layer with polenta, pesto, fresh spinach, fresh tomatoes, ricotta, sauce, next layer of polenta, mozzarella, then pinenuts and fresh parmesean!   I've already made it twice in 2 weeks. The first time I made my own pesto and sauteed the spinach. The second time I used pesto from a jar and just added the fresh spinach "raw" (to save on time). They both turned out great.   This one is a keeper!

So good! I threw the polenta under the broiler for a bit (both sides) to crisp it up before putting this together. I put some spinach in too, since I had some leftover, and added Romano to the mozzarella for more depth of flavor. The pine nuts get all toasty and make this recipe perfect!

Because I wasn't able to find polenta in my grocery store, I substituted gnocchi for this recipe and it came out wonderfully! I added some spinach to the layers (thanks for the suggestions fellow allrecipers). My recommendation is the following: If you're going to use premade pesto, make sure to drain the excess olive oil out of it first. Otherwise, the oils from the cheese and the pesto become very...how do you say...ah yes, overwhelming. I will totally make this again!

If you are trying to cut down on your gluten this is an excellent alternative.  Added in some fresh spinach,ricotta, black olives or whatever you have on hand.  Was super fast to put together!

Excellent base recipe for a very unique and delicious lasagna!  I added sauteed spinach, fresh basil and parmesan cheese to mine, and it was great.  Maybe we are just big eaters, but this made just enough for our family of 4...if you are trying to serve 8, I would double this recipe and make it in a 9 x 13 baking dish.

Made this for an office Christmas party and it was a hit! I used two layers of polenta and added a layer of fresh spinach w/minced onion sauteed in olive oil plus a layer of cottage cheese as others suggested. The pine nuts gave it extra texture but next time I may omit due to cost. Cook time was about twenty minutes longer than specified but result was a very easy flavorful dish I look forward to making again!

So good and different!  I browned the polenta first as well as some of the others.  My boyfriend loved it also.  I added a low fat cottage cheese layer to this as well.  I will for sure make this again!!!  Thanks for sharing!

I doubled this recipe to feed 8 people and it was very good!  The Trader Joe's polenta I used was pretty salty so I would advise against adding any extra salt to this dish.  Very good, easy and economical and perfect for a vegetarian dish.  I would give it four and a half stars if I could.

Delicious and simple, if not particularly healthy. Once it finished cooking, I tilted the pan as much to one side as I could without the contents sliding (glass Pyrex dish of prescribed size) and then used a paper towel to sop up the oil from the one side it had all poured towards. Probably tells you something about store-bought vs. fresh pesto, amounts of oil in them?!?! Might try just pulsing basil & garlic in a blender instead, with a titch of oil...it's cheaper that way, too. Did the baking-polenta-5-mins-each-side trick, too. Good texture. My sauce had mushrooms, fresh basil and garlic in it.

I changed this a lot. I made my own polenta. Then did layers of polenta, ricotta mixed with pesto, zucchini with onion and garlic, and ragu sauce. In the future, I would not salt my polenta heavily because combined with the pesto it was rather salty.

Fantastic and easy. We were looking for a new way to use Polenta and we found it. This took 10 minutes to prep and 30 total to cook. I added a layer of mushrooms and mariniated artichoke to each layer and it came out fantastic. Cut the mozerlla and pine nuts in half...WONDERFUL. Will be making again and again. A nice veggie dish.

I added spinach--much needed, made the dish--before the marinara layer. My family (includes a 5 and 7 yr old) loved it.
* It's a great gluten free comfort food. *
My husband hasn't stopped talking about it (days later) and wants me to make it when we visit relatives!

This was fantastic!  I live in Italy so the polenta was fresh and my pesto is from my favorite olive oil production company.  I sauted red onion, garlic and bell pepper to add to the marinara sauce.  For cheese I used cheddar and pepper jack and the pine nuts are a great crunch.  Will be making again!

i made this for company it was a huge hit with everyone.  The polenta was a hearty, creamy substitute for the noodles, which were not at all missed (and i'm a die-hard pasta lover).  I followed some advice of some others and made it like a traditional lasagna layering the polenta with sauteed spinach, onion and pancetta (cause everything's better with some bacon!), pesto, sauce, ricotta cheese, then more polenta, more sauce, mozzarella - baked the whole thing covered for 25 minutes then uncovered for 10.  i used my own sauce and made my own polenta:  mixed the entire box then spread it thin on a wax-covered cookie sheet.  I let it chill in the fridge for about an hour so it was easy to cut and use to layer the pan.

I instead of marinara sauce I used the same amount of Alfredo sauce and added 1/2 Cup of grated parmigiano reggiano. Marinara doesn't marry pesto very well.

This gets 5 stars for being easy and also for being a very creative use of polenta...and for tasting great.  I felt the pine nuts were too expensive so I used some chopped walnuts that I had, worked just fine.  I will definitely make this again...per my husband's request I will use more pesto next time.  Thanks!

This dish is great because it is quick and simple to make. I have made it three times and served it to people with completely different tastes and they all loved it. The third time I made it I added mushrooms, italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes to the sauce to give it a little more flavor. I will make this again!

This recipe is really, really delicious! I used pre-made Trader Joe's pesto and polenta, which I broiled for a few minutes on each side before layering in the other ingredients. I made a simple marinara sauce with canned tomatoes, onion, fresh parsley and spices. I added in frozen spinach (squeezed out extra water). For the cheese, I used some parmesan, mozzerella and fontina. Even with all the short cuts, it was fantastic. I'm sure if everything was fresh and made from scratch, it would be out of this world.

This is the recipe that made me write a review... my picky kids loved this- but I did doctor it a bit.  I followed previous ideas of adding layers.  Mine went polenta (oiled and baked first), ricotta (mixed with garlic, egg, salt, pepper and italian seasoning), pesto, spinach sauteed with caramelized onions (I keep them frozen in 1 cup amounts), sauce, mozzarella,polenta, sauce and more mozz then parmesan to coat.  My kids LOVED it and my husband had thirds.  We debated as to whether to add meat and we agreed that the meal did not need it.  Served with a yummy salad-  YUM!  Gave the recipe 4 stars because I changed it so much...

I doubled the pesto and added sauteed onions and garlic then breifly added spinach which I then layered in. There were no leftovers.

This recipe was great! I used the packaged polenta from Trader Joe's and also added some slices of eggplant as suggested by another reviewer. I browned the polenta before I put it in the pan and didn't find it to be too mushy- though with all the sauce and cheese I am not sure how crisp it could have been (I'm a beginner!). I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious! I added a few extras though. Instead of using all mozzarella cheese, I used half mozzarella and half fontina. I also added a layer of sauteed spinach, a layer of sauteed onions (1/2 a sweet onion) and a shallot, and a layer of eggplant (peeled and drained for 1 hour in a colander), I really enjoyed the texture of this dish. My partner is a HUGE meat eater (refuses to eat vegetarian food!) and he could believe that this didn't have meat in it. Definitely will make again.

The recipe as written seems a little bland or boring. I added a bunch of veggies like squash, spinach and mushrooms and it was very good. It would be much better with homemade sauce, but on a pinch works great. Also I did find the polenta got pretty mushy, im new at the polenta thing, next time I will try frying it up first.

Very easy and tasty, and the kids loved it.  I smashed up the polenta instead of slicing it, making it a little more like a casserole.

Great easy dish to make with everything I had on hand already.  I didn't have the tube-type polenta, so I made it with the cornmeal I had (3-1/2 c water to 1-1/4 c cornmeal).  Then I just spread the polenta in the pan, and by the time I got to the second layer, the rest of the polenta was cooled off enough to cut into slices for easier placement.  I sprinkled some of the mozzarella on top of the first layer as well because I love cheeeeeeeeeeeese. :)

Definitely an interesting take on lasagna but the proportions didn't work at all. I found it better to make individual layered stacks instead of trying to make a uniform lasagna.

I love this recipe.  The first time I made it I pretty much followed the recipe and it was really good.  Second time I made it I put on a layer of sliced portabella mushrooms, cut down on the cheese to lighten it up  and used vodka sauce.  It was great!  You can really throw in anything you like, use any kind of sauce you want and it will work.

I am a vegetarian and this was my first time using polenta at home! Duh! Although it didn't say to in the recipe, I lightly browned the polenta slices in a skillet before assembling the lasagna. I used an 8X8 dish. This only made 4 servings. I have enough pesto left and 1/2 a bag of the mozzerella, so I will buy another tube of polenta and make it again next week. You could also probably get away with using only 1/2 a jar of sauce and then you'd have all the ingredients for the second half on hand. This was really yummy the day of and reheated and was easy to make.

An absolutely fantastic and delicious change to Lasagna.  What a fun dish. We all loved it and I can't wait to try it out on company. I increased pine nuts to 1/2 cup and used 2 cups of mozzarella ( we love cheesey lasagna)

A very decent recipe on its own, but also a very good start if you feel like adding other ingredients to spiff it up!!  If you do make some adds, just keep in mind the moisture content and minimize where possible or use ingredients that may help absorb moisture or you run the risk of a very tasty lasagna soup!

I made my own Polenta, (1 c. corn meal, 4 c. water, 1 t. salt), poured it on an oiled, foil lined cookie sheet and spread it thin. After cooling, simply cut to size of casserole dish for layers - very easy and economical. Great recipe - added spinach.......will make again!

I tried this but changed it by adding sauteed kale, mushrooms and onions as a layer or texture. I made this as my Veggie dish for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit even the 6 year  old  and my  17 month old granddaughter  loved it! I am going do this again but make sure that I use all gluten free items to share with a co-worker who wanted to try it also. Thanks for sharing this dish!!!

I made a Vegan version and added a few things.  I also baked the Polenta for 8 minutes first. I made my own marinara (1 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, 2 chopped garlic cloves, 3 small yellow bell peppers chopped, 1 tbs each of Italian Seasoning and dried basil, bring to boil and simmer for 15 min.  I also added sliced mushrooms on both layers and a handful of sliced grape tomatoes on layer 2.  I used Vegan mozzarella and raw cashews (I didn't have any pine nuts).  This was so delicious.  I also made my own pesto (vegan version  with no cheese) so you can really taste the rich pesto.

Very good.  Used vegan cheese in order to make this dish 100% vegan. Also used two polenta logs to ensure it had a lasagne layered look.  Very filling!

Very quick receipe. I have not quite tasted it just yet.  Did a sample and it was good.  I added spinach like another reviewer.  Do be careful with the pesto. If you use leftover which has "coagulated", as it bakes it will make this dish quite juicy.  I had to pour some out.  I would recommend either warming up your pesto in the microwave if it has been in the fridge for a while.  The best thing to do is use a fresh jar where you can still stir it.

this was better than it reads.however be sure to use instant polenta stirring for 1/2 an hour is a bit much but almost worth it.tested it out on friends all went back for seconds.

YUM...SO GOOD!!!! Even my husband, who isn't crazy about polenta, loved this. I didn't measure the pesto or sauce, just put them on to my liking. This will definately be made again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I agree with many other reviewers!  Great basic recipe just waiting for additions of spinach, mushrooms, onions, etc.  While prebaking or frying the polenta would improve the texture I was impressed on just how firm it turned out.  Baking uncovered is probably what makes it keep its texture. I will definitely make this again as it did indeed take only 10 minutes to assemble.

Great base recipe! I agree with others, bake/crisp the polenta before putting this together.  I did it dairy free and it is still tasty.  I added spinach, mushrooms and roasted bell peppers...good recipe to play around with. Great for those eating gluten free!

This was excellent. I'm eating the leftovers now and loving it. I layered this right into my toaster oven dish, which is great for a hot day when you don't want the oven on. I did everything on the recipe and a few extras. Between layers of polenta I added mushrooms, garden fresh tomatoes, slices of an over-sized zucchini that I didn't know what else to do with, and an extra layer of cheese. I did an additional layer of pesto on top and used marinara sauce as a bottom layer on the pan. I also used sun-dried tomato pesto since it was all I had on-hand. I made it for a couple of friends and they absolutely loved it, as did I. I'll be on the lookout for more polenta recipes now!

The basic idea of this recipe is wonderful like the other members I varied it slightly by adding vegetarian sausage and spinach...it was killer...oh and I also layered the top layer with pesto and sauce along with the cheese and ommitted the nuts

I really liked this. I made my own polenta with herbs and assembled the lasagna the night before making it. I'm lazy so I sauted some onions, garlic, and zucchini (per other reviewers) and mixed in the pesto, the sauce, and some ricotta. I made layers of cheese as well as putting some parmesan on top with the pine nuts. I didn't broil and it was still golden and tasty. Next time I will probably not use the nuts, they didn't do much for me other than add a little crunch.

Oh, YUM!!!!!!!! This was my first experience making and eating polenta; it's delicious!!! I agree with an earlier review that this would go well with additions, that will be something I'll try next time. I made as is, except I used a canned 5-cheese sauce instead of marinara, and I sprinkled some garlic pepper and rosemary over the cheese before I returned it to the oven. I will DEFINITELY be making this again. Loved it!! Thanks!:)

This was great, but does not make 8 servings! I served it to 4 people and everybody said it wasn't enough for dinner.
Like somebody else suggested, I will add more ingredients (mushrooms, TVP) to make it a little more filling next time.

The second time making this, I baked my homemade polenta on parchment paper to the sizes I wanted to fit the pan. I took the advice of others and added roasted veg as well. 
The whole family raves over this recipe. Polenta Lasagna is now on our regular menu! What a great idea! Thank you.

My husband has Celiac disease and I was able to use gluten-free marinara sauce so it worked for us! We also used 1 cup of homemade pesto instead of 1/4 cup, and I used 1 1/2 cups of cheese instead of 1 cup. And we went without the nuts, since we didn't have any at the time I made it. It was oily (from the olive oil in the pesto) but it was so flavorful! We'll for sure make it again!

I never bought polenta or pesto before and it was a great way to use some leftover spaghetti sauce. Fun to make and I will make this again soon.

This was an absolutely delicious creation as well as unique! This recipe uses polenta in place of pasta which turned out pretty tasty. If you prepare this recipe as is, it will only take several minutes to assemble.

This is one of very few recipes using prepared polenta that I really like.  The baking/broiling suggested by Eblueiz11 on May 27, 2008 is primarily responsible, I think.

I thought this recipe was just ok even with modifications.  It may have been that I didn't use enough polenta b/c I couldn't tell it was even there.  I just tasted sauce and cheese.

the flavors were great i just wanted to "taste" more of the base.  next time i will def use more polenta!  oh and having never worked with polenta before i had no idea it was encased in a liquid...a slight surprise when i opened the package.

Polenta in this recipe was a great, healthier substitute for noodles. I also made some other changes to the recipe to make it my own and it came out very tasty and filling. I omitted the pesto and pine nuts and instead I cooked some chopped onion, garlic and spinach in a skillet and added some sliced up chicken sausage too. Turned out wonderful!

I like that this recipe is super-simple and looks great, but I find the flavor a bit lacking. The nuts give it a bit of crunch, but I'd definitely put more next time. I'm just not too crazy about how it tastes, but it's still good to keep on hand for a quick dinner. Also mine turned out really oily...maybe I put too much pesto.

This was definitely very tasty, and it is a versatile recipe - I added a layer of vegetarian Morningstar Italian sausage, and sauteed mushrooms, spinach, and onion.  But somehow this came out more liquidy than intended.  It was still delicious, but it almost became more of a stew once I put it on my plate than a lasagna!

This is the best thing I've tasted in a long time.  I made only minor adjustments but I'm sure I would have been just as happy with the recipe as written.  (however, I made my own polenta as opposed to using the refrigerated premade kind - I've never had that and I'm not sure how it compares to homemade)

As many of the other reviews have said, this was a great base recipe.  I added sauteed mushrooms with garlic above each layer of sauces, also, I used the cheese in all the layers, not just on top.  For the top layer of cheese (with the pine nuts) I added some fresh grated parmesan.  Overall, lovely dish when you add some extra veggies and cheese.

Polenta rocks. I love using it in baked dishes as a replacement for noodles. Although I altered this recipe to suite my taste it is still a very good base recipe. Particularly good with Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site.

This was awesome!!!  I didn't have any pine nuts, but they probably would have been great to add some crunch, I'll have to make sure I have some on hand next time.  I did add a layer of baby bella mushrooms because my hubby and I both love mushrooms and I had them in the fridge for a while and they needed to be used...mushrooms make everything better  :-)  Thanks so much for a great recipe.  I think next time I'm going to try to make my own polenta too!

Delicious. Between the two layers of polenta, I added large chunks of onion, spinach, and more mozzarella.  I used a three cheese pasta sauce.  Tasted fantastic and was super easy, too.

I made this unique twist on Lasagna with some of the suggestion by Maezystar (thanks)layering polenta, onions, spinach, pesto, tomatoes...of course cheeses and pine nuts and then, baked it on my new gas grill!  it was incredible receiving rave reviews from all my family several of which are not vegetarians!  tasty alternative to pasta~

Very good. I did half mushroom/onion/spinach/artichoke heart, and half onion/spinach/zucchini/tomato sauce. My only gripe is that you end up with a ton of liquid and oil at the bottom of the pan unless you somehow drain the pesto and make sure your sauce is thick. I periodically took it out of the oven and held a spatula over the top (I made a single serving so this was possible) and drained the liquid off. The taste was amazing though.

I added spinach to this which I'd read about in several different reviews.  I thought it was very good.  The only complaint that I had was that it didn't seem to make eight servings.  Maybe four to six.

Maybe I am just not a polenta fan, but this just did not do it for me.  The pesto and sauce combo was delicious, the problem for me was the consistency of the polenta and it seemed to have a kind of funny taste to it.  I liked it more than my husband, but I don't think we will be making it again.  But if you like polenta, this recipe would be awesome!

This was really really good!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and added sauteed squash, artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Outstanding. A great hit, even with my meat-eating friends. I look forward to changing up the recipe with vegetables and other cheeses. Simple to make as well.

I go with 5 stars as my meat eating husband loved it.  I added smoke mozz. and a bit of provolone as I had it on hand and it added extra layers of flavor.
Thanks for the post!

I wasn't overly impressed with this dish.  I used good pesto and good sauce and that'a about all I noticed about the dish - my pesto and marinara went well together - the polenta didn't really do anything for the dish and it wasn't 'lasagne-like' for me.  Maybe if we couldn't eat gluten we'd enjoy it more but I'll just stick to regular lasagne and find another use for polenta.

My supermarket does not carry prepared polenta (for slicing). The recipe should state how to prepare it, if necessary.  I had high hopes for this recipe, but it did not turn out well. No one in my family liked it.

I have a gluten allergy and haven't been able to eat lasagne, my favorite food, in 7 years.  I was delighted to find this recipe and absolutely loved it.  My friends and family, who are able to eat anything they please, loved it as much as I did.

This was delicious!  I did need more than one polenta package, though.  I also put pesto in both layers along with sauce.  The pine nuts and cheese on top were great after boiling!  Even the leftovers were fantastic.  An easy meal that tastes great.

I have made this several times. It is good but it can be better. First, I use my own sauce, not jarred. Secondly, I saute onions and mushrooms in a little butter, garlic, Worcestershire sauce and red wine. I add that to the layers. Sometimes I add other vegetables like zucchini or English peas depending on my mood, anything I would add to pasta lasagna. Then on top I add parmesan cheese and parsley before serving. 
This is a great alternative to pasta for those of us looking for a healthier alternative but love lasagna.

I didn‚Äôt have any pine nuts, but everything else was sitting in the pantry and I decided to give this a try.  And I‚Äôm glad!  Quick, simple, and tasty!  Hubby gave it two thumbs up, so it is a winner.

I do have a question to put out there.  I had two types of pesto in my pantry‚Äîthe traditional green (which I used) and a red sun-dried tomato pesto.

I have very little experience with polenta but this recipe was easy to follow and turned out fantastic. I fried the polenta in a little oil to crisp it up and then added the rest of the ingredients. Delicious, and will definitely make gain!

I substituted 2/3 of the Italian sausage with Chorizo Sausage, and it was just awesome. The ricotta cheese instead of the B√©chamel sauce made this super easy to make.

I made 20 portions of this, we where 14 ppl. I hoped that there would be some leftovers for the next day. but no.. it was too good and it was all eaten.  

Highly recommended

This was a big hit with my family! Like other reviewers, I added fresh spinach and tomatoes, and I also fried the polenta slices before layering them just to make them a bit crispy. The flavor of this dish was wonderful and even my kids loved it.

I was quite skeptical that this would be a keeper but wow. I sliced and baked the polenta in the oven turning once for 10 min and added turkey Italian sausage and some frozen spinach to the layering. so good!

This was so easy!  I did have to add ground meat to the marinara sauce because it is not a meal without meat, according to my husband!  I also took the recommendation of another user and added cottage cheese as a layer to increase the protein.  I added a couple dashes of crushed red pepper for a kick.  I sprinkled shredded parm on top for a little added flavor.  Delicious!

We really enjoyed this.  I made my own polenta and next time I would make my own pesto as well due to it being a little too oily for my liking.  I added parmesan with the mozzarella and a layer of cooked hot Italian sausage as well.  This reminded me of a recipe I once made out of an old Italian cookbook for Italian stew over polenta made with Italian sausage.

Made it exactly as the recipe instructed.  Pretty good if a little bland for my taste.  Could easily be customized with anything really to pep it up a little bit.  I used a 9‚Äù x 9‚Äù baking dish as I didn‚Äôt have the size called for,  but the same area, and it was a perfect fit.

It was yummy.  I made it in a loaf pan.  Cut a chub of polenta lengthwise into 6 slices, baked them in a 400 degree oven for about 8 minutes after spraying them with Pam, and then broiled them for around 5 minutes.  In a pan I sprayed w/Pam I layered polenta, pesto, ricotta cheese, spaghetti sauce,  parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese and a layer  of onions I chopped and sauteed w/garlic, and a little ch. fresh basil. Then topped with another layer of polenta, and everything else but onions (I used them all in first layer.)  Ending with parmesan and then mozzarella cheese.  Baked at 400 for about 30 min.

It was tasty and came out well; I think as long as you use brands of pesto and marinara sauce that you know you like, you'll enjoy this recipe.
 I couldn't find pre-made polenta so just cooked some of the kind that cooks in 10 minutes (salted and with some butter) to use.  
Overall is was easy to prepare, and we'll make it again.

A very good recipe to build on.  Beware of buying the basil pesto in the grocery store refrigerator case- it is very salty.
I added some grilled hot style chicken Italian Sausage and added Parmesan to the polenta I made.  When making the polenta (vs. buying the ready made) add a little less liquid so you have a denser finished product.

Great recipe. I made my pesto fresh and used fresh mozzarella.  I made several individual lasagna's as opposed to a casserole style. It was scrumptious!

Super easy & very yummy!  Easy to throw some veggies between layers & I would recommend doing that or it will be kind of a flat lasagna-I added roasted butternut squash & kale. The cover photo shows more of a loaf style pan which I would recommend using over the 11x7 dish the recipe calls for. Sadly my kids gave it a thumbs down

My husband, the carnivore was not crazy about this dish although he ate it. As a vegetarian, I thought it was a nice change. I liked the crunch of the pine nuts and the tang of the pesto. Not a pretty dish to serve. Sort of spreads over the plate. But I will make it again.

I use Daiya (vegan cheese, plant based, and tastes AMAZING!) and the taste, texture and flavor are an orchestra of flavor! This is my GO-TO dish, when trying to impress someone! Thanks for posting this recipe, it's one of my MOST favorites!!

Wonderful! I made my own polenta because store bought is extremely expensive, and I think home made tastes better. It was delicious! I made the recipe as is, but I agree with others about adding different things in. You could easily add ground beef. Love it! Will be making again!

This is an easy to make recipe - for that I would give it four stars, never used polenta before - and with a few simple ingredients and short time you can serve it for someone. I'm not crazy about red sauces and would love to see an alternative. It was a bit tangy. And I did add some ground beef to it and some onions. But I can see other ingredients perhaps creamed corn and cheese and perhaps jalapenos included in the layering for the future, just trying to think of red sauce alternatives. Thanks. The ppl I served it to liked it. But nobody raved about it.

Very good. We had polenta (homemade) with tomato sauce (homemade) for lunch yesterday and wanted to make something different with the leftovers. I had homemade pesto in the freezer so this recipe was perfect. I had to make two changes I didn‚Äôt have any pine nuts at home so I used cashew nuts and the same with mozzarella. I used what I had. I always have grated cheese in the freezer. I read the recipe a little hastily and put the nuts and cheese on top from the start and I couldn‚Äôt put on the broiler because I had a cake in the oven at the same time but both lasagna and cake came out fine.

My Hubby was recently diagnosed with a gluten and wheat allergy so finding foods to make that are GF isn't always easy.  This is a recipe that I've made before so made it again this evening for friends.  I used the sun-dried tomato polenta instead of making polenta from scratch.  Sauteed fresh mushrooms and added them to the sauce.  Everything was yummy...this recipe is a simple recipe that is easy to make changes to...don't be afraid to eperiment!!!

Really good, although I added to it based on other reviews.  I did a layer of polenta topped with pesto, spinach, roma tomatoes, ricotta cheese (an entire tub) and all the sauce.  Then I put the final layer of polenta on top and baked as directed for 25 minutes.  Topped with mozzarella and parmesan cheese and broiled for about 3 minutes.  It was very, very good.

I liked this a lot- hubby not so much, hence the 4 stars, but I will make it again for me.
I did what others recommended- broil polenta first, add sauteed spinach, onion, and garlic to middle layer with dabs of cottage cheese, parmesan, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  All else as written.  Very tasty!

Made polenta with 6 cups water, 1 3/4 cups cornmeal, 1 tsp salt and 2 tbsp olive oil.  Boiled over a double boiler 15 minutes.  Put 1/3 in bottom of buttered pan to cool, and 2/3 in buttered large edged cookie sheet to cool.  Ist layer went over polenta crust, and then cut rounds out of polenta with cookie cutter, to cover first layer, very easy.

For a slightly more homemade version, I cooked down two 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes, half a diced onion, and one package of frozen chopped spinach instead of using jarred sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  The only other change I might make is adding some ricotta cheese next time for a little more depth of flavor.

I love the creativity of this bake. Like others have said by using pre-made pesto and polenta, it is really simple enough for children to make. If not vegetarian, add some sausage to it becaue it is WONDERFUL.

I absolutely love this recipe, and I've made it several times!  Today I added sauteed shrimp and sundried tomatoes.  I put the shrimp in with a little more sauce and mozzarella cheese and then put in under the broil for 6 mins.  Fabulous!

I love polenta, and I actually made my own for this recipe but overall the dish was not that great. It is a unique idea, but it seems like it is lacking something. I tried adding some baby bella mushrooms and sauteed spinach but the dish still wasn't anything special. I think I will stick to lasagna noodles in the future for lasagna. Will not be making this again.

This dish was ridiculously easy but yet so delicious. I added some spinach after the first layer of pesto and also some minced garlic cause I am a garlic fiend. It was soo yummy and even better on the next day when microwaved. This is definitely going into the rotation...

This is such a quick and easy recipe - SO SO SO good!!! My DH absolutely loved it.  I had some provolone cheese and some roasted red peppers in the fridge, so I added those smack dab in teh middle of all the other layer.  Aw MAN it was good!

So, so, SOOO good!  Easy to make and very filling!  I made my own polenta and added ricotta cheese between the layers -- YUM!  This recipe is definitely a keeper! :)

This turned out pretty good, but I made a few changes.  I didn't have any marinara sauce, so I just layered the polenta with the pesto and fresh tomatoes.  I also used a small amount of romano cheese in addition to the mozzarella.  It was tasty, but I think next time I will make sure to have some pine nuts and marinara on hand.  Also, be careful when oiling the dish so as not to create too much excess when baking.  At least olive oil is good for you!

I used Arrabbiata sauce, which added a little spiciness. I thought this was an excellent main dish particularly given its simplicity. My husband liked the pesto/Arrabbiata mixture, but not the polenta.

Although very easy, I just thought it was boring.  I'm not a very big fan of polenta, but if you like polenta I'm sure you would like this one.

insanely good -- i modified it a tiny bit to compensate for an ingredient that i couldn't find, but it's amazingly tasty.  a big hit at our house.
