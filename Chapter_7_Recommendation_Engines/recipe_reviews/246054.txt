I haven't left many reviews, but this is one dish that I had to take the time, plus I see there's not many reviews for it yet but there should be.   This is  a great base recipe.   I have made it as written as well as some substitutions when not all ingredients are handy.  I have switched the chives for parsley and I have added turkey bacon, finely chopped.  I eyeball the actual ingredients, but then I'm sure we all do that.  Each time it comes out fantastic.  This will be a mainstay of my kitchen  from here on out.   I have served it on the side of cabbage rolls and the combination is amazing.  My husband puts the sauce from the rolls on top as you would gravy on mashed potatoes.   I have also used it as the "mashed potato" topping on my empanada filling since I always make way too much filling, so I turn it into a sort of sheppards pie.   This is a very versatile base recipe for many dishes.   The best part is I don't have to squeeze out the water after steaming as I do when I make the cauliflower pizza dough recipe.  This is just a wonderful recipe that everyone should try at least once.  You will be hooked.   I will also say, I do use frozen cauliflower florets rather than fresh cauliflower because frozen is, in my opinion, fresher than the "fresh" produce we get in these parts, plus I always have it in the freezer ready to go.

5.10.16 I scaled this recipe down to 2 servings (1 head of cauliflower), and in this house, this recipe would have served a minimum of 3, maybe even 4 (which makes this break down even nutritionally).  I love the fact that this is a light substitution for mashed potatoes, but most importantly, it tastes good!  But do keep in mind that it still tastes like cauliflower, not potatoes, but thatâ€™s a compromise I can occasionally make (I do love mashed potatoes).  Thanks, Katie, for sharing your recipe.

Wowza! I subbed gruyere for the cheeses listed and put smoked paprika on the top along with the nutmeg.  

I can't believe how good this was! This is a must for the upcoming holidays.

I made a ton of changes but it's a great basic recipe to start with. I added Cheddar cheese and then topped it with grated parm. Also added nutmeg, red pepper flakes, heavy whipping cream. I put the cauliflower in the food processor and pulsed it to and nice coarse gravel.  It was heaven in my mouth I didn't care about the main course all I wanted to eat was this.

Added a couple tablespoons of minced garlic, which made for a very flavorful dish. I also did not have shredded mozzarella and diced the fresh mozzarella I had instead. It ended up looking like marshmallows in the dish but still tasted delicious.

I expected less of a cauliflower taste.  Definitely prefer this recipe with soft boiled turnips instead of cauliflower.

I cook a lot, and I don't often say a recipe is difficult (and its not that it was difficult) but I felt like there were way too many steps for a simple side dish that wasn't very good. Then when it was time to mix it, I did it in the pan like the recipe says but that was a mistake, the cauliflower jumped out of the pan all over the kitchen and made a HUGE mess. I transferred it to a pot, but it still jumped out too much for my taste. Then it wouldn't even mix well, I kept having to add more chicken stock. In the end it was sort of flavorless. Even though I added extra cheese and extra spice. Topped it with a butt load of green onions, and that was the only way we could all eat it. I liked it ok, but the mess and the effort gives it 2 stars. Sorry.
