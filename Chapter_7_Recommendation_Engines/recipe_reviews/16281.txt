This is a good and easy recipe, however, I agree with the another review that suggested not using the raw Spanish peanuts next time!  I think the recipe would be much more flavorful with roasted peanuts.

I have been making this recipe for over 10 years now.  The only thing I do different is melting the chips inthe microwave, stirring every 15 seconds till smooth.  The spanish peanuts give them a wonderful salty taste...everyone asks me for the recipe.  A Christmas tradition inour family!

I got this recipe with my 1st microwave (Amana "Radar Range"),LONG ago. I have made these clusters for Christmas, in the microwave for 30 plus years.  My recipe calls for "Cocktail" peanuts. Put them in small papers for a more fancy presentation. AWESOME

I made these for DH for Valentines Day, but I did use salted peanuts, instead of the Raw Spanish Peanuts.  This is a favorite treat of his I usually only make for Christmas.  I have always just used the Chocolate Almond Bark, which he claims he likes slightly better, as it had more of a Chocolate flavor. Will probably make this again, as I thought this was easier, as I just melted the chips in the microwave until melted, mixed in nuts, and put on waxed paper with a teaspoon.  Start to finish was only a few minutes, which is a huge plus for me!!  Thanks Donna!!

I am excited to try your recipe but want to know if it is in fact 12 CUPS of peanut butter chips.  Seems like that might be too many, and certainly too much for my double boiler.

If you bought raw peanuts, simply put them on a cookie sheet for 15-20 minutes shelled, 20-25 minutes unshelled. I prefer nuts in this recipes that are not overly salted Planters type nuts. Freshly roasted nuts - two words. Yum. Oh.

I tried this recipe with lightly salted roasted peanuts and dark chocolate chips mixed with white chocolate chips. It was great! I tried it with almonds. Again it was great! I tried it with raisins using milk chocolate chips and then I tried it with pistachios using dark chocolate chips. Both were fantastic! This is a very easy recipe. I didn't leave the candy out to harden naturally the first time, I put it in the fridge and the chocolate was a bit hard. The next times that I made the candy, I let it set at room temperature and it came out perfect. There's no baking involved but it did take some time to harden. Here at my place it took 6-7 hours. It might vary from place to place depending on temperature I think.
I also used the microwave to melt the chips. I heated them on high for 30 seconds and then stirred really well then heated again, etc. I think it took about a minute and a half to two minutes. The chips do melt as you stir them.

Very yummy holiday treat, this recipe is better than my mothers ( sorry mom ) The grocery store was wiped out on Spanish peanuts so I used Planters roasted lightly salted peanuts. Tastes even better I think.

I did a double batch- two 12oz containers lightly salted peanuts, two 12oz containers semi-sweet chocolate chips, one 12oz bag peanut butter chips, and one 12oz bag butterscotch chips. I set up muffin liners on a baking sheet and filled them up about 1/3 each - this made just enough for Christmas gifts to those hard-to-shop-for people on my list. Very good, though very rich... everyone seemed to like them.

I just made these for Father's Day and of course had to make a sample one for myself (: I used roasted, salted peanuts, semi-sweet and milk chocolate (since he doesn't like the peanut butter flavor much). Since I wasn't sure how much 12oz was, I started with 1.5cups though I think I ended up with about 2cups so it wouldn't be too runny. Overall, these were pretty tasty though I did get a few SUPER salty bites, but that had all to do with the peanuts. I may try this with Spanish peanuts next time.

I can't believe I have not entered my review! I made these last year for teacher gifts & for the family.  I was still making these well into February, at least 2 times a month!  EASY & make more than you think you will need!  I was worried about making candy & giving to teachers who would see my "skills." However, they loved them!!

This is my first review on here so bare with me. I agree...use salted roasted peanuts unless you really like the taste of unsalted peanuts. I used salted roasted. I also had to add milk as needed to help unthicken the chips. After they melted it was extremely thick. I would also suggest only using 3/4 of the container of peanuts...again unless you really like peanuts. I personally love choclate more than nuts so less nuts would have been much better. I also added mini reese's pieces on top of half of them. These were made to go to our church for our annual cookie walk so we will see how well people like them. Overall good recipe but you may need to make adjustments.

This is a holiday favorite with my family. The only thing we do different (if anyone would like to try) is using butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter. It makes it really rich and delicious! Be sure to make enough because they go fast!!

This is such a quick and easy recipe; totally foolproof! I combine the chips in the microwave, which is even faster, then combine peanuts when the chips are melted. These candies are addicting, and everyone wants me to bring them to family events and card parties!

I used butterscotch chips and honey roasted peanuts.  When they came out of the chocolate and onto the sheet I sprinkled some sea salt on top. These were super easy to make, and contained everything I had in the pantry already!  Satisfied my sweet/salty/chocolatey craving.

They were very easy too make but I think they would taste better with less peanut butter chips. It was too peanut buttery for me!

I used creamy peanut butter instead of the chips. I think the chips would have been better. The peanut butter kept the chocolate from setting up all the way without going in the fridge. Otherwise, they were a hit :)

So easy and good! For one batch, I used 1 bag each of milk chocolate, semisweet, butterscotch chips along with 1 1/2 jars salted roasted peanuts. Had to use improvised double boiler to accommodate. Made 3 trays full. Takes a while to set up, will refrigerate before bagging up for gifts.

I didn't have any peanut butter chips, so I used peanut butter instead. Was a winner for the bake sale. I used unsalted peanuts, but I think it could of use a little more salt.

I use red Spanish peanuts (which is what my original recipe calls for dated 1950) and butterscotch chips in place of the peanut butter chips.  I also use parfin wax (from original recipe) with mine to help it stay firm. My family had been getting this recipe from me for years. I've placed it in cook books also. My family also request this every time I make them candy.  Very easy and with so few ingredients you can't go wrong.  I have also used This same recipe with raisins, cashews, small pretzels and pecans. 

I melt the wax first in a double boiler then add both chip packages and then the nuts. Dip by teaspoon onto wax paper on a cookie sheet. I either put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes or set them outside to freeze. I store them in Tupperware containers in the freezer till I'm ready to give them away.

We don't care for too bitter or too sweet. So I revised the recipe just a little for our taste. I used 12 oz semi sweet chips and 8 oz milk chocolate chips and 4 oz white chocolate chips. Melted all in microwave. Added more peanuts than what it called for. Was great.

Don't use unsalted raw Spanish peanuts - salted roasted peanuts would be much better.

Make this recipe every year, but agree they are much better with roasted peanuts. They give a nice salty/sweet balance.

so simple and so delicious.  I used the raw spanish peanuts but ran out of them so used just regular salted spanish peanuts and they worked just fine and were just as good.  I had heard the chocolate doesn't stick to the salted ones but we had no problem.

As written this is less than a 1.  DO NOT USE RAW SPANISH PEANUTS.  They are very green tasting and are used in peanut brittle and cooked with the peanut brittle.  Definitely use either dry-roasted salted peanuts or the canned ROASTED spanish peanuts.  WITH THAT CHANGE, this is an excellent recipe.  I think the poster of this recipe didn't realize what RAW peanuts are.

Very good...the only reason I held back the last star is that my mom always made these with Almond Bark in place of the peanut butter chips and they are WONDERFUL that way!  My brother begs for them every year!

This a very simple and easy to prepare recipe for peanut clusters.  I have very good results everytime I make them.  However, instead of using raw spanish peanuts, I use lightly salted, dry roasted peanuts.  Sometimes I also use chocolate and peanut butter chips and real milk chocolate chips instead of just peanut butter and chocolate chips alone.  They are so good, and I get compliments everytime I make them.

Made them for Christmas.. my husband was taste-testing even before they completely setup.  Very quick and easy to make, but even better to eat!
