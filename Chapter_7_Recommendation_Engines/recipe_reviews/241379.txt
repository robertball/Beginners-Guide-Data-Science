A quick and easy recipe with a rare combination of ingredients however they do deliver a delightful flavor. This does have somewhat of a yellow appearance so I just tell people it's yellow fin tuna. Perfect as an appetizer on crackers or on a sandwich with sliced onion. Can be easily tweaked with diced celery, onions or even jalapeno.

This was a great recipe for tuna salad! The mustard and horseradish gave this just the right amount of kick without being too spicy. So much better than a regular tuna salad with only mayonnaise! I doubled the recipe for my family, and it made enough for about 6 regular sized sandwiches. Four out of five people at my house ate this, and enjoyed it so I'm sure I will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe, Ari!

I like the little kick this tuna salad has! I used Dijon instead of yellow mustard and omitted salt. Great with a plain cracker. Next time, I will chop up a couple of baby dill pickles and/or celery to give it the bit of crunch that I like in a tuna salad.

I loved this! I didn't have yellow mustard so I used coarse ground dijon instead. It was the best tuna salad I've ever had.

I thought it was excellent! I used it to make tuna melt sandwiches with Swiss Cheese. Thank you for sharing! The horse radish sauce was a nice touch.

I used white tuna and did half the amounts for the mayo and mustard, and it worked fine. Nice change from regular tuna salad, and I'll surely make this again. It was good on Triscuits  and topped with chopped dill pickles, as a reviewer suggested. Nice light Lenten lunch. Thanks!

Very good! It would have been great with horseradish as written and I will make it that way next time, but I discovered I was out halfway through prep and ended up using Greek yogurt and adding diced green onions, along with a whole red onion (we made a big batch). We prefer the mix a little “dryer” so used a bit less mayo (and we use olive oil mayo, yum). Also added garlic powder, dill, Italian seasoning and a small amount of black pepper.

Love the cutting down of mayo and replacing with mustard. Could use Dijon for a different zip and I used mild horseradish but would use hot next time. My wife and I loved this recipe.

This is a quick and really tasty way to serve tuna salad! We often eat tuna for the protein and this was a huge crowd pleaser! My husband's new favorite in fact. The horseradish gives it a nice kick (but not too much) and the lemon juice cuts the fish smell and taste! Plus, it comes together in about 5 minutes! You could certainly add veggies but don't need to if pressed for time. In spring I will cut up garlic scrapes and throw them in and reduce the garlic powder.

This tuna is so tasty!! I doubled the recipe. I didn't have horse reddish so I blended half a Dill pickle and added 4 boiled eggs. I'll be making this again.

Served this on sliced tomatoes for lunch.  Loved it.  You do need to like horseradish though.
