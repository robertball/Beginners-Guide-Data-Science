FANTASTIC! I used mini chocolate chips in place of the baking chocolate and regular chocolate chips (that's all I had on hand), and did not chop the cherries and pecans, as I wanted nice pieces of both in the mix. Mine only took about 35 minutes to bake, so be sure to keep check on them, as I think an hour may be too long. These are perfectly moist and very flavorful...a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

These brownies are delicious! I made two small changes to the basic recipe based on my previous baking-with-chocolate experience. Since I used unsalted butter, I added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. espresso powder to the sugar/egg mixture. These two additions help bring out the chocolate flavor. I plan on making a few batches of these to add to Christmas gift baskets!! My dear hubby is going to be REALLY HAPPY at snack time tonight!!!

These were delicious!  I substituted chocolate chunks and walnuts and baked for only 32 minutes in the 9x13 pan. I also left the cherries whole and used chunks instead of chips. They are definitely going in my file of “go to” recipes!

I substituted chocolate chips for the baking chocolate as one other reviewer did because I didn’t have baking chocolate. Also, as most people have mentioned the baking time of 1 hour is WAY too long. I baked them for 35 minutes and 30 would have been better because they are a tiny bit dry. I put white chocolate chips on top when they were still warm so they’d melt, swirled that wit blue chocolate and put cherries randomly on top for a patriotic theme. I’m taking them to a cookout today for 4th of July weekend.

I ommitted the pecans and added 1/2 cup of maraschino cherries (along with the dried cherries). Cooking time was about 30 - 35 mins.  They turned out AH-MAZING!!! Whole thing was gobbled up by my daughters and hubby! Will DEFINITELY make again.  SUPER EASY!!!

This is my new favorite brownie recipe.  I wish someone would correct the recipe for baking time though...should not have to read a bunch of reviews to get proper instructions.

I really liked these. Mix everything together in one pan and then bake. What could be easier? They were especially good warm from the oven, but like most brownies, they  started getting hard pretty quickly. Putting a wedge of orange in the container helped, but I think next time I might try replacing some of the butter with applesauce and see if that will keep them soft and moist longer.

Would have been five stars if cook time was correct. I used an 8x8 pan and cooked for 45minutes. Brownies would have burned if I had used the pan size called for and cooked for an hour. Brownies taste great though.

I used hazelnuts instead of pecans. My brownies were ready in around 32 minutes. But apart from the bake time being off, everything is perfect. I plan to try it out with variations of the dried fruit and nuts!

Bake for an hour and you'll have an expensive brick. Thankfully they dunk in coffee. Flavor is there, but bake time is way off.  I set my timer for 50 min. Disappointing.
....  Wish I'd read the reviews first.
