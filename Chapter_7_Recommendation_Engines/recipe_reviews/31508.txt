This casserole is excellent indeed, easy to put together and suitable as a side-dish to just about anything. I used chopped green onions instead of regular onion, and it came out wonderful.

Different strokes for different folks.  I absolutely loved this and my husband just thought it was okay.  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it came out perfect.

For Thanksgiving, I wanted to make something a bit different instead of plain old green bean casserole, so I decided to try this recipe.  I used yellow whole kernel corn since I didnt' have any white corn on hand,and used cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have any cream of celery.  Added a jar of canned mushooms and used French's fried onions on top instead of the crackers because my daughter loves them.  Omitted the slivered almonds. Everybody loved this casserole.  Thanks for the great recipe, Aprilynne!

This was very tasty, but was not done in the time specified in the recipe.  After 45 minutes, the texture was still "soupy", so I baked it for 15 minutes more.  

I would like to try this with different vegetables, as I think you could make a variety of delicious combinations with this recipe as the base.

I am sorry I cannot rate this fairly. When I read this recipe it just screamed to me "ADD CHICKEN"....so I did.  I added and entire boiled and deboned chicken that I inteded to make some sort of casserole out of. I am glad I tried it. It was wonderful. They all went back for a second helping. I used yellow corn and also added some fresh mushroom slices, diced zucchini and yellow squash that I needed to use in something. I also had to sub the cream of celery soup to cream of mushroom b/c that's what I had on hand. We are very much looking forward to the leftovers tonight. Thanks for the wonderful idea!!!

I suppose one must like this style of food.  I thought it was okay, but the crusty top was of course soggy when re-heating.  Would make again but leave off the crunchy top until I was ready to serve each portion.

I've been trying to find this recipe after losing it after Thanksgiving last year.  It was without a doubt the best green bean casserole I've ever had!  All time favorite.

Some unique ingredients mixed together to make a nice, creamy casserole.  The almonds on the top were delicious--really added the perfect touch.  I took this to a potluck and came home with none left.  Very good!

The first time I made this, I thought it was a little bland.  I had sauteed some mushrooms in garlic for anothe purpose and they accidently mixed into this while on my plate.  It was perfect.  The second time I made this, I did it on purpose.  I repurposed one of the 4 tablespoons of butter to sautee the mushrooms, onions, celery and one clove of garlic.  When it came time to melt the other 3 tablespoons for the topping, I just used the same pan.  Perfect.  On a third try, I increased to 2 cloves of garlic, but it was too much... stick to one.  I buy the Ritz crackers that come in pre-packaged stacks and just squeeze one package with my hands to crush them... it couldn't be easier.  Make sure you get slivered almonds, not sliced so they stay firm.  45 minutes of baking was fine for me.  I often use shredded cheddar/Monterey Jack from the 8 oz package because it's easier than shredding a block of Colby myself.  Oh, and I can only find pimento in a 4 oz jar, so that's what I use - sliced not diced so they have some substance in the casserole.

A nice side dish when you need something with a little more substance than just plain green beans. The whole family enjoyed this, and it was very simple to prepare. I left out the almonds this time, but would try them in the future. Great recipe! Thank-you!

Got this recipe from a dear friend - called it shoe-peg corn casserole.  We make it with french-cut green beans and cheddar cheese.  I always cook for an hour and everyone who tries it - LOVES it. One of my husband's favorites.

Made it today for a pot luck at church tonight. I added chicken, and sautéed zucchini and squash. I also substituted sliced grape tomatoes for the pimentos. Otherwise used the listed ingredients. It was a big hit with a lot of people asking for the recipe. I will make it again.

My sister made this when she had most of our clan together.  What a hit!  Recipe leaves room for substitutions so you can put your own spin on this dish, like halved grape tomatoes instead of pimentos, or adding some cooked hopped chicken or ham chunks, or seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the butter cracker-almond crust.  This dish did cook slower than time reported.  I will sauté the onions before adding them, to reduce the required time in the oven.  Delicious! Definitely a do-over.

DELISCIOUS! I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I have since started Weight Watchers and made some changes like using fat free soup and cheese and low fat sour cream. I also omitted the crackers, almonds and butter and it was still very good and diet friendly!

The previous reviews were helpful! I doubled the recipe and cooked it for 1 hr. to take to a pot luck. At first, everyone had to ask what it was, but once they tried it, it was a hit. I have to email one of my friends the recipe today!

Quick, cheap and easy! I made this for Christmas dinner and very little was left. The kids liked it until we told them it had green beans in it, so shshsh! I'm a cheese lover so I added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.

Looks good, but only tastes okay.  Tastes like something from a church pot luck.  Would be better with some cooked chicken and something else for more flavor.
