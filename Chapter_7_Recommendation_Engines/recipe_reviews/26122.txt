These were definetly tasty but the recipe definetly needs to include the fact that it requires a double boiler. I ended up scorching the bottom of my pot and spent a grueling  Saturday morning scrapping questionable looking burnt chocolate off the bottom of my pot.

Even though I like molasses, I thought it overpowered the peanut butter. These weren't as chocolatey or peanut buttery as I had expected. If I try these again, I'll definitely skip the molasses.

i really liked the texture, but it was a bit boring.  it could maybe could be jazzed up with chopped candy bars, chopped oreos, or some mini m&m's.

Yummy!  Very sweet, but a fun, easy, gluten-free treat.  My 3 yr old son had fun making them and eating them with me too!

I didn't really care for these. They weren't distinctively chocolatey or peanut buttery enough, and the texture was very thick, like glue or tar, even after they set. Sorry, just not for me.

Liked it lots - substituted quick oats for rice cereal. Stirring constantly no problem with burning on - don't need double boiler

WOW!  These are wonderful!  Was looking for a recipe for a sweet that was gluten free and yet still tasty.  This is certainly that and more!  Couldn't be easier to make and is really yummy!  My husband says it's a 10 out of 10!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

I think they were Great, but They Got really Hard overnight. But otherwise I would definitely make them again
