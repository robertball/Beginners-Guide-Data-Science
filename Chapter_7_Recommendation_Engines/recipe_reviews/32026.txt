The curry sauce was good (and EASY!) but the meatballs were too rich/greasy and too heavy for the sauce.  I preferred it with chicken, potatoes, and onions for a lighter meal.

We really really liked this but it needed a little bit of tweakage. First of all, I added a couple of minced cloves of garlic, plus half an onion very finely diced to the meat mixture. I also softened a diced jalapeno in the skillet while browning the meat balls. I strongly suggest making this the day before you plan on eating it - the flavors meld so nicely. Also, if you're not used to cooking with green curry paste, add it a little bit at a time until it's how you like it. It has a very distinctive taste. Thanks, Jon!

We really liked this... but I did have to make a couple of additions... just 'cause I can't seem to leave a recipe alone!  I added a little yogurt to take some of the bite away as my green curry paste is REALLY hot and hubby had to work the next day!  Also added a squeeze of lime juice and topped with chopped cilantro!  I'm sure it would have been good even if I hadn't messed with it!  We had it over jasmine rice... and loved it!!  Thanks!

Loved this recipe. I had to double it as I had more ground lamb than called for. Yes, I added fresh minced onion to the lamb balls. I also added fresh mushrooms and frozen peas. let it all simmer on low for more than the time required. Not too hot or spicy. Plain old white rice to serve it with an a green salad for DH and all was well! I will be making this one again. Oh, and the left overs for lucnh were just as good if not better! ***EDITED*** Made this for about the 4th time last night. I allways had a problem with the lamb balls getting too browned by frying them in a skillet. So I tried baking them on a cookie sheet that I sprayed with canola oil. 350 for about 25 minutes.  Perfect! Also upped the green curry paste to 3 tblsp. Used a dry steak seasoning, not a wet one and added minced garlic. Other than that I did everything I said I did in my first review. It was so much better and had less fat! DH was floored. As others have said, although this is amazing the 1st night it melds by the 2nd day it is off the chain! It is perfect as a make ahead main dish for company! That is if you are willing to share!

Excellent.  I added mushrooms, onions and green beans while cooking the meatballs.  I also halved the coconut cream (and used light) but used the full amount of curry paste!  Everything was moist wit sauce but not dripping which was pleasant.  I served it over brown rice.

Delicious.  Simmering the lamb balls with the curry ensures that the lamb balls are cooked through and juicy.  Absolutely delectable recipe.   Will cook again, and again.

Loved it.  This was so easy and tasted like it took a lot of work!  Letting the meatballs simmer in the sauce for a good 10 minutes or so ensures the meatballs are cooked through, and helps them absorb some of the curry flavor, although I would recommend making this a day ahead to allow the flavor to really deepen.

I added sliced onions and frozen peas to the sauce and served it over brown rice.  I went a bit lighter on the curry sauce since I've found it too hot in the past (and I like hot food), but I think I will use the amount called for next time.  My husband liked the milder curry flavor though - I guess it depends on your tolerance for hot foods and also the strength of the curry paste used - some of them can be really hot.

My wife loves lamb, and we both love green curry, so this seemed like a natural meal to try. I did have a slight problem with the outside of the meatballs cooking faster than the inside. This may have been because I had the pan too hot. A little under two minutes in the microwave cooked the meatballs through. I served them mixed with steamed broccoli and over rice, and it was delicious. My wife wanted to know when I was going to make it again.

Easy and excellent dish.  Watch out though!  If you have never used Thai green chili paste in a dish before, add slightly less.  It is really hot, and that's coming from someone who loves intense heat in foods.  Thanks for the quick dinner idea.  A++

I used ground turkey in place of lamb, oatmeal in place of bread crumbs, added 2 eggs to the meatball mixture and baked the meatballs instead of frying them. I then sauteed red curry paste in a little olive oil, added a can of lite coconut milk and about 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth. After simmering the sauce I added sliced red peppers and broccoli which I had steamed, bamboo shoots and the meatballs. It was soooo good! I can't wait to try it again exactly as written.

WOW...this dish certainly was very tasty and quick to make as described, and of course filling.  Plain white boiled rice is just right with the sauce.  A definite hit with my family and will make again and again.

A little bland and wasn't a huge fan of the prominent coconut flavor.

Extremely tasty dish! Like other reviewers, I added a little chopped onion to the meatballs. Besides that, I stayed with the recipe. I wholeheartedly recommend this as an easy quick meal!

This was really good.  I browned the meat and drained off all the fat before forming the balls so that they weren't greasy as another reviewer suggested.  I added some veggies too for a complete meal.

The flavors were excellent!! However, the directions are lacking ... my balls fell apart as I tried to fry them. This turned the whole dish into more of a "Green curry lamb slurry" but again it tasted amazing!

Tried to follow as closely as possible, but my partner bought green curry sauce instead of paste. Still tasty! We added bell peppers and that was a nice touch. Served over basmati rice. YUM! We will make it again!

Love, love, love this!  I use all of the listed ingredients but cook it a little differently.  First, I brown the meatballs for 5 minutes and then add in the curry and coconut milk, letting the meatballs finish cooking in the mixture.  I serve the meatballs and sauce over yellow rice.  Like other reviewers have said, this recipe is even BETTER as leftovers!
