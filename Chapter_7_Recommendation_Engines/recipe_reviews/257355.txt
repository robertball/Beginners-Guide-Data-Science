Very good recipe.  I left out the cauliflower rice and cut down on the tomato sauce added (used 2/3 of the can). I also added a can of green chiles to add a little extra flavor.

I left out the yogurt mixture and added some corn to the recipe, turned out great, especially when topped with a little sour cream. Girlfriend loved it too!

I loved this! I seasoned to taste instead of using the measurements. I added cayenne, salt, pepper, and chicken seasoning. I used ground chicken. Definitely will make this again!

I didn't have cauliflower rice so I substituted with white rice (so much for low carb!). It was good but I thought it was quite bland. I know it's a healthier dish but next time I'll throw in some salt.

It was good.  A little bland; I'll add a dash of cayenne next time.  I also added some black olives since I needed to use some up.
