Used to love this and lost the recipe.  Thanks for posting it.  The only difference between your recipe and mine was instead of bread cubes, my recipe calls for 2 bags of croutons.  Herb and garlic croutons add a nice taste.  I also am not fond of mustard, so leave that out.  Thanks again!  Gonna make it for breakfast this weekend!

I've been making this for years, every Christmas morning.  My family loves it.  Funny thing is the first time I made it they didn't like it but they requested it a couple years later and I have been making it ever since.  The only change I make is to use cream of celery soup as no one likes mushrooms.

I have been making this recipe for years and it always gets rave reviews. It is a favorite request at every Christmas and brunch potluck. The only difference is that I use link sausage and cube it. Sometimes I omit mushrooms for those who dont like them.

I made two of these last weekend for our house full of guests.  Both were gone in no time!  I wasn't sure about the cream of mushroom soup on top, but it is awesome!  This one is definitely a keeper!

Made this Christmas morning for my family. We all loved it! You really do need the cream of mushroom soup on top of this to make it moist enough. Also, I used a whole French baguette instead of 8 slices of regular bread.

This recipe is almost like mine, but it needs cheese I also used the herb seasoned coutons. I also add a layer of 2 cups of cheddar cheese on top of the sausage and then use 10 eggs and mix it with the soup and milk and then refrigerate over night. Bake at 325 for 1 - 1 1/2 hours. Everyone loves it

You can use those little precooked brown-n-serve sausages in this, just slice into disks.  This was good.

This recipe is both delicious and easy!  The second time I made it I added fresh mushrooms which really enhanced the flavor.  This will be a regular in my recipe box.

My coworkers RAVED.  The soup on top makes this top notch.  THANK YOU for sharing! (Note: I did use packaged bacon pieces instead of sausage, just personal preference and what I had on hand.)

I made this recipe because it sounded so good.  I picked the sausage and cheese out.  Just not for this family I guess, and we like pretty much everything.

We had this at a family reunion. My cousin made it as directed, but also add chopped green chilis.... it was awesome!!!!! I will make it myself, but am thinking cream of potato might be good in it since potatoes and eggs go really good together!

I made this the day after the Superbowl and it was GREAT!  Felt hearty and light at the same time, just what we needed on our stomaches.  I followed it as directed except added a few onions and green peppers when I cooked the sausage.  Thanks ChefMommy for posting this!

My grandma used to make a similar recipe.  I used this one for Christmas breakfast and it was gobbled all up!  The only change I made was I added 3 TBSP green onions to the egg mixture and cut back the milk by 1/2 cup to ensure it wasn't soggy.  It was perfect!

Update: I've made this before and raved about it, then my husband asked me to make a pan to take to work. After digging thru the freezer I found 6 buns and mild Italian sausage, so that's what I used. I took the sausage out of the casing and fried it up, threw it together last night and finished it this morning. He got there at 7:00 with a hot pan and he called me at 9:30 saying it was already gone. Everyone loved it. I did add some cut up fresh mushrooms I needed to use up (was going to add to the meat but forgot). Baked @ 325 on convection for an hour. It still turned out great. For those complaining it's too salty, it might be the soup you're using. I will only use Campbell's; other brands I have tried were too salty for my taste. I'd rather spend the extra money than ruin an entire meal over a few cents.

We had this Christmas morning. Only made three changes. My mom is allergic to mushrooms and they make her extremely sick, so had to use a different soup on the top. We finally settled on Cream of Chicken (I know, mix pork from the sausage & chicken??!!), and it was excellent! We also added some onions to the sausage, and a 7 oz. can of diced green chiles. With or without the changes, this is excellent! We will definitely make this again!

I made this for Christmas breakfast today and the family loved it.  I used 3 croissants (the size you use for sandwiches) that had been in the freezer and they worked perfectly. I always freeze leftover french bread, etc to use in dishes like this.  I only used half the amount of cheese.  Four cups seemed like a lot.  I added 1 more egg and a little more milk to the mushroom soup.  This is a very versatile recipe...you could use bacon or ham, add onions, green peppers, etc.  Definately a keeper!

I turned up temp slightly so it wouldn't take so long to cook, VERY tasty and filling, folks couldn't believe there was cream of mushroom soup in it.  Also fried up cut up link sausages to put in it.

Very good.  As other reviews said, the cream of mushroom on top is very important, that is the difference with other sausage casseroles. The only change I did was on the cooking method: I placed it in a pre-heated 350 degrees oven, covered with aluminum foil for 50 minutes.  Awesome!!!!!
By the way, the picture that appears on top is not favorable for this recipe.  I looks burned!!! and the final plate doesn't really look like that.  ChefMommy can you change that picture?  Thanks for reading this!

My family absolutely loved this breakfast casserole!! So easy to make too!  I followed this recipe but made a few changes.... I used 10 slices of bread instead of 8, used 3 cups of shredded cheddar cheese instead of 4, used 8 eggs instead of 6, and cooked it at 325 degrees for 1:20 minutes. It was delicious!!

Sorry, but we didn't like this at all.  It was way too salty and had an overall weird taste.  I think it might have been the dry mustard.  Also the bottom was overcooked.  Will try something else next time.

I LOVE this casserole!  I have made it a few times for different ocassions and it is always gone within MINUTES!  I do use MAPLE flavored sausage instead of regular and it comes out so wonderful!  I have never had a complaint about this dish... as a matter of fact, I am going to go make it now just because it sounds so good!!!

Made this for the first time for Christmas morning. Instead of breakfast sausage, I substituted Adele's Chicken Sausage - the portabello mushroom one - thinly sliced and sauteed in a bit of butter.  My only complaint is that it wasn't steaming when I took it out of the oven after 90 minutes.  I'll make it again but will take the temp up to 350 for the last 15-20 min to make it crispier on top.

what do you do with the shredded cheddar cheese?  Eat it while you're cooking?  Just kidding, I get that you are supposed to cover it with the cheese before baking.  However, 4 cups is an ungodly amount!  2 cups, I've found to be much better.  Love this recipe!  The only extra thing I added was some chopped chives to the sausage while it was browning.  GREAT ADDITION!

I love the simplicity of this delicious recipe!  I've made a couple of changes though.  I use sourdough bread and add a small can of chopped chili peppers.  The chilis give the casserole a bit of character and the sourdough bread gives a very unique flavor to the breakfast!

This is a fantastic recipe...as a starting point. It's really good all by itself, but it lends itself well to tweaking. I've added chicken jalapeno sausages (from Trader Joes...YUM) to this recipe instead and also bacon. I've recently added both, with some fresh mushrooms and a handful of canned jalapenos, and of course, extra cheese. OMG....it was fantastic! Serve salsa on the side. If you serve with hashbrown casserole II from this site and your guests (and hubby) will LOVE you.

Excellent!  Took it to a brunch this morning & came home w/ very little.  Everyone enjoyed it--even my picky 4-year old.  I used wheat bread & chopped up sausage patties--and made it exactly like recipe--and it turned out great!

delicious! Made this for Easter breakfast, and it got rave reviews! I was trying to copy my mother in law's recipe but I didn't have it on hand at the time, so found this one. We even had it the next morning and it was very good then too. I used homemade bread because I had some leftover, and turkey sausage, but other than that followed the recipe.  thanks!!

Although super convenient to make and have on Christmas morning, I thought it was too rich.  The sausage, cheese and cream soup made it very rich and heavy.  Maybe served as a brunch food along with other things or with toast, it would be better.

It taste like an omlette. A little plain for my liking. I will add other ingredients next time. Maybe some chopped veggies. Try adding the ingredients you like in your omlette. I used maple sausage. I also baked at 325 for 1 hour until the edges browned.

I love this recipe!  I make it for the teens in our youth department frenquently!  I make it exactly like it says and it turns out perfect every time!!!  Very much a comfort breakfast!  
You can vary it up though by cooking sausage with onion and green pepper or even adding or substituting bacon!  but perfect as is!!

I started this recipe and then realized it needed overnight prep.  So I mixed the eggs and bread and cooked it in an electric skillet then proceeded.  It turned out great!

I make this all of the time.  It is my favorite for a large crowd or when I have company stay over.  I use French bread or Italian bread and I let the potatoes defrost in the fridge.  Comes out perfect.  I love it and I don't like eggs!

Took a lot longer to bake since I covered it with foil. I had to raise the baking temperature to get the top to brown and the middle to firm up. Otherwise, excellent results and the fam loved it!!

Subbed seasoned croutons for bread, Omitted salt, cut cheese in half and used cream of celery (hate mushrooms). Next time will add peppers and onions. Would have been pretty bland without the seasoned croutons. Great base recipe for modifying.

I used to make this recipe for years, then my sister-in-law said she started using egg substitute and replaced the sausage with 6 oz. of Canadian bacon cut into 1" pcs. and low fat cheese to reduce the cholesterol...I tried it and my family loved the change!

Yum! I tweeked things slightly due to ingredients I had on hand but still tasted great! Used pilsbury biscuits cut into quarters instead of bread and cream of celery soup, no added salt but added pepper instead. Great recipe, definitely a keeper!

OMG!  Unbelievably good.  Went right by the recipe.  Had my doubts when preparing it, but the smell as it cooked and the compliments from my pickiest eaters let me know it was a total success.  (I forgot.  There was one change, but only because I only had hot sausage.  Will probably make the next one with hot also because my family likes a little heat.)  Try this!!!  And if you doubt the mushroom soup, don't.  You can't taste the soup at all.  It's just a wonderful, creamy, comfort dish.

I used Turkey Italian sausage an O'Brien potatoes, cooking the potatoes with the the sausage before mixing it with the other ingredients. Using other suggestions, I baked it for 50 minutes. This was a hit with my family. We're making this for the holidays for sure.
