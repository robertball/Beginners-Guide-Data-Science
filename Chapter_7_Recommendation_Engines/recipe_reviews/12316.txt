Don't bother with the butter; you don't need it at all. And do NOT--as some other reviewers have suggested--mix up the flour/sugar mixture with the fruit before adding the fruit to the pie shell. The reason you want copious amounts of sugar both on the bottom and on the top of the fruit (rather than mixed amongst it) is that while baking, the bubbling-hot sugar carmelizes in contact with the bottom and top crusts, a process which makes the crusts rather crispy in the final product. If you mix the sugar up with the fruit, you don't get that crispy crust, and the large amount of water in the rhubarb will definitely make the bottom crust sodden. Don't worry: the sugar makes its way through the fruit anyway, so you won't have parts of the pie too sweet and other parts too tart.

I won $100 for 1st prize in a rhubarb pie baking contest with this recipe.  The only thing I did different, since I used green rhubarb, was tint the sugar with 2 drops of red food coloring before adding the flour.  I also sprinkled a little sugar on top the crust.  I used Pie Crust I from this site.
Update 5/20/07
I won the rhubarb pie contest and the $100 prize again yesterday with this recipe.  Since I made a 10 inch pie, I used 5 cups rhubarb, 1 2/3 cups sugar, 7 1/2 T flour, and 1 T butter.  I added 3 drops red food color to the sugar.  This pie is definitely a winner!

AMAZING PIE!!!!  So simple...so easy! I thought for sure that it would turn out too sweet because it seemed like a lot of sugar.  But it was perfect!  You still get that tart zip of the rhubarb that I love!  I also added some cinnamon to the sugar mixture..just because I love that flavor. Make sure to put some of the sugar mixture on the bottom like the recipe states.  This forms a layer under the rhubarb while baking, so that the crust doesn't get soggy.  My dad said that this pie tastes almost identical to the one his Mom used to make.  That alone will make me use this recipe over and over again! Thanks

I have been making great rhubarb pies for 25 years and they always were somewhat soupy. I have tried both tapioca and flour for thickening. This recipe gives the right balance of ingredients to give you a perfect pie. Thanks for a keeper.

I made this pie using fresh rhubarb and Splenda sugar (used only 1 cup of splenda) and it turned out GREAT!!! I brushed the pie crust with egg and sprinkled lightly with white sugar and it looked as pretty as it tasted! This is definately a keeper!

This was fabulous.  I did make some little changes tho--I upped the rhubarb per pie to 6cups (could have done fine with 8 I think), kept sugar at 1 1/3 cup, upped the flour by half for a non-running pie...added 1 tsp cinnamon to the flour/sugar mix, and a few drops of vanilla to the pie all around, before baking..milk and sugar on top before baking made a flaky, crispy top crust--gosh but the kids LOVED THIS, so did the husband...out of vanilla ice cream so used some RediWhip instead.  Did 2 of these today, but next time I'll do 3 or 4 on one day.  SUPER RECIPE, THANKS!

Great basic recipe that does the trick for rhubarb lovers! Perfect combination of tart & sweet.  My only suggestion is to brush the top of the pie with one egg mixed with a tbsp water and sprinkle with sugar.  Repeat about halfway through.  Helps keep the crust from browing too fast and gives it a really sweet crispy finish. LOVE THIS RECIPE!

This pie is delicious!  It's just like my grandmother's.  The only thing I forgot to do was put some foil around the edge of the pie crust for the first fifteen minutes to prevent over browning.

I liked this recipe.  I tried it with only rhubarb and then the next time with strawberries and rhubarb.  It was too sweet when I added strawberries and runny.  I recommend using only rhubarb and not adding strawberries.  With rhubarb, it was GREAT!!!

A nice recipe and practically the same as the one I use, although I prefer to mix the cut-up rhubarb with the flour-sugar mixture and let it stand in a bowl, stirring now and then, while I made the crust.

Here are two tips (I've been making pies for over 40 years and they tell me I'm good at it):  as a thickener for pies, flour can be unreliable, and I've had several failures using flour as a thickener in rhubarb pie (also in blueberry pie) although in apple pie it always works fine.  So for the past 20 years or so I've used Minute Tapioca instead of flour as a thickener in rhubarb, cherry and blueberry pies, and the results are always perfect.  No more rhubarb soup!  Use half as much tapioca as you would use flour (in this recipe, 3 tablespoons of tapioca instead of the 6 tablespoons of flour.)  Another tip:  if you feel your rhubarb is not pink enough for an attractive filling, color the sugar pink before using it.  Just put a few drops of red food coloring in a bowl, add the sugar and use a whisk to blend, or else put the color and sugar into a container with a tight-fitting lid that you can shake. If it doesn't blend thoroughly, don't worry--once the sugar and rhubarb are mixed and the sugar dissolves, the color will spread evenly in the filling.

Oh, I hope all 22,000+ people who have saved this recipe give it a try at least once in their lifetime ... its that wonderful, Carol!!  5-Star plus!!  Thanks so much for the best recipe for my favorite pie!  Please folks, don't change a thing, don't add a thing.  The pie thickens perfectly, the ingredient amounts are just right, the oven time is right on, and the fruit does just fine all on its own for flavor and freshness.  You won't be disappointed!!  The sugar layer totally makes for an awesome crust and pouring the rest over the fruit doesn't get any easier.  Save yourself concerns or worries, don't over think it ... just make as is.  I even used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts and no one cared ... all raves and so hard to not go back for seconds.  But DON'T because next day pie is even better!! Only thing I would mention that I don't believe Carol stated, is after placing hte top crust and sealing the edges, considerd cutting a couple slits in the top for venting.  This does help control seepage.  Wondering just how much rhubarb my mother-in-law has left in her yard!!  :o)

I had to use frozen rhubarb.  A one pound bag contains the 4 cups called for. It came out great. The second time I made it I didn't let the frozen rhubarb thaw out enough and it took too long to cook.  So, the moral is that 1 pound of frozen rhubarb is fine, but make sure to thaw it completely.  :-P

make sure you DISCARD all of the leaf portion of the plant!!! The leaves of rhubarb are POISONOUS.  Seriously.  Just use the stalk portion.  Other than that, its a fantastic recipe!!

OMG - I didn't realize how easy it was to make such an incredible pie!!! Haven't had a decent rhubarb pie since childhood when great grandma used to make them...I didn't appreciate them as much in my youth so never got her recipe :( This is EASY & INCREDIBLE!!! Followed recipe & directions EXACTLY, used a store-bought crust but nobody noticed because the filling was so darn delicious! Even people who claim not to like rhubarb LOVED this pie! I would like to give it 10 stars!!! Thank you!!

The rhubarb pie as is turns out fabulous. Add 1 lb of sliced strawberries to the mix and it becomes OUTSTANDING. I mean, we like the original, but with the strawberries, it was like, "Where have you been all my life?" I didn't do anything differently to this recipe other than add the strawberries (no extra sugar/flour, nothing). Used the Pie Crust I from this site as suggested by the reader who won first prize in a baking contest. Dude, try it with the strawberries and you'll wonder how plain rhubarb ever one 1st prize:)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Cover the edges of the pie with bits of tin foil before placing in the oven so that the edges don't burn.

"I didn't think I liked Rhubarb Pie.  My mother didn't make it often because she didn't like it.  Now I know she didn't put enough sugar in it. She would have liked this one.  This is the best Rhubarb pie I ever ate.  It's a keeper.  I love it."  The Other Half's Review while stuffing pie.  I got some lovely garnet colored rhubarb at Wegman's and decided to try a "plain" Rhubarb Pie.  This exceeded expectations.  I did remove the butter because of a heart diet and I did add a sprinkle of nutmeg because I really liked the nutmeg in a strawberry and rhubarb pie recipe I have as a keeper.  Now I have a great plain rhubarb pie recipe.  Thank you for posting this.  It is perfect and that is from a former Rhubarb picky hater who doesn't actually like Rhubarb.  Now if you could just do Salmon to taste like a T-bone steak for me..

This is "THE" Rhubarb Pie recipe!!!  I made it exactly as written and it turned out perfect!  Best looking and tasting pie I have ever made.  Very easy and fool proof.  This will be the ONLY rhubarb pie recipe that I will ever make.  The bottom crust did not get soggy at all and the filling did not pour out when cut.  Just absolutely perfect!  Worth 10 Stars! **********

Everytime I make this pie, I get nothing but compliments.  This time I made my own pie crusts from a simple recipe from this site.  2 cups flour, 2/3 canola oil, 6 Tbsp of ice water, mix together and perfect pie crusts.  I'm not spending $5 for pie shells when this one is so tasty and easy to make.  It made an even better compliment to the already fantastic Rhubarb Pie topped off with rich vanilla ice cream or homemade whip cream.   YUM, YUM, YUM.  I live in an area where when rhubarb is gone it's gone.  So I buy up as much as I can from the market, freeze it and save for the next pie.  So simple and delicious, I just love this recipe.

I will never make another version.  This pie turned out BEAUTIFUL!  I latticed the top and brushed the crust with egg white and spinkled suger lightly over the top of the pie.  SOOO wonderful!  Not runny like many pies.  Follow directions on original recipe..do not change anything!

EDIT:  Since rhubarb is pretty pricey, I thought I'd add that about seven good-sized stalks makes four cups.  Delicious and easy!  I'd never had rhubarb pie, but my husband had enjoyed it growing up, so I tried this for his birthday.  Make sure the rhubarb has a dark red color....otherwise it is likely not ripe enough.

I love rhubarb.  Rhubarb in almost any capacity.  But there is nothing quite like this pure, unadulerated and sweetly savory recipe.  It is absolutely foolproof.  No sogginess at the bottom of the pie pan.  No half cooked rhubarb.  Not too tart and not too sweet, it brings out the gorgeous flavor of rhubarb.  I have seen this pie consumed in one sitting and people actually LICK the pie pan!  Do yourself a favor and make TWO.  One for your guests and one for yourself.  Quite simply, this is THE best rhubarb pipe recipe I have ever come across.

Very good with plenty of sugar to offset the usual tartness of rhubarb.  I used frozen rhubarb (unable to find fresh) and it turned out great.

I'm the baker of the family and generally like to try new/different things for holidays so when I saw this recipe I grabbed it right away and decided this would be one of the new desserts this year.  I mentioned it to my family members before making and and the consensus response was 'ugh don't make rhubarb pie, we HATE rhubarb!'  But, it was in my head and wanted to make it anyway.  Well, let's just say this pie was the biggest hit at the dessert table (even after competing against some long time favorites).  I will be making this a regular Easter recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly - no changes.  The only thing I would do next time is go for a little more than 4 cups of rhubarb.  It really shrinks down when it cooks and I wasn't left with as thick of a pie as is pictured - mine was a bit thinner.  All in all - this recipe has changed Easter dessert at my house!

I made this last night right after I picked rhubarb and it WAS FANTASTIC!!! I always make my pies these days in a round cake pan (more filling and nice high and even all around) I modified as some other raters advised and mixed up to fill and to fit & fill the cake pan-- 5 1/2 C of Rhubarb, 1- 1/3 sugar, 7.5 T flour and about 1 cup strawberries. It was NOT soupy and on a scale from 1-10 my husband & kids (18 & 20) rated it a 12!! :)
  Now back to the garden to pick & freeze!!

I was not expecting this to be awesome without the sweetness of strawberries, which seem to always accompany rhubarb.  But I only had rubarb and gave it a try anyway.  So glad I took that chance! My 17-year-old daughter said it was the best pie she ever ate and it was so pretty too.  The only changes I made were: I used 5 cups of rhubarb just because that's what I had here.  I upped the sugar/flour ratio accordingly.  I added a few drops of red food coloring just for looks.  I will make this again for sure.  In fact, it may become a father's day gift for my dad:)

This is a long time family standard. The slight change in my recipe is the addition and mix of brown sugar (1/3 cup) to a 1 cup white sugar/flour mix plus a small (1/8 tsp) of nutmeg. I add the nutmeg only to the sugar/flour mix that is sprinkled over the rhubarb. The brown sugar makes the rhubarb less tart but does not overpower it with sweetness and the nutmeg is a personal flavour taste.

This is the recipe Grandma always made, but she would often sub in two cups of halved strawberries. I only used 1 cup of sugar as even that seemed like a lot for this. During the last few minutes of baking, the topping bubbled over a bit, so I was SO glad I put a pan on the lowest rack to catch any drippings. Like Grandma's hand-written recipe says, I just kept it at 400 the entire time...baked beautifully in about 45 minutes.

Yep, this is great rhubarb pie.
I used freshly picked rhubarb and followed the recipe exactly. The bottom crust was nicely baked, not the least bit soggy.
I will use this recipe from now on instead of the one I've used for 20 plus years, which says to toss the rhubarb in sugar and flour before filling the crust.
The filling was nice and juicy but not the least bit runny. It was the perfect blend of sugar and flour. When you eat rhubarb pie, you want to taste rhubarb, right?

SUPERB pie. Added 1 cup of strawberries; reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of Splenda to compensate the sweetness. Brushed top crust with egg wash and cut 4 slits for venting. Used a deep pie dish and didn´t have problems with any syrup spilling out. Flaky crust; no problem with sogginess and just the right amount of tang.
Update: Made it again but with added bottled cherries and fresh strawberries. Beautiful color and flavor.

yum yum yum!! I used a store bought crust because I had it on hand, and I used about 5 1/2 cups of rhubarb per others notes... otherwise I did this pie EXACTLY as it says. SOOOO yummy. No mushy crust, not too sweet... this was my first attempt at rhubarb anything, and I took it to a friends house who'd never had rhubarb  before... she loved it! came back for seconds! This is a winner!! Will attempt to eventually make my own crust, but will keep coming back to this recipe :) SOOOO simple and so good. Thanks Carol!!

This pie turned out perfectly, I followed the instructions to a T, and absolutely delicious!  I was looking for a rhubarb pie recipe which would be similar to what my Grandmother always made years ago, and I do believe that this is it.  Thank you for posting this.  I will make many more. :)

This pie is sooo good!!! I love the flavor and the crispy crust on the bottom is perfect. This was the first real pie i've ever made, and I feel like a pastry chef! My first one was last year. Now I make one every 2 weeks(in season) or when I can get to the farmers market!! I'm growing my own Rhubarb but it  takes several years before you can harvest it!!!

GREAT pie! I modified a few things though. I used 1/2 c. splenda and 1/2 c. real sugar (a little tart, which I like). I sprinkled 1/2 the sugar/flour mixture on the bottom, 1/4 halfway through the rhubarb, remaining 1/4 on the top. I skipped the butter per other reviewers' suggestions. Instead of a double crust, I just made an extra 1/2 recipe of crust, which was sufficient to make a lattice.  I brushed the top of the lattice with milk. I baked covered in foil for first 15 minutes at 450, then turned down to 350 and uncovered for 45 minutes.  About 15 minutes before the pie was done, I sprinkled a few tablespoons of water on the pie because I did not see liquid bubbling (I think more moisture escapes through a lattice top than a double crust). This caused the pie to be sufficiently moist without being runny at all.  I let sit for 2 hours before cutting.

Wow -- perfect balance of tart and sweet. Lovely crispy crust. But as another reviewer said, you really need to put tinfoil around the edges for the first 15 minutes of cooking (at the higher temperature) or they'll be burnt. In my oven, anyways!

By far the best rhubarb pie I have ever made!!! I have made this one three times now. For the people who were getting the granulated sugar...make sure you sift the flour and sugar together good before putting it in the pie, that should take care of the problem.

Okay, this was almost too easy, but I made this pie according to the directions. I cheated and used store-bought crust. Literally took me 5 minutes to put the pie together. Kids loved it! It was very tasty. I used green rhubarb, which doesn't look as pretty as red, but tastes great!

We made this the other week for my Dad and it was fabulous!  Best I have had and so simple.  We used frozen rhubarb, 2 - 12oz bags.  Next time we may even use more, we like it tart, so we did not add anymore sugar. Can't wait to make it again!

1-1/3 cups of sugar seems like a lot.  I used 1/2 cup of Agave (organic sweetener) and it was delicious.  Next time I'll try 1/4 cup.

I love rhubarb pie and this recipe is the same one that I got from my mother.  Fresh rhubarb in our local grocery store is quite expensive now.  (lucky you if you have your own) One pound of fresh will be about 3 cups if you don't have to trim it too much.

Lots of folks out there do not like rhubarb pie.  Don't know why, they just don't.  But that is not the issue here, you know, other folks.  Now I like rhubarb pie.  It probably that southern gene in me.  And this pie is one of the best that I have ever tasted.  Carol....you go girl!

Very good!  I have made different versions, a lot of them with egg and this is better by far.  Nothing to mess with the great taste of the rhubarb and not too sweet.  My husband loved it!  Make sure to put some foil on the bottom rack just in case it runs over.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and used store bought crust.

Best Rhubarb pie ever!  My father's favorite pie is rhubarb- he loved it!  I added 2 tablespoons of cinnamon as the last step before the butter.

This is the BEST rhubarb pie.  I've made it three times now.  I can't believe how quick & easy it is to make...yet the rave reviews made me feel like I'd spent hours on it.  A few suggestions:  leave out the butter - you won't miss it at all.  Use a deep dish pie crust or slightly less rhubarb (when using a regular crust mine spilled over a bit).  Don't mix the fruit together with the flour/sugar mixture. Trust me  :)

Delicious!  I love how the bottom crust was crisp, not soggy.  I used 4 cups of rhubarb I had in my freezer and I could not tell any difference between frozen and fresh rhubarb.  Super easy to make and yummy.  Great recipe to use for all my frozen rhubarb! :) Thank you Carol!

Good recipe but WAY too sweet for me. My mom used to grow rhubarb and make a much tarter version of this pie. This is not really a criticism as we all have different tastes. That said, I can't wait to make this pie again using about half the sugar that was called for here. That way you can taste the rhubarb and you get a nice sweet and tart flavor.

Excellent -- this made the crispest bottom crust I've ever had in a pie. The key is in the way that the sugar/ flour mixture is divided and placed. Genius! My husband thought it was the best rhubarb he had ever had (and he grew up with rhubarb bushes and will not concede this on any other pie over his mother's amazing pies). I like my rhubarb pie a bit more tart so I will reduce the sugar slightly next time, but my family thought it was perfect just the way it was.

Rhubarb does not get ripe.  You can use the stem if it's only a few inches long.  That way you can have rhubarb pie in March if the weather has been favorable.  Also, it should not be harvested after July. It needs the rest of the summer just to itself.  I once gave a neighbor a big armful of rhubarb in July, and the plant was dead the next year.

There's rhubarb growing in the garden and we decided to start experimenting.  Best.  Pie.  Ever.  I minced it really tiny and used a little more that the four cups it calls for.

Lovely pie - putting sugar mixture on the bottom crust definitely kept it from getting soggy. However, the sugar on top didn't work out so well, I would suggest putting the layer of sugar on the bottom crust and then mixing the remainder with the fruit. As written, I just got chunks of sugar on the top, the distribution wasn't there.

Delicious! I was a bit skeptical about making this without any strawberries and using frozen rhubarb instead of fresh, but it tasted GREAT! I used the exact amt of sugar the recipe called for and I thought it was the perfect amount. So did my husband. :)

I made this today for my 90-year old mom -- it's her favorite pie. I come from a family of pie makers, so I've made lots of pies. This is one of the best I've ever made. The suggestion to put the sugar/flour in the bottom makes a fabulous pie. My previous rhubarb pies tasted good but were usually pretty runny/soupy. This one held together beautifully. I followed the directions pretty closely and my mom (and I) both loved it!!

I've made this pie twice now and it has turned out perfect both times!  Best Rhubarb pie recipe I've ever had!  My husband loves that you can still taste the tartness of the rhubarb, which makes it perfect paired with vanilla ice cream!  Thanks for sharing!  :)

Absolutely wonderful.I did add 1 1/2 cups sliced strawberries & increased the flour to 7 1/2 tbsp. It was perfect. Just sweet enough, just tart enough,& it was not runny, not floury tasting. I will make it again, with & without the strawberries. I also want to try other friut pies & do the sugar ,flour mixture the same way to see if the bottom  crust turns out the same way. This is a definite KEEPER thanks for the recipe!

Spectacular. Because of the flour/sugar combination that's poured into the crust before and after the rhubarb, the filling is not at all watery. The pie doesn't run when cut. The flavor is great- not too tart and not tooo sweet.

I made this last night using fresh rhubarb from a local farm.  As my husband was getting up to get his second piece he said, "This is probably the best pie I've ever had.  It's even better than Marie Calendar's."  Thanks for providing a wonderful new recipe to add to my cookbook!!!  It really is delicious (and I even forgot to use the 1 TBS of butter on top)!

This was great. I remembered my Mom's pies growing up..tart yet sweet...good eats! I started growing my own rhubarb planning ahead for my 'own' pies. My good friend (neighbor) had company come in from out west. I knew he had not had a good rhubarb pie for years because he always admired my rhubarb crop growing beside the house. I made your pie and took it over(I kept one for me). They all loved it...what was not eaten that night was consumed for breakfast the next morning. My daughter-in-law tasted mine (never had it before) and discovered a new love...
thanks for sharing

...used frozen fruit instead of fresh; granular Splenda instead of sugar (adding 1/3 cup extra for more sweetness and using 2 tbsp. more of flour to compensate for the absence of the thickening effect of real sugar),mixed up the sweetener and flour with the fruit before putting into the crust, and used an extra tbsp. of butter...

...the pie came out PERFECT!!!...thank you, thank you, thank you!!! - from me (who's never had a rhubarb pie before) and my husband (who's been "belly-aching" for a rhubarb pie - not readily available from where we are - for quite sometime).

I have wanted to make a rhubarb pie for my husband of 26 years after hearing about the ones his Grandma use to make but you know how that goes. I have had this particular recipe saved for a few years and finally decided to make it when his Mom gave me some rhubarb she had grown. I went exactly by the recipe and used Perfect Pie Crust II from this site also. He wasn't home when I made it, so I sent him a picture on his phone and he was worried it wouldn't still be warm by the time he got home. His words after savoring the first piece: "I really hate to say this being she was my grandmother, but this is better than hers. It has the perfect amount of tart versus sweet. He thanked me numerous times for bringing so many great memories back to him. I will definitely be making this for him often. Thank you so much, Carol!!!!!

It is hands down the best rhubarb pie I've ever had!  I agree with the reviewers who reinforce NOT mixing the sugar/flour with rhubarb beforehand!   The sugar on top and bottom of filling makes a wonderful sweet crispy crust that makes this pie extra delicious!!  Made it exactly as above and would not change a single thing!

I cook the rhubarb first before placing it in the pie crust. 4 cups chopped rhubarb, 1.5 cups sugar, about a 2 tsp of corn starch mixed with 1/3 cup of water. I also add a few drops of red food coloring for looks. Boil down just until it starts to thicken and then pour in pie crust, put top crust on and bake at 350 until crust is light brown, about half hour - 45 minutes. Enjoy!

Superb recipe!  So quick and easy to make!  My husband and I ate it hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream.  Was great cold too!  Delicious flavor from our fresh, organically grown rhubarb.  Held its shape beautifully!  Definitely a keeper.

This is the WORST pie recipe I have ever made. I am a pastry chef, and never have I encountered a recipe that so disabuses the beauty of the very ingredient which it is supposed to highlight. After reading other reviews, I decided to follow the specific instructions to sprinkle the sugar/flour mixture on the bottom of the pie, and then again over the top of the rhubarb. While I put even more rhubarb than the recipe in fact called for, the centre of my pie was nothing but sugar - completely overpowering the rhubarb! If you care at all about preserving the rhubarb flavour in your pie, FIND ANOTHER RECIPE.

I would like to add another great tip.....When making the pie crust I always use the crisco recipe but I subsitute the water for orange juice(only with rhubarb pie). I also put about two tablespoons of orange juice dotted around the rhrbarb after you place the rhubarb in the pie. This cuts down the tart tast and makes a balanced taste. Just try it once and you will see!

This is the best and easiest pie recipe ever!  Everyone loved it last year at Christmas and now it has been requested this year for Thanksgiving.  I made it several times and followed the recipe exactly using frozen rhubarb (thawed and drained/dried) and store bought crust - it was great.  All of the tips for covering the crust edges, egg and water brushed on the top with sugar were helpful too.  I did make one with a few drops of almond extract and it was very yummy if you like that flavor.  I'm going to try one with a little of the cinnamon as somone suggested.

I made this exactly as it was written and it turned out perfectly. This was my first time making rhubarb pie and the results were great.  I was worried it would be too sweet because it seemed like so much sugar but it was just right, the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  I'll be making this again for sure.

I totally messed this up, mixing the sugar into the fruit, and yes it did come out very wet. Everyone still loved it, said it tasted like their mom's. I certainly will follow the recipe next time!

It pains me to admit that this was better than my Grandma's recipe! Her pie was always delicious but the filling never set up completely and she could never figure out why. THIS pie was delicious AND perfectly set and I think it has everything to do with not mixing the sugar and flour with the rhubarb before pouring it all into the pastry. That's the only thing I can think of that my Grandma did differently. I believe that part is key to the recipe so follow the instructions exactly and you will end up with a perfect pie!

I was really pleased to find that this pie held together really well.  Tasted just like my mom's except hers was always runny.  I'm going to add some strawberries to it next time.

This truly is a delicious pie. To add red to my green rhubarb I sprinkled just a dusting of strawberry jello on the fruit before adding the butter and top crust. Fabulous raves from friends and family. Getting requests to remake daily and I have baked 6 Rhubarb pies this season.

Excellent!  I would add more rhubarb next time (probably adjust the sugar as well). It cooks down and we like thick pies. But this may be our Memorial tradition in our house.

I hate to do this with all the rave reviews this pie got, but it turned out aweful for me.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made this for a party, let it sit overnight, it looked beautiful!  When i cut it the next day, the filling was cloudy and lumpy.  There were slimy pieces of the flour mixture everywhere.  Next time, I would mix the flour/sugar in with the rhubarb before cooking like I have done in every other pie recipe like this.

This was the best rhubarb pie! I followed exactly except using measurements one of the reviewers suggested for a larger pie (with 5 cups rhubarb). I did sprinkle the top crust with sugar. Next time I'll use an egg wash to get the pretty gloss I see on other reviewers pies. I'm keeping this recipe in my favorites. Thanks for sharing

Way too sweet!  Good consistency.  Tip to use 1/4 of the sugar/flour mixture underneath the rhubard filling was a good one.

This is THE new family recipe for Rhubarb Pie! It is perfect, and no soggy bottom crust! I will probably be trying this technique on other fruit pies. It worked beautifully! The things I changed were, I used 6 cups of Rhubarb. I always use 6 cups of fruit for my fruit pies, as I like a fuller pie.  I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 granulated 0 calorie sweetener together equaling 1 1/3 cop as suggested for 4 C. Rhubarb, (as we like tart pies) and used 1/3 Cup +1 Tbls Flour because of the extra fruit. I like a tart fruit pie. Did everything else just the same. You should try this recipe. We will be using this ALWAYS! Thank you Carol for sharing your Mom's wonderful recipe!

First, I must say that I am 42 years old and only made pie 2 times in my life.  I made this pie to take to a church function.  It was a totally big hit.  Everyone wanted to Rhubarb Pie.  I did omit the butter only because I forgot to add it, but I don't think it took anything away from the taste.  I will now be making pie a lot more often.  Thanks for the great recipe

Great pie but cover the edges with foil!!! I have never seen an easier pie recipe. This was fast and required minimal ingredients. The pie came out wonderfully but by the time it occurred to cover the edges it was too late. That first 15 minutes is the critical moment. I'll upload a pic of the next one. I also used a total of 5 cups so that all spaces were filled. 4 stalks of medium thickness worked for me.

Very good esp. putting a portion of the sugar mixture on the bottom of the pie shell.  I used 5 cups for 9 inch pie and that seemed to be perfect.  Also, I like the tartness to come through so I use 1/4 cup of sugar per cup of of Rhubarb.  Cooking time was accurate for my oven.

Now this was a good recipe.  I wouldn't have done this to make it better but I had some blueberries that needed used so I just threw them in...about a cup.  Beautiful and oh my goodness was it ever good.  I'm even going to enter it in our local County Fair.  Thanks so much for sharing this.

Excellent flavor, but I had some issues with the final product.  The sugar/flour I put on the top didn't all get down into the pie, and I had several clumps of crystallized sugar scattered about.  Also, not all the rhubarb got cooked, so there were bites of crunchy rhubarb mixed in there as well, which distracted from the flavor.

I made this for my father-in-law as a thank you for helping us out with the tons of yardwork he did for us this summer.  Rhubarb pie is his favorite and I had never made one before.  He called the next day to say it was one of the best he's ever had ("And I've had a lot!") and that it tasted like a pie from a professional bakery.  Wow! I have yet to try it myself, but if he's happy I'm happy.

This is the same as my pie recipe, except that I always add a dash of salt to the pie and egg wash the top of the pie crust.  The last step is to sprinkle a thin layer of sugar over the top of the egg wash.  My granddaughters thought that I made a showpiece pie that was varnished.  It was beautiful and looked just like those in gift shops being sold for decorations.  Try this.  Also be sure to put foil over the edges of the pie of the about half way through baking to protect the edges.

Best Rhubarb Pie recipe I've ever made!  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and an additional Tbsp. of flour as I've always had a problem with a runny rhubarb pie in the past.  Will make again!

Very easy and delicious! One of the best rhubarb pies I've had. I made mine with 6 cups of rhubarb, 8 T flour and 1 3/4 C Sugar.  I dotted with butter and baked as directed.

The pie was really great, but it was still really runny and I followed the recipe perfectly, should I have maybe cooked the rhubarb first? Any tips would be appreciated!

My mother made this pie with the same ingredients but only used 1 cup of sugar. Also, she just mixed the dry ingredients together and then stirred the rhubarb in with it and put it in pie plate. Just baked at 350 for 50 minutes in center of oven or till crust was brown. She always brushed her top crust with milk and she sprinkled sugar on top.

I have never had rhubarb before and I wanted to make one for my grandpa since it is his favorite pie. I searched very carefully and I am so glad I chose this recipe. He loved it and he is a tough critic. I used my own pie crust from this site and even to me (never tasting rhubarb before)  this pie was surprisingly good & so easy to make.

I made this delicious pie for a neighbourhood dinner.  Both my husband, who LOVES rhubard and our neighbour who isn't a fan, LOVED this recipe.  If this recipe can please both fans and foes, it is a keeper.  I will be making this again and again.  The crust stayed nice and flaky as I sprinkled part of the sugar mixture on the bottom.  I also used a little red food colouring to keep things red.

I made this pie tonite and got RAVE reviews from the family.  I used refrigerated pre-made pie crust to save time.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  I did brush the top crust with egg and sprinkled it with sugar before baking.  It came out glossy and perfectly done.  Daughter said that this is her new favorite pie. I cant wait to make it again with my own pie crust recipe. Thanks Carol.

Oh my goodness.  This pie is life changing.  With such simple ingredients, I thought it would come out bland, but it was AMAZING!  My hubby and I gobbled up the WHOLE deep dish pie in under 24 hours.  This pie is even BETTER after it has been sitting in the fridge for several hours.  This pie will have you sneaking down the kitchen in the middle of the night to have a second slice!  HIGHLY recommended!

This recipe really is easy as pie, it allows for the natural flavor of the rhubarb which is great.  I reduced the sugar as I like things on the tart side.  If you have never made a pie before this is a good start, and if you are an accomplished pie baker this is a great starting point.

So simple yet so delicious!  Used a store-bought crust.  My only change was to add 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the flour mixture and to brush top crust with egg and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  Will definitely make again and again!

Never made a pie before as I'm terrible at baking but I decided to give this a shot as I had some rhubarb and had guests over for Memorial Day. Recipe turned out fabulous and my guests were impressed! I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will cut out some of the sugar - I have a sweet tooth but this was even just a little too sweet for me, although my husband and my guests told me they wouldn't have changed a thing. I'm making this again over the weekend - simply delicious and SO easy.

This pie is absolutely the best.  It was so easy, didn't run all over the oven and I'll be making this over and over since I've got loads of rhubarb in my freezer.

I've been making Rhubarb Pie for 30 years, but this recipe is far and away better than the one I've always used. My kids, who thought they hated Rhubarb Pie, absolutely loved this one. Thanks for sharing it!

We haven't tried the pie yet.  The ingredients and amounts were close to what I use, so no biggie.  But the baking instructions.. cooking it on the bottom shelf of the oven made a big difference.  The pie is evenly browned and the edges are not, I repeat NOT 'burnt'.  I am so happy. I hate to cook, but once a year I make a family friend a rhubarb pie just for fun.  I have some strawberry glaze he can pour on top of the vanilla ice cream he will use on top of the pie.  He is a sugarholic. thanks for having this the first recipe I looked for, and it turned out perfect!

With a few minor changes this recipe was superb!  My Mom said it tasted just like a restaurant in Nova-Scotia's pie!!!  I cut back on the rhubarb and added strawberries, about 3cups of rhubarb and 1cup of strawberries though I don't measure, I simply fill the pie crust.  I also added a 'dab' of vanilla  I used, as suggested by others, the tin foil around the edges of the crust for the first 15 minutes and that works well in that the crust doesn't burn.  I also vented the top pie crust before baking by pricking several times with a fork.

Fantastic recipe.  I thought that I had ruined the pie as I mixed up the rhubarb with the flour and sugar and let it sit while making my crust (I was going to use store bought and then thought better of it and went with the standard crisco recipe) so that it was quite soupy by the time it made it in the pie. When putting the top crust on, I stuck about 5  penne pasta to allow the juices to release.  Then I realized I had forgotten the butter.

After reading all of the reviews I was sure that the pie would be a gloppy mess, but I am happy to say it wasn't.

I did add in a few strawberries and after baking the first 15 minutes, I sprinkled sugar on top.  It took about 50 minutes total and was out of this world!

I'm eager to try the recipe again with putting the sugar flour mixture underneath and on top of the rhubarb to see how much better it makes it.

I was given some fresh rhubarb today, and decided to make this particular pie since I had no other fruit on hand to mix with it.

This is simply FABULOUS.  Follow the directions the way they are (put the tin foil around the edge for the first 1/2 hour) and I did follow the recipe to a "T" and it was PERFECT.  The pie crust I was was from the Pioneer Lady cooking blog - and it was perfect pastry.

I made this with Splenda!  I'm sure it's better made with sugar, but it turned out ok; actually much better than ok.  My boyfriend requested rhubarb pie for his birthday and he's diabetic.  That's the only reason I made it sugar-free.  He loved it.  I sprinkled Splenda on top, but that didn't work.  I also used frozen rhubarb, therefore baked the pie an extra 20 minutes.

Mmm!  Grew up eating rhubarb but hadn't had it in years.  Got a craving for it and asked around until I found someone willing to give us a supply of it.  My "normal" would be another fruit mixed with the rhubarb and a cobbler instead of a pie.  Opted for this only because it saved me a trip to the store since all ingreds were on hand.  I am SO GLAD I stepped outside my norm as this was a delicious recipe!  Got thumbs up all around the table... even the picky child loved it and asked if we could plant rhubarb just for the purpose of making this pie.  A definite winner!

I had never made a pie before, and didn't even know what rhubarb was supposed to taste like, but this turned out great! I made it for my boyfriend because it is his favorite, and he said it was the best rhubarb pie he had had since he was a kid! I followed recipe exactly, and did the criss-cross thing with the dough and brushed with a little butter and sprinkled on sugar. I really enjoyed this pie and will surely make it again! :)

After trying several pie recipes to use our Rhubarb in, this is the one. Comes out right every time. I follow the recipe exactly. I use a frozen pie shell for the bottom, and store bought rolled up pie crust for the top, but I re-roll it so that it's a little thicker, then brush it with butter right at the end and sprinkle a little sugar over that. It really doesn't get any easier than this.

This is the same recipe my mother used, and it is my absolutely favorite pie. It doesn't matter if you use the butter or not, and mixing the fruit with the flour/sugar comes out the same as not, since you put a quarter of the mix on the bottom crust and there is so much of the sugar-flour mix, that when you dump it into the shell, there's so much left over that sits on top.

It's so simple and wonderful! I would just make sure to coat the rhubarb with a little extra flour so the pie isn't too runny. Yum!

It was ok, sweetness was perfect but I think the consistency was a little off... a little more flour perhaps, or that elusive egg! lol  I will try it again and alter it a bit.  Thanx!

This is good but I think it is better if you combine all of the flour/sugar mixture with the rhubarb prior to filling the crust. This is also even better with an Orange Pastry (using OJ instead of water).

This is a very easy recipe. I followed it exactly, and the results were most pleasing. 
Very tasty, not too sweet. Thanks!

This was a great recipe.  My Dad likes plain old rhubarb pie with no strawberries or anything in it.  I finally found a recipe that he says tastes like his mom used to make it.  It's kinda tart and sweet like the old days.

Fantastic Pie!!  I used the 2 cups of sugar, added a few strawberries, sprinkled on a little Cointreau (maybe a teaspoon), brushed the top crust with egg white & a dusting of sugar.  It was so good, my husband who doesn't even like rhubarb immediately ate three pieces and licked the plate!

Super delicious and easy!  Definitely follow the directions and do not mix the flour/sugar mixture with the rhubarb.  If you follow the recipe's instruction, you should have the perfect amount of juice and the crust should not be soggy, but perfect.  I added 2 tsps of vanilla to the rhubarb, and it was amazing. I also use my grandmother's method of brushing milk on top of the top pie crust layer and then sprinkling the sugar.  This seems to crisp up the crust and gives the sugar something to adhere to. My 13 year old son devoured this.

We loved this!  I only had about 3 cups of rhubarb from my CSA, so I filled in the rest with sliced strawberries and it was fantastic!

Baking is not just about ingredients; technique is just as important.  There is a lot going on inside this simple pie while it's in the oven, and any changes made to the baking technique will change the outcome.  Sprinkle 1/3 cup of the sugar/flour mixture in the bottom crust, sprinkle the remainder on top of the fruit.  It really makes a difference. 
This is without a doubt the best pie I have ever baked.

Have used this recipe for two years now and never rated it. My husband loves  rhubarb pie and this one is tops in his books as it has a top and bottom crust instead of a streusel topping. I do use about an extra cup of rhubarb as my pie plate is very deep and add an extra TB of flour.. As stated, do NOT mix the sugar in with the rhubarb. By putting it on top some of it sticks to the top crust which gives it a nice sugary crunch. Another great recipe!

Made this recipe yesterday for my father-in-law's birthday (rhubarb is his favorite) and EVERYONE loved it. Followed the recipe exactly (even after reading most of the "helpful" reviews) and won't be making any changes in the future:-)

This firmed up beautifully in the fridge overnight and had a fantastic sweet-tart flavor. Mine was not quite as pink as what is in the picture, perhaps a bit more flour than necessary in my case? Thanks for sharing!

Ok so I made this pie twice already and I am pretty certain I have it memorized lol.
Anyhow FANTASTIC recipie. Most Rhubarb Pies go soggy within the 2nd day in the fridge, But not this one.
I followed the recipie to a tee and would NOT reccommend altering it. It is way too good.
Many Thanks for sharing this.

My husband loves rhubard pie.  I thought I would give the try to make this one.  I added strawberry, a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/2 of a lemon juice.  According to hubby this was the BEST rhubbard pie he ever had...

First I have to be honest and say I HATE Rhubarb! However its my husbands favorite pie. So seeing how I bought Rhubarb, I went looking for a different pie recipe than the usual one I use. This is the best Rhubarb pie!!!! I took a bite, expecting to "gag" on it like usual. Not this time, yummy. And the whole sugar on the bottom, the best idea yet. (going to try it with apple and see if you get the same results, crispy crust, the best). So I bring out the last piece to the table after dinner, to share. Room-mate says, "yeah, saw the pie hiding in the oven" not hiding, just were it stays so dog doesn't help himself. Try it? "What is it?" not going to tell you, try it. "As long as it not Rhubarb, hate Rhubarb, gagged on it as a kid, still have nightmares!" we laugh and say, okay don't try it then, more for us! takes a small bite, smiles and says, "anymore, yum" Two Rhubarb converts with one pie, ya gotta try this one!

This was delicious and super-easy. Thank you! The only thing I did different was use raw sugar. Would it be too naughty to have some for breakfast? Edit: The second time I used a cup of sugar instead of 1 1/3 and it was even better. I love me a tart pie. De-licious.

This was yummy but needs tweeking. Either too much sugar or sugar needs to be mixed with rhubarb, not sure. It crystallized into HUGE layers and had to be picked out to eat. Great flavor though! Will try this again.

This was my first time eating rhubarb and my first time trying to make this pay. I made this for the relatives that I visited in WA. They have rhubarb in their backyard...the only thing is that they can't eat sugar.
I recomend using 1 tablespoon of stevia. It works like a charm! the only thing is that instead of "sprinkling" the rest of the flour + stevia mix on top of the rhubarb chunks, you should mix it a little..so you don't have "unmelted" chunks of flour on top.

Excellent recipe! althou , I did put the flour and sugar mixture on the bottom and top instead of mixing it all together. I also aded 1 cup brown sugar instead of white, a tbsp vanilla extract a little cinnamon and 1 cup of apples. IT came out delicious! YOU DO NOT NEED THE BUTTER!its  less fat and still just as tasty! I also used the pillsbury pre-made dough, it was fantastic, flaky and crispy on top.

This was a great recipe. I used a little extra sugar mix on the top and bottom, as I like the texture it creates. Like others had suggested, I tried to mix some red food coloring in with the sugar but it didn't spread like I had hoped throughout the pie. Maybe next time, I mix the coloring in with the rhubarb itself (the juices may help it run better).

We have fresh rhubarb and hubby wanted a pie, so I made this one.  He loved it!  I had never made a rhubarb pie before, but had made rhubarb dumplings.  I will make this recipe again!

I made this pie for my family for the holiday weekend. The crust was soggy and when we cut into the pie the inside was doughy and soggy. I followed the directions exactly as written and will never make this again.

Made the pie for work and it was gobbled up!  I didn't use the butter but used an egg to "glaze" the top crust near the end of the cooking.  I also added strawberries.  People were amazed to see how much I had piled up into the pie and it all melted so nicely!

The first time I made this, the filling was soupy-good, but soupy.  I followed the recipe exactly, taking great care to sprinkle some of the flour mixture on the bottom crust. The 2nd time I made this, I did exactly the same, except I doubled the amount of flour it calls for--PERFECT!  I will definitely be making this one again & again!

I've never tasted or even touched rhubarb before. When I saw our grocery store carried it I was curious & found this recipe. I was very skeptical while working w/ the rhubarb but it turned out great! My husband & I really enjoyed the recipe as is.

I used 3 cups of rhubarb and it was plenty. I also made a point of following the directions to put a little of the sugar mixture directly on the crust & the rest sprinkled over the fruit before covering it with the top layer of crust. This was the first time my rhubarb pie didn't boil out of the pan. It was perfect. From now on, I'll freeze bags of rhubarb already cut up, so that I can fix myself a rhubarb pie any time of the year (you can only buy them in the spring & early summer months.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I didn't have fresh rhubarb, what I had was frozen and didn't nearly come to 4 cups (more like 2), but it still turned out excellent.  My first rhubarb pie and even the picky eater of the bunch loved it.

Very simple recipe for quite a tasty pie. I had no idea that rhubarb pie was so easy to make. I have made the pie 4 times over the past couple of weeks, 3 using white sugar, 1 using brown sugar. Both versions are excellent.

My mom's "Absolutely the Best Rhubarb Pie" was similar except she would mix an eggwith 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup flour. This was poured over the chopped rhubarb and mixed well before pouring into the bottom pie shell. Baking was the same.

Have made this pie twice now and instead of sprinkling the sugar and flour mixture over the rhubarb after it was in the pie shell, I mixed it all together in a large bowl along with the rhubarb and then put it all in the pie shell. I found that when I put the sugar mixture on the bottom, it turned hard while baking - worked better for me this way! Pie is DELICIOUS! Best I've ever made!

Perfect. This pie is SO how I remember my Grandmother's. Add a few quick shakes of ground cinnamon to the sugar and flour.  The cinnamon is barely noticed, yet it brings the wonderful taste of rhubarb front and center.  I have baked rhubarb pies for years and this is THE PERFECT recipe.

Actually 10 stars. I have made this several times and it turns out great every time. It tastes as good as it looks. The amount of rhubarb will vary with the size/depth of your pie dish. Sometimes I add more or add a couple sliced tart apples to bulk it up high. You can also use pinches of nutmeg or cinnamon inside and sugar on top of the brushed crust to suit your taste but any way you slice it, it is one great recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe for rhubarb lovers!  I used frozen rhubarb that was left over from last season.  That makes it a little more trickey because rhubarb gets watery and turns to mush after it's frozen.  It doesn't affect the flavor,  but you have to use a little more flour to compensate for the extra moisture.  It's best to thaw the rhubarb first, drain off all of the excess liquid, and then measure out the 4 cups.  As far as flour, it depends on the overall moisture content of the rhubarb.  You just have to guess and hope for the best.

Unbelievable pie.  I used about 6 cups of rhubarb and it was perfect, will certainly make this again.  I'm not much of a baker but this turned out better than I thought it would.  Used ready made pie crust and vented the top crust with 8 small cuts.  Also covered the edge with foil first 15 minutes so it would not burn.  Brushed milk on top crust and sprinkled with sugar before baking....it was just fabulous -- the easiest, prettiest and tastiest pie I have ever made or eaten!!  A definate make again during rhubarb season.

I love rhubarb pie but the recipe I use is for tapioca instead of flour. My husband loved rhubarb and cherry pie (two of his favorites) so I was surprised to see in the review that someone else used charries - too often I see rhubarb and strawberry.

I decided to make this because it was my grandfather's favorite.  There wasn't enough good rhubarb @ the grocery store so I mixed it with lite cherry pie filling.  It was great, I think it would have been just as good without the cherries

I made this with my own home grown rhubarb. It was a big hit.I made it just the way it was written. Loved it.  Had friends for dinner and they couldn't stop raving about it. They asked for the recipe. They couldn't beleive how simple it was to make. I will use the recipe all the time. Thanks Carol.

A big hit with my family. I followed the recipe exactly. No soggy crust, putting the flour/sugar mixture first then piling the rhubarb on top is brilliant, I will use this method for other fruit pies!

Every year I try & bake a fresh rhubarb pie for my neighbor & this year I received a bunch of rhubarb from a friend & decided to bake him & my neighbor each a pie & was told that it was the best ever!

Rave reviews! Everyone loved it, if I didn't snag a piece at the beginning I would not have been able to try it :) Didn't change a thing, and pleased my dad who is very particular about his rhubarb pie. A keeper! The only recipe I will use, thanks for sharing!

WOW...I have never eaten or made rhubarb pie. My husband asked me to make one and I found this recipe. I followed it to the T and it was perfect. I loved it. I would not change the recipe at all. Thanks for posting.

Wonderful.   I only had 2 cups of fresh rhubarb, so I made a half-pie using an insert that fits into a 10 inch pie tin.  I made a lattice top and it was beautiful and tasty.  My husband said it was so good that I should have made a whole pie, but now he can enjoy the memory!

I double this recipe and put it in a rectangle dish. It has never failed and my family loves it! We also omit the butter and make a whole wheat pie crust from scratch to make this dish.

I used only 2 c. Rhubarb and replaced the other 2 c. with fresh strawberries and used 1/3 c. less sugar. I also did an egg wash and sprinkled with sugar. This was FANTASTIC.

Great recipe for "real" rhubarb pie, if that's what you like. Without strawberries, rhubarb pie is tangy - so be prepared. My family loved it.

Absolutely perfect. I forgot the butter but can't imagine it could make it any better.  I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe from this site and the combination was fantastic.  Following others' tips I wrapped the edge in foil for the first 20 minutes and brushed the top with egg white beaten with water and sprinkled with a little white sugar at the beginning and again about half way through.  It was just as beautiful as it was delicious. Both recipes were easy, and my Dad said he'd been enjoying rhubarb pies for over 60 years and this was the best ever.  High praise from a man who married an avid and great baker.

I am a novice at making pies, but my dad found out I had rhubarb and asked me to make him a pie.  This is absolutely the easiest, best rhubarb pie around.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for this great recipe.

This is a great recipe and very easy.  I used the store-brand equivalent of Pillsbury ready-to-bake roll-out pie shells.  One change I made, just to make it a little bit sweeter, was to add a generous handful of white vanilla chips over the rhubarb.  These melted in, were unnoticeable, and added another subtle, sweet flavor to the pie.

This is a great pie that is so easy to make.  I thought, how can this be good with so few ingredients?  Why are there no spices?  It doesn't need it!  I made this pie after a crazy day, unexpected dinner guests and I wanted to have a nice dessert.  I made a latice top which looked great.  I'll freeze some rhubarb so I can make this many times after rhubarb is not in season.

I never have seen it done this way, but trust her, because it makes the most amazing rhubarb pie! It turns out absolutely perfectly. Not too brown on the top, and the crust is not soggy. (I am going to try her technique with other fruit pies). The only hint I would add is to put 2-3 tubular pastas in the top. It lets the juices boil up through them and not onto the pie. Thanks for giving this recipe!

I was amazed at how easy it was, and how well it came out. I was lazy and used frozen rhubarb (that I thawed) but it was just as good. My only complaint is now my husband wants this on a regular basis!

Inlaws own the largest rhubarb producing farm in the state.  So I know rhubarb. Made this last night exactly as written and my husband raved. He said not to change a thing!
I did vent the top crust and sprinkled sugar on it before cooking though.

My mother-in-law has a gluten allergy and this is the only time she will eat anything containing flour!  She says it is worth the inevitable reaction.  We have an orange tree in the backyard and Sometimes I will add some grated orange peel and a smal amount of the orange juice for a different twist!

Wonderful! I only had a little over 3 cups of fresh rhubarb, so I added around 1 1/2 cups of sliced strawberries, then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. My husband loves rhubarb pie and said it was the best he'd ever had. I can't wait to make this again!

This is a perfect rhubarb pie.  My friend gave me some of her first spring rhubarb, and I made a pie for my fiance who loves rhubarb pie.  I used the butter pie crust recipe from this site, and I tell you this pie could have won an award.  I think it was the best pie I ever made.

Very Good, but then it is almost identical to my grandmother's recipe. Sometimes I add just a bit of cinnamon (about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon) for a more spicy flavor.  Adding up to 1 more tablespoon of flour insures that the pie is always thick enough.   My husband thinks thinks this pie is excellent!

My pies have always been sought after; but this one rates the best of the best. Awesome pie. I have been a caterer and owner of a luncheon and Tea Room; I know that my old customers would ask for this as a repeat. We grow our own rhubarb; so freshly cut and the French Pastry crust as suggested, it is divine.  This is day two with the pie ( yes there is some left over) and the crust is still not soggy.  It is getting a little soft, but not soggy. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best rhubarb pie ever! Thanks for the tip of sprinkling  1/4 (about 1/2 cup) of the flour and sugar in bottom of pie crust. That made a delicious caramelized layer on the bottom and left the bottom crust very crisp. I'm going to try that on all my fruit pies from now on. With a 10" pie plate I used 5 cups of rhubarb and adjusted recipe to match but used only 1 1/3 cup sugar with 7 1/2 T. flour and it was sweet enough for me. With the high starting temp I used metal pie crust protectors around the pie rim so the outer crust didn't burn. Thanks Carol

This was wonderful!  The pie tightened up nicely without running all over the plate. I don't like the flavor of tapioca in a fruit pie, so I was thrilled when the flour did the trick. And it tasted great!

i have tried both putting the sugar flour mixture on the top and bottom and then just putting it on the bottom and mixing the rest with the fruit and i have to say the best results i get are putting the sugar flour mix on the bottom then mixing the rest with the fruit. if you just pour the flour sugar mixture on top sometimes it will just crystalize and you will have a big sugar layer between your crust and your filling which is not appealing or tasty at all. i have added strawberries to this recipe and the pie comes out great. i also added strawberries and raspberries and that pie was delicious also. this recipe is defiantly a keeper because it turns out a delicious pie every time.

Wow...I mean, really wow...
I've had rhubarb pie only once and before that, I didn't even know what rhubarb was or what it tasted like. When I looked at it the first time, I didn't even want to try it because I wasn't really turned on by the color of it. My hubby kept saying I should try cause it's so good.  I reluctantly tried it and I liked it a lot to my surprise. Last week, when I saw rhubarb in the store, I came home and checked for the recipe to see if I could make it. I found this recipe and after watching the video, I gained some confidence. I couldn't believe how easy it was. The video helped a lot, too but it really was just so easy. I followed the recipe to the T. I thought about omitting butter just like a reviewer said but decided to leave it in there to see how the original recipe would come out. Also I was afraid that it would be runny like some reviews said but it really wasn't runny at all. I guess it might have been or might be runny if you eat it not long after you bake it but I had to wait at least 4-5 hours till I was able to have a piece and it was truly so good and perfect. My hubby liked it of course. I still can't believe how easy it is and how good it is. Well, I don't know what color ripe rhubarb is supposed to be. Mine was red outside but green inside. The pie was kinda brown when done. It was just so good. I'll be making this again this weekend.

I really loved this recipe because it was easy and delicious. It was a hit in our home! I used frozen rhubarb and defrosted it, which turned out great. The only alteration I would make is using less sugar (next time I will probably use 1 cup instead of 1 1/3) as I also like to pair my pies with vanilla bean ice cream and that's just too much sweet. My boyfriend on the other hand thought it was perfect :)

I made the pie yesterday morning, and my husband and I enjoyed it at dinner.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated using Pillsbury pie crust.  I put the sugar/flour on the bottom and resisted the urge to mix the remaining mixture as I normally would do.  As another reviewer mention, the lattice crust was sweet and crispy.  My pie was not watery.  The pie was not too sweet at all.  I THAWED two bags of garden grown rhubarb over night.  When I drained the bags in the morning, I had well over 1 1/2 of liquid.  My pie was still moist but anything but runny which is what usually happens when I use fresh rhubarb.  Try this recipe - you will not be disappointed.

This is the best rhubarb pie recipe I've found. I make a 10" pie, so I use 7 cups of rhubarb, 1 2/3 c sugar, 8 Tbsp flour, and 1 Tbsp butter. Make it just as the recipe calls and you will not be disappointed. Pair it with a scoop of vanilla bean iced cream and one serving may not be enough!

make sure you mound the rhubarb, and mound the sugar mixture on top without mixing or jiggling it to distribute. Also, put a pan under it to catch the drips so you dont have to clean the oven.

Just like my grandmother's pie! The only changes I made were to decrease the sugar to 1 cup and add a bit of nutmeg. My grandmother always dotted the top of her fruit pies with butter (under the top crust as the recipe states) and it really brings out the flavor. I agree with the other reviewers-do not mix the fruit in the sugar mixture. Doing it as the recipe states gives you a perfect (not soggy) bottom crust. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I remember my mom telling me I didn't like rhubarb when I had it as a kid, so when my husband asked for a rhubarb pie I wan't too excited. But I figured what the heck. I found this recipe and, with the ratings, determined it had to be considered the best of the best. Let me tell you, it is (not that I have much to compare it to)! A perfect balance of sweet and tart...it reminded me of a cherry pie. I have to call my mom and tell her I love rhubarb!!

Picked rhubarb this morning and had a piece of VERY good pie tonight.  Have even emailed this recipe to my daughter so she can make it.  Thank you so much Carol, I didn't change a thing, oh, might have added a little more butter than your recipe called for.  This pie is so good and EASY. Will be making it again as soon as the rhubarb is ready to pick.

This was my first successful pie. After botching many pumpkin pies and giving up on baking, this pie brought me out of it! The only reason I made it was to surprise my husband, who loves rhubarb pie. He raves over and over about it! So grateful for this fantastic recipe!!!

Almost like my Great-grandma's, only she added 1 TBS nutmeg. I Didn't have nutmeg but used cinnamon instead and came out better! 
Also to answer the extra moisture problem to the rhubarb: Take 1 cup of the sugar and toss over the cut pieces, set in colander to drain for about an hour (like you do to eggplant). You'd be amazed how much comes out. Use the rest of sugar as directed.

Absolutely fabulous!  Not bitter at all!  I had about 5 1/2 c. of rhubarb so I up the sugar to 1 2/3 c.  All else remained the same!

Tried this pie tonight, oh my, it is delicious.  Not too sweet, not too tart, perfect.  The only problem will be not eating it all before my two adult children get home, haha.  Cannot believe the simplicity of this recipe, it took no time at all to assemble, just perfect!

Wonderful pie recipe! My kids loved it. The bottom was not soggy, though we found the filling to be a bit tart. Otherwise very good:)

delicious and so easy to make. definitely brush the top with egg white and sprinkle sugar while baking. If using frozen rhubarb, make sure to thaw well and squeeze out all the excess water before uisng!

I did the recipe exactly as it says, except for the butter, and it turned out great! It has a nice tartness to it, which I feel most people stay away from. Also, it's very easy to make. Kudos!

Super simple, perfect sweet to tart ratio. I made my standard double crust from the joy of cooking, coz it's tha best. Also 4 cups cut up is about 1lb bag of frozen Rhubarb :)

Disappointed - found it much too sweet for my taste. I have another recipe that calls for a dash of salt and only 1 and a quarter cups of sugar. I think that works better for me. Happy I tried it though!

I researched a lot of rhubarb pie recipes and found this one.  I tried it with frozen rhubarb and since I didn't have quite as much rhubarb as what was needed and added some frozen strawberries as well.  I followed the recipe as given and it was WONDERFUL! Will definitely make again!!

This recipe was so simple, but turned out wonderfully for me.  I followed the instructions exactly.  My rhubarb was green and not so tart as red, so I could have reduced the sugar just a bit.  I made my own crusts, and used lard rather than shortening.  They turned out to be the best crusts I've ever made.  Great recipe!

What a yummy pie! I made a few changes: To the rhubarb I added 1 1/2 cups chopped up strawberries, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1 TBLS tapioca, and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  It came out nice and firm and not too tart or too sweet. . .just perfect with some vanilla ice cream! I will for sure make this again.

I thought my mom's recipe was impossible to beat but this is the best rhubarb pie I ever ate!  The sugar mixture at the bottom is the real key for a crisp firm bottom crust.  Delicious!!

I always love pie, but I think this is my favourite of all time. My family never cooked with rhubarb so neither grandmother was able to pass one on to me. I wanted to try this after finding rhubarb at our farmers' market and needing something to do with it.
I do a latice top with a Martha Stewart crust recipe. It turns out perfectly every time.

This is always a big hit when I make it! I use frozen rhubarb - thawed and excess water drained, to make it year round. Also, I squeeze half a lemon on top of the fruit before the top layer of flour-sugar mixture and I really like the result.

I made this last night! My husband hates rhubarb, and he couldn't get enough of this! The only changes I made were, mixing one egg with the fruit and adding a cup more rhubarb and a cup of sliced strawberries. And I used the amazing french pie crust on this site with a lattice top and cream brushed on top and sprinkled with sugar! Just amazing!

I didn't change a thing--it was perfect! I used a store-bought crust package and it was perfectly baked. I think using the bottom rack and lowering the temp after fifteen minutes was just the ticket. I did not cover the edges with foil like the boxed directions said--just followed your recipe!  So easy! My new favorite pie! Thanks so much!

It was tasty.  A great pie for the summer. It was well balanced between the tarty flavor of the rhubarb and the sweetness of the sugar.  The filling held up after I cut the pie. Excellent.

I made this pie for a 4th of July BBQ and it tasted amazing! Everyone really liked it, and it being the first pie I've ever made I found it surprisingly easy to make. The reason I give it only 4 stars is because the sugar kind of "caked" on top of the filling (you could see in through the slits I had cut in the top crust). Any thoughts why this happened? Regardless, it tasted phenomenal.

This is such a wonderful pie! Followed the recipe exactly as written except I forgot the butter but it sure doesn't need it. It was not "soupy" on the bottom at all. Will definately use this recipe from now on!

Crazy good! Perfect balance of tart/sweet. Putting some of the sugar/flour mixture on top of the bottom crust as directed really makes a difference.  Next time I will add a couple more tablespoons of flour to the flour/sugar mixture to thicken up the pie filling. I used Ina Garten's pie crust recipe.

Love this recipe! We have made it 3 different ways: rhubarb only, 3 c rhubarb & 1 c strawberries, 2 c rhubarb & 2 c blueberries (the best combination yet!). They have all been very yummy and Daddy can't have enough!

YUM!  This recipe is perfection!  I've never made a rhubarb pie before, and apparently didn't buy quite enough to have 4 cups of rhubarb.  So, I ended up adding about a cup of blueberries.  I also cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup.  I was worried it would be too watery with the blueberries, but it managed to come out perfectly anyways!

This is really a great pie! My husband even rated it better than his grandmother's (and that's saying alot!) For those complaining about the crust being soggy, try any of these tips: Keep all the dough ingredients cold before preparation, refrigerate until ready to fill and bake; try brushing the bottom of crust with well beaten egg white before filling; and do NOT mix the sugar and flour with the rhubarb- you need the crispy barrier it creates between the crust and fruit! Also, for a lovely coating, you can brush an egg wash on top- 1 T. of cream, half and half, or milk with 1 large egg yolk.  Very tasty!

Have made this at several family functions/picnics. It is always a hit and I can never leave without giving the recipe to someone. I only have two tweaks: I use 7 tablespoons of flour to lessen the sogginess of the rhubarb and I add a dash of cinnamon to the top coat of flour/sugar. Either way, awesome recipe!

I`ve been following this recipe step by step and every time it turns out great. I don`t measure the rhubarb, just use it as much as I have, to cover the pie crust. It`s super delicious! I sift some powdered sugar on top of each slice before serving.

Really good recipe, I made some changes... I cut the sugar and flour in half. I didn't use the butter. I used store bought pie crust and brushed the top with egg. I still put the sugar and flour mix on the bottom to help keep the crusts from getting soggy.  The next time I make a rhubarb pie, I think I will cut the sugar and flour mixture down even more.  I like a more natural pie...

I think this is a pretty good recipe, but I prefer the addition of strawberries to the pie to balance the tartness.

This pie is so easy to make!  The only thing I did differently was add about 3 Tbl of (glaze for strawberries)to the rubarb. It's red so adds great color to the pie, and has an extra little sweetness. Everyone loved it way to much to make this any other way!

I used the basic recipe but used a few review suggestions.  Upped fruit to 6 cups/used 8 Tbs flour/brushed and sugared top crust & foiled the edge for 15 min. of baking time.  Yummy!!!!

I followed the directions exactly. The pie was simple to make and the flavour extremely good, but it turned out VERY watery... not sure if it was something I did, or maybe the type of rhubarb I used. I'll be trying it again though, maybe adding more flour next time :D *EDIT: The filling thickened up quite a bit after refrigerating overnight.

Oh my Lord is this pie fantastic! I made this as the directions stated and it came out beautifully--the other reviewers were right: don't mix the sugar/flour with the rhubarb. It wasn't grossly chewy, it wasn't too sweet or too tart. Just perfect. I used a crust recipe that used both butter and shortening; on a hot summer day the crust wasn't easy to put together, but that's no fault of this recipe's. Thanks for posting!

Delicious!! I did not add all the ingredients together. Instead, I used 1/4 of the sugar/flour on the bottom, then placed the diced rhubarb, and finally the remaining sugar/flour mixture. It brought tears to my dad's eyes. Thanks soooo much!

This was my first attempt at a rhubarb pie and it  was NOT a disappointment.  It was wonderful.  My husband was all but licking the plate.  My only change was to brush the crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar.  Also added a little cinnamon to the flour/sugar mixture.

Fantastic results! Added the cinnamon and a little vanilla as suggested in other reviews. The most perfect balance of flavours and textures...almost forgot brushed the top of the pie with milk and sprinkled with sugar for a crisp top - as suggested on other reviews.  Can't believe the wonderful result.

Delicious. I always have problems with recipes that have chopped ingredients by volume instead of weight, because it will really depend on how it packs into the measuring cup. I think I used more than 4 cups, which makes it less sweet, and I wanted that. I hadnt had rhubarb pie since i was a small child. Thanks!

As people before me have mentioned, this pie was outstanding, and perhaps the easiest pie I've ever made. My husband and neighbors loved it so much that I made three of these pies in two days.  With the first two pies, I followed the directions exactly, and the pies came out perfect--the baking time was spot on.  The third time I baked this pie, I added some frozen raspberries I had on hand, and sprinkled the top crust with sugar.  It was another winner.  All in all--a fast, easy and delicious way to use your fresh rhubarb.  Enjoy!

Very versatile recipe. I didn't have enough rhubarb ready yet, so I substituted half the fruit with strawberries and about a cup of frozen blueberries, and cut the sugar to 1 cup.  My family said it was probably the best pie they have ever eaten.

I made this last night and it turned out perfectly!!! I made just as directed except I made a 10inch pie and used 6 cups of rhubarb. I used the french pastry pie crust that is found on here and it was perfect (it is basically the same recipe on any can of shortening with the addition of sugar).

If you like rhubarb pie - this is a great pie. Infact, this is beyond great.   It is perfectly tart like rhubarb pie should be and its not soupy or mushy.   If you wish to reduce the tart.. add the strawberrys as other reviewers have suggested.  And Carol.... I could kiss you for this recipe! Its in my recipe book for the next generation to enjoy!

AWESOME PIE!!! This pie was soooo easy to make and it turned out great! I wouldn't change a thing about it.  I did NOT want to make it at first, b/c I didn't think it would be good. (I have never had a rhubarb pie before) My boyfriend wanted one for Valentine's Day so I made this recipe.  I was amazed! I will definitely make again!

I'd never made (or eaten) a rhubarb pie until now and I am oh so stoked I chose this recipe.  My boyfriend, who is a huge rhubarb pie fan, thought it was delicious...pie was history the next day.  Thank you so much for this recipe! This is definitely a keeper.   *I did use frozen rhubarb and I also forgot to add the butter but the pie was absolutely scrumptious without the buttah*

You made me a hit! My husband has not had this pie since his grandma made it in '76. My mother has not had it since her mother pasted away. What wonderful memories were brought back of such special people because of a pie. Thanks from the bottom of my heart!

Phe-nom-e-nal!!!! Best fruit pie EVER!!! I had really red rhubarb, so the color was vivid. It really wasn't too sweet, but I will slightly lessen the sugar for more tang next time. Maybe the rhubarb just wasn't so tangy.

The only change I made to the recipe was omitting the butter.  The pie was not runny and the crust was not soggy.  The absolute best pie I have ever made!

This was probably the easiest pie I have ever made. It was great and I do not even like Rhubarb. I made it for my Dad who does not like sweet things at all. He suggested I put less sugar next time but the rest of us loved it!

This turned out excellent. As good or better than mom used to make. I think actually better than mom's. I followed the recipe exactly and really see no reason to change it.  Rhubarb pie and a cold glass of milk. It doesn't get much better than that.  Thanks for this recipe Carol!

I followed the directions exactly and the pie turned out great and not soupy! I would probably add more rhubarb next time since I like a little more filling :) Crust was great and not soggy on the bottom. A great rhubarb pie recipe!

This pie has basic ingredients but award winning flavor. I did ,however, brush the top crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar. My boyfriend and I enjoyed this pie very much. I look forward to making this super simple dessert again and again.

Quick and easy! You gave us a winner here Carol. On the second success using this recipe I raised my rating to 5 stars from 4. This baby is a 5 star taste treat.  My wife & the Dominican Sisters down the street loved the unique taste of this pie.  I think I'll spend a little more time reading the other reviews they're great for picking up some pointers.  Maybe someone has a suggestion on how to thickness of the sauce that the rhubarb produces.

I don't know - it just didn't turn out as I expected. I've made many rhubarb pies over the years, but this one was not my favorite. It was very runny and the flour ended up making the rhubarb kind of gooey - like uncooked bread dough. I'll be going back to my regular recipe.

Wonderful pie and it could not be easier to make.  I just bought a house and inherited 3 large rhubarb plants.  This was my first attempt at cooking with rhubarb and it turned out superb.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  will definitely make again and again!

Will definitely make this again.  The crust didn't get soggy at all because the first layer of cornstarch and sugar formed a sort of 'barrier'. I made a gluten-free crust and and my mother in law said it was the best pie she'd ever had.

Absolutely excellent pie!  Make certain to follow the recipe by placing the sugar over the rhubarb -- do not mix the sugar with the rhubarb. This pie received rave reviews.  I will definitely make this again.

OMG!  This is the best rhubarb pie I have ever eaten and the easiest to prepare.  I love the crispy bottom crust.
This is a definite keeper!

I made this pie for my mother and mother-in-law.  They both said it was the best Rhubarb Pie they have ever had.  They are in their 70's so that was quite a compliment.

I made this pie for my dad for Father's Day and it was a HUGE hit!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I sprinkled some clear vanilla extract over the pie before I put on the top crust.  Perfect consistency & flavor.  THANKS for sharing such a fantastic recipe!

I liked this, and I'm not even a fan of rhubarb pies. Even though I wanted to mix the rhubarb with the flour+sugar, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very well. No alterations needed. It also cut beautifully after sitting for only 10 minutes.

My husband loved it, I didn't use butter in the pie, and only used 1 cup of sugar. I used grandma's secret pie crust from allrecipes. I did make 4 little hole on the top crust before baking, because I was afraid it would be soggy if I didn't. Thanks!

I've never made a pie before, and never even tasted or seen a rhubarb pie so I didn't know what to expect. I made it for my mom for mother's day because I always heard it was her favorite. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! She loved it and it was the hit of the day because it made her cry!

I had made this pie quite a while ago (6 months) and when I see people again, they say " I can still taste that terrific pie, it was so amazing!".  I don't remember ever having so many compliments or to this degree before, and I cook and entertain quite a bit.  Everyone loved this pie.  What a wonderful recipe!  My only advise, is don't change a thing, and use homemade crust!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I just harvested the last of my rhubarb for the season and wanted a quick and easy rhubarb pie recipe. I decided to try this one and was glad I did! It was quick and easy and delicious - everyone loved the pie. I made one exactly the way the recipe said and one with a handfull of orange-flavored dried cranberries - both were wonderful!

Perfect pie and couldn't be easier to make!  I used a frozen pie crust and it came out beautifully.  This is the first rhubarb pie recipe I have tried that was worthy of the rhurbarb.  Pie was a bit soupy served warm, but the flavor was excellent.  Refrigerated and served cold the next day - just right.

This is a wonderful, fool proof recipe. I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the sugar/flour mixture and it was perfect. Don't under cook or the pie will be runny.

I halved this recipe to make mini pies (cutting out crusts using a drinking glass & topping lattice-style), and they are SUPERB!  Didn't change a thing.

This was one of the most fantastic pies I have ever made.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  There were a few changes that I had to make.  First, it's october so I had to use frozen rhubarb. I did thaw it first. Next, I used a lattice top on the pie instead of a solid sheet of dough.  I served it with a fresh amaretto whipped cream.  Thanks again, I will definitly use this again.

FABULOUS! This was the EASIEST pie recipe I have ever made I thought there was no way it could be that good because of how simple it was but Rhubarb pie is my Dad's favoirite but he is never happy with how ANYONE makes it ABSOLUTELY LOVED it and keeps asking me to make more. The EASIEST MOST DELICIOUS Rhubarb Pie you could ever make! My search for the PERFECT Rhubarb pie recipe has ended here :) THANKS!

Awesome pie!  My FIL says it is like the one his mom used to make!  I took two pieces to my FIL, visited for a few hours, and when I came back, my husband had the rest of the pie eaten and left me just a taste.  I'll make two next time!

A great rhubarb filling- not at all slimy, overly tart, or soupy. Right mix of ingredients. Don't be timid about putting the flour/sugar mixture on the top and bottom, it works wonderfully. Also, don't be afraid to use frozen rhubrarb- I did and it came out just right. I think I still need to find that "perfect" pie crust recipe, but at least I now have my rhubarb filling recipe. So easy!

This was the first rhubarb pie that I made myself and the recipe is terrific!  I used the 2 cups of sugar and added some strawberries.  I forgot the butter (my 7 mos old daughter was making life difficult at that point!); however, the pie was still delicious!

I did make a tiny addition, I added a little more butter.  But overall we loved the recipe, in fact so much I made it again two days later for our "family night " dinner! We served the pie warm, with french vanilla ice cream over the top!  Thanks again for your mother's Rhubarb Pie recipe!

I must have made a thousand rhubarb pies in my lifetime along with every other kind.  Hands down, this is the best rhubarb pie I have ever made.  The high temp and low position in the oven made a crisp bottom crust,  a slightly caramelized filling, and a light golden crust.  My husband had a fit when I sent leftovers home with our guests and only held back two pieces for him.  It was really amazing.

Made it and loved it. I didn't change any of the ingredients this time but in the future I will cut the sugar back by a third. I like the tang of the rhubarb and all the sugar over powered it.

Who knew that perfection was spelled with an "R"? I grew up in Minnesota and we always had access to fresh rhubarb from the grandparent's farms. You don't find a lot of fresh rhubarb in Texas, but when you do, this is exactly what you should do with it. Brings back some great childhood memories! Thanks Mom for giving me the passion to cook, bake and create!  OH, you really don't need the butter! #cookingwithwingman

Loved it.  I thought a tad sweet but everyone else raved about it.  I would make it again without changing anything. It was little runny but still warm.  I'll add more flour next time.

Instead of making one big pie, I split this recipie in 4, and made 4 - 5" pies instead. For a little extra flavour, I added 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour sugar mixture per pie. 
Only thing I did wrong was screw up on the times and temps. Forgot to drop temp down after 15 minutes, and ended up over cooking them after 40 minutes. Otherwise they turned out pretty good. Boys all ate them. So that's always a good sign. 
I'll remember to make that adjustment and adjust the time down to 20-25 minutes at lower temp for the 5" pies.

Appreciate the info on where to place the pie in the oven.  This is omitted frequently about oven placement.  I loved this recipe.  I did add lemon zest and lemon juice.  Also I can make it a lot faster than described because I keep cut rhubarb is the freezer, and I always have on hand frozen pie (double crusts) from my Amish bakery in Ohio Amish Country.  Once cooled,  since I'm a very small household, I cut up slices, and put in freezer.  Once frozen I put in bag in freezer.  I just love pie for breakfast.

Like others I used half the amount of sugar and more rhubarb, around 5 cups. Great flavor and no soggy crust. I will give this method a try with fresh blueberries.

This pie WAS delicious. I had never used the technique of layering the sugar and the fruit before and it did yield a delightfully crispy/crunchy crust.  That said, however, I felt that there were spots where the sugar "glaze" under the top crust was unevenly distributed.  Perhaps I need to be even more careful when layering the sugar/flour over the rhubarb.  For that reason, were I to make this again, I would decrease the sugar by a significant amount...maybe even down to 1 cup.  I really like the sweet/tang complement in a rhubarb pie and felt this was a little too sweet for my taste.

I have made this recipe several times with adaptions:
Latest adaption:   Use coconut oil instead of butter.  For berry pie, and 1/2 cup of flour for crumble topping.
Add 1/4 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the sugar/flour mixture.  I don't like double crust so for the top I made a crumble.  This is how - after putting 1/4 of dry ingredients in bottom of pie crust, add 1/3 cup of flour to the remaining dry mixture.  Place on top of fruit in pie plate and dot with butter.  1/4 cup or less.  No need to crumb it in!!  Love skipping that part:)  
When I don't have ample rhubarb I use partially thawed frozen raspberries.  Just put em on top of the rhubarb and add the crumble topping.  Bake as suggested.  Deeeeelish!!

Depending on the size of the pie I usually only add 1 cup sugar. I add 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 beaten egg and less flour. It should thicken up the rhubarb filling with only a couple tablespoons of flour.  Just need to to make sure you drain the rhubarb really good after boiling.

WOW! It's the first time I've made rhubarb pie and the first time I've had it since my Gransmother died.
I've been looking for a simple Rhubarb Pie recipe that was rhubarb only and this is fabulous. Different but as good as Grandmother's.
I increased the rhubarb to 6 cups (next time I'll use 8 cups). left the sugar the same and increased the flour by half. I left in the butter since my Grandmother made it that way.
Very happy to have found this recipe.

Great Recipe!  I followed the recipe, except added one additional cup of rhubarb and one cup of strawberries (total of six cups of fruit), without adding any additional sugar, to create a high top pie.  I highly recommend the "French Pastry Pie Crust" on this website for this and all pies.  The Rhubarb Pie was perfect and loved by my husband and neighbors.

Hands down THE best Rhubarb Pie recipe ever.  My husband lives for rhubarb season & pie. He is a purist...no strawberries or anything else allowed that might take away from the rhubarb!

In the past I've tried to adjust various recipes to tone down the sweetness of them, trying to find the perfect balance between the tart & the sweet but it was never quite right...until now.  This recipe is perfect as written.  The juices don't run all over either, thanks to the barrier of sugar & flour on the bottom of the crust.  

I've never been a big fan of rhubarb, but we were both floored when we tasted this one!  Thanks for this keeper!!

I used No Fail Pie Crust I from the site...also perfect :)  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/no-fail-pie-crust-i/detail.aspx

I followed the recipe for the most part. I use 3 cups of rubarb and one cup strawberries. Also, because I use strawberries I only use one cup of sugar. Yes, use the butter!!! Then egg wash the top.

I made the mistake of using frozen rhubarb, the inside was way to running, making the crust mushie.. I'll try again using fresh.  Flavor was good..
Made this again using fresh rhurbarb, and fresh strawberries, turned out wonderful, baked about 10 minutes longer, once cooled the juices thickened nicely.

Awesome pie and so easy to make. I usually omit the butter as it's not really necessary and doesn't change the flavor. For an especially good crust beat one egg white and brush it over the cruise then sprinkle with sugar. I also put foil around the edges for the first 15 minutes to prevent the edges from burning them remove the foil for the rest of the time.

I grew up on a farm in Nebraska and we had as much rhubarb as you'd care to pick.  My mom's recipe, which I don't have, is the only thing that comes close to this one. I've made it twice in the last 3 days and both times "it was to die for".

I forgot to add the butter, but it was excellent without it!  You might as well not add the extra fat and just leave it out.  This was my first time making a rhubarb pie, and I thought for sure it was going to taste too tart, but it turned out perfectly sweet.  Putting the pie on the lowest rack helped the pie crust not to burn.  I didn't have to line the crust with foil at all.  This was an amazing pie, and I will definitely make it again.  And that says a lot coming from someone who doesn't like the taste of rhubarb!

This pie was so easy to make and was wonderful.  I've never had rhubarb pie before and I can't wait to make this again.  Followed recipe exactly and used frozen rhubarb.  Was awesome.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My 87 year old (farmer) landlord said that this was one of the best rhubarb pies he has ever tasted. Now this includes his wife's AND his mother's! He confessed that didn't share the pie with anyone! lol So, I'm making 2 pies this week. One for him and one for his buddies and son. My advise? If you're looking for the best, don't change a thing!! Thank you for this recipe!!

I'm not a big pie eater but this was great! The only thing I altered was using 1/2 sugar and 1/2 stevia and topped with Cool Whip.

It's so simple and good. I use a mixture of brown sugar and white sugar instead of al white - the hint of molasses makes it special. Great pie! My husband goes crazy over it...

This tasted great. I used mostly green rhubarb because could not find the red, but it worked. I may decrease the sugar a bit next time because my hubby likes his pie a little less sweet, but I thought it turned out perfect!

We loved it. Took suggestions from others: skip the butter and use 3 T tapioca instead of the flour. I was afraid I didn't have enough rhubarb from our yard, but I used all I had which was a bit short of the 4 Cups recommended and it still turned out great. Great with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe is so simple and turned out great!  I've finally learned how to keep my crust from going soggy from the pie juices.  Most recipes will tell you to mix the fruit, flour, and sugar together - this is what creates a soggy crust.  The suggestion in this recipe is spot on!  I followed the mixing instructions to the T - and my pie was perfection!  I just made a few ingredient changes based on what I had on hand:  used tapioca flour instead of regular flour, sprinkled 1 tsp vanilla on the fruit, added 1 tsp cinnamon to the fruit.  So so good!

The only thing I changed is to use only 1 cup of sugar, I like mine just a little tart, and I whip up an egg and add it to the rhubarb to help it set a little. I also used tapioca in place of half of the flour.

This pie turned out incredible. I made my own crust using the recipe on this sure labeled "mom's double pie crust" and it was all such a breeze. This was my first time ever making a pie and I was surprised at how easy and delicious if turned out to be. Will definitely make this again. Don't change anything-I made the recipe exactly as written and other than the crust burning slightly at the edges during the initial 15 minute bake-it was perfect. I think my oven may rub a bit high-I'm blaming the burnt edges on that.

Fantastic!!!! I made this pie for my dad and he now hits me up for one all the time.  Make it exactly as recipe states. I didn't change anything.  The flour holds this pie together perfect. Nothing comes running out when cut :)

This was pretty good! I've only ever had strawberry rhubarb pie but the strawberries at the store were awful!! So...was looking for something w/just the rhubarb. Saw the reviews and gave it a try. My 12 year old loved it! Thought it tasted a little like apple pie. Would make again.

I've always been fearful of making a rhubarb pie, because I just knew I couldn't do it like my Momma!  I made this for a party and everyone loved it, but it was not *exactly* like my mother's.  (It tasted more like a cherry pie to me.)  So the next time I made it, I used SIX cups of thinly sliced rhubarb.  This time it was perfect ... just the right amount of tartness and sweet.  Thank you for this recipe, it has really taken me back in time.  :)

I followed the directions with few exceptions and got a WONDERFUL pie! Tasted fantastic and VERY easy! All I did differently was add vents to my top crust, gave it an egg white wash with a little sugar, and covered the edges in aluminum foil until the last ~10-15 minutes of baking. Excellent recipe!

Couldn't find my own recipe for rhubarb pie so I tried this one.  Yes, this was the best rhubarb pie I have ever made - and I have made quite a few.  I made it just as written - didn't change a thing.  So easy and family loved it.

Oh My Gosh-  this pie is SINFUL!  Im ashamed to admit that I couldnt resist "just a taste"... that "taste" evolved into almost the whole pie.  Best rhubarb pie I've had in ages!  Simple to make and easily (obviously) enjoyed!

This was good and super simple. I've never had rhubarb pie before, and I've only tried rhubarb two times in my life, so this was a pleasant surprise. I followed the recipe exactly and used "Cappy's Pie Crust" for the crust (Google it!). I did brush the top crust with milk and sprinkle it with a tiny bit of sugar before I stuck the pie in the oven, because that's my personal preference with any fruit pie. It turned out beautifully. Thanks for the recipe!

It turned out to be the best pie I have ever made in my life! I put about 1/3 of the sugar on the bottom crust.  Perfect crunchy crust.  The baking instructions are perfect too.  I added 2 tsp cinnamon, cuz I love it.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out great!  This was my first attempt at making rhubarb ANYTHING. I wasn't sure how small to chop the rhubarb, so I diced it, but I will try it with larger pieces next time.

This is the best pie that I've ever tasted. I made it just as the recipe is given but used purchased refrigerated pie crust. Most pies and desserts here in the south are simply too sweet but this pie is perfect...just sweet enough and allows the flavor of the rhubarb to shine. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I disagree with Sweet Tooth.  I made this with home grown rhubarb I'd frozen (8 cups fresh equals 4 cups frozen).  I put the sugar on the bottom and the sugar/flour on the top, then place my latice over the top.  The sugar/flour just sat there, making a sugar crust under the latice.  This could be because frozen rhubarb does not break down as juicily as fresh.  I should have mixed it up.

I absolutely love this recipe! My husband and I have tons of rhubarb from the community garden so we end up baking this pie about once a week and share with our neighbors. I cut the sugar to make it slightly better for you, and also because I prefer the tartness of the rhubarb.

This was my first time ever eating or making rhubarb pie and I was pleasantly surprised. I will be making this again, however with inreased spices for a bit of extra flavor.

I am very happy with this pie. I made my brother a pie using this recipe, pie crust IV recipe from this site, & a crumble topping from Martha Stewart. He states "BEST PIE EVER"... which makes it all worth it! I used 16oz frozen rhubarb. I didn't taste it myself and that's the only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars.

Very good flavor.  My husband is the pie baker in the family, so he actually baked the pie. Don't do what we did though.  We purchased the rhubarb in advance, and froze it.  Was a little mushy.  Will be making it again, only not freezing the rhubarb the next time!

Simple but delicious. You literally have to slice the rhubarb, pour it and the sugar in, and dab butter on top! The result is just the most simple, sticky pie I have ever made.

My husband grew up with a mom who made amazing rhubarb pie - after 37 years, this recipe is the one that lives up to her pie!  SUPER simple, and DO follow the directions of putting 1/4 of sugar mixture on the bottom, and 3/4 on top - it works and is amazing!!! Thank you, this recipe will be a fixture in our family for generations now probably!

I was a little afraid the pie wouldn't be sweet enough for me since I find rhubarb extremely sour but it turned out fine.  I actually made four little pies instead of one big one because one pie lasts too long for my husband and I.  I used the recipe exactly as written and just divided everything 4 ways.  Worked like a charm.  Thank you, Carol.

I had never made rhubarb pie before and was excited when I found this simple recipe. My excitement faded when I took the pies out of the oven. They were more like rhubarb soup! I don't know what happened since I followed the recipe as written. Maybe the rhubarb was too fresh? I just know I probably won't try this recipe again!

We made the pie exactly as the recipe specified.  The pie was perfect; the bottom crust had the same consistency as the top crust.  No soggy crust as is typical with a fruit pie.  No runny syrup but not a gel either.  We loved it and will definitely make another one....this week.

So simple and so good! I think I will put a portion of the sugar and flour mixture directly on the pie crust for all of my fruit-filled pies from now on as it prevents the crust from getting soggy. Thanks for the great tip!!!!

Oh my word...Wonderful!!! I quit making rhubarb pie a couple of years ago, even though it's my favorite. It was always runny & even though the flavor was delicious, it drove me crazy that it didn't turn out the way it was supposed to. I'm so glad that I found this recipe...thank you so much for sharing!!

This pie was so great!  I had never eaten rhubarb before, and was so glad I made this - it was one of the best pies I have made and eaten.  We ate almost all of it this evening, so I am making another one in the morning for my sister to take home with her!  The rhubarb was $4.98 a lb at our local grocery - pricey but worth it!

This was fantastic! Followed the recipe to a T.  Even did the layering of the sugar, rhubarb, sugar.   Turned out so wonderful!  I used this will the "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" from this site and it was an outstanding pie!!  YUM!

Just made this for the 3rd time: homemade crust, butter omitted, egg yolk wash.  A little more rhubarb than called for, filled my 4 C measure to the top (probably 5 C).  I can't imagine what the "1" reviewers are doing wrong; it's not the recipe's fault.  This is a superb pie!  Perfect consistency, perfect tart/sweet taste.  I sifted the sugar and flour and stirred until the mixture was uniform, then distributed it just as directed. This should avoid the problems of lumps, sliminess, and granulation that some people complained of.  Next time I'll try the T of butter to see if it adds anything (besides calories...but who's counting?).

I got fresh rhubarb in my farm share last week, but only enough for half of this recipe. So, I pulled out my muffin tins and saw how many mini pies I could make with this recipe cut in half. It made a perfect dozen mini deep-dish pies and they were spectacular!!!! I used "Mom's Pie Crust" recipe from this site without the sugar mixed in, but with a little of the flour-sugar mixture from this recipe sprinkled on top. It was the perfect compliment to the rhubarb filling. Everyone who tried them asked for more!

I made this pie a couple days ago and it was delish! I didn't have enough rhubarb so I threw some strawberries in too, it turned out really well and it was super easy.

Very good.  Even my unripe rhubarb tasted sweet with this recipe.  I did add a pinch of ginger on top of the sugar/flour mixture.  A holdover from another recipe I have tried.  Gives it a nice zing.  Thank you for posting.

You can't get any easier than this.  We never made rhubarb pie before and picked this recipe.  GREAT!  We loved it and it was gone in a flash!  It is also SO pretty with the red rhubarb!  Try it, and you will love it.

I made this for Easter and it was gone before I even had a bite!  I used store bought crust to save time and followed everything else exactly.  This is a keeper!

Excellent recipe! I made it exactly as written.  Normally this time of year I stop watering my rhubarb so it will stop growing but not this year.  I'm going to keep it growing so I can make more pie! This pie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream was the best I've ever had!

Yum!! This was a huge hit AND especially successful for me since it was my first solo pie-making attempt. Ended up using part frozen rhubarb and part fresh and it needed to cook 10 or so minutes longer. I'll keep this on in the recipe book for sure.

This is the best recipe ever, easy to make and tastes so good. Sometimes I add one cup of strawberries to the rhubarb but other than that I keep the recipe the same.  I would recommend it to anybody.

Yummy!  The first time I didn't have enough rhubarb (we live in the south).  So I used half strawberries.  I tossed the strawberries in flour before adding them to the pie so it wouldn't be too liquidy.  It came out perfect.  I'm not making it again with all rhubarb (exactly as written).  Can't wait!

This is incredible!!!  Added a bit more flour since I used 5 cups of rhubarb.  Let the sugar the same.  Perfect mix of sweet and tart for us.

Wow! I am so impressed with this recipe! Perfect to the nines.  I have never seen a pie slice so flawlessly. It had the perfect consistency.  It was not runny at all like other reviewers said.  It held up so well through slicing and did not fall out of its shell. It was sweet and tangy. I took it over to my boyfriend's house, and both him and his mother adored it! I added the extra tablespoon of flour the other reviewers recomended but not an egg. I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1/3 cup of sugar I used the first time when it came out pretty tart.  If you like it tart I suggest using the 1/3 cup, but if you like a nice yummy pie use 3/4 cup.  Other reviewers said 1 AND 1/3 cups was too much.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture which accented the rhubarb wonderfully.  I mixed in some mixed berries I found in the freezer which made the pie so much more than just a regular old rhubarb pie.  I made my own crust from scratch and gave it a milk bath sprinkled with cinnamon sugar right before baking. It came out beautifully! This pie was just fantastic!

I found that over the years I had made various fruit pies, but not rhubarb. So I followed this recipe, only adjusting quantities slightly for my pie plate, and it was delicious. Have made it many times since, including for my mother-in-law who loved it.

This recipe made a very tasty pie.  However it was runny.  I wonder if adding a beaten egg to the rhubarb would solve that problem.  I will try that next time I make it.  Also, I only needed to bake the pie for an additional 30 minutes after turning the heat down.  The crust was already brown and the friut was soft.

Great Pie! It was the first pie I have ever made and it was delicious! You can try adding 1/4 tsp. of orange peel. Careful though, a lil goes a long way.

This pie was AMAZING! As other reviewers suggested, could have done without the extra butter if you're trying to cut down on fat. I made this with a blend of rhubarb and strawberries so I didn't need as much of the sugar/flour mix since the berries added a lot of sweetness. My husband was drooling over this...he ate 3/4 of the pie in just 2 days. This recipe is a definite keeper!!

This is a awesome pie, Was looking for something basic and easy. I put a crunch topping instead of dbl crust, Would be delicious either way.

This is a really good pie!  I used the "Best Ever Pie Crust", but with half butter/half shortening and I added an extra cup of fruit. Going by other viewers, I added an extra Tb of flour so it wouldn't be runny, which was just right.  I would use a little less sugar next time I make this one, but other than that it was quite good.

Really good recipe, but it could use more than 4 cups of rhubarb to balance out the crust. Turned out like picture. Not runny at all. Great recipe, just needs more rhubarb.

I had only had one bite of rhubarb in my life before I made this pie. It was great! I omitted (forgot?) the butter on top of the fruit, and it was fine.

Totally Awesome!!!  I cut the rhubarb to 3 cups and added 1 cup of fresh strawberries.  Just came out of the oven an hour ago.  I made two pies, one for dinner with my parents tonight and the other for my wife for Mother's Day.  Well I had to try a little, which turned into a piece and I do not think it will make it 2 more days.   Thank you for such a GREAT recipe.

I made this with the double crust pie crust recipe from "the new best recipe" cookbook and it was PERFECT.  Exactly the way my mother used to make it, I'm sure of it.  Tastes like home.... Thank-you Carol - this is such a keeper recipe.

Its good but very tart. Could use more sugar to tame the tartness. I made 3 pies - two with rhubarb only and one with strawberry and rhubarb. Family really liked it but its not for everybody. I forgot to put the butter though so maybe this has something to do with the tartness? I will try it with butter next time. We will try the strawberry one on Thanksgiving.

Loved it, loved it, loved it!!! I made it for my dad for his birthday, he's always saying how he wishes someone could make rhubarb pie the way his aunt did. This was the first pie I've ever made from scratch and he said it was every bit as good as his aunt's. The only thing I did differently was add some cinnamon.

This pie was the best.  I followed the recipe exactly and it couldn't have been easier.  Used a store bought crust to make it even easier.  It came out perfectly - no soggy crust, no runny filling.  Thank you, thank you.  A definite keeper!

This was so easy and absolutely delicious! I've always loved rhubarb pie but have never made one. My mom-in-law has it growing every year so picked some, cut it up in small pieces and used it for this pie. I only had 3 cups so used some over-ripe strawberries I had in the fridge to accomodate. I did follow the recipe exactly otherwise. I really thought it was going to come out disgusting but it was perfect and I will be making this again!

Wonderful pie!  However I did add some orange zest to the rhubarb because that was what my mother always did. It adds a very nice dimension to the rhubarb.

I have made this pie twice now.  Like another reviewer, I recently moved into a new house and inherited 3 rhubarb plants, so figured I should do something with it.  The first time I made this pie, about a week ago (which was also the first ever pie I've made), I followed the recipe exactly (except for sprinkling some sugar on top of the crust) and it turned out wonderful.  I made it today for the 2nd time, but had to change it a little.  I was a little short on white sugar, so substituted 1/3 c. brown sugar instead.  I also had to sprinkle that on top.  I also added a few drops of vanilla after reading another reviewers comments.  Surprisingly, the filling was much more tart and was a bit runny this time (maybe due to the rhubarb itself?).  However, it is still excellent and as long as the rhubarb can be used, I'll continue to make this pie.  Thanks for such an easy recipe to make me feel like a successful pie baker!

I was hesitant about just the rhubarb, so I added one honeycrisp apple, and 5 stars!  I also used Pie Crust IV.

I made this for my grandfather who is the biggest pie critic I know.  He complimented me because he said it was the perfect balance of sweet and sour and the bottom crust was done....overall he was impressed.  Oh and I left the butter out as suggested.  I even like it!

My boyfriend's favorite pie, and I had no idea how to make this (only had it twice). This recipe was a close second to his mother's and I think the only change I would make is to add a slight orange flavor to it- perhaps a tbsp of orange juice concentrate as the juice itself would make it too wet, but def not orange zest. The rest of our company hadn't had it before or said they didn't like rhubarb pie- one bite and the pie disappeared. Thanks for a simple yet delicious recipe!

This is the first time I made a 'real' pie with a homemade pie crust. I followed the instructions which worked out well but I like my rhubarb sweet so I upped the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I used a deep dish pie plate and the filling didn't boil out of the crust, I also wrapped the edges in foil until the last 15 minutes to prevent burning. Cooled it to room temp then refridgerated it and it set perfectly. This pie was beautiful and delicious! It's a keeper.

Fabulous!  Covered the crust with foil after a few minutes into cooking and kept it on the entire time.  I also didn't include the butter.  Thank you SO much for this recipe!  Yum

This recipe is exactly like mine. The only change that I make is I use 1 cup of honey for the sugar. Gives it a totally different but wonderful flavor.

I make rhubarb pies for my grandpa about 2 times a year. He is always heavy with compliments! I don't add the butter and use a bit less sugar, he's more of a tart-pie kind of guy. Excellent!  :)

We loved it!  the first time i made it, i added rasperries from the garden as well - but it turned out way too sweet!  so time number 2 we cut the sugar in half and still used raspberries- perfect!  word of caution, we like our pie a bit tart, so if you don't then keep the sugar.  i just figure that rhubarb is supposed to be tart.  anyway, great recipe!

One of the best rhubarb pies I've ever made. It is very simple and that allows the flavor of the rhubarb to shine  just as it is. The only difference I made was to pour the recommended amount of the flour/sugar mixture in the bottom of the pan, but coated the chopped rhubarb with the rest of it instead of sprinkling it on top.

This is a very good, simple to make recipe.  I used a crumb topping rather than a top crust, and it tasted great, but that is simply a matter of preference.  My husband and son won't touch rhubarb in any form, so I ate the whole pie myself, and enjoyed it very much!

Superb Pie!!!    I did add sliced & slightly-sweetened strawberries, and made it in a deep-dish pie pan.  My husband said even his mom had never made better rhubarb pie and she was a terrific cook.

I used this recipe yesterday to make my first ever rhubarb pie.  I used refridgerated pie crusts(pillsbury) as I was in a hurry.  Turned out very well.  I think I may try just tad less sugar next time.  Try using 1 c. verses the 1-1/3. Very quick and easy to make.  My mom kept telling me I was nuts for not using an egg..she was impressed at how well it turned out. I will definatly make this again.

First time I ever had rhubarb pie and it was excellent. Make sure to remove excess pie crust on top & poke holes in it.

It doesn't get any easier or better than this.  I used the crust from teh best apple pie recipe on this site, brushed on some softened butter and sprinkled with natural sugar for a pretty look.  It came out perfect.  I have had trouble with rhubarb pies coming out too runny, too sweet, or too sour.  This one was perfect in every way!

I've never had rhubarb pie before and I was a bit reluctant to try it, but oh, this pie is to die for!  I reduced the sugar to one cup, which seemed sweet enough for me, but I think that may have made the pie slightly juicier than it would otherwise have been.  Still, my husband and I both loved it and could easily finish it all tonight if we let ourselves go!

I replaced the sugar with sucanot and used whole wheat flour for a heartier, healthier pie.

The recipe has not failed for me the twenty times I have used it.  After awhile I stopped using the butter and I don't miss it at all.  The only other thing I have changed recently is sprinkling a little cinnamon sugar on top just before baking.

Just the right amount of sweetness.  Used the King Arthur pie filling enhancer instead of flour.  This disappeared in no time!

I've made this recipe five times, and each time it's perfect; not too sweet and the rhubarb flavor comes through. I've never made a rhubarb pie this good.

This was a very good recipe! The recipe called for fresh chopped rhubarb and mine was frozen. So I decided to pat my rhubarb dry with paper towels. If I make it again I will just add the frozen rhubarb as is because the filling was a little dry. Also be sure to bake your pie long enough. I chose to brush my crust with a little beaten egg for a pretty brown crust. I also made my own crust. Choose your rhubarb carefully. Young and tender is best. The first time was a learning experience for me.  I’m sure to do better on my part next time and make a pie worthy of this recipe.

This is a wonderful and basic recipe. I made it with an old never-fail pie crust recipe which includes butter, shortening, vinegar, egg and baking soda. It makes a very light, flaky and tasty crust. My mom taught me to always dot fruit with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon, so I did add cinnamon to this recipe. Good old-fashioned goodness!

This recipe is perfect as is. the crust is extra flaky and it is just the right amount of sweet and tart. I feel like I cut the rhubarb too small (about 1/4 inch) so that will be the only change I make next time.

I had never had rhubarb pie before and used this recipe to make one for my father in law's bday (his favorite) . It was SO delicious!  I also loved how incredibly easy this was. I can now say I love rhubarb pie.  I used ina garten's pie crust recipe which was also amazing.

Very simple and easy to make. However, this recipe results in a pie that’s way too sweet. The amount of sugar needs to be reduced. Also, I omitted the butter.

Great recipe, but I had to make it slightly differently (make half the filling, and do prep) unless I wanted my pie crust to come out charcoal-black because of the exceptionally-long cooking time.

Delicious and simple! Best rhubarb pie recipe. Followed directions as written and we loved it! Definitely sprinkle the flour/sugar mixture into the crust before adding the rhubarb...makes a wonderfully crispy crust! Yum!

It was super easy and turned out great. I did change one ingredient; I didn’t have regular sugar, so I substituted coconut palm sugar. It had almost a caramel flavor. It was really good.

Super simple, kid – proof, family pleasing recipe. My oven tends to run a little on the hot side, so I always make sure I put some aluminum foil around the edges, but other than that this is a spectacular recipe as is.

Easy recipe.  Will definitely make again.   Changes: omitted butter, added few drops of vanilla extract, used commercial unfrozen pie pastry.  Slit top and brushed it with milk and light sprinkle of sugar.   Baked in 9 inch glass pie plate.   At 15 minutes, placed 10 inch pie crust shield to prevent burning of crust edge.  Perfect crust coloring top & bottom.

This was so easy to make and it turned out so good.  I used a store bought pie shell. The only thing i did different was cut the sugar down to 1 cup and added some cinnamon . I have made it three times this year, and I am cutting rhubarb up for the freezer so i can make it all year round.  Thank you

I ALWAYS love your recipes!  I look thru what you have so I have a pretty good idea which is best.  This is a terrific rhubarb pie recipie!  If your rhubarb is big and juicy you can skip the butter.  Oh, & if you don't know enuf NOT to use the leaves as someone suggested...you are too dangerous to be dealing with a hot stove!!!!

Easy and fantastic rhubarb pie filling. Next time I will decrease the sugar to better highlight the rhubarb's tartness.

My Aunt made this for my daughter and me. She just passed away, so in her honor I wanted to give it a go. Since I don't have her recipe I tried to find one that seemed close. My daughter and husband said it tasted just like hers. That is the highest compliment I could possibly get.

I was very disappointed. The flour/sugar sprinkled on top did nothing to address the filling’s moisture. Very wet when you don’t distribute the flour. Also, it stuck to the top crust and bottom crust, and instead of a lovely crispy and flaky top, I had a gummy, globby mess on top of soggy rhubarb. I can only rate a two, because while the ratio of sweet to tart was appropriate but not special, I felt the method was not successful.

I make this at least twice in early summer, when rhubarb can be found outside. Since the season is so short, this pie is extra dear to me. No need to look at other recipes, unless you want custard-rhubarb pie. Somehow the rhubarb is so delicious on its own, it is hard to add anything else.

Followed the recipe exactly, but brushed the top with an egg wash and some sprinkled sugar before making a vent hole.  While the pie IS delicious, it was still soupy inside.  Could it be because I chopped the rhubarb the prior day and used it refrigerated?  Maybe being cold didn't get the inside hot enough to thicken properly

I had a frozen crust on hand so thought.. what the heck.  I bought French vanilla ice cream for it and oh my goodness!!!  It was tart, I added an extra cup of rhubarb (we grow our own so it was really fresh). We like our pies full, and it was a bit on the tart side but with the ice cream it was fantastic! Easy as pie was coined after making this pie. lol We all loved it and I will definitely make it again.  Thank you.

I  made this pie twice now.  Everyone loves it. It's the crust.  I have not mastered the art of making pie crust from scratch so I use my favorite frozen pie crust. It's  delicious. One thing that I did is moisten the top crust with a small amount of water and sprinkled sparkling sugar by Red Mill on top. The crust comes out like a crispy cookie. This recipe is so simple and fast to make.   I have a 30 year old rhubarb plant in my yard so have fresh rhubarb available. Pie crust in the freezer, rhubarb in the yard....almost done.

The only change I made is 50/50 mix of sugar and honey. The pie turned out watery but top and bottom crust is holding well. I used to pre boil pie filling,  this was  a new process for me. I did sprinkle sugar on bottom, probably why it didn’t turn to soggy pie bottom.

I made this pie yesterday and could hardly wait to eat it after dinner. I didn't have quite enough rhubarb so I took 4 very large firm strawberries and added them to the top of the pile. It worked great and tasted really good. Other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written....oops....I forgot I added about 1 tablespoon of instant tapioca to the top of the pie.  So before the night was over, the two of us had eaten half the pie. Next time I'll buy more rhubarb and add about 2 more cups to the pie and will have to adjust the sugar probably. YUMMM-O!!! And may even freeze some cut rhubarb since our season is only from March to July in San Antonio says the produce man at Sprouts. Thanks Carol.

Made this after my BF kept hinting for a rhubarb pie and he was beyond pleased with the result! He ate almost half just in nibbling out of the pie plate. It's quick, easy and tasty--a definite winner! I didn't change anything in the recipe other than adding a bit more Rhubarb, about 5 cups total.

I made this exactly as written. It needed more rhubarb. Baking it on the bottom rack made the bottom crust hard and the top crust hardly browned at all. I’m going to have to look harder for my Mom’s recipe.

I made it twice.  First one, followed directions and used Pillsbury Pie Crust, cause I am lazy and they do a great job, and it was amazing.  Don't premix the flour/sugar mix with the berries as I always did in the past, recipe works as written.  Second pie I added two cups raspberries, 7 tablespoons flour, and 2 extra tablespoons of sugar and followed the recipe and I think it was even better!  Thank you so much for a great recipe and I will never pre-mix flour with berries again.  Sometimes simple is the best.

I made this and followed most of the recipe.  I needed it to be lower in sugar so I used Truvia in place of the sugar.  I only needed a 1/2 cup of Truvia baking blend and I used two tablespoons of sugar.  I used clear jel instead of flour.  It worked out fine!  The pie was not runny and I had great bottom crust.  I followed everything else the recipe indicated.  The rhubarb was tart with sweet mixed in.  Not too sweet at all.  The hubby kept going mmmmm….

Simple but very effective, and I have made many rhubarb pies. Will try this method on other fruit pies, thank you. Added a little cinnamon the second time I made this, may be one of the best I have ever made. I also top with a little cream to brown and hold on the raw sugar I top it with for crunch.

I added a beaten egg and a tablespoon of water over the rhubarb before sprinkling the rest of sugar flour mixture on top. I used milk on top if crust and then sprinkled with sugar! Delicious!

Delicious! I beat one egg and mixed with just the rhubarb before putting the fruit into the pie to firm up the filling. It came out perfect.  Everything else I kept exactly the same. Best fresh rhubarb pie recipe I have ever tried.  I served it  warm with homemade vanilla ice cream. I wish someone would make a rhubarb pie ice cream with this recipe and sell it by the gallon!

I started making this pie several years ago. Hands down a great pie recipe, however I do change it up a little. I only use 1 cup of sugar cause I like my pie a little tart. I do not always remember the butter and it still comes out great. Favorite thing about this recipe is baking on bottom rack in oven makes crust come out nice. I have started baking all pies on the bottom rack of the oven. I have also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of all white. Do not mix the rhubarb with the flour sugar mixture. The bottom crust comes out better if you follow the directions in the recipe. The only thing that makes this pie better is a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!

I used rhubarb from my yard which  I had frozen this summer.   Next summer I'll make sure to freeze a lot more for this pie recipe.    I had just enough for one pie.   Measured the rhubarb while frozen then defrosted it fully before making the pie.   It was wonderful and so easy!

Absolutely lovely, I made this for Thanksgiving and it was perfectly tart as rhubarb should be, not too sweet at all, and has an excellent consistency. I made some fresh whipped cream with it, and my friends and family enjoyed it greatly. I'll be using this again in the future!

I made this yesterday!  I followed all the directions except I forgot the butter.  I don’t think I needed it in the end!  My bottom crust came out soggy and it shouldn’t have according to the recipe and a good many reviews!  It was a gorgeous pie...so gorgeous I didn’t want to cut into it.  When I did, the top was crispy and delicious and fruit was beautiful, but the bottom crust was soggy!  What should I do differently the next time to avoid it?

This recipe is da bomb dot com! I made one two changes. I halved the sugar ( 2/3 cup) and omitted the butter. My neighbor is a rhubarb pie connoisseur and once he tired it, offered to pay me to make the same pie for us dad on Father’s Day. It’s absolutely amazing, try to only use half the sugar, trust me it’s a perfect balance of sweet and tart :)

I can't rate it yet as I have yet to bake all 4 pies that we whipped up tonight. I do have questions though. Has anyone tried freezing the pies before baking?  Or ore baking them 3/4 of the way and slipping them into the freezer until you're ready to bake them for guests?  (I prebake all of my Dutch apple and peach pies for the freezer every fall so I have them ready in no time when company come's over. We do at least 18-24 pies).
But I curious as to the pies turning out being that they'll be frozen raw first.  I'm making these because it's his mom's 90th birthday  and all she wants is rhubarb pie and since I'm the only baker I got asked. 
Thanks for the input in advance

This is so easy to make and butter or no butter the pie sets up well and is delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The high temperature start is new to me but I have made  this pie twice and both turned out beautifully.

Great recipe!  The only change I made was covering the crust edge after the first 15 minutes of baking for the remaining time.  You don't need strawberries to make this sweet-tart rhubarb pie!  Delicious by itself or with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  I would definitely make this again.  I used thawed frozen homegrown rhubarb.   Simple to make and few ingredients needed.   If you're new at pie baking, make sure you line the bottom of your oven with aluminum foil to catch any drips.

I only ended up using less than a quarter of the flour/sugar mix and it was still a little sweet.  But it was a fantastic pie and will be made again!!

I baked this wonderful pie yesterday and I honestly cannot believe how amazing it was. The same as others i thought it was going to be too much sugar but it was just right. the only thing is my bottom crust came out really soggy because of the juices. But it was just beautiful. I will definatelly make it again ??

This was the second time I’ve made it. The first time I did as instructed and didn’t mix the flour/sugar. I had small lumps of it that didn’t dissolve. This time, I mixed the ingredients and it was perfect! Very easy and tastes as good as grandmas!

When I made this recipe, I added 6 drops of red food coloring to the sugar.  I also added one pound of strawberries and 2 Tbs of tapioca to help thicken the pie, due to the liquid from the strawberries.   I made a bottom crust and a crumble for the top.  It turned out to be a beautiful red and extremely delicious!!  It was also quick and easy to make.  I have looked for many, many years to find a rhubarb pie recipe that is PERFECT!  I can now stop my search.  I have found the recipe I have been looking for.  It's a keeper for sure.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.? I love it!

I Love rhubarb pie, but I add the zest of 1 orange and I use 1/3 cup of brown sugar, the fill the cup up with Agave.  The Agave is 25% sweeter than sugar and is low glycemic. The pie comes out slightly tart which I like.

Extraordinarily good pie! I added a bit more rhubarb but kept everything else the same. The sugar & flour layer top and bottom is a great tip, something I've never tried and it worked great. I would not leave the butter out--this is something my mom always added to her pies and it  lends some extra (subtle) goodness for sure. 
I used to have a knack for making pie dough and then for some reason lost the magic for many years. This time I tried Cook's Illustrated Foolproof Pie Crust recipe. The dough rolled out perfectly and was more tender and delicious than I could have  hoped for. 
Simple goodness, this pie.  People were rolling their eyes in bliss.

After reading all the reviews about the amount of sugar in this recipe and the way some people reported the top layer of flour/sugar didn't mix correctly,  I was worried about following the directions, but I did. I went with SweetTooth's review about being sure to put the flour/sugar mixture on the bottom of the pan and not using butter. There were no problems with the flour sugar mixture and it wasn't runny, but you DEFINITELY need the butter. This was too tart without it.

This recipe was perfect as is! Fallowed of to the T except I added a few red food coloring drops to the sugar, before I added flower, to make the pie more appealing to be eye (I used green rhubarb). I also did a egg wash over the top then sprinkled it lightly with sugar before popping it in the oven and repeated the egg wash and sugar half way threw. Everyone at the Memorial Day party loved this pie it was a huge hit. Consistency was perfect, perfect amount of sweetness to tart! Simplest and tastiest pie I’ve ever made. Everyone’s already asking for me to bring it to the next family get together, a new tradition. Good thing rhubarb grows in my back yard!

fantastic flavor.  I used 1/2 cup turbinado sugar and 1/4 c coconut sugar in place of the 1 1/3 C white sugar and gluten free flour (Namaste) in place of the all purpose flour. And I added ten very large strawberries.

This pie is amazing  and so very easy to make ! My grandmother had made rhubarb pie since the 1930s and when she died nobody had her recipe. My family has tinkered around trying to get the recipe just right and this recipe tasted exactly like my grandmother’s!  This pie brought my mom to tears (of joy) so thank you very much for your simple and delicious recipe!

I followed the recipe as written.  It was great.   Next time, I will reduce the amount of sugar & add a small amount of strawberries.  Loved it.

I am sure that I did something wrong though I followed the instructions meticulously and even took pictures at every step of the way so someone could point out the mistakes I made. I ended up with a tasty Rhubarb soup in tough shoe leather. I'm literally going to pour the rhubarb into a container and toss the crust..maybe it'll be good over icecream. Absolute failure.

So I use to always see rhubarb on cooking shows so I decided to try it myself. I didn't really know what to do with it so I decided to make a pie. This recipe is great! It was delicious and juicy. I will definitely be making this again!

My pie came out soupy, not sure why after reading all the great reviews. I'm still giving 5 stars because it was a delicious pie, and I will be using this recipe again for sure. Next time I will probably add a little cinnamon, and a drop of vanilla.

WOW. This is an extremely delicious and simple recipe. I think depending on the tartness of your rhubarb, however, your pie may not need all that sugar. I made it once exactly as the recipe was written and it was great, but a little too sweet. I made it again with the same harvest of rhubarb and reduced the sugar to 1 cup and also omitted the butter and it was still delicious and sweet. If you want a more tart pie, I would reduce the sugar even more than that.

Perfection!! The contrast of sweet and tart makes this pie the perfect dessert! I used 8-10 stalks of rhubarb and followed the recipe exactly. It came out awesome and disappeared in minutes. A real hit that I will make again and again!

This is amazing!  Another reviewer said the sugar caramelizes in the bottom and it seems to be true.  I never knew rhubarb pie could taste so good.  I have made it twice with the deep dish pie  measurements given by reviewer L K Kling.  It was a huge hit at our summer BBQ!  I, my husband, and others all rate it as the best rhubarb pie they've ever tasted.  This is a keeper!

Fabulous combination. I substituted coconut oil for butter and used my homemade sourdough crust. I think I will use an additional cup of rhubarb next time. Make the two pies I created from it more filling.

Amaaazing pie! To be honest i did cheat and used store bought pie crusts, and i didnt put the little dabs of butter before placing the top crust over the filling but everything else to do with the filling was exactly as the instructions said to do. 

I did take a fellow commenter's (Gail) advice and put a cookie sheet with rimmed sides in the oven for about 15 mins while it was preheating, and placed my pie pan ontop of it once the oven got to the right temperature and for the first time EVER i actually have a bottom crust that isnt soggy on my rhubarb pie!! So thank you, Gail!!

I made it the way someone suggested by putting sugar in the bottom of the crust and on top of fruit instead of mixing it all into rhubarb. It didn't seem to crystallize as they thought it would.  It was a good pie and it turned out the way my recipe does. I had left my recipe at other house. Very good and, yes, I would make it again.

Best Rhubarb Pie ever!  This may be my favorite pie.  I tend to go a little light on the sugar by adding extra rhubarb, but that is my personal taste.  I love the slightly tart rhubarb paired with the crispy sweet bottom crust.  I was concerned about baking it on the bottom oven rack, but am glad I trusted the recipe.  I consistently get compliments on this pie even from guests who tell me they simply will not like it because they hate rhubarb.

Followed the recipe ingredients as listed and it turned out great. I put the bottom crust in the oven for ~10 mins before adding in the filling and covered the crust edges in foil for the first 15 mins to prevent burning as recommended. Got lots of compliments from people who's grandmas used to make rhubarb pie for them.

Though I don't bake often, when I saw fresh Rhubarb in our local store I had a craving for the Rhubarb Pie Grandma used to make. I used this recipe and it turned out great.

A very good rhubarb pie. Will cut down on the sugar next time as it is a tad bit too sweet for my tastes.

Huh, this whole time I thought I didn't like Rhubarb! Made the exact recipe and used frozen pie shells. Agree with other person on here that not mixing the dry ingredients in with the fruit makes a great crispy sugar shell. It was a little runny when I cut it. Wrapped the edge to keep from burning and would probably try the egg wash on top next time.

I followed this to the dot, and sadly it turned out watery and a disappointment. (I had to drain the pie of water to even attempt eating)

Still on the search for that perfect rhubarb pie... Sigh.

This is the kind of rhubarb pie recipe I grew up with.  Now I make it for my mom. So glad to live in the north where there is always rhubarb in late spring and summer. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!  Quick, fresh and really celebrates the flavor of rhubarb.  Doing an egg wash with sugar dusting is a must for the shine and crunch.

Absolutely  the best rhubarb  pie!  Made multiples  of this pie  for a nursing  home  where  I volunteer .  Made for 100+ residents  and it was loved by all who tried it. Now they begin  asking  in January , " when will the  rhubarb  be ready  ".

This is the best rhubarb pie recipe I've ever made!  The bottom crust isn't soggy thanks to the tip of sprinkling some of the flour/sugar mixture on the bottom before adding the rhubarb. I used 6 c. rhubarb since it's what I had had hand. Didn't adjust the sugar & it was absolutely the perfect tartness.

would  not follow this recipe again.  Way too much sugar.  When you put the  flour/sugar mixture on the bottom of the pie it doesn't cook in and your eating pure sugar on the bottom crust.

I love rhubarb, and this pie is delicious. I won't ever use another recipe.  I used rhubarb fresh out of my garden.  I cheated and used a roll up crust, but it was still amazing.

I had so much hope after reading the other reviews that, this time,  I wouldn't make another soupy rhubarb pie.  I only had frozen rhubarb (hey - it's January!) and my pie plate is large, so I used 6 cups and did 1 1/2 recipes of the sugar and flour mix.   That was a very bad idea, as the pie was too sweet, the rhubarb was undercooked and it was a soupy mess after I cut into the perfect looking pie.  I will try this again in the spring with fresh rhubarb and follow the recipe exactly .  Hopefully, I can change my review after a better result.

Excellent flavor. Be sure to follow the directions for putting the sugar and flour on the bottom and on the top. this makes the crust nice and crisp instead of soggy.

This made a perfect pie.   I did not have enough fresh rhubarb so I used half fresh rhubarb, and half fresh pears.  I cored, pealed, and sliced the pears, and tossed them with a teaspoon of corn starch before adding them to the crust.   Tasted great, and firmed up nicely.

The first time I made this recipe, I only had enough rhubarb for 2-2 1/2 cups, so I only used about 3/4 of the sugar/flour mix and it turned out perfect. The second time I made this recipe, I followed the ingredients to the letter, and it didn't turn out as well. (I.e. The pie was runny, even after sitting for hours.) the next time I make it, I'm either going  To go back to using less rhubarb, or increase the flour/sugar mixture. As another reviewer stated, egg wash on top makes the crust super pretty. Also, wrap the edges of your crust in aluminum foil and then remove the last 10-15 minutes of baking.

I've baked a lot of pies, but I've never made a rhubarb pie. I followed the recipe to the letter, except 4 cups of rhubarb didn't fill the pie plate so I used 5 cups and adjusted the flour/sugar proportionately.  I made 2 pies and both were perfect.  They were beautiful and tasted amazing.  I made them for our docking crew and everyone loved it. The filling thickened perfectly.   I did brush the tops w/ an egg mixed with 1T of water, then sprinkled sugar - both at the beginner and half way through as another reviewer suggested.  I loved the results and the pies were almost too pretty to cut.  I served w/ vanilla bean ice cream.  This recipe is a keeper.

Made this recipe as instructed.  Was very disappointed.  It came out too soupy and too sweet.  I will scoop out the rhubarb and save it by serving over ice cream.  Looking for another recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly but I forgot the dots of butter. But, it was delicious and the best pie ever. I wasn't sure about not having strawberries in it, but they were definitely not needed.

Yummers. I am not much of a baker but this pie was a winner. It was runny at first so I put in the fridge, now I have been back to the fridge eating more. The crust was not soggy as some pies I have made. Come on rhubarb grow I want more pie. Wonderful Carol, thank You.

Followed recipe perfectly, but pie didn't seem done. Cooked an additional 10 min and after it cooled flour still wasn't gelled or sugar dissolved, and was very runny. Ended up scraping out the filling, cooking it in a pot and putting it back in the crust. The texture was gummy and really really sweet. I think this recipe has potential, but I'd cut the sugar in half. Needs some lemon juice or something too. Is just one dimension, sweet.

I added 1cup of strawberries, stayed at shy 4 cups rhubarb. I used 3 T flour and 3 T tapioca. Worked out good. Kept sugar the same.

this was fantastic. I followed the recipe exact for the filling and bought store made crust. the only thing I did different was an egg wash, sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the crust.  I took 2 of these pies to work and got so many compliments.  this will be my new go to rhubarb recipe!

This was the most amazing rhubarb pie ever! Will definitely be making it again very soon! The only thing I will do different just to try is make my homemade crust. I had a Pillsbury ready to go crust in fridge so I used it. Which was  awesome! My 2 and 4 year old grandsons couldn't even get enough of it!  You have to try it!

There is no reason to change anything in this recipe. It is perfect exactly as is. Not too sweet, not to tart. And even when I cut it warm it wasn't runny. Don't change a thing!

Turned out GREAT! I used a 9" pan, 5 cups of rhubarb, a little more sugar and no butter. I also sprinkled sugar on top, this adds to the tart-sweet experience.

I have ALWAYS had a soupy result. It was still tasty but I couldn't get rid of all that juice. Not this time. I'm still getting used to a new stove so it was a good thing I checked it early. At 30 minutes it was done. And it was awesome. My wife was proud of my effort. I love rhubard!

Gave this recipe to my daughter to make her first from scratch pie. She is 16 and did it on her own from start to finish. It was delicious! Next time we will nix the butter as suggested. She sprinkled a tiny bit of vanilla over the pie before topping with the second bit of crust.

Loved this recipe!  I was reluctant to accept when the neighbor offered us some rhubarb, because neither my husband or I are fond of rhubarb pie, but we let the kids get it, and I tried the first recipe I came across.  Hubby wanted to give it 10 stars, finicky 8 y/o son wanted to give it 6!  This will be our rhubarb pie recipe from now on.  We definitely like this one.  :-)

Loved the pie!  The crust did not get soggy even though the filling was a bit runny.  I had my rhubarb stored in the fridge with some water, so I'm thinking my rhubarb had a bit more water than usual.    If fresh out of the garden, the recipe would be perfect!

Baked this with exact ingredients inside. Brushed with egg and sprinkled top with about 1/4 tsp. of sugar. That made all the difference in the appearance. Delicious and so easy. Sorry, Mom, but I now have a new rhubarb pie recipe!

This pie was delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly except for one thing... I only had 3 cups of rhubarb, so I added 2 cups of quartered strawberries.  It turned out fabulously.  Definitely will make this again.

This is my go to recipe for rhubarb pie. My grandmother used to make it for her kids & us grandkids from the rhubarb she grew in her little backyard garden in Michigan & it was always my favorite pie. Being born & raised in Florida it is impossible to find pre made plain rhubarb pie, only strawberry rhubarb, which is fine but just not the same. I've made this recipe 3 times now, twice with homemade butter crust & once with a store bought frozen pie shell from Whole Foods & it's always been fantastic. My dad loved it too & said it reminded him of his mom's. I took a couple of suggestions from other reviewers & used just around 6 cups rhubarb (frozen/thawed/drained from grocery store), 1 1/2 cups sugar & 7 tbsp flour. I brushed the top crust with a little raw egg mixed with 1 tbsp water & sprinkled with a bit of white sugar & covered the crust edges with foil for the 1st 15 minutes of baking to keep it from  too dark& it was perfect!

I covered the crust with tin foil to keep it from getting burnt.  Another tasty trick is to gently brush egg wash over the top and lightly sprinkle sugar in the raw on it when you turn the temp down to 350*

I planted rhubarb in my garden a couple of years ago, this year it's ready to start harvesting so I'm looking for recipes to try.  I picked this one to try first ... and it was absolutely fabulous!  I did use about 5 cups of rhubarb, because I have a 10-inch pie pan, and also added half a packet of raspberry Jell-O, only because my husband remembered his mom using strawberry Jell-O in her rhubarb pies.  Brushed a little egg wash on the top crust and sprinkled with some coarse sugar.  I think putting some of the flour-sugar mixture on the bottom crust before adding the rhubarb is really key to the fact that this is probably the only fruit pie I've ever made where the bottom crust wasn't soggy; this pie came out of the dish absolutely perfectly.  And, while using the butter to dot the top of the mixture may be optional (as suggested by another reviewer), I believe the purpose of that is to help keep the mixture from bubbling out of the top crust.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe and making my first attempt at a rhubarb pie such a winner, Carol; this will definitely be making a regular appearance in our house!

Loved this recipe for rhubarb pie.  The flour thickened the juices nicely, and her method of baking it on the lower rack allowed the crust to brown without burning before the filling was done.  Adding about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the filling is also good as well as sprinkling the top crust with sugar before placing in the oven.

Growing up, I was a rhubarb nut!  I liked it raw with a little salt.  True rhubarb lovers would never dream of adding strawberries or raspberries to their rhubarb.  This pie recipe is the best I have ever run across.  Most people will try to tell you that you need cook your rhubarb and sugar first.  Not so...  As this recipe will prove, cooked in the shell is better.  
    I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only thing that I did differently was to add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the sugar/flour mix.  Some allspice or pumpkin spice would be interesting as well.
I also finished my pie top with an egg wash and then sprinkled with a little Demerara Sugar (course, pure Florida cane sugar). 
   Cooking time and temps were almost perfect for a deep 9" shell.

I had never tried rhubarb or anything with rhubarb in it until I made this pie.  Hubby and I were both skeptical after tasting raw rhubarb.  However, we LOVED it! Will make again and will try variations such as the one on this site with rhubarb and pineapple.  (The Bumbleberry Pie on this site with rhubarb is also DELICIOUS!)

This was the easiest recipe ever.  I used a refrigerated pie crust and then did exactly what the recipe said.  It turned  out perfect.  I loved not mixing the rhubarb with the sugar and flour.  This is the only rhubarb pie recipe I will ever use again!

I use 4.5 cups rhubarb with the same sugar -- I like mine a bit more tart.  3 pads of butter -- about 2 tbls total --adds richness, but not needed.  And I do the milk and sugar top crust thing.  I hadn't tried the sugar dump before -- I had always mixed it -- that is a good trick!

Wow wow wow! Made this pie for my Mom and Dad and we absolutely loved it! Thank you Carol! Easy as...pie to make.  Follow the recipe as written. And yes, leave the butter in---it's only a tablespoon! Wasnt a real big rhubarb fan until now. Can't wait to plant my own rhubarb just to make this pie again.

Awesome recipe!  Best pie I ever made.  I still use the Pillsbury crusts, and used about 6 cups rhubarb, and adjusted the other things just as equal, but it was sooo good!

  Update:  July 2018  This is such a good recipe!  Still 5 stars.  I again added about 6 cups.  Mixing and baking directions are the same.  (I just think any pie is better with more filling)  :-)

My husband made this tonight and it was Delish!  He usually makes a custard rhubarb pie but this was far easier and far tastier. The only changes were reducing the sugar by 1/3 of a cup and substituting 1 cup of strawberries for 1 cup of the rhubarb.  He says this will be his go to rhubarb pie recipe from now on!  Thanks for a delicious easy to prepare rhubarb pie recipe!

Never having made a rhubarb pie before, I hesitantly made this (favorite) pie for my husband (with haunting images of my grandmother's perfection). This pie is so simple and delicious!  Thank you so much.  My husband is so happy.

This is the best, look no further! I have made this 3 times and get rave reviews every time, the bottom crust is never soggy as with so many other recipes. Even when I cheat and use a refrigerated pie crust it is wonderful!

You don't need to measure the rhubarb, just fill the pie plate. You can also reduce the sugar content if that is your thing. I used one cup on the dot, and it was amazing: tart and tangy and sweet.

I have made a lot of rhubarb pies in my time, and all have turned out well, but not this pie. Followed directions as written, and while the top crust was crispy, it was also too dark and not very flavorable, and the inside of the pie was soggy. The baking directions must be way off, as after I baked the pie for 15 minutes at 450º, then reduced the heat to 350º to finish baking the pie. I also decided to check on the pie after 30 minutes, and I'm glad I did, as the pie crust was already a bit too dark. If I had left the pie bake for another 15 minutes, it would of been completely burnt. I also think the pie needed another cup or more of the rhubarb, as the 4 cups just didn't seem like enough.

I have made a lot of pies over the years and if you like sweet this is your pie.  We prefer a little more tart so I increased the amount of rhubarb, the pie is in the oven now. The recipe instructions to put the sugar and the flour top and bottom is good. I always sprinkle a pinch of salt on a pie and always little chunks of butter on top.  Pie is not a low cal desert so one must make choices. I aways brush the edge of my crust with cream before I put the lid on and brush the top of the people ie with cream and sprinkle a very generous amount of white sugar to give the pie a glorious appearance. I also watch the baking and cover my pie with aluminum foil when it is the perfect color, this is usually the last 10 minutes of baking. All this being said, I made the pie for company following the exact directions and they loved it, but hubby thought is too sweet.  The adjusted amount of rhubarb (five cups) was perfect, a little tart and slightly runny.

Good news: I really loved the flavor of this pie!! I added 1/2 cup of raspberries and 1/2 cup strawberries to the  over full 4 cups of rubarb and it was great!!   Now  the not so good news:
It was never mentioned that you should NOT use a convection oven or if you do to make adjustments - so I had my crust burnt pretty bad - see the picture. Luckily I checked it after 20 min and pulled it out of the oven.  Even though it was rough around the edges- it still tasted amazing. I will make again - what are the rules about using convection ovens on this pie?

Great pie! Much faster, easier and better than mixing sugar & rhubarb as other recipes say to do! Brushed top with cream,(hate using egg for the small amount needed for a wash) and sprinkled with sugar. Next time will try to sprinkle more evenly, and not use as much--the top crust, while crispy, was a little too sweet. I'm off to make another one now!

Great recipe!  Thank you for sharing. Tonight was my first time making Rhubarb pie and it is now my favorite pie of them all!  I especially love the sweet and sour effect it has.

Almost as good as my Moms. I found fresh rhubarb at Whole Foods. I recommend using more the 4 cups of rhubarb. I used about 5 and it came out great.

Made this with NO SUBSTITUTIONS. And it worked like a charm twice in a row! My biggest fear with pies is that they will end up runny, but this one pulled it off flawlessly. Also, added just the right amount of sweetness to the tart rhubarb to make it a crowd pleasing.

Kind of disappointing. The four cups weren't really enough and I found it very sweet. This is the first time I've made straight rhubarb… next time I'll go back to the strawberry and rhubarb combination.

This pie is absolutely fantastic! I made it exactly as written and used a premade pie crust from the store (laziness). It was one of the best pies I've ever had. The perfect blend of sweet and tangy, and so simple! I will definitely be making this again!

I don't usually like pie because of the soggy crust.  This technique of layering the sugar and flour mixture with the fruit left a flaky bottom crust.  I used "Ruth's grandma's pie crust" from this site, which is amazing.

Oh this one is a big YES. How can anything so simple be so good? This is my go-to rhubarb pie recipe. My 100% rhubarb pie-loving boyfriend thinks that this is the best he has ever had. Do put the pie on the lowest rack and follow the temp instructions. Do everything as written!

Others said that they rubbed food coloring into the sugar/flour mixture - I do not recommend that - I found that although the coloring gave the juices a beautiful rosy hue, there was red lumpy-looking coagulation (from the flour thickener) that didn't look nice. Now, we just eat the pie in all its green glory and leave out the food coloring.

Mmm.. I followed the recipe exactly and it was sooo good! Unless you like your rhubarbs sour, the amount of sugar isn't too much! It is not overly sweet, and sometime you'll get a sour piece of rhubarb which makes a nice balance with the rest of the pie. I covered the edges for the last 15-20 minutes. Very delicious!

Was not impressed with this at all, was strangely both too tart and too sweet at the same time. The too tart part could be because it was the first rhubarb of the year here, so am planning on giving this another try later in the year with less sugar, but will make a mini pie just in case.

Made recipe as stated. It was not juicy and had too much flour. This time I have reduced the flour to1/4 cup(4 T), added  grated orange peel, and about 2 T of the orange's juice. We will see the results.

This recipe is terrific! I used a Pillsbury crust, and added some cinnamon (maybe 1/4 t) to the sugar/flour mixture. I didn't want to overdo the cinnamon. The pie was delicious. It is very similar to my mother's recipe but just more rhubarb. Simple is often better, and this pie is great!

Wow!  Perhaps a tad too much sugar, but otherwise this is the best rhubarb pie recipe I have found.  It is amazing how the same ingredients layered rather than mixed together can make such a huge difference.  And do cook at a high temp on the bottom  rack for 15 min., it makes the bottom crust firmer, which in contrast to the creamy texture of the fruit is just devine.

I am not a baker, so this is my first pie, let alone my first rhubarb pie.  It turned out incredible!  My husband went back for seconds.  Thank you so much!

Fantastic!  Just like Grandma used to make.  The sugar mixtures forms a crunchy layer that is just the best.

Very good.  I have tried it with the specified amount of sugar and found it way too sweet.  Now I use 2/3 cup of sugar and it is a big hit.

OMG this was fabulous! My Pampered Chef pie plate takes 6 cups of fruit, so I used the 4 c. rhubarb called for (diced small) plus 2 c. sliced strawberries that I had to use up. Mixed the sugar and 4 T. flour with the fruit, totally forgot the butter, and it came out fantastic. My husband said I outdid myself. WooHoo! Thank you Carol.

This pie is INCREDIBLE. Took this to a Memorial Day cookout. No one, including me, had ever eaten rhubarb. But decided to try this since my rhubarb plant is finally big enough. Everyone, including me, said this was by far the BEST PIE THEY HAD EVER EATEN!!! I peeled some of the rhubarb since some of it seemed tough, cut it into 1/2 pieces and since I had some left over strawberries I also added 4 large strawberries that I cut in half and layed on top of the rhubarb with the cut-side "up" (thought that might keep them from making the bottom crust soggy. Will add a few more next time, now that I know it works). Used 1 cup sugar and 1/3 cup of Stevia in The Raw (will try again using less sugar/more Stevia, now that I know that works) and used pre-made Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust. Poked lots of holes in the top of the crust then mixed water with egg and brushed it on top, and sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar on top.  That made the crust very crunchy. This pie was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS, especially with vanilla ice cream. This is a keeper!

The best rhubarb pie recipe ever! I was so happy to find a recipe that did not call for tons of odd spices and here it is. I made it last night and was the best pie ever. I love it was such a simple recipe to make.

This is a keeper and printed it off and is now inside my cookbook. Thank you!

I would suggest you put a 1/4 tsp. of orange zest (No more) over the top before placing the top crust. Hmmm! Best you've ever tasted. And, don't forget the dobs of butter.

I make it all the time. Sometimes instead of 4 cups of rhubarb, I put 3 cups, and add a cup of chopped strawberries. Flavor is unbelievable. Best pie ever, especially with homemade butter crust.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but for the rhubarb we grow I use half the sugar.   Next time I plan to add an apple for a little more jelling!

This was wonderful..my little 4 year old granddaughter has her own rhubarb here that she has been taking care of and she wanted to make her Papa a Rhubarb Pie as a surprise so I came here and found this simple recipe. Well her rhubarb was ready to pick so we went out she cut it (with her little pruners) brought it in and washed it. Then I cut it into pieces. She helped roll out the crust and then did as exactly what the recipe said except we didn't add the margarine as SweetTooth had stated in the review. This turned out perfect!!! Do exactly in the recipe with the sugar and flour..This is one recipe that is on the top of my list! My Granddaughter even loved it and was so excited to surprise her Papa with the pie too..

This was exactly the recipe I wanted.  Basic rhubarb pie.  Sweet, tart, juicy but not runny.  Like it is suppose to be.  Like you would imagine Aunt Bea made.

By far the best rhubarb pie I have ever eaten.  Never have been a fan of rhubarb but was looking for a recipe to make pie for my husband.  He loved it and now I am a fan too.  The only change I make is some times I change sugar for splenda as I have a family member who is diabetic.

Very, very yummy!  I didn't have a top crust so I mixed some butter, sugar, flour and a pinch of cinnamon and sprinkled it on top. The combination of the crunchy sugar and that juicy sour rhubarb filling was amazing!  And it was soo simple. Can't wait to make this pie again.    :)

Made this for company and it was soooo wonderful! Our friends were from Minnesota and as soon the husband tasted it he started talking about how it reminded him of his mom's rhubarb pies. I used evaporated cane juice instead and it's a little sweeter and full-flavored than white sugar, so I cut the amount back a bit. The thing that made this recipe stand out to me though was the instructions for layering the flour/sugar mix with the rhubarb- makes a winner! Thanks for sharing!!!

Loved this pie, DH liked it too, and he doesn't care for rhubarb. Next time I make it, I'll decrease sugar as I like it to be more tart.

This pie is amazing!! My Mom was craving old-fashioned rhubarb pie. This recipe hit the spot! I made it with the Foolproof double pie crust from Cook's Illustrated and did a lattice top to allow maximum evaporation. We served it warm in bowls with a little cream. Delish!

Plain rhubarb pie is fine, but I like strawberries with mine, and you can sub four with tapioca to thicken.

First time I made a rhubarb pie, this was really good! I used half the flour and sugar and omitted the butter, sweet enough and not juicy, served with vanilla ice cream. Will try 1/4 sugar next time, 1/3 cup.

If you like rhubarb pie without the strawberries, this is probably the pie for you.  My family liked it--but all agreed it would have benefitted from the addition of strawberries.

I substituted brown sugar for the white and a touch more four and it was a HUGE hit! I used a very flaky pie crust recipe and topped it vanilla bean ice cream and it was just superb.

Great easy recipe.  It was delicious - the only problem I had was that it browned to fast so I covered it with foil the last 20 minutes.

I've made a lot of pies, however, not rhubarb.  This recipe looked simple.  It looked picture perfect coming out of the oven but I think it should have read 1/3 cup of suger, NOT 1 1/3 - wayyyyyyy too much sugar!!  No one could eat it, very disappointing.

A bit sweeter than I prefer, but take a bit of the sugar out and it will be perfect. A very good rhubarb pie recipe.

This pie is so easy to make and is delicious. My picky 15 year old loved the pie served with vanilla ice-cream.  I also sprinkled a little vanilla sugar on the top of the crust after I glazed it with egg white prior to baking.  Wonderful recipe....I am going to see if you submitted a berry cobbler recipe!

ELMIRA--I would recommend adding 3 cups starwberries and increasing sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  If you add fewer than 3 cups, just adjust sugar slightly although there isn't much difference between 1 1/3 cups and 1 1/2 cups obviously.

Made this pie for our mother's day celebration with Rhubarb from my father's garden.  It was a big hit. Not runny at all.  I haven't been as successful with other recipes. Will make this again and again. Only thing I did different was add some foiling around the crust at the end of baking as it was getting a little too dark.

FANTASTIC recipe!  I made it for my friend, whose favorite dessert is rhubarb pie, and he said it was the best he'd had in years.  I also served it to people who had never tried it or even didn't like it, and they all went back for seconds. Thank you!!

First rhubarb pie I ever made, and will certainly not be the last! This recipe worked extremely well for me. I had a little less rhubarb than the recipe called for, and maybe that's what made the filling a little gluey, but it still tasted wonderful.
