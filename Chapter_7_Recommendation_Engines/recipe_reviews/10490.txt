I work at a small candy store in town so I used our own chocolate instead of the chips. The easiest way to make these cups though, is to use some sort of squeeze bottle, or maybe even a pastry bag with a big pipe on the end to fill the cups. First, line your cups with the paper. Form balls of the PB mixture by warming about a teaspoon of the dough in your hands and rolling it into a ball. Fill a squeeze bottle with chocolate, squeeze a bottom into all of the cups, place a peanut butter ball in the middle of the chocolate and then squeeze the remaining chocolate in around the sides and tops of the cups. You can whip these out so fast this way, and they look very professional...and they taste good too!

We LOVED these, but never having made candy before I thought the instructions seemed a little too simple!  After making these and finding somethings out the hard way I have a couple of modifications:  make the peanut butter filling first and let it cool while painting the cups.  I also melted the chips in two batches, otherwise the chocolate hardens before you get to use it for the top layer.  If using stovetop watch carefully – if the chocolate gets too hot it will seize and not melt!! I melted 1 c chips and 1 T shortening in microwave for 1 minute, stirred and microwaved for additional 30 seconds or until melted and smooth.  After painting the cups I let them chill and then formed the cooled  peanut butter filling into 30 little discs the size of quarters.  The  filing was kind of hard and crumbly, but just warm it up in your had for a second and it gets easy to work with. (I also had enough filling to make 60 cups, not just 30!) I put a disc in each cup then placed the cups in a jelly roll pan (or something w/ sides), melted the 2nd half of the chocolate chips, spooned about ½ t melted chocolate on top of the filling and then after finishing every 4 or 5 cups I tapped the pan on the table to even the chocolate out and remove air bubbles - this gave it a perfectly smooth finish and professional look!

Instead of doing the paper cups I used a 9x13 pan and spread the chocolate in the bottom, chilled, spread the peanut butter, chilled then added chocolate again and then cut into squares.  It was pretty good but really didn't taste like a Reese's cup.  Cutting them in squares made it a much easier project though.

I used larger paper cups and creamy peanut butter instead of the chunky.  
Big hit with the kids!!!  People said they are better than the real thing!

OH MY WOW!  It is true that the other reviewers have said, "They are time consuming!"  The end result is totally worth it.  I wasn't sure about the crunchy peanut butter, but I used it anyway.  They are great.  If you like the store bought candy....you must try these.  Thank you...these are going out to my entire family for a christmas treat.

All I can say is, "WOW!" The recipie was right on without modifications. My friends and co-workers instantly devoured them. Actually, I was bold enough to make 120 of these wonderful treats the first try. If you make that many, I highly recommend having someone to help out; it can be rather time consuming. Another hint: make sure to press the filling into the cups so the chocolate covers it nicely. ENJOY!

I have been making these for a couple of years now, and have shortened the process alot over the years -here's my tips: Use a pastry brush to fill cups, let them harden, then fill then with the PNB filling while still warm. I put mine into an icing bag and use that to squeeze the filling in, it's quick and easy. Once they are all filled I cover with the remaining chocolate, also from an icing bag. Easy to turn out up to 4 dozen this way. Enjoy!

These were absolutely delicious!!!  I made them a few months ago and my husband is still constantly begging me to make more, as well as the rest of my family and my in-laws!  I had a lot of comments about how they were even better than the Reese's peanut butter cups!  I did do something that was a little easier than crushing up a bunch of graham crackers.  I bought some of the "Jello" graham cracker crust mix and just used it.  It worked great!  Although for me this was a very time consuming recipe, it was well worth it!

My husband said these were better than Reese's cups. My children had fun painting the cups. Great recipe to bring the family together in the kitchen. I was contemplating using creamy p.b. but decided at the last minute to follow the recipe as given and it was great. Don't need to change a thing. I feel like I learned a secret now that I know that there are graham cracker crumbs in them. Who would have guessed? A+ recipe.

These turned out great. I have now made two batched and they turned out very well both times. I did find that the recipe made enough of the peanut butter mixture for alot more peanut butter cups, so I continued melting chcoolate and shortening until the peanut butter mixture was gone.

one important pointer: DO NOT paint the cups with chocolate all the way to the top! it makes the peanut butter cups harder to unwrap.

Wow!  I was so surprised how these turned out!  They're just as good, if not better, than the ones in the store!  They were really easy to make and only took a short time!  I used swiss milk chocolate with nougat and it turned out heavenly!  Great recipe!

I work for the studio that my kids dance at, so when the girls and I get home at night, I'm pretty hyper from being with all of my "buddies" and end up not going to bed until the wee hours of the morning. What do I do until then? GIVE IN TO MY PEANUT BUTTER CRAVING AND MAKE THESE INCREDIBLE TREATS!!!! I'm not going to compare them to the candy kind because they're different, but just as good; if not better because of the graham crackers. I really did make these for the kids, but the peanut butter queen had to have one.
You're wonderful Kathleen!!!!

This is fantastic!  I didn't use graham cracker crumbs as I didn't have any on hand and I used regular sized cups rather than the mini ones as my store was out of them!  I do want to suggest using the foil cups rather than the paper ones, though.  I've tried paper before and they stick terribly, but the foil ones will peel right off!

Delicious and easy, the perfect combo! I used semi-sweet chips, smooth pb, and butter in place of shortening. I also used an 8x8 pan lined with aluminum foil. I did layers... Chocolate, pb, chocolate. I cooled in between each layer, and it worked perfectly! I cut the bars after about 20 or so minutes in the fridge to prevent them from becoming really hard to cut later. I was worried that they might stick to the foil/dish, but they didn't. A definite new favorite!

I am definitely keeping this recipe!  However, like most recipes on here, I tweaked and worked on some changes.  In order for it to taste JUST like the Reese's peanut butter cups, I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt to the peanut butter - butter mixture, while being heated.  I also lessened the butter by 10 grams and added more peanut butter, to catch that Reese's peanut butter consistency.  To make it easier, next time, I will pour the chocolate into the paper cups, refrigerate and then pour the cold peanut butter mix into the cup, refrigerating again, and then finally adding the top most layer of chocolate.  It makes for an attractive " cup " because you can see the three layers, rather than enclosed in a cup.

Took these to a party and they were a big hit.  I modified the recipe by leaving out the graham cracker crumbs, adding 1/2 tsp salt and using butter instead of shortening in the chocolate.   One note - I used 2 1/2 cups chocolate chips.

They were pretty close to the real deal.  I took the advice of another and just put some chocolate in the bottom, then the ball of PB then some more chocolate over top.  This worked perfectly. My only complaint is that the ratios were off to me.  Next time I will do a little less PB mixture in each cup and more chocolate.

My 2 1/2 year old had a total blast helping me paint the cups.  The recipe was followed exactly and I came up with EXACTLY 30 cups.  They were delicious!  I keep them stored in the freezer until I want to eat them.  Thanks so much!

GREAT!!! I made them with semi-sweet choclate chip, which is good if you like dark chocolate, but I think they would be better with milk chocolate, so I will try it again with milk chocolate.

These are so extremly easy to make and SOOO good! I made mine gluten and corn free (powdered sugar contains corn starch) by using GF rice crispies and making my own powdered sugar.
I used 1 2/3 cup organic dark chocolate chips and 1/3 milk chocolate chips, I cut out the shortening completely and used butter:) I also used creamy PB instead of crunchy.

These are delicious and super easy to make!  I altered the recipe a bit when I made my second batch using 3/4 c. peanut butter, 1/2 c. butter, 1 c. powdered sugar and 1-2/3 c. graham cracker crumbs.  After the filling mixture cooled a bit, I rolled the mixture into balls.  I then melted the chocolate & shortening, painted bottom half of cup, placed ball of peanut butter mixture in the cup and topped with a spoon of chocolate.  These were super quick and easy, I didn't feel they were time consuming at all.

This is a great recipe. But next time I will sift the p. sugar and probably not add the graham cracker crumbs. I didnt like the texture as I wanted it real smooth. I might made a peanut butter frosting next time and use that. I did not coat the sides (as i forgot until i read the recipe again and looked at pictures) i used a squirt bottle and put the chocolate, let it chill, then added the peanut butter, let it chill, then added more chocolate and halloween sprinkles. My man loved them =)

Very good recipe, however, i omitted the graham cracker crumbs, used butter instead of shortening, and used smooth peanut butter instead of chunky. Much better. Very simple to make.

I made these in a 13x9 pan and then just used a biscuit cutter to cut them out. They looked just like Reeses peanut butter cups but it doesn't take as long as brushing the chocolate in the paper liners.

This is by far one of my favorite desserts to not only make, but to eat!  My husband's co-workers beg me to make them.  I always make a double batch so I can share them with my co-workers as well.  I usually end up with more chocolate and not enough filling, so I have learned to increase the filling just slightly.  5 stars!!!

Holy bananas these are great!!!  I use soy margarine instead of butter and dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate. These get rave reviews from everyone who tries them!

These have become a staple of my Christmas candy making. My husband's coworkers start asking about them after Thanksgiving. They are just as good as Reese's.

NB: If you're using natural PB, add 2 tbsp. corn syrup at the same time, or the filling will taste bland.

A very good recipe!  Time consuming, but worth it.   My first batch lacked a strong peanut butter taste, so I increased the PB to 1 cup, which helped a lot.  I recommend that you place the paper cups in a mini-muffin pan.  It makes the 'painting' a lot easier.  I used Ghiardelli's bittersweet chips for an intense chocolate flavor, which everybody loved.

This is one of the best desserts I have had in a long time. It is one of my all time favorites now. If you are a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup fan then you will LOVE these!!

I tried this recipe tonight. I had the paper cups but decided to use a tip from another review to spread it into a 9X13 pan hoping to save some time. Well it worked, Wonderfully! My husband had been bugging me to make peanut butter cups but I'm a cook not a baker. But I gave it a shot anyway because I like a challenge. Well the recipe is delicious and well worth the effort. I will be making these again but will use the paper cups as directed in the original recipe. Some mentioned there chocolate got stiff waiting on the cups to cool. Use a double boiler and turn off the heat but leave the pan of chocolate over it. It will stay warm and soft. I didn't let my peanut butter cool before I poured it over the cooled shell. If I had it wouldn't have spread it cooled that quickly. TIP: if you use the pan method instead of cups line ur pan with wax paper. It makes removing them much easier. I cut them with a warm knife, quickly starting at the edge of the pan. Then lifted up on the wax paper to remove the candy. If you don't line the pan they are difficult to remove. Even if you oil or spray it first. Enjoy!

I wanted a creamier center and didn't have milk chocolate so I used about 5 or 6 bars of Ghiradelli melting chocolate bar (found at Sam's) instead of the milk choc and shortening.  So I changed the filling to 3 Tbs of softenend butter, I used 1/2 cup creamy p-butter (low fat) , 1 Cup of confectioners sugar, and did not do the graham cracker crumbs.    I put the liners in a mini muffin pan for support.  If you want the tops to be smooth (not necessary), just lightly tap the mini muffin pan on the counter at the end.

Great!  Tastes just like a Reese's!!  Takes a while to make, but the end result is worth all the effort.  Careful when melting the chocolate that it doesn't seize up on you.  I added about 1 Tbs. of Canola Oil instead of the shortening to add a nice chocolate shine.

These were pretty good.  I liked the filling, but I'd try better chocolate the next time I make them.  I put the mini liners right into my mini pan to stablize them, then followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone liked them, though, and I didn't think they were very complicated to make, so I will try them again!

GREAT recipe, I highly recommend it!  Everyone loved them, and they keep very well in the refrigerator.  I made it once with the shortening and a second time with coconut oil, both great but my favorite was with the coconut oil.

This was my first time to make these and they turned out great!  I followed other suggestions.  I chilled the pb mixture, rolled it into balls and then chillsed again.  To assemble the pb cups I used a pastry bag for the chocolate, filling a cup about 1/3 full with chocolate, put in a pb ball and then filled the cup with chocolate.  This also looks great if you top it with crushed graham crackers or drizzle with white chocolate!

These are the best!  I made 12 larger sized cups and ended up doing 2 batches of chocolate with some left over.  I decided rather then to paint the liners I just spooned some chocolate in the cup then turned and twirled it so it almost coated to the top and any leftover chocolate was able to settle to the bottom.  If you try this way be sure not to get too much in the liners as then you will have to pour the excess out and it won't look neat.  I didn't freeze them very long either but they do seem to taste much better today after sitting out compared to last night when they were freshly made.  This is a keeper for sure and so simple.

Really good, espcially the peanut butter mixture, but I had a really hard time getting the milk chocolate to melt smooth, next time I will use semi-sweet bakers chocolate.  I also found them really sweet, almost sickly, I think the chocolate change will improve this problem.

I melt one pkg. of white almond bark in the micro. and add one 12oz. pkg. of semi-sweet choco. chips and stir til melted and blended. Using a teaspoon fill about 1/3 of the cup with the mixture into about 30 cups(I use the small cups that you see in restraunts for ketchup as they are sturdy and sometimes you can find them decorated).  Then put a dab of peanutbutter making sure not to touch the sides of the cup. Next add the choc. mixture on top, pushing it around the peanutbutter and covering it completly. You may need to reheat the choc. for 30 sec. if it is getting too stiff. Easy and great!  The kids couldn't get enough and now my grandkids love them too. There is no need to refrigerate unless it is very hot weather.  You can arrange these on a pretty plate or for kids leave the cups on until they eat. They also travel well. Good luck and enjoy!!

Great homemade candy! I do think that it would be better if I used creamy peanut butter, so I will try that next time I make it. My husband just can't leave them alone (haha). I made the recipe just as it said, but I took 12 muffin cups and used those to fill. Still a bit tedious, filling the cups with the chocolate, but worth it in the end. My neighbor had one yesterday and she wants to make them for Christmas :-) *** Thanks for sharing Kathleen ***

Absolutely delicious! It does take quite a while to "paint" the cups, especially when you use a spoon, but the clean-up is tasty. Even better than the Reese Peanut Butter Cups I USED to buy at the store. My daughter and I devoured them.

I've made these 3 times now. Yes they do take time, but they are so very good! The method you use to get the chocolate into the cup and to cover it doesnt matter, as long as they all get together they will taste fabulous!

Just like a Reese's!! Tried another recipe that wasn't quite that good...this one was great with a few modifications. I cut the butter in half, used smuckers natural creamy  peanutbutter,and dumped out the oil(read about this in another review that someone did) before I used it to give it that drier consistency. A dash of salt, and just a handful of crushed graham crackers,turned out awesome! Also if it's not a thick consistency just add a little more powdered sugar.!

These were amazing and a huge hit! I have to admit I did alter it to make it a copycat of the well known brand. For the peanut butter mix I used half a stick of butter and 1 cup of creamy peanut butter. Then I added 1 cup of sifted powdered sugar. I stuck this is in the freezer to make it easier to roll into balls. I omitted the gram crackers entirely. I live in Japan and can't get Peanut butter cups, I'm glad to know that I can have the same exact thing if I make them myself! I don't think I can eat store bought again!

This was a hit!!  Everyone who tried them said they were amazing!  I didn't change a thing with the recipe and it came out perfect!  I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips and Jif Extra Crunchy.  I'll be using this again for my cookie exchange tomorrow :)

I didn't have any mini muffin papers, so I decided to make regular sized cups.
The amount of chocolate mix was perfect for 12 medium cups.
However, I had to make a second batch of filling, since there was only enough for 6 of them.
Also, remember to take the peanut butter off the stove BEFORE adding the icing and graham cracker crumbs, otherwise the mixture will be too thin.
Although these were very time-consuming (especially for one person) they were well worth it in the end.

Was very impressed with how these yummy chocolates turned out. I used regular sized cupcake cups and trimmed them in half. I was worried the paper would be hard the come off after the chocolate set..but they were fine!   I brought them to a family reunion this weekend and they were eaten up so quickly!  Try this recipe..you won't be disappointed.

Excellent. I used bittersweet chocolate because I didn't have milk chips. I also used a spoon to spread chocolate in the cups. I used creamy PB and oil instead of margarine and shortening. Surprisingly, it still worked. The PB was watery so when I put chocolate on top i had to spread the chocolate quickly...

Great copy recipe. My family loved these better then the store bought ones! If you like a creamy version try powdered sugar-or crunchy use granulated sugar.

I made these the other day but I used my own melted chocolate (I run my own little chocolate/baking business from home) and instead of using paper cups I molded them into roses and lips for valentines day.  The peanut butter mixture reminded me of peanut butter cookie dough (when warm). When making it I mixed the icing sugar and graham cracker crumbs in a little bowl first before adding it to the melted Peanut butter mixture, and it mixed together perfectly.  The first batch I did I let the mixture cool down just a bit in the fridge, then I used it. Tasted good,  but the peanut mixture was a little too crumbly in the chocolate.  So I put the rest of mixture in the fridge long enough to allow it to harden.  I then brought it out and let it get to room temp, and for the next batch I took some crumbly mixture, rolled it into a little ball in my hand, then flattened it and dropped it into the chocolate.  This made a much smoother texture to the finished product.  Overall they were very tasty...my husband loved them so much I had to hide them from him!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was terrific.  I used a pastry brush to set the chocolate in the mini paper cups.  This worked great.  I had a little of the filling and a little chocolate so I mixed it together in a little cermaic cup and put it the freezer.  It was like fudge.  Maybe I'll try that next.

These were a lot of fun to make and they turned out great.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that I thought the peanut butter filling was too sweet.  Maybe I'll cut back on the confectioner's sugar if I make them again.  I took another reviewers' advice and used creamy instead of chunky peanut butter and I liked the consistency.  Also, instead of keeping the paper cups in a stack to coat with chocolate, I used a mini muffin tin for support.  It worked great.

Wow!  These are amazing!! be sure to use a good quality of chocolate chip & they will taste professional.  I am a total failure when it comes to making candy, but these look and taste awesome! I cook & bake but ask me to do microwave fudge & I will run & hide!  This was the easiest candy, it takes a little patience but it is well worth the time.  These Rock!!!

My mother made these for a work party last night- I tried one this morning and it was delicious!  I've only recently started liking the combination of peanut butter and chocolate- I used to think it was a disgusting mix!  Eating these peanut butter cups ratified my decision to LOOOVE peanut butter and chocolate!  Thanks for the recipe.  I'm going to make some tonight!

OH MY GOODNESS! This recipe is amazing! I made these two days ago for my Dad. He kept going for more. Yesterday I made them for Finger Food Fellowship at my church (every last Sunday of the month) and someone asked me for the recipe! Do not hesitate to try this recipe. It's easy, fun, and absolutely delicious. I did not use graham cracker crumbs in this recipe and I did not use crunchy peanut butter.

Great recipe. Tastes just like store bought ones. Only thing I might do differently next time is leave out the 'shortening'. Being Aussie we do not have shortening and so after some research used our 'equivalent' which is butter, didn't turn out too good, chocolate was yummy once chilled however it was too greasy to work with. Next time I will just use chocolate melts on their own.

I used dark chocolate instead. I just "glopped" a bit of the chocolate in each cup, refrigerated while I made the peanut butter filling, with creamy pb, after filling I put the remaining chocolate on right away. The warm pb filling stuck to the chocolate better. Yum!!,

I should have read the reviews first :) There's some quick and easy tips on here for the chocolate and filling. I did find the method tedious with the paintbrush, but enjoyable at the same time. The one thing I would for sure do is cut back drasticly on the confectors sugar. Or eliminate. I am not experienced, but I found these awfully sweet, so much that it overpowered the peanut butter taste. I'd like to try and get the right texture simply with the graham crumbs and PB. I would try again and use the tips about rolling the cooled PB mixture into small balls and pack them in. Or penny size discs. I dont have fancy baking tools, so paintbrush it is for me! But I found that doing half of the cups at a time while leaving the chocolate on 'melt' setting worked well. End result is the family LOVED them. Just too sweet for me. :)

These are really good. I used parchment paper muffin cups - they don't stick at all. Also increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and added extra graham crumbs to make up for the extra PB. The graham crumbs give them a nice texture. Would be extra good with crunchy PB (I only have smooth).

These are absolutely dangerous! I'm going to give them away as gifts. I didn't have mini muffin tins, so I created 5 gigantic cups with the recipe as it. A half or even quarter of one is more than enough. I added graham cracker to the PB mix (as suggested) and it turned out swell.

Was delicious I did not have the confectioners sugar or shortening so Improvised with granulated sugar and margarine. I did not make little cups and in stead of chocolate chips I used crushed aero chocolate bar which I had laying around. Instead of tiny little cups I took this same recipe and made one giant cup by taking a small cake pan and lining it with parchment paper then doing the chocolate the same as suggested and the filling I used 1 whole small jar of peanut butter and a lot of aero pieces 3 cups full this tasted great would be better with confectioners sugar. Total process took about 3 hours including the chilling

YUM!! amazing recpe! 
A couple of things to change while making them: melt down about a half cup more of chocolate chips because I ran out of chocolate for the tops! 
also, I would suggest melting them in two batches because by the time you need the chocolaate to put on the top it's too hard to work with. 

when you're putting the tops on, I would suggest freezing the cups for about 3 minutes before you put the top on becuse otherwise it's hard to spread, and you can get a more professional look witht the chocolate if it's not all gooey. 

All in all I thought that this was a wonderul recipe and  it is alot of fun to make!!!! 
Thanks for reading!

I used creamy peanut butter because I don't like crunchy peanut butter. However--the peanut-butter filling is AMAZING. So creamy and perfectly sweet. Graham crackers add a perfect crunchiness and flavor. I also used dark chocolate because I don't like milk chocolate, and it worked just as well. FANTASTIC.

Wow....absolutely amazing!! According to my brother-in-law they were "the best thing he's ever put in his mouth". I tried what another reader suggested, by putting chocolate at the bottom & cooling, then rolling the dough into small balls and placing them in the center. I found that 1) the peanut butter mixture was very hot & I had to wait a while until it cooled, and 2) I needed more chocolate to completely cover the ball (not that more chocolate is a bad thing). I found that by following the recipe & coating the wrappers first made for the best looking cups. Took a bit longer but worth the wait. 

Also, the crunchy peanut butter adds a little texture to it- so, so, so yummy!! I would also make a little more chocolate just in case, so they're all nice & flat on the top.

This recipe was great! I used it for my anniversary and it was a big hit! the only problem I had was doing the first coat of chocolate with the first few. But other than that it was great! I would highly recommend it.

I made these for my husband for Valentine's Day.  He said they were the best present I've ever given him, which was totally worth the HOURS I spent making them.  My tips: Seal five whole graham crackers in a Ziploc bag and crush with rolling pin to get almost exactly 2/3 cup of crumbs.  Follow the directions carefully and your cups will be perfect!  The candy tasted best after being refrigerated overnight.

I've made peanut butter cups several times, always using different recipes. I assumed I'd like this recipe, with the graham crackers, better, because of the texture--but either I didn't crush the crackers finely enough or I don't like texture. They were a bit too gritty and unmixed-seeming for me. (In other words, I prefer the really simple recipes that don't call for graham crackers.) On a positive note, I used organic peanut butter (Adams creamy) and had no problem with runniness. I kept them in the fridge, though.

I thought this was okay and that is because of the ingredients I used. That is why I am giving it 5 STARS. I had honey graham crackers and think cinnamon would have made it better and used natural pb(the one with the oil on top), had I used the unhealthy pb I think it would have tasted better. I will try it that way and see. Thank u!

These are great and fun to make.  Like someone else suggested I made the chocolate in two batches (1 cup chocolate chips and 1 T. shortening in each). This way the chocolate doesn't harden before you use it for the top. I also took the same persons advice and made everything in the microwave.  1 min. then stir then another 30 seconds was perfect.  Instead of cups I used mini cup cake liners in the cup cake tin.  This worked perfectly.  They are just the right size and have the cute indents on the sides like the real candy.  Next time I would like to try using dark chocolate.

These are positively wonderful !   I used acrylic candy molds in the shape of small cupcake papers. This gave me 60 pieces of candy.  Easy to chill and then tap the molds, upside down, on a cookie sheet and they pop right out.

A lot of work but great! I used regular muffin liners so I doubled the ingredients to make really big gourmet style peanut butter cups. (which just one is too much at one sitting) I did use creamy peanut butter and a bottle squirter for the chocolate. I chilled the graham cracker a liitle bit too before putting them in the liners. And tapped them at the end to make them smooth.

Let me begin by saying that I am NOT handy in the kitchen, but this recipe was so simple to follow and the results were fantasic. I really couldn't believe how well they turned out and my boyfriend thinks I'm some sort of domestic goddess now. I microwaved the chips and shortening and followed other posters' advice by melting half the chocolate at a time and letting the peanut butter filling chill for a little while. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

This is one of the best recipes i have ever  tried off of this website. I brought the peanut butter cups to work and everyone loved them! They have a home made taste that doesn't scream of mass produced chocolate. ***** five BIG stars!

I was disappointed in these.  After reading all the rave reviews I thought this would be FANTASTIC and hubby would love them, since he loves Reese's.  Both of us agreed that these didn't have enough peanut buttery taste to them.   Not sure if I'll try them again making alterations to the recipe or just stick with my own concoction.  But anyway, thanks Kathleen for the recipe!

Excellent! These are so good that I caught my husband eating them for breakfast. Using the larger muffin cups makes the job less tedious and produces 10-15 cups.
Thanks for the recipe, Kathleen!

Tasted like homemade peanut butter cups.  They were all eaten far too quickly.  I followed the recipe as is save for using smooth peanut butter due to personal preference.

These were excellent, and a wonderful way to use up some leftover chocolate!  The graham crackers mixed in with the peanut butter is the proverbial cherry on top.   I left out the sugar because I didn't have any on hand and the peanut butter cups were still quite sweet enough for my husband and I.    Also, this recipe made me realize something: if you mix enough graham crackers with the peanut butter until it has a dry, crumbly consistency, it makes an awesome ice cream topping. :)

I used all natural peanut butter that had been sweetened with molasses, adding to that 3/4 c of confectioners sugar ( as to not make them overly sweet) and lastly using gingersnaps in place of graham crackers.  I enjoyed the peanut butter filling being flaky, contrasting the creamy chocolate.

I made the recipe as written and thought it was too sweet and not similar to the candy at all.  Getting past my expectations that they taste exactly like the storebought kind this was a tasty treat, but I remade them a second time with some alterations to the filling (less powdered sugar and a touch of salt) to make them more familiar tasting.  The use of crunchy peanut butter and graham cracker crumbs gives these great texture.

This is one awesome peanut butter cup recipe! I've tried some other ones but I like the graham cracker addition to it. When I don't have them, I substitute saltine crackers, it works just as well!

Terrific!  If you love peanut butter cups, you'll feel like you just opened a store-bought package when you taste these.  My mom and I made them the other day, and that was fun in itself.  We did run out of the peanut butter mixture with still three cups to fill (that was because our cups were slightly larger than the recipe called for), so we just substituted with a spoonful of peanut butter.  Those were good, too.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  It will be used again, for sure!

I was so enthusiastic about this recipe, and then pretty disappointed.  Really, the only problem I had with it is that the shortening mixed into the chocolate gives it that cheap 'mockolate' taste, like a discount chocolate Easter bunny.  If I make this again I will leave out the shortening because it definitely alters the flavor of the chocolate.  

That would probably mean that the chocolate would not harden without some time in the fridge, but I'd be fine with that.

They were good- the texture threw me off though. They weren't as creamy as I would like them. They were too gritty for my liking, but still good. Will try altering the amount of graham crackers next time.

Great ricipe! I did however make a change in the way to coat the peanut butter balls. I put a small amount of chocolate in the cup then placed the peanut butter ball then added more chocolate to cover.YUMMY

Fantastic recipe!  Proportions are exactly correct, we got exactly 30 amazing, wonderful treats.  Used a small teaspoon for the filling and tamped it flat in the cup.  We were considering how to store them, however since they are all gone.. its a non-issue!

This recipe tastes good but like some of the other reviews I do not care for the texture of the graham crackers.  I prefer the creamyness like most of the buckeye recipies.  With that bieng said, I followed the directions as recipe states & they turned out perfect.

So yummy! A friend had given me the vegan version of this recipe - which was still good, but not as good as this....amazing how adding a little butter improved the flavor and the crumbs gave it that perfect texture! I didn't melt the peanut butter mixture on the stove. It was at room temp and blended nicely, and it didn't seem to make a dif to the overall flavour or texture. Also, I added 1tbsp peanut butter to the chocolate. I just used the back of the spoon to spread the chocolate around. I stored mine in the fridge (but they didn't last long) and let people peel off their own wrappers as they ate them.

I wasn't a big fan of the chunky peanut butter.  I think next time I will use creamy peanut butter, but other than that, they were really good.

Absolutely delicious!! I made these with creamy peanut butter instead of chunky, and to save time I just put the chocolate on top instead of coating the cup.....Everyone loved them and thought they were great...they taste better than buying them from the store

We LOVED these! I used regular sized muffin cups to make BIG cups. I made the recipe as is, but next time (which is going to be really soon) I'm going to use 1/2 crunchy and 1/2 creamy to see what that is like. I also want to try all creamy as I will be making these a lot. PERFECT!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

yummm, these are really good, i use regular muffin papers cut in half.. they turn out great.. make about 17 if you like a salty sweet taste, use 1 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup powdered sugar and only 1/2 cup graham crackers.. trust me!this will give you a true peanut butter cup!!

Amazing! This recipe was very popular at my moms surprise birthday party. It is a long process but they turn out great. It is easier if you let the peanut butter filling cool before filling the cups. I also used creamy peanut butter, and used both milk chocolate and dark chocolate chips. Both were very good!I believe I got more than 30 from this recipe also!

These are perfect.  I used a mini muffin pan for stability, and it worked great.  I spooned the chocolate in, added a flattened ball of filling, and then spooned more chocolate on top.  I used dark chocolate chips for some of them with great results.  (That makes them healthy, right?)  I increased the chocolate chips to 3 cups and shortening to 3 Tbsp. and had enough for 48.  My grandma has made haomemade peanut butter cups for years, and I hope she's not mad, but mine will be better than hers this year!

3rd time is the charm! I am a baker and cake decorator, but do not normally make chocolates.  This does sound easy, but getting the correct amount of chocolate can be a bit tricky...it takes practice. I finally got it right on the 3rd time.  I used more than 1/2 tablespoon in my peanut butter cups in order for it to be the right mix of peanut butter and chocolate.  Using 1/2 tablespoon left them too chocolately.  I also had to use 3 cups of chocolate chips and 3 tbsp. shortening to have enough.  I would recommend reheating the melted chocolate before putting it on top of the pb mixture.  It spreads much easier.  I did also do this recipe with the chocolate candy coating (or almond bark).  It was a lot easier and tasted really good.  It was not quite as good as the milk chocolate, but we were still happy.  We also put broken pretzels in one batch...wow!

These were pretty good.  To me, something about the peanut butter centers wasn't quite right.  Perhaps too much powdered sugar?  I used a good dark chocolate candy coating instead of the milk chocolate + shortening, and I think this was an easy substitution which worked great.  Going to have to tweak them a little to get them just right!

These were really good, but I was very disappointed about how poorly this recipe was written.  Overall, they came out alright, but if I make them again, I will use creamy peanut butter instead of chunky.

WOW!  These are great. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use crunchy PB.  I crushed the graham crackers to almost powder consistency. I didn't think they were difficult at all.  I used the foil type 1 inch cups (found at most craft stores) and placed them in a mini muffin pan while I piped in the chocolate.  A helper is a great way to make it go fast.  Everyone agreed that these were better than Reese's (who would have thought that was possible). Thanks!

these were amazing, very tasty and I liked them with the milk chocolate.  I may try a dark batch too :) 
I increased the recipe by 1/2 so I'd have a full 48 (2 mini muffin pans).  I did run out of chocolate, so I will probably increase that a bit next time I make them.  I happened to have some extra chips on hand so it wasn't a big deal to melt more.  I'll probably also use a double boiler next time to melt the chips.

I am soooo mad.  It should say these are bite size pieces.  I ended up making 12 cups, all 12 got to the point of peanutbutter mixture in them, and I ended up with enough chocolate to cover 4 cups.  Now if this is a recipe for 30, there is something wrong.  I guess make sure you put that they are for bite size pieces..Im going to just throw everything away.  Also, I couldnt even find the papers that were suggested for this recipe...does anyone know where?

THIS WAS SOO EASY. I HAD MY SISTER DO THIS RECIPE FOR OUR ANNUAL COOKIE EXCHANGE. SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ALOT HARDER THAN WHAT IT WAS. EVERYONE WAS SOO IMPRESSED THAT SHE DID THESE. THEY WERE VERY VERY EASY. I'LL GIVE YOU A TIP: WHILE YOU DO THE COOKING FOR THIS OVER THE STOVE HAVE A HELPER (CHILD,FRIEND,SISTER) PAINT THE CHOCOLATE IN THE CUPS IT GOES FASTER THAT WAY.   I RECOMMEND USING THE SMALLER PAPER CUP CAKE MOLDS FOR THIS. IT'S THE PERFECT SERVING AMOUNT. UNLESS YOU DON'T MIND EATING A BIG ONE.  VERY PLEASING TO THE MOUTH.   THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE.  MY 3 GIRLS HELPED ME MAKE THESE ALSO.  WE HAD GREAT FUN!    
1 IMPORTANT TIP FOR YOU: IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE CHOCOLATE MELTED, ADD MILK A LITTLE AT A TIME TILL IT'S THE CONSISTANCY YOU WANT. WORKS GREAT!!!

very time consuming, but tasty.  I think its really important to use really good chocolate and peanut butter if you're going to take the time to make these, which I didn't do but will try next time.

Wow, these are great and pretty simple to make.  Don't make the mistake I made of using greased mini-muffin pans.  The chocolate remains in the pans even after dipping in hot water.  They are every bit as good or better than the commercial candy.  A definite repeat!

Fun project. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and they tasted great. I left the mini-muffin paper on because they had a Christmas design on them and it added color to my cookie plates. I put the paper cups in a mini-muffin pan and they turned out perfectly round and were easy to fill. Scrumptious. I got 36 out of the recipe.

Awful, awful, awful!  What a disappointment!  The filling in this recipe was so gross, it had a horrible, grainy texture... not at all like a peanut butter cup should be.  I followed the directions exactly, don't know where I went wrong.  The idea was so cute, too... we really wanted this to work out.

This recipe makes the best peanut butter cups I've ever tasted.  For those of us who don't like chocolate, try substituting peanut butter chips instead of milk chocolate chips - it turns out wonderful!

What a treat!!! Immediately made more to give as gifts (and to serve at Thanksgiving). I used natural peanut butter so they turned out best when I lightly sprinkled the tops with a little rock salt. And look good too.  For the chocolate sides, I just put some chocolate in the bottom and then tilted the little cup to coat the sides. No utensils needed. Found the quantities incorrect--the chocolate made 30 little cups, but I had excess peanut butter filling (for at least 12 more). So melted more chocolate and made more cups the next day. Really liked the suggestion to use the foil cups and loosen the top one but keep them stacked to keep their firmness when handling; they create a very crisp and pro-looking fluted edge.  Also followed the suggestion to make the choc in 2 batches - using 1 to create the cups' bottoms and sides and 1 to create the tops and sides. Worked well. 
(Note: don't put the peanut butter filling right to the edges so the choc you put on top runs downs and creates a substantial side.) Tried both the pastry bag and forming nuggets for the peanut butter - both worked equally as well. 
Will put in my favourite recipe stash!

This is am amazing recipe. I have done a few variations. Used the basic concept but used dark chocolate and white chocolate. Then I also used chocolate molds following the instructions. Each time following this outline they turned up amazing and were a hit every time.

I made this for my boyfriend with SunButter (he has a peanut allergy) and I found that all I had to do was add my graham cracker crumbs. I also found it easier to use liners with more structure.

I made these with dark chocolate, and they were fantastic! Next time, I will experiment with cutting back on the graham crackers as they had a somewhat coarse texture. I will also put them in mini muffin pans in the freezer until they set up to help them keep a nice round shape. My melted a little and spread out so they weren't as pretty, but this did not affect the taste.

Always just used confectioner sugar and the peanut butter, and it was always extremely sweet. never knew about the graham cracker crumbs.. I didn't use as much powdered sugar or butter as this recipe calls for. but it tasted exactly like reese cups. TY for posting this recipe. we did some with milk chocolate, some with candy melts, and some with dark chocolate. all were yummy.

Loved them.  Have made them twice already and will be making them again this afternoon.   Instead of painting the paper cups with a paintbrush, I put about a teaspoon in the bottom of the cup and then used then end of a wooden spoon and swirled it around to get the chocolate up the sides.  Seemed to go very  quickly.  I also used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate.

This is a really good recipe.  I made it in a pan to cut into bars instead of in cups and it was great.  I also used smooth peanut butter and sifted my crumbs several times because they never seem ground enough. Highly recommend it!

I thought the recipe would be a little different than the traditional ones I make, but when I started with the peanut butter mixture I knew it was going to be too much and just wrong.  Sure enough it was bland to say the least.  The chocolate should be noted to make 1/2 for bottom, then 1/2 for top.  Just all around wrong and bland taste.  Not even close at all tbh.

Oh so good ! On reading a number of reviews first, I noticed that many commented that this recipe makes more than 30. I followed the recipe and found the peanut butter mixture made 51 mini-muffin-sized delights, and there was enough chocolate to do them all with just a little "angel's share" left over. I had semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand, so that's what I used, and I melted them in a double-boiler to keep the chocolate workable during the entire process. I used crunchy PB and paper liners, and they peeled off fine later. Others commented on the length of time it took them to make these; it took me 2.5 hours to do these 51, from start to putting them in the freezer, and I wasn't rushing. Would definitely make them again.

We also used the Wilton dark chocolate melting it 30 seconds then stir. Also I don't use the graham crackers which as far as my children are concerned is simply the same as the ones you purchase at the store.

These were fun to make. I took the advice of others and melted the chocolate in batches. I only had the regular sized paper cups so I made them reese's-sized and they turned out great. I made these as part of my Christmas gifts for friends and family. Everyone loved them.

I used bittersweet chocolate instated of the chocolate chips. Smooth peanut butter, and the back of a teaspoon instead of a paint brush (didn't have one).
I made the cups inside chocolate molds- seemed easier than messing with paper cups!
Came out Amazing!!!

I'm not a fan of PB cups, but hubby and kids are, so I'm using their 5 star ratings!  I used half semi sweet chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips to sweeten up the semi sweet (I didn't have milk chocolate).

Haven't had a PB cup since forever---allergic to peanuts and am gluten free too.  I substituted 1/4 cup sunbutter and 1/4 cup almond butter and used GF 'graham' cracker crumbs and did them up pan style.  YUMMY!  I will make these again.

I had way too much peanut butter filling and had to make another batch of chocolate.  I cannot understand how people used the exact amount. Still a good recipe though.

These are so good! I used half the amount of sugar, they turned out perfect! Probably could have gotten away with even less. After I brush them with chocolate, I put them in the frige or freezer so they keep better shape. I will always keep this recipe!

These came out amazing! Aside from being a bit time consuming, they were very easy. I, too, had people say they were better than Reese's and I think I will be making them for all occasions from now on. I can't wait until I have another reason to make more!

This is the first time I attempted to make mini peanut butter cups, so I halved the recipe. I tried this recipe because I was in the mood to make some of those peanut butter cup cookies. I am giving this recipe 4 stars only because I made a couple changes to the recipe itself. I used creamy instead of chunky peanut butter and I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate because these are the items I had on hand. The peanut butter cups came out wonderful and I loved the filling. It has different proportions of ingredients than another recipe I usually use and the filling came out more delicious than the previous one I use. I will be trying this recipe again with the milk chocolate chips but they were perfect with semi-sweet. I never did get around to making those peanut butter cup cookies though cause these little gems got gobbled up quickly!

Tasted fine.  But the coated chocolate on the cups, melted easy.  Also, a lot of work, I wouldn't bother making again.

Home early today, blizzard outside.  Want chocolate and found this recipe.  Melted chocolate "bark" (what's on hand)in place of chocolate chips.  Definitely will make these again!  Can't wait for my grandkids to try these!

Excellent suggestion by previous reviewer to use squeeze bottle!  No mess and professional results!  My daughter and two nieces enjoyed making these assembly-line style with one squeezing chocolate, one rolling small peanut butter balls, and one pressing into cups. We whipped these out in no time and they look awesome and taste great too!

Oh my gosh!!!  We loved these!!  I had them at an open house and many many people asked for the recipe.  I did add more peanut butter and more butter because I didn't like the texture of the graham crackers.  I have a lot of mixture left over so its in the freezer waiting until I can get more milk chocolate!

These turned out even better than I had hoped. I also used the larger cups (couldn't find the mini ones) and made a double batch. I got 32 big peanut butter cups this way. Took a little bit of time to paint the cups but it was not difficult and the result is really worth the effort. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I have made this for several occassions - Christmas candy, kids school treats, Church party treats, and everyone raved!  They taste like ultra fresh reeses!  Pretty easy to make and so yummy.  I try not to make them too much because they are so tempting!

Both my girlfriend and myself are vegan (eat no animal products of any sort).  I made these with semisweet chocolate chips and margarine... so good...
Anyway, I am 22 and can't cook to save my life, but these turned out awesome... i have been wanting a reese's for years...

This was not what I hoped (expected them to be more peanut buttery), but my friends enjoyed them.
