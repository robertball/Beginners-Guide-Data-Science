This is an amazing recipe and definitely a staple in my house. I make it as part of a weekly meal plan so I use chicken from another recipe (Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style, definitely check it out). When I make the chickens I save all of the juices and use them in place of the commercial chicken broth in the this recipe. The chicken broth instead of milk is really what gives this recipe it's amazing flavor. Other than the chicken substitution I follow the rest of the recipe as listed. I really like the cavatappi noodles which are a hit with my picky eaters.

I reduced the cayenne pepper (hubby can't handle it) added some caramelized red onion about a 1/4cup milk and once everything was in my dish I drizzled some bbq sauce and added more cheese on top. Family loved it!

Very very good! I made it almost exactly the way it was described. My only substitutions were the type of pasta and chicken I use.  I also took the advice of a reviewer and put in a bit of an onion.

My family ate every single bite and was fighting over the last spoonful!  Plenty of flavor in this dish. I substituted the  white cheddar cheese with white bacon cheddar cheese and it just added that little extra flavor!
