I love Coddle.  We layer it in a slow cooker.  We layer Potatoes then onions, salt and Pepper, Sausages and then Bacon on top.  Then we pour Chicken Broth on top around 2 cups.  Let it cook all day.  My children and husband think this is the best cold day meal.

This wasn't that labor intensive at all. But 3 layers of layers, didn't do it in my 9x13 when I doubled the recipe for my family. I used a larger pan and divided the layers in to 2 layers of layers. I hope you got that ;-) I thought the dish was okay, not totally my cup of tea but it was okay. The stout was something that was a bit put off-ish in my book as well as my son's....but my husband and my 3 girls really liked it. I'll make again for them, but not for myself. However, if your a true guinness lover, then the recipe is totally for you. If you're not into guinness or don't have a liking for beer...then it's not. What I did like about the recipe, was the carrots and onions.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be wonderful! I made it a second time, minus the brew and used beef broth in stead. It too was great!

I have been making coddles for a while now, but this one takes the cake! The addition of carrots and finishing with cream are great touches. I did reverse the beer/bullion ratio; as much as a love a good stout, it seems a cooked stout is a touch too strong for our palates at home. Great recipe!

I made this for guests for St. Patrick's Day - everyone had seconds and said it was really good. I used Italian sausages as it was all I had on hand, and I think that was the key to the flavor. I know it's not very authentic :)  but plain pork sausages would have been too bland as others have said. We also grilled the sausages outside (because the weather was cooperating), and sauteed the onions in the bacon drippings before assembling (as I saw on another version of this recipe). Last tweak - about halfway through baking it looked like the top layer of potatoes was starting to dry out so I spritzed them with olive oil.

We found this recipe to be a HUGE disappointment and a waste of Guiness.  I couldn't even tweak it into tasting good.  The broth must be thickened or it's just soup, and the flavor left a lot to be desired.
Maybe it's because I love the Coddle at Gogarty's in Dublin, nothing else will ever be good to me?

Delicious!  I layered this in my crockpot: potatoes, carrots, onions, sausage and bacon on top.  Poured liquids in and cooked for 6 hours on high.  I substituted chicken broth and regular beer, served with rice.

I think that it turned out well, though there are a few changes I would make.  Next time I will omit the bacon, and add more sausage.  Once the coddle was all made the bacon had no flavor to it and felt like a waste of bacon, but the sausage still had a lot of flavor.  I will also add a little less Guinness.  I put the onions through the food processer before I put them in the dish and that worked well for us too. Aside from that this turned out really well.

We used smoked sausage links. I cut them up before I browned them with the bacon. We substituted an equal amount of beef broth for the stout too. I found that I had to stir it up a bit towards the end of cooking in order for the potatoes in the top layer to cook all the way. Also, there was quite a lot of thin broth/sauce. So I baked it about 20 min longer than was listed in the recipe. At first I was kind of dismayed but it turns out that it tastes incredible on bread and the kids and I just sopped it up. Honestly- I think I could have eaten just that broth and some rolls it was that good. This recipe was fairly easy- next time I will probably not layer it- just mix it all up and bake. Will absolutely make again, perfect for a colder day!

Wonderfully flavorful! I prepared as written using smoked sausage (mix of regular and turkey) and we loved it - tempted to lick the plate clean! I would suggest 1/4" slice on potatoes; mine were about 3/8" and it required longer baking time. Serve in a bowl with bread or rolls to soak up the delicious broth.

Love it!  I sauté all the veggies and meat ahead of time then mix it all up and put it in the oven for about a half hour.  I also use whole milk instead of cream, use apple chicken sausage and turkey bacon to cut down on calories.  Excellent!

Made instead with breakfast sausages, broken up bacon strips, and 2 cups beef broth instead of broth/beer; all 5 members of the family loved it, kids and adults!  Delicious comfort food on a freezing St. Patrick's Day.  Was more popular than the already well-loved corned beef and cabbage!

I made this last night, and I have to say, it was one of the best dishes i've ever made. 
I used Italian sausage in place of the sausage links, and I think that really added a nice kick to it. 
This recipe will be used a lot for sure! So glad I made this!

I added carrots, mushrooms and parsnip. I used less liquid and it was 50/50 broth and Guinness. Most importantly I cooked it for 6 hers in the slow cooker. Amazing, definitely a keeper.

Very good foundational recipe! I used chicken apple sausage and chicken broth. Based on reviews regarding the thin sauce, I made a roux with 3 tbsp. flour and 3 tbsp. butter then added heavy cream and broth but only 1/2 C of stout (so 2 C. liquid total) and thickened the sauce before adding to the layered casserole. I used a buttered 9x13 pan and everything fit fine. Put fresh minced parsley on top. I will make this again!

I made this tonight for a birthday/St. Patrick’s Day Party. Followed the recipe exacto on ingredients but put it all in the crockpot on high for 5 hours. I did use our own brewery’s stout and used Johnsonville brats bc that’s all they had at the store. I was a little concerned about the broth mixture bc it seemed *strange* but OMG it came out so good!! If you’re looking for a Coddle recipe you should make this one!

This was really good.  I subbed Tofurkey Kielbasa for the sausage and used Morningstar Farms soy bacon.  Did not have Guinness, so used Dragonsmilk stout instead.  Also subbed veggie boullion for the beef broth.  It came out great, not at all soupy like some of the reviewers claimed.  I think I got awesome Irish flavors in a modified vegetarian dish.  Will definitely make again.

This was really greasy. We could not eat it. Upset everyone’s stomach. Had good flavor. I cooked the bacon crispy. I think the grease came from the sausage. I will never make this again but I recommend if your family is used to eating healthy choose a lean sausage and cut it up first then brown it to cut down in the grease.

Great recipe. I had my doubts due to Guinness being about the only seasoning. Really enjoyed it and will make it again. But, I will try covering the dish for the first hour as has been said it other posts, the top potatoes dried out. To remedy this for this batch, I covered the dish and cooked it for an additional 30 minutes. I'll uncover it after the first hour just to brown everything. FYI, I used a mandolin to slice the onions on a thin setting, and the potatoes at the highest setting. Also, I used red potatoes as I felt they would be firmer than russets and especially gold potatoes. Also, full disclosure, I think I may have broken the sauce as I heated it up to much before adding the heavy cream. Loved it!

I did not make any changes but I did use Polish kielbasa sausage, which is good as well.  I am not sure if any one sausage is better than the other in this dish.  It is great for St Patrick's Day parties because you can make it in advance in the morning and then pop it in the oven 2-2.25 hrs before serving at 375.  Cover it for the first 2 hours with foil and then remove the foil.  I serve this with homemade beer  bread and honey butter.   It is always a hit!
