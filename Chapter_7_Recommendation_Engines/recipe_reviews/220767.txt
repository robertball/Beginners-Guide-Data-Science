I used my typical pie crust recipe.  Because I only wanted d1 pie, I used half of all the ingredients for the filling, except that I forgot to divide the ricotta cheese amount!  I used honey in place of the sugar.  I didn't think much of this as a dessert after a full meal.  Later, when I tasted it alone, I really enjoyed the light taste!  Great recipe!

This was great.  Followed recipe as written and served it with whipped topping and coconut.

I used this crust recipe and Fred Pelligrini's rice pie filling recipe and the pies were perfect!
Good crust for any pie.

I made these pies for Easter.
They were delicious, and I'll definitely be making them every year.

I made a few changes.  
I used a boxed Pillsbury Crust Mix.
I added about a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also topped them with whipped cream and toasted coconut.

My only complaint might be that the filling didn't come up high enough in relation to the crust.  Next time, I'll probably make more filling or use 8" pie plates instead of 9".  I'll also probably add about another 1/2 cup of pineapple.

This was delicious.  I halved the recipe and made one pie.  I added more liquid to the crust (milk) to make it easier to work with. I added some chopped cherries also. I'll definitely make this again.
