I eliminated the cooking step by using stewed tomatoes in a can.  I also used jalapeno instead of serrano peppers.  Topped with the juice from 1 lime.

Too much cilantro....this should have 1/4 C. Cilantro at the most!  Way too strong.

This salsa was good, but it much more resembled pico de gallo then salsa (only much more finely chopped than pico usually is).  It was still good, very simple and fresh, but after the inital tasting I did add lime, and my husband and I thought it was much better with the lime added.

OK, but I prefer salsa cruda rather than cooked salsas.

OK, fresh flavor and looks like real salsa.  
But it's missing something.

This was alright. I used jalapenos instead of serranos. My husband roasted everything on the grill instead of boiling it. I only used half the cilantro called for. This turned out an odd color and wasn't very appetizing looking, but still tasted fine. My husband thought it needed something maybe lots more garlic and something to give it more "flavor" he said. Very fresh tasting and a great change from the stuff in the jar.
