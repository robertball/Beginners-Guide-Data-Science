Made this for dinner, so good and easy. the only change I made was to slice an onion and lay it on the bottom of the pan then place the steak on top.and I used minced garlic instead of powder. will make this again.

i love this recipe. i have been making something similar for years except i use a cast iron skillet so that it can go in the oven in the same pan. great idea about adding some flour to thicken the gravy though i hadn't been doing that but it needs it

Being a Southern girl, I love just about anything "country-style" (fried and topped with gravy) and this did not disappoint. You will want more gravy (trust me on this one), so do as others have mentioned and double the retained seasoned flour and beef broth. I upped the ante and added half & half (cream or milk would work too) to the liquid mixture and the gravy was creamy perfection. One other note, check this after about 1 1/2 hours to make sure it is not sticking to the bottom of your pan. If it is, simply lift the pieces of steak to make sure there is gravy underneath them. Keep cooking for the full 2 hours for the most melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious country-style steak ever. Wonderful over mashed potatoes or rice. Fun fact: Leftovers (if you have any) make a delicious sandwich. A piece of cold steak with a little mayo between two slices of bread is heavenly.

Great recipe, my husband loved it.  I am not usually a fan of cube steak, but this was moist and tender.  I doubled the gravy by increasing the broth to a 32oz box of broth and then adding 5 Tbsp. of the flour mixture.  It turned out great!

This was delicious!!!!   I was looking for another recipe since the way I was making it the steak would sometimes be tough.  I was skeptical about the cook time but it was soooo tender!  I atleast doubled the gravy and added some water and milk as this was the way I would normally make my gravy.  My husband said it was the best country style steak he had had in his life!!!  Will be my new favorite recipe!!!

Little effort, HUGE pay-off.  I only made a couple of these cube steaks (with double the gravy), so one hour  in the oven seemed like plenty long enough, and it was.  I set the table with dinner knives but they weren't even necessary.  These were fork tender!  I found I had to thicken the gravy on the stove top when I pulled this out of the oven with a flour and water slurry, but that was no big deal.  I'm not sure I ever had cube steaks before tonight,  but  this recipe will compel me to buy them again.   This, served with green beans  and Mustard Mashed Potatoes, also from this site,  made for a perfect, not to mention easy,  make-again meal.

I grew up on this recipe in Eastern KY.  My Mother's secret, which she only shared with me, was to stir in a package of brown gravy mix 30 minutes before removing from oven.  It thickened the gravy and added wonderful flavor. It  will always be one of my family's favorites and a wonderful remembrance of my mother.

WOW! This recipe is great! The only suggestion I have is if you are making it with mashed potatoes it needs more gravy. Other than that, this recipe is fast becoming a regular in my household.

I was so excited to try this as it looked so good and got great reviews, but was very disappointed.  I followed the recipe exact and like another reviewer said the breading looked like mush from the gravy and we found the taste was rather bland.  It wasn't horrible but I don't see myself trying it again.

Great flavor! Next time I will double the gravy (at least) to allow more for topping mashed potatoes. I agree that mashed potatoes and green beans are the perfect side dishes for this comfort food!

All I can say is Im from the South and I will be making this for years to come. My husband loved it and so did his partner. They are police officers and i usually make them dinner since they work nights. So they don't have to eat fast food. All I can say is not only did even one at the station want there dinner they said I had to make it for everyone soon and drop off dinner for the station one night. I take that as a very good sign. I personally love this as well. Great recipe. Your mom Rocks!!!!!

I have only eaten cube steak like once in my life and have never made it before. This recipe had good reviews so I decided to try it. I thought it was pretty good. The cube steak was very tender with the slow oven roasting. And, the gravy had a nice flavor and consistency. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the black pepper, because I don't care for it. And, for the broth I used one beef boullion cube for the 2 cups of water. If I made again, I would like to cube my own steak so I can buy a leaner cut of meat and probably cut the oil in half. Thanks, interesting recipe.

This is exactly the recipe I have been looking for since my mom died 30+ yrs ago.  All her recipes disappeared from our house while we were at the funeral and I haven't been able to duplicate it.  I can't thank you enough..the seasoning is perfect!  Blessings to you for taking the time to post this!!

This was not good. I took one bite and couldn't eat any more. The breading/coating was mush from sitting in the gravy and the meat was not any more tender than pan frying. It also tasted really salty, just like straight broth. Bummer.

True Southern comfort food! This is the way my great aunt, who was born in 1898 in Indian Territory, made tough cuts of beef delicious and tender.  Thanks for posting this and keeping an heirloom recipe alive. It's the best!

Excellent recipe! I like my gravy really thick so i did a bit of a flour slurry when it came out (removed the steaks, took a couple teaspoons of seasoned flour mixed with some of the hot liquid (mixed in a cup) and then added back to the pan, then added steaks back)

We really enjoyed this steak. I was a little skeptical of the 2hr bake, but the meat was melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Not having any cube steak, I sliced part of a rump roast into steaks and went from there. I did use a skillet and just set the steaks aside while making the gravy in the pan, which worked really well, but I will either decrease the overall olive oil to just a light coating in the skillet or pour some off, as this made the gravy very oily (which seems so obvious now, of course). Even with my extra-greasy change we thought this was awesome, great flavor just as written, thanks so much for sharing.

I can't say anything bad!  So very easy to assemble and cook.  I did make 2x the gravy for potatoes and it was all eaten as well.  The meat was fork cutting tender and very flavorful.  After the first hour I had to leave home.  I turned off the oven and let it sit there until I came back about 1.5 hrs later.  Absolutely wonderful!  My son asked me to make it again tomorrow!

I love this recipe.  As others also have, I've tweaked it a little and slice a whole onion, add fresh mushrooms and double the beef broth and beef stock.   my family raves about this dish and it is as good as any I've ever tried.  I'm not sure why some say its mushy, except that maybe you are not frying it long enough or you don't have the heat up high enough. Because I've never had that problem.  Also make sure you use olive oil to fry the meat in. Better flavor for sure! I probably make this once a week but I pair it with rice, green beans and biscuits.  My family loves it and there are left overs for lunch the next day!

I coated the skillet with oilve oil - then added 1/2 cup cooking wine - to cut down on the 'greasiness'..
since this is a southern recipe I served it with cornbread stuffing  --- if you put it on top of your head its sooo good your tongue will slap your brains out to get to it!

This is a staple in our family.  I saute fresh mushrooms and onion when the cube steaks are half done.  When steaks are  done, add one can of French onion soup with one can of mushroom soup blend them well and pour over your steaks.  You can add more beef broth for more gravy to the soup mixture.  I find that I do not need to add any additional flour.  It does need mashed potatoes to soak up the gravy!

I was excited to try this because it sounded so yummy and I feed a family of boys. Let me first say that I followed the recipe exactly. Sad to say that mine turned out very dry and seriously over-cooked. I only left it covered in the oven for 1 hour. I will try it again, and I plan to change the pan frying time to less than five minutes per side. I will adjust the baking time to maybe 30 min., and keep checking until done. Thanks for sharing, I think once I can master the cooking time it will be great!

I made this today and loved it, Hubby devoured it. I did tweak it though. I used 2 lean cube steaks and put garlic powder and onion powder and lawrey salt on the meat and pressed it in. Dredged it in flour and used Pam Butter Flavor in pan and fried a couple minutes on high on each side. Used a bit smaller dish than 9x13, sprayed with Pam and layer with large onion slices. Using (no substitutes on this please very important) 2 cans Campbells Beefy Mushroom Soup, pour 3/4 can thinned with 1/4 cup water over the onions. Put the meat in and covered the meat with the rest of the soup. Bake covered at 350 for 2hrs. When done you can thicken the gravy (I didn't)I cut up the onions that were in the bottom and left it in the gravy, it was soooo yummy and plenty of it to go on the mashed potatoes. The meat was very tender and very high on flavor and so easy to make. Will make it often, even for Company.

This dish was very easy to make and came out delicious.  As another reviewer suggested I add some red onion during the baking, and used some beef broth in the gravy for a little added flavor.

Loved it! This was so simple and delicious, it was an exceptional meal. Had it with mashed potatoes and rolls. Just wished it would have made a little more gravy. Next time, maybe I will double the gravy. This recipe is a definite  keeper!

This recipe was so delicious I will make it many more times,You can use a cheap cut of tough meat and pound it good with a meat mallet and it comes out mouth melting,browed it and put in oven at 350 for 90 minutes.I cant believe some ratings said it was bad,it wasnt the meat it was the cook that screwed it up to make it bad.

I've been eating country-style steak my whole life, and this is the perfect way to make it. You can also simmer it on the stovetop for about an hour if you don't want to turn on the oven. Perfect with homemade mashed potatoes, but you will want to make extra gravy!

I love this. After putting the meat in the baking dish I cover it with a couple of onions sliced thin and about a pound of sliced mushrooms with additional salt and pepper for the veggies. I double the amount of gravy and pour it over the top of everything. Great for an every day meal or even for company.

Really good family enjoyed it. I added a bit more spice but that's a personal preference. Would make it again based on the ease of making and the family raves about how yum it was.

This is an awesome recipe.  The meat comes out so tender you can cut it with a fork.  I usually have to add extra beef broth to have enough gravy, but this is definitely a once a week dish at my house.

THE BEST!  I've hated cubed steak all my life and growing up in the south it was something I had to choke down fairly often.  It was always tough and gristly and the gravy was thick and globby.  My 10 year old loves cubed steak and begged me to make it so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I never in a million years thought I'd bee cooking cubed steak, let alone eating it myself.  This recipe is GREAT!  It was so tender and the gravy was perfect.  My family said it was "the best!"

This was very good and tender. My husband won't eat cube steak unless it's tender, so this was a great option. Remember to grease the baking dish, or put some gravy down before putting the steaks in. I didn't think about it and we lost the bottom coating of our steaks. I will be making this again!

I grew up on a dairy farm in Central Texas.  We had cubed steak (chicken fried steak) cream gravy, mashed potatoes and green beans very often.  First of all my Mom fried the steak in bacon drippings and then cooked them in a pressure cooker for a few minutes.  She used the drippings in the pan to make cream gravy (make a roux but don't brown it, then add milk until desired consistency).  Us kids peeled the potatoes and snapped the beans.  Fresh butter made from the cream from the dairy.  Fresh yeast rolls and peach cobbler from our orchard.  OMG it was a delicious dinner.

Good basic recipe.  I'm a southern girl also.   I've been making something similar for years,   but use my crockpot instead and double the time on low (or more depending on how easy a fork goes into the meat). (using the crockpot means it doesn't heat the house up in the summer)  Also,   I put sliced onions on the bottom so the steak doesn't sit directly on the pot.  But by the time it is done,  the onions are melted in the gravy.   I use half the amount of the seasoned salt OR use a salt free seasoning for steak.  Thanks for posting.

Yummy and inexpensive! I took the advice of other reviewers and added a sliced onion to the bottom of the pan and doubled the gravy. We have a freezer full of cube steak so I will be making this again!

Thank you so much for this recipe. My husband doesn't typically like cube steak because he says its tough meat. This was so tender you could cut it with a fork. It was absolutely wonderful. Definitely a winner in my house!

I made this for my father--Mr Meat and Potatoes.  He loved it.  I changed it a little to make preparation a breeze.  I cooked it in the crock pot on low for 8 hours. I added a thinly sliced onion but I didn't pan fry at all and left out all the olive oil and flour during cooking.  I thickened the 'gravy' at the end using some flour.  Served over brown rice.  Delicious!

i use this recipe all the time. My husband really likes the gravy so I always make extra. I  usually make a recipe and an 1/2 at least, some times more. The only thing I do is put the broth & flour mixture in the pan I brown the meat in and start the gravy than pour it over the meat & put it in the oven. great recipe. Also I have been using this site for several years. it is great! Thanks

At our house we always used round steak cut into pieces, coated with flour mixture, browned and top with sautéd sliced onions  and mushrooms (when on hand) cover with water or broth.  Have also thrown in carrots and red skin potatoes.  Yum Yum!

I have been making this for years, but I add onions to it. To the person who complained that the breading was mushy I think she used to much flour and expected "Country Fried Steak". This is more like Swiss Steak without the tomatoes.

Nummy!  I don't see a reason to dirty both a pan and a baking dish.  I browned the meat and baked in the same pan, tastes better too to have the brown bits (fond) in the gravy.  I seasoned using steak seasoning, very happy with that. Don't need that much flour for coating. Sauteed mushrooms were an addition that worked perfectly, I recommend it. I started checking the meat after an hour since I had two small steaks, but turns out I still needed the full two hours for the meat to get tender. Such an easy way to get a very satisfying meal.

An incredibly simple and delicious recipe. I buy pre-tenderized cube steaks from the local grocer which yields an even more tender steak. Also sliced a medium yellow onion into ¼ thick rings and layered them in the pan under the steaks. Served with red & yellow mashed potatoes and fresh vegetable medley.

Excellent recipe!
Only change I made was since there was lots of browned goodness left on the fry pan, I put some sliced onions in it after removing the meat and deglazed with a little of the broth before I stirred in the flour. Cleaned the pan and gave lots of flavor! Then I layered the onions in with the steaks an followed method exactly.  It was absolutely delish!!!

WONDERFUL! - the step of baking is what makes this perfect.  I have floured and breaded cube steaks and pan fried, my method though called for pounding out the steaks prior to breading so that they'd be tender.. sometimes successful, sometimes not. this method is fantastic, no pounding and tender out of the oven,.. and the gravy - YUMMMMY!

I have been making this recipe for years, except I usually simmer the steaks in a skillet on top of the stove, covering the skillet with a lid. I like to make the steaks if we are going on a trip, place the steaks between two slices of your favorite bread or buns and add your condiments and you have a healthier, tastier "burger" to go. Oh, I forgot I don't use the flour if I am making these burgers so the gravy isn't thick and doesn't stick to the meat.

A great simple recipe! I don't understand the two hours. One hour is plenty. It will be fork tender. I cook pork chops, 1" thick, the same way, and they melt in your mouth after one hour.You can also put them on a small metal rack to get them off of the bottom. Thanks!

Tender and tasty. I like that it makes it's own gravy. I do uncover it and let it crisp up a bit tho so it's not soggy.

A lot of flavor, very tender. I took the advice of others & doubled the recipe to increase the amount of gravy. Tasted just like the southern style steak & gravy my mom used to make.

Great recipe!! I have a picky three year old and he almost ate his whole patty.  I used sirloin tip patties and they were melt in your mouth.  Did place an onion in the bottom of my pan and added more broth!  Will definitely fix again.

It turned out okay on flavor but there was almost no gravy as it all dried out. I did follow the recipe exactly. Perhaps a lower temperature would work better.

Hubby loved it.  We both like mushrooms so I topped them with fresh sliced ones after pouring the broth over the steaks.

This recipe was delicious. The only change I made was to season the meat  before coating it in the flour with the seasoned salt, pepper , and garlic  powder to add more flavor. I also followed the advise of another and placed slices of onions on the bottom of the pan to prevent the steak  from getting mushy. I was pressed for time so I only put in the oven for 1/2 hour because the kids and husband were so hungry they could not wait 2 hours. It was still moist and very tasty!

Appreciated the fact that the gravy made itself.  This came out melt in your mouth tender..and...So tasty.  Prepared as directed except for doubling the gravy, adding 1/2 of a sliced onion and d a bit of diced green pepper.

This recipe is easy and delicious!  As others have stated, I used 3 cups of broth to have more gravy.  Added sliced onion to the bottom of the pan and on occasion add sliced mushrooms.  Easily one of my favorite recipes.

Well, photo of this dish looked great... nice looking rich gravy!  I baked it at 300, being nervous about 350 for 2 hrs, and although the steak was nice and tender,  the gravy was pasty looking, tasting,  and had no flavor.   We were fighting for the S & P!  I was glad I seasoned the meat before I floured them.   If I ever make this again, I'll add way less flour to the broth and season it  well before pouring over the meat.  A bit disappointed after the long bake time.

The gravy was good I doubled it. I will not be making this again. It smelled  so good while cooking I totally thought it would be awesome but was very disappointed. I am giving it 2 stars for the gravy.I followed the recipe as is but made more gravy. The cubed staked had no flavor at all.

I gave it five stars earlier based on the gravy alone. This is a KEEPER!  I told my fishing buddy about it and he want the receipt to impress his wife
( I USED PORK STEAK AND CUT IT UP INTO BITE SIZE PIECES)  Cook time hour and half. You must double broth, check every half hour.THANK YOU!

My father has made this cube steak recipe for 20 yrs. Was a staple in our home every Sunday. There are couple changes we do. Use an iron skillet and put some oil in the bottom of skillet to brown steaks. I know we don't use near the 1/2 Cup of oil as stated in recipe. After all steaks are browned we place all steaks back into the skillet and put in beef broth cover with lid and cook on top of stove for 
2-2 1/2 hrs on low heat don't boil hard just a nice simmer. This way your not heating up the whole oven and the smell is incredible. Remove steaks and add your flour and make your gravy which is to die for. My husband says "Its so good it should be listed as its own food group".

This is a different way to make cube steaks.  I was so excited because there isn't much you can do with them.  I followed the recipe pretty much except I thought 1/2 cup of olive oil was a little much so I probably used half of that.  Also made sure I coated them in the flour mix VERY well.  Then followed the rest of the recipe.  They came out beautifully.  No problems whatsoever.  I will say that I can understand why some thought these were bland.  Not totally but they do need that special something.  Next time I might try to add some rings of onions to the baking dish.  Just 3-4 maybe.  Or add some Worcestershire sauce.  They were really good but I did notice the lack of "flavor" not spices because there were plenty.  Definitely a keeper.  They weren't dry at all and not soggy like some reviewers said.  Not sure what happened with their recipes.  I used a 13x9 glass baking dish also.  Thank you!

Made this for dinner tonight. It was amazing. Followed some of the other reviewer's advice and placed onions under the steaks before putting them in the oven. Also, I used beef broth but also one can of Beefy Mushroom soup. This was really great and will definitely be making it again!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Too much flour and I did not use that much oil, just coated bottom of cast iron skillet so I could put in oven after frying the steak.  Definitely need to double the gravy.

It was so so, kind of bland and tasted more like meatloaf, which takes a lot less time to bake.  Would not make again.

Great recipe, my wife and I really enjoyed this. I think next time I will only cook it for 1hr 30 min. it came out a little dry but very tender still very good. I added a bed of onions to the bottom of the roasting dish and put the meat on top.

Good recipe as written but I went back to my old way for convenience sake.  I follow the recipe until the broth/flour  for the gravy.   I use the beef gravy that comes in a glass jar and pour that over the fried meat before I put it in the oven.   I always have several jars of gravy on hand and can use as  much as I care  to.

I made this last night for a couple of friends that are wonderful cooks.  They enjoyed the meal, and wanted the recipe.  It was very good, but the reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is so easy.  I may try this in the crock pot.

A very good, basic steak and gravy recipe. I did a slight variation on the instructions, using the flour with the remaining oil in the pan to make a roux, then thinning it with the broth to make a gravy before I poured it over the steak. I doubled the whole thing--but the second pound of meat was stew chunks rather than cube steak. Also took it out of the oven about 20 minutes early. Everything worked just fine. It was tasty and worked well. Next time I would add onions as a few other recipes mention, and I might try a few herbs too just to foodie it up a bit. But this is an excellent stick-to-your-ribs entree. Just go lighter on the oil if you can, make sure to trim the fat from any meat you include, and don't be afraid to take it out a little early if you're starving.

I am sure this could be done on the stove top as well as other recipes mention, especially for the original recipe quantity.

Fabulous! I substituted  french onion soup and chicken broth, instead of beef broth. Cut away all fat and gristle and it was fantastic. Poured over rice is a fabulous beef tip type recipe. My husband ran out and bought more french onion soup so I could make another the next day!

I suggest you go ahead and save yourself some time and double this recipe. My hubby and son gobbled it all up, when I had plans for this to cover two meals. I followed the advice someone made by layering the steak on top of sliced sweet onions. Before battering, I also pierced each steak several times with the point of a steak knife to ensure tenderness. I sprinkled just a light coating of seasoning salt before adding the beef broth and seasoned flour mixture. This will definitely be added to my “what’s for dinner” rotation.

I made this twice and it was good. I added minced garlic, not powder, and onions. it was a bit bland, but the steaks came out tender and tasty.  the second time I subbed 1 can Golden Mushroom soup, and 1 cup broth, browned the steaks and put them in the pressure cooker for 1 hour. AWESOME!! so easy to make and you can slow cook them or pressure cook for a quicker dinner. thanx for sharing!

I have been making country fried steak for years but I always fixed it in a skillet on the  stove top. If time permitting this is the way to go it was so tender and delicious . Definitely double the amount of broth and adding a packet of brown gravy mix and mushrooms  made this recipe a five star in our house.

made this 6/1/15 for dinner. grrrrrrrrrrrrr. 
Oven TIME is wayyyyyyyyyyyy off. 
No more then an hour @ 350.  
Flavor was good and I can only imagine how good it would have been. 
Very easy to prepare.
Suggestions;
double the gravy (at minimum)
Reduce cooking time, and check progress @ 45 min.
I will make this again with a change of oven time.

Slice an onion and lay it on the bottom of the baking dish.  Place the steak on top.  Use minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Double the gravy by increasing the broth to a 32 oz. box of beef broth with 5 Tbsp. of the flour mixture.

this recipe right here is a absolute must to keep in your rotation especially in the cooler seasons it a great comfort food and relatively inexpensive. I gave it 5 stars even though I added minor additions but as is I'm sure it would of came out just as divine. I reduce the seasonings for flour dredging because I wanted to add a little onion soup seasoning to the broth and flour mixture and that really gave the gravy flavoring some depth. The meat was very tender yet still moist of course you want to double the sauce to have a enough to drizzle generously over meat and your side (pair with mash potatoes) I also added some fresh sliced mushroom to the gravy. yummy stuff.

Great taste.  The meat was so tender, you could cut it with your fork.  Too much flower, a lot left over and I cooked 1.5 pounds of meat.  I would double the gravy so you have some for mashed potatoes. The gravy was delicious!  Will keep this in my favorites.  Yum!

My husband and I just finished eating this. It was the best cubed steak recipe by far that I have made. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was pretty good.  I'll make it again.  The meat came out so tender we didn't even need to use a knife.  I might consider doubling the gravy.  I appreciate the simple, uncomplicated ingredients to get a nice dinner on the table.

I made this with venison steak & venison chops that had to get eaten up and it was absolutely fantastic!  I added sautéed onions and mushrooms because we love them and thought it would be a great addition! I was hesitant about the amount of time in the oven but it was perfect!  I couldn't believe how tender it was and the flavor was to die for! My boyfriend took one bite and he said "Omg, don't lose this recipe"! LOL Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  We have a cafeteria in town that makes country style steak to die for; this tops it by far!  Am throwing out my other recipe putting this in my "special" book of to-die-for recipes.

I doubled the gravy and put onion and sliced mushrooms under the meat.  The gravy was really good and didn't disappear at all while cooking.  I wasn't happy with the meat; I thought it bland and overcooked but I'm not a cube steak fan normally, just thought this would be different.  Probably won't make again but will keep making gravy this way in mind, It was good and easy.  Thanks.

I have never fixed cube steak this way and it turned out great.  The aroma coming out of the oven was delicious and it tasted just as good as it smelled. My husband and I both loved it - very tender. Next time I will add more broth so we can have more gravy.  Easy meal to make for the two of us.

It's very good, I reduced the salt slightly by adding 1/2 tsp of seasoned salt. As Kat suggested, I will add onions next time.

My family loved it!  My husband actually said "this is a keeper."  The gravy was delicious, good flavor and not too strong.  I actually used elk meat and have never had it come out so tender.  I did not cook the meat for 5 minutes per side though, just for 5 minutes total.
Thanks!

Overall a very good dish. I would season the actual cube steak first before placing it in the flour. I also added onions to the gravy. I will be using this recipe again.

Followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the gravy and using about 1/2 the amount of pepper (we're not fans). 5 stars for flavor, ease and the basic concept.  The leftover gravy stayed solid, paste-like, when reheated. I'll definitely be making this again and using some of the great suggestions here, and we'll see what can be done about that solid gravy!

I made this recipe using the hint from another reviewer.  I put sliced onion under the meat.  Without that it really wouldn't have much taste at all.  My Aunt Rose's recipe for Salisbury Steak is much more flavorful.

I know that altering a recipe as written and then submitting a review based on those modifications irritate a lot of you.  Having said that, sometimes you recognize that the recipe's concept is sound but also realize it can be improved.  This was one of those recipes and it is one of the best Salisbury steak recipes I have ever made; I will be relying on this version from now on.  My personal modifications include:  following the suggestion of one reviewer, I  placed onion rings in the bottom of the pan on which the steak roasted.  I used thin-cut sirloin slices and tenderized them with a meat mallet before dredging them in the seasoned flour. I also sautéed mushrooms before making the sauce that went over the steaks.  Lastly, I roasted the covered pan in a slow oven (325) for an hour.  The result was the most tender and flavorfull beef steak my husband and I have ever had at home.  The gravy over mashed potatoes was wonderful!  Love this recipe!

This has to be the best cube steak I have ever had. I couldn't use garlic because I am allergic to it so I used season salt. I promise w the two salts it wasn't too much as I never eat salt either.  The pie plate I used I bake it was full of about 3/4 of an onion. I put the cube steak on top and then the gravy. It has amazing flavor and so tender! U made my day with this recipe!!

Followed the recipe to a T and used quality ingredients but this was terrible.  Bland and mushy.  The only redeeming quality was that the cube steak was tender.

I have trouble making a smooth gravy, so instead of whisking in the flour I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the broth.  It made a perfect gravy, and the dish was delicious!

Gave it 4 stars because of the ingredients.  I have been making cube steak this way for over 50 yrs & learned this from my mother who had been making this since I was a child.  The only thing is you don't have to put it in the oven for 2 hrs.  I sauté  sweet onions, mushrooms in butter & canola oil or avocado oil.  I salt & pepper the cube steaks then flour.  I add to the frying pan & brown well on both sides.  Add the onions & mushrooms.  I start out with 2-3 cups of very hot water that I add to the pan bring to a boil cover & lower to simmer.  Cook for 30-45 mins depending on the on how tender you want the steak.  You may need to add water so it doesn't dry out & have a great sauce.  That's it.  Serve with mashed potatoes & your favorite veggie.  My children & grand-daughter request this dish from because it's one of their comfort foods.  They have the recipe but state mine turns out better for whatever reason.

This is the way this Alabama girl was taught to make steak also, except I do not put the steak in the oven.  I return it to the pan with the gravy and simmer it until it is very tender.  Sometimes I use onion as another person suggested.

This recipe is fantastic.  You can also make this right on top of the stove if you want to. After your pour off excess oil, slice up an onion and saute it in the pan drippings.  You can then add WATER or broth (mixed with a little flour or cornstarch) to the pan.  Scrape the bottom of the pan to mix in the browned bits from the bottom, add the steaks back to the pan. Cover and simmer.  From a bona fide country girl.  Suwanee.

Awesome recipe.  I also added an onion to the bottom of the pan and doubled the gravy.  I put it in a cast iron pot in the oven.  Very good comfort food!

Delicious!  Made these for hubby last week but he insisted that he didn't want me to braise the steaks in the gravy so I just flipped the steaks an extra time, making sure they were cooked through, and served the gravy on the side with mashed potatoes and a garden salad, kind of like chicken fried steak but without the extra breading.

I reheated the leftovers immersed in the gravy in the oven as in the original instructions and they were even better than when freshly fried.  I do not expect him to object to the original method again.

This is by far the best country fried steak I've ever eaten! Everyone I've made this for practically licks their plate clean. It is absolutely delicious and I will never make my steaks any different again. They are so tender and juicy that you can cut through them only using a fork...so good!

This is a great general recipe; you can tweak it any way you like! I started with using the triple-dip method for dredging the steaks instead of just flour. First was a coating of seasoned (salt, pepper, and garlic powder) flour; next, a brief dip in egg wash (egg beaten with a little water); then, immediately into seasoned (rosemary and thyme) panko. The next change was one suggested by many of the reviewers here: a layer of sliced onions underneath the steaks in the baking pan. For the beef broth, I used some of the Better Than Bouillon reduced-sodium beef base (I've had a ton of success with many of their jarred base products. You only have to mix it with hot water and it keeps for practically forever.) Also like many other reviewers, I did not bake for the entire 2 hours. Mine were done around the 1 1/2 hour mark. They were great! Tender and not mushy at all. We've even made them a second time! With that we wanted more gravy but when I doubled the flour/beef broth mix, the steaks turned into mush. My recommendation would be stick with the gravy ratio listed in the recipe and make any additional gravy you want on the side.

After reading a dozen reviews I HAD to make it. it was even one of the "daily recipes". As usual, for me, I made it exactly per the recipe. I'm not sure I get it ..... really mediocre.... just OK. The "gravy" never really thickened up with the casserole dish covered in aluminum foil. My wife said it was typical of meals she had growing up in Ohio. In brief ....... I won't be making this again with so many better recipes out there. I can't recommend this recipe.

Yummy and so tender, you don't need a knife! Next time though, I'll add more beef broth as there was barely enough gravy to cover the cube steaks, certainly not enough for mashed potatoes or rice! Seasonings are spot on!

Good comfort food!  Wasn't much gravy left after cooking for 2 hours, so if you are wanting gravy, double the beef broth mixture.

I made this for dinner two nights ago. I used 4 pieces of cube steak and added a little paprika and Thyme (maybe 1/4 tsp.) to the seasoning flour. I browned the steaks thoroughly in 1/4 C. olive oil, then stirred in the remaining flour from breading the steaks, and slowly added the beef broth, stirring constantly. It was very thick, so I added some additional water. I baked it at 350 degrees for about 1-1/2 Hr. It was very tender, but the gravy was much thicker than I prefer. In the future I will not use all the flour for the gravy. There was plenty to pour over the mashed potatoes I served alongside.

I made this last night along with Fondant Potatoes and Arkansas Green Beans, all from AR. The only thing I did different was to sauté my onions and mushrooms before making the gravy and put my steaks in afterwards. I also did it all in my dutch oven. Thanks for the recipe, hmclaurin, they were very tender and good!

I loved this recipe ,Ive only had cube steak once and found it tough and rubbery, after trying this I will continue to make this over and over ,One thing I have to say is you have to spice your food , I used some dry tyhme in the broth and salt and pepper  I also  added paprika to the flour and threw some garlic powder in the gravy as well.I also put the steaks on finely chopped onions...yummy....

I have never commented on a recipe not have I ever cooked cube steak but this one is much deserving. This was delicious! My only change was to use low sodium broth and I also added onions on top.  Mmmmm Mmmmmm good! Thanks for the recipe.

I've been making this forever, and my mom before me. We saute an onion in oil after browning steaks. We don't bake it, but simmer covered on top of stove, so it doesn't take 2 hours. The onion adds lots of flavor. Add seasoned flour just before serving to thicken. I also add worcestershire. My family loves it.

Made this as written but increased the gravy ingredients.  I used 3 cans of broth and 6 T. of the seasoned flour.  This was easy and the meat came out very tender.  My husband liked this so I will be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Scrumptious, simply delicious! My husband is not a huge cube steak fan and he was all but licking the plate after he ate this! I followed the recipe and directions as written with the exception that the gravy was not as thick of a consistency as I like - I prefer a thicker gravy - So I added a pinch or two of cornstarch to thicken the gravy up and it was PERFECT. I also used more beef broth than was recommended in recipe per the results of previous cooks below. Always read the reviews - very helpful! But if you're a new cook and don't like to tweak things here and there, then follow this recipe to a "t" and it will still be a success! A month later and my husband is already asking for them again!

I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 3 because the flavors were good.  but the recommended cooking time is either WAY too long, or the temperature too high.  Mine turned out really overdone and there was no gravy at all, it was more like sludge burned on the bottom.  Next time, I will decrease temperature and double liquid.

This recipe is so very delicious!  I was fed tough, pan fried minutes steaks as a kid.  It took me years to want to even see another one, let alone eat one.  Now that we purchase a 1/4 beef, I have more beef cube steak than I know what to do with. This recipe is one of the best I've found.  Since others had suggested onion, I used a sweet,yellow onion cut into rings on the bottom of the baking dish.  I used left over broth that I had saved in the freezer from cooking a roast.  The broth had the liquid smoke flavor (I used in the roast).  The onion just kind of cooked away and  became part of the gravy.  As others have suggested I would have added more broth to make gravy if serving with mashed potatoes.  I baked it covered for two hours.  It was fork tender and beyond delish!  So easy to make too.  It wasn't greasy or dry as some reviewers experienced. I served it with new potatoes and green beans from the farmers market.  Yum!

I discovered this recipe on allrecipes.com in March 2011.  I have made it at least 4 times and my entire family LOVES it.  What a great way to prepare an inexpensive cut of meat.  The only change I have made is to increase the beef broth to 3 cups and adding just a bit more flour to it.  You will want lots of this delicious gravy.  Serve with mashed potatoes.  100% comfort food!

This was a winner.  A little labor intensive but well worth it!!  I did double the gravy for the veggies (steamed carrots) and mashed potatoes.  It was very tender...melt in your mouth tender.

I ditched the pre fry and put the cube steaks in oven raw with the gravy. Otherwise make sure you get them crispy to avoid sogginess as other have stated.

I was looking for a good country FRIED steak recipe when I came across this, thinking it was for country FRIED steak.  It is not.  (I should have known better when there weren't any eggs in the ingredient list lol).  Nevertheless, I followed the recipe to the T and, although I was disappointed that it wasn't country fried steak, it still tasted great.  Best of all, my children liked it too.  It tasted like salisbury steak.

Really good. Used two beef boullion cubes to make the broth and omitted the seasoning salt so that it wouldn’t be too salty. Added sliced onions.

My go to recipe now for cube steak. I omit the garlic powder and use whole wheat flour because that’s what I consistently have on hand. I use a large cast iron Dutch oven with a lid. Always delicious!

I don’t know how to rate this recipe since I’m new to cooking and my steaks came out stuck to the bottom of the pan and the gravy was also almost burned onto the bottom of the pan. I’m so disappointed because I started the recipe late and was exciting to try my first recipe and failed marvelously.

This is the first time I've ever given a bad review. The three stars are because it was mediocre at best. I'm a good cook. I always read the reviews before deciding how to proceed. I took the suggestions of doubling the gravy (it still wasn't enough; can't even imagine the original recipe...) and layered onions on the bottom of the baking dish.
After an hour I added some sauteed baby bellas and minced shallot to the sauce, which came out fine.
Two hours was about half an hour too long. But the hubby was running late anyway so I just went with it. The steak wasn't dry, but it was less tender than advertised. Now at least I know why I've never used cube steak. It tasted like a cheaper cut of meat, but at $4.69 lb. I could have bought ribeyes or T-bones for $4.99.
It would have been simpler to just make Milanesa (Mexican chicken fried steak) considering the prep time involved. If I ever do make this again, I'll use round steak and tenderize it myself. Other than the gravy, which I could have easily made, this was a less than inspiring entree.

Enjoyed making this recipe.  Easy to make. Next time I make this I will use less flour. My gravy came out looking like pudding, but tasted good on my potatoes.

This is great. I never had Country Style Steak this way. The minute steaks was tender enough to cut with a fork. This is the only way I will cook country style steak in the future. Only thing I did different, I used Heinz Bistro Au Jus Gravy. Thank You for sharing your moms recipe.

Once you put the steaks into a baking dish, make onion and mushroom gravy.  Put the chopped onions and shrooms into  hot drippings and sprinkle leftover flour on top then stir-fry. Add broth and stir until simmering and thickened.  Pour over your steaks, seal foil over top and bake.  Original recipe is good, but why not fancy it up ?

Fantastic dish - super easy and tasty. Would make a 'non-chef' look like a genius. 

The girls love this one - especially the gravy.
I jazz it up a little - some Montreal steak spice or Trader Joe's seasoning. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!!!  I used hamburger patties since we didn't have cube steak.  I did season the patties with garlic, pepper, salt, and paprika.  I also added a packet of brown gravy mix to the beef broth.  This was sooooo good!

The best cube steak recipe ever! Made numerous times, but with venison. One of my husband's favorite. I like to add mushrooms to my gravy, and of course I double  the gravy.

My husband has wanted me to learn how to make this for years.  I FINALLY found this recipe & it is delicious & mostly for me EASY!!  Only question I have is, what do you use the 3 tablespoons of seasoned flour for?  Didn't see any instructions in the recipe.

I made this for dinner and it turned out great 
I to lived in Texas for thirty years and most of my friends used country gravy and deep fried their breaded steak but Brown gravy is good to.My husband loved both ways.

We really loved this dish.  I added more garlic powder and made more gravy.  Plus I followed another reviewer's advice about placing a sliced onion under the meat in the 9x13.  This was so yummy, I will be adding it to our regular meals.  Also could definitely be used when you have company too just make egg noodles or mashed potatoes, green beans, and a salad and you can feed more people.

I made this by the recipe.  The gravy was good, but the meat was very bland.   Next time I will add more seasoning to the meat--directly on meat before covering with flour.  I will make the gravy in the drippings from browning the mean and add seasoning there also.   We do line savory dishes.

This is a simple recipe that all family members will love. I didn't bake mine because some family does not like gravy so I just cooked mine in the skillet. Made the gravy on the side. The only thing that I changed was adding more seasoning salt. I didn't think that the called for amount was enough so I did a taste test and it def needed more for our tastebuds. Made green beans and mashed potatoes as sides and my family was in heaven.

This is a Fantastic recipe and my entire family loves it!!!
We like gravy so we use an entire 32 ounce carton of organic beef broth and  reserve 5 TBS of flour .  REMEMBER to pour the liquid into the  skillet after removing the steaks. It helps clean the pan and adds extra flavor.  This is truly a 10 star recipe!!

I don't do reviews often but I had to do one for this recipe. I make ZERO modifications and do the recipe exactly as written and it is perfect every single time. I always double or triple the broth and flour mix for gravy. It can be a little salty for some people so if it is then just add more plain water to the pan instead of broth. Everyone loves this and asks me when I'm making it again. I use regular old cubed steak and it turns out melt in ur mouth tender. Just like I remember having at my aunt's house in Georgia!

I whisked the remaining seasoned flour with the beef broth and poured over it. I covered with tin foil and placed in the oven at 350. But it didn't turn out with gravy. What was supposed to be gravy, turned out to be a  moist, beefy flavored bread. Wait! Oh no! I used self rising flour. Not all purpose. Bet that's what happened. I ended up mixing up a couple of packets of brown gravy and pouting it over. Was still very good.

I've made this steak 3x and it's excellent! The only changes I've made is that I've found I have WAY too much flour mix at the end. I cut that in half but keep everything else as calculated. I also remove the aluminum foil for the last 30 minutes to help thicken the gravy. Easy and tasty recipe! No matter the cut of steak, you can always cut them with a fork. This has been added to my family's favorites!

Love this recipe, and so does my family.  I double the gravy part because I always cook mashed potatoes with it and the extra gravy is good for the mashed potatoes. Also, I never cook it for the full 2 hours. Great recipe!!!!!

Made the recipe as submitted. It was great. I substituted a sirloin for the cube steak & kosher salt for seasoned salt. Really good baked steak.  Served with smashed yellow potatoes & fresh asparagus from the garden. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was great!!! I added a bit more pepper than required  and I used minced garlic rather than powder. Also I used an iron skillet so that it was all made in one pan. I was a bit worried about the cook time and it smelt so good i couldn't wait. Therefore i took it out about 30- 45 min early and it was still fantastic and tender. Definitely putting this in the cook again category for me and my wife.

Awesome.  I don't understand how some reviews were negative.  This is a great recipe.  We followed the directions, but did take a reviewers tip to add onions to the bottom of the pan that it would bake in.  I can't rave enough about this recipe.  I plan on fixing this pretty much weekly.  I woke up during the night thinking about how good it was. WOW! Thanks for sharing.

This was very tasty but if you buy your cubed steak from a good meat market (not the grocery store) a cooking time of 2 hours is too long.  I agree with others, it needs double the gravy. I made this last night  and with a two hour cooking time, there wasn't much gravy left in the pan.

This recipe is a definite keeper.  The steak has great flavor and is fork-tender!  I did put a slice of onion underneath the steak, and doubled the gravy.

I used to make cube steaks a lot when I was a young cook because they were affordable, but I didn't realize that they  could be so good.  The young cooks today have the Internet to learn to cook.  Now that I'm retired and on a fixed income, I'm cooking cube steaks again, but now I have great cooks who share their recipes on the Internet and make us look like good cooks too.  This cube steak recipe is so easy and so tender that I could make it several times a week and never get tired of it.  Thank you, thank you for such a wonderful way to cook affordable meat!

This was good.  Unfortunately it took far longer to thaw out my venison cube steaks than anticipated, so I was not able to bake this as long as recommended, so it wasn't quite fork tender.  Next time I would make sure the meat was thawed early enough that I could cook for longer.  As per another reviewer suggestion, I placed the meat on onion slices.  I made a rue with the flour and then made gravy to pour over the meat.  Next time I would season the meat more, slightly bland to my taste.

I made this for dinner tonight pretty much as written. Only thing I added was some chopped onion. Personal preference. It turned out so tender and flavorful. Even my very picky son, who will not eat any kind of steak, loved it. Will definitely add to the evening menu lineup.

Great, tenderest I have made. I like to add an envelope of dry onion soup before putting in the oven. Can omit beef broth and just use water this way. The garlic really adds a lot.

I loved this recipe! I added a bit more flour than the recipe called for and mine cooked in about 1 hr & 30 min. I also added some Cayenne pepper, which gave it a nice kick! I served it with rosemary buttered carrots and it was a delicious combo!

While this was very easy to make,  I cannot say my family was very fond of it.  The gravy was good, but we felt it was missing something.  I may experiment with it a bit and see if that changes their opinions.

I love this!! In fact it's very similar to what my ex mother in law made and it was one of my faves that she made. The ONLY change I made was double the gravy that's poured in the pan. Some people are saying it was bland...add more salt and garlic powder or play around with other spices. I think it's delicious the way it is.

This was a great recipe and everyone loved it . I added onions and portobello mushrooms to the baking pan and it was a great addition . I only baked these for one hour not two as the receipt said , and they were tender and the gravy was nice and thick. Highly recommend !

It was good, however I prefer my usual recipe where I brown the steaks, place in baking pan, add water to deglaze the pan, add a can of mushroom soup and water to gravy consistancy and pour over steaks. Bake for about 30 min or so but not so long as to to turn cube steaks to mush. The gravy is fantabulous. My brother follows this original recipe and adds a can of diced tomatoes to deglaze pan, pour over steaks and bake for about 45 minutes for more of a swiss steak flavor.

It was okay.  This will be the 2nd time we've tried it.  We are going to double the beef broth and add 6 tbsp of seasoned flour to the recipe because I like gravy.  It came out rather crispy on the bottom so we're trying it at 325 degrees instead of 350.  The sliced onions on the bottom would be ideal and would probably prevent it from getting crispy on the bottom, but wifey says it would change the flavor.  I don't argue with the wife.

Made this tonight for my meat and potatoes husband. He LOVED it. The only changes I made were to add a little sliced onion to the bottom of the baking dish and substituted one can of beef broth ( because I was out and only had one can) with a can of Cambells French Onion Soup. The recipe says 2 hours but mine was easily ready in one hour with a nice thick gravy. I served it over mashed potatoes.  Great comfort food meal and smells fabulous while baking!

I have made this at least 5 times in the past 2-3 months and all I can say that it is really a simple easy and delicious meal.   My only variation is to bake for 1 1/2 hours rather than 2 hours.

Yummy! I also placed each steak on a slice of onion. However, next time I'm going to add some Worcestershire sauce on steaks before they go in oven.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge embarrassment!  The gravy actually gummed up and solidified in the pan.  We scraped off what was supposed to be the gravy and it was edible, but it was a big, salty failure. I am so confused how so many people got this recipe to work.  Is two hours at 350 degrees just too long??

This looked so good! Made it tonight for five of us.  Found the meat to be very bland & mushy.  The gravy was also bland but I added spices and that turned out good.  Do needed to double gravy.  Will not make this again.

Very good, but it certainly does not need two hours in the oven.  One hour would have been plenty.  Will be making this again.

This one will be a keeper.  Browning for 5 minutes each side using a cast iron skillet was a wee bit too long.  Baked in the oven for 1 hour and it was fork-tender.  What's important is that hubby loved it and that's all that matters!

The texture was like mush. I suspect cube steak is the culprit, my HEB uses a mechanical tenderizer on cube steak. Perhaps round steak would be better. Also the temp is not correct for tenderizing tough cuts of meat. Low and slow is much better.

We thought this was good. The only thing I would do different is to use some spray on oil before putting down the steaks and you probably don't need two hours to cook this.

This was the best Country-Style Steak recipe I have ever tasted.  I have always called this type of steak Smothered Steak.  This will be added to my weekly menus from now on.

This is definitely a keeper. My husband was surprised how tender the steaks were. The only thing will do differently next time is to make extra gravy and heat up right before serving, and probably less cook time; but that part is due to my oven. The house smelled so good as it was cooking.

This was a little bland to me.  I had to add some other ingredients to give it flavor.  Once I did it was pretty good. I base the rating on the actual recipe without alterations.  Good base though.

I loved the recipe with a couple of my own additions (nothing revolutionary). Some mushrooms sauted in the oil after removing the steaks and added a little fish sauce to the flour/beef broth, not so you can taste it, but for depth, about 1 Tbsp.  The gravy was really thick when I took it out of the oven, so I added water to it, so I could use it on the potatoes.  The next time I do it, I will cut down on the amount of flour or add more broth.  Obviously I would not have been able to improve to my taste, without this great recipe.  Thanks,  ddt

Absolutely love this!!  Only change I would make is double the gravy, double the gravy.  Delish.  The second time I made I bought chicken broth by mistake.  Used it anyway.  Put a little Gravy Master in there with it.  Was just as good as the first batch made with beef broth :)

I made this last night for dinner, and it was wonderful! My hubs and I were a little skeptical about frying them first, then baking for 2 hours! What a wonderful meal this made. Complete with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. I didn't change a thing except make double gravy! Definitely a keeper and I'll be making it again! Thanks hmclaurin for posting this!

Made this last night and it is delicious!  I forgot to buy beef broth and instead of going back to the store I used chicken broth I had on hand--no problem, it did not make it taste like chicken!  I also like onions so I sautéed some and spooned them on top of the meat before baking. This recipe is so easy and so good. Will definitely be making again!

Meat stuck to the pan even though it was sprayed, meat seem over-cooked and the gravy was pretty much non-existent.  Sounded good but think 2  hours was way too much cooking time and where is the gravy?  It all disappeared - again - too long of a cooking time.  Will look for other recipes for this dish and will not use this one again.

This recipe is very similar to one I make but I use soup (cream of mushroom, cream of celery, etc) and I cook it on the stove or in an electric skillet. Comes out great each time and the gravy is done when the steaks are. I always try to serve it with mashed potatoes. Great on a cold wintry day. A true comfort food.

I like this with the broth added. I used the Knorr condensed version and added water.  My grandmother always made this with just plain water, and no garlic, but this was better.  She always just covered her skillet and cooked it on low for a long time, but I like putting it in the oven because it doesn't stick to the pan as much.

This also is a great way to prepare cubed venison steak. You might like to add a large sliced onion and a couple strips of bacon, for subtle flavor variety.

This was ok. It did taste good and was very tender, but the gravy didn't turn out so great; it was too thick. I actually had to add water to the gravy.

i don't know if I've ever had cube steak before.  This was I guess what you would call tender because I didn't need a knife but it was so dry and like styrofoam.  It was not good.  The flavor was good. The gravy was good.  The texture of the meat ...not so much.   I guess it was way overcooked.

Love this recipe! Very easy. I only made one change. I added about a half a packet of dry onion soup mix in with the flour and other seasonings. If you like a stronger flavor, you could add the whole packet. I choose not to use a fresh onion. To strong for me. :)

It was my first time making country-style steak.  In the end it had decent flavor.  I believe the recipe itself is probably pretty great, but there are things to watch out for.  
1.  Watch out for the amount of oil.  Use what is necessary to fry - don't measure according to recipe - it's way too much. I more than doubled the recipe and as a result more than doubled the oil.  Major mistake.  :)  2.  Don't do what I did and double the gravy recipe as suggested IN the PAN that is in the oven.  
3.  Also, I needed a lot more thickening agent for the gravy - again maybe because I misunderstood, but think before cooking...

This was really tender, possibly TOO tender. Next time I'll try cooking it for about an hour, not two. It stuck to the bottom of the dish and fell apart when it was pried off the bottom. The flavor was good but I felt it really needed more liquid. All in all with a little tweaking it could be a keeper!

I placed the meat on top of sliced onions, after reading the reviews.  The meat was very tender, which was great. But even with the addition of the onion, it was a very bland dish. This wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

I made this exactly like the recipe and it was very tasty.  It made 4 very minimal-sized servings so you might want to increase the amounts. Also, I would either grease the bottom of the baking dish or line the dish in non-stick foil since the coating stuck to the bottom of the dish.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours and it was done and gravy had reduced a lot.  I will try it for an hour next time.

One of my favorite go to recipes when I’m busy. Easy to make. I often add carrots and potatoes in with the meat when I put it in the ovenI also add broth so as to have plenty of gravy. Then at meal time add a salad and you’re done. A good meal with little work and clean up

Edible, but it wasn't what i expected.  I followed the recipe exactly (using lower sodium beef broth) and it seemed bland, and "mealy."   The family was adding A1 steak sauce to it which indicates a lack of flavor, especially since it had a lot of gravy.    And maybe 2 hours was too long to cook it?  
It wasn't BAD, we all ate it and nobody complained, but I guess i expected better texture and MORE flavor.   Perhaps a few dashes of steak sauce or balsamic vinegar, no seasoning salt (its just salt with artificial coloring and sugar added anyway) and instead some kosher salt, and herbs?

Although the flavor was good, the meat came out like mush.  Will try it one more time and cut the baking time in half, at least.

Tried this recipe tonight.  Only thing I did was double gravy based on other user reviews.  Surprised meat turned out so tender...which is not usually the case with this cut of meat.  However, thought the olive oil after taste was a bit much and didn't like the meat texture (which wasn't the recipe's fault...just a personal preference).  If I cooked it again, which I probably won't, would use butter instead of olive oil.  But if you're a cube steak fan, would recommend giving this recipe a try.

I sprinkled the meat directly with salt, pepper and garlic powder, then dredged with flour and browned it as the recipe directed. Then I put the beef broth ( I used a quart) into the crockpot and whisked in 1/3 cup flour and added the meat. Cooked on low about 4 hours. It was FABULOUS.

my momma (from Arkansas) made it all in one pan.  after browing round steak, she'd take it out and saute onions in the oil & bits, then put the steak back on top and add just plain water.  Cover and simmer.  Then she'd start the rice and when the rice was done, the steak was done... ymmmmm one of my favorites.

I have made something similar to this in the past in my cast iron skillet as well. I just didn't know how to get the meat tender. I would usually cook it up in the skillet, add homemade gravy, and serve it. It is very chewy that way so thanks for the help.

Very easy to make.  Followed directions exactly.  If serving with mashed potatoes I would recommend making more gravy.  Next time I am going to add some veggies to the dish and let it cook with the meat.  Very good and my picky kids loved it.

I tried this recipe to find out if the texture of cube steak could truly be "melt in your mouth" like the reviews say. It was fairly tender (for cube steak), but not much more than it would be if I had prepared it on the stove, without having to bake for 2 hours. It wasn't overly dry but it wasn't very moist, either (even though it was soaking in gravy the whole time, as I upped the broth and flour considerably). The only thing left to try is 8 hours in a crock pot, and the idea of taking a whole day to cook CUBE STEAK seems ridiculous to me. I think I'm just gonna stop trying with this cut.

The recipe is easy but takes too long for what you get.

Easy & tasty.  I cooked in a smaller bean pot and layered the meat with sliced onions.  Sauce was thick and delicious.

Really good!  My carnivores loved it!  The only thing I changed was that I slightly decreased the amount of flour and I only used half the amount of olive oil that the recipe called for.

I've made this twice now and it's been a hit with the kids. I found that using Mrs. Dash table blend and salt in lieu of the seasoning salt adds more flavor.  I still find a bit bland though so will work on building better favors next time.  Over all though, great starter recipe.

I've made these twice and my family loves them.  They're not very pretty, but they have been very tender both times.  I throw in a couple hunks of onion and a few of the last lingering bell peppers we had in the garden just to add some flavor to the gravy.  I used less oil than the recipe calls for, but used canola oil because the first time I tried it the flour stuck to the bottom of the dutch oven. The best part about this recipe is that you only need the one Dutch Oven to do all the cooking.  Less dishes!

I liked country style steak before but this recipe made me love it. I added mushrooms and onions and a few dashes of worcester. My wife considers country style steak one of her signature dishes. I made this one night to surprise her. When she didn't talk to me for two days, I knew it was because I had upstaged one of her best dishes.
