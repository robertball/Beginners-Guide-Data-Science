I truly enjoyed this recipe. I used lemon extract instead of vanilla and put a bit of lemon rind in the batter. It was a great cake! Next time I may add a tad more buttermilk or liquid as it appeared to need a tad more liquid. Overall, a great base recipe. Thanks!

I first read the reviews before trying this cake recipe. It was a 50/50 chance, I have to say that following the recipe exactly i had no problems! The cake came out perfectly moist and fluffy. To those who had a problem i would just double check your Splenda bag and make sure you are using the sugar blend. Also check your flour bag, using cake flour and not all purpose can make a huge difference. 
 I would recommend this recipe to anyone who misses cake!!

Maybe I used the wrong type of Splenda (just the granular original kind) but my cake turned out more like scones than cake...It still tastes good but it was a bit of a disapointement.

I should have read the reviews first. It was entirely too thick and sticky in consistency so I had to add more milk. The jury is still out on this one.

My family really enjoyed this cake; I increased the buttermilk by 1/4 for added moistness.

Mine ended in the trash too.  I read the reviews and added just a 1/4 cup more buttermilk.  The cake did not rise and was near pancake thin.  I am not a notice baker, but was given 'sugar free dessert' for Thanksgiving.  While I wasn't expecting fabuluous, I wasn't expecting waste of time and money.

My batter came out much too thick. I followed recipe exactly and was disappointed.

This is the second time I have made this cake. The first time it was a little lopsided but that was my fault. If you follow the recipe exactly and use the white chocolate frosting it is wonderful.
