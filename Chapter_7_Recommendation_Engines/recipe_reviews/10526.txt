Fantastic! I used peanut butter instead of the butterscotch chips. Tasted like Take Five candy bars. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was a little disappointed in how this recipe turned out.  The pretzels turned out tasting really stale (I was expecting them to be crunchy) after mixing in the chocolate mixture.  Maybe it was because I used the pretzels sticks instead of regular pretzels or maybe that's the way they are suppose to be.  I think I will try this recipe one more time and use the regular pretzels and see if that makes a difference.

I also used pretzel sticks, broken into bits and pieces and got that not-so-crunchy texture, but when it tastes this good, who cares??  I used milk chocolate/peanut butter morsels and fat free sweetened condensed milk.  I liked the idea of bits and pieces as opposed to the crushed pretzels (made them look like little chocolate covered bird's nests!)but next time I may try a different shaped pretzel.  MUCH easier and quicker than the dipped pretzels I usually do!!! Thanks for the idea!

I didn't like the flavor of these at all.  They were really easy to make but something about the flavor was off... not sure what it was, but I probably won't try them again :(

These taste really good for about the first 30 minutes, then the pretzels get stale and they aren't worth eating.

These are just plain YUMMY!  Made it exactly as the directions said except just broke up the pretzels instead of crushing them.  They taste like candy and I am wishing I doubled the recipe!  Great way to use pretzels.

I also used this recipe to "use up" some sweetened condensed milk from another recipe. I used the regular mini pretzal twists and broke them into smaller pieces (not crushed). I had no butterscotch chips so I used vanilla instead and I did go with the 1/2 cup of peanuts. I certainly agree that this is much easier than the task of dipping pretzals individually. When I make again I will be probably use peanut butter chips and will increase the peanuts even a little more. Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious!! One thing about the recipe, it calls for crushed pretzels.  Instead of crushing the pretzels, I broke them up into bits and pieces.  I also substituted peanut butter chips for the butterscotch.  This one's definitely a keeper!

YUM YUM I needed a recipe to use up some extra condensed milk, and these came out so good that it's a permanant addition!  I brought a bunch to work and the office just scarfed 'em down.  I was lucky to get them there because my family wanted me to leave them all at home.  When you're done putting the balls on the wax paper, stick them in the freezer and you can be munching a lot sooner!

What a good idea--I had all the ingredients on hand. Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before making these and was really disappointed that the pretzels suddenly went stale. 
Would love to know what to do to keep that from happening.

Yummy.  The pretzels did get a little soggy, but it was still delicious.

Delicious!  I used pretzel sticks and just broke each in half instead of crushing them.  I don't like nuts, so I omitted them and just added more pretzel sticks.  Great recipe and a lot easier than dipping pretzels in chocolate, but with the same tasty results.

Good...I love sweet and salty desserts so this hit the mark!  The pretzels aren't crunchy after cooling so that's  a little disappointing.

I used no caramel chips because i didn't have any any and i just doubled the chocolate chips.  I used regular milk because i didn't want to run to the store to buy sweetened condensed milk. it worked fine.  The saltiness of the pretzels came through and worked wonderfully. i broke the pretzel instead of crushing.

Easy to prepare. We left out the butterscotch (Just because we did not have on hand) and added some dried cranberries. It is a nice salty sweet snack.

I found this recipe by doing an ingredient search for pretzels and chocolate chips.  I had to mix up something for a party that night so it had to be quick and easy and fit for company.  These definitely fit the bill.  I didn't have any peanuts so I used walnuts, and I didn't have any butterscotch chips so I used vanilla chips.  They came out great!

This was a quick and easy recipe to make.  I run a daycare and the children loved it.
