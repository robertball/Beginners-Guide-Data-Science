I make stir-fry alot and this tasted very average.  The technique in this recipe tends to make for tougher steak.  Next time I will cook the vegetables tender-crisp first while marinating the steak in ginger, garlic, pepper, dash of soy, oil, water, cornstarch and sherry.  Then take out the vegies, cook the steak, put back the vegies and then pour bouillion mixed with water and cornstarch over everything.  A dash of hoisin sauce or oyster sauce may liven the taste up a bit too.  Marinating the steak with cornstarch, etc. will produce a more tender steak.  Cook quickly with high heat.

GREAT FLAVOR BUT NEEDS A BIT OF TWEAKING! I read all the reviews, and it came out delicious, but...almost too salty even with being cautious!  

Here's my take on a very good recipe!

#1. I'd say low sodium soy sauce is a MUST, and I cut the beef boullion in half too.    

#2. I used fresh garlic(2 huge cloves).
    I used fresh Ginger-(3 quarter sized slices (minced)
    I used fresh veggies!

#3. I doubled the sauce as suggested. I used Pineapple juice for part of the water, and also added about 1/2 cu drained Pineapple Tidbits to the veggies as they cooked.

#4. After adding the garlic/Ginger/pepper to the steak I poured a bit of the soy sauce mixture over the steak for about 20 min before I stir fried it.  It really did make the steak tender and help meld the flavors! 

#5 - I diced up some Cashews and sprinkled them over the top before serving.  

Wow... it was very good, and the flavor in the steak was outstanding!!

The recipe is absolutely excellent!  I actually marinated the steak with a store bought spicy marinade. I used three different color peppers, two yellow onions, one zuccini and one can of spicy tomatoes. I fried the vegies in olive oil til they were half way done. (I actually didn't add the tomatoes til the very end) I made the sauce while they were cooking - I doubled it. Then since I didn't use the marinade suggested, I added the garlic clove, ginger and black pepper right to the vegies as they cooked (I only used 1/2 teaspoon ginger). I fried the steak in a separate frying pan while the vegies were cooking. Once the steak was half way done, I added the steak and sauce to the half way done vegies and cooked it all together til it was done. I served it over rice. It was absolutely outstanding!!!!  It was the best stir fry I ever made!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you!!!!!!!!

To liven this up, I marinated the steak in ginger, hoisin sauce, garlic, red pepper flakes, dash of soy, oil, water, cornstarch and sherry while cooking the vegetables.  Used low sodium soy sauce and used beef broth instead of the bouillon to cut the salt.  To the vegetables, I added sliced mushrooms. broccoli,  and water chestnuts to give this some variety.  Added a can of oranges along with the juice for the finishing touch.

This tasted just like take out!  It's a great sauce, and it's not too salty.  I used snap peas, sprouts, onions and mushrooms as my vegetables.  I will definitely make this again.

I used different vegetables for this dish, but other than that I followed it exactly.  The sauce was very good; I didn't think it was too salty at all.  I think I will add some red pepper flakes next time, and maybe some pineapple chunks.  We will have this again.  Thanks!

I thought this was a good, easy, and quick stir-fry.  I doubled the sauce like others suggested and I used frozen stir-fry veggies, which I thaw out in warm water so it doesn't water down my sauce and they also heat up much faster which avoids over cooking them.  The flavor was good and the consistency of the sauce was perfect but it was a little on the salty side.

I've made many stir frys and this sauce appeared the most authentic.  A little salty but it could have been the soy sauce or boullion I used.  I added a good 3 cups of vegetables and there was plenty of sauce (a nice coating)!.  The meat was flavourful as well with a nice ginger taste.  I'll definitely make this recipe again!

Delicious!  This stir-fry has a great ginger flavour - very subtle and not to overpowering.  I used a frozen stir-fry veggie mix and it took me less than 20 minutes to make!

I really loved it.  I used low-sodium soy sauce and instead of beef bouillon granules, I used "Better than Bouillon" beef Base which has a richer flavor.  Delicious!

I loosely followed the recipe but I added my own spin as I thought this could use a little “oomph.”   I used chicken broth rather than beef bouillon and water, and added just a smidge of mirin (2 T.) and brown sugar (I T.). I don’t like ginger, so I eliminated it altogether.  For the vegetables, I simply used cremini mushrooms and the whites of scallions.  Always mindful of “bad” carbs, I served this over Shirataki (no carb, no calorie) rice and braised baby bok choy.  I can’t believe how much I ate.

I love love love this recipe!  I use beef broth instead just because I always have it on hand.  I also use london broil meat just because it cooks well and isn't chewy!  I also use a bag of frozen stir fry veggies instead of fresh veggies!

I didnt have any ginger, but I added duck sauce to the soy sauce mixture.  It was pretty delicious.  I used red and orange peppers, broccoli, onion, and green onion as the veggies, and added some leftover steak that I had from last night.  Next time, I will add mushrooms and water chestnuts.  YUM!

Wow! My family does not like trying anything new or different, but they loved this.  I had leftover steaks in the fridge I didn't want to go to the dogs, so I looked for a recipe I could use them with, and this was wonderful. They couldn't believe I made the sauce from scratch. I will definitely make this again. Very quick, easy and tasty.

WAY too salty!  I couldn't eat it, and neither could my four year old.  Tastes like something you'd get at a mall food court, except saltier.

We really liked this. Next time, I'll have to double the recipe. My oldest son (he's 14 and part pig) ate over half of it by himself. We will be making this one again.

Not my cup of tea.  The soy sauce completely overpowered the garlic and ginger and made the dish so salty that I had difficulty eating it.  True, my husband liked it, but I have no intention of making this one again.

We really enjoyed this meal.  Tossing the steak with the garlic, ginger and pepper prior to cooking is what sets this recipe apart from others.  I stir fried the steak until it was medium rare so when I added it back to the sauce it could cook the rest of the way and not be so tough (overcooked).  I put in carrots, celery, onion and baby corn and served it over brown rice.  This is a keeper!!

Sauce was definitely too salty. Too much soya sauce. I would half the soya sauce and add water to take the saltyness down a bit. My kids loved it though! I might make this again if there wasn't anything else left in the house! Hah!

This was excellent and I made a few changes. I used 1/2 cup red wine and 1/2 cup soy sauce to use as marianate and to cook with. I also used round steak which is low fat and inexpensive. For vegt used grn and red pepper cut up with one med onion and would have added mushrooms if they had been on hand. Otherwise I followed all spices listed etc. It is a good recipe we used to feed 10 in hot summer vacation but its good any time of the year and healthy.  Its a flexible and easy stir fry

I didn't have beef stock, so I just used the boiling water. I also marinated the beef for an hour in sauce, then stir fried veggies while waiting like an earlier suggestion. I think it added more flavor to the beef. Also, cooked beef in sauce for an additional half hour to reduce any toughness. Beef and sauce were very flavorful. It's a keeper!

Solid! Decent flavor, easy to prep quickly. Nothing mind blowing, but overall a good stir fry. Thanks for the recipe.

Slightly too salty (even with about 1/2 the amount of beef bouillon) for my tastes, but otherwise great recipe.  The only adjustment I made was to marinate the beef strips for about an hour (in soy sauce/cornstarch mixtures + ginger, garlic, and pepper).  Will definitely use again, maybe with light soy sauce instead!

This was great! I doubled the sauce like previous reviewer said. And I used a white onion because that's what I had on hand. I think next time I will add water chesnuts and bean sprouts. Will definately be making this again!

Very good but I put my spin on it, too with what I had on hand. I made it for 6. Instead of water and beef boullion, I used 1 can beef broth and 2 packets of beef Herb-Ox (I like the additional seasonings.) I also used lower sodium soy - 1/2 cup and then the 2 TBSP cornstarch. I put in a shaker and shook, shook, shook.
We love garlic so I upped the amount to 3 cloves, peeled and minced. I also used 1 1/2 tsp fresh ginger, minced as I happened to have some. I added the garlic and ginger to the browned steak. 
Cooked for 5-7 minutes and added 3/4 can of pineapple chunks.
Then I added 2 bags of somewhat thawed frozen stir-fry vegetables. 
A couple of good shakes to the broth-soy mixture and then I added on top. Brought to a boil. Put on simmer and covered for about 10 minutes.
Some ate with rice and others grabbed a bowl and dug in! Very good! Even better the next day! Thanks for the inspiration!

This stir-fry was very good. I used frozen vegetables instead of fresh, and served it over rice noodles instead of rice. Also, I omitted the bouillon cube and replaced it with one tablespoon of brown sugar, and some red pepper. The sauce was excellent, but I will try regular rice next time, as the noodles seemed to take away from the sauce more than enhance it as I had hoped.

Everyone liked the flavor of this but no one liked the steak. My husband said it would be much better with chicken. Will certainly try this again but with chicken breasts cubed instead of steak.

I don't think anyone can make a stir fry at home where it tastes as good as at the restaurant, but this was really good.  I had left over pot roast and lots of veggies to use up and this recipe was perfect, but I added LOTS more garlic.  My husband and kids loved it, too.  Thanks.

This was wonderful!!!!!!  Instead of serving over rice I served with Ramen noodles.  I didn't use the veggies they recommed, I used a stir fry mix that was frozen.  But it was great.

Delicious! I used w/ out the steak and just with various veggies and a scrambled egg.  Adjusted the garlic up and the ginger down to suit my taste and added a little lemon.  Will definitely use again for other stir fries!!

WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL!!!  This is the best stir-fry recipe I have ever tried and probably the last.  In my opinion it was perfect.  I used pork, instead of beef, which I had on hand.  It rated 5 Stars with my family and I shall definitely use this recipe when I make stir-fry again.  Thanks.  Iret

Really very good...used what was on hand, and so the meat turned out to be a strip steak.  I sliced it very thinly while still half frozen.  I used celery, carrots, green onions and water chestnuts.  A keeper for sure!

This is just as good as any stir fry I've had in restaurants.  I added broccoli, onion, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts.  Since I added so many veggies, I made more of the bouillon soy sauce mixture.

This was a great recipe, tho, like a previous respondent, mine was also a little salty. I tweaked a little with the addition of peanuts along with baby corn, the peanuts especially worked well.

My husband calls this a superb recipe!  I did modify to our tastes.  First of all I had leftover steak and looked for a way to add to it for a left over meal.  I did double the sauce recipe, used celery, carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, a whole onion, and finally red and yellow peppers.  I did not measure veggies as I just used the amount I had in the refrigerator.   The most time was spent in the prep work (the veggies) when all was ready the cook time was under 15 minutes.  I also used organic beef broth instead of the water and bouillon granules that it says in the recipe.  It was an excellent way to use leftovers and a fine meal.  My husband is still commenting on how excellent it was.

This is going into my regular rotation! I only had frozen broccili to add, but it was still great. After the steak was cooked and removed, I put the broccili in, right from the freezer, put a lid on it for a few minutes to soften it, then continued as the recipe states.

Very easy, very flavorful! I used the frozen stir fry veggies as suggested and added a can of sliced water chestnuts, since that's our favorite stir fry ingredient.

Very good flavor. Traded out the beef bouillon and water for beef broth and used frozen steam fresh asian veggies. A very fast, very good meal. Thanks for the recipe!

I use this recipe almost weekly! Sometimes substituing chicken for the steak, but keeping the broth the same. Oh, and I never use the ginger, because I don't have any on hand. I also use a bag of frozen veggie stir-fry or sometimes mix fresh & frozen if there is something I need to use up. Tastes just as good as take-out IMO. YUM!

Just okay even after reading a few of the comments and marinating meat in ginger, garlic, pepper and conrstarch mixture while vegetables cooked. I also used fresh ginger and garlic. The ginger taste, though, was a bit too strong for me, so I'd use 1/2 a teaspoon instead of a whole. But thanks to the marinating advice, the meat wasn't tough at all. But still just average.

Great stir fry and easy too. Used cut peppers red and green and added frozen stir fry vegatables although fresh brocoli, carrots, mushrooms and anything else would work to. Used wild rice but brown rice would work too.

Replaced the water with pineapple juice, added oyster sauce, and marinated the beef overnight. I cooked the veggies first then added it to the cooked meat. Added a dash of sesame oil before serving. Yummy.

This is a good, quick meal, especially if you use a bag of frozen stir fry veggies like I did.  I used low sodium soy sauce and added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes.  Perfect for a busy weeknight.

Hi, We are Table 5, a group of junior high students! We tried this as a Lab for our foods class. The Steak was amazing that was all we really ate. But the veggies weren't really neccessary. We think it would have been better with only chives. It didn't turn out like the picture at all. Most of the juice was still left at the bottom of the Wok. Overall the steak should have been served alone.  - JJAK members of Table 5

Holy Moly is this salty!  As soon as I tasted it it hit me like a ton of bricks!  I should have realized, boullion is pretty salty, and then when you added 1/3 cup soy sauce, it's bound to make it too salty.  I think this is a great base recipe though. I just think next time I would use low sodium beef broth and/or low sodium soy sauce instead.

Yum! Very quick and easy and almost as good as take-out. It's not AS GOOD as take out, because in my opinion it wasn't salty enough. My husband liked it the way it was, though. I didn't put ginger in b/c I didn't have any nor did I put green onion but I replaced it with a vidalia onion. I also added a large red pepper and used carrots. I didn't double the sauce like a lot of reviewers, because I thought it was plenty. Overall a very good recipe!

Great 10 min. meal!! I used pre-sliced stir fry meat and frozen stir fry veggies. I used some of the sauce to marinate the meat for about 30 min.  I cooked the meat and then threw in the veggies and added the sauce.  I also added some red pepper for our tastes!  Easy and Yummy!

I thought this was delicious, simple, and I had all of the ingredients...I usually use a store bought bottled szechwan sauce. Since I was out, I tried this recipe for the sauce...it was perfect and the kids loved it too because it wasn't spicy like my usual stir fry...will definitely use this recipe again.

This was a good recipe! I was overall very pleased although I didn't get to use the ginger :( (I bought it then lost it, so, I couldn't use it). Very Good. Very salty though, I recommend low sodium soy sauce, then you could always adjust the salt yourself. I used frozen veggies so I had to add more flour/cornstarch. Also added broccoli and carrots. Yum! Ease was superb. Will make again.

This was very good!  I did double the sauce and found glad that I did!  I did no salt at all but did use the correct amount of soy when doubling.  We like bold flavors though.  I also added in a little sugar and honey as we prefer asain/chinese a little sweeter.  Great recipe though....definitely a keeper!!

This is a great recipe.  Although I really love salt I found it to be a little too salty!  Next time I will follow some of the other reviewers suggestions to cut down on the salt.  Other than the salt everything tasted wonderful.

It was alright, the meat was a little bland.  Next time I will marinate the steak and add a touch of sweetness to the sauce (or just use storebought sauce instead).

This recipe is fantastic - I make it all the time for my family & my in-laws - They love it!  The only thing I do different is I change the vegetables...sometimes I add carrots, snow peas, onions, and chinese corn.  It's the only way I can get my husband to eat all those veggies @ once!

Just finished making this recipe and it turned out wonderful!  Very tasty and the house smells great.  For the meat, I bought a package of fresh beef pieces for stir fry.  Also, I used brown rice and added broccoli.  Took about 35 - 40 minutes from start to finish.

This dish was the best steak stir-fry I have ever had.  I used filet mingnon and let me tell you....that is the way to go.  It was sooo tender and flavorful w/ the ginger and garlic.  I also used ramen noodles instead of the rice just cuz I was in the mood for that....I'm sure it's just as good w/ the rice. Yummmmy

I used low sodium soy sauce, and it was still a little too salty for me.  Next time, I will use a little less soy sauce and more water.  I used stir-fry veggies to cut down on prep time.  This was easy and tasty.  Will make again with minor revisions.

I didn't have the beef bouillon granules so I subbed chicken-flavored Better Than Bouillon... and I added a couple extra cloves of garlic.  Easy to make and healthy.  Served stir-fry over white rice with broccoli on the side (I wanted to make sure there'd be enough sauce for the dish).  I wouldn't have thought broth and soy sauce could make such a tasty sauce, but it was restaurant quality.  I'm looking forward to playing with this recipe to make it my own.

I've made this a couple of times and my guests have loved it!  The steak comes out so tender and flavorful.  One thing I did differently was to add soy sauce to the meat (w/the garlic, ginger & pepper) before cooking it.

The sauce was delicious. Although its good as is, I've started adding a couple of teaspoons of San-J Szechuan hot and spicy stir fry and marinade. It makes even better.It adds a little spice that's really good. I've also substituted sliced mushrooms and brocolli for the carrots or celery. Yum.

I loved this recipe.  It was super easy.  Instead of the veggies that the recipe suggested, I used fresh broccoli florets, baby carrots, mushrooms, onions.  Also, I read that the recipe was salty, so I used a lite soy sauce.  Along with the steak, I used shrimp and served over noodles for a lo mein.

I read the reviews and used beef broth instead of of a salty boullion cube. It did  make a difference on the salt but it was still salty. I also doubled up on the sauce and used 2 pkg. of frozen stir fry vegs. I sliced up 2 nice size london broils for this recipe that worked out good. I feed 4 adults and everyone like it except it was still a little bit on the salty side had to be from the soy sauce. Everyone said to make again but cut down on the salty so use low sodium soy sauce. Overall it was pretty good.

Overall the taste was ok, but VERY salty. And I used a low sodium soy sauce. Not sure what made it so salty, but I followed the recipe exactly. Will have to change up some things if I decide to try it again.

I really didn't like the consistency of this dish cooked in the slow cooker.  It tasted more like stew than stir fry.

Good basic stir fry flavors from ingredients you'll most likely have in your cupboard.  Quite salty, though, and that was with using a low salt bouillon and soy sauce.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I did not modify the sauce and did not think it was too salty as others have commented.  However, I do agree that the steak was a little tough.  I will try marinating the steak next time.  I also used fresh veggies - green and red bell peppers, snow peas, carrots AND celery.  I planned to use green onions, but forgot to add them in...  I actually think this was a perfect mistake, after tasting it, I couldn't imagine how the onion flavor would make it any better.

I wasn't exactly sure what to rate this. My mother seemed to like it a lot, I, on the other hand liked it and disliked it. I thought the steak was GREAT with the garlic, ginger, etc and you could even still taste it after it was cooked and with the sauce on it.My problem with it is that I didn't like the soy sauce..which sounds stupid and I should've known I don't like soy sauce before making it. It was just to strong for me. If I try to make this again I'll probably use more beef broth (I didn't use bouillon granules) and less soy sauce, and maybe a little bit of brown sugar.

This was ok...I think the recipe needs to have much less cornstarch - the glaze was very thick and gave it a chalky taste. Would not make again :(

This recipe is easily adaptable to any veggies you have on hand and left over steak, chicken or pork.  I tried it out first on my husband and he really liked it.  Our kids & grandkids come over every thursday for dinner so next time I make this it will be for a crowd.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is an amazing and easy recipe!  I made it so quickly.  We used filet mignon steak with this which was very tender.  I used hardly any oil and only had chicken stock on hand, but it still turned out amazing.  I would recommend this to anyone.

This was very good! As others did, I added extra ingredients. Instead of carrots and celery, I added pea pods, water chestnuts, 1/4 c of sliced vidalia onion as well as the green onion. I substituted red pepper for green since that's what I had on hand. For personal taste reasons, I cut the ginger to 1/2 teaspoon and added more garlic. I did take a suggestion and used a can of beef broth and it worked out fine as far as the sauce. Thanks for the recipe. :)

My husband was craving stir fry for awhile, and I came across this recipe. It worked really well and was incredibly good, even though it was a little salty. I'll have to buy some low-sodium soy sauce. I'll definately make this again.

This is one of our new favorites!

I read the other reviews/suggestions carefully, and this is how I made it:

Instead of the main veggie being carrots/celery, I used pea pods (awesome!).  I did include a little carrot and the pepper and green onions as called for.

I did double the sauce as suggested, HOWEVER, I did NOT double the soy sauce along with all the other ingredients.  I had almost a 1/3 cup of soy, but ran out (D'oh) so added about 1/8 cup more of fish sauce.  I think that gave it a good zing.

I followed the recipe otherwise.  Browning the meat beforehand worked out fine, and the sauce tasted FANTASTIC!  Not too salty at all.  I felt like the stir-fry was 'swimming' in it a little bit, but that is only an aesthetic observation.  It still tasted great.  You could probably get away with a little less than double the sauce, though, too.

We had a Sunday barbeque where the T-Bones were overcooked just a little bit (they were medium).  I didn't eat mine because I prefer mine rare.  We didn't want to throw it away so for a weeknight dinner, I looked for a stirfry recipe to cut it up and put in.  This was the ticket!  No time at all and one meal turned into two!  Used leftover white rice from local chinese restaurant, low sodium soy sauce, and a tablespoon of flour instead of cornstarch because it was all I had on hand.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it several times now and have varied it a little bit dependant upon what I have in the fridge vegetable wise, but the sauce is just outstanding so it comes out perfecto every time!!  Trust me, try this recipe!!

This was pretty good, I followed everything very accordingly and the sauce came out real gooey and clumpy, water helped fix that, 
it was just a reg. tasting recipe, I'll be searching for others.

This was excellent -- definitely a keeper!  I even forgot the garlic (and we LOVE garlic) and it was still great!  The only things I did different was use skirt steaks and the veggies I had on hand (broccoli, carrots, celery, red peppers, red onions and green onions).  I also served it over brown rice so that it would be a little healthier.  Just wonderful!!!

my boyfriend and I LOVED this.  I did have to modify this a little because we like more flavour.  Added more ginger power, garlic and this Dutch sauce (they use for their meatballs).  It was really YUMMY.  a keeper.

This recipe was great.  I served it to a dinner party.  I doubled the sauce, and added some chicken, shrimp, baby corn, waterchesnuts, and peanuts.  Tasted wonderful and very simple.
