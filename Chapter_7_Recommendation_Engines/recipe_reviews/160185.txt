This dish is great! I've made several variations but my low carb favorite is to leave the cauliflower in chunks and replace the kidney beans with chopped celery hearts - adding them with the tomato! Sometimes I need to add a splash of water or wine vinegar to make sure the cauliflower steams properly. I also increased the spices a bit to make it even more flavorful!

I give this four stars because the flavor was right-on, but can't give a full five stars because the texture was not very curry-ish. It needed more sauce, so I added a little bit of my own home-made curry sauce to it (potatoes, garam masala, ghee, chickpea powder, etc) and it was wonderful.  I also added more cumin than suggested. Mmm.

Did not have kidney beans or tumeric on hand and added 1/3 of the veggie oil, but the recipe was very enjoyable without these ingredients. A nice fresh flavor where the cauliflower can shine through. Would definitely make again. Nice and healthy.

Garbanzo beans fit this meal better than kidney beans.

This was a delicious way to eat cauliflower. We did not grate the cauliflower, we used the florets and we did not add the beans.  Would probably used another tomato for color the next time.  Also halved the cayenne pepper.  It was still spicy!  And the garam masala was purchased from a specialty store. Don't leave it out. All in all, we would make this again the next time we plan an Indian dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My husband loved it.. although he said it would be better with ground beef but he thinks everything is better with meat. I didn't like it at all but I am not a curry lover like my husband.

I was looking for an Indian side dish that was veggie based and low in calories to round out my main dishes.  
I made this recipe with the following changes: used a 19oz can of chickpeas instead of kidney beans; rather than cumin and coriander seeds, I used the same amount ground.  
This recipe has a nice flavour, but needed some extra liquid to cook properly.  I just added water as I saw fit.  White wine might also have been nice.  My partner and I have been enjoying leftovers for the past few days - this dish is a nice side even if your main meal is not Indian.  It is AMAZING with a good dab of plain yogurt and sprinkled with geram masala, as other reviewers have suggested.

Great recipe!  I omitted the kidney beans and used  a package of tofu instead (extra firm) - sauteed the chopped up tofu with the onions and spices until it was slightly browned.  Delicious!

I gave this 4 stars because as it was, I felt it was lacking something.  I followed the recipe exactly, but wanted it to be more moist once it was nearly done cooking.  So I added 1 tablespoon of butter and a couple of teaspoons of flower, mixed it all up, then added a bit of milk. Just enough to add a bit of moistness to the dish.  This extra step made it nice and creamy.  Very tasty! Thanks!

This was awesome. It was easy and healthy. Even my teens and my husband liked it. I made it as the recipe indicated (which I always do the first time I make any dish from allrecipes, so I can rate it fairly).  I actually look forward to making this regularly (2-3 times a week) as a delicious and healthy snack... I'm sure it would be a wonderful "side dish", as well. :)

Delicious...although I didn't add beans--the combo doesn't work for me.  Just the perfect amount of spice (heat) for the hubby, kids and myself.  My 8 yo just asked if he could have a bowl of the leftovers TO SNACK ON!! I can never get him to eat veggies, so a definite 5 star rating :)

With the Memsahib away in the UK visiting reatives for a month or so gave me the opportunity to 'test drive' some of the site's menus I had saved for what passes here in Spain for a 'rainy day'.

This was a particularly good starting point. Within seconds the delicious aroma was permeating the kitchen, like real Indian food ...and the result was a delicious and healthy meal for myself; even took some next door to my Spanish neighbours who had (would you believe ?) never eating a curried dish before.

They await my next experiment. Mouthwatering and simplicity to make, with the potential of applying it to other local vegetables. Thanks.

Not what I expected. Followed the recipe, but was a little to dry. Maybe next time try some coconut milk like others.

I thought it was absolutely great! I had steamed some cauliflower and had some leftovers, so what I did was just chopped up the steamed cauliflower instead of grating it and it turned out delicious.

Easy AND delicious!  I would definitely make this again.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable (healthier).  I also replaced the kidney beans with chick peas, which seems like it "goes" better together.  I made a double batch and similar to others, found it fairly dry at the end.  So I added half a can of coconut milk.  Perfect.

I used 2 large cauliflowers for 6, so doubled the ingredients. I cut the cauliflower into medium florets. Followed the recipe exactly and when it was time to add the cauliflower i folded the florets through the onion mixture and put on a lid. They were soft within 8 - 10 minutes. I like a bit more sauce so I then added a little tomato paste, cream (you could use plain yoghurt) and cardamon. I served it with brown rice. I put some in the oven to keep for my husband and it was so much nicer as the top was a little crunchy which made a better texture. Next time I will bake again like a gratin over brown rice.

This was very good but there was too much cayenne pepper.  I will add some coconut milk to it to cut the spice some.

This is a very good recipe. I tried it for my family for dinner, and obviously they liked it, because it was gone before I got to take a picture! The only thing is that because the cauliflower is so bland, I think I'll need to add some more spices, but regardless, this is for sure one of the favorite recipes at our house!

I truly hate cauliflower.  It's the only vegetable I can't stand to eat.  This recipe is the first one I've found that not only lets me handle eating cauliflower, but I actually want more!  The picture shows large florets, but I grated my cauliflower on a cheese grater.  None of that "crumbly" texture here!

I cut the cayenne down to half a teaspoon and it was still a little too spicy for me, but the flavor was delicious and everyone else in the house loved it. It was quick and easy to make, too, which is always a plus!

This recipe is so good.  I literally "grated" the cauliflower into rice size pieces in my mini food processor.  It felt like I was eating rice.  Very delicious and healthy.  My husband even liked it.

Great flavours, but it came out a bit bland at first.  Now I add some hot sauce to taste which gives it a little zing and makes it much nicer.

I used cauliflower cut into golf ball sized pieces which I lightly steamed a couple hours before I made the dish. We had company for dinner and the dish got a 5 star rating all around [even though I forgot to add the garam masala] I will definitely make it again, this time with the garam masala.

Really good! Didn't change the spices at all, they were spot on. The only changes I made were -  I cut the cauliflower into small pieces, didn't grate it. I also used "pam" and less oil (about 2 teaspoons)  and no beans, since I'm dieting. With these changes its 0 points on weight watchers!!, can't beat that.

Great flavors! I left out the cayenne pepper and I didn't have garam masala. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Next time I might increase the tomato and decrease the oil a bit. I was really surprised the kidney beans went so well with this too. Will definitely make this again!

This is a wonderful dish. Follow the tip to use garbanzo instead of kidney beans. Maybe use a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. Use the cayenne to your personal heat preference - I use less than this recipe calls for because I'm a sweaty wimp! Cook longer for softer cauliflower (and use frozen if it's cheaper). VERY aromatic and tasty.

This was easy & delicious, and my first attempt at Indian.  I did make 2 changes... I used chick peas instead of kidney beans (drained & rinsed) and I added about a tablespoon of hot red curry paste (I did not have any tumeric).  I did a rough chop on the cauliflower.  Thanks for sharing it!

Curry and kidney beans??? This screams LENTILS!! I used frozen (thawed) whole cauliflower; more than 1/2 an onion; 3 or 4 cloves of garlic; 1 tsp ground cumin; 1/4 tsp cayenne; 1 tsp coriander seed; one can lentils. Couldn't find garam masala... It was sooo good my BF is requesting it again for this week.

Wow!  Easy and good.  I used broccoli instead of cauliflower just because that is what we had.  Added half a leftover yellow bell pepper when cooking the onion and one can of diced tomato instead of fresh.  Tasty and filling with a little jasmine rice.  Thanks!

One word: Delicious! This was such an easy and quick dish to make. I have tried so many times to make Indian recipes and have never succeeded in creating the right flavors and textures. I had just about given up when I tried this one. Amazing! So glad I tried this recipe, will definitely be making again and again.   On a side note, I am not a big fan of kidney beans so I substituted the beans for green peas and it worked perfectly...Didn't even need rice with this, it was so filling on its own. I had some store-bought naan that i heated up with it, and it was a great compliment.

very good, we didn't especially like so much coriander seed in it, it kind of over powered the dish. However being from Indiana, maybe that's the way it's supposed to be and we just don't know it.

This was pretty good, but a little bland and a little dry for my taste. After adding potato and extra seasonings, it was significantly better. I would make again with modifications.

We really enjoyed this.  I did not use any beans, but I did add about 3/4 of a can of lite coconut milk, because we wanted some kind of sauce with it.  We served it over white rice.  I also didn't have any ground coriander see, so I just added some chopped cilantro on top before serving.  Delicious.  Even the kids liked it!

It was ok.  I followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out just ok.  I'm not sure if I've just eaten a lot of Indian food and grown picky, but I felt like there was something really lacking.

Great recipe to build on. I doubled the tomato, turmeric, and coriander, halved the cayenne, added some chopped up tofu and browned it before adding tomato/spices, and finished the dish with a cup of cooked lentils instead of the kidney beans. I chopped the cauliflower up in a food processor rather than grating it, which made for a great, rice-like texture and released so much moisture. Between the cauliflower and the addition of the tofu, this dish actually didn't end up needing any more liquid at the end; it was perfectly moist and flavorful. Preparing the cauliflower this way also significantly reduced the cooking time; I just let it cook in the pan for a bit for the flavors to come together.

Great with Butter Chicken.  My friend added 1/2 can coconut milk and green peas instead of kidney beans.  Very nice dish! Steamed cauliflower  florettes first and then really quick prep at the end.

I tripled the recipe and added an additional 16 oz can of diced tomatoes. It still seemed dry so I added 2 c of chicken broth and also used garbanzo beans instead of kidneys. Garnished with plain greek yoghurt which made it creamy and took away some of the heat. (I kept the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp and it was still spicy). I personally cannot stand cauliflower but I made this for my family and it was a huge hit. Even my 13 year old loved it. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a bit laborious for a side dish but quite good.  The kidney beans are a nice way to add some extra protein to the meal and go surprisingly well with the cauliflower.  I just chopped my cauliflower into fairly small pieces as I don't have a grater.

Very flavorful. I chopped the cauliflower fine rather than grate it. I subbed a can of chickpeas for the kidney beans, as I like them much better. Since other reviewers said it was a little dry, I subbed a can of mild Rotel tomatoes, drained, for the chopped tomato. My friends loved it!

This is amazing! I didn't add the kidney beans because they didn't seem to go with the recipe. I would also cook this well in advance and let it marinate in the seasonings so that they really infuse the cauliflower. Everyone loved it.

This was a delicious and spicy side dish that my husband and I really enjoyed the flavor of. Our kids (ages 11 and 8) did not like it, but that didn't surprise us! I omitted the beans and added some water while it was simmering, covered. (I also forgot to add the garam marsala at the end!) I will happily make this again!

This is a great recipe for using cauliflower at a meal rather than rice or potatoes. The only change I made was omitting the beans. The only other change I will make in the future is reducing the cayenne.   We like spicy food, but this was a little too spicy.  Oh, I did use olive oil rather than vegetable oil. Definitely a keeper!!

This had some great flavor, though I agree with other reviewers that it was a bit dry.  I added 1/2 cup milk but next time will likely add about 3/4 - 1 cup coconut milk.  I left the cauliflower as florets, subbed tofu for beans because I had to use it up, and served it over couscous.  Yum.

Great recipe. Added 1/2 cup whipping cream, 1 tbsp cornstarch, and 1 tsp siracha. This provided a creamier base with a little kick.

Omit grating the cauliflower; tear 1/2 head of cauliflower into the smallest possible florets, then crumble. Add Garsam Masala with other spices, not sprinkled on top. I loved this but it is definitely hot!

So this definitely ended up being a 5 star recipe! It was flavorful and delicious. There are some very critical changes I made to this recipe that I must mention. First, you must use garbanzo beans instead of kidney beans. This next step is also imperative! A couple of the other reviewers said that this recipe was slightly dry so they added a little sauce. I made a very small roux using only 1 Tbs butter and 1.5 tsp flour. I mixed in ¾ cup vegetable stock and seasoned it to make a small amount of sauce. Mix in with other ingredients and what you get is a ricey textured recipe which has that delicious tikka masala sauce taste. I only sprinkled a small amount of garam masala on top. This recipe is amazing when paired with fresh cilantro!

This was awesome. I used ground cumin instead of seeds and really enjoyed the flavor.

It was very bland.  Ended up adding more cumin and some garlic hot sauce and mixing with rice and a little feta cheese.  Edible, but bland.

Overall it had a nice flavor, but didn't taste as exotic as it tastes in Indian cuisine when we eat out.  Plus there was no real sauce to it.

The seasonings are right on but the consistency is right off. it was dry. the photo shows a liquid and um there wasn't one so I added plain yogurt for a low fat version. I think adding coconut milk would be a more flavorful version.

Very unusual way of doing the cauliflower... never heard of it; but it works a treat, providing substance to the curry. I would only consider making this if you have a food processor though.

A few reviews said the curry was too dry, so I added 1-2 cups of veggie stock that I had and that gave the meal some delicious depth. And I left out the garam massala at the end. The curry was perfectly spiced without it.
