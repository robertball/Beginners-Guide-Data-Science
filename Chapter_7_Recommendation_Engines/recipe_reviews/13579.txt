My problem with this soup is the method. As written, you end up sorting though the vegetables to fish out the bones, fine if you get them all, dangerous and messy if you don't. I like to boil the turkey carcass in water with onions, celery, herbs, and carrots added for flavor, then strain the broth and put it out on the porch until the fat rises. I throw away the fat and cook the "final" vegetables in the strained broth. Takes a bit longer, but surely less of a mess. The flavor of the soup is great, though, as long as you don't use too much water. By making the broth before adding the final vegetables, you have the option of cooking down the broth to concentrate it if needed. This broth is rich in calcium because of the bones, for an additional bonus.

This recipe should be rewritten. A novice might believe that 5 cups of water is correct, it is not. That depends on the carcass size. Also, the rice will turn to mush and picking the carcass bones out of the "soup" is a mess. There are better recipes for turkey soup.

Excellent. Make the day after Thanksgiving or freeze the carcass/skin, then defrost to make recipe later. Use a crock pot/slow cooker (or pressure cooker) & make it even easier on yourself. Just make certain you cover the carcass entirely with water.  Sometimes I use 3 parts water & 1 part canned broth to enhance flavor.  I use a strainer over a bowl to strain out the bones/skin & retain the yummy soup.  This is easier than trying to pick out bones by hand, unless you have a big, Chinese strainer "spoon". This works for me too.

Personally, I make my broth the way PatsyK describes below. The only difference is that prior to simmering the bones and stock veggies, I roast the broken up carcass/skin/meat in the oven at a high heat, turning regularly. This adds a really good flavor to the stock, and also turns it a nice golden brown color.

As is this recipe is a great inspiration. However, I did things slightly different and it made a great soup.  Here is what I did...I used the carcass from my Crock Pot Turkey Breast and all of the juice in the bottom of the crock pot, 1 box of chicken broth, 3 bay leaves, 2 carrots, 2 ribs celery, 1 tsp poultry seasoning and cracked black pepper, brought to a boil for 1 hour.  Drained out the bones etc and disgarded. Then refrigerated stock overnight and skimmed. Then I dumped stock in my crock pot and added two cans mixed veggies drained and about 2 cups of turkey I got off of the carcus and cooked all day on low.  Just before sserving I dumped in two cups of cooked white rice. And walla a great turkey rice soup.  Thanks for the inspiration.

I used this recipe with a few changes based on other reviews.  Omit the rice.  Add wide egg noodles the last 15 minutes.  I used the spices that I would use   
with chicken soup.  Oregano,basil,bay leaves,majoram,ground thyme,salt,pepper and a little lemon juice. Tastes great and made a whole pot of  soup with what I would have thrown away.  Thank you.

Good, but kind of bland.  Had to doctor with herbs and chicken stock.  Not enough broth in soup.

I liked this recipe, and I too changed it a lot. I added lots of veggies and
at least twice the water. I also added barley which made it yummy. I'll
definitely use this recipe when I have leftover turkey or chicken.

(4 Stars for messy prep.) Great to have this recipe because it provides the proper proportions of ingredients to combine with the turkey carcass for soup success every time. The one 'improvement' I suggest is a trick I have used for years for the 'bones' from poultry, etc,. when boiling.       Most dollars stores sell packs of small size zipper mesh bags for hand washables. I put all the things that need to be 'picked' from the soup (carcass, bay leaves, etc.) into the mesh bag which then is easily removed from the cooked soup when finished. Thus, removing any bones & other debris afterward is an easy, simple task before returning the 'good stuff' to the finished soup!

The way it is written will take a lot of effort for someone who doesnt know how to cook, but this is a good recipe, just needs to be re-written to those that need to be told to do 1, 2, 3.

I cooked the carcass, and pieces that had meat on them (legs, wings) in a pressure cooker with a few cups of prepared organic "Better than Bullion" chicken flavor for 20 min (15 would be enough).  The bird was 18 lbs and had been injected with garlic herb marinade and deep fried.  Picked and removed bones and added the following:  3 stalks celery and 1/2 large onion sauteed in olive oil until crisp tender, 4 carrots, sliced and microwaved in a little of the broth for 4 minutes, a couple of cups of fresh chopped baby spinach, 1.5 cups cooked rice and half a pkg of frozen peas.  Skimmed the fat and heated until the peas were done, DELICIOUS!  No seasoning needed to be added except pepper if desired.

This is a good recipe. I used about 10 cups of water (I had a 12 lb meaty turkey carcass) which was a lot more than the recipe specified. It's a great basic recipe, I added a little cabbage and freshly cracked black pepper and a little minced garlic. Really tasty. Made enough for me & my best friend for lunch.  My thanks to Aunt Wanda!

I had a turkey carcass that I was going to have to toss or use.  I found this recipe but didn't want to go shopping so I used what I had on hand.  I added escarole, scallions, celery, carrots, salt and pepper and torellini...it was one of the best soups I ever made.  I think the escarole and torellini made it.

This is great!  Everyone in my family liked it, and the kids wanted to take it to school for lunch the next day.  I cooked it as is although I left it on the stove longer, and then seasoned to taste.  Add more water and you'll have more broth.  No need to add bouillon or broth; you are making broth!  Leave the veggies in the soup.  I don't know why you would strain out the veggies unless you just want the broth for some other recipe!  You could add any vegetable you have on hand, although the recipe as written is fantastic!

Hello! I havent even finished cooking it yet, the soup is still trying to boil but I tried the juice, and it takes great! I had to doctor the recipe a bit for my home ingredients. I added a can of carrots, carrots and peas, 8 oz frozen italian cut green beans, 2 cups rice, 1 can chicken noodle soup (totally not necessary, great before I added it honestly,but I wanted to kick up the flavor) sage, meat tenderizer, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, chili pepper. a dab of mexican hot sauce. Come to think of it this sounds like a new recipe, lol! But I used your base, I had no idea what to do with this turkey carcass. Thanks so much Aunt Wanda!!!

Used green peas instead of green beans, and added a few bay leaves for flavour. Very good recipe- but far too much rice. Halve the amount of rice at least and then youve got a nice soup recipe (:

It was very good.  I cooked carcass 90 minutes or more at low  with carrots, onions, and celery.  Tthen I removed the carcass and strained the pot so that broth remained.  Then I added fresh set of the veggies, rice, tarragon, and pepperand and cooked it 40 min longer.  Meanwhile I removed rest of meat off of the carcass.  I added meat back as I served it.  I like the dark meat and hubby likes the white meat.  I liked the spinach, cabbage, and string beans in the soup.  
Give my best to Aunt Wanda!

Way too much rice, though we followed the directions exactly, so it turned into a strange kind of turkey-rice stew rather than soup. We will not be making this again.
