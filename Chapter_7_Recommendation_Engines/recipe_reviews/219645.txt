Absolut lecker!!Yum, yum in German. A variation on traditional German Winter "greens" (in Hessen, we make ours much the same, but with smoked hocks and no bacon). I made this with the bacon and we LOVED it, so it's going in my pot of this warming, filling Winter dish from now on. Oh, use thick sliced bacon.

This recipe far exceeded my expectations! I thought it sounded good and seemed like a good way to use up some ingredients I happened to have. The end result was much better than I expected.
I made a few minor changes. I added two cloves minced garlic with the onion and I used a whole onion. as several other reviewers suggested. I also added a few fennel seeds.

We enjoyed this.  My husband isn't a huge fan of kielbasa, but had seconds of this and said he would eat it again.  I served it over boiled red potatoes.  Also, did add ham because I didn't have any, but I can see how it would be tasty.

Hi I am soooo happy to find this recipe but I am born in the Ammerland in germany which is ground zero for gruehnkohl.The basic recipe is ok.
But first at all use smoked pork belly instead of cooked ham and please please NO kielbasa.Instead check if you can find a german butcher who can provide you with PINKEL WURST.Thats the stuff that has to go in there.Next you can use Nutmeg but allspice is better and more onion ( 3 - 4 )and you have to cook it for hours.The longer the better.( 2 - 3 hours)Last but not least you can use kale out of the can or glass as long as it is unseasoned.Thats it.Enjoy your Gruehnkohl

So delicious! I made a few tweaks though. 
I added fresh chopped garlic cloves(3). Cut up the bacon with an added 4th strip. Used spicy mustard. Skipped the ham because we didn't have any unfortunately. Instead of kielbasa I cut 4 Italian w/ mozzarella cheese sausages into it.
My family loved it! Thank you.

I didn't have any onions or beef bouillon and didn't want to run to the store, so sub'd some beef onion soup mix.  It turned out great.  I also only used kielbasa, but other than that followed the recipe.

Excellent dish. Turned out just plain warm and delicious. I used some real beef stock instead of bouillon cubes and just a bit of water to cover. I also removed the sausage near the end and browned them a bit in another skillet, returned them, then deglazed the that pan using a couple ladels of the simmering broth and added that back in as well. I used no ham but 6 slices of very thick bacon. Scrumptious and hearty.

I was surprised that someone rated this one star, but then saw the great write up on it and realized there was a mistake. This really is very good and close to what is made in Germany. My mother in-law is German and makes it all the time. I just figured out how to do it with readily available US ingredients. Can't wait for the cold winter!

I love German dishes and this one has great flavor!  I used just local kielbasa sausage instead of bacon, ham & kielbasa - our local farmer's market kielbasa is the best around and packs more then enough flavor.

I don't eat pork so I swapped out the bacon for turkey bacon (6 strips) but I added some olive oil to replace the bacon fat, I omitted the ham and used chicken sausage. Results? Amazing!!! If you want to mix things up this is a fun way to alter the original recipe (and possible make it healthier)

I've made this as directed, but prefer my older version using ham shank. The marrow releases from the bone when left for a full hour, and the flavor is richer than with ham and kielbasa. It may take longer with ham shank, but worth the time!  The recipe is also yummy as is...

I've used this recipe three times because I loved it so much.  Last time I accidentally bought mustard greens instead of kale but it tasted every bit as delicious!  Fantastic, and delicious with the potatoes.

Ok so I wasn't really excited about this recipe but I had all the ingredients on hand so I thought I would give it a whirl. Omg! I am so glad I did. We LOVED this! Even my children. I did double the nutmeg and mustard, use a whole red onion and add garlic. I also added butter because we are on a ketogenic diet and we eat more fats. We didn't even add salt or pepper which like never happens! Bravo! For sure will be making this again!

I was just looking for an interesting recipe to try cooking kale for the first time and came across this one - glad I tried it! As a couple of other people suggested I used a whole sweet onion and a few cloves of garlic. (Garlic always makes it better!) I didn't have ham on hand, but followed the rest pretty closely. Delicious.

Logically, I made a few changes which make this basic recipe simplier. After boiling the kale and adding it to the bacon and onion mixture and seasoning it, it was ready to eat. Adding any wurst or sausage would have taken any "body" away from the kale. The grated nutmeg added the perfect finish to a great dish. I may serve it over or mix with boiled potatoes to create a great Dutch dish, Boerekohl!
