Instead of plain raisins, I subbed Raisinettes (chocolate covered raisins). I also used extra dark chocolate chips instead of white/vanilla ones and salted peanuts instead of almonds only because my husband is allergic to almonds. We all liked this a great deal. The little I had was very good. I think this would be good with chocolate Teddi Grahams instead of Cheerios or maybe chocolate Cheerios. As is, this was very simple to make with my kids and we all had a blast snacking on it.

This is a fabulous snack.  It goes great in lunch boxes and just a bowl for the little ones.  I use chocolate chips instead of white if I don't have white on hand.  Can also add peanuts to add a salty taste to it.

I had tried this recipe once a couple of years ago and I just can't forget the taste. I've been trying to cut down on the sweets, but I'm going to have to make this again! No need to tweak this recipe, it turns out great.

Just made this for a block party. Sorry, but I thought the taste was very disappointing. I was almost embarrassed to bring it, and yes I followed the recipe exactly as listed. Had to keep adding more stuff to make it taste better.

This mix is a holiday favorite at my house. We skip the almonds just as a preference. Its super easy & very good!
