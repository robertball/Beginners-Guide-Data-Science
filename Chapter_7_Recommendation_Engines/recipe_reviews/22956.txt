I am a chef in a Manhattan Resturant, and we have recently received several requests for pumpkin or squash soup.  I searched the internet, and I liked this recipe because of the roasted squash- this makes a huge difference in flavor.  Let me tell you what I did for the resturant, and how I modified it at home for my family.  First, for the resturant:

2.5 lbs (40 oz) of butternut squash, peeled and seeded
2 large yellow onions, quartered
6 cloves of peeled garlic
1 2" piece of fresh ginger, peeled and cut into 4 chunks
2 cups of chicken stock
2 cups of heavy cream
2 tsps of salt
1 tsp of white pepper
1 tsp of medium curry powder
2 tbs. of chopped fresh cilantro
1 tsp. of cinnamon
Sour cram and cilantro for garnish

1. Roast squash, onions, garlic and ginger until brown and soft- over an hour, depending on your oven

2. Puree in your blender or food processor with chicken stock until completely smooth.  Should be done in batches.

3. Heat on medium heat- add salt, pepper, curry, 1 tbs. of cilantro, and cinnamon (cinnamon can be a spice that enhances sweet or savory dishes- don't be afraid of it!).  While the mixture is hot, but before it bubbles, slowly add the heavy cream.  Add until it is the desired color and thickness for your taste, and allow mixture to bubble.  Lower the heat, and continue to cook on low flame for another 10 minutes.  Remove from heat, and let rest for 10 minutes.  Before serving, add a dollup of sour cream and sprinkle the rest of the fresh cilanto on t

This is a grown up treat. I hate squash, but I cater parties and was asked by the client to make a squash soup. I searched and found this recipe, followed the instructions exactly and wound up with a soup I tried and actually liked(!!!) and received rave reviews from my paying clients over. Have used it several times since and am working on coming up with some short cuts which may allow it to obtain better ratings on the quickness & easiness ratings. As for the kid-friendly rating, who cares? Not everything is for children, who are notoriously fussy eaters and should not be catered to as they have no sense of taste and should be ignored in terms of culinary aspiration. AllRecipe should add another rating scale - entertainment potential, in which this recipe would score off the charts.

This soup is okay.  It's quite similar to an excellent recipe that was passed on to me from a friend and which I later found in Vegetarian Classics by Jeanne Lemlin.  

I prefer the latter recipe which I've modified a little and which includes coconut milk and fresh ginger.  I recommend substituting the yogurt with coconut milk; nixing the oregano, cinnamon and nutmeg and bayleaf and instead using extra garlic, 1 inch of fresh ginger root (finely minced), and 1 -2 T. of sweet curry powder and a dash of cayenne pepper for bite.  This soup will knock your socks off.  It's gotten rave reviews everywhere I go.

Okay, I must confess,I've made this twice and it's a keeper!  1st time I made it, I started off by accident NOT reading the recipe, and cut the veggies, sticking it in a pot with vegetable stock and while it was boiling away proceeded to read the recipe...    Well, after all of that, it turned out terrific!  My husband proclaimed it his favorite, yet!

Then 2 weeks later, I roasted the veggies and must admit it was even better than the first time!  So, if you don't want to "mess" with roasting as some have suggested- don't- boil it and run it through the blender/food processor and you'll have a definite keeper recipe!  But if you are patient and roast everything, you will be rewarded handsomely for your effort!  My husband and I thank you for this terrific, low cal meal!

I made this and substituted 2 cups of coconut milk for the yogurt, added more curry and ginger, more brown sugar, and a bit more salt.  It was easy to make and my family loved it.  A definite keeper.

AWESOME!!!  I just love squash soup, this one is a healthy keeper!!!  I used 'World's Greatest Vegetable Broth' found on allrecipes.com for my vegetable stock, it is HEAVENLY, and compliments this recipe well!  (I try to avoid store-bought stock because of all the salt.) I doubled the curry (and I used Sharwood's extra-hot curry, and it really wasn't overpowering, just gave it a nice mellow flavour, if you can beleive it) and I alse added some baked apples and carrots to the puree. Tastes great even without the yogurt. Delicious!

UPDATE 10/13/11 No matter how much I make this, I never tire of it. I decided to add some diced macoon apple but did not puree, nor did I peel them. gave bits of color and that bite of sweet apple lends to the savoriness of the soup. No oregano..i always sub a bit of fresh cilantro. Excellent!  Perfect for a cool fall day. Recipe followed exactly except omitted the oregano, upped the curry to 1 1/2 tsp.,and didn't add yogurt directly to soup; just used a dollop to garnish the individual bowl. Used cilantro instead of parsley out of personal preference. Used Lawry's salt instead of regular.  I used 2-15 oz. cans of broth.  Important to remember that each squash has a different water content so adjust accordingly. The buttercup used didn't have a high water content so added broth after everything else was pureed and added to the stockpot. Since the squash was exceptionally sweet, I didn't need to add brown sugar. The dollop of yogurt added a nice creamy touch.  Thank you for this wonderful fall recipe that I'll make seasons to come!

Wonderful! I used two medium squash since recipe didnt specify size of the one, also I upped the curry powder and used coconut milk at the advice of another review, in place of yogurt because I didnt have any. But these were my own person variations... This is just a great recipe with a perfect blend of spices. Other reviewers mentioned it being annoying to roast the veggies or that it dirtied all of their dishes but to the contrary I dirtied very few dishes and how hard is it to cut a few veggies and stick 'em on a cookie sheet? Only problem I had was being to imatient to let them cool before I scooped them into processor! Ouch!

I loved this soup! Just bought a fresh jar of curry powder which made the soup really potent; just the way I like it; nice and spicey! I'm not crazy about sweet soups, so I left out the sugar. Delicious Lesley and thanks!

I make a lot of soups, this is a wonderful soup, that is restaurant quality.  I did leave out the brown sugar because I roasted the squash giving it a sweeter flavour than if you cooked it another way (boiling).  I also sauteed the onion and garlic, no special reason, would try them roasted another time.  I also used coconut milk instead of yogurt which gave it a creamier mellow flavour.  This recipe is a gift to soup lovers!

This is my go-to meal when I don't feel like doing a lot of work in the kitchen. It's delicious, healthy and so easy! It doesn't need brown sugar as the roasted veggies are already sweet. I skip the yogurt and add cayenne pepper for a little heat. Veggie stock makes it vegetarian. A couple of strokes with the immersion blender and voila! Delicious!

Made just a few changes: Added (roasted) 1 inch piece fresh ginger, used 4 C. chicken broth and 1 C heavy cream after it was done simmering.  I don't usually eat much soup, but this was BEAUTIFUL. Complex flavors, a little bit savory, a little bet sweet.  It was a wonderful thing.  Thank you for the recipe.

I didn't have to tweak this recipe very much, and it was SO GOOD.  I did do some things differently because I didn't have oregano - I used 1 tsp. pizza seasoning.  Also, I used another reviewer's advice and added 1/4 cup coconut milk in place of the brown sugar, although NOT in place of the plain yogurt.  I didn't put in 6 cups of veggie broth, I actually slowly added enough until it was to MY desired soupiness.  I did double the curry and added 1 tsp red pepper flakes because I need the heat.  I garnished with CILANTRO, because it's so much more fitting and compliments this soup better than parsley.  I have three male roommates, two who took the leftovers to work today, and one who said this was the best soup he's ever had.

This recipe was amazing! Roasting the butternut squash, onions, and garlic gave it such a rich and comforting taste. I made the following modifications: I cut the broth down to 4 cups, excluded the yogurt (to make nondairy), and added a pinch of nutmeg. During the blending process (in my vitamix) I added about 2 cups of the broth, then added the remaining 2 cups while simmering on the stove. Make This!

I prepared this using Amanda L's suggestions.  I worried the soup would be too sweet but the sour cream with lime zest and chopped cilantro was a perfect balance.  Absolutely use FRESH ingredients, grind your own cinnamon and nutmeg to make this soup perfection.

I made several changes to the recipe, based on the suggestions of others. I used only 2 cups of vegetable broth and dropped the yogurt, but added a can of coconut milk instead. I added a handful of fresh cilantro to the blender as I was pureeing the mixture, then upped the curry powder to 2 tsp, upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp, and added a pinch of ground ginger. I also left off the oregano, nutmeg, parsley, and bay leaf. I used sour cream and extra cilantro for garnish. With all these changes, FABULOUS soup. My husband loved it. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I made so many changes to the recipe.

It's quite good.  I sped up the process by cooking the squash in the microwave first.  Added one chopped apple with the onion & garlic.

I roasted the veggies the night before and then put in refrigerator ready to be pureed the next day. Very delicious - everyone loved - and doing that step the day before made it far easier.

I've never reviewed a recipe before. I have used and enjoyed many recipes, yet never felt compelled to review any of them.....this recipe changes everything! I made it exactly as indicated, except I added two chopped "Granny Smith" apples to the mix prior to the "Puree" step...This soup is absolutely amazing!!

This is absolutely the most delicious soup I've ever eaten. I didn't follow the recipe very closely but the idea of making a base from roasted squash and other veggies it brilliant. The roasted squash is incredibly sweet and loaded with flavor. I used an organic butternut squash. I also roasted an onion, a couple cloves of garlic, a half a jalapeno pepper and a red pepper. I blended them all with just a little coconut milk and chicken broth and heated it up. I also stirred in a couple of spoonfuls of Patek's curry paste. I have a feeling this soup is very adaptable and foolproof. I will make it again repeatedly!

I love butternut squash and also loved the seasonings in this recipe, but I did not like them together. Butternut, naturally has a  a delicious sweet and light flavor that was completely overpowered by everything else.

Roasting always brings out the natural sweetness.  I added a little cayenne pepper and some Garam Masala (an Indian spice) to make it nice and spicy.  Loved the yogurt in it, my husband omitted it.  The yogurt really provided  a nice cool contrast to the spicy soup.  Very Weight Watchers friendly.

This soup came out great.  I did make a couple of changes based on what I had on hand.  I din't use cinnamon, and added some ground sage and ginger, and used fat free half and half and 1% milk instead of yogurt. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable.  Also, when roasting the vegetables, I would suggest not adding the onions until half-way through, as mine were a bit burned.  Also, my blender was not cooperating to puree this, so I ended up just using a potato masher.  It's not quite as smooth, but still excellent.  Will definitely makes this again.

I used this recipe as a foundation, but i made quite a few changes.  Firstly, I omitted the garlic, bay leaf, parsley and yogurt.  I added a large, tart green apple, peeled.  I also used medium curry powder instead of mild. It came out fabulous and got rave reviews!

Very tasty. I omitted to the cinnamon and oregano as a few reviewers suggested and used about 3t of a sweet curry powder, and sour cream instead of yoghurt at the end which made it much more earthy. Had it at Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it!

I'm eating this right now.  It's delicious.  I made one change:  I used coconut milk (lite) instead of yogurt and part of the veg broth.  It's very flavourful.  (Also used cumin, coriander, paprika instead of oregano, cinnamon, nutmeg (guess that's more than one change.)

Followed exactly as written, except for the yogurt at the end, didn't have plain yogurt.  I guess it was the curry, but it was too much of a smoky flavor for us.  Next time I'll omit that and see how it tastes.

Roasting the vegetables really gave this something special.  I was complaining about the level of work to put in to this recipe but at the end of the day, I was in heaven with my favorite soup.  I cut back on the last cup of vegetable broth as 5 cups seemed like plenty and the extra may have made it too watery.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Roasting the squash, onions and garlic makes this soup amazing.  Very worth the bit of extra time.  I used light coconut milk in place of yogurt to make it vegan and added a little extra curry paste to kick up the spice a notch.  Overall, an excellent soup to warm you up on a cold night and use up the last of that fall squash!

This soup is fantastic! I didnt add the yogurt, cause quite frankly it didnt really need it. I bet if I did add it, it would just make it even better though. It is so low fat, low carb, and very tasty..I am glad I found it. Just started a diet and it is my new fave! Thanks for posting it.

For a variation, I used a butternut and an acorn squash, added a few carrots and a can pumpkin and cayenne pepper. Roasted the vegetables on foil and the clean up was easy.  I used a stick blender and it went really fast.  I made a large batch and have several servings in the freezer.

I made a few changes to this recipe. It has now become a favorite both of my family and at work! I used 2 medium butternut squash instead of 1. It gives a bit more volume for lunches or dinner the next night. I roasted a 2 in. piece of fresh ginger with the garlic. Instead of just using the 6 cups of broth I combined 2 cups of broth slowly while blening the squash, then while heating the soup with the seasonings I added 1 cup of heavy cream (it's MUCH better with a few extra calories) and 1 cup of coconut milk. I added about 2 cups more broth (I used chicken instead of vegetable) if the soup was a bit too thick. I felt that the brown sugar was not necessary so Idon't use it. I top the soup with light sour cream and finely chopped basil. I promise, this is the BEST.

Incredible! I have made this recipe at least 5 times and t
his is quite a wonderful soup - I double it and freeze some for those wintery days.  I also served it at a dinner party and put a dollup of plain yogurt in the center and swirled it around with a knife - it looked VERY gourmet!

This was good but, sorry Lesley, NOT worth the extra time and effort to roast the veggies. I have made many butternut squash soup recipes and this one was not the best. (I added extra curry for more kick too.)

AMAZING RECIPE! I decreased the amount of brown sugar and cinnamon and added extra curry and some chipotle, otherwise it was too delicate for us. I skipped the yogurt and added three tbs. heavy cream instead. Very nice recipe that everyone loved.

This is a wonderful cold winter night's soup! I added extra curry - we can't get enough.  We used the yogurt as a condiment, rather than mixing it in with the soup - wonderful!  We will definitely make this one again - soon!  :) Thanks for the terrific recipe!

Liked the technique of roasting the squash in the skin, then scraping out of the peel when roasted and cooled.  Saved time.  I chopped onion, celery and carrots in the food processor, sautéed in a little olive oil until tender, adding 3 cloves minced garlic for last minute of sauteeing, then added the seasonings, squash, a peeled/diced Granny Smith apple, broth and water and simmered about 20 minutes.  So simple.  Will definitely make again.

Made this tonight for the first time. Really great flavor -- perfect for a chilly November evening. I used only 5 cups of broth for a thicker soup. It worked, but it might have been a little TOO thick. Your mileage may vary. I'd definitely take the other reviewers' advice and use coconut milk instead of yogurt next time -- the yogurt tends to clump when you put it into the hot soup.

WOW this soup is delicious!!  The roasted veges make all the difference. I did the garlic in a roaster with a slight drizzle of olive oil (don't know if that affects the taste at all - probably not), and because I am low-carb but not low-fat, I used about 3/4 bar of philly cream cheese instead of yogurt. My VERY picky 8 year old couldn't get enough of this soup!!! First time eating it, and already a family favorite!

Very easy and outstanding soup. We are very health and weight conscious and this is very satisfying. I love it just as it is, added a shake of cayenne to my husbands bowl, as he prefers everything spicy.

I made this completely vegan, and it was delicious! Almond milk instead of the yogurt, and it worked fine. I upped the level of squash to keep the thickness, and got rave reviews from everyone :)

This was a good soup to come home to on a wintery day. It went over well with the dinner party and I made it again for myself but added chorizo.

Ok. Not AMAZING,  but pretty good. I think that I'd just use cream instead of the yogurt next time. Also to anyone else making this recipe, allow yourself more time than it states to really cook the squash. I didn't even have a very thick or big one and it took much longer than an hour.

Delicious! Worth the extra baking time and so simple, really. All I needed to buy was the squash! I used EXTERRA's spice recommendations but kept the oregano in since everyone's a fan of it in my family. Instead of yogurt, I added a half cup or so of fat free half and half.

Used coconut milk instead of yogurt, used 4 cups veg broth instead of 6, and upped the curry powder to taste (doubled or tripled, probably). Very good! Will definitely make again and again. And do roast the veggies first - it makes the flavors much better!

This was my first attempt at Squash soup and I have to say it was much easier than I thought it would be thanks to this recipe!  I did make a few changes.. Had no vegetable broth so substituted low sodium chicken broth.  I added an extra teaspoon of curry powder and extra teaspoon of brown sugar (as the particular squash I used wasn't the sweetest one ever) and a cube of frozen ginger.  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper.  After tasting the soup I thought it was good and then I added about a cup of coconut milk and it became GREAT! :) The coconut milk added the depth of flavour and creaminess that it needed.  Will make again!

I'm on a restricted diet so I had to change the yogurt to 1% cottage cheese, left out the brown sugar and it still turned out amazing!  I hope to make this for my friends as is for a harvest party because I can tell it will be even better.

This is a great soup!  I followed the suggestions by Amanda L and cut into cubes to roast along with onion, garlic, and ginger.  This is a great recipe for squash!  I added 2c half and half for 1/2 the chicken stock to make it creamy without so much fat.

A Keeper!

I have never make butternut squash soup and was skeptical to try but I am sure glad that I did. I followed the recipe as it was written except I used low fat sour cream instead of the yogurt. 
I like that fact that it was low in calories, fat and extremely healthy soup. The curry blended very well together with all the ingrediants.
Thank you for posting this well balanced comfort food.

Sorry, this soup went uneaten at my house.  I had to throw most of it out.  We even have sophisticated palates.  I will go on with my search for a good squash/pumpkin soup my family will enjoy.  My 19 year old said she would rather it be a bit more savory and didn't care for the nutmeg.

I feel something is missing.  It wasn't creamy as I was hoping.  Although, my husband thought it tasted healthy.  I think I'll keep looking for more recipe of butternut squash with more creamy and sweeter flavor.

Did this last night and it came out great. I never knew butternut squash tasted soo good! I didn't add curry/bay leaf, but I may do that tonight but just to my serving. I didn't have yogurt, so I used a bit of half and half. Very soothing (almost Nostalgic becuase once it's blended it reminds you of baby food!!  Great recipe. I'm looking for a good (quick and easy) sandwich to make to go along with it. Any suggestions??

This is fantastic!  I used two small squashes and brushed them with olive oil before roasting.  I added about 2 tsp of smoked paprika and mixed in a little cream in each bowl before eating.  I've never been so happy that my boyfriend hates soup and squash.

I used 1 cup of coconut cream (the solid part when coconut milk separates in the can) instead of milk. I used veggie broth too (my aunt is a sikh so she's vegetarian). We all loved it.

This was an Awesome soup. I only changed the recipe  in a few ways going by the previous reviews. I used ground ginger ( I wanted to roast some ginger with the veggies, but forgot, I will do this when I make again) I used 2 cups of light coconut milk instead of the sour cream. Added red pepper flakes for a little spiciness, and garnished with Parmesan and Romano croutons.

WOnderful, light and filling.  I think it needs more spice than the recipe calls for, so when I make it again, I will beef up the curry and cinnamon.  Or maybe try it with garam masala.....mmmmmm!

Really loved this one.  I had to tweak it, though since I only had 1/2 of a butternut squash and had forgotten to pick another up.  I had 1/2 of a butternut squash and added 1 sweet potato and 1 potato to it.  I followed the recipe then, but also added some grilled chicken to it.  De-lish!

Delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to add a little more brown sugar and curry powder, but that's my own personal taste.  It is heavy on onion flavor, but that could have also been my vegetable broth.  I didn't add the yogurt to the soup, because I wasn't serving it right away, but I did add a nice healthy dollop of sour cream after I heated up a bowl and sprinkled some pepitas on top for crunch factor.  Lovely and perfect for the fall days ahead!

I found this recipe a bit bland so I added almost a tablespoon of curry and about the same amount of fish sauce for saltiness. I also used coconut milk and still needed yogurt for some more depth of flavor. This is my first squash soup, so I might not have had the right flavor expectation. Also, since I added the coconut milk, I only used 4 cups of broth.

Excellent flavor! One suggestion - I turn the squash halves flesh side down and peel off the skin. Much easier than trying to scoop out every bit of the delicious flesh.

After all the work we went through to make it, this soup wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. I actually liked the flavor of the roasted butternut squash alone than I did when everything was mixed together. I'll finish the leftovers, but will look for a different recipe next time I want to cook  with butternut squash.

This was really tasty.  I think I added significantly more butternut squash (3 small-medium sized), and only 4c of organic salt-free vegetable broth.  Overall, the soup was a nice consistency and had a good flavor.  I haven't added any yogurt to it, as I'd like to add that as I eat it.

AMAZING SOUP!  I agree with the previous reviewer (Danielle), that one should stir or blend in the yogurt - it didn't totally blend in.  Otherwise, absolutely phenomenal soup. Definitely will make it again - maybe even for the in-laws!!

I have tried this recipe and got a 5star rating from the neighborhood when I served this soup in our mini fiesta at the clubhouse. I personally love the taste and so the rest too!  They said they only taste this kind of soup from a 5 star hotel.  whoaaa... 

I made some changes though, like i put fresh coconut milk (abound in the Philippines)instead of yogurt.  I found no parsley and nutmeg so I have to let go of these ingredients.  I have no weighing scale so I just estimate an equivalent.   No vegetable broth too so I use seafoods broth and reduced it to 6 liters. I add flour too to make it thick.  FANTASTIC!!! thanks a lot!

It was allright i think, but next time i will make a few changes. I think the soup was far too thin, so next time i will use 2/3rds of the broth that you reccomended.

I will also omitt the cinnamon (as i dont like it all that much), and MAKE SURE the vegetable broth i use isnt too strong, otherwise it kinda swamps the butternut squash flavour. 

Oh and guys, i dont care how many people say it, using double the amount of curry powder would totally over-take the flavour of the squash.

Oh and i used chopped cilantro for garnish, because cilantro is always a better herb to use for curry-like dishes.

Oh and also, another reason i gave it 2 stars, is because when i added the yoghurt, and stirred it, the yoghurt just ended up in little spots, and didnt blend in correctly. So presentation-wise it was a bit of a flop.

Felt like something was missing. A little too strong on the garlic side, lost the butternut squash taste a bit. Still prefer this over sweet squash recipes, though.

If you make this recipe, be prepared to dirty every dish in your house!  It was well worth it though.  I was trying to find a squash soup recipe that did not have cream or milk in it and I came across this one.  It turned out amazing.  I added some paprika for a little extra color and flavor.  Hubby liked it so much, he wanted to make sure it went in my cookbook of recipes I make over and over!

I bought some squash at a farmer's market, without ever having made it before.  I tried this recipie and really liked it.  I only tweaked it a little....I used two squash, instead of one, because mine were small.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I didn't have brown sugar (how do you run out of brown sugar???), so I used a package of sweetener instead.  I kept that spices the same.  It came out really well.  I love the curry taste in it.  I used yogurt with it, which was good, but it was also good without it.  My husband didn't like it...but he doesn't know what's good for him!  I had two bowls today and I"m going to freeze the rest.  A very healthy, yummy recipie for fall!

This was wonderful.  Though next time I'll add the brown sugar and spices slowly, tasting after each addition.  The other spices were a little strong.

I made this as the first course at a dinner party and everybody absolutely loved it.  The only variation I made to the original recipe was that I put twice as much yogurt in.  This was actually a total accident, but it still turned out great.  Finally, I couldn't imagine taking out the cinnamon or garlic as others have suggested.

I followed this recipe exactly and was pretty disappointed by the result.  It was too thin, and the spices didn't match well together.  They were so strong that I could barely taste the butternut squash.  Indeed, it tasted more like onion-curry-cinnamon-nutmeg soup, and I didn't need to spend an hour cooking squash to make soup that tasted like that.  I doubt I will make this one again.

I would have given this 5 stars, but it really wasn't very good until I added cream to it.  I love the taste of butternut squash, but the yogurt didn't work for me.  I followed it exactly, and it was an excellent recipe with cream!  Thanks Leslie!

This is my second time to make it for a group of 13 and they all loved it.

Pretty good recipie for what it was.  Think roasting vegetables was a great idea.  I left out the brown sugar and still thought the soup was a bit sweet.  Would've liked more curry or spicyness or something to add bite.

I saw this recipe today when I was looking for a recipe for butternut squash.  I made it and we had it as part of our evening meal.  It is delicious.  I have frozen enough for four servings which I will serve to my sister and her husband when they come to see us next weekend.  By freezing it I will have more time to spend with them but still be able to give them delicious meals

This soup is wonderful. The onions and garlic baking in the oven give off wonderful aromas. I omitted the sugar and cinnamon and added extra pepper to make it a little spicier. Delicious.

This is an excellent soup!  It's quite sweet (in fact, I'll use a little less brown sugar next time) and has a very rich aroma.  Make sure that it is pureed very well--a blender might work better than a food processor.  Also, make sure that the soup cools a bit at the end or the yogurt will curdle.  Even my 8 year old son loved this soup!

I doubled the recipe for my Bible Study group of 10. They all thought it was very tasty. I think it could of used more curry, but of course I really like spice. I plan to make this again for sure.

I have made this recipe several times, always to great reviews. I usually make a rotisserie chicken carcass broth, Roast several squash at harvest time and freeze them in quart containers. I also saute the onions and sweat the spices with the onions and garlic.

great base recipe!
I used pure coconut water, veggy broth, honey vs brown sugar, curry paste.
I tossed the squash in tomato paste, coconut oil and cracked pepper before roasting off. also roasted the carrots, celery and onion in tomato paste. 
I figure, why not?!   and roasted off a few heads of garlic as well for the soup.

Delish!

Love this soup!  I added 1/2 can coconut milk and substituted Thai yellow curry paste ( at Asian stores)  for the curry powder for more intense flavor and some heat!

The heat was perfect but it needs more flavor. Perhaps some garam masala as other recipes suggest?

This was not for us. Way too sweet, I think it was the roasted onion that made it too sweet and the cinnamon.  More like eating liquid pumpkin pie and I hate pumpkin pie.

Maybe it was the fact that I didn't puree the squash enough but it ended up just okay.

When roasting, add a touch of olive oil to the veggies.  Used chopped, bagged butternut squash.  Roast for the same amount of time as the onion and garlic, about 50 minutes.  Can use Lean Cream instead of yogurt.  Used 1/2 as much brown sugar as called for.

Gave this 4 stars because I changed a few things, but with my changes it's 5 stars. I skip the oregano, yogurt (though I tried it once with sour cream at the table but it really didn't need it) and the brown sugar (the squash is usually sweet enough), and use garam masala instead of cinnamon. I think it's a really flexible, forgiving base recipe and the two times I've made it so far it's been a huge hit. Also, I drizzle pumpkin seed oil over it at the end, along with some toasted pumpkin or squash seeds. Yum!

Very good, but I think it would have been better if I had used a larger squash.  NO where in the reviews does anyone say what size they used -- at least I couldn't find any.  Around here our butternut squashs range from 2-8 lbs.  I pick a 3lb squash but i think it should have been larger.  The large onions overwhelmed the squash flavor and 6 C broth would have been WAY too much.  I used 4 cups.  I think it's a poorly written recipes when it doesn't specifiy the amount of the main ingredient.

This soup was delicious.  I added about a 1-2" piece of ginger to the roasting veggies, used 5 cups of broth instead of 6 and used coconut milk instead of yogurt.  Otherwise did everything as per the recipe.  Delicious!  The whole family loved it :)

I am so happy to have found this soup! I recently had it at a wedding and fell in love. 
One clarification question: Does the yogurt go into the entire recipe or is it used simply as a garnish?

Fabulous flavors!  Everyone I've made this for has asked for the recipe.  And several of them would never have thought to try butternut squash soup before tasting this recipe.  Definitely a keeper, made exactly as the recipe says.

Very easy to make and tasted delicious.   Followed the recipe except left out the bay leaf (didn't have one) and served yogurt on the side (vegan request) with great reviews.

I made this and unfortunately am learning about the curdling nature of yogurt. I'm not sure if it's because it's non-fat yougurt, but pretty certain. I'm going to nix the health nut in me and either add full fat yogurt or coconut milk next time. Still a delicious flavor.

I found this soup to be far too sweet for my taste, and that was even before adding any brown sugar.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I put in less brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg, pending a taste test--I thought it sounded too sweet.  I held out the brown sugar altogether, and added a little over half of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  It looked yummy, but I took about three bites and dumped the whole pot down the drain, something I've never done before.  Seems like I'm going to have to keep looking for the perfect curry squash soup.

This soup was awesome!!! I followed the recipe of one of the other reviewers, which added cilantro and heavy whipping cream, it also didn't put the brown sugar in. I used a buttercup squash instead of the butternut that it asked for. I go to this website often to get ideas and recipes and this is by far the best recipe I've found yet! I will definitly use this one again.

This was a hit with my family. A very tasty and heartwarming recipe for a cold day.  Our family loves moderately spicy food, so I doubled all the spices and used a hot curry paste instead of curry powder.  Also, I had no plain yogurt in the house, so I added 1 tbs of fat free sour cream to each bowl of soup and garnished with a sprig of cilantro.  Will definitely add to my list of favourites.

yuck, I must have made it wrong but it had no flavour and I didn't think the roasting did anything for this soup. I will take the blame for this one though because i used chicken stock and probably didn't blend enough. i won't make it again.

Yummy!  And this is one of the healthier of the Butternut soups out there-which is why I chose to cook this one.  I also roasted an apple with the other veggies and added 1/2tsp of powdered ginger (no fresh on hand).  I used Greek yogurt (it's much more creamy) and a dollop of 1/2&1/2-which really wasn't necessary.

It was OK at first. I made the same changes suggested by SEVERAL reviewers, and it is really necessary for this soup to be good. 1) Add coconut milk during cooking, this makes an incredible difference, not a lot but enough to taste it 2) DO use the yogurt at the end ... it cuts through the soup and really MAKES the soup

This soup is pretty good.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of five because 1) I've never had squash soup before and don't have anything to compare it to, and 2) I didn't quite follow the recipe exactly.  I've made this twice, the first time I only used half a large onion and four garlic gloves b\c two whole onions and a whole head of garlic seemed like way too much.  I also added a bit of cilantro like one reviewer recommended and approx. 1/2 cup of half and half.  It turned out good but I thought the curry was too strong, and also the roasted garlic didn't . . . ahem, agree with me.  The second time I skipped the garlic all together and used half a tsp of curry instead of 1 whole tsp.  I also added a dollop of sour cream as a garnish when I served it.  I like it better the second time I think.  :-)

Really enjoyed this soup, even my brother who thinks anything with a bunch of veggies in it is bad said it was great. I did substitute the coconut milk for the yogurt as other reviewers suggested but I didn't want to waste and put an entire can which is 400ml instead of the 250ml I maybe should have to equal the amount of yogurt... I thought it was a little too much coconut. So I added a little half and half cream I had on hand to even it out a bit. I didn't measure out any of the spices and definitly added more curry and cinnamon! Will make again for sure.

mmmm warm and yummy!  I left out the oregano and brown sugar and used a 1/2 cup of whipping cream instead of yogurt.  this soup is a great way to warm up on a cool fall day.

Loved it just as is! Didn't change a thing--perfect, spicy, and comforting on a chilly autumn day.

This was my second try at butternut soup. The roasting adds all the flavor, and super easy to make. With mine I omitted the sugar and oregano, and increased the curry to 2 tsp(mild). I also used one can of condensed stock (284ml) with one can water and it was thin enough. Great base recipe to play with!

Excellent recipe. The curry and cinnamon give the flavour depth without making it too rich, which is something I find with many squash soups. I left the brown sugar out, as my husband and I are "eating clean," and my mother-in-law said it was the best soup she's tasted. Very healthy and delicious-a great combo for nourishment!

Followed the recipe exactly, but felt that there were too many other flavors overpowering the squash. In the future, I'd cut back on garlic and onion, and leave out the cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar.

Sorry, but I didn't like the taste of this soup.  The seasonings didn't work together at all.  I really wanted to like it since I was planning on serving it to my dinner guests, but in the end had to toss it.  I thought the cinnamon was too overpowering, and should not have been used with the curry powder.  I tried using the yogurt, but didn't like that tart flavor at all; using cream was better, but still not rich enough.  I've had better butternut squash soup recipes. I won't make this again.  Also, it was too thin.  Should not have used all that broth.  If you do make this soup, do various taste tests using the suggested seasonings one at a time.

I made the changes suggested by the reviewer 'exterra' and the soup was incredible.  If the original recipe included his changes my rating would undoubtedly be 5 stars. Definitely a keeper

Outstanding recipe. I did make a few small tweaks but for the most part it stands as is. I didn't add the onions because I didn't have any on-hand. And I changed the liquids a bit as I used a small squash, so I used 3 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of light cream. I also added 1 large cooked carrot to the puree. This was simply delicious and I'll definitely make it again!!!

Mm, excellent. I've made this a few times, as is, with pumpkin instead, adding an apple, etc.  It's a great recipe, and a great place to start.  I use chicken broth, instead of the vegetable broth, since it's what we usually have.  Family loves it too!

This soup was really runny, not creamy or smooth. The yogurt didnt help much either and never melted right. It stayed in tiny chunks even after mixing.

I forgot to add in the yogurt before I tasted it, but it was still good.  This soup warms you up on a cool night.  Next time I'll add more curry.

YUM!  A few things: I almost omitted the roasted garlic because I didn't have any on hand, but I'm so glad I made the trip to the store.  I think it's what really makes this soup.  Also, I didn't realize I was out of curry until it was too late, but it turned out great despite that. Like some others, I also substituted half and half for the yogurt and only 1/2 cup.  It was perfect.  A very rich soup - a bowel of this along with half a turkey and cheddar on cracked wheat and I was mighty satisfied. I love fall!

Overall good results. I was a little disappointed that more garlic flavor didn't come out, but I did double the curry and simmered it with a piece of ginger which I removed at the end.

Fantastic taste, quickly became a favorite.  Easy to make, I make it often as I am making supper to freeze for lunches.  If freezing I have found it best to leave out the yogurt until after it is re-heated.

Loved this recipe!  Used chicken broth and more squash because I had two on hand, and one reviewer said the recipe was runny.  Added a teeny more broth/curry when all was done. Left everthing else as is.  Wonderful low fat recipe! Thanks!

Be sure to add a lot more spices if you have a decent-sized butternut squash; I found that for even a medium squash the spices were not enough.

An interesting autumn soup.  We like things spicy so I added a few dashes of ground red pepper since I had only mild curry on hand.  I also added some heavy cream to give it a creamer taste (instead of adding yogurt).  My husband liked it better chilled-  I prefered it hot.

Hmm. I may have screwed this up, so it might be a good recipe. Anyway, I didn't use enough roasted garlic, which really would have upped the sweet/smoky flavour. I also used a bit too much curry, which overpowered the dish. Add the yoghurt: it's cool note really balances the curry.

The best part of making this soup was the delicious aroma of the roasting squash, onions and garlic.  Extremely flavorful and quite easy to make.  Not a drop of soup was left after I took it to a large pot-luck lunch.

Very good, very tasty. All my guests loved it. And it was fairly simple to make. This is good Holiday soup.
