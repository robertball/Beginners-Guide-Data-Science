I love parsnips and doubt there is a bad way to prepare them, but the glaze on these enhances the flavor without being obtrusive.  Stove top space was at a premium so I roasted them already cut for about 30 minutes at 400F and when cooked I added the butter and sugar to the hot pan, coating each piece, then added the teriyaki and stirred.  I put it back in the oven for another 5 or 10 minutes, stirred again to be sure I got all the glaze I could and served.  Very good!  Thank you, Lett101

My husband took one bite and said, "This is good."  Not only good, but easy and fast.  No flavors overpower the other.  The only thing I did differently was I cut up the parsnips prior to boiling.  The reason I did this is because parsnips are much larger at one end than the other and I wanted the pieces to cook more evenly.  They are not hard so it is not difficult to cut raw.  thanks for sharing!

Flavor was okay but inconsistent cooking results.
