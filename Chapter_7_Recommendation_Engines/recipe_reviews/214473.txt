These are great! I had no problem with them flattening out, I baked them for 8 minutes, left them on the pan for 2 then set them on plates. I suggest storing them with apple slices so they don't dry out.

1 package of Graham Crackers makes about 1 1/2 cups, so I used all of those and added half a cup of Nutella. I also added a Tbsp of cinnamon which REALLY helped draw out the nutty flavor. Even with the addition of ingredients I only got 24 small cookies but they were perfectly delicious!

In the future I'll use 2 cups of Nutella and add some chopped hazelnuts and chocolate chips to the mix! Thanks for the yummy dish!

This is a cookie I will definitely make again.  I just love nutella and these were exactly what I wanted.  My brother, who had never eaten nutella until now, loved these as well.  They were very easy to make, which I also liked.  If I had one complaint, it is that they seem to dry out a little faster than other cookies.  The next day after making them they were already drier and any that remained after that were very crumbly.

I was looking for a recipe to use up the jar of Nutella in my cupboard that no one was eating. I chose this recipe because it had few ingredients (all of which I had) and the most reviews!
These cookies are so,so,so good!
I added 2 tsps of cinnamon as per another reviewer. Now I might have to go buy another jar of Nutella and make these again!

Very rich, very crisp. Yet they also have a chewy texture if you bake them just perfectly--8 min worked fine in my oven.  This recipe does not make a lot of cookies at all--I got 30 cookies out of one batch, admittedly more than what the recipe states, but still not very many cookies.  They spread a lot, probably due to the oils in the Nutella, so space them out on your cookie sheet.  I was fine with six per sheet.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were definitely lacking something. I tried adding some peanut butter but it still seemed to be missing something. I love Nutella but it doesn't seem to make great cookies. I guess it should just stay as a spread. These weren't bad, and they cooked fine. Mine didn't spread out like other people have said. I just made them so I don't know how they hold up after a few days.

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, and baked for 8 minutes. Perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside! I think I made mine a little too big, so err or on the small side. The also spread quite a bit. But overall, easy (my 3 year old did all the work!) and delicious!

I thought this was very simple and the boys that I watch loved them! They don't have measuring cups or spoons so I had to improvise, I did add a little more nutella and graham crackers so there was more of a nutella taste and I had to cook it for 10 min. They didn't have baking soda so I had to use powder and only had the cinnamon and sugar graham crackers so that probably added to the taste too.

Mmm, these were delightful!  Be sure not to overbake, I think that's why others had problems with too much spreading.  I made sure not to flatten the balls at all and baked them for 7 minutes and immediately transferred to a wire rack for cooling and they were perfect.  I made mine with chocolate Teddy Grahams crumbs because that's what was in the pantry.  They were a huge hit!

good flavor, though mine turned out as flat as pancakes...very interesting ingredients.  I might make these again.  They were chewy and interesting.

Followed the basic recipe. I then divided dough in thirds to try different mix-ins. The first one I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 c. Kraft Caramel Bits. This tasted like snickerdoodles & was good! The next third I added 1/4 c. peanut butter chips & was very good if you like Reese's peanut butter cups. The last third I added about 1/4 c. Nestle Mini Chocolate Chips. If you like double chocolate it was DELICIOUS!! Crispy on outside yet chewy inside. Baked a bit longer than the original as I made the cookies larger and I actually chilled the cookie balls on the parchment lined cookie sheet for an hour before baking. Just keep a watch as to not overcook them. Definitely a keeper & will add to my recipe box. Great way to use up Nutella.

Cookies turned out delicious!
I used 1/4 Egg Beaters instead of egg, since that is what I had available. 
I was concerned that I'd lose too much Nutella in the transfer if a I measured; so, I used a full 13 oz. jar. 
After reading the reviews recommending adding cinnamon, I decided to add a tablespoon of cinnamon. 
Finally, I added a cup of Reese's Peanut Butter Chips. 
I rolled the mix into balls and flattened slightly. I cooked them for 10 minutes, since my oven tends to cook on the slower side. Perfect amount of spread. Great texture. I will make this recipe of many special occasions in the future!!! Thanks for sharing it!!!

Delicious!  I forgot the vanilla but I don't think it made any difference.  I started checking the cookies after 6 minutes and took them at 7 minutes - it was perfect.

These are really yummy, though I will likely bake them for less than 8 minutes if I make them again. I found that the bottoms didn't burn persay but they did caremalize quite a bit and I would have prefered if they hadn't. Less time in the oven will probably solve that though.

Made the recipe as written, probably should have taken more care to tweak as suggested by other reviewers.  Cookies are very flat and crispy, not strong of Nutella flavor, but tasty.

You may wonder how something with so few ingredients (no flour?) could work, but these were exceptional! I made no substitutions and I am at 7300 ft. Elevation....cooked for 7 minutes and allowed them to sit on Silpat for about two minutes.  Absolutely mouth-watering, chocolate-y deliciousness! Thanks for the recipe!

These were easy to make and not too sweet.  My teen without the sweet-tooth really liked them.  I used a silpat on a noninsulated cookie sheet and there was no spread as long as I kept the cook time to about 7 1/2 minutes.

Make sure to use Nutella, nothing else.  I tried it with a Dutch chocolate hazelnut spread... the cookies didn't taste bad or anything but they were very odd.  Tried again with Nutella, perfect.

Love this recipe! My 5 year old son gave me a very enthusiastic thumbs up for these cookies. :-) It was very easy to throw together and I had been wanting to try some cookies that have Nutella in them. Very good!

My husband recently discovered Nutella and has been bugging me ever since to make cookies with it.  This recipe was PERFECT!  So simple!  All I had on hand were cinnamon graham crackers and it was delicious.  I will definitely be making these again.

I wasn't expecting much from these cookies, but my Nutella is expiring soon. I made them thinking they'd have the texture of gingersnaps or with my luck just rocks, but they are softer with a hard chew. I really like them though. I can't get enough. I'm not sure it's a strong Nutella taste, but a scrumptious chocolatey tasting cookie. I can't stop eating them. I bet having it with milk would be delicious. It almost melts in your mouth. And such an easy recipe. I will do it again when I buy industrial sized Nutella.

I loved this recipe, it's quick and easy to make perfect for college dorms, everyone loved them though I found they didn't make very many cookies although that may be because I tend to make very large cookies. I'm definitly makeing this again SOON!

maybe I did something wrong but these all came out very thin and flat.  I tried both longer and shorter cooking times and it made no difference. 2 of my 3 kids did like the taste.

Very easy to make; quick and few ingredients. Followed recipe exactly. Husband and child loved them! I'm giving it 4 stars, not 5, only because they weren't "OMG, these are the best tasting cookies ever", however, you won't be disappointed with these if you're after a tasty, chocolaty treat.

Made as per recipe.  Dough is very sticky.  Baked up very thin and flat.  Almost impossible to remove from tray no matter how quickly or not (I used parchment).  Finished cookie was thin and crumbly, not chewy.  Did not taste like Nutella. I will not make again.

DOUBLED THE RECIPE & SOO HAPPY!! DELICIOUS!!! This is an AWESOME recipe to make with kids :) We didn't have any vanilla but they were still soft and chewy :) We also rolled a tray full in cinnamon and sugar and another tray full in icing sugar, a very nice change and the kids couldn't be happier :) :)

I only used half a cup of Nutella and I still find it too sweet! But my family loved it. Thank you for posting this!

It didn't have a good taste .Didn't really taste the nutella.  I tasted the graham cracker crumbs.  At 8 mins, they were not crispy. After 5 more minutes, the bottoms were overdone.  I would not make this again.

Love this recipe! The graham crackers and hazelnutspread made me think s'mores so I actually added bits of marshmallows! Definitely saving this!

This is the tweaking I did to the recipe: 3 eggs, 35.3 oz jar of Nutella, 3/8 tsp salt, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract, 1.5 tsp baking soda, 2 wrapped packages of cinnamon graham crackers. I highly recommend using much more Nutella than the original recipe calls for. It helps make the nutty chocolatey flavor more prominent. Next time I may add some pure cinnamon in addition to the cinnamon graham crackers. The best way to make the crumbs is to use a rolling pin, and be sure to grind them finely. My crumbs weren't fine enough and it was slightly challenging to roll the dough into compact balls because of it; the larger crumbs make the dough balls, well, crumbly. If that happens to you, don't roll the dough; squeeze it together into a ball in your hands, it sticks better that way. I used a coffee scoop (1/8 cup) to make my dough balls, which made 30-40 nicely sized cookies. Make sure you space your cookies at least 2 inches apart on the sheet, because the oils in the Nutella makes them spread farther than most other cookies. Also, save yourself the trouble and use parchment paper on your cookie sheets! They are reusable and make the whole cookie making process so much smoother. The only problem I encountered was that the cookies dried out easily. Next time I will cook them a little less (I originally did 14-15 min per 6-8 cookies) perhaps more like 12-13 min. I'll also store them with a couple apple slices or a piece of bread to add moisture. Overall, LOVED these cookies! :D

This is literally the best cookie recipe I've ever had- my roommates agree! I didn't have graham crackers so I used crushed up vanilla wafers. Delicious!

Just finished making this recipe, and I already LOVE IT!!! I made a few little changes...
Instead of using Nutella, I used Jiff's Mocha Cappuccino flavored Hazelnut Spread. (It was the only thing I had.)
Instead of a full cup of graham cracker crumbs, I used a half cup of those and a half cup of Ritz cracker crumbs and skipped the salt. 
Also, I added about a tablespoon of honey after adding the hazelnut spread. 
My changes added a little creative twist to the chocolate-hazelnut taste, which my family is loving right now! The recipe was a great inspiration and I'm so glad I found it! I will definitely use it again!

I loved these cookies. Incredibly easy, but kind of expensive for the amount of cookies it makes. In any event, great cookies with a fudgy Nutella center. It is essential that you take these out when they look like they are not done--8 minutes in my oven. Any more and they flatten out and don't taste very exceptional.

Very easy to make, nice texture, and tasted like the chocolate-hazelnut spread.  Although these were pretty good cookies, I can't say that I'd make them again since there are so many better cookie recipes that I'd prefer to spend my time and money on.
