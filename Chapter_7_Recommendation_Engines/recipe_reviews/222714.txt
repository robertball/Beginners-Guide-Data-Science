This strays pretty far from a traditional bruschetta.  Add the tomatoes to step 3 and you will essentially have a pizza sauce - bruschetta toppings are not cooked and the garlic is rubbed onto the toasted bread and not a "topping" per se. It really seems to be pizza except toasted bread is used for the crust. If you ask your taste buds, I think you will find them saying "pizza."

Scrumptious! The first batch I followed the recipe aside from doubling the balsamic vinegar. The second batch, I spread garlic butter on the baguette before roasting it, added a pinch of crushed red pepper to the tomatoes, and then mixed the mushrooms & tomatoes together. Both very delicious methods. It won’t taste like “pizza” as someone said unless you cook the toppings WAY too long. :)
