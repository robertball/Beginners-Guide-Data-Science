No WAY would I use two whole bulbs of garlic.  I used two large cloves and that was good enough for me.  Used my own homemade chicken stock from roasted chicken carcasses.  I also cut back on the Herbes De Provence (1T).  I followed the recipe directions, then as suggested by the OP to add the pasta in for 5 minutes after cooking the veggies/chicken.

Very delicious! I'd use a little less red pepper, it was on the hot side for the kids even with noodles added. I'd also cook my noodles on the side and add as desired to finished soup.

Easy â€¦ and good.  I added rosemary and thyme and used a little more chopped garlic that you purchase in the jar.
