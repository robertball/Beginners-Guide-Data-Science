These are so good!  I added roasted red pepper the veggies and also added cooked ground italian sausage  before i topped the veggies.  I was reluctant to make these  because of lack of reviews.  Now I think that's because  this recipe doesn't have a picture. I'll add one shortly.  Not only do these taste good they look even better!

Great nachos! I used an Italian blend of shredded cheese, no onion, chopped fresh seeded tomates, black sliced olives, chopped pepperocinis.  I don't like my chips in the microwave so I baked at 350 for about 6 to 8 minutes. This is a wonderful change from reg. nachos. Oh yeah I used the tostitos scoops and made them my little individual bowls stuffed to the brim with the cheese and alfredo sauce. This is a great recipe to add or subtract any of the garnishes so they never would have to be the same each time you make them.

This recipe was unbelievable!  I left out the onions.  Went to the antipasta bar and also added roasted red peppers and marinated artichokes!  One of the best nacho dishes I have ever had.  Nice combo for a change...Will make again and again..

Really good.  I baked them for about 10 minutes instead of microwaving.  You can use any variety of toppings you like.  I did the cheese, alfreado sause, sun dried tomatoes, olives, sausage, diced tomatoes and red onion.  Great!

I would take out the pepperoncini and sun dried tomoatos, too much spice. I would just add hamburger and chopped baccon, diced tomatos, black olives, chopped onion, and either some red or green bell peppers with the alfredo and mozzarella and parmesan cheese

Made this as an appetizer for a work dinner. Followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious.  I didn't get to taste too many of them because my coworkers ate the entire platter before I was done cooking the rest of the meal.

This is a great alternative to regular nachos.  To make them just like restaurant style, use an asiago cheese sauce (even use jarred,) add some shredded parm/Romano cheese.  For the chips, use wonton wrappers that you just fry up quickly in some heated oil.  Great recipe!
