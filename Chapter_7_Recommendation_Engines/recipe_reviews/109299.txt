Really really good. I did have trouble with it taking a lot longer to cook than it said. I took it out at the right time and it was not set in the middle. My error, but beware you might have to cook it longer.

I made this using the changes the second reviewer suggested.  Everything was GREAT until I tried to remove it from the pan.  With some after the fact research next time I would make it in a springform cake pan.  After baking let the cake cool in the pan (like an angel food cake).  So I am using my cake pieces with blueberries and whipped cream like a trifle.  It may look terrible but it tastes awesome.

Very very sweet and it took ages to cook. Then it fell apart because it was still very wet. Ate the pieces in a bowl with a dollop of yoghurt to cut the sweetness, and that was OK.

This is too sweet.  I think it needs a larger pan, the spring form pan might be a good idea as I was unable to remove this cake with it breaking apart.  M.Kauk, Richmond, CA

Fresh apricot tang and fluffy sweetness; I did reduce the sugars and it is just on the edge of needing more. My apricots were fully ripe, and to reduce the liquid (trying to preventing complained-about sogginess) I oven roasted them in a buttered 13x9 pan for 20 min at 425º. YUM.

I used the full amount of sugar in the egg whites and my cake has a definite chiffon cake texture, although a little gummy.  When making a chiffon cake, the leavening action comes from fully developed stiff-beaten egg whites, and you cannot reduce the sugar in this step or they can't do their thing properly.  I will try this again with the full sweeteners to see if I can get the cake itself to be successful. 

I suspect most of our commercially grown apricots are much larger and sweeter than the recipe was originally written for.

Made exactly as written except scaled back to 3 servings (made more) due to only having 4 apricots.  I had BLACK VELVET apricots and they ended up tasting very tart- almost like rhubarb.  Therefore I am glad I kept the sugar as written or it would have been unedible.
Loved the premise- I think the type of apricot that I had was wrong.

Nice cake.  I reduced the sugar a bit, but that's the only change I made to the recipe.  I put parchment on the bottom of the pan, and the cake came out easily once I slid a knife around the edge.  I used black velvet apricots and appreciated the tangy flavor.
