I have been making these for years. They are the bomb. They are better than potato skins! I sometimes serve them over potato skins.

WOW! This took me back to the '50's when my mom made what she called "cross patch" potatoes. She skipped cutting a slice from the bottoms and would just slice the cut sides in a diamond pattern, brush them with oil and sprinkle generously with freshly ground pepper and a lot of minced, fresh garlic. Yum!
