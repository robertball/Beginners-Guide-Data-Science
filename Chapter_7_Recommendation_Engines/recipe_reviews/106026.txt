Thanks for the recipe technique - I added my own stuff which made it a 5 star in my humble opinion :)

If anyone's interested, I boiled about 10 very large stalks of rhubarb in enough water to well cover them, for about 18 minutes (they were old so they were soft after 10).  I then added a small package of chopped up strawberries and a package of blueberries.  I used about 1.5 cups of white sugar, 3 Tbsp. of vanilla extract, and to thicken at the end cornstarch (mixed with water first to avoid clumping).

The smell in the house was divine and this'll go great over ice cream as a compote.  Thanks again!  Wasn't sure how to cook rhubarb or with how much sugar.

I always start with less sugar and then add if necessary, as it always seems to vary depending on the tartness of the rhubarb (or on my sweet tooth that particular day). This is something that was always a special treat my grandmother made for us and remains so to this day. I often add a little vanilla, as that was what grandma did. Although this can be eaten just as is, or served over ice cream...the way grandma served it (and the way we eat it most often) is stirred into plain yogurt...in those days there were no flavored yogurts and so this was a special treat to make plain yogurt good. Now we just eat it with plain yogurt because it is just plain good that way!! Try it...way better than any fruit flavored yogurt you'll get in a store! (although I suspect you shouldn't compare calories;)

One quarter to one half cup of water, cover and simmer, suffices to draw all the water from the fruit into the pan that you need. Otherwise, you end up with a nice rhubarb BEVERAGE.

One of the wonderful things about spring is fresh rhubarb, and I have been stewing it for a long time. I have never added cinnamon or fresh cut-up strawberries (as one of the other reviewers suggested) and I thought both added to the flavour. To save time, I cook the rhubarb (about 3 cups) in the microwave, in a high-sided dish with a lid. To the diced rhubarb, I add just enough water to cover the bottom, cover, and cook until the rhubarb is soft (usually less then 5 minutes), then I add the sugar to taste (and this time, I put in strawberries and cinnamon as well).

Very good taste to this recipe.  I only used 2 cups of sugar and it was sweetened perfectly.

HA! So interesting that last reviewer suggested using kitchen shears/scissors for cutting the rhubarb - I just discovered this trick tonight and it worked GREAT (and quick!).  My rhubarb is stewing as I type and I was scrolling for a recipe for the remaining rhubarb when I stumbled on this one.  My recipe is the same, except I vary it.  Tonight I omitted the cinnamon and added fresh grated orange rind and juice...delightful with homemade toast in the morning!

Excellent, just like my father used to make for me 40 years ago.  Delicious over a good quality vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty with the addition of cinnamon, though it is definately too sweet.  Used 2 1/2 cups of sugar and found it to be to much, will try again and use next time.  This is really good over cheap vanilla ice cream (for some reason I think the cheap stuff tastes better with rhubarb!)

I followed your recipe today and it is like rhubarb soup!  Way too much water.  I am now trying to figure out what I should do with a pot filled with rhubarb flavored water....

I do love stewed rhubarb though, I normally make it with frozen rhubarb... next time I will not put anywhere near the amount of water.  I also used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 3 cups of white.  To take the edge off the rhubarb toss in a tablespoon of baking soda.

This is a comfort food for me. Brings back memories of summers at Grandma's and an endless supply of rhubbarb. Instead of adding sugar, I use a few packets of sugar free cherry gelatin-this eliminates the sugar and tastes great!

Great recipe, so easy. I sometimes add Grand Marnier and Orange Juice and have it with cream for a wicked dessert.  
Tip: Use chicken scissors to cut the rhubarb.

Smashing recipe.  I used to have this with custard - even in the Forces - until 1946.  It's the only favourite which my mothere never taught me!

So yummy!  I just made this and I followed the advice of others to start low on the sugar, taste and adjust.  (Of course it tasted so good I was doing more tasting and less adjusting...)I like my rhurarb pretty tangy, and I had added a handful of strawberries, so I only used 1 cup of sugar.

I also found that it required way to much water.  I had to let my cook for 90 minutes so that it wasn't soupy and was nice and thick.

What a superb recipe, though as several other reviewers pointed out--adjust sugar to personal tastes as rhubarb tends to be  'sweeter' earlier in the year. I used less sugar and added a splash of vanilla at the end..  As suggested by TraceyT--this is wonderful mixed w/ homemade plain yogurt.  Thanks for a great idea!

This isn't really what i was looking for. The flavor was ok, but it was way to thin for us. So i ended up simmering & low boiling for 3.5 hrs to get the recipe a bit thicker. Then we just ate it warm.

For those that did not know what to do with all the cooked rhubarb water; it makes a very refreshing  summer beverage. Just add more water and sugar.

I'm not sure what happened...I added just under enough water to cover the rhubarb but it is REALLY watery now! I even added cornstarch to try to thicken it but it doesn't seem to be working.
I will try this again though.

Thanks for this recipe it is delicious.  I did make a couple of minor changes, less water (approx. 1 cup instead of enough to cover) and also less sugar..we like it a little tart!!  The cinnamon was a nice touch!.  Will definitely make this again, we have an abundance of rhubarb in the spring! Yummy!

Stewed rhubarb has long been a favourite in our family. We only add enough water to cover the bottom of the pot though, not most of the rhubarb, so the amount called for in the recipe sounds like too much. We also add sugar to taste near the end of the cooking. Resist the urge to add other fruits like another reviewer said. Stewed rhubarb should only have rhubarb. Anything else is a fruit compote, and is not as this recipe is intended. So delicious.

Made this yesterday with  5 stalks of rhubarb fresh from my friend's garden ~ easier than falling off a log;  followed the directions, cooled it and put a spoonful or two over yogurt.  YUM!  Will be making rhubarb/apple crisp when apple prices are better.

I tried adding the orange juice with a little of the orange zest without the cinnamon.  Really good!
