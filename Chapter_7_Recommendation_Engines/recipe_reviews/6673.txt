I designed this bread. There were several changes made by the website that were not part of my original submission: 1) in my recipe I used sun-dried tomato sprinkles from Trader Joe's. If using sun-dried in oil, I would use additional and add some herbs (also not in my recipe). 2)I never used Amaranth in the bread, but did add some wheat bran or oat bran. My recipe was so good, I made a loaf every Sunday for about 6 months, I was so addicted to it.

I do not have a bread machine, but made this recipe by hand - it turned out really well.  First dissolve the yeast in 1 cup warm water, then add the rest of ingredients in order listed.  Allow to rise for 1 hour until doubled, then punch down.  Allow to rest on baking sheet for 15 minutes.  Cook at 375 for 25-30 minutes until lightly browned.

This bread is delicious.  I only had oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes so I rinsed them in hot water first ... it worked great!  I'll be making this again and again - the whole family loved it!  Thanks Marlene!

This recipe serves as an excellent base to use your imagination when it comes to adding ingredients to taste.  As written, it would be a bit too bland for me but with tweaks, it was delicious.  I don't have a bread machine so did this by hand.  Plumped about 8 sundried tomatoes in 1 cup of water and used the water for plumping, in the bread.  Also crushed 2 cloves of garlic, added double (at least) asiago, and also added parmesan.  Didn't have amaranth flour so used spelt.  Any kind of nutty, earthy flour can be used to replace the Amaranth. Tuscan blend seasoning for the basil.  This took about 75 minutes to proof on the first rising, and about 50 minutes on the second.  Baked at 400 for 30 minutes and it produced a beautiful loaf soft on the inside.  Make sure that you don't chop the tomatoes too fine..they get lost in the bread.  I'm glad I had some in larger pieces.  Veriations are endless.  Could also throw in some calamata olives.  This is sure to compliment any Mediterranean or Italian based dinner.  The color is lovely with using the water from the tomatoes.  Thanks for this recipe which is sure to please DH.

Now this was right up my alley!  What a beautiful, delicious, artisan-type bread! I used only 1-1/2 tsp. of sugar because that's my preference (don't like any sweet taste in my bread), 1-1/2 tsp. of bread machine yeast and all bread flour. I used a very good quality fresh Asiago and 1-1/2 tsp. of my favorite Tuscan seasoning. I really don't like moist, overly fluffy, smooshy breads and this bread is SO not like that! This bread would make wonderful croutons, crostini, bruschetta, panini (mmmm, chicken, provolone and pesto!) or even grilled cheese, but it is so flavorful, so delicious on its own. Just a great recipe!

This is our family's favorite!  The asiago cheese adds such a distinctive, delicious flavor!  I substitute the wheat bran, as suggested and it always turns out great!

This is the best bread I have ever made....absolutely delicious.  You HAVE to follow the recipe exactly and use the special flour that it calls for.....you are missing out on this bread's fantastic taste if you just use bread flour and skip the other.  You'll have to find it in a gourmet food or natural foods market.  Make sure you use GOOD Asiago cheese and be generous with it.......be generous with the sun-dried tomato as well.  I think those two ingredients should be listed in larger quantities, I added extra.  YUMMY, YUMMY BREAD!!!!!  WHAT A HIT!  My husband devoured this!!!!

I have no sun-dried tomatoes so substituted tomato juice for the water.I also used Permesan instead of Asiago, whole wheat flour instead of the amaranth flour,and added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder(it flavoured the bread so much! you will love it!).I made it by hand, shape it into buns, and bake in 180 degree C for 18 mins.I brush it with tomato juice several times while it's baking.Finally it came out excellent-looks and smells like real tomatoes.We eat up all the buns that it just out from the oven for 30 mins.It's my favorite herb bread.Thanks Marlene!

Beautiful coloring!  Made it twice in the last day.  Love this bread and the kids loved it to.  (surprising)  I think I will add Fresh Garlic next time to give it an additional kick.  Yummy

It's a buttery textured bread that's really flavorful.

I don't have a bread machine so I am used to letting breads rise and then punching down. This one takes a little longer to double in size.

Made a few adjustments, the result being a rich, flavorful, appealing loaf of bread.  Substituted tomato juice for water (and heated it for 15-20 seconds in high wattage microwave to get to 100 degrees in order to activate yeast).  Added 1/2 t garlic powder, included 1 t ground Italian seasoning, used a full jar of sundried tomatoes from the store (rinsed clean from the oil they were packed in in the jar), 3/4 cup Asiago in the dough and additional Asiago sprinkled on top of loaf prior to baking.  Used bread flour instead of all-purpose flour.  It's a good idea because bread flour tends to rise higher than all-purpose, and with this combo of ingredients even the bread flour didn't rise as high as it does with non-intricate bread recipes.

I make all bread loaves by hand, and if you haven't read any other of my bread reviews here it is:  mix all ingredients together, knead like heck on floured surface.  Oil a bowl & put in the bread dough.  Zap your microwave for 60 seconds with nothing in it to get it warm, then cover the dough bowl with a damp cloth and put inside warm microwave for 45-60 minutes.  Take dough out, punch down and let sit a few minutes.  Knead like heck again.  Grease or cooking spray your loaf pan, shape bread into loaf size and put in loaf pan.  Let rise a second time (in warmed microwave again) for 45-60 minutes.  Heat oven to 350 F.  For this recipe bake for 25-30 minutes.  Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto cooling rack to finish cooling.

Love this bread! I took a combination of other reviewers suggestions and combined them.  I did not use the powdered milk, it's not something I keep in the house or will use for anything else. Never heard of amaranth flour just used all flour, but the wheat germ does sound interesting, may try next time.  I used 8 sundried tomatoes and plumped them in the 1 cup water and used that water for the bread (Other reviewers suggestion).  I increased the yeast to 1 1/4 t (another suggestion) we like a fluffier bread. Added 1 crushed clove of garlic and doubled cheese for inside of bread (more suggestions).  I subbed the oil from a jar of sundried tomatoes I had in the fridge (my idea).  I don't have a bread machine so did it in the KA and baked at 350 and it took about 40 mins. I grated extra Asiago on top and it got pretty brown at 40 mins, may hold off on adding half way through baking next time. Served it with a Marsala type dinner and it was wonderful sopping up the gravy with. Absolutely making again.

This was sooo good. I just got the Breadman Ultra and this is the first loaf that turned out right!! I also live at 7000 ft, but didn't have to adjust anything for altitude.  I used all bread flour.  Next time, I'll probably try it with more cheese and I will select "Light" for the crust.  I'll also try to sprinkle more cheese on top before the bake cycle begins.

I will admit to not following the recipe due to a lack of ingredients and other reviewers' suggestions.  I used 1 cup warm milk instead of water, no powdered milk, 3 cups white flour, 4 Tbsp chopped sun dried tomatoes, 1/3 cup Parm/Asiago mix, the optional basil, 1/2 tsp garlic, and 1 1/4 tsp yeast.  I used the light cycle.  It was wonderful and I can only imagine it would be better with a different flour.

Very good!  I didn't have amaranth flour, so I just used bread flour for the entire recipe.

I thought it made a very tasty and beatiful bread. My kids liked it also, my husband not so much. He said something taste odd about it but I think he just doesn't like Asiago cheese in this bread. I used sun-dried toms from a jar cause we do not have Trader Joes up here (I live on a island in AK) we also don't have amaranth flour so I used bread. I will make again and I think I will double the sundried tomatoes. When I return to the lower 48 I will make it with the sundried tomato flakes that Marlene used. Ty for the recipe!

This was quite delicious.  I have a bread machine, but I decided to make it with my KA. The blend of flavors was perfect.  I did use the wheat bran instead of the amaranth flour because it is what I had on hand.  The inside was soft and the outside had a nice crust.  I highly recommend trying this recipe.

I made this for a potluck last Sunday. Really tasted great! I used almost a half jar of sun dried tomatoes (rinsed and chopped fine)and pushed the Asiago cheese to 1/2c. Also added 1/2t of garlic powder. The Amaranth flour was good, good and expensive that is... $11.00 a pound here in Hawaii! But did taste good. **UPDATE** I've been making this for my customers and it is a BIG hit. I double the recipe and divide into 2 for regular sized boules or 3 for a slightly smaller boule. Some people just cant eat that much bread before it goes bad.

This is so good!  The kids loved it, said it tasted/smelled like pizza.  I love asiago cheese so I used extra.  Next time I'll save some to put in at the end so I'll get some chunks of cheese in the finished bread.  I did add a little bit of garlic like another reviewed said.  I'll be making this bread a lot!

Incredibly delightful! Used WAY more Asiago and sundried tomatoes as I don't think the flavors would have been detected with the amounts in the recipe as written.  Very rustic looking loaf jam packed with intense yumminess!  Thank you for posting the recipe!

This bread is delicious companion to just about any meal and makes for great sandwiches too.  I sprinkled additional cheese on the top of the loaf just before it began to bake.

Even though it wasn't clear what temp. the water should be, I took a chance that it should be warm(110 degrees).  I used 3 cups of bread flour and omitted the pepper.  It came out delicious.  It was so soft and full of flavor.

Delicious! I removed the dough from the bread machine and then baked it a traditional loaf pan. Next time I will form it into two smaller rustic loaves. My husband and I both really loved this bread! Kind of costly to buy the Amaranth flour and a good asiago cheese, but worth it!

This bread is AWSOME! I used my bead maker on the dough setting then I kneaded it one more time, formed it into a loaf and let it rise for another hour on a floured baking sheet. Before baking I scored the top, brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled with rock salt. Baked in a 400degree oven for about 30 mins. I too added more tomato and asiago than directed. I cut some of the asiago into small chunks so you would be able to see it in the bread. I also added two cloves of garlic. This bread is easy and delicious. Also looks awesome when it comes out of the oven. Great toasted with butter!

I had no powdered milk on hand and at the store they had a giant size for $20. Wasn't sure that I would use it all, so I substituted 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup water for the 1 cup of water and 2 tbsp powdered milk. Unfortunately, I could not find amaranth flour, or even anything close with a nutty flavor (we live in a small area with specialty stores being a bit of a drive), so I had to substitute whole wheat flour. I doubled the cheese, but used a combination of Asiago and Parmesan (freshly shredded of course). I also doubled the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I chose to also add the optional basil as it is one of my favorite spices. This is good bread, but next time I really want to try it with the amaranth flour (or a close alternative, like quinoa) mainly because of the health benefits. I have also read that you can substitute nut flours for powdered milk. That sounds interesting as it would add more protein. This is why I love cooking and baking, the options are only limited to your imagination!

The bread alone is nothing special but it becomes delicious after you slice it, toast it, and butter it! I used spelt flour instead of the amaranth and added extra cheese. I would recommend using a light crust setting.

I love this bread!! I'm giving it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.. Had no amaranth flour so I used semolina, used parmesan instead of asiago, added lots n lots of Italian herb mix, n topped it with mozzarella.
I also made it by hand, kneeded it for 10 minutes, shaped it into sticks, then let it rise until doubled before baking.

I used my breadmaker and followed the instructions exactly, but it was pretty dry and tasteless. Perhaps it doesn't work with all different types of breadmakers, I'm not sure.

I followed this recipe but made a lot of changes to it also.  I didn't use a bread machine to make this bread and I also made it into breadsticks.  I also didn't use the powdered milk and I used wheat bran instead of the amaranth flour and I used sun dried tomatoes in oil.  I also used parmesan cheese instead of asiago.  I baked the breadsticks at 425 for 10 minutes.  It's a great recipe.

OK, need to add my 2 cents.  Pretty much followed receipe. From other reviews I decided to use the olive oil from sun dried tomatoes packed in oil (olive oil w/Italian seasoning).  Used about 3 heaping tablespoons of julienned sun dried  tomatoes in oil (didn't rinse). Also, instead of basil used Italian seasoning. Didn't think 1 tsp of yeast was enough -used 2. (the receipe book for my Breadman said for 3 cups of flour to use 2 tsp yeast). I did increase the Asiago cheese to about 1/2 C as I didn't know what to do with the rest of it (next time I will buy the grated parmesan with asiago - it's quite a bit cheaper.) Anyway, it turned out great. To the author:  I apologize for the changes. Per author, I used bran instead of amaranth.

I don't have a bread machine, so I had to make it by hand. I didn't have powdered milk or amaranth flour, so I  increased my all-purpose flour to almost 3 cups. I'm thinking this is too much, because the ingredients were difficult to mix (it was too dry). I added almost 1/2 C asiago cheese & although some suggested to add this much, I'd suggest to divide it in half - 1/2 while mixing the dry ingredients & the rest just before baking/on the top. Adding 1/2 C of asiago cheese before kneading made me lose a lot of the asiago cheese when I kneaded the dough on the floured surface.  I also suggest adding other ingredients; Besides the asiago cheese & sundried tomatoes, I added fresh chopped basil, dried oregano, minced garlic- & it all gave a great aroma. The green dried herbs/fresh basil & red sundried tomatoes make it even appropriate for the holidays.

So delicious! I didn't have Asiago so I subbed freshly ground parmesan. Added a 4 cheese Italian blend (we like it really cheesy) and used my Italian Herb Grinder very generously. My new favorite cheese bread! Thanks.

These were much more dense than anticipated and not nearly as flavorful. Next time I will play around and add more herbs, garlic, and let it rise for a longer period of time.

This is a great sandwich bread recipe.  I didn't have the amaranth flour or the powdered milk, but it still turned out very tasty.  From what I've read, the powdered milk is a preservative of sorts for the bread and since we eat it within a few days, we usually don't need to worry about it going stale!

I made this earlier this week but forgot to review it.  I don't have amaranth flour or wheat bran--I just used wheat flour.  It worked just fine. Subbed mozzarella cheese for the asiago cheese and I used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, so I only put one tablespoon of oil in.  I think next time I'll eliminate the oil entirely.  I made the dough in my bread machine then shaped into a round loaf and baked in the oven.  Very good bread!  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

This is very good bread! I have made it many, many times. It's great with soup. I have also buttered several slices with butter and garlic and put it under the broiler---what a treat!!!

This looked really small cooking and I was concerned that the 1teaspoon of yeast was not enough.  It seemed to brown more on top as well.  

I had no reason to be concerned.  I brushed butter on the outside like I always do and cut it still warm.  It is soft tender and wonderful tasting with a hint of sweetness.  

I ended up ordering amaranth flour because I could not find it locally.  I used sun dried tomatoes in olive oil and just minced them without rinsing.  

This was great.  I can see where it would make nice rolls or breadsticks.

I didn't find this to live up to the reviews it had received.  I barely taste the tomato or the asiago.  After the first piece, my husband didn't touch it.  It's a nice bread, but nothing special and not the "wow" I was expecting.

Maybe this didn't reach it's potential because I didn't use a bread maker but I baked it @375 for 30min and it was heavy and chewy in the middle so I put it back in @350 for 10 min and it still didn't work.  If I do this again, I'll do 2 small loaves and omit the pepper.

I used red wheat bran. The bran and the tomatoes made a very pretty colour. Fresh the bread had a faint tomato taste. The flavours really came out the next day. I will make it again, maybe with some garlic. I made it entirely in the machine: it made a small loaf (not a lot of rising time for one tsp of yeast?) It had a soft, chewy texture.

Huge disappointment! It was pink-ish/orange bread, no cheese or herb flavor at all. I put in the basil and upped the cheese to a generous 1/3cup because those are both flavors we enjoy. I was expecting this to be delicious and it was just colored bread.

I made this but with grated Parmesan instead because I didn't have Asagio and it still turned out great! I used sun-dried tomatoes that I dried myself in the dehydrator when I had an abundance of tomatoes. I just crumpled them up and added everything at one. Bread had a great flavor and nice orangish reddish color. Made great sandwiches!

this is YUMMY bread - I used milk instead of water, wheat flour instead of amaranth (whatever that is)
I used a whole packet of yeast vs. the 1 tsp.
used the 1 pound setting on my bread maker and it turned out great!!

A great bread, but I felt it was missing something (maybe a nuttier flour as stated by others). I used white and wheat bread flour (what I had), 4Tbs sun dried tomatoes, 1/2cup asiago, 1/2tsp garlic powder, and 1.5tsp yeast to make it less dense. After looking at my dough in the machine and seeing that it hadn't risen much, I remembered the reviews about longer rise times, so I hit the pause button on my machine 2x's. This loaf should be cooked at 1.5 lb and a light crust. My crust was very dark on the medium crust setting. I'll definitely make this again, and tinker with it to try figuring out what that missing taste is...

A bit dense but still very tasty. This bread is great for dipping. I cut it up into little squares and served it with spinach dip and melted fondue cheese.
