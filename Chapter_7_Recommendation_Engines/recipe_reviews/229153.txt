These are so easy and taste just like the smores you make while camping.  I made them for a cookie exchange and they were a hit.  Let them chill completely before cutting and make sure to use a serrated knife.

So yummy. Broke up 3 Hersey bars because I had no milk chocolate chips and used mini semi sweet chocolate chips to add in later. So good and sticky!

Just not good. Too many marshmallows. They overpowered the whole thing. I'm sure a variation of this could be tasty. But as written, I won't use this again.

If you want a s'more like treat this fits the bill. Easy enough to make but looses its appeal when the remaining chips and marshmallows are added because they melt into the already melted ingredients. Next time I'm freezing all the  chips so they are extra cold and will not add any as indicated in step 2.  Once the graham crackers are coated with melted marshmallow I'll lay the mix in blobs into the pan and when cool enough I will press the chips and extra marshmallows throughout and then press it down to set up.

Super easy. This was gobbled up (more by the adults than the kids for some reason). One thing I did was chop up a large hershey bar and sprinkle and press the bits on top after I put all the goop into the pan. That way there was guaranteed to be solid chunks of chocolate in everyone's piece (since a lot of the chocolate melts, unlike the marshmallows that you put in at the end). The real hershey bar(s) make it seem extra s'more-y, too. Tastes a lot like a less dense s'more fudge. Delicious.

Made this recipe without any changes for a church dinner for teens. Simple, easy and very tasty. In fact, they were a hit! Most teens returned to take substantially more than one "serving".

These are delicious! I've also substituted a few cups of graham cracker cereal. Less prep and a bit easier to cut them smaller without as much crumbling. Nice for littler mouths (and portion control - if there is such a thing where s'mores are concerned).

I had been having a massive craving for s'mores.  I had some variation of all the ingredients at home, so I made these up.  I pressed them a tad too firmly into the pan but they still tasted great.  I didn't have mini, so I cut up marshmallows (no easy feat!).  I'll make it again for sure!

Easy! Fast! I swapped in Teddy Grahams (honey) (1 box) instead and used real hershey's (3 full sized bars) and threw in some colored marshmallows for the last 2 cups and topped it off with a spattering of mini M&Ms and Teddy Grahams on top. 
I made a double batch. If you do, I recommend splitting the melted choc/marshmallow stuff when you need to mix in the dry goods. but have someone else ready to mix with you. or else do the batches separately. It is hard to get all the gooeyness on all the stuff equally with a double batch.
Once you start, you can't stop the cooking process for any child's emergent needs.

Hard to get the melted marshmallow blob to incorporate the additions (chocolate chips, marshmallows, bits of graham crackers). It falls apart easily - especially upon being cut - and the cutting process left some deep scratches in my bamboo cutting board. This is not cookie making but candy making, and there's a big difference... The recipe should really clarify that the marshmallows have to reach a stage where they are melted into a shiny paste, like silk, and at that stage should the chocolate be added. THEN, this confection would come out chewy (as I suppose it should come out) instead of hard and dry. Found that out by many trials (and errors) since I had tripled the quantity of ingredients for a potluck.
