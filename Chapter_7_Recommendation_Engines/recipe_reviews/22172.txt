ABSOLUTELY SUPERB.   I DID ADD ABOUT 1/4 CUP OF SALSA TO THE BEAN/BEEF MIXTURE AND DID PUT PICANTE SAUCE ON THE TOP TORTILLA SHELL(OR YOU COULD USE A COUPLE TABLESPOONS OF SALSA IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS)  UNDER THE CHEESE.   BETTER THAN TACO BELL,  REALLY GREAT FILILNG DINNER!!! DEFINITELY WILL MAKE AGAIN.    THANKS FOR SHARING!!

very good. i feel it's missing enchilada sauce but it was still yummy without it. next time i might warm up the tortillas a little on the stove top to get them a little bit crispier. besides that i really enjoyed.

This was wonderful, super easy and tasty!  The next day we used the leftovers for lunch with a couple changes -- smaller tortillas, Mexican cheese rather than cheddar, and we were out of the meat mixture. It was still really good!!

We thought this was just great! All I did different since I didn't have a pan big enough for two pizzas was to just layer them on top of each other with more filling in between. We topped these with salsa and sour cream and they were sooo good! It really hit the spot! My husband has even said we should add this to our regular meals. Thanks for a great recipe!

What a wonderful recipe.  I had some leftover venison & beef roasts that I wanted to use up so I shredded them & heated with taco seasoning.  I did put just a little bit of EVOO on the tortillas & crisped them a little on a super hot griddle.  The next time I made them I put some salsa on top of the meat layer & they turned out great that way too!

Super easy, and my family loved it! I ended up using impossible meat just for fun, and my beef loving husband was a huge fan! I didn’t tell him what it was until he was on his 3rd piece!

Very, very good.  It’s hard for me to cook a lot of the recipes I find.  Just me in the house.  This is very easy and dare I say it’s even good the next day cold!!

I crisped the tortillas in the oven before adding the toppings. These were easy and delicious. Nice change from taco night. Definitely will make again!!

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I did add a bit of salsa to the beef and bean mixture and I ran the tortillas through a hot skillet beforehand just to add a little crunch. My husband loved it!! Quick and easy....a nice alternative to taco night.

Yes, I did make some changes to this recipe. Actually I pan fried the 10" tortillas in a skillet with a touch of olive oil for extra crunch!! Then assembled.with a layer of chopped green scallions  Baked. Then as a topping for it used sour cream,lettuce, fresh jalapeño salsa verde and fresh tomato salsa, couple of avacado slices and a few manzanilla olives!! It was Awesome!! ????

I halved the recipe and it was enough for two people with a slice left for leftovers. After I put the water and taco seasonings into the pan with the cooked beef I let it simmer for about 10 minutes so the liquid and flavor was absorbed then added the refried beans to the pan along with about 1/2 cup of fresh salsa and mixed it all together to heat up. sprayed a cookie sheet with Pam, covered one tortilla with bean/beef/salsa mixture and about a cup of cheddar cheese then second tortilla topped with the remaining Mexican cheese and baked for ten minutes as instructed. Topped with sour cream, olives, and tomatoes and it was DELICIOUS! (added a few diced pickled jalapeño's on top of mine for some heat)

Great recipe - very easy and a nice change to our usual taco dinner. I made a few modifications to the recipe: 1) used ground chicken instead of beef for taco meat; 2) used black beans instead of refried beans (rinsed them before adding to taco meat); and 3) added cheddar cheese and a mexican cheese blend on top of the meat before putting the top tortilla on. I still put both cheese on top of the tortilla, as the recipe calls for, but only a little since I used the cheese on the inside. For our dipping "sauce", we used sour cream, salsa and green chiles. Delish!

The only downfall to the recipe is that the bottom tortilla didn't get very hard and pizza crust-like so it made the slices a little messy to pick up and eat.

Used my own fresh pizza dough, and pre-baked it at 400 for 8 minutes, then spread on a thin layer of olive oil and some mild salsa and added the refried bean-ground beef mixture. Baked for 10 minutes, then let it sit for 5 minutes. Finally added the fresh toppings. It is mildly flavored, and for those who like it smoking hot, probably more taco seasoning or maybe extra spices. It definitely needed some salt!

I was very excited about this recipe but it just didn't live up to the Taco Bell standard! If I ever crave a Mexican Pizza I will just go to Taco Bell.

I was a little nervous about not pre-baking the tortillas first, but always like to try the recipes as written first!  The recipe was great just as written!!!  I did like many others and served up the toppings in separate bowls so they could add what they liked!  This will definitely be made again!!!

Very tasty and simple.  We cut the beans down to one can and stilly had plenty of filling.  It's easy to adjust to different tastes with more or less toppings, cheese, or filling.  Definitely better than Taco Bell.

We had tacos last night and there was a some taco meat leftover and this was a great recipe to use for the next day's lunch.  Just used the leftover meat and mixed with the refried beans and followed the rest of the recipe.  It was quick and easy and made just enough for lunch and let me use the leftover meat in a new way.  Thought this was very good and so did husband and kids which isn't always easy to please all three.

This was an AWESOME idea.. I just wish I'd used smaller tortillas.  They didn't crisp up as well as I would have liked in the oven (could be my oven too).  Was a nice twist on mexican food for us that was easy and easier cleanup than just tacos or burritos.  I think I'll make this again regularly.

Good recipe!  I did a layer of refried beans and a layer of seasoned ground beef on the bottom tortilla.  I added a layer of picante sauce, cheese, and tomatos to the top tortilla.  We were looking for something equivalant to the Taco Bell mexican pizzas and these came out much better! Thanks!

It was ginormous! Incredibly easy to make and customize.  I don't know if it was better than taco bell, but it was up there. thanks!

These Mexican Pizza's were so good. They were a hit! They were so good and were way better than Taco Bell's. I used to work for them and I put some tomatos w/Green Chilis on top with the Scallions and they were a huge hit with everybody I had to make more when i ran out.

These were wonderful!  I love that this recipe calls for the beans and meat to be mixed together.  That made them very better than others.  I made them with homemade flour tortillas which also made them great.  I will agree with a previous reviewer's comment: these are better than Taco Bell's!

This was ok - Id have to fry the tortilla's for it to be like Taco Bells. I put taco sauce on the last layer of tortillas before I put the cheese on. i make might it again if Ive got nothing better.
