Someone wanted to know how to make this without a bread machine, here is how. Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl. Mix in the sugar, margarine, salt, and eggs. Add flour and mix well. Knead the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with flour. Put in a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Then pick up with rolling out the dough. Hope this helped!

These are fantastic cinnamon rolls but I have yet to see people suggest the key part to these rolls!  As soon as you take them out of the oven you need to flip the pan over which allows all of the yummy cinnamon drippings to recoat the rolls.  I have heard a lot of you state that the filling has simply run out of the rolls.  This alleviates that and makes them to die for.  Good luck!

These are fantastic! It's a fairly quick and easy recipe as far as cinnamon buns go, and you definitely DON'T NEED A BREAD MACHINE to make them.  Just use an 8 gram pack of dry active yeast instead of the bread machine yeast and knead the dough with your hands and a rolling pin. Then heat the oven to 200 degrees and then TURN IT OFF. COVER the dough with a moist paper towel over the bowl, and put in the oven for around 1 hour (the dough will almost double in size) then roll out and fill.  Use dental floss to cut buns into 12 pieces (1 and 3/4 inch thick). Also, some reviews mentioned that there was too much brown sugar and cinnamon, but i would recommend sticking with what the recipe calls for...double the amount of icing though!!
Also, you can use butter or margarine in the recipe, both are equally as good (i use both when i make them).  When you bake them, line your pan with wax paper that has been greased with butter or margarine, and remove them immediately after baking, or they will stick.  Bake at 350 for 20 minutes and they will turn out perfect.  This recipe rocks : )

These are really good. I experimented with my batch and found that after shaping the rolls and placing them in the greased pan, they could rest, covered, in the fridge overnight.  In the morning, simply place them into the preheated oven to bake--a very fast breakfast.  The unbaked rolls also freeze well (I used 2 8-inch square disposable pans and put 6 rolls in each pan.)  The night before, simply put the pan into the fridge.  In the morning, they're ready for the oven.  Easy and great to have on a cold morning.  I was a little concerned that they didn't look doubled before I baked them this way, but they rose perfectly in the oven.  Sure beats having to get up 3 hours before breakfast!

I make these to the point where they are placed in the baking dish, then I cover them with plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator for the night.  The next day, they go into a COLD oven (minus the plastic wrap!).  Turn up the heat to 350 and bake for 25-30 minutes.  There is no need to let them sit out.  I do this with other yeast rolls and breads.  Also, I made the frosting (used Neuchatel cheese - less fat), dropped it by spoonfuls (enough for 1-2 rolls) onto wax paper, froze them, then removed the frosting drops and wrapped them individually in plastic wrap.  These all went into a plastic bag and back to the freezer until needed.  This way you can use all of the 8 oz package of creamed cheese (2/3 c butter, 4 c powdered sugar, 1-1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 tsp salt).  The extra rolls, if you have any, are frozen and reheated in the microwave (these are really good reheated).  This is where the frozen frosting comes in handy.  It doesn't take much heat to thaw the frosting.

Prevent leaky filling! From a former Cinnabon employee...Leave a 1/4" margin at the far side of dough b4 buttering. This will allow a better seal (dough-to-dough) when done rolling. After spreading the filling over the soft butter, use rolling pin and roll over the sugar/ cinn mix a couple times before rolling up your rolls. Then make sure to roll up tightly, under-tucking after each completed rollover. Work from middle to edges as you roll.

Lining your pan w/ parchment allows you to scrape up the juices (we always had people who wanted extra goo instead of xtra frosting!)

A tip on frosting...1/2 of the frosting went on hot rolls, as soon as they came out. They sat for a few minutes and then got the rest of it. That makes for the sticky/ moist roll w/ intact frosting that so many know and love.

Not a cinnabon, but very good!  We have already made this recipe twice and I just downloaded it three days ago!  I have a few suggestions though...1 T. of cinnamon was plenty.  Also, we did one batch in a glass dish and the other in a metal cake pan and the glass dish batch turned out better.  Finally, we mixed the butter with the cinnamon and sugar and then spread it on in our first batch.  They turned out great and it was easier to do it this way.  The batch where we spread the butter on first and then sprinkled the sugar mixture over the top wasn't as good because the sauce ran out the bottom and crystalized on the bottom of the pan.  Still good, but not as good.  The icing was delicious!  I licked every spoon and beater clean!

I loved this recipe! Since I don't have a bread machine, (mainly because I like to make a lot at once), I doubled this recipe. I dissolved the milk and sugar then added the yeast. I let that get foamy on the top, then added the salt, eggs, and oil. I used a regular mixer to mix that mixture in with the flour a little at a time. Then, switched to bread hooks to continue kneading. When it was mixed well enough, I finished kneading by hand. A good trick to keep it from sticking or becoming too dry is to use butter flavored cooking spray instead of flour. After it was ready, I let it rise and continued with the rest of the recipe as usual. They were so delicious and soft. Freeze cinnamon rolls. Then you can pop them out of the freezer, put them in the microwave, and they taste fresh from the oven!!

My skinny father in law ate 6 batches of these in a little over a week.  They're really good and have made me a popular gal at potlucks and brunches.  I do like to cut down a little on the sugar in the dough.  Be careful when substituting all purpose flour for bread flour!  The all purpose has less protein and absorbs less fluid which means you'll need to add a little more to keep the dough from being too soft.  Also, don't over-rise your all purpose dough.  It's not as strong as dough made with bread flour and falls easier.  Also, I have experimented with butter vs margarine.  Since margarine has hydrogenated oil and butter doesn't, the margarine lightens the texture of the bread.  If you're out of margarine, try using some shortening.  It works better than butter.  They came out lightest when they were baked on a pizza stone.

This recipe is simply amazing!I read the reviews first since I dont own a bread machine,and this is how I made them:Dissolve an 8 g packet of dry active yeast in warm milk and 1/4 c sugar.
Let it stand for 10 minutes,till yeast is foamy.Then add the remaining wet  ingredients.In the end add the flour and mixed with the dough hooks of my  beater till dough ball is formed .Heated oven 200F,and turned it off.Cover dough with moist kitchen towel over bowl.Put in oven for 1 hour.By then the dough will have doubled in volume.Then roll out the dough in rectangle shape.Spread butter,and then sprinkle brown sugar and cinammon mixture on top.Roll it,slice in 12 pieces and put in greased 9 x 13 in glass baking dish.Cover for 30 more minutes.Then bake in 350 F oven for 20-25 minutes,(Set pan on lower rack to bake-i read this but forgot it.will try itnext time and see the difference.)Also someone mentioned that right after taking it out of oven invert  the pan so that the drippings recoat the buns.SInce I didnt have much drippings didnt do it.
Thanks for this deliciously and easy recipe.

I don't have a bread machine but they still turned out great!  I just used a packet of rapid rise yeast, mixed it by hand, covered it, and put it in my oven heated to 200 degrees then truned off.  I also assembled them the night before and covered them with plastic wrap and foil and stuck them in the fridge.  In the morning I let them sit out about 30 minutes and then baked as directed.  It worked out perfect!  
Thanks Marsha!

A baker I am not & I don't own a bread machine, but I really wanted to make these. After studying the most helpful reviews, I rewrote the directions step by step for those of us who need a little help in the baking department. The rolls turned out perfectly! 1. Heat oven to 200 degrees & turn off.  2. Mix 2 teaspoons sugar in warm milk (110 degrees).  Dissolve yeast (1 packet) in warm milk; let stand for 10 minutes until yeast is foamy.   3. In a large bowl mix flour, salt, & sugar. 4. Beat two eggs in a small bowl & add melted margarine.  Incorporate egg/butter mixture into flour mixture. 5. Lastly, add yeast mixture to flour mixture.  Mix with hands until ingredients are combined. 6. Spray counter with nonstick cooking spray & knead dough with hands & rolling pin until dough is elastic & smooth. 7. Place dough in large bowl, cover with a moist towel, & place in oven for 1 hour.  Dough should double in size. 8. Spray counter with nonstick cooking spray & roll out dough in a rectangular shape (15.5” x 23.5”). 9. Mix brown sugar & cinnamon in a small bowl, then mix with 1/3 cup softened butter.  Spread on dough, leaving a ¼” margin at far side of dough.  Roll tightly, working from middle to edges as you roll.  Cut twelve 1-½” pieces. 10. Line 9x13 glass pan with parchment paper, place on lower rack of oven, & bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. 11. Remove immediately after baking or rolls will stick, turning them upside down so that drippings recoat the rolls.

Nothing like Multiplicity, that terrible movie that ended Michael Keaton's career. This is actually a REALLY good clone. Everyone loved them. A few days after making them I was walking by a Cinnabon and gave them a "yeah, I don't need you" kind of look... The guy looked back at me with an "oh yeah?" look. So I was like "Yeah! I just AllRecipe'd your a**" All non-verbal... because that's just how I roll. I'm going to reheat a bun now. Try this recipe, you'll love it unless you work for Cinnabon corporate.

This really is the ultimate cinnamon roll....  You do need to cook them for longer at a lower temperature (20-25 minutes at 350) and if you want each roll to be round and nicely shaped, I'd recommend using a jumbo-sized muffin pan so each roll can rise and bake individually instead of being smushed together in a 13x9 pan and coming out square when you cut it.  Just a personal preference on the appearance, but these are yuuuuummmmmmmy!!!

These were okay, but nothing special.  I have always used a different recipe for my cinnamon rolls and have always gotten rave reviews on them.  People ask me to make them all the time. When I saw that this recipe had over 1,000 positive comments, I figured they must be better...That wasn't the case though.  My recommendation for people is to check out  Cinnamon-Rolls-III instead. They are a lot better. I'll keep using that one.

This is an excellent recipe!  Since there only 2 in our household, after I slice the rolls, I place them in a single layer in a greased pan and freeze them.  Once frozen I transfer them to a freezer bag and am able to cook them 1 or 2 at at time by taking them out the night before and letting them rise.

This is a wonderful recipe and is easily adjustable if, like me, you don't have a bread machine.  I used my kitchen aid stand mixer with the dough hook.  If you make it this way, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk and let stand for 8-10 minutes.  Put this is the mixer bowl and add the other ingredients adding the flour last.  I then turned my oven on to warm and put the dough into the oven covered with a damp towel.  After about 20 minutes I turned the oven off and left the dough for another 40 minutes.  When I took it out it had doubled.  For the filling, I melted the butter and brushed it on the rolled out dough and used my hands to spread the brown sugar on the dough and then sprinkled with the cinnamon.  These will make your entire house smell wonderful.  After baked, they freeze really well too.  Just don't add the frosting to the ones you will freeze(frosting is freezable too).  This really is an easy recipe, it just takes time.

These are AWESOME!  HUGE ROLLS! I wasn't sure if I was supposed to start on the long side or short side rolling these up, the cinnamon rolls I usually make I roll from the long side, but since these were only supposed to be cut in 12 rolls I decided to roll them from the short side so I had more layers in the rolls.  (If you like smaller rolls roll from the long side and and cut twice as many.)  This was the ticket.  They looked beautiful-don't roll too tight though or they will burst out in the center like cones.  (I doubled the recipe and made 4 batches of 6 rolls for a bake sale, but we had to eat one batch-too good!).
I roll these out on a silicone baking mat 15.5"x23.5".  It is the perfect size to stretch this dough thin enough to make great rolls and rolling them up is a breeze.  Roll on the smooth side, put the rough side down so it doesn't slide around-again, roll loosly.  Be ready to roll up your sleeves though, this is not easy to roll this thin especially if you are a novice at baking-it is definately worth the effort! YUMMY!  By the way, I have never used a bread machine for this, but there are plenty of good reviews here to explain that process if you don't know how.

Wonderful, wonderful recipe. Make sure that you decrease temp (350 degrees) and increase time (20-25 min) and set pan on lower rack. Also, if you use wax paper to roll out the dough, make sure you lightly dust the paper with flour. I didn't use as much flour as I should have and almost had "Clone of Cinnabon with Wax Paper" :) Great Recipe - thanks Marsha!

I make these all the time by hand and with a kitchen aid.  I have to say, this is one of the best sweet doughs I have ever used.  I just made 150 rolls for a very large family vacation.  Every single roll was perfect. This recipe is really hard to mess up.  The less you work the dough and the least amount of flour to use as possible will give you the lightest and chewy bun.  Letting them rise overnight is so simple and easy.  I bake professionally so I try different icings when I have time.  I suggest trying something different then the one listed in the recipe.  There are better ones out there.

*Revised Review*

Read a few of the new comments and want to assure everyone this is the best recipe out there.  Someone commented these are dry, I can assure you if you do not over bake they are not.  That being said the bread flour does make the texture different than AP flour.  Personally I don't want a dinner roll(made with AP flour)with some cinnamon.  The texture of this is soooo much better and the use of "real butter"will aid in the moisture.  Lastly since it is a little difficult to know when done especially when you may cut thicker, is to thump on the top.  Hollow sound means done.

HERE IS WHAT MAKES IT A CINNABON ROLL AND NOT JUST ANOTHER CINNAMON ROLL.
 I have been making these for almost a year now and let me tell you people can be bribed with these.  I add 1/2 box any brand instant vanilla pudding to the dry ingredients and ALWAYS use bread flour.  Have made with all purpose but texture is too soft and more dinner roll like.  With bread flour they come out in layers and are so tender but not cotton candy like soft.  I don't even like them with AP flour.  Also must use real butter no exception as margarine has water in it and will change the consistency inside fo the roll.  One extra thing I discovered by experimenting is to add 2 tbls of Sasco dry buttermilk to the dry ingredients.  Using it gives an even better rise(aids the yeast)but also an even better texture if that is possible.  Lastly you can use the same dough for Pecan Sticky Buns.

I was wondering exactly what is "unfair" about posting a recipe that calls for a bread machine!??  Just because users might not have a bread machine does not make it "unfair" to post a recipe that calls for one!  Simply follow the suggestions of other reviewers who make this recipe without a bread machine.  I have one, but I don't use it for this recipe because the connabons come out much better making them the traditional way.  I have found these tips to bring the best results:  proof the yeast in the milk for about 10-15 minutes before mixing with other ingredients; after all ingredients are just mixed together, let the dough rest about 10 minutes before kneading - this allows the flour to absorb the moisture properly.  I've been using this recipe for quite some time now, and they always turn out great.

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the milk (I did use warm buttermilk) and the sugar (which I halved, as I didn't want them to be too sweet) for ten minutes, then added the eggs, butter (I just don't cook with margerine), flour and salt. I kneaded the dough with the bread hook for about five minutes, then set the dough to rise for an hour or so on a warm heating pad. I rolled out the dough and mixed the butter together with the brown sugar (which I also cut back to 3/4 cup), cinnamon, and about a teaspoon or so of nutmeg. I sliced them up and set them in a baking pan, covered them with foil and set them in the fridge overnight. Once I got up this morning, I set the rolls out on the counter to take the chill off, then set them to rise on the heating pad for about a half hour or so. Once they cooled, I just followed with the recipe. I thought this roll recipe was okay, but not my favorite to work with. The dough was kind of cranky. It didn't want to roll out and once I was able to get it to roll out, it was easily breakable. It was difficult for it to get into a ball, too. It might have been because the flour may need to be cut back by a half cup, but once it came together, it seemed to be about right where it needed to be. I don't know. This was a good recipe to try, but for me, not the best. If I do make this again, I'll try this with the flour cut back by a half cup or so.

Great recipe. I had to make some changes, hence the 4 stars. I had to add 1/4 cup of water to the liquid called for. I thought the dough was a little dry after my first batch (made it twice now). I also baked it at a lower temp. as 400 degrees just made the rolls too brown for me. I had to use 350 degrees and baked for about 20 minutes. Also, I had very good luck with heating my liquid in the microwave oven for about 40 - 45 seconds. Place the ingredients in the bread maker in the order suggested by the manufacturer with the exception of the yeast. I usually let all the ingredients mix first then add the yeast about 3-4 minutes after mixing. This has never failed me when it comes to perfect rising. I also use wheat gluten, about 2 tbsp to make the dough light and fluffy. I changed the cream cheese to 4 oz, and had tho beat the frosting for approx. 20 minutes to achieve that fluffy texture like the cinnabon frosting. Anyhow, everyone loved it, and this makes my final recipe for a cinnabon, after trying numerous ones form this site and other cookbooks. happy baking everyone!!

I found this recipe to be very good and I wanted to share what I consider to be a helpful hint that I discovered while making it.   Being a blind homemaker, I found it difficult to roll this dough out into the specified size rectangle.  First, rather than flour my work surface, I sprayed it lightly with cooking spray and also coated my hands with it.  Then, I decided to take half of the dough and place it on the surface, which in my case, was a standard sized cookie sheet.  Using my hands, I was able to press it out to fill the pan and thus have a perfect shaped rectangle.  I followed the remaining steps except that I started on the short end of the rectangle as it was a halved amount of dough.  Then, I did the same thing with the other half of the dough.  Voila!  It worked out great and the rolls were scrumptious.  This may be a helpful hint to those of you who are having trouble getting that perfrect rectangle, shape, blind or not!  :)  Happy baking!!

UPDATE: Tried receipe with increased filling today (1/2 again as much). DH said "deadly" and groaned. Goodness! Gooey heaven:) 

Not that this recipe needs more praise, or that you'd doubt it's fantasticness in light of all the positive reviews and high star ratings, but I wanted to add my 2c. It ROCKS! Living in Australia it's hard to come by a real cinnamon roll and until this recipe turned up I wouldn't have believed *I* would be able to pull off such an exceptional product. I wouldn't have even made the attempt! But oh my goodness - YUM! My husband and I, with restraint, polished the whole pan off in 3 days, but frankly I could have eaten my half in one sitting. I took the recommendation of other viewers and mixed the butter, sugar and cinnamon together then spread/sprinkled over the dough. Absolutely no leakage during or after baking. Good thing - forgot the baking paper. 

I made the rolls the night before and put the loaded pan in the fridge overnight. I then put the cold rolls into a cold oven, turned it on and baked for around 35 mins. Turned out beautifully! They rose some during the night and finished rising during baking. 

As the DH doesn't care for creamcheese, I subbed an icing found on another receipe (1tsp corn syrup, 1/2tsp vanilla essence, 1 1/4 cup sifted confectioners sugar and 2 1/2Tbs half&half) and all was well in the house. 

Thank you so much Marsha for sharing this receipe. It will make many appearances on our table for many, many years to come!!:)

This is the best cinnamon roll recipe ever!  It took me few times to get it right tho.  I found I measured the flour too heavy, now I spoon it into my measuring cup.  Perfect!  I also took other advice and let the yeast bloom in the milk for 10 minutes before I put it in the bread machine.  I just made over 100 rolls for the teachers at my daughter's school.  I FROZE them on cookie sheets and then put them in plastic ziplock bags...gallon bags. (I doubled the bags and put the full bag of rolls into another bag, just to make sure.) After I rolled up the dough and cut the rolls, I put them straight onto a cookie sheet with wax paper and set it in the freezer.  When those were frozen, put them in baggies.  Then, when I wanted to bake all of them, I set them out the night before in pans and let them thaw and rise all night.  Left them on the oven in the morning while I preheated it and they rose a bit more and came out PERFECT after I baked them!  When I have time, I am going to make more and freeze them for my family so we can eat them when we want!  THANK YOU!

Delicious!  The rolls were devoured by my family.  Not a morsel was left.  After reading a gazillion reviews on this recipe, here are the changes that I made, and will continue to make as this is THE perfect cinnamon roll recipe!...

I made my dough in my bread maker.

What I did different:  1.)  I added about 1/2 of a package of instant vanilla pudding when I added the flour (evidently, this is the "secret" ingredient that Cinnabon uses, and using the pudding adds that extra specialness to the roll)  2.)  I added 2 Tablespoons of flour to the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture to keep it from getting too "runny" - worked perfectly.  3.)  After I got the rolls into the pan, I covered the pan with plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator overnight.  In the morning, I removed the plastic wrap and placed them in a cold oven - then turned the oven on to 375 degrees and baked for about 30 minutes.  They rose beautifully.  YUMMY!

Yum, yum, yum, yumitty, yum!  Thank you for letting my family think I'm the greatest!!  The praises I got for this recipe are priceless.  You'd think I fed them only slop before!  Very close to Cinnabon, the frosting was right on!  I don't have a bread machine, but all I did was add 1/2 c of the warm milk in a seperate bowl with the yeast for maybe 5 minutes.  Meanwhile I mixed the flour, sugar and salt, then added all the other wet ingredients and mixed then added the yeast mixture and mixed.  Once mixed through, I used my stand mixer to knead the dough with the dough hook for 5 minutes, adding a little more flour.  Then I put the dough in a big bowl sprayed with pam and surran wrap on top for maybe an hour as it doubled in size.  Easy easy!  The dough turned out amazing!  Love this recipe!  Thank you again.

Excellent. I took it to a brunch and everyone loves it and asked for recipes.  I don't have a bread machine. But I proofed the yeast in the warm milk for 10 minutes.  Beat the eggs then add them into the butter.  Then add in the yeast mixture.  In a large bowl, mix all dry ingredients together then add in the liquids. Hand knead until the dough is elastic and smooth.  One note: I cut the dough into 1 1/2 inch thick and the rolls came out perfect.

Really really good. My husband absolutely loved it. Baked it for 20 minutes at 350 degrees and it came out absolutely perfect. I froze most of them after shaping and the next morning, I placed them in a pan lined with waxed paper brushed with butter and they didn't stick at all. They still came out perfect even without thawing. One other thing. I only had blueberry cream cheese and used this for the frosting instead of regular cream cheese and it really was wonderful. Next time I'm going to put raisins and nuts. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. It really is a keeper!

This is a god recipe.  I used my kitchenaid mixer.  I microwaved the milk for about 1 minute, checked temp. to make sure it was not too hot then mixed sugar and milk together in mixer bowl.  Added yeast, let sit and proof for 15 minutes or so.  Added eggs, butter, salt, mixed together, then added flour last little by little.  Put dough into a bowl that was sprayed with pan spray, covered with damp cloth and then put into 200 degree oven (turned it off when  I put dough in) to rise for about 45 minutes.  after dough had risen, rolled out, added sugar and butter, rolled up and made the rolls.  One thing Ifound, since I have made these a few times....When you put them into a pan to rise the 2nd time, let there be space between the rolls so they can rise more and they will be fluffier and larger.  
These are sooo good...it took me making these about 3 times to get it right, but I have never baked bread or made dough before.

No bread machine, SO... 1 packet of instant yeast into warm milk for 10m. Added sugar, then melted butter, eggs, salt, mixed well, then added ap flour and kneaded by hand 5m. Lg ceramic bowl, coated the inside w/melted butter. Put the dough ball in there- turned it once so it was nice and greazy :) Covered w/a damp towel and set on top of warm oven. 1 hr later it was puffy, punched it down, let sit 10m, then cut dough ball in 1/2 and rolled out w/floured rolling pin on a floured cookie sheet- made it evenly shaped SO EASY! Buttered & sprinkled w/half of cinn/sug and 2/3c chopped pecans. Rolled and sliced, then repeated the process with the other 1/2. Ended up w/21 buns. Put 7/ea in 3 pans. Refrigerated one for next a.m. Froze the other 2 pans. Put frige ones in cold oven and they rose while it preheated, 15m later turned upside down on plate and iced. SO...FLIPPIN...GOOD... ******UPDATE: 1 week later, they froze well! Last night I left them frozen on counter a few hrs to defrost, they rose a tiny bit, then in frige overnight, put in cold oven, they puffed right up while it preheated. Oh, I didn't have cream cheese this time around so used the AR Sour Cream Frosting recipe (more of an icing really) and it was phenomenal with these- a little tangy-er than the cream cheese one- Not as Cinnabon-y, but still YUMMY!***2 WKS frozen, not so good :(

Cinnabon actually softens the butter, mixes in the sugar and cinnamon and adds a little bit of flour.  For the size of the batch in this recipe I'd add about a tablespoon of flour.  Mix all that together to make a soft paste.  Spread it over the dough and roll up.  I promise it will never, ever run out the bottom of the rolls if you make this one small change.

Wow!!! I was nervous about making these by hand because breadmachine broke. I mixed the yeast with 1/2 cup warmed milk and let sit for 20 minutes. I then used my kitchenaid mixer to mix the other ingredients and then added the yeast mixture. I placed the dough convered with a wet towel in an oil sprayed bowl in a 200 degree oven for 20 minutes turned off the oven and let the dough sit in there for another 40 minutes. The dough doubled. After putting together the buns, I placed them in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning I let them sit out for 1/2 an hour and baked them. I doubled the topping recipe (not needed, had lot of extra). They were a hit at the mom's group!!! Thank you.

Just made 4 dozen--everybody agreed they taste just like Cinnabon!  I've tried lots of cinnamon roll recipes over the years trying to get that perfect one, and this one may be it!  I made them in my KitchenAid.  If not using a bread machine, remember to mix your milk, sugar and yeast until dissolved before adding eggs, otherwise the eggs will bind with the yeast and it won't dissolve.

These were soooo finger licking good! man they were big and fluffy and delicious.  I didnt have a bread machine, so i did as follows: I dissolved dry active yeast in warm milk and butter., then added all other ingredients, but did salt and flour last.  kneaded for about a good 20 mins. Heated the oven to 200 degrees, then SHUT IT OFF, placed the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and covered with damp cloth and put in the oven to rise.  Let rise till doubled. Rolled out dough, made buns, and let rise again in oven till doubled.  then baked like 10 mins cuz 15 is too long doing it this way. Inverted the buns to a square pan so that the filling wouldnt seep out the bottom, or stick to the pan, and let cool slightly, turned back over and spread the icing over them while still warm.  verryy goood!!!!

I wasn't sure if I could make this recipie without a bread machine but it turned out great. I let the yeast (just regular yeast) bloom in the warm milk and 1 tsp of the sugar. Mixed the melted butter and eggs together and then added all the wet to the dry. I also used all purpose flour, just a bit more than called for. Also I rolled out the dough after it had risen on a lightly oiled surface. Works way better! A glass dish works much better than a metal pan as it tends to burn on the bottom and dry out on the sides with a metal pan. I baked at 350 until lightly browned. Also, its a good idea to loosen the buns from the pan as if they sit they stick in their goo! All in all an easy delicious recipie!!

I was a bit nervous: I'm new-ish to yeast breads, only had all-purpose flour on hand, & we don't have a bread maker.  I used our stand mixer, warmed the mixer bowl with hot tap water, and "bloomed" a generous 2.5 tsp of active dry yeast in 1C 105 F. skim milk and 1/4C sugar.  For my first times w/ yeast, it *did* get a foamy sort of surface after desolving it and letting it sit about 10 min.  Maybe b/c of the sugar in addition to the milk (?).  I then added in: melted butter, eggs, last 1/4C sugar, & salt.  Lastly, I gradually added in the flour (~5+C all-purpose; it seemed to need that to get dough to clean the sides of the bowl as it was kneeding).  I sprayed a warmed glass bowl, put dough in it, cov'd w/ plastic, then w/ a damp towel.  Let it rise in a warmed microwave (kept the mug of hot H20 in there w/ the bowl) for 1 hr.  Let it rest about 10 min on a floured counter, then rolled out to recipe's dimensions.  I'd mixed the softed butter, br. sugar, and cinnamon, then spread on w/ a rubber spatula.  That took a little time to make even.  Rolled from a long edge, sliced w/ dental floss (great tip - thanks, other reviewers!).  Oven at 350, I baked 8 in a 9x13 glass pan lined w/ sprayed foil.  I had 6 rolls left that I've frozen.  I'll try to thaw, rise, and bake them later.  350 worked well for us, they came out wonderfully!  I probably baked them around 20 min, looking for a golden brown color.  I used the tip of flipping them over - good tip.  Yummy!

I think that I am perfecting this recipe!  I do not have a bread machine.  So for all those that use a kitchen aid here is the scoop!  I warmed my bowl and added the milk sugar and yeast.  I let flower for 10 mins then did a speed 2 on the mix for 1 min.I added the flour and salt, then the eggs and did speed 2 for an additional 2 mins. I scraped and kneaded on speed 2 for an additional 4 mins.   I heated a coffee cup in the microwave for 90 seconds then added the mix to rise.  The roll out has never been hard, don't fret use that rolling pin!  The bread flour has been the key...don't skimp on that! I used more brown sugar and cin... that is my preference!  All was WELL!

I am an seasoned avid baker and had several problems with this recipe. The temperature of the milk was too high for the yeast and succeeded in killing it. Also the liquid content was too low.

The perfect roll is achieved by using:

1 1/2 cup milk (79-85 degrees)
1 cup granulated sugar

Is it possible to give 10 stars?!  This recipe is amazing!  It was easy to prepare (I, too, used my Kitchenaid Stand Mixer fitted with a dough hook instead of the bread machine).  I let it rise in the mixer bowl for 3 hours (while at Xmas Eve dinner).  Prepared the rolls after the kids were tucked in bed, and let them rise in the prepared 9x13 pan overnight in the fridge.  I baked them in the a.m. while opening presents.  The house smelled wonderful, by the way!  I did double the frosting recipe, but didn't end up using all of it.  I do think that there wouldn't be quite enough frosting if you didn't double it though.  This was such a treat, and such a hit!  Everyone raved, especially my husband!  I better buy more bread flour, yeast, etc. and stock up on these ingredients because we will be making these more often!  Thank you!!!  UPDATE:  I MADE THESE A SECOND TIME, AND SERVED THEM TO MY PARENTS.  MY FATHER'S REACTION WAS GREAT... HE SAID, "YOU MADE THESE?!", AND HE SHOOK MY HAND!!  SOOOO GOOD!  MY TWO YR. OLD NIECE ACTUALLY CRIED WHEN I TOOK MY BAKING PAN HOME SAYING, "NO, DON'T TAKE THE CINNAMON ROLLS!"  HA, HA...THESE ARE A WINNER!

Excellent cinnamon rolls. Made it according to the recipe and they turned out great, but made them a little smaller than instructed. The confectioners surgar in the frosting may not completely dissolve if you use too much but it still tastes great.

These were very good! The dough is dead-on. The filling did not amount to enough seepy-goodness for me, so I'll have to see how the other reviewers did it also for some hints.
2 hints for you all: First, use the BEST cinnamon you possibly can. If you can get it, Cinnabon sells jars of their cinnamon that you could use in this. I used Penzey's, and although it was very good, there just is NO COMPARISON to Cinnabon cinnamon. If I could buy cases of the stuff, I would be a very happy camper. Number two: the "secret" ingredient in the frosting that will make it match theirs almost perfectly, is the addition of a few drops of lemon juice. If you made the frosting and thought it was close, but something was missing, there it is. Try it!

O.K. this has replaced my favorite cinnamon roll recipe.  Use korintje cassia cinnamon if you want it to taste just like a Cinnabon.  Though often used interchangeably, cassia and cinnamon are not the same. Cinnamomum cassia (grown primarily in China and Indonesia) is reddish-brown and pungently sweet, while Cinnamomum zeylanicum (from Sri Lanka and India) is buff-colored and mild. Cassia is usually preferred for its more intense color and flavor.  It contains more essential oils.

This is the recipe you make for company and when asked by people for it tell them that it is a old family secret and that you don't share it.  So now - here's how I made it.
Used my kitchenade mixer.  DO NOT substitue the bread flour for regular flour, you will regret it.  I used standard yeast, 2 rise AND I did refridgerate this and take it out in the morning.  You can still use bread machine yeast or rapid rise (I had to do some research on the whole yeast thing they are actually the same thing).  Heat the milk to 110 like the recipe says, add the yeast and sugar and let it proof (sit for about 10 minutes, covered with a towel).  Add the eggs, flour and all the other stuff and mix for a couple of minutes with the paddle mixer, then switch to the hook and let it go.  I did put mine to rise for about 45 minutes in a 200 degree oven.  This was actually too warm, the dough was HOT! Next time I will do 10 minutes in a 20 degree oven and turn it off.  I rolled from the short end so I got more layers.  When I took it out the next morning, I let it sit for about 1/2 hour then baked.  When I took them out I also flipped them over.  Also, I used two 9X9 glass pans to make them in because I couldn't get enough room between them in a standard 13X9 pan.  Lastly, the frosting debate.  My personal opinion, if you want that cinnabon frosting slathered roll you get at the mall - you need to double it.  If you want lighter frosting then you can make the single batch.

OK I'm reviewing these again.  They are a huge hit anywhere I take them.  If I could give them 10 stars, I would.  I've got a couple things I found myself doing after making these so many times:

1. Use real butter for the dough!  Also, when it's available, I use half eggnog in place of the milk for added flavor and richness.
2. Before baking, I pour milk or eggnog over the unbaked rolls, it makes them extra gooey and soft.
3. The filling - I melt the butter, mix it with the brown sugar and cinnamon, and spread it on the rolled out dough like frosting.  I found it is a much more even consistency that way.  Sometimes I also add a little milk and flour to the filling for extra "goo."
4. The icing -  I always made it with an 8oz pkg instead of 3oz (by accident) but I found it makes the perfect amount of icing and isn't too sweet.  I also use 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/4.

WARNING!!
Do not cook these at 400 degrees..my first batch, the tops got browned, and then the insides were still doughy.  Put it on 350.  My second batch came out perfect.  I love the icing!!

In response to mjv made about them being too dry, I like the suggestion made by AUTUMANNE made on 7/15. Baking them at a lower temp should help keep them a little moister. I often do this with cookie recipes, if they call for 375, I usually try them at 350' first and have always had good results. Perhaps your oven runs a little hot? Every oven is different. It's worth a try, hope this helps. :)

OUTSTANDING!! And very forgiving! Because it was late at night, I rolled the dough out before it had doubled, formed the rolls, then plopped them in the fridge overnight. I baked them the next A.M. and they were ooey-gooey PERFECTION! Thanks!

I have been a cook and a baker for 25 years and I have to say, this is the best recipe I've used yet for cinnamon rolls.  If someone made them and didn't like them, then they must have done something wrong because this recipe is terrific.   I made them for the office and for home and my office mates offered to pay me to make them everyweek and the kids just begged me to have them everyday!  I made no adjustments to the recipe, it is fine as is.  Thank you!

These are very delicious! The dough can be used to make other amazing pastries. I've made it 4 times already and they never failed me.

Make sure that the milk and the eggs are WARM. That is essential.

Unbelievably delicious!! I made the dough in my bread machine...it's seriously gorgeous dough. I let it go through the whole dough cycle, about 90 minutes; however, I had trouble with the second rise (after I cut them and put them in the pan, they hardly rose at all), so I'm not sure if I was supposed to let it go through the whole cycle or if I just didn't wait long enough. Either way, in the oven, they rose to fill the pan and baked beautifully! I baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. I can't imagine baking them at 400...the middles would be doughy. I baked one batch right away and let another batch rest for 20 minutes, then put them in the fridge overnight. I took them out about 30 minutes before I wanted to bake them in the morning. You couldn't tell the difference! My co-workers devoured the entire pan in 10 minutes and I'm STILL getting emails and notes about them!! For the rolling debate, I rolled mine from the long side and got 24 medium-size rolls. In the future, I'd still roll them from the long side since it gives you a ton of layers, but I'd cut them thicker...at 2" intervals instead of the 1-1.5" I did last time. As for the icing, I doubled it, but probably didn't need to...both pans were totally slathered with icing and very few people wanted any more. Next time I'm going to double the brown sugar-cinnamon filling. They DO taste like a cinnabon, but there wasn't as much gooey-cinnamon-gooey filling in the layers. These will now be a staple at every Sunday brunch!!

I used this to make small cinnabons for Superbowl. I rolled this out long and narrow, cut it into 24 small rolls.  Then put them into cupcake pans, lined with paper. I followed the sugg. on rolling tight rolls. They popped up and were beautiful. Everyone was VERY impressed and loved them!

Absolutely amazing!  I have always been afraid of recipes where I have to roll out the dough - I always end up making a huge mess.  Not this time - using the bread machine makes this dough a snap to prepare and it rolled out so easily I couldn't believe it.  I made mine the night before and then let them rise in the fridge overnight.  I baked them the next morning for my husband's b-day.  I will never buy prepared cinnamon rolls again since these are so easy to make and taste fantastic.

Fantastic cinnamon rolls.  One tip that I always do is use sour cream instead of soft butter to spread on the rolled dough.  Cuts the fat by half and adds just a touch more flavour.  My family and friends love these made in this way.  They are a huge hit at my church too.  I'm ask to bring them to all sorts of events there.

So easy with a bread machine!  I had too much cinnamon sugar mixture.  They are definitely SWEET so they could probably do with about 1/2-3/4 of the cinn-sug mixture.  I also put them in the fridge (unbaked, after rolling) and then straight into a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes in the morning.  They were perfect!

I have made the recipe over and over. It is extremely easy to make and the result is nothing less than wonderful. 

I only have three people in my house so  I divide the roll into quarters, then wrap what I am not going to use that day in plastic wrap and then store in the freezer in a zip lock bag. I then do the same to the frosting. The night before I want to make them I pull the dough and the frosting into fridge for thawing. In the morning when I wake up I cut the dough and place in a buttered square baking dish in the oven that has been pre heated to 200deg and then turned off. Let rise until doubled in size (about 1.5 hours)  and then remove, preheat the oven again to the baking temp and bake as normal. I always keep at least one batch on hand.
 Hope this helps you use a recipe that would otherwise be to big for a small family.

This is so amazing and worth the effort.  In my home, it is now a tradition to make this for breakfast on special days: Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, and birthdays.  I do all the prep work the night before, letting the recipe rise in the refrigerator so the next day it is very quick.  It makes plenty and we usually have some for the following day....and they still taste great!

Next time, I plan on seeing how they do in the freezer.  Post, please, if you've tried this.

My first try at cinnamon rolls and they turned out fantastic. I baked 6 and froze the other 6 after they rose - and I'm glad I did, because they were HUGE and needed every bit of pan space for baking. My family loved them with only half of the frosting (I used nefuchatel), so I froze the rest for the next batch. Next time, I'll use a 50/50 mix with wheat & bread flour and roll out the "log" to get 18-24 from a batch. That should be the perfect portion size - and a more manageable 5-6 Weight Watchers points. UPDATE: Cooked the frozen batch straight from the freezer (no thawing), with no problems. I placed the 6 rolls in a glass pan in a cold oven. They baked at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes and came out just as nicely as the fresh-baked batch.

These were awesome!!!! I wanted to cut back a little on the calories and fat(I'm supposed to be on a diet). I used 1/4 cup of eggbeaters and used splenda instead of white sugar.  I also used light brown sugar.  For the butter I used light butter and I only used 1 stick for whole thing. I also used light cream chesse. My family loved it and my husband had no idea of all the "secret" ingredients.  LOVED IT!!!!

I don't have a bread machine and it would be nice if this recipe included directions for the many of us who do not, but I was able to figure it out on my own. I had a hard time getting the yeast to proof (even though the temp was right) but I mixed up the dough anyway. I mixed the milk and yeast in my kitchenaid and let it sit for 15 minutes. Then I added the wet ingredients, and the flour bit by bit. I used all purpose flour since I don't have bread flour and it was fine. I added an extra cup. I let the kitchenaid knead the dough and let it rise in the oven for an hour. Then I rolled it out and made the rolls and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Even though I had to improvise a lot, these turned out great and were loved by everyone who ate them. I will definitely make again. Don't be scared to try this recipe without a breadmaker.

I think what I was looking for was a copy of my mother's long gone recipe for her cinnamon rolls.  I think what I wanted was the aroma of yeast and cinnamon from our kitchen on saturday afternoon.  It seemed to fill our home with warm anticapation as we waited for our sunday morning treat.  What I found was almost as wonderful.  The only thing missing was my mom.  Jeanie Bean

Here's the secret to Cinnabon's cinnamon rolls, rich duch cocoa and cinnamon from Madagascar. Add 1 tspn of the cinnamon to the dough recipe. After spreading the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon on the dough, using a sifter, sprinkle about 2 to 2and1/2 tablespoons of the cocoa over all. Tip to cutting dougn. Use waxed, unflavored dental floss. Slide dental floss under roll and tie the floss over the roll, continue pulling the ends of the floss until it cuts through the dough. I like to cut roll in half first.Then cut each half in half and so on.Makes even sized rolls every time! After baking,  turn pan upside down for a few minutes to allow filling to flow back through the rolls. Brush melted butter over hot rolls. Let rolls absorb butter for a minute and then pour icing over rolls. Yum! You can hold off icing rolls to heat individually later. Just keep some icing on hand in the fridge.

This is recipe is perfect just as is! I don't have a bread machine, but you absolutely don't need one.  As one user remarked, dissolve the yeast in warm milk, then add the eggs, margarine, salt, and sugar.  Then add flour and knead to make the dough.  I have a stand mixer, and used the dough hook attachment and it made a perfect, effortless dough without making a mess! I mixed the milk, yeast, eggs, margarine, salt & sugar first by hand in the bowl of the stand mixer, then added the flour last and ran the dough hook on low speed until it made a nice ball and was separating from the sides clean.  Then i heated the oven to 200, turned it off, opened the door and put the bowl with the dough, covered with seran wrap, for 10 min, then closed the door for the rest of the time it took to double in size (for me, it was about an hour and 10 min).   then i followed the rest of the directions exactly as written - and it made for the most perfect cinnamon rolls i've ever had!

I managed to get 12 Larage buns (the same size as store bought). I baked 8 in a glass pan and 4 in a 8x8 tin and they both turned out very well. The buns were super fluffy like cotton. My dough kept sticking to the table even though I floured the surface so I ended up oiling the dough instead which was better. After reading the reviews I was worried that it would be too sweet so I reduced the sugar in the filling and icing. Instead of using all the sugar called for in the recipe I just sprinkled enough to cover the surface of the dough. For the icing, I used 150g of icing instead of 190g and also left out the vanilla. The dental floss tip to cut the dough was really useful and made the job so much easier! Also, if your buns end up rising wierdly in the middle like mine did, just overturn the whole pan onto a baking tray lined with foil for 1 min. When you turn them right side up they will look normal again.

These are a new family favorite - my husband asked, "Aren't you going to make any more cinnamon rolls?!?" about 2 seconds after the first batch was gone!  I love how tender they are, he loves the moist centers, and the kids are too busy stuffing their faces to express an opinion...and they really do taste like a Cinnabon.  I used light cream cheese for the frosting, and it worked just fine.  **One note - my oven is usually pretty accurate, but I did need to turn the temperature down to 385F.  Keep an eye on them while they're baking - they're too yummy to ruin! Definitely a must-try.

These taste 99.9% like Cinnabon (which I LOVE).  Thank you for the great recipe!  

The following tips from other users did NOT help:



Using the BOTTOM Rack, my first batch was DESTROYED.  Edible, but oh so wrong.  (The rack was one up from bottom.)  

Mixing the filling ingredients was a NIGHTMARE to spread evenly.

Spacing out the rolls is good only IF you want a "crust" around the perimeter of each roll.  

These tips DID work:  

Leaving 1/4" edge for pinching a seal on roll.  

Inverting the pan of rolls immediately after removing from oven.

Spreading half the frosting immediately after re-inverting the rolls and then adding the rest of the frosting just before serving.

Baking at 350 degrees for 21-24 minutes.

My own tips:  Making sure to start with a true rectangle and keep it even and flush while rolling.  Keep the dough in one piece.  Do not fold over, cut, or otherwise manipulate the dough into your rectangle outside of using the rolling pin or your hands.

If you like soft outsides of your rolls, DO let your rolls snuggle up to each other in the pan.  Sure, they don't come out ROUND, but they are SOFT on all sides.

Do use the MIDDLE rack.

Use an oven thermometer.  (My oven has to be set at 370 to heat to an actual 350 degrees.)

After about 10 minutes, watch the rolls carefully.  When they start to cone, just (quickly) push everything back down with the back side of a spatula.

Fantastic cinnamon rolls!

Holy cow.  So I thought I could make good cinnamon rolls.  Then a few friends made some and brought them over and it sent me out in search for a better recipe.  Some people aren't keen on sharing recipes.  Love this web site.  Then I came across this recipe.  I was trying to choose between this and Cinnamon Rolls III.  Honestly I chose this one because of how many positive reviews it received.  I liked the 4 thousand over the hundreds.  So I gave it a try.  I don't use my bread machine and did this as the others: a packet of yeast in the warm milk with the sugar for 10 min.  Then mixed all the other ingredients with my mixer.  I allowed the rolls to cook at 400 degrees for exaclty 15 minutes.  When they came out, I buttered the tops just to keep them tender out of habit and then inverted them onto a cookie sheet (now buttered side is down).  They were separated and immediately covered with the frosting.  It is the perfect frosting.  My final comment to end this novel:  Amazing!!!!  Try it.  You will love this recipe!  The only thing that I didn't love about these cinnamon rolls is how much weight I am about to gain from making them all the time!  Thanks Marsha.

I've made this dozens of times without a bread machine and with practice, this recipe became very easy. My family loves this recipe so much that I had to make the rolls smaller and more portioned-controlled so they wouldn't eat too much in one sitting. I rolled the dough out to the same size the recipe states, but I rolled up the long side and cut about 24 mini-sized rolls. This also gave me more gooey centers. I found the easy way to cut the rolled dough were to use a serrated knife and saw through it so that I wouldn't put pressure on the dough. I also baked these on parchment paper since this is what Cinnabon does as well - the rolls and the pan come out clean. I don't know if this helps anyone, but to get 3oz of cream cheese, I just pick up a regular philly tub (8oz) and cut it in half like a pie, then take 3/4 of one of the halves and voila! - 3 ounces! Thanks for the great recipe - it's such a wonderful indulgence!

Without a bread machine, it's a bit difficult to make this recipe.  After my first batch failed to rise, I learned these lessons: 1) warm cold milk to 100 degrees, by microwaving it for 1 minute on high, then dissolve the yeast (I used 1 packet of Fleishmans Rapid Rise yeast - the kind that comes in a 3 pack attached to each other from Wal-Mart), 2) I used all-purpose Gold Medal flour after reading that bread flour made these rolls tough, 3) definitely heat the oven to 200 degrees, then turn it off and place your bowl of dough in there to rise (I have a gas oven, but placing it in the oven with the pilot on was not enough heat for the dough to rise -- by the way, the dough increases in size about a 1.5x its size (not double) 4) use a lot of flour when rolling out the dough - flour the counter, pin, and hands, otherwise, it'll be impossible to roll into a pinwheel, 5) you don't need to let it rise again after  rolling, filling and cutting the dough, 6) If you want creamy white frosting, don't add vanilla extract -- my turned out a golden yellow frosting (not as appetizing).  

Once I got all these steps right, they came out wonderfully!  About 12 small - medium size rolls.

This recipe doesn't need another rave review, but I wanted to add to how great it was. 

As mornings are pretty busy, I completed the recipe up until the second rise. Instead of baking right away, I covered it and stuck it in the fridge overnight. Next day, I let the rolls rise to size then stuck them in the oven to bake.

Topped with the delicious icing = AMAZING!

edit: After having made these several times since my last review, I wanted to add what others have mentioned. The cinn/brown sugar mixture works best when first blended with the butter, THEN spread over the rolled-out dough with a spatula or spoon. This provides for a much more evenly dispersed filling.

I have been making Cinnamon Rolls for years, a family tradition that has been passed down over the years. This recipe turned my head, so I had to try it. A few tips for starters I do not have a bread machine to mix it all in so you can do it by hand just do not melt the butter or you will have a sticky mess. I have learned over the years that you can use the rolling pin to get more of the cinnamon brown sugar mix in to the dough this will also help keep it in the roll and not in your pan.  Also use a very sharp knife to cut the rolls with as to not squeeze the filling out you can also cut it about ¾ the way through and make a wreath out of it (great for Christmas morning). Lastly have the cream cheese as soft as you can this will help make a smoother topping. Everyone loved it and I have a new Cinnamon Roll recipe, Sorry Mom.

Excellent! I do not have a bread machine, but used my Kitchen Aid and let this rise on it's own in a warm microwave (turned off after a coffee cup of water had been heated for 90 secs - great trick for rising dough!) and it worked wonderfully!

One tip: this took quite a while to rise, so use Rapid-Rise yeast. Otherwise, it will need to rise for at least 90 mins.

Fantastic recipe! I will definitely make them again!!

I'm not familiar with a "cinnabon" so I don't know how these compare, but this will be my new cinnamon roll recipe from now on! Not too heavy, not too light. I used all purpose flour, 1 packet of yeast (I didn't measure) and I don't even have a bread maker, and these were still fantastic! Loved the cinna-sugar mix for the filling...I have always had to double other recipe amounts, but not with this one. Mine were really slow to rise however, maybe the humidity or temp outside that day? So mine took a bit more time than stated. About an hour longer. I used lightly floured parchment paper to work with and they were so easy to roll up. Thanks I'm keeping this one!

This is BY FAR the best cinnamon roll recipe I have tried so far in my quest for the perfect recipe. I try a new one about every other time I make cinnamon rolls, and then keep going back to this one. I first made it in my bread machine as directed, they were awesome but a little tough on the dough. This most recent time I used my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook, then kneaded it by hand for 3-4 minutes, let it double in a slightly warm oven, then followed the rest of the directions. They came out much smoother and less tough. Oh, and a note on the frosting--it would taste more like Cinnabon's if it had 4 oz. cream cheese not 3, then add a bit more powdered sugar and maybe a dash of milk if needed for consistency. I also doubled the vanilla and added a splash of butter flavoring to compensate for the extra sugar so it wasn't too sugary tasting. Hopefully that helps some of you out there!

I am guilty of never having had a Cinnabon but if they taste as good as these then I am hooked!  This is definitely a 5-star for taste and ease of preparation.  The only change I made was to take the advice of some of the reviews and mix the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter together and brush it on.  I also made my dough in my bread machine, rolled it out, shaped and cut my rolls and then let them rise overnight in the fridge for even more ease of prep.  I took them out the next morning, let them sit on the counter for 30 minutes and then baked them according to the directions.  They came out perfect and were nice and hot for me to take to work.  The icing was incredible and my co-workers want me to open a bakery selling these and Grandma Johnson's scones.  Great recipe!!  Thanks Marsha!

the outcome was great;however, make sure your bread maker can accomodate all the ingredients...I ended up doing it totally "by hand"

Throw out your old cinnamon roll recipes.  This one is a keeper!  I found that the rolls cook more evenly if placed on the bottom rack of your oven.  Enjoy!

This is the best cinnamon bun recipe I've ever tried! I didn't have a bread maker, so I mixed the dry ingredients first in a food processor. Then, I bloomed the yeast in some of the warm milk and about a tbsp of the sugar. Then I added them to the dry mixture along with all the rest of the wet ingredients. oh and I use butter no margarine. Processed everything until the dough formed a ball and very smooth. Let it rest near a warm oven, covered in an oiled bowl until doubled in size. Then followed the rest of the steps. I made mini rolls, and was able to get abt 36 rolls! They were delicious. Not exactly like cinnabon, but very close. My brother who is usually very critical, said that they were even better than cinnabons! My mom said that the frosting is what completes them! I will definitely make again. Really not hard at all, really awesome!

Yep, these are good.  Very gooey, sweet, and buttery.  Certainly not for the health conscious, but as an occasional treat; it's worth it.  Bread machines are not necessary.  I used my KitchenAid mixer fitted with a dough hook to knead the dough for about 3 minutes.  I covered the bowl with plasticwrap and let it sit in a warm place for about 1hr. 15 min.  From there on, I followed the directions.

Very, very very good!  So light and yummy. I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour, and mixed in my stand mixer with the bread hooks.  I let the prepared rolls sit overnight in the fridge, and let them rise a bit on the counter before baking.  Even after all of these changes, the recipe still turned out great! I followed the advice of other reviewers, and mixed the filling together before spreading, instead of layering the ingredients as specified.  The icing is the crowning glory.. the road to heaven is probably paved with this stuff.  Sooo tasty.. Thanks Marsha!

Wonderful.  Not that hard to make.  I didn't use the bread machine, but a packet of yeast instead.  I kneaded by hand for about 3 or 4 minutes and let rise in a warm place for an hour.  Best with chopped pecans.

Amazing. Seriously the best ever. I would eat these everyday if it wouldn't make me fat. I followed the instructions but just made more icing (so I could use the whole brick of cream cheese). I used another reviewers suggestion on preparing them the day before and on the icing: 
"I make these to the point where they are placed in the baking dish, then I cover them with plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator for the night. The next day, they go into a COLD oven (minus the plastic wrap!). Turn up the heat to 350 and bake for 25-30 minutes. There is no need to let them sit out. I do this with other yeast rolls and breads. Also, I made the frosting (used Neuchatel cheese - less fat), dropped it by spoonfuls (enough for 1-2 rolls) onto wax paper, froze them, then removed the frosting drops and wrapped them individually in plastic wrap. These all went into a plastic bag and back to the freezer until needed. This way you can use all of the 8 oz package of creamed cheese (2/3 c butter, 4 c powdered sugar, 1-1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 tsp salt). The extra rolls, if you have any, are frozen and reheated in the microwave (these are really good reheated). This is where the frozen frosting comes in handy. It doesn't take much heat to thaw the frosting." -dbdcook

Amazing!!! These are the best cinnamon buns! Whenever I make them, my family and friends comment on how amazing they are:) I did a few things different.  I used regular yeast (not bread machine yeast) and I used all purpose flour (not bread flour) also I baked them at 375F for 20 minutes. Enjoy!!

These are awesome!  I just pulled them out of the oven and 3 are already gone.  Delicious!  So easy to make too which is the best part.  They're not overly sweet or heavy, but light and delicious.  I don't have a bread machine or a stand mixer.  I did everything by hand and they turned out great.  I also didn't have any bread flour so I just used all purpose and it tastes great! Here's what I did:  Woke up this morning and dissolved the yeast in the warmed milk with sugar.  While that was sitting, I combined the eggs, margarine and salt.  When the yeast mixture was ready, I added that and mixed.  I then slowly added the flour, cup by cup, mixing well.  When all flour was combined, I turn onto a floured surface and kneaded by hand (about 10 minutes).  I then formed a ball and placed in a lightly oiled bowl, covered with a damp cloth and let it rise about an hour.  Next, I rolled out the dough. I covered my counterops with greased and floured waxpaper and followed the rest of the recipe.  These are SO GOOD.  Did I mention that yet?!

I loved the bread part, but wasn't too delighted with the filling. As the rolls were baking, the layers sort of "separated" from each other, and the sugar melted and caramelized at the bottom, so the bottom of the rolls were hardened with caramelized sugar. Does anyone have any idea why, or have the same problem?

I've had a few attempts making bread/rolls etc before but they always tasted really yeasty.  This is the first recipe I have tried that has turned out just perfect!  This is despite doing everything by hand as I don't have a bread machine/food mixer.  The only change I made was to add some raisins to the dough (we don't have cinnabons here in England so I don't have to be authentic!).  I also originally cut down on the flour as suggested by some other reviewers but the dough was too sticky to knead by hand so I ended up using the full amount per the recipe and it was fine.  One last thing - I put a couple of sheets of plastic wrap (brushed with a little oil) directly onto my kitchen worktop, and rolled out the dough on that - much less messy and great for rolling up the dough after sprinkling with the sugar etc.

These were so easy to make and so incredibly addicting.  I also don't have a bread machine but did as previous reviewers said and mixed one package of yeast, milk and sugar (I used Splenda) together first and let sit for 10 minutes - then added rest of wet and dry ingredients.  I started out mixing the dough with a wooden spoon and then tried using my dough hook on my mixer, but the spoon actually worked out better.  I only kneaded it in the bowl for a minute or two by hand and the dough came out perfect.  Also mixed the brown sugar, softened butter and cinnamon together first and spread on the dough with a spoon.  I used low-fat cream cheese in the frosting too.  Very easy, very good and will be making lots of times in the future.  For those who say they didn't cook in the middle, I cut mine into one-inch portions and they came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

This is my go to machine bread cinnamon bun recipe and I have made this recipe several times. There's only abit of tweaking ... I do not melt the margarine and I also put the ingredients into the dough maker in the order recommended by the manufacturer of my bread machine. The only variation I have done is adding the grated rind of a lemon and 1 tsp of vanilla to the dough. I think there's a tasty difference. ... My advice towards rolling up the dough is the same as the others ..... roll tightly and none of the filling will fall out onto your pan.

This is really a 4.5 start recipe.  I would have  given 5 stars if the recipe read: cook at 350 for 20 min.  Also, a larger pan would allow the rolls to spread out and up, so they would have cooked more evenly.  Anyway, I wish I had taken others advise about the temp before I made my first batch because we could not eat the ones in the center(too doughy).
I did find that sprinkling  the filling ingredients on and then going over them with the rolling pin a few times, really did help keep the filling in place and is a lot easier then mixing it with the butter and then spreading it on.

Look no further than this recipe!!!  I've made many cinnamon roll recipes and tweaked them myself trying to get as close as possible to cinnabons (and I'm a seasoned baker!) but this is it.  I always try to follow new recipes exactly if I'm going to review them so I made this just about as-is except I used all butter.  I also used King Arthur Flour's special dry milk and warm water instead of the regular milk (I do this when making yeast breads that call for milk, makes it lighter and moister) but that isn't necessary.  For personal taste I doubled the frosting recipe (LOVE the frosting!) and smeared 1/2 on when they came out of the oven and the other half after they cooled a bit - this is something I always do when making my cinnamon rolls per a cinnabon ex-employee's suggestion.  Makes  them moist with some melty frosting and some thicker on top.  Oh, and take a rolling pin over the cinnamon/sugar a couple times before you roll them up - definitely helps with filling issues.  Just my personal touches as everyone else does but this recipe is awesome as written (with butter).

They aren't bad, a lot of work for what you get.  I think I would just spend the money and save the time to get regular Cinnabons.

I have been looking for a great cinnamon roll recipe for years and this is it. I tried it for 2 reasons, A: no hand kneading! and B: when a recipe has been rated almost 2,000 times and has 5 stars, it has to be good! My husband was a pastry chef trained at Oxford College in Oxford, Enland and he couldn't stop eating these. I didn't have any problems with the filling running out, I wonder if it was because they rose until they were tightly packed together. Also, I baked them in stoneware, don't know if that helped. These are a family favorite and will be taken to every brunch and breakfast where I want to impress! FYI, I make them the night before and cover them. I take them out in the morning and still only let them rise about 30-45 min. and bake as directed.

Used a packet of yeast, regular flour and my stand mixer and it worked out great.  The dough was very sticky so I had to liberally flour my silicone non-stick rolling mat and my hands.  The cinnamon mix goes on so thick I was really just spreading it even with my hand instead of sprinkling, but the amount is perfect in the end.  There was no mention which direction to roll and I'm glad I chose the short end because it created more spiral layers per roll.  I think I liked it better than my husband and his friends, but should we really give their opinion much weight?

I'm actually trying the other cinnabon recipe- "Soft, Moist and Gooey Cinnamon Buns" since it got better reviews, but just wanted to give you all a tip, if you don't have confectioner's sugar, all you have to do is put regular sugar in the blender. Blend on high till it's all powdery (stopping to give it a stir if needed) & voila, you have homemade confectioner's sugar!

These made the most beautiful cinnamon rolls I've ever produced.  They do wonderfully stored overnight; they don't really rise in the fridge, but they absolutely double in the hot oven.  I took them out 30 minutes before I put them in the oven (350 for 20 minutes) and they baked up golden and soft.  I made two batches, one with white wheat flour and one with bread flour, and they both came out nearly identical.

As a professional baker for many years, I find this to be a very good recipe and there were some excellent tips, such as turning  the pan over and letting the brown sugar mix seep back down into the rolls. Try adding some diced up apple pie filling for an added touch.

In response to them not cooking through.... I cooked mine in a glass 9x13, at 350 for about 25 minutes. The very tips of the tops were pretty brown when I took them out- but every roll was cooked through perfectly. I think 400 degrees- as per the recipe is too high.

Great Recipe! One helpful hint I learnt from my Grandma, "cut" the roll with a piece of string, the thinner the better. (Dental Floss works as well, but I prefer sewing machine thread.) Cut the thread around 10 inches, slide it under the roll, criss cross ends over eachother and slice the bun! Perfect every time.

This recipe is now in my recipe book to stay.
We just can't stop eating them, they are good even cold.
I saw some reviews of people who had problems with the dough being too dense, and I hope I can help. The secret is the yeast.
There are different kinds of yeasts, the yeast that you need when working with high sugar dough (more than 8% sugar content) is different than other yeasts, most brands of this particular kind of yeast contain polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate and ascorbic acid in adition to the saccharomyces cerevisiae which is the yeast cultive.
Don't let the names scare you, these are not horrible preservatives that will damage your body, they are just there to make sure that your yeast developes propperly in a high sugar content dough.
Most instant and regular dry yeast in the market have a high sugar douhg version. This makes a world of difference.
The only change I made to this recipe is the adition of 1 tablespoon of corn starch to the filling and I formed a paste with it to spread evenly, this prevents the sugar, butter and cinnamon from bleeding out of the rolls.

DID NOT USE BREAD MACNINE ----Very easy-- I used my kitchen aide mixer with the bread dough hook--- dough came out fabulous-- extremely easy to make-- 
Used regular flour--- 
Mixed milk, yeast and sugar together FIRST until bubbly-- then mixed rest of ingred---added flour 1 cup at a time-- then ran mixer for about 5 more min to knead dough-- Wonderful

WOW were these good!  I took someones suggestions by turning the pan upside down while cooling to let the rolls absorb the filling in the bottom of the pan.  My family is already begging me to make these again!

FOR THE NON MORNING PEOPLE--- I have made these many times and everytime they turn out amazing.  This last time after assembling the rolls and letting them rise I put them in a tin foil pan and in the freezer with foil ontop.  Along whit it went a little ziplock baggy with frosting.  This morning was the real test.  The foil pan with frozen rolls went into the cold oven while it warmed up.  Put the baggy of frosting ontop of the oven where the warmth defrosted it in time for the rolls to come out hot and wonderful just like I had made the dough this morning.  It was awesome!  Nothing like waking up Saturday morning with fresh home made cinnamon rolls and a cup of coffee.    I'll be making tons of freezer packs for Christmas presents for the neighbors, family, friends, and families who just had babies.  Who doesn't like home made cinnamon rolls?

My first few attempts were less than successful, but I kept trying because all the good reviews.  My biggest problem was the outside rolls would get burnt and dry, while the middle didn't bake all the way through and sunk when cooled.  My recent attempt turned out much better because I baked the rolls in a 9x9 stone dish at 350F instead of a 9X13 pan at 400F (I halved the recipe and made 9 smaller rolls).  All the rolls baked evenly this time around.  I also used less flour (1/4 C less for half recipe), and the rolls came more tender and moist.  FYI: to figure out how much to cut each roll, for a full recipe (rolled out to 16X21) cut a 16 inch log into 1.3 inch sections with floss to make 12 rolls.  For a half recipe, roll out dough into 12X15 rectangle.  After rolling into a 12 inch log, cut 1.3 inch sections to make 9 rolls.  In a 9X9 pan, you can fit 3 rolls across and 3 down. The icing is also super sweet for an already rich roll.  I only use half the sugar, thin with a little milk, and drizzle on instead of covering the whole top with icing.

It's easy to make frozen cinnamon buns!  I use this recipe to make about 12 dozen cinnamon buns for my church Christmas Bazaar.  After rolling out the dough,  spreading the butter and cinnamon/sugar on, and rolling it up, I wrap up the whole roll in plastic wrap and freeze it.  A half-pipe shaped bread pan works well for holding the shape while it is freezing (so it won't be flat on the bottom).  Once frozen and wrapped tightly, the cinnamon bun dough will keep in the freezer for quite a while; at least a month.  When ready to make the buns, I measure and mark the frozen roll in 1-1/4" increments, cut the frozen dough with a very heavy knife, and place the individual rolls into a prepared pan.  THen I spray them lightly with Pam and cover them with wax paper. It takes about 8 hours for the rolls to thaw and rise. Then they can be baked in accordance with the directions in the recipe.  As a variation, I use caramel icing to frost them.  I like to keep a roll of frozen dough in my freezer so I can take them out and make them on short notice as needed.

I wish I could give this a 4.5 star. Everyone really loved them, but only a few people gave it a 5. I would give it a 5 on easiness. For made-from-scratch cinnamon rolls these were so easy. I didn't change anything in the recipe, I did everything as-is, and I think they turned out pretty good. I did take the advice of others and let them rise in the oven after the heat had been turned off of 200, and I think that made them rise faster than what a lot of people mentioned. I did let them rise about 40 minutes though instead of 30. They were a little doughy in the middle and they were really sweet, but I expect that from a cinnamon roll. I liked the reviewer on here who said that these were too unhealthy for them. I don't know what they expected from a cinnamon roll. If they wanted healthy maybe they should have made some granola.

These rolls are darn good. My hubby actually loves this the best compared to the other cinnamon rolls recipes I tried before. Although, ... I still vote for the Cinnamon Rolls III somehow... This one though makes a big size rolls that just impress everyone. heheh. I don't have a bread machine so what I did was warmed up the milk, stirred in 1/4C of sugar, then put in the yeast. Waited for 10 min until it foamed up. In another bowl, combine the flour and salt. Melted the butter, let it cool slightly (you wanna make sure everything is in room temp), and beat the eggs just until combined. Then, I mixed in the eggs, butter, and remained 1/4C of sugar into the yeast mixture,  put in the flour mixture 1 C at a time, and knead. Try not to add too much flour during this process. Follow the directions afterwards. For the frosting, I used 4 ounce of cream cheese instead of 3 and 1 C of confectioners sugar instead of 1 1/2. It's the perfect taste and sweetness for me. Baked it at 350 for 20 -25 min. I luckily never experienced uncooked  or dense dough in the middle. This is totally worth the effort and time. Thank you for the recipE!

Delicious! A few things: I made two batches, one with active dry yeast and one with bread machine yeast (I have no bread machine) and they both turned out identical. Another reviewer mentioned not having fluffy texture and heavy dough. As for the texture, this happened to me too so I will try allowing the dough to rise longer (a few others said they let it rise overnight in the fridge). I only let it rise for about 1.5 hours. I also noticed that the dough was heavy, but the cinnabons came out perfect! I will say that the recipe DOES call for bread flour, and I used all-purpose since it was all I had on hand. Still the "bons" tasted so good that no on in my family seemed to give a hoot. I personally did not have to double the icing, but some may want to. With the original recipe, the icing does not cover the cinnabons as it shows in the picture...it allows for about half of the "bon" to be covered (probably a little bigger than a silver dollar, but not big enough to coat the ENTIRE top surface). Lastly, about the icing: I found it easier to make the icing with butter that had been melted and cooled to room temp as opposed to softened butter as called for in the ingredients (Note: I also used butter in the dough instead of margarine like the recipe calls for). Also I was a little skeptical about the icing, because I thought the cream cheese would give the icing a "cheesecake-like" flavor, but it didn't. All in all, it was absolutely heavenly.

These were so good I had to make one big enough to use for a pillow so the delicious smell would permeate my dreams. Tomorrow I'm installing them in my car in replacement for the safety airbags, my insurance rates will probably go up but I know if I get into an accident it's gonna taste great!

2nd time making this recipe and it's as close to the real thing as it can be!  I don't have a bread machine so had to make a few adjustments. I'd dissolved 1 packet of the instant dry yeast in 1 cup of warm milk (microwaved for 1 minute on high) and added 1 tablespoon of sugar to activate the yeast (whisked it to remove lumps). Then added the sugar, melted butter in the KitchenAid (used the paddle attachment), eggs then slowly added the flour (used plain flour).  After the yeast mixture gets frothy (about 10min), I slowly added in the milk/yeast mixture and changed to the K hook attachment.  After about 5 min, the dough is formed and I took it out, kneaded it with lightly floured hands and it rose beautifully an hour later (covered with a tea towel, left on top of stove counter). Followed the rest of the directions as is and voila, perfect cinnabons!  The ones I couldn't finish, I baked it for 5 min, then froze the rest for the next time.  Comes out perfect each time :)

WOW I am amazed at how many reviews this recipe has gotten I submitted this many many ...years ago and haven't been back til now, THANKS to the many people who have said thanks or took the time to make it. I also love the many adjustments many have made. I also leave bake the rolls for 12 min or cover them once they have browned with foil. Flipping them over once done is great! I also wanted to add that I take this SAME recipe and make doughnuts and/or dinner rolls. For the rolls just take a small piece at a time roll it up like a ball and place on your baking sheets ..cover with a light towel for maybe half hour and let them rise then bake for 10-12 min. You could even butter lightly ...For doughnuts do the same just fry them in oil and glaze with powered sugar mix or chocolate when done !!! Tastes so good !!!

5 Star even using frozen bread dough!  Yes, I used Rhodes frozen bread dough, let it thaw then rolled it out and proceeded from there.  Oops, I didn't read the directions and I cut the softened butter into the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Made it a little hard to "spread", but it worked!  As I don't measure much when I cook, I probably used 6 oz of cream cheese, 5 T butter and about 2 cups powdered sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla.  YUMMY!!  The frosting was perfect (I actually had a little bit left over, but will pile it on top before the rest of these go into the freezer).  I can't imagine these being any better so I doubt I will go to the trouble of making the dough.  Try the frozen bread dough, you won't be disappointed!  The filling was exactly what I was looking for...lots of ooey-gooey cinnamony goodness. :)  Thanks for the recipe!  Edit..I forgot to mention I made these at night, popped into the refrigerator, took them out when I got up the next morning, let them sit for about an hour then baked.  Worked perfect and will be the recipe I go to for our Christmas morning cinnamon rolls!

These are wonderful. The real secret here is to leave the dough mixture to rise overnight, then roll out and add the cinnamon filling, shape and store in the fridge. Take out at night and leave again then bake them for breakfast. Long, slow rising is always the key to perfect breadmaking.

Just a side note on someone saying use a .8 gram package of yeast- for those of you using Active Dry Yeast- that is 3 teaspoons or 1 tablespoon of active dry yeast. This recipe calls for bread machine yeast. If you don't convert the measurement to active dry yeast, your dough will not rise properly, be hard to work with, and will be too dense. Also, as Jennifer said, be sure to flip the pan over to let the cinnamon sugar goodness to recoat the rolls.

Amazing recipe!  I've already made this several times.  I doubled the frosting so we could have extra and some leftovers.  I would recommend cooking them in 2 pans so they all cook evenly and thoroughly.  In one 9x13 pan the middle ones weren't cooked all the way while the edges were starting to burn.  It worked much better cooking them in 2 8x8 pans or 2 pie pans.  My husband's favorite!

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made.  I have made these a few times now.  My husband & son both love them.  The first time I made them they came out doughy in the middle, so I turned the heat down on my oven by about 25 degrees. :)

Really good but to truly be like Cinnabon they need to be higher and fluffier. I make them with my Kitchen Aid mixer: I add 2 yeast packets and heat the milk to about 80 degrees. I preheat my bowl so it is warm as well, then let the yeast proof. I leave in a warm oven (turned it on then off quickly). I mix the butter and cinnamon and sugar together then spread it out - using double what the recipe says. Be sure to not overcook! Ice while hot being generous.

I just made these for the first time, and they are absolutely fantastic.  Everyone absolutely loves them.  I think I will try using a little more milk next time to make them fluffier, and glaze the tops with butter before baking.

Excellent recipe.  This was the first time I made cinnamon rolls and they turned out perfect.  I didn't have any bread flour so I used regular and it was perfect.

This is absolutely amazing!  I have made SO many recipes from this site and this is the first time that I have rated any because it was out of this world.  I made the dough into the rolls and then put them in the refrigerator over night.  I set them on the counter for 45 minutes in the morning and then baked.  It doesn't get much better than this!!

When I put the buns in the pan I put it in the fridge overnight with a damp towel over them. The next morning I set them in a warm place for half an our to do the second rising and baked them as directed.  They were wonderful.  I'm glad to know I don't have to do the whole thing in the morning. These are wonderful!!!

These are the best!  I have never made bread of any type and this was incredibly simple.  I have a bread machine, but decided to try it in my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I simply put all the dough ingredients in the bowl in no particular order and used my dough hook to mix it.  When it came to a nice ball I let it go for another minute, and voila, beautiful dough.  I put non-stick spray on my hands to transfer it to another bowl for the rise.  It was pretty sticky initially.  I creamed together the butter, cinnamon, brown sugar, and left it at room temperature.  That made it very easy to spread.  I made these the day before, refrigerated them, let them sit a little this morning and baked for 22 minutes at 350.  Perfect.  I also halved the recipe, and it still came out delicious.  The rolls looked small before cooking, but 6 rolls filled my 9x13 pan after they cooked.  They were huge! So delicious.

I have to admit I was skeptical that these would taste like the real thing. Wow!!! This was the closest I've ever come to duplicating the Cinnabon recipe. I scored major points with my hubby with this one! I baked them at 350 for around 18 minutes (glass pan). I also doubled the frosting and whipped it for several minutes to make it fluffy like Cinnabon's. This one's a keeper! Thanks for sharing Marsha!

Sorry but to whomever said these were not good clearly did not make them correctly. I've been a chef 30 years. These came perfect. Just the right hardness to the outside and gooey but not doughey on the inside. The frosting was also excellent. Who puts pudding in cinnamon buns? Eeesh. Try these they are great. I put the milk and butter in my microwave first just enough to warm the two. Put them in the bread machine first. Then flour, then salt then eggs sugar and yeast last. The sugar feeds the yeast and will make the dough rise. Thank you for the recipe. This has been added to my recipe box. Photo of mine attached. :)

Under bake rather than over bake. Watch them like a hawk.  They have to be soft to get that cinnabon texture. And as another commenter said, flip the pan upside down over a baking sheet while they cool to keep the syrup from pooling on the bottom of the pan. (and I don't use bread makers either) I make them night before then refrigerate. Rise in the morning and bake.

Good recipe but I should have read all the reviews first.  400 for 15 mins is way to hot!!!  They were nicely browned on top but borderline raw underneath and in the middle.  So disappointing after all that work.

These are absolutly perfect, make them as a special treat for the family, or for my husband to take to work with him and they never disapoint.  I have made them early in the morning, or made them all the way through rolling with the sugar cinnamon and cut them into rolls, then let rise in the fridge overnight take them out in the morning let sit at room temp for an hour and then cook  them as directed.  Works great!

I LOVE, I LOVE, I LOVE, I LOVE this recipe!!!  They really do taste just like Cinnabons.  I don't own a bread machine, so I followed the advice found in some of the other comments.  I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour, and I used 2 1/4 teaspoons of Fleischmann's Active Dry All Natural Yeast instead of the bread machine yeast.  I also placed the kneaded dough in a oiled glass bowl covered with a damp cloth and let it rise in a 200 degree (F) oven for the first hour.  I didn't change anything else in this recipe.  My changes were only made due to a lack of the recommended equipement and ingredients.  I LOVE this recipe!  I made these yesterday.  They turned out perfect!  My boyfriend loved them so much, he ate 3 fresh out of the oven.  I LOVE this recipe!  Marsha, I just have to say that you have no idea how much I appreciate you putting this recipe out here.  I have a Christmas tradition that I started with my sone the year my mother died.  On Christmas morning, we each have a Cinnabon and a cup of English tea, and I always gave him the gift I felt was most special to open at that time.  We've done this for 13 years - even while he was away in the Marine Corps (phones are wonderful).  Now, we don't have to worry about trying to find a mall where we can buy Cinnabons.  I emailed the recipe to him so that he can enjoy the cinnamony goodness you shared.  Thank you so much!  By the way, jsut in case I forgot, did I mention that I LOVE, I LOVE, I LOVE this recipe?

Great recipe, but you don't need to use a bread machine. Just sub one packet of yeast for the bread machine yeast, and proceed from there. I mixed my dough in my Kitchenaid mixer with a dough hook for about 10 minutes, then let it rise till double. Make sure you use a 9X13 pan, otherwise the rolls won't have room to spread out when you let them rise the second time. I also doubled the frosting, and flipped the rolls as soon as they came out of the oven. Perfect!

This is a fabulous recipe and a wonderful indulgence.
Instead of applying the butter to the rolled out dough and then sprinkling the sugar/cinnamon, I blend the sugar and cinnamon with the butter and then spread it on the dough with a metal spatula. It's a whole lot easier to roll this way and there is less mess and the cinnamon stays with the roll, not on the counter.

Super easy tip: 
You can buy bread dough in the freezer section of your grocery store. Simply defrost the loaf in the fridge (so it doesn't rise too much) and then roll it out & follow the rest of the recipe. 
Also, I found that after you sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mix onto the dough, pat it down. It keeps the mix in the cinnamon roll! 
Great recipe, thanks!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!  I made these the night before.  After cutting I placed in a pan covered the top w/plastic wrap and placed in the refrigerator.  Next morning place the rolls (STILL COVERED) in center oven rack, place a pan of boiling water under rolls.  Rolls will double in size in 30-60 minutes.  Remove rolls and water from oven.  Follow directions for baking.

I made these Thanksgiving weekend and they were excellent.  Extremely easy. Note: I've made these again, and if you don't have a really warm kitchen, let them do their final rise in pan overnight covered with plastic.  They were twice as big as the first time I made them!

I found this recipe before Christmas, and really wanted to try it, but was intimidated about making the dough without a bread machine, so I asked my mother-in-law to get me one for Christmas.  I have made these twice, and my 11 year old rated them, on a scale from 1 to 10, as a 12!  He and my hubby love them and wish I would make them more often.  The bread machine makes it very easy.  You will NOT regret trying this recipe.  The only change I made was to use canola oil in the dough instead of butter or margarine.

This recipe really is great - I always try to add fiber and other nutrients to my recipes, so I put 2 cups of white flour and 2 1/2 cups of spelt flour. I also used butter instead of margerine...and I didn't have any cream cheese on hand, but a regular powdered sugar frosting was still great!!

These were okay.  I think I just prefer the Cinnamon Roll Recipe II better. This recipe took more work and the rolls were only okay.  The frosting is good, though.  I prefer the other recipes where they cinnamon rolls taste like the soft yeast kind that your grandmother used to make.

Amazing! Exactly like Cinnabon!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for margarine in the dough, I used Smart Balance, and I kneaded by hand. Didn't use all the cinnamon and sugar, but I did sprinkle some on the top before baking. I found the amount of frosting to be perfect. Definately follow the other suggestions about 350 for 20 mintues. Perfect and alot cheaper :)

maybe it's just me but i didn't really like this, it is definitely already sweet enough without icing....and i made it fat free with free products and it was soft when it first came out of the oven but turned hard quickly, but that might be b/c i used fat free ingredients.  other people liked it enough.

I made these with a stand mixer and my hands, not with a bread machine. They were awesome! I used 4 cups bread flour then the rest was all purpose flour for kneading and rolling. I also divided the dough in half and cut each log into 9 pieces for a total of 18 small buns rather than 12 huge ones - still baked in a 9x13 pan. This size was better especially when taking them to a potluck. Stand Mixer Method: Dissolve 1 tbsp of the sugar from the recipe in warm (100-110F) milk. Stir in yeast and leave to proof for 10 minutes. Using the dough hook, add beaten eggs and melted margarine. In a separate bowl, combine 4 cups bread flour, remaining sugar and salt. Gradually add this to the yeast mixture. If dough is still too wet, add additional all purpose flour to form a shaggy, slightly sticky dough. Turn dough out onto floured surface and knead a few times to form a smooth ball. Place in greased pan, turning to grease the top of the dough, cover and let rise. Continue with the recipe from this point on. **I let my dough rise in the oven (turned off, door closed, oven light on) with a pan of hot water underneath for moisture and warmth.**

I made my first successful cinnamon roll with one of the other recipes, but this recipe worked out unbelieveably great.  Finally a cinnamon roll that I (a beginner) could make, and it came out awesome.  One suggestion.  Increase icing amount by 33%.  That's 4 oz cream cheese, 1/3 cup butter, 2 cups powdered sugar and 2/3 teaspoon vanilla.  I hate feeling like I have to ration ingredients, especially icing!!!!!!!!!

So good!  I want to make some right now!  I made them without a bread machine by following another reviewer's directions - Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl. Mix in the sugar, margarine, salt, and eggs. Add flour and mix well. Knead the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with flour. Put in a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Then pick up with rolling out the dough.

I made these for a neighborhood Easter brunch and they were AWESOME.  Most people ate 2 and several ate 3!  I don't have a breadmaker so I just made the dough in my mixer with a dough hook.  I let the dough rise for about an hour, rolled it out added the cinnamon/sugar mixture, cut them and put in the glass casserole dish and kept them in the fridge overnight.  Baked the next morning and they were perfect.  No need to make the same day.  Sitting in the fridge overnight did not hurt them at all.  The only other thing I did differently was added softened butter to the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Thank you for a delicious recipe.

I use the filling and frosting recipe from here and it is fabulous! A tip so that the filling does not run all over is to add 2 tsp. corn starch or xanthan gum to the brown sugar/cinnamon. It makes it gooey and it will stay inside the dough better.

Using the instructions for non-bread machine rolls given by several reviewers, these came out perfect and amazing!  I made them for a family reunion and I blew everyone away! Hooray! 
I don't know why mine didn't rise originally (as the instructions said they would), but once they went in the oven, they sprang to life, so don't stress if they don't double in size (twice) like the directions state!
YUM!

Holy Cow!  A yummy way to get really fat!  I will be making these again!  I read some of the other comments and here's what I did, NOT using a bread machine: Preheated oven to 200-Mixed dough ingredients with my hands and kneaded into a ball-put dough into bowl,covered with damp paper towel, and placed in warm oven (TURN OFF OVEN!)-Wait about 1 hr. to double in size-remove from cooled oven and follow directions as stated.  I used Splenda brown sugar and could not tell the difference.  
Icing: To do it right you've GOT to double the frosting!  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was still WAY AWESOME!

THROW OUT ALL OF YOUR OTHER CINNAMON BUN RECIPES BECAUSE THIS ONE IS IT!  What a hit it made with my hubby on Sunday morning!  He said it tasted better than the original Cinnabon because he didn't have to trek to the mall to get it, and the aroma from the oven made the house smell so good!  I used the suggestion of other raters by preparing the recipe the night before, just having to pop the pan into the oven in the morning.  If you want to supersize the bun to emulate a Cinnabon, cut 6 to 8 slices instead of 12, and be sure to invert the pan onto a serving tray after baking to allow the cinnamon and sugar to drizzle down the sides. Thanks, Marsha, for sharing a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! My whole family and my fiance's family love them. I don't have a bread machine either but never need one. Just proof the yeast in the warm milk for 10 minutes, then add the rest of the ingredients and put the dough in a warm spot to rise. I followed another reviewer's tip and turn the oven on at 250 degrees for about a minute, then turn it off, cover the dough in a damp paper towel and put the bowl in the warm oven for an hour.
    Here's another tip my sister-in-law taught me: if you don't have bread flour, use regular flour (I use unbleached all-purpose) and add wheat gluten. 1 Tbls wheat gluten for every 1 cup of flour. Add the Tbls wheat gluten to your measuring cup, then fill the rest with flour. These turn out perfect every time!

Yum, yum, yum!!! Hubby and the kids couldn't get enough, so I will be making these pretty often from now on. I have tried using a scone mixture instead of the dough, and that works well too. Plain sugar frosting is a less creamy option, which I've used when I didn't have cream cheese. Not quite Cinnabon anymore, but still yummy.

I don't think there's much I can add to the thousands of reviews on this recipe... amazing!! I made them in my Kitchenaid stand mixer by following some of the tips from other reviewers who didn't use a bread machine, and letting the mixer do the kneading - it only took a few minutes on speed 2 with the dough hook. I didn't make the frosting from this recipe as I had leftover cream cheese frosting from another recipe, but it seems pretty similar to the one given here. *EDIT: I've now made the frosting in this recipe and it's definitely very good too!

Absolutely incredible!  I used other reviewers suggestions for non-bread machine baking and also combined the brown sugar, vanilla, and butter before spreading on the dough.  I prepared the rolls the day before and let rest in the fridge overnight then baked in the morning.  Excellent with the cream cheese frosting!

Great recipe! I did not use the bread maker and made the dough by hand. I mixed the yeast (1 7gram package) with the warm milk until dissolved, then added sugar, salt, eggs and margarine. Then mix in flour and knead until a dough ball, using flour on my hands to form. I then put dough in bowl, covered with a damp towel and put in oven at 150 for a hour, douogh was about twice the size.  I also suggest flipping the rolls onto wax paper after they come out of the oven, let the yumminess coat the other side. I used a little bit more cream cheese for frosting to cut the sweetness a bit, about 1 once more. Very good recipe, will make again.

I went threw pages and pages of reviews trying to find out how this recipe works after being frozen.  I took a shot and here's what I have to say--this is a great cinnamon roll recipe.  Everybody raved about them the first time I made them--one day in advance, sat in fridge overnight, and then baked in the morning.  The next time I made them on a Wednesday up until the point of putting the cut cinnamon rolls in the pan. I put the entire pan of unbaked rolls in the freezer until Saturday.  I took them out on Saturday and set them out on the counter for a few hours, and then refrigerated them overnight.  I baked them Sunday morning.   They were not the same, to me.  They were more dense and less fluffy.  The family still raved and said they couldn't tell a difference, but I could.  I probably won't freeze them again. If I don't have time to make them the day before, then the fam will have to go without!

These were amazing! I was a little worried about the dough because it seemed overly sticky. I made these without a bread maker (proof yeast in the warm milk w. 1/4 c of sugar for ten min, added butter, eggs, salt, remaining sugar, then flour 1 cup at a time, knead til smooth, let rise 1 hour) I ended up adding between 1/4 and 1/2 c more flour than the recipe called for to make the dough easier to handle but this doesn't seem to have effected the end result at all. Also as another reviewer suggested I mixed the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together and spread this on the dough instead of sprinkling sugar. The only way I could get this mixture to spread evenly was by using a butter knife repeatedly dipped in warm water. I also added about 1 T of milk to the frosting to get it the consistency I like. The first thing my bf said when they came out of the oven and he saw me frosting them was "omg, one of those big ones is $6 at *insert name of mall chain here*!" so Marsha isn't the only one thinking of saving $ with these! Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Outstanding! I'd love to make these for Christmas morning, but I don't want to spend all my time in the kitchen, and I'd like to have them done while we're still opening gifts. Is there any way to do part of this recipe in advance?

Yummy Yummy Yummy!  Made these rolls for my Bible study girls and they loved them.  Did not use a bread maker, and made the night before.  After assembly, covered and put rolls in the fridge, in the AM placed in oven with a pan of water, that had been preheated to 200, then turned off, let rise for 30 min, baked as directed.  Better than Cinnabon!  Worth the effort and will make again.

Ooooh (dissolving into cinammon roll heaven).. Seriously, this is probably the best recipe I've tried from this site. I was able to get 25 normal-sized rolls out of this recipe. I was concerned about what the texture of the rolls would be like, since I really don't like "bready" cinnamon rolls. But the texture was dead on - rich and sweet. The icing is wonderful, too. My ONLY gripe about this recipe is the oven temperature; I wouldn't bake them at more than 350 degrees, even if you have to increase the baking time.

May,13: I LOVE IT!! I just love it.. it looks, tastes, and smells great. I 100% agree with adding greased wax paper to the baking pan, and leaving good 2 inches between the rolls as they wonderfully increase in size. Next time I may increase the filling a little bit. The iceing is just right. I halved the quantities as it's only me and my husband. Still, I got eight big cinnamon rolls. My husband thought they are the best he has ever eaten anywhere else "by far". I'm sure I'm gonna try it again and probably make some little suggestions.

May,30: Ok i've tried it today again, and after preparing all the ingredients I realized I only had one egg, so I did it only with one egg and it turned out just as great. You can never go wrong with this recipe.. I SIMPLY LOVE IT.

Superb!  I usually make the dough and assemble/cut the buns the night before to save time in the morning.  Just cover the pan with a damp cloth then plastic wrap.  I then let them sit at room temp for approx. 10 minutes, then let them sit in the oven as it warms to bake.  Compliments abound every time I have made them!

This recipe is sooo good.  My weakness is cinnamon.  And these are by far the best cinnamon rolls I've ever put in my mouth.  The one thing I did to make my cinnamon rolls come out perfect is, I baked then in a glass baking dish, which made for nice done rolls with a bit of ooey gooey brown sugar on the bottom.  YUM!  When I baked them in a metal pan the brown sugar was too crusty and hard.  This is a must try recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

These were not as easy to make as I had imagined from reading the other reviews: it's quite a work-out to roll out the dough, even though I let it relax for the recommended time. Granted, I have never made cinnamon buns before, and even though my dough was not a perfect rectangle, the rolls were still quite good as well as pretty after baking. I froze about half of them because there are only two of us at home, and I am looking forward to baking and eating them later on. I baked 6 of them, instead of the 12, in a round glass pie dish instead of the 9 x 13 pan. The dough also took quite a bit more time to rise than 30 minutes, actually more than double the time, but the result was still good.

Delicious and very easy!  I had never made my own cinnamon rolls before and I can't believe how simple and quick it is to do.  I did not use a bread machine but instead listened to reviewers who said you could do it without.  I have made these three times. One of the great things about this recipe is the fact that I always have these ingredients on hand. I definitely think that 2½ tablespoons of cinnamon is too much; they tasted overwhelming spicy/burned cinnamon tasting.  I prefer them with a ONE heaping tablespoon (but that is strictly my personal opinion) After cutting the rolls and placing them in your pan, make sure you let them rise for 30 minutes prior to baking.  The first two times I made them I forgot this step.  The last time I included this step and the resulting rolls were light/melt in your mouth delicious. I also make them with a butter/confectioners sugar/milk/vanilla glaze and not the heavy cream cheese icing.  These rolls are too good to cover up with thick cream cheese.  A+ recipe!  Thank you.

I never thought I could make cinnamon rolls from scratch or add anything to this recipe that could make it better than it already was, well this recipe proved me wrong twice because not only did I made them, but I think  I improve the taste by simply adding 1/4 tsp. of almond extract to the icing.  It really gave it the final touch.

The dough was very elastic. I had to put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before rolling it. I think next time i'll bake it in muffin pans. Also, the icing was delicious but had little bits of lumpy cream cheese. i was too lazy to stand there and smooth it out. Very sweet, very yummy

I made these Christmas morning, the family loved them!  Used someone's recommendation to turn them upside down immediately upon removal from oven to allow filling to cover tops again.  Next time, I will use a larger pan as I felt they were very crowded and some of them were a little doughy.

OMG.  What a fantastic recipe. I didn't do them in a bread machine, but let them rise in a convential oven on the yeast rise cycle (100degrees).  These were superb.  My family loved them. Only once left, wonder who's gonna get that one.  Thanks so much.

Loved it.  Had family over from Thanksgiving and made these for breakfast the next day. Had to make them again the day after that as everyone loved them.

Also used parchment paper and they did not stick at all.  No scrubbing the pan from the melted brown sugar.

awesome! I must say, I cheated though... got to the icing part and realized that we didn't have any cream cheese left. Used Duncan Hines Cream Cheese frosting... never tasted a Cinnabon before, so I can't compare... but these were phenomenal!!!

Soooo good! My husband just asked me if I could make about 5 dozen more for him to take to work on Monday. I put all the dough ingredients in the breadmaker last night before I went to bed so that the dough was ready when I got up this morning. Just rolled it out, put the filling on it, let it sit on the stove top for 30 minutes while the oven was preheating and baked for 15 min (they were a little more brown than I would have liked but that's my dumb oven's fault.) Great treat!! Thank you!

I've make these rolls 4 times without using a breadmachine or mixer & baking at 350 for 20-25 min.: the first 2 batches were sensational but the last 2 batches were just awful!  The last 2 batches resulted in hard, dense rolls that didn't brown like they should have.  I would suggest that you check the expiration date & proof your yeast before adding to the flour mixture.
WEIGH your flour!  4.5 cups of flour equals about 558 grams.  Kneaded dough should be "smooth and slightly shiny, almost satiny".  My failed batches weren't... probably because of too much flour.  Rolling the risen dough onto a surface sprayed with Pam was much easier & had a nicer result than rolling onto a floured surface.  I cut 26 rolls out of the batch which was a mistake.  You can definitely make these without any special equipment...try again if your batches haven't come out right.  I would imagine it might be because either the yeast isn't activating because it's old or the liquid was too hot or cold, too much flour, or it hasn't risen enough before baking.

WOW!!!!! These were awesome!  I made them for company that we had over for the holidays, and they raved and raved that they were better than "that store in the mall".  It's the icing that does it.  I replaced 3/4 of the bread flour with whole wheat for extra fiber (will probably do all whole wheat next time, with the addition of vital wheat gluten to help the rise).  I also used light cream cheese in the icing with no problems.  To make these (up to one month)ahead of time, make and assemble the rolls as stated in the recipe, and then place them in the greased pan wrapped with plastic wrap and foil and place in the freezer. The night before baking them place them in a cold oven and let them sit overnight.  In the morning they will have thawed and completed their second rise, and will be ready to bake.  Take them out of the oven, unwrap, and place them back into a PREHEATED oven and continue to bake according to recipe instructions. Top with icing and devour.  Your family will no doubt have a new found love and respect for you!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't have a bread machine, so I did all the kneading by hand.  I also had the same problem with my rolls not doubling after cutting them so what I did was cover the pan with aluminum foil, baked it at 250 degrees for 30 minutes and boy did it doubled!  I then upped it to 350 degrees, removed the foil and it came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing.  P.S.  the lady asking about why her rolls are coming out not moist and soft, you're probably overcooking them.

These are amazingly like the ones I can't resist at the mall!  As I type I'm trying to resist having a second one.  I made a couple minor changes- decreasing the temp. to 375 and increasing the bake time to 20 minutes.  With no bread flour on hand I just used all purpose flour and they still turned out perfectly.

It's a wonderful recipe, microwave to reheat and they taste "just out of the oven" again! I also bake in a bundt pan, frost and serve for a different appearance, same great taste! Thanks so much, they are my favorite!

This recipe is truly incredible.  It does take a while for the rising and the rolling out, but the effort is definitely worth it.  Just be warned that when they come out of the oven they are VERY hot.  The center of the rolls stays hot a lot longer than the outside.  My husband has burnt his tongue several times since he's so eager to get at them.

Great Recipe! Thanks Marsha!Everyone loves these rolls. I have sent them on fishing trips with my hubby and others in my extended family have requested them for their freezers.! I bake at 375 degrees for 23 minutes exactly. I like someones suggestion of using a jumbo muffin tin so they can bake separately. I'll have to try it next time.

I had not been to Cinnabon in a long time since there are none where I live now. I had one just a few weeks ago though, and the ones I make from this recipe are soooooo much better. Fluffier, gooier, tastier. Just plain better in every aspect. Plan ahead to make them though. The longer you can let them rise the better. Start the day before, and let them rise for a good 3-4 hours each time. Put them in the fridge overnight after the second rise, and then it's an easy bake and serve breakfast the next morning. P.S. I don't use a bread machine, just a stand mixer and keep the dough warm for the first rise.

I loved this recipe.  I put butter, brown sugar and pecans in the bottom of the pan before I added the rolls so they would have a sticky bun top after baking.  I also rolled pecans in with the butter and sugar.  They were awesome!

This is the closest recipe I have found to a "Cinnabon". I followed the sweet dough recipe as stated except I used almond milk instead of cow milk. Still came out perfect. 
For the filling I adjusted my cinnamon back 1/2 Tbl. This will depend on the quality of your cinnamon. Cinnabon uses a high quality korintje cinnamon. If you have great cinnamon you will not require quite as much. I rubbed a thin layer of butter in the rolled out dough and mixed the rest of the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter together and rubbed on dough. 
I made my own icing according to my favorite cream cheese icing recipe. Whip your frosting with the whisk attachment for 5-10 minutes to get the airy fluffy icing texture. 
When it came to baking: if you do my have parchment lightly spray with non stick cooking spray. It them it took approx 30min covered to double in size prior to baking. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes, they were cooked but moist all the way through. I did not frost the whole pan, we are frosting them as we eat them.
This will be our new cinnamon roll recipe and will debut at poker night soon for our friends. Be careful, it's hard to have just one!

I don't know how many times I've made these cinnamon rolls!  Everytime I make them I receive so many compliments.  Great recipe.  They're a very close match to the real cinnabon.

I follow this recipe EXACTLY as stated and these are THE BEST! I've made them numerous times and have never had issues with the center oozing out. I often times will prepare them in the evening and then leave them in the (cold) oven overnight to rise. In the morning they are PERFECTLY risen, ready to bake and enjoy.

Wow!! Just finished making these....absolutely incredible! I followed the recipe as written (except for 1) subbing in butter for the margarine as that is what I keep on hand and 2) not using a bread maker as I don't have one). While it takes some time, it is easy to do. I couldn't believe I had made these from scratch...they are SOOOO good! Makes me look like a pro. Definitely try this one out!

This recipe is great, but made a few changes. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, muscovado sugar in place of brown. Both worked fine. Also, I don't have a bread machine, but using the kitchen aid mixer worked perfectly, with normal yeast. Finally, after putting the buns in the pan I covered the pan with plastic wrap and put the rolls in the fridge overnight.  Then I took them out in the morning, let them sit for 45 mins, then baked. Also, flipped them out of the pan as soon as they came out of the oven as someone else suggested, thanks. Perfect clone for Cinnabon!

WOW!! These are AMAZING! I had a group of people over for dinner and they all said that they are the best cinnamon rolls they have ever had, even better than Cinnabon! My husband is a huge cinnamon roll fan and even said that they are the best he ever had!  I don't have a bread machine so I mixed the milk, sugar and yeast together and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it was bubbly and then mixed in the eggs, salt and butter.  Next I mixed in the flour and then kneaded it with the dough hook in my kitchen aid mixer for a few minutes until it was a soft ball. I put it in an oiled bowl, covered it with a towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about an hour until it was double in size. I then skipped to step #2. I will make these often!

Trick is not to overbake these rolls to get them nice and soft. Overbaking will dry them out. Very delish indeed. Made pizza rolls using the same dough.

The ultimate key to the frosting is to add 1-2 teaspoons of finely grated orange zest, then frost the rolls about 4-5 mins. after they come out of the oven. People will try to guess what that extra layer of flavor is! Just orange zest! So simple, but so delish!

FREAKING FANTASTIC!  This is the BEST recipe for cinnamon buns I've ever tried.  I did double up the brown sugar as suggested by some other reviews as I like a sticky sticky bun.  One tip to get that super tender cinnabon dough on your buns is to cover the pan loosly with foil while cooking for the first 10 minutes.  Remove foil for last 5 minutes of cooking and DO NOT overcook or the dough will be hard instead of tender.  And of course flip it over into another pan as soon as it comes out of the oven, all that good goey stuff in the bottom of the pan will drip all over the buns.  YUMMY!

It is so good and you get tons of gooey icing! I hate it when there isn't enough goeyness! We live in Colorado at 7,000 ft. and had to cut the bake time by a few min. YUM!

Easy to make without a bread machine.  Warm the milk to a temperature that feels the same as body temp (which means it's 95-105 F), then add the yeast and sugar.  Wait to see it foams a little, then add salt and butter.  In order to get the dough manageable to knead I had to use probably about 5 cups of bread flower.  Allow an hour for the dough to rise in a warm place.  For baking, I did 20 minutes at 375 degrees.  And at first I doubted whether there was enough icing but they were perfect!

5 stars for the cinnabon, 3 stars for the icing.  The icing tasted good, but looked lumpy.  Definitely look up another icing recipe as others suggested.  I made the 6 serving version and it was exactly 6 nice sized rolls.  I let them rise in the fridge overnight and they looked PERFECT in the morning.  I baked them in a cold oven turned up to 350 for about 20 mins and that worked out perfectly.  I used a metal pan and flipped it over onto a plate to get the cinnamon from the bottom...what a great trick!

This are wonderful!  My family said 5 stars were not enough.  I even made them allergy friendly for my milk allergic son and used Rice Milk and Earth Balance instead of butter and milk and it still turned out delicious.  I made the dough in the bread machine last night, put it in the fridge after the dough cycle was done and then did the rest of the prep this morning for fresh warm rolls out of the oven for Father's Day.

AWESOME!  I made the frosting using half powdered sugar and half granulated sugar (thought I had enough powdered sugar) and it turned out fine...I let it sit over night so it disolved.  Great recipe!

These are by far the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made. Be warned - the dough is VERY sticky. I had a heck of a time rolling the dough and getting it into a log. Next time I will try the butter cooking spray as another reviewer suggested - flour doesn't cut it.

Very.  very.  very.  delicious.  
when I make cinnamon rolls I usually double or triple the batch and freeze two batches after they're formed and in pans.  when ready to bake I let them thaw and have their second rise before I bake them.

Made this recipe with my bread machine exactly as described and was thrilled with the results. (I used a package of rapid rise yeast which was exactly 2 1/2 tsp). The best cinnamon rolls I have ever made myself and some of the best I have ever tasted anywhere. I think the frosting is perfect! Also, we love lots of cinnamon so 2 1/2 tbs was just right for us. These are large and filling, you will only need one each for breakfast or dessert. Even my teenage boys could only eat one they are so rich and satisfying. The best advice on here is to flip them out onto a cookie sheet as soon as they are done and separate them as they cool so the filling stays in them.

Great recipe. I made these for my Dad because he loves cinnamon rolls. I don't have a bread machine, so I used my Kitchen Aid, it worked perfectly. Once I formed the rolls I put them in the refrigerator until the next day. They rose perfectly in the refrigerator and they were a big hit.

Great! Finally made this to make comparisons with the other cinnamon rolls I've made and my family voted that the frosting to this is a keeper but the dough we love best goes to the cinnamon rolls lll (AR)...hands down.

wow these really live up to their name. the only change i made was to use bread flour and i didn't use but about 3 and a half cups and i also used active dry yeast and did everything the old fashioned way with my stand mixer and dough hook because i don't have a bread machine. i tried this recipe before i learned how to make yeast bread and i turned out dry and boring but i tried it recently after i have learned a lot about bread making and i realized that you never follow the flour amount exactly. i start off with half the flour and keep adding a little bit at a time until the dough comes together. the wetter the dough the softer and more moist the bread. also i always use bread flour. i always use kosher salt. and i always use my kitchenaid mixer. with me improving me method not the recipe i was amazed along with everyone else. they are definetely something to serve when you are tring to impress. also when you use bread flour your rising time is a lot shorter.

Unfortunately bread flour was all out at the supermarket when I went, so AP flour had to be used. Surprisingly the rolls still came out with a good texture, although the outer part of the rolls was a bit dry, so next time I will brush with butter. I used mascarpone cheese for the frosting instead of cream cheese (personal preference) and these were absolutely delicious. As others suggested, if you don't have a bread machine let the dough sit for about an hour or until it is roughly double in size, then resume from step 2. Also, if you're not using a bread machine and use packaged yeast, make sure you give it about 10 minutes to dissolve in the warm milk.

Good rolls. However, I found that less flour is needed - the dough comes out quite stiff. Also, there is way too much sugar/cinnamon filling. Using only 4 C of flour makes a good dough (without the risk of breaking down the bread machine.) I used Betty Crocker whipped cream cheese icing and the end result was great - and time-saving.

These were really yummy, but very rich and sweet - neither my husband or I could eat more than one.    I made them exactly as written and baked in a glass 13X9 pan.  I do have a couple of hints  1) This makes a lot of dough, as much as a 2 lb. loaf.  Be sure your bread machine can handle it or cut it in half.   2)  I used King Arthur bread flour (my favorite) and had to add almost 1/4 cup water to get the dough to the right consistency.  Be sure to add it only a tablespoon at a time.  As it kneads, your dough should become soft and shiny - this makes tender bread.  If your machine is struggling, you may need more liquid. 3)  Like other reviewers, I mixed my butter, sugar and cinnamon mixture together before spreading over the rolled out dough.  This worked to keep most of the filling inside the roll 3)  After rolling up, cut off the ends of each roll to make them nice and straignt then cut roll into 1 1/2 inch buns. If you want to use the ends, put them together to make the "cook's sample" 4)  I cooked mine about 17 minutes.  You can tell they are done because the center of the roll should rise above the sides, but don't get them too brown! 5) Cool buns slightly before removing from pan and placing on waxed paper to ice

I don't know, I must have done something wrong b/c this recipe has so many great reviews, but mine were just BAD. They LOOKED good, but the flavor was was just bad. They tasted nothing like Cinnabon, and the texture of the frosting and the dough was not great either. I made this recipe to the T. I will not be making these again, they were too much work to go through if they come out this bad again.

According to my friend that worked at cinnabon, the key is to add a little lemon juice to the frosting. She said use as much lemon juice as you do vanilla in your frosting. Great recipe. I'll us it for years to come. I made it on christmas even and put it in a pan in the fridge overnight for christmas morning.

Adding my 5 stars to the 2000+! I followed the recipe exactly, and added some raisins and chopped walnuts. These are BY FAR the easiest and BEST tasting cinnamon rolls I have EVER made. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! ♥

These were very good.  I took some of the advice and flipped the buns onto a cookie sheet when they were done baking so the buttery sugar and cinnamon mixture would coat them.

This recipe doesn't really need another testimony to its fabulousness.  Instead, I will offer another baking method.  I use Rapid Rise yeast when I bake these.  One packet of yeast combines with the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl.  Then add the wet ingredients (I combine the milk and margarine) heated to 130*.  Then add the eggs.  Fortunately, I have a Kitchen Aid, so I let it take the dough to town with the dough hook for 5-8 minutes.  You could also knead by hand.  Let it rest for 10 minutes, then roll out and fill.  Roll up, slice (dental floss can't be beat for this), and place in greased pan for the final rise.  I usually do this part overnight.  Just cover those babies up and let them sit out on the counter and get fat and happy.  In the morning, bake as directed and watch your family bow down in the presence of your excellence!

I am struggling to see why this recipe was rated a four time and time again. First of all, if you are making a true "clone" of a cinnabon then you need to use vietnamese cinnamon. Secondly, if you want the gooey cinnamon mix to stay between the rolls you need to add flour to the sugar mix, cook at a lower temperature and for a longer time.  It also has to do with how you "roll" your rolls.  The bottom section needs to be silghtly compacted together as you roll with the "top" of the bun rolled looser. You need to chill the rolled dough for about 30 minutes. Place your rolls in an oversized muffin tin and cook. They'll "pop up" and the mix will stay inside the roll. Finally if you want the true flavor of a cinnabon you need to add vanilla, allspice and a pinch of clove to the sugar mix.

I'v died and gone to heaven, that's how good these buns are! I used all purpose flour, and made them from hand. I accidently mixed the melted butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon, it still came out great, I just spread it evenly over the dough. Also, my hubby does not like sweetend cream cheese, so I used confections sugar with milk, and warmed it on the stove to melt the sugar, and drizzled it over the cinnabuns, they came out great!! And probably a little less fattening, without the cream cheese. I will definatly make them again.

SUCCESS!!!!!!!!! One of my many 2008 goals for this year include making yeast cinnamon rolls. It was soo fun!!! I chose to make them at ohh..midnight?!? And fridge them for the morning. My bread machine recipes all showed two cups but when I had put this recipe together I realized there was over twice as much!! But, it worked out wonderfully. My favorite part was the cutting and rolling. I didn't know how I was supposed to use the butter so I melted it and rubbed it all over the surface. Sadly, I suck at cutting. I got a dozen, barely, with two puny ones and the rest ginormous. When I woke up to let them rise, one was missing!!! My little brother had eaten a whole unbaked roll..>.

I just finished eating one of these and it was sooo good! I've been wanting to make these for a while now and finally did because I needed to use up some cream cheese frosting I had made. Well, they were pretty easy to make and this is the very first time I've made cinnamon rolls that didn't come out of a tube. I did halve the recipe so I got 6 big cinnamon rolls. I don't have a bread machine, so I followed some other reviewers advice. I mixed the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together for the filling and I have to say it was plenty. Also, I flipped the pan over onto a cookie sheet right after I took them out of the oven so all that gooey filling would recoat the rolls, like other reviewers said. These really were great and I know I will make these again.

Perfect 10 - this recipe needs 5 more stars becuase it is perfect and maybe even better than the store-bought rolls.  Yummy!  We will make this often, exactly as the recipe directs.

Never had a cinnabon one before, but I was left a little disappointed. Tried this one and the 90 min cinnamon recipe from here, at the same time, to see which I preferred and the 90min ones were gone in no time, no one took a 2nd cinnabon, they went back to the other pan! I think the cinn mixture should be doubled (a little bland) and there was too much dough/bread taste to them!

Wow! is all I can say.  I made these as the recipe stated last night and put them in the refrigerator overnight covered. I let them rise this morning and then baked them at 375F for about 15-17 minutes.  They are definately a "Clone of a Cinnabon."  I am so excited. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

i used bread flour and i think that's what ruined it. Super super dense and they had an off taste. Maybe my bread maker was too small...but my advice is to NOT use bread flour, use all purpose instead.

Delicious. For a small potluck, I prepared the original recipe's 12 buns up to the final rising stage, then only rose and baked six and froze the other six. This morning I got the second half from the freezer, let them thaw and rise, and baked them according to directions. They turned out just as beautifully as the first batch!
Don't be afraid to freeze your fully prepared but not-yet-baked roll dough!

This recipe was terrific!! I live pretty far away from a Cinnabon and I wanted a recipe I can make at home and this really is it!! The bons come out fluffy and full, very satisfying.
 Like some other reviewers I don't have a bread machine, so this is what I did:
 I separated the milk in half, putting the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar into 1/2 cup of the milk for about 10 minutes. I mixed the sugar, butter and salt with the other half cup until the butter was melted. I mixed the yeast mixture, the butter mixture, and the eggs together with the flour until it became a dough and allowed it to rise for an hour (using the oven techinque of another viewer).
 I've made cinnamon buns before and I have found that it's easier to mix the butter with the cinnamon/brown sugar before spreading it onto the dough, this prevents it from leaking out during baking.
 I also noticed another used who was looking for a carmel sticky sauce with pecans, I wanted the same thing and I used: 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of butter. Heating the butter over medium heat until melted, add the brown sugar. Allow the mixture to bubble for 3 minutes.

hi, I just wanted to say THANK YOU to all of you have said such wonderful things about this recipe. I added it to this site I think almost 5 or 6 years ago and every once in a great while I peak back to read so many wonderful, kind reviews. I'm GLAD so many are enjoying it as much as my kids and I do :)

I made these rolls this morning for a carry-in to the office.  I used a store bought cream cheese frosting because I didn't have the cream cheese at home.  I used probably about 1/2 c. more brown sugar in the filling.  They are absolutely superb!  I definitely recommend giving this one a try.  I WILL be making these again.  Another hint; if you're making these for a morning event, you can assemble and let raise the evening before and refrig. after the rolls have risen and bake in the morning.

Excellent recipe.  Just as good as Cinnabon.  Wow!  I'll be saving money.

I've made these twice.  Fist time, I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly!  I just made them today with half white flour and half whole wheat flour, and I am a bit dissapointed.  I will still to white flour from now on.  This is a keeper!

1/29/07   I rate this recipe a Ten.
Everyone should try this recipe.These rolls were out of this world.  
I did  follow  the recipe  that Marsha  wrote for her Clone of  Cinnabons, but I did make a few changes in the ingredients as follows.

Add 1/4 cup of water and 1 cup of milk  instead of what this recipe called for.
Add  1/2 Cup of melted butter instead of what the recipe called for.
Addd 1/2 tsp. of salt instead of what the recipe called for.
Add 1 tsp. of vanilla, Marsha's recipe did'nt have  vanilla and I add this ingredient.
Try my changes in this recipe. I promise you won't be sorry.
I rolled my douugh out on a greased cutting board,it works so much better then rolling it out  on a floured surface. 
I put my cut rolls in a greased cake pan and cover them and  put them in the refrigerator and  let them rise over night in the refrigerator and take them out the next morning for 45 minutes.
Uncover rolls and bake at 350 for 30 minutes.
After you take them out of the oven Imediately turn them upside down on a cookie sheet.
Only frosten what your going to eat,as
You can freeze what you don't eat.These rolls freeze really well.
These rolls taste as wonderful as the ones you buy at the supermarket in the can. 
If you love to bake or want to try making cinnamon rolls this recipe is super delicious.

What more can you say. "Clone of Cinnabon" Says it all. I made this twice. The first time I cooked it at 350 and they were perfect. The 2nd time I cooked it at 400 and they were a lot dryer and the brown sugar crystalized. Not as good at 400. Way better at 350!

Holy bon, bon!!
These are really, really good!
I did exact, except to add some walnuts and rasins.
My second time making these and I added maple flavour to icing(just drizzled onto bun)and topped with walnuts..YUM!
2nd time in a week!! This time I melted butter and added br. sugar and cinnamon like some else suggested. I like this better as it is not as messy as the brown sugar falling out everywhere:)

Cinnabon is taboo to my diabetic husband; but now with this recipe, he enjoys the clone minus the frosting and reduced brown sugar.

I cannot tell you how delicious these cinnamon rolls are, you HAVE to try this recipe.  I even had to put the rolls in the fridge before I could bake them and you would never know it!  I followed the advice of others and this is what I did:
-Glass pan
-350 degree oven for 28 min.
-flip them out right away
-combine yeast and warm milk first
-let rise an hour and a half

These were fabulous!  So soft and moist.  As suggested by another reviewer, I combined the butter, cinnamon and sugar in my food processor, then sprinkled it on the prepared dough.  None of the filling ran out and therefore, no problems with the buns sticking to the metal pan.  I lowered the oven temperature to 350 and baked them for about 21 minutes.  I also agree that a single serving of the frosting was plenty.
  When heating the milk, place the milk and butter in a saucepan and heat just until the butter melts, no longer.  This should be the correct temperature when you add the yeast to the entire mixture, as you don't want the liquids too hot.

I don't have a bread machine so I just use the dough hook of my mixer. If doing it this way, it's best to mix less than half of the flour with the liquid first and add the remaining flour gradually. I also use just all-purpose flour, which may be the reason why the dough is sticky, but I like the gooeyness.  Many people made comments on the cinnamon sugar running to the bottom -- I think this is because 1/3 cup is too much butter for spreading.  I probably use about 3 tablespoons only, really just to make the sugar and cinnamon stick to the dough -- apparently, too much butter defeats this purpose.  By the way, I had the same problem when I tried the second rising overnight in the ref.  Lastly, one time I was making this I ran out of milk.  I used half cup evaporated milk diluted with half cup of water, and I loved the result!  The bread came out creamier, so I've been doing it that way ever since.  As suggested by many, I lowered the temperature to 350 for 20 minutes.

These are a real treat. One thing I suggest is to spoon your flour into the measuring cup whenever you are making bread or cake. If you use the cup to scoop out the flour, you are packing in too much flour. Always spoon it in and you will notice a big improvement in your baked goods.

These will be, by far, the best cinnamon rolls you have ever had.  Go back and read the other reviews, they really help with this one. Make sure you cream together the ingredients for the filling and spread the combined ingredients over the dough (this keeps more of the filling in your rolls instead of on your pan), and taste your filling to make sure you have about the amount of cinnamon that you like.  I increased the amount of filling by about a half because i like mine really gooey.  Also, use a glass pan if you have one, and adjust the cook time to 20 minutes at 350.  When your buns come out of the oven flip them out of the pan, and scrape the extra filling drippings back over them (this makes them completely gooey and delicious, and also eases cleaup by leaving you with less sugar in the pan), and then frost them immediately.  They are absolutely delicious and reheat wonderfully in the microwave, and i am told they are even amazing cold.  Next time i am planning on trippling or even quadrupling the recipie and freezing a couple batches for a rainy day.

I own a bakery/cafe and am always looking for something new for our customers. Haven't been very happy with the cinnamon rolls we've had and have been looking for a replacement.  THIS IS IT....amazing.  Changes made:  no changes in ingredients they're fine.... we don't use a bread machine so did the following...try it before you discard the idea...put all ingredients into your mixing bowl (flour, margarine,eggs, milk, salt, sugar AND YEAST) ... I don't know what bread machine yeast is but plain old yeast did it for me.  Make sure you are using high gluten bread flour and also that your milk is hot enough.  Mix until it comes together and then a minute more.  
Follow the recipe and you'll be enjoying the best cinnamon buns in the world!  For the filling I did try melting the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon as suggested..didn't spread as evenly as I had hoped but they were still great....I'll try using melted butter and sprinkling on the dry ingredients to see how that fares. Icing is, well, the icing on the cake.  An absolutely wonderful recipe! Thanks Marsha!

This recipe took along time to make but was worth it. I did have one problem though, my dough didn't rise again after I cut it and put on a baking pan. I also thought there was to much icing. I will try it again.

The Best Cinnamon Rolls ever!! I don't use the bread machine because i prefer to hand-knead the dough myself. I do, however buy a box of hot roll mix instead of making the rolls from scratch.  This saves a lot of time, and its so easy.  I just follow the directions on the box, then follow the directions in this recipe for the rest-DELICIOUS!!!

I found this recipe delicious, but it takes a long time to make, because the dough needs to rise a few times.  It was very sticky, and took a lot of work with the dough.  VERY GOOD.

These turned out really good!  I had been wanting to try them for awhile - but there are only two of us at home.  We each had one and I took the rest in to work and everybody (who were lucky enough to snag one)loved them! One lady said that they were BETTER than Cinnabon!  I expected them to rise more after they had been cut into rolls, but it could have been that my yeast was old. They were still wonderful!  NOTICE TO FIRST TIME CINNIMON ROLL MAKERS (like me):  rolling out the dough takes patience and elbow grease, but don't give up!  Flipping the dough from time to time helps.  The results will be worth it!  Also - at first the frosting will look too dry and like you may need to add a bit of milk - just keep mixing!  It'll get smoother and creamier the more you mix!  Beyond yummy!

I've made this recipe frequently and everyone loves it. I do find that it is a stiff dough that labours my bread machine and that this recipes makes 12 large rolls that requires in my household a few days to consume. I have successfully made a smaller batch by dividing all the ingredients by half, rolling the dough out to 12 by 14 inches, slicing into 9 rolls and using an 8 by 8 inch square baking pan. This amount is nice in that it can be consumed while the rolls are still fresh.

My second time making cinnamon buns and I decided to give this recipe a try and I'm glad I did.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and let sit overnight in the refrigerator after first rise and took them out in the morning and let sit in warm spot for 30 min or so before baking them. Made in 2 pans to not overcrowd and they turned out perfectly in 15 minutes.  This is a definite keeper and go to recipe for cinnamon buns from now on.  Thanks!

Love this recipe! These are now a holiday breakfast staple. I make the dough the day before and let them rise for 30 mins before placing them in the fridge overnight. They continue to rise in the oven the next morning.

No one else has said this so I am posting the problem I had with this recipe. The bread machine kneaded the dough then which was very solid -- not nearly enough liquid in it, yet I had used the cup of milk and two very large eggs. I had to remove it from the machine, add water by guessing, and use the processor to make a softer dough. It is now doing its rise in what I hope is warm spot. I checked another recipe book that called for two cups of liquid for six cups of flour. I am surprised I'm the only person who has posted about this problem. I have no idea what it will be like but with the ingredients it ought to be good -- but dough heaviness remains to be seen.

These were AMAZING! Made these for Christmas morning and the whole family loved them. My only complaint is that when I took them out at 15 minutes they were still raw in the middle. It needs to cook for longer. Next time I would bake them at a slightly lower heat for about 25 minutes.

Our family raves about these!  I use one of the suggestions here (DBDCook - Review 5) and make it the night before and in the AM stick it in a cold 350 degree oven for 25-30 minutes.  They're perfect every time!  We usually double the recipe and make two small 8 inch pans and freeze them for later.

I made this a couple days ahead of time. I put the filled, unrisen rolls in the refrigerator. When I was ready I took them out and put them in the oven at 175° with a glass of water. Once they rose I took the water out and baked as directed. Worked great!

These were delicious! I love the texture of the buns. I didn't use a bread machine, just mixed it up like any other yeast bread recipe and kneaded it for a few minutes. I think next time I'll knead a little longer to see if I can get it even fluffier. Next time I will use a lot less sugar in the filling, they were way too sweet! Probably half would do. I also added walnuts and raisins...delish! Didn't use the frosting here, just a simple icing sugar/milk one. With these minor adjustments, it's a keeper!

So I used to work at cinnabon for many years. I have eaten many...too many. They do use a little lemon extract in the frosting maybe half as much as the vanilla and the cream cheese and butter should be the same amount by weight. But either way cream cheese frosting is always good

Yummmy...fantastic recipe. I have made this a few times and they are well liked by everyone who tastes them. I don't have bread machine so followed AndyTami's suggestions (Feb. 03, 2004) and cinnamon rolls turned out perfect.

I just made these for the first time. I'm a Cinnabon aficionado (you could call it a hobby) and these rival the best. The dough is perfect and it was easy to work with, and the filling is perfect although I think I will make extra filling next time as there was not nearly enough goo at the bottom of the pan. The frosting tasted a little different than Cinnabon's, but it was still very good. 

I don't see a reason to ever go to Cinnabon again now that I know how to make my own for a small fraction of the cost. I especially like that I can use regular ingredients without wondering about possible preservatives and transfats (I subbed butter for margarine) that are probably in the originals.

My family LOVES this recipe! We made a 1/2 batch because I had not been successful at making cinnamon rolls up to this point, by the time they were going into the oven, we were working on the 2nd FULL batch!! Only negative... we consumed 18 cinnamon rolls in less than 24 hours! 

As suggested by a few reviews 1. for the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture - I mixed both into the softened butter & crumbled over the dough  2.I sliced the first batch w/ dental floss & the second batch with fishing line - this tip was awesome, worked wonderfully!!

These are fool proof! I am adding pictures only because I still can't believe I created something so beautiful! My previous attempts at making these have been a complete failure! We made everything exactly according to the recipe! 5 Stars!! Delicious!

Waaaaaaay too much cinnamon. Half of what is called for, or even just a teaspoon would be sufficient.

I've had this recipe saved for years to make, but either never had the ingredients, time, occasion or excuse to eat such a rich and delicious breakfast. I finally made them last night and baked them this morning, and wow! They were worth the 3 year wait.
I use my kitchenaide stand mixer to prepare the dough. I made the bowl warm, warmed the milk and mixed in the yeast. (Make sure to check the expiry on your yeast if you don't bake often). Once dissolved (Aprox 10 minutes) I mixed in the other ingredients using e dough hook. I let it rise in the oven (preheated to 200 than turned off, covered with a damp tea towel). Then I rolled out the dough and added the cinnamon mixture. I rolled from the short end of the rectangle. I didn't have a tape measure so just guessed the size. i cut the dough roll with a sharp knife in half, then each half in half again and then each quarter into 3. I put them in a glass baking dish and into the fridge over night. For the cream cheese frosting I took just less than half of a brick of cream cheese (our cream cheese is sold in 250 gram bars- which is equivalent to 8 oz). Mixed everything together and put int he fridge over night as well. In the morning I baked for 25 minutes in a 350 degree convection oven for 25 minutes. Once out of the oven I spread the soften icing (took it out of the fridge earlier) over them which melted a little more. Mouth watering amazing! And really not that hard to make! The house also smells amazing for our morning guest

These are wonderful. The dough is very nice to work with it.  Don't have a bread machine, followed others advice and used my kitchen aid mixer, worked really well.  My kitchen still smells wonderful.

These are delicious! I don't have a bread machine, but used the info from a comment here and it worked great. As other reviewers said, these are great if you make them the night before and put them in the fridge. I liked them better when I let them rise a little before baking, though. For the cinnamon filling, I melted the butter and mixed the cinnamon and brown sugar in to make it a spread (I made twice as much as the recipe calls for). We like lots of frosting at our house so I doubled that, too. Adds calories and fat, but at this point, who is concerned about that?!?!? If you are, just stay away from this recipe :)

Mmm!!!!  What a fantastic recipe!  I love to have a reason to use my bread maker.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and ended up with the tastiest cinnamon rolls ever!  I think they were even better than Cinnabon!  I took one reviewers suggestion of flipping the over once I took them out of the oven, I scraped the melted brown sugar filling off the bottom of the pan, flipped them back in, spread the cinnamon sugar mix on them and then topped with the icing.  perfection!  Next time I will try refrigerating the dough so I can have them freshly made in the morning with a nice cup of coffee!

Absolutely delicious, I am very happy I found this recipe. I have never had Cinnabon cinnamon roles so I can't compare. Now that I have this recipe I don't need to. The only thing I did differently was mix the butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar mixture into a paste to be able to spread it all over more evenly, turned out fantastic.

I realized after I tried the recipe that you need to cut off the uneven ends and make the remaining rolls similar in size.  I don't think anyone else mentioned this - that I saw anyway.  If you don't, you will have 10 even rolls and 2 crazy rolls.

Very nice recipe; many thanks to the reviewer that suggested using dental floss to slice the roll. Over 30 years cooking/baking and I never thought of it!

I made this without a bread machine, and it turned out a little denser than I would have liked, to be honest. Not sure if I needed to knead it longer or if my yeast may be a bit on the older side. Results were good enough to give a five star and attempt again. Great frosting --- I did add a pinch of pumpkin pie spice to the frosting and the spices kicked it up a notch of yum. :) Thanks for sharing.

We would give this 25 stars if we could!!!
Room temp eggs are very important or it will take much longer to rise.
Made this for a special friend and they HIT THE SPOT!
Easy, impressive, and delectable!

Made with 2 Tablespoons ground flaxseed and 1/2 cup warm water instead of (2) eggs.  For those cooking for family members with a food allergy - this one hit the spot!

These are great but if you want them for breakfast - you better be an early riser. Took a long time to get them done....but they are very good!

Another stellar review for this recipe! Very good! I'm not an experienced baker and these turned out great. I used my KA, starting with the paddle ans finishing with the dough hook. I also left them in the frig overnight before the last rise and took them out 30 minutes before baking as Trishie suggested. I didn't use even half of the icing and they were plenty sweet. Thanks! Great recipe!

The recipe is perfect if you follow carefully.  I wait awhile to add the frosting.  If you add frosting immediately after the buns come out of the oven the butter in the frosting separates and it turns oily.  Wait a few minutes to spread the frosting.  I usually wait 10 minutes so the buns are still warm but cool enough so the lipids in the butter don't separate.

To dreamich2003. it seems like your problem is yeast. Bread machine yeast should be available in the supermarket near bread machine mixes. If you are not using a bread machine use a quick rise instant yeast (in sachets) You have to KNEAD the mixture till smooth and springy, then REST in a warm spot in a bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. After doubling in size, punch down and roll out. After its all ready in pan give it a while  (20 mins ish) to rise again before baking.

Followed the recipe except I used AP flour as I didn't have any bread flour and used butter instead of margarine. The bun as sweet enough without the cream cheese topping. I made it with KAid, even though it first looked too dry, it still doubled beautifully and non sticky at all to the surface. The only problem I got was that the brown sugar did not melt after baking, they remained grain-like so next time I will def. beat them along with butter till creamy first. Took out another star cus I honestly think it was too dense. Soft and sticky yes, but TOO heavy and DENSE (moist?). Oh, and I baked for 25min 185C, was fully cooked and wet.

I've been making these cinnamon rolls for quite some time now, and I finally got around to writing a review.  5++++ STARS!  Phen-ominal!  I can't say enough good things about this recipe :)  I did, however, make the dough by hand, as opposed to using a bread machine.  I usually make two batches at a time, one regular, and one with about 1c chopped pecans added before rolling. Yummmmy! :~)

Absolutely Delish! These are they BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever had! I followed the directions exactly and they were perfect! I've made this 5 times and my family loves them. I tried the KitchenAid method, but it didn't work as well as the bread machine version. A family keeper for sure!

I guess I am one of the few who did not like this.  There was way too much sugar in this recipe.  I thought it would melt away with the butter and make a caramel sauce but it didnt.  The sugar just remained in the bun and made it very sweet and very grainy.  This bun also does not need frosting.  My family ate them but did not love them at all.  The cooking time for these did not turn out for me either.  They got really dark on top and under cooked in the middles.  That may be do to the altitude changes but I usually do not have problems cooking as directed on recipes.  These were good tasting once you got past all the sugar tho.  I suggest cutting sugar in half and cooking them at lower degrees for longer time.

This hardly need another review, but had to mention how DH's face just lit up when he took a bite. Divided dough in half, baked in 8x8 pans, one to bake right away, the other pan in fridge until morning.

Great recipe!  Two things:  recipe is very forgiving; thought I ruined first batch with wrong water temp. but it turned out and 2nd batch I added raisens & nuts.  Also, myfitnesspal says a cinnabon with icing is 320 calories, where this recipe says 525.  Lets hope Fitnesspal is right.

My hubby says they are just about the same as cinnabon, a little less doughy perhaps. I say this is a good thing! I only had butter in the house so i used that. I will double the amount of cinn. mix next time because there was no ooze which i would have loved to have. I baked it for 30 min at 350 and they are amazing!

I can't believe how many people are giving this 5 stars... this is a decent cinnamon roll and good for beginners, but NOT a Cinnabon clone by any stretch of the imagination.  The dough is pretty good and easy enough to work with, though it benefits from the addition of 1/2 to 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or other flavoring of your choice (rum, coconut, etc).  Also, be sure to let the dough "rest" before rolling it out or it will be too elastic.  The cream cheese frosting is pretty good and is the right ratio of frosting to dough.  HOWEVER, the cinnamon filling is way off.  You can hardly taste it at all.  It should be doubled, at the very least.

I made three delicious foot-long FRENCH Breads (subsandwiches) using this recipe!!  Double the recipe.  Cut the sugar down to half.  Substiute 3/4 cup of the white bread flour for whole wheat bread flour.  Cut dough into thirds.  Roll dough into a foot-long like stick.  Press down the dough flat.  Allow to rise in the oven at about 170 degrees F for 30 minutes.  Bake at 375 for about 18 minutes.  Wallahhh!!

First time ever attempting to make this delicious dessert,  and it turned out to be the most exceptional Cinnamon Roll I have ever tasted! In my opinion, Cinnabon does not come close in comparison!! I do not own a bread machine so I made the rolls by hand.  As recommended by another review, I dissolved yeast in warm milk and added margarine, salt, sugar and eggs. At this time, you should add flour to mixture 1 cup at time.  When dough is kneaded and all flour mixed in, roll into a ball and set aside(covered) to rise for about 1 hour.  Now you can follow the rest of instructions from main recipe page... Try these Cinnamon Rolls because you'll NEVER want to purchase from the store or another venue ever again!!! Absolutely delightful:)

These are A-MA-ZING.  I don't have a bread machine and these turn out wonderfully made by hand.  I double the filling to make them extra gooey.    To save time, I double the recipe and after the rolls have been sliced I lay them on a cookie sheet with parchment paper and freeze them.  When they are frozen, they can be stored in the freezer in a ziplock bag.  The night before I serve them, I put as many as I want in a baking dish and let them thaw and rise overnight.  They are ready to be baked in the morning.    These also bake well in individual size ramekins if there's just a couple of you at home.

I halved the recipe for me and my sister... The 6 buns didn't even have time to cool... we gobbled them up straight out of the oven! They were DELICIOUS! Golden brown, soft, gooey and sweet. AMAZING - will never buy cinnamon buns again, since they're better and cheaper at home!!! And so easy to make too!  [edit] This is now my favourite yeast dough! Using this recipe I've been making buns with cream cheese filling, poppy seed filling, custard filling and fruit and each time they're just as fabulous!

Only one word, YUMMY! I made these almost exactly as directed(halving the recipe), except that I melted the butter to spread on the rolled out dough and then sprinkled the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on top. I baked at 380 degrees for 15 minutes. These are great, and worth the wait. I look forward to making these again, soon.

Really amazing... definitely NOT a Cinnabon though!! Hubby thinks they're better. Things i'll do differently next time--more cinnamon sugar filling. Great as it is written, we just like more gooey cinnamon filling. Took other reviewers advice and mixed all the filling together. Glad I did, it all stayed in the rolls, no major spillage into the pan. Also, I used all purpose flour with absolutely no troubles. I even used a bit less yeast, since the recipe calls for 2 1/2 Tsp. and a packet of yeast is 2 1/4. No worries, great rolls! Thanks!

Like this recipe needed another review but my oh my YUMMY! I made the dough in my bread machine. My machine came with a book of recipes and there is one for cinnamon rolls so I just put the ingriedients in the order that that recipe suggested. I made the rolls and put them in a wax paper lined baking dish that I sprayed with Pam, and covered them with clear wrap and threw them in the fridge. The brown sugar and cinnamon ratio was PERFECT. I think that is why these resemble the "Cinnabon" so well, it makes them ooey and gooey inside. Thanks for sharing

First time making cinnamon rolls from scratch!  I don't have a bread machine, so I dissolved one packet yeast in one cup warm milk and added 1/4 cup sugar.  I let that mixture sit for 10 minutes to activate the yeast and then added the eggs, salt, the rest of the sugar, a bit of vanilla (personal preference), and 2 cups of the flour and mixed well.  Then I added the other 2 1/2 cups of flour and kneaded until the dough pulled away from the bowl.  I set in a greased bowl, covered with a towel in an oven that had been preheated to 250 degrees and then turned off, and let the dough rise for one hour.  Then I proceeded with the rolling out portion of the recipe.  I made 78 rolls for my husband's co-workers and got rave reviews!  On two pans of rolls I combined 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, and 2 T. corn syrup in a pan over medium heat until melted.  I removed from heat and stirred in 1 tsp. vanilla.  I divided the mixture between the two pans and spread evenly in the bottom before putting in the rolls.  Presto - caramel rolls!  No need to frost!

THESE CINNAMON ROLLS ARE TO DIE FOR!!!!! I have spent years  trying to 'per-fect' the cinnamon roll! I found these are absolutely the perfect cinnamon roll!!!   Its one of my all time favorite things to make so I make cinn. rolls a lot.  I thought I would give this recipe a go since it had so many reviews.  I did tweak it a little based on a friends recommendation and tidbits I've read on the internet.  In the roll recipe, it calls for sugar.  I used honey instead to see if I could get an even softer and moister roll.  Sure enuf!! Honey did the trick! I also used a higher quality cinnamon.  Saigon Cinnamon.  I went to Costco and got a 10oz. container for $3.60. I certainly noticed a difference in tastes between my old cinn. and the higher quality cinnamon! I also used 1/2 c. heavy whipping cream in the filling and put on frosting as soon as rolls came out.  Uh, lets just say I skipped dinner that night and ate nearly 1/2 the pan.   Using the tips I just shared, I have never tasted a better cinnamon roll than these!! And I've made A LOT of cinn. rolls over the years. I think they  were MUCH BETTER than  the ones you get in the mall by far!!!!!

I don't need to tell you these are great.  2000 people before me have done that!  They are so easy!  I usually divide the recipe into 2 8 x 8 or 9 x 9 pans and bake one (usually make the night before, put in fridge, in a.m. let warm to room temp, then bake) and freeze one then let thaw overnight in fridge.  I put 9 rolls in each pan.  My family loves them.  At Thanksgiving I gave everyone a pan to take home to make the next morning or freeze and make whenever they wanted.  They all loved me!

To reviewer Julielynn...Yes you can make these the night before and bake in the morning.  That is the only way I have ever made these.  After making them you will obviously store them in the refrigerator overnight.  Pull them out in plenty of time to come back to room temp before baking.  They will take at least a couple of hours so plan accordingly.  I agree with other reviewers that these are best baked at 350 for a bit longer than 20 minutes.  Hope that helps!

I thought these were ok. I've never had the real Cinnabon to compare though. I added toasted cinnamon pecans to my rolls and a little cinnamon to the frosting. The frosting is great too.

Been using this recipe for years, it is wonderful! A few things I learned: Once you roll it out if you take your measuring tape across the roll you can "indent" where you should cut, then use dental floss (just place under it and cross on top). Also I melt a cup of so of ice cream (any flavor Vanilla, Carmel, ect) with some butter and brown sugar together and pour that in the bottom of the pan, then when done cooking I Flip them into another pan, extra gooey that way!

I was intimidated.  I did not use a breadmaker, used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer with the dough hook.  Not as hard as I thought.  This is my first attempt at watching dough rise, etc.  I left them in the fridge overnight and baked them in the morning.  They were FANTASTIC!

WOW were these good!!!!  They are very, very sweet (some suggested doubling the frosting - I love frosting and found that the original recipe amount is plenty).  I turned the oven down as some recommended and baked them a bit longer, they got somewhat brown on top but not burnt.  I also added chopped pecans in half of them - both with and without pecans they were great!!!!  I think they tasted pretty similar to a cinnabon, esp the dough - the frosting is a bit different but still VERY good.  They also reheated very well in the microwave and tasted just as good, if not better than the day I made them!!

Update 7/6/08 - made them again....they are sooooooooo good.  I omitted to say the first time I reviewed this recipe that I turned the pan upside down on a baking sheet lined with foil (for easy clean-up) for about 5 minutes after they were done baking to recoat the rolls with gooey goodness.  I made these again adding pecans to half of them - my husband and I can't decide which ones we like better!!!

I made these for our Mother's Day brunch and they turned out perfect!!  I don't have a bread machine so I used the tips from another reviewer (mcatherwood) which were spot on.  1.) 7-8 oz Active Dry Yeast instead of bread machine yeast.  2.) Mix with hands 3.) heat oven to 200 degrees and turn off.  Let dough rise in oven for 1 hour in mixing bowl with damp paper towels covering bowl. 4.) line 9x13 with buttered wax paper. 5.) I made my dough and assembled the rolls the night before and put them in the fridge overnight.  I took them out of the fridge about 1 hour before I wanted to cook them so they could come to room temp and rise a bit more. 6.) Bake at 350 for 20 minutes. 7.) Took the rolls out of the pan immediately then spread the frosting on top 8.) made double the frosting so we would have extra (also great for fruit dipping or Oreos).  Thanks for the great recipe and instructions.

Okay, I know this recipe doesn't need another review, but this is amazing.  I will definitely make again!  I doubled the amount of filling...next time I make it, I will also double the frosting because it was a little scant.  All in all, awesome recipe!

Ok, I have never successfully made cinnamon rolls until I found this recipe! Search no more! I don't have a bread machine either. I followed the suggestions from the first three reviews and that helped a lot. Be sure to eject them from the pan though onto wax paper. That is important! I made one pan with nuts and one without. My kids ate them up in the coming days...simply reheating before school. Thanks for a recipe for a lifetime!

I worked at Cinnabon a long time ago, and this is as close it gets w/out literally stealing their recipe. I agree with another comment....flip the pan to keep all of the cinnamon. Another variation is the pecan roll. Same recipe, but take a piece of wax paper, and press it in the bottom of your 9X13 pan. Use these ingredients: 
6 tbl unsalted butter, softened
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup brown sugar
30 pecan halves
Cream together the butter, salt and sugar. Spread this topping evenly on the wax paper covered bottom of the pan. Place your rolls on top of this mixture and bake as usual. While still hot,invert immediately onto a plate. If you wait until it cools, the caramel will harden and it will be difficult to turn out.

OMG so good. The icing rocks! I didn't realize that until after I iced themmine were  still alittle doughy. So remember to check that before you ice so they can be baked longer if needed.

This is now "my" recipe. I make this over and over, and it's the only cinnamon role recipe I will use. I found a way to make them ahead of time is to get them all ready in the pan, cover them with plastic wrap, and put them in the fridge until morning. Then pull them out and take off the plastic, set the oven to low (turn it off again once it preheats) and cover the pan with a towel and place it in the oven for about 40 minutes (or until doubled), then take them out, preheat the oven to baking temp, and bake! This way, they're ready in about an hour. ENJOY!!!

I just made these today and they are awesome.  I did not use my bread machine but did use my food processor with my dough hook instead of kneeding by hand. It's best to add liquids to flour when using your food processor   To do this, first stir in yeast to dissolve in warm milk (110 degrees) with sugar and salt.  Let sit 5-10 mins then add melted margarine and beaten eggs to milk/yeast and stir. Slowly pour into flour already in food processor and process while adding liquid just until the dough forms a ball.  I preheat my oven to 200 and then turn it off to create a warm, dry place for the dough then placed it in a greased bowl with damp cloth or paper towel covering it for 1 hour to rise.
I used the method of combining the butter and sugar/cinnamon into a spread - although we did find it harder to spread this on the dough it did not all leak to the bottom on the pan when baked so the rolls are full of the ooey gooey cinnamon goodness :0)
thanks for the great recipe !

I have been making this recipe for a long time, and it is one of my favorite recipes of all time.  I stumbled upon a solution to the much-lamented filling running out of the bottom that really makes them perfect.  When making the filling mixture, do everything exactly according to the recipe but double the cinnamon.  For some reason this makes it stick to the sides and they end up looking like the insides of Cinnabons, but it definitely doesn't make the cinnamon flavor too strong.  I have made three batches this way and they all turn out perfect.

This Recipe is truly inspired. I cannot tell you how good this was. you have got to try it for yourself to believe it. I didnt have bread flour so i used all purpose flour... a website suggested that you add 1 tablespoon of all purpose flour extra per cup to effectively substitute the bread flour. 
i dont have a bread machine and i followed the advice from the most helpful reviews on how to make it without. NO ONE can tell that i didnt use butter. I used vegetable ghee (widely available in south asia and often used as a substitute when recipes call for crisco or shortening). I used  tablespoons of cinnamon but if I had used the full amount I am sure it would have been good still. i did not make the sauce so i cannot pass judgement on that just yet. if you store them in an airtight box as soon as they are warm you can keep them from going hard. they are fabulous even the next day.. cant say more than that... they didnt last 24 hours in my house.

Just to add my applause to the list - these were fantastic! I also made by hand (no bread machine), and used a quick-rise method - placed the dough in a warm oven for 20 minutes, then when baking, started the oven on a very low temp for 5 minutes (150 F) and then cranked it up to the right temperature for 15 minutes. Amazing! I also used vanilla/cinnamon sugar and dark brown packed sugar for the filling. enjoy

Wow!  Excellent recipe.  I am a beginner bread maker and this is the first time I made these rolls...they turned out fantastic!  I didn't expect them to turn out so huge.  I did make a caramel sauce (taken from this site from another review of a diff't cinnamon roll recipe) to spread on the bottom of the 9x12 pan before putting the rolls in to rise a second time.  Caramel sauce - melted 1/3 cup butter, w/ 1/3 cup light brown sugar, and 1/2 cup vanilla ice cream till thickened and bubbly.  It made the rolls really ooey, gooey and so fantastically luscious.  I also flipped the pan over so the caramel sauce and the cinnamon sugar will recoat the rolls and flipped it back after 5-8 minutes or so.  Next time I will bake at 350 for 20 minutes instead of 400 at 15.

Not having a bread machine kept me away from this recipe for quite a bit, until I read the reviews.  I followed the directions and advice well and was skeptical as it was my first time but they turned out great!!  I dropped them off for my boyfriend this morning for his birthday and he said 'these taste better than the mall ones' followed by 50 'I love you's'!  So worth the time!  Will be making these VERY often!!  **For those of you who said the mixture leaked out during baking:: After I cut the rolls I unrolled them and then rolled them back up so they became tight again and there was barely any mixture left on the bottom of the pan**

I'm in love....lol.  And very impressed with myself- they are so beautiful!  I used my Kitchenaid because I have no bread machine.  I warmed up the milk and melted the butter in it, added the sugar, and when this mixture measured 110 degrees (on my meat thermomter) I added the yeast and let it bloom for 10 minutes.  Then added the rest of ingredients.  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and Neufchatel cheese.  The dough was a little sticky.  I let it rise for one hour, then proceeded with the recipe.  I might reduce the brown sugar a little next time, these were pretty sweet.  I did not double the icing, and it was the perfect amount.  If I had doubled it like many other reviewers, I would have had waaaay too much icing left over.  I used natural, un-waxed dental floss to cut these.  I had trouble making each one exactly the same size, but no one seems to care!  Now I know I can make cinnamon rolls!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the bread machine made these very easy.  I've never successfully made any sort of rising bread before, so I was happy to have very clear instructions.

We only used about 1/2 the icing, so I'll adjust next time, and I'll cut the cinnamon a bit (I love cinnamon, but I think the stuff I used was very strong).  

Other reviewer tips I followed:
- flipped the pan once they came out of the oven to coat the rolls in the filling, and it worked wonders.
- baked in glass vs metal, and they turned out nicer than the first time I made them
- baked at 350 for 25-30 mins

Thank you for sharing this recipe - they are a wonderful treat!

**I just realized I used an 8oz package of cream cheese instead of a 3oz package!  That explains the not-too-sweet taste and the amount of icing left over.  It was still delicious!

Although I thoroughly enjoyed making these from scratch cinnamon buns - I wasn't entirely impressed.  The overall flavor was good, but not close to resembling a cinnabon!  I used 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar and increased the cinnamon to 3 tablespoons.  I didn't bother making the frosting as stated in the recipe.  Too much butter and not enough cream cheese - so I recommend:  8 oz softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, and a generous tsp of vanilla (or almond).  This will give you a true creamy (cream cheese flavor) frosting and not an overpowering icing... so you can enjoy the flavors of the cinnamon bun without it being toothachingly sweet.      

This recipe can be done without a bread machine.  I don't own one so I did it with my Kitchen-Aid stand mixter; everything came out as it should.  (Let milk, sugar and yeast sit for 10 minutes.  Add other ingredients, mix well, then slowly incorporate the flour 1 cup at a time.  Kneed dough until it pulls together.  Turn out onto floured surface - lightly flour dough so it's not sticky.  Clean out mixing bowl, grease the mixing bowl with butter, return dough to mixing bowl; cover and let rise 1 hour in a warm place.  Follow remaining steps as indicated in the recipe.  
  
Rated 3 stars because these weren't the "the BEST" cinnamon buns I've ever had.  Delicious, but just average.

I have made this many times (and again this morning!), and we just love it. I will be making these as holiday gifts. My only comment is this time, I put them in the fridge over night, and into a cold oven, and turned it to 350. The rolls were not as nice and fluffy as they usually are, so I will stick with letting them rise on the counter, and then bake.

This is the exact same dough recipe that is in my "Better Homes and Gardens" cookbook--that old classic with the red & white cover.  LOL!  Just a slightly different filling and icing.

For a lower calorie roll, divide dough in half.  Roll each half into a 12X8 rectangle.  Spread with half of the butter and cinnamon mixture.  Roll from 12" side.  Cut each 12" roll into 12 1" pieces--a total of 24 rolls.  Bake in 9" round pans at 350 for 20-25 minutes.

I make mini-rolls by cutting the dough in half, rolling into 12X12 sheet, spread with half of the butter & cinnamon mix.  Then cut in half and roll up each rectangle from the 12" side.  Cut into 1" rolls.  Repeat with the other half of the dough.  You'll end up with 4 dozen mini-rolls. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes.

If you want to go a tiny bit healthier...use half whole wheat flour.  ;-)

These were awesome!! I did add a little more milk and yeast to the dough and I added lemon juice to the icing before beating it for 12-15 minutes. The icing was truly "to die for" and the rolls came out  perfect. I used my bread machine to make these, and I have to say that it was so easy! This was my first attempt ever to make cinnamon rolls and my family raved about them. Thanks for such a great recipe!!

Grrrrrrrrrrrrreat!!  I made these for my husband who had never had a cinnamon roll! (was he raised by wolves?  I think so!)  He is also allergic to eggs, so I substituted the eggs with Enrg egg-replacer.  They turned out sooo well.  I was really pleased.  They looked so nice when they came out of the oven, too.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

YUM, these came out absolutely perfect!  They looked and tasted like the ones you'd pay several dollars a piece for, but they are cheap to make.  Yes, you need to invest some time into this recipe, BUT it will be worth the wait.  The neater you roll out and shape the "roll" of dough, the prettier they will be.  The amount of cinnamon & brown sugar for the filling is right on, and the only additional item I added was gluten, because I put it in almost everything that goes into my breadmaker.  OH- and you really MUST make the icing to have an authentic experience.  IMO- if you don't have a breadmaker & want one, go to your local Goodwill store.  (I got an excellent one that looked brand new for $10.  Just make sure it has the blade and the basket.  Even if it doesn't have the instructions, you can pretty much use any you find on the web.)

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with the fluffiest, gooey-ist, most delicious cinnamon rolls ever!  I find most homemade recipes to be too dense.  Not these.  Better than Cinnabon because you know exactly what's in them and can feel good about serving them to your whole family for a treat.  My three year old and one year old (I left the icing off hers) loved them!  Next time, I am going to follow the advice of other posters and make ahead for the morning.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I really liked these! The dough is not the same texture as cinnabon, but the icing is dead on. Cinnabon dough is a lot more light and fluffy. The dough in this recipe is a little more dense, but still gooey. Also, who ever says to double the icing is insane. The buns are sweet enough and now I have 2 cups of extra icing sitting in my refrigerator. Its SO sweet. I suggest following the recipe and then make another batch of icing if you want a heart attack later!

These are easy and taste great!  Brush over with a little milk before baking to get a nice shine on them.  I made 20 smaller ones (they were about the size of a tennis ball once baked) as my children are very young.  Can't wait to start using this basic recipe to relpica sweet rolls at my bakery - apple and cinnamon, and caramel!! Thanks for the recipe. Made these with caramel - out of this world, my husband ate half the batch in 1 day!  I used canned caramel, half a cup did the whole batch, spread thinly - yum!

Very Yummy!!  I did make the night before in bread machine and refrigerated overnight after I cut them.  I took out in the morning and let sit for 45 minutes before cooking.  I would suggest placing buns in 2 dishes- 1 is too tight of a squeeze and they get larger when cooking. I cooked 375 for 20 minutes..as per others suggestions.  I didn't need to make extra icing..there was plenty for all the buns.  I did however use an extra teaspoon of cinnamon.   A nice treat.

YUM!!! I just made these tonight and boy were they worth the wait. I found the dough very tough to deal with and it seemed rather hard on my breadmachine due to the heavy dough, but they came out great! I used a cream cheese icing recipe that I already had but it was almost exactly the same as yours but doubled. Thanks for sharing.

OMG! 
I've never had any luck using yeast in ANYTHING. I make hockey pucks. These puffed up slowly but surely to phenomenal fluffiness!! Roll em tight so the ends don't flip out. I used dental floss to cut them. I put 6 big rolls in each 9x12  pan and let them get REALLY BIG- they look EXACTLY LIKE cinnabons! I used 1C of powdered sugar in the icing and came up a bit short, so  double the icing recipe. I mixed the filling ingredients together too. I'll try with makara cinnamon next time but these were SO GOOD with the regular stuff I doubt they can be any better. My family is in awe. Just be patient and let them rise, it will pay off :D I wanted to dance in the street with glee. I think it's the bread flour. I'm trying a white bread now HEE HEE!

As my husband said, "Just like TJ Cinnamon's!". These were wonderful. I did decrease the cinnamon and brown sugar just a little, based on others' suggestions. Next time I will keep the brown sugar at one cup. Last night I made them in the bread machine, rolled them out and put them in jumbo muffin tins. They sat in the fridge overnight. After setting them out for 30 minutes this morning, I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes. They were even good without icing! Will make again soon with frosting. Thanks for sharing; I'm putting this recipe in my cookbook.

These were delicious!  I halved the recipe, and mixed the brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon before spreading it on the rolled out dough.  After rolling and cutting, I placed the buns in a baking dish and stuck in the refrigerator overnight.  The next morning, I took them out an hour before breakfast and let them rise, then baked for 20 minutes at 375.

Today is Pentecost Monday, it's raining, and all the stores are closed here in Switzerland.  Perfect for cinnamon buns, espcially these clones.  They are excellent, as always.  However, I only had 1/2 cup brown sugar so I was forced to expreiment.  I spread the left-over half of the dough with butter, white sugar, and sprinkled it with amaretto.  The liquer dribbled out when I cut the roll, but the taste was fine.  
Anyhow, I recommend these to any cinnamon bun fan.

We loved this recipe! We used the original Makara cinnamon that Cinnabon sells and they were almost exactly like the real thing. Me and kiddos decided to change the name to CinnaMOM!

I used a bread machine (which made it so quick and easy), turned down oven temp to 350 for 20-25 minutes and placed the pan on the rack one down from the center, and added toasted walnuts to the brown sugar and cinnamon filling - 12 rolls, gone in 2 days :) I have always wanted a good roll recipe but had been intimidated by thoughts of sticky dough, messy non-rising or dry results - this recipe was very EASY, neat and with a FANTASTIC taste! Reading others reviews and comments really helped to make the recipe flow smoothly - thanks to whoever suggested greasing a sheet of waxed paper with butter and putting it on the bottom of the pan when rising & baking - clean up was a snap and the rolls looked like showpieces!
THANK YOU MARSHA!

I've never had enough confidence to try cinnamon rolls but I thought I could maybe do this...Well they were excellent. I found the dough very easy to work with and my daughter who doesn't care for cinnamon said she even liked them. I'm anxious to try and make these at night to rise in the refrigerator so we have them "HOT" for breakfast.

Thanks for sharing the Cinnabon recipe!  To me it tastes exactly like a Cinnabon.  I followed recipe exactly, no changes, and they came out perfect!  The recipe couldn't be easier.  Throw everything in the bread machine, and it was easy to roll out, too.  Just the right ingredients, these were perfect!

I tried this recipe - thinking the whole time that I would never be able to do it - but they were awesome!  My bread machine was broken, so I had to make the dough by hand and they STILL turned out.  I just used regular yeast and let it rise in the oven for an hour at 200 degrees (it's turned off before you put the dough in).  I also used floss to cut the rolls, which worked really well.  One note - I had to add more flour both times I've made these, although it may be becuase I made them by hand!

THESE ARE SO YUMMY!!!  My kids love cinnamon rolls in the morning so I tried making them the evening before.  I did all the steps involved including letting them rise 45 minutes. After letting them rise I just covered the rolls and popped them in the refrigerator over night and in the morning they were ready to go directly into the preheated oven...turned out GREAT!

Everyone loved these!  I make it w/o a bread machine.  It will raise faster if you heat an oven to 200 degrees then turn it off, then put covered dough in for about an hour.  Works best if you make the night before.

Best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! One adjustment is that I had to cook longer than the instructions stated (total of about 20-25 mins).

I could've sworn I've made these before but I have no photographic or reviewer proof, so maybe not.  I recently used this recipe to make the frosting only (had another recipe for rolls) and the frosting is totally easy and quick--although it helps to think ahead and soften!  Makes a good amount, is sweet, and a perfect topping for cinnamon rolls without too much fuss--all in all, a great recipe.  I will try to make the rolls another time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness I'm crying. These are soooo good!! As an American now living in Australia, cinnabons were my favorite growing up (until I learned what was in them!), but Australia doesn't really do cinnamon rolls, not like this anyway, so I haven't had one in a long time. I did make a few changes based on some of the reviews. I let the bread machine do all the sticky work (mixing and kneading the dough until it was smoother). I took it out and kneaded it a little more for about 10 minutes. I found the dough easy to roll out thin, perhaps because I gave it some extra kneading time and made it a bit stretchier. I combined the butter and cinnamon sugar and spread it on the rolled out dough. I baked them at 350 (175C) for 20 minutes. Perfect. Cooked all the way through, golden brown on top, no leaky filling.

I have a small bread maker (1kg) but all the ingredients fit fine. In fact I would not recommend cutting this recipe in half unless you're going to make the dough by hand because there wouldn't be enough dough to engage the hook of the bread maker and it won't knead the dough properly. These are very rich and sweet, so if that's not your thing then don't make these. People seem to be impressed that I made the dough myself, but it was very easy. I can't wait to impress all of my sugar addict friends with these!

Great recipe. I used a floured cloth to knead my dough on and also to roll the dough out into the dimensions as indicated.  Like another reviewer, I mixed the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter together and had absolutely no leakage from the buns while baking on a foil-lined, oil-coated 13 x 9 inch baking pan.  Baked at 350 for about 23 minutes on the bottom rack of my toaster oven (one that can fit a chicken in it). I did not change a thing.  In fact, the other recipes I have tried were good but didn't have enough cinnamon, and this did.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These are absolutely wonderful!  The dough is very easy to work with and has such a good texture once baked.  I'm not a big fan of icing on my cinnamon rolls so I increased the butter for the filling to 1/2 cup and decreased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 Tablespoons (personal preference).  After I took the rolls out of the oven I inverted them onto a foil lined baking sheet so that all of the cinnamon sauce that is in the bottom of the pan is put back onto the cinnamon rolls.  Yummy!!!

Let me start with - I am a fairly good cook and don't intimidate easily in the kitchen - BUT have never used yeast & I NEVER made cinnamon rolls. I scrolled through a lot of the comments and wrote down those suggestions that were common and came up with 'my' recipe.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  Here are some of my suggestions.
1.  1 1/2 times the 'filling' mixture.  I did 2X-was just a bit much for me.
2.  Frosting - made it as directed.  It's WAY to much. It's great but really too much.  Could probably do 1/2 to 3/4.  
3.  I don't have a bread machine so followed the nice folks suggestions on how to make it without a bread machine.  I did let the mix butter/warm milk with the yeast for just a few minutes and then finished it up.
4.  I doubled the recipe and it worked fine. Split the dough into two balls, let it rise separately and essentially treated it as two batches except for the actual making of the dough.
5.  I did brush the dough (once rolled out) with milk.  To be honest, I don't know if it really made a difference or not.  I just know my cinnamon rolls turned out great.  (this was one of the common suggestions in the comments)
6. Used parchment paper, flipped rolls for a few minutes and flipped back so filling goes back to top for a bit
7. I rolled & cut the cinnamon rolls and cut them.  Put them on parchment paper lined baking sheet and froze solid and then stored in zip lock bag.  Thaw overnight, covered w/plastic in pan you will bake in.  Perfect!

I baked for 15 mins and they were very undone. I split the recipe and froze half. I baked the second batch a week later and baked for 35 mins. Much better results. Wish I would have baked longer the first time. Also, does not taste like cinnabon but very good.

I think many people are making 2 mistakes. One is that they might be using regular yeast instead of bread machine or instant (also called rapid rise) yeast. If you are using regular yeast, you need to proof it first! This gives it a chance to start growing and will help your dough to rise properly later. Second mistake sounds like improper flour measuring. Are you scooping the flour out with the measuring cup? This compacts the flour and adds up to 20% more flour per cup. The dough will then come out dry or too dense. Go to the King Arthur flour website and watch their video (~3 minutes) on proper flour measuring. Speaking of King Arthur flour....the flavor and texture is heads and tails above the other ones in the store. Trust me, it's worth the extra dollar. They also have this exact same recipe on their site (called "cinna-buns") with a lot more direction. If you are a beginner or have questions, I would start there. Good luck!

Delicious! I don't have a bread machine so I used 2.25 tsp of regular yeast and let is sit in the warm milk for 10 mins. From there I added the sugar and salt, eggs, margarine, and flour.  The dough is EXTREMELY sticky so I recommend kneading it on a floured surface. You'll need flexible hard plastic spatula to get all the dough from the bowl. Knead for 10 mins, make a ball, and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and place in a warm spot for 1 hour. From there you can move forward with the directions as written. Definitely worth the extra work.  Thanks for the recipe.  Fabulous!

We love these. I always make the night before, then place dough in fridge overnight to continue the process in the morning. Pull out of fridge, let warm back up on counter and finish.

Awesome!  I made these for the first time the other night and they were a huge hit.  I made the dough in my bread machine.  I followed the advice and used a rolling pin to press the cinnamon sugar combination into the dough before rolling them up.  Let them rise a bit and baked.  They were amazing!!!

No bread machine so here's what I do: 

Add yeast and 1 tsp of the sugar to the warm milk, stir to dissolve, and let it sit for 10 mins until foamy.  I use shortening softened a bit in the micro for the dough b/c I don't use margarine.   I use my mixer to mix the dough on the knead setting.  

After it's formed a ball, this is sticky dough, I turn it out onto a WELL-floured surface and knead it a couple times by hand, form into a ball and place in a bowl sprayed w/ cooking spray, cover it with a damp cloth and let rise in a 200 deg oven that's been preheated and then turned off. 

After 1 hr, roll it out on a VERY WELL-FLOURED surface.  If you don't flour the surface well, you'll have a mess trying to roll your stuck dough off the surface.  

Roll a 16x21" rectangle, spread on butter and sprinkle/spoon/pour on the brown sugar mix, leaving 1/4" margin of no butter/no sugar at the far end of the rectangle so I can seal the roll, as another review suggested.  Also per said reviewer, I use my rolling pin over the sugar mixture to smoosh it into the dough and to compress it so it's not falling out all over when I roll up the dough. 

Cut into 12 rolls, use a glass 9x13 pan, cover and let rise 10 minutes in 200 deg oven again, cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.  No problems with loosing goo, so not sure why that happens to some.

Cooks perfectly in the a.m.  Frosting makes too much though.  I put it on when the rolls are hot or it's too thick.  The family loves it.

I'm never buying cinnamon rolls again.  This is simple and good!  I don't have a bread maker so I proofed the yeast by adding a package of active yeast to the warm milk & 1 tsp. of sugar - let sit for 10mins until frothy.  Added the wet ingredients and with the hook attachment on the Kitchen aid, added the all purpose flour until a ball formed.  Let rise and followed the recipe instructions from there.  I used dental floss to cut the rolls.  Baked @ 350 for 30 mins.  DELICIOUS!  Definitely worth the effort, though it wasn't much effort at all.  My family loved it.

OH MY GREAT GOOGLEY MOOGLEY!!  My family and I devoured the first batch immediately (minus the last one, everyone is always leery about the last one).  The first try was kind of dry, even with flipping them over to cool, though, so I made an alteration that made it all better and so wonderfully moist!  They were so easy to make and I'm excited to use this recipe from here on out! I did go with some of the alternate suggestions; I don't have a bread machine, so I used the first review to mix it up.  Immediately after they came out of the oven, I melted extra butter and mixed in more cinnamon and brown sugar, then I poured it over them, sealed it up with aluminum foil, let it sit for about 5 minutes, then (using a cooling rack to hold the foil and rolls into place)flipped the pan over and let it cool.  (plan to experiment with adding extra sauce before baking as well). When I served them, I just put them individually in the microwave or all together at a low setting in the oven.  Anyway, thank you so much, Marsha!!  They are fantastic!

These are amazing. I just use the dough recipe and they are very  fluffy and just like the ones as cinnabon. I had good luck with these over the summer because the yeast made the dough rise beautifully in the hot weather. For winter months I'll use instant yeast, double checking that the temp is between 105-110, then use the proofing button on my oven. As long as there are some great rising, this recipe will work perfectly. Good sweet icing too!

Much thanks to Marsha for the recipe! With a few tweaks I've gotten this close to my own experience of a Cinnabon--which I need to do since the only Cinnabon in town closed a few years ago and I don't spend much time in airports.

Increased the butter spread on the dough to a full stick (1/2 cup) and decreased baking time to 11 minutes 30 seconds to get the classic Cinnabon gooey center.   Recipe as written with 15 minute baking time came out too brown and baked in my oven.  I'm one of those guys who gets annoyed with the "excellent recipe, I changed everything" reviews, so I saved the changes as a new recipe called Clone of a Cinnabon trial 3.

Thanks again to Marsha!

I LOVE this recipe! I did tweek it though. I doubled the amount of ingredients for the cinnamon, butter and brown sugar. I found that the extra helped bring a more true Cinnabon middle. I also used DARK brown sugar instead of light. I also melted the butter down and mixed the cinnamon and brown sugar into it to make like a paste and used hands to "spread" it. For the icing I increased the amount of cream cheese to an 8oz pkg, 2 tablespoons of sour cream and 2 tablespoons of butter only because I like a sweet/tangy icing.

Very easy & while they are delicious, I don't believe these really taste anything like Cinnabon. I followed directions exactly & next time I will make another half recipe or even double the filling & make an extra half of the icing recipe. Again, definitely NOT Cinnabon's but yummy nonetheless.

Amazing!!! I live in UK but remember trying these when on holiday in America. Very very indulgent, my whole family loved them, even my husband who is usually pretty reserved with his comments about food couldn't stop complimenting me. Fantastic. Next time I make them I'm going to try and make smaller cinnabons and make more of them as 12 that I made were simply enormous, my 7 year old could only manage half of one!

These are absolutely amazing cinnamon buns. I even had the neighbors over as soon as they were done waiting to eat them. Everyone was raving about how good they are and asking me to sell them hahaha! Thank you so much for posting this recipe, and I will definitely be making these again and again in the future. No more canned cinnamon buns for this girl! Oh, sidenote, I didn't use a bread machine, I used instant yeast instead.

AMAZING!!!  I doubled the filling and icing however I didn't use all of either.  These taste fantastic.  I have never made cinnamon rolls before however we are going camping tomorrow so I wanted us to have a morning treat.  I'm pretty sure they aren't going to last until tomorrow!!!!!!  My 4 year old said "mommy these are so yummy in my tummy".  THANK YOU!!!!!

These turned out amazing! I read some reviews first to determine the best way to make them.  For the filling I cut the butter into the brown sugar and cinnamon using a pastry blender. This made it a little more difficult to spread but I had no fallout after taking them out of the oven. Line the pan with greased tin foil and clean-up is a breeze!

My husband couldn't quit talking about how good these were! I like to make a large amount and then keep them in an air tight tub to munch on for the week, and these were still nice and moist for quite a while! (and I live in a very dry climate) Of course, though, since they were so delicious, they didn't last very long. ;)

WOW, these were fabulous!! But very time consuming.  Used my bread maker to make the dough and used one reviewers suggestion to combine butter and brown sugar to spread over dough. Worked great.  My daughter sat in front of the oven waiting for them to come out! they were gone in a flash.

Exactly what it says!  Delicious - the smell in the house was amazing.  The hardest thing was not eating them all myself!

I have been making these for a couple of years now and nothing compares to these in other stores or bakeries. They are always a hit, and they even taste great when I substitute half of the flour with whole wheat flour, and when I use vegan substitutes for the milk, eggs, and butter. Way healthier that way too!

Never had a cinnabon, but these were delicious! Made exactly as written. Next time will try to make a gooey sauce on the bottom as that's how I usually eat them. Even without the sauce though these are fantastic and easy

This is absolutly delicious! This is the best recipe for cinnamon buns I have ever found. I personally always go with the recipe not with peoples comments but I must say this: 1. turn the tray around halfway through baking. 2. when making the icing taste it after you have added 1 cup of icing sugar. It is so sweet already and most defenetly doesn't need the extra 1/2 cup!

Wow! So rich! My rolls took quite a lot longer to rise, but they turned out fine in the end. If you are using AP flour, add one addtl egg white to the flour mixture to make up for the missing protein the AP flour vs. bread flour.

Well I rarely rate recipes probably because most are not 5 stars but this one I had too. I made this for a morning I had a houseful of kids who love Cinnabon, and every person had seconds. They LOVED them! I made the night before also, if anyone has trouble getting them to rise after you put them in the pan you really need a warm spot, I was running the drier so I put the covered glass dish in the laundry room and closed the door, in about 45 min they rose nicely. I then put them in the fridge, the following morning I put them on the counter when the oven was preheating popped them in at 350 degrees for 25 minutes and they came out perfect. I doubled the iciing recipe since I had many kids, the only comment I heard from almost everyone was if I make them again to cut the cream cheese amt in half for Cinnabons iciing wasnt so cream cheesey tasting I would substitute with more butter, I agreed. These were amazing!!

These are excellent cinabuns and I will never buy the frozen ones again!  I use my zojirushi bread machine which I love and they come out perfect.  I spray the pan with nonstick coating and never had an issue of them sticking.  I also melted the butter by accident one time and found that the filling didn't roll out of them when they were cooked like they did before.  My kids LOVE them so I freeze the uncooked ones in a ziplock bag and cook them when they want them.  
 
I make extra icing as one user already mentioned and used her measurements: the entire package of creamed cheese which is an 8 oz package of lowfat creamed cheese (2/3 c butter, 4 cups powdered sugar, 1-1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 tsp salt) and after I beat it well I drop spoonfuls on wax paper and freeze them.  Once frozen I wrap them individually in plastic wrap and into a ziplock and back into the freezer so when my kids want them I have everything ready!

OMG these are so good (eating one atm).  Have never made cinnamon rolls before and these turned out perfect.  I did double the filling because the "goop" is the best part, and used part light brown sugar and part dark brown sugar.  I don't have a bread machine, so I followed other suggestions for making them in my kitchen aid.  Super easy.  Rolled and cut them and put them in a glass baking dish in the fridge overnight.  Pulled them out in the morning 30 minutes before baking and baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  Whooooo!

These were absolutely the best and very forgiving. Like others I didn't have a bread machine or bread flour. Just proofed yeast for 10 minutes in 110 degree whole milk with 1 teas of sugar.  I followed recipe exactly except after mixing all the wet ingredients with the flour I guess I should have kneaded the dough but didn't, just allowed it to rise. Even without  the kneading dough easily doubled and they couldn't have been any better! The softest cinnamon rolls I've ever made. Will be making these again and often for overnight company.

As if this recipe needed another 5 star review lol I couldn't believe how well these turned out! Much easier than I thought it would be and impressed everyone I gave them to. I don't have a bread maker so I used others' suggestions on how to work with the dough by hand.  I recently bought a KA stand mixer and can't wait to make these again using the dough hook attachment. Will never buy cinnamon rolls again. Cinna-who?

Very good! No bread machine so proofed 2 1/2 tsp of active dry yeast in warm milk w/1 tsp sugar for 10 minutes, added the other wet ingredients then the bread flour. I use Pam instead of flour on my work surface, flour dusted rolls are yuck :) Let it rise 1 1/2 hours. Mixed the melted butter w/the cinnamon & sugar then spread it on the dough, left 1/2 inch at the end for the dough to seal together as another suggested. Rolled from the short side, cut it in half then cut those 2 pieces in half again (4 pieces now) then cut each of the 4 pieces into thirds, nice and uniform that way. Baked in lower 3rd of the oven at 350 for 23 minutes. Couple popped into cones LOL but pushed them back down w/a knife, think it's because the pan was so full they ran out of room! Will definitely make these again, thanks!!

I killed the yeast before the last step, so they were a pretty big flop. 5 stars because even though they were more cinnamon rocks than rolls they were delicious. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Agree, this is not a cinnibon, but still excellent. I used more butter and brown sugar in the filling. I also doubled the cream cheese and butter, but left the powder sugar. Plenty sweet.

Excellent and very tasty. Reminded me the buns we used to eat in Sweden growing up. I did add a teaspoon of ground cardemon to the dough which gave it that extra taste. Was a hit. Will definatly make again.

We follow the recipe except add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup raisins to the filling.
Gives them more flavor and makes them more interesting. We bake at 350 (for a couple extra minutes) instead of 400 degrees to ensure the filling is fully cooked before the rolls get too dark.
In order to keep from gaining 50 pounds we limit ourselves to making this recipe only once per month.

Yumm!  These were so good and such a hit with the fam!
One note: make sure to make these in a 9x12 brownie pan so they stay together and moist.  Remove from pan and seperate right away otherwise you'll have the ugliest, but most delish cinn rolls ever :)

This was only my 3rd attempt at baking with yeast and with 1 hit and 1 miss, I was nervous … I didn't have to be! These came out perfect, even though I only had cake flour on hand instead of bread flour.
Thanks to ANDYTAMI for the by-hand directions. The only change I made was to slightly increase the frosting quantities (naughty naughty :)

Fantastic,  I didn't use a bread machine just mixed by hand and let rise an hour.  Mixed middle ingredients together then sprinkled on.  Didn't have the ingredients to make the icing so I used a cream cheese frosting.  Can't say enough about this recipe fantastic !!! Also I got 16 pieces not 12 and could of probably got more but didnt want to stray from the recipe the first time.  ENJOY!!!

Yum!!! After looking through countless cinnamon roll recipes, glad I tried this one. Didn't have bread flour so used all-purpose and used butter in place of the margarine. Also, the full cup of brown sugar seemed like too much so reduced it to 3/4. Don't have a bread machine so I made the dough in my mixer, let it rise for two hours, did the filling, let it rise for another hour and baked it. Didn't make any icing and still very, very good! Family raved. Time consuming but worth the effort. :)

I have made this recipe many times. It is the best clone recipe I own. I don't use my bread machine for anything else. You can reheat slightly and add frosting if you need to take them out. A must for everyone!

I love this recipe and so did everyone else, from family to friends. They keep asking when I will be making more of these.  I made these using the exact recipe and they were yummy....actually more than yummy.

Great recipe, I didn't get to try the icing because I didn't have cream cheese - can't wait to try it next time though!  For some reason my dough wasn't rising properly, but i'm sure it had something to do with me;)  Next time I may cut down on the sugar, was a bit of an overload for me.  And I only needed half of the icing amount.  Thanks!!!

Delicious recipe. I doubled the frosting recipe as there was not nearly enough for the batch. I followed the recipe exactly but it made 20 instead of 12 as it said. I liked having more smaller ones anyhow. We had some leftover and I sliced them in  half and used it for french toast the next day...very delicious too!

These are fantastic. I've made them several times and they are always a big hit with my friends and family. There is only two things I do differently. I proof my yeast in water (so a reduce my milk by a bit) since it doesn't like to proof in milk for me. I also bake them on a larger baking sheet to they don't stick together and they come out all round and perfect. Other than that, I think this recipe is just wonderful.

I've got 2 more recipes I do all the time, but this is the one I will use from now on!  My only tip is to frost them IMMEDIATELY when they come out of the oven so all that goodness can soak down into the rolls and not just sit on top.  Very good recipe -loved the other user's tip about flour on top of the butter in the filling, and a few T added to the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture - definitely made a difference!

These are wonderfully cinnamony and delicious! Eat them still warm out of the oven and they are simply to die for! We made them twice in one week for different events and received many compliments and several recipe requests. 
Only one suggestion: The first time that we made these the oven temp. just seemed too high and they ended up a little drier than I would have like them (still good though). The second time we lowered the oven temp. to 350 for 15-20mins and they turned out perfect! 
This recipe is definitely a keeper in my book! Thank you!

Oh so excellent...  Follow BDBCOOK's frosting/freezing/refrigerating ideas.

I use a total of one stick of butter. A little over half goes in the dough (in place of margarine), a tablespoon or so is spread on the dough before the cinnamon, the rest goes in the frosting, and the wrapper is used to grease the pan.

Flip the pan when it comes out of the oven.

It helps to run the rolling pin over the cinnamon/brown sugar mix once it is sprinkled on.

These are AWESOME!  I made as written and they were superb.  I took the advice of other reviewers and put a cookie sheet on top and flipped them over for a bit while cooling so the filling would go back into the rolls.  Will make again!

Delicious, but I had trouble getting them to rise in the time that the recipe calls for.  Be prepared to wait or add a bit more yeast.

Dissolve an 8 g packet of dry active yeast in warm milk and 1/4 c sugar. Let it stand for 10 minutes,till yeast is foamy.Then add the remaining wet ingredients.In the end add the flour and mixed with the dough hooks of my beater till dough ball is formed .Heated oven 200F,and turned it off.Cover dough with moist kitchen towel over bowl.Put in oven for 1 hour.By then the dough will have doubled in volume.Then roll out the dough in rectangle shape.Spread butter,and then sprinkle brown sugar and cinammon mixture on top.Roll it,slice in 12 pieces and put in greased 9 x 13 in glass baking dish.Cover for 30 more minutes.Then bake in 350 F oven for 20-25 minutes,(Set pan on lower rack to bake-i read this but forgot it.will try itnext time and see the difference.)Also someone mentioned that right after taking it out of oven invert the pan so that the drippings recoat the buns.SInce I didnt have much drippings didnt do it. Thanks for this deliciously and easy recipe.

I have personally never had Cinnabon cinnamon rolls, but I can definitely tell you that this recipe is fantastic! I followed the suggestion in the ratings for making the rolls without a bread machine because I don't have one and they still turned out wonderfully, although mine took way longer to rise than what was suggested. If it doesn't look like they aren't going anywhere, just give it some time - it will work. Love these and absolutely will be making them again and again.

I am sure these would have turned out delicious had I not been drunk and measured the flour properly as they turned out too dry, but otherwise they look and smell amazing. Will definitely try again!

Well like everyone else, we thought these were fabulous. I accidentally mixed the sugar and the butter together and when I realized my mistake I ran to the recipe buzz to ask for help. Everyone said it was just fine as is and it certainly was. Thank you so much Marsha!

I don't know why I had problems with these, however, the dough was waaay too dry, so I had to add extra milk.  Everything else seemed to go well, however, they definitely need to bake a bit longer than 15 minutes.  I like my cinnamon rolls gooey but these were eating RAW dough, even though the outside was golden brown.  I might decrease the oven temperature next time and see if that works.  Aside from these flaws, the rolls were delicious (I ended up sticking them back in the oven) and definitely turn them upside down after taking them out of the oven, it makes the filling so ooey gooey delicious!

This is just the best ever!! It really does taste like a Cinnabon. I have made this twice already and I have found that preparing the dough the day before and letting it rise over night worked out the best. I do not have a bread machine but still used bread flour and yeast. I did use more brown sugar Cinnamon and butter the second time around and  did flip the pan after removal from the oven, very gooey!!! Unfortunately, I will only make these for the holidays and special occasions as this tasty treat is lethal to the waistline for all....LOL

AMAZING!! I do not have a bread machine (they have no soul!!) so I just let the yeast sit in the warm milk for about 15 minutes and then added the rest of the ingredients to my mixer. Also, I used all purpose flour and they were still chewy & delicious! I also put a little dash of cinnamon & nutmeg to the flour just to give a little kick. I made them the night before and let them go for a second rise in the fridge overnight. Baked for breakfast. The recipe is YUMMY!

I have made this a few times. A few things to note, always use bread flour, not all purpose flour. Bread flour has more gluten, which makes the dough more elastic, springy, and chewy. Which is good for breads, but not cakes or cookies. I always use butter and it turns out great every time. Those who say that margarine makes it lighter are wrong. The lightness of the bread depends on the type of flour used.

These are really good.  I have made them several times.  You can use one cup of whole wheat bread flour and the rest white bread flour.  You won't notice the difference.  The only recommendation I would make is to bake them for longer than 15 minutes.  They are too doughy for me and my family when only baked for 15 minutes.  I bake them for at least 25 minutes.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Made as directed, but didn't have quite enough powdered sugar. That worked out fine, actually, as not everyone wanted the icing on them.  I used one cup of brown sugar, but might use more in the future with a lot more cinnamom to get more gooey syrup. Turned the rolls upside down on a platter and then slathered icing on them. A perfect recipe. Will definitely make again.

These are diffucult for me to rate. The dough gets a 5 star. The frosting gets a 1 star and the filling gets 2-3 stars. First off, I do not like things that are very sweet so that affects my rating here. I think I would like them with no icing at all, or perhaps just a light glaze. Also, I would cut back on the brown sugar for the filling. I think that way, they would get a 5 star rating from me.For anyone who really likes sweet, these would be perfect.    I used my kitchen aid to make these, turned them upside down as soon as they came out of the oven and let them rise overnight in the frig. Put them in a cold oven in the morning. Turned the oven to 350 degrees and backed for about 35 minutes. This worked GREAT!!!! The dough is very tasty and so easy to work with. I just happen to not like really sweet rolls.

Made without a bread machine.  So easy and beyond delicious.  I baked mine about 3" apart on a greased cookie sheet and they turned out beautifully.  I lowered the temp by about 25 degrees since my oven tends to be hotter.  I checked them every few minutes towards the end to make sure they were not burning.  Nothing worse than overcooked burned rolls.  I'd rather have them slightly undercooked.  Once they were golden brown and I pulled them out, turned them onto a big cutting board and scrapped off the drippings back onto the rolls.  I let everyone ice their own.  I can't say enough on just how pretty these looked and how awesome they tasted.  Note on the freezing.  I froze a second batch AFTER I cut them each into individual rolls.  You also freeze them BEFORE the second rising.  Just pop them into a freezer bag right after cutting.  Set them out the night before you are ready to cook them.  I put the frozen ones in a round pan and covered with SaranWrap sprayed with oil.  I put them in the fridge about 12 hours before I cooked them.  That gave mine time to defrost and rise.  Hope this helps.

I have had this recipe saved for ages, and I finally made the time to prepare it.  As a chef, I don't keep or use a bread machine, so I used my stand mixer and dough hook to prepare the dough.    4 3/4 cups of strong baking flour (Lehi Mills/Turkey Brand), 1/3 cup melted butter, and 2.5 tsp. active dry yeast were the only changes I made.  For the frosting, I used 8 oz. cream cheese and 8 oz. softened butter, plus vanilla and confectioner's sugar.  It achieves a more Cinnabon-like consistency with the added butter, though I prefer this preparation even to Cinnabon's.  A great recipe, with some patience for the rising time.  My husband declared them the best cinnamon rolls "known to man."

These are perfect! If you're making them ahead of time, I flash froze the unbaked rolls individually on a cookie sheet. Then when my family wants cinnamon rolls, I just put however many we need into a greased baking pan, cover with greased plastic wrap and leave out on the counter overnight. Come morning, the deliciously plump rolls are ready to be baked per the directions. The frosting also freezes nicely too. I double the frosting and then seperate into 2 ziplocs. To make frosting the finished rolls easy, simply snip off a corner of the ziploc bag and squeeze the frosting out. Simple and no mess!

If you want to cheat and make this REALLY easy, use the frozen bread dough from your grocer. just let it thaw according to package directions and continue with the recipe as written. no need to make your own dough and every bit as good.

I made a half-batch, and baked them for 20 min.  If I make these again, I'll only bake for 15 min and roll them thinner-maybe 3 mm thick?

These are insanely good...Oh my!  My husband and I finished the pan in three days.  My only issue was that I cooked the temp the recipe called for - so the outside was too done and the inside was raw.  Next time I will cook it at the 350.  Fabulous!!!

Awesome! This is my first time working with bread dough - never even made a loaf of bread before and it was so easy - everything turned out perfectly. I don't have a bread machine, so I followed one reviewer's suggestion of dissolving a packet of dry active yeast in the warm milk, then adding the other ingredients, kneading by hand, and letting rise in an oven that was heated to 200, then turned off before putting the ball of dough in. Covered it with a moist paper towel and waited for it to double in size, about an hour. I started baking them at 400 and after 10 minutes they were getting too dark and the middles seemed to be doughy still, so reduced heat to 350 and covered them with foil, baked another 5 minutes. Next time I will bake them at 350 for 20 minutes. I doubled the icing as suggested by some reviewers, but had half left, so won't do that again. Great recipe!

I made the dough in the bread machine per the recipe directions; it made a dough that was fantastic to work with.  I formed the rolls and placed them in the 9x13, covered them with plastic wrap, then refrigerated them until the next day.  In the morning, I took the rolls out of the fridge and placed them in a warm spot to rise while I did my morning exercise.  An hour later, the rolls were ready to bake.    I delivered them to my husband's workplace where they received rave reviews.  They were fabulous!

Very tasty and I didn't mess them up. The only change I made to the recipe was to add half the flour in whole wheat. I followed the advice about mixing the butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon and had no problem with it running out.  I also lined the bottom with parchment paper.  I cooked them at 350 for 30-35 minutes. They came out great no goo in the middle, which is what I was worried about. Also, I doubled the frosting as some have suggested, but for me it was a bit much and I love frosting, so next time I will just make what the recipe calls for.  Overall, I love this and can't wait to make it again.

These were sinfully delicious! I did not use a bread machine, but combined all of the ingredients (note: only 2 cups of the flour) into a bowl and used my hand mixer on low for 1 minute, then on medium for 1 additional minute.  I then added an additional 2 cups of flour and mixed it by hand. I then turned it out onto a well foured surface and kneaded for 5 minutes. I let the dough raise, covered with plastic wrap, for 1 hour and 15 minutes on top of my oven, which I heated to 250 degrees. I then followed the recipe, until it came time to bake. I baked them at 375 degrees for 22 minutes.This was perfect. I ate 3 of them myself and got a horrible, gluttonous stomach ache!

I have read so many reviews about what to do about the ingredients that fall out of the roll and end up in the bottom of the pan. And the one with the best answer( most helpful ) is still short as to what should be done about it.      When I make this recipe I NEVER have this problem and I believe its because when I rolls up the dough I roll it tight at least 7 turns per log of dough. After baking , there is no ingredients in the bottom of the pan, Its Still In the Roll. I hope this helps Ray

Excellent recipe.  Duplicates the Cinnabon very well.  I made a half batch and found that it was more than enough.  I increased the amount of powdered sugar in the icing because I thought it tasted a little too much like the cream cheese.  If you are making a full batch, I recommend increasing it from 1.5 to 2 cups, though doubling the entire frosting recipe is not a bad idea (in which case you'd up sugar from 3 to 4 cups).  You definitely don't need a bread maker - just mix up the dough ingredients and knead for 5 mins.  Let it rise an hour in a warmed oven and you're set.  I made smaller rolls, and 18 mins at 350 was perfect.  Some say this recipe is not like a *true* cinnabon.  And they're right.  If you want to make it a "true" cinnabon, double or triple the filling ingredients, especially the butter, and pour some butter on top.  In fact, just take a stick of butter and eat it straight.  Or better yet, melt the butter and set up a butter IV to save yourself the time.  Overall, a great recipe.

These were excellent, very light and fluffy.  I have used a recipe that calls for pudding mix but like this one much better.  My daughter made them for a church group and came home with an empty pan.  We used Indonesian cinnamon when we made ours.  This is the same recipe that Todd Wilber has on his web site "Top Secret Recipes" and the reviews there are all good.

I have been making these for over a year now. And for the first time since then I picked up a Cinnabon while at the mall last week. The Cinnabon tasted like plastic compared to these even the cream cheese frosting. I'm actually not sure how I ever thought the Cinnabons were tasty. This recipe should be called Better than a Cinnabon! They are so easy to make the bread machine really cuts down on time. The only change I make is to add a little more brown sugar and cinnamon. Also make sure you use high quality cinnamon it makes a big difference.

YUM!!! These are money makers baby! I brought them to work and got rave reviews. I made the cinnamon rolls the night before and also the frosting and pulled them both out of the fridge 1/2 hr before baking. I found that putting the rolls in the fridge the night before helped the butter harden in the rolls and when I cooked them I had no problem with the cinnamon/brown sugar filling running out the bottom. They were perfect and oh so gooey. I also didn't use a bread maker. Easily done without, just look at other reviews. I also didn't put the frosting on until they were just warm to the touch, but the pan was still hot. That way most of the frosting stayed right on the cinnamon rolls and didn't melt off the sides. I also doubled the frosting, you have to! These are just as good heated up in the microwave the next day.

Wow, Wow, Wow...I can now see why this recipe is rated so highly....I wish I could give it more stars!!!  I used my KitchenAid mixer to make the dough, it turned out perfectly.  I also took some other reviewers advice and mixed the butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon together and then spread it all over the rolled out dough.  I was always afraid to try this recipe, but so glad I did....they turned out picture perfect.  I did lower my oven temp to 350 on convection bake.

Delicious!  My tweaks:  I like the taste of whole wheat flour so I subbed two cups of whole wheat for two cups of the white flour.  I also sprinkled a big handful of chopped toasted pecans over the sugar/butter mix on the dough before rolling it up and slicing it.
Someone else posted about tipping the buns out of the pan right after baking to get the syrup that flows out to go back into the buns and it works really well. The buns were so much moister.  I iced the bottom of the buns and the syrupy stuff melted into the frosting which was so amazing.

simply amazing!
one thing i would suggest is when rolling up the dough, roll it really tight and then seal the edge with some water...that way it doesn't come apart when you're trying to cut the individual buns. mine were a little loose when going into the oven but they still came out tasty!

This recipe is sheer perfection.  The dough is light and perfect in texture.  I use king arthur's cinnamon filling along with a layer of butter on dough. The frosting is yummy. That is my only change.  This is the only cinnamon bun recipe I will ever use.  It doesn't get any better than this.

The cinnamon rolls were good however not 5 star. I have never had a cinnabon, so I cannot honestly compare it to that.  I did roll out the dough thinner to make smaller rolls, as well as more rolls.  They were good, and I might make again if I can't find another cinnamon roll recipe, however I will keep on looking.
  Once again, they were good, but not excellent.

Excellent, absolutely delicious recipe!  I followed a reviewer's advice about increasing the amount of cream cheese to 8 oz., and it was perfect.  The second time I made these rolls, I reduced the frosting's sugar to just one cup.  Also, I decided to add about a tablespoon of vanilla to the wet ingredients of the dough.  This is definitely a family favorite and shall be made on a regular basis.  In 2009 I started using Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese, which made the frosting easier to spread; and my family seemed to like it better.

These are great and easy! I pull out the bread machine and keep making batches the whole day, stocking my freezer with rolls to keep my kids happy.  Place in a tin or 10 in a ziplock gallon bag to place in pan when ready to cook. Bakes best in glass pan. I like to bake at 375, and if frozen, I put them in as the oven is preheating to help them rise more. Cooking time can be a fine line, too little is doughy in center but once browned they can get pretty crispy around the egdes. Also, I just use butter cause I never buy margarine, put it in my quisinart cut into pats, throw in the cinn. and b. sugar, pulse to blend. Then crumble and spread around on the rolls before rolling. I found that sprinkling the filling on the butter, alot of it falls out when cutting the rolls apart.

Whoever said to invert after baking - thanks for nothing. Turned otherwise maybe great rolls into a soggy gooey mess. Impossible to eat after icing. Such an awful tasting sloppy mess has scared me away from trying again.

These rolls were awesome!  I didn't use a bread machine, Just made the dough by hand added about 2 tsp extra white sugar and kneeded it until smooth and then placed it in a large oiled boil.  I put the dough in the fridge and let it slowly rise overnight.  I took the dough out,  punched it down, let it rise again for about 2 hours.  I rolled out the dough, filledit, cut and again let the rolls rise.   I threw a bunch of pecans in the bottom of my pan becuase I like to eat them afte the rolls have been baked on top of them.

These were just cinnamon rolls.. good rolls but not Cinnabon clones.  I will continue to use Cinnamon Rolls III without the pecans.

I have made these three times now and each time they seem to get better. I have picked out my favorite alterations from the multitude of comments and this is what I came up with: 
I make them by hand, not a bread machine (dont have one). They never seem to double in size for me at first, but the second rise always helps. I have baked them in both a glass 9x12 dish, and cookie sheet, both work fine but I like the cookie sheet more just because they seem like they just keep growing! I usually have a few more than 12, more like 14 or so. I keep the ingrediants the same, but I mix the filling ingrediants together to make a paste so I can spread it easily. Also, when making the icing, I use melted butter and then heat it all up in the microwave for about 30 seconds before putting it on the rolls. It helps spread it out a little more. I also add a few drops of lemon juice to the icing (like 6-8 drops) just because I like the flavor. Lastly, if I am having chocolate cravings, I will add some semi-sweet choc chips on half of the filling, which melts in the oven and its sooooo good. But rich, so only try if you are a true chocoholic.  I am trying it overnight for the first time today, so I hope they come out as delicious as always!

Very very good. I made these Saturday night and baked them Sunday morning. I let them rise for an hour and then spread them & rolled them. They seemed small in the pan - there was at least an inch between rolls. By Sunday there was very little space between them, and they baked beautifully. There was too much frosting for me, but the frosting was great.  I could see making these for a holiday morning...

These hardly need another glowing review but wanted to pass on that, since there are only two of us (and one of us is on a diet.. ahem!), I halved the recipe and it worked wonderfully. I'd never made cinnamon buns before - always assumed it'd be difficult - but these were really easy and turned out perfectly. Might make the full recipe next time and try to freeze half after they're rolled but before they rise. The only change I made was to use a simple vanilla/icing sugar glaze instead of the cream cheese icing, as Hubby doesn't like cream cheese.

These things are sinfully good! Incredibly how much they expand (I left them out overnight which was so much easier in the am to just pop them in the oven and mix up the icing) and will definitely make them again. Quite simple overall and definitely worth the effort. I might try a few raisins and walnuts in the rolls next time too!

What to add...I made this for my sister's family Sunday morning and they were a hit.  Fairly easy to prepare,  the 200 degree preheat, turn off the oven and let the buns rise for about 40 minutes is a good method, especially since I refrigerated them overnight and did the second rise and baking the next morning.   I did double the icing recipe as someone else had suggested...good call... and the amount of cinnamon is not a mistake.  Two and a half tablespoons makes it a cinnabon. Also I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and they were just cooked through.  FYI, I did not melt the butter for the dough as I thought hot butter would compromise the yeast.  Good recipe, thanks for sharing.  Update: I made these with 1/2 tsp orange peel in the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture and used 2 1/2 tbsp. orange juice concentrate in the icing mix instead of vanilla.  Wonderful!! I had an idea I might try...I love maple bars and I bet you could make the dough in that shape (omitting the cinnamon and brown sugar...or not)and using mapleine flavoring in the icing mixture.  FYI..I like the dough better if done by hand.  The bread machine method, at least my bread machine, seems to make the dough a little more dense than the hand kneading method. But I love this recipe either way.

Decadent and oh so sinful.  So good.  I couldn't quite get them to rise after rolling them out, so I preheated my oven to 200 degress, shut it off, and then put the rolls in the oven with a towel over them while the oven cooled down.  It worked perfectly and they rose beautifully.  I also used just regular flour because I didn't have bread flour and they turned out just fine.  I'll definitely be making these again and again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!  ONE LAST THING.....  Since there's no way we could eat these at once, I made the icing and save it in a plastic container and then we heated the rolls as we ate them and then spread the icing on after we heated each.  So good!  UPDATE!!!!  Just made these again.  Heavenly.  Turned out perfect again.  Letting them rise in a semi warm (definitely not hot) is definitely the way to go.

Amazing! I just finished making these and my house is filled with their amazing aroma! They are fantastic! I did bake them at the lower temp and used a non cream cheese frosting because I didn't have any. It's really simple just 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 Tablespoon melted butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2-4 Tablespoons milk depending on the consistancy you prefer. Will make again (and agian)

I don't make cinnamon rolls because I have never found any that turn out very good.  I LOVED THESE! I don't have a bread machine so I combined all the ingredients (flour last) and mixed.  It was SO doughy and sticky but I managed to get it under control while kneading it with floured surface and hands. They rose great but I should have oiled the bowl for easier removal.  I also made these the night before, my daughter wanted them for her birthday breakfast.  I just put them all in a wax paper lined pan and put it in the fridge overnight.  Then I took them out in the morning and did the 200 degree - turned off oven and let them rise for about an hour.  They filled the pan and then I baked them for about 15 min at 350.  They were done in the middle and barely golden on top!  Perfect! Now the girls want them for Christmas morning! Thanks!

Excellent! I too did not use a bread machine and they still turned out beautifully! One change I made (which also did not change the consistency or flavour) was I used 2 1/2 cups unbleached flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour. Also omitted the icing due to personal preference... Healthier option yet still great!

Whenever I make these, they're gone the next day!! Everyone loves them & ask me to make more when they're gone. Definitely easy to make without a bread machine. I usually prep the dough the day before and roll it into the buns and put them in their cooking dishes. I put these in the fridge and take them out in the morning, cover with a cloth, and let them double & get to somewhat room temp before baking. To me, they're too sweet to have in the morning, so I have them ready by early afternoon.

Hands down one of the best recipes on this site. SO DELICIOUS!  One alteration (especially for those who found the rolls not gooey enough): I found doubling the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture made them extra gooey coming out of the oven.

I have made this several times now. I have also made the dough and then divided it into 2, rolled it out and added cinimmon and raisins to one and garlic and butter to the other. Then rolled then up and placed each one whole in a loaf pan. It made 2 loaves of the best bread. This dough is the one I us all of the time now.

Definitely better than Cinnabon!!  Even my picky kids agreed.  Just up from the table where each of us ate 2 of these in one sitting - ouch. I even healthed these up a bit with 3/4 whole wheat flour, reduced butter in the dough and added flaxseed meal.  I did not have cream cheese so used the sugar, vanilla, butter, maple extract from another site for the frosting. These were the best - one other tip use 1 TB flour in with the sugar/cinnamon mixture to keep the sugar mix from disappearing. UPDATE:  I've been making these for years now - following the recipe exactly and with small variations as above can't go wrong.  They are best when following the recipe exactly including using margarine and bread flour - small but important ingredients for the best possible result.

Made these two times this week. Both times I made my husband take them to his office for all the employees to eat. If they stayed home I would be sick from eating them all. 
Only change I made was, first try I baked 350 for 25 minutes. Way too long in my oven. Second time, 20 minutes at 350. Much better. Cinnabon's are very gooy, and my second batch was perfect.

Is there really anything to add to what's already been said?  These are super delicious!  These would have been gone within minutes if I didn't take half out after they cooled a few minutes, so I could freeze them for another time.  What was left was gone almost instantly.  These freeze great and I almost prefer them frozen and then heated in the microwave than fresh out of the oven.  Don't know why, but they tasted better that way.  I freeze them individually on wax paper in my freezer and once they are frozen, I put them in a freezer bag and pop them in the oven when someone wants one.  I've also made these for family and friends and I always get asked for the recipe!  Huge hit!  Oh yes, I also don't make these with a bread machine, but by hand.  Thanks so much for the excellent recipe!

Great!!! It takes a lot of time and attention once the bread machine is done, but it is way worth it. Also, the instruction that says to wait until the bread has doubled in size is confusing. The bread machine does it automatically on the dough cycle so skip that part.

I got a bread machine at a garage sale and decided to try this out as my first recipe. I had never baked any kind of bread from scratch before, and this recipe came out absolutely perfect. I feel like they needed to have a little more filling, which is why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 (next time I'll double the filling and it should be perfect) I followed other reviewers advice and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and they were cooked perfectly throughout. I did double the icing recipe because I like a lot of frosting on my cinnamon rolls. I used 8oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup sweetened, unsalted real butter, 3 cups powdered sugar, 1.5tsp vanilla, and 1/4 tsp salt - it was honestly the best cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted - I can't wait to try it on cakes and cupcakes as well! I will definitely make these cinnamon rolls again. They're not quite as gooey as a Cinnabon, but they're still absolutely delicious!

By far the best cinnamon rolls ever! I added 1/2 cup of corn syrup to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture as someone else suggested and they turned out perfect! I baked them for 14 minutes since they were starting to brown already and I didn't want them crispy.

My dad grew up on cinnabon and cindy's cinnamon buns.  When I made these for him he almost died.  I've probably made this recipe 30+ times over the last few years.  We have our own cream cheese frosting recipe that we use, but that's because he likes them super sweet.  This is a fantastic recipe that I will continue to make

I took the advice of another reviewer, and mixed the butter with the cinnamon and sugar. It worked perfectly. Another trick I learned a while ago, is to mix a small amount of flour into the mixture as well. No more than a tablespoon is enough. It turns the cinnamon and sugar into almost a sauce inside. Also I do not have a bread machine either, so I did this by hand. The result was perfect. A great tasting cinnamon roll. One other thing, do NOT change the amount of cinnamon in this recipe, it is perfect as is. I have always found that a majority of cinnamon roll recipes do not have enough!

This was divine and I don't even like cinnamon! I didn't have bread flour but the texture was still wonderful. I used my KitchenAid stand mixer with dough hook and regular yeast-worked very well. Made twelve GIANT rolls. The dough seemed sticky after kneading but after it rose, it was perfect-rolled out with no problems and was super easy to work with. Will make these again!

Wow. These were good.
I didn't have a bread machiene so I did it by hand. I was so happy the yeast was okay...
Anyways-I accidentally added the butter and cinnamon into the dough...and they were still good.=D So, that's how good they are!

I found that it is best to remove them right away or they get stuck to the pan. (And my super-buttery ones crumbled.=() Add the frosting right away too, if you want it to melt good. 
These were good!

I realize the last thing this recipe needs is yet another review, but did anyone else find them a bit doughy? Other than that, the taste was incredible. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm a Family and Consumer Science teacher (Home Economics) and this is the one sugary recipe I have my students make.  I've made this with over 400 students and they have turned out wonderful every time.  I had to make some adjustments because of 40 minute periods, but I now have it down to a science.  I bake the rolls at 350 for 25 minutes because at a higher temperature  I find they are done on the outside, raw in the middle.  Everyone loves this recipe and it makes my classroom smell amazing.

OMG!  These are the best cinnamon rolls ever!  My whole family loves them and requests them often.  A lot of the time, I make the dough the night before and out in a ziploc in the fridge over night; allows it to rise quite a bit, makes them huge and fluffy!  HINT:  For a shorter 'dough cycle,' stop the cycle after 10 minutes of kneading (mine machine beeps at that time) and then let rise.  They turn out perfect and the dough cycle is like 15 min instead of 1 1/2 hours!

These were awesome and I will definitely make them again. I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the directions stating to cook them at 400 for 15 minutes-this resulted in the rolls being cooked on the tops, but the middle being completely doughy and not cooked at all. This will be a 5 star recipe for me the next time I make them and bake them at 325 or 350 so they'll cook evenly.

I have made these mulitple times now and it's so easy... just takes some time. We love to put butterscotch or carmel sauce over the top before the frosting, and it makes them gooey and more flavorful! It's definately a keeper!

Excellent!  I cooked them in a 9x13 pan for the length suggested, and the middle ones weren't cooked through.  But they were all delectable!!

These are fantastic!  I've made them several times over the past few months--more cinnamon rolls than I've made in my whole life!!  I've made them with and without dough conditioner and there doesn't appear to be much difference.  I've also made them with Splenda in the dough and have only made them with Splenda Brown sugar and they taste GREAT!  Do be sure to let the dough rest for the 10 minutes or you have a fight on your hands (maybe even a little longer after you start to roll the dough).  My kids absolutely love these rolls!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!  Much better than the original IMHO.  The only "glitch" I had was that it took more than an hour for these to rise properly, so in the future I'll be able to plan more appropriately.

Also, I've read some of the reviews where folks had difficulty rolling out the dough.  I used a 20" french style straight rolling pin and rolled a couple of times vertically, a couple of times horizontally, pulled the corners by hand to form a rectangle and then repeated until I got to the desired size.  It was a snap, but I do believe that if I had used the common short two handled rolling pin, I'd still be rolling out the dough!

These were really good, but I expected them to be A LOT better per reviews. They are best when very warm. A few steps up from the pre-made, but not quite as yummy as the ones from the mall, IMO. That said, I did slice the rolls to make 24, not 12, so, maybe that made a difference?

Out of this world delicious.  The real test came when we couldn't eat all of the rolls.  I put the leftovers in the fridge, and over the next three days my family finished off the cinnamon rolls.  We warmed them in the oven and they were just as good as the first day.  This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was tricky because I wanted it for Christmas morning, so I followed the suggestions of others and made them and put them in the fridge overnight.  They were not as soft and did not rise as much as I would have liked. I will follow the original directions next time...

When you overhear your teenage sons tell their friends, "Mom makes THE BEST cinnamon rolls," you know you have a winner.  Tried starting them the night before and baking them off in the next morning.  Really, it's best to do it all at once for high rising, light rolls.  Make sure you roll the cinnamon mixture into the dough.  I watched the actual Cinnabon movie about it.  It keeps the filling from sinking to the bottom of the pan!

Simple & Delicious!  Great texture.  The bread machine does all the work for you.  I made the dough in the bread machine, rolled out & filled, cut and placed in pan.  Put in refrigerator until ready to bake.  While oven was preheating I placed pan on top of stove for rolls to rise and baked until golden.  Turned out perfectly. Definitely a keeper.

Just like cinnabon!
I didn't end up using all the brown sugar mixture because it just seemed like a lot.  The first time i made them i used the recipe for cream cheese icing, but the second time i just used a can of store bought...my family actually preferred the second batch!

I can't believe these came from my oven. With the bread machine doing the work with the dough, these were even better than Cinnabons. I served them Christmas morning and they were a smash hit.

This was the second time I made these.. they are the best... I did use a glass pan for the rolls.. I have a new gas range (used electric the first time)and the time cooked probably should have been 20 min. vs. 15 min. with electric.
Kinda doughey in middle.. but still the best rolls ever!!

AMAZING!  I was able to make 15 cinnamon rolls and all but 3 were eaten the morning I cooked them.  I prepared the dough the night before to save myself from waking up an hour before I needed to and then made the rolls (very easy to do) the next morning.  I was told I should change my major and become a chef!  Great recipe and very easy to do.  Will definitely do again soon!

I have made a thousand batches of my own Cinnabon clone recipe over the years but this one far exceeds anything I've made in the past.  I doubled the amount of cinnamon the recipe called for and it was perfect!!!!  Using a bread machine makes this so easy you could do it every day!  Try it, you will make your family very happy!

Great recipe. Made the dough the night before and then did the rest Christmas morning. Took to a family brunch and it  was a huge hit! Will add nuts next time! Too "bad" for us to make all the time, but great for special occasions!

Used a bread machine. Used directed amounts of butter, brown sugar and cinnamon (use less if you don't want to taste the cinnamon so clearly). Doubled cream cheese topping (just the right amount. Maybe that's why they didn't seem dry.) Also removed from pan immediately by flipping pan so juices stayed on buns. I even did the make the dough one day, put in fridge overnight, and cook the next morning. RAVE reviews. Very doughy recipe. It's a fork-and-knife kind of cinnamon roll. BIG servings. Roll tightly or they're HUGE.

i thought these cinnamon buns were delicious, even though i over-baked them (they turned out kind of dry).  the icing was soooo good.  does anyone have any suggestions (other than baking for less amount of time) as to how to get these rolls more moist?  thanks.

These are wonderful!  Always rave reviews.  I like to roll out dough as in recipe then cut it in two lengthwise.  That way it makes about 24 nice dinner size rolls.

My 12 year old son doesn't often rave about new recipes, but declared these "the best cinnamon rolls ever".  I haven't often been pleased with homemade cinnamon roll recipes, but this one is not only fabulous but very easy!

I've made these rolls four times now and everyone I shared them with just loves them.  I've actually been asked how much I wanted for the rest of a batch!  One of my favorite recipes.

Super easy in a bread Machine. I didn't like the cream cheese frosting the first time I made them, so this time I used Dunken Hines Cream Cheese frosting in the can. Tastes just like Cinnabon from the mall. This is by far the best!

These rolls are wonderful!  The frosting is SO good.  I make these all the time now.  I love how easy it is when the bread machine does all the work.  I've never had a Cinnabon to compare them to, but I can't imagine theirs are much better.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

These cinnamon rolls were amazing! I don't have a bread maker so I did it all by hand. I have never made bread before so with a little help from cookbooks and other reviews, I figured out how long to knead etc. I think my yeast was getting old because I never actually saw it activate in the milk. But the rolls were outstanding anyway. I delivered some to a few neighbors after I baked them and now everyone wants more. I will probably be making them again this weekend.

I made these almost exactly as the recipe specified (except I used 4 ounces cream cheese) and they turned out very well.  The leftovers were a big hit at the office.  However, next time I’m going to make one minor change.  I’m going to use a narrower dish and use two of them so I won’t have any middle rolls.   My outside rolls were perfect, but the middle rolls were underdone.  I’m not a baker, but I plan on impressing lots of people with these rolls.

Awesome! My first time making real cinnamon rolls. This bread machine recipe made it a pleasure and a breeze! My family loves them....the icing sends it over the top. Even the next day (cold and un-iced from the fridge) it's delicious. Place a heaping tablespoon of icing on the top of a roll and microwave the roll for about 30-45 seconds--piping hot and oogy gooey yummy! I know I'll be using this recipe for years! Thanks!

I used all purpose flour and a package of yeast - dumped everything but the flour in a stand mixer bowl and stirred, then with the flour and the dough hook let it run on meduim for about a minute.  These turned out not so much like Cinnabon, but exactly like the canned "Grands" cinnamon rolls.  We all loved them, thanks for the keeper!

This was so awsome. No more going to the mall for Cinnabon!
Edit: These were requested again & made this  w/ orange extract instead of the vanilla this time, in the icing. They lasted shorter than the previous batch.

I made this for my mom's birthday and she was REALLY pleased! I had to make a second batch because they were gone within an hour. I used regular FAST acting dry yeast in the machine and it worked just fine. I let it raise more then I was supposed to, and waited 30 minutes with the dough on the counter before I rolled it. When ready to roll, I set my oven to 200F and shut it off when it reached the correct temp. Then I left my rolls sitting in the oven (covered with a damp cloth) next to a bowl of water until they touched each other. Pulled them out, cranked it up to 400F for the actual baking time. Mine were ready in 12 minutes. I added an extra ounce of cream cheese for the second batch of icing. Yum! This is a keeper! Notes: place the “ends” at the bottom of the pan. Also, you can spread the icing almost immediately as it does not melt as much as the commercial stuff. The 9x13 dish would have been too small, I use one size bigger and sprayed it with butter flavored non-stick spray, and I had no problems removing the buns.

This is definitely a great recipe. Even being new to the baking world, they came out perfect. After reading some reviews, I decided to add more brown sugar and cinnamon since I like them gooey. I also made extra frosting but it still wasn't enough. Definitely double the amount of frosting. I didn't expect them to come out so big either. Thanks for making my first baking experience a great one. I'm sure my co-workers would thank you too if they could  =)

I have made these time and time again.  They are easy because the bread machine does most of the work.  They are delicious!  Sometimes I add nuts to the filling, and the easiest way to cut them is by using dental floss!

Wow, wow and WOW! These are amazing!!!! I used my mixer and not the bread machine since I made bread all of the time. I doubled the icing as suggested but it was WAY too much. Next time if I make extra Ill just do 1.5 times whats recommended. These are soooo unhealthy but perfect for special occasions - like Christmas Eve breakfast ;)  Thanks!

Oh and I baked them at 375 for 27 minutes and they were perfect! Yummmmm!

This is a great recipe!  I followed the recipe, except that I added about 1/3 cup of granulated sugar to the filling... honestly, it is almost too sweet for my husband and my tastes, but we are used to eating health-food :)  My first time, I didn't have any cream cheese, so I made an icing out of milk and confectioners sugar, but it really wasn't a great icing... I'm baking some right now and I'll use the recipe's icing.  Mine almost burned the first time, even though they still had 5 minutes to go, so watch them closely and taken them out when they are golden.  They're great re-heated in the mircowave!  Just be careful to not eat too many because they will cause a tummy ache... Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I also hate giving this another 5 star, but this is the best cinnamon roll recipe.  It even beats my mothers.  !?!?  I made the dough, rolled it out and let the rolls rise over night, then cooked them in the morning.  ::::::TIP:::::::  When cutting the cinnamon roll "log", use dental floss.  Slide the floss under the log, then 1-2 inches in, bring the floss ends up and over to cross each other, pinching the cinnamon roll off.  Does that make sense?  It make perfectly cut rolls!  (now THAT I learned from my mom!)

These are wonderful! I am very impressed. I didn't use a bread machine and it worked out just great. I also didn't have any cream cheese, so I used sour cream and a little extra XXX sugar for the frosting. My husband wants me to make these everyday!

OMG these are the best cinnamon rolls ever! They are so easy to make. I've only made cinnamon rolls once before and this recipe puts those to shame. The icing is so delicious and you'll want to lick the bowl. I did follow the suggestions of others and baked at 350 for 20-25 minutes. I would also recommend creaming soft butter and the brown sugar/cinnamon mixure before spreading on the dough. The melted butter tends to just drip out. But, these rolls are wonderful!!!

this recipe is awesome.  but since i hate using bread machines, i did it without.  i mix the eggs with the sugar with an electric mixer until pale, about 7 minutes. then i add the milk (which i let stand for 10 minutes with the yeast), melted margarine, and salt.  using a wooden spoon i stir in the flour gradually, until i can knead it, which i do for 10 minutes.  then i let it rest till doubled, and carry on with the recipe.  this is the best way to do it if you don't have, or don't want to use a bread machine. :)

These are the best cinnamon buns I have ever made. Even the icing is fabulous. Thank you.

Here is a tip for others using their bread machines: 
Before you add warm milk, warm eggs, and melted butter, make sure you check the directions of your bread machine. If you are using a rapid cycle then your machine will skip the warm up stage and it is important those ingredients are warm. If you use the regular cycle (mine takes 2 hours) your machine will go through a warm up stage so you should add COLD milk, and if you want to add cold eggs and firm cold butter that is ok too. The temperature of the liquids could make all the difference in the dough.

As close to a cinnabon as you could get. I think the real key in this recipe is to roll the dough out thin, to the full size recommended, 16X21. Use a ruler if you have to to be sure you get it large enough. That gives them that cinnabon-like quality. Also, use the full amount of cinnamon if you like cinnamon, it makes a big difference. Just great!!!

Terrific recipe.  I make these the evening prior in my food processor (process for 45 seconds).  I get them ready for baking and hold the buns overnight in the fridge to bake the next morning. Easy, easy.  To save time I microwave the milk, drop the butter in the warm milk to melt it and when this mixture cools to lukewarm, I drop in the eggs and pour the mixture thru the processor tube.    Also, I add the filling ingredients (softened butter, cinnamon, brown sugar and sometimes chopped pecans) by eye to save on clean up of measuring utensils...a bit more or less of any of the filling ingredients doesn't matter much.

I will add my EXCELLENT to the chorus of positive reviews.  I used all butter in the recipe, instead of margarine in the dough, and also used all purpose flour in place of the bread flour listed in the recipe.  Dough and finished buns turned out fantastic, so if you don't have bread flour in your cabinet--make these all the same for great results.  You can also mix all the ingredients in a standard mix master with a dough hook or paddle if you don't have a bread machine (as I don't).  Even the "dieters" and Atkins followers had to try at least a half of one.  Not difficult at all.  Will definately make for special Sundays and parties!

Absolutely delicious!  To insure that the rolls didn't dry out on the outside, I used part of another cinnamon roll recipe to make a vanilla ice cream, brown sugar, and butter carmelized mixture; I poured that in the bottom of the pan first, then placed the cinnamon rolls on top of the mixture.  Ooey, gooey, and the most delicious cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten! Thanks Marsha!

YYUUMMYYYY!  These were really good.  I followed a few of the suggested changes.  I used less brown sugar, and used a lower temperature.  Even with the changes I think I could have baked them a little less.  I will make them again.  Doing everything the night before is a big time saver!

Easy foolproof recipe.  These tasted alot like cinnabons!  Cooking time needs to be adjusted accordingly.  Will make again.  Superb.

This recipe was relatively easy and fabulous! The icing was WONDERFUL! Next time I will cook the rolls just a few minutes longer so the middles aren't so doughy, but otherwise a real winner!!

I had a problem making this right off the bat.  My yeast had expired a month ago and my bread machine doesn't have a 'dough setting'.  I called my 87 year old Grandma for advice.  She advised me to 'attempt' my yeast by withholding 1 cup of flour and mixing all of the dry ingredients together(including the yeast)...adding additional flour if necessary...and to do it all by hand.  Well, even with her advice, my dough never did rise the first time.  I called her back, she said not to panic...just roll the dough according to the directions.  But the second rising never occured either, once again my Grandma came to the rescue!  She simply explained to me that I am NOT making bread, just cinnamon rolls...she said that even though my yeast was old, it should at least, partially rise in the oven if I reduced the temp by 25 degrees and added 10 minutes to my cooking time. 

I served them to my husband and neighbors, they were 'out of this world' fantastic!  I've promised my Grandma that I will make another batch to overnight to her and my 90 year old Grandpa, THANKS for the recipe!!!!

definitely worth its name.  also, heed the other reviews and cook for longer (20-25 minutes) at lower temperature (350).  Other than that...mmmmmm!

I have a cinnabun loving family but we don't live near a mall. I was skeptical about this recipe despite the rave reviews. Boy, was I wrong! This recipe was just like the real thing. The dough was moist and the filling flavorful. 12 rolls were gone in about 20 minutes. Make sure you lower your rack to the one just below middle or the tops will brown too quickly. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe.

Fantastic recipe! I worked for Cinnzeo for a few months, and find these rolls pretty much exactly like theirs. 
The only difference is the frosting.  I changed the recipe by not adding salt (salt is only needed in the dough to activate the yeast), and in replace I added lemon extract. 
This gives those rolls that extra kick!

One thing I would suggest is, once the dough has been rolled out, to leave about an inch at the bottom without butter. 
This way it will stick when you roll down to that last piece.  If you butter the entire surface, it tends to have problems sticking. 

Thanks for the recipe!  It really is fantastic!! =)

These are wonderfull! Not difficult to make and they are YUMMY. Highly reccomend this recipe. I would like to know if these are okay to refigerate overnight before placing in the oven. They would be great to have for breakfast, but require a lot of time before. Hmmmmmmmm? Has anyone tried this?? I think I will.

These WERE great.  I did need to add 2 Tablespoons of milk because the dough was too dry in my machine.  Also, in the frosting, I used 3/4 t vanilla and 1/4t orange extract instead of just vanilla.  I also substituted 1/4 Cup of the bread flour with whole wheat flour.  Now they're nice and healthy for us! Ha!  But what a treat!

YUM!  I made these for my family during a recent snowstorm and they went very quickly!  I've also tried them using frozen sweet bread dough (found in the frozen section of grocery), and it works great that way, too - I took the dough out to thaw before going to bed.  Thanks!

I've made these numerous times and they turn out great. If the rolls are rolled tight the cinnamon/butter gooey insides will not be on the bottom of the pan. These are absolutely delicious.

Delicious!  Make these very often, mostly during the holiday season.  Or randomly for a special breakfast. Use other top reviews recommendations. Dont make with bread machine.  Leave in fridge overnight.  Punch the dough down two times for extra soft rolls.  Leave 1/4 inch margin around edges so dough sticks together better.  Reallly good rolls.  Gonna try a healthier modified version soon! haha.

These cinnamon buns are delicious.  My whole family loves them.  I love that I can make the dough in my bread machine and then do the rest myself.  I have followed other reviews and frozen the unbaked rolls in a foil pan to bake later.  I have also placed unbaked rolls in the fridge overnight to bake in the morning.  Both turned out awesome.  I have difficulty rolling up the dough so that the outside edges are equal to the rest, so I just took the cinnamon rolls from the edges, chopped them into 1-inch pieces and make cinnamon roll monkey bread! We ate it without icing but it would be good with warmed cream cheese icing for dipping.

15 minutes at 400 was not enough time.  They needed almost 45 minutes to bake.  Maybe I did something wrong.

I make this recipe just as described (sometimes with less frosting).  I set it up the night before and we have fresh cinnamon rolls for breakfast.  It is delicious and is now made for all special occasions at our house.  I dare you to eat just one!

These cinnamon rolls were amazing and they tasted just like cinnabon, if not better.  I've had my fair share of cinnabon rolls over the years, so for those who say that these were terrible or that they didn't taste like cinnabon--you did something wrong.  However, the frosting wasn't up to par so I experimented with ingredients to get closer to the cinnabon frosting.  Here is what I came up with.  1 (8 oz) package of cream cheese, 1/4 C butter softened, 2 C confectioners sugar, 2 Teaspoons vanilla extract, 1/2 Teaspoon fresh lemon juice.  In order to get it nice and fluffy I used an electric hand blender for about 12 minutes.  Lastly, as others have suggested, cooking at 350 for 20-25 min works best.

Follow the recipe as written. I write quite a few reviews, and I love reading the reviews of other cooks. Only one time (in years) have I mentioned that I was disappointed to follow another's advice. This will be the second time. Based on one review, I mixed the cinnamon-butter-sugar with my food processor ahead of time. I also added nuts. It sounded like a great, time-saving idea, but I ended up with clumps of a gritty mixture that did not want to smooth out across the dough. I ended up heating it in the microwave and then spreading/patting it on, but next time I'll follow the recipe -- just spread the softened butter over the dough, and THEN sprinkle on the cinnamon and sugar. The second piece of advice I followed that was a huge mistake is to invert the rolls onto a platter after removing them from the oven. Bad idea. Because the rolls do not rise to the same height, I had rolls of various sizes sort of teetering on the plate. (Even a half-inch in height can make a difference if inverted.) I slathered a bit of cream cheese frosting on the inverted rolls and then quickly turned them right side up. They don't look like pretty brown cinnamon rolls if inverted onto a plate. That said, I also added some raisins, and I made extra frosting but really didn't need to.  I'll save it for another use. Other than my own poor judgment, this is a wonderful recipe!

These are perfect! This would be what cinabon would taste like if homemade.  It doesn't have that sorta processed flavor.  It's really good.  I did reduce the sugar, I used about 2/3 the suggested amount and added about 1-2teaspoon of cornstarch to the sugar/cinnamon mix. This prevented the filling from seeping out. Will definitely make these again and again.

These cinnamon rolls are simply amazing!!! They have turned out every time I have made them, and I didn't change a thing, other than mixing the dough by hand. I would definitely recommend this recipe. :)Just make sure you make them large enough, so that they are more like a Cinnabon

I've been making these for over 10 years every Christmas and Easter. they're a family favorite! I used to make the dough in the bread machine and it came out great. Now I use my Kitchen Aid and they still come out great! I love the filling too. I always double the icing because everyone loves it so much. This recipe got me interested in making breads from scratch. Thank you!

You can also use frozen ready dough.  Set on counter and let it ride w a light towel over it but away from cold drafts.   I forgot to line the pan this time so we will see how sticky it gets

Loved them every time I have made them.  I use the refrigerator method and bake in the morning.  Also, as soon as you remove from the oven, flip the pan over.

never fail recipe.  I have messed up on not melting butter first.  I put brown sugar in and it still turned out perfect.  I left dough in bread machine long after it beeped, still turned out perfect.  I've added chopped pecans and raisins, still perfect.  AMAZING recipe!

AMAZING!!!! Make sure your bread proves before you bake it, or they will be flat! Still taste great flat though, I found out! haha But great recipe, even easier with a breadmaker, but I have made with and without a breadmaker.

I found this recipe today and decided to make these Cinnabon knockoff cinnamon rolls for my family this morning. I used all of the ingredients and followed the recipe exactly as written. When I took my dough out of the bread machine, it was a gummy, hard ball. It hadn't risen at all. They didn't rise in the oven. The filling was sickeningly sweet. 1,800 amazing reviews-- I'm not sure what I did wrong! They were nothing like Cinnabon's.

After receiving a Kitchenaid stand mixer as a gift from the hubby, I decided to play around with it.  This was the first recipe that I went for.  I have NEVER worked with any sort of yeast dough before, so I was nervous.  Even as a first-timer, these turned out amazing!  One item that I will mention is the need for more cinnamon filling. Some said that the recipe called for a bit too much cinnamon.  I would have to disagree.  I was going for the ooey gooey richness of the real thing so I could have probably doubled the cinnamon/brown sugar, and butter filling.  Additionally, instead of butter, I used margarine in stead for the cream cheese frosting.  It adds that bit of extra buttery saltiness that true Cinnabon icing has.

totally delicious.  The icing seems a bit stiff, but goes on easily and melts on the warm buns.  Thinner would not work.

Really delicious! I was worried there wouldn't be enough filling as I was assembling them but it turned out to be perfect after I baked it. I followed other users' advice and mixed the filling ingredients together and spread on the dough. I upped the butter a little to get it to mix properly but probably wouldn't again - it took some of that great chewiness out of the filling. I also turned the whole pan upside down when they came out of the oven so the drippings coated the buns and it was soooo much better. The frosting was tasty but there was a bit too much of it - I'd cut it in half next time. Will make again for sure!

Holy cannoli, this is a great recipe. I don't have a bread machine (and have never made bread before from scratch - AKA no experience with yeast, rising, etc.) but ANDYTAMI and mcatherwood's reviews were super helpful. Apart from their workaround for us folks who don't own a bread machine (and making a *tiny* bit of extra icing), I followed the recipe to a T. These cinnamon rolls came out perfect. So perfect in fact that I won an informal bakeoff at work with them! The only downside is that they disappeared so fast that I barely got to enjoy the fruits of my labor! Will be making this one again for SURE.

Oh my! I thought that the first time I made these it was a fluke, as I'd never made any baked product so delicious. My second time, they were just as amazing. Family and friends are in love. We are all going to need a weight loss program.

So this is my 3rd or 4th time making this recipe. I actually just joined Allrecipes just to write this review. After reading various ways to make Cinnamon Rolls, I've finally mastered it. When I made this before it's always been dry, never "gooey" like Cinnabon. This was the first time making it with a bread machine as well (although the dough hasn't changed from before). When rolling out your dough into a rectangle, brush milk all over the dough before putting the cinnamon/sugar mixture on. Semi-melt the butter in the microwave and mix it together with the sugar and cinnamon. I've always sprinkled the sugar/cinnamon over the butter but that is going to make it dry! Spread the butter/sugar mixture over the dough. After rolling, brush milk along the seams to keep them together! Now you will have a clone of a Cinnabon!!

Made one big mistake... When you bake them have them touch together in the baking dish. We had them separated so they flattened instead of rising. Other than that it was delicious

I've tried a few different versions of this recipe..and this one is the best!! Tastes almost exactly like cinnabon rolls! The on difference is..I added a little bit of maple syrup to the icing..and it made it even better :)

My first attempt was great...only tweak would be to mix the butter/cinnamon/sugar filling together beforehand and use 1 1/2x the amount. The amount listed was good, but I think a little more would elevate the recipe.

First attempt in probably 15 years of using yeast in a recipe (I don't have a machine, so by hand) and I was very impressed.

I love these cinnamon rolls!  Very easy to make and so tasty.  I made them for my son's birthday sleepover and all the boys devoured them.  I just made them again to freeze for our Easter brunch.  The first time I froze after baking, thawed, warmed in oven and added frosting/icing. I only changed one thing - I used butter rather than margarine in the first step to make the dough. After I rolled the dough up I stretched it a bit before cutting to help lenghen the middle out. The middle would turn out thicker for me and I wouldn't get even rolls once I got towards the ends.  I will be keeping this recipe!  Thanks!

We were blown away by these delicious cinnamon rolls! My search is over for a great recipe. I followed this recipe exactly for the dough, which baked up gorgeous, light, tender, moist and flavorful. I think using the bread flour is important as others have said as well. I tweaked the filling a bit, more butter, less brown sugar and less cinnamon, and I added plenty of finely chopped pecans. I frost as soon as they come out of the oven. I have tried baking them after being refrigerated overnight, and after being frozen as well, and they are perfect both ways. They seemed to have a chance to raise a bit more with the following process--Place rolls from the refrigerator into a cold oven, and set oven temp on warm or lowest setting for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, reset oven temp to 350 degrees and bake till done, about 20 minutes for my oven. If the rolls are frozen, thaw in fridge overnight.

This is a great recipe- a little time consuming, but they came out very good. I was a little nervous about the amount of time it took and the fact that all other rolls I have attempted to make did not turn outand ended up in the trash. This recipe, while it takes a little while, is easy to follow. I almost took shortcuts but then went out and bought the bread flour instead of substituting. It was well worth the trip to the store in my pj's. Received many compliments on them. Will make a larger batch and give out on christmas eve as a gift for people to bake in the morning.
DON'T TAKE SHORTCUTS OR SUBSTITUTES and use QUALITY INGREDIENTS. It really does make all the difference. Definitely a keeper!

Oh, my Lord, these are so, so good!  The dough was so very easy to work with.  It was a breeze.  My grandsons and I put them together last night, popped in the fridge and baked off this morning.  We baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, and they're perfection.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!

I made these rolls a day ahead and after placing them in the pan, I refrigerated overnight and placed in a cold oven, turned the oven to 350 and baked for approx 30 mins.  Very good cinnamon rolls and very good icing!  Thanks Marsha Fernandez!

Awesome recipe! We baked it for dessert after dinner and it was a hit. We made these without the glaze and they were still very warm and delicious! We will bake these again with glaze for a family party. These are great buns. They will MELT IN YOUR MOUTH!!

These are super delicious, but I am having trouble getting them to bake all the way through.  They will appear done outside, and for the first couple layers, then they become completely doughy.
I have to over-bake them just to get them edible :(
Have tried using a glass 9x13, as suggested.  Also, I have tried splitting into two pans of 6 rolls, and two 8" square aluminum (disposable) pans; the results were terrible with the aluminum pans.  Next I am going to try two square baking dishes, but would REALLY appreciate any tips as to how to get these rolls to cook thoroughly and evenly.
I am following the bread machine method.
I love these, help!

I followed the recipe exactly and the rolls turned out delicious! I stored them in the fridge and they were just as good microwaved to warm. YUM!

The dough was so sticky! I could barely get it outt of the bread machine..but after baking they looked wonderful. The only reason its not 5 stars is because the icing was horrible

I made these a few weeks ago for my son's family, which includes 4 granddaughters!  They were a huge hit and my 4 princesses were able to help me make them.  I used a Kitchen Aid instead of my bread machine but I will take others advice from this site and add the yeast to the warm milk and sugar first.  I also used all purpose flour and they still turned out really well.  I am going to make them again tomorrow but will split the dough in two before rolling it out (8 x 12) and make 24 buns to take to an association meeting on Saturday morning.  I love the suggestion of letting them rest in the fridge overnight and popping them in the oven in the morning.  I will keep an eye on them to make sure they do not over-bake, but only 10-12 minutes in the oven should be good.

Excellent.  Not exactly Cinnabon,  but just as good.  I can't quite pinpoint what makes it not quite Cinnabon, but no matter.  I did not have the problem of the filling running out like some complained of.  I'm guessing they did not roll them tight enough.  Another reviewer said to turn the pan over when baked to let the filling run bake in.  This was not necessary for me.  I did combine the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon to spread all together as someone suggested.  Not sure if that made a difference or not.  That method was hard to spread evenly though, so next time I'm going to try it as the recipe says.  I took the advice of another reviewer who said to double the icing, but double is about twice too much.  Someone must have a major sweet tooth.  I think double icing would make me sick.  So I will make another batch in a few days to use up the other half of the icing.   I disagree with another reviewer who said the filling was too cinnamony.  It was fine.  The dough was pretty easy to make and came together really nicely.

Another 5 stars. This is a great recipe. I would double the frosting but then again I don't put all the sugar in it, so it's not as sweet, and that means I get less frosting out of the recipe. Many people mentioned a problem with the filling running out -- if you just let them sit til they're completely cool, the filling condenses and soaks back into the bottoms so you taste it in every bite anyway. You don't need to turn the pan over or anything, just be patient :) Thanks for sharing, to me these are better than Cinnamonster or Cinnabon.

this is soooooo the best cinnamon bun recipe ever! i have made it twice before, and i am making them again tomorrow. for these cinnamon buns to really taste like a cinnabon you have to double the cinnamon mixture. (i know, you are all prabably thinking that this recipe is already unhealthy enough, and there is plenty of sugar,so why add more?, well if you have had a cinnabon before you know the crazy amount of cinnamon they add to it, the cinnamon literly oozes out of the cinnamon bun.) I have also heard that if you add a packet of vanilla pudding mix to the dough it makes the bread part of the cinnamon bun taste exactly like a cinnabon.

these are amazing cinnamon rolls, they can be made the night before and refrigerated, just pop in the refrigerator before the final rise. let rise (this takes more than the 30 minutes due to rolls having to get to room temp before yeast can be fully active) and cook!

These cinnamon rolls were delicious right out of the oven. I didn't have much luck with them after I refrigerated the left overs - they turned out very hard on the outside.

Made these yesterday and I was surprised how easy to make these were.  I  did not use the bread machine and let the dough rise in the oven at 150 for an hour.  I have the recipe 4 stars because I will have to double the brown sugar and cinnmon the next time I make these.  Other than that...wonderfully yummy!

I've baked a lot of things and never had such a problem as I did with this recipe.  I followed it to the T, using Margarine AND butter where it is noted in the recipe.  As an avid pizza maker, I am familiar with how dough should feel, rise, etc. as well as how much flour to add to get the right consistency.  This dough was really dense, very heavy, and didn't rise more than 15%.  I've handled a lot of dough and this one already was raising a few flags as I kneaded it.  My yeast was good because I've been baking all week with the same jar, using the same temp water.  The dough seemed so dense that it was if I was suffocating the yeast, which I'm sure isn't possible but that's the impression I got.  After barely getting a rise from the dough after 2 sessions, bake time wasn't any more rewarding.  I have an oven that runs hot, and after 15 minutes (per recipe) they were still extremely gooey inside.  I baked them on the center rack.  After another 5 minutes they were still gooey, with hardly a change in texture at all!  So I moved them to the bottom rack and added an additional 10 minutes @ 350F, which seemed like overkill but I was determined to make this dough set up.  10 minutes later, after a total of 30 minutes of baking time (recipe calls for 15), they were STILL GOOEY!  40 min @ 400, still gooey.  The story continues!  They never baked properly.  I bake a lot of stuff, and with this many problems I'm giving up on this butter/sugar-loaded recipe for good.

The roll itself is unbeatable- no other recipe can touch the texture and flavor, so fabulous. I don't put in nearly as much cinnamon, but the brown sugar also makes it spectacular. I also make my own icing, as I have for years without a recipe (it's probably very similar though).

WARNING: The above recipe is MORTALLY DANGEROUS to your NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS!!! :} really, wow. unexpectedly good. 
followed recipe exactly. I was interrupted in the morning so the dough was left to rest pretty much all day after removing from the bread machine. Mine didn't leak any of the filling, so they didn't require flipping over. Maybe due to the butter spread not being tooo soft? Recipe made 14 very generous rolls, and enough frosting to satisfy your inner glutton. Fabulous recipe, and remarkably easy! didn't have bread machine yeast, but worked fine in my bread machine using regular yeast dissolved in the warm milk. So glad I finally tried it!

Add 1/2 tsp flour to the cinnamon/sugar blend to help keep it from running out of the rolls. Love the suggestion to immediately flip the pan! Can't wait to try that.

Really nice texture to the roll, came out excellent, but I can't say its my favorite cinnamon roll recipe.  Something is missing...  Also rated 4 stars instead of five because it lacks directions for people without bread machines.  I had to dig and find further instruction in comments.

Yep, 4,500 people were right.  Did not have a bread machine or a kitchen aid, nor did I need one.  I also used regular yeast and and a mix of all-purpose and whole wheat pastry flour.  They came together and rose beautfiuly.  Tasted tender and delicious, not hard or yeasty as I've had with other yeast recipes.

These are fabulous.  In order to bake fresh on Christmas morning I put the prepared rolls in the refrigerator before the final rise.  Took them out the next morning, let them double and then baked.  The smell of freshly baking cinnamon rolls was perfect for Christmas morning.  Delicious.

This recipe is great!  Definitely not a Cinnabon (not even close) but they are very good.  When I am too lazy to make my family recipe I use this one, and it is 2nd to best.  Some tips: When the cinnamon rolls are rising, heat your oven to about 110 degrees, then open the oven door and put the cinnamon rolls in to rise.  By the way, I make this by hand.  In the filling, add more butter.  Follow what another reviewer said and flip it over when it is done baking, because YES the filling does come out.  Thanks!

Cinnabon is using danish dough which is a three fold method incorporating butter. When they make the buns they roll out a piece of danish dough, spread it again with butter and brown sugar (might even be some cinnamon mixed in-been a while since I've had one), then they are baked and topped with drifond or 10x icing.

These are fantastic but I did very slightly alter them.  I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough in the bread machine and made about 1.5 times the filling recipe, blending together the cinnamon sugar WITH the butter before spreading on the rolled dough (a bit of a messy process but trust me...).  They were taking a long time to rise, so after 40 minutes, I put them into a cold oven, set to 375F.  When the oven reached temperature, I baked for 18 minutes - the results were perfect: big, slightly doughy (underbaked like cinnabon), ooey, gooey cinnamon buns!!

This is the best cinnamon bun I have EVER TASTED! I wanted a holiday taste just before the holidays so I got my fix. I thought instead of making it from the pillsbury boy packages I wanted to make it homemade. You have started my new tradition. Making cinnamon buns 3 or 2 days before christmas. Thanks so much they are the best

Awesome! Icing is great as well. 

Next time I will only make half the recipe though, the full amount of dough is hard to manage.
Followed the recipe without the bread machine like the most helpful review said, came out great. 

Only thing is that I think 4 1/2 cups of flour is too much, the dough became a little dry and I had to add more milk to fix it.

Edit: when I made half the dough was not dry!
Also I just had some Cinnabon a few days ago, this recipe is much better than the real thing! The only thing I miss is the makara cinnamon. If only I could get my hands on that!

I made this recipe as is except for a few changes.  I made the dough in the bread machine then cut the rolls up and put in the pan overnight to be baked the next day.  When they finished cooking I flipped the hot pan over onto a jelly roll pan and let the drippings run down over the rolls for few minutes.  I flipped back then frosted.  I omitted the cream cheese  as I have made it before with and my kids said the frosting was too rich.  Everyone enjoyed them very much.  Good recipe!!

It might just be my oven, but baking at 400 F for 15 minutes was going to burn them. 10-12 minutes was better.

Wonderful.  These are easily made without a bread machine; just proof the yeast in the milk before adding the remaining ingredients and complete as you would any bread dough.

These are the best homemade cinnamon rolls ever !The key to not having the   cinnamon and butter leak out during baking, roll up the log as tight as you can, and pinch the edges together. Then they come out perfect !

I LOVE this recipe (and so does my family :) I've made this many times exactly as written and have played with the spices, etc. some as well. As written is perfect - as long as you remember to flip the pan once it's out of the oven. Try adding orange zest to the dough and cinnamon mixture...it's amazing!

Omg... This is sooooo good, like I can't believe I made it.... The texture of the bread is really soft and just the right amount of chewy-ness.... It doesn't need a lot of the frosting, coz it's that amazing....Although, I doubled the frosting (just in case) I also didnt have any bread machine.... I just followed the other reviews... I added milk, sugar and yeast, waited 10 minutes, before adding eggs, salt and bread flour....

This is so amazing, that as we speak, I'm making another batch... Put the dough in the fridge, I'm putting that in the oven tomorrow, and giving it as a gift, to my bf's brothers birthday tomorrow....

Thank you for the recipe... I will make this, at least once a month....

Yummy - my husband had two as soon as they were out of the oven.  Next time I would follow the advice of flipping the pan over as soon as you take them out of the oven to let the cinnamon filling fun over the rolls and then frost them.

Spot.on. 'nuff said.  Seriously the best cinnabon copy cat recipe ever. Pioneer woman has NOTHING on this recipe. Everyone at work looks forward to the occasions that I bring these in. Being able to throw everything in the bread machine makes this so much easier than making the dough by hand. Anyone afraid of using yeast need not fear...try this recipe. No changes warranted. Perfect! Thanks for sharing. I have made these more times than I can count...the family looks forward to them on the holidays as well. I make them up to putting them in the oven Christmas eve night and we bake them for breakfast Christmas morning every year.

WOW! These cinnamon rolls are true to their name. They taste exactly like a cinnabon, probably even better! I've been making these for a couple of years now, and they never fail to impress. My mouth is watering just thinking about them! I always make them for christmas morning, and now my dad requests them when he goes up north with his friends in November, and they all RAVE about them. The one thing that I do a little bit different is I use s little less cinnamon in the mixture and add a little more brown sugar instead (personal preference). Sometimes I use a little more butter than called for as well. Fabulous recipe! Can't wait to make them for Christmas this year :)

Almost perfect as is!  The only change that I made was with the frosting.  I thought that the frosting recipe given was needlessly sweet and drowned out the cream cheese taste, so I halved the amount of powdered sugar.  So far, everyone that has tried both ways has preferred it this way.

I've made these too many times to count. Sometimes small, sometimes normal size, sometimes the size of a plate. They come out great every time! I mix the butter and brown sugar to make a paste to spread on the inside before rolling it up then I do flip them upside down so everything doesn't drip out. Just depends on how you roll it out on what size and how many you will end up with.

Those of you that say that these are too sweet, you clearly haven't had a Cinnabon before (or Cinnaroll since I am from Canada).  These are the things that will make the heart attacks that we have worth it.  I had one hot right out of the oven, and it tasted exactly like a Cinnaroll, but I found that I enjoyed it even more when it had been sitting out for a couple of hours (covered in Saran wrap).

Warning!  Do not share these unless you want to be continually making them or you are one of those people who have no problem saying, "No. I'm sorry I don't have time."  My son loved them so much he shared with his teenage friends and I ended up losing two weeks of my life after making them for parents and teachers and the senior trip!  They really are that good!  The only difference between these and Cinnabon is the type of cinnamon.  Regular cinnamon is a litte stronger.  As for sprinkling or spreading the cinnamon mixture I found that buttering and sprinkling was much easier than mixing it all and spreading it.

This turned out perfect, my husband couldn't get enough of them. I followed another member's advice and mixed the softened flour with the cinnamon and brown sugar for the filling so it didn't melt out, worked wonderfully, I will definitely use this recipe again.

Um.. YUM!!!!  I followed the recipe exaclty, using my bread machine.  The only problem was I put them in the fridge overnight for Father's Day the next morning.  I preheated the oven and stuck them right in... I should have brought them to room temperature.  It took them nearly 1 1/2 hours to cook through and I finally had to turn up the heat!  So, definitely set them out on the counter before you bake.  They were SOO good, I will definitely make this again and again!

I have tried and tried for YEARS to make homemade cinnamon rolls. For some reason, I always had a lot of trouble getting them to come out to my satisfaction. The very first time I tried this recipe, they came out terrific! Not only that, but I was able to repeat my initial success, never even using a bread machine. The only other thing I did differently was to combine the brown sugar, cinnamon & butter filling together prior to spreading it all on the dough instead of each item separately. Seemed easier and more uniform to me that way and worked well. Very labor intensive and time consuming but well worth the effort!

I've never had a cinnabon before, but these are awesome. I've only made them once, but I will make them more often once the cold weather hits.

Since my daughter has a milk allergy I made these dairy free by substituting Soy Milk=Milk, Crisco=butter, and I added half a container of Tofutti cream cheese in the topping as well. I also always add more cinnamon to any recipe! This was so delicious. A great way to satiate the sweet tooth of my milk-deprived  household!!

These have gotten rave reviews!  They were super easy to put together and very user-friendly.  I did make a couple small changes.  I made half cinnamon rolls and half peanut butter rolls.  I mixed the butter into the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture, as some reviewers suggested, and was pleased with the results.  I also only used a simple confectioner's sugar glaze for the rolls since I am out of cream cheese.  

For the peanut butter rolls, I simply replaced cinnamon with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter as the filling, and made the peanut butter glaze here for the topping
Great recipe!

Already can't wait to make these again. They are soft, tender and the frosting is wonderful. I thought the dough was a bit too gooey but after it sat it was just right. I baked mine at 375, but that may just be my oven.

These are better than Cinnabon.  Double the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter that you spread on the dough, and double the icing, for really gooey cinnamon rolls.  

DO NOT mix the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter together and then spread on the dough as someone suggested.  I tried this, and the brown sugar didn't caramelize; the caramelizing of the brown sugar is what makes them gooey.  Spread the butter and then sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over it as the recipe says to.

Also, as another reviewer stated, flipping the rolls over after you take them out of the oven is another key to gooey cinnamon rolls.

These are absolutely wonderful!  Everyone I have made them for go on about how delicious they are.  One piece of advice though is to make extra icing!  Also, one little secret to make these stand out more is to use dark brown sugar, not the more common light brown sugar.

I made two batches of these for the first time yesterday and they were sooo good! My husband brought them to work and they were gone in seconds and everyone loved them.  

I put my ingredients in our bread maker in the order of liquids-dry-then yeast. I pressed the dough/pasta cycle and just let it work it's magic.

Make sure you roll out the dough very even.  I hear people saying to dump them out and let all the gooeyness run back into them. I let ours sit in the pan and rise for about 1 hour or until they were almost as high as the pan before baking. I think sitting them for 30minutes wouldn't be near enough time. My turn out so most and big there is no room for the goo to run out.

I also added raisins and crushed walnuts to mine when sprinkling on the brownsugar and cinnamon.

I make them all the time and people tell me they are the best rolls they have ever had

I used to plan my flights around having enough time to grab a Cinnabon at the airport!  No more!  These were simply outstanding!  You can even "shortcut" by using a hot roll mix available at your local grocers!

tasted yummy. Cinnamon and sugar was just right. I think I might have poured the glaze over too soon which made the cinnabon a bit on the soggy side. I will need to make this again since this was my first attempt in making these cinnabons. well worth the effort.

I have made these three times now, and they have already become family favorites.  I am very happy with the way that they have turned out every time (especially considering that I dont have a bread machine and so have to raise the dough manually).  I am still perfecting getting that dough to rise properly.  Mine have all risen, but never as much as the recipe indicated that they should.  Still, an excellent copy of a cinnabon and a fantastic recipe.

this was a amazing cinnamon roll recipe! i made this for breakfast when my aunt was here and she said," these cinnamon rolls have an X- factor. indescribably good." 
this was a great recipes but i did make some changes. i put 1 and a 1/2 cup regular flour and the rest wheat flour. because of that they made them doughy in the inside and crispy on the outside. i also combined the cinnamon, brown sugar, and  butter all together in a bowl and used a batter spatula to spread it a round the dough so each part of the dough would be covered in the mixture. i have made this recipes 3 times and i always end up burning them, so this time i decided to put them in for a bout 8-10 minuets and they turned out perfect! thanks for the recipe!

I don't know what I did wrong. I spent $60 on organic ingredients and it came out hard.  The dough was not soft or sweet like Cinnabunn.  I don't think it taste like a cinnamon roll period.  It almost taste like a biscuit with icing.  I'm so disappointed. I wish the directions could have more tips.  I didn't even realize I would need a rolling pin.  I had to go buy that too.  I followed the instructions. Everything was room temperature. I used bread flour.  I bought yeast I don't know what bread machine yeast is but I bought regular yeast.  I would love to know what I did wrong so I can try it again with my left over ingredients.

Thank you for sharing!  I made these for my family and they love it!  I cannot believe I made Cinnabon Cinnamon Rolls!  They're so light and fluffy and they frosting is perfect!  Next time I am going to add more brown sugar since I have a major sweet tooth!

I made this for my husband's office party and it was all gone in a few seconds.  After a few days, his office wanted me to make another batch!  This taste like the real "Cinnabon" but 1/2 the price!

Truely a 5 star recipe. Did not need to alter any of the amounts or ingredients. First time making cinnamon rolls, and they turned out PERFECT! Very much like a cinnabon. One tip. To keep the filing from running out, you can take the end and sort of make a flap to close off the bottom om the cinnamon roll. Filing stayed in and turned out great! Takes a while to make, but SO worth it!

These cinnabons were awesome!! I made no changes to the recipe there was no need to.  I did not have a bread machine so I just mixed the ingredients by hand.  Takes a bit to make but so worth it!!

Tried these today and they came out PERFECT!  I followed the recipe as written except I mixed the butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon instead of spreading the butter and then sprinkling on the sugar.  It was really easy to spread out this way.

OH MY GOODNESS THESE ARE SO GOOD!! I will have to say that I didn't use the dough part because I already had dough made for my dinner rolls but wanted something different than my boring normal for cinnamon rolls so I used the filling and icing recipes. They turned out oh so good! Next time I will use the dough recipe here and see how it turns out, but I don't see how it can get any better! My family and I loved them that makes for a 10 star recipe! Thank-you

excellent recipe. didn't use my bread maker, just used my kitchenaid to mix/knead and rise as normally would any breads. definitely recommend using bread flour rather than all purpose, there is a noticeable difference in the results! i used white sugar rather than brown sugar for the filling and enjoyed the results, no filling draining to the bottom of the pan. used my own carmel frosting rather than the recipe included here.

Absolutely amazing!  Made them the night before and covered them with plastic wrap and stuck them in the fridge overnight.  I let them sit out for about 30 minutes before putting them in a pre-heated oven (350) for 25 minutes.  A little too much icing for my liking though and I did bump up the cream cheese to about 5 or 6 oz for a more cream cheesy and less sugary taste.  My husband ate 3 in a row!  This one's a keeper!

Delicious is all I can say. I made these for my kids and followed the recipe to the "T", something I rarely do. The rolls come out so soft and gooey and the icing is to die for. I'd rate it more than 5 stars if I could. I also love the fact that I can use my bread machine to help with dough. Winner!

This recipe was great!  Using a bread machine is definitely the way to go but I have made them without.  I found instructions on how to do it without a bread machine in the reviews.  They really do taste like cinnabon cinnamon rolls.  I usually make these for Christmas morning and I will say that every single time I make them, if I take them out of the oven when they are brown enough I find that they are still gooey in the middle so I think I will start cooking them at a lower temp for a little longer.

OMG!!!!!!  I have NEVER been good with doughs - I followed this to a T (only I didn't have bread flour so I used all purpose 4-1/2 Cups and 4-1/2 Tbsp that is the equivalent) and I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  I immediately flipped this out of the pan on to a cookie sheet and then iced - THEY WERE WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!

I thought I had a great recipe until I tried this one this morning.  I had 2 already.  Definately not good for the diet-but so yummy.  I used all purpose flour and the buns are delicious.

Outstanding recipe! I made a maple frosting instead of the cream cheese...since i didn't have any cream cheese on hand.  MAPLE FROSTING:   2 cups Powdered Sugar  2 teaspoons Maple syrup   1/4 cups Milk   2 tbs Melted Butter   3 tbs Coffee  pinch of Salt Just throw everything together in a bowl and mix until thick but pourable.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  This has been in my recipe box for over a year and only now got around to making them.  Cut sugar back to 1/3 c. and substituted 3/4 c. of the flour for whole wheat.  Baked in a glass dish @ 400F as directed and 3-4 minutes after removing from oven, inverted a metal cookie pan over top.  Then turned them upside down for about 10 minutes to let the filling redistribute.  Then turned the glass baking dish back right side up and iced them.  I can't tell you how perfect the texture was.  My family devoured them.

This recipe takes time and effort to make but is well worth it! I will DEFINITELY be making these beauties again!  I followed the recipe exactly and my buns came out perfectly.   I was confused by the "bread machine yeast" ingredient but apparently that's another name for ACTIVE RISE YEAST! Who knew?

These were a big hit for a family Thanksgiving breakfast!  I used butter in place of the margarine and followed another reviewer's hint to turn the rolls upside down before frosting.  I prepared the rolls the night before, covered with foil and placed in the fridge overnight.  In the morning I took them out, uncovered them, pre-heated the oven, then popped them in for about 18 minutes.  Easy and yummy!

Thanks for sharing this recipe Marsha! :) These are fantastic and I recommend that anyone who is "on the fence" about making these give it a try!   Like many others, I made these without a bread machine (have one, but like to do it by hand). I have made these twice now and have read many other's tips/modifications. I follow the recipe as written, and I really encourage everyone to line the pan bottom with wax paper, double the frosting, and bake at 350 (i have tried 20 and 25 mins... 20 leaves them just a little under baked for me).    I haven't noticed it in the reviews I have read, but if you are going to frost them in the pan you baked in, let them cool just a little while, cut them apart, and THEN frost.   These disappear quickly! Enjoy!

These buns are decadent!  Pretty darned close to a Cinnamon...maybe a tad firmer and less squishy.  MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS!

Since I saved the recipe a little over a week ago I have made this 3 times, with rave reviews every time. I will never look for another cinnimon bun recipie again, because this one is simply the best!

I've been resisting this recipe because I figured it was too much work/too hard/too time consuming.  Boy was I wrong.  I threw all the ingredients into my bread machine (subbing half whole wheat flour), turned it out and made my rolls.  After putting into the sprayed pan, I covered with a towel and put them in the frige overnite.  In the morning, I put them on the counter while the oven was preheating.  OH SO GOOD.  Totally impressed the hubby with this one.  Thank you for sharing, I'm sure these will be requested often.

Delicious.  I put 9 in a 9x13 and 4 more in a 9x9 - they need more room to spread out than a 9x13 allows.

Absolutely amazing! Did follow some great suggestions: Didn't use a bread machine, just used my mixer with dough hook. Let the yeast dissolve in the warm milk...then let it rise in a 200 degree oven (turned oven off right away when I put it in to rise), added the cinnamon mix to the butter and finally cooked about 2 min less than recommended. These were truly, truly amazing. Thanks to all those people who made these recommendations before me...  I didn't need to double the icing. Will make plenty of more times.

As suggested by another reviewer I made the entire 8oz container or frosting and used the frosting ingredients measurments as suggested by the reviewer. I also used aluminum foil and greased it so cleanup would be easier. Believe it or not it was difficult to roll the dough and not have the filling squeeze out. I mixed the sugar,cinnimon, and butter together then spread onto the dough. But I was so proud of my rolls. I have never made anything like this before and I really felt proud of the end result. My rolls may not have been rolled so nice and tight but it really didnt matter since the frosting makes them look pretty anyway. And I found that the rolls that were rolled a little loose cooked better on the inside, they weren't as "doughy" as the one or two that I did roll tightly. Splenda brown and white sugars were used as well as Smart Balance butter to save on calories.

Wow, were these good!  I proofed a package of active dry yeast with 1/4 cup sugar and the milk heated to 110 degrees.  Then I added the remainder of the dough ingredients and mixed with the dough hook in my stand mixer.  I finished kneading a little bit by hand.  Then I put it in a greased glass bowl covered loosely with greased plastic wrap.  I put it in the oven that I had preheated to 200 degrees and turned off for 1 hour.  I did as another user suggested and mixed the butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Then I just spread this on the dough.  My husband talked me into cutting them into just 8 rolls.  They were huge - just like real Cinnabons.  I made them the night before, covered and refridgerated, pulled them right out of the fridge in the morning and popped them in a cold oven that I then set to heat to 350 degreees.  In about 25 minutes, they were brown on top.  (My oven does cook a little hot.)  They were outstanding.  My husband thought the dough could have been a little richer to be just like a Cinnabon but the cinnamon filling and icing were right on.

Made a dozen last night, and have to make another this morning. Cannot keep the family away from these. They are Fabulous! I do not have a bread machine so I am mixing and needing the old fashioned way, right in a large bowl. I did use the tip of blending the sugar, cinnemon and butter to make a spread and I had no problem with filling at the bottom of the pan. Will bake them today in 2 pans as the middle buns yesterday were a bit doughy in 1 large baking dish. I think a little more room will distribute the heat better. Absolutely the best recipe for rolls and I have tried many good ones too!

These turned out quite well.  The dough was easily streched out and rolled well.  After cutting the rolls, I seperated them out on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer.  After they froze, I placed them in plastic bags.  Now whenever I want cinnamon rolls, I take a couple out the night before and put them in the fridge.  In the morning, take them out of the fridge and place them on the counter under a warm towel for 30 minutes.  Pop them in the oven and you'll never know they were frozen!

These are dangerous....no one should have the knowledge to make something this good.  I followed the recipe pretty closely. I don't have a bread machine so i did the mixing by hand. Other then that I added a little splash of lemon juice to the frosting (if you noticed, Cinnabon lists lemon flavoring in the frosting ingredients list) to give it that authentic taste.

I'm new to using a breadmaker and have always had issues rolling out anything for baking. I can tell you, the dough came out perfect in the dough machine and I didn't have to adjust a thing. I did add 2 Tbsp of Wheat Gluten to ensure a good rise, and it had a beautiful rise. I will admit I had troubles rolling up my log (due to lack of experience). I did melt the butter for the filling and added some of the cinnamon/sugar mix to form a paste. I wish had had made a paste of all of it as it would have been easier for me to roll then cut without some of the filling falling out. I did roll the pin across the filling to help push it further down into the dough, but it was still a little too loose. Again, all lack of experience. In the end, the rolls came out great. I baked at 325 in a convection oven for 25 minutes and covered with foil a little after halfway through baking to prevent overbrowning. Came out perfect. I used another recipe for frosting: 1/2 cup butter, 4 oz cream cheese, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract (beat well) and add 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, beat until light and fluffy. I smeared half the mixture on the hot rolls right out of the oven and saved the other half for "extra" as the first smear is supposed to melt over the hot rolls. I refrigerated over night, popped them in a cold oven at 200 degrees for 12 minutes or so, then turned up to 325 for 25 minutes (using the foil after about 15 minutes to cover and prevent over browning). Great recipe. Thanks !!! Yummy

I made these the day before baking, storing in refrigerator at the point they were ready to bake, allowing to get back to room temp prior to baking.  Were they as good as the real thing? NO, they were much better because the dough was cooked through and fluffy.  I did not get any gooey filling on the bottom of the pan so no need to turn pan over.  I used crisco for the dough, don't own a breadmaker so I dissolved the sugar in the milk, warmed to 125 degrees and then allowed the yeast to sit in that for 10 minutes.  I took other's suggestion and warmed oven to 200, turned off and then allowed dough to rise for 1 hour.  I also combined the butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon together for spreading but it was too thick so I warmed that mixture in the microwave for 20 seconds and it was perfect.

Absolutely wonderful! A recipe worth trying over and over again. I made a few changes, not major, just a matter of taste. I used butter instead of margarine, 1/2 package of fresh yeast- the dough was unbelievable!, and 1/2 lemon zest in the dough. I had to bake them about 25 minutes because they were huge.  Thanks Marsha!

I've made a lot of cinnamon rolls in my life and used a lot of different recipes looking for the "perfect" one.  I have to say that these are the best I've ever made.  My family of 5 will eat a whole pan in 24 hours.  My stepmom is one of those people who can pass on sweet things but when she tried half of a roll she immediately had to go for the other half because they were THAT delicious.  I'm so glad I found this recipe -- but my waistline is not!!

I am definitely not a baking expert, but I followed directions exactly and leveled all my measurements and these rolls were awesome!  Being at 5,000 feet elevation, I also decided to decrease cooking temp to 350.  They cooked for 15 minutes and were perfect!

Wow 6/5!!! For those who say these don't taste just like cinnabon they taste BETTER! Unreal, great recipe. Used the Cuisinart bread machine, and costco's double sifted flour. Turned out better than I thought.

I made the dough TWO TIMES & BOTH times the dough DIDN'T RISE. After investigating everything I did I think I microwaved the milk TOO LONG; it should not be bubbling, it should be WARM to the touch, NOT HOT; my stupid mistake. I did some more research & found Sandra Lee's recipe on FoodTV, which uses a frozen white bread loaf for the dough; THAT WAS A GOD SENT! I mixed the brown sugar, butter, & cinnamon together, which worked great. I used about 5-6 ounces of cream cheese & added a bit more sugar & vanilla... PERFECT! I greased a glass pie pan & placed the rolls in until they expanded. (PLACE ON A COVERED COOKIE SHEET, the juices spilt & smelled like I was baking burnt marshmellows!) Baked at 350 for 27 minutes. SOOO good!

I have made this dozens of times.  I have changed it a little bit everytime...not on purpose...more of an opps.  So...Make the eggs warm by placing in a cup of warm water.  Add the butter to the milk and warm both in microwave...they will melt as it cools to right temp.

This was a great recipe. A little extra advice on making this without a bread maker. Make sure your yeast blooms successfully before incorporating any of the other ingredients. I was impatient with my yeast and my rolls turned out alright in the end, but they weren't as big or as fluffy as i would have liked.

I make these on a very regular basis. It is always expected when the kids visit that I have these on hand, and both family and friends that don't bake, request I make them for them. I now keep a batch in the freezer at all times, and keep a batch of frosting (easily made in the food processor) in the frig. We pop them in the microwave for about 30-40 seconds, frost them, then pop them back in for another 30 seconds. They taste fresh baked and are enjoyed by all. I do take them out of the oven about 90 seconds earlier than I would if I wasn't freezing. I can't tell you how long they last in the freezer, because at my house we fly through them faster than they could ever go bad. :) Marsha, thank you so much, from myself, my husband, family, and friends, for sharing this recipe.

This is a solid five star recipe. I have made it over and over and it is consistently outstanding. No one can resist - even those who aren't huge Cinnamon roll eaters. Beware that it is a huge sugar rush if your eaters have any blood sugar issues you may need to modify or have them skip it altogether. The bread machine recipe is perfect every time. You can freeze these for several weeks with no impact on quality at all. I use small bowls and then put self-sticking wrap on them so that people can microwave them. They make great gifts during the Holidays. Bring them to work for a special continental breakfast. Don't count on baking these in a few quick minutes - these take time - and depending upon weather may take longer than indicated. I also found that temperature affects the dough more than with recipes such as bread. Well worth the time and effort.

I've made this recipe twice now, without a bread machine, and had excellent results.  I found the dough easy to work with and BOY are they good.  I did use melted butter instead of Margarine (I never buy margarine).  My co-workers hate me now whenever I make them because they can't resist having a half of one here, a little piece there.  They come out fine if you make them the night before and keep them in the fridge for the next morning.  30 seconds in the microwave or a couple minutes in a toaster oven does the trick.  They're even great cold!  I didn't have a 9x13" dish available so I just used a Jelly Roll pan and they were fine.  I didn't find the cinnamon at all overwhelming as some reviewers seemed to.  A great recipe!

While I felt these were excellent (followed recipe instructions to the letter) they weren't a clone of a cinnabon. However - without comparing it to the title I would rate them a 5!

These were fabulous!  To make this even easier I used frozen Bridgford dough, thaw overnight in the refrigerator and rollout in the morning. It's all about the frosting:) I will make this again soon!

Fabulous recipe!   Some notes not in the recipe that I got from reviews: I made it in a glass dish, with dark brown sugar, placed the larger rolls towards the outside of the dish before baking and inverted the rolls onto a serving platter directly after they came out of the oven. This was easily done by placing the serving dish directly on top of the pan and flipping both over at once.   I then iced them and chose to alter the recipe a bit by raising the amount of cream cheese by one ounce and cutting back on the amount of powdered sugar very slightly. This turned out wonderfully.   I do regret listening to another reviewer and cooking longer than 15 minutes. That was not necessary in my case, as they turned out less soft and squishy than I like cinnamon rolls. I will stick to the original time and temp in the future.   I will lessen the amount of cinnamon from 2 1/2 T. to 2 T. next time, as the cinnamon that I buy is very intense.   I will definitely make this amazing recipe again and thanks so much to the original poster!

I'm sorry but this was NOT a Cinnabon.  I'm not sure if this was a reflection of my baking skills, or the recipe but they were just ok.  I had never made cinnamon rolls before, and they were fine but not something I would make again.

i made a similar frosting for cinnabon style rolls, the recipe called for the frosting to be beaten for 12 minutes, it completely changes the consistency and flavor of the frosting and is wonderful, then just mixing it until it is blended well, try it, it is a complete difference.

The best cinnamon rolls I have ever had or made. I was a bit worried when they didn't rise when they were supposed to, but I decided to start baking them anyway and as soon as they were in the hot oven they rose up beautifully. I doubled the filling and that was wonderful. I also covered the bottom of the pan in some of the cinnamon sugar and a light coating of chopped pecans. I will definitely make these again.

For the life of me I could not get these to turn out right. However, I tried to follow other reviews directions for making them without a bread machine. I ended up with the ugliest, most delicious cinnamon rolls ever! They did not make it to the next day, no one cared what they looked like.

The brand of cinnamon you use can make the difference between 4 star & 5 star ratings.  Not all cinnamons are equal.  I buy CINNABON brand cinnamon and use it for my extra special recipes.  The taste difference between cheap and quality cinnamon is noticeable.  Don't believe me?  Try making the same recipe twice: with "generic" and any high quality (from Madagascar) product.  Your taste buds will adore you FOREVER!

Unbelievable!  I never thought that I could make something like this! My husband said that I should go into business with these! I followed the recipe to a "T" with one exception.  I altered the icing recipe so that the wasn't as much cream cheese added to the mix.  I'm not a fan of it.  It turned out fantastic!

I've made these twice now in the past six months.  That's not to say they're not good.  What that says is they're TOO good!  These are absolutely the best cinnamon rolls I've ever eaten.  However, the first time I thought the vanilla overpowered the rolls, so the second time I cut the vanilla in half.  It was perfect.  Still vanilla-flavoured, but not overpowering the delicious rolls.  I made this by hand, as I don't have a bread machine (I prefer doing things by hand anyway).  I used the method someone else gave on here, and many others followed.  Works perfectly.  Thank you!  This has become a special occasion breakfast :o)

I have to say that this is the best yet cinnamon roll recipe that I have ever made. Honestly, it is the closest thing I think that anyone will ever get to a cinnabon, short of stealing the recipe. The eggs and milk in the bread mixture create a more rich crust for the cinnamon rolls, and making it in a bread machine takes the work out of kneading the bread. So far, the several times that I have made it, the dough is perfictly consistent, and then easy to roll out. The brown sugar and cinnamon add a hugely rich caramel-like effect when the rolls are baking. Using brown sugar, in my opinion, is a better choice for sugar in regard to making a more rich cinnamon roll filling. Like others, I agree with turning the pan upside-down directly after baking, as it allows the filling to coat the roll and reintegrate itself. This recipe gets an A+!

Great recipe, I made it by hand.  To make by hand, I heated the milk to 110-115 degrees and added the melted butter, and sugar in a large bowl, then wisked in the yeast and let proof for about 10 minutes.  Then I scrambled the eggs with the salt and gently wisked in the yeast mixture.  I added flour about half a cup at a time, and followed through with the rest of the recipe.  They turned out great!  To make them seem more like the real Cinnabons, I made them into 8 rolls and put them in a 9X13inch pans and cooked them at 375 for 18 minutes.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

OK, I have made these so many times and have not rated these. Absolutely our favorite cinnamon rolls. Today I made one batch exactly as wrote and made another batch into caramel rolls. Both were so perfect and got rave reviews from my brunch for 15 people. These rise perfect and are huge and will impress everyone. I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes and they were perfect. I have tried the higher temperature but they get too brown.

These turned out great!  At first I was worried that they weren't rising fast enough ( i also used the manual method opposed to a bread machine), however they turned out really good.  I used Costco "Saigon" cinnamon, which had a richer flavor that was awesome!

These are so popular with my family that I now have to make them for Christmas breakfast AND make half batches for some of my family members to take home with them and bake later. I make them a few days ahead of time and keep them in the fridge. Then, I leave them on the kitchen counter for a few hours to warm up before baking them.

These were amazing! I followed the directions for making the dough by hand. The only change I made was to the icing. Instead of adding salt, I added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice. That is the flavor key for the "cinnabon" icing!

Not sure what happened with this recipe.  First the dough wouldn't rise, then I had to let the individual rolls sit out over night and they had barely risen at all.  They subsequently were dry and rather heavy.  The were still okay out of the oven, but the cut and bake kind I had been making seemed so much better.  I still have extra ingredients so I might try them again and see if they come out better.  Anyone have any suggestions? On the up side my husband and 6 year old son both really liked them, little man even went back for seconds but my 4 year old only ate half of hers.
-----------------------------------------

                Update!!!

After my second attempt at this recipe I can honestly say they are wonderful!  The second time I made sure the milk was not too hot before adding the yeast, secondly I made sure and followed the directions on here for turning out the dough which has to do with strectching it, folding it in on itself, and restreching it over and over, which helps it rise,  and BOY DID IT EVER RISE!!!  I turned it out and did the 'strech' thing before I rolled and cut the cinnamon buns out.  they rose about 3x (possibally 4x) the original size.  They came out soft, chewy and simply wonderful.  I sent the left over 8 to work with my sister in law and husband, and by the time he got back to the shop there was only one left.  I think that consitutes a success!  For those who have these turn out abysimal the first time, definately try them again and see if

I always wanted to make these cinnamon rolls, but I don't have a bread machine. Much thanks to ANDYTAMI, who provided instructions to those of us who don't have bread machines. To prevent the buns from getting stuck, I lined my pan wtih parchment paper, followed by a light application of cooking spray. They're delicious!

This is the first time I have ever made homemade cinnamon rolls, and let me tell you , this was time-consuming...BUT SO WORTH IT!! I will never buy cinnamon rolls again, these are 100 times better than any cinnamon roll i have ever had! Not difficult to make, and so moist and delicious when they come out of the oven. I don't have a bread machine so i went with a reviewers suggestion and dissolved a 7g packet of active yeast with 1 cup of warm milk and 1/4 cup sugar. I then added the rest of the ingredients, leaving the flour for last, and kneaded the dough by hand. Left it in the warm oven that i had turned on to 200 degrees and shut off immediately after the dough went in. Added the butter and brown sugar/cinn mixture to the flattened dough, rolled it up the long way, cut them into 12 pieces and let them rise for about 25 minutes in a 9x13 baking dish. Popped them in the oven on 400 degrees for 15 minutes and they were perfect! The only change I made was that i realized i didn't have any cream cheese so i added about 3 tablespoons of milk to the icing ingredients and it was delicious! Next time will def make sure i have cream cheese in the fridge so it will be even better. Thanks for a fantastic recipe, I wish i could give this 10 stars!

I made these the night before and I fell asleep! the next morning, they are risen to the top of the machine. i thought they were ruined. Still, I rolled them out and baked them. Perfect. Turned out fantastic despite my efforts!!

After reading the reviews, I had to find out what the hype was all about.  Well, let me tell you.
Amazing.  Soft.  Gooey.  These bun things smelled so nice, directly after frosting them, I ate the middle first.  The only thing I tweaked was I added a little bit of vanilla to the dough.  The recipe is great, everyone has his or her personal preference about frosting.  I'm all about the middle section of a cinnamon roll and this recipe has it down from ingredients to the oven time.  And, if you know your oven, then you're good to go.  My husband LOVED these rolls and was sad when they were all gone.  The only thing I did not like was waiting for them to be ready to eat.  Patience is a virtue with these rolls and they are worth the wait.

These are great!  I agree with doubling the frosting, because I like loads of frosting.  After looking at the many, many pictures of this recipe, I do have one suggestion.  Make sure to spread the frosting on while the rolls are still hot.  This makes the frosting melt down around the sides and into the spirals of the rolls, making them extra ooey-gooey-good!

After trying and liking several recipes from this site this is the first review I have ever written. This was such an awesome recipe I HAD to leave a review. I followed the instructions exactly and even transported them to a 4th of July party in the final rising state after they were cut and in the pan. These not only made the house smell great as they were cooking but they were the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had! They were a huge hit at the party I went to on the 4th, Thanks for the recipe! I will continue to makes these in the future.

I just wish I had enough foresight to make a pot of coffee to serve with this. These were awesome. My wife and I both are adding this to our recipe books!! If you roll it tight it is easier to cut into sections. However, a previous post recommended cutting with dental floss, I will try that next time. But I have nothing negative to say about this recipe!! Enjoy..but remember to brew the coffee! Thanks for sharing.. P.S.-we never use bread machine, always by hand. We proofed the yeast with the warm milk and sugar, then started adding other ingredients.

So delicious, fluffy and ooey-gooey goodness! I used regular all purpose instead of bread flour, sprinkled only 1/2 of the cinnamon/brown sugar filling & just enough butter to coat the dough, omitted the salt from the filling & glaze but added more cream cheese to the glaze. This made it even more guilt-free to eat (except for the C.C.). Thank you so much for this warm treat! Hope you have more yummy recipes that will satify my sweet-tooth. =)

I have died and gone to cinnamon roll heaven. Words cannot describe how tasty these are. I used a bread machine, baked them in a baking stone, added raisins to the filling, and sprinkles pecans on top. I was never a big cinnamon roll fan...until now.

I made these rolls for a party at work and everyone raved.  This is quite an endorsement since I work for an airline and Cinnabons are a favorite of many of my co-workers.  

I ran out of brown sugar and had to substitute white sugar for half the cinnamon mixture.  It didn't seem to effect the results.  

Congratulations on an great recipe.

I don't have a bread maker so I converted this recipe to use without one.  I made 10 dozen for a money earning project for the school and they were a hit!  So much so that I have been asked to make more.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  They are so worth it!

Oh yeah!  I don't know why I waited so long to make these.  I used the trick of inverting them onto a cookie sheet to keep the gooey stuff in and it worked great.  So much better than mall buns and they taste great days later popped in the micro for a few seconds.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Since I do not have a breadmaker I used the  suggestions on how to make them without the breadmaker and they turned out beautifully.  I even doubled the recipe and there were no problems.  

If you are going to double I suggest doing it twice or mixing in 2 separate containers because it's not easy for all of the yeast to dissolve in the milk if you do it all at once.  And the dough will rise better the first time is rises if there is not so much dough.  

Also be sure to add your yeast slowly into the milk and continuously stir.  I made the mistake of adding all of the yeast and then trying to stir the milk and I ended up with yeast stuck to the spoon and to the bottom of the bowl and not at all dissolved.  I ended up having to redo this part, adding the yeast slowly and it worked out just wonderfully. 

Everyone loved them and have been begging for me to make them again!  I hope you try!

I have made these 4 times now and have played with the recipe some each time. I made them as the recipe says for some friends and they loved them. I made another version for my family that was lower sugar and fat, as well as whole grain. I accidentally made them without eggs once too (oops). I use my mixer to make the dough, as I don't have a bread machine.

Following the recipe as written, the cinnamon rolls are fantastic. There is plenty of frosting (I don't know what other reviewers were thinking saying it was too little) and the rolls are huge- almost too much to eat in a sitting- but oh, so worth it.

Making them slightly healthier, I tried with 100% whole wheat and found them to be too heavy. Using one cup of AP flour did the trick, though (the other 3.5 cups as WW). I also used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda in the dough- and that works well. I used butter in the dough and frosting, but used Smart Balance Light Buttery Spread in the filling, which also worked well. In place of the brown sugar, I used Splenda mixed with a table spoon of molasses and the cinnamon. This resulted in no gooey filling, but the flavor was there. For the frosting, I used Splenda, butter and fat free cream cheese. It was a lot runnier than the one made with sugar and full-fat cream cheese, but, again, the flavor was good. Skipping the eggs pretty much resulted in a flat, tough dough.

My family prefers the healthier version, but we tend to limit sugar and get headaches from the full-sugar on

I reviewed many recipes before making. I too, like others didn't have a bread machine to use so I kneaded by hand for 10-15 minutes, and actually my kids enjoyed helping with this part.  I recommend using butter instead of margarine like another reviewer mentioned. I proofed the yeast and by this method what I did was warm milk to 110 degrees, then dissolved 2 tbsp. of the sugar in it, and then added the yeast and stirred till dissovled too. I put in the oven that had been pre-warmed to 170 and shot off to raise quicker the first time. I softened the butter in microwave ( not melted) and then added the cinnamon and sugar and then put on the rolled out dough.  I did 1 1/2 times the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter mixture like someone else mentioned. I put the rolls in the fridge the night before I made them and then put them in a prewarmed oven of 170 degrees to raise faster for my serving of them. I still took longer then I thought it would- maybe 1 hour. I doubled the frosting but was to much. I may 1 1/2 times it next time. I baked at 375 for maybe 20 minutes but was to long. They weren't burnt but just alittle more done then I liked. Maybe will try 350 next time. Very good. My family loved them. They are rich-- hard to eat more then 1 at one sitting.

This recipe is absolutely AWESOME!  I have probably made these more than a dozen times over the past few years.  They are always a hit!  Once they're cool, I like to freeze them individually, then put them in freezer bags.  One minute in the microwave in the morning and they're hot and fresh and taste just-baked.  Thanks for the incredible recipe!

These are great. I did half the sugar and butter in the bread part, and cut down the butter just a bit elsewhere as well. Also, if you want a really sticky filling, use 1/2 c. brown sugar and a small package of cook and serve vanilla pudding (instead of white sugar). Very sticky and delicious, just like a Cinnabon. And don't forget to flip them like other reviewers have suggested. It only takes a minute but makes a big difference. Great recipe!

This recipe has never failed to deliver...even when I let the dough sit in the bread machine overnight and feared the gluten had overdeveloped with all the kneading, they still turned out wonderfully soft and rose beautifully in the oven during baking the next day.

What a yummy cinnamon roll!  Very moist and just the right amount of cinnamon and frosting too.  I made a mistake when mixing the filling, I mixed all of the ingredients together and when I realized my mistake (having trouble blending ingredients), I warmed it up in the microwave to soften up the butter more, it made a nice paste!  I did notice that the bottom of my pan didn't have alot of filling on it, so I do think that it helped the filling to stay in the roll better and will mix it that way again in the future!  I made these in two 8x8 disposable pans (gave one away) and had plenty of frosting for both pans.  The ends pieces that didn't have filling in, I just smeared butter on them, than sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon on and they came out just like the others.

I'm only giving it a 4/5 because the recipe itself is rather unspecific.  I did as another poster suggested, and used Dry Active Yeast, and proofed it in the milk with 2 tbsp of the sugar.  Then left it for about 5 minutes.  When it got frothy, then I mixed in the eggs and butter (I didn't have margarine).  Then the sugar, salt and flour.  And though it doesn't seem like all the flour will get mixed it, it will once you take it out of the bowl and knead it with your hands for a few minutes.

Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.  Though next time I'll buy confectioner's sugar.  I tried to make my own (1 cup = 1 cup granulated sugar + 1 tsp cornstarch), but I may not have left it in the blender long enough, since the icing turned out sort of gritty.

I think I was more excited to write this review more so than making these! Ha Ha!
Ok, these rock, and well worth the work, yet a very "fun"work! I did add my own special touch to these. I took a package of the Quaker instant oatmeal in the cinnamon roll flavor, and sprinkled it all over the rolled out rectangle with the brown sugar and cinnamon, because I only had a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon in my cabinet. i also sprinkled a bit on top of the cut pieces right before I baked them......they were awesome!!!!!
Also, tons of butter on the bottom of my pans, and not one stuck when removing.
What a great Sunday it was in my house, and the best was the lingering smell of fresh cinnamon rolls throughout my house allllll day!
THANK YOU!!!!
hope you all enjoy this recipe as my girls and I did in creating these. ( they even helped me clean up the big mess, lol.

these are great, no hassle to make. What I do is melt the butter, and mix in the cinnamon/sugar and 'frost' the dough with it and THEN roll it up. It sticks better for me that way.

This was the best cinnamon roll I'd ever tasted. My daughter took the three-day-old leftovers (amazing that we had any) to the law office and said they disappeared immediately, with people asking her all day where she got them from. We will make these over and over again (and plan better so the "leftovers" get taken to the office less stale).

I've made these several times now and they are fantastic. I always follow ANDYTAMI's instructions for making these without a bread machine and they come out perfect every single time! This last time I brushed just a little melted butter on the dough, then added the rest to the cinnamon/sugar mixture to make a paste. I spread this on the dough and it resulted in the mixture not seeping out at all. Very nice. You'd be crazy not to make the frosting, it is just good as the rolls! Mmmm! These are just heavenly, thank you.

These were excellent.  I used Bob's Red Mill whole wheat flour in place of white flour.  I used slightly more milk and less whole wheat flour and the dough was still great.  I also used fat free cream cheese in the frosting.

I made these 'cinnabon's' for my family during the Christmas holiday.  They were ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  EASY.  Usually when I bake, I shy away from things I have to roll out.  But these looked too good, so I went ahead and rolled away!  Very easy dough to roll.  When all was said and done and they were iced, my family could not believe I made them.  They looked like those you would buy at a bakery.  I followed the directions to a "T"...didn't change a thing, and they were to die for.

This is an awesome recipe.  The dough was really easy to work with - probably the easiest dough I've ever rolled out.  I took the advice on baking from other reviewers and baked at 350 for about 22 min and they were PERFECT.  The ONLY thing I would mention is if you don't like cream cheese, the icing has a distinct cream cheese flavor.  I might try a different icing next time or just cut down on the cream cheese and use more butter or maybe a non-flavored shortining like Crisco.  Edit:  Here's the perfect icing:
7 Tbs Butter (softened)
2 oz Cream Cheese (softened)
1.5 C powdered sugar
1/2 tsp Vanilla
1/4 tsp salt
Whip until smooth and fluffy.

I gave this four stars only because my husband liked them a lot. I goofed and used self rising flour instead of bread flour. The second time I made it, it was MUCH better of course because I used the bread flour. I couldn't find 8grm packs of dry active yeast, only 7grm packs, so I used the 7grm pack and dissolved it in the warm milk. Be careful to make milk warm and not hot as this will destroy the yeast. I used my kitchenaid bread hook to mix the dough, finished it with my hands. I think the cooking time is actually too long or too high or something. Real Cinnabons are almost doughy in the middle, not quite done. These came out baked through and almost crusty; I didn't like that at all. I did not find the cinnamon sugar mixture to be too much, in fact, I might make more of it next time. As for frosting -- I am a frosting gal; the more the better. However, doubling this icing made so much that my rolls are  now literally drowning in it and I didn't even use it all. I will make this recipe again and try to perfect it with my changes.

these are soooo good! not 100% like a cinnabon, but close enough!! :) the only problem i have w/these is that i cannot stop eating them ;) do not double the frosting, the recipe already includes enough as is.

i do not have a bread machine and used my kitchenaid mixer to make these.  for those who haven't worked with yeast very much and need simple instructions on how to make these w/your mixer, i've included them in my food blog here: http://tinyurl.com/2l2uh9

This is the best recipe I've tried in a long time.  I've been making it now for about a year and everytime I make it, it turns out the same.  Gooey and delicious.  I use fat free cream cheese and also put in 1/2 whole wheat flour to make it healthier and no one ever notices.  My mom who has been making cinnamon buns for 40 years even asked me for the recipe.  I've even put it to the test and made a double batch and it still turned out great.  Kudos!

Despite looking beautiful, I really didn't care for these.  The dough had a good texture but was a little bland.  If you're having troubles with these cooking and not being done in the center, try baking in 2 smaller pans instead of one 13x9.

These are amazing. I really do suggest reading the reviews before you make them, because as someone else suggested, mixing the cinnamon and sugar with the melted margarine really makes a difference (it doesn't drip to the bottom, and you can tell if you've spread it evenly).

GREAT!  I made these and came to realize they are very similar to Alton Brown's Overnight Cinnamon Rolls.  The ingredients are very similar.  I am glad I made these.  It gave me a few ideas on how to make cinnamon rolls differently.  For example, my recipe I normally use you need buttermilk.  This recipe uses regular milk.  I like the butter in the icing.  Alton's recipe does not have butter in the icing.  That is a few things I take from this recipe for next time!  Also, I prefer to bake the cinnamon rolls @ 350 for 30 minutes instead of the 15 minutes @ 400.  They come out better.  Sometimes, slower is better! :o)

Best buns ever!!  I made them vegan by changing the milk to soy milk and changing the eggs to this:
1 tbsp flax meal simmerred in 3 tbsp water
and 2 tbsp while wheat flour!  They tasted just the same!

Fabulous.  I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed the dough like a traditional bread dough (proofed the yeast in the milk, added the eggs, butter, flour, etc) let it rise for an hour before rolling it out, and followed the recipe exactly after that and these were the best tasting cinnamon rolls I've had in a long time, (Not counting my mother's of course)  I even have a friend who can't stop nagging me to make them for her!  Great find, Marsha, thanks so much for sharing!!

FANTASTIC! I made a vegan version with soymilk, Earth Balance "butter," 1/2 cup vanilla soy yogurt to replace the eggs, and then used Tofutti "Better Than Cream Cheese" as my topping. Excellent!!!

I made these without a bread machine, and halved the recipe.  I added the yeast to the warm milk, mixed everything together but the flour, and then incorporated that and needed until it was smooth and elastic.  I also let it rise, rolled it out into buns, and put it in the fridge overnight.  In the morning, I let it sit out for an hour or so and then baked.  They were delicious.  Definitely listen to the baking time if you want it to still be a bit dough-y, like a cinnabon is.  I baked mine a bit longer and that is the only thing I would change if I made them again.  The icing was amazing.

I hate to say this because I had really high hopes for this recipe after reading all the great reviews. It was okay. Nothing special. I'll probably try other cinnamon roll recipes from this site. I can't say if this tastes like a Cinnabon, never had one. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

These are absolutely excellent! They rise well and taste good by itself, even without the frosting. I add cranberries, cinnamon/sugar into the filling. My family loves them. ^_^

This is the third cinnamon roll recipe I have tried and this one is by far the best.  I combined this recipe with another cinnabon knock off and used 1 egg, 1/2 cup butter instead of 1/3 cup margarine, 1 Tbsp. vital wheat gluten and 1 tsp. vanilla in the dough.  I also made this without a bread machine and it did not rise as much as I thought it would.  Check the freshness of your instant yeast.  I used a rolling pin to press the cinnamon/sugar mixture down onto the dough.  I baked these at 350 for 25 minutes and they were perfect, not doughy.  I doubled the frosting mixture because I did not want to waste the other half of my cream cheese but found that I had to much icing.  I took the cinnamon rolls out of the pan right when they were done and put the frosting all down the sides.  Bottom line--THESE WERE DELICIOUS!!  This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent! My son brought one to school and shared it with his friend. His friend even said that he is willing to pay for anything to eat this! I've tried adding 3/4 cups of chocolate chips with 3/4 cups of brown sugar and cinnamon, and skipped the gream cheese frosting, and they still turned out great!

This is a very good recipe. I sometimes also use raisins or chocolate chips for the filling. I do always get more buns than 12, about 16. I usually don't glaze them, because they're sweet enough, but it looks nice when you do.

Awesome!  I made them for a large group so I split the dough into two and made mini rolls (about 35).  The 2nd time I made it I split it again and froze one roll (otherwise we'd eat it all in a day).  This is definitely a keeper.

What more can I say than has already been said - these are just so good. I've made the buns twice and my family and friends  have given them two thumbs up both times. I didn't adjust the recipe ingredients or the method at all. Next time, I plan to add chopped pecans and raisins to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture for variation.

I'll be honest and say baking this was a real pain for me, but it wasn't the recipe's fault.  I didn't read enough of the reviewers' suggestions, so it wasn't as easy as I thought.  I don't have a bread machine, so I used the suggestions, and my dough didn't seem to rise as much as I thought it would.  The mixture for inside the buns spilled out the side as I rolled the dough!  It made a big mess, but everything was well worth it.  These were delicious, and I will attempt them many more times!  Suggestion: Definitely put the cream cheese topping on as soon as it comes out of the oven.  It's scrumptious!

The first time I made this it was a disaster!  Came out hard as a rock and didn't rise at all.  I knew it was my fault and not the recipes... my guess is that I killed the yeast.  Not wanting it to defeat me, I decided to follow the recipe down to the letter... minus the breadmachine.  I even looked up how to properly make bread... I dont do breads.  Used a thermometer, used the oven to regulate the temperature... it was great!  I was sooo excited when it actually doubled in size.  I'm going to make this again and try 3 different things... 1. rise, fridge, bake in the morning.  2.  Rise, Freeze, thaw, bake. 3.  Freeze, thaw/rise, bake.  Can you tell I'm not very good at this yeast thing?  :)  Oh, double the icing.... it's yummy.

My husband said he liked these better than Cinnabons and I didn't even tell him the name.  I didn't use the bread maker so I just used 1 7oz. pkg of active dry yeast. I used my Kitchen Aid to mix the ingredients and then kneaded the dough on my counter for about 6 minutes.  I proofed the dough in my oven.  Very easy and delicious.

These are better than anything I have ever tasted!!  They melt in your mouth. Be careful because I couldn't stop eatting them.  I like to make them ahead of time without baking and then I freeze them in a pan and take it out to rise the night before and pop them in the oven first thing in the morning.  This is a great way to get those kids out of bed.

I made these for Easter breakfast and they were absolutely wonderful!  I recommend using all of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture--it looks like a lot, but just layer it on.  Once the rolls were done baking, i tipped them over and allowed the gooey stuff in the pan to drip back on the rolls.  So yummy!

OMG!!!  Best cinnamon buns ever.

I altered only two things...  Changed the cream cheese for mascarpone cheese (that's what I had in my fridge) and I put the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter in a processer and created a cinnamon, sugar paste to spread on the dough (it is much more uniform that way and I saw a how it's made show for cinnabons where that is how they are made).

I highly recommend making these a little more luxirous by using the mascarpone cheese.  YUM!!

These are better than the bought cinnabons.  The dough is soft and tastes so much fresher.  I did not use my bread machine as I just happened to have my big mixer on the counter, so I used it.  I used the review to place the dough to rise in the oven that had been heated to 200 and then turned off. 
The cinnamon and brown sugar were the right amount for my taste.  Loved these.

I tried these with high hopes, but was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly as directed.  They did not taste like the clone they were intended - I agree with another reviewer that it took much longer to rise than directed, the rolls had a hard time staying together once rolled and trying to put in the pan, and the frosting didn't taste good at all (and I'm a BIG fan of cream cheese and sugary frosting). The rolls themselves tasted good, but firm - perhaps try another frosting?

Not quite as gooey as a cinnabon but still very good. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour which made it a bit more wholesome, but maybe that was my downfall.  I think next time I'll try adding sugar to the dough and cutting out some of the filling (other reviewers were probably smart to cut back). But I don't want to dis on them too much because we really did love them.

This recipe is fantastic, just like the others I would have given this 10 stars if allowed.  I made a couple of minor changes....I put three tbls of cinnamon instead of 2 1/2, and added a 1/4 cup milk to the frosting to make it spreadable.  Everything else I kept the same.  I plan on making these for every holiday and family get together because they are just that great.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.

These buns were gorgeous,similar to the iced danish that Greggs sell here in the UK but tastier with lots more flavour and cheaper,Made 14 good sized buns from this recipe,my husband took 8 to work and they were gone in seconds.
I used plain icing for the topping as i thought the flavours might be too overpowering for my kids and this was yummy too!

These were wonderful. The dough was so light and fluffy. I thought I lost them for a while and couldn't figure out why the dough wasn't rising until I saw the eggs on the counter, oops. The only thing I'll do differently next time (besides adding the eggs) will be to add even more cinnamon sugar filling. I want a gooier cinnamon roll.

YUMMY!  I used the recipe for Amish White Bread (from this site) for the dough and just followed the recipe from there.  The filling and the icing are GREAT!  If you don't have time to make the dough - using store bought frozen dough along with this recipe would STILL impress your guest/co-workers/family.   
I prepared the night before so when we awoke  all I had to do was put the pan in the oven.  Also, right after baking I inverted the buns into another pan to get all the yummy gooey stuff to pour over the buns.

Mmmmm!  I brought these to work and people were fighting over them.  Thanks to all who suggested doubling the frosting.  It was out of this world.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used to 9" rounds to bake, added about 1 c. of chopped pecans to the filling and also added a splash of lemon juice to the frosting to bring out the tang of the cream cheese.  I've never tried the original but if it's anything like this one, it's got to be good.  The only problem was they came out a little dry, but with the frosting it wasn't very noticable. Thank you Marsha!

Absolutely fantastic!!!  I used melted butter instead of margarine in the dough since I am rarely a fan of margarine in baking.  I honestly can't tell the difference between these and the ones in the mall, and this is my frist try with a yeast dough.  Never again will I pay $16 for two dinks, a cinnabon and  5 cinnastix!

I surprised my kids with these on Thanksgivng morning and all I got was smiles and the "you can make these anytime".  Make sure to use the fast rising yeast (I didn't and they still turned out fine, but better results with the fast rising).  Great recipe.  I be making them again over Christmas.

about 10 minutes out of the oven, 4 rolls are gone!it's fantastic!i did some changes (probably,you can try it too!)...a)i put in 2 types of flour.4 cups of bread flour,1/2 cup of all purpose flour.b)i mixed the yeast (i put in 1 tsp only) with an extra 1/4 cup of warm milk and let it rise for abt 30 minutes.c)reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.d)added 1 tbspn of bread/dough softener.e)mix some raisins and pecans with the brown sugar.TIPS:i sprinkle/spray a bit of water before putting the rolls in the oven so that the top wont be dry n hard.i had an extra rolls that can't be fit in the baking pan.so i put them in the muffin tray.and it looks cool!spiral on top but muffin-shaped below!i'll definitely bake more cinnamon rolls!!

This is fabulous. This is the 1st time i have made this, and it is so easy. i halved it because there's only me and my daughter and the ingredients halved perfectly. i thought at first that there was a bit much frosting, but as the dough isnt that sweet, it brings out the flavours really well. if the dough were sweeter it would be a bit sickly, and if there was less frosting, it wouldnt be sweet enough. perfect. thanks x

A couple of weeks ago was my husband's turn to bring in breakfast so I made these and they were gobbled up so fast he didn't get one. They received rave reviews from everyone and multiple requests for the recipe, especially the icing. Due to popular demand I made them again for him today for a morning meeting and he's going to make sure he gets one this time!

Absolutely the best!!!     I use butter flavoring in the frosting and it's fabulous!!  I let them rise for about 40 minutes in a preheated oven at 200 degrees that has been turned off.  Awesome!!

Delicious and super easy. I didn't do them in a bread machine and they turned out great. This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls.. and seriously... these are awesome! I used packaged cream cheese frosting instead of making the frosting.

I made these for my hubby for Father's Day this year. We live in Australia and don't have anything here that is similar to Cinnabon. He LOVED them......a little piece of his homeland right here in Australia! Worth it just for that........

Excellent!  Did everything up to shaping the rolls the night before and put the pan in the fridge overnight for the final rise, then baked off in the morning.  Thanks for a super recipe.

I had a favorite recipe for cinammon rolls, but tried these based on the outstanding reviews. These are definitely in a league of their own! Big, rich, soft, and delicious, with an incredibly creamy icing. The brown sugar and large amount of cinnamon in the filling really make these standout. Definitely use a shiny, not dark-coated pan, as the outside will be too dark before the center ones are cooked. Truly amazing rolls!

What more can be said? Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! I used a bread machine to make the dough. Easy. Mixed the butter, cinnamon & sugar together, rolled out the dough, spread it on. Easy. Rolled it up, cut into 12 pieces. Easy. Put in fridge overnight. Left out for 30 minutes before baking. Easy. I also made extra icing...for those who love to slather it on! SO easy...and absolutely fabulous!

I changed half the flour to whole wheat, and half the sugar in the dough to Splenda, and they still turned out beautifully. I also halved the icing and just lightly drizzled it over the top to cut down the sugar a bit more.  Great recipe.

This is an awesome recipe for cinnabons. I cannot get over how incredibly delicious they turned out. If it wasn't for all the great reviews, I never even would have tried it because so many other recipes have failed for me. Thanks so much! This recipe will stay with me forever.

These are fantastic.. you can use the cream cheese icing.. or just a regular butter icing drizzled on top (for those who might not like the cream chees taste) But I like them exactly the way they are!!! I let mine rise a little more and they were so fluffy.. GREAT RECIPE. Also.. you can make these by hand if you don't have a breadmaker.. just a little more work!! 
Thanks again

These are awesome.  Not a lot of effort, but worth the time it does take.  I use my kitchenaid mixer.  When making the filling I found that if I use a whole stick of butter softened and mix the sugar and cinnamon in with the mixture and spread it out on the rolled out dough it is SO much easier!! Works great.

I made some the other day.  A double batch.  FIrst of all, I didn't use all of the filling.    I will use all of the filling from now on.  But I made them smaller, so I could fit 12 in a disposable aluminum rectangular cake pan.  I did not double the icing because I always have leftovers, but I ran out.... so if you make them smaller like i did, i would recommend doubling the icing as well.  but btw, they are just as good with or without the icing. i brought a pan to my MOPS, and sent a pan with my husband.  they were GONE!  and bob came home with requests for more.  apparently they are willing to pay for me to make them.  I could put Cinnabon out of business.  WELL!  Imagine if I had used all of the filling! LOL!  This is a keeper.  Thanks  for sharing this recipe with us.

I've found this recipe years ago, but haven't really had the opportunity to bake it since then. Since we're having a Christmas potluck today, I decided this recipe would be perfect, as cinnamon rolls/buns are unknown in Belgium.
They looked so great in the pan I couldn't keep myself from eating one for breakfast (I baked them yesterday afternoon), and I gotta say they're super!
I didn't use the suggested frosting, as I was afraid it would be too rich for breakfast, but I drizzled a simple frosting made of 1 cup confectioner's sugar and 2 Tb milk on the buns, and they are still great.
These should be absolutely out of this world when fresh out of the oven!

I tried this recipe last night and it turned out to be really wonderful!!
Much better than the real Cinnabon, it was very soft and perfect. Thank you so much Marsha. I doubled the frosting recipe and loved so much.
This morning, my husband was eating one and said, he could eat even two or more!! I will definitely make it again.

These were great and rich. Making the dough the night before and putting them in the next morning is the simplest way to go.

Believe it or not this recipe is also great in a Low sugar version I created!  Use "Splenda" blend instead of sugar, and use "Splenda" granular in the frosting.  Great for Diabetic exchanges.  You do need the blend so the bread will rise properly (sugar is needed to activate the yeast).  Then you can use one cup of "Splenda Granular" and 1/4 cup of "Log Cabin" syrup to create the (1 cup of brown sugar)  these turn out wonderful!  Great news, update!:  Splenda now has their own Brown Sugar Blend! I have used it an it's wonderful! So you can either use the "Log Cabin" Or now the "Splenda Brown Sugar Blend". for this recipe!

wonderful, but pay careful attention and make sure you roll out the dough to 16x21.  The reason is that if the rolls aren't exactly the right size, they will come out doughy.  You may also want to increase the cooking time by 5 minutes.

Excellent, excellent recipe. Using the bread machine to make the dough saved a lot of work, and gave me perfect dough. My aim was to make soft moist cinnamon rolls as most of the ones I've tried are dry and hard, even after reheating. These turned out wonderful and are absolutely perfect served fresh, straight out of the oven. You can't skimp on the butter if you want the rolls to be moist. I also skipped the icing as I prefer my rolls plain. This recipe made 24 good sized rolls. (I stretched out the roll before cutting into 1 inch widths.) I'd imagine if there were only 12 they'd be too massive for me. Packing them reasonably tight is important so they don't unfurl.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic!  When I took the dough out of the breadmaker, I was quite surprised to find that the dough was the most silkiest and smoothest dough I had ever felt or seen.  The plan was to make these just for my son's school bake sale, but we ended up eating a few.  Now a few days later I'm making them again for my husband for dessert.  Terrific!  TIP:  put all of your liquid ingredients in the breadmaker first, but make sure that the water isn't too warm since the egg will cook itself.  Than sift your dry ingredients together and throw those in on top of the liquid.  make a hole in the middle of the dry ingredients and add your yeast.  Easy and Wonderful!

Yum... these are the best! I've been making these since November, and everyone I've made them for loves them!!! I buy creamy caramel in the tub located in the produce dept. in most grocery stores. After frosting the rolls while still warm I put a small amount on the top of each roll and add a few pecans....mmmm.....!!!! Thanks Marsha for such an easy and great tasting treat!!!!!

These were FANTASTIC! as close to a Cinnabon as you´ll get. My recipe yieldied 16 rolls and the only thing I wasn´t CRAZY about was the fact that the brown sugar and cinammon mixture didn´t quite melt and the sugar´s texture was too coarse. Gooey, yummy and absolutely satistying, watch out for those calories though!

Thank you, Marsha, for posting this incredible recipe.  I have made these cinnamon delights many times with fantastic results.  People who have tasted them have raved (for days!) and always ask for the recipe.  I use 2 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon instead of 2 1/2 Tbsp. - as others have noted.  WARNING: you only want to make these if you have someone to share them with because you'll be tempted to eat the whole pan!!  Super simple and delicious - the perfect recipe.

This recipe was great!  I've tried several cinnamon roll recipes on allrecipes, and this one is surely the best. I followed the directions exactly.  Be sure not to overbake, as true cinnabons are not crisp at all.  I don't know if this is okay to do or not, but on recipegoldmine.com, there is the authentic cinnabon recipe listed.  It's FANTASTIC.  As for the bad rating one viewer gave, claiming that these did not come out well, nor do any of the recipes that she uses.....maybe the problem is not the recipe???? Just a thought.

Amazing - These rolls are just like those from Cinnabon.  I have made these twice and followed the advice of another reviewer to reduce baking temp to 375.  I prefer the lower temp.  Delicious!

Very good - definatly turn down the heat - 350 degrees for 25 minutes using convection heat.  I use about half the cinnamon mixture and don't usually make the icing but it is good both ways!  Wonderful for a warm breakfast - make them in the evening put in the fridge for the second rise & pop them in the oven while you're in the shower! I've taken them to the babysitters hot from the oven twice & everyone enjoyed them!

This was super and easy to make.  I do not have a bread machine so I did it the old fashioned way.  Turned out great.  It was so sweet that a little icing goes a long way.

It's no lie - they really do taste like the real thing. And what I'd pay for one at Cinnabon I can make an entire batch. Warning, though, while you can't eat just one, this is a big batch. My neighbors were very surprised today as I knocked on doors, passing them out. I left each house with a smile as they thanked me! Thank you for submitting this TERRIFIC, quick and affordable recipe.

Oh my Gosh! These are wonderful and taste just like the real thing. I added 2 Tablespoons of flour to the brown sugar/cinnamon mix and baked on the 2nd lowest shelf in my oven for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. Also made a double batch of icing. My whole family loved them! Thanks for the delicious recipe Marsha.

SO GOOD!!  The middle really does taste like a cinnabon.  I had to make two batches of frosting though because one was just not enough! Also good with melted butter and brown sugar put on the bottom of the pan before baking!

I have always wanted to make Cinnamon Rolls, but never had the nerve. I love Cinnabon's and when I saw this recipe, decided to give it a try. For someone who has never even rolled out dough, this came out EXCATLY like Cinnabon's! I am forever thankful to you Marsha and everyone who reviewed this recipe. Mahalo from Hawaii.

I made these for my sister's birthday, and they were wonderful. Everyone loved them.

Incidentally, someone asked how many Weight Watchers' points there were in these - I figured it as 13 points each if you use it to make 12 buns, and 8 if you make 18.  ((I have a little program for the computer where you input the fat grams/calories/fibre and it gives you the points.)) Hope that helped!

These cinnamon rolls were great, and easy to make! I sprinkled toasted pecans on top of the iced rolls for some extra crunch.  Next time I will double the recipe. One batch is not enough.

These rolls came out beautiful, everyone was very impressed. I made these the day before and covered them with foil and put them in the fridge without letting them rise again, then popped them in the oven the next morning. Because I do not have a bread machine it was more work, but definetly worth it.  I plan on making them again soon.

WOW.  These definitely lived up to the reviews I read.  I made the whole thing by hand and they turned out quite well.  The scent filled the whole place, mmmm.  Dental floss definitely works well in slicing the buns.  They were a little gooey in the middle but I guess I will leave them in the oven a bit longer next time.  And don't be stingy with the butter - the more butter on the inside, the more gooey the filling is!  A great recipe for a bake sale.  Oh, and one more comment, they are definitely too rich to eat more than one at a time!  I got sick this morning eating so many.  ;)  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!

These are absolutely the BEST cinnamon rolls ever!
They are exactly like the original Cinnabons. I don't have a bread machine so I made them with a hand mixer and alittle of elbow gease. It was well worth the effort. Where I am currently living, we don't have a Cinnabon bakery so this is a very welcomed recipe in my home. The whole family loved them. Thanks for such a great recipe!

These were really good and easy to prepare.  I sent two batches to my husband's 
workplace for a potluck.  Everyone loved them and several people requested the
recipe.  I did double the frosting recipe and this made plenty for the rolls.
I will be making these again for my daughter to take to school.  Thanks for a
"keeper" of a recipe!

Incredible is the first word to come to mind, but is still not adequate enough to describe how good these are!  I also put in the frig over night and baked in the morning with great results (as another reviewer).  Thank-you for a recipe that will be cherished for years to come.

The recipe was very good.  Not sure if other people had this experience, but my rolls turned out HUGE!!  Very tasty.  The icing was a little rich, but if you are going to make something this good, what the heck.  Great recipe.  (I make regular cinnamon pecan rolls for holidays, so this was a minor and pleasant change.)  :)

This receipe is wonderful. It takes like the real thing. The dough was really easy to make in the bread maker. My son loved to put the icing part on.

Makes a very tasty and soft-dough cinnimon roll - just wonderful. Will make again for sure! I found that the filling was a bit too much and ended up using less, with leftover brown sugar/cinnamon. Next time i'll make it with less filling.

There are the best I have ever made.  I do take the dough out of the bread machine before the first rise and place in a covered bowl so it dosen't get crusty.

I made them for the first time in the wee hours of the morning as a surprise for my other half. This batch was definitely a learning curve. I know what I did wrong and I'll fix it and do it right next time including not getting the milk so hot it ruins the yeast. I know better, I just messed up.
Even though I did a few things wrong, they came out great anyway ! The taste is fantastic and I'm looking forward to making my next batch and doing it RIGHT !  They are to die for !

These turned out awesome! other than not having a bread machine, I followed this recipe exactly. very good quantities on the ingredients. I saw another version of this recipe that called for just 2.5 teaspoons cinnamon vs tablespoons- use tablespoons of you are duplicating the cinnabon.

Second time making this and just now getting around to writing a review about them. These are delicious and super easy to do without the bread machine. The first time I made them I used All Purpose flour because I didn't have any bread flour and instead of the 2 eggs I substituted 6T of egg whites because...again I didn't have any eggs. Well They turned out okay, I was actually amazed that they still turned out as well as they did. Today I made them again following the recipe exactly except I didn't bake them right away(I left them in the fridge overnight and popped them in the oven this morning at 350 on conventional bake it took about 13 minutes to turn golden brown) definitely recommend the bread flour, it just has the consistency that you need for cinnamon rolls. The All purpose flour ones were just too soft and had a weird flavor to them.

Very Good. I accidently put cinnamon in the dough but it was still fantastic. I used plain sugar in the frosting because I can't have the corn starch in powdered sugar and it turned out great, sans belly ache.

I made this without a bread machine. As we're currently living in Denmark, we don't have the luxury to drop by the local shopping center. But when the craving set in I made this. And it was awesome. So so yummy. The sugar is still a little raw after 15 minutes but it was delicious. And I highly recommend it.

It was an amazing batch of cinnamon rolls.  The teachers at the breakfast all loved it.  I read the reviews and melted the butter to mix with the brown sugar and cinnamon before spreading onto the rolled out dough. Baked it at 375 for about 20 min.  Icing was as recommended....perfection!

I tried this recipe for the first time a few years ago following the instructions and using the bread maker. Now I'm at pastry school and currently learning about breads so this time I made them by hand and added the salt and butter at later points (as the yeast doesn't like them) etc. I also used butter instead of margarine. Anyway, these were absolutely fantastic. And I would say much better than the ones I did previously following the recipe exactly. Will be keeping this modified version on hand.

I made these without a bread machine, using one packet of yeast.  I am not a cream cheese fan so used my own icing recipe.  I thought the cinnamon rolls were great but will decrease the amount of cinnamon a bit the next time I make them.  I use a high quality cinnamon and felt the cinnamon was a bit too strong.

Wowza. I love these even more than Cinnabon, because they aren't hard & icky on the outside like a lot of the Cinnabons end up being. They are so chewy, soft & perfectly cinnamon! The cinnamon filling tastes JUST like theirs & the icing is delicious. I'd take these any day over a Cinnabon. We're saving this recipe & doing it often, I guarantee you that! It wasn't too hard either, my boyfriend, who isn't great at following directions & baking in general, was able to pull it off without a hitch! Though we had to use the toaster oven to bake because our oven is broken & for some reason, they took almost half the time said here, but it might be due to it being hotter or something, not to mention we had to do them in 3 batches because the toaster oven only fits so much, ya know? Anyways, I love these & ate most of them already & there's only 1 left, even though he made them about 3 days ago!

The buns are amazingly good! I followed some reviewer's advice and I made this at night then left them overnight in the fridge. Nothing better than having hot cinnamon buns for breakfast! I also got creative and made 1/2 of the dough with the cinnamon filling and the rest with a chocolate one... (substituted the cinnamon for chocolate powder and a few chocolate morsels). I personally preferred the chocolate version but my family loved the original! For the frosting I used another recipe from this site that used only 2oz of cream cheese. I will definitely make it again... Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this had a great flavor.  I used it in the bread machine.  My dough did not rise well and the  was very dense.  After rolling it out and cutting it, it still did not rise.  I tried the boiling water in the oven with no success.  Gonna try something else!

I didn't have bread flour but found out I just needed to add a TB all purpose flour to a cup of all purpose flour. I forgot to adjust the liquid so my dough came out a little dry, but I adjusted it before rolling it out.  OH MY GOSH. DO NOT CHANGE A THING WITH THIS RECIPE. I don't know what the problem was with people who didn't like it, maybe not following directions correctly. This is MY ONLY cinnamon bun recipe. My kids raved, and so do I. Excellent all around. Gonna make another batch for work this week and I can't wait! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Oh, my! THIS is absolutely the best cinnamon roll recipe I've ever used! Guests positively gushed over them and they disappeared so quickly! I didn't use any icing, it doesn't need it and I always think it takes away from the cinnamon roll and turns them into overly-sweet desserts, if you know what I mean..:) I also used a few handfuls of raisins in the filling as my Mom used to do. Next time I may add the raisins into the dough but whatever you do...try them!!!

I made these once and they came out amazing. I definitely recommend giving this a try if you haven't. And honestly the 3 hour prep time is totally worth it.

This recipe was definitely worth the effort. While it was time consuming, the results were enjoyed by the whole family. I would suggest preparing them the evening before and then cooking them off the next morning as I see some reviewers have done. I like this recipe better than cinnabon.

A-mazing. Tastes just like Cinnabon, IMO. I don't have a bread maker, so I took other users' recommendations and used my stand mixer. I've made these 3 times now and they've turned out perfect each time. My only recommendation would be to make a double batch of the frosting. One doesn't seem to be enough, plus I like to have extra for on the side. I also like my frosting a little fluffier, so I usually add extra confectioners sugar as well. ;)

I have made these a few times. I use butter, not margarine. I also make them them the night before and let them rise in the pan overnight and bake them in the morning.  My coworkers call them cinnacrack, and fight over the last few .  Amazing! And easy!  They may score low on nutrition. But they score top marks on taste!  Worth every calorie, carb and fat gram!

This is a great recipe. I don't live in an area close to cinnabon so I relish it when we go to a larger city. These were not even close to cinnabon. They were really good though and easy to make. All of my family enjoyed them. Thanks for all of the great tips.

I love this recipe, but it's tricky if you're not using a bread machine and I don't have one. A couple of things really matter. Don't use bread flour. I did and they came out dry and more fibrous than when I used plain flour. Definitely foam the yeast in the milk first. Add the flour to the wet ingredients a cup full at a time. Depending on humidity, I've used anything from between 3.5 to 4 cups of flour. The dough should be a little sticky when you turn it out. Knead for about 10 mins to get the gluten moving, but not longer or the rolls end up tough. Let it rise until, when you stick two fingers into the center and pull them out, the hollow stays. Don't depend on time, just be patient. The finger jabbing trick is the best way of all to tell when it's risen enough. I do the same trick as another commenter - mixing the filling of butter, spice (I add a bit more cinnamon and a tiny bit of ground cloves) and brown sugar into a paste and spreading it on the rolled out dough. It is a LOT easier than the brushing and sprinkling. Finally, I add raisins on top of the filling. I just like hitting the chewy bits.
I've used this same recipe about 10 times now and kind of hit my stride with it.

Ok, so these are the real deal.  I do have a few tips though, which is why I gave them a four.  The first time I made them, the buns were too big for a 9x13 pan, so I put the over flow (two rolls) in a 8x8 pan.  I used glass pyrex baking dishes.  The two that were in the 8x8 where absolutely to DIE FOR!  BUT the rest of them were not even mildly done in the middle.  Quite disheartening after three hours of baking...  So I actually put them back in the oven, and it kinda sorta salvaged the ones on the outside.  But I made them again today for father's day brunch and used a roasting pan, and made sure to leave space between each roll.  I also lowered the temp to 350 and cooked for about 25-30 minutes.  Worked much better.  The first time I made these I doubled the frosting, but had about 1/4 left over so I used a cookie scoop and froze individual dollups and added those to the single recipe today and it was the perfect amount.  Also, just a note, my family is fairly gullotenous, and well, frankly, these are huge.  Really, a roll is too much for one person unless that is ALL you are eating.  Next time, I will split this into two batches, and make the rolls smaller.  Then freeze 1/2 or even 3/4 and that way I can pop them in the oven if the mood strikes without having 3 hours of prep time.  Frosting doesn't need lemon, perfect the way it is.  Good tip to turn the pan upside down and let the goo soak back to the top.  Yum!  Great recipe thanks so much!

I made these for the very first time today, it took a bit of effort ( no breadmaker and just a hand held mixer with dough attachment), but OMG!!! SO worth it. Having read many of the earlier reviews (particularly, the one about how to make them without a breadmaker), I decided to double all the ingredients and make two batches. I actually used my crockpot (on the lowest setting) to raise the dough, and used a hot oven ...switched off before putting them in, to raise them again for 30mins). The only slight changes I made to this fantastic recipe, were:
I increased the amount of cinnamon by around 50%, and also increased the amount of frosting...just my own personal preference and tastebuds, but WOW! Fantastic recipe, definitely a keeper, thank you for sharing this recipe...I loved it SO much that I decided to write a review (which I never do). I had friends round for dinner and they loved these...my husband showered me with compliments, my home smelled like a cinnabon shop ( Heaven :) for me). I became addicted to these in the States, and have long lamented the lack of Cinnabons in Ireland. Thankfully, my craving is now satisfied, just have to pace myself to not make these more than once a month, ....too addictive! Finally, a real Cinnabon clone!

A favorite whereever I take them-- it seems someone always asks for seconds after the whole dish is already gone.  Sometimes I double the batch and add an extra packet of yeast to the dough to ensure the dough rises properly.  I also substitute REAL butter for the margarine.  Be sure to pour the icing over the buns as soon as they come out of the oven so that they are as close to the gooey texture of an authentic Cinnabon.  Be prepared to add an extra workout or two to your week if you make these--they are irresistible!

Thank God for bread machines.  These were so easy that I made them 3 times in a single week.  I ate so much that I'm tired of eating them.  I'm sure that will wear off eventually and I'll be back to stuffing my face again.  :-)  The first batch I made I used the size recommended in the recipe.  The other times I made them smaller.  Friends and family loved them, too. Thanks.

Made these on Christmas day 2012 and my friends are still raving about them. Have made numerous cinnamon roll recipes in the past, but this one is the best ever. You won't be disappointed.  I didn't use my bread machine, just my heavy duty mixer. They were perfect. Thank you for a great recipe.

Better then cinnabon. I do them the night before.  Complete every step up to putting in pan.  Cover and heat in a cold over in the morning.

I can only rate the frosting and it is phenomenal! The only reason why I didn't try the dough is because I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.  I would hate to rate it based on only one step. And I can't stand it when people rate a recipe when they have changed it.  Only rate it if you follow it exactly!

Absolute WOW! These are a must make. I will pass on some tips that I picked up here - they make the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had! I do not even miss the fact that we don't have a Cinnabon in my town. Follow each of these tips for perfect deliciousness:

* 1/2 a pack of vanilla pudding instant mix into the flour

*turn the oven down to 350, cook for about 20 min

*double the filling mix for extra gooey yumminess

*mix the butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar together in a bowl, then spread  onto the dough

*invert the rolls onto another pan as soon as they come out so that all of said gooey yumminess drips down into the rolls

*slather half the frosting on as soon as they come out of the oven, and five minutes later, slather the rest (my family LOVES frosting, so I doubled this too - it was more than enough, I still have some left over)

I used round cake tins to make mine and then inverted them onto a glass dish. Make sure you oil the pan good and they will just come right out. These make a LOT - I had plenty left for the weekend. I cannot reiterate just how delicious these are - my husband is not a fan of sweets, and he was licking his plate with his finger! These should be a go to recipe for everyone. Again, this is a must make.

I don't have a bread maker but followed suggestions under the reviews. I also replaced the cows milk with almond milk and the eggs with egg whites and used rapid rise yeast. They were billowing out of the pan....

I add either lemon extract or lemon zest. If you eat a Cinnabon you will immediately know that there is lemon flavoring in the icing.

Super yummy good!  Added maybe 1/2 cup extra of brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.  The frosting needed extra powdered sugar to be the right consistency.  DS said best ever!

Came out great even though I substituted AP flour, didn't know if my yeast was alive and had no powdered sugar so I made up some stovetop glaze. It still tasted like Cinnabon from the mall.

You will never need another recipe for cinnamon rolls! I will not buy premade cinnamon rolls anymore- a little time and we have some that are 100 times better. I always follow the recipe to a "t". No changes are necessary

These rolls are Uh-Mazing!!!!!!!! The only thing I did a little different is, after tasting the icing & wasn't 100% satisfied, I added a teaspoon lemon which taste exactly like cinnabons! The dough itself was perfect, the sugar cinnamon mix is perfect and the icing was almost there!!!!! Great recipe! My family asked me to make these as often as I could.

Awesome!  I haven't had a cinnabon in a long time, but this is pretty much what I remember them being like, and it's sooooo good!

Now, I have to be honest, it took me over three hours from start to finish to make these.  I've never really made my own bread but I have a lot of baking experience.  I didn't factor in the time for kneading the dough since I don't have a bread machine.  Also, my dough wasn't really rising much so I let it go a little longer and put it in my oven after warming it up just a bit and then turning it off.  I rolled the dough out on flowered wax paper, but I guess I didn't use enough flour and my dough stuck to it and I had to very carefully peel it off.  Speaking of rolling out the dough, it took a lot of rolling for me to get it to the specified size.  All that being said, I think it was worth it, just make sure you allow time for these random things you don't predict will happen :)

I printed out this recipe a few years ago and since then, it has been my ONLY cinnamon roll recipe.  I make NO changes and it turns out perfect time, after time, after time.  Next time you want to impress family or your pot luck brunch buddies, assemble everything the night before, slice, place in pan and refrigerate the night before.  Then when you get up in the morning, pop them in the oven.  Yyyyuuuummmm!!

This is a very satisfactory recipe, the second egg is a good idea. I use butter instead of margarine. If you slather the log rolled dough with butter, they will not stick to each other. The premium cinnamons in the market shine in this recipe. Also for a epicurious flair,  thin stripes of molasses plus drunken raisins  and orange zest added before rolling up will dazzle your frieds. The same for the addition of Mexican vanilla in the dough, too.  Always bake on parchment paper for quick cleanup. Nutmeg in the dough may please people too.

UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!! The only dough I have ever worked with is a pilsbury ready made pie crust but I was up for the challenge of making homemade cinnamon rolls for Christmas Brunch! I did not use a bread machine nor a Kitchen-Aid mixer and these turned out wonderfully! I read plenty of reviews and followed the advice of others. This was less difficult than I thought and I will never again eat canned cinnamon rollls when I can make homemade!!

I've place all the ingredients in the machine pan in this order: warm milk, room temp eggs, melted margarine, salt, flour, sugar, yeast. I select dough cycle, but my machine doesn't mix it all together. It mixes the bottom, but hardly even moves the top. It seems to me that the wet to dry ingredients are way out of proportion.

Thank you; these are fantastic!  With the use of a bread machine, these are way too easy:)  I used whole-wheat flour and yogurt instead of cream cheese, and these were still just great!

Love the fact that I can use my bread machine to make this incredible dough!!!!!!  I substituted Splends for the white sugar and Splenda brown sugar Blend for the brown sugar, otherwise followed the recipe as written.    These taste JUST LIKE the cinnamon rolls at Cinnabon!  I won't be paying those high prices anymore, AND I will be saving calories too!!!!!  Thanks AR !!!!

I just made them.

They came out, very VERY sweet so I would suggest reducing the sugar by half in the cinnamon mix and the frosting. 

But I divided mine on 8 rolls instead of 12, the dought might not have puffed like it was supposed to.

But they were still delicious :) will make them again sometime for sure!

I've made these twice now. The first time I made them I used regular flour and they were heavy but good. The second time I made them I used the bread flour and they turned out better than the first time. Everyone who tries them loves them.

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls from scratch and they turned out perfectly! I don't have a bread machine so I used the 7oz yeast packet instead of bread machine yeast and took the advice of several reviews and dissolved the sugar in the warm milk and then added the yeast, waited several minutes, then added the rest. I used a glass 9X13 and will say they came out huge! They could have cooked a little longer or as my husband suggested make them a little smaller because the center of a few was slightly doughy but awesome. I used the buttercream icing recipe from this site as my staple icing on everything. Will make them MANY times again. Thanks!!

I've never had a Cinnabon, so I can't compare, but these cinnamon rolls were the best I ever had! I was scared because I've never made any recipe with yeast that wasn't disgusting, but these came out perfect making the dough in my new bread machine. The only issue I had was telling the temperature of the milk without a thermometer. I tested it against my wrist, figuring that if I'm 98.6 degrees, 110 would feel a bit warmer. I guess I wasn't far off! I was afraid to use the full amount of cinnamon, so I decreased it a little, but the full amount would have been fine. I mixed the melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon all together before spreading on the dough. It was difficult to spread, but I didn't have the problem of the filling running out during baking. This definitely is neither a fast nor easy recipe, but the result is totally worth it.

Have made these at least 5 times (using reviewer ANDYTAMI's no-bread-machine tips), and they came out beautifully each time.  The dough is gorgeous and soft, and rises wonderfully.  They really do taste just like Cinnabon's buns.  Amazing.

Wow, I was extremely sceptical while I was making this because it seemed that my bread machine didn't mix the ingredients properly. I took it out of the machine before the first rise and added more milk and kneaded it to try to mix the ingredients in better. I put it back in and noticed that it really didn't rise much which made me even more convinced it was going to turn out horrible. I was about to take the dough and toss it to start a new batch but decided not to. So GLAD I didn't. They were delicious! Super soft  and chewy with good airyness to the dough. My last attempt at cinnamon rolls was TERRIBLE. So terrible I took one bite and threw the rest out. This was the exact opposite. I did also flip them  over after baking. When I was rolling out the dough it was very elastic which made it somewhat hard to roll it out enough to use all the cinnamon sugar. The only thing I will do differently next time is to check on the dough during the mixing and use all the cinnamon mixture. Definetely a keeper recipe!

These are delicious.  The best homemade cinnamon roll I've ever made or had.  Made for the first time New Year's Day and have made them two more times in the past three weeks.  I was running out of margarine and subbed shortening for the dough and it turned out fine.

Very tasty.  I had to let them raise for over an hour.  The frosting is delicious.  I baked them as instructed 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  Some of the centers could have used additional time.  Next time I will do as someone else suggested and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.

Followed the recipie exactly and these were terrific.
I am intrigued by those who premade them and put them in the fridge until they needed to be baked the next day.  Will definately try that to take to the cottage and feed the masses :)

wow.  my bread maker's dough cycle apparently doesn't mix the ingredients, just pretends to, I used half whole wheat b/c I ran out of white, I only had 1c of pow sugar, and these were still ammaaaaazing.  I actually liked the depth that the whole wheat added.  I was expecting them to be dense, but the texture was still really good.  I think I'm going to stick with the whole wheat version for future batches. Only 1c of sug in the icing turned out to be a good thing.  I was going to supplement with granulated to taste, but after adding the pow, it didn't need anymore.  These also reheat very well. (in the toaster oven, don't think the microwave would do very well)

I am famous among family for these cinnamon rolls.  This recipe nails the taste, texture and appearance of a true "Cinnabon" roll.  Imperative to use brown sugar and lots of high quality cinnamon.  I use my rolling pin to roll over and further imbed the brown sugar and cinnamon into the dough before I roll it up.  Beautiful when rolled up tight.  I have made these to this stage and then frozen.  I put them in my refrigerator overnight to thaw and out on the counter about an hour before baking.  GREAT!!!

This recipe is absolutely amazing, it's easy to make! The cinnamon rolls rise so well and once cooked they come out nice and big! And the icing is to die for, think I'll use just the icing recipe just for other things too!

First attempt at making cinnamon buns and they came out perfectly! I did it without a bread machine as per ANDYTAMI and also doubled the recipe. So good except now that I know how much sugar and butter are in cinnamon buns I feel even more guilty about eating them. Even so I will be making these again often!

this is an excellent recipe! I added 3/4 cup raisins and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts to the cinnamon mixture, getting ready to make my next batch and thinking of mixing orange marmalade with cream cheese frosting for a little twang. thank you for such a wonderful treat!

This is one of the most deserving 5-star recipes on this site.  I would pay good money for these in an upscale bakery... heck, I would pay good money for these in ANY bakery.

Made these for Christmas morning, they were a huge hit.  I used some of the tips from other reviews.  I did not use a bread machine instead I kneaded the dough together turned the oven to 200 degrees and turned off to proof the dough and I also followed the tip to put the cinnamon rolls in a pan and in the fridge overnight to just bake the next morning.  I put them in a cold oven turned to 350 for 20 minutes and they turned out great.  Read the reviews there some great ideas in there.

I've made these twice now and I guess it's time to add my own praise to the 4500+ positive reviews!  

These are the ultimate cinnamon roll!  Great texture, great size, perfect amount of sweetness, and really?  Is there anything better than a fresh from the oven, homemade cinnamon roll?!  

I did adapt this recipe to be made using a KitchenAid mixer as I don't have a bread machine.  It's not hard at all to do it without a bread machine.  

I made these up to the baking point on Christmas Eve and we baked them off and ate them on Christmas morning.  After putting the rolls in the pan I covered them with plastic wrap and put them in the fridge.  I pulled them out and set them on the counter 30mins-1hr before I wanted to bake them and then baked them for 20-25mins at 350 (the first time I made these I baked for 15mins at 400 as the recipe calls for and they didn't bake evenly, definitely go with the lower temp!  I did take 1/2 a star away for this as my rolls were under baked in the middle the first time I made them because of this.).  

The only other change I made was to change the proportions of the cream cheese frosting a bit.  The first time I made the rolls I made the frosting as written and didn't love it.  I much preferred  the frosting I made this time (I took another 1/2 a star off because of this) where I used 4oz of cream cheese rather than 3oz.  

And don't forget to flip the pan over after it comes out!  Other than those two things this recipe is perfection!

Delicious! I made these in my bread machine, putting in all the liquid ingredients first and then layering the dry, yeast last. It worked great. I prepared the rolls and put them in 2 8" square pans as another reviewer suggested. Then I put covered them and put them in the fridge overnight. The next morning I cooked them as directed. Unfortunately, thought they browned, they were all raw on the sides that touched. I had to separate them (3 to a pan instead of 6) and bake them some more. They came out okay. The second time I tried this, I only put 4 in the square pans and when I pulled them out of the fridge I put them in a cold oven then set it for 350, then set the timer for 25 min. I added 2 more min. just to be sure and they turned out great this time.  So... these are wonderful cinnamon buns but I recommend you leave adequate space in your pan for them to bake properly and adjust the heat and cooking time if you will be refrigerating them before baking.

I made these without a bread machine following ANDYTAMI's instructions. On the first try I couldn't get the yeast to proof in just the warm milk so I ditched that. Second try I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the warm milk and we were in business. I added the other 1/4 of sugar in with the eggs, butter etc... God are these good! The cream cheese frosting just puts them over the top. Making these again for the New Years brunch menu for sure.

These are wonderful & amazing. There are a few problems I've found with the recipes for breadmakers.

You have to use bread machine yeast. The other one being that the recipe comes out great IF you bring the liquids used (water, milk or whatever) to the temperature recommended in the yeast bottle instead of what the recipe calls for. I think between 120°F -130°F the bread maker's yeast gets activated otherwise there won't be the required heat to make things rise. Also if your butter is a bit on the cold, it will bring the temp of the liquids down if a bit too high hot & at the same time get warmed up.

That's just my machine though. It doesn't preheat the ingredients. 

I didn't have the cream cheese & my frosting was a bit too buttery but it was still awesome. The best part is that I saved like $12 & I had all the ingredients in my pantry & they didn't have that bitter taste that all the frozen pastries & dough have (*cough Pillsbury cough*).

I am never buying cinnamon rolls at the store again. Unless I'm at the mall & there's a stand without a line...

This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe and it turned out really, really good this time.  I did something different and took some other reviewers suggestions and added a box of vanilla instant pudding.  That made it.  The first time I didn't think it was like it at all, but the pudding made a huge difference.  I baked it at a lower temp, 350, for 20 mins b/c the last time they got too crispy on top at 400 and dried out.  Only reason I rated it a 4 was b/c of the changes.

WOW, these are AMAZING!!! The first time I made these true to recipe. The next times, I've added chopped pecans after the sugar/cinnamon mix before rolling it up. If you like pecans, you may want to try this addition.

These rolls were really good!  Next time I will make less icing though as it was very sweet.  Also, melted 1/3 cup butter as instructed and brushed the dough with it before rolling.  It was too much butter as I only did a few brushes and that was plenty.  I will melt less next time so as not to waste the butter in the future.  Followed everything else as written and the rolls were a hit.

I make these exactly as instructed.  No changes.  I've made them 3 times and each time they come out perfect.  They TRULY taste like Cinnabon.  No need to go out and buy them anymore.  AND if you don't have one near you, no worries, you can have your own cinnabon in your own kitchen! Thank you for a stellar recipe!! :)  Next time I may try half orange extract and half vanilla to make an orange flavored icing, but the vanilla is perfect!

Delicious! (updated) Make this recipe often. The only changes are vanilla in the cinnamon/sugar mixture and in the dough. And I make it by hand instead of in the mixer. Very very addictive and oh-so-good!

This is a great cinnamon roll recipe!  I doubled the recipe and made them pretty big.  They are extremely gooey inside and pretty darn close to a Cinnabon.  I did add more filling (brown sugar and cinnamon) then called for.  I add and extra cup of brown sugar, and an extra T of cinnamon.  I think really packing the filling in there helps the filling stay in the roll instead of running out.  I am forever indebted to you Marsha Fernandez.  I love this recipe.

I make this without a machine and I double the filling. Phil's co-workers at Woodbridge RAVED about these rolls! They would request them for breakfast several times, sometimes two times a week (If his boss had it his way he'd have me make them everyday)! I would make two pans just for them (and never see leftovers) and a half pan extra just so the kids and I would be able to eat some too lol. Many have asked me for the recipe! Absolutely the best cinnamon roll I have EVER had. I will NEVER buy them from the store again! Thanks for sharing this!!!

They turned out amazing! Put them in the fridge over night and popped them in a cold oven, turned on to 350, and baked 30 minutes. I flipped them over after they got out and put the icing on. Might make a little more icing next time. Everyone loved them!

I think this is a great cinnabon clone recipe but I do recommend mixing the cinnamon,butter and brown sugar together before spreading on the dough like another poster suggested. I also refrigerated mine overnight and baked it in the morning. Like another poster suggested I didn't set it out to rise I just put it in a cold oven at 350 and baked for 25 min. They turned out great. This will be my go to recipe for now on.

Not quite a cinnabon, but close enough that I will make these instead of spending $5 for a roll at the airport. In response to many people's comments about the filling running out. I actually combined the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter together so it made a paste. Then I spread the paste over the dough. This kept everything inside the roll for the most part and I didn't have to add any extra ingredient to the filling.

OMG! I have never made cinnamon rolls before and these were so easy and soooo yummy! I didnt have a bread machine because I was on vacation so I followed the 1st reviewer's directions and they worked perfectly. I also added some shopped walnuts to the brown sugar mix.

These are WONDERFUL!! I put pecans in with the cinnamon and brown sugar. Also, instead of making a cream cheese frosting, I decided to stir together brown sugar, butter, and heavy cream, which made a delicious syrup to put on top. This has become a family favorite.

This is a pretty standard recipe.  I would say in response to Jennifer Woodward's post about 'flipping the pan' as soon as they are done baking...  adding a little bit of flour to the filling also alleviates the runniness and helps the cinnamon and sugar stick to the inside of the rolls.  Unfortunately, I don't have an exact measurement, I just eyeball it by dusting the surface through a fine sifter.

Made these this morning and they were fantastic.  Upon the suggestion of others I made the rolls last night and refrigerated them, put them in a cold oven set to 350 degrees and baked for 30 minutes.  I inverted them onto a plate right away to let the filling drip back in, frosted while warm, and they were fantastic.  It is a great option for a morning with company because it only takes 30 minutes to bake in the morning and you can spend less time in the kitchen and more time with your guests.  My neighbor even came over this morning to check them out when he smelled the cinnamon coming from the kitchen!  I was actually out of vanilla so I used 1/2 tsp of hazelnut rum and that worked out fantastic.  It added a little nutty flavor to the frosting.  I know I will be prepping these again the night before Thanksgiving to bake up Thanksgiving morning when I have a house full of people to feed!

These always turn out really great! I'm not a huge cinnamon bun fan, but I like how these stay really moist and slightly gooey. Don't skip the icing recipe, either - it's quite literally the icing on the bun. 

I guess I should also note that I'm an abysmal baker, so I'm always amazed that these turn out so wonderfully. I follow the instructions exactly, and so far I haven't produced any lumps of coal.

Great recipe! I don't have a bread-maker so I make it like all other bread recipes, and it comes out melt-in-your-mouth, light and fluffy as air. Have made repeatedly and they're usually great. If you make a day ahead and chill through the 2nd rise, it's kind of hit or miss - sometimes they rise and sometimes they don't, and even when they do rise they're not as fluffy. The icing is very very good also!!!!

I can only describe this recipe as AMAZING!  I thought I loved the pre-made cinnamon rolls you just pull apart and bake, but these are tons better than anything I can find at the store and are so easy to make.

Not sure if it's a clone but it was pretty good.  I had a hard time keeping the stuffing in the rolled dough (my butter was melted) so next time I'll try a different method.

Certainly doesnt need another review, but as an inexperienced cinnamon roll maker, I thought I would add that these are wonderful!  They turned out great.  I followed the recipe as written.  I have never had a cinnabon so I can't say how it compares, but these are delicious!

These are awesome! Only 4 stars because it's not really the "clone of a cinnabon" but they turned out great! I used butter in the dough instead of margarine b/c I didn't have any and it didn't seem to make any difference - but I'll give margarine a whirl next time (because I'll definitely be making them again). Also, I think I'll cook for 2-3 minutes less next time (in a glass pan). Great recipe!

I made these rolls the other day for my family, and OMG they absolutely loved them. Keep in mind I have never made any type of homemade bread at all and I did this entire recipe by myself. I agree with some of the other reviews that they aren't quite like a "cinnabon", but who care's the are yummy. I will be making these again very soon.

I so want to enjoy these.  Frosting was great!  I made them according to directions and was a bit scared because it was the consistancy of playdough. I let it rest, put sugar and cinnamon on, rolled and cut, which was easier than another recipe I tried.  I let them rise for as long as was told, and they did not rise at all.  While they still tasted very good when all was done, they were quite dense.  Am I doing something wrong or would anyone have a recipe for a cinnamon roll that is lighter?

Excellent recipe! I used all-purpose flour because it was all I had on hand.  The texture was great - not too bread-like.  The cooking time was off for me - It took a little over 20 minutes in a glass pan.  I did not see the need to double the icing.  I was able to generously spoon a large dollop of delicious icing on top of each bun.

These are awesome - my kids say they are the best thing I've ever made.  They are pretty sweet, but if I'm eating a cinnamon bun I want sweet.  I don't have a bread maker so I combined a lot of the suggestions for those of us without that appliance.  They turned out great.  I also made them the night before and baked them in the morning - perfect!

I followed the mixer directions, didn't change a thing in the recipe and they were AWESOME!!  I followed the advice to flip the pan, which I kept flipped for 15-20 minutes.

After I rolled it all up, I lengthened the roll to about 26 inches just by gently stretching then cut into 16 portions which fit perfectly in the 9x13 pan.

I doubled the icing and there was still half left after a generous topping! 

Next time I will experiment by adding a bit more butter when rolled out and 50% more sugar/cinnamon filling.

Overall, this is a keeper!

So yummy! They ARE a little harder than the 'real' things, but then again, I imagine that's the lack of science-project-type ingredients, so I can forgive that. Every time I make these, people absolutely swoon over them. And yes, I definitely make sure to use both margarine and butter where called for, and a little grated orange zest in the icing takes it to another level altogether!. This recipe is now my go-to recipe for special breakfasts (birthdays, Christmas, etc) because I make it all in advance up to the rising stage, then cover in Saran Wrap / cling film and leave in the fridge overnight. Whether taken out for half an hour before baking or put straight into the oven as it warms up, they are fantastic. I can't say enough how yummy these are!

Excellent Cinnamon rolls. Will definately use this one again. Followed the recipe except to add raisins and a pinch of cloves to the filling. I baked 4 rolls right away, refrigerated 4 rolls overnight to bake the next morning, and froze four rolls to bake a few days later. The first 4 rolls came out great, even without icing. The overnight rolls came out even better, I guess the filling had time to really 'gel' together. The refrigerated batch didn't rise as well as the first batch, and after 30 min. out on the counter without rising I gave in and proofed them in the oven (still did not rise as much as first batch). Topped these with the icing and toasted pecans. Excellent even thought they were smaller than the first batch. The frozen batch I thawed overnight in the fridge and then proofed the next morning. Didn't rise as well as either previous batch and when baked the dough was a little tougher than the other batches, but still very good.

Good cinnamon roles...not Cinnabon, but just as good (and a little bigger) than the ones you buy in a can and bake. Maybe it was my oven, but 400 degrees at 15 minutes made mine way too dark, teetering on overdone. For the next batch, I turned the oven down to 375, baked them for 11 minutes and they came out perfect. It was a fun project with our kids, but next time I'll buy the ones in a can. Less mess!

Oh my goodness, these are to die for! Followed the recipe exactly. The dough was perfect and lovely out of the bread machine (I have a 1.5 lb. machine). This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls, and the dough was very easy to work with. No problems whatsoever, and mine were done in just under 15 minutes. Can't wait to bring a batch to share with friends! Thank you so much!

Love this recipe! I don't have a bread machine, so I followed others instructions to make without one and they turned out fabulous. I also used the recommendation of making them the night before and refridgerating them. This worked perfectly! Thank you!

Wow! This is the best.   I've always loved Cinnabon and would stop by their shop whenever at the mall or airport.  But no more.   These taste exactly like he name-brand.  They even taste better than the boxed home version that you can purchase from the grocery store.   I made two unintentionally variations.  I used shorten instead of margarine.  And I did not have enough bread flour (only 1 cup) and used a 3 1/2 cups of All purpose flour.   I used a bread machine to process the dough. They turned out prefect.  My teenage nephews were visiting at the time so I only ended up getting 1/2 of one bun.   What they didn't eat they took when they left.  I'm just learning how to cook and found this recipe very easy to make and the directions simple to follow.  Thank you so much for posting.

This was a great recipe.  My husband and kids loved it.  I followed the recipe for the dough exactly except for the margarine.  I only use butter.   For the icing, I doubled it based on some reviews.  I did not need to use all of it though.  I think next time I will increase by about 50% instead.  I baked it at 400 degrees as directed, and it came out perfectly because I had it on the bottom rack. They did not overbrown at all.  In fact, I think next time I may let it bake a few minutes longer to get them a little more golden.  With a bread maker, there was no work.  The dough was easy to roll out, the filling stayed perfectly, so easy... I cannot believe I never tried cinnamom rolls before today!

Awesome recipe! I'm a novice baker and this recipe comes out really really good. I followed others' suggestion by baking it at 350F for about 20 minutes. The cinnamon rolls have good texture and they're delicious. Thank you so much for the recipe!

"These are to die for" are my husband's words.
I made them according to the recipe except I do not have a bread machine so I made them by hand.
I also didn't have cream cheese on hand so I just used confectioner's icing recipe. (powdered sugar/milk/vanilla)
Awesome recipe!

I made these this evening... I dont have a bread machine so i did it the old fashioned way... The dough turned out beautiful, it rose as it should of in about 1.5 hrs.  I made these as written, except for i took about a half a stick of butter and spread it on the the dough, then added the cinnamon sugar mixture, i also added about a 3rd of a stick of butter to that... They turned out beautiful, next time i will use makara cinnamon and see how that turns out.... Bravo on this recipe...

This tastes exactly like a Cinnabon. I was worried that it would be too complex, but it wasn't hard at all. I made the dough by hand (following a previous reviewers instructions), but otherwise followed this recipe exactly. 
I'm going to be making this all the time... WOW.

OMG! WOW!  I have tried and tried different recipes, but this one was great!  My husband is an avid "Cinnaboneer" and he gives this recipe 5 stars!  Had to double the icing recipe- thats what literaly tops it off.  Thanks for submitting!  I loved that others had reviewed the recipe and gave hints on how to make this recipe without a bread maker.

Bit average for me. My husband seemed to get a quick addition to them. Possibly because he was so hungary by the time they arrived (not a quick recipe). I found them yummy but a bit ordinary considering the amount of sugar and fatty stuff that went into them. I do make quite a few breadish things though, so maybe just normal to me. Would prefer more of a doughnut texture.

Made this today using the stand mixer (I don't have a bread machine), had to add a little extra flour to get right consistency, and let it rise each time in my food dehydrater!  Was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and it turned out amazing!  My husband has been begging for cinnamon rolls since we got married five years ago, and he was very very satisfied!

Although I wish I could go back to my ignorance of how much butter went into these! :)

I followed the recipe as written and they are fantastic! I tried combining the ingredients for the filling and then spreading it on the dough, but it is far easier to follow the recipe directions. Easy and delicious.

I made these during the blizzard in February.  This is an incredible recipe.  Everyone loved them.  I didn't have bread flour so I used AP and they turned out just perfect.  We loved them and will make again!

This is so cliche but I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I honestly didn't believe it would be good enough.  I love Cinnabon.  They just are that good.  I made all 12 cinnamon buns in one 9x13 pan.  Then I froze 6 of them, two at a time in storage containers.  They were fabulous that morning of course.  But what I was really surprised at was how good they were when we heated the frozen ones.  They tasted more like the real thing than the fresh ones!  So taste alone make these fabulous.  They also were easier to make than I thought.  I mixed them in my bread machine and then rolled the dough out and shaped them the night before.  After taking them out to come to room temperature in the morning, the rose and baked beautifully in the oven.

Taste was good but I had a problem with the dough itself. Didn't rise up for me the way it should. May easily been an error on my part.

This recipe was a bit underwhelming considering all the rave reviews, but it was pretty decent.  The bread itself is no different from my family's Finnish pulla recipe, except for using a bread machine.  I had to make many alterations due to a) not having a bread machine; and b) living at 8600' in a country where there's no such thing as "bread flour" and "all-purpose flour" is just cheap, bleached stuff.  The yeast did NOT rise at all directly in the warm milk, in fact it clumped into a hard cake.  Three times, and two separate batches of yeast.  To fix this, I proofed the yeast in 1/2 c of water with sugar, then added another half cup of warm milk.  For some reason, 4 1/2 cups of flour wasn't nearly enough.  To get the dough workable, I needed 6 cups, then another 1 or 2 to knead for 10 min.  Finally, I added cardamom (to give it the pulla flavour).  As for baking, I know this is entirely due to the altitude, but 400 degrees for 15 min left the tops dark and the middles raw, so next time, it'll be 375 or lower for 20 min.  And maybe making smaller rolls (more like the cinnabon minis).  Flavour-wise, 5 stars!  Ease of altering and making at altitude, 3 stars but I'm sure this would be an entirely different story if I had been able to make it exactly as written.

I haven't had a Cinnabon in probably 10 years, so I can't say whether this is a clone, however, I was very happy with this recipe!  I left them a little too long and they got a little too dark on the bottom for my taste (not a fan of the slightly burnt sugar flavor), but the rest of the roll was still soft and gooey and perfect!  They are best the first day, but even a few days later, if you zap them in the microwave, they're great.

This has been my go-to recipe for a few years now, and I'm just getting around to reviewing it!  I follow the freezing instructions included in the reviews and give them every year at Christmastime! They're always a HIT! 

One addition: With the frosting, I like to freeze it in "packets." I evenly space spoonfuls on a piece of freezer Press & Seal wrap. Then top with another piece and seal around the frosting. Freeze it and you have packets of frosting you can cut apart and use anytime! Great if you freeze the rolls individually!  

Awesome recipe and I will continue to make and give them year after year!

These cinnamon rolls are delicious and easy to make.  They do take some time to prepare but most of the time is in rising and baking.  I made them without a bread maker.

Excellent!  I used regular flour and added a butterscotch pudding mix to the dry ingredients.  I made the rolls and stored in refrigerator over night and they turned out just as good.  I also added more sugar to the frosting.

OH MY GOODNESS - these are SO good!  I made them with my kids - it was so much fun!  I would just be sure that the middles are completely done before you take them out - I should have cooked mine for more like 25 minutes.. 

YUMM!

Awesome! I used the make without bread machine method of dissolving about 2 and 1/4 tsp of active dry yeast in the warm milk before adding all the other ingredients in my kitchenaid. after kneaded well with the dough hook i covered it and put it in the 200degree turned off oven for a hour. I then turned on to a floured mat and covered for another 10mins. Then rolled it out as instructed in the directions.followed the ingredients for the roll perfectly! I placed them in the baking dish on parchment paper and sprayed it for good measure. Placed it in the fridge overnight and left it covered with a towel on the oven in the morning while it preheated to 350. Baked for about 25 mins I would say. On the frosting I used 4oz's of cream cheese because thats what I had left over from another recipe and used the same amount sugar and other ingredients. I did turn it out on a baking sheet lined with tinfoil for easy clean up and dripped all of the goodness on top of it. I then used a rubber spatula to spread the cream cheese over the top. So Yummy!

My only cinnamon roll recipe.  Thank you.  One little addition that I make is before they go in the oven I pour about 1/4 cup of half and half over the rolls and drizzle with corn syrup and invert as soon as they come out of the oven, this keeps them soft and gooey for longer!

Delicious! Next time, I think I will decrease either the amount of cinnamon in the rolls or the amount of cream cheese in the icing...I thought those two flavors were competing slightly, but that could be just a personal preference. I probably would give it 4- 1/2 stars if I could.

Excellent recipe...best I've ever made. I used all purpose flour because I was out of bread flour and 3 tsp yeast and the dough was perfect. I would use more brown sugar/cinnamon/butter next time to make it more oozy. Doesn't need the icing! Just flip them upside down when they come out of the oven and baste them with butter...yummy!

delicious and easy!! I highly recommend making the night before and baking in the morning. Saves time, and they still rise perfectly in the oven. Put them in a cold oven and turn it on. They rise during the preheat phase. Bake closer to 30 minutes.

These rolls tasted great and were easy to make! I had to knock a star off as I think the cooking directions may need altered a bit. I wasn't able to get the center cooked enough without the top becoming too brown. Next time I think I will cook at a lower temperature for longer time as others have suggested.

These were exceptional.  They certainly do take a while but it's well worth it.  I will definitely hang on to this recipe.  I followed the ingredients and recipe exactly and can't think of a thing that could be improved.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Tasted just like a Cinnabon! Made these the night before and then just popped them in the oven in the morning. Not the healthiest breakfast but so delicious!

Amazing! I used my breadmaker to make dough and it came out fantastic. It was very easy to work with. I recommend making the filling as a paste as others suggested. I made them in the evening, stuck them in the fridge and baked them the next morning. They were perfect!

These rolls are as close to a Cinnabon can be! The brown sugar and cinnamon make the filling nice and gooey. I followed the recipe's ingredients list exactly, but not the directions. I used my Kitchenaid to mix and pre-knead the dough, then kneaded it by hand and let it rise until doubled. Filled and sliced and put into pan in the fridge until next morning; left at room temp about 30 mins and then baked. The rolls came out great; definitely made for a great breakfast and not much work in the morning. Thanks, Marsha!

They tasted great. I didn't use a bread machine, I just kneaded it with my hands a bit. Be careful about the cooking time, if you cook it even a few minutes too long, the rolls start to get hard, and not as good.

Wasn't sure about how much filling to put in because some reviewers said to half it and some doubled it.  I just did the filling as originally written (beat them with my paddle and spread on dough with offset spatula) and everyone at work raved about it.  They said it was better than a cinnabon.  Boss said he liked the texture of the dough (used AP flour and 1 tsp vanilla).  One woman went to some bakery that Oprah had rated Best Cinnamon Roll and said mine were better!  She was still talking about them the next day!  I doubled the icing but didn't use all of the sugar.  Will definitely make again.

This is one of those recipes that you automatically expect to be a big hit. I must say that this was a big miss for us. Too wet, too sweet, too gooey. I guess everyone else likes their cinnamon rolls different than we do. This won't be a repeat in our house.

These were so easy and turned out perfect!  I made in the bread machine as stated. Per other reviewers I mixed the cinnamon and sugar together with the butter to form a spreadable paste.  After cutting I let rise for about an hour and then covered with buttered plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator until the next morning.  I took out about 30 minutes before baking and baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  They turned out perfect! Will definitely be making again.

Very disappointing!  I love cinnabon and this is definately not a clone.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Didn't rise very much (and my oven has a proof setting so I know that wasn't me and yeast was tested prior to using and is fine) too much flour and way too much sugar in the filling, very very sweet.  Dough too dense and even tough.  I've made many sweet rolls and have many many cinnabon in my life and these are nothing like them at all.  If you want good cinnamon rolls just make a sweet dough, roll out and spread with butter sprinkle with cinnamon & sugar, rise, bake and put icing on top don't bother with this recipe.

My very first time making cinnamon buns, and these were amazing and very easy to make. I don't have a bread maker so followed other users tips as to how to make without. Thanks for the recipe!

These are excellent. very 'doughy' if that is what you like, which we do...I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to knead the dough, it was so easy. My family loved these rolls. I honestly do not think they are 'like' Cinnabon to a "T", but they are delicious in their own right. The frosting IMO was not what I expected, but it could have been my own mistake, don't get me wrong, it was still yummy, I just felt it was missing something I cannot put my finger on.  Over all, a really good cinnamon roll. Oh yeah, I left it in my oven over night to rise, and I got a great sized cinnamon roll for baking. I was planning on turning them over after baking (as other reviewers advised), so as to utilize the butter/sugar drippings to their best, but my husband beat me to getting these puppies out of the oven, and the kids cut into them right then and there. There was NO complaining from them about the gooey goodness ending up at the bottom of the pan...I don't think they even noticed. These are at their prime straight from the oven....but the next day they still were gloriously gooey and tender, not dry like I expected.

Very good- better even still the next day. The frosting was... a little too cream-cheesy... it's why I didn't give it 5*'s. It needs tweaking. If you're lucky enough to have some left the next morning, slice in half, butter and grill on a hot pan for instant yumminess. If you have a lot left over, wrap individually in saran wrap- freeze and nuke for a quick breakfast treat.

These are the best cinnamon rolls!  I just started baking with yeast and it was much easier than I thought.  I saw perfectly sized cinnamon rolls at Starbucks and decided to try baking these in a cupcake pan with the paper liners.  They came out perfect!  I just rolled the cinnamon buns until they were a little narrower than the hole in the cupcake pan and just a bit taller.  They are so yummy that they don't even need frosting.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I have baked these dozens of times in both the US and UK, with excellent results every time. I've shared them with loads of people. Everyone agrees they are fantastic! It's important to roll the dough around the cinnamon filling as tightly as you can. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My "old" cinnamon roll recipe was great the day they were baked - but would need to be microwaved the next day - or they were hard.  This cinnamon roll...OMG!!!  Delicious the day it was baked - delicious the second day.  I will never know how they are on the third day...they won't make it that long!  I made mine without a bread machine.

I thought it tasted like a cinnabon! Very good. I flipped the rolls onto a foil-lned cookie sheet immediately after baking to keep the brown sugar filling on the rolls. Worked great. I'll be keeping this recipe around for sure!

This is a no fail winner!  I live in Houston and they rise beautifully out on the patio(covered of course) I also sprinkle a quarter cup of granulated sugar and melt 1/4 cup of butter in the bottom of the pan before I set the rolls in the pan.  I add an extra 1/4 cup granulated sugar with the brown sugar(I like them sweet!) I too double the frosting, and use a bit more cream cheese then called for...

Perfect!  Remember to flip the rolls upside down after they come out of the oven.  That makes the filling redistribute throughout the rolls.  Thanks for sharing a fabulous recipe!

i just pulled a batch of these out of the oven a little bit ago---oh my goodness! they are so yummy! my husband said they're the best hes ever had. they dont taste exactly like cinnabon, but they are close. i actually like them better, cinnabon is a little too rich for me. i used my breadmaker for the dough and it worked great. i didnt have bread flour so i subbed all purpose. to compensate i added about 1/4 cup more, as one reviewer suggested. they are really easy to make, but the dough process takes a long time, so keep that in mind! i will definetly be making these again. thank you for this amazing recipe!

Beyond delicious!!!!!  Maybe very slightly dry, but EXTREMELY good.  I put walnuts in the inside along with the cin/sugar mixture, and that really enhanced the flavor.  I did not make this in a bread machine, (don't have one), but just mixed the ingredients like any other yeast bread and it turned out very well.  Will definitely make this again!

These came out great. I did use the bread maker in this recipe. I read in an earlier review about substituting all purpose flour with bread maker flour. I used all purpose flour (because it was all I had) with the exact measurements that the recipe calls for and it came out just fine. I also used all purpose yeast instead of the bread maker yeast. I kind of had some fears about not using bread maker ingredients, but it all came out tasting amazing.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count.  It is so delicious, that some of my friends ask for me to make these rather than buying them a gift on thier birthday.  I don't have a bread machine, so I use the frozen "Bridgford" dough that is sold in a 3 loaf pack in the frezer section of most grocery stores.  I use 2 of the loaves for this recipe.  It tastes amazing and would be great for anyone who either wants to save time, or like me, doesn't have a bread machine.

I tweaked these just a little to make TURTLE CINNAMON ROLLS and added some chocolate chips and pecans when I rolled it up.  In lieu of cream cheese frosting, I topped them with caramel (1/2 cube butter, 2 T Karo Syrup, 1/2 C brown sugar and a dash of salt- all boiled to soft ball stage.  stir in 1/8 t baking soda and 1/4 t vanilla)  SO AMAZING!!!

Hubby was raving after one bite.  These were huge, to the point where they spilled some of the brown sugar in the oven.  Also, in the convection oven they browned too fast and were a little doughy in the middle.  Next time I'm making 18 from the same quantity of dough and baking them in three round pans.  These are a recipe for instant obesity, but sometimes I just don't care.

I just recently bought a breadmaker and this is the first thing I did! It was wonderful!!! So easy to make, and so delicious. I did what some people suggested , which was to mix the butter, the cinnamon and the sugar together and then spreading it in the dough. It didnt come out quite right though, the sugar didn't exactly melt, it kinda crystalized. It still tasted great though. Anyway, am not sure if I should have melted the butter or just softened itand then mix it with the sugar...any suggestions?

Best ever! Tasted better than Cinnabon! I made it in my Kitchenaid stand mixer. Paddled the liquids together and then let the dough hook do the rest of the work after adding all-purpose flour, allowing it to knead about 5 minutes. Made them bite size in a mini cupcake pan. Easy and will absolutely make again!

At first I was afraid the cinnamon was going to be over powering since it uses so much in the filling.  It wasn't at all.  All the flavors were in perfect balance with one another.  This was also a cinch to make.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

THE BEST! I cut the sugar from 1/2 to 1/3 and it was perfect. I only used 1/2 of the cinnamon and sugar mix. The topping was amazing!

Yummy! I made a mistake and mixed the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together instead of psreading the butter on and then sprinkling the sugar and cinnamon on top. My mistake turned out to be a good thing. I had to work the mixture really well to get it to spread over the dough, but I think it turned out much nicer this way.  It was a nice gooy bun.

I've been making these since I found the recipe about two years ago.  Everyone I have ever made them for has loved them.  They are THE BEST cinnamon rolls!!  The only change I've made to them is in the filling:  I use 1/2 c butter instead of 1/3, 1 1/2 c brown sugar, and 3 tbsp cinnamon.  I usually roll them into a longer skinnier log, so that I get more and smaller rolls.  I've never had any problem with the filling running out.  They are perfect every time.

Only thing different is the cinnamon. They grate the India cinnamon before spreading on the dough. I have seen them doing it.

As I gazed at this rendition of a Cinnabon on my screen, I was transported back to the first time that I succumbed to the original decadent delight.  Perhaps your experience was similar and just as wonderful!  Some years back, I was passing through a local mall and the smell alone just sucked me in.  I hadn't a chance against this sugary "icon of cinnamon indulgence", and was of course completely in awe of the experience.  In marveling at the thought of creating my own, along with a bit of gentle encouragement from my girlfriend, I ventured forth.  Obviously, I had very high expectations of these gooey "Clones", and must say that I was not let down in the least.  As my depth of experience and comfort lies in cooking versus baking, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My girlfriend polished off a lone bun, but I somehow coerced myself into a second after making short work (too short) of my first.  We have three teens in the house, and the eldest (17) sucked down three of them.  Two warm from the oven, and another on the sly once mom went to work.  The buns were off limits to the other two as they had already imbibed in an afternoon junk-food affair at the movies.  I must say that I've yet to find a recipe to be as stand-alone "perfect" as this, and as I conclude I'm hearing the early morning shuffle of the boys through the kitchen, and it occurs to me that I'm unlikely to ever again see the surviving "six in the pan" that I so carefully wrapped up late last night.

Fantastic.  Tips I got from others that worked well: bake at only 350 (for 20-25 min).  Bake in a glass dish lined with buttered parchment.   As soon as you take them out of the oven, flip the pan over so the topping drips back onto the rolls.

These are CINNABOMB'S!!!!  We followed the recipe but made a little more frosting.  They may have a lot of calories but they're worth running around the block a few more times.  Okay, in my case maybe a thousand more times.  I'm starting out a little fluffy.

Absolutely fantastic! These took a while but were worth every second. The only changes I made were replacing one cup of flour with whole wheat and used neufchatel cheese for the icing. They were perfect and I will definitely be making these again.

AWESOME recipe and easy to make.  I did as another baker suggested and made them the night before and put them in the fridge.  By morning they do rise enough to fill out the pan.  I also pass out pans around the holidays for a Christmas morning treat.  They have been a big hit!

These are wonderful!  The time is way too long for us though.  So the night before, we fully made them all the way through letting them rise as if they were about to go in the oven.  Then we put a lid on the 9x13 and put them in the fridge.  Next morning when we got up all we had to do was make the icing and bake them for the 20 minutes (on 375).  This way made breakfast a lot quicker.

I made this and they turned out well.  I followed the instructions exactly but think I may have overcooked them by a minute or two.  They were really good but not great.  I'd rather buy my cinnamon rolls from a reputable bakery and save myself the work, and I love to bake!

Fantastic! I made them in the evening and put them in the fridge overnight. Then I let them sit out for 30 minutes before I put them in the oven. Worked like a charm, they rose both overnight and again before they went in the oven, probably tripled from when I first put them in the pan. I reduced the sugar by about 1/3 and they were still sweet but I might do a little more next time as I like them really sweet.

SOOOO yummy! I've made these more than 10 times and others agree they definitely are CLONES of cinnabuns (if you combine these most common suggestions by reviewers):
1. Cut down sugar in dough to 1/3 cup sugar
2. Cream 1/2 cup SOFTENED butter with brown sugar and cinnamon (1 1/2 tablespoon is plenty and not overwhelming for cinnamon). These ratios will allow a perfectly spreadable mixture for your buns. Use all of it and you will get just enough drippings (see #4)
3. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes to avoid "doughy" buns in the middle.
4. Invert the pan into a pan of the same size and any gooey drippings will drip back into the buns. This works IDEALLY if you line the bottom of your pan with a buttered piece of wax paper.
5. When they are still warm, spread just a bit of the frosting. It will melt and sink into the gaps. When buns cool enough not to melt frosting, add more.
ENJOY!!! They'll still be warm :)

OMG! I just bought a bread maker just for making pizza dough - now I can't stop making dough!!  This recipe is unbelievable - made way more dough than I wanted - should have froze the dough but instead used up all the dough, made the buns a little smaller (about 18), then froze some of the ready made buns - buns and icing (in a separate container) - they freeze really well - warm up in microwave for about 30 seconds and voila!!

Absolutely Scrumptious, but time consuming! If you have an afternoon this is perfect. I made these with SunnyB, pelicangal, Cindy Lepp, and TIE. Perfectly fun afternoon!

Perfect Recipe. I didn't change a thing.  The only thing I messed up by accident but didn't alter the taste of it at all was that I mixed together the softened butter and the cinnamon sugar because I didn't read ahead.  Also, once my cinnamon buns rose, I put them in the fridge overnight and popped them in the oven the next morning for an easy weekend breakfast. If you do this, don't forget to let them sit out for about 20 minutes first.  Picture perfect, huge, delicious cinnamon buns. I heart this recipe.

Delicious! And I even made them with ALL Whole Wheat Flour...My husband who hates whole wheat anything...loved them.:) I just substituted the exact amount of bread flour with whole wheat and added 1/3 cup of natural apple sauce to moisten. I do not have a bread machine so I followed dough hook instructions per other reviews. I did also double the icing recipe...it was a lot, but I love the icing...the little bit left over I used for dipping fruit.

GREAT recipe!  Really enjoyed making these with my 5-year-old daughter, who helped me add the ingredients to the bread machine, rolled out the dough, sprinkled on the sugar/cinnamon, helped me roll up the sprinkled dough, and placed the pieces in the pan (with help!).  These cinnamon rolls may be the best I've ever tasted.

If you follow the directions, they'll turn out fabulously! I, like many others, didn't use a breadmaker. These are as good or (and in my opinion) better than the real thing. It's hard to eat just one!

SOOOO GOOD!!! I did add more filling and a bit more frosting than called for. This is the first yeast dough that has actually worked well for me in a cinnamon roll recipe. Highly recommended!

This is the most amazing tasting cinnamon roll I have ever tasted! The only thing I would change next time is to flip the rolls out onto a cookie sheet and skip the salt in the frosting. Otherwise, an outstanding recipe! It was added to my recipe book!

This is the best things I've ever made since peanut butter and jelly sandwiches! The dough was perfect! A bit heavy, but duuuh, they're cinnamon rolls! They're supposed to be heavy! I made them without using a bread machine and they turned out just fine. I let the dough rise in a warmed up oven for about 2 hours and it went hulkish! Seriously people, it's the best!

I had never made cinnamon rolls before, but with all the rave reviews of this recipe, I had to try it!  They tasted great, but I don't think I cooked them long enough, as the middle of the pan of rolls sank after taking them out of the oven.  I didn't put them back into the oven, we just gobbled them up anyway... but next time I make them I'll remember to stick them with a toothpick to make sure they're done.  These still get 5 stars because the issue I had was my own fault, not the recipe or the taste.  Enjoy!  Amazing!

I just baked this recipe with a twist: i added 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/3 c of raisins and 2 tsp of cinnamon all in the dough and selected the light white bread setting....it came out delicious, soft, and the house smelled like a real home....my kids and husband loved it.

I have made this recipe several times over the past year and everyone in my family and extended family absolutely loves them. I do not have a bread machine so I make them by hand as others have mentioned. I also use a 50-50 mixture of white and whole wheat flour.   The recipe does make 12 huge rolls - too big for me. What I do now is roll the dough out as directed in a 16X21 inch rectangle. After adding the filling, I cut the dough in half lengthwise and roll two long logs, one towards me and the other away from me. I cut each log into 12 rolls and set 9 of them in a 9X9 pan and 15 of them in a 9X13 pan. I raise and bake as further directed in the recipe. These rolls are a better serving size for my diet and still so yummy!

Just finished making these, and they turned out PERFECT! The only changes I made were adding less butter (watching my diet) I used about 1 stick of butter total. When rolling them up, instead of putting the butter on the dough first; I mixed the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together and spread it on the dough. This worked out WONDERFUL. I ended up almost tripling the icing on accident (I didn't realize the recipe calls for 3 oz of cream cheese and accidentally used the whole 8 oz!) but it ended up being the perfect amount, we like to have tons of extra icing :) My dad says they are better than cinnabon. I will definitely be making these again!

the best. soft, gooey, warm cinnamon rolls!     do not change a single thing about the recipe. make sure that you follow the directions of your bread machine.  i let these proof overnight in the refrigerator and shaping and cutting the dough and placing in a wrapped 9x13.  In the morning, I took out the rolls and let them sit on the counter for 30ish minutes, then threw them in the oven.  I didn't have time to make frosting in the morning so I got storebought Cream Cheese frosting and it was still great.

The rolls are dry, hard and taste NOTHING like Cinnabuns.  After comparingn this receipe to other really good cinnamon roll recipe, there is more flour, the temp to bake is higher and the flavor is simply not there.

Wow!!!!  I did not have time to make dough from scratch, so I bought frozen dough in the frozen food section of my grocery store.  I let one loaf of the frozen dough sit overnight in the fridge.  In the morning, I rolled it out into a rectangle and followed the recipe exactly as written.  From start to finish, it took less than 45 minutes!  The entire pan of rolls was finished off in less than 15 minutes by my family.  Great recipe and even greater when you can use frozen dough and save yourself a lot of time.

I thought it was too sweet. I much prefer a non-egg dough such as plain ol bread dough to cut some of the sweet of the frosting, brown sugar and cinnamon.

I've tried cinnamon rolls before, but never had as good of luck as I did with these. I didn't have a bread machine, so I took the suggestion of another reviewer and set the oven to warm, then turned it off and set the rolls in there for about an hour. After letting them rise, I put them in the fridge overnight and baked them the next morning. When I started making the frosting, I realized I didn't have any confectioner's sugar, so I used the recipe on this site for Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting. It was a nice, lighter alternative to the usual thicker cream cheese frosting.

WORTH THE TIME!! If you love real cinnamon rolls, look no further.  I read others advice and changed: substituted shortening for margarine (worked fine!) and combined butter with cinnamon, & baked at 350 for 20 min.  Frosting: I hate frosting, but this is definitely a WINNER! Wanted to keep eating--make it today!

This is a wonderful bread recipe. I've made it 3 times and it was successful every time. The texture of the bread is soft and almost melts in your mouth. I made this for Easter, and had friends over to share it, even gave some away. My family and friends love it. Thank you for sharing.

awesome recipe! easy to follow.. only difference is like others I proofed the yeast with warm milk and 1/4 tsp sugar until foamy..added eggs, sugar, salt..then slowly added flour.. in my kitchenaid.. I then switched to my dough hook and continued kneading..once it came together I kneaded by hand.. let the dough rise in a lightly oiled bowl for 1 hour..I then rolled the dough out into a 16X21 inch rectangle..put on the topping..rolled it up - suggestion: dental floss works very well to cut up your rolls! let rolls rise again for 30 mins..baked for 20 mins - oven was at 350..delicious!!

These are delicious and great to make.  I followed the directions without using a bread machine, using others suggestions on how to do that.  They turned out great! I would make a lot less icing because I don't really add on that much when I make it, but it's fantastic!

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have EVER had. I made them by hand/with a kitchen aid dough hook. I set the recipe to calculate what I needed for 12, and it made about 18. 16 fit in a glass baking dish and I refrigerated them overnight to be baked in the morning. How convenient that 2 were left over to bake the same night for dessert. ;-)  I doubled the icing recipe, in case someone wants extra icing on theirs... but it made a LOT of icing.   These are the best!! I can't wait to start trying different variations, with apples & cinnamon, and pecans!

THE BEST! This really is the best recipe for cinnamon rolls. We received terrible weather and we were snowed in for a few days, so with the extra time on my hands I decided to make these. They were so yummy and perfect. They made the house smell so wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't have a bread machine, so using the review of another member, I followed her instructions on how to make the dough without a bread machine. My family loved them! I made a few too many and shared them with the neighbors and they loved them as well. I will definitely make these again and again. Thank you for such an awesome tasty recipe!

I made this as written sans the bread flour as I  did not have any and ended up using AP in lieu and they still came out amazing!!  My daughter said that they were better than the ones at the mall or grocery store.  I plan on getting a thermometer so that I can get the correct temperature correct for the milk and I will hunt down bread flour and try it again...I am sure that will make them even more wonderful!!  I made this by hand as I do not have a bread machine and it was simple and straight forward.  Thank you for sharing this!!  UPDATE: I made these again today and thought I would share the non-bread machine way for those with the time and patience to do it. Sifted 4 1/2 c bread flour, leaving 1/2 cup on the side. Added bread machine yeast, flour and sugar, stirred to mix all the dry ingredients, and set aside in a separate bowl.  Melted the butter and the milk and let cool to 125 on a instant read thermometer. Meanwhile in a large bowl I whisked the eggs and added the milk and butter mixture.  With a heavy spoon or spatula I mixed the  dry ingredients with the wet 1 cup at a time.   Sprinkle part of the 1/2 c. reserved flour onto your work surface, turn dough onto the floured surface and begin kneading, incorporating the remaining flour and you knead 5-10 minutes till soft and silky.  Butter a large bowl, place dough into the bowl, turn to coat, cover and place in a warm area till doubled in bulk.  Turn dough onto a floured work surface and let rest 10 minutes. The proc

Didn't use the bread maker...just read previous reviews and made the adjustments. They are great!!! Tried them with my mom and they cook rather quickly (the bottom of ours were a little burnt), but they still tasted great. We are going to perfect it..and never buy cinnamon rolls!

Best cinnamon roll I ever tasted. My bf and I used to get the albertsons cinnamon rolls all the time and now we just make our own because they are so much better. For me it tends to be undercooked in the middle so I need to practice on how to cook it in the middle but not overcook on the outside. Great recipes!

The icing was good, but the rolls do not taste like Cinnabons.  They are too labor intensive for the finished product.  We made 12 and between us ate one and a half.  We tossed the rest.

OMG I would give these 10 STARS!!! if I could! These are the best things I have ever tasted!!!! They are so good you will cry when they're gone!! Literally! I know we did! I always used to make homemade cinnamon buns but always did a biscuit type dough, so they were quite different and well these blew those away. I found one thing helpful for the people who said the middle ones didn't cook, well I put the smaller end pieces in the middle and the bigger middle pieces on the outside so they cooked beautifully, and I did 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes instead of 400 for 15 min.. Hope this helps, oh and next time I think I'll use a bigger pan than a 9x13 as mine busted out and over and needed more room. I want to make these everyday....I could literally eat the whole pan. A big THANK YOU to the person that posted this recipe and I think I'm in love with you!!! LOL Please everyone make these....don't even think twice about it...just do it!

These are simply fabulous. The buns were simply perfect! Soft, scrumptious, mouth watering flavor!  I don't own a bread machine, so here's how I did it: I warmed up the milk to 115F or 45C & mixed in 2 1/2 teaspoons of active dry yeast & 2 tbsp. sugar from the cup of sugar the recipe called for. Then I let it rest for about 10 minutes, until it got creamy. Since I don't like using hydrogenated fats such as margarine, but knowing that butter won't give the dough that extra fluffiness, I used lard instead. I added the lard & the 2 eggs and used a whisk to mix them in properly. Then I added the rest of the sugar and continued whisking for a minute or two. I like to add the flour 1/2 cup at a time in case I need to make adjustments to the qty I use & by feeling the dough (it must feel elastic and smooth, slightly sticky) I ended up using only 4 cups of ap flour. I formed a tight ball, oiled a big bowl and put my dough in it face down, then turning it back up, so that all the dough was perfectly coated with oil, covered it and let it raise in a warm place until doubled (@ one hour) I took the dough out of the bowl, gently deflated it and rolled it out on a lightly floured counter. It rolled out beautifully, pretty thin and it did not stick to the counter. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Roll the dough pretty tight so the filling doesn't fall out when cutting. I used a sharp knife to cut the buns.

amazing recipe. it really is just like a cinnabon and considering how many i have consumed in my lifetime... i can tell u... i know what the cinnabon tastes like and this recipe is perfect... althooo i did make alterations to fit my needs and here they are:  I do not have a bread machine so i also dissolved my yeast in my sugar/milk mixture. I kept everything else the same except i did double the cream cheese frosting recipe. It is almost necessary to double the frosting because it is very delicious, not overly sweet, and perfectly compliments the cinnabon. Oh and i did make these the night before, so putting them in the fridge overnight is perfectly fine. I put them in the oven while it was preheating along with the regular cook time. Maybe it is just my oven but when i took it out of the oven after 20 minutes, it was undercooked. Me being careless, had already spread a lot of the frosting on before i realized this. So i just popped it back in the oven for ten more minutes. It still turned out perfect! even the frosting was still delicious. so apparently this is a recipe even i cannot mess up!

This recipe is awesome!  I used the dough from the Amish Sweet Bread recipe & used about half the recommended cinn.  I prepared them last night, covered with plastic wrap and put in the fridge.  Took them out this morning and cooked at 350 for 30 mins, they were perfect.  As suggested, I flipped them over as soon as I took them out so all that gooey goodness stayed on them!  I will never crave Cinnabon again!

i made this recipe a few times and made some changes.  we didn't use bread flour, and used all purpose flour...we substituted a cup of whole wheat flour, which gave it a more wholesome texture.  i found that using all white flour made it very dinner-roll-esque.  to deepen the flavour, we added a little more butter a dash of cloves and nutmeg to the cinnamon filling.  i am a huge fan of cream cheese flavour, so we added an 8oz package of cream cheese...and it was super!!!  definitely add some of the icing when they come out of the oven, and add some more before serving.

These were totally AWESOME!!!  I took them to my mother in laws and they couldn't stop raving about them and they were gone in a flash.  I found the recipe was easy peasy.  The bread maker made the dough.  The only work was rolling out the dough.  After that it was just following the steps and waiting to rise.    There was a lot of icing, I just froze the extra and will use on my next batch.  I'm sure others would use it up, but we didn't put too much on the buns.  I cannot wait to make them again!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I have to say these are the best. I used to work in a store that was located right arcoss from Cinnabon in the mall so of course I ate a Cinnabon everyday. And this recipes is just as good as cinnabons. They also freeze well.

Loved this recipe. The only change I made was to add 3 tablespoons Vital Wheat Gluten. Made the dough perfect. Took a batch to work last night and came home with an empty pan.

YUM, these are so delicious! I cut down the flour by 1/4 cup the second time I made them, and the dough was perfect consistency with that minor adjustment.  My kids prefer the small "cinnabites" so i rolled the dough to 1/2" thickness and spread butter and brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on both sides. Used a pizza cutter to cut the dough into 1/2" cubes and put them on a greased cookie sheet and let rise before baking 15 minutes at 375. Drizzled frosting over the pieces and served them in a cup, just like at the mall. They were a BIG hit!

Wow, I make these all the time and cannot believe I haven't rated it yet. This is an awesome recipe for perfect cinnamon rolls. When I make these, it never fails my 5 year old daughter will hug me and say "you are the best cooker in the world". I have used all purpose flour in place of bread flour on occasion when I am out, and they turn out just as wonderful. Thank you for such a delicious recipe!

well i am hooked...i followed the recipe for the dough ingredients but used some helpful hints that another member gave me and read reviews too...they turned out great and i really liked how the dough turned out it was easy for me to work with...however...the buns turned out to be huge...rose very high...i cooked them at 350 for about 25 minutes or so...when they were getting brown i lightly covered them with tin foil and continued to bake til i thought they were done...i should have made them smaller oh well...but i ate two while they were still warm with more butter...and i was in cinnamon bun heaven...i will freeze the rest to share with a friend...hope they freeze okay...oh and i did also use vital wheat gluten...i will definitely make these again...thanks for the recipe and thanks to those who gave me helpful hints...and now i have an idea to use the dough for poppy seed buns/rolls...

This really deserves 10 stars!!! I thought that these would be labour intensive, but I was wrong.  It does take some time (more like waiting time for the dough to double in size)but its totally worth it.  My nine year old son, enjoyed watching every step in the process and couldn't wait to eat one.  I'm making another batch today!  These are perfect! thx

This recipe was awesome. I made it by hand instead of the bread machine, and it was FANTASTIC. The first time I used the cream cheese icing on here, and I felt that it overpowered the rolls. The second time I made these, I used just a regular icing from another recipe, and they were PERFECT.

Just like a cinnabon!!!!  They are delicious!!!!!!   I do not have a bread machine so I just mixed it by hand and then kneaded it for a few min.!  (I used a whole packet of yeast) I put in a glass bowl and covered it with a towel and put it on top of my stove!  It did take a little longer to raise this way!  But it worked fine!  Everything else I kept the same.......sooooooooooo good!!!! Will Def make again!!!  Loved, loved, loved, them!!!!!!!

Holy Buckets!  These were extremely YUMMY!  I used my breadmaker and I swear the dough rose to 4x's the size!  After rolling them and placing in the greased (glass) pan I let them sit for a good 45 minutes on top of the preheated stove with a towel over the top of them!  The finished products were massively huge and totally hit the spot!!!

WOW!!!  These suckers were awesome! I was worried I messed up because my dough was very sticky and difficult to work with, but they turned out really light and super fluffy.  I made mine the night before and then put in the refrig over night, let them proff for an hour in the morning and then put them in the oven at 350 for 45 min.  I served them with breakfast and they were better than I ever imagined.  This recipe is a keeper.  It's a bit of work but if you do everything the night before it's not so bad.

Made this recipe today. I didn't have margarine, so I used butter in the dough. I proofed the yeast by putting the total amount of yeast in 1/4 warm water with one tablespoon of sugar. I let it sit for around 10 minutes until bubbly.  Since I used butter, the extra 1/4 cup water made up for the fact that margarine has a higher water content than butter.  I added one teaspoon of  vanilla to the liquid in the bread machine.   Once done, I turned the dough out onto floured wax paper. Trust me when I say use LOTS of flour when rolling it out. I thought I'd used enough but the wax paper still stuck to the dough.   The dough took a little longer to roll out than I had expected. I made a mistake by using only 1/2 cup butter to spread on the rectangle of dough. I will be much better with the 1/3 cup the recipe called for. I left 1/2 inch along the long edge unbuttered to seal the roll.  After sprinkling on the sugar/cinnamon mixture (leaving the 1/2 inch edge unsugared), I used a rolling pin to pat down the mixture. the helped keep the sugar and cinnamon from falling out. I rolled it up starting with the long end, like a jelly roll, and it made around 3  layers. I sealed the unsugared edge. Then I cut off the uneven ends to make the end rolls uniform.  I sliced them with a knife  about 1 inch wide, and put them cut side down in a parchment lined 8 x 4 pan, four to a pan. After letting them rise I baked at 350 for around 17 minutes. There was no issue of the filling running out, but t

My sister has a wonderful cinnamon roll recipe that she won't share.  I set out to find a good recipe, and this recipe is better than my sister's!  So, if you're reading this Lynette-I don't need your recipe anymore-this one beats yours! ;)

I don't have a bread machine so I used other reviewer's advice on how to make this without a bread machine.  I also made them the night before and put them in the fridge just before letting them rise the last time.  I just pulled them out the next morning and put them in a cold oven, turned it to 350 degrees, and baked for 25 minutes.  Next time I will probably place them in 2 8X8 pans or 2 8" round pans to give them more room to expand and for more even baking.  In my 9X13 pan, the outer buns browned and baked well while the inner buns had some doughie spots.  

I made no changes to the recipe and it came out delicious.

i have never made cinnamon rolls before. i'm not good at all at making dough either, so when i got my breadmaker a couple of months ago, this is a recipe i had to try. i started this afternoon with the dough, in the breadmachine, started having probs with rising, or so i thought, turned out okay, but lots of worrying and posting to AR for help, and i got excellent help by the way. okay, rolled them out, doubled the recipe for the filling, rolled them up, cut them, (i ended up with 16 pieces), left four out to rise, and froze the rest. well the four didn't really rise, as the recipe called for. the recipe said "until they double in size. they may have quartered in size, so i was quite worried about this as well. i also didn't pack them in tight in the pan. my pan was an 8x8 with the four rolls packed in the middle, so when i took them out of the oven, the outsides were a dark brown (not burned). i spread some of the icing on top right away as some reviewer suggested to make them softer. and a few min. later put the rest on. OMG. they were AWESOME. i suprised myself! my son even loves me again (he's typical moody 17 yr old) he ate two. the dough in the middle is sooooo soft and tender, just like the real deals. these are easy, after all the trouble i thought they were. i worried for nothing it seems. however, i do wonder how to get the filling a little more gooeyer/syrupy like. as it tends to get hard once they're cooled and this is soooo not a complaint! cuz it's soooo yummy,

I made this for Christmas Eve breakfast. I made one recipe of dough, 1 1/2 of filling and 1 of frosting. Ity was great. I mad eit the day before, refrigerated overnight, and let it sit out for an hour or so before baking. After reading others reviews, I baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes. These rolls are great. I made 18 out of the recipe- 12 in a 9x13 pan and 6 in a pie plate. I don't know how you could eat a much bigger serving than that. They are also great two days out...

I absolutely love this recipe! I was asked to bring some to a family holiday party and had never made cinnamon rolls before. (Well, as a kid I had made them with my mom, but that doesn't count.) Just one tip that I haven't already seen posted...to cut the cinnamon rolls, use unscented, waxed dental floss.

This icing is amazing!! I finally got a bread machine and made this recipe. Perfect cinnamon roll! I put the icing in a plastic bag, cut the bottom corner off and drizzled the icing on the rolls. Easy way to distribute the icing evenly.

These were good.... There was something missing in the frosting that wasn't QUITE like Cinnabon, but hey, they were still delicious. I maded them, then put them in the fridge and cooked the next morning because I didn't realize how many times they had to rise. I will make again for certain...

This was the first time I've ever made homemade cinnamon rolls. They where very easy to make. It asks for two room temp. eggs, I can be impatient so I looked up a quick way. Place your egg [in the shell] in warm water for two min. Wipe off. feel it, if it seems cool still, place it in warm water one more time for two min. It seemed to work,no one got sick either [for the egg police]. I made two batches. I was very trusting of the reviews.So I sent them off with my husband to work. He works construction, the guys loved them, one man said "they where the best he's ever had, and he's had a lot of cinnamon rolls". I thought that was really nice. My husband was very happy. So was I. Thank you for a terrific recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  I had my first Cinnabon when I was at the Fort Lauderdale Airport 3 years ago. This recipe is the perfect combination of sweet, moist and buttery flavor that is easy to make and tastes just like the real Cinnabon.

How can 2000+ "5 star" ratings be wrong?  This is THE cinnamon roll recipe to use.  And it is so easy when using the bread machine.  I did make mine the night before and then put in the oven to bake the next morning.  What a treat!

I made these without using a bread machine and they turned out amazing!!  My kids were in heaven and were sad that I will not be making these again until Christmas morning.  They were fluffy and gooey.  I did what other reviewers did and flipped them immediately upside down so all the ooze could run into the center.  As for others saying that they unrolled in the oven, you should put them somewhat close together so when they cook, they will all come together and stick.

We ate half right away and froze half right after rolling - and they were awesome both ways! This is not an  inexpensive recipe though, so I'll probably just use it to impress company (which it did).

This is a great recipe for cinnamon rolls.It's not ewwy and gooey like a cinnabon but that's a good thing.
I can't eat the center of a cinnabon.
This is one for the recipe box.

Exceptional! I doubled the recipe and made them for my sunday school class. I had two bread machines going at once.  I cut the rising time by about 10 minutes before sticking them in the oven, didn't seem to effect them any. The only thing I changed was I used butter and only 1 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon.  I used a pastry cutter to cut the butter into the sugar and cinnamon mixture. After brushing the dough with butter I added the cinnamon and sugar mixture.  I didn't have a problem at all with the filling falling out.
Update:  I made these rolls again and they were outstanding I made them the night before and let them set out for about 45 min. the next morning.  Didn't seem to change anything.  They did bake about 10 min. longer.

Very tastey! I would go with a little more of the brown sugar mix, but otherwise no problems at all making this without a bread machine. I just followed the review suggestions. Easy, easy and a keeper!

Oh. My. Goodness. These are so scrumptious! Not good for my diet, but everybody needs a treat sometimes. I followed the directions in the reviews for making this without a bread machine, and they turned out just perfect. I did double the icing, but I'm not sure that's necessary. I think it'd be great just as written in the recipe. Can't wait to share these with my family - I know I'm going to get lots of compliments!

Good and easy to follow recipe.  Icing was a little on the overly sweet side.  Next time I think I will cut back on the powdered sugar a bit.

If you want "Oohs and Aahs" on a recipe, this is definately the one to prepare. I, unfortunately do not have a breadmaker, but one of the previous reveiwers gave instruction on how to use this recipe without one. It may add more prep time, but is SO worth it. We had a Cinnabon near me here in VA until about 5 years back and I almost needed "Cinnabon Rehab" until I came across this recipe. Pretty much a dead ringer for the real thing. Now, if only I could find a recipe to replicate their Caramel Pecan Roll, I'd be totally over my "loss".

SOO good!  

I put my dough on wax paper when I rolled--
Make sure you either spray (with non stick spray) or flour the waxed paper before- it will stick like crazy!  

Also, I tried the floss trick w/cutting it- but it didnt work for me.  I ended up using a super sharp serrated bread knife and it worked perfectly.

Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic. A hint for substituting all purpose flour for baking flour: make sure to add extra gluten so it will stand up to the oven. 

Here's how: 

Make a simpel dough from 1 cup of whole wheat flour and a little water. Rinse the dough under a trickling stream of water for about two minutes, until you have only gluten (Wash out all of the starch).  This should leave you about two tablespoons of gluten, which I added to the dough before kneading. It came out absolutely perfect, even without baking flour!

Oh my goodness! I would have to say this is better then a cinnabon. Being homemade, it tasted home made. I don't have a bread machine so I did the first part by hand. This recipe is a keeper and can't wait to make these for the rest of my family. Thank you!

Wow - these were delicious, esp. this last time.  I took a cue from another subscriber and added lemon juice to the frosting and a friend of mine that I shared one (lol - just one) with said she absolutely loved the frosting.  I think the key to a great cinnamon roll is to make darn sure you don't overbake them!!!  The first couple of times I made them they were kinda hard so I turned down the oven to 350 and didn't let them get quite golden brown so they were nice and gooey inside.  So I guess it's mostly about personal preference and knowing your oven.  :)

This is a great recipe. I have a co-worker who said it was the best cinnaomon roll she has ever eaten. The icing was just the right amount, no need to double the quantity. Also, I followed others suggestions and let the rolls sit in the fridge overnight. They were excellent!

I really like this recipe, i made it by hand instead of using a bread machine and used butter instead of margarine. I also substituted the cinnamon and brown sugar with the zest of two oranges and white sugar. I made it with cinnamon the first time and my boyfriend wanted orange rolls for his birthday. They turned out awesome!

This recipe has gotten rave reviews from anyone I've ever served them to.  I have made these about a dozen times and they have been excellent every time.

I do use Saigon cinnamon that I get at the grocery store or Costco instead of regular cinnamon...as it really makes them taste more like Cinnabon.

I also use the recipe for Amish White Bread from this site submitted by "Peg" instead of the bread recipe for these rolls.  I make the dough in my bread machine.  I have a child that is allergic to eggs...so a recipe without eggs is helpful for us.  I haven't tried them with this bread recipe.

My husband and kids love when I make these.

I made these for a work potluck.  I was not impressed with the frosting the night I made them, but it tasted much better the next day when I took them to work.  I don't think they are a clone of a cinnabon, but I thought they were very good.  My co-workers, however, can't stop raving about them, & I've been asked to bring them next potluck.  I advise making the frosting the day before you plan to serve the rolls.

Awesome!  Forgot to add the oil and added it after the dough was mixed together and they still turned out awesome!  Added Whole Wheat Flour and skipped the icing.

Absolutely fantastic! I haven't had a Cinnabon in a long while, but this tasted perfect to me. And the icing was divine! The only things I did differently were: I didn't have margarine, so I used butter; I mixed the butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar together and then spread it on the dough; and I put parchment paper in the bottom of my glass baking dish. I often use parchment when baking breads - cleanup is so so so much easier and you don't need to grease pans if the recipe suggests it.

Fabulous recipe!
I'm a first time cinnamon roll baker, and so I didn't heat the milk enough, added the salt to early and didn't knead the dough enough, all of which meant that the dough didn't rise enough and only yielded 8 rolls.
I also followed the advice of the user who suggested 350 degrees for 20 minutes and they came out undercooked. 
However they were still fabulous, and my roommates loved them as well. (The frosting is to die for!)
This is a recipe is a keeper, and I will definitely make it again, this time following the original recipe and baking at 400 degrees, and I may increase the baking time if needed.

These cinnamon rolls were AMAZING! They were fluffy, light, and had a perfect texture. The cinnamon and brown sugar given was the perfect amount and was sweet but not too sweet. The only thing i did different was bake it at 350 for 20 minutes. They cooked evenly and my family absolutely enjoyed them! :]

this recipe is as awesome as everyone else says it is! i followed the advice of others and was able to make this without a breadmaker. i lined my baking dish with parchment paper and butter - they didn't stick at all! i baked mine at 350 for 25 minutes (20 min they weren't golden brown yet). i like that these come out perfect the first time you ever make them!

My work friends beg me for these!  I just can't keep up with the demand!  The last batch (two dozen) were eaten in under 15 minutes!  Everyone said that I should open up a cinnamon bun business.  These can be made the night before.  After placing them in the pans, refrigerate them until about two hours before baking.  Take them out and let them rise before popping in the oven.  Double the cream cheese icing recipe and apply while the buns are warm.  The buns taste best when served warm with vanilla ice cream.

This really doesn't need another review, but they are fabulous!  Agree that baking at 350 instead of 400.  Also agree that lining baking sheet is good idea.  I did add just a touch of milk to the frosting mixture to help it blend.  Turned out wonderful.

Wonderful!  Not usually a fan of the cinnamon roll because they're generally not worth the calories, this is soooo worth the calories!  Had overnight guests so I made these the day before and then put in fridge until the next morning, took out and allowed to rise before baking.  Turned out great.  However, did not take the full 15 minutes to bake, closer to 10 for my oven.

Not that this recipe needs another great review, but these are excellent! I did everything that the recipe said, the only issue I had was on the rising time (but that isn't the recipes fault). Mine took almost 2 hours to rise the first time and the second time was about 45 minutes.  I know some had said it called for too much sugar/cinnamon, but i thought i might need a LITTLE bit more. I did not double the frosting and it was perfect.  If you haven't tried these you need to.  I will be making these many times over! Thanks for the great recipe!!! *I did make a paste out of the butter brown sugar and cinnamon, made it look nicer and stayed in the rolls better!

I was craving Cinnabon cinnamon buns but don't live anywhere near one, so I figured I could probably find a recipe somewhere, and here it is!  These are sooooooooo yummy!  My sisters-in-law were all envious!  A lot of work, but definitly worth it.  Double the icing!
I make the dough by hand, use instructions from Mother's cinnamon rolls.
When tripling the recipe, do not triple salt, use three packets of yeast.
Use hand mixer for icing.
15 minutes is too long in the oven.

very good! if you want to make them overnight, place rolls in freezer/fridge before the 2nd rise (after you have cut them and placed in pan). In the morning, just pull them out, let rise in a warm place for about 40 minutes and bake.
I agree with the other reviews - DON'T cut down on the cinnamon/brown sugar - it's perfect.  I substitute 1/4 C white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar for 1 C brown sugar and add a bit of vanilla to the butter and it seems to have a little more flavor.

These are amazing!  In between licking their fingers, my family couldn't stop saying how incredible these buns are.  Definitely flip them upside down out of the baking pan before putting the icing on...it makes all the difference.

Thought these were really really good. I think I messed up somewhere though, becasue my boyfriend and I didnt think they tasted like Cinnabon's rolls. However this is a very good recipe and I will definitely make again!

Amazing you don't need a bread machchine (I followed the first reveiwer's advice). I wish the frosting was more milky, but it's excellent for cakes. People say it needs less brown sugar and cinnamin, I think it needs more!

Five stars because my men and the friends we shared them with loved them so much. After reading some reviews I find that I am not alone in thinking the 2nd rise is not long enough.  I have made them twice and no one has complained, but since I have now learned a 2nd rise trick, I will try that next time.  Otherwise, this is an awesome recipe!

Cue the Drool. My five year old gets all the stuff out to make them & drags me to the kitchen.
This are a huge hit in our home and community. An extremely versatile recipe. I have used oil when I'm out of butter or margarine... water instead of milk... Another user has mentioned that depending  on the humidity levels, it may take longer to rise. We warm up the oven & pop some boiling water in as well to get them along. Defiantly puts our bread machine to work!

Made these with butter instead of margarine but added about 1/3 cup of chocolate chips to the brown sugar mixture.  REALLY GOOD.

YUMO!!!  The only things I would change for next time would be to use a knife and cut the corners to right angles... rather than rounded... b/c this makes it hard when you roll it up... I mean you kind of lose a little of the cinnamon buns since the dough isn't the same length on both sides... I still used mine, but those ones came out harder than the other ones b/c they were mainly dough.  Anyway... the other thing I did do was I cut the dough in more than 12 slices.  The slices with 12 were WAY too big.  I basically cut the roll in half in the middle, then I cut each of those in half at the middle, and so on until I felt the rolls were a good size.  I didn't have any trouble with losing the goo either... I made extra icing b/c we love that part, but I shouldn't have... the recipe calls for the right amount, so next time I won't double it!  This was delicious and I plan on making them again!  Thanks for the recipe!

All I can say is Oh Wow!  This is the first time I have made these - I stumbled onto the recipe as a new user of the site and decided to give them a try.  I took onboard some of the comments made by others, I used half bread flour and half plain flour, I used the warm oven idea to help them rise and I baked them at 375degF.  I used the given amount for the topping and thought there was more than enough, I think if it was doubled they would be too sweet and gooey. Having said that we don't have Cinnabon in Scotland so maybe that's how they are supposed to be! They turned out absolutely amazing and I will be making them again this week for my friends who I know will be very impressed!  Thank you for a brilliant recipe!

My dough seemed a little tough in the bread machine and rolling out had to really stretch it maybe too much flour?? Overall though they tasted wonderful, have been waiting to try this recipe glad I did!!

SO fantastic.  Made them the old fashioned way - without a bread machine. Cut the risen dough in half and made 12 out of each half (24 total) so they were smaller.  Worked fine and feels a little less decadent when eaten!  Definitely flip them upsidedown when finished so you don't lose the yummy goo.

These were fantastic...just as good if not better than Cinnabon's!  I don't do alot with bread/yeast and I don't have a bread machine but I followed some suggestions and used one 7 oz packet of dry yeast which I dissolved in the warm milk and then followed the recipe.  (I kneaded it a little bit...not quite sure how long to knead for.)  I did let it rise in the preheated oven which worked well.
I think next time, I will combine the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon and spread it on so it all stays in there.  I rolled the dough from the long side and cut into 13 pieces.  I would probably cut them smaller for mini's as they were the size of the acutal cinnabon.
I would also bake at 350 because the tops got very brown quickly and I was afraid it the dough would still be raw in the middle so I baked them a little longer.  
AND...I would definitely mad a double batch of icing as we love that!  (I might even try the canned cream cheese icing)

Wow these we good, I used the sweet bread recipes from my kitchenaid cookbook, then proceeded with this recipe. I also took the advice of flipping over the pan of rolls which went very well, then iced them. They just melted in our mouths. Thank-you, Ann

Great. I added 1 1/2 t of cinnamon to the dough and did not frost with the frosting as it seemed too rich. We used a glaze of powdered sugar, butter, milk & vanilla to frost. I have made these a couple of times now and they always turn out. Very easy as well!

Very Yummy and my house smells oh so good!!

I used Splenda Brown Sugar and instead of sprinkling it on the butter, I mixed the the butter, sugar and cinnamon together and spread it on.  This made it so the mixture stayed in the bun versus oozing out into the pan.

The Splenda Brown sugar tastes good...I only used it because I was out of regular.  Pro to that is it is half the calories so I don't feel as bad eating these things!

Oh my gosh, this was the best ever! It's even better than Cinnabon. I think the only thing I would change is the amount of frosting. I will probably double it next time.

This is by far the best recipe I've tried from the site. Just fabulous! Better than a Cinnabon, in my opinion because they are so fresh!
I added a little bit of canned vanilla frosting to the cream cheese frosting in the recipe just to take the cream-cheesiness down a notch and it was perfect. These are a bit time consuming with the rolling out, but sooooo worth it. I used a bread machine and that was really easy.

Whoa... I am not very agile when it comes to yeast doughs.  This took some time to do (3+ hours?) but soooo worth it and they do reheat nicely.  Followed recipe exactly.  Wish I knew where in the process I could stop and put it in the fridge so piping fresh rolls wouldn't take quite so long in the AM.

May try a little less cream cheese in the icing next time, but it wasn't bad by any means, just my preference for a more neutral flavor.  These would make a fabulous hostess gift or xmas baked gift... makes most people stand up and say, "WOW!"

These are so delicious!  I made them for Christmas breakfast and everyone LOVED them.  I was a bit worried because the dough didn't rise much in the time I had before needing to bake them (about an hour) but they turned out perfect anyway.  I loved the frosting too, tastes like it came from Cinnabon for sure!!  Try this, you'll love it!  
UPDATE:  I made these for the second time today and I did as a few suggested, after I took them out of the oven I turned them over onto a cookie sheet to let the cinnamon/brown sugar filling redistribute through each roll.  I was planning to flip them back again to frost them but they came out of the pan and the bottoms lookes so juicy and perfect to I left them flipped over and iced the bottoms with the frosting.  This made them TO DIE FOR!!!  They were great before but even better this way, and they looked gorgeous too!!  Hope this tip helps anyone who has had a problem with the filling dripping out of the rolls to the pan.  Try it, it really works great!

FANTASTIC! If you need to win people over, this is the way to do it :) In regards to the cooking times - mine cooked quite quickly -just 15 minutes at 350 - when others had recommended 25-30 (mind you, I have an older oven, and it may be wonky, but it's generally not off by that much). So, just a reminder to keep an eye on things! Great recipe, and thanks for posting!

The key to this is using fast rising yeast.I used regualr yeast and it really di not rise as well. I let it rise for 30 minutes in a warm oven. I made sure to cover the bowl with a cloth so it can rise.(make sure the oven isnt too hot so your bowl wont melt! I do not have a bread machine. But I found this recipe to be easy without one.   I also use a bit of melted butter after the rolls rise, I brush onto the rolls. Then I sprinkle a bit more of cinnamon on it. I also make sure when making the dough I put cinnamon in that too.  If your a cinnamon lover, then add some of the cinnamon in the icing as well. It taste SOOO good. I am going to have to make another batch!  This is still not a cinnabon, but it is a really good recipe. These rolls only last about two days or less. YUMMY!!

wow these were excellent,.. I followed the recipe as it stated but I read the reviews and I doubled the icing however I didn't need to...I also turned them over after they were done baking. Good idea. It was so easy and well worth the time. I used my bread oven it worked great... thanks for the wonderful recipe.... I took a tray to my neighbors and they said tasted as good as cinnabon...... I will make these again.

I first want to start off by saying... I hate cinnamon rolls. Yeah, I'm a weirdo. I simply made these for fun (even though I honestly don't like the smell of sweet baking pastries). When they came out of the oven looking so beautiful, I decided to give them a try. For the first time in my life, I've enjoyed eating a few bites of a cinnamon roll! I will definately make these again (not for myself, but others).

I couldn't find bread machine yeast, so I bought packets of Active Yeast. I used a packet and it worked! I used my bread machine simply for kneeding. I followed the suggestion to put the oven at 200, turn it off, and let the dough rise that way. It worked PERFECTLY (I've never made bread products before out of the bread machine). I also didn't end up using all of the brown sugar mixture. After I cut the dough into rolls, I used the oven again to help those rise. They baked for 15 minutes and turned out perfectly! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

WOW!!!! These are by far the best cinnamon rolls I've had.  My kids ate them up, too.  Plus, they're homemade and I know exactly what's in them. They are easy even without a bread machine and they came out fluffy and delicious! I'll definately make these again soon! Thanks for sharing. UPDATE: I HAVE MADE THESE SEVERAL TIMES SINCE I FOUND THEM. I'VE LEARNED, HOWEVER, THEY DO TURN OUT DOUGHY, ESPECIALLY IF I BAKE THEM IN A CAKE PAN. TO CORRECT THIS, I TURN TEMP DOWN TO 325-350 DEGREES. IT TAKES A LITTLE LONGER, BUT THEY ALWAYS TURN OUT DONE...NOT DOUGHY. THEY ALSO BAKE UP WELL IN A COUPLE OF PIE PANS.

I doubled the recipe and made it without a bread machine.  The frosting is a dead ringer for Cinnabon's frosting.  Great recipe!

These were good.  Made the dough by hand and it is a must that you use bread flour as AP produces a different (although still tasty) texture.  Never been to Cinnabon, but if they are as tasty as these rolls than it must be worth it.

These tasted great. My husband didn't think I had made them homemade which is a major compliment coming from him (he does not prefer homemade things). I might use a little less cinnamon next time. I also made these the night before and put them in the fridge and did the water in the oven, 30 minute rise before baking in the AM. The center rolls did not seem to get done though so I think I will use a lower temp. next time.

I read a lot of reviews before making these, but I didn't see the ones that said to bake at 350 for 25-30 mins, instead of 400 for 15. So, mine were underdone in the middle, which is disappointing. But they do taste delicious -- the ones that are done-- and next time I will know to cook on a lower heat.

This is very very Yummy. When Making the frosting if you use salted butter you don't need to add the salt. If you do the frosting will be way to salty.

Wow!!  My 12 year old son & I made these for the whole family tonight.  We stuck strictly to the recipe with no variations.  When the plates were served, all five of us just melted.  We now have a new treat that we plan to have on special occassions & holidays.  Fabulous recipe!!!

I had to make these lowfat/lower calorie for my husband who is on a diet but craving cinnamon buns and I was leery about how they would come out. But wow!! Even with the changes they are so good. And my 16 year told me there is no way they are healthier, because they taste so fattening. I substituted egg beaters for the eggs, light butter spread for the regular stuff, Slenda sugar blends for regular sugar and brown sugar, and fat free cream cheese for the regular stuff. Other than making those changes, I followed the recipe. They are sooo yummy. And I don't feel so bad now eating them.

This was a really good cinnamon roll, however like others have said its not gooey enough. Almost a bit dry. I will try modifying it next time by adding 1/2 cup corn syrup as someone else mentioned and see if that helps. Very good though! Will definitly use again!

These are so easy and taste so good. This is one of my favorite treats to take to others or to work on a stressful or rainy day to lighten everyone's mood. *I double the frosting recipe so there's plenty to go around.*

Everyone LOVED these rolls!  I used my kitchenaid mixer instead of a bread machine.  I proofed the yeast for about ten minutes, all of the warm milk, one tsp. of the sugar, and 1 tbsp of yeast.  I used instant active yeast instead of bread machine yeast, and compensated by using all-purpose flour.  Putzy to make, but very simple.  Mom says they are better than cinnabon. :)

I know there are already so many positive reviews but had to add my two thumbs up, my kids two thumbs up and my neighbors who I shared half the batch with's thumbs up!  

I rolled from the long side and cut with dental floss every two inches. I ended up with 13 rolls.  I used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan and when they were done turned them over onto a differnt pan (sprayed a little bit with spam) and let all the yummy goo drip back onto the tops.  Then I flipped them back into the first pan and iced.  I didn't use the icing recipe here as I had no cream cheese but I used a very simple one and it was delicious.  3 cups powdered sugar, 3 tbs milk, 1 tbs vanilla and mix.  Add more milk to get the consistency you desire.  WOW is all I can say. : ) The family came a running when they were done.

I did't have a bread machine and so followed the advice of others and proofed yeast and then put the dry ingredients in one bowl and the wet in another. once the yeast was ready i mixed it with the wet ingredients then made a well in the flour and then mixed   everything until it was homogenous. then i let it rise for 1 hour and 20 minutes. and followed the rest of the recipe as written. this is a very delicious recipe. i might ease down on the sugar because if you are sensitive to sweet things this will have you twitching for the next few hours. i can't imagine adding more sugar, syrups, or corn syrup for that matter. for me it's borderline sickeningly sweet...but otherwise delicious!

This is such an amazing recipe! I did a "side by side" comparison with a real Cinnabon, and no one could tell the difference! The first time I made this recipe, I backed off on the cinnamon, DON'T! It really needs all of it! I could make this every weekend, but save it for "special occasions" You won't be disappointed!

GREAT STUFF!
To make these rolls a little more "gooey" inside I added some brown sugar and cinnamon to the top of each roll and a small bit of butter. This gives them that ooey-gooey on the inside that cinnabon has. I agree that to lower the temp a bit and bake a little longer is a good idea. This way they are cooked in the middle without being overdone. I used this icing with just a bit more vanilla and LOVE it! I just might have to mass produce these babies!hmmm....

This recipe was amazing.  I will be making it again as soon as possible.  The dough was chewy and not too sweet.  The cinnamon filling was super cinnamon-y and tasty, and the icing was thick and delicious.  I cannot say enough about how delicious this recipe was.

Oh my gosh these were delicious!  I made them for a group of friends that were moving and they were gobbled up.  I don't have a bread machine so I just mixed it in my kitchenaid then let it rise for an hour in a warm oven like someone had suggested.  I wouldn't preheat the oven to 200 degrees though.  I took the bowl out of the oven after an hour and it was still so hot that I had to use a hot pad!  It sort of cooked the top of the dough it was so hot.  Next time I'll set the temp. around 150 degrees, turn it off, then see if it's still too hot before I put my dough in there to rise.

Very good. I made them by hand, dough was a little stiff, but turned out really good. I also doubled the icing, but shouldn't have. Even my children could not eat them with that much icing! I will defintly be using this one again!

I am NOT a baker...but this was super easy and it turned out delicious.  My family loved them.  I used my bread machine for the dough and followed the recipe for the rest.  This is a keeper!

My tastebuds were all geared up for Cinnabon so I was a little disappointed. It did taste more like it after they had cooled. The icing did taste of cream cheese more than Cinnabon's does. So 4 stars b/c it was good, but not as good as Cinnabon!

FABULOUS!!! This was a really fast and easy recipe! It came out wonderfully! I unfortunately made the dough before I realized I was out of brown sugar, but white sugar worked just fine. I will definately be making this again, and probably very soon!

These are insanely AMAZING!!!!  My husband told me these tasted better than Cinnabon!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was that I baked the cinnamon rolls in 2 pans so they would have more room to spread out.  I also doubled the frosting recipe since the frosting is so yummy.  This recipe is a winner!!!

If I could give a higher rating--I would!! This is an amazing recipe.  Not really hard, just time consuming to do it right.  DEFINATELY worth the time and work.  I had never made anything like this before, but will definately do these again!

Very, very delicious!   Leftovers - if you have them - freeze well individually (but you'll need to plan ahead and refrain from frosting them).  Allow to thaw overnight in the fridge, and refresh in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.

I only did four stars because it's not "exactly" like cinnabon, but they were darn good!! They baked beautifully. I assembled them Christmas Eve night and baked them Christmas morning. It was fun! I'm sure we'll do it again next Christmas! Everyone loved them.  UPDATE: Use dark brown sugar. It makes a difference.

I messed up on these a few times and they were still amazing.  I don't even like cinnamon rolls, but I like these!  I accidentally doubled the cinnamon mixture  and butter that you smear on the rolled out dough.  I recommend that everyone do this, I will continue to do it in the future!

Very yummy (yet sinful) and easy to make using breadmachine.
Still turn out great despite using All Purpose Flour and Quickrise Instant yeast (increase to 3 tsp)instead as that's what I have.
Thanks for suggesting using Dental floss and lining pan with greased waxpaper.  It certainly helped to avoid squishing the dough while cutting and avoid the mess after baking while making it also easy to remove the dough/roll from the pan.  Also found my dough rise very well when placed in preheated oven.  
I had to decrease the oven temp and time to 335F x 15min to avoid burning the bun - that's likely b/c my buns were smaller (made 20).  

Would make this recipe again but will have to ensure I start earlier so I don't go to bed at 3am again.  Took me 4 1/2 hours total (2h breadmachine and 2h rise).

Next time, will try refridgerating my rolls and bake next day but not sure of the steps.  
Not sure whether I should let my rolls double in size first before refridgerating??

This recipe is seriously devine! My family was recently in Hawaii and my Dad had heard about Cinnabon. He tried one and has been raving about them ever since. When I found this recipe I knew I had to try it. In three days I made 2 batches... undoubtedly I'll be making these again. They are YUM! I actually added milk choc chips to half the pastry before rolling up. When they come out of the oven, they are gooey, chocolately, cinnamon heaven! Amazing!

Mmmmm, amazing!  I made the rolls the night before Easter to bake on Easter morning.  They were huge after rising overnight and the texture was perfect.  I increased the brown sugar/cinnamon mix by about half.  Will definitely make again.

I really, really don't like working with anything that has yeast due to horrible experiences with it in the past (sounds like a bad relationship). That said, I still decided to try this recipe because I love Cinnabon so much. And I'm glad I did. It turned out delicious and perfect the first time I tried it. I followed the recipe as is, made it by hand (my mixer is too big) but used another recipe for the frosting. You have to try this!!

These were great!!!  I don't have a bread machine but it still worked great by hand.  My son loved them.  My only complaint is that I wish they would stay moist past the first day.  They are still good though if you microwave them for about 15 seconds.

I've made this recipe many times since it was posted. I found that if you heat the milk for a minute in the microwave, it is just the right temperature to melt the softened butter. I use only 4 cups of bread flour, but other than that I don't change the recipe. I baked a batch of these cinnamon rolls on Thursday, and they went so quickly that I had to make another batch on Friday. I think the quantity of frosting depends on what you like. My teenage daughter thought that the regular amount of frosting was too much, I thought it was just right. It is my favorite recipe, and a lot of people ask for it. The bread machine helps make the recipe a lot easier than doing it by hand.

I am a very novice baker, and I was so impressed at how amazing these turned out!! My boyfriend says they are better than cinnabon and the cream cheese frosting is perfect!! And you definitely don't need a bread machine... I just followed some of the other member suggestions. I will definitely make these again =)

This recipe truly is the best for cinnamon rolls.  I'm known among my friends and family as "the lady who makes the BEST cinnamon rolls".  The only change I make is to use only 2 Tbsp of cinnamon.  It is still VERY cinnamon-y.  Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.

I love this recipe!  it comes out perfectly everytime and I am a true novice when it comes to baking...I don't have a bread machine or a mixer, so i did it all by hand: I proofed the yeast with the white sugar for 10 minutes (I did NOT use the rapid rise).  I then mixed in the dry ingredients and set it aside and let it rise for about an hour.  I then rolled it out per the instructions and then let it double in size for another hour.  You won't regret the time you put into this!!!

The rolls were OK, but not like cinnabons. The rolls took much longer to rise than 30 minutes, didn't want to stay together after they were cut, and I did not care for the icing. I usually make more filling for my cinnamon rolls, and I think a plain powdered sugar icing complements the rolls much more.

This recipe is a hit by far.  It does take a while to prepare, but overall, its a not a hard recipe, its just that there is waiting time with the rising of the dough.  I start it early in the day so its ready to eat as a treat after the kids come home from school or dinner. These are the best cinnamon rolls ever.

Excellent!  I did not use bread machine, but put all together and let rise in oven for an hour at 200 and then baked per recipe.  They were all gone with 48hours!

Absolutely delicious!  A huge hit at home and work!  I don't have a bread machine, so I followed directions in reviews to make by hand and they came out perfect.  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent! I've made these many times with my bread maker and the dough is beautiful to look at. Then I just make the rolls as mentioned and bake them. The icing goes well with it and it's not too sweet. Nobody should buy cinnamon buns after making these.

These are AMAZING!  Making the dough in the bread machine takes a lot of the work out of the equation.  Even my Mom and Grandmother, both accomplished bakers, said these were the best they'd ever had.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe really is a clone of a cinnabon, I had hubby taste it with an actual cinnabon and he liked this one better, the only change I made was with the icing, I used caramel flavored cream cheese, which was awesome! Thanks for this great recipe!!!

Since there was no option for a 10 star rating, **********!  These were delicious!  I made them the day before, and let them sit in the fridge overnight. My family woke up the the smell of cinnabons.  I asked my husband to give me a rating, and he said "10". I did add raisins to the recipe for personal preference.  NUMMMMMMMMY!

MMMMMMMMMMMMMM! These are great thankyou! I didn't have an area large enough to roll it out so I split the dough into 2 sections rolled one at a time, my buns were about 5 inches in diameter...wonderful size and flavor!

OMG these are SOOOOO good!  I just got a bread machine for my christmas gift and the first thing I made were these cinnabons.  The dough is so nice and moist and the icing is just perfect!!!  This is my first time making a cinnabon. I had no idea that it could be this easy.   I'll definately be making more of these.  Thanks for such a fabulous recipe.

No matter what the grams of fat were everyone had 2 of these for breakfast. I would definetly make these again, my only complaint was the recipe did go into enough detail and I had the help of other cooks (aka moms) to help with the order the ingredients needed to go.

My husband made these Clone's last night, and they were wonderful! They have to be the best cinnamon rolls I've had, even the surpassing the "real" Cinnabons. We both took them to work this morning to share with others, and they were a big hit. Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely fantastic. Hands down the best cinnamon roll recipe I've ever tried. My husband said that they were better than cinnabon. And don't tell my mom, but they were better than her 'famous' cinnamon roll recipe!!

This recipe is AMAZING!! It was super easy and they turned out perfect! I had to convince my family that they weren't store bought! 
I didn't use a bread maker....just used the dry active yeast (letting the yeast activate is a must...I learned that the hard way :) ).

Excellent. We ate the first batch same day I made them and started the second that night. I've already emailed this recipe to all my friends. This one's a keeper.

They just had an odd taste, way too much filling.  I cut back on the cinnamon to 2 T, could probably cut back some more.  I did not have a problem w/ the filling becoming runny.  I did let them sit covered, in the fridge overnight.  In the morning I let them sit on the counter about 30 min before putting them in the oven.  I took many reviewers advice and lowered the temp... but that was taking waaayyyy to long, well over 25 min.

My 10 year old thinks these are better than Cinnabon. A bit time consuming but worth it.

Very, very good.  Wasn't an exact clone of the cinnabon, to me, but very tasty nonetheless. Using the bread machine made it very quick and easy. Thanks!

My family raved at how good these were.  I have been trying to get "the" cinnamon roll recipe, and this is it. I did add 1/2 cup more flour than in recipe though, probably from humidity.

Great and easy to make. I did not use a bread machine, hook attachmnet on my mixer worked fine. Made per recipe, turned out very nice, very tastee! I think for future cinnabons I will increase the filling mixture by 1/2 to add to the gooey cinnamon flavor I like. 
Thanks for a great recipe....took a picture they looked sooo nice.

5 Plus stars! Simply sinful calories I cant resist! Better than Cinnabon's since you can have as many as you want and as much frosting as you want!

I've made a lot of cinnamon rolls looking for something that comes close to cinnabon, and this is the closest I've found. The frosting is a dead on match, and the rolls are very close when they are still warm. The dough was very easy to work with although it sounded like it may have been a little hard on the machine. My bread machine is pretty low end though, so that could be the problem. These rolls are best while warm but if you have leftovers, make sure you put them in something airtight (tin foil was a bad idea. They were hard the next morning). Thanks for the great recipe! I'll be using this one a lot!

Way too sweet! And, I love sweet foods. This just had too much sugar and I have the insatiable need to brush my teeth. I say don't pack the brown sugar down when filling to 1 cup and since I followed reviewers suggestions and doubled the icing to 3 cups. Please use only 1 1/2 cups icing sugar even if doubling. All up four cups of sugar in 12 buns. Very, very sweet. Also, I tried dental floss to cut the roll into 12 and it didn't work. Using a standard bread knife worked fine.UPDATE: I had one of these cinnamon buns last night and all the rest are still uneaten! No one wants them (too sweet for hubby even and he has a huge sweet tooth) and I can see they will be in the fridge until I'm forced to get rid of them.

EXCELLENT! Used the bread machine for the dough, made the rolls, and put in fridge overnight. Also softened butter and mixed w/ cinnamon & brown sugar and spread on rolled out dough.

These are absolutely the best cinnamon rolls.  The bread is light and fluffy - not dense like some recipes I've tried.  The filling is the perfect amount of sweet and sticky. Brown sugar makes it so tasty! I make a batch of these cinnamon rolls to share with friends whenever someone has a baby, new house, etc.  It's so easy to make the dough in your breadmaker.

These are good. I am 5 months pregnant and I am sure that I sent this baby into sugar shock tonight.  I think I ate 4 of them.  OOPS!  I took some to my neighbors house and they said they were really good.  I do think that I would add a bit more cream cheese, but that is just because I love cream cheese.  I did not use a bread machine and I used regular flour and they still turned out well.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Great!! I added 1 tea almond extract and 1 Tbl orange zest. When rolls are a day or two old and need to be "freshened up" take a moist paper towel, wrap around roll, microwave for 20 sec.

A good cinnamon roll recipe but not a great Cinnabon clone -perhaps because differences exist between ovens and I didn't follow this perfectly....only closely. The texture is good out of the oven however as they cool they quickly get tough and the brown sugar turns to candy. The cinnamon swirl needs to remain more fluidlike. The icing recipe is not replicating that used by Cinnabon. The cream cheese is too rich. Cinnabon's icing is lighter and milder. This is a good cinnamon roll recipe but some adjustment needs to prevent them from turning to bricks once they cool.

was a little hesitant when the dough came out really tough, but I made the rolls almost to the recipe, I don't have a bread machine but made the dough by hand. My butter was also too hard and I over melted it in the microwave.  I think I rolled them the wrong way, the longer side, but once they baked they filled in width wise to match their hieght (make sence?) anyways, they came out amazingly close to cinnabon's, although maybe its just me getting older, but they seemed REALLY sweet, It has been about 10 years since I had the origanal though! In all I gave this 5 stars, they were easy to make and came out great! will make again, but will try making mini ones instead of large ones.
Thanks for a great recipe!!!!!!!!!! EDIT: I make these all the time; I line a pan with parchment, put the rolls in the pan and freeze right away. ( skipping a second rise) I take them out the night before and thaw overnight in the fridge, place pan in cold oven, then turn on the oven, they rise as the oven warms and then bake till golden. They aren't as good after freezing but I love having them on hand! The frosting freezes great as well. Thank you again for. A great recipe!!

I do not have a bread maker, but thought I would try anyway, and they turned out great!  I mixed warm milk, sugar and yeast together first, then added the rest of the ingredients just like with bread.  My husband likes gooey cinnamon buns, so extra brown sugar and cinnamon were added.  Excellent recipe!

These were great!  I made them for company and everyone raved.  They were so impressed with my cooking abilities...  and really, these are soo easy.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe...  my only tip is that you really have to put the icing on as soon as they are out of the oven.  Otherwise, it won't melt and it'll taste too sweet.  (We had leftovers, and when we reheated them, the icing was a little thick and too sweet.  We just heated them up a little more and they were still great.)

Absolutely amazing.  I had read the reviews, but now I'm a believer.  These were gooey perfection.  My husband swears they're better than the real thing - he ended up with a bellyache from eating too much.  Biggest hit at my house in a looong time.

Ok, I tried this again after leaving a bad review because the rolls were still doughy inside and overcooked outside with the Temp and Cooking time. This time, I decreased the T to 350, and raised the cooking time to 25 mn. Baked in muffin cups --> Delicious. Baked in pan --> still raw. Not as much as the 1st time though. So, if you cooker longer at a lower temp, and give them plenty of room to expand, they'll be awesome. Or else, they'll be raw and a disaster. And that was with 2 different ovens, one old and one brand new.

Wow!! This recipe is delicious! I followed a few other reviewers' suggestions, and here are the changes I made. The recipe tasted just fine using low fat butter/margarine and low fat cream cheese.  I baked the rolls in a 13x9 glass dish with 6 in each dish at 350 for 23 minutes.  I also set the dishes on the lower rack of my oven.  I used my bread machine, measured and greased the wax paper, and rolled the dough out as close as I could get to 16x21.  Roll the dough as tight as possible and they will hold together just fine.  I placed the shaped rolls in the fridge and covered overnight. This morning I let them sit out for half an hour and then baked them uncovered. When they were lightly browned, I loosened them with a spatula and turned the dish over, letting the rolls fall out upside down. This kept the gooey stuff on top of the rolls. I also doubled the frosting. MMM!  Absolutely heavenly!  I can't wait until next time my work has a breakfast! Ally

It tasted pretty good, but the bun is not as soft and chewy like the Cinnabon I've tasted (perhaps I over cooked the bun).  You can make ahead with this recipe and store in freezer: after cutting the roll into 12 pieces, individually wrap them in plastic and place in zip lock storage bag and leave in freezer.  To serve:  about 10 hours before serving (or the night before) take them out and unwrap from plastic and leave in cold oven to thraw.  Be sure to put them in an non stick container (silicone bakeware the best) and give enough room for them to rise the second time before cooking at 350 degree oven.

These take a long time to make, but they taste exactly like Cinnabon cinnamon rolls.  I split the dough into two equal pieces, rolled out each and made 2 dozen "Mini bons" that I included in treat baskets that I gave out for Christmas presents.  People have been begging me to make more ever since!

This is a wonderful recipe!  It's easy and fairly fast, though not as fast as stated here when using the dough cycle on my bread machine.

I increased the filling ingredients to 1-1/2 cups of brown sugar, 5 tbsp of cinnamon, and 1 stick of butter.  Additionally I added 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  I hate those cinnamon rolls that have skimpy fillings!  

When slicing the rolls, I sliced them thinner so that I ended up with 18 rolls instead of the 12 listed here.   They still rose very high, almost to the level of the pan!  Also, even though I did grease my pans as directed, they were a mess cleaning up because of the melted brown sugar.  Next time I will use parchment paper or silpat to line my pans.

With the increased amount of filling and the nuts added, these rolls came out perfect for our family!   They were filled with a decadent sticky, nutty, brown sugary goodness and sweet enough they were wonderful even without the  icing on them.

I will definitely use this recipe again, but will experiment using different fillings for some fun variations.

THE BEST BY FAR!  THIS IS A STANDARD RECIPIE FOR OUR HOUSE.  I USE IT FOR CINNAMON AND DINNER ROLLS.  WHEN I MAKE A BATCH OF THE DOUGH, I MEASURE OUT ADDITIONAL DRY INGREDIENTS TO PUT INTO ZIP BAGS.  THAT WAY WHEN I WANT TO MAKE MORE, I JUST PUT IT IN MY MIXER AND ADD THE LIQUIDS AND YEAST.  WORKS GREAT.

Fabulous recipe! A new favorite for our family! For those who have a pasta machine, we placed sections of the dough on the #3 setting and ran it through for a more even consistency than a rolling pin.  We also used a pizza cutter to make nice uniform edges and made slicing dough easier.  We made miniature cinnamon rolls which was a hit for the kids!  Reminded them of a certain drive-thru restaurants version...however much more delicious! Yielded about 20 mini cinni rolls.

WOW!! Stop searching for a cinn. roll recipe, this is it. Made these for the teachers for Teacher appreciation week. 
Made them the night before and let rise in the fridge. Do not be deceived by the lack of rising! I let these sit out for an hour with little change, but when I baked them they exploded!! Yummy Yummy Yummy!!

These are so good I've already made them twice. They're 98% the same as Cinnabon and the difference is is that these are better. Much better in fact. They don't have the nasty trans/cheap fat aftertaste the others have and they reheat much nicer than the originals without leaving grease on your plate or having the icing seperate. These are SO much better! I made two changes. The recipe calls for margarine in the dough and I used butter instead and I changed the cooking time to 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Also, they're even better with rasins. Soak the rasins in really hot water for about half an hour, drain and then sprinkle over the cinnamon mixture before rolling up.

These cinnamon rolls are incredible!  They are so close the real thing at $4 a piece, it's worth the time and effort to make them.  The first time I made them, I had used old yeast and all purpose flour, and they didn't rise and the filling fell out, but they were still really good.  The second time I made them, I used bread flour and just bought yeast, and they got huge, and the filling stayed inside the rolls, yummmm!  Thanks for the recipe Marsha!

These weren't bad although I highly recommend trying Cinnamon Rolls 111 by Miss Alix.  Myself and all who have tasted both recipes agree. They are also made in a bread machine but they really taste just like the cinnabons in the mall.

wow!  These were so good... even if they weren't identical to cinnabon, it doesn't matter.  I didn't have a bread machine so I melted the butter in the microwave, added the milk, warmed it again in the microwave, and then added the yeast.  I then put it in my kitchenaid mixer and added the other ingredients, then flour and it turned out great.  Thank you for sharing, I will definitely make these again!

My 8yr old daughter helped me make this and it turned out awsome!  The dough is very easy to work with and the frosting is out of this world!  We prepared them the night before and baked them on a Sunday morning. This method works great, just bring them back up to room temp before baking.  We wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars based only on the filling & frosting.  I had to make favors for a baby shower and made mini cinnabuns & tagged them "Thank you from 'name's' little bun in the oven!"  I used packaged crescent roll dough (flattened out, filled, then rolled) and cut each pkg. into 10 rolls.  I used the butter, filling, baked them & also used this frosting.  They were a HUGE hit with each of the 60 guests!  I still get compliments on how yummy the mini-buns were!

I must have done something wrong based on all the fabulous reviews that this receipe received.  I thought that I followed the recipe to the letter and while the rolls were tasty, mine were nothing near to a Cinnabon.  The roll turned out too hard -- I don't know if I would try this recipe again.

I didn't think these were very 'cinnabonish' but they were absolutely delicious none the less.  I think they might even be better than Cinnabon.

This recipe is fantastic!  By far the best cinnamon rolls I have made.  I did not have a bread machine, but followed the advice of other reviews and let the dough rise in the oven.  It works perfectly.  The only change I would suggest is to cut back a little on the amount of butter for the filling.  I would not double the amount of icing, as others have suggested, I found this amount to be more than enough.  Other than that, these are perfect and they smell SOOO good when they're cooking!  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe. I got 2 dozen rolls from it.  I added one tsp of vital gluten per cup of flour, made the dough the night before, let it rise in the fridge and then baked it in the morning.

These are SO good!!  I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and baked them at 375, but be careful that you bake them long enough.  Mine were a little doughy.  But definitely a keeper!!

My bread machine incorporates preheat  into the dough setting, so I just threw everything in the night before and was 1/2 way done when I woke up in the morning.  Definately a crowd pleaser! My husband even ate the leftovers cold!

This is excellent, and although time consuming, it is fairly easy to prepare. A great treat to impress boss, coworkers, neighbors, etc. My mom has asked me to make these for her twice to take to her employees. Try not to overcook.

Very very Good!! The cream cheese icing on these is to die for.  I think next time i may make the dough by hand, my bread machine doesn't produce a very tender dough.  Over all, this is the recipe I use from now on for cinnamon rolls!!

These are awesome!!! I have made cinnamon rolls for 25 years and never had anything like this. Very easy to make but will burn the tops if you bake at 400. Thank you for sharing such a GREAT recipe.

I think these are excellent but my kids preferred the preservative laden grocery store variety.  My wife thought they were not cooked long enough.

Delicious!  I added walnuts to the cinnamon mixture, too.  These were so yummy!  My family is already asking when I'll be making them again!  No need for a bread machine, this can be done by hand.

I made these for Christmas morning and they are perfect! Just the rich dough and sweetness I was looking for! The next time I will bake longer at a lower heat to make sure they cook all the way through the middle, but besides that they're fantastic!

WoW!  I am the world's biggest cinnamon roll fan and ALWAYS got just Cinnabons (no other cinnamon roll compared!)  Not any more!!!  These are out of this world.  I baked half of them today and are saving the rest for tomorrow, for fresh cinnamon rolls in the morning.  Thank you so much for sharing such a terrific recipe!
P.S. What a great gift idea ... make the rolls up until the baking point and refrigerate (or freeze, depending on how long until gift-giving), and make the frosting.  Then put 6 or so unbaked rolls in a box, put the frosting in a little jar inside of the box, and write out baking instructions on a card and put on top of the box.  I used a small department store box and lined the inside with wax paper.  It looks adorable and what a great gift!

I have made these about 5 times now and everyone loves them!  I found the dough relatively easy to work with and there was plenty of icing.  I love them without the cream cheese icing but they are even better with icing.  They are a great treat

I had to become a member so I could comment on this great recipe.  I'm new to making breads and the Amish White Bread from this site was all I had done up to this point.  I followed this recipe precisely and it came out perfectly.  I was very impressed and so were those who ate it.  I've made it three times now all by hand -- no machine whatsoever.  A few hints for those, like me, who are new to working with dough:
Use wax paper between the rolling pin and dough to roll quickly.
If kneading by hand, highly active yeast and regular yeast both worked for me.
Line pan with wax paper for easy cleaning.
Drizzle icing carefully over evenly spaced rolls  (and not on the pan) or else make a bit more icing.
Thanks Marsha for a great recipe!

I made a pan of these yesterday and my husband went nuts over them!  He claimed they didn't even need butter.  He puts butter on ALL his rolls!  I made a second pan last night to bring to a picnic today and I had four people ask for the recipe, including two single men!  They loved them.  This is a keeper in my recipe box!  Marsha, you did a great job with this one!  Thanks!

I have another "Cinnabon" recipe that is awesome, but it takes hours to prepare.  This recipe is equally delicious, but takes only a fraction of the time because it uses the bread machine. If your family loves cinnamon rolls, you've got to try this one. BRAVO!! Thank you, Marsha, for sharing such a great recipe with us!

Just like the Cinnabon rolls at the mall! My family loves these rolls and I'll definitely make them again. Only caveat: for the icing, don't beat until fluffy, but simply stir, the ingredients together, making sure cream cheese and butter are softened to room temperature. Stirring makes it more like icing than frosting and, therefore, more like the icing on Cinnabons.

My kids liked Cinnabon better but my husband and I thought it was close enough without having to travel 30 miles to the mall.  I'm the worst at being patient with dough, I liked dumping everything into my bread machine, it was a little dry and I will adjust the next time I make it.

Very good! I did the cinnamon sugar part different mixing melted butter, light brown sugar, and cinnamon together and spread that on the dough. I then sprinkled some regular cinnamon sugar mix on tip of the rolls before placing in the oven (I luuuuuuv cinnamon!). Since I had no cream cheese I made a simple icing of butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla. So good!
**Added Note** I use the dough part of this recipe for dinner rolls all the time now. They are fantastic!

It was easy. Which is great for me because I have never made cinnamon rolls before. Although I am not a fan of cream cheese, the icing on the warm buns is delicious!  I will definitely use this recipe again!  Thank you Martha!

Omg!! To die for!!  So light and fluffy!  Only thing I would do is thin the icing to spread a little nicer.
I used my kitchenaid mixer, not bread machine.

Woke up and wanted something spectacular, these fit the bill. 1st try, they are wonderful, didn't know that I was such a good cook, thanks for this great recipe. have mailed it to all my sister in laws. Divided into 3 square pans of 4, shared with Aunt and Brother. These are really this best, can't tell them from the original Cinnabons, (2006)
Just want to add, it's now 5/2017 and I'm still using this recipe, it's the best every time, even my neighbors want to know when I'm baking again. Nothing says "I love you" like a warm pan of these wonderful delicious rolls.

Really weren't as great as cinnabons. Tasted ok. I had to knead them by hand, but I don't think this made the difference too much. Overall I was disappointed.

I do not have a bread machine but I proof the yeast then mix all together & I use self rising flour & roll out & up then cut & leave them to rise covered for 1hr then cook they always turn out amazing & as for the frosting since our family doesn't like it super sweet I stick with the recommended amount of powdered sugar but add way more cream cheese & vanilla to taste

I've altered this recipe to make it VEGAN and it's amazing! Use water instead of milk or your favorite milk replacer like soy milk. Also, Earth Balance instead of traditional butter, 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of eggs and Tofutti cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese. Best vegan cinnamon rolls I've ever had!

These rolls are fabulous.  I can't believe I made these myself!  I followed the advice of Shannontheshe: after sprinkling the sugar and cinnamin mixture, i rolled it with the roller pin.  I was also very careful when I rolled up the dough.  They turned out fantastic.  We probably all gained a couple of pounds....  So I won't be making these too often but will definitely save the recipe next time I want to impress.

Delicious! I absolutely dislike store-bought cinnamon rolls, so for years I've never eaten this amazing treat. I decided to give this recipe a try, and am so glad I did. Definitely no store bought rolls in the future, but I will certainly make this recipe again.

Old stupid here, mixed the cinnamon and brown sugar in with the flour. I'm bad about not reading directions.  Also, it didn't seem like there was enough flour using 4 1/2 cups.  Prob because of the sugar and cinnamon.  I'll try to bake these even if I messed up.  Might have started something new!  (I doubt it)

I thought this recipe was great, just the right amount of sweetness and still has the hearty flavor of a real cinnabon. I think next time I will try to thicken up the cinnamon part though.

This was simple, fragrant, visually attractive, incredible tasting, and overall super-easy to make. I added some chopped pecans because I like them, but the recipe doesn't need it.

Turned out fine, I just didn't like them.  It's too much.  Prefer the biscuit ones I make in muffin tins.  But if you're a fan of cinnabon's, you'll like these.

This recipe tastes exactly like a Cinnabon cinnamon roll! (And that's according to 4 long time Cinnabon lovers.) Very simple, at least if you have a bread machine. Threw all the dough ingredients in, and set it to dough. 1 hour and 40 minutes later, perfect dough, and the rest was a breeze. I will definitely be making these again!

This recipe is awesome! I will definitely make it again. There were some helpful reviews that I used. 1) I combined the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter to make the spread. 2) I made the cinnamon rolls the night before and stored them in the glass baking pan (covered with plastic wrap). Then I put them in the oven the next morning. They turned out great, just needed a couple extra minutes of baking time. 
It was a tad on the sweet side so it went really well with tea and coffee. The next time I make them I think I will reduce the sugar a little for the cinnamon spread and icing and see how that turns out.
Thanks for the recipe, its awesome!

Though not cinnabon cinnamon rolls, wonderful recipe. Got lots of good feedback from fellow students and teachers as well. 

I had a problem with the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture slightly spilling from the rolls, and got a nearly burnt and caramelized bottom. Does anyone have any suggestions to keep it in place to get a softer bottom?

I absolutely loooooveeee this recipe! Every time I've made them everyone was really impressed.
I didn't add the icing cause I feel like it's a little over-the-top sweet, but that just comes down to personal preference. :)
The only negative point is that it takes a while to make but it's totally worth it. (Plus most of the time you're waiting for the dough, so you can do other things meanwhile.)
Also, they dry up quite quickly, so keep them inside a plastic bag or something, either way it isn't much of a problem anyways since everyone eats them so fast ^_^
Definite, no doubt, 5 stars, I'd give it 6 if I could.

These cinnamon rolls are some of the best I've ever had! Soft and sweet, but not too sweet! The frosting is what makes them amazing. :) I made no alterations to the recipe and they came out perfectly!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was wonderful. Light and fluffy, sweet and flavorful. When I pulled the dough out of the bread machine, I wanted to lay on it like a pillow; it was so smooth and airy. I made it a second time the next day and made some changes to suit our family's taste. We don't like our rolls quite so sweet, although my friends who ate it as written raved about it! This time, I used only 1/4 cup sugar in the dough, and I used half the frosting. I also prepared in the night before and cooked it the next morning. For our family, this slightly less sweet variation was perfection, although it was awesome to begin with. I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe is truly amazing! Loads of sugar but I loved it anyway. I read through lots of reviews and they totally helped. I recommend blending the sugar/cinnamon mix with the butter and spread it like that like someone pointed out. Next time I think I wont use all of the frosting like I did and I will use a larger baking dish as the buns rose to high, they popped out! Superb! Thanks alot :)

This is an easy, simple and quick recipe; however I had to add some more flour and added some vanilla extract to the frosting.

First, I am only giving it 3 stars because they did not cook all the way through at 400 for 15 minutes. The middle roll was still very very doughy. Not sure if I need to increase the time and reduce the temp next time - but I will make these again.
Otherwise, the end rolls and tops were beautiful, and very tasty!!! The dough rose beautifully and the (cooked) pastry was not hard or brick like (as stated by other reviewers. I did use a bread machine, and did let them rise again in the pan.

Pretty good.  Just wish I could get the filling to be a little more gooier and not so gritty from the sugar.

I think these cinnamon rolls would taste more like the real Cinnabon if the special cinnamon that Cinnabon shops sell was used.  I've used this cinnamon with other cinnamon rolls I've made in the past and it does make a big difference.

Review is for the bread/dough portion only because I've only used this recipe for the dough. Really good dough! I use butter instead of margarine.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it. My husband, friends, coworkers all rave about these. I used butter instead of margarine. I usually make these the night before and put them in the fridge. I do this right after putting them in the 9x11 pan (no need to let it sit 30 more min). Then I put the pan in a cold oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Let it cook for 25-30 min.

I'm rating the recipe based on the dough and frosting. I used a different filling. I did what one of the other posters said for making it without a bread machine. I have a kitchen aid stand mixer! I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour. I accidentally put the melted butter in my dough... Oops!!! It still came out delicious, chewy, doughy, goodness! I could have gotten about 20 rolls but the dough started to dry too much and was difficult to roll out. The frosting!!!!! OMG! I will use that one all the time! I doubled it so I have a bunch left over in my fridge! Yum

The women in my family have tried a LOT of cinnamon roll recipes over the years. I first tried this recipe for Easter about 4 years ago, and I'm happy to report we haven't tried any other recipes since. This is THE one. I use butter instead of margarine, and regular white flour instead of bread flour. If you don't have a bread machine (I don't), be sure to read the "Most Helpful Positive Review" from 2004, which explains how to make it without a bread machine!

Outstanding. I had never made anything that required activating yeast so was a little intimidated. Used a modification for non-bread machine. It took a little longer to rise so I used the proof setting on my oven. They were a huge hit - shared with the neighbourhood.

I've tried many cinnamon roll recipes and never had problems, but I couldn't get this one to work. I think the issue could have been that it didn't call for enough yeast, they just didn't rise correctly and the dough was very rubbery and required over 1/2 cup more than it called for in order to be able to roll it. I baked them 20 Min in a 400 degree oven, and when  my husband bit in, it was doughy inside. Disappointed.

Holy cow are these good! I don't have a bread machine so I followed the following advice from ANDYTAMI..."Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl. Mix in the sugar, margarine, salt, and eggs. Add flour and mix well. Knead the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with flour. Put in a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Then pick up with rolling out the dough." This was very helpful and the rolls turned out delicious! I used butter instead of margarine because I always buy butter. Very very good!! Thanks for this keeper recipe!

These are fantastic. My husband loved them and so did our guests. I followed recipe 99%. The one thing I did do that a review recommended was I mixed the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon all together and then spread that on the dough. I didn't have an issue with the filling dripping to the bottom either. Thanks for a great recipe, one that I need to go work off now. :)

Great recipe! Very little hands-on time. I put the ingredients in my bread machine, turned it on the dough setting and left for about 1 1/2 hrs. When I came home, the dough was ready to roll out. Following a review, I refrigerated the buns overnight. This morning I put them in a cold oven, then turned it on 400. They were done in approx. 25 mins. I immediately turned them out onto a cookie sheet so the filling could run down over them. They turned out perfect! These are scrumptious with or without icing! My family loved them. Great for busy moms. Thanks for sharing!

These cinnamon rolls are DELICIOUS. I made a pan of 12 and ended up freezing 10 of them. Out of the freezer I put them in the microwave on low for 60 seconds and they are still quite delicious.

Incredible.  That awesome middle bite is exactly as delicious as a Cinnabon.  I messed up and added the cinnamon and butter that was supposed to go in the middle in to the dough (which I made in my Kitchenaid mixer).  To compensate I used less sugar, butter and cinnamon in the middle.  They still came out amazing.  The icing is delectable too.  This is one of those things that I can't believe came out of my kitchen.  Will definitely be making it on holidays and special occasions in the future.  Thanks for sharing!!!
Update:
Made these with 2 1/2 cups oat flour and 2 white, 1/2 cup ground flax seed, and subbed nonfat Greek yogurt for half of the butter to try to make them a little more nutritious, and they were just as good.

Living in Italy, I really can't complain about the food. But.. there are those days when I REALLY miss a good cinnamon roll or a Real freshly made doughnut and there are no chance to have them here. For this reason I kept on trying cinnamon rolls recipes ( doughnuts are more difficult because of the frying). Until now. Ok, This is the one. I read the recipe and many reviews, then I decide to make it just as stated originally. Those were just PERFECT! We were having a little BD party for my youngest just turned 2, and these rolls were gone in 5 minutes. I cut them using a piece of kitchen cord, like somebody told me to do, and made them big, then I let them rest in the baking sheet - on a silpat- ( too many-too big for the pan stated) for a couple of hours because I had other cakes in the oven. They grew.. perfectly. didn't fall apart. they were PERFECT! 15 minutes and were golden, fully cooked but still SOFT just like a cinnabon... for truly perfect cloning I have to work on the glaze, but even if I felt them little differing from the cinnabon, I can't understand the difference because these ARE SO GOOD!!!!!

I've been using this recipe for years. My husband is a diabetic and I replace the brown sugar with Splenda brown sugar for baking and it works perfectly. In the dough, I use Splenda white for baking but 1/2 it with regular sugar to feed the yeast. Turns out well every time :)

This is the second time making this recipe, and the only change I have made is 2 tablespoons more of melted butter (made a big difference for me in flavor) and baking time and temp., I baked them at 350 F for 23 minutes and they were perfect! Would not change anything else- absolutely loved them.

I did the recipe for 40. Everyone who had one said they were better than Cinnabon! I did one thing different than the recipe recommened.  I added about 1 cup of additional butter. This turn the. Cinnimon and brown sugar into an icing type substance, which I then spread with a spatuala! Mmmm good!!

I LOVE cinnamon.  On everything!  So I was surprised to discover that this recipe has too much for my liking.  I didn't think that was possible.  Now I know that it is.  My husband agrees.  We love everything else about the rolls, so I will make these again.  But I will decrease the cinnamon by half.  Maybe they meant teaspoons instead or tablespoons?  Also we used bread flour, as the recipe calls for to get that chewy texture.  Yum!

These are absolutely phenomenal! I have made these three times in the past few months and can usually get 16 very nicely-sized rolls out of this recipe (about 5" wide and 1.5" tall). The icing as per the recipe is enough to cover 16 as well. I've never had a Cinnabon, but now I don't need to. These are incredibly delicious!!! Thank you!

absolutely fantastic - I make them often, following the  recipe exactly. The dough hardly ever rises well but I just leave them for the rise time suggested and keep going as though they did rise! They bake absolutely wonderfully and are gone almost instantly!!

I have made these more times than I can count.  The entire family (kids and grandkids) love them.
I would love to get some Indonesian cinnamon for them though.

This is so delicious!  I do recommend baking at 350 instead as 400 always seemed to burn my edges too much if I wanted them to cook properly on the inside.

I made these without using a bread machine. Everything in the recipe worked perfectly and the cinnamon rolls tasted amazing. I don't normally have a sweet tooth, but I had to give them away so I wouldn't eat the whole pan! Needless to say I am now the family cinnamon roll supplier. Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

This makes great cinnamon rolls, but make sure the bottoms are done.  I cooked at 400 degrees for 15 min, and the tops were brown, but the bottoms weren't done.  (It might be because I used a glass pan.)  They were still stretchy dough on the bottom halves.  I will cook them at 350 degrees for 20-30 min next time.  It's strange, but even though they were doughy, they disappeared within minutes.  I didn't even get one at the party I took them to.~  Thanks, Marsha!

Best cinnamon rolls, by far. They were perfectly sweet and crispy on the edges, but soft in the center. The icing was really good too, although a bit too decadent, when left sitting for a little while it is better. My family loved it, I even took some over to the neighbors who raved about them. Great Recipe Marsha. Will definitely make again.

Made this with Ideal for the brown sugar mix as well as the confectioners sugar.  Left regular sugar in the dough so the yeast would have something to eat.  Turned out really great.  The Ideal brown doesnt melt the same so its not as 'gooie' but still a very tasty product!

I haven't had a Cinnabon in awhile so I can't compare, but these are fabulous!  I added walnuts (made them for my mother-in-law who loves nuts) and sliced them into 20 rolls.  Even so, I could have made 1/2 the glaze and it would have been plenty!

LOVED this recipe.  It turns out perfectly each time! I prefer to divide the dough in half, working with half at a time, and making 24 rolls.  Bake them in muffin tins for individual rolls that look beautiful every time.

This is a fantastic recipe.  One of the other reviewers suggested flipping the rolls over so that the filling drizzles back into the rolls. I did and OMG they are good!!!  Ooey gooey good.  Thank you for the recipe and suggestion.  Will definitely be making these again.

I have made these several times, and I have to say that they come out not as soft as I would like them to be.  The next day they seem like "day old" bakery, which isn't what I want in a cinnamon roll.  I've seen a recipe that calls for instant vanilla pudding instead of the sugar and would like to try that sometime.

Not entirely like the original Cinabon, but a pretty good recipe! We'll definitely be using it again. Maybe next time brush some butter on the tops of each - the first try kindof turned out a bit dry (without the frosting)

I have made these 2 times now, very good first time. I didn't use my bread machine I did them by hand. 2 time I used bread machine to make my dough. I had more control over my bread dough by hand, they turned out WAY better! I didn't care for the dough made in my machine, it was tougher and didn't rise well. But they were sooo good first time. I'll leave machine out of it next time.

I love this recipe!!! It's a little labour intensive if you want to make it in the same day. But with other's suggestions, I made them last night, and baked them this morning. 
Fan-Freaking-Tastic! 
This is the 2nd time this week I've made these. Next time I think I'll make this in my Kitchen Aid mixer instead of the bread maker, just to see the difference. 
This is going to become one of my staple recipes. No other cinnamon bun recipes will do ever again.
And you can half the amount of icing to make, it doesn't really need that much.
A-Ma-Zing!!!!

Finally made this recipe and don't know why I waited so long! It is awesome. Did not change one thing, except followed reveiws on how to make without bread machine. I did double the frosting as another reviewer mentioned, but didn't use it all and will only make what is called for next time. And there will be a next time!

I used 1 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon and that was perfect for us. i also used store bought frosting and it was still very good.

Awesome.  I made these without the bread machine using the 8 gram package of yeast and turned out perfectly. I refrigerated them overnight and baked them in individual muffin tins.

This is such an easy recipe and so delicious.  I make my dough in my kitchen aid mixer and then let it rise for 45 minutes.  Then, I follow the recipe starting with #2.  I made it the first time with the cream cheese icing which was delicious but way too sweet for us.  So, now I make a glaze and drizzle it over the top.  The glaze consists of 1 c powdered sugar, 3 tbsp heavy cream, 1 tsp vanilla or almond extract.  With the glaze, they are even better!!!!

OH MY GOD. These were so good! I made them with all I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and I definitely recommend- as a reviewer suggested- letting it rise in an oven set to 200 degrees of you don't have a bread machine. Leaving it to rise on its own didnt particularly work for me, unless of course you let it rise in a warm room.

I used frozen bread dough for this recipe which was easier I'm sure I didn't get the full effect of the recipe here but it was very good for my first time doing these type of rolls. The icing in this recipe was wonderful, I love it and can see how it can also be used to icing cup cakes too.

These are delicious! I was a bit skeptical at first because the cinnamon buns from Cinnabon are so good! But, once they were all done and the icing was drizzled on, they tasted exactly like the real deal! I highly recommend these!

What a wonderful recipe, I did not have bread flour and used all purpose and they came out wonderful--better than cinnabon if you ask me. I also love the frosting.  Thanks for sharing.

Best. Thing. Ever. Seriously. 

The only time it didn't come out well was when I wanted to make it ahead of time and then bake later. That was a disaster. But, otherwise, amazing.

GREAT recipe.  I have made 3 batches of these now, to the delight of everyone who eats them, including myself!  I have varied the recipe just a little.  Instead of milk, I use buttermilk, and I add a tablespoon of cinnamon to the frosting mix.  They are truly delicious, I am so impressed.

These were terrific.  I used butter because I never have margarine in the house and I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese again because that is what I had in the house.  I will definately make again.

These are absolutely delicious! The first time I made them, I was amazed at how perfect they turned out. I had made cinnamon rolls before, and they were pretty good, but these...these are fantastic! I will never go back to my old recipe. The dough turns out perfect in the bread maker every time, and is so easy to work with. It's a fairly simple recipe, and the end result is sweet heavenly goodness!

Yummy :) The cinnamon-sugar mixture did end up running a little, I tried the whole turning over thing and that did help a tiny bit, but then all of the brown sugar glazed over the top of the buns and kind of made them look messy. I easily scooped up the excess mixture with a spoons and placed it on top of the rolls making sure to get most of it on the inside. Everybody loved these and said they were better than the ones at Cinnabon. Makes plenty of frosting, so don't be greedy ;) Thank you, Marsha for this recipe. These are awesome.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have EVER had--just the right amount of sweetness, and the density is perfect. I wrapped extras in wax paper and put them in the freezer (along with baggies of the icing). On Friday nights I can take a couple out to thaw, and bake them fresh on Saturday mornings.

I finally made bread!!!  And these were incredible.  I have always avoided bread because it is hard for me to get the bread to rise - I never get the liquid at the right temp.  But this time I did it right and put the dough into a bowl in a closed oven with a boiled pot of hot water sitting next to it.  Worked like a charm!  The bread popped right up!

These were really good!  I used all-purpose flour since I did not have bread flour and they turned out better than I expected.  I also took the advice from another reviewer and flipped them onto wax paper as soon as I took them out of the oven, and the cinnamon mixture stayed in the rolls.  Thank you for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!! I made them exactly as desribed with two minor changes. The first is I did as suggested by someone before and flipped them over right out of the oven to allow the cinnamon to go back through the bun. The second was they were so good that I did not have time to frost them because everyone ate them!! I will be making these ALOT!

Very disappointed. It may not be the recipes fault however. There are 4,652 reviews as I write this. I was trying to avoid the 3+ hours wait time for what I have been dreaming of for some time. I either do not comfortably know how to make basic bread dough or realize now that the use of the bread machine would have perhaps made this oops proof. I tried following the top rated reviews on not using the machine. The dough came out dry and never fully rose. I combined the cinn, sugar and butter and spread the now paste onto the dough. Rolled, cut and baked for 20 mins. Though they smell yummy and are gooey, they never got much bigger than they started. I've extended the cook time 4 more mins, then 3 more mins...they have gotten a little bigger but I am worried about a bitter or burnt taste from the filling being over cooked. I may try to remake these with the machine, but for now, extremely disappointed. ALSO, no one mentioned successfully cutting the recipe in half due to a possible size issue in the bread machine from 4+C up flour. All my basic dough recipes in the machine book state 2ish cups... concern?

OMG These were sinful!  Sooo good.  Made with all purpose flour instead of bread flour.  The rolls were still remarkably light and airy.  Don't need to make so much frosting.  Next time would half the frosting and reduce the confectioner's sugar to 1/3 c.  These would make fabulous bake sale items.

I had to throw this out.  I made the oven version and it came out very hard and not very sweet.

I followed this recipe exactly, and the cinnamon rolls came out perfectly.  My family absolutely loved them, and I make them every few weeks now.  So much cheaper than buying them at the mall.

I was afraid that the recipe called for too much cinnamon and another reviewer complained about the sour cream frosting. I made it according to the ingredients and I'm not a yeast type baker but it turned out delicious! I did change the baking temperature to 375 for 18 minutes and the rolls weren't too brown and hard on the outside.

I absolutely hate cinnamon (scent, taste, etc.) and made these instead for my husband. Mind you, I've never made cinnamon rolls before and these came out delicious and tender! Shockingly, I tried one and hell hath frozen over - I liked it! I didn't make the frosting with the last batch, but they really don't need it. :)

I made the recipe with one subsitution (I used margarine only, no butter) and they came out PERFECT. It took longer than 30 minutes for them to double in size, but that was not an issue. By the time I was ready to bake them, they were all snug in the pan.  Better than getting them from a bakery! My family was in heaven and is begging me to make them again.  I will definitely make these yummy cinnamon rolls again. :)

Great recipe! I don't have a bread maker so it's a little more work in the front end but totally worth it! Someone has already posted how to make these without a bread machine, thank you!!

Sinfully delicious! I had never used yeast before, made bread, or anything like that. This recipe was super easy and I had no problems at all. I make almost double of the sugar mixture because we love them sweet, and we also make double the buttercream icing...yum! We usually have extra rolls, so I freeze them after the cool, and they warm up really well. You cannot go wrong with these amazing cinnamon rolls...you will have the neighbors coming over to see what smells so darn good!

tastes awesome! .. to start with the dough, mixed and kneaded it with my own hands, took 2 hrs to raise, didn't double, however that didnt really matter as the Cinnabons turned out PERFECT! as other reviewers suggested, i did cook it at a lower temperature than suggested and for a longer time. Used sour cream for the frosting (very nice, creamy, and thin, unlike cream cheese would be!) but its the matter of preference. I would suggest cutting the dough spread and roll each bun separately, what's the trick? cutting the dough into triangles, it would prevent the center from popping out :) just an option!
ohh, i ve made 24 smaller buns rather than 12 large.. in any case, wonderful recipe! thank you! its a gold mine for the Cinnabon addict who lives in a place where there's no Cinnabon branch :)))

I am very happy with these.  In the past I have made sweet dough with a bread maker and it not turned out.  This time I made it by hand and it worked wonderfully.  I was, however a little dissappointed with the filling running out.  In the future i will just tweek it to work for me.

The are absolutely amazing!  I make them at least once a month now!  Thank you very for sharing this great recipe.

I have modified it slightly:
I used all whole wheat flour
I use 1 cup of molasses, 1/2 cup butter, and 2 TBS (or a bit less) of cinnamon, for the filling.
I do not use a bread machine, just my hands.

Amazing!

So many ratings, so i'll keep it short. The only reason why I gave this 4 and not 5 was because to me, it needed more cinnamon goo center! After baking, the inside carmelized up a bit and with Cinnabons, they don't harden up.  If there was a way that they could keep soft after a day, that would be great! Flavor of the inside was perfect and this recipe is so easy.  I had wanted to make cinnamon rolls for awhile, but was concerned about how difficult they were, with this recipe, it was simple!

Currently my favorite cinnamon bun recipe. It's easy to make. (I don't use the breadmachine version, but make my own dough.) I love the filling. With this amount of brown sugar, it's a mix of crunchy and "juicy" when you bite into the bun. The icing is very good and easy to make. I just love it. Family and friends love it. A couple of things: 1. I have to bake for just about 38 minutes at 350 degrees. I have to continue to adjust temp. I also weigh my flour for consistency of outcome. 3 cups equals about 1 lbs.

This was fabulous... once I made it a couple of times and changed a few things! I use my bosch (don't have a bread machine) to mix the dough in, and found myself with only active dry yeast, so I added just a pinch more yeast, and about 1/8 tsp cinnamon to the actual dough, with closer to 4 cups of flour (I add it a little at a time and stop when the dough starts pulling away from the sides of the mixing bowl) and had to let it raise longer. I also found the cinnamon for the filling was way too much. I cut it down to just under 2 tablespoons, as well as used a whole stick of butter to spread on the rolled out dough. I also pulled them out once they just start to turn golden rather than golden brown, otherwise they seemed overdone.

Easy recipe ingredient wise. Not very good though. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I followed the directions exactly and the rolls came out to yeasty flavor wise. Also, the rolling directions weren't very clear. I had to look up elsewhere which direction I had to roll them. The filling didn't stay in the rolls (maybe I didn't roll tight enough??) and there wasn't very much flavor. There's also no way all those rolls would fit into a 9x13 casserole..... All this being said, I have never made cinnamon rolls before or used a bread machine, so it's quite possibly operator error! I will be trying this again. *I did find the frosting quite tasty, but it's kinda hard to screw that up! Hahaha*

These were AMAZING.  They're really rich, and my family polished them off over a weekend.  I did have the small trouble of the top drying out a bit, even though I turned them over as soon as I took them out of the over, but that didn't take away from the deliciousness.

This recipe is far superior over any of the other recipes I have gone through twenty different batches to find the one that stood out from the others. This recipe is amazing I made two batches and within the hour of taking them out my whole family devoured them.

These are awesome.  It makes way more icing than needed though (my daughter would disagree with me though).  I halved the icing portion and found there was still plenty to ice them all.

My husband loves these, me not so much but then I am not the pastry eater in the family. I make the batch and then freeze them in blocks of two. My hubby takes it out of the freezer pops it in the microwave for about 35 seconds, when he runs out I have to make again. Great treat.

I like a lot of cinnamon in a cinnamon roll. I am wondering how it would affect my dough if I put a teaspoon or two of cinnamon in my flour before mixing it to rise. Would it negatively affect my yeast or anything??? Help! Frosting is amazing and love the recipe... Awaiting on my dough to finish rising so I can bake it.

The recipe was great but it took a long time to make.  The bread machine took an hour and a half just to make the dough.  rolling out the dough took a while. then trying to roll up the dough/ cinnamon mixture was a slow process because to dough was delicate.  However my husband loved them!

Amazing! Didn't change a thing! I do find it easier to separate them and then frost them so that the frosting drips down the sides of each roll.

Excellent. Everyone in my Family in Christ love it. We prefer less sugar. So, I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 tablespoon ground cinnamon to sprinkle evenly on the dough.

These were good, but time consuming.  Not exactly like a Cinnabon, but they were a nice cinnamon roll.  Will I make them again?  Perhaps, when my children are grown and I have a lot of time on my hands :)

This turned out perfect.  I took one of the readers suggestions and mixed the butter, sugar and cinnamon all together and spread it on the dough.  It was amazing.  I will definately make again for sure.

Very delicious.  Used the helpful suggestion about how to make it without a bread machine as I don't have one.  The frosting was a little too cheesecake for our tastes, but still very yummy.  I'll file this recipe away for sure!

I just made these for the second time, and I swear, I don't think I'll ever be able to bring myself to buy another Cinnabon, these are so AMAZING!  No bread machine, proofed the yeast in the warm milk with half the sugar, mixed the other wet ingredients with the proofed yeast and then flour...kneaded, let rise for about an hour then rolled out...Did I mention they are AMAZING??

I wish these were more gooey.  There wasn't much oozy, drippy cinnamon goodness inside.  The dough itself was great, though.  Next time, I'll double the filling (butter/brown sugar/cinnamon) and see if that helps.  I'll also double the frosting, and a couple reviewers also added a package of unprepared vanilla instant pudding to make it taste just like Cinnabon.

I love these!  My girls love them!  My husband loves them!  Right after hitting up the local Cinnabon I had to come home and make some of my own.  They are moist, fluffy, tasty, and I know what all the ingredients are when I make them.

perfect dough in breadmaker; did not change a thing.  For the filling, I spread margarine on the rolled dough and then sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar.  Made the cream cheese frosting with margarine and low fat cream cheese with lots of icing sugar, the vanilla will darken the icing, but its worth it.. not sure why the salt is necessary in the icing, but I did it anyways.  GINORMOUS rolls!  Pics to follow!

These are simply the best!!! I made the dough like you would make normal bread. I added vanilla instant pudding mix (not prepared) into dry ingredients. In the filling dark brown sugar, butter and vanilla, chopped walnuts and raisins:) my husband took them to work and people were eating two & three rolls each!!!Do it for holiday breakfast, you won't be sorry!

These got good reviews from my classmates, but I wasn't necessarily a fan.  The dough was not as easy to work with as other recipe's I've tried.  Also, there was a LOT of sugar/butter in the middles.  Just a little too sweet for me.  Again, they're pretty good, but not really worth the calories.

OMG!!!  You aren't kidding, these are EXACTLY like going to cinnabon.  I used the bread machine to do the dough and it was perfect, the best icing ever!  I will make a double batch next time so I can make them fatter and thicker, my hubby LOVES them.  Thanks a ton.

I can't say I have ever had a Cinnabon cinnamon roll, but why bother when you can make these? These are my new go-to overnight cinnamon roll. I did not use a bread machine, and froze them for a weekend in wine country with the girls.  I thawed them in a cooler on the way, then overnight in the fridge.  Put them in a cold oven set to 400 and baked for 15 mins.  They could have used a touch more baking time although the tops were brown enough.  The bottoms were a bit doughy (oh yum, I say, but some people might not like that). I also didn't frost them. Fresh cinnamon rolls and no need to get up early.  It's a win win!!

5 stars isn't enough! I followed the recipe to a T, and they came out great. My son told me they should be called "Better Than a Cinnabon." There's a LOT of frosting, which is fine for people who like lots of frosting. The next time I make these, I'll probably reduce the frosting ingredients to 2/3 of the amount, but that's just a personal preference. Thanks for the great recipe, Marsha!

Cut the calories by using no cal brown sugar.  You can't tell the difference.  They are wonderful. I also add just a little melted butter to the pan before adding the buns.  These are so yummy.

Delicious! The only change i made was i substituted low fat cottage cheese for the cream cheese for the icing part. It tastes the same and is cheaper.

These are great but they are missing the secret. You add a box of vanilla pudding to your dough mix and you will get the exact cinnabon taste. but these are great. Thanx for sharing

This is a very easy, tasty recipe.  I don't have a bread machine, but use a food processor to mix.  You pulse until the dough balls up.  Then put in a greased bowl and allow to rise.  I used buttermilk because I wanted the "zing".

Super sweet and super good. I made them exactly as written and I loved them. I don't think my family liked them as well as I did, but I'm the one with the sweet tooth in the family. I think the only thing I would do different is make them about half the size next time. They were huge and it was hard to eat the whole thing.

I love cooking, but have always been shy of making cinnamon rolls because they seemed so tricky--but not this recipe.  These were so easy!  The family raved!
  A definite keeper.  I made the night before and baked in the morning.  What a great breakfast to start the school/work day.  Thank you for this recipe.

I made these again today for Easter morning tomorrow. They are very easy to make and simply delicious.  My oven runs hot so I used a lower temp and shorter cooking time.  I used the recipe for the frosting again as well.  I do wonder how they'd be with a simple frosting and not cream cheese.  Whatever frosting you choose the rolls are delicious, soft and pillowy. 


Original review. The buns are in the oven and it smells so great in my house. This was very simple, I followed directions to a T, and they look fabulous. I'll add when I taste, but I think these are going to be a hit!
Made these a 2nd time and I dropped the cinnamon down to 2 Tablespoons and added a sprinkle of cardamom to the brown sugar mixture. The first time I made as written and it was just a tad too much cinnamon flavor for us. But this is a wonderful recipe.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe! These cinnamon rolls are awesome! I just baked them today, and my family loves them. The only thing I did differently was that I made a vanilla glaze instead of using cream cheese frosting. Thank you so much! these were fantastic.

Yum yum yum! I made a double batch and we have had them everyday this week. The cooking time needs a little tweaking, i prefer my cinnamon bun to be a little gooey in the center. I read the reviews and someone suggested mixing the cinnamon and brown sugar and butter together instead of sprinkling the cinnamon on the sugar butter mix. I had no problems with the filling draining out. I also made a double batch of frosting. I found that anymore than the regular portion was too much, and i have a serious sweet tooth.

A smashing hit - everyone loved them, best cinnamon roll recipe I've made. They turned out tender but not doughy.

Changes: I lined the pan with parchment paper when I baked the rolls to keep the filling from baking onto the pan. That worked well.

Also, I changed the frosting recipe slightly - I used an entire 8 oz pkg of cream cheese and doubled the rest of the ingredients. The frosting was sweet but not overly so, with a nice hint of cream cheese.

They were ok good but the sugar/cinnamon mixture tasted grainy after baking. Will keep searching for a better recipe. 
*Update: made these again and the sugar/cinnamon mixture wasn't grainy so I'm changing the rating. Didn't do anything differently though. Did, however, turn the pan upside down as soon as it came out of the oven to recoat with all of the drippings and reduced the sugar on the icing (but it was still a tad sweet).

Mine came out kinda crunchy/hard. They were edible but not fluffy and delicious. I don't know what went wrong. What would cause that? I let the dough rise until it was doubled then rolled it out and followed all the instructions... My yeast is fresh, just opened the jar today. Why would they not fluff up right? 

Can anyone help answer this? Cinnamon rolls are my mate's favorite and I wanna master them!

This is an excellent cinnamon roll recipe! I took some to work and was complimented on them the whole day. I did follow the recipe quite closely, though didn't wait until the oven was preheated and my bake time turned into 25-30 minutes, as the dough was still too raw when i tried them at 15 and 20 min. Also, the rolls in the glass dish cooked faster than the silicone dish. 
Don't skimp on the butter for the filling and make the amount of icing listed. That seemed to be about right (unless you like to drown your cinnamon roll in sugar glaze).

The recipe was ok not fantastic the buns were a little heavy, a bit dry and did not rise as much as I would have liked.  I will continue using my old recipe with water, milk and only one egg, makes for a fluffier bun.

My husband was begging for cinnamon buns and so he helped me make these. We did not alter this recipe and these were by far the best we ever had bought or baked. Thank you Marsha

This was my first time making rolls.  They turned out wonderful.  Didn't have a bread machine, so mixed by hand.  So easy will make again.

I wish I could give this recipe SIX stars! I followed the instructions from *nausheen* because I don't have a bread machine. 
This was a simple, easy to follow recipe! I have very little experience baking with yeast and I've never made cinnamon rolls before, but I decided to give these a shot. I'm so glad I did!
My husband said they were the best cinnamon rolls he's ever had and my dad asked for me to make them for him for his bday present!
**Note: these are HUGE! I think next time I'll try rolling it up into two rolls and having 24 average sized rolls. Just a thought...

Great, mine didnt cook in the center so I had to keep checking them, it took a lot of extra time, then they got hard on the bottom from the cinnamon sugar dripping out.

These were amazing! Did them the night before and put them in the fridge. Got them out in the morning, set the oven to 170 and let them rise for 20 minutes in the oven, then cooked them at the regular temperature and time. SOOOOO YUMMY!!!

OMG GOOD! I'd say it tastes like a Cinnabon, and I ate a TON of those while preggo =) Boy would this have saved me a ton of money. I made it without a bread machine, and followed andytami's instructions. Easy and delicious! I'm going to make this again and try some of the other reviewers suggestions and make them the night before and place in the fridge and cook the following morning. Wish me luck!

These are wonderful, no complaints!  Made them without a bread machine.  These freeze well (uncooked) and you can take them out the night before, let them proof a bit in the morning, and yum, you have a great homemade breakfast treat!

I make these almost every weekend we have guests over. I found that they also bake up well if you mix them up the night before and put them in the refrigerator overnight for the final rise. Then I just  pop them in the oven in the morning. I like this approach a lot better than getting up at 5 AM to get the bread machine going!

Incredible flavor and they really do taste and look like Cinnabon!  This is the third cinnamon roll recipe I've cooked in the past couple of months and this is my favorite.  I do have a warning though.  I am using a temporary oven (portable convection oven from Costco in Taiwan) and baked them in a glass 9x13 pan and they were doughy and raw on the bottoms (sadly) and a little brown on top.  I much prefer baking cinnamon rolls on a silicon pan and thought I'd try a new way.  Big mistake! Now I need to throw them away or just eat the top halves, which we probably will since the "done parts" are so good.  I cannot wait to get back to my own ovens.  I baked them at 204 C and not on convection.  Next time, I'll avoid using a glass pan and put them on the lowest rack in the oven.  Great recipe--just a user error made them less than perfect.

This was my first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls and they were heavenly!  I love that the bread machine does the work.  The filling with the brown sugar is excellent.  After 15 minutes I felt like they weren't done because they were VERY gooey so I cooked them longer but I think they actually were done in 15 min.  I forgot how gooey cinnabons are!  The frosting is delicious!

These were very yummy!! Although, my rolls did not double in size like it stated it should.  I'm not even sure they rose at all!!  Any suggestions as to why that may have happened?

This recipe is fantastic!  I've never made these before and they are divine.  The buns didn't rise after they were cut.  The recipe states they should in 30 minutes and mine didn't at all.  I put them in the oven and they then were about 1.5 times their original size.  Awesome recipe.  I couldn't even wait for them to cool before the whole family dug in.  I was lucky to pull my hands away before there were pulling them apart.  The icing is exactly like the stores in the mall.  Now a favourite of mine!!

I tried again with flour bread, bread machine yeast and what a difference!  double the size compared to my first 2 batches with all purpose flour and quick rise yeast!

Pretty darn good!! I followed the no bread machine post and the buns themselves were delicious. Frosting not so much. If you have a good cream cheese recipe i suggest using that instead or just adding more cream cheese and less powdered sugar.

AMAZING! I couldn't believe it.. they really did taste like Cinnabon's but even better. I made the recipe with my Kitchenaid Mixer, adding the rapid rise yeast in with 3 cups flour and then poured in the milk and eggs. I added the remaining flour 1 tbsp at a time while kneading on speed 2. Then I let it rise for an hour. Delicious!!

WOW... these are unbelievable and way easier to make than I anticipated. I do agree with some that the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture was kind of intense. I would leave the brown sugar quantity alone, but reduce the cinnamon to 1 1/2 - 2 tsp only. Got rave reviews from the fam for these.

I tried this last week. It was amazing and I wouldn't change a thing for the actual cinnamon roll. I did add a TBS of orange juice in my frosting just to give it zip. VERY GOOD ... My husband really enjoyed them as well!

I've made this many times and it's always a hit.  Very easy to make the night before and bake in the morning so they're fresh from the oven for breakfast.  I've had to limit them to very special occasions only or I's be making them once a week I'm sure!  One tip, I melt the butter and spread it on with a pastry brush then sprinkle cinnamon and brown sugar on and press it down with the back of a tablespoon.  Seems to help keep the filling inside when baking.

Wow, these are deadly!  In a good way :)  I followed the recipe exactly, just adjusted the baking time/temp slightly (375 for 20 min. and they were just right; also immediately turned out onto some wax paper and let all the goo run out of the pan on top of the buns.) I did have some trouble getting my buns to rise in the pan pre-baking.  Ended up sitting them on top of my preheated oven, where it was nice and warm, for just over an hour.  They did rise a wee bit, but not nearly double.  Pretty sure this was due to my mistake of having the milk too hot and killing my yeast.  I was worried they would end up hard due to this problem, but they actually turned out fairly soft, and not dry at all.  Lots of yummy cinnamon sugar oozing out.  The icing tastes delish; love the cream cheese.  I did find it was not necessary to use quite so much icing as the recipe calls for though.  So all in all, even with my little problem with lack of rising, they were still super yum.  I will give these another go for sure.

Followed the recipe closely (except I only made a half-batch).  Delicious!  I'll definitely use this recipe again.  I might add some chopped pecans to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture next time.

Better than the ones I had previously made using a youtube recipe,but mine turned out a bit dry,guess it has got to do with the cooking oil I used instead of margarine.A bit labor intense hopefully my next try will be better than this one.Thank you :)
Update: I have a small coffee shop and trust me this recipe is a great hit at my cafe`. When I use margarine these babies come out perfectly moist.Love it so does my customers. Thank you again.

I reduce the oven temp to 350 and bake 20-30 minutes.  Amazingly yummy; THANK YOU!!  We cut the recipe in half and it fit perfectly in our bread machine, and made 8 perfect cinnamon rolls.  I followed another reviewers suggestion of making a paste out of the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter and spreading that onto the dough, and will do it that way from now on.

I make this recipe constantly as it is a big hit with everyone. After finding this recipe I'll never buy cinnamon rolls again. Also, on workdays I'll prepare the recipe as directed at night, cut it up, put it in the greased pan, then refrigerate it. The dough still rises in the refrigerator just slowly, so by the time the morning comes they're ready for baking.

Made these Christmas Eve for Christmas morning. I used my Kitchenaid and followed the recipe almost exactly using all purpose flour and butter. These were delicious. I had no problems with rolling out the dough or cinnamon filling oozing out (I mixed the ingredients together first). I will make these again using less sugar in the bread dough as it didn't need the extra sweetness. The texture is wonderful and my husband , not normally a sweets eater, spread the icing on the icebox cookies too. Thanks for a keeper recipe.

Very sweet roll, I've never had a Cinnabon, but these were really good!   I made the rolls and put them in round baking pans(found at dollar store.)   Each pan held 6 rolls. I then froze the rolls and made up the frosting and froze that as well.  When I want to eat them, I thaw rolls on countertop for 7 to 8 hours, until doubled then bake for 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees.  I also have made a whole pan and put in the frig overnight to raise, then baked at 350 for 20 -25 minutes.

I made these without a bread machine and they were still super easy. SO DELISH!! My only advice would be to watch them - I baked for 15 mins but the outside buns were a little crunchy - I like them soft and could have taken them out a few mins sooner. Still good though!!

The BEST!!!!!! I do not use a bread machine. I just mix the yeast and warm milk together with a whisk until dissolved. Then add all other ingredients except flour and whisk them together. Then I add the flour and use my stand mixer for 5 minutes and DONE...I have kneaded it by hand for 10 minutes too and it is PERFECT. I hate cooking and baking and this is easy and at the end you have delicious reward. :)

I'm rating it 5 stars because the icing is excellent, but the cinnamon rolls themselves are 4 stars. Next time I think I'll do the filling a little differently so it doesn't all drip out. Otherwise, these are very good.

Wonderful!  It is true that you can use water instead of milk, but milk makes the bread more moist.  Also, I don't want to try to make these "diet cinnamon buns", of course, but we enjoyed them thoroughly without any icing.

I thought that I followed the recipe carefully , but I lost a third of the dough because it is SUPER sticky. I couldn't get it off my hands or the wax paper. Hopefully the taste is better than the process.

WOW!  These are so good!  Here are the 2 things I've discovered after making these a few times:  1) You can use warm water instead of milk 2) You can mix up all the ingredients and put rolls in pan at night in fridge and wake up and bake!  It's best to bring the rolls to room temp again and then pop in the oven.  This saves time in the morning!

This is absolutely wonderful. When I used to work in an office, I would treat myself to a Cinnabon every-once-in-a-while. It's been a while since I made this recipe or worked in a office. I think it's time to make the cinnabons 8-) By the way, the only thing I might add is pecan chips, other wise it's pure perfection. thank you so much for sharing!!!

This recipe was fantastic! The best homemade cinnamon bun recipe I have tried yet! For me though, the dough was VERY dry, I had to add more moisture to it..I'm not sure if I added too much flour (my 4 year old daughter was helping me) or maybe my milk wasnt warm enough? or maybe it was because my eggs were straight out of the fridge? not sure..but..I added 1/4c milk to the dough after it was mixed, and another 1/3c margarine. I think next time I will use regular salted butter. It rose great, and tastes FANTASTIC!! I only made half the recipe (the rest of the dough is in the fridge for tomorrow) and used the icing as is except for only 3/4c conf sugar. sooooo yummy!!! Thank y'all for this recipe!

I found these buns were very good, but not as fantastic as I was led to believe by the reviews. They seem a little drier than my usual recipe, with less flavour in the dough and there is not quite enough icing. I would also recommend making smaller buns (cut them into 16 or more) because, although they are similar in size to Cinnabon ones, I felt they were so big they are overfilling (and come on, no one needs that much of a fattening treat!).

These turned out way to yeasty. I don't know if it's because I didn't use a bread machine. Also, I didn't have bread flour so I used all-purpose which could another reason why.  I probably won't make these again unless I get a bread machine.

excellent recipe, just takes a while to make.  I did not make this in the bread machine, I just proofed the yeast in warm milk and then added all the ingredients into the kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook and kneaded for 6 minutes.  I let it rise until double and followed the rest of the recipe.  I will make this again but will try other suggestions about making this the night before and then bake in the morning.
Update: I made the dough and put it in the freezer, the day before I wanted to bake them, I pulled them out of the freezer and left them in the fridge overnight.  The next morning, I let them sit for about 1 1/2 hours and then baked normally and they came out great.

Love this recipe. Very simple and tastes sooooo good. Not quite like a Cinnabon but it's better because you get to eat them fresh out of the oven.

Love it! Next time I will go a little easier on the cream cheese in the frosting and I will also cook about 10 minutes longer... the outside buns were okay, but the middle ones were still all gooey.

This was very easy to make. I put the dough ingredients in my bread machine and let it knead the dough. Then I rolled it out on my cutting board (the dough was pretty sticky) and spread on the butter and then sprinkled the brown sugar/cinnamon. I would use a little less brown sugar mixture because these was a lot of it! Then I rolled it up and cut it and placed the slices in a 9 by 13 inch pan. I had a few extra slices so I put those in a smaller dish. I refrigerated overnight and baked them in the morning. The inside of the roll was gooey and they were delicious! Will definatly make these again. Thanks!

Not as moist as I thought they would be, but still pretty darn good. They're very easy to make especially with a bread machine. Sometimes I add a bit of pecans or raisins.

It was a good cinnamon roll.  Not sure if it was quite a clone, but maybe I just need to try it again.

I didn't have bread maker so I had to change the recipe... This is what I did: 1. I used warm milk with sugar to dissolve the yeast 2. I do not use margarine, since it is super unhealthy (yes, it is better to use butter) 3. I run out of sugar and had to use some brown sugar in the dough Despite all these changes and my worries, these turned out great!  Good luck!

This is the BEST cinnamon roll recipe!! I've made them many times and I have a nagging feeling that it's not good for my health- or weight! I usually use less oil and half milk, half HOT water. (then you don't have to heat the milk) I also add vanilla to the dough, it adds a nice flavor. For the frosting I use more cream cheese and less butter as well as adding milk to make it more glaze-like. All in all, a GREAT recipe!

i cooked these as-is and turned the pan upside down to capture the drippings. didn't have any problem with the filling running out but would like more filling! would also be careful to watch the cooking time. i know my oven is a bit hot so although i went for a shorter cooking time, they were still a bit harder than i would have liked. not the recipe's fault - i just need to adjust for next time. doubled the icing and it was enough for generous portions with a wee bit left over. yummy!! made them 2 weeks ago and will make them again this weekend.

I shared this recipe with a friend. While her kids were at school, we made them. When we got home they had one for a snack, and her youngest exclaimed, "THEY TASTE JUST LIKE THE ONES AT THE MALL!!!!"   These are AMAZING, and you will never use another cinnamon roll recipe again.

Super cheating method - I made only the frosting and added 2 tbsp of cinnamon.  I use this to turn any piece of bread/toast into cinnamon deliciousness in seconds.

The rolls themselves deserve 5 stars, I'm giving the recipe 4 because every time I've baked them at 400 for 15 minutes they have come out raw in the middle and brown on top.  I will try 30 minutes at 350 next time.  I like to make these during the week; they can be frozen after cutting into the rolls, then set out to thaw and rise the night before I want them for breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have bread flour on hand so I substituted it with all-purpose flour as some reviewers mentioned. My cinnabons tasted very nice but the texture was cake-like. I will have to use only bread flour next time. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

AMAZING!!!! My inlaws heard over the phone that I was making homemade cinnamon rolls and said they would be over in an hour (mind you, they live 30 miles away.) To my surprise, they showed up, and my father in law said "I will come out every day if you promise me these!" My mother in law asked me NOT to share the caloric count, cause she knew they were BAD good!

I just finished making these.  I am only giving them a four star, because they weren't completely done at 15 minutes, as posted.  The inside rolls are completely doughy, which is disappointing.  The taste if FANTASTIC, but the recipe needs to be modified to bake for 20 minutes.  The tops were nice and brown, but the insides were really doughy.  We are going to try to freeze the inside ones and then bake them in the microwave to finish dough.  Also, I used all butter and no margarine, and I would also recommend this.  Margarine has a very high water content, which isn't conducive to most recipes.

WOW!  These are AMAZING!  In our families opinion these tasted exactly like a cinnabon cinnamon bun!  They are awesome.  I felt like they were very time consuming (even though I used my breadmaker) but well worth it!  Would recommend these to anyone.  I used "I can't believe it's not butter" for anything that called for butter or margarine.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a "T"!!  Enjoy these tasty pieces of heaven :)

Wow, what good things can I say that haven't already been said? My review is for this recipe as written, with the slight exception of using sifted all purpose flour and the Kitchen Aid, and this baker can't find fault with it. Found cinnamon bun nirvana, though! Even without the cream cheese topping, these cinnamon buns are tender and rich, and good. The best recipe I've found yet. But, of course, it's all about the topping.....

Good grief are these good.  Don't have a bread machine either but just mixed the yeast with the warm milk.  Let sit about 5 minutes then stirred in the rest of the ingredients for the dough.  Put in a bowl that was coated with a tiny bit of oil, covered and let rise.

WOW.  I can't make this very often since I can't control myself around them - they are so delicious.  Wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.  It works best if cooked exactly like instructed, but you can put the shaped roles in the pan, let sit for 30 minutes then cover to put in the fridge over night.  Put into the oven (straight out of the fridge) at 400 for 30 minutes.  Turned out great.

delicious. time consuming (even with my trusty kitchen-aid!), but worth it. tasted almost like a cinnabon, i think with a little more tweaking it would be exact! the center of the cinnabon is my favorite, where its really soft and gooey. i think ill bake these just a couple of minutes less so the outer portion of the roll isnt hard. i melted the butter and spread that over the dough, then sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture over that and had no problems with it running out during baking. i might even double the cinnamon sugar mixture next time! for a rare treat, im going all the way! :)

One of the best cinnamon roll recipes. I filled mine with dried cherries for an extra kick. It was divine.

incredibly easy, tasted fabulous.  Followed recipe with exception of substituting butter in the dough mix (I don't use margarine ever).  I think next time i'll add pecans to the filling.....oh, and there DEFINITELY will be a next time!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm rating this recipe for what it would have been, had I actually followed it. Not to say that mine weren't good, but i'm surprised they even worked at all. I decided to make these on a whim for mothers day, because my mom was out of town and it would surprise her when she got back. I started making it, only to realize that there was no way I was going to have time, since I had to work at 4 and didn't start making these until 1:30. So, I took the dough out of the bread machine before it was done rising, didn't wait the 10 minutes to let it rise after taking it out, didn't wait 30 minutes after rolling them to let them rise, and just popped them in the oven. Needless to say, they were nowhere near done after 15 minutes. So I put them in for another 15 and still, not done. By that time I had to leave and I left a note for my mom saying to put them in for 10 minutes when she got home to let them finish baking. She did this, and somehow, they were STILL good. I also used all purpose flour and regular quick rise yeast. I'm baffled at how well these worked. I thought I would definitely have to throw the whole batch out. Next time though, I will definitely stick to the recipe.

While I didn't make the actual cinnamon roll, I did eat it. It was, by far, the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. They're sinfully delicious. And they do taste like Cinnabon.

Took a total of almost 4 hours doing it without a bread machine. Here were my results: The way I managed the dough- Used dough hook on my stand mixer. Mixed fine, didn't know it'd be so elastic, very different than most doughs i've worked with. To allow the bread to rise I set my oven to 170 and put the dough in there. It made it rise very quickly. Took roughly half an hour.  Icing: I didn't use the recipe for the icing from here. I found another recipe which sounded more like the original. I was correct. It tasted very similar, though still not the right texture, someone said it could be thicker if you used fondant sugar. The other recipe used margarine and also included lemon juice. Makes sense considering the the frosting of the real cinnabon has that flavoring.   Overall the cinnamon roll tasted okay, but it wasn't a cinnabon by any stretch of the imagination. The breading was almost gross. Not the right texture at all. These were slightly airy, and not very strong, where as the cinnabon brand is very strong and dense. So I don't know what to say, I spent so long working on these, sure it was a bit of fun but it was overall very disappointing and became a waist of money. If i do this again I will certainly edit the recipe to include more cream cheese and less butter on the frosting, also figure some way out to make the dough more dense.

I  made these by hand instead of with a bread machine and they turned out great.  I baked half of them and am freezing the other half to use next week when family visits.  Soooo good :)

These were so easy to make and without a doubt are the absolute BEST homemade cinnamon rolls my wife or I have ever tried. On an honest note, where these as good as real Cinnabon? No. But it's DARN close. :)

I've made these quite a few times now and have been asked several times over to keep making them.  They are SO delicious!  I like to bring these to work and have always followed the recipe up until the rising part.  I would cut them up, line them in the dish and refrigerate them.  Then, get up in the morning, microwave some water to boiling while I preheated the oven, pour the boiling water into a pan and place that in the oven, turn the oven off and stick the rolls in to proof while I get ready for work.  Works every time!

Well lets just say the tons of 5 star ratings don't lie! One thing I must warn you about is: make sure you use the right kind of yeast!  I didn't know bread machine yeast existed so I used active dry the first time I made these, and they tasted great but had more of the texture of dinner rolls.  Bread machine yeast made all the difference.  I too do not have a bread machine so I followed the basic steps for the good old fashioned way that many have already given the tips for here, so ty.  Turning the oven on and then off was a brilliant idea, especially in the middle of winter when there is not a single spot in this house that is warm.  The last thing is, I forgot to get cream cheese this time so I opted to use Special Buttercream Frosting for this, just added less sugar and it was actually pretty tasty!  My husband, 11 month old and neighbors just loved these.  Fantastic recipe, thank you so much!

the flavour is amazing, the icing is delicious, but i have made these twice, and both times they turned out doughy in the middle. they are nice and brown on the outside, but the middles are undercooked and really doughy. i think i'll try these again with a lower cooking temperature, and a longer bake.  great flavour though!!!

I didn't have a bread machine, so I used other reviewers suggestions and put the yeast into some warm milk and mixed all the stuff in. I also turned the oven to 200F and then turned it off before letting the dough rise. My dough got HUGE. More than doubled in size. Then when I rolled it out I ended up getting, like, 20 rolls. I, like others, mixed the butter with the cinnamon and brown sugar, and since my oven gets hot, I baked at 350 for 10 minutes and they -still- came out hard and crusty on the outside (it's my oven -- it's done this before) so with the rest of the batch I'll be sure to make sure they come out of the oven sooner.  However, even with that self-inflicted issue, these were still DELICIOUS, particularly in the center. I'm not sure what people mean by too much cinnamon -- there didn't seem to be enough for me and my roommate! And my roommate--she normally hates EVERYTHING, but she went back for seconds.

Amazing!!  I made 2 dozen for a big family breakfast and they were a big hit!  Instead of using a bread machine I dissolved the sugar with the milk.. then added the yeast and let it set for a few minutes.  I added everything else and kneaded a few times.  I warmed my oven up to 200 degrees, turned it off, and let the dough rise for about an hour!  They turned our amazing!!

I've made these as written a couple of times now.  Today I tried a new variation:  Orange Cranberry.  Omit the cinnamon and brown sugar.  Cream softened butter with  1/2 cup white sugar and 2-3 tbsp orange zest.  Sprinkle with 1/3 cup finely chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup dried cranberries.  Roll up and bake as usual.  For the frosting I used Orange Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.

A SUPER recipe!  I followed another reviewers instructions for making them without a bread machine, and they came out beautifully.  My one suggestion: Instead of spreading the butter on the dough and then sprinkling on the cinnamon sugar, cream the butter, sugar, and cinnamon together, and then spread the mixture over the dough.  I find that it makes rolling and cutting the rolls much easier.

These are AMAZING!  I followed the recipe exactly using a break machine.  My only change was to mix the cinamon, brown sugar and butter and then spread.  This was the first time I ever made cinnamon rolls or anything in a bread maker (I don't bake usually) and it was great!    I also covered them overnight and left in fridge before baking - I had to cook for 5 - 10 extra minutes but otherwise it didn't change anything and made the morning much easier.  Someone recommended doubling the frosting but I had plenty leftover so I think that would be excessive - even though the frosting is SO good!  Thanks a lot for the recipe!

AWESOME recipe- so much better than my old one, and I thought THAT one was great.  The only thing I did differently was use all purpose flour since I didn't have bread flour on hand (I added a little bit more than the 4.5 c. called for). This one is going into my heirloom recipes book!

i made these the easy way. i used a roll of frozen bread dough!  i let it come to room temperature then follow the instructions exactly! it may not be exactly the same but it saves the work of making the actual dough when you don't have extra time! the frosting is delicious!!

WOW!!!  I don't have a bread machine and wish I had read more of the tips in the reviews but once these came out of the oven I wasn't sorry for the time involved in making them!  They taste delicious and almost identical to Cinnabon.  Next time I'll refrigerate them overnight and bake in the morning so that we can have this for Christmas breakfast.  For those without a bread machine, be sure to preheat your oven to 200 degrees, turn it off and then put the covered bowl in for an hour to let it rise.  This will save a lot of headache on babysitting the dough.  Also, don't use too much flour when rolling so that you don't get that taste when they're done.

This was amazing! I am writing this review slightly late as I made this during Christmas, the night we put up our tree, and it was a hit! The smell was amazing and the leftovers were fabulous when you put them in the microwave for a few seconds! I would probably make these every week if I didn't have such a small family because otherwise my hubby and I would gain so much weight polishing these off each week! You will love this recipe!

I don't think it matters if these are a clone of a cinnabon or not. The only thing that really matters is how super super yummy there are!

These are excellent cinnamon rolls! I made them exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing...they are perfect already. Although they don't taste quite the same as Cinnabon, they are the closest I've come to recreating that mall favorite. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...my family loves them!

The first time I made this I used King Arthur bread flour which made really good and large rolls. I also doubled the amount of brown sugar and cinnamon used and combined it with double the butter to make a paste that I slathered on the dough. This made VERY moist and qooey rolls, but they didn't cook all the way through. Next time I will cook them at a lower temp for longer time. Overall, this recipe is AWESOME and soooo delicious.

These did not taste like a cinnabon. They were tasty cinnamon rolls and the icing was delish but don't call them a 'clone' when they aren't.   One start just because they aren't what they said- but they are good!

Delish!  With over 3,000 reviews, what more can I add?  Well, this space cadet accidentally added the cinnamon to the dough mix!  I was running out the door to get my son to the bus stop and was rushed.  I panicked for a minute, and then decided I would just leave the cinnamon out of the filling.  Yum!  I'm actually not usually a huge fan of the filling of cinnamon buns, finding it too intense with all that concentrated cinnamon hitting my tongue at once.  It was actually very good having the cinnamon flavor dispersed in the bun itself with brown sugar and butter alone in the filling.  I used dark brown sugar to up the flavor factor.  Five stars even with my goof!  I think I'll make it the same way next time.

These were great and actually pretty simple to make.  I made these into caramel rolls instead of using the frosting and they baked up beautifully!

Awesome! I made these without a bread machine and refrigerated the shaped rolls overnight before baking them in the morning. I used brown sugar instead of white. The dough was easy to work with and the rolls tasted and looked great.

This should get 10 stars! I have made this recipe several times and every time I receive many compliments, better than the store in the mall! I use a bread machine to make the dough and I let it sit for a long time after the cycle is done, before rolling it out. I also like to leave them (after cutting up) in the refrigerator overnight and bake in the morning. They come out huge.

Wonderful recipe I even used regular flour.   I did add raisins and chopped pecans.   When they were done baking I flipped the whole pan over and frosted the bottoms.  All the cinnamon and goodness inside stayed in the middle, no oozing out in pan.  Highly recommend this one.

I cannot rave enough about these awesome cinnamon rolls!  They are a little time-consuming to make but WELL worth the effort.  Easy to make, hard to hide :)  I've been making these almost as long as the recipe has been on allrecipies!  Even when I forgot to let them rise before I baked them, they were great.  Be prepared to make a double batch if you take these rolls to work- they go fast.  I've only changed a few things.  I've always used butter instead of margarine.  If I'm making them for work or a bake sale- I roll them a little thinner, and nearly double the cinnamon filling.  (This will make enough to fill a disposable roasting pan.)  For the last few batches, I covered the rolls with foil when they were done, layered towels to fill up the extra space, and then flipped them while they were cooling.  Flip them back before completely cool- the extra filling seeps into all the little nooks and crannies- yum!  I haven't tried freezing them.  I have made them the day before and then put them in the fridge overnight.  Be sure to let them warm and rise a bit if you do this.   If you don't have a bread machine the recipe still works.  Mix and knead well but gently.  Be sure to let the dough rise in a warm spot- such as on top of a warm oven.  The magic of a bread machine is that it warms a little during the cycle so the dough rises well.  If your dough isn't rising, it needs to be warmer.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It's the ultimate cinnamon roll!

Very good recipe!! I didn't have a bread machine, so had to do it the old-fashioned way. Bread also didn't seem to rise much either time. I still went on with the cooking as I was out of yeast. The only change I made was I used whipped cream cheese just because I think of the real thing being more whipped than a typical icing. Very Good though. A++

Fantastic! I took some advice and made mine the night before. I sat the rolls on a baking sheet covered with saran wrap and put in the fridge. Next morning put the rolls in the oven then turned on to 400 and baked for 14 minutes. Stick to the recipe. Delicious!

This recipe is unreal. So good. So worth the extra work. I made these on Christmas Eve day, put them in the fridge overnight and we had them on Christmas morning. So yummy. I did not have a bread machine. I used my Kitchen Aid, bread hook.  I used regular flour will use bread flour next time. Still turned out great.  At the end of the baking cycle, I turned the pan over on top of a cookie sheet and frosted these babies!  This recipe is a keeper. My family loved these rolls. We had some left overs and had them this morning. I simply put them in the over to re-warm.   Awesome!  I will make these again.

I followed another users advice for making this without the bread machine and it turned out great.  I also used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, kneaded for about 10 mins and the buns turned out soft and chewy. No complaints.  The buns were a Christmas eve hit!

With over 3000 reviews, I don't really need to add my two cents worth...but having said that...O!M!G! This will make your eyes roll back in your head with pleasure. True 5 star recipe. Don't change a thing...and having said that...I did make one change. Used 4 oz of cream cheese because I didn't want to be left with 1 oz of cream cheese. It took me so long to try this because I already had a really outstanding cinnamon bun recipe, but it will now be sitting at the back of the recipe book as a backup. Marsha, thank you so much for sharing!

I made these on the night of the 23rd in order to serve for Christmas, making the dough and forming the rolls and then covering them to let them rise the second time in the refrigerator. On Christmas morning I took them out and let them sit for half an hour, and then baked them. The family raved over them. The icing was delicious, too! Another thing I did differently was to mix the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon before spreading on the rolled out dough. It worked well and the filling didn't "run out" like others said it did. Fabulous!

Cinnamon rolls are our xmas breakfast tradition, thought I would try a homemade version for the first time.  First of all, I haven't actually eaten these yet.  I was experimenting with making the day before and going to make the icing in the morning then eat (just too much work for xmas morning).  Well, wish I had read the reviews.  I actually baked mine and wish I had put them in the frig as others have successfully done.  I think mine will be fine though.  Wanted to give my input also:  Do lower the temp some and/or cook for less time.. mine got a little too brown on top.  Also, took much longer to get the rise both times.  First one in the machine took an extra hour I would say......to double in size and fill my pan.  Second rise took at least an hour also (after cut and in pan) But, as I am now reading, I would have just put them in the frig for morning at this point.  One really good tip I just learned from  my MIL:  using thread to cut them.  Just place thread under the roll and cross the thread on the top and pull (like the first step to tying your shoe) until it totally cuts off the roll.  Worked amazing!!!! Enjoy!  I know we will and now I have a good plan for xmas morning!

BELIEVE THE HYPE! These are simply delicious--and the 5-star rating is WELL deserved.  I don't see how anyone has said that they do not taste exactly like Cinnabons because they are eerily close. I will make these over and over again!  I did mix the filling together before spreading it, next time I'll try it as written to see what the diffderence will be.  I also followed the recommendation to make enough frosting to use an 8 oz block of cream cheese and froze it in small spoonfuls, and I'm sure that they will come in handy.  I froze half of the batch before baking them--and thank goodness I did because it will keep me and my husband from shamelessly consuming all of them in a matter of days. : )

UPDATE: MADE MY FROZEN ROLLS THIS PAST WKEND . TOOK OUT OF THE FREEZER & INTO  THE FRIDGE LAST NITE & ALLOWED TO REST WHILE OVEN WAS PREHEATING. BAKED AS I DID LAST TIME. EXCELLENT!!! OK, here's the deal. I've been eyeing this recipe for a while, but was too timid to try it! If u use a bread machine or KitchenAid & follow other's sugg. for rising (in fridge) overnite, these are EASY to assemble!!! I pretty much followed Marsha's direct. w/ just a few ch. 1) subbed (unsalted) butter for marg. & used fast rise yeast (intended for BM use - needed an entire 1/4 oz. pkg. + a tad of another). 2) warmed my milk in the micro. (used an infared therm. from Sears Auto to test temp. - works like a charm!). 3) allowed butter & eggs to come to rm. temp. (VERY impt.!); for the eggs, soak in warm H2O for a few min. 4) used the dough cycle on my BM (1.5 hr. + 10 min. to rest). I placed a (cut) roll in ea. of 6 greased jumbo muffin cups, covered w/ plastic wrap & let rise overnite. I placed the remaining rolls in a greased, disposable pie pan, covered w/ foil & froze. This AM, I took my rolls out of the fridge, placed them on my stove for a 1/2 hr. (while preheating) & then baked at 350 for 25 min. Although I like the muffin tin idea, I don't think I will try it again. My rolls were hard around the edges (and VERY dk.!). Oh well! Other than not liking the frosting (I'll keep searching...) & the muffin idea, these were EXCELLENT! I can't WAIT to thaw the ones in the freezer! Tx. for sharing. :)

I made these for Thanksgiving just as the recipe called for.  The dough was a bit dry and my bread machine nearly burned up trying to mix the dough so I had to add more liquid till it could handle mixing it.  Next time I will try mixing the butter and cinnamon/sugar mixture together because it did run out and turning the pan upside down helps but isn't the same.  We were not thrilled with this recipe and will stick to mine that we have every Sunday and for the holidays.  We like our cinnamon rolls to be soft and gooey inside.  These are a bit dry for our taste.  I will keep the frosting recipe as that has a nice light texture and flavor.

Good cinnamon bun recipe.  In order to get the "Cinnabon" texture I believe you have to undercook these.  I don't care for cinnabons, so I cooked these fully and yes - they were delish just as a regular cinnamon bun!

Excellent! I often leave off frosting and sugary toppings to make treats less unhealthy, but better not to skimp on this recipe: the frosting makes a big difference.  I put chopped, roasted almonds and coarsely chopped apples in the filling and it was a great variation on the traditional cinnamon roll.  Also, a whole-wheat version is surprisingly good: don't be afraid to try it.

Excellent, very rich and tasty. I mixed sugar, cinnamon and butter together before spreading on dough as suggested by others. I did not get the gooey cinnamon mixture that others described. When I flipped the rolls over there was no "goo". Also I forgot to add the butter to the dough. Didn't seem to have a negative effect at all. Loved it and will definitely make it again.

These turned out gorgeous.  I changed it to 9 instead of 12 but still got 11 buns.  They raised enormously, so I think a bigger pan is warranted.  I cut each bun to 1 1/4 inches and when cooked they were a good 3 inches high or more.  The only things I would change, now that I've made them, is to increase the brown sugar in the filling & decrease the cinnamon, then start watching after 12 minutes as mine were fully cooked by then.  They would have been overdone by 15 minutes.  Mind you, all oven are different.  I don't care for cream cheese icing, so I just did a glace of icing sugar, butter, vanilla & milk.  I liked the suggestion to turn them out of pan immediately when they come out of the oven to keep the filling in.  I highly recommend this recipe if you want the greatest cinnamon buns in the world.

Wow!!!  I've made these quite a few times now and have had to play with the cooking time which seems to vary each time.  Anyway, took other reviewers recommendations and they turned out wonderful!  Family requests these ALL THE TIME!  Great crowd pleaser!

Yummy!!!  I tried one right out of the oven and thought they weren't very good.  Tried one later and thought they were great!!!  I also doubled the icing.  My sister and her family loved them, my neighbors also loved them.  I would probably use less cinnamon next time and more butter.  Great recipe!!!!!!

I made these for breakfast this morning and they were great! I may cook them a little longer than 15 minutes next time as a few parts were a little doughy. I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. My 12 years old had a Cinnabon recently at the mall and said that these were even better! I will make a again, probably for Thanksgiving guests.

I love cinnamon rolls. These are very good. Love the frosting. I lowered the fat and calories by subbing smart balance for the margarine (margarine has a TON of trans fats) I used egg beaters instead of egg and neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese for the frosting. I also left out all the salt. I never understood why people put salt in sweet treats. I've heard it is supposed to enhance the sweet flavor, but I can't tell the difference and I try to watch the sodium intake.

I've been making these for years! I do not find that having some of the gooey cinnamon filling leak out of the bottom a problem. It is very easy to scoop or spoon up and put on top of the roll. It does NOT stick to the pan. In fact it is one of the wonderful pluses to making your own cinnamon rolls, to be able to easily scrap the hardened pieces of cinnamon goodness from the bottom of the pan once cooled! It's an extra treat to pick at! If you flip the rolls over so the bottom is now the top it does not make for a very pretty cinnamon roll. I have never used bread flour and they have come out perfect using all-purpose. (I am very interested in trying the bread flour as a comparison.) I have never let them rise before baking and they have always risen just perfectly in the oven. However, the recipe I have calls for 10 minutes vs 15 in the oven. I sometimes need to leave them in an extra minute. If most of you recall the actual Cinnabons do have a somewhat gooey center. The dough is just barely cooked in the center. I remember buying one at the mall and bringing it home to do a side-by-side comparison and the center was somewhat gooey, cooked but just barely, very soft. Excellent recipe, a must try!

since the recipe calls for a bread machine, i was kinda worried if i can actually make this good. so anyways i did it and yum!!! the dough inside was soft, tender, it actually felt like its melting when u eat it! and the outside is so crunchy! i love it!! the only downside i did was to mix the yeast with milk, and when it didn't foam like it was supposed to i added another yeast mixture with warm water. but the result is still good!! thanks for posting the recipe!!

Phenomenal.  I was worried about mixing raw eggs with warm milk (and making scrambled eggs in the bread machine) but I slowly mixed the eggs with the melted butter and then put it in the warm milk.  Also, I used others reviews and put the cinnamon rolls into the dish, covering & refridgerating overnight, then sticking into a cold oven & setting the oven at 350, and leaving them for 30 minutes.  I also flipped the cinnamon rolls upside down on a sheet to serve so all the delicious "goo" at the bottom of the rolls could fall down and evenly distribute.  They came out perfectly, everyone was so impressed.  The consistency of the dough is soft all the way through, with no hard edges or raw centers.  I love this recipe!

Marsha, Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I've made this many a times for my office and for my husband's office. I'd come home with an empty pan each time and so does my husband. Who resists cinnamon rolls, right? The original recipe yields 12 very huge rolls. The first time I made it, a couple of guys in my husband's office were such wusses of eating one cinnamon roll alone because it was too big so they split the roll. LOL! That's how big it was!!! I have been able to make 18 rolls out of the recipe to make it go further. I do not have a bread maker so I prepared the dough manually as suggested by another poster. The type of flour one should use is definitely bread flour because of the high gluten content. After having made the cinnamon rolls a few times, I started to add currants and chopped walnuts to the cinnamon sugar mixture. I also make half of my batch with the cream cheese glaze and half with just the regular glaze for those who do not like cream cheese.  The rolls keeps in the freezer quite nicely as well. I just carefully wrap each roll in Glad Press and Seal then put the wrapped rolls in freezer bags. When I want one, I'd put in on the counter to thaw for 15 minutes or so. Then pop it in the microwave on medium for 30-45 seconds and VOILA!! I save money making my own as well as having portion control. Next time when I make these, I shall use other types of fillings such as fruits. Again, thank you for sharing!

This recipe is great! They came out soft and disappeared fast! I replaced one cup of flour with whole wheat and before rolling them I added some flax, sesame, pumpkin, sunflower and poppy seeds to the cinnamon to add some texture and the seed flavors I love. I will definitely be making them again

Well the old man was on a roll tonight and made my first batch of cinnamon rolls and only screwed up once! Mixed up the dough in the Kitchen aid and let it double in size and punched it down, rolled it out and then couldn't figure out why I had so much if the filling??!! After I finally got the dough cut and in the greased pan and then realized I had added the cream cheese to the filling! I went ahead and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and frosted them (I doubled the frosting) and tried one when they cooled a little. Gee but it tasted great!Not exactly like a Cinnabon but close enough for me. I'll make these again but make then the right way next time. Just another senior moment. 8^) ****UPDATE**** 12 hours later! 3 other people came by and I forced Cinnabons on to them (can't eat them by my self!)and they liked the cream cheese in the filling! I'll try the correct method once before doing the cream cheese in the filling trick again though!

AWESOME RECIPE! No problems or alterations at all. I used a bread machine that my mom has had for years that she has never used. As long as you follow the directions, you cannot mess up. The secret to baking is precision. One problem I ran into was cutting.. make sure to have a good knife when cutting dough! Icing was to die for.

Yummy! The taste was really like a real Cinnabon! I loved it. I had a few problems with mine because I did not read the reviews from those who have made them before. I did not use bread flour, or a bread maker. Also I used heavy cream instead of warm milk. The yeast took a very long time to dissolve into the heavy cream (I'm thinking milk would have been better but we never drink milk so I opted for a small carton of heavy cream-really wished milk came in tiny cartons) I used my fingers to incorporate the yeast into the cream/ which was really helpful. My dough did not raise as much as I wanted it to-next time i will use the proper flour and try letting it raise in a warm oven-method.   I added tons of cinnamon to the brown sugar. It was really delicious! My only problem with the filling is that it was not gooey like I wanted. Next time I think I will mix the filling with a bit of cream cheese, oil, and butter.   I really loved this recipe, and my comments were only meant for those who are novice bakers like myself :)   Yummy 5stars!

This was really fat fluffy dough, I loved how it looked, I don't know if it was just my oven,but I had gooey dough on the bottom and browned tops,so that was a bummer.  There was way too much cinnamon in this recipe, I used what was called for. It left my toddlers skin flaming red around her mouth, no need for that much, I will only use maybe 2 tsp. next time. Oh, yes there will be a next time, I am rating this recipe as is for now though.

These were delicious!  First time I've ever cooked anything with yeast.  I've always been nervous about baking with yeast.  I don't own a breadmaker but per several reviews I managed my way through it without one.  My dough didn't rise to double in size by any means, but I'm assuming it's my lack of experience working with yeast that caused this. Either way, it did rise somewhat and after rolling the dough with cinnimon mixture (i mixed all together before spreading on the dough) I let them sit awhile on top of the warm stove and they rose quite a bit more.  End result was great.  These did not last long at my house and I will most certainly make them again.  Hopefully I'll begin to get more acustomed to using yeast and can try more breads ect.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe

I don't own a breadmaker, so I prepared the bread portion of the recipe as recommended by another reviewer (one of the reviews on the main "Clone of a Cinnabon" page). The bread didn't double in size despite letting it rest for an hour. I bought brand new yeast too, so I'm not sure what happened. Despite that I had enough dough to prepare the recipe in the dimensions written and they were awesomely delicious. My wife and son both loved them too.

I'm not a fantastic cook, so I was a little nervous trying to make these...all I can say is HOW GREAT!!!! They were easy to make (with a bread machine) and tasted absolutely AMAZING! I know I will be making these many more times :)

I have had my go to cinnamon roll recipe for years, but found this one with the cream cheese icing.  OH my Gosh! these are great, Better than my old recipe!  I tried to keep to the recipe as written, but used only butter, (I don't use margerine), made without a bread machine, and made 1 1/2 times the icing. Very Good Highly Recommended.

What can I say delecious.  I am allergic to gluten so I cannot have cinnamon rolls unless I make them myself and use special flour(jules gluten free flour).  The last time I tried to make cinnamon rolls they turned out like BISCUITS so I was a little nervous, ALL I CAN SAY IS YUM!!! It totally fixed my craving.Cant wait to bake them again!!

Perfectly delicious in every way!  I did make a couple of changes though. I DID NOT USE A BREAD MACHINE. I was having trouble getting my yeast to activate and so I took a tip from my dinner rolls recipe.  Instead of using 1 c. milk, I heated 1/2 c. milk and 1/2 c. water in the microwave for 45 seconds.  Then I dissolved the sugar and then added the yeast.  It activated just right.  Then I followed the directions. I did mix the butter, sugar and cinnamon together and spread it out over the dough.  I had no problem with the mixture dripping out.  In fact, when I tried to turn the pan upside down, my rolls almost fell out!  So, this recipe will be my #1 cinnamon roll recipe.  Can't wait to bake these for Christmas morning!

These cinnamon rolls are absolutely amazing!  It's such a treat when we get to have them.  I always put extra icing!  If you only try one recipe from this website, this should be it.

These were amazing!  My family loved them and what a great treat!  They tasted just like Cinnabon!  I used the tip to turn the pan over...what a great tip.  I have always struggled with the sugar at the bottom, this got rid of the problem.  I also doubled the icing, but it made way too much, so I have saved it for the next time I make these cinnamon buns!

These were so good that it made me write my first review.  I also made them the night before and put them in the fridge.  They went in the in the oven the next morning and I made the icing while they were cooking.  GREAT!

My daughter and I made these this weekend and they were sooo good!  I have a bread machine but have never used it, thought about getting it out for this recipe but at the last minute decided not to.  We doubled the recipe so my daughter could make hers and I could make mine.  We had to knead the dough about 10 minutes.   I drizzled my frosting on and she doubled the frosting and spread it on hers.  But, both ways were totally wonderful and everybody loved them.  The only way you could go wrong is not making enough, lol.

I have tried several versions of cinnamon roll recipes and this one is absolutely the BEST!  I added a little extra cinnamon/sugar to the rolls. They also work awesome prepared the night before!  Just take them out of the fridge about 1/2 hour before cooking and then throw them in the oven... YUM!

These tasted veerrryyyy good, however make sure you stick them with a toothpick before pulling them completly out of the overn!! I had to put mine back in the oven with the glaze on them, and it turned carmely!  I dont want anyone to have the experience that I did, but I could tell when I first took a bite that they would have tasted like perfection if I wouldnt have under cooked them!

These were so YUMMY! Almost criminal! I made these with splenda brown sugar for the filling and they were delicious. Frosting never made it on the rolls and still so yummy! This is definately a keeper! This recipe made 12 HUGE rolls!

I have found these are best if prepared (not baked) the night before and refridgerated, I take them out about two hours before I want them ready and let them rise and come back to room temperature.  This makes having them ready in the morning a lot easier.  They are too good to pass up.  Not cinnabon...BETTER because I didn't have to take out a small loan to have a pan full!

I served these to my in-laws; they loved them and so did I! I did not have brown sugar that day so I used white and they were still wonderful. Many thanks to the baker who posted them. No offense but whoever said they were dry might have measured incorrectly.

The cinnabon came out of the oven nice! I added some raisin and chopped almond. However, my frosting became yellow instead of white, maybe because i didn't softened the cream cheese properly. I regret following other reviewer's advice to double the frosting because they are too sweet (for me). These rolls are best accompanied with black coffee, for me to cut of the sweetness...it does came close to cinnabon though! cheers!

The baking temperature is way too high for my oven, and I baked it on 190 C, as they started to burn on the top and the middle wasn't baked yet, so I covered them with a foil and let them bake this way..... next time I will try 170 for about 25-30 mins.,  but other than that - outstanding!!!!  Can't wait for my Hubby to try them, I KNOW he will love them!!!!  Everyone should try this!

I want to make these rolls,however I have few questions? Where do you get bread flour? Or can you use all purpose flour? I checked my local grocery store and could not find it, can you only get it from a specialty store? Any help would be appreciated. I would really love to make these rolls they look so yummy!

I made these for the office and they didn't last an hour!  The only thing I would alter is the amount of time the dough spent in the bread machine.  When the dough is completely mixed, I would take it out and put it in a covered bowl on top of a heating pad or a warm oven.  I just think the dough cycle on my machine was too long and made the dough a little tough.  Otherwise, a perfect recipe!!

I've been reading that some people have had problems getting the dough to rise. Make sure that the dough ingredients are the correct temp as indicated in the recipe and that the yeast is not expired. I've made these several times and they always turn out great.

I am just now enjoying one of these fantastic cinnamon buns.  So easy to make with the help of my bread machine.  To speed up the process I bought cream cheese icing and smeared it over the warm buns.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used all purpose flour, no bread machine.  All measurement were exactly as posted.  I have to say if your rolls do not rise your yeast has to be dead, old, or you killed it.  These came out *huge*.  When they ran out of room on the sides they went straight up! My family voted these in as the new cinnamon rolls of the house.  Everyone loved them.

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and thought it was super easy! I did mix the butter and cinnamon/sugar together to help prevent the cinnamon and sugar from falling out. I also added more cinnamon and sugar just because I like my rolls really gooey! My son wantes them again so I'm going to try making them at night and baking them in the morning. Thanks for the great recipe!

The recipe was great.  There was a bit of operator error so I'm still giving this 5 stars.  I prepped these the night before and put them in the fridge.  The next morning I put them in a cold oven set to 350 and baked for 22 minutes.  The outer edges were a tad over done and the center was doughy.  I baked these in a pyrex glass pan.  Not sure where I went wrong but if they tasted this good even though they weren't baked right, I'm certainly willing to give this another go.

Wonderful Recipe!  Even though they take some time to make they were so easy!  I made 2 batches back to back and refridgerated overnight, took out in the morning and let set for about 1/2 hour before baking @ 400 for 15 minutes.  The first batch came out a little doughy and sunk a bit in the middle. So I baked the 2nd batch a little longer, they came out and looked perfect, but I actually preferred the taste of the doughy ones better :)

We all agreed on this rating...five stars all around! I made this recipe one day in advance, covered in saran and refrigerated it. I also made the frosting the day before, covered in saran and refrigerated it. In the morning, I took both the rolls and the frosting out while I preheated the oven. I baked at 350 for 30 minutes. It was absolutely delicious. I'd never made my own cinnamon rolls before and this was surprisingly easy. And there's no comparison to the ones you buy in the tubes at the store. It will be hard to buy those again now that we've tried these. Will definitely make this again!

Last time I made the recipe as written and it was good. However, after reading other members' reviews, I made a few alterations this time, with TERRIFIC results that I prefer to the original. I increased the filling by about 50% (used 1.5 cups brown sugar, 3.5T cinnamon, and 1/2 cup butter). I combined the melted butter, cinnamon, and sugar, and didn't have any trouble with filling falling out. I increased the filling, mostly so that I wouldn't have leftover cream cheese. I used 8oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 3 cups confectioners sugar, 1.5 teaspoons vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and about 5T milk. I divided it into 4...used 1/4 and froze 3/4 in 3 ziplocks. Lastly, I made 24 cinnamon rolls, which were plenty big. I baked them at 350 for about 20 minutes. At 400 degrees, I had trouble with the tops browning before the rolls were all the way cooked. YUM! By far, the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made.

Too die for. I made this for Mothers Day brunch   Mom said they were super everyone raved about them. I used parchment paper and mixed the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.     The recipe did not say to use light brown or dark brown sugar so I used dark brown, guess I got lucky dark was the way to go.  I will make this over and over but, I will have to reframe this are just tooo good

Ooey, gooey, cinnamon-y deliciousness! These turned out perfectly. They are a very soft 'breadlike' bun, and the dough (with only 4 c. flour) is a charm to work with. Made without a bread machine, I only had to knead for about 5 minutes and didn't even have to flour the counter to roll out. Really, I cannot express how lovely a dough this creates. There was too much frosting for my tastes - I would have preferred more of a light drizzle. What I got was a -very- generous smearing. In the future, I will make half the icing, to suit my own tastes. I will definitely be making these again, and I don't repeat recipes very often. Thank you!

Oh my gosh, these were fantastic. The bread machine really helps out. I made them for my mom for mothers day. The night before, I had them prepared and sitting in the pan with greased wax paper underneath them. The next morning, I turned on the oven, put the COLD rolls in the oven even before it was ready, and it was perfect. I got about fifteen good sized rolls out of this batch. Thank you for this recipe! UPDATE: I tried using shortening when making these and added a bit extra salt-I think they may have even turned out better this way!

When I made these the dough rose significantly. So instead of using the entire batch for cinnamon rolls I split the dough and used about 3/4 for cinnamon rolls and 1/4 for dinner rolls. Maybe I put in too much yeast? Didn't really measure that. I let them sit for awhile and they rose like crazy again. when I had placed them in the pan there was still a little space left at the end but once they cooked it definitely filled in. I cheated and used a can of cream cheese frosting for mine. I also added peanuts and raisins. I can never get my hubby to eat cinnamon rolls when we are out or when I purchase them but he loved these. Definitely saving this recipe forever.

I have a really great cinnamon roll recipe already but was excited to try this one.  I am sorry but I was a bit disappointed.  The dough was really tough...the rolls turned out more crisp than soft...and adding salt to the frosting??  What??  I may try this one again...only leaving out some of the flour for a softer dough...and cooking at 350* for a longer amount of time...and absolutely no salt in the frosting (yuck)...then I will add to this review :) 05/04/09:  I tried these again only this time I sifted the flour into the measuring cup making the dough softer and not as tough...then I used only 1/2 c. melted butter combined 2/3 C. brown sugar and 2 Tbs cinnamon...then I cooked at 350* until barely golden...then frosted while still warm...much better the second time around!!!  YUMMMM!! Changed rating from 2 star to 4 star

Awesome recipe!  I used the KitchenAid mixer for the dough (instead of bread machine). I then let the dough rise in the oven set at 200 degrees for 1 hour.  Assembled the rolls per the remainder of the recipe and set them in the fridge overnight.  I cooked them the next morning (Saturday) and made the frosting.  Delicious!  I was a hero for the whole day!  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made this recipe completely as-is, and it was WONDERFUL. I've never made cinnamon rolls before, so it actually took me a really long time, but it was well worth it!!! I was so glad I made a double batch!!! My husband and co-workers won't stop talking about how absolutely superb this recipe is. Thanks for sharing it!!

So delicious! Buttered wax paper is a must for the bottom of the pan. If you're having a hard time rolling out the dough to the right size, let it set for a minute or so then come back and the dough will have relaxed. Also, if you refrigerate it, cover it well. The tops of my rolls were a wee bit crunchy from exposure but other than that, AMAZING! Next time I'm going to add some cinnamon to the dough :)

These taste really delicious. I think I probably ate half of them myself :D In case anyone was debating, I also tried "soft, gooey cin..." from AR and I prefer this one.

Okay, I don´t know why I procrastinated so long for making this. It took me about 3 hours rising time included but it was totally worth it. I followed the recipe exactly, also added ground clove and I cannot even begin to say how great they are. I made them by hand and it wasn´t so hard to make. I also used wheat flour and they took between 15 and 20 mins to be done. You cannot die without trying this, you will be the hit of every party from now on. Oh, another good tip is when you let it rise: Boil a pot of water and put it on the bottom rack of the turned off oven and the dough on the top rack for it to rise in a warm and moist place. Superb!!

Awesome! Don't let this recipe intimidate you! It's easier than people say. I let mine raise for 30 minutes but they still came out a little too dense..but still delicious! Let raise longer than 30 minutes for fluffier dough. Must try this!

This was the 4th cinnamon roll recipe I have tried off of this site, and I have to say this is the best dough. It seems a little tough when it comes out of the bread machine, but once it is finished it has a very nice texture. As for the filling, I used the remainder of the stick of butter from the 1/3 cup, plus 1 stick, 2 TBSP cinnamon, and 2 tsp of vanilla all mixed together and spread on the dough. It was wonderful!! These also heat up nicely with just 45 seconds in the microwave.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. I dont have a bread machine so I just throw all of the dough ingredients into the mixer. Since you are using instant yeast there is no need to proof. Super easy and soooo yummy.

I was not very impressed with either the taste or ease of preparation of these cinnamon rolls, both my children and I were disappointed and they taste NOTHING like cinnabons. Other than that it was just okay. Will not make again.

I'm not sure how things worked out for everybody else.  I followed the instructions to a T (I even triple checked).  The dough was so thick that my bread maker couldn't handle the dough.  We made 40-50 loaves of bread in it without a problem.  Even made pizza dough in it without a problem.  Hope it all turns out.  /shrug

These are dangerously delicious!! I used my brilliant stand mixer for mixing (dissolving yeast in 115°  warm milk with a little of the sugar first) and unsalted butter instead of margarine. Proofed in warm oven (that had been heated to 200°  then turned OFF) with damp (and clean obviously) dish towel o'er bowl o' dough. Took about an hour to double. Assembled as directed. Upon removal of baked rolls from oven, be sure to flip them immediately to a serving pan/plate. When it comes to the frosting... don't mess around: use an 8oz pkg of cream cheese and double the other ingredients. Also, if you have a disposable latex or nitrile glove... you can frost them to perfection with your hands. AND! Since I'm not to keen on waking up at oh-dark-thirty to bake, assembly happened the evening before. In my groggy morning stupor, these go directly from fridge to oven (not even bothering to preheat)... perfect! Prepare to be loved!!

I've tried a lot of cinnamon roll recipes and this by far is the best one with a little tweek here and there. The filling does run during cooking and I tried flipping it over as one had said to do, and it worked. But on accident, I found something that worked even better. The first 15 minutes were cooked at a low heat of 295 degrees and then cranked up to 370 degrees for 6 minutes. The filling held togther in the roll and it came out perfect. Another thing I wanted to comment on was the way the dough turns out beautifuly and is so easy to work with. I'm going to try different fillings. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Perfect.  I used Move Over Butter in place of butter the whole time and I think i cut out some fat and calories without cutting out any taste.  My husband absolutely loves them.  The frosting is so fluffy and perfect as well.

I found that cutting the butter into the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture creates for less running of the filling.  My icing was very thick, I had to pop the rolls back in the oven with the icing on to get the icing to melt.

I followed the recipe exaclty except I used 6 oz of cream cheese in the icing. These were excellent. I made them the day before, put them in the fridge after I put them in the pan prior to them rising. The next morning I put them in a 200 degree oven for 45 minutes to help them rise, then baked them as directed. I will be making these for years to come.

I love this recipe!  One thing I do to make my morning easier is, I start the day before, I make the dough in my bread machine, roll it out, make my roll, and then put it in the refrigerator... next morning I heat my oven, bake my rolls and I'm out the door with fresh made rolls in hand!  And everyone thinks you are amazing!

I had never made cinnamon rolls before trying this recipe. I was under the impression they were hard to make, and although it was a time consuming process (3 hours start to finsh, though a large majority of that was waiting for the dough to rise), but it really was not difficult. I ended up using over half whole wheat flour because I ran out of white. I prefer to use all whole wheat flour, but didn't want to push it on my first try with cinnamon rolls. I'm glad I ran out, though, because they turned out great with the whole wheat addition. I will definitely try all whole wheat next time. I made the dough in my bread machine. Added the ingredients into the machine on the dough cycle, pressed start, and let it do it's thing for 90 minutes (that included mixing and rising). I did not do the icing, and am glad I didn't. They were great without. My husband and kids have been begging for them ever since! I'll definitely have to make them again!

Amazing recipe.  Unfortunately my first try was perfect.  My second try wasn't that fortunate.  I put them in a pirex tray and they started to rise immediately, they were so beautiful.  Then I put them to continue rising in the refrigerator.  Today (I made those last night) I went to put them in the oven and when I took the lid off... they had deflated!  They're done now, but total failure, they're not big and fluffy like they were the first time.  They never rose again.  I will still try the recipe again, it might have been my fault.  The first time it came out GREAT.

I've made these rolls many times by bread machine and by mixer, and they always turn out great!  I cut the recipe in half and find that it's plenty.  At Christmas, I made an orange-flavored cream cheese frosting, which was a nice change.  I recently used the dough to make a King Cake, and it is a such a versatile sweet dough!  I flavored the King Cake dough with lemon extract and frosted it with lemon frosting, and it was delicious!

These are absolutely fabulous! They really taste like they could have been bought at a bakery. They do take some time, but definately better than the store bought dough. I made the dough in the bread machine in the evening (took about 90 minutes). Then rolled it out and formed the rolls. Placed in covered, greased pan overnight. Then baked in the morning. Baked half and froze half. My only criticism is that I almost thought a little less sugar/cinnamon would be better.

Oh my goodness.  So good.  I'm always surprised but just how good these turn out, and the dough is really fun to work with!  DELICIOUS!  Other bonus, people can't believe they're homemade if you bring them to a gathering.  Gets you instant acclaim at potlucks, etc.

AMAZING!  OVERNIGHT directions:  Prepare as in recipe.  For second rise cover in plastic wrap and place in fridge overnight.  Remove from oven 1 hour before baking and bake as directed.  I did not use my bread maker, just mixed as directed.  To me they tasted just like a cinnabon, found our new Xmas morning recipe.

Even accidentally adding the cinnamon, sugar, and butter (the filling) to the breadmaker to incorporate into the dough didn't ruin these! I did another batch of filling before I finished them per the actual directions and topped with icing. Still incredibly wonderful - smelled, tasted, and looked great! The boyfriend and I both gave them 5 stars

I thought these cinnamon rolls were easy to make, and the results were so professional that my hubby, who wasn't home when I made them, expressed doubt that I had made them myself. (As in, "did you REALLY make these yourself?") They came together quickly - I used the 'dough' setting on my bread machine. I followed the recipe exactly. Quantities were perfect. It made a dozen big, gooey rolls that, once rise time was allowed for, baked quickly! The biggest part of the time allowance is in rise time. Actual making/dough handling time is quite minimal. A great snow-day treat for the kids.

This recipe truly is fabulous! For those of us looking out on the healthy side (or trying!), think about cutting the dough in half once you remove it from the bread machine. Roll each half separately and coat with cinnamon/sugar as directed, using half the mixture for each rolled half of dough. Bake about 2-3 minutes less. This results in twice as many cinna"mini" rolls! Plus, you won't feel so guilty when you want to eat two...which will almost certainly be the case. :o) Enjoy!

this recipe made me become a member.... this is the BEST cinnamon bun recipe. I used  one packet highly active yeast instead of bread machine yeast. left in in (Turned off) 200 degree oven... I also, made extra cinnamon mixture added chopped pecans and sprinkled on bottom of pan. Waited a couple mins, fliped pan and iced after one minute...TERRIFIC!!!!

My first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls...EXCELLENT!  I did not use a bread machine.  I used 1 packet yeast. I warmed the milk and butter in the microwave then combined it with the dry ingredients.  Mixed with a hand mixer just until combined, then kneaded for about 5 minutes on a floured surface.  Heated oven to 200 degrees, turned off and let rise for 1 hour, then followed recipe.  After I took them out of the oven, I flipped them onto a piece of parchment paper.  Looking forward to making them again!

These are amazing! I can't stop making them... or eating them!  I have received so many compliments and requests already. My recommendations are: cut back a little on the cream cheese and add a little extra butter & powdered sugar if you don't like the flavor of a rich cream cheese icing.  Also, mix the butter with the cin. sugar mixture so it sticks to the dough easier.

I can't believe this!  I have tried about 35 recipes involving yeast. I'm serious. I am NOT exaggerating. I kept trying different recipes because my yeast would not rise, no matter what I tried. With this cinnabon recipe, I decided to try yeast one more time. This recipe used milk, instead of water, and guess what happened? The dough was bubbling so much, that it almost came out of my glass mixing bowl. I was ecstatic!  It was great. The cinnamon rolls turned out wonderfully sweet, and they were so light. I am planning on using the same basic dough for yeast rolls.  I would just leave out the cinnamon and so much sugar. (Just a thought!)

Simply amazing!  Works great to make a day ahead of time and refrigerate until needed.  Just let stand at room temp for about 30 minutes before baking.  Don't forget to invert onto a serving platter immediately after removing from oven.

Worked perfectly without any change. I also made a cinnamon braid using the same dough, filling (with the addition of raisins) and frosting, with great results.

As a previous reviewer suggested, you MUST flip the pan of rolls over right after you bring them out of the oven. These are so much better when you retain all of the gooey sugar mixture on the rolls!

Yummy flavour but definitely a decadent "treat" for special occassions only as it was quite filling and rich!!  Made this for Christmas Brunch and actually overbaked them since I had cut out 21 rolls instead of 12 (duhhh - but it was late & I was tired) and did not realize my error until they had already baked for 15 mins.  This made them hard around the edges so to remedy this, I sprinkled some water on the buns with my finger tips and put them in the microwave covered for 1 minute.  This also works for warming rolls straight from the fridge (30 secs/roll - add 10 secs for each additional roll).  I found the frosting to be a bit pasty, not smooth like what you get from Cinnabon so I added a touch of milk and that helped.

WOW!  These are GREAT!  I used the bread maching for the dough and it came out perfect.  Thanks for the tip on flipping them when they come out, it made them wonderfully gooey, (just like at the mall)!  I'll make these every Christmas.

Oh my goodness--what a treat!  My husband honestly did not believe that I had made these from scratch.  (He's taking the pan into work so he won't eat them all himself;) )  
I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to the dough before making it, and when it came time for the butter and cinnamon filling, I simmered the butter and sugar together so it became more of a paste and did not drain out of the rolls after cooking.  I also added some chopped spiced nuts before rolling up.
Thank you for a wonderful recipe to work with.  I will definitely make these again.....I'm seeing chocolate chips in the next filling, maybe a caramel butterscotch flavor another time :)
Blessings!

These were good, and the frosting was awesome (I used only half of it, though)! I don't have a bread machine, so I kneaded the dough by hand. My only problem was that they didn't seem to bake easily - I baked them for 20 minutes in 400 F, as the recipe stated, and they were totally white. I then lowered the temperature to 350 and put them in for another 25 minutes. Again, they didn't come out "golden", but looked underbaked. And their texture was harder than what I had expected.

The flavor of this recipe was outstanding.  The filling, the bread itself, and the icing were all top notch.  However, I made my rolls in 9x9" pans, and there is no possible way to cook them completely if you're cooking them at 400*F for only 15 minutes.  I found that I had to turn the heat down to 350*F and cook them for at least 45 min. to get the center to raise/cook and not burn the outer rolls.  
This recipe is definitely a keeper

So very good!  Not too hard to make.  I don't have a bread machine, I just used my Kitchen Aid mixer, came out WONDERFUL!  I did follow another reviewer's advice: bake at 350 for 20 minutes, they came out so perfect.  Yummy!

This tastes so good out of the oven.  I'm going to bring these to work tomorrow so I won't eat them all myself!  I adjusted the recipe to make 18 buns instead of 12 otherwise I followed the recipe exactly (rare for me).  The amount of cream cheese frosting is too much for me.  Next time I'll halve it.

These were very yummy!  I made them with whole wheat bread flour and they still turned out really good.  I also just topped them with a glaze because i had run out of cream cheese.  I will definately make them again.  Thanks for the recipe.

These took a bit more work than I normally expend in the kitchen for a morning treat - but they were so well worth it. I didn't have bread flour o hand so used the AP flour instead - and they came out fine. The only thing I was unclear on was how long I should wait to frost them, and in hindsight, I should have probably given them about 10 minutes out of the oven before doing so. I think the icing weighed them down too much as they cooled. But they were still delicious and decadent! Highly recommened!!!

These were amazing! I've never had Cinnabon, so I don't know how they compare, but these were great! I made them for a brunch with some of my girlfriends and everyone loved them! Made the dough the night before in the breadmachine and with my mom's help, assembled them and put the pan in the fridge overnight, covered with plastic wrap sprayed with nonstick spray. I took them out of the fridge the next morning and let them sit for a couple hours before baking them. They didn't rise at all before I put them in the oven, so I was a little concerned. But they turned out perfectly! I didn't have any cream cheese, so for icing I mixed powdered sugar and vanilla caramel flavored non-dairy creamer until it was spreadable. Very sweet, but verrry good! Will definitely make these again!

Absolutely fantastic! Finger-licking, no-leftover, scent-the-house fabulous! Follow the recipe exactly, except I generally have too much icing. 
Thank you ANDYTAMI for posting a review with instructions for the no-bread-machine version! Works like a charm!

This is very good but not the best recipe.  I thought the dough needed a little more oil/butter.  I may fiddle with it to make it prefect.

I made this recipe last night and my husband said they were the best homemade cinnamon rolls he's ever tasted.  He took them with him to school and they were gone in seconds!  (I made them by hand and it was so easy!  I just followed the yeast instructions outlined on the bottle and ignored the comment suggestions.)  Easy and delicious!  I'll be making this again soon!

They were delicious for sure, but the texture was more cakey than rolly for me. I did not use a bread machine and that may have had something to do with it. I just mixed everything up in my mixer with dough hooks. The dough held together well and they were simple to make. The first batch turned out perfect!

I make smaller Cinnamon rolls when I make these, making twice as many, then freeze half.  My kids can't eat a monster-sized cinnamon roll, and although I can, I shouldn't!  I also make the frosting ahead and then freeze glbs in individual plastic wrap.  That way I can just bring out as many as I need after they bake.  Often, my son doesn't want any frosting.  Or sometimes I frost with a simple sugar glaze (1 cup powder sugar, 1 TB milk, 1 tsp. vanilla).  Obviously, this topping is not as rich.  But like I said, I have frozen cream cheese frosting for anyone who prefers the rich stuff.

The texture of these was just phenomenal! Very soft on the inside and a bit chewy on the outside. I thought I had a favorite cinnamon roll recipe but this has definitely replaced my old one. I did however think that the icing was too too sweet, so I think half or less would be fine, as the rolls alone are very sweet. Thanks for this great recipe!

This recipe certainly didn't blow me away.  They were good - we ate them all - but I won't make them again.  I've been trying various cinnamon roll recipes in search of that "perfect" recipe, and my whole family agreed I've used better recipes in the past.

My brother came down to FL from MO.  I made this for the first time, and it was a great hit.  It was a little time consuming but well worth the effort.  I would have liked a little lighter dough.  Otherwise will make this again for sure.

This recipe is delicious, and not too difficult with the bread machine. The dough was very sticky near the end of the mixing cycle, so I added about 1 tablespoon of flour to the dough. I didn't have cream cheese so I had to use a different icing recipe. They were still great!

This recipe is amazing. The bread/dough in this recipe was getting rave reviews and i have had people tell me that these were the best cinnamon rolls that they have ever had. **One change** I added a half a box of butterscotch instant pudding to the flour before making the dough. I don't know how big of a change this actually made...I'll have to try it once with out. This recipe is for sure a keeper!

I don't exactly follow the recipe verbatim.  I add a little vanilla to the dough mix, follow the directions till baking time, then I bake for about 13 minutes vs the 18.  I also do not follow the directions for the icing.  I use about 1/2 c REAL BUTTER, 6 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese, and just start dumping in the powdered sugar until its the right taste for me.

These are great.  They were my late father-in-laws favorite cinnamon roll.
I use my bread machine to make the dough. Very easy.

This recipe is everyone's request when they come to our house.  The rolls freeze beautifully, just freeze on sheet tray and once frozen place in container to keep icing in place.  Then when company arrives or someone stops in for coffee, a thirty second microwave makes it "fresh baked" tasty.

I haven't actually eaten these yet, they are in the final rise.  I've been letting them rise in the fridge as another reviewer suggested and it's been working out well.  With the first rise, I let it spend the last 10 - 15 minutes in a warm oven to make sure it had risen thoroughly, and I'll set the pan on the stove while the oven is preheating before baking for the same reason.  I also mixed the butter, cinnamon, and sugar together and spread it on the dough.  I halved the recipe to make 12 mini-buns.  I made the full amount of frosting, though.  When making the frosting (which I've tasted and is so rich and delicious, almost too much), I added only 1 cup of sugar.  For texture and sweetness, it really didn't need anymore, and I think the richness of the butter and cream cheese comes through better this way.  I am looking forward to eating them tonight.

I made these tonight and they are great.The only changes I made was I lowered the temp. to 350 deg. and I added chopped pecans on top of the brown sugar mixture.I frosted what we ate but left the others unfrosted.I think we heat the rolls up in the microwave and frost them as we eat them.Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I reduced this recipe like crazy but it was still so wonderful. The cream cheese icing could stand to be a tad sweeter, but that might just be my personal preference.

This was a very good cinnamon roll recipe. I have not had a cinnamon roll from Cinnabon in quite some time so I don't know how close it is to them. I will make these again. The family loved them.

I am assuming this recipe failed because I am in high altitude (6200 ft).  I thought I made the correct amendments and I even let it rise for waaaay longer than called for, but they were still pretty dense.  The whole deal took me almost 6 hours to make.  Also, I didn't use a bread machine- but I used the directions from a previous review. 

I would also put cinnamon in the dough, it is kind of 'flour-y' tasting.  The icing is awesome though, and fortunately I made way too much :)

These are wonderful.  I have made them for guests and they asked for the recipe.  My husband is not crazy about the cream cheese icing, so I will make it with regular powder sugar icing for him.  Yummy both ways!

These cinnamon rolls are absolutely fabulous! I had to let the rolled & cut rolls rise a little longer than 30 minutes to fill up the pan. Next time I will bake them at 350 and start watching them around 15 minutes. They came out fine, they were just a little more browned than I prefer. Thanks for sharing!!!!

These tasted wonderful and looked amazing! These may even be better than cinnabon's, they were definitely more gooey and soft which is how I prefer my cinnamon rolls. This is definitely a keeper, I love this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!

Awesome taste but very time consuming!  Baked at 350 for about 25 mins. in a glass dish and immediately flipped over onto a waxed paper lined baking sheet when done (even used a spatula to scrape out what was left and put it back on top of the rolls).  Oh and measuring and using dental floss to cut was a great idea.  Thanks!

Much better than cinnabon, but still not our favorite homemade cinnamon roll.
Definitely do line the pan and turn upside down, as the filling leaks out and makes a big sticky mess in the bottom of the pan.  By inverting quickly, that is saved on the rolls.

I have made these twice, and they always turn out dry like all cinnamon buns I make! I dont know if its me or just the cinnamon buns, I want a STICKY, gooey cinnamon bun but cannot find a recipe. I usually add some corn syrup to the cinnamon mix, which runs to the bottom of the pan and when inverted creates a gooey outside.

These do taste like the Cinnabon cinnamon rolls that you get at the mall.  However, you have to bake them just right.  I made these in 2 batches.  The first batch, I let cook until they were golden brown as the recipe states.  They were dry and the sugar that came out of the cinnamon rolls at the bottom hardened.  I made the second batch and took them out right before they browned.  I cut into one to make sure they were cooked all the way through.  They were perfect this way!  Also, I did not use my bread machine.  For those of you that do you use the bread machine, it takes about 3 hours to rise.

Wow! I've made this recipe for family reunions and dinners and there always gone by the time I leave. The first three times I made this recipe, I followed it and didn't make any changes. The fourth time, I added a splash of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough. It was fantastic!

These are soooo good!  I made them without a bread machine, as someone else suggested, and they were great!  The dough didn't raise as much as I thought it should but it was probably my fault anyhow!  All of my co-workers gobbled these up!  Very good!

Impressive if you've never made homemade cinnamon rolls before, but nothing out of the ordinary compared to other cinnamon roll recipes I've tried.  Just your basic homemade cinnamon roll.  I think the thing that sells this recipe is that it is so easy to toss the ingredients into the bread machine and let it do most of the work, but you can do that with any recipe, so...  Anyway, I just wasn't all that impressed.  Good, but not the best ever.

This is the real deal - and I'm not the world's most accomplished baker (by any stretch)! My family thinks I'm brilliant for creating these fantastic cinnamon rolls! I'll bask in the glow of this recipe a few days more before I attempt anything else...usually it's hit and miss with my baking, but double up the frosting and make these babies and you've got a HIT!!

These are really really good!  I halved the recipe and ended up with 12 reasonable sized rolls so the original recipe must make HUUUGE rolls!  For the filling I melted the butter and added a tsp of vanilla and spread that over the top and then sprinkled over the cinnamon sugar - I also added a couple of pinches of mixed spice to the filling.  I also halved the frosting recipe and added a few drops of lemon juice.  I warmed the frosting in the microwave and only ended up using half of it.  I love these so much I think I am going to make a full batch (but cut into 24 rolls) tomorrow and treat everyone at work on monday with yummy cinnamon rolls for morning tea.

Cinnabon? Not quite, but it sure is good! Both my boyfriend and my roommate thought the cinnamon rolls were darn near heavenly. 

I did the kneeding by hand and just used a single packet of regular yeast which worked out good for me. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the dough as some people suggested. 

Next time I plan on making and adding a bit more of the cinnamon mixture. I also plan on NOT making a double batch of frosting. The double batch I made was waaaaay more than enough.

The flavor on these was fantastic!!!!  And the dough itself behaved perfectly.  I made them by hand (no bread machine) and used AP flour and added vital wheat gluten, to make it more like bread flour.  However, 400 degrees is waaaaay too hot, they went from doughy to burned in about 2 minutes, so I'm going to give them another shot tomorrow and going to drop the temperature down.  Definitely a good recipe though, I'm excited to have them not burned!

I just made this today, It was pretty good.  I made it with 2 cups all purpose flour and 2.5 cups whole wheat flour, my family loved it.  The results might have been different if I followed the recipe exactly, but for a first try, they came out great.  and yes, remove them immediately when they come out of the oven, I left mine for a minute and they were stuck :)

OH MY GOODNESS! This is the best cinnamon roll I've ever eaten. I've never had a cinnabon, so I can't compare. I added cinnamon & pure vanilla to dough. I used butter rather than margarine. For the icing, I used 8 oz ff cream cheese, and doubled the rest of the ingredients. I just tried one, and they are to die for! My husband has been begging me to bake; he's going to come home to a great smelling house and clone of a cinnabon....makings for one happy man!

Perfect the way it is!!! Just make sure to turn them upside down for a couple minutes and there's nothing better. Totally worth the wait.

I love this recipe! I am diabetic and I often bake things with splenda substitutions and most times they turn out a pale shadow of the sugared version. This recipe however turned out tasty and full-bodied. Unfortunately there is no splenda substitute for confectioner's sugar but that frosting is "to die for"!

My husband will drive out of his way to go to the Cinnobon store but not anymore...when I made these, he thought that I had bought them...he said he could not taste any difference between these and the store bought ones. Very good! Also good to freeze them individually then eat one whenever you'd like!

Just took these out of the oven. I did turn the pan upside down so the sugar would melt back into the rolls as someone suggested. They are incredible!My grandchildren devoured them. These will be a regular in our house. Thanks for the GREAT recipe :)

These rock! The only criticism I have is to let them bake maybe 1-2 minutes later. The dough doesn't seem quite done, but that could be a factor of the cinnamon/butter making the dough chewy.

This is completely excellent. I plan to add walnuts to my next batch, and maybe use 1/2 tsp of almond flavoring to the icing instead of vanilla.

I made these with wheat bread flour and they were still delicious! Also, I refrigerated the rolls overnight so I could bake them fresh in the morning. I forgot that they were much colder than room temperature so I had doughy rolls at first. Popped them back in for 30 minutes and they were perfect :). These don't last long and everyone raves about how awesome they are. Oh! One more thing, I can't figure out how to use dental floss to cut them (they always get squished) so I just use a super sharp chef's knife.

Amazing! I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and my kitchenaid instead of a bread machine, and they turned out fantastic. This recipe should be named "better than a Cinnabon" because they really are!!

Very rich & delicious. Made recipe as stated, there was more than enough icing. This is a bit time-intensive, but definitely not labor-intensive. Well worth it on those special occasions.

These were AMAZING!!! I mixed them up last night and let them rise. Then I put half in the freezer and half in the fridge for the morning. I took them out and let them come to room temperature while the over pre-heated. I baked them for 10 minutes at 400 and 10 minutes at 350 (based on previous comments). To be honest I don't really like cinnamon rolls, but I'm a fan now! My boyfriend said that these were the best "sweet" thing either one of us have ever made... and we love to back so that says a lot.

This recipe deserves more than 5 stars, it is sooooooo good.  My brother made the comment that they were the best tasting cinnamon rolls he's ever tasted.  Then wondered where the second pan was!  Everyone LOVED them.  This recipe is easy enough for a beginner like me!  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

Excellent! I have never had a cinnabon, so I didn't have anything to compare these to, but they came out wonderfully! I made the dough in my bread machine and managed to get 15 rolls instead of 12 and they fit wonderfully in my 9x13 pan. The frosting tasted great and had the perfect consistency and I spread it on when the rolls were fresh out of the oven and it dripped around the rolls and they were excellent. Will make again and again because it was easy and everyone loved them!

This recipe is the best!  I have seen it for a while but had been a bit intimidated to try it because I don't have much experience making bread.  It was extremely easy and delicious!  I could not believe how much like Cinnabon these rolls tasted!  I brought it to my sister and she said if she didn't know she would have thought they were from Cinnabon!!!  Also, the icing was perfect, and tasted just like Cinnabon's.  I am so excited about how much money I will save not buying these any more!!!  Thank you for this recipe!!!!

Loved this one. Didn't have any problems with it. One thing though is, I made the icing and only ended up using half of it, because there was so much of it! So I just ended up making more cinnamon buns the next day and using up the rest of the icing!

Very good cinnamon rolls, but I agree with the other reviewer that the cooking temp and time is way off. 400 degree oven is way to hot of an oven and the time to cook them is too short. Mine were done on the outside, perfectly, but still doughy inside. I had to stick them back in the oven and cook them longer. Next time I will use a oven at 350 or 300 and just cook them longer. Also I really think the brown sugar/cinnamon mix was too much! I didnt even use all mine. Otherwise, pretty darn good!

Wow, I was not impressed with these at all.  The dough came out fine, meaning I had no trouble with the rise, but the overall cinnamon bun was just way to sweet for our family.  The filling leaked out all over the bottom and the buns were somewhat dry. I love cinnamon rolls so I will try out some other recipes.

i gave this recipe two tries, both bombed. i don't understand all the raving about it, they are just plain cinnamon rolls, nothing special in my opinion. the first time i made them i used white sugar w/ cinnamon because i was out of brown sugar, and a plain sugar glaze as i was out of cream cheese, i baked according to the directions and they were doughy in the center. the second time i made them, i used the brown sugar according to directions, the only changes i made from original recipe was in the baking time, an extra 5 minutes, and the frosting, i used orange extract instead of vanilla, a personal taste prefrence. i will definatly not make these again, will go back to my favorite cinnamon roll recipe.

very yummy -- but i felt the dough was too dry (not as moist as Cinnabon's)...next time i will take the advice of another reviewer -->don't skimp on the butter in the filling...and don't melt it either! make a paste with the butter/cinnamon,sugar filling...will definitely try these again!

All I can say is WOW!  This REALLY tastes like a Cinnabon!  I cheated a bit, and these were even more simple to make.  I used three, 1 lb. loaves of frozen bread dough, thawed.  I increased the butter to 1/2 cup, and the brown sugar and cinanmon increased accordingly.  I mixed the butter and sugar together to form a "paste" which I spread on the dough.  Since the bread dough was shaped into loaves, I rolled each one up with 1/3 of the sugar/butter mixture.  The total amt came to about 1 9x13 pan and 1 8x8 square pan of rolls.  I also doubled the amt of frosting, because we like it gooey and sweet.  This was a GREAT recipe, and the prepared dough tasted just the like the way it's supposed to.  YUM!!!!!!!!!

Makes a good cinnamon roll, but I didn't think they were anything above average.  Then again, I've never had a real cinnabon, so who knows...

These always turn out great! I don't use a bread machine so i make a few changes. I dissolve the sugar in the warm milk and then proof the yeast(I just use regular yeast.) Then I add everything except the eggs and butter. I mix those in before the last cup of flour. I let it rise in a warm place for an hour and then punch it down and roll them out. Then I follow the recipe exactly! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Definitely NOT a cinnabon, but a good cinnamon roll. I followed the recipe exactly and here are the problems I ran into: The brown sugar did not fully cook and was still grainy when eating the cinnamon roll, there was not a lot of "goo", and it was super duper sugary sweet. Here are the changes I will most likely make next time: I will cook it at a slower temperature, longer to try and cook all the brown sugar; I will blend a little white sugar and brown sugar instead of just plain brown sugar; and I will add a little more butter to the top of the cinnamon rolls.

Made them this morning. EXCELLENT. Next time though, I will put more filling in, as I didnt think there was enough. Otherwise they were some of the best I've ever made, tender and YUMMY! I did follow the suggestions of others and converted the recipe and made them by hand, also flipping the pan was a great tip, so thanks for that, it helped. I made icing with powdered sugar, a few drops of milk and some vanilla bean. It was just enough sweetness without being overpowering.

I'm going to have to try to make these again. They just came out way too dense. Almost like a biscuit with cinnamon, sugar, and frosting. I'm assuming I didn't let them rise long enough but after 4 hours of rising I just assumed they had done all they were going to do. I think I'm going to try them again tomorrow. I will *hopefully post a 5 star rating then.

YUMMY!We really enjoyed this recipe. I made 1 1\2 recipe of the brown sugar\cinnamon mixture. I also used one stick of butter for the filling. It really was a clone of a cinnabon!!

These were great, and really easy if you use frozen bread loaf from the groccery store. I read other reviews before I started, and used the following hints: mix the butter and cinnamon/sugar to make a spread. It gets pretty soft, and I cut them thin (store loaf makes 9 thin, not 12 huge), so I used a spatula to transfer them to the pan. I planned to flip them onto a sheet pan after they cooked, so I used the hint to put a thin layer of melted butter in the bottom of the pan and then greased the sides. Grease the corners WELL - that's the only place they stuck once flipped. Let the pan sit on top to let all of the goo run for a few minutes! I let mine rise in a pre-warmed, shut OFF oven (200 degrees) oven with the pan of water, and it still took an hour. I also lowered the cooking temp. to 350 and added 5+ min. so they weren't as 'crusty'. For the frosting, I used 1/2 cup less confectioners sugar, as I am not a frosting person, and it was nice and cream-cheesy, not as sweet. I put a little on top of each, and then set out the rest so people could frost them to suit their own taste. The changes I followed only affected the cooking/presentation, not the flavor, and these were truely awsome. If you skip the dough-making, these are SUPER easy, with BIG, BIG taste for surprisingly little effort! Thanks for the great recipe - my mom is already planning the next batch for Easter Brunch!!

Like this needs another review, but, if there is anyone reading this with a 3 yr old like mine, this needs to be said:  Not only are these as good or maybe better than Cinnabon, MY 3yo ATE THEM!  Not one, but 4!!  He is the pickiest of all 5 kiddos, and he ate these!!  They were sooo good!  I did slice them into 24 instead of 12, though.  We aren't "mall people" so my kids have never even heard of Cinnabon.  But my hubby and I recalled the days BC when we enjoyed the mall.  You know, Jean's West, Orange Julius, stop to peg my jeans, buy socks to match my shirt to go with my sparkling white Keds, go to the bathroom to get my hair bigger, then finish it all off with a big, fat,  Cinnabon!  Good times, good times.
Thanks for the memories!

Very good, but I made a few minor alterations.  First, I add raisins to the filling.  Second, I pour melted butter into the bottom of the baking pan before adding the rolls.  Just a good skim of melted butter and then you turn out the rolls right when they come out of the oven.  Rich and gooey!!

I made these buns for the last 3 years twice a month for our apartment complex.  They were so loved that if they were ever left off my menu I heard moans, complaints and pleading for them to be at the next brunch.  They really are as good as everyone says!

Deeeelish! I just recently got a breadmaker and these are my first attempt with using the dough setting or even making homemade cinnamon rolls at all! I must say that I will be making these again and again! Yum-o!

This recipe was so easy. I always have these ingredients on hand. I love almonds so I toasted some sliced almonds and sprinkled them on top. No need for paying retail for these anymore! Thanks for sharing.

Great Recipe!!! So soft and sweet. Perfect. Although I have to say that I switch out the margarine for butter but that’s my own preference. It came out beautiful.

Great tasting, melts in your mouth flavor. Only thing I changed was 2 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon not 2 1/2 Tablespoons.

Made these for christmas morning. They add such a festive smell to our present opening.
I prepared the dough the night before and just popped it in the oven in the A.M. This one will be with us for many holidays to come!

these were really, really good. I made 	cinnamon rolls for the first time and they turned out just great. I made the dough in my bread maker - just can't do yeast dough on my own. I rolled out the dough very thin, so that the filling wasn't really enough and the rolls turned out a little bit too dry for my taste.  Next time  I will just double the filling.

These were great.  They are best right out of the oven of coarse.  If saving some for later, be sure to wrap up quickly after you have let them cool.  Next time, I might try a different icing.
Thanks for sharing

This was great, but next time I think I'll use a mix of bread flour and regular flour.  The bread flour makes it a little tough.  Thanks!

Soooo good, so easy! The recipe seems like it has too much brown sugar mix, but in the finished product it was great (my sister said they were better than my Mum's - ooops)! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

These are, sorry, _were_ great! I dind't do any frosting and they were still great! They had a little cinnamon-caramel sauce underneath after baking. I should try to produce more of it ;-) I don't have a bread machine, just trew everything in my machine with kneading hook. The dough was perfect and relatively easy to work with. The rolling was a bit tough, but worked in the end. I used a cheese knife (serrated with holes in it, so that the cheese won't stick to it) to cut the dough - it worked perfectly. Thanks for the great recipe! I can't wait to do it again!

My 4 kids love this recipe.  I have made it 3 times since X-mas!  My son, who is a very picky eater, loves these buns warmed up for breakfast and for snacks-- he even asked me to add raisins!  His twin doesn't like the raisins so you can easily only add them to one side.

Unbelievably good!  These are easily the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had.  I make them in my food processor, first I proof the yeast in 1/4 cup of the milk with a teaspoon of the sugar.  Then I put the flour, salt, and remaining sugar in the work bowl.  Start the processor and while running add the melted butter, the eggs, remaining milk, and finally the yeast mixture.  Allow the dough to come together and be kneaded by the dough hook until elastic and then I proceed as the directions say.  I've made these three times in one week so far.  There is PLENTY of icing for my taste, I can't imagine needing to double it!

These are PERFECT.  I used my KitchenAid with the dough hook instead of a bread machine, allowing the yeast to bloom in the warm milk and sugar for 10 minutes first.  Like many suggested, I heated the oven to 200 degrees then turned it off, letting the dough rise in an oiled bowl for an hour.  My dough was very sticky, so I floured my counter and rolling pin generously.  I just melted margarine and used a pastry brush to spread it across the dough once rolled out, then sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I rolled from the long side, cut 12 rolls at 1.5 inches, and cooked them 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  I also used all margarine instead of butter, just because it was what I had on hand, and everything came out great.  A lot of time and some trouble, but definitely well worth it!

Outstanding.  The dough was nice, not too "bready," and the icing was scrumptuous.  Next time I might cut back on the flour by 1/2 cup and try adding raisins.  Like any great recipe, this is begging for a little experimentation.

Wow! What a cinnamon bun! I think that the result was well worth the three hour wait. The dough has a perfect flavor, not bland, like I find many other cinnamon bun doughs to have. I found myself having too much brown sugar/cinnamon mixture, so just before the buns were put in the oven, I added a spoonful of brown sugar/cinnamon on top. Perfect! Like many other reviewers, I flipped the buns over so that the cinnamon coating would run over the rest of the bun.
I found myself also having too much icing, but in this case, that was not a bad thing. This icing is perfect!

Thanks so much for sharing such a great recipe. I definitely be making these again!

I've got to say, I'm not a big fan of cinnamon rolls but these are great. I did a test run before I made them for my Dad's 50th birthday party and my husband and daughter loved them. I did add pecans to the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture for a little bite. These are better than my Mom's. Thank you for this recipe!

A trick to keep the filling in where it belongs - mix in some flour. Make a 'paste' filling. Yum.

These were so DELICIOUS!!  I ate most of them myself!!!  I made them in my kitchenaid mixer instead of the bread machine.  I took the advice of other reviews and warmed the oven to 200 degrees, then turned off to let the dough rise.  It did take about 2 hrs for my dough to rise to double.  I doubled the icing recipe and had just the perfect amount.  I will absolutely be making these again very soon!!!

Someone must've stolen the Cinnabon recipe, because these are PERFECT. Followed the recipe exactly and they came out soooooo good.  Fantastic the next few days in the microwave (30 seconds on high) as well.  Love them!

I made this recipe for my wife's birthday, It was a hit!  I have to admit the 400 degrees seemed a bit high. I will try the 350 like others suggested.

Super good!  I don't have a bread machine, so I used the kitchen aid and went with normal bread making procedures.  I made them the night before, so i did the second rise in the frige and they turned out fluffy and big.  It made 2 9x13 pans so I took one to work and they didn't last long!

These cinnamon rolls are to die for and very easy to make. For the icing, I substituted Mascarpone in place of the cream cheese for a milder cheese flavor. My family loved them!

These cinnabons really are a clone of the real thing!  I made these for the first time on Christmas morning for my family.  My father thought that I purchased them at Cinnabon(R), warmed them in the oven and passed them off as my own...he could not believe that I made them from scratch!!  I am going to start a tradition and make these  cinnabons every Christmas morning.

I just made these for my family this afternoon, and they are delicious!  I didn't use a bread machine, just did it the old-fashioned way.  I only used a 7 oz. package of yeast.  Also, I didn't have the bread flour because the cashier at Walmart must have not put it in my cart because she was too busy talking to my toddler.  I used all-purpose flour, and they turned out fine.  Probably could have used a tad bit more flour, but I just added a little more when I rolled them out.  I only used about 2 tbsps. of butter on the dough instead of the 1/3 cup.  Just seemed like a lot of butter to me, but I guess that's what makes them really 'gooey'.  Taste just fine to me the way they turned out!  If they dry out too fast, I'll probably use the 1/3 cup butter called for the next time I make this recipe.

Another raving review...These are fantastic!  I did NOT use a bread machine.  I dissolved a T. yeast in the warm milk and added the rest of the ingredients.  This dough is fabulous to work with, supple and not sticky.  After the first rise and rolling/cutting the rolls, I put them in the fridge overnight. I let them sit in a slightly warm oven for over an hour, then baked as directed.  I wish I could eat without worrying about calories, because I would eat a half dozen of these no problem.  The best cinnamon rolls I've ever had.  Hands down.  I don't see the need to even try other recipes.

Yum! I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the advice of others to make these using my Kitchen Aid Mixer. I made them on Christmas Eve up to the point of putting them in the pan and letting rise for a second time. Then I covered them and left the in the fridge overnight. Christmas morning I put them in a cold oven and then baked for 30 minutes at 350. I made my own icing without cream cheese because I don't not care for it. These were a hit!

The only thing I would change next time would be to cut the frosting in half and thin it with milk, then drizzle it over the rolls. It's too thick and there's too much of it for our liking. Really overpowers the rolls.

I waited almost a month before I made these and couldn't wait any longer!  They are delicious!  They didn't rise like I think they should have, but stll tasty.  The second time, I did mix the butter, cinnamon and brown sugar together then spread over the dough.  This seemed to integrate the sugar better.  And they are SO tasty the day after! (if any are left over!)

Fantastic!!!  I made this with gluten free flour.  UGH!  What a mess, and it didn't make it to the 'bun' stage.  But I threw the doughy glop in a pan, and threw it in the oven anyways.  They tasted wonderful!!!!  The consistancy was terrible, but that's not the fault of this recipe.... it's the flour.

These were awesome! Thank you mcatherwood for the non-bread machine method it worked great.  They take a while - I didn't have enough time at the end to let them raise as much as I would have liked, but they were yummy.  Want to be a hero?  Add just a few chocolate chips over the brown sugar before rolling up - results are AMAZING!!

I made mini-bons last night by rolling from the long side and they turned out fantastic and there were about 24 of them! I took the advice to bake them at 350 for 20 minutes without realizing that they should be taken out at least a few minutes earlier because of their size! Despite them not being as soft as the cinnabon rolls, they were still deeeelicious and I am embarrased to say I finished about 7 of the mini rolls in the last 15 hours! The cream cheese topping is to die for and the best part is there is little room for error. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Egg allergy here, but these were fantastic with 1/2 c. vanilla yogurt substituted for the eggs. You'd never know the eggs were left out!  I also used melted butter in the dough instead of margarine because our food needs to be Feingold-safe as well as egg-free.  After removing the dough from the bread machine, I had to let it rise more in a warm oven to get it to double.  My ingredients may not have been close enough to room temp. when I began.  I followed some others' suggestions and made these the night before. They didn't rise at all in the fridge, so I popped them in a barely warm over for about 30 min. then preheated with them still in there and baked at 350 for about 2o min. until done.  They seemed a bit gooey so after I served the first two, I propped up the pan to let the goo run to the side.  I'll probably adjust the cinn./sugar mixture next time I make them.  Can't wait to have more!

so, my sister made this first (see hockeymom089), i tried it the day after....oooohhh, so good, my nephew gave me the dirty eye as i was eating "his" cinnabon. I had to make it myself....easy....take it out of the oven...so excited....eh! I couldn't figure out what i did wrong. I'm glad i didn't rate it right then, because the next day they were every bit as yummy as when i tried my sisters. I even had one guy at work offer to pay me to quit my job and just make these for him full time. 100% better the next day though....YUMMY!

These are fantastic, I will make them again and again. I actually didnt have confectioners sugar, and had to use real sugar instead. If this happens to you, just use 1 cup sugar and dont worry that it is a bit gritty, because once you put it on the buns it melts right in and I didnt notice the icing being gritty anymore.

Another tip! I use dental floss to cut the rolled up dough into buns. Works way better than a knife.

Ok, so I have been dying to try this recipe for a while now, but with my kids schedules, I haven't found 3 hours to do so. Well, Football season was finally over, so i decided to make it for a treat tonight. I timed it so it would be ready after dinner. Well, I timed wrong, and we were in the middle of dinner when it was done. Let me tell you, I have never seen my son eat so fast so he could be the first one to try it. So while we were still eating dinner, he dug into the first one, the boy looked like he was going to melt with deliciousness (if that is even a word) I said, so it looks like you like it, and he just said, oh, this is sooo good. I asked if it was worth the 3 hours and he said ohhhh yeaaaaaa! What I did differant was as some others had done, I cut the butter in with the brown sugar and cinnamin instead of spreading it (the butter) on the dough. I then spread the mixture onto the dough. Also for the icing, I used 5oz instead of 3oz of cream cheese, as I am a cream cheese fanatic, ohhhh was it good! I will definately make sure I have all ingrediants on hand for when I have a spare 3 hours...magnifite!!!

My first review on these was in 2007(original review below). I have been making this recipe since, on Christmas eve (today reason for my re-review). I don't change the dough at all and put in my bread machine. My sugar mixture I add walnuts/pecans. I cut the dough with a string/waxed dental floss to avoid smooshing. I also cut the dough about 3-4 inches and press down slightly in pan to widen out for bigger rolls. I cover and put in fridge over night. When the kids wake us up I preheat the oven and pull out the rolls placing them on top of oven to rise for about 30 minutes or so. After baked I flip them out onto a large cutting board for the drippings to cool on top of rolls. Please keep in mind the middles are still baking. Love this recipe thank you again for sharing.
(Original review 2007) Wow what can I say these were amazing. The only changes I made from the original recipe were reducing my heat to 350 degrees and cooking for 20 minutes. Also instead of spreading my icing I put it in a sandwich bag and cut the corner of the bag making zig zags over the top of the rolls. Just a tip, let the rolls sit for about 10 - 15 minutes before serving. The rolls are still cooking in the center after coming out of the oven. The center will be googy and undone if served right out of the oven. If you are unsure about this recipe, don't be.

Yummy!!  My entire family loved this.  I, also, did not use a bread machine.  For those of you do not know, 8 grams of yeast is equal to 2 tsp.  I haven't baked with yeast in years, so I wasn't sure how these would turn out.  It was so easy.  I cannot wait to make them again.

I knead the dough by hand... but it really turns out great! soft and yum...i even made the chocolate chip version..perfect! a little note on the sweetness though, i like bakeries less sweet, so i would recommend reducing the sugar.. otherwise just perfect like those found in the cafes!

Amazing Recipe. First time I've ever made cinnamon rolls (or any bread requiring yeast) and they turned out perfectly! I just followed the recipe exactly, except I baked at 350 for 25 minutes. My husband didn't know the recipe name was "Clone of a Cinnabon", and he said, "You know what this tastes like? A Cinnabon."

Great recipe.  A lot like Cinnabon - using their variety of cinnamon would make them a dead ringer for the original.  I tried previous suggestions to bake the rolls at 350 for 25-30 min. and they came out perfect.

I used half whole wheat flour. I also made the rolls and put in the frig before baking the night before. I cooked them for 25 minutes at 400.

*Drool* Awesome recipe! I make this frequently, and have noticed that I can interchangeably use hot water instead of milk. And I tend to add white sugar to the cinnamon and brown sugar mix (makes it a bit more gooey). I also recommend using an all purpose flour. Makes it nicer to handle. Enjoy!

These are very good. I've made one batch exactly as written, but I also made a batch with 2 c. of whole wheat flour (the other 2 1/2 white flour), Splenda instead of sugar, and fat-free cream cheese. They were also very delicious. Thanks for an amazing recipe. 
I turned them over after baking to allow the cinnamon to coat the buns as a previous reviewer suggested. I would also recommend doing that. 
Another helpful suggestion would be to use a pizza cutter to cut the dough into your 12 strips. I cut the dough in half, then in half again. Then those four sections I cut into thirds. This made nice, proportional rolls.
I received tons of praise when serving these and everybody wanted and got the recipe and I also referred them to this site because it rocks.

Delicious!  I have made this twice and my second batch was the best one yet.  Do put the entire brown sugar mix onto your dough.  I made the mistake on my first batch of not including the entire brown sugar mix and it didn't have enough gooey middle stuff.  I also turned them upside for 5 minutes after it came out of the oven to help redistribute the leaked out gooey stuff back onto the rolls.

These received rave reviews, even after a couple of days of having been made! I couldn't believe it!! The filling was simple yet one of the best that I've tasted. It oozed with cinnamon perfection and was only to be complimented by that cream cheese frosting. Everything flowed together to create one awesome cinnamon roll!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Wow!  This is an awesome cinnamon bun!  I don't like cinnabons at all, too many ingredients I can't pronounce in there.  This is a perfect recipe and I will make more of this plus try the cream cheese icing.  I used the other user suggestion for powdered sugar since I didn't have cc.  Excellent and thank you for posting this recipe! :)

My husband & I both love these!!  He said better than Cinnabon.  I have to tell you though, I wasn't sure they would turn out.  I purchased a used  bread machine on-line (no booklet) just so I could make these the easy way.  It took me a long time because I had to figure out the machine.  They turned out wonderful!!  My daughter loved them also but doesn't like the icing.  I am sure there are better icings out there but I love the cream cheese icing.

OMG these were perfect! I havent had a cinnabon since high school....so I can compare. But these were easy and fun to make. They turned out beautifully and tasted homemade.  Thanks!!!! Will definitely make again, once I come down from my sugar high.

No icing necessary -- these cinnamon buns are sweet enough without. In fact, they're sublime, superb, superlative, supreme, super-duper, sans-pareille, sinful, and just so good that I can't find any more adjectives. I tried them with apricot and almonds (without success) so stick to the recipe and you'll be happier than you can imagine.
Thank you, Marsha Fernandez!!!

Excellent recipe! Just like Cinnabon.  The cream cheese topping was lacking a little zing - so I added 1/8 tsp of lemon extract - PERFECT - try it!!!!

These were VERY good. My mother said the best she ever ate. I was slightly disappointed by the icing, though. If I make again, will look for variations.

Holy moley!  These are to die for!  This makes my bread machine worth more than it was to me before.  I'm going to burn up the motor making these babies! 

Adjustments:  I did do the lower temperature for longer as suggested in a previous review and no doughy center.  I also wish I had 1 1/2 the icing recipe.

Now if someone could just include directions for refrigerating or freezing the dough, I'd be set.  (But if I have to continue getting up at 4:30 AM to start the machine, so be it!)

Incredible!  I'm not a cook at all and found these very easy to make.  It's a great recipe and it makes others think you are an incredible cook even if you are like me!  I want to try to add pecans on top next time.

I've never had a cinnabon, but this recipe is wonderful. I did add 1 Tbsp. of yeast instead and used unbleached natural white flour. Delightful!!!!

I have to give the recipe as-is only 4 stars because the instructions say 15 min at 400F, but the one I'm eating right now isn't fully cooked. But it's so darn good, I can't stop! Next time, it'll be perfect.

The best ever! Even better (though very similar) to cinnabon! I made some for my friend and her husband who said there was no way a roll could come close to cinnabon. I proved them wrong! :D They loved them....I will never make another type of cinnamon roll again! Thank you!

My husband is a huge cinnabon fan and was very skeptical about this recipe. I made these for him one day and he loved it.  He swears that it's as close to the original as you can get!  Thanks for the recipe.

I found this recipe after moving to England and finding that the only Cinnabon in the country was a hour drive away at an amusement park.(they didn't taste just like the ones at home either) Last weekend, my husband and I took our sons to the park and as a treat on the way home decided to buy them cinnabons. All 3 boys didn't finish theirs and said they liked theses ones better now!

Oh my goodness!!!  Honestly, this is one of the best cinnamon rolls I have tasted in my entire life!  My husband almost fell out of his chair when he took his first bite.  This is definitely up there with my favorite recipes of all time and I look forward to making these again and again.  I followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  The frosting is sooooooo delicious!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These are incredibly delicious and easy.  I made these Christmas morning for my husband and I and for my Pastor's family.  These are fantastic!  The amount of cinnamon was perfect and so was the topping!  Everyone thought they were the best they had ever had!  A definite hand-me-down recipe sure to delight and comfort!  Thank you sooooo much for sharing this with us.

The recipe doubled very well but the dough was very heavy tasting and did not taste as good as other cinnamon bun recipes I have made. This is the first cinnamon bun recipe I have tried with the bread maker so that may have been it but otherwise I suggest using a different recipe.

These are great!!  I've made it twice now, both times with a breadmaker.  However, once I made them exactly as the recipe called and they came out beautifully.  The next time, I made them and let them rise, then covered and placed in the fridge until the morning.  Took them out while letting the oven preheat and baked as usual.  Again, came out beautiful.  Will be making again and again.  They are super easy and use items I usually already have on hand.  One note to consider... both times I made them, they rose so much that I ended up pulling a few out onto another pan, so there would be enough room.

I had to work on Easter, so I took these as a treat for breakfast.  Everyone loved them, and I thought they were fantastic. This was the first time I tried making cinnamon rolls at home, because we have a Cinnabon so close to us.  Now, I think I'll just make my own.  I also made them the night before - I took them out of the fridge in the morning, let them sit for about a half an hour, then baked as directed.  They rose beautifully! Thanks for a great recipe!

These taste exactly like a cinnabon!!!  That is the overall opinion in our house.  They don't look just like them but the taste is dead on. I did this all by hand and followed others reviews instructions. A few things I did that worked really well was the dough rising in a warm oven, and I greased the surface to roll the dough instead of floured, it rolled out beautifully and really helped the cinnamon rolls "seal" and keep from unrolling in the pan. I changed the frosting slightly and it was perfect: 4 oz cream cheese, 5 T. butter, 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar, same amount of vanilla and salt, and 1 T. milk. Also very important, 350 degrees for 30 minutes=perfection!! My family and friends think these are to die for and I totally agree!!!

Hands down - this recipe is equivalent if not better than Cinnabun. I let the dough rise for a longer time (when out of the machine and when prepared in the pan) but other than that, no changes were made to the recipe. Delicious!

I have followed the review as I was not using the bread machine and reduced the yeast. It did not rise enough, it was like eating a toasted dough. so STICK TO THE ORIGINAL RECIPE even if you are not using a bread machine.
I will be trying again.
I recommend mixing butter and cinnamon mixture then spread on the dough, instead of butter first and sprinkling the cinnamon sugar.
Less messy, and it gets rolled inside the dough without losing half of them!

Wowed the family with this one.  I divided the dough into two pieces which made it easier to roll up.   Next time I will bake them on a cookie sheet with an edge to keep the butter and sugar from dripping in the oven.

I have given this recipe to a lot of my friends.  This is so neat!!  I took the recipe and made 24 rolls with a small round cutter and then placed one on top of the other to make a double decker roll placed them in a 9x13 pan let them rise together & baked them at 350 for about 12 minutes.  They went like hot cakes!! I love this recipe

These are seriously to die for!  So good.  The frosting is awesome too!  I did double the frosting and cut back on the cinnamon--used 2 Tbs. instead of 2 1/2 after reading some reviews that said they were too strong with cinnamon.  I don't know if it made a difference.  If you want to impress--try these.  You won't be disappointed!

These are the best!  My whole family loved them!  The directions were perfect.  I made a simple glaze for my children since they don't like cream cheese frosting....confect. sugar mixed w/milk.
Next time, I hope to make mini cinnamon rolls. I plan on rolling out my dough the same, but cut them in strips w/a pizza cutter and then roll them up.  I'll let you know how that works!

Very good. I don't have a bread machine so I used my kitchen aide mixer. I messed up and added the yeast into the dough but it rose pretty well. I put the dough in a warm microwave. Put them in the fridge overnight and baked the next morning. They were great even with my mishap I'm sure they will be even better next time when I follow directions :)

Fantastic! I was surprised how big they were. I had to give my neighbor half of the batch, they were so good me and my kids would have eaten them all at once!

Wonderful!!! I had never made cinnamon rolls before I made these and they turned out perfect! Absolutely delicious! Mine didn't seem to be dry, but I added a lot of icing on top. If you're afraid they'll be to dry after reading other reviews, add half a pack of dry instant vanilla pudding after you put the flour in your bread machine, that should help. These were the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had!!!

Wow!!!  I was doubtful that it could be possible to make anything close to what you can buy and wow!! First, I pulled out my bread maker that I had not used for the past 4 years and when the result of putting in all the ingredients was a beautiful lump of warm dough, I was starting to get more optimistic.  Rolling out the dough was a bit tricky since the dough was so elastic!  After baking it, I was so pleasantly surprised at the end result!  How professional and delicious it all looked.  I shared half a dozen with my neighbors and I got two calls from different family members telling me just how awesome they were, in fact better than the ones that are made at the malls.  My two daughters also wolfed down their cinnamon buns for a snack this afternoon.  Finally, I just sat down after tying up all the loose ends of the day and I am enjoying my first taste.  I am very happy to be enjoying fresh, HOMEMADE cinnamon buns!  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe as it will be made in my kitchen many times over!

I make cinnamon buns every year from Christmas but this is the first time I tried to replicate the Cinnabon.  They were good and very much like the real thing, but they are so very sweet that they werent't all gobbled up the way mine usually are.

First time using a bread machine and only second attempt at making cinnamon rolls.  LOVED THIS RECIPE!  Not quite Cinnabon but really, really close.   Took some time but definitely saves you money.   Will definitely make this recipe again.

These were amazing!  This recipe made about 14 large perfect cinnamon rolls.  I've never made cinnamon rolls before and I found them to be pretty easy to make, they just take awhile because of the dough rising.  The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was that it didn't specify which ingredients were going into the dough, filling, or icing.  So, when it said place all ingredients into bread machine I was like "WHICH ONES!?".  I figured it out and everyone loved them.

Made these tonight, and thought I'd messed up badly (didn't have enough surface to roll the dough very thin), but out of the oven they were delicious! I think next time I'm going to try a slightly different cinnamon filling (something less dry), but these are great as is, if you couldn't tell from all the other five stars. :)

Followed the recipe exactly and these were delicious. My kids were speechless while eating them. Not a sound could be heard but chewing. I would have been creeped out if I weren't so impressed with myself. Thanks, Marsha, great recipe!

All who ate one of these homemade cinnabons said it was the best cinnabon they had ever had. I did use my bread machine and they turned out so perfect. Thank you for sharing this fine recipe.

I saw this and wanted to try it, but was scared because I have NEVER worked with yeast ( and so many rules..... dont make the water but so hot, and make sure you add this or that) I just did not know if I could do it!
But I did and it was GREAT!!!!!! They came out GREAT!!!! I made them for my mother ( who can bake anything from just tasting it) and she was truly impressed with the dough and the frosting!!!My husband is taking some to his class!! These were SUPER!!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!

If it was possible to give 10 stars I would!! These taste identical to Cinnabon - icing and all. My boys and their friends scarfed these up the morning after a sleepover, rave reviews. I did make them the night before and let them sit at room temp for 30 min. before baking. Thank you so much!

"Unbelievable" The dough was so silky and soft, I've never worked with a dough this good, super easy, as other reviews, I mixed all the filling ingredients together, then spread it on the dough. 12 count was perfect for  big round luscious cinn-a-buns. Wish there were more stars for a "Perfect 10 Rating"

The "perfect cinnamon roll";  I have made them three times in a weeks time.  I like to make make them the night before and then bake in the morning.  They are so easy and yummy!  (I use oil to roll them out and not flour.)

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls from sratch...and it will be the only recipe I try.  Why mess with perfection?  I used the bread machine and refrigerated the prepared rolls overnight, then let them rise and bake the next morning.  Thanks for the amazing recipe, this will be used for special guests for a special treat :)

Excelllent! I even forgot the 1/2 cup of white sugar in the dough and it was still an amazing cinnamon roll. Also, the easiest dough to roll out that I have ever worked with. They looked perfect.

This is an excellent cinnamon roll.  I have never had a Cinnabon, and now don't even want to try one.  This is easy, and excellent.  Very, Very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!  This is the first thing  I've ever made with yeast, and  it turned out really, really well.  We don't have a bread machine, so I did it by hand.  My mom said she couldn't have done a better job.

Edit: July 16, 2007--My brother STILL talks about these cinnamon rolls.  I'm currently far away from home in New York City completing an internship, and I really miss baking.  I told my little brother (who is 16) that he'll have lots of treats when I get home.  The first thing he said was, "those cinnamon rolls, please."  They're AWESOME.

These Cinnabons were very tasty.  I couldn't keep my mouth away from them.  I did n't have any cream cheese for the frosting so I used sour cream instead and they still turned out great.  This is going to be a recipe I use a lot.

Fantastic!  The first try came out a little hard and dry (combo of a little too much flour and cooked just a little bit too long) but I've made them twice since then, just making sure to measure flour properly and WATCH them as they cook to be sure I grab them before they become too dark, and they've come out perfect!  I followed a previous reviewers tips on how to make these without a bread machine.  And I also had difficulty proofing the yeast but the recipe still works.  Don't pass this recipe up just because you don't have a machine.  It's a good thing these take a little while to make otherwise I'd be making them all the time!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these for my husband's work. They raved about them! Turned out perfect! I never got to try one for myself, though. They ate everyone of them and the icing that was left in the bottom of the pan! I am making them again this weekend for my family of six. I am sure I will enjoy them just as much as the guys did.

It turned out quite well considering that I didn't use a breadmaker. I have an aversion to using recipes with yeast but this one was easy. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer who put the milk, sugar and yeast together first, and I used 1C of butter for the filling and an extra 1C of brown sugar also. The icing part is SO NOT Cinnabon! Theirs is much lighter in texture. For that, I used about 2/3C heavy cream and 1/2 C soften butter with sugar to taste and whipped it up. Much better. You will have extra filling & icing if you do all this and it will be more than enough for an extra batch or two. Perfect to make when guests are staying for several days.

These were so easy to make.  I have always had a phobia of working with yeast but this was a great first experience.  I do not have a bread machine but no problem.  I also made these up the night before and pulled them out in the morning and everyone loved them.

This recipe is just awesome!!!!  My whole family loved it.  We have 6 in our family and these rolls are so big it takes us 2 days to eat all of them.  You can not go wrong with these rolls.  I make them the night before and put them in the refrigerator overnight to cook in the morning.

"Oh Lord, if I can't be thin, please let all my friends be fat...."  This is the recipe to do it!  Finger lickin', plate lickin' good!  
I'll let them bake a little longer next time as they were slightly doughy in the center.  
Anyhow, they're fabulously yummy.

AWESOME!  These were the best!  My husband has been asking me to make his grandma's cinnimon rolls, and I still hadn't gotten the recipe, but decided to try this instead.  I've now been asked to make these more often!  I did 1 1/2 times the frosting, which was about right.  I took some reviewer's advice and did the dough in my breadmachine the night before, filled and cut them and then left them in the fridge overnight.  I should have let them rise again in the morning, but I just put them straight in the oven and they were still rather large and good.  But next time I'll probably wait 1/2 hour before putting them in the oven in the morning.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

These came out wonderfully though I could easily have used half the dough. The rolls were so big and squished together they had trouble cooking in the very middle of the pan in the alotted time. However, they did disappear quickly! A nice treat for any holiday or special occasion.

Absolutely amazing! It really does taste like a Cinnabon. Followed the recipe as written. My husband (who hates cream cheese) even liked them! Just be careful, either have a lot of people to share with or only make half the recipe - it's hard not to eat them all!

The 4.5 cups of flour made a really stiff dough for me. It didn't rise well at all and as a result, didn't have that wonderfully light, melt-in-your-mouth  cinnabon texture. It did taste good. I will try again and watch the dough more closely. I'll go for something a   bit more loose. I have to watch all my breads like that, so I should know better. I will try again :)

These were great, made them for Christmas morning, I don't quite think they are Cinnabon quality, but they are very very good. I didn't use a bread machine, just my Kitchenaid mixer & it seemed to be fine. I wasn't real crazy about the icing, maybe because I used reduced fat cream cheese. Overall, they were really good.

Incredibly tender and soft! I increased the cinnamon and used less brown sugar for the filling than called for and they were still awesome. I have made these several times and have also used a lighter icing for them made from milk and powdered sugar and almond extract...not as fattening as the cream cheese version.

I make this recipe every year for my co-workers, typically 4-6 dozen.  Everyone raves about them.  One thing I do differently than the recipe calls for is I buy square aluminum cake pans rather than using a 9" x 13" pan, and stagger 6 rolls in the pan.  I find when I use a 9" x 13", the center rolls never get completely done, and while I like the gooey doughy center rolls typically, in a 9" x 13", it's just too much.  It's too bad I can't find 9" x 6.5" pans to bake them in.  That would be perfect!

Well we don't have a Cinnabon where I live, but years ago we had a Cindy's Cinnamon Rolls and I remember how fabulous they were. I knew this would be a labor of love, but the bread machine did most of the work. They were FAT and GORGEOUS!! I doubled the icing so it could run down the sides. It's a keeper!

It's not like this recipe needs yet another 5 star rating, but I just couldn't resist!  These are absolutely decadent!  We had a problem with the second rise....they didn't rise much at all and we were afraid that they wouldn't turn out.  But, we baked them anyway, and they were excellent.  Thank you for this recipe!

These had a delicious flavor - the brown sugar and cinnamon combination is fantastic, as is the icing, but I had a problem with the cooking time. The rolls were golden on the outside, but the inside of some of the rolls was uncooked and very doughy. Next time I'll make more rolls at a slightly smaller size or else cover them with foil towards the end of the baking time and bake a bit longer. I can see how these would be addictive!

These cinnamon rolls turned out beautifully! I made them without any icing, since I didn't have cream cheese available - good thing that my husband didn't really want icing anyway! The rolls turned out golden brown, light and puffy, perfect amount of moisture, and excellent flavour. I cut the recipe in half - all ingredients halfed as written - to make 6 large spiral rolls. My bread machine was set on the 'sweet dough' cycle for kneading. So simple to make and easy cleanup - doesn't create a mess in the kitchen. I plan to use this recipe again and again - next time, I'd like to try them with the icing.

Very, very good! I replaced a cup of white four with whole wheat and they turned out perfectly. The frosting is delicious. Better than Cinnabon!

On my second try I let them rise for over an hour and they turned out better than a real Cinnabon.  And since discovering my local Cinnabon has just shut down I am VERY happy I found this recipe, thank you Marsha!

I bake a lot but I stick to easy things.  I've always avoided any recipe that called for yeast.  I tried this recipe on Friday and I still can't believe how great they turned out.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Ok, I'm a fan.  My husband said that these were better than cinnabon, maybe because he got one right out of the oven.  Next time I will bake at 350 degrees, they got a little too brown at 400.  I also used butter instead of margarine, worked fine.  What I want to know is if I can freeze them raw, and bake as we use them?  Next time I will divide the dough and make 24 instead of 12, they are just too big.  Great recipe though.

Aww, man! These are incredible. I used raw, farm-fresh milk and all-purpose flour, but otherwise faithfully followed directions. These take awhile, but the payoff is scrumptious.

Absolutely excellent. I made half the recipe the night before as suggested by someone else, and let them rise in the fridge, the next morning, I brought them to room temp for about 1.5 hours and then baked at 350 for about 20 mins then covered with foil for another 5 mins. Waited 10 mins then covered with icing. Soooo goood.

Fabulous recipe.  This dough is also great for a sweeter dinner roll (similar to what is served at Texas Roadhouse restaurants).  Just shape dough into 12 balls (sans cinnamon & sugar) and let rise in 9x13 pan and bake according to the final step in this recipe.

WONDERFUL!! My family loves it, I add raisens to the middle and have doubled the frosting. I bake it the first 10 min with tin foil to prevent browning on top, then take it off for the remaining time, I've also needed to bake it a little longer. Taste's just like the cinnabon!

This recipe is INCREDIBLE.  Seriously, I can't think of anything better for breakfast than one of these fresh out of the oven.  Yum.  All my family and friends loved them and thought they were BETTER than Cinnabon.  I only made one change; I thought 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting sounded like way too much, so I started with 1/2 cup, thinking I'd taste it and add more accordingly--surprise surprise, it was PERFECT with just 1/2 cup... I think with the full amount it would be waaay too sugary-sweet.

These were AMAZING! I took them to work and they were gone within minutes. Don't rush them - really let them rise so that they get really really big. Thank you for the great recipe! Wouldn't change a thing.

I knew when the dough was the silkiest i have ever seen that this would be a winner... better than cinnabon!!!

i changed the topping by first icing as instructed then spooning caramel over each bun and sprinkling a generous amount of chopped pecans before swirling a brown sugar based icing over it all... rich, gooey and sinfully divine!

WOWZERS! I did however cut the sugar a bit. In the dough I used only 1/4 cup. The filling I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar NOT packed. I didn't add salt to the icing because I used salted butter. Also I only used 2/3 cup of icing sugar (we don't like things too too sweet). They were sooo good and were finished baking in 15 minutes.

These are, without a doubt, THE BEST homemade cinnamon rolls! I have made them several times now and they disappear as fast as I make them. Very easy to make and with just the basics that I always have on hand. The only thing I do different is to melt a container's worth of vanilla frosting (such as Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker) and then pour it over the top of the cinnamon rolls while they're still hot from the oven. Mmmmmmm.....so good!!! Also, I occasionally add raisins to them (I usually sprinkle them over the top of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture before rolling the dough).

YUM!  These were absolutely delicious.  I don't have a bread machine or a stand mixer, so I kneaded this by hand and it was just fine.  I only let the dough rise for 1/2 hour, and then another 1/2 hour after I placed the rolls in the baking pan, and they turned out great.  I had plenty of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture left over so I would make 1/2 or 3/4 as much next time.  They are amazing right out of the oven & still very good after reheating.

This was a great recipe!! It may take a while to make, but it was well worth it! The only thing that I would do different is this: After you roll the dough up with the butter and cinnimon mixture, brush some extra melted butter on the outside of the roll. When I baked these, the outside of the rolls were a bit dry, so I will do this the next time. Other than that, they were very yummy!

This is an excellent recipe. Very close to Cinnabon. My bread machine handled it excellently. My adjustment was I need to let it rise for 60mins(instead of 30mins), til the rolls "kissed"(touched each other). I also added rasins. I spread them on the dough before rolling the dough up. This recipe is going to become a regular in our household.

There's no way these could be more delicious. I wrapped these in celophane and tied them in a pretty bow and gave them as a birthday gift to a big cinnamon fan. He was so excited I had to beat him off me with a stick. He's been begging for more since then.

SO GOOD!!, close to  being a  "Clone of a Cinnabon". I like to add vanilla ex to the dough, and I use the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe to top these.  I make this completely by hand and is always worth the effort. I make the dough and roll them, then allow them to sit in the fridge over night. This eliminate any yeasty taste. The morning of, I let them sit for about 30 mins, then bake them at 350 util golden. This is a fantastic Thanksgiving or Christmas breakfast.. In fact, both my kids and husband always want this as their birthday breakfast..

This recipe is awesome! I have made these decadent treats several times now. I've given them to our doctors office in appreciation for the medical marvels they have performed. This has earned me the title "Cinnabon Boy", & at 42 that helps my ego. Simple well written instructions. Virtualy fail safe. Big thumbs up.D.K.C. SAC. CA

I would probably give this 3.5 stars if possible.  It is a nice basic cinnamon roll recipe, not really like a cinnabon in my opinion.  The finished product is a little dry. If you can't eat them all right from the oven they dry out pretty quick.  I might make this recipe again, but next time I want to make cinnamon rolls I will try a different recipe to try to find the perfect one.

Fantastic recipe. Make sure your flour and your yeast is fresh. My flour was a little old and it took a long time for them to rise in the pan. Other than that everyone loved them and I gave out the recipe to quite a few people.

The cream cheese in the icing is a nice touch, but the filling is very rich and sweet.  Next time I would use only half the butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon in the filling.

Awesome.  Good thing these are time consuming or they'd be made a lot more!  It helps to spray the dough and counter with cooking spray when rolling it out.  This eliminates the flour mess.

These are heavenly.  I try to make myself feel better by using light cream cheese.  Wonderful treat at brunches without breaking the bank for the real Cinnabons.  These are best eaten fresh otherwise they do get hard but a quick nuke in the microwave freshens them up.

I am giving this recipe ***** just for the icing. I have found better recipies for the dough but this icing recipe is simply the best. I always make double because everyone likes it so much. Ok so it's really just me eating half of it before the rolls are done but everyone else does agree that it's very yummy!!

These are sooooo good! I don't even dare look at the calorie and fat contenet. I might try to make them with some lower fat ingredients such as fat free cream cheese and egg substitute. Also I think you could get away with less than 1 cup of brown sugar. I will definitely make these again.

This was fantastic.  Fast and easy - the dough came out just beautifully.  I goofed and mixed the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter together instead of buttering the dough and then sprinkling the sugar.  I also added raisins and chopped pecans at my hubby's request.  I baked them at 375 as others suggested.  These were fantastic and utterly delicious.  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

The bread was very tough and doughy as they didn't rise well. I have been making cinnamon buns for years and wanted to try a bread that was a bit diferent. I will stick to my original recipe for the bread (basic white) which has a light and fluffy texture. I will use the icing recipe as it does taste like the one that Cinnabon uses.

As many people have previously stated, this recipe is awesome!  I have been wanting to try to make my own cinnamon rolls for some time and have been searching for the perfect recipe.  All the  other ones I have found have been too intimidating and looked too time consuming.  This recipe couldn't have been easier!  I took the advise of others and made my rolls the night before, put them in the refrigerator and baked them the next morning. I also baked them at a lower temp. They were so good I couldn't beleive I made them! I will never buy cinnamon rolls from the store again. I am so happy to finally have a cinnamon roll recipe I can make over and over again! Thanks for sharing!

as everyone else has said, these are fabulous!  i did decrease the temperature to 375 as suggested.  make sure when you roll the dough to roll them tight so they don't come apart when cooking.

These are excellent! I set the temperature between 375 and 400 and they were plenty browned and baked through (not doughy) in 15 minutes.  The bread machine does the hard part of making the dough -- I never though cinnamon rolls could be easy to make, until I tried this recipe. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

At this temp., my rolls rose high and became dark brown on top....which is why I gave them only 4 stars.  Am going to try them again at 300-325º, becuz the filling and icing were awesome, so I'm hoping I can get the right oven temp to make them golden brown and not so dark.  Any ideas why?  Appreciate any help or thoughts.  thanks

For years I have disliked cinnamon rolls, My family enjoys them though, and can't go near a Cinnabon without begging for them. I decided to surprise them with these, and it was fabulous. I even ate one. I served these on Christmas morning. Now my mother=in-law is jealous. She used to make the cinnamon rolls every year, which were from her white bread recipe with cinnamon added. From now on, I am the roll girl. Oh darn. I think I will go stir up a batch now!  : )

very easy to put together, the bread machine did most of the work.  I was out of cream cheese and substituted by using 1/2 cup butter and the frosting was great.  This recipe yeilded 15 very large cinnamon rolls-and all 9 people in my family LOVED them.

Yummy!! I wasn't sure which way to roll the dough up, longways or the short side, so I rolled the long side.  Anyway it came out great.  The cinnamon and brown sugar carmelized and the rolls rose quite nicely even after shortcutting on time a bit.  The best cinnamon rolls I've ever made.

MMMMMMM....These are fantastic. I'm trying to eat one with one hand and type with the other. Very seldom do I come across a recipe that tops my own (five generations, that I know of) of great cooks here), but this one has definitely done it. Thanks so much for sharing, Marsha.

My search has ended.  After searching the past ten years for a cinnamon roll that rivals Cinnabon - this is it! Wicked good!  Super easy as I made them in my bread machine on the dough mode.  I also threw in some cinnamon chips - I will definately be making these again!

You wern't kiddin on this one -  YUMMY.  I mixed the dough on Thursday night and cooked the rolls Sunday Morning.  I cooked them at 350 for 20 minutes they were a little underdone.  Great even the next morning!

After making these for the first time, I have made them several times since and I no one ever gets tired of them.  They are absolutely delicious and taste exactly like the original Cinnabon.  They are wonderful!  I have now included this recipe in our "family" cookbook.  Thank you so much for a fabulous treat!

Definitely the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made.  I thought they were really easy for cinnamon rolls.  The house smelled incredible!

I think these would have turned out great with a different baking time and temperature.  I did go with the recommendations mentioned, and baked them at 375, but they were still pretty dry and almost burned on top.  Next time I'll try even lower and for a shorter time.  The icing turned out  perfectly.  For all those critics of the cream cheese icing, this is a CLONE of a CINNABON!!  The real thing has cream cheese icing, so if you want to make a CLONE, it has to be the same!!!

I have a family of chocolate lovers but since I made these they are now cinnamon roll lovers. These taste better than Cinnabon's. I am constantly being asked to make them.

I didn't think these were all that great.  Too much cinnamon left a yucky taste.  Also, dough was tough when baked.  The Better Homes and Garden's "Goof-Proof Cinnamon Rolls" I have been making for over 10 years are much better.  They are lighter and have a better porportion of cinnamon to brown sugar.  Also, didn't care for the cream cheese in the frosting.  Maybe that's how cinnabon makes them but it's not that great.  My recipe is fabulous and much better: 16 oz. powdered sugar, 1/3 cup melted butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 cup evaporated milk.  This is a super creamy frosting.  Try it and you'll see it's much better.

WOW!  I just made these last night (and finished them off this morning for breakfast :)  )  and I have to say, these DO taste like Cinnabons!  I hardly ever make cinnamon rolls, but now I'm gonna make them all the time!  After all the reviews I read, I was so confident they'd taste good, that I even invited friends over to eat them.  Everyone was unanimous about it....Thanks Marsha!

This is o.k. A little dry and disappointing. We enjoy the "Ooey-Gooey Cinnamon Buns" much better. My family agrees that they have better flavor than these. The icing is good, though.

these were great! it was my first time making cinnamon rolls, and my first time using a bread maker, too... but they turned out lovely! for the icing, I used a 250g (8 oz?) package of cream cheese with the same amount of other ingredients, and it was nice! thank you!

I like this recipe. I have never made a cinnamon roll in my life and feel that I did pretty well. Next time though I will roll the dough a little thinner. Some of the rolls that were sliced near the middle ended up being too thick and had a little doughy taste, but that is only because of my technique not the recipe. I didnt use a bread machine. Can anyone describe the best way to make this not using the bread machine? also make more icing than the recipe calls for.

The bread machine did all the work, which was nice, but my rolls turn out a little dense.  My husband says he likes them that way, and that Cinnabons are like that too, but I think I like my bread a little airier.  These rolls taste great though, sooo good!

Wow!  Where do I begin?!  These cinnabon rolls are just melt-in-your-mouth fabulous!!  I made these for friends at work and I got raves!  I stopped at a cinnabon store a few days after my daughter and I made them for the first time and bought a cinnabon roll...  it didn't taste half as good as these rolls!  You gotta give 'em a try!

These are delicious! I did not have any cream cheese so I made a simple glaze (1 cup icing sugar, 2 tbsp milk, 1 tsp vanilla). I can hardly wait to try them with the cream cheese icing. Even my husband, who insists he doesn't like sweets, ate one. He then suggested I should make them more often! They were gone in less than 24 hours. Thank you Marsh!

Wow! They were excellent. They do take a while because of the time spent waiting for the bread machine and the time spent for the dough to rise. But they were definately worth it. If you can believe it, I think they may be better than Cinnabons!

I thought this was a great recipe that was realitively simple.  The first time I tried it, I was in such a hurry that I forgot the eggs!  But, fortunately, this is a very forgiving recipe!  I added the eggs really late, after the first rising, and I was able to salvage the dough.  I reccommend that everyone should try it!

Yes....indeed these are a delectable treat. Raves from friends and co-workers alike. BUT, watch out. Like some other reviewers, I too found that 15 minutes at 400 F was not going to cut it. I ended up turing the oven down to 350 F and letting them go another 10 minutes. But I suppose it all depends on how thick you cut them and also how evenly your oven distributes heat. Overall, very good and worth a try.

These little rolls made me proud of myself, every one loved them. I made them the night before  because they do take a long time.(But you can be doing other things during the wait.( they mixed  in my machine 1:30, rose 30, and then rose again 30.) But, oh my, very good.

We had a party and I made this recipe for a friend that is the worlds biggest Cinnabon fan, and she was absolutely convinced that I had purchased them! The only thing that I did differently, was to add a little Almond extract to the frosting glaze. She noticed this right away and then believed that I had made them. I made 3 dozen of these and they were gone within 30 minutes!

My husband loves Cinnabons. I tried this recipe and now he won't eat any "cinnabons" but these. Everyone I've made these for can't believe how good and easy they are. I make these at least once a week for my family and friends.

I never baked with yeast before, except in my breadmaker. This was super easy the breadmaker made the dough and I did the rest. The buns taste just like the ones you buy at the mall for so much less$$$  I loved them!!

Excellent! You really have gotta make these.  Couldn't be easier.  You could even add nut/raisins in the brown sugar filling.  The icing is the best.  I've never had a real "cinnabon" but I can't see how it could even compare!! Very easy, my kids helped rolling, cutting and eating.

These were very good.  I shared them with my co-workers and they thought they were quite delicious.  The icing has a "cheesecake" flavor due to the cream cheese in it.  Yummy!

These are so yummy!!!  Even my picky eater loved them.  Made them two weekends in a row. We found the recipe makes plenty of icing and making them smaller(therefore having more of them)allows them to rise better. Is now our only cinnamon roll!

These were incredible, melt-in-your-mouth delicious! By husband devoured them.  He said they blew away the ones at the mall.  They were also good the next day - I heated them in the microwave for approx. 15 seconds apiece.
I thought there was plenty of frosting.  I did add a bit of milk to the frosting to make it a little thinner.  This recipe will become a family favorite.

WHAT A TREAT!  These were super easy to make and my family and friends loved them!  I used a little apple pie spice along with the cinnamon and they were absolutely delicious.  There was PLENTY of frosting with this recipe, so I wouldn't double it.  AND, I'd cut back to about 3/4 cup brown sugar since there was plenty for the filling.  I'm going to make them again today!

"The best cinnamon rolls  I have ever eaten!"  A quote from everyone(around 15 people) who has eaten these rolls I made.  Dough is easy to work with but is still time consuming.  Made several batches at one time and then froze them for later use.  This worked really well!

My sister told me about these last year..I just made them this year & might I say "NUMMIE". These will be made probably too often. Easy to make, the only thing I will change is the size, I will make them smaller, & get 18 out of this recipe.

This is a great recipe! The only thing I would change is the amount of brown sugar. When I make it, I reduce the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. 1 cup was a little too much!

This was a very delicious, easy to follow recipe.  I read all the reviews and said to myself "yeah right, they can't be that good." But boy was I wrong, They were the best homemade cnnamon rolls I have ever had, and I couldn't believe I made them. My husband and kids loved them, even my 18 month old couldn't get enough.  One of the greastest things about them, was I didn't have to go shopping for special ingrediants, it was all stuff I keep on hand everday.....These could be dangerous to dieters, so beware...very YUMMY!

We followed directions, but bread was waayyyyy underdone at only 15 minutes.  I would put foil on it to prevent overbrowning and leave it in for at least 20, up to 30 minutes.

NON BREAD MAKER METHOD:
We don’t have a bread machine so I just made it the way I would with any other bread recipe. 

I put the sugar, milk and yeast into a 4 cup measuring cup to dissolve and put 3 1/2 cups of flour and the salt in the mixing bowl. I mixed together the melted butter and the eggs in a small dish and when the yeast liquid was ready to add to the premixed salt and flour mixture, I also added the egg and butter mixture into he bowl. I added 1/2 cup of flour at a time once everything was mixed well until I had a nice soft dough.

Note** I used regular all purpose flour rather than bread flour

Well it was a clean sweep across the judges... Exactly like a cinnabon!!! Great Recipe was loved by all

Just to add to me previous rating... because i had no idea what i was doing, i had used regular flour and let them rise.  For longer than an hour the first time and about an hour the second time. Before popping them in the oven. They came out perfect still, very soft (I was impressed as it was my first time hand kneading bread dough).

This is the BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever made. Definitely  a keeper :) The  only thing I did different was instead of leaving them raise till double i rolled them out an put the butter and brown sugar and cinnamon on and then cut into rolls but I placed into freezer on cookie sheet to freeze then place into freezer bags and will use as needed. Will take them out an put into pan ad let it rise till double an bake.  :)

Made this the night before using instant yeast...Combined dry ingredients (including yeast packet). Mixed melted butter with milk, and heated until 110 degrees, and then mixed into dry ingredients.
Used my kitchen aid mixer dough hook to knead 10 minutes. Did Step 3, and then covered tightly with plastic and put into the fridge.
Next morning took out of the fridge for about 1/2 hour and then followed Step 4.
They rose like crazy in the oven!
FANTASTIC!!!!!

The recipe for the roll is very good as is (even though the instructions are not great). But the frosting recipe wasn't very good and I had to get another one elsewhere. I used a bread maker on the dough cycle, adding ingredients in this order: butter, milk, eggs, sugar, salt, flour, then yeast. After the dough cycle finished, I set up the bread maker on the manual cycle set to "rise." After it finished the rise cycle, I floured a counter lightly, put the dough on it, and rolled it into a rectangle. I spread the butter on with a spatula (leaving clean 1/2" on each long end), sprinkled on the brown sugar and cinnamon (combined first), and then sprinkled on 1/2 cup of raisins. I rolled it up tight, wetting the 1/2" on the long side with water so that it would stick to the roll. I cut them in 1" slices. Then I let them rise for a second time.

So good!  Rave reviews from my whole family.  I made it almost exactly as the recipe -- but I have a milk allergic child.   I replaced butter with dairy-free margarine.  I replaced the milk with 1/2 cup of warm water to dissolve the yeast, and used extra margarine to make up some of the richness.  I would have used a milk substitute, but all I had was vanilla flavored almond milk and I didn't want to add the vanilla taste to it.   I also could not add the cream cheese to the frosting - so not quite as cinnabon like  for us, but still yummy!

The instructions aren't very clear. So stop at the flour for the bread maker. The next three ingredients, the 1/3 cup of butter, Brown sugar and Cinnamon all happen to be for inside the roll and the last ingredients is for the icing.  FYI

Ohhhhh these were SO good!!! I made them as our Christmas morning breakfast, and have decided it will be our tradition, and can only hope I can wait that long to make and eat them again!  

I was happy to discover that a) you can make and freeze them, and simply defrost in the microwave till warm and gooey (this I did for my experimental batch!) and b) you can make them ahead up to the point of proofing after rolling and cutting:   placing in the fridge overnight, then proof next morning for 30 mins in an oven preheated to 200 degrees but then turned off, then bake as per instructions (this I did for the Christmas batch). 

So, so good!!!

Made but without using a bread machine. I followed someone else's suggestions results were amazing! I doubled the frosting so we would have extra. These cinnamon rolls have literally started fights in my family for who gets to take home the leftovers.  This is my go to breakfast treat for Mother's Day, Easter, etc.

Followed ANDYTAMI's instructions as I don't have a bread machine.  Was concerned that the buns weren't big enough as when they were originally placed in my 9x13 pan there was a significant amount of space between the rolls.  Once they rose a bit, and after baking, saw that they were perfect.

I stirred the cinnamon and brown sugar into the margarine for the filling and spread that on before rolling into the "log" 
Turned out really, really good.

I absolutely love this recipe as is, but for a change of pace I turned these into Mexican chocolate rolls by adding 1 T of Cocoa powder into the filling. For the frosting I added 1T of Cocoa 1 t of cinnamon and 1/4 t of chipotles powder. These turned out amazing. If your looking for just a bit of change try this they are awesome.

With over 2K reviews, I'm not sure anyone will ever read this!  I decided I wanted to make these and got started, only to find that I only had AP flour, active dry yeast, not enough milk.  You get the picture...substituted like crazy.  Had about 1/2 a cup of milk left and used fat-free half & half for the rest of the milk, used all-purpose flour, and used regular active dry yeast.  Still came out absolutely delicious!  My husband is on his second as I type this.  Can't wait to try it with the ingredients, as written.  So good!

I'm new at making cinnamon rolls so when the directions say "Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in order recommended by the manufacturer"? What? I don't have a recommended order from the manufacturer! So I placed the ingredients in there.All of them! Why aren't the dough and frosting list of ingredients separated?

instructions are confusing.. On my computer in  the recipe the brown sugar is in the same column as the dough ingredients.  When does the dough recipe end and the filling recipe begin and when does the frosting begin? Why not simply label ? Dough recipe, Filling recipe, Frosting recipe? I read through reviews for doing this with out bread machine and ended up adding the brown sugar to the dough recipe.

We had these for Christmas breakfast and they were very good!!  I don't have a bread machine, but I used the dough hook on my stand mixer and it worked great!  I used ideas from others - put in warm oven to rise for an hour, mix softened butter, brown sugar and cinnamon all together & press mixture via rolling pin into dough, invert onto parchment paper immediately after baking, put 1/2 frosting on right away (melty goodness in all the layers), then put rest of frosting on after a few minutes.  YUMMY!!

These cinnamon buns were amazing and tasted very similar to Cinnabon. I do not have a bread machine or a KA so I warmed the milk and then dissolved the yeast in the milk, and then proceeded to add all of the rest of the ingredients. Also when it came time to add the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture, I added about 3/4 of the mixture to the dough, then I went over the dough with the rolling pin, before adding the remaining 1/4 mixture. I think this helped keep all of brown cinnamon from leaking out.

These were phenomenal!!   I followed the recipe to a tee, with the exception of making them without the bread maker.   I did however, follow some other viewers suggestions and rolled the sugar and cinnamon into the butter (about 3 sweeps of the rolling pin) then made sure the roll was snug.   After letting them rest/raise for 30 minutes, I put them in a preheated, 350 degree oven, for exactly 20 minutes (not the 400 for 15 that was in the recipe) and then immediately turned them over onto a new pan and placed half the frosting on them.  They were perfect!  No issues of the butter/sugar running out into the baking pan and very little was even on the wax paper that lined it - not even enough to scrape off.  They tasted exactly like Cinnabon and my husband ate 2 of them as soon as I could slop frosting on them!  I did remove them at exactly 20 minutes - even though they looked questionably gooey.  They were not raw, and any longer would have caused them to lose some of the ooey-gooey that makes them desirable.  If you like dry cinnamon rolls - these are NOT for you!!  I will be making these again to share with neighbors and family, with no changes to the recipe or process.  Amazing!!

So yummy. I reduced the amount of icing sugar a little. Cinnabon in my UK town shut down years ago. Now I have these. All I need now is to make the cherry sauce they used to serve.

This recipe is incredibly easy and delicious.  I have made cinnamon rolls many times before and it was a full mornings work.  I can do other things now while the bread maker does the work.  I added 3/4 cup of very finely chopped walnuts to the cinnamon sugar.  It gave the filling more body.

This is a seriously dangerous recipe so easy to make with a bread maker but so many calories!  This cinnamon bun tastes great even cold, the next day.  I will only make this on very special occasions.

This is absolutely delicious. I made this for my co-workers to test before making them for my family's Christmas Day party. Everyone loved it. I make 2 batches for my family, one with pecans and one without. We had to hide some because my family kept coming back for more!! I agree with another reviewer, only use half the icing while they are still hot and the other half once they've cooled down some. If you allow them to sit overnight after you have cut them before baking they will get bigger so if you do that I would suggest cutting them smaller. I did that and it allowed me to have almost double the rolls for one batch. If you add nuts like I tried, I would suggest adding them when you put the cinnamon mixture, that way you can roll the nuts inside as well or maybe mixing it into the icing. Just a suggestion though.. Overall really great recipe. Thanks for sharing!! It is now apart of my stash. LOl

These take a little while to make but if you have the time they are very worth it. My family loves these. My wife bought some from the store and my oldest boy (3 year old) told her that he wanted daddy's cinnamon buns.

This is perfect! I only used half of the frosting. Next time, I will experiment with using only 3/4 of the recipe for the brown sugar/cinnamon mix. Thank you!

Not often I throw up 5 stars for a recipe, but this was hands down an extremely successful one! The key, I believe, was definitely using bread flour. The rolls themselves were moist and light. I did double the frosting as my youngest loves it. I prepared them the night before and as others suggested covered them in plastic wrap and baked the following morning. Be sure to flip them out of the pan, great tip! My family wants me to now open a cinnamon roll stand.

We make this recipe twice a year, Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's our favorite recipe, and can be adapted for use without a bread machine (but the machine makes it easier!)

This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls from scratch and they turned out awesome! I put parchment on the bottom of the pan and flipped the whole pan out after baking to let the filling drip back inside. Perfection. I was told they were even better than Cinnabon -- just as tasty but less greasy!

This was a great recipe!  The only trouble I ran into was the full fat milk I tried to mix active dry yeast into stifled the activation of the yeast a bit.  Putting it back in the pan for a few minutes to heat it solved that issue though!

Just made this today; super like but I made changes hence the four stars. For the spread: used 1/4 c melted butter,  1/2 c packed brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 c  chopped walnuts and rolled out the dough thinner that I made 16 pieces (I cut into 1-inch rolls)! For the icing: used 3/4 cup white sugar and thinned it with 1/3 c 2% milk because I found the original recipe very, very thick. I am having this right now with coffee. So good!

It was just alright. I'm disappointed considering the huge number of high ratings. I made them exactly as stated, even watching the video to ensure I rolled and cut them properly. As others have experienced the filling ran out of mine. I followed suggestions of flipping the pan over to redress them in the drippings but they still lacked real flavor without the filling in the middle like it should be. The frosting also didn't taste quite as expected. 

It's an OK cinnamon bun but it's definitely not Cinnabon.

I've made this multiple times and they are good when they come out of the oven. But the next day, they get incredibly hard. Am I doing something wrong??? They rise and bake just fine. I've winced used the Amish bread recipe as the dough base and just add the cinnamon sugar butter to it instead. Light and incredibly fluffy

These were fabulous. Five stars for the recipe, and I'll make them again. Easy and delicious. My family loved them on Christmas morning.

Note: I followed instructions exactly and used breadmaker; however, I think the breadmaker didn't do well mixing the ingredients. I ended up taking the dough out and kneading it myself; thus, the dough was a bit tough. Next time, I will use the dough hook on my mixer; I think it will produce better results.

Loved this recipe. I made this Christmas eve for Christmas morning breakfast. I reheated them in the oven...they were very dry. Made them again last night cooked them a little less and they are incredible. My husband and daughter love them. I got 20 decent sized rolls so i did need to make a little more icing, which is also really good!

I like to read the most helpful reviews and try to combine the suggestions. I pretty much followed mcatherwood's and it came out wonderfully. We don't have a bread machine. I dissolved a 1/4 oz. packet of Fleischmann's Active Dry yeast in 1/4 c. warm water. The dough came out really sticky, (I might just dissolve it in the milk as others suggested next time) but we kept dusting with flour to keep off our hands and knead into a ball. I followed mcatherwood's suggestion about placing the ball in the warmed oven. I followed Jamie's suggestion to mix the cinnamon/sugar with the butter then spread. I combined mcatherwood and Jamie's suggestion by using a glass 9x13 pan lined with greased (with shortening) wax paper. I baked for 22 min. at 350 degrees ('til the top browned). I took it out and flipped it as JENNIFER WOODARD suggested. When I took my first bite, I was a little worried that the middle didn't cook all the way 'cuz it was gooey, but it was gooey in a fantastic way. And as it cooled, it dried out a bit. Oh and when they say 3 oz. package of cream cheese, I used a regular 8 oz. package.

Hands down its a clone worth trying. We have no official Cinnabon near us so this is a well used recipe in our home.  I make it as directed.

They are OK.  The icing is nothing like Cinnabon, it's too thin.  The rolls are dryer too.  Still looking.....

These are mighty fine!  Make sure to pack the rolls pretty close together, so when they raise they do it "into" each other.  This gives you nice golden tops without too much drying.  In addition, I think these are best cooked right after preparation.  You can certainly put them in the fridge and cook the next day, but they will take a good deal of time to rise and if you put them on something warm to speed it up, some of the butter will melt and fall to the bottom and can saturate the rolls as they cook.

These really did taste JUST LIKE A CINNABON.  I followed ANDYTAMI's directions in his/her review that included how to make the recipe without the bread machine.  Not only do I not have one, but I also prefer to knead and rise by hand anyway.  You get more "love" in that way.  That was the only way that I veered from the original recipe.  These were truly awesome and I don't need to go to the mall and spend a crazy amount of money on them anymore.  Great job!

I don't usually write reviews but I just had to say that this recipe exceeded my expectations.  I love Cinnabons and now I can have them anytime I want.  I doubled the cinnamon and sugar in the middle for my second batch and they were much better.  So easy and yummy.

Made this recipe for the first time today and it's really good. It was a little too cinnamon-y for my tastes, next time I'll cut the cinnamon down from 2.5 tablespoons to 2 tablespoons, that ought to be just about perfect. Even without a bread machine, just working the dough by hand the texture wonderful. If you have trouble with the filling running out I think that's probably caused by under-proofing the dough. After you roll out and cut into the individual pieces let the dough go through a second rise in the baking dish before you bake. That ought to squeeze the rolls together enough to keep the filling in place.

These were amazing! I mixed the butter with the cinnamon and brown sugar filling and spread on like other reviewers suggested. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Baked for 20 minutes at 350. Will definitely make this again.

I made these this morning, for Father's Day breakfast for my husband. What a disappointment for him to wake up to these. They were hard as bricks. The dough seemed fine and then I put them in the oven and they never got "bready". They were dense, and hard, and just stayed a hard dough. I am upset, to say the least, that I put so much time and thought into this special morning for my husband, and this is the breakfast that I had for him. =( I don't know why it didn't work, there are over 5,000 good reviews for them. But I will not be making these again.

Made this in my bread machine and it was super easy.  I followed some reviews and wish I had followed others.  Suggestions I followed: 1) Spread the softened butter on the rolled out dough, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar (I then smeared it all together with a spatula so it looked like a brown sugary paste).  2) Bake at 350 on a lower rack in the oven for 25 minutes.  3) Add a touch of lemon to the frosting - wish I hadn't followed this one.  The cream cheese made the frosting tangy enough. 4) Invert the rolls after baking and then use a spatula to respread the gooiness in the bottom of the pan. Wished I had added a touch of vanilla to the frosting.  Revisions I WISHED I had followed (read them as I was baking the rolls).  1) Make sure the rolls are rolled TIGHTLY.  Pinch the dough together. 2) Leave a small space in between each roll to allow them to rise fully.  I actually made 16 rolls and they were all touching before the rise.  3) Bake in large muffin tins so the rolls are more round instead of square.... this was the first time I've ever made homemade cinnamon rolls and I've never had a "cinnabon".  They were tasty, but not as moist and gooey as I would have liked.  I'm sure this will improve with more experience in using this recipe and tweaking to my personal preferences and I will DEFINITELY be repeating this recipe :)

All I gotta say is wow!  Only stupid thing I did was baked them for 20 minutes instead of 15.  They were so big I thought it needed longer.  Nope...stick to the 15 minutes.  They weren't badly burned but I like mine light brown.  I think I might add a little cinnamon to the dough mixture though next time.  I know its on the inside but I think it would be better if incorporated throughout the dough.  I didn't have cream cheese for the frosting.  I melted 1 tb of butter and added it to 2 cups of powdered sugar and 3-4 tablespoons of french vanilla creamer.  That turned out awesome!  This is not my first time making cinnamon rolls but my first in my bread machine.  They turned out wonderful.  I might add pecans or something like that next time to dress them up a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.  Turned out great.  It's VERY important to make sure your eggs and butter are room temperature.  Make sure the milk is warm too.

I subbed one cup of white flour for wheat (seems to keep the rolls more moist).  Also, for the filling, if you mix the butter with the sugar/cinnamon, then spread mixture on dough, there is MUCH less mess when you cut them into pieces!  :)  Turned out great!

These were great, I think I have now made about 6 pans of these. The family really luvs them.  I rolled the dough out on parchment paper, then when the rolls were done, I flipped them out on the same paper.  I melted the butter and added the brown sugar and cinnamon and spread this on the dough, much easier, and let's face it the butter is going to melt anyhow.     I like subbing almond extract for the vanilla in the frosting.

All I can say is my family (i.e. parents, aunts, siblings, etc.) all expect me to make these for breakfast when I come to visit. OH MY GOSH are they FABULOUS. I actually found the recipe on kingarthurflour.com who referenced this site. They're great to make the night before and pop right in the over in morning for that fresh cinnabon smell and taste. Whoever you are reading this you must MAKE THEM RIGHT NOW!!! DON'T HESITATE!! You will not regret it and your family, friends or neighbors will thank you!! :-)

Loved this recipe! I used my KitchenAid mixer plus the dough hook to make this recipe.

Followed the basic proportion for the dough but decreased the sprinkling sugar and added raisins. 

I had to leave out the cream cheese because I though I had a bar left in the refrigerator before I started baking and didn't want to run to the supermarket to buy it. I just used powdered sugar diluted in some milk.

Turned out really good!!!

They came out GREAT!  I did adjust the temp to 350 and baked for about 18 minutes.  Didn't need to turn them over into another pan.  The cinnamon/sugar didn't come out.  I also melted the butter before I spread it on the dough.  The frosting was delicious and the perfect amount!  I definitely recommend trying these! :)

I thought this recipe was just okay. It was a bit too sweet though, so it overpowered the taste of the yeasty rolls. However, for those who love super-sweet cinnamon rolls this recipe would be perfect.

Quick and easy and delicious! I used a cream cheese frosting instead of the frosting in the recipe but otherwise I didn't change anything.

I just finished making these and they are AMAZING!!! I am so glad I found this recipe, they only altercation I did was add about 2 tbsp of coconut oil to help retain moisture. This is a must try.

Really tasty. My boyfriend said they were perfect! I doubled the frosting, which probably isn't necessary, but made for some super yummy ooey gooey cinnamon rolls.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times were a complete success!  I don't have the bread machine, so I used a packet of the active dry yeast and dissolved it in warm milk (as others suggested), which worked out perfectly.  My only adjustment was to add the butter to the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture and then to spread it onto the rolled out dough, which was by accident the first time, but I didn't have any issues with the ingredients coming out of the rolls.  I also doubled the icing recipe as my family loves the extra icing.  Great recipe...I will continue to use this one for sure!

I use a stand-mixer and make with a few modifications. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in 1/2 cup warm water. Then mix in 1/2 cup warm milk, 1/2 cup melted butter, and two slightly beaten eggs. Now mix in two cups ALL-PURPOSE flour. Switch to a dough hook, add remaining AP flour and 1 1/2 tsp salt. Knead at least ten minutes. Then let rise until doubled. 
Roll dough out to 16"x 21", completely cover the dough with melted butter, THEN spread the sugar mixture out evenly. DO NOT ever mix the butter and sugar/cinnamon together. Now roll the dough so you have a 21" wide log, NOT 16"! Do NOT pinch-together/seal the seam. Your rolls will cork-screw up, rather than spread outwards as they rise. Place the dough on a well-floured surface. Cut the log in half using DENTAL FLOSS, not a knife. Do this by sliding the floss underneath the log, crossing over the top, then pulling in opposite directions to neatly slice the dough. Cut each half in half again, then each quarter into thirds. Place the 12 rolls into a well greased 9" x 13" baking dish. Ones with a high straight up-and-down edges work best. Cover and let rise until they at least completely fill the dish. Be patient! Now bake in a 350 degree oven 25 - 30 minutes. I hope this helps.

These were soo-ooo yummy, and the breadmaker made them simple to create. We don't have a Cinnabon store near us anymore, so this was a delightful weekend treat! I think that the icing is even better than the original, and as the cook, I got to lick the beaters! Thanks for sharing this little gem, Marsha!

These are absolutely delicious.  I have been making them for years, and now they have become our Sunday tradition.  Follow the recipe exactly, and with the bread machine  your work is cut in half.

Just finished making these buns.  They are GIGANTIC!  I would highly suggest dividing the dough in half and then making smaller rolls...there is no way anyone in my family could ever eat a whole one.  As well, smaller rolls would allow for more even cooking - when the large buns are placed in a 9 x 13 the ones in the middle really don't cook well...

I tried this recipe, using Andytami's process for making the dough (since I don't have a bread machine) and Jennifer Woodard's suggestion for after they're done. There's a reason that these are the most helpful review!

I also had to use whipped cream cheese since I was fresh outta the normal stuff (about 28 tbs to simulate an 8oz package and I similarly used dbdcook's modifications to the icing for the 8oz, (2/3 c butter, 4 c powdered sugar, 1-1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 tsp salt) minus the salt). I mixed the butter and cinnamon sugar together to make it easier to spread.

I made 16 out of this recipe and had SO MUCH FROSTING LEFT OVER I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. Definitely didn't need to double+ that part of the recipe, I dunno what other folks were doing with it!

They're really yummy, though! Easy to make, too; might have a new favorite for breakfast. Freeze some and then just make one in the morning? Yes please! I might actually eat, then!

I've made these multiple times and everyone has been really happy every time. My arteries are probably going to revolt on me at some point. :)

As others have noted, these store really well in the freezer. I pack them tightly in Saran wrap in ones or twos and that way I can take them out in small amounts to reheat in the microwave later.

Made it last night.  Used my kitchen aid w dough hooks, kneaded 5 min, thn placed n greased bowl in warm oven.  After the dough doubled, made out rolls and refrigerated over night.  In a.m. Placed directly from fridge into oven as it warmed  to temp. After 25 min took out and tuned out onto waxed paper.  Flipped iced and enjoyed.  Love these rolls.  My husband loves cinnamon rolls and these were some of the best ever!

These are just okay for me. I think they were too big for a 9x13 pan (I rolled from the short end but the video says to roll from the long end. I watched it after I made them but that was the only thing I did different than the video. I think they would have risen better if they had more room between them. They won't come out big and fluffy like the picture in a 13 x 9 pan. After looking at other pictures it doesn't look like very many come out big and fluffy. Also, 400 was too hot (I have a temperature guage in my oven so it was the correct temperature. They cooked too fast and were very brown on top but still doughy in the middle. If I try these again I will lower the temperature and spread them out over two pans maybe to give them more room. I also didn't find the filling very gooey (which I like). Overall, these were just okay for me. I didn't try the icing as I like my buns without.

These are really good. I made them on Christmas morning for my family and they were all in heaven. The cream cheese frosting is the best part. I made the bread dough by hand, though, as I do not have a bread machine and it still turned out fine.

This is the second time I have made these using my bread machine on the dough cycle. The dough is soft & easy to roll out. I reduce the butter/cinnamon/sugar mixture & eliminate the frosting as a personal preference. I also use a larger rimmed baking sheet instead of the 9x13 cake pan, as these are BIG rolls! These are SO delicious, even better than the chain. And so much cheaper to make!

I love this recipe... I have never been able to work well with yeast until using this in the bread machine... It is so easy... Only thing I did different was that I melted the butter and spread on the dough with a pasty brush... This made the cinnamon and brown sugar stick so it did not fall out like some other reviewers said...

Oh my God!!!  These are amazing!!  Made them for Christmas morning. What a treat, as they turned out absolutely perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly and put the ingredients in the bread maker Christmas Eve before going to bed.  I set the timer so it would be done kneading and rising by 7am. When I woke up I went right to step 2 which the kids helped with. That's the fun part, rolling and cutting the dough!  The icing is just right with the perfect amount of cream cheese.  I am always watching my weight but I didn't cut back on any of the ingredients.  I did not want to mess with perfection and it paid off!  I added a few pecans to one side of the pan so we had 4 with nuts and the rest without.  Just make sure to under cook them a little. If the tops turn golden brown, chances are the bottoms (which will be the new tops) will be too well done.  At least that's how my family likes them, a little more undercooked than overlooked.

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls. Amazing.  I'm not a huge cinnamon roll fan, but these were good!  They got rave reviews from all who tried them. Very time consuming but well worth it for special occasions.  I made them without a bread machine based on the advice from Andytami's review and they turned out perfect.  The dough felt a little dry as I was working with it but must've been okay because they turned out great!

I must have done something wrong because the dough did not "double" in size, both in the breadmaker or while rising before baking?  I baked for 15 minutes but they were not done when I took them out.  Dough was not cooked all the way?  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but will try to make again?

I bake, a lot, but I have to tell you that this is one of my all time favorite recipes.  I do not have a bread machine so I use my good old Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook.  These are easy to make and come out perfect!  My friend and family love and hate me for finding this recipe.

Really Good.  I added a 1/2 of a 3.5 oz package of vanilla pudding mix and 2 tbsp of additional water to the dough cycle.  For all other ingredients, I put in the exact measurements and items called for.  Once the dough was ready to put the cinnamon/sugar/butter combo on, I mixed these together first, then spread on top of the dough.  When the rolls came out of the oven, I did as a few other reviewers suggested, and put tinfoil on top of the pan and inverted the pan upside-down so that the "filling" could run back onto the buns - worked great.  The frosting is spot on and so good.  Turned out really yummy.

I must admit I have a great cinnamon roll recipe. However, I was never 100% happy with the icing. So when I saw this recipe, I thought I'd give it a try. At first my husband was a bit skeptical because he does not like cream cheese, but WOW!!! The cream cheeee is what gives it that extra umph! The icing recipe is definitely a 5-star!

This recipe was absolutely excellent! I did make one change, which was to take out the rolls one to two minutes before the 15 minute mark. They were heavenly I would recommend to anyone looking for a good dessert to make or just a snack !!!

These are the best cinnamon rolls ever! I almost wish I'd never made them because knowing that these things are only a couple of hours away at any time is not a good thing for our waistline! So good!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  CLONE IT IS...EVEN BETTER IMHO!  The only changes I made are this.  As they NEVER rise for me after, LOL, I have taken to leaving the dough in the bread maker for a half an hour after the machine is done.  The dough is to the top!!!  Then I roll is out and go about it and pop them in the oven right away.  Thank you for sharing this!  I no longer buy the Cinnzeo buns.  I think they have altered the recipe or use less filling anyway, as the last couple of times we tried them they haven't been the same.  These are my go to EVERYTIME!!!

Yummy!  Took the advice to flip over when done to let drippings drizzle.  Also, I never like the taste of frosting from powdered sugar so I used canned cream cheese frosting.  My kids want me to make this all the time now.

These are the best rolls, I made these for our coffee clutch, and had to give the recipe to many of my friends.  I cut down to 3/4 cup of milk,4 cups flour, and 2 teaspoons of yeast.  The comment was very yummy.

I entered these in the Sheboygan county fair in Wisconsin and took first place!!  Judge just kept exclaiming "EXCELLENT!"  I also made them to sell in a concession stand. For those, I cut them smaller so they would make more.  I made 18 instead of 12 and baked in 2 pans.  Just remember to remove the pan with the extra 6 earlier or put them in a smaller pan to bake as they got done much quicker.  this is the last cinnamon roll recipe I will ever search for as it is the best!!!

Excellant cinnamon rolls. Chris thought that the cream cheese frosting had just a bit too sharp of a flavor - probably from the cream cheese though. I lessened the yeast to 2 teaspoons for high altitude.

I just made these for the 2nd time and all I can say is wow! I am by no means a professional baker but I certainly feel like I was after making these. The cinnamon rolls are absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I wouldn't change a thing about these rolls with the exception of a tad more brown sugar/cinnamon filling.

This recipe is amazing for the bread machine. I have a magic chef. Don't know if it matters. Anyway the one thing I would recommend is to use a baking stone. Coat it with the butter flavor crisco beforehand. They slide right off and they don't burn on the bottom as easily. And remember the darker the stone the better. It means it's seasoned. Never use soap to clean it. Its just like cast iron, you shouldn't use soap on them.

First time making dough! No bread machine so followed suggestions of several reviews for making dough without machine. Followed rest of recipe exactly (ecept baking temp & time). May not taste exactly like Cinnabon...but they were outstanding! I baked at 350 degrees and they were done in 15 minutes (next time I will place on lowest oven rake and see if that changes time any). A little time consuming but worth it!

I have to admit, I don't often review recipes unless they blow me away...which this one did.  I always used to think that it wasn't worth the effort to make cinnamon rolls from scratch instead of just going with the frozen ones.  I now know this is wrong.  Wonderful recipe which really isn't very difficult.  I have halved the recipe and made the full recipe, either way making 6 rolls, the full recipe obviously making much bigger rolls.  We like to put the frosting on after serving them so everyone gets as much as they want.  These beat any cinnamon roll I've had.

Very sweet and delicious.  Brown sugar in filling could be reduced to 2/3 c. I think.  Nice texture and great frosting.

Well, let me add my 5 kazillionith 5 star rating to this great recipe.  So easy with the bread machine with ingredients on hand.  I did bake mine for about 4 extra minutes as they didn't seem quite brown enough.  That was just perfect at 19 minutes total.  This definitely deserves all the 5 star reviews.

If you love Cinnabon you are going to hate these because they are just as good! I made mine in my bread maker. I ended up having to add about a 1/4 cup of flour to the recipe because the dough was too damp. I also made the rolls and placed them raw into the fridge and followed the example another baker had followed and baked them off in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes (place the rolls into the oven while its cold). I cannot wait to make these again and again.

My husband and I both thought they tasted very much like Cinnabon.  I would have to do a taste comparison to see if there is a difference.

These are GREAT. I would give them more stars if there were more to give. The secret I think, is starting them in the bread machine. That step makes them easier to make. A keeper for sure

Made these with frozen bread dough! Omg.....awesome! Love the icing. 
The only problem I have is when I baked them,the center raises up and make a cone.

Good recipe but for my family that eats really healthy all the time it was just too sweet for us. I thinkif we decide to indulge again I will reduce the amount of sugar and add some whole wheat flour.

Taste very similar to cinnabon. I did not change anything with this recipe. They are just as good the next day warmed up in microwave for about 45 seconds. Yum!

Just made these a few hours ago as a surprise Birthday breakfast for my boyfriend. Absolutely amazing! It's just the two of us so i halved the recipe to make six. I prepared the dough by hand since i wasn't sure if such a small batch would work in my bread machine. When i cut the roll the six pieces were still too big so i cut it into 12 pieces instead. I know these are supposed to mimic a cinnabon, which are enormous, but i was fine settling with just copying the taste. This also cut the calories per serving in half which is nice. Very very good, would not change a thing and will definitely make again.

I love these, they are super easy and delicious.  I, like someone suggested, flip mine out on a plate so the "stuff" doesn't ooze out and I like to separate them just a bit before frosting.  I'm experimenting with freezing a few uncooked and a couple cooked ones just to see how they turn out.

I made these for a Saturday morning breakfast for my job and these got rave reviews!  I also sent some to my husband's work and they keep asking me to make more to send in!  These are extremely easy to make and delicious.  To save time I did use store bought cream cheese icing which seemed to work fine.

HEAVENLY! I made without the icing.  The dough tastes like my mother's sweet bread which I adore.  I just finished my first batch of these cinnamon buns and ate three right away! Best recipe for dough.  I softened my butter too much; it melted. So, I added the sugar & cinnamon and spread it on the dough. I also followed someone's tip and turned them out of the pan shortly after removing from the oven.

Made a double batch for Easter Sunday for church.  These cinnabon's were gone in less than 5 minutes,  Everyone loved them, I even had three people tell me they thought these may have been one of the best cinnamon rolls they had ever eaten.

This recipe is amazing.  Read the reviews if you do not have a bread machine and you will not be disappointed.  These didn't even last 24 hours in my house after I made them.  Five stars all the way!!!

Can't even remember how many times I have made these in the last month, everyone wants more!!! Wouldn't change anything, they are a hit.  Maybe a few minutes less in the oven and they are soft and chewy, just a preference though since we have made them so many times!

No wonder this recipe is in the top 20.  I made it without a bread machine following others advice.  Turned out to be excellent.  Made my house smell like a Cinnabon store.  Yum Yum.

OMG lord help all of our waistlines. These are incredible. Even my husband who once told me he was indifferent to cinnamon rolls said these were delicious. I've made these twice in a week. The dough is such a pleasure to work with. It's soft and smooth and easy to roll. I think I might like the act of making these rolls more than eating them. They're just fun to make and very very close to the actual Cinnabons.

There are not adjectives to describe the goodness of these cinnabons.  This recipe has given me the confidence that I really can make cinnamon rolls from scratch. Super easy  Everyone who tries these, love them:)

These are indeed yummy, mine didn't double in size when they were covered for thirty minutes though.  I didn't have any problem with the filling spilling out though.  This makes MORE than enough frosting (I had enough leftover for maybe 4 more rolls!)

This actually ended up being way better than cinnabon, and so easy too!  The only change I made was that I used saigon cinnamon instead of basic.  What a huge difference that made though, it just made the taste way more powerful and basically perfect!  I will make this often!!

These are excellent, but never never NEVER use margarine when you're baking.  So, in the dough, use 1/3 cup real salted or unsalted butter.  

I didn't have cream cheese, so I just made a powdered sugar glaze.  

Kind of seems unfair to rate a recipe when you make alterations, but they were delicious.  Probably would have rated 4 stars if margarine were used in the dough.

omg!  This was absolutly amazing. MY FIRST TIME making cinnamon buns. I was told to cut down the brown sugar so next time I will  to 3/4 cup; but wow.. it was incredible. I did the Happy Dance when I went to check on how much they had risen in the pan!  My grandsons eyes went buggy when he seen how big they were and FRESH out of the oven. I used ordinary Robinhood flour and it was AMAZING!!!! Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to make! The buns were much lighter and fluffier than the store bought ones. I used sour cream instead of cream cheese because I didn't have any for my icing. This is 5 stars all the way! I will be making another batch for Thanksgiving and I'm going to add roasted pecans and a dash of nutmeg to the cinnamon sugar mixture next time! Yummy!!!!

Great recipe.  Subbed AP flour for the bread flour as I didn't have any and it was still delicious, chewy and light.  Fantastic fake out for cinnabon cinnamon rolls!!

Back for this recipe again. If they weren't as bad for my hips as they are, I would make them once a month. As is, they are on my to do list at least three times a year. I make the dough in my Kitchen Aid.

SOOOOOOOOO good!!!! I didn't have any brown sugar so i addes about 2 TBSP to 1 cup of granulated sugar. I also didn't have any cream cheese so I substituted sour cream for the cream cheese. I cooked mine for about 15 minutes, took them out of the oven and let rest for about 5 minutes or so. I then turned the pan upside down onto a serving dish to get all the good stuff out of the bottom of the pan then frosted!! They were delish. Will def make again and again.

I made these today and wow they are great...After the dough is done I roll it out and then I melt the butter and pour it over the brown sugar and cinnamon and combine together.  I then spread on the dough and sprinkled roasted pecans on it then rolled it up...wow the flavor is just awesome...thanks for the recipe...:)

I was disappointed in this recipe, after reading all of the raving reviews I was looking forward to making it.  Did not taste like a cinnabon at all to me! I won't make it again.

I halved this recipe. I was worried when the yeast mixture didnt froth, but the end result came out wonderful! Not exactly a clone, but close enough to satisfy my Cinnabon craving.

dunno what happened- I had such high hopes for these buns. My hubby complained that they were not "lite". I gotta try these again. Something went wrong although I did follow the recipe.(I did not use a bread machine) The dough doubled just like it was supposda both times but dough was DRY??? Maybe start with 4c of flour???? They looked GREAT, tasted aight, texture bleh. Will update.

These tasted phenomenal!  I used my mixer to make the dough and doubled the frosting.  Next time I will use less cream cheese in the frosting as I thought it was a bit overpowering in flavor.

Added 1/2 Tablespoon vanilla to the dough-they were the best ever!  Also used 1/2 all purpose flour, and it worked great.

Even with over 4000 reviews, I thought I'd add mine.  These are not quite like Cinnabons, but they were definitely worth cheating on my diet!  I don't have a bread machine, and without reading the reviews I kind of wing'd it.  I used a stand mixer, and let it rise in a warm oven, took about 1.5 hrs.  the 2nd rise, I let it rise for 35 mins.  Then baked at 350 for 22 mins.  Came out perfect!  I did not use the cream cheese frosting, I made a regular glaze, I didn't measure anything, just a huge cup of powdered sugar and then slowly poured in a little milk at a time till the consistency I liked.  Will definitely be making this again.

Used the advice in several reviews and doubled the icing - I wish I hadn't.  Way too sweet for my husband and I. If you love sweet and sugar, double icing; if not, make as is. These were delicious and I will make again. 
* I made this again and cut the sugar in the icing by a third. I also only added a small dab to each roll and let others add icing as they needed. Those who added icing did so sparingly. Next time I will cut the whole icing recipe down to half along with the sugar. I also only used two Tbsp butter and the icing was still fine.

Oh my heaven! If you like cinnamon rolls you must try this recipe.  These are worth the effort! I added chopped pecans to half of my rolls and I should have baked them a bit longer, but they were fabulous.  I stuck with the original amount of icing and thought that was plenty, in fact I had a lot of extra! (btw, the icing is to die for as well)

I am not much of a bread baker of any kind, but these were easy to do and so so delicious!  I took the advice of some others and mixed the filling and then spread.  I didn't seem to have any problems with the cinnamon and brown sugar oozing out of the cinnamon roll.

I'm in love!  These are awesome!  As I was making the recipe, I thought it was going very wrong (I didn't use all the flour because I couldn't get it to absorb into the dough - I don't have a bread machine) but I continued to go with it anyway and see it out until the end and boy am I glad I did!  They were outstanding cinnamon rolls.  I did not have a problem with the filling running out like others did and I thought the amount of frosting was appropriate to the number of rolls it made.

These are amazing!! I didn't have any bread flour, but it is really easy to make your own. You just add 1 TBSP of wheat gluten for every cup of flour! My kids really enjoy these, and I love how easy they are!! Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing! I have been making these for a couple of years and they are requested frequently by friends & co-workers. For an "adult" tweek to the icing, delete the vanilla and substitute with some Bailey's Irish Cream (about an ounce or so). Yum!!

This is my favorite cinnamon rolls recipe! I only used half the filling, and they tasted great. I made the dough in the bread machine, formed the rolls, put them in the refrigerator over night, and baked them the next day. I let one batch rise for 30 minutes in the morning before baking, but I made my other batch right away. They turned out perfect!

These are SOOO good! You will not be disappointed. The only thing I change is doubling the recipe for filling. Considering thats the best part, the amount if calls for doesnt seem to be quite enough.

These are awesome - I like them better than Cinnabon! (Partly because they make the house smell so good!)

Simply Perfect!  If you love Cinnabon rolls...the soft, gooey, delicious rolls with lots of cream cheese icing....then you will LOVE these!  Easy to make.  Only difference is I up the cream cheese to 8oz and it was heavenly!

I LOVE this recipe! It's so pretty easy (just takes some time) and DELICIOUS! I've modified to use with a stand mixer (or by hand) on my blog: http://www.noraisinsonmyparade.com/2011/01/cinnabon-cinnamon-rolls.html

These were amazing! So soft and yummy. However, I think the suggested time was too long because the bottom of the buns were a little over cooked and the sugar burnt a little at the bottom. Other than that, it was like store bought!

I hate baking usually but the bread machine make this a breeze.  I added nuts to the filling and a tablespoon or two of maple syrup (regular old Log Cabin) to the icing, and these rolls were such a hit I had to make them 3 times in a week!

I have been making these for years! I usually use 3 TBS of cinnamon in the roll AND to make it easier, get the frozen bread loaves, I use Rhodes. Thaw the loaf for an hour on the counter or until totally thawed. Then roll it out and proceed with resipe. It wont roll out as large as the scratch recipe but is just as good and saves time! I also add chopped pecans to the filling if I have them and some cinnamon the the frosting! Yummers!!

My first attempt at making cinnamon rolls- whew! Now I need a nap! I did it all by hand- next time I'll use my bread machine. I'll cut back on the amount of brown sugar and cinnamon next time, but they're yummy! they did not really rise- maybe I used the wrong kind of yeast? Next time I will double recipe- it's a lot of work for 12 rolls!

OMG! These cinnamon rolls were a huge hit on Christmas morning!!  My husband now wants me to make them every weekend :)  I tried the suggestion of increasing the amount of frosting by using an entire 8 oz. cream cheese and it was the perfect amount.  I also did the overnight instructions and it was so much better than waking up extra early!  Awesome recipe!

Didn't like the dough at all, it was very bland... for the amount of sugar and butter called for in this recipe it was pretty disappointing. Think I'll try a different one in the future.

Fantastic Recipe!  I am a High School Foods Teacher and we just made these cinnamon rolls this week!  They were the BEST we have ever made.  Soft, gooey, moist, and delicious!  My students say that they are delectable!  We did not use a bread machine and stretched it out over 3 days, they still came out perfectly.

Amazing!  We loved them.  I have the Cinnabon cinnamon - it's called Korintje in other stores and it is sweet and just made this roll perfect.  I also make a pecan-caramel sauce to make them into pecanbons and we were amazed.  Great recipe!  Thanks.

Don't plan on looking further. These rolls are heaven. I didn't have 'bread' flour. I used all purpose flour about an extra 1/2 cup and added about a tsp of baking soda (not sure it that made a difference or not) They rose HIGH and the texture was fantastic.  I don't have a bread machine and I used my Kitchen Aid with a bread hook. I placed all the wet ingrediants first, but not the butter. I added the flour, and the melted butter towards the end. I let it run for 5-10 minutes on low. It was a lot of work for my mixer and I kneaded another minute or two by hand. I let rise 1hr in my warm oven (preheated to 200 and turned off) I wrapped in cling wrap and refrigerated overnight. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes. PERFECTION.

These are awesome!  I used butter instead of margarine in the dough and you don't need to double the frosting.  I'm making these again very soon to use up the rest of it!

Perfect!  We just had these for our Christmas morning treat and they are so gooey, sticky, sweet, and yummy!   I planned on making as written but realized this morning I had no cream cheese (what!?  I always have cream cheese!) so I substituted a little milk and plain yogurt.  Cream cheese is probably even better!

This was our Christmas morning treat.  They tasted just like Cinnabon to us.   We followed the recipe to the letter and they came out perfect.  The cinnamon rolls are absolutely delicous.

Wonderful recipe.  As other reviewers mentioned, I prepared it in a 2 day process.  If your'e serving it for breakfast, it is much easier to prepare the buns the night before.  Once I got to the point where I placed the buns in the pan, I covered them up and put them in the fridge.  I also prepared the icing the night before and put it in a separate container in the fridge.  The next morning, I cooked buns at 350 degrees for 30-40 minutes.  I put the icing container on top of the stove.  The stove wasn't on, but the heat from the oven warmed it up.  So when the bun were done, I poured the icing on.  It worked perfectly.  The only cream cheese I could find was fat free, but it was great that way.

So I'm an electrician alright. I struggled to get the dough to rise. I don't have a bread machine and I think I used the wrong yeast because I struggled to get the dough to rise. After a little research I boiled some water, popped the pan in the oven with my dough, and got my dough to rise. This is my first real bread baking experience and even I couldn't make these turn out bad. Amazing texture and flavor. My wife even commented that these are the best homemade cinnamon rolls she's ever tasted. I'm very encouraged to keep trying this recipe and maybe even get a mixer. They might not be Clone of a Cinnabon but that's a sweet name nonetheless.

Fabulous.  Used the bread machine and also the (below rater's) method for making them by hand.  Both turned out amazing.  I doubled the icing recipe.

I had made these for the first time a couple of night ago and here I am again making another batch, the first batch turned out amazing, I added a little more cinnamon like some had suggested but I didn't need to turn over the pan to recoat at all, I figure if you roll the dough up tight enough to begin with turning them over was unnecessary for me and I followed the recipe to a "T". I also used my kitchen aid mixer instead of a bread machine, I let it knead for about 4 min, and did a light knead before I placed the dough in a bowl lightly brushed with oil, I have a proof setting on my oven so I let it proof for an hour then rolled it out and assembled and cut then let it sit for 20 min in the oven again to proof a bit more then took it out while the oven preheated to 350 then baked for the suggested time...I will definitely be baking these cinnabons over and over again...hope this helped...thx for the great recipe...

These are great! I didn't make them in a bread machine. I just dumped everything together in a stand mixer and used the hook to knead the dough for a few minutes, then let it rise. I subbed 1c white whole wheat flour, replaced half of the margarine with mashed banana, and halved the butter in the filling. It still came out delicious even with all the adjustments I made! I'm keeping this recipe and making it again soon.

I have a fantastic cinnamon bun recipe but the "clone of a cinnabon" title made me try these.  They weren't particularly different, but i loved the idea of brown sugar with the cinnamon-it caramelized really well. And cream cheese frosting is always a hit.
They did end up either a drop raw or a drop overdone; hence the 4 stars.

Delish - made this on the weekend for a bunch of friends, and they raved about them.  I didn't have bread machine yeast, so I used regular active dry yeast, and after activating it, added it to the dough setting of my bread machine and that also works exactly the same.

*A*M*A*Z*I*N*G*! I followed a members advice of flipping them over and letting the sauce coat the rolls after they come out of the oven. These rolls are set apart by the large amount of cinnamon - at first I thought it was a typo but went with it anyhow. I wouldn't mind using a better quality cinnamon next time to make them even MORE amazong! I also use floss when slicing the tube into rolls. Perfect Cinnamon rolls!

Love this recipe!  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and ran into a problem with the topping overflowing my pan, so the second time, I used two pans.  Easy fix.    My family didn't enjoy the cream cheese icing the first time around, so I looked up a non-cream cheese icing and used that the next time.  Much better.   Even my mother-in-law thought these were awesome!  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic - I had never really bake with yeast let alone doing this recipe without a bread machine. I took the advice of other reviews and it worked out great. Will make again so! Thanks for the great recipe.

So wonderful - and easy to make! I'm not really good with rolling out the pastry, but managed to spread this dough into a rectangle without a problem. I don't like too sweet deserts so I only used about a half of the sugar/cinnamon mixture, and only half of the frosting. Buns were still great and the whole family loved them!

These are incredible!!! my husband had 3 of them in a row, right out of the oven! Here is a tip to make them FAT FREE (courtesy of my sister in law): substitute apple sauce for butter; whenever the recipe calls for butter, subtitute 1/2 that amount for apple sauce (ie. 1 cup of butter= 1/2 cup applesauce). Also, when rolling out the dough, instead of spreading butter all over it, spray some PAM (nonstick cooking spray on the dough). You would never know they were fat free, they are truly incredible!!

Pretty good! Really good warm. The dough could have been a little sweeter and the filling spills out while cooking pretty easily. I have had better recipes, but my husband was madly in love with it, and he ate five of them!

This is SO SO delicious.  The only thing I might do next time is double the cinnamon/brown sugar an butter. I definitely don't think that it was gooey enough in the middle. Still amazing though. I've made this several times, it's the only recipe i use!

I've never tried Cinnabon to know if this is a clone, but these cinnamon buns are awesome!  We loved them.  My bread machine manual does not recommend using margarine, so I used butter instead but used margarine for the cinnamon spread and frosting.  Very, very good recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing.

The dough was fabulous but there was way too much cinammon/ sugar mix in middle. Next time will cut in half. I doubled the icing which was perfect. Did not taste like cinnabon but was still good.

This was great.  I added a box or vanilla instant pudding for moistness. I work for a Fire Department and took them in, There was not one left.  I have had a lot of people ask for the recipe.

Absolutely divine.  So good that I had a friend pay for me to come from DC to Pittsburg so I could make these for his friends after they challenged his assertions about how good they are.    One thing that I found helpful is to increase the amount of cinnamon in the filling-- this makes it stick a bit better and gets you closer to the way real cinnabons are. Otherwise the filling tends to run right out to the bottom.

I'm scared! I hope I don't eat them all. Wow, these are really good. I used my bread machine and followed the recipe exactly. The only thing is I only had multi-grain bread flour and used that. They still turned out great - a little healthier too I suppose. I will use regular bread flour when baking these for guests - I'm sure they will blow their minds! A definite must try!

The only thing i'd change is add about a tablespoon (give or take) to the frosting. The original was too sticky and balled up.

The only thing i didnt like about this was the frosting. It was way too sweet and not tart enough to taste like the real thing. I even doubled the cream cheese to try to cut the sweetness but it didnt help.. On a second run, i used an 8 oz block of cream cheese with only 1 cup of powdered sugar plus the rest of the icing ingredients as written in the recipe and it was much closer to the icing served on the rolls at cinnabon. i would suggest to  the sugar a little at a time and taste as you go, stopping once you get to the right consistency and flavor for your taste prefrence. Aside from that, the rolls were spot on!

I make these ahead and refrigerate them overnight - just put in fridge once ready for second rise.

Holy Hannah! I sit at the keyboard fueled by the best morsel of food I've ever created.  I mixed the brown sugar/butter/cinnamon combo all together prior to spreading it on.  Worked fine.  Also, because it was all I had, I used "lite" cream cheese and it was wonderful.  The proportions were all right on the money.  Thanks Marsha Fernanez.  Someday you'll be on Oprah for this, I feel it!

These are wonderful!  The first time I made these, I made the mistake of punching down the dough and letting it rise again.  Oops.  However, they still came out wonderful.  The second time I made these, the texture was much better because I didn't punch it down and let it rise again.  I followed the directions the second time regarding rising.  They're great with or without frosting; they're great with or without nuts (walnuts or pecans).  We love these!  I'm going to use this recipe to make cinnamon bread, too.    Outstanding!  Simply, outstanding!  Very minor changes that I made: I used a glass dish; I added a tablespoon of Gluten to the bread part; I doubled the amount of cinnamon (it needs a bite or zing); I doubled the amount of the filling; I made the paste mixture for the filling; I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling; I used olive oil instead of butter (but butter works) in the bread part, not the filling part.  

USE DARK BROWN SUGAR!
USE GLASS BAKING DISH!
BAKE AT 350 FOR 20 TO 25 MINUTES!
DBL FILLING
DBL FROSTING (OR NOT)
ADD EXTRA CINNAMON FOR A BITE

DANGER, DANGER! These are WAY too good!! Hubby and I ate the whole pan ourselves in 2 days. Yikes! BTW: I don't think they need the frosting at all - they are sweet enough.

This recipe is way dry. I followed it exactly and while the filling was tasty and reminded me of Cinnabon the bread was so dry even right out of the oven I couldn't even swallow.

FABULOUS recipe, would not change a thing. When you see this many positive reviews, you know it's going to be a great recipe. These taste professional and are so impressive. I had no problems & used my bread machine. For some reason my buns grew enormous (guess that active dry yeast was REALLY active!), but that's not a complaint. Thank you, Marsha; this one's a keeper!

I went up north for vacation and tried to make this without a bread machine.  The dough never rose!  I followed one person comment on how to make it without bread machine, but still it did not work.  I really wish there were specific instructions on how to make this without a bread machine.  I have made pizza dough in the past and been successful, how sad this did not work out. :(

Very good! I made it not using a bread machine and still turned out great. My husband is hard to please and he loved them. Closest tasting homemade cinnamon roll to a cinnabon.

Ohh my. I decided to try this a few weeks ago, and it was a HIT. So I made a fourfold recipe for my best friend who just had her fifth baby, for her to have something to serve when people come over. She put them in the freezer to keep. Next time she had company and wanted to serve some up, she found that children number 1, 2, and 3 had finished them. So in the few weeks since I first made this, I have made 9 batches for my family and others. So good So good.

Excellent recipe- Thanks so much.  I used 3/4 c sugar, and made a mixture of butter, sugar, cinnamon and cornflour- as a reviewer suggested. Also made a batch without any frosting at all- disappeared just as quickly. Overall the best I ever had- and I couldn't believe an amateur like me made those!!!

These were Amazing.  I followed the other reviews for making this in a Stand mixer since I don't have a bread machine.  The only problem I had was that 15 minutes was not enough time in the oven.  The buns looked golden brown but they where still doughy on the inside so I had to bake them an extra 15-20 minutes after they were iced.  The icing recipe makes more then enough.  One tip is to follow the proofing directions on the package of yeast.  I also let my dough rise in a 200 degree oven that was turned off and then let them sit in the fridge overnight.  These should be called 'Better then Cinnabon' because not only are they easy to make but they save you a ton of money :)

My cousin made these at Christmas and I had to see if I could make them just as well for Easter. They turned out extremely well...a little dry, but I didn't have a bread machine and I feel that could have made the difference. Thank you Marsha for sharing your recipe, definitely a keeper.

I just didn't think I could ever make anything that tastes BETTER than you can buy in a store. It always seems so impossible to make good food, especially something that requires yeast and rolling dough, but my god, these were PERFECT. I went with 350 degrees for 25 minutes and I essentially squealed with delight over how tasty and well-made these are. The recipe is FLAWLESS, and I also turned them out as soon as they came out from the stove so that the coating would drip back on then. A+

EVERONE that tried these said they were the best cinnamon roll they'd ever had!! Well worth the extra effort!   Perfect combination of bready and bicuity!   I followed the instructions by other reviewers to make without a bread machine and came out perfectly.  Double the frosting though to make them extra delicious!

Fabulous cinnamon rolls. I do not have a bread machine so I made these by hand. I found out that I needed a bit more flour than was called for in the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and the only addition I made was to add grated orange peel to the dough. I wanted an orange cinnamon bun and used this site's orange cream cheese frosting, which was delicious. I followed the advice and put the dough in a warmed oven to rise (I only warmed to 100 degrees for a few seconds and that was enough to make the dough double in size; I did not want to kill the yeast with too much heat). I also made the paste out of the butter, sugar,and cinnamon and added 1 TBSP of flour to the paste and had no trouble with the filling coming out. Some of the cooks have complained about the buns getting too hard, but as soon as mine came out of the oven, I tented them with a piece of foil and left the foil on for fifteen minutes then frosted the warm rolls. It is several hours later and the rolls are still soft and yummy. This is a wonderful recipe and deserves more stars than 5!

AMAZING! I've never made any type of bread before so I was pleased when I tasted this. I don't have a bread machine so I did it all by hand. This does take a big part of the day but that's only because you have to let it rise a few times. I did mix the cinnamon/sugar with the butter and spread it on the dough. I didn't have to flip the pan over afterwards...maybe it was because I mixed the sugar and butter? I also put the dough in a 200 degree oven shut off for an hour covered to rise like other people have mentioned and it worked well. I doubled the icing but I didn't need the extra...the icing is SO sweet...a little goes a long way. This is a great recipie and I will definitely make it again when I have the time!

These create delicious cinnamon rolls!!! I halved the recipe and got 6 HUGE rolls. I made the dough the night before and refrigerated over night. I took them out of the oven when I got up and let them sit for about an hour then baked them at instructed. Great Recipe!! Thanks!!

This recipe turned out great, even though I did it a little differently.  I loved that the dough was made in the bread machine.  I put the ingredients in and it made the dough while I went grocery shopping.  It was easy to put together after I took it out of the bread machine and rolled  and cut the rolls.  At this point, I did it a little differently.  They were suppose to rise 30 minutes and then bake.  It was late and I needed to go to bed, so I covered the pan and put them in the frig.  When I got up the next morning, I laid them out on the counter for abour 30 minutes then put them in the oven with the light on and a bowl of hot steaming water and they rose perfectly.  It did take longer than the 30 minutes it would have taken had i not put them in the frig, but they turned out well anyway.  I let them rise about and hour and forty five minutes in all.  They tasted great and they were not that hard to make.  I recommend this recipe and would make it again.

Follow this recipe to a “T” – no need to make substitutions.  I have made these cinnamon buns about 6 times now and have never been disappointed.  This is also a good recipe for those who have kids that like to help in the kitchen!  This is my family’s preferred choice for Christmas morning – and I love that I can do all prep work the night before and simply stick in the oven when ready to bake.  Hands down the best cinnamon bun recipe!

I made these to send with my husband to work, but only half of them made it there! They are some of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had!   I loved the icing, but my husband likes more of a glaze than actual icing on his cinnamon rolls.  So, the second time I made them, I separated them into a few pans, iced one pan as usual, and added about 1/2 to 1 tbsp of milk in the icing for the other.  It was more of a glaze as he liked, and more of it "soaked in" the rolls. But I thought they were amazing without any tweaking!

I was amazed that these taste exactly like a Cinnabon! My fiance loves Cinnabons and was hesitant to try the ones I made, but he could not believe how wonderful they were! This is my new favorite recipe!

This was the bomb! I made a half batch (got 8 instead of 6), it's just too much for me and my bf. I will make a full batch (16 instead of 12) when I have company over. The only change was the icing...I mixed 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 3 tbs milk, and 1/2 tsp vanilla and poured it on top when I pulled the rolls hot out of the oven. My bf loved them so much he ate 6 out of the 8 at one sitting....You've got to make this!

Incredible. I had high expectations from the reviews and from friends who have tasted them and was not disappointed! This was my first experience with a bread machine too. :)   I wasn't sure whether to roll the long side up or the short side up. I did the long side and I think thats what I was supposed to do. My only thought is that I would like to know how to make the rolls smaller. Eating one was like a second meal!

Ive made these twice and they came out great. I did it by hand, not the bread machine method. 1 cup brown sugar was a bit much, next time ill reduce to 3/4ths cup. For the icing, is the 3oz a typo? I used an 8 oz package and increased sugar to 1 3/4th cup. I also added vanilla bean to it. :)

delicious! they are best fresh , but still taste great in the next few days after re heated in micro. Spread a bit more butter on the rolled out dough to be sure all the cinnamon mixture stuck well to the dough and baked right in

What an AWESOME recipe!!  I'm picky when it comes to cinnamon rolls, but I've got nothing bad to say about these.  Yum, yum, yum!  I let my hubby (who isn't a fan of sweet things) take a little bite of a freshly baked roll and he happily took the whole thing. Everyone else we shared it with couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Aside from the buns, the frosting with the cream cheese really hit it for me.  Really GREAT recipe!

I made these by hand as I don't have a bread machine. I first dissolved the yeast in the warm milk and a little bit of sugar. For the dough, since I don't use margarine, I used butter. I mixed the butter, salt and eggs then mixed that with the milk/yeast and finally mixed in the flour. While the dough was rising I mixed the softened butter, brown sugar and cinnamon into a paste and then spread that on the rolled dough for an even coating. I then baked as the directions indicated. For me cooking for 15 minutes at 400 wasn't enough, they weren't cooked all the way through and had to put them back in the oven, which I turned off, for about 10 more minutes. I had no issues with the filling running so there was no need to flip the pan over. Overall the taste was okay. It certainly wasn't what I was looking for. I found the brown sugar taste to be too overpowering and the cinnamon didn't come through enough. Between the batter, the filling and the icing there was too strong of a butter flavor and it made me feel sick afterward. With some tweaking these could be great, but then it wouldn't be the same recipe.

good stuff. I had to seal the bottoms so they dont lick. They burn easily. I took someone's advise and froze 4 rolls. I will never do this again. they didnt rise nicely and they are not as good as before(backed freshly). Today I let them stay for about 8 hrs and then I put them in the oven when it just started to reheat for 350 (they were heating up slowly) once reheated to 350 I put timer for 15 min. it was perfect, I even made a fresh frosting... but when I had a first bite ... I will never froze them again, but I will defiantly bake them fresh.

These cinnamon rolls are great!  I don't have a bread machine so made the dough in my Kitchenaid mixer.  Let the yeast (1 .25 oz packet equals about 2 1/2 t) proof in the warm milk with about 2 T of the sugar for 10 minutes, stirred in the melted butter (but cooled slightly so it wouldn't kill the yeast or cook the eggs), eggs, the rest of the sugar, and the salt.  Dumped in 3 cups of the flour, mixed it up with the dough hook (I'll actually try the flat beater for the first 3 C flour next time so it gets mixed up faster, then switch to the dough hook), then added enough additional flour so that the dough still stuck to my finger a little when I touched it (this results in a soft dough that is perfect for cinnamon rolls).  Let it knead on the second from lowest speed for 8 minutes, then continued with the recipe as stated, rolling the dough out on 2 pieces of lightly floured waxed paper that I overlapped slightly and taped the bottom of :)  My only changes were that I only used 1 1/2 T cinnamon (I was nervous of 2 1/2 T even though I love it), accidentally left out the salt in the frosting and only used 1/4 t of vanilla.  I'm VERY pleased with the outcome of both the rolls and the frosting!  It only needs a couple of tweaks to be perfect- for example, next time I'm going to try mixing together the softened butter, sugar and cinnamon, then spread it on the dough rectangle so it's neater and easier to distribute perfectly.

Excellent!  Loved by all.  Had no problems keeping these.   I wrapped leftovers tightly in plastic wrap.  Heated by 2's for 30 seconds in microwave, covered.  Iced them individually just before eating.  Lasted (at least) two days ... only because they were hidden away.

Brought these to my granparents house for a graduation get together and everyone loved them!  I made more, smaller rolls in my big glass pyrex baking dish, then let them mostly cool before adding a vanilla glaze type frosting (I didn't have any cream cheese in the house).

This went over really well at my house. I baked two pans full but my brothers devoured them all. I was surprised by how much everyone loved them. I am definitely going to save money considering how obsessive I can be about Cinnabons.

I have made these twice now and they are wonderful... they really do taste like they were bought from a professional bakery. I also didn't have any trouble burning or icing running to the bottom, but I also cut back on the sugar/butter because I can only imagine how fattening these are! My only complaints are that after about 6 hours, even wrapped tightly, these start getting very dry and hard and are pretty much rocks by the next day, so they're almost impossible to save. I even tried freezing them and they were okay immediately after heating back up, but then back to rock. Also, the margarine gives them a very processed taste, and I have cut it back as well with no bad results. Thanks!

These were really good! My dough came out a little tough, but I attribute that to rising in too-warm of a place, and using regular flour in place of bread flour. They were still delicious, just not quite my perfect cinnamon rolls yet.

I LOVE this recipe. I am now known for my amazing cinnamon rolls- and they are sooo easy! I make the dough with the bread machine and then roll it out, spread it with the sugar, butter and raisins, then cut up and bake. Super easy and absolutely delicious!

THESE ARE AMAZING!!!!  I've avoiding making these for so long because of the time required to make them but after reading the reviews I will be making these more often!  After cutting them into rolls I put them in the fridge until I was ready to bake them in the morning.  They were the best breakfast I've ever made and all the hubby could say was WOW!  Refrigerated leftovers and they tasted just as good the next day after sticking them in the microwave.  Absolutely love these!

Holy Shamoligans!  Diebetic shock aside, these puppies were awersome.  Like the real deal.

Very delicious! A lot of work, but fun to make. Mine took a little more than fifteen minutes to cook. I made the dough, the filling and the icing just like the recipe stated and it all turned out perfectly!

I wanted this to come out 5 stars so bad I even tried twice!   Ok, here's what happened, I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the other suggestions and made it myself, I also allowed it to sit overnight in the fridge and then put them in a cold oven at 350*, here's where I think I went wrong. After 30 min, they didn't look brown and the inside looked too gooey so I turned off the over and allowed them to sit in there for several more minutes. This was my mistake because both times this happened and both times they were too done. I guess I might try again because this is such a highly rated recipe I want to experience the ooey gooey goodness that everyone claims comes from this recipe but it migh just be one of those things you have to perfect. Also flipping the cinnamon rolls over right out of the oven was probably one of the saving graces because it does coat the rolls agains with all the good stuff. If I try again I will either follow the instructions for baking exactly or take them out when they look too gooey and see what happens then.   My advice is read the other reviews and don't bake too long even if they don't look browned.

These turned out really tough. I really couldn't even eat them without microwaving them first to soften them.

I followed the recipe exactly and when my husband tried it, he said "This taste exactly like Cinnabon's!!!" It really did! I followed the one reviewers advice and flipped the buns upside down on to a serving dish immediately after taking out of the oven and drizzled all that sweet cinnamonny goo onto the buns before frosting.

Try melting the butter, adding the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture then spreading on the rolled out dough. I use a spatula to smear it around, works so much better than dry ingredients dropping everywhere (maybe I am just a messy cook?).  Also I cut the dough with a pizza slicer into 1 1/2 inch by 8 inch strips and roll individually not the whole dental floss gig..that never has worked for me (again maybe I am just a bad cook). Also I use a KITCHEN AID MIXER on the STIR level with a dough hook to mix it. I do use the bread machine (SAF instant yeast) with flour then add the milk in as the first step. Then let it rest for 10 minutes then add the rest of the ingredients (already combined in a separate bowl) and mix until the dough looks sticky and butter/sugar mix is distributed. (Sticky dough good, beat down tough dough bad)  I use two 9 x 13 casserole pans and put 12 in each  lined with wax paper so as soon as they come out I flip them onto a wax paper lined cookie sheet and peel of the wax paper (easy clean up). Make sure to roll the dough out thin enough (I like 1/4 inch) or else when it does its second rise you get really big rolls that pop the centers out as they cook. These are DELICIOUS!!! But if you are not good at making dough, practice! You need to let it rise enough to get the light airy soft texture that makes the Cinnabon famous. Also I like the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site better..the one listed is ordinary, not spectacular like Cinnabon.

These cinnamon rolls were so good.  I don't have a bread machine, so I substituted an 8 gram pack of dry active yeast for the bread machine yeast. Then kneaded the dough by hand.  The first time I made them, the dough tasted wonderful, but the rolls were too dense.   So, the second time I made them I decided to let the dough rise twice--once in the bowl, and after punching it down, rolling out and assembling the rolls, I let it/them rise again.  Because I like lots of filling, I increased the butter and sugar that I spread on the sheet of rolled out dough. If you do this, be careful not to put in too much, so that filling doesn't end up sticking to the bottom of the pan.  These were some of the best cinnamon rolls that I have ever eaten. For Real!

Easy to make and so good.  I did not double the frosting like some advised and I am glad I didn't.  It was enough.  It even dripped off them and on to the counter.  A family member took a bite and said it tasted just like Cinnabon.  I told her the title of the recipe.  Truely a great clone...maybe even better.

wonderful, wouldn't change a thing (except maybe add pecans next time).  My children love them too! Make sure you put a cookie sheet over the pan and invert the rolls into the cookie sheet prior to icing them, makes all the yummy goodness seep back into the roll and not get lost on the bottom of the pan!

Yummy flavor, very easy dough to work with.  I love cinnamon, but this is a bit too much, and I never thought I'd say that.  I'll try 2 Tbsp. next time.  Also, mine browned too much on the top before they were done, so watch closely as you may need to put a piece of foil over the top after 10-12 minutes.

These were fabulous! My husband said they tasted professional, which is a huge compliment coming from someone who doesn't eat a lot of sweets. I think they are better than Cinnabon. Only change was I used all-purpose four and didn't use a bread machine...MMMM!!

Yum!! Great recipe and pretty easy, I thought.  I made mine dairy free for my son, substituting rice milk for the milk and vegan soy butter for the margarine and they taste just like any other cinnamon bun I've had.  I made the frosting as the recipe said to and made a separate one of soy butter, confectioner's sugar, and vanilla for my son.  The cream cheese frosting was good, but I might try to find one that I like a little more (I thought the cream cheese taste was a little strong).  Overall though, I'll make this one again and again!  Thank you so much!

Ok, I made these for Easter and they were insanely good and looked a hot mess.  This was my fault though because I went by someone else's review and doubled the icing recipe.  BIG MISTAKE!  The rolls were swimming and I had to scrap most of the excess icing off.  They were still a hit because they are just too darn yummy.  I don't have a bread machine so I followed another reviewer's directions on how to make the dough without it and it turned out wonderful.  Next time I'll use the amount of icing the recipe calls for.  What a great recipe, thanks!!!!

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it many times but have made the following changes: 1. I used 1/2 a cup of water and 1/2 c of milk, instead of the full 1 cup of milk. I use the water at 110 degrees and add the yeast to it with a big pinch of sugar, mix the yeast in thoroughly, NO chunks, and let it froth. I heat the milk as directed in the recipe. I find that doing this, the dough rises better.  2. I NEVER use the full amount of flour the recipe calls for. I gradually add the flour until the dough creates a ball, but still sticks slightly to your fingers.  Knead until elastic.  3. I let the dough proof until it truly is DOUBLED.  This may vary in time depending on where you live/ temp.  4. I create a caramel glaze to go on the bottom of the baking pan, in place of having a frosting (which can be too rich). You simply melt 1/2 c butter. Whisk in 1/2 c brown sugar until fully combined. Pour into baking pan and spread evenly. Roll up the dough with the softened butter and cinn. sugar mixture, and cut into 12 pieces.  Space evenly on pan.  Let proof until they just start touching. Bake. I suggest placing foil on the bottom of your oven; the glaze can make a mess.  5.  Once golden, remove the cinn rolls from oven, and invert the rolls onto another surface to let the glaze ooze back into the rolls.  **always warm before eating, its better this way!

Used the bread machine made things alot easier. And these clone cinnabons were really good. Made one batch and our family ate them up pretty fast. The second batch I took in to work and they were all gone before our first break everybody loved them and they want more.

This is one of the BEST recipes for cinnamon rolls I've made. I've never written a review but I had to make an exception for this recipe. Thanks to the first 2 reviews listed I followed the suggestions. I made the dough in my mixer. The only thing I will do different next time is decrease the amount of sugar in the dough to 1/3 C. I live in the SW so I'll chill my filling a bit and cut using non-flavored floss a little faster next time to avoid the filling from seeping out. My husband loved it. Will definitely make again. Thanks marsha!

fabulous cinnamon roll recipe that everyone will rave about. I didn't use bread flour and they still turned out perfectly. Mine were a little too doughy in the center so next time I will bake them a couple more minutes. I was afraid they would be overdone because they were very golden on top, but they weren't.  I also flipped them over onto a serving tray and then iced them. This is definitely the way to go. The golden tops (now bottoms) soften by being on the bottom and the gooey bottoms (now tops) mix with the frosting and create deliciousness!

Very sweet and moist.  I recommend using about 1T less butter in the bread batter and a full teaspoon of vanilla in the frosting (this will make the frosting a bit more flavorful and smooth.  When making the brown sugar filling the amounts in this recipe created way more filling than necessary and caused much of the filling to run out of the cinnabon, so I would suggest easing up on the butter by a tablespoon or two in order to keep it a bit thicker but still just as sweet and rich.

i make these all the time, i roll them out as thin as possible, which makes them more tender, and more like cinnabon. i also put them in the fridge overnight, then removing them about 1 hour before putting them in the oven. perfect everytime!

Wish I could give it 10 stars!  Could never find a cinnamon roll recipe that didn't taste like bread.  This one is great and taste like a genuine cinnamon roll.  A keeper in our house!

Realllly goood. Halved the recipe and worked fine. I also flipped the pan over straight out of the oven as another recommended and yes, it makes the yummy sugar goo run alll over the rolls (that's a good thing) :)

I tried this recipe because I have been looking for a good recipe for cinnamon rolls.  Every recipe I tried before this the bread was always off either by being to hard or not tasting good.  The bread for this recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  It is soft and has a good flavor.  However I did change the filling to 1/2 cup of butter and 3 tsp of cinnamon.  When they are done baking turn the pan upside down on a jelly roll pan for about five minutes and the filling stays put.  They got a lot of rave reviews from all the people I baked them for.  Thank you.  hvirch.

Loved them! I added pecans and extra butter,sugar and cinnamon to the filling and they ended up fluffy,gooey and Perfect!!! I did make the dough by hand but I'm sure breadmaker results would have been the same.Thanks for the recipe,I'm never making cinnamon rolls any other way.

Quite tasty; not as gooey as a "cinnabon" (even by inverting & adding more brown sugar & cinn to filling) but ok by me:)  For more "goo," probably just need to add more butter, brown sugar, & cinnamon to filling.  Let rise in warm oven then just turn oven on to bake while they're in there to ease things up a bit.  To get eggs fresh from the fridge to room temp quick, just make the milk a bit warmer than needed- just be sure not too hot to kill yeast!  Used butter in lieu of marg.  Yum!

Delicious!  This will replace my old cinnamon roll recipe, and it was a great one, too!  I live at 6,000 feet and they turned out great with no changes for the altitude.  I loved how easy it was to shape the cinnamon covered dough into the roll; it had the perfect consistency.  I made my rolls in the evening and refrigerated them overnight for rising and baking in the morning.

One Word: Amazing!!!  Both my boyfriend & I LOVED these...everything was PERFECT!!  The only change I made was: I used 3 1/2 C. Bread Flour, 1 C. All-Purpose Flour...and that was only because I only had 3 & 1/2 C Bread Flour.  Also, it didn't specify, but I used Golden Brown Sugar.  These taste just like Cinnabon's Cinnamon Rolls.  Thank You for the Dead-On Recipe!!

Woohoo! These are sooo yummy.  The recipe is very forgiving, since I forgot to put the salt in and they took an hour and a half to rise (all my fault) but they still came out fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't think this really tastes like Cinnabon...but it is still very good.  I sometimes cut the recipe in half, but other than that I make it just as is.  Thanks for the recipe!

these were very good. I didnt use a bread machine for my dough though. Everyone else thought they were delicious. When I sliced them though I did slice them into 16 instead of 12. They were quite large still so I cannot imagine how big they would have been if I would have only made 12. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Made these 5 or 6 times already and they are AWESOME!!!!! Thanks for this super easy and show-stopping recipie. I used the breadmaker and make an extra batch of icing as someone else suggested. I freeze the icing and use it for the next batch of buns. The texture is different, but just needs a drop or two of milk and to be wipped up, then it's as good as new. The buns have yet made it to the freezer - they're gone too fast! I have made the buns all up the night before and then cooked them the next day. They take a little longer to rise, but have worked out just as good. HINT: Don't over cook them or they won't taste like Cinnabon buns...but still are very good anyway! LOVE THIS RECIPIE!!

These are simple to make, look SUPERB, and taste AMAZING! I would say the best cinnamon buns I've ever had (I've had lots of different kinds), and the family LOVED them.     Notes: I did not use a bread machine, but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and everything seemed perfect. I only did one times the icing recipe; any more would have been too much.

These turned out very good.  I did not use my bread maker..used my stand mixer.  I proofed my yeast with the warm milk and 1 tsb of the sugar. I put all the ingrdients in the mixer except the flour and mixed with flat paddle.  I added the flour until a dough started to form and then put my dough hook on and mixed at 2 for 2 minutes.  I did not use "BREAD" flour, I used "ALL PURPOSE" flour and added 3 TBS of vital wheat glutin.  This turned out very good!  I will make again but double the recipe as it is time consuming.

Delicious!  I mixed and kneaded with my stand mixer.  And then I used the tip of laying buttered parchment paper in the bottom of the baking dish, and turning the dish upside down when still warm to let the good stuff run back into the rolls.  What a treat!

AWESOME. Only thing I did differently was to add flax seed to the cinnamon swirl mixture. Next time might try half whole wheat flour just to see if a difference is noticeable.

My son-in-law asks for these every time they visit. This is a great recipe, easy to make and excellent tasting. He says they taste just as good as a cinnabon.

OMG... THESE WERE FANTASTIC!!! It deserves 10 stars!!! And I'm a HUGE Cinnabon fan! My husband was scrapping his plate to get every last bit of the cinnamon goo, he doesn't even do that w/ cinnabons. I used the exact ingredients the recipe called for but I didn't use a bread machine. It was easy to make using my kitchenaid mixer. I added the sugar and milk and stirred to dissolve than added the yeast and let proof, about 5 mins. Than I added the melted butter and eggs and mixed while adding the salt and flour, one cup at a time, till well blended. Than I used my Kitchenaid dough hook and mixed on low for about 7 mins to knead. I put the dough in a bowl, covered w/ a damp cloth and I put that in my oven (oven was off) and I let that rise for about an hour. I also took the suggestion to mixed the butter, cinnamon and sugar before adding to the rolled out dough, I just pressed the mixture into the dough before I rolled it up. I used dental floss to cut the rolls which worked PERFECTLY! I drive 45 mins to get my Cinnabon "fix" a couple of times a year and I actually think I like these better. The dough has a nice sweetness to it, cinnamon mixture was perfectly gooey and tasted devine, the cream cheese frosting I could of eaten all by itself and it wasn't as filling/heavy as a cinnabon is. My kids and husband told me that I HAVE to make these more often! These are Definatly my new favorite dessert! THANKS!!!

YUMMY, I wish I could eat these.  I can't do cinnamon since a gall bladder removal.  I may make these this weedend for my DH though.  He'll really enjoy.  As an added punch however, if you are near a Cinnabon at any time, they do sell their Turkish cinnamon that they use.  The flavor is phenomenal.  Much more punch and flavor than even some of the best at the grocery store!

I could eat a bowl of this frosting alone! I love these, they are easy to make, and great to eat. My only complaint is that the cooking time is still up in the air. They look to be too brown on top and are still gooey (in a bad way) on the bottom. I have yet to perfect temp/time.

This recipe is truly deserving of all the praises it has received. I baked the rolls at 350F for 25 minutes (as other suggested) and my husband said "You did good, dear." Pretty strong praise for him! I can't say whether they tasted identical to the real thing (I haven't had a real one for years), but they were way more than good enough for me. Thanks for posting this awesome recipe.

The dough was WONDERFUL! The differences we made...doubled the Brown Sugar, Cinnamon and butter to paste on. I would also suggest cutting them 3-4 inches large. This would make for the bigger rolls. We did ours at 2 inches and they weren't as big as we would have liked.  The reason we have 4 stars is because the icing tastes nothing line Cinnabon. It's ok though.

This recipe is fabulous! I made dough by hand, other than that followed recipe exactly. This is the best cinnamon roll I have ever had! I did make 15 rolls from the dough.....really big rolls! I used two pans, placing 9 in one and 6 in the other to give the rolls room to rise and spread. Worked perfectly. Also I Iet the rolls rise overnight in my refridgerator and baked in the morning. I recommend letting the rolls sit for about 5 minutes before inverting the pan. Let rolls sit for another 5 minutes before putting the pan right side up. Then frost. I used disposable pans so I didn't have any clean-up. Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe. This is my go-to recipe from now on!

Made it exactly but as another reviewer suggested, I flipped the pan over onto parchment paper as soon as it came out of the oven. The cinnamon sauce stayed on the buns very well once it cooled.

My cinnamon rolls came out perfect! I also used this recipe for the ooey-gooey cinnamon buns - just took the topping from that recipe and used the "bun" from this recipe - another winning combo if you're looking for something more like a sticky bun.

WOW! The best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! This is one of the most requested things I bake. These come out perfect every time. I often refrigerate these overnight after slicing the rolls. Just set them out for an hour or so before baking them.

These were awesome. and they really did taste like a cinnabon. i made 2 batches because the first batch i used yeast that expired a year ago, and that didnt work. so the second batch i used non expired yeast and they turned out great! I will say that when your supposed to let them rise after you cut them, mine didnt really change in size, but when they were baking, they grew. Overall, I would definetly recomend this recipe.

I cut the recipe in half and only made 6 rolls because I didn't have enough flour on hand, but really wanted to try them.  They turned out perfect!  Love this recipe, it is a keeper.

These were totally amazing! My family LOVED these cinnamon rolls. I too flipped the pan upside down to re-coat the rolls. my girlfriend gave me the heads up on that! WOW. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED by these tasty breakfast treats!

Very good and almost exactly likely a cinnabon. It does take a little time but they are still very good the second and third days- just toss in the microwave to heat a bit.

I have made this recipe many times now & it never fails me. I get proofed dough from my local grocery store so it makes these super simple. I've found if you melt the butter and use it to mix the brown sugar and cinnamon in a paste then spread on dough your mix will stay in place. Also take the time to make your own frosting. The few minutes it takes to mix as directed here is WAY better than buying from the tub.  My husband says these are not a clone of cinnabon they are better!

Holy cow these are AMAZING! I woke up this Christmas morning thinking I MUST make something special for breakfast! These were hands down the perfect something special! I admit since I have no bread machine I always have an automatic alteration for most bread type recipes so I did these refrigerator style. I also since it was spur of the moment did not have any cream cheese so I used sour cream instead. I also added a few chopped walnuts to some of them. VERY YUMMY! I will make these again and again!

DO NOT CHANGE A THING, except maybe bake it for 20 minutes. 15 was not enough, in my oven.  You do not need to invert the pan over the finished product, you do not need to double the icing--heavens, I had more than enough as it was!--you do not need to adjust or decrease any ingredients.  This is THE perfect recipe, as it stands.

Followed suggestions and flipped them out as soon as they were done (which took about 10 minutes longer as I only had 9 big ones, not 12)...forgot the vanilla and these are GREAT!!!  My kids LOVE them!!

These rolls are AWESOME.  I did lower the baking temp to 350 as suggested by other reviewers, the only other change I made is to use 4 oz of cream cheese in the frosting instead of 3 oz.  I took them to the office and they were gone in 15 min!

Made these last Saturday for my family.  My dad love cinnamon rolls and he said these were the best he'd ever tasted; even better than cinnabon (he thinks theirs are a bit too sweet).  I added a little extra butter on the top of the rolls when I got them in the pan and I also used all purpose flour instead of the bread flour.  I think I ended up using betweem 5 1/4 to 5 1/2 c flour total.  Came out fantastically...Don't forget to flip the pan!!!  I almost didn't and then realized that i could just use a cookie sheet to flip them on to and did it.  Everyone was out and about wanting one.  Tasted fantastic (and the frosting tastes just like the stuff from cinnabon) and even gave the house a nice smell; if only for a night.  Considering making these once a month or on special occasions.  Loved them and thanks for the recipe.

I followed the directions exactly, and they came out perfect! My fiance, who LOVES Cinnabon, didn't believe I had made them from scratch! Needless to say, I won't be buying the canned rolls anymore...thanks for sharing the recipe!

I have tried many cinnamon roll recipes and nothing has compared to this one.The   only change i made was..using sweet cream butter rather than regular. I think it tastes a little better.

AMAZING!!! I don't have a bread machine, so I followed others' notes for making without one. I kneaded by hand after using the mixer for a minute or so. Simply tastes and smells delicious and so like Cinnabon. Thanks so much for this!

I'm making these for probably the 20th time for Thanksgiving! One tip - pinch dough together a bit before you slice - I'm not a baker, so I had to figure that out =P  Thank you sooooo much - I miss Cinnabon and we're a military family and dont have one here :( This recipe makes up for it BIG time.

I haven't made this yet but I do have another recipe for cinnabon rolls that is killer.  I think what makes it so good is the icing. Just add 1/8 tsp of lemon extract to this recipe and you will see!

Very good, but I was not amazed. Huge mistake to use wax paper on the bottom, even floured it baked into the cinnamon rolls and I could not peel it off the bottoms. I'll try it again, though as I want it to turn out better. I may try with wheat flour next time to feel healthier about eating them!

These are perfect cinnamin rolls. so easy with the bread machine too. I poked toothpicks through the individual rolls before placing them on the baking sheet to rise then bake. This prevents them from unrolling as they rise and bake. Also, the frosting recipe needs to be doubled. It only frosted 10 out of the 12 rolls.

There's so much to love about this recipe.  It's a lot of work, though.  And it makes a lot of bad-for-you food, so I guess that's not to love.  But I'm staring at the leftovers and waiting for my tummy not to feel full so I can have more.  So good.

I made these awhile ago and they went over very well!  Considering I had always made Paula Deen's recipe I think that is saying alot!  The icing is delicious!  The teenagers at church just LOVED them!  A saver for sure!!

I'd give these 4 and a half stars. They're a bit dense but maybe because the dough didn't rise till double.  I followed it exactly and they tasted GREAT! yum yum. I'll make them again one day.

Wow!  These are amazing.  My husband is a big Cinnabon fan and he thought these were fabulous.  I didn't change a thing on the recipe.  Everything worked.  I'm glad I didn't get rid of my old breadmaker - it will definitely get more use now.

wow! this was really good! But i changed a lot to make it healthier. First i only spread about a tablespoon of butter on top of the dough before putting the filling in. And i finely chopped some dried cranberries for the filling and used about 1/2 cup to 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar for the filling, and ommited the frosting, and it cae out DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

Oh my goodness, I can't believe I just made cinnamon rolls that were amazing!!! The dough was a pain in the neck to roll out but soooo worth it. They were soft, and sticky, and just plain wonderful. Highly recommend this recipe!

WOW these are incredible.  Its been so long since I've had a real Cinnabon, but from what I remember, these are right on!!  I made 16 of them yesterday (because I rolled the dough out to be a little long) and today I ate the last one (which was only my second one total!).  Everyone loved them.  I didn't have bread flour so I took a risk and used all-purpose against my bread machines warning, and they were still fantastic!  If I could give this recipe more stars, I definitely would!

YUMMY!!! My family loves these, we live in AK and not a cinnabon anywehere around us. I have made 2 times now both times I followed someones review to make the night ahead all the way to the point of them of putting them in the pan to rise and than I cover them with plastic wrap and put in the fridge overnight. In the morning I put them in straight from the fridge to the oven THAN start preheating and baking. Mine finish in about 20 minutes though, I keep a eye on them. I double the frosting cause I love frostng. Double makes to much but I save it for next time in the freezer. As soon as the come out of the over I turn over to get them out of the pan and turn over again so they are on their bottoms. That way they get out of the pan and still have their filling. Loved them! Will ALWAYS make these as my cinnamon rolls!

Really good the first time around making them.  My husband loved them!  I think I will try a bit less flour and maybe more yeast to get a little more light and fluffy, but overall a 5 star recipe as is!

I actually modified the recipe to make a cinnabon/cinnamelt hybrid.  Instead of making rolls, I took pieces of the bread, rolled it in the cinnamon and sugar and put numerous pieces into a muffin cup so they were like pull aparts.  I used the exact same frosting recipe with no modifications.  My family loved them!

These were wonderful, thanks to whoever posted how to make them without a bread machine! Next time I might bake them just a little longer to make them a just a little crisper on the outside so the frosting doesn't make them soggy so soon.

Great recipe.  I make these most Sundays and take to neighbors and friends.  I double the recipe for frosting.  I use three round cake pans so they cook completely in the middle and each one gets more frosting on it!  It's a keeper!

I was a Cinnabon junkie when I lived in Virginia and was disappointed I didn't find the franchise as plentiful in GA.  Well, I have gotten my fix with this version of the Cinnabon.  It is WONDERFUL, FABULOUS, DELICIOUS AND SINFULLY SCRUMPTIOUS.  This recipe is spot on.  I have made two batches in the last two days and will have to make more this weekend.  Definitely a front-of-the-recipe box recipe.

:-) turned out very well and pretty too.  I don't have a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast in the milk, added all ingredients and enough flour to get it to the right consistency (it took a little more than recipe called for), kneaded, and went with the recipe as written from there.

I made these cinnamon rolls last night, and despite operator error these turned out great!  I did tweak it by using only 4 cups flour (2 c. bread flour & 2 c. ap flour), and reduced the sugar in the dough to 1/4 c.  My hubby does not like cream cheese frosting so used a basic powedered sugar icing which I added a tablespoon or so of maple syrup.  Baked 6 and froze 6.  Turned out awesome-great with a cup of coffee for a mid-morning snack.

My first attempt at cinnamon rolls...they were great. I did not add all of the confectioner's sugar (only 1/2 c) but it was a delicious drizzle to a fabulously huge cinnamon roll! No way you can eat more than one...even if you want to.

Wonderful rolls.  We will cut back a tad on the brown sugar because it was too sweet for us.  We did flip the rolls after they came out of the oven which was an excellent suggestion. We also did all butter instead of margarine.  I made chili from "Mom's Chili" recipe on here and having the rolls as dessert just made a wonderful meal.

Best cinnamon buns I ever had, even thought I really forgot one of the main ingredients, but guess what, it didn't matter, less calories, I actually forgot the white sugar in the dough,and everyone said there were the best they ever eaten too, I don't think I will ever put the sugar, they were just right.

I've made this a couple of times now, and it always gets many compliments, even though I've never made it with the frosting. I found that the rolls were too sweet for my liking, so I cut down the sugar by about 1/4 cup and added 3 tbsp of cinnamon powder instead of 2.5.  Do remember that it is important you roll the dough tightly to prevent the filling from leaking out as much as possible. Also, a nice idea for beautifully shaped rolls is to let them rise in a muffin cup, so it rises nice and round. Enjoy!

Amazing!  I substituted 2 cups AP flour and 2.5 cups whole wheat flour for the bread flour.  I used a sifter to evenly coat the buttered dough surface, and they came out great!  I'm not usually good with anything involving yeast, but this was a success the first time around (I had a bread machine to help).  For the second rising after the buns are assembled, I heated the oven to 200*F and turned it off as per another reviewer's suggestion.  True to its title, this recipe *is* a clone!  I live alone and can't eat 12 by myself, but there will be some very lucky clerks at the 24/7 convenience store tonight!

These are really good and really easy to make. I used whole wheat flour and let them sit/rise overnight so I could pop them in the oven and have hot gooey rolls for breakfast. Worked perfectly!

Amazing cinnamon rolls. I've made them three times now and each time I make them I get rave reviews. Delicious cinnamon flavor. It's hard to decide which is better the roll or the frosting.

These are the best things I've ever baked! My cousins just ADORED them, they kept asking me to make them. By the end of the summer, they were BEGGING me for the recipe ;) The only bad thing is, that it seemed to take me up to 3 hrs to make them, from starting them to finishing them(after they bake). I found that in the icing, it was best to use icing sugar instead of normal sugar because it dissolves and blends nicely so you do not feel the sugar. Also, maybe reduce some of the amount because some people do not like it as sweet (My parents). AWESOME!

This was pretty good. I would add more cinnamon for my taste but everyone seemed to like it. I didn't have to cook it as long as the recipe said. Ten minutes was all I needed.

With or without frosting, these cinnamon rolls are tremendous. They never last long anywhere I take them. I add raisins to the filling.

I have made 3 batches in one week.  People love them and give them an A+++.  I have found while baking they bake better on the bottom shelf in oven and it is better to bake them in a deep dish type baker and not a sheet pan (they brown more on a sheet pan), but re-heated in microwave they are still tasty.

These came out perfect! I didn't have the cream cheese on hand as called for in the icing recipe so used about 1/4 cup extra butter and some heavy cream to thin it with. Oh yes my oven must run hot so I baked the cinnabons for a shorter time. YUMO... Thank you for posting

I had to make these two times. the first batch weren't as good as the second. The second batch I added 1 more tsp. of yeast as it didn't seem to proof well enough with just 2 1/2. I didn't use a bread machine; just regular flour and yeast. I proofed it and then put the dough in a warming dwarer at 100 degrees to proof. The dough rose beautifully! I also added a small box of vanilla pudding (that's the secret to my grandma's cinnamon rolls which I have made for years.  I ended up putting 1/2 T. more cinnamon in the filling mix as well for a more cinnamon than sugar flavor.  Also, added 1/2 c. powdered sugar to the icing to make it a little sweeter.  This isn't a low-fat recipe but let's be honest, if you are looking for low fat, cinnamon rolls aren't the recipe to make!! :)

I was suprised at how much I did not like these.  They had such good ratings.  The cinnamon mixture was wayyy to much!  No one in my house liked these and my husband eats about everything.  They just weren't soft like I expected them to be.

Superb cinnamon rolls!  Very close to Cinnabon in my opinion.  My husband and I loved them.  This is will be a new tradition in my house.  Like many others, I don't have a bread machine and made them by hand.  For the filling, I mixed the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter together before spreading the mixture on to the dough.  I had no problems with it dripping out of the rolls after baking and did not need to invert the pan when done.  Thank you, Marsha, for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe.  I'd never used a yeast bread recipe before.  The instructions were great. I didn't use the bread machine, instead I took direction from one review and kneaded it by hand and after mixing it in my KitchenAid.  The only thing I might do different next time is more brown sugar and cinnamon!  Awesome!

These were awesome. Loved the cinnamon. I blended the butter with the cinnamon for the filling and didn't have any problem with the filling running out.

THE BEST CINNAMON ROLL EVER. Take note of the comments for suggestions on making this even better. I've made this several times without a bread maker - perfect every time!

This recipe is amazing!  My family was eating them as fast as they came out of the oven!  I added some more cinnamon to the recipe because we love the taste.  Otherwise I changed very little.  I also made the dough without a machine.  I mixed all the ingredients then slowly added the flour.  I kneaded the dough for about 8-10 minutes, then let it rise for an hour.  Also, after they have cooked, if you take a spatula and flip the cinnabon off the pan, you can keep much of the brown sugar mixture on the cinnabon and off the cookie sheet.

Amazing!  I am really inexperienced with bread making so I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfectly.  I kept the icing seperate and iced each roll when it was time to serve them.

I made this without a bread machine.  I added a regular packet of yeast to the milk and let it sit for about 10 minutes before mixing the first batch of ingredients.  I let the dough sit in the microwave oven for about 3.5 hours to double in size.  I mixed the butter, brown sugar, and cinnamin together like other reviewers.  Next time I'll do butter alone then sprinkle the topping.  The bread kept pulling out of shape while trying to spead evenly.  Doubled in size withing 30 minutes and was slightly under baked in 15 minutes but I use a convection oven.  At first I thought their wasn't enough frosting but it was plenty when eating it!  My husband thought it was too much.  We loved the flavor though, I ate two and felt a little sick afterwards.  I'll freeze extras and hopefully they'll still taste good.

These rolls are truly sinful! My father and step mother were over and as they were eating their second helping finally managed to get three whole words out of their mouths " These are great! " And they are. Thank you so much for this recipe.

These are delicious. My sister and I made them with just a bit less cinnamon and a handful of chopped pecans; it came out so good that they were all gone before we could even put the frosting on them.

I've made this twice. Had a hard time getting the dough to rise the first time, and they were tough. The second time I tried a different yeast and my dough rose well however they still did not rise more at all in the oven and I still found them tough and unappealing. I am probably doing something wrong, but after two attempts I'm not going back for more trouble. I'll try another recipe next time.

These are sooooooooo worth the 82 carbs. I've made this recipe dozens of times - without a bread machine - and it turns out great everytime. Even if you are a beginner at bread making, this recipe seems to be very forgiving. YUMMY!

This was so much easier than I thought! I wish I had made it long ago! I did take the advice of others and mixed the filling together before spreading it on and I do think this worked well. It was easy to get on and I didn't have oozing out problems at all. I did double the cream cheese frosting - this was probably a bit too much, but if you like frosting, you'll probably want a bit more than the recipe calls for.

Thank you very much for the recipe.  These are really good! I cut mine a lot smaller, like about 1/2 the size of what the recipe calls for, because they are so high calorie. They're kind of a pain to make, too time consuming, but totally worth the effort!!

I made this last night following the advice of other reviewers.  I did not have bread flour, so I used 1.5 cups wheat flour and 3 cups plain flour.  I do not have a bread maker. I warmed the oven to 200 degrees, turned it off, and let the dough sit in it.  Make sure you space them apart on the baking pan.  mine were spread about 2 inches apart and touched after they had risen the second time.  They turned out HUGE! My teenage brother who eats everything in sight was only able to eat one of them.  I will definitely make these again.

WOW!!!  These rolls were surprisingly easy (with a bread machine) and so divine.  My only problem was rolling out the dough; it kept shrinking- which happens to me all the time.  Like other reviewers suggested, I softened the butter to mix with the cinnamon and brown sugar for easier spreading.  I baked them in a glass pan and redrizzled their juices on them.  I used 4 oz of cream cheese because I love the tang of it.  I baked at 350 for over 20 minutes.  Will definitely make again, these are so simple in the morning if you let them rise shaped in their covered pans.  I just have to make sure there are enough people around to eat them!  And to tumbleweedbarngirl- bread flour is fairly easy to find.  It is not from a specialty store and should be available at your local Walmart.  I wouldnt use all purpose, bread flour gives it an elasticity, etc more like bread.

These were amazing! My whole family thought they tasted even better than Cinnabon. These are actually quite flexible. I accidentally peeled too many apples for an apple pie and decided to put those in here. The result? To die for gooey cinnamony apple pie in a cinnamon roll. Another way to add your own flare is to (once done, or the next day after it is baked) you can actually brush the bottom of the roll with melted butter and dip it in cinnamon sugar, microwave it, toast it a bit, and you get the perfect sticky buns. Just a thought. These were amazing though!

I have made this many times now and each time comes out great whether I make them small, medium or large.  Everybody loves them.  Only thing I change is mix the soft butter with brown sugar and cinnamon and spread on dough with my fingers.  A bit messy but so much easier. Yummy

This is the first time I bake a cinnamon roll and my children loved them.  I prepare them at night and put it in the frigde (as I read in some other reviews) I must confess I had some doubts, but everything turned out ok.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.

For all that this was hyped up to be, I was rather disappointed. I compared this recipe to the one in my bread machine booklet and the recipes were almost identical. However, these were really good and I will definetely make them again, but I was just disappointed that they were so hyped up and it was really nothing overly extraordinary!

Its was good but not great. The dough had no flavor. I tried the other recipe on this site where you add the vanilla pudding to the dough. Now that was great!! Of course, along with nuts.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  It's always a favorite and is often requested when I'm making something for an event like a baby shower.  It is exactly like it's name - an exact taste replica of a cinnabon cinnamon bun.  I love making these and my family loves to eat them.

This recipe was ridicously good BUT I had to make this recipe twice. The first time I baked the rolls at 400 F and after 5 minutes they were completely burnt (like black and starting to smoke, it was REALLY bad). So the 2nd time, I baked them at 350 F for 20 minutes and they were perfect. I would recommend this recipe to everyone!

Simply delicious! The only thing I found was the buns were really heavy and dense making them by hand so I only used 4 cups of flour (used all purpose unbleached flour) and they came out lighter. That was my only change, however either way, the taste was heavenly!!! Cinnabon has nothing on these homemade yummies! Thanks Marsha! **UPDATE** I now make these in my bread maker still using the changes I made earlier and they come out sooooo light and fluffy!! Simply divine!!

I was scared to make these because I had simply never tried before. I did use my bread machine. Dough was a wonderful soft smooth mixture. I followed the recipe exactly. No problems. Once the rolls were sliced and placed in the pan for the last 30 minute rise, they didnt double like the recipe suggested. So, I left them for about 45 minutes and then couldnt wait any longer to put them in the oven. They baked up wonderful. Taste wonderful. Great recipe. Fun to make if you have some time on a weekend.

Didn't get to try any but was told they were delicious.  Followed Andy Tami's advice for non-bread machine method. Only used about 1/3 of cream cheese mix as we're trying to cut down on sugar.  Will definitely make it again; it's easy crowd pleaser!

I substituted buttermilk for regular milk for more flavor. I agree with the comments that a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes works better. 4 oz of cream cheese is better than 3, if you like cream cheese frosting.

I actually like these better than the real Cinnabon cinnamon rolls.  Honestly, this is the absolute best cinnamon roll I have ever had.  Be careful not to let the dough rise too much, if you do, you'll need more cinnamon to cover all that bread!

OMG!!! AWESOME!!! I was so scared to try this recipe at first, due to my lack of expierence with yeast. I am SO GLAD I decided to go for it....YUMMY! I followed the recipe exactly, but baked mine on a cookie sheet (individually), instead of in a 13x9 pan. The only thing I think next time is that I may halve the icing as there was a good bit left over. I was shocked at how easy these came together. Everyone is raving over them! I will definately be making these again. Thanks for posting :)

The recipe was easy, but not quite as fluffy as I expected it to be. The rolls turned out a little on the dense side, although they had a great flavor. Instead of the traditional vanilla glaze, I melted milk chocolate chips mixed with hazelnut coffee creamer and drizzled over. That was the best part.

I let these sit in the fridge overnite and then cooked them at 400 like someone else suggested.  However, they were not completly done inside.  If I had let them come to room temp. FIRST then it would have worked, but my kids were too hungry to wait!  I am putting them back in the oven(covered)and will see how this turns out since I already have the frosting on them! :(  Also, the last time I made these they seemed a bit dry in the middle.  So I melted the butter that goes in the filling and this seemed to help for some reason.  One more thing:  I didn't have all bread flour so I used just about half and half and the dough was still great!

Used this recipe exactly for a dutch oven cook-off and won first place with it.  Everyone raves about these Cinnamon rolls.  When I first made them, my husband was startled at how much cinnamon and brown sugar went on them - thought it was going to be too much.  One taste and he said, "Don't change a thing."

I cooked a breakfast casserole  at the same time with the cinnamon buns so they didn't get quite done.  I stuck them back in the oven for a few more minutes and they were really good.  I will definitely make these again!!!  Thanks!

This is a very dangerous recipe to prepare! You will find yourself doing it over and over again. Never ever give one to a friend as you will be inundated with requests for these cinnamon rolls. You have been warned.

My husband and co-workers raved about these and my husband wants me to make another batch already. I skipped the butter in the frosting and reduced the amount of powdered sugar and was able to cut back a little on the filling. I made 20 good sized rolls, if you are worried about the calories that will help. I will try adding raisins and pecans to the filling on my next batch. I loved these because they are super soft throughout and my old recipe was always tough on top. Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

EXCELLENT This takes some time but well worth the effort. I just wish I could figure out a way to keep more of the cinnamon mixture in the bun. It seems to ooze out during baking. Next time I will turn them over right after getting them out of the oven. Will be making again and again.

OOOooo!  These are so good.  I also made mine the night before, refrigerated them overnight, then pulled them out while the oven pre-heated.  Delicious!

I made these cinnamon rolls for Easter brunch and everyone loved them! i didnt get a chance to try one so later on that night i took one out of the refrigerator and put it into the microwave to warm it up a bit and it still tasted like it came right out of the oven! I've never made anything with yeast before but this was so easy to do and people have been asking me when im going to be making them again which will be very very soon. This recipe is a must try!

For my first time making these, there were really good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did not use a bread machine (don't have one) followed the direction from other reviewers helpful hints (Thank you).  The dough was really good and the frosting was really good.  The only thing was that my cinnamon filling was not real gooey, but grainy.  Don know what I did wrong, maybe more butter?  I always feard making these, well no more fear, they were easy to make.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These are WONDERFUL!  I did what others suggested and turned them out and left them upside-down for a few mins so that the filling is even, and the smell that wafts up and hits you when you peel the baking paper off the bottom of them is DIVINE!  I always line pans with baking paper for these sorts of things as well as for cakes and cookies. I also put the frosting into a plastic sauce/ketchup bottle and zig-zag it over the top, it looks better than when I try to do that with a spoon. Even though people around me know I can cook, they are always surprised when they see that I've baked these, and then they taste them...Mmmmmmm.  I haven't made them for a while, but I'm thinking of them and can't come up with the right words to describe how fantastic they are as the thought of them is impairing my ability to access anymore words than I have used to write this review!!  They're sooo good, give them a go.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious! I also fixed the night before and baked at 350 for 25 minutes the next morning( put in cold oven). It was a great time saver. You can also add raisins if you choose, and a dash of nutmeg. Flip them upside down when removing from pan. You get all that ooey- gooey cinnamon. I can't wait to make more!! Thanks!!!

This recipe was so easy to make (thanks to tips in the reviews telling me how to make this by hand). I've never made bread before, and this turned out perfect.   My boyfriend LOVED it, he said it was one of his favorite home made desserts, and I make a lot so that means something.  I used good quality vanilla because I think the vanilla cream cheese frosting was what made these rolls so good. We love our vanilla in my household.

Excellent recipe. I also doubled the dough in the oven at 200 degrees for about 40 minutes and it turned out perfect. This was before rolling them out and putting them in the pan.

Best Cinnamon Roll EVER!  I've made a lot of different recipes and this one is by far the best.  I didn't use a bread machine and used my mixer w/ dough hook for the kneading.  I also did flip the pan upside down for a couple of minutes to let the filling run back into the rolls (great idea, by the way) and then flipped them back over and iced them.  Mmm.. couldn't be better.

I am not good with dough normally and quite intimidated by it but I decided to try this recipe because I am obsessed with cinnabon. They were FABULOUS!!!!! They were also gone in about 60 seconds from my co-workers. I will definitely make these again and again. i will say that the dough took longer to rise than the recipe said but other than that, it was flawless and very easy.

These are excellent and the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had.  I heeded some earlier advice to use a glass 9x13 pan and transfer them to a cooling rack immediately after taking them out of the oven (parchment paper made that really easy).  The only issue I have with the recipe is that the rolls took much longer than half an hour to rise to nearly double size, but the deliciousness was more than enough compensation for the inconvenience.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

AMAZING! Better than Cinnabon! I had never made cinnamon rolls before. I made these last week and they turned out perfect. My husband called me from work and asked if I'd make these  = ) If you love the frosting from Cinnabon like I do, you'll want to make a double recipe of the frosting. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Ridiculously good. Very good recipe - easy to follow. I had had trouble in the past with yeasted doughs, but this came out great. My husband was in heaven. These are super impressive........ don't even look at the calorie count, though!

This was the best ever. Ive been making cinn. rolls for years but w/ the bread recipe my mom gave me. I added some brown sugar to inside. Instead of the frosting my family likes the gooey on the bottom kind,  I butter the pan add 1/4c sugar,some more cinn. then lay rolls in let raise & just before you put it in the oven fill 1/2 to 3/4 way up pan (pour all over top of rolls) heavy cream, they will have to bake a little longer.  YUMMY

The recipe is a great one, and the frosting is especially delicious. the only downside is that once they cool down, they become slightly "spongy"  and not as nicely textured

OMG...these are the bomb!..My husband is not a sweet eater and he would not leave the pan alone...he jokingly told me I am not allowed to make these anymore because he would eat them all!....I rolled it up so that the roll was wide and made 24 smaller ones...they were great and I will definately make them again...and again.

I've made these many times as the recipe was written.  Tried 2 suggestions on yesterday's batch - mixing the butter/sugar/cinnamon ingrediants together before spreading on the dough, and baking at 350 for 30 min instead of 400 degrees.  I have to say, they turned out much better.  The filling was a much more carmelized, and I didn't have trouble with the outside buns getting really dark while the inside ones were barely cooked.  I'm making these changes permanent!  This recipe is also great with raisins added to the dough.

Clone of a RAW Cinnabon perhaps!  15 minutes at 400 degrees is not adequate to bake these.  They were baked on the outside, mostly raw dough on the inside. NO, there is nothing wrong with my oven temp. Unfortunately we realized after frosting that they were severely under cooked.  Tried baking longer but the center would not setup.  They probably would bake better at a lower temp for more time.  Also, they were ultra sweet (too much sugar) and cinnamony (only used 2T.) Frosting is awesome however.  Recipe could be tweaked, but not worth the labor intensive work. Kids say they prefer the Pillsbury kind - say no more.

YUM! These are wonderful. Had several people say they were the best cinnamon roll they have ever eaten. Next time I might turn the oven down to 375 degrees and bake just a little longer. The center ones were a little doughy, but, hey, some people like them that way! These are worth it!

This is well deserving of all five stars.  These are absolutely heavenly!!!!   I don't have a bread machine so I proofed my yeast and kneaded in my stand mixer & by hand.  I put the warm milk in the mixing bowl, dissolved in the yeast packet.  I added about a tablespoon of the 1/4 cup of sugar to the yeast & milk and let that sit for about 10 minutes.  Then I added in the other dough ingredients.    For the filling, I mixed the soft butter, brown sugar & cinnamon all together and I rubbed it on the rolled out dough using my fingers.    I made these the dough the night before & cooked in the morning for breakfast.  Once I rolled the dough & sliced the individual rolls, I placed them in the baking dish, covered with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.  In the morning, I put them in the cold oven, turned the oven to 350 and set the timer for 30 mins.  I took them out & they were perfect.  PERFECT!!!  I made the icing while they were cooking and slathered the icing on the hot rolls and they turned out wonderfully! I will be making these again & again.

I have made this recipe several times it is AMAZING!  I do the dough in a bowl I do not own a Bread Machine.  They are excellent! Everyone raves! I do at night and refrigerate pull out in morning and let rise for 30-40 mins on preheating stove.  The smell of cinnamon wakes everyone up.  Great on weekends for a treat.  These are a must try thanks for recipe!!!

EASY!! Even my youngest son helped! I never made cinnamon buns before (last week was the first time I made bread from scratch), Didn't use a bread machine instead I kneaded the dough for 8 minutes with the kitchen aid mixer.I followed other reviewers advice by letting the dough rise in the oven by turning oven on to 100 degrees and then turning it off,The only other thing I did different was sweeten the icing by using a little more butter,vanilla and confectioners sugar to suit the taste buds of my youngest son,( The cinnamon bun expert). I froze eight of them and put the other four in the refrigerator over night, In the morning I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes.I would definitely recommend this recipe it truly is a clone of a Cinnabon.

This recipe is really awesome!!!!  My family loves it, and as a lover of the cinnabon, I can tell you it is very close to the original.  It is easy to prepare, with limited mess (thanks to the bread machine), and as a busy mom, this makes it even better!

I've been making this recipe for the past couple of years, and everyone I make it for just loves them!    I followed the advice for making without the bread machine, and  it is still a very fast recipe- so easy!!  The tip about flipping them out of the pan and turning them upside down as soon as them come from the oven is key.  That way, all of the  cinnamon mixture stays within the buns, rather than pooling on the bottom.  The best cinnamon rolls  I've ever made!

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls.  I followed the directions for doing w/out a bread machine. I do have one but I thought it would be too slow. I also kneaded using the hook on my kitchen aid. The dough didn't rise as much as I thought it would, and I didn't have the time to let them rise after cutting for the 30 minutes, and they're still huge and delish. I think when I make these again, I might try to add some pecans.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I've  ever made.  My daughter went to Cinnabon the next day and got one of their rolls and said mine tasted just as good if not better!  I also tried the overnight in the fridge and bake them in the morning.  Worked great!  Thanks for the recipe.

These were definitely like the original!  They are VERY sweet!  But VERY good!  I don't have a bread machine, so I made them by hand.  They were very simple and so good.  The frosting made them even better.  I will definitely recommend them to friends!

Can't really say anything that hasn't already been said, but wanted to add my 5 stars. Like other posters had suggested, I mix the sugar, cinnamon and butter together before spreading and rolling,and invert the buns when they come out of the oven to retain the goodness. Just the right amount of cinnamon, I make no changes at all. You really can't top this recipe!!

After making these, I consider myself fortunate enough to not live near some where that they make cinnabons.  My mother in law's recipe for cinnamon rolls was much better than these.  Sorry to be so harsh.  It thought I would try these out to see what the rave was about , but I will stick to the family recipe.

These are absolutely fantastic!  I've never had a Cinnabon cinnamon roll, but I can't imagine they could be better than these.  I frosted the buns with a Cinnabon frosting recipe found elsewhere on the internet and they were out of this world.  Will definitely make again!

I didn't have bread flour, but I did have frozen bread dough. It didn't roll out as big, but I still got 12 rolls out of it. They fit easily in a 8x8 pan, so I know it's not what the recipe wanted. The cinnamon and butter were probably more condensed. Oh well, they taste great!

I think these taste even BETTER (and are probably healthier!) than Cinnabon cinnamon rolls! I substituted wheat bran in place of some of the flour and it was not even noticeable!  I didn't make the icing for them, but they would be better with it.

I made these as a surprise for a Sunday brunch and they were a hit. I made them Saturday evening and put left them overnite in the refrige.  I let them sit out for about 30 minutes the next morning and then baked as normal.  Came out perfect.  Due to food allergies, used white sugar and maple syrup instead of the brown sugar and it worked great.  The frosting is wonderful too. I've been asked if I will make this recipe for a "birthday cake" instead of a traditional cake for the next round of birthday celebrations.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Added much less water. Flip pan over so they don't harden and stick, like the other reviewers said. I also add Allspice, nutmeg, and cardamom.

Very tasty cinnamon roll.  I made these for christmas morning and we were fighting over leftovers.  Ours were a little chewy, which we prefer, but may bother some.  Very good roll.

So good, even thought I lightened the recipe, Used non-fat milk, Splenda Blend sugars and a butter/canola oil spread.  I cheated & used Canned light Cream Cheese Frosting. Still yummy! I also used a mixture of bread/wheat/white flour. Plus I mixed the butter/brown sugar/cinnamon together and just spread the mixture on the dough.

Truly the best I've ever tasted.  I have made this recipe a few times now and my husband can't stop eating them.  Now I make a batch and freeze half right away.  I also took the advise of another review to divide the icing and freeze wrapped in small portions.  Makes it easy when you are re heating one at a time.  This way if you want more icing you always have.  I mixed my dough in the breadmaker, when done I remove and let rise, then roll out and follow the rest of the recipe.  Once they are cut and lined up in the pan let double in size before putting in oven.  I put in oven at 350 for just about 30 mins.  They come out much better (not guey in the center) but light fluffy and oozing with the melting of cinnamon and brown sugar. I let sit for a few minutes then spread on the icing and let it melt over.  The icing recipe is enough to lightly spread and save some for freezing. These are better then CINNABON bar far! Thanks for a great recipe!

These have been made in my household about 6 times since I found the recipe around Thanksgiving. My neighbor wants some most every time I make these and is so amazed they taste just like Cinnabon rolls. Very good recipe from beginning to end.

I made these for Valentines Day breakfast!  Yummy!!  I took advice from another reviewer and made these the night before and put them in the greased pyrex dish in the fridge.  Took them out in the morning and popped them in the oven.  I also mixed the butter, brownsugar and cinnamon together it was much easier to spread on the dough- I added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts which were excellent- my husband and son loved them!  They do need to be cooked for more than 15 mintues more like 20-25 mins.They started to get brown quickly so I tented them with foil to keep them a golden brown and from getting too dark!  I will definately make these again- fun to make with my son who is 3 years old!!

OK, not a Cinnabon, but definitely one of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten! As per another reviewer, I turned the pan upside down and let all the gooey sweetness drip back over the buns.  The cream cheese frosting seemed a bit like gilding the lily, however, next time I'll replace it with milk

How can i possibly say anything more about this fantastic recipe? I followed another reviewers suggestion to cook on a pizza stone and it worked great. The bottom stayed soft and light. Just leave space between each one on the stone to allow for the second rising. The twelve rolls covered the entire stone when they were done rising. I was afraid that some of the cinnamon mixture may drip off the stone while baking so i covered the lower oven rack with tin foil and it did drip but just barely. I also mixed the butter in with the cinnamon/sugar as others did but next time i won't because i found it difficult to spread. It kind of clumped. I have never had a cinnabon but these are sooooo good!

Wow.  Absolutely worth the work.  Didn't change a thing to the recipe, but did do as another reviewer suggested and after rolling the dough and cutting into individual rolls, left covered in the refrigerator overnight and baked in the morning - put in cold oven baked at 375 -I started with 20 min, but ended up baking about 30/35 min.. don't know the exact time.  YUM!  Will be making again.  The Title of the recipe holds true!

These were really good.  The only thing I would do differently is cut some of the brown sugar.  Will be making theese again even though they took me 4 hours (no bread machine) to make.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

M.M.M. Good! I have made this so many times since I found it on this site. I do have to say one minor alteration oh maybe two. I roll it out to 24 inches and make two pans and use 1/2 the frosting and use more cream cheese than powdered sugar. Making them smaller make those who are on diets at work go for one!! I love it!!! Yum Yum give me some!!!

I made it exactly as the recipe stated (well almost because I don't have a bread machine) and they were delicious.  They weren't cinnabon's but they were very good cinnamon rolls.

These are the bomb, not that you can go very wrong with a cinnamon bun slathered in cream cheese frosting. The dough is wonderfully easy to handle. I highly recommend mixing the filling together instead of the spread and sprinkle method.

These are awesome! My first time making them! It was nice to let the bread machine do most of the work, and easy to do the rest. They just came out of the oven, and I've had two already. Next time I will change the cream cheese in the frosting for some milk, since I am not a big fan of cream cheese at all.

OHHH MYYYY GOOSSHH!  To die for and tastes just like Cinnabon.  I also did not have a bread machine so I used a packet of the quick rise yeast dissolved in warm milk with the sugar (let set for 5 min. and foamy).  I also added Vital Wheat Gluten to accomodate for not having bread flour (1 Tbls per cup of All-Purpose) which I think made a huge difference in the texture.  I also added about 1/2 cup whole grain pastry flour since I like to sneak in whole wheat when I can and couldn't even tell the difference.  This recipe is so awesome!!

Very good cinnamon buns.  I didn't use a bread machine, I used my KitchenAid mixer with dough hook attachment.  Worked extremely well.  I used 2 active yeast packets instead of the bread yeast that the recipe called for.  Made the dough, left it rise for 1 hour in my warmed oven. Rolled it out and cut it into slices.  Baked at 350 for 19 minutes.  I flipped the pan into another 9X13 like the one reviewer did, to prevent the cinnamon mixture from running out.  Worked well.  Then I used a double batch of the glaze/icing on top.  Very good, time consuming to make, but well worth it.

I was very pleased with how soft the dough stayed even a day or two later. I always have trouble with my sweet rolls drying out so this dough recipe will definately stay in my files for other uses. I don't have a bread machine and used the quick-rising yeast version by hand. I mixed the butter, sugar and cinnamon together as suggested in another review and found it worked very well. I would maybe increase the sugar by 1/4 cup and the butter as well but decrease the cinnamon! I used 1 1/2 Tbsp but it was still a little too strong. Since I use a high-grade cinnamon I may bring it down to only 1/2 Tbsp or 1 at the most next time. The strength of the cinnamon will depend on the brand you use. Regular in-store brands are not as strong. Watkins, Pampered Chef and Epicure Selections are all more potent and you don't need to use as much.

I had a little trouble with my dough rising.  My over was being used when I needed it to rise.  It still tasted wonderful, but just not light and fluffy rolls.  I will try again

My only tip--they seemed much better when the icing was fully melted.  When I made them I let them cool a bit before spreading the icing, and they just didn't taste right.  However, we had lots of leftovers and after I heated them in the microwave and the icing was fully melted, they tasted much better.  Personally, I thought they got better each time--ie. they make great leftovers!

I love this recipe. I only had one question. If using a bread machine, is the dough done once the cycle is over or does it still need to rise.

This is the only sweet roll recipe I use!  I usually sprinkle cinnamon with the brown sugar for a true cinnamon taste.  I don't like the frosting quite as runny as it is when you follow the recipe.  I add extra powdered sugar.  These are my kids' favorites!

Too delicious for our own good!

I made the dough Christmas Eve, and baked the next morning (You can pop the dough in the fridge for cooking the next day, just be sure to give it ample time to warm up so that the yeast does its thing). They were probably the single most delicious thing on christmas day. 

Totally awesome.

I have made this recipe at least 6 times.  I follow the recipe exactly.  They always come out absolutely perfect.  Everybody is always so impressed by them!  This is truly a 5 star recipe!  I was going to make these again because my family loves them so much but I ran out of brown sugar!  I replaced the brown sugar with white sugar and the cinnamon with orange zest.  Oooh these are yummy too!  I also added a small amount maybe a few tbs. of orange juice to the frosting and this was a great variation to this recipe!  Also, as another person mentioned while rating, I don't have much problem with the filling ever leaking out either and I also think it's because I roll the dough until it's about 7 turns.  I do this by kinda stretching it a little while rolling and then paying extra attention to the ends, making sure they don't get too distorted looking.  The end rolls are never perfect.  I suggest eating them yourself... a little sample for the cook!

This is my first review on here and I had to write one, because this recipe is perfect. They are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made/eaten. I used regular flour, normal active yeast, no bread machine and doubled the frosting. Other than those minor changes, this recipe can do no wrong.

I'm still trying to figure out how to stop the cinnamon sugar mix from leaking out of the cinnamon buns, but even so they are sooo good. I eat 3 (in one sitting) every time I make them. Once, I burned myself making these, but it was totally worth it.

Wonderful! Everyone asks me for the recipe. I have tried it spreading a small amount of raspberry pie filling instead of butter, cinnamon, and sugar. Great! Also love cinnamon, sugar, and raisens.

This recipe doesn't need anymore reviews, but OMG it's so good, how could you not? It tastes very close to Cinnabons to me and I made them without the bread machine by mixing it together and just let it rise for an hour in a covered bowl. My boyfriend is already requesting more!

I must have made these 10 or 12 times already! They always turn out AMAZING! I always get requests to make them for cookouts and family get-togethers. You just can't go wrong with this recipe! I don't mess with perfection and always follow this recipe to a T. The only deviation is that I do make double amount of cream cheese icing. Thank you so much for sharing!

Wow!  These rolls are dynamite!  I cooked mine on one of the lower oven racks, which helped to keep the roll tops nice and soft.  And the frosting - unbelievable.  Tough to keep the New Year's Resolution to lose weight with these things around.

These are delicious!  And I love that they're so easy too!  I didn't have any eggs on hand, so I just upped the amount of milk to 1 3/4 cups, and it worked just as well.  I think the frosting could be a bit thinner, but that's just personal preference.  But it does yield enough for 2 batches, which is a time-saver the second time around.  These are a great breakfast for company, or just our family.  Very yummy and foolproof.  No wonder its got such a consistently high rating!

These were so yummy! I did not want to use my bread machine, so i used the suggetion of the first reviewer to do it by hand. I also like that you can freeze the dough of these or make the dough ahead of time then refrigerate them over night, then just pop them in the oven the next morning!!
yummy!! =)

Oh MY GOODNESS!!  This is by far the best cinnamon bun recipe I have ever tried.  They are sooo yummy i'm  ashamed to say I ate most of them myself.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

Oh my goodness! This is the best recipe I have tried in years. It really tastes like cinnabon. Even better in my opinion.
I cut the recipe in half. (I didn
't need so much, and have a small bread machine.) I made 8 rolls instead of 6, to fit a long oblong pan I have. 
     I mixed it in an old bread machine on the "manual" cycle, then turned off the machine and let it double in size. 
      I didn't have bread flour so I used all purpose flour, with 1/4 c of whole wheat flour. 
      The buttery creamcheese frosting is to die for. 
       Thank you for posting

As far as the buns themselves, they are very good, very easy. As a cinnabun recipe I'd give it a 4, but as a cinnabon 'clone' I give it a 3. The icing is nowhere similar. Very strong cream cheese.

Believe all of the reviews!  I followed others who didn't use a bread maker.  I proofed the yeast in 1/2 cup milk for 10 minutes.  I then added the remaining milk and other ingredients and used my Kitchenaid to knead.  Also, if rising takes a long time, use a glass bowl, not melamine or plastic.  I tried a few times with both and it was always faster for me with a glass bowl. Enjoy, you will love these!

Easy & accurate recipe to follow with excellent flavour! The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is that it gets chewy when cool. So make sure you heat it up right before serving if not served hot out of the oven!

The best is right! These are delicious.  Sinful, but delicious. I make mine half in the bread machine and half out, and the recipe worked perfectly.

I did use half and half brown/white sugar, because I was out of brown, and I thought it tasted great, kind of carmelly.  Also, I turned the cinnamon rolls upside down after taking them out of the oven, to cause the filling to run over the top, prior to icing them.  That seems to add to the flavor.

These were soooooo yummy!!! I made them on Christmas eve and put them in the fridge for xmas morning....what a great deal! I just popped them in the oven while the kids opened presents! My mom and her boyfriend loved them and so did my 3 girls!! The only problem I had with mine was they were a slight doughy toward the middle but I think it is because I had placed them all too close together so I didn't have to use two different pans but, no one complained but me so I know they were good!!!

These taste NOTHING like a Cinnabon.  They aren't bad, don't get me wrong, but they are not in Cinnabon's league.

I made these for Christmas morning.  I can't believe how easy they are and how good they taste.  

My dough came out of the bread machine and was a bit lumpy and poorly mixed.  I was afraid it was ruined.  They turned out fine.  I also messed up the recipe and used an 8 oz pkg of cream cheese and I liked the frosting.

These were excellent (though not the same as a Cinnabon). I made these on Christmas Eve for our family to have on Christmas morning. We just warmed them in the microwave, and they were perfect. What I love about this recipe is the dough itself (often, it's the icing &/or filling that MAKES the bun). But the dough in this recipe is rich and flavorful. These are "substantial" buns - filling and very satifying. I would not double the icing recipe (I did and there was just too much left over), but I would make a recipe and a half. Also, I followed the instructions from another reviewer to make these by hand, and it worked perfectly. I will be using this recipe for cinnamon buns from now on. Thank you!

You can put these buns in the fridge overnight, and then pop them in the oven the next morning.  Also, my oven gets too hot on the bottom, so I put my baking pan on top of another one so that I had double insulation on the bottom and they baked perfectly!  I'm trying them this morning with some raisins mixed in with the dough, like a raisin bread cinnabon.  Sounds yummy, we'll have to see!  Super great recipe!! I'm so glad it was shared.

Not that this recipe needs another raving review, but I had to throw my two cents in.  Truly phenomenal.  I used Saigon Cinnamon from Costco, which I think truly gave these rolls some extra pizazz and made them taste professionally made.  My cinnamon roll-loving hubby thanks you for posting this recipe!!

Perfect! Followed the recipe ingredients exactly. I kneaded the dough myself and let it rise, rolled it into cinnamon rolls and left it in the fridge overnight. Took them out in the morning to rise and baked! Perfecto! I doubled the icing recipe but found my guests liked them plain almost as well. I did line my baking pan with parchment paper and inverted the rolls onto a serving platter after baking. Will definitely make again and again.

I'm giving this recipe a five based on the filling and icing, which did taste like a Cinnabon!  However, I used the dough from the "Overnight Cinnamon Rolls I" recipe on this site because it was so easy to make the night before and then pop in the oven the next morning.

I'm sure this recipe doesn't need another 5 star rating, but it sure deserves it!  I've made this for our Christmas morning breakfast for the last 3 years and it's definitely become a tradition.  Since the bread machine does all the hard work, it's a pretty easy recipe.  I actually do all the steps up to the baking step the night before, and let the rolls rise in the pan overnight - then just pop into the oven first thing in the morning and you have restaurant quality cinnamon rolls.  One day, I would like to play with adding some flavoring to the frosting, maybe some orange liquor in lieu of vanilla extract...

So perfect!  I don't have a bread machine, so I used my 30-year-old Sunbeam.  I put a dash of the sugar into the milk to proof the yeast.  When I mix the dough, I add all the sugar, two cups of the flour, and the salt to the wet mixture; I mix it thoroughly before I add the rest of the flour.  I use AP flour, dry active yeast in the same proportions as the recipe calls for.  When I roll them out, I flour my granite countertop; I rub about 1/2 teaspoon of flour on wax paper to roll them out on top.  Works like a charm.  This time I made them yesterday afternoon, refrigerated the dough, and baked them this morning.  Next time I'll try a lower temp and longer cooking time.  But no matter what I've done to these, they always turn out great.  Thanks for the recipe!  EDIT 5/10/15  I wrote that review a long time ago!  Now I prepare the dough in my Kitchenaid, and I roll them out on Silpat or parchment.  Baking them at 375 for 23 minutes gives me a perfect cinnamon roll!

Delicious! Gets lots of raves from adults and children alike. Two recommendations for improvement though. If you're making the rolls by hand (not in a bread machine), don't put in all 4 1/2 cups of flour right away. Put in 3, then add a little at a time until you get the dough the way you like it. Otherwise, I think it's too dry. Also, the recipe calls for a little too much cinnamon for my taste.

This recipe really is "the BEST!" I have made this recipe many times over again. This past time I was a bit lazy and decided to use store bought frosting instead of making my own. It was good either way. Sometimes I like to add pecans before rolling, and sometimes instead of the cream cheese frosting I like to top with a carmel topping, or an orange frosting just to change things up a bit. My mother loves it when I make these, and has requested that I make them for Christmas morning. Thanks!

When they came out from the oven they were great,the bun was soft and chewy..but they did not keep well the next day..Also next time i will lessen the sugar in the filling as it was too sweet for my taste..

This is a greate recipe.  I have made it 4 times at least.  Once I accidentally used all purpose flour, and they were still delicious, but not as good as when made with bread flour.

I don't usually buy margarine.  At first I bought some specifically for these.  Now I use 1/4 cup of butter, 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of oil instead of the 1/3 cup of margarine.

Amazing! If you don't have time to make the dough you can use  a frozen bread loaf. Super easy!

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had. I have had cinnabon. I think these are just perfect. I didn't change anything in the recipe except I doubled it. I made them for a church function in the morning. I know there will be some happy folks after they try these! My filling did not run out. I'm telling you they are great!  Oh and by the way some folks had said that they had trouble with the dough rising. When you have a sweet rich dough like this it can delay rising. Just give it a little extra time if need be. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I used half wheat flour and the other half bread flour. I also did it by hand and not in my bread machine and it worked just fine. These were superb, I made them into the rolls then let sit in the fridge over night, popped them right in the oven in the morning and they were just incredible. I had to put them away or they all would have been gone that night, the family LOVED them!

Wow-I can't say enough great things about this recipe.  I'm afraid of yeast because I just don't know what to do with it!  After reading the other reviews, I decided to just make this (without a bread machine-mind you!).  WOW, it was DELICIOUS!  I'm so sad that I halved the recipe, because I just made them this morning and now they are all gone.........oh well-off to make some more!

oh my gosh, these are so freakin' good i can't stop eating them! i followed the recipe exactly but doubled the amount of frosting. it's SO much better then that wimpy glaze that some people put on their rolls. this is an AWESOME recipe! The only change is that i added toasted chopped pecans (put under broiler for ~2 or 3 min). Toasting makes all the difference!

My husband loved this recipe the first time I made it according to the recipe. I thought the filling and frosting was too sweet, so I have found different recipes for those two, but overall an excellent recipe. I'll be making these for Christmas morning.

This is a great recipe. It beats any store-bought cinnamon bun hands down.
I am not a fan of cream cheese icing  so  I just go without and the buns are still fantastic!

Very good! I've made them the day before and individually wrapped each roll with seran wrap and took out what I needed the following morning for breakfast.  Flipping the rolls after taking them out of the oven works well to keep the middle from oozing out the bottom.

WOW, these are so good!  I didn't use the breadmaker, but used the tips from previous reviews on how to do it without the breadmaker.  These are so fabulous!  Friends are ranting and raving over them.

I want to make this recipe over and over again and serve it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
This really is an incredibly wonderful recipe. My waistline is going to hate me for this one. Smelling these fresh out of the oven on a cold and snowy day is heavenly.

I love this recipe. I made it twice -- however the 2nd time I made it came out a little "heavier" than when i made it the first time.  I am thinking could it be the cold eggs i used this time. Anyways.. this recipe is a keeper!!!

These were AWESOME!! I, too, had trouble with the dough rising, even put a desk lamp over the pan to give it alittle more warmth. Rolled it out and finished making the rolls and they, too, didn't raise as I thought they would. Baked them anyway, and they rose beautifully. My family loved them. This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls, and I think I might have had the milk too warm for the yeast which may have caused the dough not to rise that much. Will make again because they were delicious. (Only thing I did differently was I didn't have any cream cheese for the icing, and just used butter, powdered sugar and added orange extract instead of vanilla...it was alittle thick so I added a Tbs or two of milk to make it easier to spread on rolls.) Thanks for sharing......
Revised 12-12-08...Made a second time, put the dough into the oven with my oven light on...was a warmer place to let dough rise, and it rose beautifully, even rolled out easier. Baked rolls were very light and soft...this is a real keeper...Thank You!!

I haven't made anything with yeast for many, many years and tried this recipe (after reading all the great reviews).  Well, absolutely the best! My family loved every bite.  I had a little trouble with the yeast but found out the package of yeast I bought was faulty - once I purchased a new pkg I had no trouble.  The best compliment - my hubby's ex said she was impressed, lol.  Thanks for a wonderful addition to my recipe book!

OMG!!!  These cinnamon rolls are absolutely amazing!  I've made cinnamon rolls before, but they don't even compare with these!  If you're thinking about trying this recipe, don't even give it a second thought.....just make them!  :-)  I added raisins and pecans the second time I made them, but I love them either way.  Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe!!

Delicious - these turned out perfectly!  I used two packets of rapid rise yeast and kneaded the dough myself instead of using the bread machine, letting it rest an hour before rolling it out.  Instead of cutting it into 12 pieces, I cut them into 8 larger pieces.  Yum!  I will definitely make these again.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe!  We all loved it.  I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of mixing the butter with the sugar and cinnamon (2 Tb)and then spreading it.  It is really quite fabulous and I am sure I will be making this MANY more times to come!

I loved the cinnamon roll itself but I did not enjoy the frosting, probably because I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese. While I'll look for another icing recipe I will definitely keep the dough recipe. Thanks!

I guess I don't have very much of a sweet tooth because I found these too sweet for my taste.  The dough was so easy to work with, but next time I will cut down on the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Also, I will cut into 16 pieces and put 4 of them into an additional 8" inch pan.  I found that when cooking the whole recipe of 12 in a 9 x 13 pan, that the middle buns didn't get entirely done. I'll try them again with changes.

I'm rating the frosting as opposed to the whole recipe. I already have a cinnamon swirl recipe I'm very happy with so I didn't try this one.
But this frosting is absolutely TO DIE FOR! I've never had a cinnabon but I'll make sure I do next time I'm over in the US.
I nearly ate all the mixture before I got a chance to put it on the buns! It was wonderful!
Thank you for a very lovely and different icing recipe!

First, for the "high altitude" reviewer: I live in Colorado and never have a problem by following three rules: 1. Always use self rising flour, 2. Always use quick acting yeast, 3. Always let dough rise in a fairly warm oven. These did fine for me however 400 degrees was too hot for my oven. 350 degrees worked much better. The filling leaks out the bottom so be sure to invert your pan after taking them out of the oven. My rolls were done even in the middle and very tasty. I always use more filling than what any cinnamon roll recipe calls and I did here, too. My 14 yr. old says she still likes the recipe I usually use better, but these were good. The frosting is great but very rich and sweet.

When I first saw this recipe, I was wondering how in the world it got rated 5 stars 2000+ times. Now I know why.

Before this recipe the dough I used would always turn out tough. Not these! The dough was so soft and tender.

These are some of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had.

Thanks!

Everything everyone says about these is true.  Wonderful cinnamon rolls.  I ended up with two pans, refrigerated them both.  Used one the next day and the other two days later.  The second was just as good as the first.

Wow! This is a wonderful recipe! I have to first start by saying that I am not a baker, I actually don't really like to bake so just the fact that these turned out at all is saying a lot about this recipe, I have had a ton of baking disasters. I do not have a bread machine so I scoured the reviews for helpful tips on making this with my kitchen aid stand mixer. I have to say these were not nearly as difficult as I had anticipated, the longest part is waiting for the dough to rise. I made these while my family was out of town for the weekend and when they came home these fresh, homemade cinnamon rolls were waiting for them. My husband tasted them and said "No way you made these, you went to Cinnabon and bought them" ! The kids loved them, I wish I had doubled the recipe because they were quickly devoured. Thanks so much for a great recipe, if I can make it and have it turn out, it is practically fool proof!

These were the first cinnamon buns I've made and they're great! I will put them in the oven to rise next time b/c they didnt' rise well. But tasty! I'm not a cream cheese icing girl but this recipe was perfect! Not too cream cheese tasting! We loved them!

OMG!!! These are so good, my family loves them. It took me a few try to get them right cause i don't have a bread machine and i really never made dough before. For the filling I put 2 cups of brown sugar and 4tbsp of cinnamon so that its more gooie. Instead of greasing the pan I melt 1/3 cup of butter in a pan and add half cup of ice cream and half cup of brown sugar. Bring to boil for 2 min. Pour the mixture on buttom of baking pan and put rolls on top. Cook it at 375 til they turn golden brown. The ice cream mixture give them a really good flavor. This recipe is a keeper!!

This is a very easy recipe to make.  I use unsalted butter instead of margarine.  I also slice the roll into pieces with dental floss looped around the rolled log.

WOW.  I am NOT a good cook, but I was THUROUGHLY impressed with this recipe and how it turned out.  My husband usually compliments me on my cooking (no matter how bad it is) but with this recipe, he wouldn't stop saying how much he loved it.  I was a bit concerned when it seemed the cinnabons didn't rise too much after I rolled them out and spread the cinnamon sugar, but I was thrilled when I opened the oven 15 minutes later and my apartment smelled just like the cinnabon store at the mall!  :)  We've decided to make this a traditional "special occasion" breakfast, and my husband says, "Isn't EVERY day a special occasion??"  THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE!  Gooey-ness note:  The one issue I have had with this recipe is that the rolls toward the center of the pan never seem to bake very well, resulting in OVERLY gooey cinnamon rolls which I don't mind, but some of my guests have not been thrilled with.  To combat this problem (and still get delightful results) I now divide the rolls into enough pans so that there is space around each roll so that the oven air gets around every roll and everything is more evenly baked.  It doesn't look as pretty coming out of the oven, but they are more satisfactory to my dough-hating friends.  :)

Awesome rolls!  Very simple for my second try with yeast.  Creamed butter, sugar, and cinnamon before spreading on the dough; baked at 350 for 25 mins for beautiful, delicious cinnamon rolls.  I didn't even get to make up the icing before my kids + sleepover friends scarfed down a whole roll each (despite being HUGE!).  Great weekend breakfast, will be making and freezing plenty of these in the future.

These were AWESOME!!! You really do need to abide by the directions as far as warm milk and room temp eggs. The second time I made them, I didn't let those get to room temp. and my dough suffered, although, they were still delicious. If you follow the recipe though, they WILL taste like Cinnabon!

O-M-G! These are amazing. Simply amazing! Definitely flip these bad boys over when you take them out of the oven so the cinnamon-sugar makes it back up to the top... frost and then eat. YUM - I can't get over how good they are. I'm scared I'll eat the entire tray!

Awesome!  Followed other suggestions.  Mixed butter, cinnamon and sugar together before spreading.  Made it in stand mixer.  Spit it into 2 9x9 pans and put one in the fridge overnight and one in the freezer for later.  Worked great!  Definitely double the frosting (or if separating make per direction for each batch)

OH MY GOSH! These are the best cinnamon rolls ever.  They were so easy to make.  I didn't change a thing.  My kids devoured them.  My husband isn't one to eat sweet things in the morning and he loved them.  These will be a regular in our house.

This was my first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls.  I followed the recipe, except for the filling.  I combined the butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon and spread it on the dough.  It was a little tricky to spread, but I saw all the comments that the goo melted to the bottom of the dish.  By combining the butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon, I had NO GOO on the bottom of my pan and they taste wonderful.  They are pretty rich so I can only eat a few bites but I will make them again.

These were pretty great.  I think the dough may have needed a little more sugar or salt.  Not sure which.

My husband loved these but I was disappointed.  I thought the bread was doughy tasting even though it was done.  I guess it was floury to me?  I won't make these again but they have helped me decide on what I am looking for....now I need to find it.

This is a delicious treat! Thank you for providing the measurement for rolling out the dough--that helped me get them just right. Our daughter's water polo team devoured these in no time flat!

Loved this recipe!  I have tried out quite a few cinnamon roll recipes and never have had much luck.  They have always been decent but nothing to rave about.  This recipe was amazing and I thought quite easy.  I can't say enough about them and my family LOVES them!

This was really good.  I would not call it a "clone of Cinnabon".  Cinnabon buns are gooey, these are not gooey, but still very delicious.  Dough is perfect, cinnamon amount is just right. I used the tip of flipping them upside down after pulling them from the oven, which is a great tip to redistribute the filling.  Best recipe I have used, but not a Cinnabon.

WONDERFUL recipe! I made this for a camping trip and they were great. I doubled the frosting but it was way to much. I also lowered the temp which worked but it needed to cook about 5-8 min longer than the recipe stated. Everybody loved but be prepared to eat some protein because there was a serious amount of sugar involved with these roll. YUMMY!

The dough is a pretty typical cinnamon roll. The frosting is delicious, but I actually prefer my other cinnamon roll recipe, so I will use IT with this frosting from now on.

These are wonderful! I lost track of time and slightly overcooked them and they were still incredible! I made them exactly as the recipe instructed except I did double the frosting and didn't make it in the bread machine. I followed others instuctions and kneaded the dough by hand then doubled the volume in a warmed oven. The frosting was to die for!

I tried this recipe and totally loved it.  I did it all in the mixer then took the dough and finished kneading it.  Used the dough rise setting on my oven it took a while to come up but boy what a great sweet dough.  Would use this for cinnamon bread for toast.  Okay, the icing - it is a WINNER!!  I have tried alot of cinnamon bun recipes, but this topped every one of them will use this a thousand times.  It did take some kneading, and some time to rise but what a recipe. I might let it rise overnight in the fridge and bake off in the morning for hot rolls.  They keep well and warm well in the mircrowave.  Try it you will like it.

Wow! These are incredible.  I have tried to make cinnamon rolls with other recipes and have never had them come out near this good.  And these were very easy.  I don't have a bread machine and followed another reviewers advice for making them by hand.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Just made for the first time. They turned out wonderful! I doubled the recipe and added a 1/2 cup of raisons to half the batch. I used a quick rise yeast and my mixer and they rose beautifully. I will be making this again I am sure!

These are really, really, really good! Not too dense, not too fluffy, just perfect. I used a powdered sugar/vanilla/milk icing b/c I don't care for think icings, but they were excellent without any icing at all!!

I made these for brunch today and they were scrumptious.  I added a little cinnamon and vanilla to the dough.  I also bumped the temp. down to 375 and kept checking until the tops were just barely browning.  I will definitely make these again.

I chose this recipe because of the number of reviews and the 5* rating; I am a bit disappointed.  They were no more trouble to make than any other cinnamon roll.  But after 15 min. of cooking at 400 they were very brown.  I touched them and thought they felt rather soft, but any more cooking and they would have been burned.  Turns out they were RAW in the middle!  IF I ever make them again, I will lower the temp. and cook them longer!  Also, they were way too big.  I will probably make them into 20-24 rolls next time.

This is one of the best recipes that I have used.  At times, I have used apricot preserves instead of the cinnamon mixture and brought them to the office and coworkers raved about them. I use on bread flour.  It's very easy and the end product is sooooooooo good!

Excellent recipe.  I didn't include the eggs and used butter instead of margarine in the dough.  I iced with just a simple mixture of icing sugar, water, vanilla and corn syrup.  My husband take 2 to work with him everyday.

Really tasty! I added raisins to mine and orange zest to the frosting. I doubled the amount of icing sugar though because I found the frosting too runny!

My husband demands I make this recipe for the rest of our lives! My Sunday School went bonkers over it! This is one of those recipes that makes you look like a way better cook than you actually are! 
I used a glass pan as suggested in the reviews. I only had 15 minutes to let it rise the second time but it still turned out great! I combined the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together before spreading on the dough as suggested in another review but I had trouble getting it to spread easily. The consistency of the filling in the baked rolls turned out perfect. So maybe a little work on the front end makes it better in the end result.

Thanks for the recipe!!!

These were good and fairly easy to make with the bread machine.  Not that this recipe needed another five-star rating, but I might as well add mine to the bunch.  I did take the advise of others and use a metal pan, I actually used an air-bake cake pan. I use air-bake cookie sheets on almost all of my cookies and everything thing I make with them seem to come out great.  Many people don't like them, but I couldn't live without them.  I think next time I will either roll the dough out a little thinner or use just a little bit less cinnamon and brown sugar.  Thanks!

Nice recipe.  In particular I liked the cream cheese frosting and plan to use it elsewhere.
One note, I had problems (like other people did) with cooking it properly at the stated temp/time.  I think using a glass dish slows down the cooking too much, so be warned.  Use a metal 9x13 or adjust accordingly.

Absolutely fantastic recipe! When these are made on a weekend morning at my house, the pan is gone before noon! If you're short on time (or inclination) to make the dough from scratch, I found that using three (1 lb.) loaves of frozen white dough will yield great results. Simply thaw the dough in its package in the refrigerator overnight (10-12 hours) and roll out as usual the next morning.

I made these this morning and they were GREAT! I didn't have bread flour or bread mach. I used all purpose flour and kneaded by hand and they turned out fine. Next time I am going to use the bread flour but I can't imagine them tasting any better...Awesome recipe

Very, very good! I think there's too much sugar/cinnamon mix on the inside though. Overpowering. Next time I'll add less.

I don't think I will ever buy Cinnabon at the mall again :) oh by the way, i only used a cup of brown sugar for the filling, added raisins and pecans just on some parts so I ended up having 3 different types of Cinnabons (Plain, Pecans, Raisins)... i also cooked at 350 degrees for 25minutes. btw, does anyone know how to make the same glaze as the Cinnabon company?? I don't think they use cream cheese... theirs is more like white color but the one from this site is yellowish.. please let me know if u have any idea~ thanks!

Excellent.  However, I'm only giving 4 stars because the sugar filling hardened as the rolls cooled, and left some crunchy sugar bits that my husband didn't like.  Also, there was realy no need to double the frosting, as some suggested.  THe original amount would have been plenty.  I doubled it, and have about half left over.  Overall, an outstanding cinnamon bun recipe.

Incredible! I'm an American living in New Zealand, and there are no Cinnabons here, so having this was amazing. I cut the recipe in half and made twelve mini-cinnamon rolls, and they were the perfect size. My flatmates and I loved them.

Oh, how excellent these are!  So what if it takes almost 3 hours to eat them...they are THAT GOOD.  I've never made homemade cinnamon rolls in my life, but these recipe is very easy.  I used my new stand mixer for kneading the dough, which made it a snap.  It does have a very powerful cinnamon flavor (I used Saigon cinnamon), which may be a little too much for some, but not for us!  Try it tomorrow morning!

These take a long time, but they're definitely worth it. 
I think they need to be baked a bit longer than the recipe says to, though. The ones in the center of my pan were very doughy. If I make them again, I'll definitely add another 15 minutes or so of oven time. 
I used "whole wheat white" flour instead of regular white, and it tasted great.

I've never made cinnamon buns before. (well.. once when I was 17, and I failed miserably). These were really easy to make, and to top it off, they were super yummy. My aunt loved them, and she is the queen of home made cinnamon buns.

Seriously, the recipe works perfectly, but I do suggest baking in a 350 degree oven instead of 400 degrees. An excellent must try!

What a great recipe!
My boyfriend told me he didnt like cinnamon buns. So I asked myself where did they all go? Let's just say I made another batch and those were all gone right away to! 

Warning: This recipe is for people who are willing to keep making more!

Omg........these are even better than those at our local cinnabon and so much cheaper!  At least you know when you make them that you are getting hot and fresh rolls.

What a great recipe. I did what other suggested and I inverted them onto a jelly roll pan and let them sit for about 20 minutes and then frosted them. My husband is a frosting freek so we doubled the frosting and they were fabulous. I just used regular yeast in my bread machine and it worked great. I set my convection oven for 350 and I watched them for 15 minutes so they wouldn't burn and they came out great. The first time I made them I wasen't paying attention and they got pretty brown on top. But by turning them over and then frosting them no one could tell. My husband asked me to make them again tonight so I did and they turned out great. THANK YOU!

Made these last night and they turned out great.  Changed the cooking temp and time to 350 for 25 minutes.  Thinned the frosting with a couple tablespoons of half and half, otherwise no changes.  As another reviewer stated, the dough came together beautifully.  I rolled them up nice and tight. They are absolutely picture perfect and there wasn't any leakage of filling into the bottom of the pan.  Very large and very rich.  I feel guilty having one for breakfast!  Will definitely make again. FANTASTIC RECIPE!!

Cooking temperature was way too warm. At 400 after 15 minutes the edges were very dark and all, I mean all of the insides were not cooked. I did not realize this until they were all iced. Put them back in the oven, icing and all and it took another 20 minutes to get them all cooked. I RECOMMEND A 350 OVEN OR LOWER. The dough however was amazing, the best I've worked with. I'm going to definitely try it once more in a few weeks. Just with a cooler oven.

These are the best cinnamon rolls ever.  I have made them 3 times now.  The first time I made them I even totally screwed up and forgot to put the sugar in the recipe (I don't have a bread machine so was doing it by hand) I kneaded in the sugar but the dough seemed off.  I went ahead and finished up and they still came out better than any I have every tried making.  If I could ruin them and still have them turn out great tells me this is  the best recipe.  The 2nd time I made them I got everything right and they were awesome.  They are quick and easy and yummy.  GREAT RECIPE.

These turned out great. I just didn't cook them long enough, but we ate them all anyway.

For me, the dough is a little dry and once baked the rolls are a bit try for my tastes.  I don't know if adding more milk or eggs might correct that for me.  HOWEVER, if you have leftovers and microwave them the next day, THEN it tastes like a Cinnabon to me.

Awesome!  My parents and husband thought they were great too!  My dad said they were the best cinnamon rolls he'd ever had.  Him and my mom made me leave the leftovers with them.  I made them without a bread machine and I doubled the frosting (you can never have enough frosting) and they were perfect!

I love Cinnabon cinnamon rolls, but live in a small town 2 hours from the closest city that I can get one.  I made these tonight, and WOW!!!!!  They may not be exactly like a Cinnabon(someone mentioned special cinnamon and some other differences), but who cares!  They were the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made from scratch, and I've made a few batches.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just made these and wow!  SOOOO good!  I agree with another reviewer though on the cream cheese glaze.  Next time I will make something different without cream cheese.  I used my stand mixer to make the dough since I don't have a bread machine and did what others said about letting it rise in a preheated 200 degree oven (turned the heat off) for an hour.  Only after I rolled these and was letting them rise the final 30 minutes did I watch the how to make cinnamon rolls video on this site.  Should have before hand as mine weren't too pretty, but tasted great!  My husband loves me even more now!  Happy Mother's Day!

I tried the recipe using without a bread maker and it turned out fantastic.  Hubby ate 3 while it was still hot from the oven, dripping with the topping!  Simply fabulous.  Will definitely make it again, only will reduce the amount of topping.

These are SO good. I do suggest using a glass 9x13 pan because once I used a ceramic pan and they were't cooked in the middle.

Loved it,loved it,loved it!!!This is Outstanding!  Rushed home yesterday to start baking the rolls.  I followed the recipe to the letter except for the yeast, at which I used the Fleismann fast-rising (acting?) yeast-  didn't think it would make any difference.  I did the Glaze/topping and it has a fantastic consistency I've ever seen!  It's wonderful when you spread it all over the rolls.  The only thing that made me doubt was the "15 minute" cooking time- which is a little too short for me- I baked it for a few more minutes, 7-8 minutes.  The whole house smelled so good at 10:45pm!!   It's a Five Star for me , no doubt!  And just to comment on those "poor ratings" - maybe you guys need to give it a second try- you're probably doing something different?!?!?!  Hats off to you, Ms Fernandez!  Thanks for sharing it!

These were very easy to make with my kitchenaid bread hook.  It took a little over an hour to rise the first time, and about 40 minutes the second time.  I had just the right amount of filling and frosting so I wouldn't make any changes to those, and I used butter instead of margerine and it worked great.

I added raisins and I didn't melt the butter...I spread it over the whole rectangle.  

When I tried using a knife to cut the sections, they got squished.  So, I used a long piece of dental floss.  (unused, of course!)  I slid it underneath the roll, brought up both ends and then crisscrossed until the section had been cut through.  

I will be making these again!!  thank you!!

The aroma of these in my oven takes me back to walking through the mall hungry when the cinnabon smell teasingly slaps you in the face.  I am a non-baker, so if a recipe is complicated, I WONT do it again.  I have made these rolls 3 times now.  The only thing I change is I make them a bit smaller so my kids won't waste them.  Pretty dang good.

Wonderful, It is does take a bit of time to make these but so worth the effort! I followed the recipe to a "T" and all went well. I had plenty of frosting with some left over. I over baked mine.. I went to get the kids from school and it took longer then I expected. I bake mine at 400 for 20 min.. they are a tad dry so I think that they would have been awesome at just 15! I will watch them closely next time! YUM

I thought they were yummy!  My kids wanted store bought cinnamon rolls, boo hoo!  All that work and only I ate them.
It was a difficult recipe for me because there weren't enough directions on how to actually fill and roll up the rolls.  I learned a lot watching the "how to make cinnamon rolls" video on this site.  Otherwise, I think the cinnamon would have spilled out of the dough.
I also didn't know how long it would take for the dough to double.  An approximate amount of time would have been nice.

I had a little trouble with my breadmaker so i had to finish making the dough by hand.The dough was really hard to handle and my rolls didnt come out looking very nice!!And it was a bit sweet so I'll be cutting down on the sugar for the filling...thinking of trying again and maybe next time it will come out great :)

Amazing, these are soooo good.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and made sure I brought a good cinnamon as that is the key flavor ingredient.  These will now replace the can ones and going to the mall.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Some people have problems with the filling staying in the rolls,  I melted the butter and poured it over the dough then added the sugar and cinnamon mix and smoothed it out.  It worked out well and I had no problems with in oozing out. I've already got plans to make them again.  The are easier to make than they look.

I tried this recipe out last night.WOW!!!!These came out absolutely yummy.Soft,moist,gooey and my home smelled of cinnamon and dough.I used 4 cups instead of 4 1/2 cups of flour and added two teaspoons of vanilla extract in the dough,i also added 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon instead of 2.I also baked my buns for 20 minutes till they're lightly golden brown.I didn't make the frosting that this recipe comes with,but made one of my own:3 tbs.milk,2 tbs.instant vanilla pudding mix,1/2 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 tbs.butter.Boil all together till the mixture is bubbly and spread over cinnabons.Yummy,rich and gooey!!!!!!This is a keeper,i'm not gonna try another cinnabol recipe again,i've found the perfect one!

The dough was opening the lid of the bread maker!  I have never had any recipe rise this well. They were great, and the icing was wonderful!

I split the rolls by baking three roll in each disposable foil loaf pan. If you just keep the icing on the side, they taste just as fresh when you reheat them. It also makes it easy to give some of them away... otherwise I would eat them all myself =)

Scrumptious. I made these in the bread maker, then overnighted the rolls in the fridge. I didn't want to heat the kitchen up too quickly so put both pans of rolls on a heating pad to rise. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. I didn't have cream cheese but if you add around a Tab. or so of lemon juice, it will give it the right amount of tang. My daughter ate SIX of these cinnamon buns on Easter morning! Thanks for the great recipe.

Fantastic! I mixed the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon together and put it into the microware for 10 sec to make it soft and easy to spread on the dough.  I just do half of the portion but roll it to 8X12 inch and cut 12 mini size cinnamon.  One of the review b4 said it is more soft if bake it 175C 20mins, so I follow her suggestion.  Because my family don't like sweet~~~so next time I will try to decrease the portion of butter and brown sugar.

absolutely wonderful. I made 2 dozen in 1 day. They where a hit. I had alittle trouble rolling the dough into a rectangle but with practice i will get it. I may cut them alittle thinner next time so they aren't so huge. But they were great! This one is a keeper.

this recipe was great. I followed the it exactly and the outcome was fantastic cinnamon buns! The only thing I wanted to mention is that the rising time can vary. Mine took a little longer to rise than 30 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. The second time i made them, I tried to cut out a little bit of the butter for the filling, but don't do that, it compromised the moisture.
good!

I made these for my extremely "fussy" in-laws (we've been married 25 years and I'm still trying to win the approval for their only son!! :) )and they could not have been more appreciative!  I made them exactly as specified and my only complaint (not theirs) was they seemed a little dense.  I did let them rise a bit longer than directed and still felt they were heavy.  I'm going to try them again for my Bible study Spring brunch next Monday, and add a bit more yeast and let rise longer....any other suggestions?

I make cinnamon rolls a lot at work
I use the fast rising yeast and omit the first raising. I can make cinnamon rolls in one hour. I just mix the dough, make the rolls and let raise 45 min then bake.

Wonderful!  I sprayed wax paper with Pam like another reviewer suggested and that made it so easy to roll out and then roll up.  I didn't have any cream cheese for the icing, so I used all of the other ingredients and substituted a splash of milk. Yummy!

Really good! Mine separated though and the filling mostly came out. prob something I did wrong. Regardless it tasted declicious. I did 1/2 w/ cinnamon sugar and the other half w/ cinnamon/sugar/pecans & cranberries. Delicious!

2/2010: Update: I made this again and used softened butter but not too soft and mixed it w/ sugar/cinnamon like others suggested. I also baked about 20 minutes on 350. Next time I might do more of the butter/sugar mixture. Delicious! and this time the butter/sugar mixture did not leak out.

I made these last night and they got RAVE reviews!
I used my food proccessor to make the dough and it worked great.
The only thing I changed was I used butter instead of margarine(I am not a fan of margarine)
They are really simple to make and tasted even better than cinnabon!!

100% FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!  Best recipe for cinnamon buns I have found.  Quick and very convenient with a bread machine, just throw the ingredients in, and let it go.  My family loves these and beg me to make them.

This recipe so does not need another rave review but I couldn't resist . . . These turn out exactly like the cinnamon rolls you buy at Cinnabon.  I made them during Christmas holiday time and gave them as gifts now everyone wants the recipe.  I have thrown out ALL of my other cinnamon roll recipes and will only use this one.

These turned out just like my regular cinnamon rolls that I make. I am going to stick with this recipe though because it is a bit simplier than mine. I did try to cut my rolls with a dental floss as one reviewer suggested, but it actually was better with a knife. I also flipped them over and the bottoms looked better because they had a cinnamon/sugar glaze on top.

Very easy to make even without a bread machine. Nice, simple recipe-I had all the ingredients I needed in the pantry. It did take a lot longer to rise than the recipe stated (about an hour for the second rise). I had to use the warm oven trick too.  The icing tastes just like Cinnabons! Mine turned out "picture perfect"!

These were easy and so yummy! I didn't change a thing except to double the frosting because that is the way we like them.  I will definitely make these regularly.

This is fantastic!!  I have been looking for a good cinnamon roll recipe and I found a great one here.  I didn't frost them however.  I made caramel rolls out of them and didn't use a bread machine but used my mixer.  They turned out fantastic, the best I have ever had.  Thank you.

I just made these for the 2nd time in a week and my family goes crazy over them.  I will make these quite often for that reason.  I found that it takes an hour after you cut them and place them in the dish to rise. I place mine on the stove top when I'm warming up the oven that they rise quicker also.  Great recipe.

Before I made these.. I read all the reviews...well, most of them. I thought" could that really be that good?" I made them last night. YES! They really are THAT good!!! I can not believe how great they are. Better that what you get in the store without all the chemicals and preservatives they use for commercial production. I didn't have a bread machine, so I made them by hand. Dissolved the yeast in the milk first. The trick about preheating the oven to 200 degrees then turning off, really worked well. Great idea! They definitely are better than cinnabon's. I made my own frosting with cream cheese( always make my own anyway, I have a peanut allergy son.)So I can't vouch for the icing in the recipe, but I did bake them for 20 minutes at 375. Perfect. Also, if you don't turn them over to let the sugar run down, you will get this great base of sugar on the bottom of the roll. Yum!!!!  (if you like that sort of thing!) If you are hesitant at all about this recipe...forget it...this really is the BEST one out there!!

this is a delicious recipe and so easy to do! I didn't use a bread machine and they came out great with a little elbow grease. next time, I think I'll add some crumbled pecans.

I used a splash of whole milk in the frosting to make it more creamy.

One of my very best friends gave me an almost identical recipe for her Grandmother Minnie's cinnamon rolls. I made both hers and this one, and I like her recipe & directions a tiny bit better. Also, my husband likes the cream cheese icing better than the pure sugar based. Thanks for posting, this is a really great recipe and loved by many (as I can see all the 5 star reviews!)

Being from Canada, and living in Italy I was craving a cinnabon which don't exist here. These were great! The whole family enjoyed it. Easy to follow and absolutely delicious. I excluded the cream cheese for the frosting(my kids don't like it) and used just confectioners sugar, butter, vanilla, and milk.

These were very good--I made a loaf of bread out of half of the dough and rolls out of the other half.  I had thought the filling would be stickier, so I might try some more butter or something inside... But the dough itself was fabulous--most doughs don't have much flavor, and this dough is fabulous!  I intend to make french toast out of the loaf--I can't wait!

I agree with the others who find the icing WAY too rich. I also found there to be far too much cinnamon/sugar- half the amount is more than enough (I'll do a quarter next time). I guess I'm not used to ooey gooey sweet things but this is just too much.  The dough is great and I'll use it again- just cutting back on everything sweet. It seems just too much over the top.

Please note- while I LOVE the dough and have made it hundreds of times, the filling and icing of this recipe is what decreases my rating to 3 stars.

These are worth the effort.  We made them with a glaze the second time because the icing with the recipe made them almost too rich for us.  Other than that, a great treat!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because the cream cheese icing on top was just too heavy. It covered up the best tasting cinnamon rolls I have ever had. These rolls are too light for such a heavy topping. This was a fast and easy way to make cinnamon rolls. The whole family loves them. I have made them many times and the come out perfect every time!

Oh my holy goodness.  This was the best recipe ever.  I made them the night before and put them in the fridge over night.  In the morning I let them rise for about 45 minutes (we got impatient, it was Christmas morning), then baked.  They were incredible.  I mixed the brown sugar/cinnamon/margarine together and it spread very nicely with a spatula (I also let it sit out to get to room temp).  At any rate, this was incredible- I'm making them again this weekend for company- these were actually BETTER than Cinnabon's- they weren't so sticky sweet, and a little more spicy.

Always turns out great, unless that is if I kill the yeast..lol. Anyways, I don't use a bread machine for I don't have one but I just start out the yeast in warm sugar water just as you would any other bread.

Made this recipe for a Mom's group I attend.  They all loved it!  I was made to promise to bring them next time my small group is in charge of food.  Those ladies left no crumbs!  Definitely a keeper.  If you use a bread machine, it isn't hard to make at all.

These really are as good as everyone says they are.  I went ahead and tried them even though I had a good family recipe, needless to say these have replaced my old recipe.

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I put them in a disposable 9x13 pan then put them in the freezer.  I took them with me on vacation to bake there.  They did take a while to defrost and then rise, but they were awesome!  I just made them again for my husband to take to the musicians at our church and they were awesome again.  This time I put them in the fridge for a few hours and then left them out overnight to rise.  I baked them in the morning and they were perfect.  I always add extra cream cheese to the frosting since I like the cream cheese flavor more then the icing sugar flavor.  These are really easy to make and everyone always raves about how good they are.

I made these without a breadmaker. After taking them out of the oven, I let them cool for a few minutes and then flipped them over into a different pan so the butter/sugar mixture wouldn't sink to the bottom. My only complaint is that they were a little doughy, but I will definitely make these again! They were a huge success at my brunch :)

These are amazing.  Every cinnamon roll I've purchased in cafes, coffeeshops since making these has been a disappointment.  The only change I made was to replace the margarine with butter to keep the ingredients more natural.  Delicious!

I have made this several times and it comes out perfect everytime!  What a wonderful recipe.  My family loves them!  I love cinnamon, so I usually add a bit more to the filling.  I also use a different cream cheese icing from this site.

Even if your dough isn't perfect these rolls will still taste great.  I used 2 frozen whole wheat loaves to make these.  I followed the directions on the bread loaf bag to defrost and work with the dough.  After I rolled out the dough and cut off the excess I still had about 15 rolls, although they weren't huge. (which is a good thing, as these are so sweet and rich, more than one almost makes you sick)  I followed other reviewers and used more cinnamon, about 4 Tablespoons, and after I baked these I put them on a plate and poured the excess cinnamon goo over the top.  The recipe for the icing makes plenty, had I doubled it I would have thrown the rest out.  Excellent, but definitely a recipe I'll save for once or twice a year, as they are so very sweet!

Thank you for this recipe!  I absolutely love Cinnabon's!  It had been part of my Christmas morning tradition for many years.  I moved this year and suddenly found that the nearest Cinnabun shop was an hour and a half away. After reading many of the reviews, I made the following revisions:  I allowed the dough to rise twice before rolling it out so that it would be fluffy and light.  I also did not melt the butter with the cinnamon mixture but spread the butter on top of the rolled out dough and sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon afterwards.  It took approx. 18 minutes to cook.  They were perfect, just like the freshly made ones in the malls.  The icing was slightly different, not as much cream cheese flavoring but this could easily be adjusted.  Overall, quite a hit and I am glad that I still can continue my Christmas holiday tradition.

I went to the store to buy ingredients to make this and the cashier said "Baking?"  I said "Yeah"  she asked "What are you making?"  I replied "cinnamon rolls."  She gasped and said that she only knew one person who could make them properly and wished me luck. Well for my first try they turned out absolutely amazing.  Thanks for this recipe and for allowing me to join the ranks as one of the few who can make good cinnamon rolls.

Tastes just like a cinnabon! We made this Christmas eve, and put them on wax paper on a baking tray in the fridge. We let them sit out for an hour in the morning, and then baked them and iced them. I messed up slightly when making the filling, as I just mixed the melted butter right in with the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture, then spread it on with a frosting spreader, rather than brushing it on first. It actually worked out better, since it made it much easier to roll up- the sugar didn't fall out the sides at all and stayed in place better. I think I'll do that next time as well. This is our new Christmas tradition!

I don't know what went wrong but it must have been something I did because most other reviewers rate these highly.  I just couldn't get them to cook through - they were brown on the outside but gooey in the middle.  I will have to try again someday...

Very good! We used Whole wheat flour so they turned out a little dryer and less sweet then a true Cinnabon.

The second time we made them we upped the milk an extra 1/4c to help the whole wheat not be so dry. We also used Splenda in lue of the sugar and a full cup of the new Splenda Brown sugar in place of the regular brown sugar so my diabetic father could eat some as well for Christams and I think the Splenda version was even better!

We also did not have bread machine so we used the dry active yeast suggestion and it turned out beautiful! Everyone was impressed we made it!

This was my first attempt at making Cinnamon Rolls, and what a SUCCESS!!  

They were absolutely delicious, and very easy to make, even for a novice like me.

Cinnabon's are my Mom's absolute favorite, and she LOVED these clones!!!!

I did make a double batch of icing for them, and turned the pan when they came out of the oven to capture all of the great syrup that was in the bottom of the pan......

JUST WONDERFUL!!!

these are good... really good!  They are nearly identical to Cinnabon and the smell is amazing when they are cooking.  The icing makes these extra good.  Easy 5 star recommendation.

WOW! Everyone is RIGHT these are THE BEST! I've made them 3 times now and wouldn't change a thing.  I don't have a bread machine and instead added dry yeast as suggest in an other review, turned out GREAT!  I used the was paper trick, too.  Yummy!

These were awesome.  I made them for a breakfast potluck at work, and everyone loved them.  I have now been nominated as the cinnamon roll baker.  I do not have a bread machine and made these by hand, and they turned out perfect.

Both times I tried these, the center was not moist enough. I cut down the amount of sugar in the filling, so I'll blame myself for the lack of sweetness. They were beautiful, they just needed more moisture. Also, they nearly burnt on the bottem both times.

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and did have some problems. The first batch of dough did not rise and I had to throw it out. I have no idea why. The second batch rose correctly. As one reviewer suggested, I premixed the filling materials in one bowl, but then  it was lumpy and dry and wouldn't spread evenly. I had to soften the mixture in the microwave so it would spread evenly on the dough. I had trouble getting the dough off the wax paper as I was rolling it up, so remember to put enough flour under the dough. The roll made enough cut pieces to fit perfectly in a 9 x 13 pan, which I cooked at 350 for 22 minutes. I then inverted them on a plate. Half were gone within the hour! I did expect them to be gooey-er than they  were, more like a real cinnabon. There was no runny sweetness on the bottom of the pan, but we didn't mind.  My family  actually preferred these to the real thing!

The claim that this recipe is a clone of a Cinnabon, is absolutely true! I had a very difficult time getting the dough to rise, but after several hours of patience and working with different temperatures, if finally did. The only change I would recommend is to make a little extra frosting (maybe 1 1/2 the amounts the recipe calls for) Also, did not have a problem with cinnamon mixture running out of the buns - maybe they just need to be rolled fairly snug. Thanks for this amazing recipe - well worth the work!!!

I don't know what I can say about these that hasn't already been said. I just wanted to add to the bunch of reviews that these are fantastic! The daycare kiddos that I take care of helped me make these and this was so fun for us all to make and everyone just gobbled them up before you could say 'cinnabon'. I gave some to their parents and they couldn't stop talking about how good they were too. Everyone now thinks I'm like this super baker lol!! Yummy yum yum!

Easy, excellent rolls.  Definitely worth the trouble.  I am freezing them (before last rise) and giving them to my neighbors for Christmas!

I have been a long time user of All Recipes but this is the recipe that made me take the time to write my first review!  In one word, AMAZING!  Cinnamon bun recipes can be hit or miss but this one is spot on.  The dough was a beautiful consistency to work with, practically no sticking at all, easy to shape.  And the buns themselves were the piece de résistance!  Truly a Cinnabon clone; tender, gooey, and yummy.  Thanks for posting a great recipe.

I'm not very skilled when it comes to baked goods, I have egg issues, but these were amazing!  Nobody could believe that I made them! I have a wood stove and placed the dough near it to rise.  I baked them at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes.  Also, I didn't make the icing because I don't like icing on cinnamon rolls.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Absolutely amazingly worth the work! I didn't have the right pan so I used a large spring-form pan for some and a large glass baking pan which had rounded corners - I won't use this type of pan again since the outside rolls were cooked and golden and the inside weren't (however, even undercooked were delicious!) I also wanted to try this recipe so badly  and I didn't have a rolling pin but I just stretched as best as I could; would be much easier with a good marble rolling pin (I asked my  Mom to let me have hers specifically for this recipe!) Oh yes, I did mix the butter, cinnamon and brown sugar all together and spread it on instead of sprinkling.

Wow!  That's all I can say.  Just plain delicious.  I made these ahead of time to bring to my in laws for Thanksgiving morning.  My only regret it that I couldn't serve them fresh baked and warm out of the oven.  They were heavenly and everyone loved them, just as they are.  Bravo!

These are easy and wonderful! The first time I made them I undercooked them. After that I began looking for the center of the rolls to spiral up to take them out of the oven-perfect. Also, I use dental floss to cut the rolls.

1 word: AWESOME. 

I don't have a bread machine so I made these guys by hand using some of the tips from the other reviewers. These things rose up big, and were very tasty. 

I ommitted the cream cheese for the icing---definitely double-up on the icing!

I'll be making these again sometime and altering the recipe a bit...maybe add some chopped nuts of some sort to the filling in the middle.

I don't think I could add much more to what has already been written...FANTASTIC!!

I did use a sifter to apply the cinnamon and brown sugar mix to the rolled and buttered dough. It worked really well, nice even coating. Just mix the two well before you put it in the sifter.
This recipe is a keeper...

I didn't care much for cinnamon rolls, until now! Light and fluffy and big! I baked then on a jelly roll pan and made sure that they would touch when they rose. I pulled them out of the oven before they browned to make sure they would stay soft. Delicious, but dangerous!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and his brothers and they raved about it.  Even his picky younger brother fell in love with the soft roll and amazing frosting.  I used a bread machine but let the dough rise in the oven.  Heat your oven to 200 degress and turn it off and place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a moist towel.  Leave for about an hour to double in size.  I followed previous advice and added 1/4 granulated sugar to the filling and increased the butter and cinnamon as well for ample filling.  I lined my baking pan with a sheet of parchment paper to make removal easier.  I let them rise again in the oven for about a half hour.  Baking the rolls at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes produced wonderfully golden moist buns.  I had no need to double the frosting recipe.  My boyfriend wants to know when I can make it again and says "You were wrong.  It's better then a Cinnabon"  You can't beat that!!!

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made, though not the best I've had. I took the rolls out at 15 minutes and they were not done, very doughy in the middles. But still good! They are so rich that my siblings didn't even finish their whole roll, which isn't usual at all.

I substituted brown sugar instead of the white sugar, butter instead of the margarine, and Neufchâtel instead of the cream cheese. These are the best cinnamon buns anyone who's tasted them has ever had. Amazing!

This makes a perfect dough. The baking time is also right on. I wasnt all impressed with the filling, I might change it a bit, but my search for a great cinnamon bun dough recipe has come to an end. Thanks!

Great! Was fun the make! I Made the bake time/temp adjustments as others suggested. They weren't as moist as I would like but still the best homemade cinni rolls I've ever had!  I was a bit too modest with the confect sugar for the topping and hence my husband said the topping was a little too "cream cheese" for him (but he still loved them).  So next time I will follow the topping directions exactly.

Awesome!  I did take some of the suggestions and cook them at 350 for 22 minutes, and they were perfectly cooked and just golden brown.  Pay attention to the frosting--the cream cheese amount is only 3 ounces (a small cream cheese package)--not the traditional 8 oz package that I usually buy.  It probably would have been good either way, but I caught that just as I was about to throw the whole thing in.

These were the best cinnamon buns ever!  I have tried many recipes over the years, and they all lacked something.  These are just incredible! A little time consuming, but the end product definitely worth it.

I took this recipe to my MOPS group and everyone loved it. I accidently used 1 1/3 cup margarine though, and it tasted great. I also used the suggestion of another reviewer about using the wax paper to line your pan and doubling the frosting. I deffinitly will make this again.

This recipe was wonderful!  It is the best cinnamon roll recipe that I have ever made before.  It is better than the ones you get in the mall.  The dough was very easy to roll out and work with.  I am definatly going to make this again.

These were really, really wonderful!  I followed the advice of some previous reviews and baked them at 350F for 20 minutes, and also flipped the pan over onto a tray after they were done, to allow the yummy filling to ooze back over them.  If you are looking for a good cinnamon roll recipe don't skip this one, it will definitely be my cinnamon roll recipe from now on!!

Made these last night, and after serving them to company, had to make more today! This time I made them smaller, which made more of them. Still had to bake 15 minutes though. Freezing this batch to thaw individually when I need a cinnamon fix. So great!

These were so good and so easy to make.  I will be making these again and again.  I wasn't sure if 15 minutes would be enough to cook them all the way through and was a little afraid that they would be uncooked in the middle, but they were perfect.  Stick with the 15 min. I'm glad I did.

As amazing as all the reviews state. Wonderful dough out of the breadmaker - too easy!  Added raisins to one half for hubby and pecans on the other half for me. Next time might try to integrate the caramel base of the Cinnamon Rolls I recipe.

Made this recipe twice now and both times it was perfect.  Didn't use the cream cheese icing, believe it or not my kids don't like anything too sweet.  Piped a bit of plain sugar icing instead.  Took some of the second batch to work and they raved over them.

Ok not sure what happened but my dough was a sticky mess so bad I almost threw it out,but I couldnt because it was stuck to my hands, but after adding more flour(like 2/3 cup) and kneading it I was able to work with it. The final outcome was good however not like cinnabon it was equally as good but different. Also I miss read the time and baked for 25 min they were still good....

This recipe was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls.  They were great!--the first time!  I made them again today but my dough didn't rise as it should.  The first time I dissolved the yeast in the milk and added the sugar to the yeast/milk mixture, then proofed it.  This time I dissolved the yeast in just milk and proofed it before adding it to the sugar, egg, salt, etc. mixture.

Wow, these are simply amazing. The only difference is I bake them at 350 for 30 minutes. I've had this recipe for six weeks and I've made them 12 times so far. They turn out perfect every time. This is the perfect recipe for Cinnamon rolls.

Best cinnamon roll recipe ever...hands down!  I have been using this recipe for four years and have always received rave reviews from everyone who tastes them.

These are very good. I made them with the dough hook on my mixer instead of the bread machine. They do not remind me of Cinnabons at all, but they do remind me of my Grandma's homemade cinnamon buns at Christmas. Cinnabon's filling have a gooey texture that I think you need chemical ingredients to make :) 
..besides, these have to be better for you!!

I thought this was pretty easy to make. I  followed others suggestions to lower temp. to 350 and bake for 20 minutes, but mine still came out really gooy, so I will try it at the temp it states next time. These tasted good, but not the best I've had.

These were soooo delicious!  My husband ate three in one day and anyone that I had over that had one said it was the best dessert/breakfast I have ever made...and I bake a lot!  Thanks so much!  This will stay in the family...I may keep the recipe as a secret for a while though!

Oh my....these are amazing! I was born and raised in the USA and now live in the UK. These reminded me of all of the mall trips I used to have with friends as a teenager. Now I was able to introduce by British Hubby to an American tradition. You are simply a genuious!

I've been making these yummy cinnamon rolls for 2 years now. Everyone thinks that I have the best cinnamon rolls in the world and that Cinnabon is a sad comparison! My favorite part is the frosting, yum!

Right on. So very greatful that the hard work was done by a bread machine.  They turned out so good.  I have a 2 year old, a 9 month old, and 4 months pregnant with our third, and I STILL had time for these.  Thank you for a new tradition in our home.

These are the best!! I get requests all the time to make these.  Takes a while, but well worth the wait.  You could do what I do and cut the dough in fourths and make a bunch of mini-bons and people go crazy!! Better than those frozen ones and definitely just as good, if not better, than cinnabon!

A little extra work without a breadmaker, but very delicious! I do not agree with some of the other reviewers about doubling the frosting. It was WAY too much that way and too rich. I would have preferred the original frosting recipe. Oh well, next time!

Very good. I liked the frosting. I thought the dough was a little heavier than what I usually use (usually good ol' Betty Crocker), but the frosting and extra gooey filling made these rolls!

These were a hit.  They were really good.  The rolls were a little tough, though- I think I'll try them again sometime and make the dough by hand (not in the bread machine) to try for a lighter texture.

I think this is the best recipe that I have gotten from this site. The dough is really easy to work with. We cut the rolls using dental floss and it worked beautifully. My family eats these up in no time! I can't make enough to keep them around. Thanks SO much for this recipe.

Wow!  If you want to make everyone rave about your cooking ability, just make these!  Warning:  They will not last long.  The only thing that I would do different is to cook them in a larger pan or in two pans so they can spread more.

Very good, and very well received by everyone!

My tip is to make sure the butter for the filling is softened (microwave for no longer than 10 seconds for butter that isn't frozen) and not melted.  I used melted butter for my first batch and when I rolled the dough, it kind of squeezed out the sides making quite a (delicious) mess!

I made the dough the day before and let it 2nd rise overnight in the fridge (per other's recommendation's) and that turned out great!  I made the frosting the day before as well and it was quite good.

My first time making homemade rolls.  It took overnight to rise after rolling them out and putting them in the pan.  Cooked them 15 minutes in my new oven (checked temp and it was accurate) and they seemed overdone/dry to me.  The dough doubled in size in the pan, but didn't rise again after rolling them out.

I made these cinnabons for the first time on Easter morning. I followed the recipe exactly, but my first batch of six buns came out burnt after only 12 minutes of being into the oven. The next batch I cut the time down to 10 minutes at 400, and they did turn out much better. Next time I will try a 350 oven. The hotter over just made the bottom burnt.

The perfect cinnamon roll.  Soft roll, gooey filling, and cream cheese frosting!  The total effect is s little over powering though...very rich and sweet.  You can only eat one (which is probably a good thing...)

Sinfully delicious! The whole family loved. I doubled the frosting as suggested. Had a little trouble with the rising, but I used regular yeast and made it in the KitchenAid. Definitely a "new favorite" as my hubby says.

I was so excited when these came out perfect! I've never been able to get cinnamon rolls to work out right and these were awesome! I did a caramel roll instead of the cream cheese frosting, but they disappeared just as quickly! Thanks for sharing!

My husbands favorite cinnamon roll recipe... I have tried many that he has never quite been satisfied with... but this one he looks forward to eating every time... I half the recipe and make it in a 8x8 pan... then for the frosting I add 3 Tbsp of cream cheese. A 3 oz pckg of cream cheese is equal to 6 Tbsp. One 8 oz pkg. of cream cheese is 1 cup, which is 16 Tbsp.. (each 1/4 cup is 4 Tbsp) so an easy way to measure it is score the block in half... and then in half again... then you have 4-1/4 cup portions... the if you need Tbsps... just score those 1/4 cup portions into 4. This also works for the 1/2 cup cubes of margarine or butter.

Excellent roll, although I didn't think it tasted EXACTLY like a Cinnabon.
My first time making cinnamon rolls, and I will definitely do it again.  It's just a lot more work than I wanted it to be!

Very tasty.  Not Cinnabons but close.  The center of the buns tasted more like a cinnabon whereas the outer layer was a bit tough.  I lowered the temperature to 350 per other reviews and baked for 25 min.  The middle buns seemed doughy so I put them back in 5 min longer.  The top of the buns looked great but underneath burned a little and was too crispy.  Maybe a glass pan would be better.  Delicious right out of the oven.  Thanks.

I have never had a Cinnabon before, but with all the five stars I was expecting something amazing.  Maybe I did something wrong, but mine came out dense with little flavor to the dough and the icing was so sweet,I had to scrape off.  My kids didn't even eat a whole one. I ended up tossing out the rest.  So disappointing.

These were very good, but terribly sweet.  I didn't have a bread machine but made like any other yeast dough. I think that cutting down on the sugar in the filling would be a good idea.  Still a good treat for once a year though....maybe Christmas morning.

Wow! These are great! I took the advise of others and rolled them out on an oiled surface instead of floured - worked so well! Also, I formed them the night before and covered the pan with plastic wrap. Next morning, allowed them to warm up to room temperature for about 45 minutes and then baked them. Terrific! Guess what we will be having next Christmas morning....

I made these last night and the dough did not rise quickly like so many of you have said.  Even let it sit in the oven all night and it still needed to rise more; hence, the dough was real tough and the finished rolls were tough.  I like to think that I am a good baker, (I make homemade breads and rolls all the time!)so I started on another batch this morning,and this dough is still not rising and seems real heavy and tough!  I don't have a bread machine, but carefully followed the advice of previous reviews.  I even tested the temperature of the milk before adding the yeast.  I would like to know if anyone else has the same problem.  My own cinnamon roll recipe dough is much softer and rises nicely.  I really would like to adapt to this recipe because I can see where they could definitely taste like cinnabons, but don't know what else to do. Any help out there?

Awsome recipe.  I have been making this for a few years - I originally got this recipe from Todd Wilbur's More Top Secret Recipes.  If you love Cinnabon cinnamon rolls then you will love these rolls.  Make the dough in your bread machine and they are hardly any work at all :0)  Thanks for posting this recipe!

OUTSTANDING! I can't get over how awesome these cinnamon rolls are! EASY too! My husband's grandmother used to make "the best" cinnamon rolls around and I never hoped to top them. But even he admits these rolls are fabulous. Everyone loves them. THANK YOU for this recipe! LOVE IT!

These were the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made.  I used my KitchenAid mixer and they turned out wonderfully.  My family wasn't too crazy for the icing, but I loved it!

Awesome buns, but only for a treat. Definitely not weight watchers friendly, but what yummy thing is? One bun burns up nearly half my daily points! Still, yum. :)

Absolutly delicious! I love cinnamon buns and I can't beleive how good these homemade buns are! So easy to make even if it is a little time consuming but they're definitely worth the time!
One tip, make sure you use a baking sheet with sides as the gooey sugary goodness tends to drip everywhere leaving one messy oven!
Definitely a keeper!

These buns were very good and addictive.  I had to bring the rest to work so I wouldn't eat anymore.  I do think these buns are very sweet.  I will not use as much brown sugar the next time.  For a lower cal bun you could omit the icing; I think that is the killer.  

I think some people may have had problems with the buns not rising or turning out because when I followed the recipe and added ingredients to the bread machine I added the liquid stuff first then the flour and as I am putting the salt on top I thought...hmmm...if the yeast gets in contact with the salt it won't rise, I mixed in in best I could with the flour and sugar.  So I suggest mixing the salt in with the water first.  
Also I will need about 20 min next time to cook buns all the way through.  The middle ones were a tad doughy.
I have made cinnimon buns in the past and it was an all day event this recipe is great because it is only about 1 hour in the kitchen and your done.  I will always let my bread machine do all the dirty work from now on.

The best cinnamon rolls I've ever made!  Thanks for a really great recipe.  I made these for all of the fathers in our outreach ministry at church.  Everyone loved them-all of the kids kept stealing daddy's cinnamon rolls!  The only change I made was to add a little more cream cheese to the frosting.  I'll make this many times I'm sure.

What can I say?  YUM!!!! I live in a house with three males - my first batch of these (made yesterday) made 19 buns and they are almost gone already!  I did forget to put the brown sugar in with the cinnamon and sugar for the middle, but they still taste FANTASTIC!!!  I bet I'll be asked to make another batch this weekend.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Dangerously addicitng--especially if you are pregnant and have a lull in morning sickness! :-) I tried this recipe twice. The first time the rolls in the middle of the pan were a tad doughy and all of them rose up HUGE, so the second time I cut 16 pieces instead, squeezed them into the pan and didn't rise them as long. Much better! After baking I transferred them to a cookie sheet and broke them apart to allow the icing to run down the sides. Fabulous!

This is an easy way to make cinnamon rolls. I've made them many times "kneeding by hand" and it's work! The breadmachine takes the hard work out of it, and they come out great! I followed the recipe closely, but I did use another reviewer's "overnight" in the fridge idea. I just followed the steps to get them in the 9x13 pan and then covered them and put them in the fridge. The next morning I let them sit out for 30 minutes and then put them in a 200 degree oven for a few minutes and then cooked them in a convection oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. They're excellent!

Taste was great, but i could NOT get these to bake correctly... i put them in for over an HOUR and the centers never baked.... the tops and corners were great.. but the centers were gooey and doughy. I think if i ever do this again i would put them on a flat baking sheet and leave space between each, or put them in muffin cups. BUT i would use this recipe

I have been making these for about 3 or 4 years. Each time I make them they get better and better. My Bread Machine has never gotten more use. These are so incredible. I now use the Cinnamon from Cinnabon to make them and you would never believe how WONDERFUL they taste!

I made these exactly as written, and they were excellent. I did double the frosting mix, per other reviews, and ended up with over half of it leftover, so I don't think the frosting needs doubled.  I melted the butter and mixed it with the brown sugar/cinnamon/nuts mixture, and it was easier to spread around. I cooked it at 350* for 30 minutes.  The neighbor kids and my kids devoured them!!!

These were fabulous.  Definitely the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made.  Unfortunately, I tripled the butter in the filling accidentally... and discovered that they tasted exactly like cinnabon!  Next time I'll try making half according to recipe and half with the extra butter.

Great recipe.  I used my bread machine, assembled the cinnamon rolls the night before then in the morning set them out for about an hour and baked like normal.  They turned out soft and fluffy!  Will definitely make again!

Awesome!!...It is worth the work and the extra wait (it does take longer for this dough to rise so be patient).  The icing is "to die for"!  Much better than the powdered sugar/milk mixture I would have made.

Easy to make and very nice presentation.  My husband thought they were fabulous!  I thought they were better than average, but I felt like they were missing something.  Maybe a little more salt to cut down on the sugar?  I don't know, but I will definately make it again.

These are really good, but no different or better than most other cinnamon roll recipes.  I think people just get excited about this one because there's a brand name in the title.

These are delicious! They are almost identical to Cinnabon's! I made the suggested icing, and then also tried the recipe with regular cream cheese frosting. Both my husband and I prefered the cream cheese frosting because it has a lot less butter, and is less rich.

These are so good! I am going to try to reduce the fat in them next time, but the taste was just like some of my favorite cinnamon buns! I didn't change a thing (but next time will cook for longer at a low temperature). Just as good reheated!

Amazing recipe!!  Everyone loves these cinnamon rolls. Too bad they are so fattening or we would have them more often, plus they are a lot of work and a big mess to clean up!  That alone will stop me from making these too often.   Still 5 stars for how good they taste!

No Cinnabons where I live, so this was worth a shot.  Totally delicious!  I even used it to help my daughter's 5th grade class learn about yeast.  They got to eat their project! The dough isn't quite as sweet as Cinnabon's, but it's pretty dog-gone close!

I don't like cinnabon's, but decided to try these for the huge reviews they got. I figured many people like them, so maybe I need to give it another try. These were ok, but so sweet they almost hurt. I mixed everything by hand, and I imagine they would turn out much lighter and fluffier with a mixer or bread machine. Oh well, the workplace I took them to ate them all, so I suppose even a dense cinnabon is good.

OK, I had to come back and give this recipe 5 stars.  I left the review below after the 1st time I made these, but I have made them about a dozen times since then and they are fantastic.  Forget what I said before.  A Million stars for this recipe.  Love them!!!!!

These rolls were great.  The dough was just a tad not sweet enough, but I have a pretty good sweet tooth.  My husband loved them and took the batch to work with him.  This was actually the first recipe I tried in my new bread machine, and I'll make them again for sure.  Thanks for a great recipe Marsha!  I followed the directions exactly and they turned out perfect.  Hardly any work at all.  I love technology!

Yummy!  While these were definitely more effort than I usually make for breakfast, they were a very nice treat.  I don't have a bread machine, so I mixed up the dough by hand and then put them in the fridge overnight.  Took them out early the next morning to rise and they were very fluffy and very good.

These were wonderful.  I made them sticky buns by melting 1c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. butter and 2T. light corn syrup in the bottom of the pan before the final rising step.  They tasted great, but I had to bake them a little longer to get the center rolls done.  In the future, I will put them on a jelly roll pan and spread them out a little bit so they bake more evenly.

All the great reviews are right, these are terrific.  I added raisins to the sugar mixture and will make again this way.  I followed another reviewer's advice and mixed the sugar, butter, and cinnamon together and spread on the rolled dough. It was not easy to spread out the mixture, but I do think it helped keep the cinnamon and sugar from leaking out the ends of the rolls.  Don't worry if you can't spread out the mixture very evenly.  When the rolls cook the mixture spreads out.

everybody loved these! moist and gooey just like a cinnamon roll should be.
i baked mine for a little longer than 15 minutes, but thats just because my oven is like that. also, i was pressed for time so i microwaved store-bought cream cheese frosting and poured that all over the cinnamon rolls straight from the oven. delicious!

I made these for breakfast a few days ago for my full extended family. Everyone LOVED them - my uncle even said they were the best cinnamon rolls he'd ever had. The only things I'd change - double the frosting, and use margarine in it (or less butter) because otherwise it tastes very strongly of butter; mix the cinnamon, sugar, and butter for the middle together before spreading them on the dough so it doesn't all melt out; and cook them an extra five minutes at 350 degrees instead of 400. They come out just perfectly this way!

Very easy to make, although I did not use a bread machine, it was still easy.  The cinnabons turned out better than the orginal.  I will make these (very) often.

My daughter raved about these. Definitely NOT for the calorie conscious. Mine were popping right out of the pan. You could probably cut them a little smaller and make more. The frosting makes them! YEOW!

I get thumbs up everytime I make these! Recently, I decided to try making chocobon (does any one know how to make these?) so I added about 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips (I didn't have chocolate at hand),instead of the 2 1/2 tbps of ground cinnamon, and they turned out to be AWESOME!

My family really likes these. When i don't have time in the morning. I use tube cinnamon rolls and the icing from this recipe. They aren't as good as this recipe, but works in a pinch.

Like a previous reviewer I tried this recipe with my Kitchenaid mixer. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I was pretty nervous when the dough wasnt rising, but figured since I had spent the money on the ingredience I should bake them anyway. Imagine my surprise when after 25 minutes of cooking I found 12 deliciously plumped up fluffy rolls! 
Next time, rather than squishing them together in a 9x13 I will spread them out on a cookie sheet to allow each one to rise and brown evenly on all sides.
I gave this recipe 5 stars because my husband ate three rolls as fast as I could get the glaze on them. However, after all the great reviews I expected some kind of earth shattering taste but turns out for me  they were really just eh...cinnamon rolls.

I am new to using a bread machine and had never made cinnamon rolls until trying this recipe.  If I can make them successfully, anyone can!  Everyone LOVED them, even my picky husband who is a great Cinnabon fan.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Marsha =)

Yes!  I craved these all through my pregnancy, so I spent a lot of time at the local mall.  I can now make them at home and eat them until I look pregers.  I did bake them @ 350F in the convection for 20 mins. They came out perfect. Yum!  Thanks Marsha (I think)

Excellent! I made these on Xmas Eve to enjoy on Xmas morning.  Followed another reader's suggestion and let them rise in the fridge overnight and then brought them to room temperature in the morning, baked and then iced.  Yum!

Awesome! I half the recipe, used all purpose flour-sifted, and made by hand-no bread machine. Baked it for a shorter time around 20 min cos it browns fast.Yields 8 very fluffy and delicious rolls even without the frosting! My husband loves it! Thanks.

This recipe is amazing. The Cinnabons are delicious! Everyone who has tried them loves them.

I found two small adjustments I prefer on this recipe, however. The frosting was a little to cream-cheesy for my taste, so I added more confectioner's sugar to make it sweeter. Also, one day I had no light brown sugar, so I used dark brown sugar with more cinnamon. Also, with more cinnamon, the cream-cheesier frosting nicely balanced it all out.

Excellent recipe!

I made these with company over... let's just say that these are the BOMB!!!  Absolutely to inhale slowly, and savor each and every bite!  Fantastic, I'll no longer need to buy cinnamon rolls for a ton of money. These were easy and fun to prepare, too.  Next time I do think I'll cut down the brown sugar a little bit, though.

Forgot to add that I mixed these up & assembled them Friday night - then brought them to room temp Saturday morning and popped them in the oven! The whole family loved these, even heated up the next day. Husband says they're the "best homemand cinnamon rolls ever." Make extra icing.  I was a little nervous cuz the dough seemed really stiff, but they were great.  A keeper.

These are absolutely fabulous! Since I have a older Black and Decker Bread Machine thatI received in 1995, my machine could not handle the 4 1/2 cups flour, therefore I had to scale it down to a yield of 8, but managed to bake 12 at the end.  I had to try this recipe three times before it worked on my dough machine. Just a note for you cooks out there that have a older machine. This recipe is worth investing a new bread maker.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was a great cinnamon bun, but only when it was still hot/warm. Once it cooled, it hardened into a rock. I found that it rolled too thin and maybe next time I will roll into a smaller rectangle than suggested, just for a little more thicker 'cinnabon', the icing was good but needed about half a cup more confectioner's sugar. Over all, I don't think it deserves a 5 star rating, more of a 3 and a half to 4.

Very close to cinnabon. I loved the frosting. Bake close together so they don't separate.

These are so good!  They are 95% cinnabon!  I let them rise for a really long time- like 4 hrs- on the second rise- and they were huge and gooey and perfect!  I won't make another cinnamon roll recipe ever again!

I made this for my Sunday School class this morning and I got TONS of "Wows!!" Lots of people asked for the recipe claiming these cinnamon rolls were JUST like the CINNABONS!! And the icing ROCKED! I followed the recipe to the "t" however I opted to mix all ingredients together in a bowl (making sure the eggs are room temp and the milk is at least 110 degrees)instead of using a bread machine. It's true the dough puts up a fight at first, but hang in there and it will eventually give when rolling it out!  My kids LOVED helping and the cinnamon rolls were simply BEAUTIFUL!  Time consuming, yep, but WELL worth it!

These are the best!!! I've been looking for the perfect cinnamon roll recipe and this is it.  I've never had a Cinnabon, but if they're this good no wonder every one loves them!!!!! The only changes I've made in this recipe is after I roll it up jelly roll style I trim the ends to make them look prettier, and I add a drop or two of butter flavoring to the frosting!!!!!

This was a pretty good recipe, but not quite as good as I was expecting. The dough was easy to make without a bread machine which was a plus.  I didn't think that the cinnamon flavor was strong enough.  Next time I'll definately add more.  The icing is delicious.  A good overall recipe, just needs a bit a tweeking.

This recipe was AWSOME! I took the advice of another reviewer and melted the butter and combined it with the brown sugar and cinnamin and brushed it on to the dough, it came out GREAT! I also sifted the flour into the bread machine and the dough came out very silky. At first I saw some reviews about cinnamon rolls III and I tried that recipe first, but it was way too sweet, so I tried this one and it was just what I was looking for. I don't think I have found one that was this close to a cinnabon so I'm going to stay with this one.

Made a batch - and I must admit, this was an afternoon dedicated to the kitchen, but oh man it was worth it. I made a batch last night for this morning's breakfast to wake up to all of them being eaten by my roommates.  They are begging me for more.

FIVE stars just isn't enough for these!!!  One week ago, my husband and I ate a Cinnabon, and when my husband tried these, he said "OH MY GOSH, that is EXACTLY like a Cinnabon!!"  It's true, and these are extremely awesome.  My mom said, "Those aren't Cinnabons, they're better!" I've made other "clone" recipes before, but this one truely is the same thing.  

I don't have a "bread maker," but instead a mixer that has dough hooks, and that's how I made them.  I used fast rise yeast, and combined it with the dry ingredients.  I mixed (separately from the dry ingredients) the melted butter with the warm milk, then I put in the eggs, and added all that to the dry ingredients.  The dough hooks worked great; I "kneaded" with those for 6 minutes.

I sprayed a large glass bowl with cooking spray, and let it rise in a heated oven (I put it on the "warm" setting).
One thing that was strange for me was that it took so long to rise, both times.  Don't know why...anyway, I will surely make these again and again and again!

Turned out so-so....definitely not up to my expectations.  If you're REALLY looking for Cinnabon, try the Cinnamon Rolls I recipe, but use this frosting on them...now THEY'RE da bomb!!

quite a bust for Christmas morning.  They were fine but to call them a "clone of a cinnabon" is a major stretch.  I had high hopes, but oh, well.

The frosting was just like the real thing. whip it up for a long time until it's nice and fluffy. I have a kitchen Aid that I just turned on and walked away until it was light as a cloud. YUM! I used the roll recipe from Cinnamon rolls III but this frosting recipe was better.

I made this as a special treat for my husband on Valentine's Day. They are very rich and so delicious. I haven't had a Cinnabon, so I can't compare, but these cinnmon rolls are something special. I don't have a bread machine, so I combined the yeast and all the wet ingredients in my mixer first, then added the flour and salt. The dough was really easy to work with, too. Great recipe.

These were excellent -- taste just like the Cinnabon ones.  The only issue that came up was that my husband said he tasted something "bitter" in a couple of bites.  So, I'm guessing that some of the cinnamon didn't get mixed real well w/ the sugar and butter.  It seemed like an awful lot of cinnamon/sugar mixture, so just make sure it's mixed well and that there's plenty of butter all over the dough.  They're awesome!

These were GREAT!  Close enough to a mall cinnamon roll that DH loved them!  I've made them three times in the past few weeks... I loved that the dough came out almost rubbery from the machine... VERY easy to work with.

Absolutely Fabulous! Made the dough and refrigerated it overnight and made the rolls the next day. Great and Easy! I cooked just a few minutes longer. Highly recommended.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  The glaze reminds me of the filling of a cream cheese kolache.  Very rich and extremely good.  My husband and kids ate this up like nobody's business.

Yummmmmmmyyyy! I will never by the refridgrated dough again. This is so easy! There is no way that I would ever go to Cinnabon due the cost of each roll, this way I can get all the rolls I want! I made these for my husbands Sunday School Class, and the kids ate them all. 

I did change the cooking temp due to the other reviews, worked out great! I didn't add the topping since the rolls were already sweet enough, and the kids don't need all that extra sugar, maybe for the adults!

Thanks for the recipe!

These were good.  I like the icing recipe for these and the dough recipe for CINNAMON ROLLS III.  That combination tasted more like the authetic Cinnabons.

I'm not a HUGE fan of sweets but I'll eat them if they are worth the calories.  These are absolutely worth the calories and taste just like the mall Cinnabons.  Fabulous!  Thanks, Marsha!  Jul 12, 2003

I have never made cinnamon buns before, and this turned out amaaaazing!!!  It was nice and soft like the ones you buy at Cinnabon!!  I used whole wheat flour instead of regular all-purpose, and it still turned out great!!  I have made this twice, and I found 2nd time did not turn out well - be to make sure to let it sit in a warm place to rise!

They tasted ok, and the icing was really good. But I had some major problemes with them. First, they didn't stick to each other in the oven, so they ended up looking like "C"s. I think it was because of too much butter. All of the cinnamon sugar melted of the rolls and I ended up with "C"s in a pool of hard cinnamon sugar. I won't make them again because I seem to have very bad luck with all the cinnamon rolls I've ever made.

Loved this recipe!  Super easy w/ bread machine. I never have good luck getting breads to rise, but didn't have any problems with this one.  The only thing i didn't care for was the cream cheese frosting.  Hubby & I thought it was too rich for these, so I made another batch using regular buttercream frosting. Inlaws were very impressed!  will defintely make again!

These were great! Couple things-although the cinnamon roll itself didn't taste exactly like Cinnabon, the frosting was a dead on hit! I had a small problem with all the cinnamon/sugar mixture running down to the bottom of the cinnamon roll, so the inside wasn't as gooey and cinnamon/sugary as I hoped. I think I just need to roll the dough tighter, and I could cut back on the butter a tad. I did have to add a little more cinnamon sugar mixture. They were a huge hit, and will be my forever cinnamon roll recipe!

These came out good, I dont know what the other people are talking about with doubling the cinnamon/brown sugar filling, its very sweet as is! For some reason my dough did not double, so I just went along with the recipe anyway and they came out good, This is a good recipe but you cant eat too much cause they are so sweet!

By far my best recipe find ever!!  If you are a Cinnabon junkie, you will LOVE this recipe.  I took the advice to turn down heat & cook 20 min & they came out perfect.  The icing was a little sweet for me, so I just cut it with a little more butter the second time.  My advice -  make sure you buy the big bags of flour, brown sugar & confectioners sugar, because I am already ready to make my 3rd batch, and I have run out of supplies!!

We are cinnabon junkies!  3 components: 1.the bread/pastry part--I adapted to non-bread machine method, apparently not successfully enough, so not fair to rate. 2.icing was nearly dead on clone!  3.brown sugar/cinnamon filly--not nearly enough to remind me of cinnabon's ooey-gooey filling.  overall, much better than other recipes I've tried, but I'll have to hold off trying it again until I get my bread machine back :)

Very good Cinnamon bun. A little denser than I would have liked, but we enjoyed them.

These were VERY good and VERY easy. The last time I made cinnamon rolls they were a disaster, but these turned out perfect. Loved the frosting. I took others advice and turned the heat down to 375.

I have made them several times and everyone just loves them....thank you so much Marsha for sharing!  Personally I think they are better than the nationally known Cinnabons!

These are so yummy.  They are relatively easy to make, but take awhile because of the rising. I've made them several times, and its really hard to screw them up, they still taste good no matter what you do wrong!

This is a good, basic cinnamon roll recipe.  I wouldn't say it was a clone of a Cinnabon, but it is a fair start.  These dry out quickly- the next time I make them I am going to work in some honey to try to keep them moister longer.  I added cloves and other spices to mine and they were quite tasty.  I think they are sweet enough without the frosting, but my husband wants the icing!!!

This was an outstanding recipe!!!  It does taste exactly like the Cinnabon rolls.  I have an old breadmaker, so it took FOREVER to mix and rise.  These were gone almost as soon as they came out of the oven.  I did double the frosting recipe and I recommend that.

This was an awsome recipy. I don't have a bread machine, so used quick rise yeast and some bread baking knowlage to get the first part done. My family loved it! Because all oven temp. vary I found 400 degrees was a little high. I used 375. Thanks for the wonderful recipy!

Excellent recipe!  I agree with prior reviews that it needs to be baked at a lower temp for longer.  I used 350 degrees for about 20 minutes and it came out great.  If you have a lot of people, make a double batch because they'll be begging for more.

These were excellent!!  This is the first bread recipe I've made.  I made the cinnabons up to the baking part, refrigerated them over night and then baked them in the morning.  I'll try them again baking the same day, but I can't imagine them tasting any better.  They taste just like a cinnabon!

Yummy! Yummy! I did this with my stand mixer and had wonderful results.  I agree that 3/4 cup of the brown sugar mixture is sufficient.  I spaced the rolls so that they cooked in the middle.  After I finished icing them, my middle son smelled the rolls, took one long look at his brothers and barked, "MINE!"  Thanks, Marsha.

While I thought these tasted good, mine didn't turn out anything like the real thing in terms of texture and flavor. The filling could be goopier and my dough turned out on the dry side. though, some of this may be because I'm doing it the "old-fashioned" way (no bread machine). Also, for those of us not into cheese: lemon extract and margerine can be used in place of cream cheese :)

These are what everyone says they are --delicious.  I baked at 375 for 20 minutes in glass pan. Mine were cooked through and even a bit over done.  Also, since I hadn't made cinnamon rolls in 20 years, I forgot to turn them out of the pan while still warm so all the goo is on the top!  Mine stuck to the pan!  Nothing a little rewarming couldn't fix though.

These were the easiest cinnamon rolls I have ever made and were they DELICIOUS!  My husband is not a big "sweets" fan and he's had several rolls!  These are just as good as the real Cinnabon!  You won't be disappointed :-)

THE BEST!!!! Pretty easy to make up, I have never tried to make cinnamon rolls before, and although it is time consuming, it is WELL WORTH the work! Set aside a saturday morning to do this treat! I didn't use bread machine yeast, I used regular quick rise Fleischmans yeast and it still came out good! I will use the yeast it calls for next time and see the difference.. Thanks MARSHA!!

Delicious! It seemed to take quite a while to rise after rolling them, so the second time I made them I took the dough out before the cycle (1 1/2 hours) was finished and it worked much better.  This recipe is addicting, and the icing is OUTSTANDING! My family LOVES them!

Incredible!  The recipe doesn't say which way to roll the rectangle though.  I rolled it longways, figuring the rolls would be too round to fit in a 9x13 pan the other way and ended up with too many rolls.  I'll try the other way next time.  Dough is super easy to work with.  Double the icing for gobs of gooey calories.

THANK YOU for this recipe.  I thought there was no way these would taste the same as Cinnabon, but they were incredible!  Don't hesitate to try these, they taste EXACTLY the same!

Absolutely scrumptious! I was a little leery of this recipe, considering that I don't have a bread machine. Plus, the last batch of cinn. rolls I made (using another recipe) were a total flop. Well, I decided to take the risk, and I'm so glad I did! These cinnamon rolls really do taste like Cinnabon's! I was a little worried when mine didn't appear to have "doubled" either time, but they eventually puffed up in the oven, and tasted delicious, too. And there was no need to double the icing; I had plenty to spare. Only change I would recommend: 3/4 c. brown sugar works fine, but when you dust the dough rectangle, leave a little margin around the edges. Otherwise, it's kind of tricky getting the edge of the rolled dough to stick to the cinnamon-y side (i.e. my "rounds" kept unravelling).

Ooh la la. Delicious!! The cinnabons rose to the occasion (they doubled in size twice) and were SCRUMPTIOUS. I don't  have a bread machine so used my mixie- but it didn't seem to make any difference. They were yummy. Followed the recipe to the T- there's no need to double the icing, I ended up with more than needed.  I rolled the dough a little thinner and made 18 rolls instead of  12. If you use a clear plastic sheet lined counter, it will be less sticky when rolling the dough. Also placed the cinnabons to bake on a wire rack lined with wax paper (placed in the baking pan), as the first batch got overbrowned and hard when they were dirrectly put on the baking pan.  The tip about using dental floss to cut the dough was very useful. For those of you who didn't get good results the first time, try again- like I did. My first attempt  at making them was a disaster - my fault. I think the proportions I used were wrong. Thanks Marsha.

I have some baking experience but this was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls. Used my KitchenAid stand mixer to mix and knead instead of the bread machine and they turned out great. Woke my 17-year old daughter with a cup of hot chocolate and one of these buns. The smile on her face said everything. Wonderful recipe that everyone enjoyed.

No kidding!  This is exactly like Cinnabon!  Like everyone else, I was skeptical at first, but these came out fantastic.  The dough was very easy to handle too.  My husband said these were even better than Cinnabon since he didn't need to pay $2 for each of them!  Awesome!

I've made this recipe numerous times and it it fabulous. The only problem I encountered was that the tops were overdone while the middle was doughy. (Many of the other reviewers have reported this same problem) I made a double batch last night and I believe I have solved the problem. I baked the rolls at 350 instead of 400 and extended the baking time to  22 minutes. THE WERE PERFECT. I have already noted the change on my copy of the recipe.

I don't have a bread machine. That in mind, I didn't think these rolls would be as good if I made them by hand. Boy, was I wrong! I just used regular yeast and all-purpose flour. They were WONDERFUL! My mom and dad hate it when I bake, but when they tasted these, THEY LOVED IT. They think these rolls are much, MUCH better than Cinnabon. We'll be saving lots of money now! Only problem is that our flour goes away REALLY quickly since it's in such high demand. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!

I've already reviewed this recipe (it's totally fabulous!), but in response to Ellen who wanted to know how many WW points one bun is, it's 12 in the entire bun and 6 for half. (I know the halving sounds like a no-brainer, but sometimes with WW you have to watch out how you halve and double points!)  Good luck!

These are fantastic & they taste just like the mall version. I have made them for several different groups of people and everyone loved them - they were gone in minutes. ** TIP** Don't rush the rising process - let them double in bulk because they really are worth the wait!!

YUMMY!!!  I have made this recipes many times. I have friends that live out of town and when I want to see them I just call and tell them I'm making Cinnamon Buns. They can't drive fast enough. The only warning I have for this recipe is...Watch out...could become additive.

These were great!  Just as good without the frosting!  Next time I'm going to put some sugar on the bottom of the pan and line it with Gladbake so it won't stick.  I had to convert the recipe to Australian measurements and it worked!

I have made sticky buns many times before, but these were the best!  I had extra filling that I couldn't  use, so I would cut back on the cinnamon and sugar that were listed in the recipe.I added chopped pecans to the bottom of the pans, so when I flipped over the pans while still hot, the pecans were on top.I also didn’t use the frosting as they were sweet enough

I have made these dozens of times and love this recipe. One alteration I make is to use a full 8 oz package of cream cheese to double the frosting. We like a little extra frosting on ours. What a treat. My husband cannot get enough of these.

I have yet to make these. However I worked at Cinnabon for two years as a teen and these look legit. Also at Cinnabon they use some sort of lemon flavoring in the icing. Not sure how exactly it can be incorporated amount wise. Personally I will probably squeeze a 1/4 of a lemon into the icing.

I made it as written except I did not use my bread machine. I just let the dough rise (about 1 hour) then rolled it out and continued as written.
The second batch I made, i added raisins. My family loved them! In my oven, it worked out best cooking them on the bottom rack of the oven.

I have made these SO many times over the years. The recipe is awesome and deserves 5 stars as it is. I have also been able to customize it and it remain fantastic. These work up great with or without a bread machine. I've done it both ways. If I am making them by hand, I bump the yeast up to 3 tsp. I love the cream cheese frosting in the recipe, but my son prefers my orange and cardamom glaze.

Made this a few times already. The only thing I do differently is make actual frosting for these instead of glaze. I do so by upping the icing sugar to 4 cups total and it is spread onto the buns when completely cooled. These freeze very well, frosting already on and all. No need to make them in the bread machine. My stand mixer with the hook does all the hard work.

My family devoured these.... delicious and truly did taste like a Cinnabon.I made just as the recipe described, I had quite a bit of extra filling I just couldn't quite squeeze in my dough, but they still had plenty of flavor. I made in a dark metal pan so the edges were just slightly darker than I would have liked so next time may try a glass pan.

I've made this recipe twice now and it is tasty. However, my family gave some negative reviews about the taste the first time and I thought it might be the amount of cinnamon. I only used 2 tsp. the second time and everyone loved it. 2 1/2 tablespoons is way too much cinnamon.

Delicious!! The only changes I would make is adding more butter to the inner mixture and making a paste to spread instead of spreading separately to give that inner gooey effect.

Used this recipe from the Allrecipes Magazine.  Looked it up
on the website and there is differences.  One says use a bread machine and one says oven temperature of 400 degrees, the other 375.  What gives?  Otherwise it's the same recipe.

I’ve made my own version of this recipe without a bread machine. I use AP flour vs bread flour. I use butter instead of margarine and I make a paste of brown sugar, melted butter and a ton of cinnamon for the filling. Use the best cinnamon you can find.

This recipe is awesome! So easy to make up the night before if you want them for breakfast! They turned out beautifully and everyone loved them, plus the house smelled amazing when people were waking up and getting coffee during Thanksgiving weekend. I did make a double batch of frosting though, the single batch just wasn't going to be enough.

Absolutely fantabulous!  As with all cinnamon rolls, I combined the filling together and spread it onto the dough.  This makes less of a buttery mess while not losing out of the buttery taste.

These Cinnabon-wannabe's are absolutely the best things since "Hot Sliced Bread" came into town. LOL I can't remember how many times I have made them. I didn't use a bread machine. I have one, but prefer the other method. Yummy! Try these today. You will be smiling  soon!

Absolute perfection! My husband loves this recipe and it has become a weekly bake. Bake time is amazingly dead on. Sift flour! Also I used a previous suggestion of mixing the filling ingredients together prior spreading it on and rolling the dough . Totally helps not having it seep out. Thank you for this recipe!!!!

I've made this recipe without a breadmaker and with a breadmaker. It is SO much better with a breadmaker (day and night difference in the dough).  I made the recipe exactly as written except I did add extra cinnamon / sugar to the inside and extra frosting on top. I also added a little extra cream cheese and milk to the frosting to thin it out. This is one of the easiest recipes I have made because I just put the ingredients in the breadmaker and pushed the dough button, which saved a lot of time and energy. I think they taste exactly like Cinnabon's rolls.

These turned out so beautifully! I made the exact recipe and did not modify at all. These are a more bread-y cinnamon roll while Paula Deen's recipe is more ooey gooey style. Both delicious and excellent, just different. The edges on this did bake differently (a little browner) so be aware of that.

Fantastic recipe. This was my second time making cinnamon rolls in my life, I am not a baker. I used the dough setting on my bread machine, used butter instead of margarine, active dry yeast and regular flour because it’s all I had in the house. They are absolute perfection and taste just like Cinnabon. Seriously. Not kidding.

My family loved it. I wanted to serve it for brunch so after cutting and putting in the pan, I wrapped in Saran and refrigerated until morning and took it out 3 hours before I wanted to bake it to let it rise etc. It worked beautifully!!! I also used a sour cream and icing sugar drizzle with grated orange zest for a different topping.

i’ve made this recipe so many times!  really easy to make dairy-free with daiya cream cheese, and plant milk. 
sourdough compatible: decrease milk to ¾ of a cup, and flour to 4 cups. add 1 cup of starter, and omit yeast in recipe.

Puffy. Soft. Gooey. Everything you want in a cinnamon bun! I have prepared these the day ahead with great results. I make the dough, form the rolls, and place them in my greased pan, but cover and refrigerate them overnight. They still rise fine. I take them out and let them rest at least 30 minutes before baking.  I also make the dough with buttermilk and 00 or pasty flour (personal preference) and they are just divine!

They were delicious! I adjusted the recipe for 6 servings, and poured a little bit of warm heavy cream over the top before baking, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. I don't have a bread machine so this is what I did: combine warm milk with the yeast and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Then I added the margarine (melted but cooled,) and egg to the milk mixture and lightly mixed them all together. Then I combined all the dry ingredients (for the dough) together and mixed them well. I then added the wet ingredients and combined everything well. I put it in the mixer for about 7 minutes then followed the directions from there. The recipe was a bit vague, so I had to go through before I began, and color coded the different ingredients for the different components. For example, I highlighted the dough ingredients with blue, the filling with orange, and the frosting with yellow. This really helped me. It was my first time making cinnamon rolls, so if I can do it you can too! They tasted very similar to Cinnabon.

Less sugar, or alternative sugar can make powdered sugar out of stevia by using blender. White sugar in dough, necessary for raising etc.

Used the bread machine, sure, but I had no bread flour so I just used the AP I had. Followed the recipe pretty closely. Low on brown sugar so I made my own (1 cup of white sugar and a healthy tablespoon of molasses. I exercised unusual restraint in putting the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter on the rolled dough. I won’t do that again. Lesson learned. Rolled it all up tight, as directed. Ended up with13 rolls after I cut it.

I've made these a few times already, and must not have reviewed them (which is strange, because I usually review everything I make). These are legit! I made as directed, with the exception that mine needed to bake a little longer (about 18 minutes). Really really close to a Cinnabon®.

So good.  It was my first batch ever of cinnamon rolls so I have nothing to which I’d compare them.  Some people are saying to line baking pan with wax paper.  They mean parchment bc wax paper would melt.

Worst Recipe ever, I am surprised that All recipes even published it.  It is like a recipe that Raymond’s mom (Marie) would give to Raymond’s wife (Debra) with a lot of the details missing.

 The main issue is with the directions;
First issue:  Step 1.  Says “Place ingredients in pan of bread machine”.  However, it does not tell you what ingredients to place in the pan of the bread machine.

Second issue:  The Prep time reads 20 Minutes and step 1 says “Select dough cycle, press Start”.  My dough cycle ran for 1 hour and 40 minutes, so how is the Prep time 20 Minutes?

Third issue:  Step 4.  Says to beat ¼ cup of butter, confectioners sugar, vanilla extract and salt.  Well, the ingredients did not list, confectioners’ sugar or vanilla extract and I had already used the salt in the dough.

Marsha Fernandez needs to change her name to Marie Barone if she is going to leave out so many details.

I bake these every chance I get! They are perfect every time. I do pour 1/2 cup of warm heavy cream over them before baking. The rolls soak it up and it keeps the sugar on the bottom nice and gooey. I’d give this 10 stars if I could!

These are fantastic!!! I did not use a bread machine, and as another reviewer suggested, I mixed the butter with the brown sugar/cinnamon before spreading. I’ve made them 3 times in 4 days. My family can’t get enough.

These are amazing!! I've been making them for almost 10 years now!  
I do not make them in a bread machine, I make them from scratch.  I made about 15dz for my daughter's graduation, she requested them.

Pretty standard Cinnabon clone recipe.  Very good result.  Be sure to roll the dough out to a consistent 1/4 to 1/3” (avoid thin spots) and then roll the cinnamon bun tightly.  That’ll make everything look uniform and professional.

I've made this twice.  All the family members that have had it, wanted the recipe.  It is sooooo good.  I doubled the filling and the cream cheese icing,  because I like it rich.  HaHa.

well maybe you could have put which items go into the breadmaker, not everyone is a seasoned baker.  Kind of a waste of product and time when you put the brown sugar in it when it shouldn;t have   with a 2nd try, they were wonderful, i did have to add a couple more tablespoons of water to breadmaker.  they are very easy once you know what acually goes into breadmaker

We loved these cinnamon rolls! I have made them twice in as many weeks. The first time I mixed the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together as one reviewer suggested and this was not nearly easy as sprinkling the brown sugar cinnamon mixture over the butter. I then used the rolling pin to press it down as another reviewer suggested and this was a great idea! The first time I made it they were a bit thicker than the second time and I preferred them rolled a little bit thinner and cut not so thick. Just my personal preference. However because they were thinner they did come out a little dryer so the next time I will not bake them for quite so long. Since this second batch was cut into thinner cinnamon rolls I have a small pan that I am freezing. A reviewer said that this works just fine so I’m anxious to see how that goes. I love the icing given in this recipe but my family prefers just the confectioner sugar icing. I didn’t see the need to turn the pan of rolls over and they weren’t so gooey that they stuck. I highly recommend using parchment paper!!!

Very very good. Made far too large a batch for just two people so ended up throwing out a few as they stale quickly. Flavour was great and fresh from oven made you want more. Next time I will try cutting recipe in half.

These were amazing!  It took about 2 1/2 -3 hours to make from start to finish.  I was a little bummed that it took that long (and I used the "quick" dough course on my bread maker).  It sort of makes it hard to make them for breakfast unless you can do it the evening before and just bake that next morning or if you get up at 4 or 5 am to get started.  I'll have to read some other reviews and see if that is possible.  (Yep, just saw what others do - so I will definitely do these ahead of time so I have something amazing for breakfast next time).  I was impressed with how easy it was to make them in my bread machine (I know many say they always make it by hand, but this was so easy, why do that if you don't have to?).  I followed the recipe exactly - although I did cook it for a few extra minutes because the tops didn't look golden brown yet.  I did not have a big problem with the cinnamon mixture falling out of the buns.  That may be because we left about an inch not buttered along all of the edges before we sprinkled on the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Everyone in my family enjoyed them.  We are looking forward to leftovers tomorrow morning! I do plan on making this again sometime (maybe when our kids have a bunch of friends sleep over)!

I actually used 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup of water instead of the 1 cup of milk.
This is a great recipe! Worked perfectly!

These were fantabulous!  For the filling I followed others suggestions and mixed the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together then spread on dough.  I put half the frosting on right when they came out of the oven then the other half as they were served.

My family loves these cinnamon rolls. I made as posted with the exception of two additions: 1tsp of cinnamon to the flour before adding to my bread machine, and a cap full of vanilla to the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.  We will definitely make these again.

Omg just got done making and eating these and WOW! Never buying store ones again! The only thing I did different was add a smidge of vanilla extract and some pomegranate vanilla vinegar to the dough! That was great! The pop of vanilla and pomegranate was a great note to compliment the cinnamon and sugar! Thank you for the sharing of this recipe!!

Truly awesome just as the recipe is written. The bread is tender and the rolls are filled with gooey cinnamon-ness. The dough was a little difficult to work with, a little dry and not the typical airy, stretchy bread dough I’m used too. Nonetheless, the rolls raised well and they are delicious! I followed another reviewer’s suggestion and spread a little icing on straight out of the oven. Then I finished with the rest after they’d cooked a bit. A real 5 star recipe!

This was my first time and these turned out great. I got a used breadmaker a couple months ago and used it for the first time for this recipe. I did mix the cinnamon and brown sugar with the butter and spread that mixture on the dough. I did not have the leakage that other people talked about. I will be making them again soon.

Delicious, but they ended up very undercooked in the middle. I used 2T. Cinnamon. Next time, I’ll try baking it at a lower oven temperature, and putting them into two pans instead of one to give them some space to bake.

Amazing cinnamon rolls probably better the Cinnabon. They were gone in minutes with the kids fighting over the last one. However had to make it twice the first time they were dark and crispy on top the kids still liked them. The second time I made them I reduced the temperature to 350 degrees for 30 minutes and they cam out perfect.

I wanted more buns, so cut it into 16.  It wasn’t a good choice.   Still delicious, but a little over baked.

This is our family's new favorite!  Dad gets quite agro if it's not made at holiday dinners.
I do add about 1/4 cup sour cream and reduce the milk accordingly.

Great. Freezes well unbaked in small pie dishes to bake up a few fresh whenever you want.  Best to thaw thirst.  Will try to make the dough slightly sweeter with  vanilla

These are as good or better than Cinnabons. We made them for our Sunday church study group and they were gone in a couple of seconds.

I skip the butter in the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture. They always seem to turn out fine!  I do follow the advice of another reviewer and flip the pan upside down after baking; it doesn't make the tops as pretty but it gets all the ooey gooey wonderfulness to disperse through the rolls.

Nothing special about the recipe, but I marked it down because of the way it's organized.  The ingredients need to be separated into: dough, filling, and frosting.  Anyone who is a novice cook would have to read through the entire recipe and figure out what goes where - I'm an experienced baker and I ended up putting the butter (which was listed as margarine) in with the dough mixture!

I have been using this recipe exclusively for years!!!! It is amazing every time i have never changed a thing about it.  It is literally perfect Lol...everyone i have ever made it for begs for these.  Yes they are extremely naughty for you hahaha but sooooo worth the calories.  I just do a huge workout the next day...oh btw they won’t last beyond that because everyone that knows you have made them will inhale them so if you want more than 1 of these you better hide them!! just sayin Lol

Amazing recipe....amazing. I made a few changes based on other reviews. First, we dont have a bread machine. So I just dissolved the yeast in warm milk and then combined with salt, sugar, eggs and butter. Then added to flour. Preheated oven to 200 and then turned it off.  Placed dough in the oven covered with a damp paper towel. For the filling, I combined the ingredients before spreading it on. For baking, I place rolls on parchment paper. No stick, filling didnt leak out. I would suggest doubling the icing recipe. It makes enough but more would would be better.

These are THE best rolls I’ve ever made but change two things. I use a Chinese cinnamon. Makes a difference. Second....on the icing...use a 1:1 ratio of butter and cream cheese. I use 1 8oz cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 1/2 teas lemon juice and 2-2 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Trust me.l..

These were fantastic and easy to make too!  I followed a suggestion in the reviews to refrigerate and bake the next morning in a non-preheated oven at 350 degrees.  I also flipped them out so the melted fillings ran back down into the rolls.  And I spread some icing on the hot rolls, putting more on the cooled rolls.

Absolutely amazing!!! I've made these 3-4 times and they've turned out great each time. People have raved about them every time I've made them. 

They are sweet and would make a great dessert. I did attempt to mix the cinnamon sugar mix with the butter once but had a little trouble spreading it. I'd recommend making it according to the recipe. The amount of frosting was perfect. If you're even thinking about making them, do it! You won't regret it!

I made the dough in my bread machine.  I did have to add 1 tablespoon of water because the dough seemed a little dry.  After kneading and rising it was perfect.  I did cut the cinnamon back to 1 tablespoon and it was perfect.  Never got a chance to make the icing, my husband said they were perfect without it.  I promised my daughter and her girlfriend some cinnamon rolls but I’m going to have to make another batch.  Very simple to make, and I used dental floss to cut the rolls...super simple without squishing the roll.  Awesome recipe....Thank you

made these and my sister would,t believe that  I could make something like that. She thought they were bought from a bakery. Now she is bugging me to make her some. I think I will, but she is going   to help. Fantastic recipe!

I put more cream cheese in the recipe which made the icing less sweet and more creamy. I love these cinnamon rolls and since I only had one left after our party, I think the whole family enjoyed them too!  Definitely will make these again and again.

This recipe is so delicious! I’ve tried many recipes including the ones that come in the bread maker recipe booklet. None can touch this!  It’s that good.

Only changes I made was to the topping: added 1 cup of 10x sugar and 2 Tablespoons of unsweetened coconut milk to the topping.  Gives a smoother consistency and much better “ooey-gooey” presentation.  

Family LOVES this recipe the best.  ??

I have made this recipe dozens of times.  I add raisins and
pecans or walnuts to the mixture and have had rave reviews from normal individuals and professions in the bakery business.
I will continue to make them.  5 star in my opinion.

Made this with AP flour instead since bread flour is so expensive. Also used a cream cheese frosting. And I don’t have a bread machine so made it by hand/kitchenaid. (Other reviews have instructions) Turned out delicious! I gave a family half of a dozen and the mom ate them all! Haha. They are absolutely addicting. I saw a few reviews saying that the filling dropped out with baking and that didn’t happen to me, just make sure you get a nice tight roll. Also, I have tried a bench knife, a serrated knife, and dental floss and the floss worked the best to cut without squishing them. Just make sure it’s not flavored!

Absolutely delicious!! We all love having cinnamon buns on saturdays. Now thanks to these, I no longer will be buying the can!  First time I made these I cut them in the 12 pieces. came out beautiful and fluffy, but were just too big! So made them again and cut them yielding 20- Perfect size! Froze them and divided each bag into having 10. First time eating them from freezing was just as delicious. Took out what I wanted for the next day and let dethaw in the fridge (spray cooking pan before hand). Let them rise in the cold oven while preheating and then baked for 350 for about 25 minutes. Yum yum yum. These are easy, just time consuming, so I love I can make some batches throughout the week and just freeze into ready to go portions. 

I never can seem to roll the dough right on the ends. I get beutiful rolls, except for the first and last, they are very tiny! So I Have been freezing the "tiny" ones for when me and the husband want to snack on cinnamon rolls late at night!

These are the best cinnamon rolls ever. I have made them probably 100 times now, and don't need to look at the recipe. I've been trying to find a perfect recipe for years, and tried so many (even ones from fancy bakeries' cookbooks) and none even come close.

These are delicious! I made the recipe as is without any changes. I did use a KA mixer for the dough and then the frosting. I dissolved the sugar in the bowl before adding the yeast and mixing in all of the required wet ingredients. Used the dough mixing attachment and added 1 cup of flour at a time until it was complete. Once complete I transferred to a lightly oiled bowl and allowed to rise for 1 hour. I mixed all of the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together before spreading on the dough and using a rolling pin to press the mixture into the dough. As another reviewer mentioned, I left some bare spot on the dough so it would be dough to dough when sealing shut. I also wiped a little bit of water on the edge of the dough to ensure it stuck together. Once the rolls were cut, I placed them in a 9x13 glass baking dish with parchment paper on the bottom and allowed them to sit for 20 minutes. Then cooked them for the 15 minutes referenced, in the future I would probably cook them an additional 5 minutes as some of the middle rolls have some gooey spots that seem under cooked. Once they were complete I used half of the frosting immediately to coat all of the rolls and allow it to melt down into them. Then after a few minutes of cooling I drizzled the remaining frosting on all of the rolls.

Blue ribbon cinnamon rolls. The recipe is awesome but the tips in the reviews from others, including previous Cinnabon employees, are pure gold, making it a winner! I’m an experienced baker, but cinnamon rolls are my nemesis. At least until now. This recipe is now safely written down in my winning recipes notebook. My family devoured them and is begging for more, after I made a double batch that barely lasted a day. Wowza!

These are delicious, I can’t keep them around the house! The first time I made it exactly as directions instructed. The second time I changed a few things, when making brown sugar mixture for spread I mixed brown sugar, butter and cinnamon together in bowl, added a teaspoon of vanilla and then spread it on. Much easier! And I sometimes add raisins to the recipe. I also changed the temperature at which you bake them to 350 for approximately 20-25 minutes 400 degrees was drying them out.

This is especially easy if you already make bread and are familiar with a bread machine.  I've never had a Cinnabon so can't compare the two but friends who tried this roll who have tried Cinnabons said these are even better!

I make it by hand and use 8 oz cream cheese in the frosting. otherwise I do it as is. Fantastic. Use it every Christmas and Easter. Make sure to use bread flour. AP does not yield the same texture

I would cut the roll filling down to 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. I have the biggest sweet tooth I know of, and these were too sweet for me. I love cinnamon as well but 2 1/2 tablespoons was too much. 

If you don’t have cream cheese, any basic icing recipe with some vanilla, butter and confectioners sugar will do just fine. 

I do not own a bread machine. Instead I used a stand mixer and let it proof an hour before rolling it out and they came out very large and fluffy!

Honestly, after much search for a decent cinnamon bun, these did not reach my high set expectations at all. The Doug was very easy to work with though ( which is rare to find). With great reviews in the 'Clone of a Cinnabon' I thought these would be delicious, but the filling just didnt do it for me, and the dough was salty and dry. The cream cheese icing was VERY good though. I used convection bake (which I think cooked them a bit too fast), and let the dough rest in the fridge overnight. The only good thing this recipe coukd be used for would be the frosting. Sorry for such a bad review. I had high expectations...

Great cinnamon roll recipe, even when halfed! Definitely read what other reviewers said below: flip as soon as you take it out of the oven, leave a 1/4 of an inch border when spreading the cinnamon/sugar goodness, and definitely doable without a bread machine. Even though I made 1/2 the recipe since we’re a small family, I used the full icing recipe and spread half on when they were hot and half when it had cooled a little. Also, we ate some the next day and just warmed them in the microwave for 20 seconds.

OH MY GOD!!! These were incredible!  I wanted to test out my new bread machine with various recipes so I picked this one. I can't wait to bring these to a family gathering. They are amazing. So soft and sweet. I will definitely make this again...and again...and again. My only adjustment was neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese.

I follow the suggestion for not using a bread machine. I've been making this recipe for 4 or 5 years now, and I always get rave reviews.  I'm baffled at some of the comments indicating the rolls had no flavor or came out like bricks. My rolls come out perfect every time.  It does take longer to rise than the recipe indicates unless I use the bread proof setting on my oven (really a factor of the temp in my home).  I use that setting if I'm in a hurry. Be sure to follow the directions on the temp of the milk. Too warm and you'll kill your yeast which would cause the rolls not to rise.  Too cool and you'll have trouble getting the yeast to dissolve. I always test my temp before adding the yeast. Delicious cinnamon rolls!

Have made several times. I do flip upside down for a few minutes after removing removing from oven. Very sweet and delicious. This is my go to recipe.

These were so absolutely decadent, moist, and the perfect sweetness.  I used all purpose flour and they turned out great.  Definitely going in the recipe book.  I always make double frosting though.

This has become my go-to recipe for cinnamon rolls.   I take them to community functions and have been told repeatedly "Those are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever tasted!"  

I cut into 18 rolls and it fills a jelly roll size pan.

This is the best cinnamon roll recipe. Delicious every time. I even forgot to knead for 15 mins, and forgot 1/2 TB cinnamon, and these STILL turned out delicious. Obviously kneading the dough makes it 10x tastier, but...it’ll turn out if you forget. I don’t use a bread machine btw, so you’re good on making these the old fashioned way.

Tried them this morning.  I usually am my worst critic but these turned out great.  Our visitors raved over them too.
Five stars, thank you. Made without bread machine.

I have made this recipe many times using my breadmaker to mix the dough and then shaping and baking manually. The recipe is perfect and I will continue to use is for these delicious cinnamon buns.

Definitely need to let it rise well, before baking. I also give it another 5 minutes in the oven to make sure it is completely baked through. Best recipe I've found for the BREAD MACHINE!

I made this just as written, but I baked them on a half sheet pan, and they raised up big and soft.  Tasted just like Cinnabon.  Can't wait to make these again.

Excellent,  spread the rolls out on a baking sheet, cover to proof for an hr and they will get nice and big, double the icing recipe.  Amazing as is though.

It was great but the 1 cup brown sugar was way too sugary sweet. Next time, I will just put 1/4 or 1/3 at the most.

These were delicious. I used butter instead of margarine and still tastes really good. They expanded a lot and I spaced them apart a little more and they are really lovely looking round buns..

Great taste. Almost sickeningly sweet but that's the point right? After rolling/cutting the rolls I covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight. In the morning i let sit on counter for 30 min and then baked according to directions.

I have made this recipe several times now, and it has turned out perfect!  No need for a bread machine.  The last time I made them, I added a few teaspoons of lemon juice to the icing and did not add the salt.  So far, no complaints!   Thanks for the great recipe.

These were excellent! My husband said they were the best thing he has ever put in his mouth. I added extra butter, cinnamon and sugar filling and extra cream cheese to the icing (didn't want to waste it). I must of cut them small because I got more then twelve, but they were still a really good size. I did not  use a bread machine. I will be making these again!

This is a great recipe! Do not  change a thing. You can always adjust it to your liking later. Be sure to watch the video since the ingredients are not separated in the written version. This is my new Go-To recipe for Cinnamon Rolls though I will soon try the Cinnamon Rolls III recipe.
PS. I baked these in my 14" Lodge Camp Dutch Oven.

This is my first  time making these awesome cinnamon rolls. My first time using the Cuisinart bread machine that I'd purchased back in December 2016.  My family is very finicky but they all love these! I am making 2nd batch now to save it in the freezer.  I used coconut oil instead of butter and you can't taste it after it is baked.  I have read most of the reviews and I agreed that bread flour is a must instead of AP flour, because the texture is chewy yet light, like the original Cinnabon.

I found this recipe in March and have already made it a half dozen times. My daughter asks for it every weekend and so does my mom! I don't use a bread maker and followed instructions found in other reviewers that make by hand. I have made them the night before and get up early to let rise and bake.

I made no changes to the ingredients, but I mixed the dough last night in my breadmaker, then put it in a greased bowl, covered it with plastic wrap, and refrigerated the dough until morning. It did rise in the fridge overnight , but stayed within the bowl. In the morning, I let it warm up on the counter for about 10 minutes or so before proceeding with the rest of the instructions of rolling out the dough... making them into cinnamon rolls. They turned out beautifully, and they were DELICIOUS! Because I was able to use my breadmaker and have the dough ready for the morning, it took no time at all to make these for breakfast.  Definitely a keeper!!

It is very good but the  frosting turned out runny.  So I added more sugar probably about one more cup, and used electric mixer to make fluffy creamy looking frosting.  Then it looked just like a real Cinnabon.

Made this recipe years ago and forgot to save it.  I made a bunch of these for a family reunion and froze the buns after assembling the dough and cinnamon mixture and cutting them.  I then thawed them overnight in the fridge and baked fresh in the morning.   They were a HUGE hit and also were literally huge in size.  The cinnamon filling has so much more flavor than store bought cinnamon buns.  It's honestly a lot of work but for a special occasion they are so worth it.

These were pretty good, but they were missing something and that something is more salt. I made them again after adding another teaspoon of salt and they turned out great. They texture and softness of the rolls are perfect!

This recipe is not only spot on for a Cinnabon clone, it is even better. I have made them three times in less than a week.  I make them as minis instead of full size.  Divide the brown sugar and cinnamon in half, cut the dough in half and roll out to a 21 x 8 rectangle. Spread half of the butter/margarine over the dough. Spread half of the brown sugar and cinnamon. Complete as indicated by the recipe and repeat with the other half of dough. They will bake the same as the full size ones but are great for a party or just for less calories! I did increase the frosting recipe by 1 1/2 times so I guess I didn't really cut the calories! The dough bakes up nice and chewy because of the bread flour, which is what I have been looking for for years! Thank you, Marsha. Great, great recipe.

I have been making these rolls for years. such a great recipe! the trick to melt in your mouth, light, airy rolls is to use as little flour as possible. the dough will seem too sticky at first but just go with it.

Delicious!  I use a different frosting that's just 2 cups of powdered sugar and 3 tablespoons of milk (or half n half) plus a dash of vanilla.  Much easier to spread, easier to make and tastier.

I have made this LOTS. I use a hole stick of butter at each time. Also I turn them upside down to cool. I would make these all the time if my waistline would let me.

9.9/10! Delicous. The dough is just like Cinnabon, but I have been using a different icing. For bakers wondering about freezing and putting it in the fridge, I have done many things with the dough and always turns out great! I have left the unbaked rolls in the fridge overnight so that we can have fresh in the morning, I have frozen the unbaked rolls and let thaw too.

These are really good but MUST be cooked longer! I made 2 batches, the first one so doughy in the center we couldn't eat them. The second batch was much better but the center ones still needed to cook longer. What we could eat was delicious. Next time I'll cook at 350 for 25-30 minutes like I do my sticky buns.

OMG, soooo good. Used my bread maker. Only change I made was that I added 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice to icing, as per other recommendations. This recipie is dangerous!

This turned out great and was incredibly sweet.  The entire family loved it.  However, it does make quite a bit extra of the cinnamon sugar, so you can cut down the filling by 1/4 and be fine.

Thanks to AndyTami I made these today w/o a breadmaker. I used buttermilk because it was what I had on hand, also used real butter.  This is not a quick recipe but it was very easy, it has two separate rise times some people might have overlooked. 

I warmed my buttermilk to 120° and let it sit with the yeast for 10 minutes then I mixed it with the other ingredients before adding the flour. I hand kneaded my dough then let it rest in a oiled bowl for an hour. After that, rolled it out and cut them then let them rise for ANOTHER 30 minutes. I had to bake mines for 21 minutes, since they were still kinda soft and white after 15 minutes. 

They came out really big and soft even after cooling, tasty but not quite cinnabon tasty. This was my first time making cinnamon buns, thanks for and easy first tasty time.

These genuinely taste like a Cinnabon! Don't make them in cupcake liners/individually they won't come out as soft and squishy.

Made two batches... when it said to add all ingredients to he bread maker, I did, literally. This was a mistake. I had never made cinnamon rolls before, and the recipe was not divided to show which ingredients were for the roll batter, the filling and the Frosting. Because of this, I added more than I should have before catching myself. I cooked it anyway in muffin cups   The kids liked it, but it really was terrible. I made the second dough in my bread maker immediately following the first, but because I only had one egg, I halved the recipe (for the most part). I kept the filling and frosting at full volume (so doubled if I had made it as stated in the recipe). THEY TURNED OUT AMAZING!!!! If I could make them daily I would. Definitely worth the time. Oh, I didn't warm any of my ingredients because my bread maker does it for me.i also baked it at 359 for 20 min as others recommended and they were baked in a round cake pan.

Was very good. Can't say it's exactly like a Cinnabon; they've mastered the job. I added crushed pecans with the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture. A nice addition.

Turned out amazing! I was intimidated to make it, but you really do not need any culinary experience. You also don't need a bread machine. There is a comment below that explains what to do. Let your yeast activate in the warm milk and then after you see bubbles/foam, add the other ingredients in to start forming your dough. NEVER use HOT MILK to active your yeast. Scalding milk (or any liquid for that matter) will kill your yeast. When you are finished making the dough and want to let it rise, I like to microwave water until it boils and quickly remove it and shut the door to trap the moisture in. Then I place the covered bowl with my dough inside the microwave. Again do this quickly because the whole purpose is to keep warmth and moisture in the microwave.

Made  almost as written, but did not use bread machine, mixed by hand, as I find that gives me better control of the dough and how much flour needs to be added.  Had to change the frosting for my lactose intolerant kiddos.  Used Toffutti Cream Cheese instead.  Delicious, light and fluffly.  I made the night before, after first rising and rolling into rolls.  Covered with suran wrap and then placed in warming oven.  They rose perfectly.

I made these for Christmas Eve breakfast, and I was a little nervous because I had never made cinnamon rolls before. These were so easy. I don't have a bread machine so I just dissolved 2 1/4 tsp yeast in the warm milk in my mixer until foamy, and added everything else to mix, then  allowed to rise as a ball once, punched down, formed into rolls in a baking pan and placed in the fridge until the next morning when I took them out while the oven was preheating and baked as directed. Very delicious! Next time I would divide into two batches and freeze one for another time. I got about 14 rolls out of one batch.

This recipe is perfect as is. I made no changes and it was amazing and amazingly easy! I actually had a bit of cinnamon/sugar leftover, and a bit of icing leftover. I can't imagine how some people said they doubled the icing.

These were delicious and with some slight tweaks they will be perfect. I made this according to the recipe. The only change I made was mixing the butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon to spread on the dough. That was not a good idea. I ended up with a crumbled filling instead of gooey goodness. I love cinnamon but this was too much even for me. Next time I will add pecans and raisins. I also decreased the powdered sugar by 1/4 cup and increased cream cheese by an ounce. It was a good choice since I think it would have been too sweet otherwise.

I loved these Cinnamon rolls! I have never been to Cinnabon so I can't tell you how this recipe compares to them but I can tell that they are good. I took off a star because the recipe isn't written very well. I don't have a bread machine so I was completely confused as to what was supposed to be for the dough, filling, and icing. It would have been better if each section was labeled so it easier to follow at a glance.

Fantastic recipe... I actually rolled my dough out a little too thin in some areas, but it turned out very well actually. I read some reviews that they wanted that extra goo type thing, and before I baked mine, I made a little "goo" for the top. I used 1/4 cup butter, some brown sugar and a little cinnamon just so it stays moist. I will definitely be making these again, but next time leave more room in between my cinnarolls :)

Great recipe, followed every step and easy to make even without bread maker.  My mum loooves Cinnabon and she said it was just as good as the real thing, if not better!  Will definitely make again

I make these all the time for Christmas morning and as a gift.  I use my bread machine to make the dough. Freeze the before the last raise.  Take them out of the freezer let them rise in a closed oven and bake. Perfect every time .

Better than Cinnabon, if you ask anyone in my family! You can use regular yeast and they turn out just as good. For a richer flavors, use butter instead of margarine!

Holy smokes! These are amazing! I didn't have eggs so I used yogurt + baking soda. I followed another's advice to tuck after every full roll and had no issues with filling oozing out.  These are gooey and delicious! I will definitely be making these again!

Yummy! Quite time consuming for 12 rolls, but so tasty! It would have been great if the ingredients list was divided up into: dough recipe and icing recipe. It took me a bit to figure out which ingredient was for what. Anyway, it satisfied my craving for cinnamon rolls!

I followed the recipe to a T and got a very nice rise out of the brai I follow the recipe to a T and  got a nice rise out of the dough and a rise out of the shaped  Cinnabon before putting it in the oven. The taste is fantastic but the bread is not as soft as I hoped to be. It was not tender.

Sorry, my other review messed up...  I followed the recipe with the exception of two things.  1.  I used instant yeast as that is what I had.  According to the Internet, I decreased the amount called for by 25% because I used the bread maker.  2.  I followed other reviewer suggestions and cooked it at 350 for 25min.  They tasted heavenly!

I made the buns without a bread machine like user ANDYTAMI said by first mixing the yeast with warm milk but it didn't rise as much as it was supposed to. I was really nervous they wouldn't come out well, but they were pretty good!

I  have made these twice in the last two months and both times they turned out great. The kids loved them. I could only eat one at a time they gobbled down at least two. But we had plenty of leftovers for breakfast for at least the next two days. These reheat wonderfully in the microwave.

This recipe is amazing! The cinnamon rolls tasted delicious. You do have to be careful to make the  entire thing as  rectangular as possible, so you don't end up with two "horns"  when you cut it. Thank you for this recipe!

This is such an amazing recipe! Sometimes I read through and make adjustments, but otherwise I just make it the way they say. I do double the frosting (that's part of our favorite) I've been making this for 4 years now and everyone always loves them. Pregnant with number 3 currently and it satisfies every craving haha although I'm going to have to pace myself!

First time baking a cinnamon roll and this thing came out flawless. You really don't need to buy Cinabon anymore if you have this recipe. Let me also state this is my favorite sweet on planet earth so I was actually surprised at how good it was

I pretty much only used the brown sugar and cinnamon amounts from this recipe, then did everything else differently.

I used frozen dinner rolls.
1. Put them in a greased (canola oil) muffin pan and let them rise in the oven for 1hr.

2. Mixed the cinnamon and brown sugar, flattened the roll and added a scoop of the sugar mix to the center and closed the dough and putting it back in the muffin pan.

3. Spray the top of the dought with nonstick spray and sprinkle the leftover sugar mix on top.

4. Put back in the oven rise for 15-30min.

5. Bake for 15min and serve!

The best cinnamon rolls I've ever made :) I didn't even use a bread machine, and baked them in a glass pan with aluminum foil on top.

This tasted exactly like a cinnamon. This is my recipe from here on out for cinnamon buns! Yummy! I made the dough the night before, let it rise overnight in the fridge and made them the next morning. Turned out wonderfully.

I love these I made them as written except for the margarine. I didnt have any margarine so I used butter and vegetable oil as the replacement. 
Also for the frosting I didnt use any milk and the  frosting was perfect.

I have made these several times and they have become my mom's very favorite thing.  Just made them again for Mother's Day and I'm sure she will love them.  

My mom really loves cinnamon, so I have doubled the amount that is called for.

I've been making these for  years, but just getting around to reviewing them.  I follow everything exactly except for the bread machine - since I don't have a bread machine Andytami's review was awesome.  Once done cooking, I also followed another reviewer's tips to flip the pan upside down so that any filling that may have escaped has recoated the rolls.  These are a huge hit every time I make them and everyone thinks I buy them.

Using my bread machine, I followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of raisins . Not a Cinnabon but close. Everyone loved them.

This has been my go-to recipe for cinnamon rolls for a few years now and everyone who has tried them raves about how good they are! The only change I make is that I don't use a bread machine - I follow ANDYTAMI's instructions for the very beginning of the recipe. They still come out perfect.

INSANELY GOOD. Like, dangerously good. I made them without a bread machine. The icing was a tad too thick so I had to add a little bit of milk, but other than that, the recipe was perfect and my family loved them. I think these are better than the mall Cinnabons. I will definitely make them again!

Oh...my.....stars!!! This is incredible!!! I've made them 5 times in a week and a half haha. My family and neighbors love them! It is so easy. I'll never buy a cinnamon roll again, no joke. 
I used siagon cinnamon for the for the first time, and I'll never go back to "regular" cinnamon at least when it comes to baking. It elevated the quality and flavor a lot then when I've used cassia or ceylon cinnamon. Please make these! You won't be disappointed, unless you seriously messed it up. ;)  I can't wait for the next family gathering for an excuse to make them again. The frosting is delicious. I've wanted a good cream cheese frosting for other items and I will take their recipe and apply it to other recipes. The texture was perfect and the flavor was spot-on. I would even use a little bit less frosting on the cinnamon rolls next time.

I did not use a bread machine and these turned out beautifully!  I followed another reviewer's advice and went over the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture a few times with a rolling pin before rolling them up and there was no leaking of the filling.  I did lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees in my convection oven and baked them about 22 minutes.  The dough was very easy to work with.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Delicious. I didn't use a bread maker... 1 put 7g yeast with warm milk in my mixing bowl, whisked and let sit for 10 min till frothy. Added sugar,  egg, salt, butter. Whisked together. Attached my dough hook. Slowly add flour and kneeded on low for several minutes till fully encorporated. Dough was elastic and lightly sticky, but not like glue. Turned out dough into a bowl coated with cooking spray. Added a bit of spray to the top of the dough. Covered the bowl with plastic wrap covered in cooking spray.  Put dough in bowl in the oven for 1 hour to rise. Oven was off. I used my trick of boiling water ahead of time in a pot, and putting the pot in the over with my dough. The steam helps to rise. After an hour, turned dough out onto lightly floured surface. Rolled with pin into rectangle.  Brushed softened but not melted butter to dough surface. Sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon. Brush evenly. Added chopped pecans and raisins to dough surface. Rolled. Cut into pieces.  Put pieces into glass pan covered in cooking spray. Cover pan with plastic wrap with cooking spray. Put back into oven with boiled water pot. Let rise another 30 min. Take out of oven. Preheat 350. Pop in oven for 20-25 min. Top with frosting. Yummy

AMAZING! I've just made it twice...first time I put them in the fridge after rolling the dough and baked it in the morning, by turning on the oven and placing them in to warm up as the oven warmed (as per a reviewers suggestion)..the middle ones did not bake...def need more of a warm up time or double the bake time.
Second time I baked them right away, all 12, for 20 mins, could've used an extra 5mins.
I also used cold out of the fridge eggs,  all purpose flour measured as recipe called for, and milk heated for half a minute. The first time i used shortening and second time i used butter....both ways tasted amazing! Also I flipped them right away on to parchment paper, and then put them back in the baking pan to let the goo ooze in..yum! icing is amazingly delicious.
These were delicious! and I will try to master the over night fridge technique. AMAZING recipe! thank you!!!
How many times have i said amazing and delicious?! haha Because they are!

These were very good.  I sprinkled some chopped walnuts  on the filling before rolling up the dough.  I don't have a bread machine so I followed ANDYTAMI's advice on making them without one.  Also, I cut the recipe in 1/2 since it was just for me and my husband.  Next time I make them I will only make 1/4 of the glaze recipe; I ended up scraping a lot of it off as it was too much for my taste.

These are amazing! I used all purpose flour since it's what I had and it worked fine. I'm curious now to see if they are better with bread flour. I also doubled the icing because my husband and I LOVE to pile on the icing on cinnamon  rolls. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I made these exactly as written, except after putting them in the pan, I covered with plastic wrap and left them in the fridge overnight. Baked them in the morning and they were sooo good. The cream cheese icing was Spot on. These aren't as gooey as Cinnabon but they are just as delicious.

Really close to real cinnabon`s. Make sure you don't use regular cinnamon I recommend Korintje it has great flavor and close to  what is used in actual cinnabons.

Really easy to make. Moist and fluffy. Next time i'll do this again. I would lessen the sugar and add parchment paper in the baking pan for easier transfer.

Usually the bread maker directions tell you to put wet ingredients in first, then all dry except yeast, then make a well or hole in the middle of the dry just big enough to put yeast in. I always use fast rising yeast. FYI one of the yeast packets equal 2.5 tsp. Dividing the recipe is confusing. I figured out that the 1/3 cup butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar were the filling and then the rest are cream cheese frosting. Good outcome though. We love the rolls and I love how easy it is to walk away and let my bread machine do the work. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipeturnedout very good. The dough looked way to heavy initially. Resist the urge to add water. It will be fine. I cooked mine about20 min. They could have gone 10. More. Very nice recipe next time I will follow my instincts and cook a bit longer .

Marsha, you have nailed it!  We followed a reviewer's suggestion on how to make with no bread machine and we followed your recipe exactly.  I think one of the secrets here is no lemon and I insisted on tons of walnuts.  Good job girl!

I have made this several times now. I start out thinking "why am I going to this effort instead of buying them?" But the result is fantastic. Not as much work as I think it will be and the flavor is superb. And the cost is pennies on the dollar vs. Cinnabon.

I recently got a bread maker and have been enjoying seeing what it can do. Especially since making dough is much less daunting now that I can just push a button! This recipe was easy for a beginner like me, and made soft, gooey, cinnamon-y deliciousness. My husband is always in pursuit of cinnamon rolls, and he absolutely loved them! Great recipe!

These were incredible.  Nothing more to say...Well, there is one thing.  I wanted to make them the night before so I didn't have to prep in the morning.  So instead of letting them rise once sliced and in the baking dish, I covered them and refridgerated them overnight.  Took them out to take off the chill a bit as the oven warmed up the next day.  Came out BEAUTIFULLY.

This recipe is really amazing.  The salt ratio is wrong as it is written.  Essentially I doubled the salt content as written and that came out perfect.  Also - use a thermometer to watch the temp and pull them out at 180 degrees.  They'll hit 190-195 sitting in the pan. That way, the muffins are nice and soft - just barely cooked.

amazing! I did as another said .."Someone wanted to know how to make this without a bread machine, here is how. Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl. Mix in the sugar, margarine, salt, and eggs. Add flour and mix well. Knead the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with flour. Put in a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Then pick up with rolling out the dough." Also let sit in fridge over night and baked at 350 for 20-25 mins the next morning. (for dough to rise: Warm oven-preheated to 200, then turned oven off and let dough rise.)

Also, I mixed the butter with cinnamon sugar before spreading on dough.

Well, lucky for me, I"ve never had a Cinnabon so I guess I don't know what I'm missing!  Plus, I love to save money so this is as close to the real deal as I'm going to get to eat.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE these cinnamon rolls!   I usually make them with my own family & some extended family.  I took them to a church brunch a few days ago & I got so many compliments on how delicious they were.  I am definitely taking them to my in-law family brunch tomorrow - they have never had them & I'm sure the rolls will be a big hit!!!

I took these to an office food day 5 years ago, and every food day they're now demanded.

My change for them is to cut the rolled out dough in half, and make 24 smaller rolls instead of a dozen large ones.

These never come out as fluffy as I'd like them to be. always too dense. I added a 1/2tsp of both baking soda and powder which improved the texture but then made it a bit more "cake like" than I wanted.

Very good and easy recipe - didn't change a thing except reduced the amount of cinnamon to about half the amount as someone else suggested.     Definitely flip them upside down  before icing !

I've made these twice now and what I've found was to change it to 8 servings instead of 12 still using just 1 large egg and let it rise 3 times in total.  When I don't have any cream cheese I use maple syrup instead for the glaze. I don't have a bread maker so I just add all the first ingredients and add the yeast last letting it sit for a minute before mixing it with a mixer for about 4 minutes. This is a great recipe as is but I like to tweak things to put a personal touch

This has become THE recipe I use for cinnamon rolls now.  I have tweaked it over the years and got it perfect, tot he point that I can get the same results every time.  The rolls I make using this recipe have become the highlight of our families' holidays.

Excellent recipe. I make mine a day ahead and parbake for 10 mins at 325. Then cool and wrap to the fridge overnight or double wrap and freeze for up to 4 weeks. When ready to bake I let come to room temp and the bake for 10-15 mins at 350 I till brown.

It came out a little dry, so I added a few tablespoons of milk and then it was great. I also baked them on sheets of wax paper which prevented the bottom from burning and the filling from leaking.

I made these tonight, and they were fabulous!!! Will definitely make again. My family loved them! The only thing I did different was I pressed the sugar/cinnamon mixture into the butter as advised in a review.

I used stand mixer instead of bread machine; softened butter instead of melted margarine; instant yeast instead of active yeast; room temperature milk instead of warm milk. I had long rise time. My first rise is at least 1.5 hour longer. I also only used half of the brown sugar in filling which already gave me enough sweet. As suggested by some reviewers, be remembered to leave 1/4" margin at the far side in spreading for better dough-dough sealing; roll it from the long side and from middle to edge; cut using dental floss and cool upside down for the drippings to coat back the rolls. Next time I shall try 4 tsp instant yeast and 1 Tsp cinnamon.

I made these rolls and the rolls seemed tough. After reading others reviews I made the dough in my bread machine. I did as one reviewer suggested, I mixed the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter together first before spreading it onto the dough. I put my rolls on parchment so if the sugar mixture leaked out I could turn the rolls upside down. Maybe I went wrong by following s reviewer that rolled and cut my rolls then placing them in the fridge overnight. I placed them in a cold oven and let them bake 20 min. They rose just fine and looked great. As another reviewer said to put some icing on them while warm to keep them moist and then icing them with the remainder of the icing later. The dough just seemed tough. I told my husband, make sure you nuke them before you eat them so they will be soft.  Could it be how they are kneaded in the bread machine? Overnighting the rolls in the fridge? Or just the dough recipe? The rolls still tasted good, but truly I was disappointed.  Maybe it's just me, the baker? Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Great recipe; however,  400° is too high. I suppose I should have read previous reviews. So, the next time I will have to bake at 350° for at least 20 minutes. Had the recipe already called to bake that way, I would have given 5 stars.

The rolls were really good but for some reason they didn't rise almost at all. I added the correct amount of yeast and everything but they didn't rise or expand much. They still tasted pretty good though.

The frosting wasn't my favorite. I added more powdered sugar and it tasted better after that.

This was an okay recipe. It was not detailed enough for beginners.  I baked at 375, instead of 400 and I used a different frosting recipe.  Nothing spectacular.

Fantastic! My family and I devoured them. Then I realized I forgot to put the icing on! Never in my life did I think I could make cinnamon rolls this good. I didn't even need a bread machine. I dissolved the yeast and sugar in the warm milk. I incorporated the other ingredients, kneaded it, then let it proof until double in size. Then I picked up at the rolling out step. Once I had them all together, I put them in the fridge overnight. The next morning, I placed them in a cold oven with a shallow pan of boiling water underneath for about 20 min for the second rise. Then, I took everything out and preheated the oven. I baked at 400 for 20 min.

Excellent recipe! I veganized it by subbing with: almond milk; Earth Balance spread (the soy free one); flax "egg" (1 Tb ground flax + 2 1/2 Tb water = 1 "egg").
I also kneaded the dough for a total of 15 minutes (I took breaks, haha), since I don't own a bread machine. Yummy, gooey, perfect. I might add more cinnamon next time, though. For the frosting I just used Tofutti "cream cheese" (the one with hydrogenated oils, since I read it tastes better and is thicker than the one made without hydrogenated oils: I know, I know, its unhealthy) with some powdered sugar. Yummy, as well.
These cinnamon rolls freeze well (the dough), and so does the frosting (as another reviewer mentioned). Excellent for popping into the toaster oven (set on warm to let them rise). 
Keeper recipe. You'll be pleased with the results. :)

This review is a 5 star when making a few minor adjustments . I made it about 15 times and around the 5th time of making them i decided to bake them at 350 for 25 min. This is the best!!!  They are more fluffy and soft, and not as over baked. Also for even more tender cinnamon rolls allow the rolls to bake for 10 min, take them out and pour about a tablespoon of heavy whipping cream on each cinnamon roll and put it back in the oven for the last 15 min of baking. This will definitely turn your cinnamon roll into a Cinnabon roll. No regrets I only make it this way from now on. Mmmmm I have some in my fridge waiting for me :)

I would give 5 stars for what I actually made, which was not this recipe exactly, but it was my starting point. So I will give it 4 stars for the reviews pointing me in the right direction to make awesome cinnamon rolls. I basically followed the instructions by YLA since I don't have a bread machine. These turned out fantastic. Next time I will probably use a little less cinnamon.  I cooked them in an over-sized glass casserole pan. It's larger than 9x13,  11xsomething. I'm not sure of the exact measurements.  This worked great and allowed them to really puff up. I used The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing recipe on this site for the icing.

Fantastic recipe. Also makes great dinner rolls. I didn't have bread flour so o had to add 2.5 tablespoons of vital wheat gluten and a shot glass of water. Dough came out great.

I have made this recipe so many times that it's become a favorite among my friends and I get frequent requests! However I always mix the ingredients by hand and never use a bread maker, this way I can control the knead and rise to my satisfaction. Otherwise it's a great recipe and I'll continue to supply my friends who request it!

Made the dough by hand using ANDYTAMI's directions (thank you!). 
It turned out perfect and oh sooo delicious.  So much better than the actual Cinnabon (which I don't like because I think their filling is really viscous and corn-syrupy). All in all the best cinnamon roll I ever made!

Decided to try this out, and switch it up from my normal recipe. This was overall tasty. I made my dough in a stand up mixer with dough hook attachment..and then kneaded it by hand for about 8 minutes. I used a quick rise yeast so i just set it aside for 10 minutes while i got the filling ready. Rolled it, filled it, and shaped the dough in a greased dish. Covered it really tightly and put in the fridge overnight.(i wanted fresh buns for breakfast) I pulled the buns out about an hour before baking..then put them in a cold oven and baked away. These were good, not great..the dough is missing something for me.. (maybe vanilla )We don't have Cinnabon here in Canada so i wasnt sure what to compare to, other that the regular recipe i use. I am happy i finally tried this...and so glad that these can be made night before with positive results.

Hard, thick, sticky dough, like cookie dough. They never rose. I did not even make the frosting.
2nd try 3 years later: still firm dough, but I used all purpose + gluten flour in the ratios I needed to make a double batch, hoping they come out well b/c they are for my kids' teachers at school. The initial and 2nd rising went well. I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes.

I had to make a few alterations because this recipe was a last minute thing. I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and instant yeast instead of the bread yeast. I just kneaded it by hand and put it in a greased bowl to rise. After that I just rolled it out and added the butter/sugar/cinnamon as per the recipe. After that I put it in a pan put it (covered) in the fridge until time to bake (I was making them as a dessert and I still had a few hours before I needed them). When time to bake rolled around, I uncovered them and followed baking directions. Perfectly risen and golden

Had been trying recipe after recipe to recreate a cinnamon roll from a place called TJ Cinnamon's, this one hit the nail on the head! I made no changes and love the fact that I found one that used my bread machine. I have made several batches of these as my family and friends love them!

Truly amazing recipe!! I made to exact specifications and I don't think they could of turned out better!! I did not use a bread machine though. Followed ANDYTAMI's review for brief no bread machine instructions. I did however make double the amount of frosting and end up using about 2/3 of it. Will make these again and again. These should be called Better than Cinnabon rolls.~

I really wanted these to come out but had a problem getting the dough to rise.  Tried it with brand new jar of active yeast.  I live in south Florida so it's not an altitude thing, either.

These cinnamon rolls are delicious. I didn't give this recipe 5 stars because I do think it was necessary to change a few things from the original recipe. I didn't think it was very much like a cinnabon but they are still good. 
I like my filling plentiful. In order to achieve that I used more butter, cinnamon, and sugar. I doubled the amount called for in the recipe. I suggest rolling the dough pretty thin. (I found that the Cinnabon rolls have a thinner dough that is rolled up more) The baking time is pretty accurate but always double check rolls. (never open the oven unless they are done or you will lose the necessary heat) 
I have made these cinnamon rolls numerous times and always change it up by adding something else. Try pecans next time around.

Sadly for me, I was not impressed.  The icing had more of a butter taste than a cream cheese taste and the buns themselves were just so so.  Really disappointing after the amount of work that went into them.

Great easy recipe.  I let mine rise in a warm spot. I placed in the refrigerator over night & cooked the next morning. I used very little cream cheese for the icing & added orange juice to the frosting & they tasted great. I froze a few of the cooked & frosted rolls & then defrosted them & heated in the microwave. They tasted awesome!

This recipe was really easy and I think they turned out the way they were supposed to, but a "clone of Cinnabon" they were not.  I completely covered them with a thick layer of frosting and still had leftover.

Tasted just like a cinnabon.  They turned out very good even after I mistakenly left them in my bread baker and extra hour and 15 minutes after the cycle ended. I halved the recipe and still got 14 rolls.  They just weren't as huge as the ones you get from Cinnabon.  I will definitely make them again.

The best cinnamon bun recipe EVER!!! I followed ANDYTAMI's directions for non- bread machine. I found that I needed to lower final cook time and temp to 375 for 12 minutes. Remove IMMEDIATELY from pan otherwise they stick - thanks for great recipe! I'm making them every week now; kids devour them:)

As is this recipe is a solid 3, but the bones of the recipe are good. With a few changes it's easily a 5, hence my 4 star review.

I make the dough portion of the recipe exactly as is except I substitute butter for the margarine.. We don't use margarine in our house and I find it really odd when a recipe calls for both butter and margarine considering most households choose one or the other and rarely use both. 

The filling is good but doesn't make near enough so I double it. These are cinnamon rolls, not health food. If they're going to be bad for you don't skimp on the good part. Now where I majorly differ from the recipe is I don't spread the butter and then sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar. Instead I combine them together then kind of massage the entire mixture onto the rolled dough. I find this keeps the filling from leaking out of the rolls better. It also more evenly distributes the flavor. 

Per the suggestion of other reviewers I bake the rolls for 20 minutes at 350 so they don't over brown. 

Finally, the icing... I accidentally misread the recipe the first time around and used a full 8oz package of cream cheese. I've never even seen 3oz packages at my grocery store. I do everything else as written then throw it all in the microwave for about 30 seconds to make it more liquidy. This makes more of a cinnabon textured paste/icing rather than the drizzly stuff pictured. Cinnabon glops their icing on, so I will continue to use a full 8oz package of cream cheese.

Pretty good recipe. I did find the bake time to be too much. The bottoms were a little too crispy. Also you must use parchment paper to line the pan for easier clean up.

Tried freezing, but they were too dense for my liking. When eaten fresh they are delicious. Next time, try to double the amount of butter and brown sugar. Would not double the cinnamon.

Some of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made!!!! Followed the recipe and followed a few of other readers tips...soo glad I did!!!  Turning the rolls upside down was an awesome tip and none of the filling was wasted.
Very easy to follow.

This was soooooo much work and the end result was too dry and had the faint unpleasant taste of yeast. They did look beautiful and I didn't have the problem of leaking filling even though I never turned the pan upside down like people recommended. But the best part of the Cinnabon is the soft moist gooey innards and this did not have that at all. Just dry cinnamon-sugary bread. And I didn't skimp on the butter!

I made this recipe for my family over the weekend, and it was a big hit !! so some changes i made to the recipe: I wanted to keep it dairy free so i changed the milk to soy milk, and butter to margarine. I didnt have bread flour, so I just used regular all purpose, and it came out perfectly fine. I also didnt use a bread machine, followed the instructions from one of the comments. For the butter to spread on the dough once rolled, 1/3 cup in my opinion was wayyyy too much, so I just used however much I needed to lightly spread on. As for the cinnamon filling, it made just enough to cover the dough, I thought it could have used more. For the frosting, I made a simple glaze from confectioners sugar, soy milk and vanilla. All in all was great, and I will definitely make it again !!!!!!!!!

This is my go-to recipe for cinnamon rolls.  Always a hit!  Although I've never made it in a bread machine, I always follow ANDYTAMI's directions on making them with a mixer. If you like the sweet taste of Izzy's Pizza I recommend using this recipe for your pizza dough as well as your cinnamon roll dough.

This recipe was good, but I overcooked it because it didn't brown the way suggested and by the time it did brown, all the cinnamon sugar had melted out the bottom and both bottom and top were hard as stale bread. My oven is 3 months old and a perfect tempature, so I know it was not that. Next time (and I will try it again using the exact timing) I will brush the top with egg yolk wash before baking. I can't give it a five star though because of the browning thing.

These are incredible! I cut down on the sugar all the way around, and used white sugar for the filling, since it's what I had. They turned out super fluffy and tender- total perfection. Family is 100% pleased and I will definitely make these again!

Holy yumm!!!! My husband and neighbors loved this. The husband normally doesn't even eat anything with cream cheese frosting (but I did it anyway for me haha) and he still ate them. He loved them! Thank you for this awesome recipe. I did add walnuts and raisins and it was great!

It was a good recipe in all, but I don't think it's worth the time and effort to make a dozen cinnamon rolls. The recipe also doesn't specify what 'ingredients' to put in the bread machine. You put the first section (up until the first space) into the bread machine. The second section is for the 'cinnamon-sugar' mix, and the third is for the topping. It was OK, but I am more satisfied with the ones you can just drive to your local baker and get.

I made this recipe except I added a half package of vanilla instant pudding and a quarter cup of water.  Everyone loved it!  I am making them again except I am going to try adding some apple pie filling when I roll the dough into buns.  I might also put toasted chopped pecans on them!

I chose this recipe mainly because I had a bread maker that was gathering dust in my kitchen (I usually make my bread by hand) and was feeling rather lazy on this Sunday.  This recipe is, in short, amazing.  I followed it exactly and took the advice of another reviewer, flipping the pan over for about 10 minutes as soon as they were done to let the filling run back over the rolls.  This results in filling that comes up and over the top of the roll just a bit, making it extra good!  I thought the frosting was good as well.  This recipe is a keeper and I'll definitely be using this one in the future.  There's nothing like cinnamon rolls with the bread maker doing half the work for you.

They were so good I could cry.  I had to add several Tbsp. more flour to get dough the right consistancy and the recipe didn't specify to roll the dough on short or long side (I did short side - and still ended up with 18 humongous cinnamon buns.)  These were incredible and the icing was perfectly amazing...SO MUCH like the actual Cinnabon buns.  YUM

I have tried a few recipes that claim to be just like Cinnabon but this one is the closest to it. I add more brown sugar and cinnamon to the filling. It's great.

Wow! This recipe is delicious. I didn't have bread flour, so I used all purpose. I also used melted butter instead of margarine, as I cannot compel myself to keep that nasty stuff in my house. I didn't use a bread machine either. Everything else I followed to a T. It was SO light and fluffy, the inside was gooey and delicious. Next time, I will make about 1/2 of the sugar mixture, because I left a lot out, and still there is a bit too much sugar inside.

Amazing! I don't have a bread machine and used the technique another user recommended of dissolving the yeast in the warm milk and then adding the rest of the ingredients and it turned out wonderful.

I have made this twice now and found the mixer with dough hooks works fine and I can leave the rolls covered in my 65 degree house overnight and bake in the morning.  I also spread only half the butter on the rolls and used more cream cheese in the icing.  Oooooh yum!

I thought this recipe was amazing, but there were a few things I didn't think we're like Cinnabon, the lack of filling, and the dough was a little dry/ hard. But I thought they were amazing, BUT then I tried Cinnamon rolls III... And they were infinitely lighter and softer and fluffier.but I kept this frosting, as this was perfect to me, and theirs seemed too high on the cheese. So I'll use their dough and this frosting and my own filling.

We tried this recipe this morning and there is just something about it that just isn't right. Too dense for a cinnamon roll and definitely make more of the filling(not quite double)! It is not a bad recipe but the roll itself was lacking. That being said, would be a fantastic kolache dough recipe!

this is my first well second time making cinnamon rolls and this recipe is the bomb... lol ok I have to tell you guys what I had to go through... bc I didnt pay attention to the flour that I needed to use. and I used all-purpose flour, it took me to wait like 2.5 hrs for this to rise..  and I didnt have a mixer.. so I had to knead it with my hand... and mix it with my hand...but it was all worth it. the frosting is amazing they are wonderful you won't be sorry..

This recipe was fantastic! I brought this to a bridal shower and everyone raved about it, the bride-to-be was even complimenting them in my thank you card! I took other reviewer's advice and flipped the pan so that all the drippings soaked back into the cinnamon buns rather than sticking to the pan. Also, if you're looking for more of a true cinnabon icing add in 1-2 tbsp of fresh lemon juice and you'll get that little bit of zing that this icing recipe is missing. You should be wipping the icing for at least 12 minutes to get the right texture. I will definitely be making these again.

Two things. For one, I know what I did wrong, and that was not having enough butter... SO the rolls came out good, but not the amazingly awesome taste i wanted. For two, even with the extra butter, it wouldn't quite be," A clone of a Cinnabon. " Though, I do like the rolls, not abad. I would reccomend cooking at 375 for about 20-25 minutes though, my rolls came out a little raw in the middle!

I used this recipe without a bread machine. The finished product lacked moisture and tenderness. The rolls were fluffy and rised decently- weren't too sugary either without the frosting.

WOW. This is truly THE BEST cinnamon roll recipe in the world! The rolls are light and fluffy, and has just the right amount of cinnamony sugar, and the glaze literally melts in your mouth. It is so delicious, and definitely a keeper. LOVE LOVE LOVE.

This is a VERY good recipe....very easy with breadmaker. A special note if you plan on doubling this recipe (by hand making): Do NOT put 2 dozen rolls in a large pan to cook.  The cinnamon rolls will NOT get done and there will be no way to salvage the undercooked middle ones.  (Believe me, I tried.) It's better to stick to using 2 9x13s.  :)

fantastic rolls... added re-hydrated blueberries instead of the usual raisins... maybe my oven temp is off, but I had to cook these cinnamon rolls nearly twice as long as recommended in the recipe...

Perfect cinnamon rolls!  My guys loved them!  I had self rising flour and omitted the salt and I had instant yeast. I added a teaspoon of surgar to the yeast with 1/4 cup warm milk and let it set for 10 minutes. I too do not have a bread machine and making them by hand was no problem. I also liked the tip of setting a bowl of hot water in the warm oven to help them rise. Thank you all.

This recipe is pretty good, but i think that this could be a lot better. I had made these a couple of times, and 2/3 times it came out of the oven undone. For one batch I put it in the oven for 2 more minutes, so they wouldn't scorch. Unfortunately, the rolls came out burned, and the baking pan came out oily. I actually saw the bottom of the cinnamon rolls, and I saw a coat of brown sugar and cinnamon on the bottom. The overall taste of them is ok, but I think that this recipe could use a little more work. Next time I make cinnamon rolls, I'm making a faster, less troubling recipe.

Made these for Easter brunch - huge success!  Soft, warm, full of flavour, yummy! Only change I made was to use store-bought cream cheese frosting, which was on sale for $1.50/jar. Definitely a keeper.

These were outstanding! I served them for Easter and got rave reviews!  I mixed the butter with the cinnamon and brown sugar, as someone suggested, and didn't have any problem with the filling dripping out (as others complained about).  The only issue was that it made so much icing, and I only used about half, which was still plenty.  Next time I would cut the icing recipe in half to avoid the waste.

I have to agree with some of the other reviews and say that my only complaint is that they came out slightly more dense than I wanted to.  Not horribly dense, but I tend to prefer my doughs to be very light and fluffy.  Overall, they were easy to make using my kitchenaid mixer.  I made one mistake and accidentally added the cinnamon to the dough; it actually tasted really good!  I still added some cinnamon to my filler (about 2 tsp). My family loved it!

It's a great recipe. Even though I'm not an experienced baker, the rolls were magnificent. All my family thought so. I don't have a bread machine so I kneaded the dought myself. Also I don't know what type of flour I used, I just had some wheat that was ground in the mill. At first, reading the comment of other persons that tried this recipe, I was a little bit scared that the dough won't rise but it was not the case. Definitely I will do this recipe again.

Cooking at 400 for 15 minutes didn't get the rolls done, yet they were very brown.  Next time, I will try 350 for 20 minutes or more.  Doubling frosting like others suggested made too much, may be 1 1/2 frosting recipe.  The rolls and frosting were wonderful & I will definitely try again.  I also removed from pan right away as suggested and had no problems with my filling oozing out.  I wasn't thinking and mixed the butter in with the brown sugar and cinnamon and just had to sprinkle on dough, but maybe this is what kept all of the good stuff from oozing out!

Followed this recipe exactly- it turned out fantastic! Had to add a touch more milk (approx 1 tbsp) while it was mixing since it was too dry, but other than that I followed it, and these were delicious. The only "bad" thing I have to say is that the icing had too strong of a cream cheese taste for my liking. Next time I will try an icing that isn't cream cheese based.

Wow these are so delicious.You have to make sure you roll the dough really thin.Here is Argentina the brown sugar is almost black.So it looks like the cinnamon rolls have chocolate in them.It's a great introduction to the people here to a great American recipe.

This recipe is amazing. This is one to use when you really want to impress someone with your skills. Can't wait to make it again. Probably tomorrow, because I am sure they will all be gone by tonight. :-)

wonderful!  I made exactly as stated, even though the dough seemed barely thicker than a thick batter.  Beautiful texture, rose up very nicely.  I think I'll use a different glaze next time, though, not sure what I didn't like about it... After reading lots of reviews, I used margarine in the dough but butter elsewhere, and baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  I think 20-22 min would do it though, since mine were a little well done on the bottom.  will definitely make again.

I have made these once so far and plan to make them again this weekend. They were Ah-Maz-Ing! I have never made anything with yeast before, so I was a bit nervous, but I just followed the directions given in the comment of AndyTami, since I don't have a bread machine, and they turned out perfectly! All rave reviews and now I have to make them for my Mother in law because she loved them so much!

My rolls are either raw in the middle or burnt on top and bottom. I've tried adjusting the temp and time. Not sure what I"m doing wrong. Also, the rolls on the end rise and are huge, I've tried cutting them smaller but there is always a piece that protrudes and burns.

Doesn't taste like a Cinnabon but still VERY good! Rolling out the dough was a little rough for me, so I didn't make the exact measurement they state in the recipe, but they turned out perfect anyway (flaws and all!).

These came out awesome!!  I am currently on mat leave and trying to get more into baking.  Was looking for a good cinnamon roll recipe and found this great one!  Followed the recipe (using the recommended non-breadmaker method) exactly.  One thing extra I did (which was the only good thing I got from a previous recipe I tried) was I added pecans, melted butter and some of the cinnamon/sugar mixture to the bottom of the pan.  When the rolls were done, I flipped the pan over onto a platter and the gooey goodness was the topping for the rolls.  Soooo yummy, but probably not the healthiest.  Thank you for this recipe...this is now my go to dessert special!!

WOW! These are delicious! They really do taste like the real thing. Made them exactly as the recipe says, plus frosting. I didn't have bread flour, so I measured 1 tablespoon of whole wheat flour into a 1  cup measuring cup and filled the rest with all-purpose flour. They came out perfectly. The dough is SO NICE to work with. Loved the brown sugar filling. Loved the frosting. This will be my new cinnamon roll recipe. I will gladly make these again! Thanks for the recipe, Marsha!

This was an easy and excellent recipe.  I do not have a bread maker so I used AndyTami's suggestions, worked perfectly!  I got 20 rolls out of the recipe, and used only 1 Tbsp. of Cinnamon as suggested, as well as mixed the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter together than spread.  They were wonderful.  Will continue to make.

these are perfect. I made Them for my family and they loved them. My husband ate one cold the next day and said they were still awesome which is nearly impossibly for a cinnamon roll. So so good. will definitely use this recipe again

The hardest part was rolling out the dough (wants to spring back). I had to put some muscle into it. If you include rising time, the prep time is closer to two hours. The rolls are very big. I made 1" cuts and I managed to squeeze out about sixteen rolls. I used a second pan. The frosting needs a good whiping, so pour on the power. I think they're better than cinnabon. Rich, moist, bubbling with cinnamon sugar and very yummy. A special family weekend treat.

They were okay, but not gooey, even after turning them upside down.  There are better recipes for cinnamon rolls.

These cinnamon buns are definitely the best. Although, don't make them for your family unless you want to be responsible for making them for every family gathering. My nieces love helping me with the cinnamon and sugar and rolling it all up!

These rolls are amazing!  My boyfriend raved about them for an hour after they were served and ended up eating three at one sitting (and they are big rolls!)  He said they were the best cinnamon rolls he'd ever had and that you could easily sell these at any bakery.  Honestly, I agreed!  This recipes is definitely a keeper!

I tried this for the big family after Christmas breakfast. I did the recipe times 4, made 36 large rolls. The only change I made was for the cinnamon, I only had half as much as the recipe called for. If I make these again I will stick with half the cinnamon. The only reason not to make these again would be time, the recipe is delicious!

Turned out great. I ended up getting twice as many rolls out of this recipe, because I cut them thin. Perfect amount of cinnamon sugar and the frosting is to die for!

These are outstanding! I've made them several times and they're always a huge hit. A couple of times, I've added chopped pecans to the middle filling, but they're also delicious as-is

I tried out this recipe for the first time yesterday (Thanksgiving Day). I used my Zojirushi Bread Maker on the dough setting. When I took out the dough, it was exactly like the video! Perfect texture! Not sticky, or too dry, it rolled out easily. For more space on the counter for rolling, I just used sections of waxed paper. 

After following the recipe exactly, I baked them in a glazed stoneware pan, (I have found that stoneware prevents the bottoms from overcooking when baking) and was actually quite astounded that the finished rolls really DID taste and look just like my favorite Cinnabons! My family absolutely loved them!

Tastes EXACTLY like a Cinnabon!  FYI: I would turn the heat a little lower if your oven cooks hot (like mine does) so you don't over-brown the tops and make them hard.  And double or triple the icing.  This is definitely a company-worthy dessert!  It's what I make for a 'special day breakfast' for my kids :)

I think this is a very good recipe. I love cinnamon and think that this could use a touch more for my preference. My husband however is not much on cinnamon and thought this was good. This was my first experience using my bread machine as well and was very excited.

These are amazing!!! The only thing I change is the amount of sugar- I found them to be too sweet the first time I made them, so now I always use only half of the sugar called for.

Definitely delicious. My friends raved about it. I figured 6K folks couldn't be wrong. I tried the suggestion of one person to combine the butter/cinn/sugar & spread it all at once onto the dough. I found that it was a little too dry & that was a real pain to do, but I managed. I think I may opt for the original method next time. I love raisins in my rolls, so I also sprinkled 1/2c of raisins in before I rolled them up. I bet pecans would be delicious too. Last mod I made was I followed the recommendation to bake at 350F for 20-25 mins instead of 400F. One thing I had trouble with is trying to roll out a rectangle! The dough simply doesn't form corners well, so when I rolled it up to cut it, the ones on the very end were not uniform w/ the rest, but they were still tasty. Very good recipe. (although one could argue that it is difficult to make a bad version of fresh dough laden w/ cinn/sugar & covered in sugar/cream cheese!) :D

This is the best recipes for cinnamon buns that I've run into.  I followed the recipe precisely (except for the bread flour - I just can't justify the money or the space - simply added 2 heaping tbsp of wheat gluten into a/p flour) and the dough required no 'tweaking' in my machine. Thank you to the reviewer who took the time to do the math to make the frosting using a whole 8 oz. box. 
  Having such a wonderful success, the frozen frosting won't last long.

I made this recipe today without the use of a bread machine.  I followed the recipe, and came away with the absolute BEST rolls I have ever made.  I usually add about a tablespoon of grated orange peel in my rolls, but didn't do that this time.  instead I added a bit of orange extract to the frosting.  Thank you to whomever came up with this.  I will be making these over and over again!

Absolutely AMAZING!! I made one batch of these for a family party, and my husband ended up eating half and I had to make another for the party.....which all completely disappeared! Just make sure you put time aside for them, letting them rise properly is a very important part of this recipe

These are the best cinnamon rolls ever!!!  There are only 2 of us so after we had a couple rolls a piece, I froze the rest in baggies for use on the weekends.  Just pop one out of the freezer and warm it up in the microwave.  What a treat on a chilly Saturday morning.  :)

Ok, this is awesome. I don't have a bread machine so I followed what everyone else said to do, and it worked. I brought them to work and everyone said they were amazing. I have to agree! I found that 1/3c of butter was not enough to cover the rolls so I had to add a little more, and next time I would probably use a little more brown sugar/cinnamon mixture, too. It was barely enough to coat the dough. They were extremely delicious and I will definitely make them again. The frosting is soooooooooooooo good too. It tastes exactly like Cinnabon!!!

Fabulous. Needed a snack for my son's leadership team meeting. He wanted cinnamon rolls, but I'd lost my best recipe. Decided to try these.  Amazingly glad we did. Never used brown sugar in the filling before. It's obvious now, but it's new to us. My husband was on his way to get butter for our 'practice run' when I we ran out of time, so used oil in the dough (won't use margarine for health reasons). Pleased with oil, though butter would probably taste better. Did use butter for the filling. Did add a touch of flour a couple of times while kneading the dough. When the dough only barely clung to the top, but cleaned the sides, I stopped adding flour. The dough was amazingly easy to handle, so I wondered if it would be tough, but not at all. Placed formed rolls in a glass casserole sprayed with Baker's Joy. When tops were nicely browned, the bottom wasn't browned at all, so I covered the rolls with foil until the bottoms were just a touch golden. The results? Incredlble! / Made another batch now using oil, half whole wheat, & sucanat (raw sugar). Also used sucanat in the filling. Stopped adding milk when tacky to the touch. Will make white rolls most of the time when sharing for special occasions with others, but we all really enjoyed the half-whole-wheat rolls.  They were gone in no time.  Being healthier, I'm sure that's what we'll continue to do most of the time. Good for dinner rolls too. //  Will try whole wheat without any white, but using some gluten, later in the weak.

Very good and easy too.  They make the house smell like a bakery.  I am going to make them again and try putting them in the fe fridge overnight and cooking them for breakfast. I wonder if you could prepare the rolls for cooking and freeze them individually for later use? I'll try that too! Thanks for a great recipe!

Three words. Yum, Yum and YUM! These are perfection. One of my absolute favorite all time recipes to make. They bake up beautiful, and are a perfect weekend morning breakfast treat. Only issue is we cannot finish a whole pan between two of us (actually yes we could, and then spend the rest of the weekend in the gym) :).....so I am going to see if I can freeze half of the dough. Thank you for sharing an absolute wonderful recipe that is a permanent favorite in my recipe book.

These were very easy to make, especially considering how good they are!  The dough is extremely forgiving, and rolls out beautifully.  I baked for 17 minutes to get the wonderfully browned rolls the way I wanted them.  Slightly crunchy on the outside, but nice and chewy on the inside.  The icing is amazing, and I am not ashamed to admit I licked the beaters clean!  Thank you- I will be making these often this fall and winter :)

I made this and added a package of instant vanilla pudding made as the directions on the package state. I also used a 1/2 lb of butter to spead over the rolled out dough. I give most of them away so I can use the 1 lb of butter, eat one and not feel too guilty.

great recipe...to keep the "filling" from coming out the bottom and keeping the entire roll sticky and gooey, add 1 tsp of Guar Gum to the cinnamon sugar..it'll help it stick inside the rolls.

These are incredible.  Everyone loved them.  The only change I made, was I added about 1/2 tbsp of milk to the frosting.  I found that it was too thick, not turning into frosting.  The milk made it just right.

2nd time making these now in 3 days....I didn't have room temperature eggs, so I zapped them in the microwave for 20 seconds, still in the shell.  Worked like a charm!

I made these for the first time for my family while my parents were visiting.  I am always skeptical when people compare their recipe to the original but I have to agree that these were extremely close and just as delicious!  I thought they were easy to make and everyone loved them...so much that I had to make sure I set one aside for myself to make sure I got one!  I personally don't like a ton of frosting so I scraped some off for me...but the rest of the family loved every scrumptious drop of the frosting!  Thanks for the recipe...it is a definite keeper!

I'd turn down the temperature and cook them a bit longer in order to make them be cooked all the way through.

My fave!! I no longer look longingly at Cinnabon and spend my money on their over priced deliciousness.... I just make them myself for a fraction of the price, and put anything I want on them (pecans, caramel topping)  I've made them 4 times for my hubby's office and he's brought home 2 empty platters each time!! Thats 12 rolls for the 7 people he works with... now thats sayin something!!!!! I recommend this to everyone I know with a sweet tooth and bread machine!!!!

This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and they were great. Very simple using the bread machine. The only thing is, it took a long time for the rolls to double in size. I had to let them sit over an hour. Probably because I am in Iowa in March and it is cold here. Also, I baked them for 15 min as the recipe stated, but it was a bit too long. They were very dark on top. I should have watched them closer, but once I added the frosting, you couldn't tell. They tasted great. The frosting is SOOO yummy!

My experience with Cinnamon Rolls was limited to ones that come in a can from the refrigerated section of the store... until now.  I recently inherited my mother's bread machine and decided to try this recipe out as it's been languishing in my recipe box forever.  I followed the dough directions exactly, but did add in 1 tsp of vanilla extract as some other reviewers suggested.  The filling is excellent as is - no changes needed!  I'm not a fan of cream cheese icing (I know... something must be wrong with me), so instead I used a simple confectioners sugar/milk mixture with a little vanilla extract for a glaze.  These really are amazing!  Very flavorful and gooey when eaten warm.  I will definitely be making these again... no more canned rolls for us!

Subbed the eggs with 1/3 c oil, used less flour, no cream cheese like I do in my own recipe and it still was AMAZING.

I made these for Christmas morning breakfast.  I made them 2 days ahead and popped them in the fridge for a slow rise. Then baked them on Christmas moning.  They were delicious!  The frosting was so good!  I didn't have bread flour, so I used all-purpose.  I also used regular yeast, and did not use a bread machine.   I will definitely make these again!

This is absolutely the best cinnamon roll recipe I have come across.  I have made it many many times and everyone loves it.  Also this year I made the rolls up ahead of time without baking them, wrapped them up good and put them in the freezer. Then on Christmas eve before we went to bed I set them out to raise. IN the morning I baked them and had wonderful fresh cinnamon rolls for Christmas breakfast.  Nothing better!

Loved this recipe! Not to mention your house smells like a bakery! I let it sit in fridge, covered, over night then placed in warm oven next morning.  While oven is preheating place them in there to double in size, they'll puff up beautifully!

I made this for my family for Christmas and they said it was by far the best cinnamon rolls they have ever had - My father in law couldn't stop eating them and he doesn't usually like cinnamon rolls!  I ended up refrigerating the dough overnight once it was done in the bread machine and finished up the rest of the steps Christmas morning.  So delish!

OMG! Here were my changes: I don't have a bread machine, so I did as many others had suggested with the warm liquid and yeast till foamy, adding the rest of the ingredients into my Kitchenaid w the dough hook. Kneaded by hand then let rise in a warm oven. I think the major change I made was that I used THREE heaping tablespoons of cinnamon- very much like cinnabon, ESPECIALLY when re-heated in the microwave! WOW!

I  made these for Christmas breakfast and they were gorgeous and delicious. I made them the night before without baking them and kept them in the frig. I then let them rise on top of my warm toaster oven because I was using my oven! They got huge and baked up beautifully. Almost took a picture of them. :)

Awesome. My first time at making cinnamon rolls. Used my stand mixer to knead them until ready. I had no filling 'escape' and only cooked them for about 13 minutes. I doubled the frosting. I will keep this recipe for every. This was really easy to do!

I tried this recipe 3 times this month and each time turned out differently is the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review. The first time the dough didn't rise at all. The second time, it barely rose at all but I continued to make the rolls and they tasted great but were the size of the ones you buy in the roll at the grocery store. The dough the second time was gorgeous though! Perfect texture and not too wet or dry. Today was the third time and it was a wet mess. I had to add a ton of extra flour. The icing is wonderful. They are a wonderful roll. Oh, and I'm making my by hand and not in a bread machine. Thanks for sharing!

I took a shortcut because I was too impatient to make the dough. Bridgeford Dough was on sale at my grocery store so I picked up a package (3 loaves included).  I used the ingredients specified for all three loaves combined. I let the rolls defrost in the fridge - this made them triple in size. My husband forgot to add butter to the insides of our last batch. In a pinch I grabbed butter and placed 1/2T atop each roll. These actually made them taste so much better. This made a sauce accumulate at the bottom of the baking dish.  Immediately after baking, I flipped the rolls upside down so that the sauce would flow down the sides so all sides are coated.  I doubled the cream cheese sauce and added it to the buns right after they came out of the oven and flipped the buns.  Awesome....going to make more tomorrow night. :)

These cinnamon rolls are so easy and absolutely delicious.  Sure beats my old recipe.  Using the bread machine is a real time saver!!  The cream cheese frosting is simply the best.

these are THE BEST cinnamon buns!! i generally double the recipe so i can freeze them so when im craving something sweet i always have one on hand. i generally make them at night so i dont have to mess with them in the morning and since i haven't mastered slicing them...i end up with GIGANTIC buns since they sit "rising" in the fridge overnite. but it's ok they're worth it and im not complaining. five stars doesnt do the rating system justice. goodbye store/chains! this is all you'll ever need! in one word SCRUMPTOUS....

Wowsers!  We loved these and I will definitely make them again and teach my daughters to make them too!  I used 8oz of cream cheese instead of the 3.  That made the frosting a little too thick so I added a tsp. of milk.

Made these Thanksgiving morning.  My famiy loved them.  I used 2 round baking pans.  I frosted one, and left the other without cream cheese frosting.  I did use my breadmachine and turned upside down.  I'm about to make another batch now.  I'm going to try doing the dough the night before and then just putting in the oven.

I work til 6pm every Christmas Eve, and the teenagers in my house demand them for Christmas morning, so I whip them up and let them rise overnight on top on the fridge (nice and warm!!), pop them in the oven in the morning, and ice them  after cooling.  They are huge and light!!  I've made these every Christmas for at least 15 years I think!!  Thanks for the recipe, has made for wonderful memories!!

I scaled to 8 servings as 3 cups of flour works best for my bread machine. This is what I use: 1 cup milk, 2 eggs, 3 tbsps butter, 1 tsp Butery Sweet Dough baking emulsion, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/3 cup vanilla sugar, 1 tbsp yeast, 1 tbsp vital gluten flour, and 3 cups all purpose flour. I rolled out to 12x24 inches, topped with 1/4 cup butter melted and 1 cup brown sugar and 2 tbsps cinnamon combined. Cut into 12 rolls, 2 inches each. Preheat oven to 400, when I put the rolls in I reduce to 350, bake for 30 minutes, turning and covering with foil halfway through. Frosting 2 oz each cream cheese and butter beaten, add 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 cup icing sugar. Very good and house smells delish!

Great recipe! The only change I made was I added a little milk to the frosting to make it more pourable. I usually place the rolls covered in the fridge overnight after the second rising and bake the next morning and store the leftovers in the fridge, heating them in the microwave when needed. They are still delicious even after a day or two in the fridge. Definitely give these a try-they are worth it.

Excellent recipe.  The dough is very rich, and makes for a dense, and yet, fluffy cinnamon roll.  I usually double the butter/cinnamon/sugar for the middle of rolls, but there is no need for this recipe - there is plenty of filling to make the middle of these rolls yummy and flavorful.  There is a LOT of cinnamon - which I really liked, but I wouldn't add anymore.  I will absolutely make these again.

First of all, I have to say, I have made cinnamon buns several times before, and they have NEVER turned out. I'm not very good at baking, and breads are among my worst things to make. But this recipe worked!!!!!! They were amazing!!!!!! To top it off, I didn't read the reviews before I started, and ended up using all purpose flour. I did have to let mine rise a little longer than the 30 mins, but they still turned out fantastic!! Definitely a keeper!!! Thank you so much!!

This recipe was so delicious!!! I had a little bit of trouble when I was making the dough because I don't have a bread machine. I actually don't think I did this right, but I just added a packet of active dry yeast to the warm milk and let it set...which it didn't do very well. The dough only rose by about 1/3 of its original size, but I kneaded it down and let it rise after I put in the filling and cut it, and it did ok! I got rave reviews! DELICIOUS

These cinnamon rolls were absolutely fabulous. Like many other cooks on here, I do not have a bread machine (hopefully will get one for Christmas), so I was grateful to find the substitutions for making this without the bread machine.  Everything else, I followed to the T. The rolls came out delicious. While they do not taste just like Cinnabon, they are close. If you really want to get these closer to Cinnabon, I would add even more cinnamon and brown sugar and probably made the rolls a bit bigger in themselves by rolling them up on the short side and making 6 of them in a 9 x 9 pan. But, doing them this way was fine. Some cooks said it was too much cinnamon/sugar mix, but if you love cinnamon, you could add even more and be OK. Thanks for the recipe! I will make these again very soon, when my waistline recovers from this batch .

My sister and I made these, following the alternate instructions for people without bread machines, and they came out *exactly* like the cinnabons sold at the mall. Also, we followed another commenter's suggestion to flip the cinnabons after they were taken out of the oven so that the gooey insides wouldn't sink to the bottom. Oh, and baking the cinnabons for only 15 minutes yielded an underdone batch for us; popping them in the microwave for an additional 30 seconds helped.

Amazing!!!  Just perfect and just what I was looking for.  After all the recipes I tried, this one was 150% right on the money!  Just like a Cinzeo cinnamon bun!  Rave reviews!

These came out perfect. The only things I did differently was used the hand method rather than a bread machine and instead of 15 min in the oven, I put them in for and 25 until they were golden brown. My boyfriend loves them!

These are the best cinnamon rolls ever. I myself don't eat treats like this but I actually had a full one.They are especially good with this frosting: Caramel Frosting 1 stick butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 cup milk, 1 tsp vanilla, 2 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Blend in brown sugar, and salt. Cook on low for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add milk. Remove from heat and add vanilla. Let cool then add powdered sugar. :)

These were a bit too big and dense for me I prefer a lighter cinnamon bun. It may be a clone of cinnabon but I have never eaten at cinnabon as a comparison.

What can I say? These are spectacular. The only thing I will change on the next go-round is the rolled out pastry dimensions. The rolls were too tall and narrow, but no big deal, I flattened them a bit and they were perfect.

These were awesome!  I used sub sugar and brown sugar, and they still tasted just like Cinnabon!  I didn't do well on making the icing.  The icing looked like tinted cottage cheese.

These are sooooooo good!! I added a little milk to the frosting to thin it out some.  I also made it the night before to have it ready to throw in the oven in the morning for breakfast. They turned out great and were a huge hit in our house!

Always comes out GREAT!  I usually put the finished rolls in the fridge before I cook them over night and by the morning they have doubled in size.  I always double the icing and cook them right before work and the are still warm when I get there.  Everyone loves them and always ask me to make them.  So delicious, I think it's better than Cinnabon!

Insanely good.  WAY BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!  I make the dough by hand and use butter instead of margarine.  Let's be serious, you shouldn't use margarine for any baking.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe.  They freeze and refrigerate well too!!!!

amazing! I did everything as is in the recipe and then flipped over the pan to let the drippings back through the rolls. I always double up on the icing since that is the best part! Yummy!

Yummmmmmm! This tastes exactly like a cinnabon! Every once in a while I get a craving for a cinnabon...what a relief to find such a great recipe! I have made this recipe twice and each time it turned out great! Its also a great recipe to do with kids :). I had to let it rise and bake for a lot longer than the recipe called for...so beware about the extra time. But it is sooooo worth it!

These are the BEST. Every bit as good as Cinnabon. And they're significantly easier and less time consuming than any other recipe out there. You really don't need a bread machine either. Amazing!

Unbelievably good.  I made these rolls a few years back and couldn't believe how good they were.  Hard to believe that they are homemade.  I think they are actually better than Cinnabon. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS RECIPE. I would give it 10 stars if I could.

Easy enough to do often but we are keeping this for special occasions because even though you make them at home they are still a guilty pleasure! I didn't have bread machine either and was easy as could be in the Kitchen Aide. I had to use granulated sugar since I left my paid for powdered at the store :(. Don't do it if you don't have to. The frosting has too much of a crunch. I froze the leftovers to pop in the microwave for a treat!

These were really yummy! I added raspberries to mine! I just rolled them up with the cinnamon and sugar. They were incredible. I also took the advice of flipping them over, it worked out great!

I made these for a crowd and they received RAVE reviews. I didn't have cream cheese so made a simple icing sugar glaze. I also let them rise once assembled for a loooong time due to a scheduling problem. Probably about 2.5-3 hours! They were described as light and fluffy, beyond normal cinnamon buns, into the realm of "gourmet." Not bad for a first timer, lol!

This recipe was absolutely amazing, and so much fun to make. I do agree with how its good to refrigerate them overnight to bake them fresh for the next morning. I made the icing in about 5 minutes and spread it over them as soon as they came out of the oven. I had one co-worker who ate almost the entire batch. Id reccomend the recipe to anyone whos looking to make an awesome breakfast. :)

Just can say... Oh my God! I lived in the States for a year and there are certain flavours I really miss. When I tried this Cinnabons It was like been there again.  My kids love it and I've decided to make it the "special" for the morning of the Three Kings breaksfast.

amazing recipe! I messed up with my bread machine, threw the ingredients in in the wrong order so I had to knead it by hand, still turned out amazing! I mixed in the entire 8 oz of cream cheese into the icing so it had a stronger flavor

Made them last night for the family. They went crazy over them. I asked my sister to blend the cream cheese frosting. Bad idea!!! She ended up eating half of it before I even got a chance to put it on the rolls!  My little brother who is very picky LOVED THEM! I had never seen him stuff so many cinnamon rolls in his mouth! So did my nephews and rest of the family!

I just made these and the recipe is AMAZING !! However mine did not come out as fluffy as the pic but they tasted to die for. I could only eat 1 because they were very heavy and sweet. :)

These were fabulous, my family loved them.  I think the only thing I might do different is a little less cinnamon next time.  I loved that you made the dough in the bread machine.

Easy and delicious, have made these numerous times always without the icing and they never last past the day they are made. I have also made them for numerous family functions and everyone always asks for the recipe/more.

I made these exactly as directed, with the exception of all purpose flour instead of bread flour. They turned out great! I didn't have problems with the filling seeping out, they are perfect. Do they taste like Cinnabon? I don't really think so, but they are still the best that I have ever made... It's good if you're going to be around the house all evening to work on them. They don't take an unreasonable amount of time, but you have to be available to do little bits and pieces of the process over several hours! We will definitely make these again!

The brown sugar in the center melted to the bottom of the pan and burnt before the buns were cooked.   After I cut off the bottoms, they were good.   Next time, I will try using only use a little regular sugar with the cinnamon.

get a bread machine if you want to make this. i made these w/o one, and they turned out great, but it took FOREVER to get the yeast at the perfect temperature. doubling the frosting recipe is a must. theses guys were sooo good!

Amazing cinnamon rolls (haven't had Cinnabon in years)!  Beware to fully bake - mine were golden brown on top, but some were still doughy. I popped them back in the oven for a few mins (on a lower rack) and they came out perfect.  I followed another's advice and turned the pan upside down as soon as they came out of the oven.

I made them exactly as the recipe called for, except that I did the dough by hand instead of bread machine. I personally prefer a sweeter dough for my cinnamon rolls, but this was excellent. I will probably try them with a little more sugar in the dough next time, and a little less in the filling. The frosting was awesome. It was the best cinnamon roll frosting I have made. That is the one thing my family commented on more than anything else about this recipe. All of them want me to make this again.

What a great recipe! My husband loved them (polished off one straight out of the oven and another one shortly thereafter!) I followed some of the suggestions and flipped them over right away. I didn't really find however that much of the filling had escaped. I also mixed my butter, sugar and cinnamon together and spread it out before rolling it up. Oh, and I dont have any margarine so I used butter. I'll definitely make these again!

These are amazing!  It was my first time making cinnamon rolls from scratch, but they turned out really yummy!  A couple of suggestions for others making this....after you put the rolls in the pan, let them rise for an hour so they get nice and big. Also, double the icing....what the recipe calls for is not enough. After making these a couple of times I HIGHLY recommend using a glass dish, they came out perfectly (in a metal dish they didn't bake evenly). Delicious!!

I started these at 4pm and it was officially finished at 9pm.  The 3 hours is maybe if this was ALL you have to do all night/day.  Delicious and WELL worth the time and effort though!!!!

This recipe is awesome! Just like those from Cinnabon. I followed most part of the recipe, except for the amount of sugar used in filling , I ended only using 2/3 of the amount it calls for. Also, for the frosing, I used 20g less.  It came out great. I refridgerated the cinnabon before baking. I think it would be better if I let it sit at the counter for an hour before baking, so it will give a better rise for the roll.

I only use 2 Tbl. of butter on the dough before sprinkling on the brown sugar/cinnamon mix.  I never have any of the filling leak out, and we don't miss the extra butter.

AWESOME!!!  also, you can make the rolls the night before, then refrigerate them overnight.  Set them out on your counter for about 1 or 1.5 hours before you cook them to let them rise, then bake.  Fantastic!

I took a reviewer's tip and mixed the butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar together. I microwaved the mixture at 2- 15 second intervals which made it way easy to slather on the rolls. It didn't melt away at the bottom while cooking.

The dough it's self tasted excellent.  But I agree with other reviewers - they were extremely dry and all the filling oozed out all over the muffin pan.  I won't be making these again.  Maybe use less flour or all purpose flour.

These rolls are good. For my icing I used white cholcolate chips and sour cream since I didnt have any cream cheese. They were very good.

This was the very first time I've ever made cinnamon rolls from scratch. I followed this recipe exactly and these came out wonderfully! Very tasty and the texture is divine! I didn't have the appropriate pan, so I used two 9" cake pans that worked just as well.

When I get a craving for cinnamon rolls, these are my go-to. I LOVE them so much. I've made them usually by hand, but I just got a bread machine and am happy to see it the way the original recipes calls for. I haven't tried it the bread machine way (it is in the oven now -- eeep!!), but I assure you these are the best cinnamon rolls around -- be prepared not to enjoy any others recipes, because these will ruin everyone's dry rendition of cinnamon rolls!! Best around...I'd give this recipes more than 5 stars if there were such an option! Thanks for the superb recipe!!

I think that these are actually better that cinnabon.  They are not quite as sweet and rich and so they don't make you feel kid of sick towards the end of eating them.  Easy recipe to make - I usually do mine in the bread machine.  I also let these rise overnight in the refrigerator to bake off the next morning and it has always worked well for me.  Love these, will continue making them for my family for years!

These are incredible! I recommend adding a bit more vanilla to the frosting to make it taste a bit less powdered-sugary, and adding a little bit of almond extract to the dough for a slight (and delicious) kick. That's optional though -- they're still fanastic!

I've never had a cinnabon so I have no comparison, but these were great. I only had Active Dry yeast so I just let them rise twice. They are awesome!

Soooo delish! I've never had a cinnabon from the store, but I can't imagine them being tastier than these! For the dough, I actually use the recipe for amish white bread off this site...it is much simpler and we have a dairy allergy in the family, and amish white white bread doesn't contain any dairy. The filling and the cream cheese frosting are wonderful!

I may be stating something that has already been said several times already....but these are fantastic. Made them with my hand-mixer and then refrigerated the prepared rolls overnight. All I had to do was pop them in the oven this morning. So easy! And they turned out great. If you love cinnamon rolls you have to try these!

These were AMAZING! I don't have a bread machine, but they were quite simple to make. They turned out extremely soft, and had enough cinnamon topping. Absolutely to die for- will definately make again!

#1 MOST IMPORTANT TIP!!!!!: make a full batch of frosting by using the whole 8 oz cube of cream cheese: 2/3 c butter, 3+3/4 c powdered sugar, 1+1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 tsp salt. the frosting is the BEST part and trust me, you'll be glaaad there's plenty to go around! I used all purpose flour and they came out perrrfectly. Also used the tips on how to do it without a bread machine.

These were fantastic!  I had to wait to make them until I went to a friend's house that has a bread maker, but they were delicious.  I wasn't excited about having to roll them out, but they were well worth it. I think I left them in the oven a few minutes longer than the recipe said because they didn't seem golden brown enough.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Yet another vote in favour. These actually taste just like cinnabons. I was surprised - I only expected them to be good cinnamon rolls but the texture is spot-on. My only recommendation is to make more of the cinnamon filling, since cinnabons tend to be gooey-er, but I like these the way they are. Fabulous recipe.

For me this was too much work for a result that was just OK. I also was not a fan of the cream cheese in the glaze. I used less than listed and it was still all I could taste. I hate to say but I will buy the can version still.

Was very good and easy, I liked the fact you can make the dough in the bread machine.  I will make this again but next time I will cut back on the cinnamon, it was jaut way to much.  I didn't have any cream cheese so I just made a powdered sugar frosting and it was perfect with them!!

This recipe is fantastic! After the first time I made this I changed it slightly. My bread machine seems to let the dough rise more than necessary so I halved the dough once it was ready to roll out. The two smaller rolls are easier to handle and then the recipe turns out smaller, more reasonable proportions. The rolls also stay nice and soft longer than other recipes.

Personally, way too much cinnamon for me.  I would recommend combining the butter with the cinnamon sugar mixture, that way the dough won't fully absorb the butter.  Also, I cooked at 380 for 10 minutes and they were over done.  Will try at 350 with half as much cinnamon next time.

These were good, but frankly, I don't think they were better than Pillsbury Grands, so I'm not sure it was worth the trouble. That said, I served them to a group of women who loved them and wanted the recipe. Btw, I followed the recipe as is and didn't have any problems.

These were great!  They cooked in to huuuge rolls, but the taste was awesome--especially with the icing!  I will definitely hold on to this recipe.

Sooo good and easy to make with a bread machine.  Stuck them in the fridge the night before and baked them in the morning. I also doubled the frosting.

Seriously SOOOOOO good!!! They took some time but they were definitely worth the wait! My husband kept saying that I should have just bought a can of them for .99 cents until he saw them. Then he said they were worth the time and effort! YUM!

My fiance doesn't even like cinnamon rolls, but when I make these I have to hide them if I want to get one. I think I just might have won over his dad with these too. They are wonderful, gooey, sweet, deliciousness. Even better than the cinnabon I think. They're a little time consuming, so you definately want to plan ahead, but they are ABSOLUTELY worth the wait!

This was close to perfect. It seems that every recipe is per our own taste and mine called for it to be a little more moist. I think I will add a little oil to this recipe to see if that helps the dryness. It wasn't too dry but a little. Otherwise....... AWESOME!!!!!

Delicious!  The only change I made was using an entire package of cream cheese in the icing instead of just 3 ounces.

This is the best cinnamon roll recipe in the world! I did what one review said about mixing the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon and then spreading it on, and it did not even drip out when I cooked it. My husband has told me we can never go back to any other recipe or cinnabon! Thanks.

Yummy!  My 3 kids loved them.  They said they were better than the ones in the mall or any that I bought in the store.  Easy to make as well.  I used my mixer with the dough attachment & they came out fine. I cooked them for 30 minutes & they were perfect.   Will make again.

Really yummy cinnamon rolls.  The only thing is when I pulled them out of the oven they still seemed doughy and not done.  I had already iced them as the top looked brown, but decided to put them back in to let the bottom finish cooking.  I put foil over them so the icing wouldn't burn.  Let them cook a little longer (5 - 7 mins) and then pulled them out a second time.  Gooey, yummy, sweet treats.  I couldn't imagine eating more than one in a setting.  I think I will freeze the rest and save them for a gathering we're having this weekend.

These are awesome!!  This was my second recipe I used in my bread machine and I am definitely an amateur when it comes to baking.  My husband who does not hold back with compliments (or complaints) said they were unbelievable and couldn't believe I made them all by myself! The only change I made was I mixed the brown sugar and cinnamon with the butter before I spread it on. If they didn't have so many calories I'd make them every week!

This was not only my first attempt on cinnamon rolls...but my first from scratch bread product period! I did not use a bread machine. I followed others suggestions of making the dough without the machine. I used my 9X13 Pampered Chef stone and lined it with parchment paper. They turned out wonderful! Very good reheated the next day to...1 min in the microwave and presto! Warm and gooey all over again!!!

These are ridiculously DEE-lish!  I followed some advice and combined the filling (brown sugar, cinnamon, butter) and then spread it on the dough.  Other than that I did not alter the recipe or ingredients.   I didn't have any problems and they came out PERFECT! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

AMAZING! I felt like a rock star after making these and sharing them with people. I can't wait to make them again.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the recipe for frosting makes way too much. It's delicious, sure, but half the frosting recipe is plenty. Also I used real butter, not margarine, for the roll recipe.  Besides those little things, this recipe is awesome.

I cannot believe how EASY it was to make these cinnamon rolls using the bread machine.  My eggs weren't at room temperature and I didn't measure the milk's temperature, but there is no sign that those 2 factors had any negative effect.  I did follow one reviewer's advice to mix melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together and spread over the dough.  It wasn't a spreading consistency and was impossible to get evenly spread, but the end result was fine and it didn't run out into the bottom of the pan using this method.  I did not use wax paper in the bottom of the pan or flip them out as soon as they were done.  I left them in the pan for several hours and they came right out.  I don't know for sure if this is because of using the melted butter/sugar mix or not, but I had no problems in this area whatsoever like some other reviewers have had.  This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and I'm hooked.  I've never had a Cinabon, but if this is what they taste like, they're great.  I have had Grands cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing, which I love and I would put these in the same gooey, texture category as a Grands...minus the "canned" taste.  I also thought the amount of butter/sugar was perfect and the amount of icing was perfect also.  The only thing I don't like is that by using the bread machine, I'm limited to making a batch of 12 rolls.  SUPER RECIPE!!!

This recipe is amazing!  It tastes exactly like a cinnabon! I would recommend not to  put as much cinnamon but either way it tastes great!   The cream cheese frosting was great to!

Fantastic! I don't have a bread machine so I followed the directions suggested by others and they turned out great.  My family said: they were BETTER than Cinnabon because they weren't hard or dry at all and that the whole thing was like the middle which is the best part! Definately a keeper.

Dough will be a bit sticky so I used a fair portion of flour to help roll it out. I put the butter on the dough and then sprinkled the sugar cinnamon on and there was no leaking filling after baking. Great recipe.

Flavor wise, these rolls were amazing!  However, they seemed dry to me and didn't 'puff up' the way I had expected them to.  Wouldn't mind hearing from others as to what I might have done wrong...??  Doubled the frosting, as suggested by many others.  My son devoured them!  Told him that they would be even better next time - once I find out what went wrong with the dough.  Will for sure make again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were so wonderful!  Easy too.  The dough rolled out very nice.  I followed the recipe, but baked at 375.  As soon as they came out of the oven I turned them onto waxed paper, so as to use all of the delicious filling.  I can't wait to make them again!

maybe i made them wrong, even though I thought I followed the recipe to a tee....however, they were hard and dry and didn't taste that great to me. However, my husband and his family did enjoy them (but I think what they really liked was the cream cheese mix!)

Excellent recipe!!  Once I formed the rolls, I put them in the fridge (covered) overnight and cooked them in the morning.  I doubled the frosting and used most of the extra - although not quite all.  I also made several more than 12 - but smaller than the massive rolls you find at the mall.  GREAT recipe - never have had success with cinnamon rolls before and these literally taste like the huge ones you get in the mall.  Thanks!

I made this for the first time Christmas morning. Thought it would be a nice surprise to get up extra early and make a nice homemade breakfast for the whole family. These were such a huge hit with everyone, they started to accuse me of going to the local mall and buying them from cinnabon. Did not change anything. This has started to become a regular on weekends. Awesome recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  If you want these to taste just like a Cinnabon, try using Korinje cinnamon.  Its available at gourmet stores, the Pampered Chef and online.  You can't use enough regular cinnamon to re-create the taste of the real thing.

Excellent.. excellent.. excellent. I made no changes to the recipe and everyone loved it. My 16 year old loved it so much, she kept saying "mmm, this is reallllly good, this is better than a cinnabon".  This is definitely a keeper.

My family loved the bread portion but preferred the filling & topping from my bread maker recipe book.  Filling: 1/2 Cup butter, 1/3 Cup sugar, 3 Tablespoons cinnamon. Melt butter, combine all, spread on rolled out dough.  Topping: 3/4 Cup butter, 1 1/2 Cup light brown sugar. We don't use the cream cheese.

Amazingly similar to the yummy Cinnabon cinnamon rolls.  Stuck to the recipe as stated and turned out perfect :)

These are the best, they are so yummy.  Since I didn't have a big enough surface to make one huge rectangle shape, I cut the dough in half and made 2 rectangles and still rolled it the way I would have if they were big.  Worked out perfectly and they were so good this is a keeper recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly (though made my rolls by hand instead of a bread machine) .. and they are awesome!  I guess the only difference I had was that there was no way my rolls were fitting in a 9x13 pan.  I put 5 rolls in 8x8 pan, and 6 rolls in an 8x12 pan.  They fit just right.  I was a little curious about the 400 degrees and 15 min cooking.  When I ate a roll right out of the oven it was a little doughy/gooey, but I like them that way!!  Tasted amazing!!  But, as the rolls sat a few hours until we ate them for supper the doughy-ness was gone and they were still very soft and delicious.  I say this for those who may, or may not, like that doughy type of roll.  Very, very good rolls.  I plan to try out the "soft, moist, and gooey cinnamon roll" recipe to see which I like better.  I will absolutely make this again.

OMG, my family LOVES this recipe!  Delicious!  I don't have a bread machine, so I mix the dough in my stand mixer, about 5 min., until the dough clings to the hook.  I had to add a little extra flour to keep the dough from sticking.  These rolls are huge!  I  make 24 smaller rolls and freeze half of them to bake later.

Yum, yum, yum!!  I've been searching for a reliable cinnamon bun recipe and this is it!  This was very easy to make and turned out amazing.  I made the dough the night before shaped the buns and refrigerated them overnight, took them out for 30 mins then baked them.  Everyone raved about them and they were gone in a blink.  I though I might need some extra icing but it worked out perfectly, I did cut some of the sugar out of the icing, it was just a tad on the sweet side but that is personal taste.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe!!

Stellar. My husband made the dough for these on Christmas eve in the bread machine, and then I assembled them Christmas morning. Absolutely delicious, and they were great reheated in the microwave too.

Words from my boys. "Oh my gosh, these are awesome."  "This is the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had." I must say I completely agree! The only thing I didn't know was which way to roll them since I am new at making them.  Other than that, wonderful!

I think there is too much sugar in the filling but overall it was a crowd pleaser.  Might also benefit from some butter basted over the top before baking.

they are sooooooooo good and DO taste exactly like a cinnabon!! I made them for Christmas breakfast this year & made 2 for everyone and they were GONE..!!   my only suggestion would be to make a little extra of the butter /cinnamon mix and with a pastry brush put it on the outside of the buns once they are in the dish. The outside of my buns came out a little flaky and i prefer them a little softer thats why i suggested the butter. Other than that they were AMAZING!!

I made these for my family on Christmas morning and I will be making them again this morning to start the new year.    I bake cinnamon buns regularly and I have tried several good recipes but these are truly outstanding ! And the frosting - which I am not usually fond of as I always find that it is too sweet for my taste - is simply delicious ! A great recipe.

Awesome.  I'm not a fan of preparing bread dough, but when I saw this receipe I had to try it.  Our Christmas tradition has always been to have cinnamon rolls on Christmas morning but I've used Pillsbery canned.  I will never do that again, these will be our new Christmas tradition.  I followed the receipe exactly as it's written, prepared them the day before, then put them in the frig.  I took them out and let them sit for 30 minutes, then put them in a warm oven (about 150 degrees) for another 30 minutes.  Then I cranked up the temp to start the cooking process.  They came out perfect.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I make cinnamon rolls every year for Christmas and these were the best I have ever made!!  Followed all the helps... no bread machine - let rise in oven, dumped the rolls upside down on a tray, etc.  Thank for making me a "star".  These truly are supreme.

Ok, so I have had this recipe saved for over 2 years, and for some reason I was too intimidated to try them.  I have never made cinnamon rolls before, so today was my first attempt.  These turned out perfectly!  They were so easy to make with the bread machine.  When they came out of the oven we were all so excited to try them that we were literally burning our mouths as we ate!  All my husband and son could say was Mmmmm!  They are absolutely the best cinnamon rolls ever!

These are just beyond amazing. I couldn't find "bread flour" at my store, so I used all-purpose flour and it's hard to imagine that they could get any better! I did also use extra filling to make them super-gooey inside (it worked!). They were soft, gooey, and completely decadent. Definitely worth the work and wait. This recipe will be our new Christmas morning tradition.

I can't believe how great these are. I followed directions, but added a lot more (5oz) cream cheese to the frosting. Also, I melted 1/4c of butter in a saucepan and stirred in 1/4c brown sugar until it was dissolved and poured it over the rolls after they were done baking to add extra goo. Also, as other suggested, lowered temp to 350 and baked about 20-25 mins.

Sooo yummy, to die for cinnamon buns.  This goes BEYOND anything Cinnabon or other commercial brands would make.  These were a hit at Christmas morning breakfast -- two years in a row!!   (You can make the same glaze without the cream cheese for those friends and family who can't have cheese.)

Perfect dough for sweet rolls.  I used real butter instead of margarine, since I had it on hand and knew the rolls wouldn't need to last.  The only change I made to the filling was that I added 1 c of chopped toasted pecans and mixed the filling ingredients together. I then sprinkled that filling over the dough and rolled it in. The filling stayed put - no drips.  Also pre-made these rolls and kept them in the fridge overnight.  I brought them out for about 30 min before baking.  They weren't fully risen, as one other reviewer noted, but rose perfectly in the oven.    Light and tasty - definitely to be eaten right away.

This was actually quite easy to make.  I followed all directions, except I put mine in the frig after I rolled them up and put them in the pan.  Then I sat them out for 30 minutes the next morning and baked them on 350 for 25 minutes.  I also flipped as recommended by others.  They were great, but I didn't really care much for the cream cheese topping, but that had nothing to do with the recipe probably, just personal preference.

These are amazing, it's important to knead VERY well and use bread flour not all purpose if you want them chewy. I use Cream cheese frosting II from this site.

I followed the directions that ANDYTAMI left, since I don't have a bread machine.  I preheated my oven to 200 degrees and then TURNED THE OVEN OFF so  the dough could rise and that worked great.  The only thing I changed was I baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  These were TO DIE FOR.  Only problem I had was after forming them into the rolls, they didn't rise much the second time around, but they turned out beautifully.  WILL BE MAKING AGAIN!

Definitely one of the BEST recipes I've used on this site! I'll need to find the self control needed to not make these all the time! Crazy easy to make and even easier to eat =D  The only things I did differently was I mixed the butter, cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkled it on top of the dough before rolling. I also used the whipped cream cheese. Both changes didn't change the amazing taste of this recipe!

These are the best!!! I've made them several times and they are always gobbled up faster than I could bake more... I do use butter instead of Marg. I find it tastes better. And I've used dark brown sugar and it seems to make them goey-er!!! MMM

Given this recipe, you'd have to be crazy to ever buy another cinnamon roll in the store again!  We thought the cream cheese icing was gilding the lily, so we used a simple sugar glaze (1-1/2 cups powdered sugar, splash of vanilla, 1/3 cup milk).  These are scrumptious!

I'm not sure why I waited so long so make these, but better later than never.  Delicious!   The rating and reviews say it all.  I did invert my pan into another 9 x 13 after they had finished baking. Plus based on several reviews turned my oven down to 375* and slightly undercooked. Thanks, Marsha!!

I've made these rolls during the Christmas Vacation.  They are the "BEST".  And so EASY. I keep 3 at home for me, my husband and son. I ship the rest over to my sisters house to avoid eating them all. (she has 4 children).  I plan to make this recipe a part of my Christmas vacation for years to come (along w/my Emeril's French Onion Soup).  Their both keepers

These are amazing! I actually wasn't paying attention after I rolled them out and added the butter (prior to the cinnamon/sugar mixture) and didn't get quite enough on there - but they were so delicious regardless!  They do taste EXACTLY like Cinnabon!  They were perfect for a holiday morning!

Does this recipe need more reviews?  Why yes it does.  Even a baking novice like me was able to pull it off and it was full of yum.  Did nothing different and it turned out perfect.

So delicious!  My husband had 2 right out of the oven.  Very tasty.  This recipe was easy to make, I enjoyed it a lot.  I didn't have a bread mixer, so I took the advice of one of the reviewers and made the dough by hand, and it turned out fabulous!  I didn't have 2 eggs and so I had to substitute one of the eggs with 3 Tbs. of mayonnaise.  The end product turned out delicious.  The frosting really made it taste like the cinnabons at the mall.  Love it!  I will be making it again.

It was my first time doing cinnamon rolls and I absoloutly loved this recipe. I dont have a bread machine so I used my mixer with the bread attachment and it worked out perfect. The only thing I'll do the next time is use less sugar for the frosting it was too sweet for me. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Been making these for years. A real no fail by using the dough cycle. Only thing I don't like is they harden so fast, but such is life. Usually they don't last that long anyway. We like to add nuts to ours.

These were good, I went a little lighter on the cinnamon and thought it was good (more like 1 1/2 tablespoons.)  I followed the directions except I let them sit in the fridge overnight, then in the morning sat them out 20 minutes then into the oven at 350 for a little longer.  They came out looking beautiful and very tasty.  I've been looking for the perfect cinnamon roll recipe.  I thought these were similar to the cinnabons - but like the cinnabons very sweet, cinnamony, and heavy heavy heavy.  If I try this recipe again I will let the dough rise longer in an effort to get a lighter roll, and also use less filling.  They were really good though.  :)  Between me, my husband, and my two young boys the whole pan lasted under 2 days!

5 stars AS IS - but if your in a hurry you can make with biscuits -quick and easy- I rolled the biscuits into a snake then flatten to 3/4" to 1" wide X around 12" long-covered with butter and cinnamon mix -bake to desired doneness -I like mine a little crispy- then I warm up the frosting and drizzle it over the top - Excellent- took me about 45 minutes total

Awesome recipe!  VERY easy to make - I emailed the recipe to my sister because she has a bread machine, and she whipped them up!  :)  What a great sister!  The second time she just made the dough for me and I did the rest, and I cut back just a little on the cinnamon and just spread I Can't Believe It's Not Butter right on the dough without measuring, and they came out great, too!  (a little more gooey).  Great recipe, I think I might have to get a bread machine!

Wow!! These were very delicious, I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did let them rise much longer, I wouls say somewhere around 2 to 3 hours. I don't know if it was just my oven or what, but i cooked the rolls for 10 minutes and the top got burnt but the inside wasn't done, they still tasted great, but maybe you would want to turn your oven down and watch them carefully. The amount of cinnamon and sugar on the rolls was great I personally wouldn't take any out! I as well made a batch and a half of frosting, because my family loves frosting as do I! They were awesome!

I like the gooy drippings so I made extra on the stovetop by melting everything together plus some pecans and drizzled it over freshly baked cinnamon rolls. Frosting was SOOO GOOD! I must say it taste better than what you would buy at a store.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had! I did use about 4 oz. of cream cheese rather than 3 oz. It makes the frosting a little more tangy.

One family member said they are by far the best cinnamon buns he's ever tasted, and another said that they're better than Cinnabon.  Thank you Marsha!  And thank you ANDYTAMI for the helpful directions on how to make them without a bread machine.

These were delicious, but I thought the frosting was a little too sweet. (The kids thought it was great.)  Next time, I'll half the frosting and coat them more lightly or use less sugar.

These are very delicious, and so very cinnabon-like!  I used butter this time and they were very yummy, but I think I might try the margarine or a mix of butter and the butter-flavored shortening, since other reviews have claimed it will make them softer.

I took these to a church covered dish and had nothing left.. I made then without a breadmachine, and cheated with the icing, just micrwaved a contaner of reading to go creamcheese icing and drizzled it over..Oh and i followed 1 readers advice and I melted the margarine and added the cinn and brownsugar to it, and then just spread that on the dough. Worked like a charm....

Superb!  Do need to make sure to bake the full time, as the first time I made them they were a bit doughy for my taste (everyone else said they were fine, though!)  Edit: 1st time I made this I used my bread machine, which has since broken.  Made these last night without one and they turned out superb again :)  I ran out of white flour and used 1 cup of wheat, used less butter for the filling (another ingredient I didn't have enough of!) and they still are absolutely amazing!  Also, took another reviewers suggestion and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes- they cooked better that way then the first time.

I love this recipe. I make the dough in my bread machine and then do as previous reviewers have suggested--I prepare the dough and roll and let it rise overnight. Next morning, I pop it in the oven and house wakes up to a delicious aroma!
 I have substituted up to one cup of whole wheat flour, and have used almond milk instead of regular milk. But since this is not a low cal, healthy  recipe to begin with, I usually just indulge myself and make it as is. The recipe really does live up to it's name-took this to a recent brunch and everyone thought I picked them up at Cinnabon! Delicious! Thanks for sharing.

I think I might steal previous reviewer's comments about using frozen bread dough.  I slaved all afternoon on these things, and admittedly, by my own fault because I'm not an experienced baker, they didn't come out as perfect as I had imagined.  Still delicious, just too rich for me but that doesn't mean the recipe is off, just means I've learned I'm not a big cinnamon bun fan.  I'm not convinced they're worth all the effort.  One big one is 1/3 my caloric intake for the day, and ...um..no nutritional value really.  Ah, but one day of sinful eating?  it was a nice treat.

EXCELLENT. Never actually had a cinnabon so I don't know if it tastes the same but it was certainly the BEST cinnamon roll recipe (AND FROSTING RECIPE BY FAR!) that I have ever found.  I did not make it in a bread maker, I followed another's advice on how to do it without.   Decreased cinnamon to 2 1/2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons because it seemed like a lot.  I would increase it next time though, it didn't seem quite cinnamon-y enough. Also, I had to take the rolls out earlier than the recipe called for and they browned quickly. And I would make a little more frosting next time, it was EXCELLENT!

Amazing recipe! I ended up adding about another 2 cups of brown sugar to the mixture. The given measurements did not come close to covering the 16x21 inch dough. I also wish I would have bought a second pack of cream cheese for more icing. 
The dough did not rise in the time stated in the directions. I had to leave mine overnight to get it to double in size. The whole process tool about 18 hours total for me.

I have no comparison since I have never made these before.  But they were yummy.  Very rich, and I like to think that I have a pretty strong sweet tooth, and can withstand the sweetness.  I do not have a bread machine, so followed another user's instructions on how do to do so without. I did have trouble getting the dough to rise.  However, were still plenty large enough.  Will definitely make again, but will cut back on the brown sugar, cinnamon mixture.

This makes great rolls.  Even tops my moms rolls, which I have been in love with since I was a kid.  The thing it really has over mom's rolls is that the are good left over.

I made this in a bread machine - for some reason mine didn't really rise at all. However, the (small) cinnamon rolls that it did produce were delicious. The filling is great and gets all crunchy and yummy on the bottom of the rolls.

I woke up at five am and couldn't go back to sleep so I decided to make cinnamon rolls. These turned out great, they are delicious and soft and moist :) they so hit the spot. First time ever making cinnamon rolls and I'm so happy I didn't fail horribly.

These are fantastic!  You couldn't ask for anything closer to a Cinnabon!  I don't have a bread machine, so I prepared them by hand the night before and put them in the refrigerator, but they were still great.  My only complaint is that the icing had too much cream cheese flavor. I tried out 7 other icing recipes and came up with 2 good ones.  My favorite (that I reduced): 1 pound Margarine, 1 pound cream cheese, 2 pounds powdered sugar, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.  For something with a little more cream cheese flavor: 8 oz cream cheese, 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, 1/2 C butter, 3 C powdered sugar, 1 T cream.  My only other questions for some of you is why on earth would want to wait to let the frosting SET??  I don't even see how you can wait that long, let alone understand why :)

Never had a Cinnabon so maybe this was dead on but to me the cream cheese frosting was a sugar overload. Way to sweet - plan to try this again and cut the frosting in half as the roll part was good.

my very 1st time making cinnamon rolls and it was not too bad. i left it too long in the oven and tops became a little on the crunchy side, but it was soft and moist on the inside-just right. i would definitely make this again. after rising,the dough just stuck to the sides of the bowl so next time i will definitely oil my bowl before putting my dough in it. i would also recommend doubling the filling. i just used a glaze, didn't have cream cheese and it was still great. thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I didn't use a bread  machine but its easy to put together with the Kitchenaid mixer and let it do all the kneading.  Very tasty.

This was ok but, I like ninety minute cinnamon rolls better (recipe on this site) I thought baking temp was too high.

This is a wondeful recipe!  I have made this recipe many times now for friends and they love it.  The trick is to have one or two for yourself and then give the rest away, I can't imagine the fat content!

I have made these twice now and they are well worth the time!  I used the bread maker on one batch and my mixer on another and they turned out great both times.  These are a big hit with my family!

Yum :)  I made mine with all purpose flour but I used about a quarter cup less of it than asked for because the dough seemed to solid.  They turned out perfect, although they needed a little longer to rise.  I baked them at 350 till just golden on top and then flipped the pan over for a little while to make sure to get all the good stuff.  They turned out perfect, although next time I'd use slightly less frosting, and maybe add raisins :)  Thanks for the recipe, they're awesome.

Amazing. I was craving conjured cinnamon rolls and these hit the spot.   These fabulous rolls are indeed a clone of a cinnabon, slightly smaller than a full size cinnabon, slightly bigger than a minibon - the perfect size.  I do not have a bread machine, so I used the suggestion of rising the ingredients in a warmed oven. I also cooked it at 350 for 33 minutes.  Slightly crisp on the outside - gooey on the inside. Melt all over divine frosting.  Just give in and do it.

I've tried some cinnamon roll recipes on this site, and this one is by far the best! I would make less icing though, that's just because I'm not the icing type of person. Delicous!

Very good recipe.  I would never compare a recipe to that of a chain store....I personally think they sometimes are not that great.  The kids ate every single one in less than 12 hours.  SO good.

Simply put - amazing.  I use the frosting as a drizzle - it's delicious frosting - we just like the roll so much that to use all the frosting takes away from the roll for us.  Must try!

Awesome. And easy - I put the dough in my bread maker on the dough cycle. The icing is delicious, just be careful how much you put on the roll; I overdid it and how sweet these were! We just scraped a lot of it off and the rolls were yum! Thanks.

I just made these and they are almost gone! They do live up to the standard, the recipe is awesome. I was a little nervous about the dough being a little to dry, but when I let it rest it turned out to be okay. I also used a 1/4 c (4oz)of cream cheese for the frosting. I mixed the brown sugar, cinnamon and butter in a bowl then spread it all over the dough. I also didn't use a bread machine, I followed the instructions mentioned, of putting the yeast in the warm milk and then adding the sugar milk butter eggs salt then the flour. I kneaded it for a bit and it turned out just fine.

These take some time and work, but they are well worth it. I've found that the longer I let the dough sit and rise (at least an hour), the easier it is to manage. I've made this recipe many times, and I will make it again and again!

Phenomenal!  These were wonderful!  I did not use a bread machine; they turned out great.  I baked at 350 for 25 minutes in a metal 13x9 inch pan.  I may add to the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture a bit to make them more like Cinnabons (Cinnabons seem to have a LOT of gooey filling)-- but they really are perfect without any modifications to the recipe.  This one's a keeper for sure!  Thanks a million Marsha!

Good recipe, that is why I am giving it a 5 star. However, mine did not turn out. I don't have a bread machine and tried others directions on how to do it without. My dough took forever to rise, in the bowl and in the 9x13. I let them rise over night in the fridge, but that made the filling sink down to the bottom. The texture of mine was not light and fluffy. I will need to try this one again.

Took me forever to get my dough to rise (i'm not very good with yeast yet) and they didn't come out as soft as I'd have liked them too, but these things are the fault of the baker. To the filling I added dried chopped apricots...excellent addition.

Incredibly delicious. I made these the night before and baked them in the morning. Very good! The only alterations I made was to use butter instead of margarine in the dough and I added some extra cinnamon to the mixture. I had to end up cooking them for maybe twice as long, but I think that's because they weren't at room temperature when I put them in the oven... Either way, they were the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had at home. And I was really proud of myself (and my boyfriend!) for making them.

I have made numerous batches of these now, and they are certainly a hit.  My father is Cinnabon-crazed & thinks these may be even better!  I followed the other users suggestions and blended the butter/brown sugar/cinnamon filling & spread on the dough.  On the last batch I made, I slightly melted the butter so I didn't have use the electric mixer to blend.  This made the spreading SO EASY.  It was the easiest time I've had yet.  These are definitely worth the time & effort!!

Really excellent recipe. I followed it to a T (with the exception of the bread machine) and they came out perfect. Just make sure to roll the dough out thin before adding the cinnamon mixture because it helps disburse the sugar evenly through the bun.

Having never worked with yeast before, I was a little hesitant about trying this recipe, I am grateful for the reviews-all the tips and hints were wonderfull!  My husband was extremely happy with the finished product.  It was fairly easy and it tastes just like the real thing!  Thank you to all the review writers-reading the reviews helped me realize I could do it!

Didn't care for the cream cheese frosting, but I'm the first to admit that I'm more of a glazed girl. Thought the dough was right on, though and I used a regular kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook because I don't have a bread maker. On my first batch, the cinnamon sugar mixture oozed out and cooked into a crunchy layer at the bottom of the rolls. The second batch, this didn't happen. Not exactly sure what I did differently. Either way, I was happy with the product.

These were OK but from all the reviews I had tought that these would be better.  It is probably just me but I thought that they tasted a bit doughy and all the kids here thought that they were too sweet (I served them for breakfast for my daughter's 6th birthday sleepover party).  I am going to try them again though just to make sure!

This was one of the best recipes I have tried in recent memory. I ended up rolling the long way to keep the portion size a little smaller - they are huge as this is written. I also didn't end up using all the cinnamon/brown sugar mix, didn't think it needed it. But I made these for Easter Brunch and they were spectacular!!!!

Perfect recipe as is - I've made them 4 times in 3 weeks and I can't keep them.  Today I sent them with my son to school for his last day of kindergarten - he said that some of the kids liked them.  I said, "Some?"  He said not everyone got one.  I asked why and he told me that the teachers liked them best of all the party food and only let the children who behaved best have one and then they split the rest.  Yes, I believe that says it all.

It came out ok. I made it for dessert when I had dinner guests over. I found the icing to be sweeter than Cinnabons (if that were possible)so I couldn't eat that much. Also, I don't know what I did, but my dough wasn't as soft as the real thing. Still pretty good.

I made these for mother's day brunch and they are SSSSSOOOOOOOOO GOOD!! I only made one change to the bun itself: I mixed the sugar, cinnamon, and butter together and spread it on, instead of spreading the butter and sprinkling the others. It was SO much easier and more uniform. With the frosting, I doubled it and used a whole 8oz brick of cream cheese. I didn't have a problem with the filling coming out of the buns(Maybe because I made these the night before and had them in the fridge?) So good.

Fantastic. I followed the recipe the first time and the only thing I'll change the second time (and there will be more!) is to add more butter on top of the dough before the cinnamon mixture. The filling was a little dryer than we prefer...but these buns still disappeared in 15 minutes with three hungry kids around.

I currently live in Morocco and we do not have the privilege of driving to a Cinnabon when we feel the urge for a delicious treat! So I decided to give these a try. All I can say is... who needs Cinnabon when you've got this recipe?! Everyone that has tried these cannot believe how good they are!

These were delicious. I forgot to set the timer so i took them out of the oven when the looked done and iced them just to realize the middles weren't cooked when i took them out of the pan. I cooked them 15 minutes longer with the icing and they still came out great. The only thing that bothered me was that after a night in the fridge, these were not very good reheated, they got kind of hard.

I am from Norway, and I was an exchange student in America for a year. I absolutely fell in love with the cinnamonrolls from Cinnabon. And then I came over this recipe, and I made them. They taste exactly the same! They are sooo good! All my Norwegian friends LOVED them! I will definately make them again. Thank you so much for making my day :-) Greetings from Norway!

I'm going to have to agree with everyone else...this recipe rocks! I think I may have tried to fit too many in the pan, so they turned out kind of ugly (but that's how people know it's homemade I guess!) However, that didn't stop anyone at the office from devouring them! If you like cinnabon, then this recipe will not disappoint.

Something did not go right here. It all went downhill after I attempted to roll the dough out. I floured generously and it stuck to everything. It was impossible to shape them. I did my best and they ended up baking up like scones instead. I'll still eat them. I'm very had I halved the recipe instead of wasting double the ingredients. It's obvious most people did not have trouble. Maybe it was my flour or yeast. I really wanted these to turn out like a Cinnabon.

I wouldn't call this an exact clone of a cinnabon.. but it's a pretty good attempt. Very tasty! I don't find that they stay good for that long though. Try not to make more than you can eat in a day or two.

Mine were okay (maybe I did something wrong)... but definitely nowhere close to a cinnabon...  They tasted rather doughy.

This was my first experience with yeast and cinn. rolls. I think the recipe is very easy to follow and they turned out great. Only problem I had was not recipe related. I think they should of rasied a little bit more, but our house was very cold this morning so I am believing that was the reasoning!

Was a good recipe. I cooked it per the time on the recipe and it came out a little toO tough. Then all the brown sugar carmelized and made the bottoms very hard. But not too hard to eat! Was very good!

These were incredible the first time I made them, and even better the second time around! The kids like them so much that, when Time allows, I bake a BUNCH for the weeks to come, and freeze them! Just a microwave away with some cream-cheese frosting, they aren't too shabby! Thanks!

Too Much icing - I followed others advice and doubled it.  Next time I will do a glaze icing. Other then that - my family wants me to make them all the time.

Amazing. I flipped the cinnamon buns over when they only had 10 minutes left, which made the filling spread all throughout the cinnamon bun. I also doubled the filling.

My husband adores these cinnamon rolls!  He told me to give them six stars (and he knows that five is the maximum).  I doubled the icing and flipped the rolls over after baking them as suggested by other reviewers.  The only change I'll make next time is to reduce the cinnamon by at least half.

These are now a Christmas morning tradition!  Easy and taste amazing!  I make mine the night before, let them rise in a warm (200 degree) oven for 30 minutes or so and then bake while we open our stockings.  Awesome recipe! (Athough I must say that the real Cinnabons are better, but these are homemade, fresh and wonderful.  We make them year after year!)

We loved these cinnamon rolls, but there was just too much cinnamon for us.  It was almost overpowering--in a bad way.  Next time I'll cut back on it a bit and then they'll be perfect!

Not much to be said that hasn't already been said.  Just so good and so fun to make.  Next time I think I will add pecans or maybe raisins. They were fantastic as I made them but I think even better with a little something more.  This was an easy recipe but it did take a lot of time and left quite a big mess!  Of course it was worth it!

"Best cinnamon roll I've ever eaten" was the comment my boyfriend made to me (and he's an honest food critic).  I made a few tweaks to the recipe as I did not have a bread maker (based on another reviewer's comments), and it turned out PERFECT!  My only complaint is it takes too long to make in the morning due to waiting for the dough to rise... Maybe next time I can prepare the dough the night before?

The buns turned out very good. I made a few changes Instead of magarine I used shortening a little over 1/8 c, I use 1/4 c sugar for the bun and 3/4 c brown sugar for the filing. The kids really like it. I also butter the top of each bun aftering them place in the pan and sprinkle the cinnamon and brown sugar mix on top before raising.

The bun recipe was good, but the icing was too tangy to be cinnabon quality- I also had to add about 1/2 T of water to thin it out.  With another icing recipe I have (from my grandmas cinnamon rolls) this would be 5-star1

I too have made these many times and used different icings, like add a little orange juice to the icing for an orange flavor.  I don't cut them as large, 1/2 the size and get twice the amount, less calories per roll also.  I usually make this and take one pan to work and one pan for the kids in the morning.  Greatest recipe!

This is good recipe, but I found I needed to put it into a jellyroll pan, was just too big for 9x13. Turned brown on ouside, but doughy on inside when in 9x13 pan. Turned out great in bigger pan, and they were still big rolls.

I've been making these for a while, but forgot to review them.  Dug out the recipe so I can have them ready for Easter weekend.  I love the idea to make these the night before and let them rise in the fridge.  That's the best advice I've gotten from the reviews.  Gonna try flipping them out onto a cookie sheet this time before icing them, as that sounds like a good idea as well!  While a bread machine is not necessary, it does make this recipe super easy, and I've never had it fail.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!  This recipe was great!  I did have to raise dough a little longer but might be my yeast was older.  As mentioned before I cooked a few minutes longer.  I did not use a bread machine. I made them using my Kitchen Aid Mixer.  Will make again!!!  Thanks

This recipe was awesome!!! Tasted Amazing!! I will definitely make them again! I had one problem though that I'm hoping someone can help me with... The brown sugar/ cinn. mixture got a bit hard on the bottom. Did I just over cook it? I cooked them in a glass 9x13 dish. Please help!

My family loved these!  I loved the frosting and kept licking it off the spoon when I frosted the rolls. I put my in the fridge over night and it worked just fine.  I did double the frosting though, only cause it's so yummy!   I think next time though I will increase the butter for the filling.  It was a little dry, but still delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I have never made cinnamon rolls from scratch before and was very nervous, as I'm still a beginner at the more difficult baking recipes.  These rolls turned out so great.  I happened to have company over when they finished, and they absolutely raved about them.  I will definitely make them again!

This recipe is fabulous!!!!! It takes a while to make them, especially when you're used to making the kind you just pop in the oven. These are worth it. I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the recommendations from another reviewer to make the dough. It turned out great. Some reviewers suggest using less sugar and cinnamon for the filling, but you should use all of it. It seems like a lot, but when they're done they have the perfect amount of filling. Good luck!!

This is a great recipe!  I get rave reviews everytime I make them!  And after working at Cinnabon I k ow that it is very close to the original. The frosting is excellent!    My only question is: has anybody ever altered the dough recipe so that it is easier to roll out? Mine comes out pretty tough and difficult to stretch out to size.

I've never been super comfortable baking bread but these looked so good I had to try them. I couldn't be happier about the outcome, this recipe is absolutely delicious. I don't have a bread machine so I followed other reviewers instructions on how to get the dough made, and it worked perfectly. I disolved yeast in warm milk (110-115 degrees) for 10 min then added it to a stand mixer with the sugar, and mixed that as I added the butter, eggs, sugar, and salt. Then I added flour 1 cup at a time untill the dough was pulling away from the sides of the bowl. I Turned it out onto a floured surface and kneaded dough untill elastic. Put dough in a lightly greased bowl covered with a damp cloth and put in heated but turned off oven. Let rise for 1 hour or untill doubled in size. Then I followed the remaining instructions on the original recipe. I also added a Tbsp. or two of milk to the frosting to get it the right consistencey. Thanks for such an amazing recipe. I will definately be making these again.

These really DO taste like Cinnabons!  I had a hard time rolling the dough out, so next time I'll try a little less flour in the recipe.  Hopefully it will be a little easier to manage then.  Mine could have used a longer baking time - they were golden brown after 15 minutes, but the middle rolls were still not done.    Thanks - this is going to be a family favorite!

WOW!  The cream cheese frosting on these rolls were the best food item I think I have ever put in my mouth.  I cannot tell you how much we enjoyed these cinnamon rolls.  I didn't check the calorie count because I don't want to know!

I've made these many times, and have found letting the yeast proof in the milk for at least 10 minutes, and kneading for the same, is necessary for soft, airy bread.  Also, 400 is way too high - the rolls burn at that.  350 works.

These were pretty good, but not quite as good as the ones my Grandma makes. As for being a Cinnabon clone, I would say very close, but not just quite. I think that they Cinnabon rolls have a sweeter bread base. I will try to make these again soon and add some more sugar to the dough recipe, perhaps.

I made the recipe as written dozens of time.  I have been told it is the best dish I make.  Thank you.  Yesterday I did something different.  Instead of the butter and brown sugar cinnamon as the filling, I smeared the dough with 7 ounces of softened cream cheese and then spread about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of apricot preserves and did everything else the same.  It was fantastic.  I am going to try other fillings.  Thank you again for an excellent recipe.

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls and this recipe was fairly easy to follow. I definitely have things I personally need to correct, but these tasted great. My husband has been oh and ah-ing over these all weekend.

VERY, VERY delicious! Super cinnamony and sugary! For the first couple of times when I made it, the filling kept falling out. Then, I found that it is the butter that moistens the sugar into a paste and prevents it from scattering all over your working surface. So there are two solutions to it: either you decrease the amount of sugar to slightly less than 3/4 cup, or you can increase the amount of butter to 1/2 cup. Also, 1 1/2 tbsp cinnamon should suffice for a moderate taste - but if you like a lot of spice (like I do), then go on and add the other tablespoon!

OMW!!! These are amazing...the BEST cinnamon rolls that I ever had. My hubby wants me to make more! I read a few reviews on doubling the frosting, and I think that it is way too much and makes them too rich! Next time I make them I will only make one batch of frosting. I used my kitchen aid to make these since I don't have a bread maker. It worked great! Thanks again for the AWESOME recipe. I LUV IT!!!

These were incredible.  The frosting was very good.  It looked thick at first,but melted down nicely on the hot bun.

Oh MY! These are WONDERFUL! I made a double batch after reading the reviews knowing how my large family is about sweets and it's a good thing I did!! I stored my frosting separately tho so that the ones who want frosting can do it individually. ~TY for sharing your recipe!

These were very good, but had "too much sweet stuff," as my husband said.  Next time I may cut down the sugar mixture for the middle of the cinnabons by half.

Oh my God! (If there is a God existing.) I can't belive how delicious this was. My whole family adored these! Even my brother who always sais he doesn't like cinammon. All right, I thought about adding raisins, but I'm glad I didn't. They are perfect as they are! The only thing is the sweetness..I did not even try to make the frosting because I knew it would be over-sweet and I will reduce the brown sugar to 3/4 cup next time. Well, I've accepted that Americans love oversweet stuff. I'm just half American ;) Amazing recipe! My fam will probably make me make these ever 2 weeks^^

These are AWESOME! I struggled some with rolling up the dough, but I followed some of the tips that I found in the reviews which helped.  I made these for Valentine's Day breakfast and they were simply great!  I need to work on my technique with rolling up the dough, but they turned out good regardless.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I don't have bread machine, but I did have a package of bread/roll mix. I followed the directions on the package, then finished the rest as outlined in your recipe.  Absolutely fantastic!  I tweaked the frosting and only added enough icing sugar to taste, I added a tsp. of lemon juice.  This is a keeper, thanks.

Other than doubling the filling mixture, i folled this recipe to a T and ended up with 20 nice sized cinnamon rolls! This recipe is DELICIOUS! Call me unamerican but I've never had a cinnabon and with this recipe I won't need to. My family and I enjoed them and froze the leftovers which microwave well. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, but will try more traditional rolls. The kids did not care for these as much. Also I use half recipe as I made them smaller.

Wow!!!  These are awesome.  I used dark brown sugar.  Made them at 2 in the am, forgot to put them in the fridge, so the last rise was 5 hrs.  They were coming out of the pan they rose so much.  Cooked 18 min. in a glass pan.  Definitely a keeper!!! 2000+ people can't be wrong right? I also don't have a bread maker, used my Cuisinart mixer.

This is the best cinnamon roll recipe I have tried.  I was looking for something with a softer, more flavorful roll.  I modified to reduce the amount of butter:  I used the full amount in the dough.  When the dough was rolled out into the rectangle, I brushed the dough with melted butter instead of spreading with 1/3 cup.  I completely omitted the butter from the frosting--the cream cheese is enough.  Maybe the original tastes better, but our family absolutely loved these rolls without knowing what we were missing.

produces a 1lb loaf...I wish I could make more at once.

Fabulous!  I took some ideas of previous reviewers.  Mixed the butter/brown sugar/cinnamon and then warmed a bit in the microwave to make easier to spread over the dough.  I made them much smaller than 12.  I think I ended up with 28 rolls but then I rolled the dough out much bigger than 16x21.  I lined 3 round cake pans with parchment.  And then after placing in the pans, put in the fridge (covered) to bake in the morning in a cold oven and set temp to 350 baked for 30 min (probably should have taken them out at 25 but it was my first time making them).  Took them to the office and wham they were gone.  :)  2/22/09 update: I think I will modify the recipe to a King Cake for Mardi Gras.  Instead of cutting them into rolls, I will just bring the ends around. Might need to make 2 rings since they rose so much.  Then add colored sugar on top of the frosting.

High Altitude??? I've never had a Cinnabon, but these were good.  I live at  7000 ft, so I'm not sure if it was the altitude, but these didn't cook right.  The rolls on the outside were done, but the middle ones were not cooked all the way.  I had to put them back in and bake them a while longer.  I think next time, I will only cook 6 at a time and make sure they are not touching in the pan. They tasted great and my husband abd boys ate them all and asked why I didn't make a second batch...guess I'll be making them again tomorrow.

Awesome recipe and so easy but does take a bit of time.  I followed other reviewers advice, especially DBDCook and made these the night before (without a bread maker, used the bread hook on my mixer and it worked great).  Made lots of frosting and popped them in the cold oven in the morning - they were to die for.  Great recipe and great modifications by reviewers - thanks everyone!

Yummy, and easy to make.  I am going to try freezing half of the rolls pre-the 30 minute rise.  My hope is that I will then be able to pop them out of the freezer let them thaw and then rise for 30 minutes and bake them.

This was excellent.  I combined it with the Speedy Cinnamon Buns from this sight--because it used frozen bread dough and I needed the right temp. and times etc.  If you do combine the two recipes, you can pretty much divide the filling and topping recipe in 1/2 because the frozen bread dough is smaller in quantity.  Totally yummy

I love this recipe. Coming right out of the bread machine, the dough isn't tacky or anything. the only thing that was a little bit more difficult was that the dough was really elastic and I had a harder time rolling it out, but it still turns out great. I would recommend doubling the frosting though. Thank you for changing my family's breakfast! Oh, and it's been great for my pregnancy cravings!

Wouldn't change a thing! I like these even better than the Cinnabon, they aren't as heavy.

These are great tasting rolls! The first time I took these out of the oven after the suggested time they were pretty doughy in the middle..so I did the flipping them over as a reviewer suggested, and ended up baking for additional 30 mins, (and my oven bakes fast.) They turned out really good! Thanks!

These rolls are EXCELLENT.  It does taste just like the kind you buy.  I have made it twice and they turned out perfect both times. With the bread machine it is also very easy.

The reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars is b/c I mistakingly followed the advice of a reviewer that said it was ok to refrigerate over night.  My dough smelled great, it rose as intended and my icing was perfect.  Woke up next morning to take out of the fridge and allow to warm up and rise again before baking and it never did.  I just wanted them to be hot for breakfast w/o having to wake up b4 the roosters to prepare.  Next time I will just bake and reheat.

This recipe gets all the stars in the sky it is so GOOD! I made the dough in my bread machine. Too easy! I also mixed th butter and sugar together and added a little more cinnimon and rubbed it over the dough. The icing was good, but I think I will play with it to get a lighter icing next time just because I prefer it that way. If you don't have the money to buy someone a gift for a birthday, buy them a nice baking pan and fill it with this recipe and provide a lable for baking and what a nice gift to make. I did this for a close friend so she could bake on Christmas morning for her family and think of us. It was very nice.

Yummy!  I will definitely do what other reviewers suggested next time.  I will roll over the filling a few times before rolling into buns, flip the pan after removing from the oven so the filling can settle back into the rolls, and put on half the frosting while they are still hot, then the rest then they are cooled.  What a great recipe!

I have mixed feelings about these.  They are very good and look very pretty but something was missing.  Maybe I'll try the high end cinnamon I read in some reviews.  I did bake them for 23 minutes at 350 and I think they still could have used a few more minutes.  Next time maybe I'll try covering them with foil (so they don't burn on the outside) after the 23 minutes and baking them another 5 minutes or so to ensure they're fulling baked in the center.  Overall pretty good!

I too did not use a bread machine.  I did use my kitchen aid mixer and followed others instructions on how to avoid the bread machine.  This is an easy and delicious recipe!!  Can't wait to try it again.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

I wanted this to be perfect - it sounded so perfect!  I think this was probably chef-error more than recipe.  The cinnamon ended up getting really crunchy and I probably overcooked them a tiny bit.  Maybe I'll try again, but it was kind of a lot of work!

These were amazing!  I made them for Christmas morning.  I put the entire bread pan in the oven to rise overnight after it was finished.  I, then rolled it out and baked it Christmas morning.

Great recipe.  I made these for Christmas brunch and they were gone in a flash.  I had to make the dough a day and a half earlier.  Next time that I have to make it in advance I'll go ahead and roll it out the dough and cut up the rolls.  It was hard to roll the dough out after being cold but it still worked.

I tried these last New Years Day.  The flavors of both the bun and icing were terrific, and the buns rose well, but I had trouble getting them baked through.  The edges were done nicely, and would have been overcooked had I kept them in any longer.  But the whole center part was still pretty raw dough.  Any suggestions here?!  I would like to try them again sometime...

Fantastic!
Made this for Christmas morning and it did not disappoint.  Followed the recipe exactly and they were delish.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

I really don't have anything to add to this except that they were AWESOME! My kids devoured them, they were very light and fluffy. I did add some vanilla to the dough and I think the key for me was to make sure they rose enough before I rolled them out and then again once they were formed. I also added some ground walnuts to the filling. Thank you!

Julie, Follow the recipe. 3 ounces is fine unless you want to double the frosting. I'm making them tonight too. Nothing better than opening presents and eating these cinnamon rolls! Merry Christmas! These are the best!

I'm not sure what happened but these just did not turn out for me. I made it without using a bread machine and the dough just wouldn't rise. They still tasted delicious but they were a bit flat.

I thought they tasted better after a couple days (if they last you that long). I'm not sure what I did wrong but they came out slightly doughy even though the tops were nice and brown. Not quite as good as Cinnabon but still a very good recipe.

Delicious!  What a treat!  I did cut down on the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture...3/4 cup and 1 1/2 Tbsp...too much cinnamon for us.  Oh and instead of mixing the butter with the b.sugar/cinn, I just soften the butter and spread on the dough then sprinkle with the br. sugar mixture.  I often make these in the bread machine, form into rolls in pan and stick in the freezer for up to a couple weeks.  Take them out of the freezer the night before you want to bake them, set on the counter and they will be ready to go in the morning!

These are absolutely wonderful!  I use the delay feature on my bread machine and the dough is ready in the morning.  I do like to double the filling mixture for some extra gooey-ness!

This recipe is a little too sweet for me. I was craving for cinnamon rolls last weekend and found one recipe that didn't need pudding mix from other site. It called for only 3 cups of bread flour. It was so so so moist and yummy. It was gone in that morning. This time, I thought I tried a different recipe, so I found this clone of a cinnabon. I made it the night before just as I did with the other recipe. It came out a little too doughy and thick. I don't remember how a real cinnabon tastes like, but I personally like it soft and fluffy. This recipe is also too sweet. If I were to give it another try, I would reduce bread flour to 3 3/4 cups and maybe 1/4 cup of sugar for the dough. I used the other icing recipe from cinnamon rolls III on this site. The icing recipe was the best for cinnamon rolls.

Excellent recipe.  I divided the dough in half and rolled each piece to 8"x21" so I could make 24 mini cinnamon rolls.  I froze part of the batch after baking and frosting.  The frozen rolls are just about as good as fresh after 30 seconds in the microwave.

My husband loved these cinnabons. He said they were the best that he every had. I added extra butter, sugar and cinnamon. I rolled out the dough but still kept it thick. Added extra butter, sugar and cinnamon on top before baking. The icing was delicious

Oh my gosh!! These are so close to the real thing.  I have never made cinnamon rolls before this, but I will again thats for sure!!!  I used a couple of others suggestions and they all made a wonderful roll.  For the filling I mixed the butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon together before spreading.  Very easy that way.  I also put waxpaper on the pan I baked it in, and i was able to just pull the rolls out and put it on the table. It made for very easy cutting and serving. For the frosting I added a little bit of lemon juice for an extra zip and it was wonderful, and of course I doubled the frosting too so we could dip the rolls in it just like we would if we were buying it at the store;)  The family gobbled it all up and raved about it too.  YUM!

I also did it without the bread machine. At the beginning, the dough was very sticky, so I was affraid I was doing something wrong. But it turned out just wonderful... Next time, I'd use a little less cinnamon though.

OMG, this recipe is to die for, I'm now back using my bread maker, I almost put it in a garage sale, come on girls and boys, get your bread maker out of storage and try this one, its well worth it.  My granddaughter is always dragging me to cinnabon at the mall, believe me this is much cheaper, it rolled out just beautifully and I raised it in a oven set on 200 then turned it off, works great, I put a flour sack kitchen towel over it while raising.  My granddaughter is forever greatful for trying this, now she won't leave me alone, she always begging me to make these. Try these you'll love them too.

FABULOUS!!! I used to live in a town that didn’t have a Cinnabon store.  Whenever I would come home I made a B-line for the mall.  I consider myself a Cinnabon connoisseur- having said that this recipe is nearly dead on!  I have never attempted cinnamon rolls before but they were a success. The only issue I had was following other suggestion of turning them over when they are done.  Great idea but I suggest turning them carefully onto a plate so you won’t mangle them as I did.  I made them yesterday, refrigerated them over night and baked them this morning without letting them sit out to rise.  They are AWESOME!

I've tried several cinnamon roll recipes and this one is summed up easily OMG! I took it to work for a potluck (thought we needed a breakfast dish) and I took home an empty pan. Everyone raved about how good they were and couldn't believe how easy they were to make when I told them. I did everything the night before up to the point of letting them rise 30 min. Instead I put them in the fridge and the next morning I let them rise in a warm oven, baked and then frosted. Out of this world - Thanks!

I can barely keep up with the requests for these yummy treats.  My husband can't start his day without his coffee and a cinnabon.  DELICIOUS!

No cinnabon, but an excellent recipe.  I have experimented with different fillings.  I like to spread jam or fruit preserves instead of the butter before sprinkling the brown sugar/cinnamon.

These were really good. Next time though, I'll only roll the dough into a rectangle about half the size the recipe says to. It was way too hard to roll it out that big, and I think doing so really over-worked the dough. This also contributed to the dough being an uneven thickness, which made it really hard to  cook the rolls, as parts some were really thin and some were really thick. Also, I doubled the frosting recipe because I love frosting, but won't do that next time - it was way too much!

I have used another Cinnabon clone recipe for years that called for instant vanilla pudding in the recipe.  I didn't have any instant pudding on hand this morning, so I decided to try this recipe based on the rave reviews. Let me tell you, it's ALL THAT and then some! These were light and fluffy, not soggy, or overcooked and hard.  The dough was perfect and easy to work with.

These are the best!  We don't roll them out quite as much.  That makes few rolls but bigger and thicker.  The rolls also can taste somewhat like flour so we reduce to four cups.  When we roll them we also roll from left to right instead of top to bottom.

It is the best cinnamon roll ever!!!! We got 12 huge cinnamon roll and my kids are crazy about it. Instead of making the topping, we used the cake topping-vanilla since my kids don't like cream cheese at all. :) Thank for the recipe!!!!

I also decreased the oven temp and lengthened the baking time as suggested by other reviews.  Put the unbaked rolls in the fridge covered with plastic wrap to hide out until morning then baked for a hot, homemade school day breakfast...a big treat around here.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.  Easy to make, dough turned out perfect (and this was my first time using a bread machine).  It's too good and too easy....my family will be hounding me to make them every every morning now.  ;)  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe.

Like everyone else we loved these. I used a premade cream cheese frosting, and next time I will definitely try the frosting that goes with this recipe. I did have some trouble cutting them even using dental floss. I would love to know if anyone has any secrets that they use.

Very good.  This will be a keeper.  I forgot to allow for a 2nd rise after forming and they were still great!  Needed a bit longer baking time....but that was due to my slow oven.

I didn't use the dough in this recipe, I used 'Amish white bread' instead. But I used the filling (although I did substitute milk for the butter for a LITTLE healthier alternative) and the frosting. It turned out AMAZING. Before I even told my husband the name of this recipe he said, "It tastes like a Cinnabon."

These are the best cinnamon rolls!  They take a little bit of time to make, but nothing compared to other cinnamon roll recipes.  I'm thinking about giving them away as Christmas gifts this year!

well lots of work but super yummy!  next time i'll try and use regular yeast instead of quick rise because as a beginner bread maker it was hard to tell when the yeast was ready.  will also use bread flour next time to make it lighter.  no bread machine required though, i followed others' advice and it worked!

Made these for the first time this weekend...amazing!  My husband was in heaven and said he thought they were better than Cinnabon.  Used my bread machine to prep the dough, and after reading reviews decided to mix the melted butter, cinnamon, and sugar together for the filling rather than brushing on the butter and sprinkling with cinnamon/sugar - worked perfectly!  It stayed in the rolls and did not run out during baking.  I did not let the rolls double in size after assembly (I was running out of time!) so I simpy put them in the cold oven and allowed them to rise while the oven was preheating.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again and am going to try the suggestion of freezing the rolls and icing for single servings.

These are awesome!...and fairly easy too, as far as cinnamon rolls go.  My husband is a big fan, and agrees that these are even better than Cinnabon. (They also freeze well too.)

This recipe makes the most tender, delicious cinnamon rolls.  I would have to say that they are better than Cinnabon.  I always prefer homemade to store bought any day of the week.  These are incredible, especially on a cold fall morning!  YUMMY!

I tried this recipe last night and wasn't to excited about it. They were good but not awesome. The cinnamon sugar mixture wasn't gooey like a real cinnabon, and it seemed to dry up a bit. And in my opinion there wasn't enough. I followed other reviews and mixed the cinnamon and brown sugar with the butter, maybe I shouldn't have done that..... I think I will try this recipe again, but make quite a few changes. For one, I won't roll the dough out that much and I will cut the edges off to make it a perfect rectangle. I might add walnuts or pecans to the filling, and I'll do the filling how the recipe says to. And I might line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. Hopefully these changes might work out better for me. I guess I'll have to see when I try them again.

Some things seemed a little odd with the directions in this recipe...first of all, it seemed that spreading the dough to 16X21 inches was too thin and too big... Second, I thought that the glaze recipe required too much powdered sugar -- I used just about half of the recommended amount, and it was still really sweet! In any case they look yummy, and I can't wait to dig in...

These are very good cinnamon rolls.  However, my family still prefers The Pioneer Woman's cinnamon rolls.  Nothing wrong with these, just a family preference.

It was good, but nothing to go gaga over. I don't have a breadmaker so I followed the suggestions given to make it without. This was also my first experience using yeast. Everything went well and they baked up beautifully. I also inverted the pan shortly after coming out of the oven. I didn't use the icing recipe given. I just made a confectioner sugar glaze and drizzled it over the top. I'm glad I did. The rolls were sweet enough on their own without the icing suggested. 
I will keep this recipe and probably make it occasionally, but I will also keep looking for that WOW recipe.

Well, I wouldn't say these were out of this world, but they are good.  I have made these numerous times and always have a problem with them drying out if we don't eat them IMMEDIATELY out of the oven; maybe that's the nature of them?  Anyway, my 11-year old son requests these all the time and when I make them, he will eat them until he is blue in the face!  They freeze fantastically!  After you cut them into individual rolls, place on a cookie sheet in a single layer, freeze them then place into freezer bags for later enjoyment!  I think the amount of cinnamon is right on; I can't imagine any less like some have suggested; I guess it's just a matter of personal preference!  Thank you for this recipe.

We loved this recipe!!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and I added cinnamin to my dough.  My whole family said they loved it.  Perfect for a treat.

Better than those at the mall!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, no modifications necessary!  I just became Mom of the Year for this school day breakfast!  I only hope it helps them pull in the good grades at school!

I used a GLASS 13x9 dish instead of a metal pan and they came out perfect.  They are so delicious and everyone wants me to make them for them.  Awesome recipe!

"Those were the bomb!" - My sister said. Although nobody says 'bomb' anymore, these were magnificant! Better than any other recipe you will find on this website (don't waste your time and ingredients, the 1,000+ reviews proves it!) and better than the canned rolls you buy at the grocery store. I didn't have the proper ingredients for the icing, so I pretty much just threw things together; that was the worst part about the cinnamon roll, but that was my fault! :] 

a MUST TRY. I even printed this out and made copies for my family! thanks!

Oh My Gosh!!!  These are fabulous.  If I can make them, anybody can.  I've never made a yeast dough before, and I don't have a bread machine.  I followed the directions from other reviewers that did not use a bread machine and they were AMAZING.  Can't wait to make them again.

I made these in a pinch because my son wanted to take some  cinnamon rolls to work, and waited till the last minute to tell me.  In his defense he had told me several days ago, but no reminder!  So I looked this recipe up and made these.  They are amazing, I didn't change a single thing at all about his recipe it was perfect as it was and a hit.  Will make again and again!

Excellent recipe!  Very close to the original.  A note- they do go stale-tasting very quickly.  Probably not a problem as they likely won't last long anyway!

These were good, but I think it was the icing that saved them for us.  Next time I make them, I will try to either add a lot of cinnamon or vanilla or something to the dough, as I don't think it tasted very good by itself.  Also, I think maybe I will try to either double the filling or try a different one... It didn't seem like there was enough cinnamon taste for us.

AMAZING! Having moved a few years ago from the mall maddness of So. California and Cinnabon stores everywhere, to rural PA, this recipe is a treat. My children had gone through Cinnabon withdrawal after we moved. Although not an exact clone, I almost think it is better, because it is not as overpoweringly sweet. I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't feel the need for any modifications. Thanks for sharing this! It was a huge hit with the family.

This recipe is great!  It's even easier if you start with frozen bread dough.  Thaw the dough as recommended on the package and prepare the cinnamon rolls the night before.  Cover and place in refrigerator.  The next morning, remove from the refigerator and warm for 30 min. - 1 hr on the counter.  Bake as directed.

Following others' advice, I dissolved a packet of yeast in warm milk and kneaded the dough by hand instead of using a bread machine.  I also doubled the frosting recipe and sprinkled chopped pecans along with the cinnamon/sugar mixture before rolling the dough.  A few extra pecans on top won't hurt either!  Overall, the cinnamon rolls turned out delicious!  According to my family, they were even better than the store-bought ones!

Like this needs another fabulous review!!! I am giving 4 stars because while it is a fantastic cinnamon roll, it's not quite a clone of a cinnabon. The dough is a bit cakier - but it's great!

We halved the recipe and they turned out delicious.  Flavor was great.  We wished they were a little fluffier, which may have to due with our oven.  We also are going to try to figure out how to make them wider instead of so tall.

I must have done something wrong because my cinnamon rolls came a bit too chewy and not fluffy like the good ones. Also, the icing is WAY too sweet. I will not make this again.

Baked at 325 for 20 minutes, but it wasn't long enough.  Would suggest 350 for 20 minutes or longer at 325.

Wow - super sweet!  But really yummy.
I read the reviews and followed advice for making without a bread machine and allowing them to rise overnight.
Recipe was easy to follow and produced excellent buns.  
I might reduce sugar next time, to alleviate my own guilt when eating!

Well, after searching around and reading reviews, I tried this recipe...
All I can say is wonderful, and the icing is simply amazing.  This is a great recipe, and it's even easier than the instructions make it out to be.

Oh My Gosh! That is all there is to say about these! Obviously they are great, (almost 2000 people have said so!) I used fat- free cream cheese and Splenda to lower the calories a bit... It was fantastic! A word of caution.. they need to be cooked 20 min at least becuase I did 15 and they weren't done all the way. Also, if you have leftovers, (which is rare), they don't heat up so well... at least in the microwave. They are still great, a litle tough, but still good! Thanks for the recipe!

YUM!  I don't have a bread machine so I followed others advice for making these the "old fashioned way".  They turned out GREAT!  Stuck with the recipe "as-is" and was just delighted.  I don't own a rolling pin so I substituted a wine bottle which worked fine.  Fun to make with kids.  Next time I'm going to add some maple syrup to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Nuts, raisins, etc would also be nice.  Bon appetit!

I rated this one five stars even though they weren't perfect.  The imperfections were totally due to my inexperience I am sure.  The family loved them!  The middle ones were a bit doughy so i think i would probably lower the cooking temp a bit and cook them longer next time.  I went a little crazy with the middle stuffs but it was so yummy i am not at all sad about that.  Thanks for hooking me up with my FIRST EVAH rolled out dough!  ;-)

TOTAL YUM!!! 

On the latest batch I did not have enough cream cheese. So I added plain yogurt. However I let it sit in a coffee filter while I made the dough so I could remove most of the liquid from the yogurt. I really liked this adjustment, it took away a touch of the sweetness and added a wee bit of tartness...

Great dough recipe. I brush the rolled out dough with melted butter -too much buter will make the filling run out excessively. Next time I may use more yolks and less whole egg in the dough to make it richer. Very tasty.

I was impressed by these, but I think that I have had better. Althought they had the best aroma of all the cinnamon buns Ive made. It smelt as if you were standing in line at Cinnabon. I used another icing because I did not have cream cheese and it was very good indeed. Make sure your oven in calibrated correctly with these because the tops darken fast, and if your oven tends to run hotter than others, you must keep your eye on them. Good standard recipe, works wonderfully. A good recipe for first time cinnamon roll bakers. These are good for the type of person who doesnt like tooo gooey of cinnamon buns, but still very moist. Would be define with pecans.

Wow I loved this and so did all my friends.  I made 3 batches over 1 week and they were all gone! Like other reviews said, stick to the amount of cinnamon and sugar.  I found that the frosting was the right amount also.  Definitely will be making more in the next week.  Thanks for the recipe!

Incredible!  Icing was a little too sweet for me (just like Cinnabon), so I used extra cream cheese and less powdered sugar for the icing.

These are time consuming, but SO worth it. I made them the night before without a bread machine, using the recommendations from other reviewers. After all prep work was done, I covered the pan with sarap wrap and stuck them in the fridge. In the morning, I put them in the cold oven after setting temp to 350. Baked for 25 mins --they rose perfectly and tasted awesome! I will be making these from now on for special morning occasions. Thanks for the recipe!

When they are at the stage where you have them formed and need to let them rise, freeze. Then, let them thaw at least 24 hours in the frig and then let them come to room temp and rise before baking. Throwdown: Sticky Buns You can freeze them for up to 3 months in airtight container or good zip bag.

Awesome! I highly recommend this recipe, and I did make it without the bread machine, as previously recommended.....thank you for that info.
As good if not better than the actual Cinnabon!!!

Easy to make, although a little dry.  I'd make them again.  They disappeared within 24 hours!

I have made this recipe 2 times now and both time the rolls only lasted 1 day.  I was afraid to use all of the sugar and cimmamon but it ended up being a good amount in the end.  Next time I am going to make it a longer roll out and cut less rolls so I can make HUGE ones.

Just like a cinnabon. I forgot what they tasted like until I made these. They are super moist. I made 24 small buns, It was just the right amount of frosting.

OMG!  These are some of the best cinnamon rolls that I have ever had.  Like a lot of the other reviewers, I made the dough without a bread machine.  I also rolled & cut them up and put them in the fridge overnight.  Next morning, just popped them in a 350 degree over for about 25 minutes.  My family absolutely loved them.  The only change that I might make is to add chopped nuts to the filling.  YUM!!

So nice!:).
everyone appreciated them at home, even my mum who doesn't ordinarily like the cinnamon flavour.
I used a small can of dessert cream instead of the eggs and the texture was still great.
i also used a small packet of powdered coconut milk,put half of it in the dough, and the remaining half in the filling,along with some water, to have a paste.

The family rates these only a 4 because they are so sweet. I can't think of any way to make them less sweet except to make less filling or frosting. I made 1/2 recipe and got 8 nice sized rolls that I put in the refrigerator over night and the next morning raised them on a heating pad (thanks to an earlier reviewer who suggested doing so).  The only change I made in the recipe was to substitute almond extract in the frosting for the vanilla--just a personal preference.  The only change I would make would be to make them in a bigger pan (used and 8x8 pyrex pan) so they get more done in the middle.  Oh...I also added raisins to the filling which every liked.

Excellent dough recipe.
For us:
The yield was higher.  This time I made 17 rolls.  Obviously some are smaller than the recipe calls for.
I had extra frosting, and the frosting I did use was too sweet for my taste.  
No need to flip the rolls upside down.

These rolls were absolutely delicious!  Except for doubling the frosting, I wouldn't alter this recipe in any way at all.  What a great hit they have been with the family.  In fact, my fiance's dad told me that these are the best rolls he has ever had! I would suggest these with no hesitation at all to anybody.  Thank you for puting these online.

These cinnamon rolls are delicious. The icing is the best part! I followed the advice of others and baked mine at 350 for 25 minutes. I did not want burnt edges and raw dough on the inside so I would definitely not bake them at 400. Mine came out perfect.

Excellent recipe. Some friends invited me to dinner & i decided to bake these @ the last minute. I couldn't rest the dough yet they turned out great. Yummyyyyy...try adding some raisins to the filling or use apricot glaze intead of the white frosting.

simply delicious. i made it the semi-homemade way, tho. i used refrigerated biscuits and cut them in fours with a pizza cutter. i mixed the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture up ahead of time and put it in a tupperware container to pull out whenever i need it. i put the pieces in a single layer and bake with the directions of the biscuits, mine were 400 degrees for 10-12 minutes, i think. they were a little dry the first time so the second time i made them this is exactly what i did. i poured melted marg over the pieces and mixed them around. then i sprinkled the mix over them and baked them. at 10 minutes i pulled them out, mixed a little more of the mix with some more melted marg and stirred them around in it. then melted a little cream cheese frosting (thanks, betty crocker) in a bowl and drizzled it over them with a spoon. OMG! made it for a church breakfast and they were gone in seconds. i'm sure it's even better with homemade bread, but i just don't have the time. thanks!

These were wonderful!!!  I made them for Easter brunch and everyone loved them!  I made the dough by hand using warm milk and 1/4c splenda with the yeast.  I refridgerated the cinnamon rolls and put them in a cold oven and heated it to 350* in the morning!  I baked them for 22 minutes!  I also doubled the icing, but I think it was toomuch, even for extra dipping.  I think next time I will make 1 1/2 times icing!  My husband has already asked me to make more, and there is still one left!  I have a feeling I will be making these on a regular basis!  Thanks for the recipe, it will save me lots of money!!!

Extremely delicious and relatively easy.  I did not use a bread machine.  I just let the dough rise for 1 hour and then followed the directions from there one.  I placed it in the fridge overnight, let it rise for 20 minutes and then baked the rolls.  They were great!

These are so good! Just make sure you don't overcook them, because they lose a bit of the Cinnabon feel to them (still good though).

awesome!  very easy to make.  as another reviewer suggested, i made a double batch of the icing--now i have way too much icing leftover.  if you heat the icing a minute in the microwave it thins out considerably and is more than enough to cover the rolls.  whole family loved it!

So easy and soo yummy!  I only use 2 T. of cinnamon in the filling and it seems to be enough.  I prefer the cinnamon at the country bulk food store.  I've tried McCormick's cinnamon in this recipe and it was too spicy.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

How freaky is that! I made this yesterday, planned on reviewing it today, and surprise surprise, it's recipe of the day!

I halved the recipe and made 6 cinnamon rolls. They are HUGE! Next time I'll probably make 8 out of a halved recipe. The dough was kinda difficult to roll out cos it kept on shrinking back to its original state! Other than that, the rolls are great. I did not make the cream cheese icing, but made a basic icing sugar+Cream frosting.

I just got done making these,and the only problem I had was in the dough recipe, I didnt have any margarine so I used butter. The dough was hard to work with, too dry, and I think now that was why.They were great otherwise, I learned that for next time to make sure to use the margarine,lol! My kids LOVED them!

This recipe turned out awesome! I followed the other users as I don't have a bread machine, and I put the dough in the fridge over night after kneading the dough the first time after everything was mixed. I also doubled the frosting.

The filling didn't fall out after they were baked, but more so when I was cutting them because it's so dry. I think mixing the stuff with butter may work, but I just scooped up the extra sugar mixture and sprinkled it on top.

Anyway, I have made tons of cinnamon rolls and these were by far the best!

Very very good! I craved cinnamon rolls throughout this entire pregnancy, and these were the only ones worth mentioning (that weren't from the store). I, too, do not have a bread machine and was able to make these following the suggestions in other people's reviews. I will definitely be making these again!!!

Yummy, Yummy!! I did see some reviews saying the frosting was too rich and had too much cream cheese flavor and I agree. However, I made the frosting with an 8 oz pkg, not a 3 oz pkg like the recipe says...OOPS! (where do you even find a 3 oz pkg??) They were still amazing, but will be even better next time when I read the recipe closer! :)

OH MY GOODNESS!!! I am canceling Christmas!!! These were SO good! I did not alter the recipe one bit except taking the advice of the other reviewer and flipping them when taking out so the cinnamon drippings can seep back into the roll. You must have worked for Cinnabon to get this recipe exact...lol! Thanks a million!

I give this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 based on personal preferrence.  I don't have a bread machine so I took the advice of another reviewer on making the dough the standard way without the help of the bread machine.  Aside from the fact that the recipe was a little time consuming like any yeast bread recipe it was really simple.  The dough came out great - a good texture and wasn't sticky at all.  I used the dough hook on my mixer, so the kneading part was really simple.  

As for why I give the recipe 4 stars instead of 5?  I think the filling needs more cinnamon, and next time I'll experiment with the icing making it with all cream cheese instead of butter and cream cheese.

** ABSOLUTELY PERFECT **  I have never ever ever had such a delicious cinnamon roll in my life- no exaggeration (and I hope my mom doesn't read this!)
Perfect amount of filling, perfect amount of icing.  I made mine in the KitchenAid instead of a bread machine, and took the advice of one commenter to put parchment paper on the bottom of the pan.  
Thanks for a great recipe.  My kids are still licking their fingers!

This was good - I made it for my husband because his favorite part is the cream cheese icing. My first attempt I forgot to put in the eggs until after the flour - so I had to ditch that batch, but that wasn't the recipes fault! The second time turned out great, I found it a little hard to roll out but they still turned out good.

These are really good. My partner, who adores cinnamon rolls, declared these her very favorite. I'm more of a 'sticky bun' person, so while I liked these very much, there wasn't enough caramel gooey-ness for me. However, the frosting is very good -- I would NOT double the frosting, but that's because I don't like a lot of frosting. The dough is very nice and comes out fluffy and yeasty and delicious. Definitely do the flip and THEN frost. Very, very easy in the bread machine. I even messed up and somehow turned the machine off before they were done rising, but I just let them sit another 15 minutes and they still came out perfectly.

These are outstanding. I used a bread machine for the dough and cooked them on 350 for 22 minutes like someone else suggest and they were perfect. I also doubled the icing, tastes as close to a Cinnabon as you can get.

These were wonderful.  I don't have a bread machine so I read others' feedback and I was able to successfully make the dough with my Kitchen aid mixer.  I  let it rise for an hour in my oven which had been heated to 200 degrees and then shut off.

Used recipe as is, turned out great. Husband who proclaimed he hated cinnamon rolls enjoyed these - especially without any frosting!

What I changed was that I used all purpose flour (about 5 cups), an 8 gram pack of dry active yeast and white sugar. Then put them in the fridge over night and in the morning put them in a warm place for 30 minutes. I baked them for 20 minutes in 180 degrees C. They came out delicious! 
I didn't use the frosting because they were too sweet.

I found these way too sweet too and a little dry. The frosting makes too much. probably would have needed an 8th of that. with some tweaking it could be a good recipe.

My family loves these.  I make them with a stand mixer instead of my bread machine.  I use all purpose flour and sometimes substitute a cup of whole wheat flour to add a bit of fibre to them.

This recipe makes the best cinnamon rolls and all my friends, family, and even co-workers would agree.  I have never made cinnamon rolls before and I am a novice in the kitchen but I made THREE batches of these over the last week and everyone absolutley loved them.  I have a bread machine so it was super easy, I just added the ingredients in the order listed to the machine and the dough came out perfect.  I followed the recipe as shown and didn't have any problems at all. There was plenty of icing so I am not sure if I would double it like others have suggested.  The only thing I did differntly was put them in the fridge over night before baking them to save time in the morning.  Try them and you will see why they are rated so high!

I am sorry to report I am dissapointed in this recipe.  I followed the roll recipe exacty as posted. Warmed milk to the exact temperature,eggs at room temp, measured flour correctly, rolled to the correct size, made 12 rolls... The rolls did not rise as much as they should and they were not airy, they were pretty dry.  I even let them rise much longer and definitely in a warm place in hopes they would. I will try again with more yeast & less flour. I did not use this frosting recipe as I prefer cream cheese frosting on pumpkin bars & carrot cake but not on rolls. Just needs some tweaking.

These were really good, but almost a little too sweet.  I doubled the frosting like a lot of people suggested, but I think next time I make them I'll just make the 1 batch of frosting.  I also don't have a breadmaker so I don't know if that was the reason, but my rolls didn't raise a whole lot.  They tasted really good, but were pretty dense, not "fluffy" like I was expecting.  I followed the suggestions on making it without the bread maker, but it just didn't work out as well for me.  I'll definately try them again though, and maybe next time they'll be a 5/5 star recipe!

Absolutely BETTER than any other cinnamon roll recipe I've tried!! Super moist and mouth wateringly delicious! Definitely double batch the icing though. The lingering smell left in the house after baking them is the best part!

my husband hates sweets, but for some reason he has been on a cinnamon bun kick. so i told him about this recipe and he insisted i make it. another satisfied review -- these are delicious. i have no idea why you should turn them over after baking as someone suggested; it's not necesssary. next time i might put some finely chopped walnuts or pecans in with the cinnamon/sugar mix. the icing was the only thing my husband rated "not quite perfect" but it didn't stop us from eating them up!

Best cinnamon buns I ever had. Bread was light and fluffy, even the crust was great. Made as stated in the original recipe, except we were out of milk and just used water and a sprinkle of vanilla. Hands down, the best recipe I've found yet on this site. BIG thank you to the poster, this is a recipe that will be printed out and hung on the fridge.

These were outstanding. Easy to put together, and made the house smell wonderful.

The icing was delicious. We ended up thinning it with a little milk, because we like drizzled icing on cinnamon rolls, but the flavor was REALLY good.

Fantastic!  In fact, I have to make them for company, because I'll eat them all.

I did follow suggestion of flipping over pan so that all yummy stuff coats rolls rather than just sitting on bottom of the pan.  Thought it was a great suggestion!

I made these for Bunco and they were a HIT! I used all organic ingredients, so I didn't feel quite as guilty for eating 2 rolls. Thank you to the folks who mentioned how to use the non-bread machine version.

Simply Amazing!! Everyone loved this!!!!  I only changed 2 things.  I took another persons suggestion and changed the 4 1/2 cup bread flour to 2 cups whole wheat flour and 2 1/2 cup bread flour.  I also had to add a little more milk because the WW flour added more bulk.  I used a bread machine and they are great.  I also baked at 350 for 25 minutes. 
Wonderful - Wonderful - Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!

The best I have ever tasted! We moved to small town BC no more Cinnezo but now no need for one. More work than going to the mall but as good if not better and way cheaper! Thanks for the great recipe!

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!  These were SO good.  I do not have a bread machine so I mixed these by hand, it's a lot of work but well worth it!  I will make them again for Christmas morning.

These are wonderful!!  The texture of the bun is perfect and the brown sugar in the filling makes the wonderful gooey sauce you expect.  Make sure you don't overbake.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe on Thanksgiving morning, then I made it again with my 13 year old granddaughter on Saturday, then again last night.  Personally, I cut the cinnamon down by 2/3's.  The original recipe is too strong, but the rolls come out perfect every time.  For 40 years I've looked for a great cinnamon roll, and this is the only one for me!!!!

These are great. I got a lot of compliments on these. The only thing I find hard with these is the dough being so sticky, which makes it harder to make them pretty and not stick to everything. However, I didn't want to over flour (the board, rolling pin, etc...), so that's part of the reason why.The icing tastes a little too much like cream cheese, so next time I will cut back on the cream cheese, but that's just a prefernce. This is a really great recipe if you want to impress.

I made these last night, they were lovely. The only thing was they didnt rise as much as I would have liked but that was down to me not the recipe I dont have much luck with dough but still these dissapeared quickly. I did sprinkle some currants on top of the sugar before I rolled it up just because of personal preference. Wonderfully sweet and gooey. YUM! Thankyou for the great recipe.

I just made these rolls and they are THE BEST.  I did use my SIL's recipe for the bread which is 1 yellow butter cake mix, 2.5c of hot water, 2 packages of yeast and about 5 c of flour.  mix together, let rise for 1 hr, beat down and roll out... THE BEST!  make sure that the cake mix doesn't have pudding in it.

Soooo good.  Based on other reviews, I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes, which was just right.  Also, I'm not a big fan of cream cheese, so for the icing I used 3 c. powdered sugar, 1 T vanilla extract, and about 5 T of milk.  Even the leftovers are good!

Tried this recipe and they were awesome! I received a few requests to make more. My daughter didn't like the cream cheese icing. Tried it again w/o the cream cheese and she couldn't stop eating them. I will definitely make again.

I took the advice and flipped it afer it got out of the oven.  And it kept the gooey yumminess inside the rolls.

Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

This was so good! I didn't have any cream cheese on hand for the icing and since sour cream tastes similar (at least to me) I substitued 1/4 cup of that instead. It turned out fabulously. Even my picky, taste sensitive husband couldn't get enough and the next day asked me to make more.

These were fantastic.  I live in the UK and have an American husband.  I have never had a cinnabon, but he was very impressed with these and said they were just as good.

I prepared the rolls the night before and stored them overnight in the fridge.  I took them out and allowed them to rise in the warm in the morning.  It worked well.

The frosting was very sweet, so I kept it on the side and allowed people to choose how much they put on.

Amazing.

I know they are a heart attack in every bite!  But you know, they are worth it!

I think they beat cinnabon by far!

These rolls are amazing. I followed the recipe as written except tried to increase it by half.  Lesson learned, too big a batch for the bread machine. I ended up bailing out the dough and finishing with my dough hook on my mixer. The construction of these are so simple and fun.  The frosting is terrific. My six year old daughter is home sick from school and she absolutely loved it.  What great medicine!  These rolls will be perfect for any special or ordinary occasion.  I think I'll give them as gifts for Christmas morning treats this year!  Definitely will use this recipe and share it with friends.  Thank you!

Not so great, tasted nothing like a cinnabon.  I liked the idea of using the bread machine to make the dough, but I will not make these again.  I have a much simpler recipe that uses frozen bread dough, and whipping cream that tastes much better than this one.

Not quite a Cinnabon but pretty darn good anyway. I've tried various recipes for cinnamon buns over the years and these are the best yet. I did not use my bread machine since one of things I like best about making homemade bread or rolls is kneading the dough. I used butter instead of margarine and made 16 smaller rolls instead of 12 large. They still took about 27 minutes rather than 15 to bake at 400. They are not difficult to make if you have the time and are truly worth the effort.

Let me start out by saying that I have never heard of a "cinnabon" so I can't really compare this to the real thing. As far as cinnamon buns go, I found these "okay." They weren't gooey enough for me. However, the icing was delicious and my boyfriend thought they were amazing.

This is definetely a Five Star recipe !!  I have NEVER EVER tasted better Cinnamon buns in my life (not even in a bakery).  My whole family loved these and I am sure to make them again.  I was so proud of making a Cinnabon that was of "Professional Bakery" caliber.  WOW!

You do not need a bread machine to do this one. I just used my regular yeast and Kitchen Aid mixer. These are really good and worth the effort!

Very yummy!  We added more cinnamon and brown sugar.  Also did the whole block of cream cheese (8 oz, I think) in my frosting.  Like much better than cinnabon ... cinnabon are too sweet for me.

ASTOUNDINGLY GOOD.  I MUST MAKE THEM AGAIN SOON!!!!!  I am a fairly low-skill cook, and this was my second bread machine recipe, so I ended up botching the bread dough resulting in unrisen buns.  (I figured out what I did incorrectly -- the milk was much, much too hot.  I will account for this next time.)  I will adjust next time, and look forward to the full-blown product. But even the unrisen rolls, once baked, tasted soooo good.  I got up very early one morning to make these, but the leftovers were so good the next day that next time I think I'll just make them in advance and reheat, as long as it's a casual setting.  Fantastic recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing it.

Have made this recipe a few times now and just can't change to another.  I did however add white sugar with the brown sugar in the filling. Personaly prefered i guess but would sugguest to try it. Add 1/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar.

I love the recipe as is and I love using my bread machine.  The only change I have made to this recipe is instead of using vanilla extract I've used orange extract.  My sons loved it. Both versions ahve beena huge hit in our house.

Wow!  Over the top. I read a few of the reviews and I knew I had to try this.  Am I glad I did.  My health conscious sister who never eats anything that's bad for her, ate 2 huge buns, and is trying to hide the other buns so that only she will eat them.  She tells everybody that they are horrible, so they won't eat any of them. These really are sooo good.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the interior was underdone.    If I had let it stay in the oven long enough for the interior to finish, the tops would have burned. Next time I will bake @ 350 or 375 for about 20 minutes instead. Then it will be a 5 star recipe.

These were great and a lot easier to make then I thought they would be. I changed up a few things, added extra cinnamon (4 tbsp)and I used all purpose flour since thats all I had. Everyone loved them! I'll be adding this to my list of favorites!

Just chiming in here.  Clearly, this is a solid recipe that will produce beautiful rolls.  All the techniques people are suggesting to keep the filling in the rolls do work.  Add a little flour (I add a spoon of barley malt powder), increase the cinnamon, and then, if needed, turn the rolls over after baking.  You shouldn't have too much leaked filling to begin with, though.  Sometimes I double the filling and it still stays in the rolls.  No complaints from any cinnamon beneficiaries.

This was a good recipe for cinnamon rolls, but didn't quite match Cinnabon.  I like it (I think Cinnabon is too sweet), but my husband didn't like them as well.  I don't think he ate any of the leftovers!

These are really good!!  I had to make them three times in a week.  My mother keeps saying that she is putting in her request for more of these!  As for the frosting I just poured it on top of the rolls after they come out of the oven--the ones that don't get eaten immediately I keep in the fridge and pop in the microwave for 30 sec.

did I miss something? I really expected to have these AWESOME rolls after reading all the reviews...they were ok, but I definitely wouldn't rave about them like all the others....to me, they were dry - I'm attempting to do the icing this morning in hopes that that will make them better! the dough turned out fabulous in my bread machine - jsut wish the filling was more "gooey"

If you haven't added this recipe to your recipe boxes yet...don't delay. This is probably THE best recipe for cinnamon rolls ever.  I didn't make a ton of changes, but did use a little more cream cheese in the frosting, as others had suggested.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, and an instant hit with the family.

These were just like Cinnabon. Stringy and undone in the middle. I don't care for Cinnabon because of that but my whole family loves them. Next time I will bake according to another viewer at a lower temperature for a longer time. Otherwise, I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe from this site and they were gone before anything else on the brunch bar.

This is a fantastic recipe!  The icing is amazing, and it is a relatively easy recipe... if you have the bread machine.  After the cinnamon rolls have baked for 10-12 minutes, I recommend transferring them to a new 9x13 pan, and pour the drippings from the old pan over the cinnamon rolls in the new pan, and bake for the remaining amount of time.  This is a fantastic recipe!

Just like the original!  I do make 16 rolls instead of the 12.  They are still quite large and just as delicious.

I am only rating the icing, because that was what I made to go on my honey bun cake recipe from this site. It is sooooo good!!! I think much better with the cream cheese, and not just sugar and milk. I don't have a bread machine so I did not make rolls. Hope to ge one soon so I can try the buns.

These were wonderful!  The dough was nice and light.  The frosting was rich and creamy.  I baked this in a 9x13 inch pan and an 8 inch round to give the rolls more room to spread.  I didn't change anything.

This is exactly what it claims to be; a sticky, gooey, rich cinnamon roll, therefore it gets a 5.  My kids loved them, asked me to make them everyday.  My husband and I laughed because when we ate these we remembered why we haven't eaten at Cinnabon in over 15 years.  This is something to splurge on every 2 to 3 decades.  We tend to like a lighter cinnamon roll.  Trust me, the money you save from buying these at the mall will be spent at the Dr. office for clogged arteries if you eat too many.  Good for an occassional treat, but I'll be making my usual recipe next time.

i've been baking yeast breads and rolls for several years now and have constantly looked around for a really good cinnamon roll recipe -- and THIS IS IT! my husband, who just adores cinnamon rolls, never bothers with the store-made ones after i've started making these for him.  excellent recipe!  tastes great even w/o the frosting.  thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC!  I am not very good with baking but this was sooo easy! I did not have bread flour nor a bread machine so I used all-purpose and mixed by hand (just a little elbow grease!) I will be making these for now on instead of buying them pre-made at the mall or the store!

This is a wonderful recipe except the icing never comes out right for me. I must be doing something wrong because the icing is too overpowering. Other than that the rolls turn out perfect every time. I like to bake mine in a muffin tin. Still it's a great recipe!

Yum! I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the Kitchen Aid mixer directions someone previously posted. I was worried because my dough didn't seem to rise very much either time, but it still turned out perfectly! I had two as soon as they were out of the oven...

I have never used my bread machine, or made any bread type thing from scratch so I was a bit nervous about these. They turned out great! my husband said he never wanted a can cinnamon roll again. I used margarine all three times, instead of butter, and it was fine.

I followed the advice of other reviewers. Used 8g active dried yeast, kneaded the dough with the dough hook, mixed the softened butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon to spread on the dough, and baked it at 350 F for 25 minutes. Very nice. Thank you for posting.

These were so easy and so yummy!  I didn't realize until we tried to make the icing that I only had 1/3 cup of powdered sugar.  Each roll got a small amount of icing but they were still great!  Will have to make again very soon with more icing!

Great recipe.  I roll these out thinner then the recipe says so I double the brown sugar/cinnamon and butter filling.  I also add 1/2 cup flour to the brown sugar and cinnamon.

These were amazing but admittedly me and my better half changed the topping huge. The buns themselves are to die for no doubt. For the topping we used 1/2 cup cream 1/3 cup butter melted 1/3 cup brown sugar and filled it with icing sugar for the correct consistency then poured it over the hot buns. AWESOME. Thanks for this recipe a keeper for sure.

We live three hours from the closest Cinnabon so these are a must every now and then!!!

I used this recipe to make my very first cinnamon rolls (and only my 2nd attempt at yeast bread) and it was a success!!!  My very picky family loved it!  I will absolutely make these again.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

The night before I tried to make cinnamon rolls and it didn't turn out.  I was so disappointed and was nervous about how this one would turn out.  My husband loved it and I was so blessed to find a good recipe.  Thank you for sharing!!!

These went over great with the family!!  It's dangerous to have a dozen of these in the house with only a family of three, so I had to share with the neighbors.  They were ever so grateful to take a few!  This was my first attempt ever making cinnamon rolls from scratch.  It was very easy, just time consuming.  Definitely worth the time to make!  This is a keeper!

This has become a family tradition for Christmas morning. Totally awesome!!  Sometimes when I am making just for my hubbie and kids, we use pre-made cream cheese frosting on top.  Its not the same, but still tastes pretty good.

These were good- everyone loved, but I personally prefer a more gooey cinnamon roll.  These were a little dry for me, especially the next day.  The cream cheese frosting was VERY good.

Absolutely delicious.  The only thing I changed was I added a little bit more cream cheese to the icing.  I baked them for 14 minutes on 375(my oven cooks hot).  They turned out great.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe, I will be making these again!!

Wow, these rolls are to die for!  I put about 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in, instead of using all white flour.  I made them using my mixer because I don't have a bread machine.  They turned out terrific and got rave reviews from every member of the family.  I also made them the night before so that the only thing I had to do in the morning was let them rise (they really didn't rise much and I let them sit there for 1 1/2 hours!), and make the frosting.  It didn't seem to matter that they didn't rise again, because they still ended up growing in the oven and were huge!  Thank you for a great recipe!!

These are delicious.  I halve the dough and add cinnamon to it but leave the filling in the original quantity.  I sprinkle chopped pecans on after I've spread the filling. Also I just drizzle the frosting over so I use much less. DELICIOUS.

Even though I had to substitute for the eggs and milk (my husband's allergic) these were still fabulous.  I used a product called "Ener-G" for the eggs (Whole foods has it).  I switched water with a little extra sugar and butter for the milk.  Topped the rolls with a butter cream made without milk, and got a huge kiss from the allergic hubby.  Thanks for this one, Marsha!

I made these last night, but my bread machine didn't work.  I guess there was too much stuff in it.  I ended up finishing it by hand.  It didn't really rise well, so they ended up a bit heavy.  But all in all they were delicious.

These really do taste just like a cinnabon. They are amazing.  I sometimes make double frosting.  Everyone loves these.

Wow oh wow!  These were unbelievable.  Made them to bring at frieds house where we were invited for dinner.  The only thing I changed was the icing.  I put a whole package (330g) of cream cheese and left the rest of the ingredients the same.  It was sooooo good.  Will do them again!  thank you!

Wow!  In the time I've had this recipe (about two months), I've made these "clones" five times already.  I don't like cinnamon rolls, but was looking for a recipe for my husband (who is a cinnamon roll connoisseur) and he made me make two batches in three days.  Even I had to eat a couple, they were so good.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

This was good, just the roll  part seemed a little dry.  The cream cheese icing is to die for. These were somewhat effortless making the dough in the bread machine.

I've used this recipe twice and both times I've been disappointed.  I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out ok, but nothing like all the reviews rave about.  I wish I knew what I was missing.

I've made this twice. Perfect. Do turn them upside down immediately out of the oven to stop the brown sugar/cinn. from running out. Then put on icing in about 3 minutes. Easy w/bread machine!

This was my first time ever making cinnamon rolls and I don't have a bread machine. I made it for my daughter to take to school for a bake sale. I don't think I did everything right,no bread machine, but they came out pretty good and sold well at the bake sale.

I didn't like using the full amount of the filling or the icing.  It was just too much.  I've heard from several people I've given them to that these were the best they had ever tasted.  I added a little red food coloring to the icing to make great Valentine's Day gifts.  They are a huge hit!

If I was on a deserted island and could take only one food to eat for the rest of my life - this would be it!  I could eat these all day long.  They hit the spot better than anything else.  Recipe is easy and I make exactly as listed.

We have voted 5 stars because this was the best cinnabons I have ever tasted!
(the top review was written by my 5 year old son Austin)

I took these cinnamon rolls to a family get together, and everyone loved them and said that they were the best they had ever eaten.

I doubled the icing and should have doubled the cinnamon filling. As is, there's not enough filling to make the Cinnabon "gooeyness" and they end up dry. Also, unless you double the filling, it does no good to flip the roll when you're finished because there isn't any filling on the bottom to pour over the top. I mixed the cinnabon and suger with the butter as suggested by another reviewer -maybe that's part of why the filling didn't form the syrup on the bottom? The recipe definitely has possibilites through.

I used this recipe as my first time ever, attempt to make cinnamon rolls from scratch. They are awesome. This will be the recipe I use from here on out.  Some of my relatives have already put in requests for me to bake these for them around the holidays.

Great cinnamon rolls!  The only thing I changed was that I used a can of whipped cream cheese frosting instead of making my own.  It tasted just as good and took out a step.  Yummy!

These are the absolute best. I doubled the icing(as per other reviews) and found that I really didn't need to.  But, my kids don't really like icing on their cakes either.  These were just as good on day three(if sealed in a container) as day one. They are 'better' than cinnabons, in our opinion. Although not healthy, but good enough to make again on special occasions. GREAT RECIPE!!

OMG!  This is FABULOUS!  I made them last night, took them to work this morning and they have already told me to make more for tomorrow and that I am in charge of bringing these to every company function in the future.  I didn't change with the recipe, I did however have to lower the cooking time, 9 to 10 minutes was good in my oven - FABUOLOUS.  I can't say enough about these and how wonderful they turned out.  If I could give it more stars I would.  Highly recommended.

These were great!  My family loved them.  My only concern was how sticky the batter was when I went to roll them.  I had a hard time getting them to roll because they were sticking.  I used my bread machine which made them a snap to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

*Edit*  I have now been making these for years and they are just as good now (maybe better) then when I started making them.  What I have changed and has produced a better product for me was lowering the temp to 350 degrees and cooking them 10 minutes longer.  I used to get really brown tops and the rolls in the center were doughy and not completely cooked through.  Now they come out perfect.  BTW, I have a new oven and the temp is spot on.

These are wonderful, and possibly the best thing I've EVER baked.  I'll be making these over and over again, but next time I'll double the icing.

Excellent recipe, have used both AP & bread flour to make this - better with bread flour.  I did not use a bread machine to make dough. Per others recommendations only used ~1.5 T of cinnamon and they turned out well. I've also made them the night before and put them in the fridge and they've been fine.  I did double the icing and am glad I did - although it was too much I think it would have been too sparce had I not done so.  I think 1.5 times the icing amount would be perfect (4.5 oz cream cheese, 6 T butter, 2 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar, 3/4 t vanilla, dash salt).

I don't know why I can't get this recipe to work.  My dough keeps coming out really heavy.  It doesn't rise as much as I would like.  The flavor is good but the texture isn't light and fluffy enought for me.  I'm giving this one up.  It's frustrating because so many have raved about it.

This recipe is just outstanding!  The sweetness of the bread was just perfect and I definantly wouldn't double the icing amount, it was just right the way the recipe said to make it. I will be making these again and again.

I loved this recipe.  The buns were big, warm and gooey... perfect!  I even had a loyal cinnabon fan tell me "wow, its BETTER than a cinnabon".  The recipe was also somewhat easy, considering this was my first attempt at any sort of cinnamon bun. The icing was also delicious, especially when put on the buns fresh out of the oven, mmm! I will definitley make it again, and highly recommend it.

A five for the frosting but for some reason they weren't as soft as I like in a cinnamon roll. I thought I did everything right but maybe not.

The cinnamon bun part is good, but all the butter and brown sugar in the middle of the roll creates a crunchy carmel in the bottom of the pan after they are cooked. While this doesn't taste bad, it's not something I want on the bottom of my rolls. The frosting is amazing though. I just used 1 c. of powdered suger so it wasn't too sweet. Yummy!

I found this recipe very convincing! It had a smooth and light texture and made beautiful rounded coils. They looked and tasted just like the Cinnabons you buy at the shop, the only difference is you can make and smell them cooking in your very own kitchen! This was a great recipe and the whole family enjoyed it the only problem is once you start eating them you'll find it impossible to stop!

I think that I did not let them rise long enough before baking.  They turned out kinda gooey instead of fluffy.  I think I would also decrease the sugar/cinnamon mixture just a little.  The frosting was excellent.  I will have to try again - Maybe next time they will turn out better.

Wonderful.  Cinnabon's are wonderful and I have never tasted (yet alone made) anything that tasted so simular.  Great recipe!  Everyone loved it and the icing was wonderful too!

This was Delish! Made by hand and it was super easy.  Thanks for the quick reminders Reviewers.  I tried both pans(round) and the muffin pan idea.  I'd Nix the muffin pans.  They weren't soft as they were when baked together, and they grew up out of the pans in weird configurations and the filling fell out never to quite go back in after inverting them.  Made them for company and two days later I received a call from a grocery store asking what ingredients were needed!  Needless to say, I emailed the recipe.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe, Marsha.

These cinnamon buns are excellent! These were my first attempt at cinnamon buns and they turned out perfect...I brought them into work and they didn't last 10 minutes. I don't have a bread machine, but they aren't that hard to make...I make them just about every weekend now! They're still just as good without the sugar in the dough (omitted it a couple times by pure accident).

My husband loves these things. I'm not big on Cinnabon's... I prefer the cinnamon rolls from a can. My husband, though, says these are exactly like the ones from Cinnabon and requests them often.

i know i know.. another 5 star rating??  This recipe deserves them all and more.. it is great.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and it was very easy.. I wasnt sure if i had done it correctly when I pulled the dough out of my bread machine, but it rolled out well, and rose great in the pan on a warm stove.  I also loved the icing..  One of the best recipes I have gotten from this site!! Thanks!!

Great Recipe I have gotten rave reviews.  Sometimes I add some minced pecans to the filling and I usually make extra icing.  Also, make sure not to roll the dough to thin unless you want crunchy rolls, and watch carefully so they don't over bake.

The dough was very tough and did not rise.  The rolls came out hard and not at all soft like the ones at Cinnabon.  Will not attempt again.

This is just fantastic!  I made exactly as stated and turned out amazingly good.  This one's a definate keeper.  I timed the dough so that the rising times were syncronized with my children's pick up/drop offs.  My husband came home to the smell of his favorite sweet.  This did take all day but it is well worth it.

Fantastic recipe.  Easy to make, VERY impressive.  When I asked my college student nephew if he would come over to help my husband move some furiture, I offered to pay him or cook dinner.  He asked for a batch of these cinnamon rolls instead!!!  (I love COLLEGE STUDENTS they WILL WORK FOR FOOD).

Wow- these are fantastic! I've made these cinnamon rolls several times and have had success every time. I use the dough cycle on my bread machine and have had no problems with the end result. Better make a double batch- they will go quick!!!

These were good, although I had some bum yeast, so they weren't very fluffy. I divided the dough in half to make 24 mini-cinnibons.. while they weren't as lucious as a big one, they were still very good.

SO GOOD! They were gone before they could cool! FOOLPROOF! and i DID NOT use a bread machine! I would only cook them 350 degrees for 20 mins. 25 max. 400 is too hot for these. ( i think) you CANNOT tell the difference in cinnabons from the mall and these. OMG my husband loves them I got the recipe yesterday and im making more tomorrow!!!

It's all about the icing.  These are so close to Cinibon's it's scary.  My husband (and I) loved them.  16x21 sounds like a big rectangle but you also get really big rolls. I got 13 rolls and that was after I cut off the measly ends.  I mixed the gooey center part together then spread it on. Did end up needing to make a tad more that way.  I kept 8 and gave 5 to my daughter and son in law.  I thought the icing just made enough for eight.  Sent some store bought with them (hope it was ok cause sure wouldn't want to ruin those rolls). I did make mind with the bread machine but had to scrape the corners cause it wasn't mixing completely.  I made them the night before and let them sit out for an hour before baking.  Worked great.

While I didn't think these rolls quite measured up to real Cinnabons, the rest of the office disagreed with me and inhaled them.  I mixed and kneaded the dough in a Kitchenaid mixer, rather than a bread machine.

These rolls are sooo good. I don't think they taste just like a cinnabon does, but they're the best cinnamon roll recipe I've found yet. A definite keeper in my recipe box. YUM:)

It seems redundant to post yet another five-star review, but I have to say that this recipe is positively sinful. I frosted the rolls with Sour Cream Frosting from this site (a great alternative if you don't want to use a cream-chesse frosting), and they came out great! The entire batch was gone within an hour. My search for the perfect cinnamon roll is over!

These were really great, but I found that the baking time was a little long.  Next time I make them, I'll take them out about 2 minutes early...they seemed too crispy on the edges.  True Cinnabon goodness is the softness of the bun.  Also, as good as these were, they took a lot of time to prepare and make.  Probably better for special occasion cooking than for spur of the moment Saturdays.

These cinnamon rolls are divine.  My in-laws were over when I made them, and the first thing that my father in-law said was that they reminded him of being in an airport eating cinnabon cinnamon rolls.  I smiled and told him the name of the recipe.  I actually used regular flour and margarine and I didn't regret it because they still tasted wonderful.  I had contemplated doubling the icing, (as one of the reviewers recommended) but I'm glad that I didn't because there was plenty of icing and we didn't even use it all. They were also just as wonderful the next day heated up in the microwave!

These cinnamon rolls were delicious.  I made them Christmas Eve and baked them Christmas morning.  Quick, easy and better than store bought!  My family loved them.  Thanks.

I couldn't believe I hadn't rated this already. I've made them so many times. They are in much demand and are requested in place of birthday presents! I make them for my sister when she visits from USA. Cinnabons are the first thing I have when I visit her. We can't tell the difference.

I am still amazed how simple & easy these were to make.  They were delicious & very similar to the expensive "cinnabons" you buy.  I followed the recipe exactly & would not change a thing.  I will be making these again!

These are incredible!  Most cinnamon rolls are flaky but these are absolutely delicious!  My 85 year old grandfather begs me for these at least every couple of weeks.  His absolute favorite!

For some reason, as per some recommendations, ommitted the icing. However, buns turned out hard, uncurled during cooking process and tasted too yeasty - not sweet at all. Was it the Splenda I used? Not pleasant...

This recipe should go down in history as the best homemade cinnamon rolls EVER.  Really.  I have been using this one for two years since I discovered it here, and it is tried and true.  This is SOO good.  Just make plenty of frosting...not that the rolls need it, but because it, too, is SOO good!  Yum.

My husband loves cinnamon rolls and this really hit the spot.  This is the greatest cinnamon roll recipe that I have tried.  My husband had me make them for everyone he knows.  They are even great warmed the next day.  Thank you.

WOW........I couldn't stop raving about this recipe at work today. As I live in Australia, Cinnabon was not a common sight in my shopping centre until a month ago.  They certainly wont be getting my business now as these were so easy and delicious.  My husband made the first batch in our new woodfired oven and I can guarantee we will be making these regularly.  There goes the diet.

Well, I wouldnt say these are as good as a cinnabon, but pretty dang good! I have been wanting to learn forever and have been scared to try, after getting my bread machine I decided to get brave and WOW, now I wish I had done it sooner!  Thanks for a great recipe!

All I can say is WOW!  My mom used to make the best cinnamon rolls ever, but I think I may actually compete this year ;)!!  Would also be good with some raisins, chocolate chips or nuts in the center.

These rolls were excellent.  All agreed that they were, in fact, BETTER than cinnabon.  They were surprisingly easy to make, with the bread machine doing most of the work.  This will be a permanent addition to the recipe collection!

This recipe is great.  I was a little worried when the buns came out of the oven a little bit hard on the tops, but the icing soaked right in and made them soft and yummy.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  The boyfriend loves them!!!

Really good!!  The only problem I had was some of the roles didn't get done enough and others were well browned (blame it on the oven).  Next time I'll put in two separate pans to ensure more thorough cooking.  But still the best homemade Cin Rolls I've ever had.

Very yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Mine were a little "undone - gooey" in the middles, so I want to play with them to get them "done-gooey".  But the flavor and easy deserves 5 stars, still.  I love the icing, the cream cheese gives it that extra tang.  I couldn't keep my fingers out of the icing.  This will be a regular special treat in our house, and a great dish to give as gifts with the rolls ready to bake and a baggie full of icing.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe to be much easier to make than other cinnamon roll recipes I had tried, and I thought the dough turned out beautifully.  I used regular yeast, not bread machine yeast, but it worked great anyway.  The only complaint at my household (from my husband and my 6 year old) was that it was too "cinnamony."  Next time I make these, I'll reduce the amount of cinnamon.

The flavor was PERFECT!!!  The roll itself was a little too chewy - I will try the recipe again, but I will make some modifications to the dough so that it is not as firm.

These were so good. I made them for my Dad's birthday and everyone loved them. I didn't use a bread machine and it was still easy.

Wonderful! My whole family loved them. My husband said that they are way better than Cinnabons. Will make again and again! Thank you.

I've been looking for a great cinnamon roll recipe and I believe I've found it!  My family loved it.  It is very decadent but that's how Cinnabons are.

This is a favorite. I enjoy the taste of CinnaMonsters to Cinnabons, so I alter this slightly to get the other brands taste. I use more real butter in the icing to create the change. Just from experience, NEVER make the icing with margarine. That was all I had one night, so I tried. Makes the icing too runny and not very smooth.

I have to be totally honest in the I have neve had a Cinnabon before, I know what they are but have never eaten one. (Stop laughing). These were great. My husband and 5 year old loved them. Next time, I will take the advice of a previous reviewer and make them the night before and let them rise over night. I had to get up a 6:00am on a Sunday to make these and they werent done until 9:00 am - too much work but they were worth it!

I'm reviewing only the icing, because I used the roll recipe for Cinnamon Rolls III. This was absolutely delicious and simple to make. It's so declicous when warm and melted on top of a fresh cinnamon roll! I added a pinch of cinnamon for fun.

The absolute best and easiest cinnamon roll ever.  I always double the recipe including the frosting.  I keep some frosting in the fridge to add extra to the bun and microwave for a late night snack.

This is the first 5-star recipes I've tried on allrecipes that actually turned out 5 stars!  This is an *amazing* recipe and I honestly can't tell the difference between this and a real Cinnabon!  It took about 4-4.5 hours to finish, but it was well worth it!!!

This recipe is simply unbelievable. That is a direct quote from my husband! I am really new with yeast recipes and this was easy and turned out wonderfully. I have already passed it on to several friends. 
I don't have a bread machine and with the reviews I was able to convert it easily and with great success!Thanks for the recipe and all the great tips.

What a fantastic recipe for my family!  Simple and pretty easy to make, and delicious.  I also have been making them with Splenda for my father who is border-line diabetic, and I couldn't believe how great they were!  I just didn't ice them, and I honestly couldn't tell that there was Splenda.  Thank you for this recipe!

OH MY GOSH! These are SO DEE-LICIOUS! The hubby had his doubts and was very skeptical. Now he's eating his words (much to HIS delight!) He LOVES the kind that you can get at the mall, and says that these are EVEN BETTER! He keeps raving about how good these are and will tell anyone who will listen. (And he NEVER does that!) I can't say it tastes exactly like the mall version, but it DEFINITELY hits the spot and satisfies the craving! Oh yeah---the 3 year-old and 6 year-old cleaned their plates as well!  TOTALLY worth the effort! Thank you, Marsha, for submitting this recipe and making me the "Cinnabon Goddess", and thanks to all the previous reviewers who had tips on making this without a bread machine----I was clueless!

Thank you so much for this recipe! We couldn't believe how delicious these rolls were - they did taste exactly like Cinnabon! I accidently used a 6 oz. cream cheese, so I just doubled the other frosting ingredients to make twice the frosting. It was all eaten up. Thanks!!

Finally, a cinnamon roll recipe my husband approved!  The dough is just right and the icing is divine.  I made these last night and put them in the oven this morning.
I would recommend lining the pan with parchment paper.

I don't have a bread machine, so I did my best following others' advice here.  All of my ingredients were fresh, yet I had trouble with the rising, both the first time and the second time before baking.  Anyway, they turned out fairly well and the family enjoyed them.  I like how inexpensive they are to make, and will probably make them again.

This was amazing.  They tasted 99% like a cinnabon.  I served them for dessert at Sunday supper and everyone almost fell over at how great these taste.  I highly recommend making these.  The bread machine part makes it so simple.  Thank you Marsha.

This recipe is incredible! Every time I make it I get tons of compliments. It has even been suggested that we have a cinnamon bun party once a month. The catch is that I'm the one who has to bring the cinnamon buns.

We live in a VERY rural area, with no Cinnabon stores even remotely close, the mere thought of having a Cinnabon Clone gives me chills!  They were a big hit with everyone at work and at home!  Thanks so much!!

I always get a lot of compliments when I make this recipe.  To me it tastes just like a Cinnabon.  Others that have tasted this don't always agree but they do agree that these cinnamon rolls are awesome!

This was GREAT!!!!  I made this for our son who visits us every Wednesday night. It was a big hit with everyone. I gave him some to take home and he said it was just as good the next night. This was so easy and quick to make.  Its a KEEPER at our house.  Thanks Marsha.

I must say I didn't really think they tasted like THE cinnabons, but they stand on their own and are very delicious. The frosting is to die for.

Color me unimpressed. They were too gooey, the icing was too sweet. I think the idea is there, but there's too much of pretty much everything.

This is a great recipe!  I made it over the weekend, and everyone loved it.  I am going to try and make the rolls smaller for my son's class next week (maybe cutting the dough in half and then rolling it).  Very simple, and pretty full-proof.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good. Needs to bake a bit longer than the directions say, though- mine came out chewy.
Time consuming, but good flavor!

I have made these cinnamon rolls for years!  The cream cheese frosting is good to use on many other recipes like zucchini cake.  I have made these cinnamon rolls for friends and family with all great praises.  A must try for sure.  You can make large cinnamon rolls or smaller ones, which I do by just cutting the big sheet of dough in half length wise.  Then just make two log rolls, cut and place in pan like normal.

PHENOMENAL. made them by hand, making sure to sift the flour before i measured it. dough was a bit sticky at first but fine after a bit of kneading. ate at least half the batch myself, then had to make another batch for friends and family who now think i'm a superstar.  dangerously good recipe.

The most amazing cinnamon rolls ever!! Better than a Cinnabon.  Better than anything I've ever had!  To the person whose recipe did not come out moist and soft:  I don't have a bread machine either.  When I first started making these I kneaded by hand.  You have to make sure that the dough is kneaded thoroughly, and I also add a bit more butter and milk just so the dough is easier to handle.  Also, if you have a food processor with kneading tool--USE IT!  I just got mine, and it does wonders!

Made this recipe yesterday for a family dinner, and the results were incredible!  I added a bit to the filling (1 1/2 times the recommended amount) and doubled the topping so that they'd be really gooey.  I also cooked them on 380 degrees for 20 minutes.  I thought I'd made tons, but after everyone's snitching the leftovers, they were all gone.  And no wonder, they were the best cinnamon rolls I'd ever tasted!!!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Since you use a bread maker for these they're really easy and not at all messy!  I rolled mine out on waxed paper to reduce mess on the counter and it worked great!  I might reduce the brown sugar next time, but that's just me!

all i have to say is wow!...great recipe, but i recommend a lower temperature and longer baking time, cause i did 22 minutes at 375 and they still were a little raw inside. I used my great grandmother's ancient, stand-up mixer and they still came out wonderful..very impressive!

These are absolutely fab! Mine needed to be baked a little longer, but the end result is well worth the wait. I'm taking a couple with me to work (along with the recipie). I've got to brag about these to someone!

These are the best homemade cinnamon rolls I've ever tried...if I didn't know better, I would have sworn they were Cinnabons!!  The texture of the rolls is wonderful...very light and tender, and the icing adds a nice touch!  Thank you for this recipe!

These are very, very good.  I do not use a bread machine and doubled this recipe withiut trouble.  I did add 2 TBS. of flour to brown sugar filling to thicken it and help keep it in the rolls. My co-workers ask for these often.

Very good but overly sweet.  The brown sugar mixture goes a long way and I agree that 3/4 of that should be sufficient.  I learned the hard way and baked in an insulated pan.  BIG MISTAKE.  Came out very doughy and I ended up having to bake it for almost another 15 mins. and they never rose quite like they should have.  I will make again, however, in a regular pan.

WOW...like others, I was skeptical at first, but these cinnamon buns really do taste just like Cinnabons!!  I don't have a bread machine, so I used a KitchenAid mixer w/the dough hook, and the buns turned out great.  Everyone should try this recipe.

Man was my boyfriend surprised to get these for breakfast in bed!  They were easy and great.  We both felt it there was too much brown sugar, so I will go lighter on that next time but otherwise, thanks for the great recipe.   Mindy S.

It is my first time making cinnamon buns and these are so easy(I do have a bread maker) and taste excellent!! For a minute when I was in my kitchen I thought I was at Cinnabon because of the smell of them. My daughter and I just got done eating one and she asked for another!!! They are rich but I can't believe how they taste exactly like Cinnabons!! I did lay down greased wax paper on a baking pan so they didn't stick and it worked. Thanks so much for the great recipe Marsha!!

This is the best sweet bun recipe ever.  I have made them about 5 times since February and they have turned out great every time.  I dont use a bread machine, i use a kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook. And i have decreased the flour to 4 cups or just a little more than that, I think because our the climate here. But they are great congrats to the person that developed this recipe.
Thanks

The name says it all!!  My family LOVED these.  I couldn't bring myself to tell my husband how easy these were - I want him to think these are a special treat that I spent a long time making.  We had them on Easter, my husband also had one for an afternoon snack and another for dessert after dinner.

Mmmmm...  these are really tasty!  However, I couldn't fit nearly as much flour in the dough as the recipe calls for (I made them by hand).  I also didn't need as much butter, brown sugar, or cinnamon in the filling but they were perfect anyway.  I will definitely make them again.

Wow!  I sit here with one of these cinnamon rolls by my side.  They came out just great!  I took the advice of others and baked at a lower temp, I used 385 and let them go for 20 minutes.  Perfect.  Next time I'm going to toast some chopped pecans and add them with the brown sugar/cinnamon mix.  Anyone know how many WW points to these?  :)

Oo-ey, goo-ey delicious.  These are definately a good cinnamon roll to make.  I had such an easy time.  The consistency of the dough was perfect to work with.  My husband said they were a little too heavy.  Now this could be because he does not know that cinnabons usually are very doughy and heavy-ish, or it could be that they are a bit doughy maybe from baking them on a baking stone.  Who knows. Anyway, delicious!

These rolls are really good.  They're easy to make, but took a little time.  The rolls in the middle of the pan were a little gooey -- the next time I make them I'll try spacing them apart on a large cookie sheet so they bake individually & more evenly.  Also, I'll cut down on the amount of butter -- way too much guilt!  Lastly, I think half of the icing recipe would be enough.

These were delicious - I even made them the "old-fashioned" way - not
in the bread maker.  Anyway, the icing is what makes these so scrumptious.
I WAS wondering about the 2-1/2 TABLESPOONS of cinnamon in the filling
too - I thought that was excessive - next time I think I'll try 2-1/2 
TEASPOONS???  Thanks for the recipe - I will make these many, many
more times!

Whenever we go to the mall my husband just HAS to stop for a Cinnabon.....well, not anymore! The first time I made them he said they "looked professional", and they really did!! My favorite part?  The cream cheese frosting! The recipe does make a LOT, so I usually end up making the Soft Mall Pretzels (another of my hubby's favorites) soon after sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar to use up the extra frosting.  MmmMMmmMMMmm, it's SOoooo good!!! :)

These cinnamon rolls are great.  The middle ones were a big gooey so I might try baking them for longer at a bit lower temp so they don't get too brown on the top.

Excellent flavor, texture and taste!  I have tried these twice and the second time, I used half the butter in the dough and I also spread less on the outside before rolling and the flavor was just as good!!  I've made tons of cinnamon rolls and these are great all the way!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I have never made cinnamon rolls before and these really turned out tasty. The taste of these rolls certainly came very close to that of a real cinnabon. I don't think I let my rise enough though because I expected a fluffier, lighter roll. Using dental floss to cut these worked so well! And watch them as they bake because they will burn easily. I lined my pan with greased wax paper and that seemed to work well. My husband really liked these. Thanks for the recipe!

I have a recipe for cinnamon rolls using a hot roll mix that everyone typically raves over.  For Christmas this year, I made my "usual" for my best friend and her family and this recipe for my family.  I don't think I'll EVER go back!  These are the BEST cinnamon rolls.  Yes, they are time-consuming, but it doesn't say quick rolls!  These are SO delicious... we highly recommend them!!!

These are delicious and using the bread machine makes them so easy.  The cream cheese frosting is the best!  I would reccomend making these early in the day or early afternoon though, as the dough cycle on my machine takes 1 1/2 hrs, then for the dough to raise (once before rolling out and again after cutting them) took an add'l hour or so.  I have made them 4 times within a month and everyone loves them. So much for my New Year's diet plan.  These are my little "treat" once in a while.

Good tasting, however it was not like Cinnabon.
Use caution when baking. Can burn easy.

We tried a couple of different recipes for cinnamon buns in the bread machine. This one was by far the best. We increased the filling size though and added the raisins. It was given to our friends and neighbours for brunch on New Years Day and was a great hit!!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe. :)

When I made these for Christmas morning my brother did not beleave me that I made them my self. I had to show him the printed out card just to prove to him that I didn't buy them. Then I had to make another batch for everyone to take home.  Good thing it is as easy as it is delicious!!!  YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THIS!!!!!!

These are the BEST homemade cinnamon rolls ever!  Perhaps the person who submitted the poor review on 02/19/02 is not a very good baker, or made in error while baking them because the recipe is easy and results in an excellent cinnamon roll.  My hat is off to the chef on this one!

I've made these over and over (and over) over the last year.  I don't have a bread machine, either.  What I did was buy the frozen bread dough (they also make a frozen sweet bread dough, which is better, but my store stopped carrying it).  2 loaves = this recipe.  I defrost the dough in the microwave and continue with the recipe.  Saves time, because, yes, they should be served warm, and making them the night before isn't an option.  Love them...Thanks!

What can I say that everyone else hasn't?  These are simply EXCELLENT.  Sometimes I'm a little leary about trying recipes that have so many glowing reviews..don't ask me why...but these were everything everyone said they were.  Think I'll use the dough recipe and try making some caramel rolls tomorrow -but it would be hard to beat these rolls as they are!

I just tried the icing recipe for this for the cinnamon bread recipe also listed on this site.  A wonderful icing recipe!  Very creamy and not too sweet.  The cream cheese adds a really nice flavor and consistency.

I have been looking for a "Cinnabon" clone for some time and tried several recipes on my family.  This one won the grand prize!  Everything about this recipe is great; ingredients you have in the house, easy to make, quick (for yeast breads), and absolutely delicious.  My kids (age 22 to 46) love them!

Incredible!!!!  My 15 year old son made two batches of these by hand (we don't own a bread machine), to sell at his school's bake sale.  No one could believe that he made them himself, rather than purchasing them from Cinnabon.  He sold 2 dozen at $1 each, and could have sold lots more.

This is an easy recipe...The bread machine does most of the work.  You do have to wait for the dough to rise...It is worth the wait. 

One trick for cutting is to take a piece of thread or dental floss and wrap around the roll..hold each end of the floss ..criss cross the thread and pull until the dough is sliced.

These were excellent and so easy to make!  I didn't have bread flour and they came out great with all purpose flour. The dough is so easy to work with and cutting them with dental floss makes perfect slices. My kids thought they died and went to heaven when they woke up to these for breakfast.  Thanks for the new family favorite recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the amount of cream cheese in the frosting.  I also put the cream cheese & butter in the microwave for 15 seconds before mixing and put the frosting in the refrigerator while the rolls were rising.  I didn't have a bread machine, so I did everything by hand and it came out great.  (I checked the breadworld website by fleischmann’s yeast for good tips about baking with yeast).

Thank you, Marsha!!  This was my first time making anything with yeast.  I was a little nervous, but they turned out great!  I will make these often.  I'll probably give them out as gifts this Christmas.  I doubled the icing and I felt it was too much.  The recipe is perfect!

These came out great and my family really enjoyed them. They are addicted to Cinnabon and were impressed by this home-made version.  I don't have a bread machine so had to fudge some of the earlier steps - I only used one pkge of yeast and it was fine.

These are GREAT!!!  I tested them on a bunch of folks and noone could believe that they hadn't come from Cinnabon!!  One person even said that they were better, because sometimes the originals don't seemed completely baked.  I will definitely make these many times!!

YUM.  The cream cheese frosting is what really gives it that Cinnabon flavor, and the brown sugar/cinnamon filling.  Our 11-year old daughter made these and they were delicious.  Thank you to the person who invented the bread machine!  There is virtually no mess involved except for when you turn the dough out onto the floured surface.  CHANGES TO THE RECIPE:  Next time I will add an additional 5 minutes, at least, to the baking time.  The middle cinnamon rolls were doughy.  HELPFUL HINT:  Use dental floss to cut your rolls, they come out beautifully!  Slide the floss under the dough and criss-cross it to make the cut.

My family went crazy over this recipe! I am so relieved that I no longer have to drop ten bucks for 4 Cinnabons!  I prepared them the night before and baked them the next morning. They tasted even better on days two and three! This will be my new showstopper recipe for Christmas morning!  Thank you!!!!!!!

YUM! YUM! YUM! :)  I love you!  These taste just like the ones you buy in the mall back home...and believe me that's a wonderful thing for a girl who moved from the states to Scotland.  I missed being able to buy these, but now I can make them when I get homesick!  My sister-in-law said they were absolutely scrummy!   That's a very high compliment!  Thank you for this recipe.

I married into an Italian family, and they apparently had never had anything this moist and good. I am now required to bring these everytime I enter into their homes. They don't even let me cut them, they just pick them out of the pan! They turn them into savages!

Right out of the oven these are SO good! Leftover, they're still good but not near as good as when they're fresh. And I followed the tip to make sure that the dough had enough time to rise and it took a long time but was so worth it!
