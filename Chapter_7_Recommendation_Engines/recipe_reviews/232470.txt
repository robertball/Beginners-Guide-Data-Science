good and easy to do!
 on a side note, you should never add salt to marinades because it pulls moisture out of the meat.

This was a very nice "last minute" chicken marinade.  I appreciate that this only needs an hour of marinating time since it can be marinated after work, but before dinner.  The lemon flavor is strong, giving it a nice tang.  Mr. LTH grilled our BLSL chicken breasts which worked nicely with this marinade.  THANKS for the recipe!

Great recipe! Added lemon zest instead of lemon juice to recipe. Marinated one hour added juice from one small lemon right before I grilled chicken.

I used bottled lemon juice because I didn't have fresh lemons.  The recipe calls for juice from a fresh lemon so if you use bottled lemon juice, cut back by at least half.  My fish ended up very, very lemony but I did not decrease the amount of bottled lemon juice from the original amount called for in the recipe.  Even so, I think the recipe still needs something else to offset the lemon flavor.  Next time I think I will add black pepper or ginger to add another dimension to the flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy and uses things I always have on hand already. I’ve made this a couple times and have added a teaspoon of pesto a few times for a different flavor. You could cut the lemon down if you aren’t as big a fan— it’s pretty strong but we like it!

Excellent summer marinade for grilling chicken. Easy to put together. I used Dijon mustard, pounded my chicken breasts, marinaded in frig for about 5 hours and grilled. Served with brown rice and sautéed zucchini/onions.

This wasn’t bad but well with all the ingredients the only thing you could taste was the lemon juice. I even doubled the garlic and made the marinade 15 hours to let it meld all flavors before using it so it was ready when I got home from work. Probably not a repeat although I think it would be a good addition to lemon spaghetti from this site.

I have made this recipe over and over again.  I have used it as a vinaigrette dressing for salads as well.  Great for marinated chicken skewers for the barbecue.

Not a fan. Made the chicken way too tangy/sour.

I made as directed and was pretty much what I expected. I marinated my chicken breasts for about 3 hours then grilled them on the BBQ. Nothing special but not bad either. I will make these again when looking for simple flavors but I don’t love chicken so I’m usually looking for something with bolder flavors.

Most of the family liked it.  My picky kids said the lemon was too strong, next time I'll halve the lemon juice as recommended by others.  Wonderfully juicy results

This is the best marinade I've ever made!!!  Guests rave over my chicken when I use this and always ask for the recipe. 
Note that this is a good amount for about 8 pieces of chicken.  It can get wayyyy too lemony if you use less, so halve the recipe if necessary.  I usually use lemon juice from the bottle which is stronger too.  As well, I find defrosted chicken that is less watery makes the recipe more flavorful.   Enjoy!!!

Was good, but too much oregano, in the future I'll reduce the amount and it was about bland, so I added some salt (not much, as it will suck the moisture out of your meat!

This chicken marinade was easy and the chicken came out moist, but way too lemony.  Unfortunately, the guest of honor couldn't even eat it.  If I ever tried this recipe again, I would cut back to 1 lemon.

The recipe was good, but it didn't include any salt or pepper so I added both just before the chicken was finished cooking. Next time I will add salt and pepper to the marinade and marinate it several hours.
