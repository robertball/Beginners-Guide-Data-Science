I really liked these muffins. I used soy yogurt and soy milk. I didn't have any self-rising flour so I used all-purpose flour and added 3 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. They raised great! These are not the sweetest muffins but I thought it was amazing how the srawberry yogurt really did give them a nice hint of strawberry even with the small amount called for. This is also a great way to use up those leftover holiday sprinkles. Mine melted and you couldn't tell I used Turkey shaped sprinkles.:) Also a big hit with the kids. This is a keeper!

Very good and fun for kids. My granddaughter and I made them for a project she had with her 5th grade class. She got an A and all the muffins were eaten. However we deleted about 1T of flour added 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 cup and mixed chocolage chips with the white. They were not only good but the different color sprinkles made them a big hit!

I was trying to give it 3 and 1/2 stars because it was really pretty. But the flavor was just "okay". If I'm going to spend time baking from scratch I want the result to be stellar! It was a good recipe for kids though- they enjoyed helping and eating:)

These were good muffins. Tasty. I made them exactly as stated and they made 10 regular sized muffins. I also topped each muffin with a few sprinkles before baking. Mine baked for about 20 minutes. Not amazing but good enough to make again.

I made these muffins in my cooking class. not only did I enjoy them but my friends in my group loved them and so did other classmates and the teacher. They are fun to make and easy. They taste great even if they have yogurt(you cant taste it).

My neighbor made these. They were wonderful!!! When I asked her for the recipe she referred me to the Allrecipes website. I should have known the recipe came from my favorite website.

I used a standard muffin pan and a medium ice cream scoop resulting in 1 dozen muffins. Rainbow Sprinkles melted but the holiday style sprinkles stayed intact. They look pretty....but that's about it.

I made these as directed and didn't add or change any of the ingredients. I took them to a BBQ and they all disappeared. I thought the muffins were good but nothing I'd make regularly for myself. They do have kid appeal though so I'll keep this recipe around.

Sprinkles yum! My 3yo loves sprinkles so much! I just had to make these for him. He was quite impressed! The muffins are not very sweet. The sprinkles and white baking chips do the trick though. They were a bit dry the next day even after storing them in an airtight container. I think if I make these again I will use fewer sprinkles and skip the white baking chips.

These are strange muffins. Very dense with an almost rubbery consistency. I was on the phone with a friend when I tried them and I told her I did not like them as I proceeded to eat half the batch.... I've since eaten the whole batch and still don't know if I like them. But I have to give them 3 stars because my daughter did like them.

10.1.19 ... Didnâ€™t expect much by reading reviews so I felt okay with making adjustments.  Vanilla yogurt, 1/2c sugar, 1/3c white chips.  My sprinkles were spoiled so no sprinkles.  Sweet-enough basic muffin.  The chips on the bottom started to burn, but not enough to affect flavor really.  Maybe sprinkles & chips on top only would be a better choice.  The photos make these look better than they are.  Break out the good jam.  :)

This was a really good muffin! I used gluten free all purpose flour 3t baking powder and 1/2t in place of the self rising flour (i've never seen self rising gf flour). I also used oil in place of butter (the dog got hungry) and cherry greek yogurt in place of strawberry (someone ate my strawberry one). I was concerned with the batter being really thick but was surprised with how light and moist these turned out. I added some extra heart sprinkles on top for Valentine's day.

I would love to give more stars but these just weren't what I expected they were way to floury if that makes any sense and didn't 'wow!' me one bit.

Maybe it's just us in this house but we didnt like these at all. They were sticky and had a weird consistency.
