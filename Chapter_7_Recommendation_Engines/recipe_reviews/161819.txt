I have not made this recipe, but I have made bacon gravy since I was big enough to stand at the stove.  I gave this a 3 star (even though I haven't made it) because the recipe is PRETTY close...but if you follow Alisha's suggestions, you will get something much closer to a smooth, rich bacon gravy.  Something my mother and grandmothers passed on to me was this (if I can word it properly!)  "Keep the numbers the same, for whatever amount of gravy you want to make.  If it's 2 Tbsp. of grease, use 2 Tbsp. of flour and 2 cups of milk."  I have always made my gravy following this rule and have NEVER had gravy that was too thick or too thin.  Also, do NOT add your milk all at once.  Add about 1/3 cup at a time and stir until smooth...and let it get warm before adding more milk.

Good starter recipe. It's important to have enough bacon to yield the amount of grease needed. 4 slices is a bit on the low side. I usually buy an entire pack of thick bacon and make it all. After it's all cooked and crisp, I mix flour into the grease little by little until it becomes pasty but not clumpy. Last, add the milk little by little stirring between each addition until the gravy reaches it's desired consistency. You have to wait inbetween each addition because the consistency of the milk will change when it is heated. Remember to crumble the bacon into the gravy BEFORE seasoning with salt and pepper. If you have not made bacon gravy before, the best thing to do is to take a few teaspoons of it out, put it in a cup, and season those few teaspoons until you like the taste... then season the whole pot until you match that desired taste. This way, you won't ruin an entire pot of gravy by overseasoning it.

The most important thing to realize about making gravy is that it's more intuitive than it is following a specific recipe.

I grew up on this!  Most people know of sausage gravy and biscuits, but I had not until I was married with children of my own and moved to North Carolina.  In my house, we always ate bacon gravy and biscuits, sometimes as an evening meal!  It is so simple and absolutely deliscious, but I would suggest that you buy lower sodium bacon, it does help cut down on the sodium count.  If you use regular bacon, make sure to add it to the gravy before you test it to season it or you will make it taste briney.  This is also deliscious served with scrambled eggs and fried potatoes.  I would suggest upping the recipe by at least double, as the suggested amounts would make a very small amount which won't serve many.  Enjoy!

I just love it how people blame the recipe giver for their inability to make gravy. Even if you had her sitting right their next to you it wouldn't guarantee that you'd be able to make it! Gravy is difficult to learn at first, but once you've learned it you never forget it. I can't tell you how many times I ended up w/ a skillet of lumpy "oatmeal" "elmers glue" etc.... It's all in the process of learning. There is no exact amount of flour, oil, or milk to put in. It's just kind of one of those eyeball things. Sure you can have a pretty good gestimation. Oh and there is no set time on how long it takes for the oil/flour to get to the right consistency,or when to remove from heat. If your new to this you're bound to end up w/ a skillet full of lumpy mush. If not way to go you mastered gravy a lot faster than most of us. So the moral of this rant is chill out peeps and quit criticizing her! I give her 5 stars for having the melons to put her recipe out there. You go girl!

Mine turned out great.  I followed the tidbit that raouglysgirl gave: "If it's 2 Tbsp. of grease, use 2 Tbsp. of flour and 2 cups of milk."  I took note to pay attention to adding the flour and milk slowly.  I used bacon grease I had reserved from cooking bacon previously which probably created greater flavor.  I wanted to mimic my grandma's recipe and it was very close.    I'll make this again.

I really wanted biscuits and gravy for dinner the other night but didn't have the sausage I normally use so I tried this recipe with bacon. I pretty much doubled all ingredients to make enough for my family. I had never made gravy from scratch before this and I found the directions simple and easy to follow. Other than accidentally over salting it a bit, it tasted delicious. I added a couple dashes of steak seasoning. Next time I will use less salt and pepper and more steak seasoning. I will 100% use this recipe over and over again. Reviewers claiming their gravy was "bland" and/or "flavorless": uh, it says season "to taste" ??? Right?!

This was really good, but I added a few things.
I made gravy as directed, but I put an egg scramble on the biscuits before I topped them with the gravy and it was SO good.  I sauteed pieces of ham, banana peppers, and red pepper flakes in butter then added the eggs.  I put the eggs on the biscuits, topped with cheddar cheese, and then topped with the gravy.  It was awesome.....

This was a horrible recipe. Following the instructions exactly, I ended up with a pan full of Elmers Glue! Slightly browned of course.

Be sure to follow Raoulysgirl's advice about the grease/flour/milk ratio, e.g., if you have 3 T of grease, you'll need 3 T of flour and 3 cups of milk.  It was perfect!

It actually was great and really easy to make. I kept adding milk until it was the consistency that I wanted. My husband loved it and since we usually cook bacon instead of sausage it was a great way to make gravy!

This was okay and I did appreciate the idea, however my gravy was lumpy when I followed the directions as cited.  I usually mix a little milk with the flour before I add it to the drippings when I make regular gravy.  I do think this is a more "by feel" recipe as others have stated. Also, make sure you have lots of grease, four strips might not be enough.

Very good. I did use extra bacon and used more flour and milk. I just eyed the flour and when it looked to be the same amount as the grease I went with it.

I used bacon grease that I had stored in my fridge. I made this to go on mashed potato bowls. Worked out ok, had enough flavor to not overpower all the other stuff in the bowl. I did use more than the 1 cup of milk called for.

I loved this gravy!  I hadn't thought about putting the grease into other gravies I'd made, but the grease definitely made the difference with this one.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

We really enjoyed this recipe!! However, I had to use almost 2 cups of milk to prevent it from being too thick. Four slices of thick center-cut bacon yielded plenty of grease for the bacon flavor. I added about a tsp of fresh cracked black pepper, and needed nearly a level tbsp of kosher salt. However, we did not crumble and incorporate the bacon - we just ate it =D I think that's why we needed a little more salt than expected. I will be making this again!!

This is a nice base for a gravy, but I would NOT use this as my gravy!! The end product is very thick and pasty and is extremely bland. I started with the fat from about 8 bacon strips, as 4 strips was not enough for my family. I ended up adding an additional cup of milk and about a 1/2 cup of butter. I also seasoned it with some onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, red pepper, some sea salt, and a lot of black pepper.

Okay, so I'm a west coast girl that married a southern boy... Before we were married, I had never made gravy (or eaten the stuff since I rarely eat animal products). I finally mastered the souther baking powder biscuit, and this gravy made him sigh with relief! He loved it, and it plated well atop the fluffy biscuits that I made! I could not think of a way to change it for my southern boy! It has everything that a biscuit gravy needs... The bacon bits to add sustenance, a creamy body, and a simple flavor. I did add freshly ground pepper (a must, never use the pre-ground stuff) and a tad bit of paprika--about 1/4 teaspoon. Otherwise, what a great and simple recipe. Thank you Nikki for this recipe, my southern mother-in-law is jealous and that woman breaths bacon!

This recipe is excellent!  I browned the flour/grease mixture like other reviewers said and I slowly mixed in the milk.  It needed a bit of salt and pepper and a little garlic powder, but it has amazing flavor.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

I was raised on bacon gravy and give this recipe 3 stars only because of 2 things..you will need more bacon to create enough grease for this recipe and the most important part has been omitted.. BROWN THE FLOUR GREASE MIXTURE BEFORE ADDING YOUR MILK...any country cook knows the secret to good pan gravy is to brown the flour :) Bacon gravy is so much better than sausage gravy and the reason you never ever throw out bacon grease :))

This came out really well, I've made biscuit and gravy in the past this was the first time I ever made bacon gravy. I had to add a lot of extra milk and stirred so it would not turn out like Elmers glue. Next time I have it I think I will add some spices and possibly some better Bacon.

I made this just as the recipe called for. It sure brought back memories... tasty stuff, and I tried to make it a tiny bit healthier by using 1% milk. I'll make this again, although I hate to admit I might add a touch of salt next time.

This is the perfect way to make bacon and sausage gravy.  Some meats are pretty lean though so you do need to make sure there is enough fat to match your flour, tbsp to tbsp.  This is THE GRAVY recipe.  Occasionally I add a tsp of sugar to change it up a little, other than that, this is the only country gravy recipe I ever use. In the cases where there may not be enough drippings just add the appropriate amount of butter (not margarine-EVER). I always use a fork for the stirring but a whisk is the best tool.  It does require a lot of whisking and make sure you cook the flour for about 2 minutes prior to slowly whisking in your milk.

I didn't really change anything per se, but I did have to add a wee bit more flour and milk to account for the amount of bacon grease I had.  We used a cheaper fattier bacon and so it made a lot of grease.  Other than that, I didn't change anything.  It was delicious.

Good concept, but the preportions are off....if you use 3 Tbsp bacon drippings, 3 Tbsp flour and 3 cups of milk, you'll get a good gravy consistancy....BUT...you have to add the milk gradually, about 1/3 cup at a time and stir it constantly over a med to low heat. You can increase or decrease the amount of gravy you need, but keep your preportions equal....Ex. 4 Tbsp bacon Drippins, 4 Tbsp flour, 4 cups milk, etc....  Hope this helps!

I followed the advice of raouglysgirl and it turned out excellent. Kellylee you added the milk too slowly or not enough. I find if you pour the milk continuously and slow while whisking, it smoothes the lumps and doesn't turn to glue. I also added the bacon back in as soon as it returned to a simmer.

My husband loves bacon, he is one of those people who think bacon makes everything better.  I made this for his birthday breakfast using a peppered bacon, and there was not a drop leftover.

For an unusual treat try this over field ripe cantaloupe that has been cleaned and chilled. Yes, my wife laughed at me in 1953 when I asked for her to make this meal. Make sure you find ripe melons that junk in the store that taste like cucumbers is not good.

I did the recipe exactly and I too ended up with something that looked like oatmeal.  I will try one more time taking the advice of others and slowly pour milk in and flour and too keep pouring milk until you get the consistency you like.  Also, I will reduce the amount of flour as suggested by some.    This is a starter but definitely not exact way of making it.

This is identical to the gravy I make using either bacon or breakfast sausage, crumbled except instead of milk I use half and half. It may have a few more calories but we're talking breakfast here.

This is a great and simple recipe. For those who had lumps you have to wisp wisp wisp. Make sure your heat is warm enough . Browning the flour is a good thing. This is how grandma made breakfast gravy. My favorite.

As is, the recipe is bland and way too thick. Many of the suggestions below hold true for any good gravy, particularly about having the same numbers for your proportions: your drippings and flour should be exactly the same amount, so as to make a proper roux, and the milk should be incorporated slowly, in small batches. Remember too that you should shoot for a consistency slightly thinner than what you want your end result to be, as it will thicken a bit on standing.

I really liked this recipe.  It had plenty of flavor and was perfect with biscuits.  Mine came out a little on the thick side and I would prefer to add a little milk to thin it down.  Thanks for submitting this easy and delicious recipe!

I love biscuits and gravy.  I grew up in the South and had biscuits and gravy almost every morning for breakfast.  This recipe is the same basic recipe that my grandmother made.  The only thing that is amiss with this is the amount of servings.  Although the recipe says it will serve four..... I ate the whole thing myself!!

PHENOMENAL!  The best biscuit gravy I've ever had!  An awesome alternative to Sausage gravy for those who prefer bacon.

I slmost made it too salty because I salted and tasted before I added the crumbled bacon back in.  I would highly recommend adding the bacon back in before seasoning!

This is a good starting place for people that don't have experience making it. After making it a few times you won't really measure the ingredients but learn to go by the consistency. This way you can make the right amount based on how much bacon grease you have left over.

Way too much flour.  I started out with less than 1/4 cup because it just seemed like too much with the amount of milk.  Ended up having to add even more milk to make it right.  Tastes great though once the adjusting is done!

The milk amount is really low. I ended up having to add an additional 3 cups because the gravy became a paste. Maybe if it was 1 tbsp of flour it would work, then it would be 1 or 2 servings. The flavor is great though.

While visiting my daughter in Mexico she requested biscuits & gravy. We couldn't find sausage so ended up making bacon gravy. It was good but it wasn't sausage gravy but it WAS a great stand-in! Easy to follow instructions and tasty. Would make again!

I have never made gravy before and mine tasted fantastic! I used gluten free flour so I don't know if that changed the consistency. I ended up with a pudding consistency so I just kept adding milk until it looked and felt like gravy. I crumbled 2 slices of bacon into it, some salt and a bunch of pepper. It was amazing! I really liked that the recipe was so basic and gave me less milk than I needed. There has been so many recipes that tell you a certain amount and things turn out runny and all messed up. High Five for the person who posted this! It was perfect for 2 people.

This recipe is REALLY thick. I doubled the milk and it was still too thick. It was my first time making gravy and was a good starter recipe for me to figure out how to make it better with some tweaking.

Loved it! I was not making bacon but I keep my left over grease in a jar. I used 2 table spoons of grease and continued with the recipe. I seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder, and everglades seasoning. Quick & Easy. I will definitely be making this again.

I forgot to get sausage and I had bacon so thought I would try this. I thought it was OK not bad not great. I do always use a few pieces of bacon in my gravy if I have it along with my sausage but for our family bacon alone just was not flavorful enough.  I guess we just got used to a combination gravy :) Try combining them I like I, you might like it.

This was such an easy gravy recipe! I did use an extra slice of bacon since ours weren't so thick, and since I can't have dairy I used cashew milk. The result was delicious, I'll just be sure to spice it up next time using crushed red pepper flakes. I'll definitely be making it again soon.

I made biscuits the other day and have been lazy just smothering them with honey. Had some bacon lying around and wondered if bacon gravy was feasible. I've never made gravy before. Weird things happen when you first add the milk. Keep adding a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency. The gravy yielded was alright. I'll eat it but probably won't make it again.

I thought this was pretty good. I am from the South and I have never had this anywhere, I wonder if it is a dish that is found in a specific region. Anywho, as I said, I thought is was decent, if you like salty dishes this will be right up your alley.

I pretty much doubled the amount of everything, used 7 slices of thick cut bacon. It was a little thick so I added about half a cup of Pepperidge Farm Chicken Gravy (had it in the fridge) more milk as needed. Also, lots of black pepper and onion powder, about a few pinches of seasoned salt. Good over Bisquick Bisquits and left over fried chicken, server with steamemed peas.

I admit that the first time I heard of this was when I was dating my husband, who grew up in Michigan but with southern roots, I thought he was CRAZY.
I tried and tried to make it for him, without success, until one of his cousins, as a joke (making fun of this northerner) sent me an audio tape (it was 1972) but as he went step by step, for the first time it all made sense.
I drain all but 2 - 3 T of the bacon grease and add about equal amounts of flour. Stir it to a smooth paste (I like to let mine just start to get a very light tan color) long enough to cook the "raw" taste out of the flour. (if you don't have quite enough bacon grease, for the times I use the saved grease .... I stir in just a bit of butter) Add the milk slowly, while stirring, and let it cook to thicken. If it gets too thick... stir in a little more milk ... if it is too thin, just cook it a little longer while stirring. 
It takes a little practice, and gets to be easier as you just learn the "feel" for it!
I  said I thought he was crazy???? It didn't take me long to fight him for my fair share!!!
Now I am hungry... off to make some eggs and gravy!!!

I'm a yankee girl and don't know much about biscuits and gravy, but this recipe was easy, tasty, and no where near as salty-tasting as I was anticipating. I used five thin slices of bacon that produced a lot of grease. After removing the bacon, I turned off the heat, gradually added the flour, then started the heat up again as I added the cold milk (I eyeballed the milk, not sure if I used more or less than a cup, just watched for the gravy to lighten in color and reach the appropriate thickness). I had accidentally let the bacon cook a little long and worried that it might taste a bit burnt, but it didn't! Used Anne's Baking Powder Biscuits I recipe from this website because of the (lack of) ingredients I had on hand. Though not necessarily a "traditional" southern breakfast, it was still tasty and my Texas-raised partner was satisfied.

this reminds me of my father in laws gravy, even though he does it quite differently. i've made this several times, if you follow the recipe exactly your gravy will turn out with a nice consistency, if you are like me and add extra bacon it might not from too much grease. If you like it thinner, add more milk because it thickens up pretty quick. nice, simple, and just what i had been searching for, thank you

This is my FAVORITE gravy recipe.  Great as is, but even better if you add a little Cajun seasoning for a kick!  I usually use about twice as much bacon, and eyeball the milk to get the perfect consistency.  Always better to start with less, and thin down if needed.

One thing that helps with this and other milk gravies, is to take the chill off the milk, by letting it set out while cooking the bacon and preping the rest of ingedients.  Or when browning the flour put milk in microwave for 2-3 minutes, cooking the flour for at least that long, the more you cook it the more the flour taste goes away.  Having the milk teepeed (sp) or slightly warm helps keep the flour from getting lumpy.  I use 1 1/2 tbls of fat and flour for every cup of liquid.

No good.  The flavor was there, but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very solid- not runny at all.  I think at some point this recipe needs to state when to remove from heat.  Once I added the milk it reduced down quickly and became more solid- consistency of mash potatoes.  I think next time I will remove from heat THEN whisk in milk.

This recipe was ok, I'm going to try again with some tweaks. I followed the recipe to the letter and was left with a gravy that had a grainy consistency because of the flour. I'm going to try mixing the flour in with some milk before I add it next time.

I really wanted to like this because my family loves sausage gravy and we love bacon. But we did not care for this at all. The gravy itself was not flavorful and adding the bacon bits just made it very salty overall without adding much flavor. When adjusting the seasoning, taste spoonfuls WITH the bacon, not just the gravy, because the bacon has a huge effect on the overall saltiness. I used 2 T. fat, 2 T. flour and about 1.5 cups skim milk to achieve the right consistency. Let gravy "simmer" between stirring to get it to thicken up. I was hoping to get more flavor payoff for the fat+salt price you pay with this recipe. We would have preferred eating our bacon and biscuits solo (more flavor, less trouble and mess). It's a fun idea but didn't work for us.

I read the reviews and made some modifications.  I used an entire package of bacon and followed the recipe from there on out it still had no flavor.

A very good, basic recipe for bacon gravy. I've even had to make it with half the bacon when we've run out, and it still turns out well!
