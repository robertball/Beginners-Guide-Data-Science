Nearly perfect--I substituted sour cream for the yogurt and added 1 tsp. vanilla. I kept all else the same. No doubt it's a pretty muffin with a very attractive and tasty topping and just the right amount of sweetness. However, unless you're a big fan of nutmeg, either reduce the amount to a mere dash or eliminate it altogether--I tasted it a little more than I liked and found it distracting. At the same time, I found the rhubarb a little lacking, so I would definitely recommend increasing it to 1-1/2 cups.

I am really impressed with this recipe.  I love the yogurt in the mix, I used strawberry and plain yogurt instead of Vanilla and I also used half whole wheat flour with a bit of flax seed to make them a bit healthier.  They taste great, the topping makes it really nice also.  Yummy!

Loved eating and making these muffins. Very tasty and moist. I did not have vanilla yogert so I used sour cream and vanilla extract and also added 1 1/2 rhubarb and used less sugar. Turned out great. Will make these again!!!!

Mmmmm!!!  I followed the whole-wheat flour suggestion (substituting the full amount of all-purpose for whole wheat flour) for a healthier kick.  Also added about five blueberries to each muffin after the batter had been spooned into the tin, and before the topping was added.

Really good.  To make them a bit healthier, I left the topping out, adding the spices in with the dry, and I subbed whole wheat flour for white.  They turned out lovely, light and tasty.  I left my rhubarb peices too big and some bites are quite tart, so I would reccomend a fine dice.

I guess I'm just echoing a lot of the previous praise, but I really liked these muffins. Like several other reviewers, I tried to make them more healthful. I used all whole-wheat flour (I'm usually leery of doing this; in general, I replace only half or a little more of the amount of white flour with whole wheat. But I used white whole wheat; maybe that made a difference.) I also skipped the topping, but included the cinnamon & nutmeg in the dry ingredients. And I did 3T of canola oil & only 1T of butter. The only change I'd consider next time is in the spices: I thought the nutmeg flavor was a little too strong, so I think next time I'll cut it back a little. If it still needs tweaking, I might increase the cinnamon. Also, be prepared for very dry batter--I would have been nervous about that if I hadn't already read here about it. I will definitely make these again. My kids loved them too.

These are the muffins I've been looking for!  Light, fluffy, tons of flavor, sweet enough to compensate for tangy rhubarb & the topping is awsome!  Baked up nice and big.  Looking forward to trying with apples or cranberries as well!  Also, didn't use muffin tin liners, just sprayed tins with Pam and the came out really nice.  Also used another reviewers advice and used 1/2 c sour cream and tsp vanilla instead of yogurt.

These muffins are very moist, tender, and delicious. I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour, which gave more of a hearty, nutty, whole-grain flavor. I diced the rhubarb fairly finely, maybe 1/4" pieces, and it sort of melted into the muffins. I might make the pieces larger next time, since I like discernible pieces of fruit in my muffins.

lovely muffin. great texture and delicate flavor.  next time i will double the topping recipe, which i ran out of before the end so i left a couple bald, but still very good.

i also plan to greatly increase the  rhubarb next time, which means i'll have to add more sugar.

These are very yummy muffins as far as muffins go, and I like that you can use notfat yogurt to keep them relatively healthy.  However, I love my rhubarb and try to use it in the ways that I will be able to most appreciate it, and this is not one of them.  These muffins are not very rhubarb-y -- they are lacking the kick that I expect from rhubarb.

My husband had been begging me to make something with our frozen rhubarb from this summer so I found this recipe.  He LOVED them as did his brother, both pretty hard to please.  I used oats for the topping instead of almonds and dark brown sugar.  The tartness of the rhubarb with the spices almost tasted like cider to me.  Perfect for cooler weather!

Fantastic! Following the comments of others, I substituted sour cream + 1 tsp vanilla for the vanilla yogurt. I decreased the brown sugar a little (I used dark brown.), and increased the rhubarb to 1 1/2 cups. (2 stalks makes 1 1/2 cups about 1/2" dice.) I did not find the nutmeg overpowering, and I even used freshly grated which usually packs more of a punch. The batter was a little stiff, so I added a couple TBs of milk. Worked fine. The rhubarb melts into a very light, delicate muffin that is not too sweet. I will be making these often.

These are great!  I substituted applesauce for the 2tbsp oil and had no problems.  I skipped the topping because I didn't want the extra sugar.  I love these!  Next time, I will probably use extra rhubarb.

Very good.  I used 2 cups rhubarb because I thought it was going to be too dry.  Great way to use up the extra rhubarb.

Love these muffins. It was nice to do something other than pie or crisp with our rhubarb. The only thing I did different was add more rhubarb (because I had a little more than needed) and I didn't do the topping. Will definitely make again!

We used frozen rhubarb that was thawed and squeezed. Increased to 1 1/2c. Omitted butter in topping and omitted nutmeg. Very good muffins! We would definitely make again, especially to use up the frozen rhubarb in the freezer!

I finished eating one of these and it moved me to put in a good word.  I doubled the ruhbarb which came out of my freezer from last summer and I substituted vanilla almond milk and vegetable based margarine and egg replacer to make it vegan.  Came out great.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent, although like many others I added and changed some things. The topping isn't necessary at all as the muffins are plenty sweet on their own. I doubled the rhubarb and think I could still have put more in, I also added 1/2 cup of strawberries. My husband said he has a new favorite.

I did not have the yogurt so I made these with sour cream instead. Instead of the almonds I used oats in the topping. Turned out good. Since I am the only one in the house who is big rhubarb fan it is nice they are individual so I can freeze some.

A very tasty recipe and a great way to use up the huge amount of rhubarb I had!  I like that it's not too sweet and relatively healthy with the limited fat and when substituting WW pastry flour.  I was too short on prep. time to make it into muffins, so I made a triple batch and made it into 2 generous loaves (baking time about 60-75 minutes for the loaves).  A few modifications to the single recipe that tasted great:  *Took other reviewers' advice and reduced nutmeg by half *Used all whole wheat pastry flour *Increased to 1 1/2 c rhubarb *Added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to batter. Kept streusel cinnamon as printed in recipe. *Reduced brown sugar in streusel to 2 1/2 Tbsp  *I used all canola oil in the muffin/bread part and then butter just for the streusel.  This is a keeper!

lovely muffins. I doubled the amount of rhubarb and added chocolate chips!  For a low fat version, you can leave out the butter and vegetable oil and add one banana and egg substitute. My kids gobbled them up!

Oh, yum! These are so moist and delicious. As suggested by others, I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, added the spices and almonds to the batter and didn't make the topping, and since I didn't have vanilla yogurt, I simply used plain yogurt and added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. What a great recipe!

Loved it.  I made changes to make them a little healthier and Gluten Friendly.  I used cup for cup Namaste Gluten Free Flour and subbed un-sweetened applesauce for the butter and oil.  I also left off the topping and added cinnamon and allspice in the batter.  Very light and moist muffins!

I had to review these.  I made these last night and they are amazing!  I was worried my expectations were too high from the reviews but they are to die for.  I have already shared this recipe with 5 people and said "you HAVE to make these"  they are little pieces of heaven and probably the only recipe I have ever not modified at all

This is a delicious and easy recipe. I changed it slightly only because what I happened to have in the house was a large container of dannon blended strawberry yogurt. I made a double recipe and used the strawberry yogurt and these are scrumptious!!

I agree that a few blueberries in each is a good addition.  Really, really delicious.  Is three too many to eat with dinner?

Excellent muffins.  I did half whole wheat flour and half white flour, plus I added a little milled flax seed and they turned out great.  Nice texture and taste.

I tried this recipe for the first time about 4 days ago, and am making it for the 4th time now!
I live in the UK, we  don't get vanilla yoghurt, so I've used whatever I had on hand - toffee, strawberry and peach yoghurts. I used ground almonds for the topping, which was really nice. I will definitely keep on making these muffins.

Absolutely FABULOUS! I used vanilla pear yogurt and walnuts instead of almonds and they are WONDERFUL!! My husband is not a muffin kind-of-guy and he had 5 of the first 12 I made!! They were so good I had to make a second batch right away! This is going in my "KEEP" file!

After reading the reveiws and deciding to do as others had done, add extra rhubarab, cut the sugar and swap WW flour I whipped up a batch.  These did not make the cut in my house.  Excrutiatingly bland, even my hubby who eats and raves about anything I make, made a face when he ate these.  Waste not want not, we ate them but would not make them again.  On the plus side, they were a tender, moist muffin.

I usually loathe rhubarb! So, I was more than disappointed when it showed up in my weekly produce delivery.  Fighting the temptation to just dump it in the green bin, I searched high and low for a recipe that was not too complicated but would have decent results.  Fortunately, I found this recipe which is not only forgiving (I only had brown sugar) but also yielded some tasty muffins.

Wonderful recipe, I used fresh rhubarb and substituted vanilla yogurt for strawberry yogurt.  I also doubled the recipe and it turned out fine.  Only suggestion would be to not overfill the muffin cups or the muffins will not rise to a nice domed top.  Thanks!

These are very good.  I did substitute sour cream for the yogurt and it worked fine.   Very good flavor. We really enjoyed these.  Made with fresh rhubarb.   Would recommend this  recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I made these last night and was pleasantly surprised despite my super thick batter. I did make some changes which could have been the reason behind my thick batter. I used all whole wheat flour, substituted applesauce for both the butter and oil and used half vanilla yogurt and half sour cream (only because I didn't have enough yogurt). I also only had 1/2 of brown sugar on hand (I guess I need to go grocery shopping!). I used about 1 1/2 cups of rhubarb and omitted the brown sugar topping but put the spices (I actually used "apple pie spice") in the batter. I added a splash of skim milk so I could get all the dry ingredients mixed in. These are super moist and I love the tangy sweet flavor the rhubarb gives them. Some reviewers said they didn't care for the rhubarb "melting" into the muffins, but I thought it was fantastic! My husband was bummed I used up all the rhubarb and is insisting we get more this weekend so I can make these again!

I doubled the recipe and got 18 medium to large muffins. I omitted the butter, halved the sugar, substituted whole wheat flour, used 3 cups rhubarb and just sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar instead of the topping, I don't like nutmeg and no nuts at school, well at least not the edible kind ;) Very tasty and not as tart as I thought they would be, very moist from the yogurt. Will definitely make again now that I have 5 rhubarb plants!

Pretty good.  I was a little worried because the mix was pretty stiff, but they came out nice and light.  Next time I think I will use whole wheat flour for a bit more flavour. I also followed what some people did which was add some blueberries - which was good advice.

Yummy!  I was afraid that these would lose the tartness of rhubarb, but they worked out beautifully.  I didn't have vanilla yogurt, so I used plain yogurt with vanilla extract which was perfect.

What a great surprise! The batter seemed really dry and hard to mix together, however as soon as I added my frozen rhubarb it seemed to gel together. I skipped the topping part of the recipe and only used sunflower oil, no melted butter. I couldn't believe in when these muffins came out light fluffy and beautiful from my oven. One of my best Sunday brunches yet with these and wild boar sausages from the local farmer's market. I encourage anyone to try this easy & delicious recipe!

This is an excellent, moist muffin.  I doubled the recipe and it made 23 large muffins.   My rhubarb was thinly sliced, and maybe slightly more than called for.    I used a little more butter for the topping and omitted the nutmeg.

Very very nice muffins. Light, moist texture. Not overpowering flavour. I used demerrara brown sugar and greek yogurt. Added a bit of milk to thin it out. I used 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 plus 1/3 cup whole wheat flour. Fresh rhubarb. Added cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients. Used chopped natural almonds in the topping. I will definitely make these again. It made 9 decent sized muffins for me. They rise in the baking. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I used other’s suggestions of sour cream with vanilla extract instead of the yogurt, plus only half the nutmeg. So happy to have another recipe for rhubarb season! We are sharing these at my 5th grade daughter’s end of school breakfast tomorrow. I’m sure they will be a hit.

I made this recipe as stated, and these muffins are delicious.  In So Calif, rhubarb is not too plentious (weather is too warm for growing), and it can be expensive at the supermarket? Last year I froze a couple of cups of diced rhubarb that was leftover after making a rhubarb pie.  I drained the frozen rhubarb, and it was perfect for adding to the muffin batter.  On going, when making rhubarb pie I’ll be sure to save and freeze two cups of rhubarb, so I can make these muffins again.

Delicious! Tangy yet not too much so. Moist, spiced just right  - they're a treat.

I doubled the recipe and used half whole wheat flour.  The dough was sooooo dense I could hardly stir, so I added a tablespoon or 2 of water.  I was worried it wouldn't rise, but it did and the muffins turned out delicious!  Everyone loved them.  I would make more of the yummy almond topping next time, that was so good (I used slivered almonds).

I've used this recipe before, this time I had to make several substitutions as I didn't have everything. I used sweetener for most of the sugar, raspberry yogurt (all I had), I used vanilla extract as well and substituted oats for almonds. They smell and taste delicious.

I didn’t have yogurt so used raspberry Greek yogurt and 1 teaspoon vanilla and substituted 1/2 c wheat flour for white. I’m surprised how moist and fluffy they came out even with those changes.  I would omit the nutmeg next time.  Otherwise delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

Super moist and delicious! I also used plain yogurt and added a teaspoon of vanilla. For the topping I didn’t have any almonds so used a slightly smaller amount of oatmeal  and it worked fine.

The way this was written with only the yogurt, egg, butter, and oil as "liquids", there wasn't enough liquids.  The batters was super thick like cement.  I didn't see anyone else comment on this. So, I added 1/4 cup of milk, and that seemed to help the batter consistency. I still cooked them the regular time, and they seem to be ok.  Maybe something was omitted?

I also increased the rhubarb to 11/2 cups and used sour cream instead of yogurt. These were awesome.  Maybe next time I’ll add more of the crumble topping tho. 
A keeper recipe.

Delicious! I used plain Greek yogurt plus 1 tsp vanilla. The batter was super dry so I added another 3 tsp of yogurt and it was perfect. Also, as many others did, I omitted the nutmeg and added the dry topping ingredients to the batter. Next time I’m going to try adding a bit more rhubarb.

I've never cooked with rhubarb before - so when I received some in my CSA box I decided to try this recipe.  I took one reviewer's suggestion to add 1/2 cup more rhubarb - I could have probably added a bit more as well.  Mixture seemed a bit dry so I added a bit more yogurt.  Added cardamom to the topping because I like cardamom.  Very moist muffins - will definitely make again.

I made these for breakfast this morning. My mom is from a not so tech savvy generation, and this is the first thing I've ever made that she said "go rate it. 5/5 stars!" Very good recipe. I added about 1/3 cup extra rhubarb and used sour cream with a pump of vanilla coffee syrup because I didn't have any yogurt. I also added about 1/8th cup flour and 1/8th cup rolled oats (I eyeballed it) to make the topping a bit more crumbly. They turned out perfectly!

These are very good.  I had my doubts because the batter was more like bread dough than muffin batter before I added the rhubarb.  I can't imagine adding extra rhubarb as suggested by many reviewers.  The 1 cup was definitely plenty!

I substituted dehydrated Rhubarb for Fresh Rhubarb and increased the yogurt.  Also doubled the recipe to make 12 large muffins.   Turned out spectacular.  Incredible flavor and very moist.  Will be a regular for me now.

This recipe is a keeper.  I used Greek vanilla yogurt, added the vanilla extract as recommended by another review, omitted the vegetable oil and also left off the topping ingredients.   This results in a muffin that is 93 calories in a total batch of 12 which is very reasonable for those watching their caloric intake.  My husband loved them.

Love these muffins.  Have made several times now.  This time, I substituted coconut palm sugar (used a little less) for the brown sugar.  I always use the applesauce instead of oil.  Excellent once again.....but, only produced 8 muffins.  Maybe as a result of the palm sugar??  Not sure.

Not impressed. Would not make again. Did not have much of a rhubarb impact. Even though I baked for an extra 5 min. they seemed a bit mushy in the center and fell apart after cooling.

Another excellent recipe from this site.  I made it as written with the exception of adding  oatmeal instead of almonds to the sugar topping, we just like the added texture of oatmeal and I did not have almonds on hand.  I will be making these again and this recipe inspired me to cut up some of my garden rhubarb and freeze it just to be able to make these in the winter time.

These were quite good; the family loved them.  As suggested by others, eliminated the nutmeg and increased the rhubarb to 1.5 cups and I probably could have added even more. My batter was quite dry - I had to add a splash of milk to get it  all the flour incorporated.  turned out fine, and will make these again.

These are really very good. I did make some modifications based both on necessity (what I had on hand) and suggestions from the reviews. I doubled the batch because I had fresh rhubarb that needed to be used, but I kept the amt of nutmeg the same which was a good choice. I used sour cream instead of yogurt b/c that's what I had on hand. I also used oats instead of almonds for the topping due to personal preference. I did add some chopped fresh strawberries (a little more than a cup), and used a total of 3 cups of rhubarb for the double batch. I replaced half of the all purpose flour with wheat flour. The muffins came out fantastic. I didn't add any vanilla because I forgot, and these are still so good. Must be a pretty forgiving recipe. Enjoy!

As the author stated you could use up frozen rhubarb yet instructions were not explicit  - Hence a soggy bland muffin. EUCH...
if you use frozen - thaw and drain first.....
There are superior and flavorful rhubarb muffins out there and as another reviewer said these don't enhance the rhubarb flavour.

Amazing.  Was a bit sceptical how they would turn out, wasn't sure if I should use straight frozen or thawed rhubarb - I thawed a bit in the microwave, just in case.  Subbed in coconut oil instead of cooking oil, a little more rhubarb, less sugar.   I had to kinda mould into balls as the mixture was so thick, but all worked well and they are so yummy!

I skipped the topping and think I should have added vanilla or something with flavor, I didnt have yogurt so I substtitued milk.  Nice appearance, but if you are hoping for a lot of flavor you need to add something else.

Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I substituted sour cream for the vanilla yogurt.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  These muffins were very moist and had a great flavor.

These are good. I doubled the muffins, but did not double the topping. We tried them with and without the topping. We have a nut allergy in our family, so used oatmeal instead of the almonds. I love oatmeal, so it was tasty. I also used whole wheat flour and dark brown sugar instead. I love the tartness of rhubarb, but it was too tart for my husband and sons (though my 7 year old son said this after eating five muffins, and my 5 year old after eating two, so I took that with a grain of salt). I found them to be very sweet. I would make these again for my daughter and I, but cut way back on the sugar, and probably skip the topping.

These muffins are AWESOME!  Some reviews say not to use the nutmeg.  I really liked the nutmeg and would keep it in.  The topping on these muffins really makes them complete.  I will make these every summer with my rhubarb.

Texture too dense, almost doughy.  Nutmeg on top awful.  Taste of tart rhubarb good.

I'm not an experienced baker, but these were easy and delicious. I did use quite a bit more rhubarb, probably 1 3/4 cups. I love rhubarb so I'd bump it up to 2 cups, or perhaps have the rhubarb cut in bigger chunks, mine was cut in about 1/2 inch dice. The yogurt I had is plain Greek, so I used a bit less and splashed in some milk to compensate for the thicker texture, then splashed in some vanilla. Usually I skip things like the topping for this recipe, but I'm glad I bothered since it added such personality to the muffins. I toasted the almonds before grinding them, makes a huge difference.  I loved these, very moist and not too too many calories for such a treat.

Yummy!  I substituted melted coconut oil for the butter and oil.  I used Bob's Redmill gluten free flour.  I followed another review and used sour cream and vanilla.  I didn't have yogurt.  Used 1-1/2 cups rhubarb.  Will definitely make these again.

My favorite recipes are ones that you can improvise with and still turn out terrific!  I halved this and it made 4 jumbo muffins.  Used sour cream and butter (no oil), doubled the rhubarb (frozen, thawed) and will quadruple it next time (we love rhubarb!).  Added 1 tsp vanilla and cinnamon to the batter.  Topped only with a  very light sprinkling of brown sugar; too lazy to make the topping and didn't think it would need it.  So simple, quick, and easy to make and a real stand-out, unique dessert with a great balance of fruit and very moist, light cake.

Everyone in my family enjoyed these, however, the kids don't like big chunks of fruit in their muffins, so I decided to put the cup of diced rhubarb into the food processor, which, when blended only amounted to about a half a cup, which, when cooked, gave absolutely zero rhubarb flavor.  The muffins had a great texture and the sugary topping was delicious.  I'd like to add more rhubarb next time but not sure if that will affect how it turns out.

I admit first of all that I am a rhubarb lover. Having said that, I think these are my favorite muffin ever. I go a little short on the sugar as it is a bit too sweet for me otherwise. Don't scrimp on the rhubarb! Today I used 2/3 cup of rhubarb and 2/3 cup of blueberries. Both were frozen so I partially thawed them in the microwave and drained off the liquid before folding them into the batter. They were wonderful!!!

This recipe blew me out of the water. VERY GOOD. I substituted vegan butter, coconut yogurt and barley flour, and added hemp seed and cashews to the topping. Seriously so good I'm sending a copy of the recipe to grandma.

Really easy, moist and tasty. I subbed 1c of ww flour for all purpose, and threw in chopped blueberries since I had a ton from my CSA. I didn't do the topping since my daughters school is nut free, but I took one reviewers suggestion and added the cinnamon into the batter. Yum!

Delicious! Didn't have almonds, but I used walnuts instead. I also didn't have nutmeg, so I replaced it with allspice. I used a bit more than 1/2 cup of yogurt as well. Definitely a great way to use the fresh rhubarb from our garden!!

Possible to do with whole wheat. Just add about 1/4 cup of milk to the wet ingredients. Instead of vanilla yogourt, can do with plain and add a teaspoon of vanilla. I like to add zest of lemon or orange with rhubarb, it enhance flavours.

The topping is perfect and really sets these muffins apart from others. These make great muffins for any tart fruit, like currants, which I used.
I used nonfat plain yoghurt with vanilla extract and unsweetened appleasauce instead of the oil. Would love to try a whole wheat version.

Yummy!  Didn't have yogurt so used almond milk.  Also pureed an old apple with the milk.  The muffins are perfectly moist, sweet and tangy.  Used whole wheat flour as well.

These didn't really turn out as "muffiny" as I expected, they were somewhere between a muffin and a lemon bar in consistency.  I've used a different rhubarb muffin recipe in the past that turned out much better

This is a fairly good recipe. I also made substitutions: 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/3 cup all purpose, I added Greek fat free yogurt (the high protein type) and added some vanilla extract for flavour. I ran out of liners half way through so a few had to go straight into the tin. I used some oil spray but the outside of the muffin was a bit tough when it came out. Much better with a liner. I also added extra rhubarb, probably close to two cups, as other suggested. All in all I am impressed when a recipe turns out this well first time around!

Love this recipe for its versatility. I too made these more healthful, subbing in 1/2 WW flour, natural applesauce for the butter and oil, brown sugar Splenda blend and greek yogurt, and added 1/8 c. ea. ground flaxseed and wheat germ. I increased the baking soda to 1 tsp. Followed others' suggestions of using 1 1/2 cup of rhubarb. I did not do the topping, but added the cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the dry ingredients. My DH and son loved these, they were moist and delicious - as a muffin should be.

I followed other reviews and used sour cream and vanilla as I was out of yogurt. I put in 3/4 cup of rhubarb and 3/4 cup of blackberries. Very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!! Made these with fresh rhubarb from my garden and they turned out perfectly!! Very tasty, light, fluffy, and moist. The only change I made was to use chopped walnuts instead of  sliced almonds in the topping.

One of the best  I've had! They stayed moist of days and had a lovely texture to them. I wouldn't alter the recipe at all,as they were too good to mess with!

absolutely delicious! I added blueberries and skipped on the nutmeg. I added a banana instead of the butter.  I made these for my family and they were gone in minutes!

I got 21 muffins out of a double recipe.  I used a generous measure of brown sugar for the topping and had lots.  I used 1/2 the nutmeg as recommended and added a bit of fresh orange peel because I used plain yogurt.  I also used 1 cup of apple and 2 of rhubarb.

The topping is what makes these delicious, make sure to make more than recommended so you have enough to go around. I ran out with two muffins left (and I used sparingly) and those  two muffins left something to be desired. I loved the rhubarb though, cut mine into 1/2 inch pieces so they were large enough not to 'disappear' as some users experienced.

Very nice!  As another reviewer suggested, I used my plain yoghurt with vanilla essence instead of vanilla yoghurt; also used half wholemeal flour.  I added some chopped fresh ginger, and used slightly more rhubarb--I also flubbed the topping, just using brown sugar, cinnamon and oats because I was in a hurry.  Oh, and I added spices to the mixture, too.

Baked in mini-muffin tins (it made about 40), and they came out tangy, moist and luscious!  Orange rind and raisins would be good additions too, I think.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy.  I did not use the almonds, but it was good!  The topping was very good!  I think I will try it without the topping next time to save the calories though.

Very moist and easy to make.  Really needs the 1 cup of rhubarb.  (I only had 3/4c. to use and wished I had more!)  Like the use of yogurt and  will definately make again.  Made 6 large muffins which was enough for our family of 3.

Wow! These were terrific.  I made them for Christmas morning and they were a hit. Very moist.  They froze well and I used some for breakfast a few weeks later.
