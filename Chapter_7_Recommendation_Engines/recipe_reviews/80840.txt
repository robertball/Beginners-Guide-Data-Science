I made this casserole for a large brunch this morning.  Since I made the recipe x4, I added extra eggs and less milk.  I also put mushrooms, onions and green peppers between the two layers.  It was a hit! Everyone enjoyed it and it was very fluffy and delicious.  I would suggest spraying the pan with non-stick cooking spray, as it did stick a little.  Also, I cooked it 1/2 hour longer, due to the larger pan and multiplied recipe.  Thanks for a nice breakfast dish!

Delicious. Very easy to make and came out wonderful. I made a smaller version with just one layer of bread since it's just me and my boyfriend...Add green peppers and mushrooms and I was in heaven!

I make this for brunch every Christmas and now I'm making it for an Easter brunch.  I spice it up with green onions, red and green pepper and sometimes I even add mushrooms.  Decreasing the milk and adding eggs work great.  I even add hashbrowns and extra cheese if I have more people to feed.  We like it extra creamy by using cream instead of milk.

This is a real simple breakfast that will please most anyone. If you want some extra spice add a little chopped ortega canned chilles to the mix.

bleh...this was actually kind of gross.  Maybe I used the wrong bread (orowheat wheat bread), but there was too much of a soggy wheat bread taste to it.  I won't make this again.

Really really good.  I just cubed the bread, crusts and all. Mixed in the bacon, more like 12 pieces. Stirred in cheese, and dotted with butter. Then I poured about fourteen eggs and 4 cups of milk over it for the night. My pan was a size larger. I baked at 325 for hour. Fantastic!!!!!!!

Made this as written for Christmas morning brunch and loved it.  Next time may try green onions or even sausage.  Great recipe that can be doubled or halved successfully.

I cut this recipe by half.  It didn't really thrill either of us.  It really needs some chives or onions, maybe green chilies.  I wasn't impressed.  It is easy enough, just not anything that would knock your socks off.
