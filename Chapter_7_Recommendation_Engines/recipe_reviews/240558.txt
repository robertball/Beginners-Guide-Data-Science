Mmmmm! I could eat these every day! I never eat pancakes because of the calories and carbs, but these are a great alternative, without the guilt! They are naturally sweetened with the banana, so make sure your banana is really ripe.  I'd say these are most similar to crepes. I made mine a little bigger (wasn't really sure how much to ladle in the pan) so I ended up with 5 medium sized pancakes.  I found them a little hard to flip because the texture is a little "sticky" and they really grip the spatula, so I ended up using 2 spatulas and that worked well. My first couple came out a little dark, but I ended up finding that cooking them at med-low heat (instead of medium) for 2 mins per side did the trick. This one is a keeper! Thank you repeatdreaming for the fabulous recipe!

I'm on the fence about these. I made them on a whim this morning because I had a large ripe banana to use up. I thought they tasted good--didn't even need any syrup or sugar on them; I just put a little more butter on top, and my toddler liked them. I doubled the baking powder because the other reviews said how thin they were. I don't know if it helped raise them anymore, but it didn't affect the taste at all. I tried using a crepe pan and spread the batter thin and prepared like a crepe. It worked out OK, but broke in a couple places. I then tried making them smaller and a little thicker like pancakes, and that didn't turn out well at all. (I really didn't have bubbles form or the edges get dry like the recipe says.) I think the best thing would be to make them like small crepes. Keep spreading the batter over the edges so they get thin. I'm not sure if I'll try again or not. Although I liked the flavor, they were a bit of a pain to cook.  Thanks for the recipe. It is interesting.

Omg! These are incredible! They taste kind of like banana nut bread onion pancake form! I added a little bit of nutmeg and a little bit of vanilla. Delicious!

Adjust your expectations to the fact that these do not include flour - therefore, they don't have the light texture of traditional pancakes. That said, they're very good! Really nice banana flavor. Cinnamon and nutmeg were nice additions!

I used 1 mashed banana, 2 eggs, cinnamon.  It was delish! So good, in fact, that I started eating them before I put the pure maple syrup on top. Although I like butter on pancakes, I really didn't need the butter because these are more like crepes.

3-ingredient Pancake Haiku: "Very hard to flip. Gotta eat them right away, else they're rubbery." Had a really ripe banana so decided to give these a try for my daughter and I (but I should've realized w/ just one banana and two eggs, that it wouldn't really feed two people); she wasn't impressed at all, despite my adding a squirt of whipped cream. I thought they were just OK, but much more like crepes - very thin, delicate, and way too hard to flip. If they sat on a plate any longer than a few minutes, they started to take on an unpleasant rubbery texture, so they definitely had to be eaten right away.

They are really sweet because of the banana, however I did find them a little too egg based for my liking.

My main problem was that I was expecting pancakes and instead got a scrambled egg taste with a hint of sweetness from the banana.

I will never eat regular pancakes again! These were amazing! Only a slight taste of banana bread... Were not heavy on my stomach and didn't make me feel tired after eating. You can add anything to these. I've added blueberries, different nuts, chia seeds, strawberries, the list goes on! I've made them numerous times now and absolutely love them!

Have them about once a week.  Only differences, I pour the whole lot into a large skillet and sprinkle blueberries on the cooking batter.  When it's ready to turn I cross cut into quarters and flip each one.  They're triangular, but all get done at the same time.  A little butter, and real maple syrup drizzle.  Great, healthy breakfast.

Guilt free pancakes! Sounds like a weird recipe, but is very yummy! I donâ€™t use the leavening though, just the eggs, banana, and cinnamon.

I recommend doing it in an air fryer so that the breading doesnâ€™t get soggy, but it is delicious!

I made a large batch with 5 bananas and 6 eggs, and the pancakes were watery and a bit flavourless at first.  I added some salt and flour to the mix and voila! Made the texture way better, and held the batter together so they didn't just fall apart on your fork.  With less eggs and the added ingredients, these turned out pretty fluffy and good.  You just have to play around with the mixture a bit, every batch is different

I never post if itâ€™s not that good but this was awful.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out looking like scrambled eggs. They tasted like scrambled eggs with a hint of banana. Threw it all away

Tastes great!!! I love the flavor, but I do not like the consistency.  I thought I could make pancakes with it, but it was such a hassle flipping the batter in my pan.  I attempted to make the batter into pancakes multiple times with no avail.  I love how it tastes though :)

My family and I all loved these pancakes...so yummy and healthier than regular pancakes! No syrup needed since naturally sweetened by banana. They are more like crepes, but still amazing!   I doubled the recipe since we are a family of 6, cooked them like pancakes, and got approximately 10 good sized pancakes- next time, I'll triple the recipe! I've saved this recipe and we will certainly be enjoying this again and again!
I added scrambled eggs, bacon and fruit and ended up with a complete breakfast...but this is all optional.

I like that they taste good without syrup.  I tried adding a couple table spoons of chickpea flour, which seems to make them fluffier without adding gluten.  I saved some banana slices to drop into the batter once it was in the pan.  I tried various sizes, little ones are easy to flip while big ones are more challenging.  Some turned out like scrambled pancake eggs because the pan was not hot enough and not enough butter/oil in the pan.

These tasted very eggy to me and they wouldn't flip in one piece. I ended up with weird scrambled banana pancakes. It was also very hard to figure out when to flip them.

Excellent gluten free pancakes. Very tasty - really no need for syrup! I added vanilla, lemon, and almond to the mix. Also, I had to practice a couple of times to get the heat right in the pan for the thin, delicate batter and cooking with butter. 

I doubled the batter to feed five; it all turned out quite well!

Healthier than the alternative. I made a mistake by using Apple bananas I had in the fridge and I don't think they were ripe enough because they didn't mash easily. But low and behold the pancakes still held together and I had my pan buttered well and low to medium heat and found that I had no problem with flipping. If you can flip an egg this will be a cake... Err pancake :) I ended up assembling them with a nice over easy egg, goat cheese and crispy bacon. My family loved them! I want to try it with sausage next time.

Great alternative to the traditional flour ones.
Flavor is amazing, I double the baking soda and pancakes were still amazing. Don't expect the texture to be the same but a lot healthier.

Good alternative to pancakes. I agree with the other reviewers, more of a crepe than pancake. I skipped the syrup and added a few chocolate chips. Next time will try blueberries. Super easy and I will probably make it again.

This what I am talking about, add some blueberries, and maybe some diced up apples to the mix. Yup, it's  good.

Used two bananas, 2 eggs slightly beaten and 1/4 c whole wheat flour instead of baking powder and no cinnamon. Easy and turned out great.

Love these!  I'm a disaster in the kitchen,  but these were so easy even I could make them!  LOL.  I made one with a little bit of cinnamon added to the mix.  
   GREAT flavor, no need for syrup.  
Down side is that they are hard to flip, without the flour they're more runny.  These are filling AND I love the flavor so much that doesn't really bother me, it's more of an aesthetic thing.

I made these according to recipe dividing the batter in four. Don't go into this expecting pancakes go into it expecting thick banana flavored crepes. They were very good. They were not pancakes though. I will make these again. I served them rolled up with butter and sliced fruits.
