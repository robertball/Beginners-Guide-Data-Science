This was VERY good!  I made some changes, here is exactly what I did: I grated 4 baby carrots and about half of a yellow onion into the bowl using a large microplane.  I soaked the 1 cup of breadcrumbs in the 1 cup of milk while I was grating the veggies.  This last step plumps up the bread so that it's nice and moist all through the mixture, and then I just add this mushy mixture to the meatloaf.  Also, I grated the colby cheese fresh instead of using pre-grated since I find it melts better this way.  As the recipe stated, after using my hands to mix the meatloaf, I FOLDED the cheese in using a spoonula as if making a mousse.  I added a few splashes of worcestershire sauce to the mix, and then I formed TWO loaves in a 9x13 baking dish.  Covered each loaf with a thin layer of my favorite bottled BBQ sauce, and used a thermometer to alert me when they had reached 175 degrees, took them out of the oven and covered with foil for a couple of minutes. Delicious!  I love this served with oven-roasted potatoes or mashed potatoes, and 'Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad' from this website. ***UPDATE: according to the USDA website (and other websites as well), ground turkey must be cooked to 165 degrees.  So, I remove this meatloaf from the oven when it registers between 155 and 160, and then cover tightly with foil so it comes up to temp.  ALWAYS moist, never dry.

This recipe is great and super quick!! I added much more seasoning to the ground turkey vs. just the S&P the recipes calls for - such as, grated onion, garlic, worchestire, seasoning salt.  I also used shredded cheddar instead of cubed colby because that is what I had on hand.  Also, try BBQ sauce on the top instead of the traditional ketchup.  I mixed all the ingredients earlier in the day while my son was sleeping and let it sit in the fridge. Then I just slipped it in the oven.  I think that really helped meld the flavors together. I would definitely make this again.

The flavor on this meatloaf was 5 stars, even my picky kids asked for seconds. I had to give it a 4 for CATCHING MY OVEN ON FIRE. I was a bit skeptical about the cheese being in cubes, but after the great reviews I figured I was over reacting. Even so I made my cubes smaller. 20 minutes into cooking cheese bubbled out the pan, onto the heating element and caught fire. I put a tray under it and continued cooking. It was great flavor. From now on I will shred my cheese as I usually do. I also shredded on small zucchini and a small carrot and added them to the mix since I was a bit short pundage wise on the turkey. (This was also a great way to gets some veggies into the kids!) Great recipe,just please shred your cheese!

Very cheesy, very easy to make.  It was almost reminded me of a giant cheeseburger.  I did use cubed cheese as recommended & I loved how the cheese was throughout the meatloaf in yummy "globs" of cheesiness... :-)I cut the portion down to 4 servings using 1 lb. of ground turkey.  I also added about 3 tbs. of smoky BBQ sauce to the mixture, 2 tbs. of dried parsley, & about 3 tbs. of chopped vidalia onion.  Next time I will add more onion.  It was done cooking in about 57 minutes and was extremely moist.  I thought that the smoky BBQ sauce really added a needed flavor.  I thought it was great & will definitely make again.

This recipe is easy and tasty - what more could you want?

My father is a raving fan of beef, but he asks me to make this for him all the time - a high compliment from him.

The only changes I made to it were to soak the breadcrumbs in the milk for 5 minutes (as another reviewer suggested) before combining with the turkey (which I'm certain makes a huge difference), using shredded cheese instead of cubed, and adding Worcestershire sauce to the ground turkey when mixing through, as it adds a fullness to the flavour of the meatloaf.  Sometimes I also caramelise some finely chopped onions and add them to the turkey mix as well, and it's lovely.

Like I said, this recipe's good - so good, I've been asked to make it tonight (this'll be the third time at least!).

This is by far the best meatloaf recipe I have ever tried.  It's so moist and delicious with all that cheese.  I do like a little more spice, however, so I added some A-1 steak sauce, garlic powder, and dried minced onions to the meat mixture and let it sit for an hour before I made the loaf.  The result was heavenly.  

A word of caution:  make sure you have a drip pan underneath or you'll have a huge mess because some of the cheese will ooze out of the pan.  Temporarily turning off your smoke alarm and using a meat thermometer is also recommended.

I have honestly hated meatloaf just about as long as I've been alive. Until THIS recipe came along!!! This is the most AMAZING meatloaf I've ever had. My only changes; I used shredded cheese instead (all I had on hand) and added a little bit of onion soup mix. So good. Thank you!

This was really good and simple!  I halved the recipe, except added all of the shredded cheese.  I used seasoning salt instead of plain salt, a dash of worcestshire sauce, and mixed the ketchup right into it.  We LOVED it, including my husband who isn't a fan of ground turkey.  He even ate the leftovers on a sandwich later!  Thanks!

My son really wanted to make this. I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor. But we did add a package of onion soup mix. I think it would be pretty tasteless without it. Mine took about an 1 hour and 15 minutes to reach the proper temperature.  And like others have said, it bubbles over and makes a nightmare out of the oven.

It was good, but I found it to be a little flavorless. I needed to eat it with a lot of ketchup , I would find a way to tweak it to add more flavor next time!

I LOVE meatloaf.  Could not get my family to ever eat it so I went without  for years until this recipe.    I much prefer turkey over the gr beef. I did make changes because there are so many ideas.    I used 1lb of good gr. turkey..next time i will use 2lb.   1 egg some garlic powder, montery steak seasoning, sea salt and wort sauce (sorry cant spell wortschire right)    In meantime sauted a mixture of finely chopped onion and garlic in olive oil.  Added white sliced mushrooms to the onion mixture with  garlic salt and a nice drop of red wine.   Poured half the mushroom onion mixture to the turkey meat and about 1 cup panko bread crumbs. Mix well spread half the meat mixture in a glass baking dish.   Layered fresh baby spinach leaves, the rest of the onion mushroom mixture and about 3 slices of pepper jack cheese. ThenI spread the rest of the turkey mixture on top and sealed edges.  Baked or 3o and added a glaze of ketchup, mustard and wort sauce and baked for another 3o at 350. served with mashed potatoes.  No veg needed cuz the spinach and mushrooms are baked in the turkey loaf.  This is the best ever.   Thank you for sharing.

Made this twice already, and each time it's been a great hit with my family. My brothers, the big red meat-eaters, always ask for seconds... and thirds. :) The flavor was fabulous and the cheese just adds to the overall deliciousness! I did add a little more S&P the second time around, and it was that much better! :) This is another recipe that will be continued in my house. Thank you for sharing!

This is a really great basic meat loaf recipe. I have used my own mexican meat loaf recipe for years but was looking for something specific to do with ground turkey & ran across this one. I did make a few changes but not anything that totally changes it. I used grated cheese, my own unflavored bread crumbs ( I put heels in a freezer bag to keep for this purpose) which I also soaked in the milk. I also added in about 1 c of a frozen onion,green pepper & celery blend & some Worchestershire & garlic salt. I topped it w/ Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce & my family polished off the entire thing! I had 3 lbs of meat so I adjusted the recipe & made 2 loafs one of which I put in the freezer to bake later. We were a little disappointed b/c there weren't any leftovers to make sandwiches with so I may have to pull it out sooner rather than later. All of my adjustments were more for taste than the mechanics of the recipe. Thanks , we love it!

This was amazing!!!  I only made minor changes; soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk, added shredded carrot and diced onion.  Instead of ketchup, I used bbq sauce (sweet baby rays) it's the best!  Oh my goodness!!! I never get seconds especially with something like meatloaf, but I did tonight.  GREAT recipe....in my file for good :)

This turned out really good. I used shredded sharp cheddar and shredded jack because that's what I had, and I tweaked the seasons by adding onion & garlic powder and black pepper. I formed mine into a french bread-shaped loaf and baked it on a sprayed & foil-lined baking sheet - I've found this helps cut down on burning in meatloaves that have sticking potential. I'll try this again some time when I have the cheese to cube. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW. I was skeptical, but made this recipe exactly as listed. I was blown away with the results! The recipe seems light on seasoning compared to other meatloaves I've made, but the Italian bread crumbs and colby cheese add big, wonderful flavor. Even the plain ketchup on top tasted just-right! Quick prep, huge flavor, and enough for leftovers. This is definitely my new favorite meatloaf recipe!

Delicious!  The only change I made was to cut the recipes in half because I was only cooking for two, but that was enough to fill a small loaf pan perfectly!  It was very moist and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.

I use this recipe so often that I am needing to print out another copy because the old one is so tattered!  I usually add some sauteed shallots and garlic to the mixture.  I also mix some mustard and brown sugar with the ketchup.  And, I use shredded cheese instead of cubed cheese.

I really enjoyed this recipe - and so did my husband :-) I cut the recipe in 1/2 and I used Italian seasoned ground turkey meat since it is what I had in the freezer. Since I had the Italian seasoned turkey I changed the recipe up a little bit - I used grated parmesan cheese and added diced jalapenos as well as fresh garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper, 1/2 oatmeal and 1/2 bread crumbs. I used 1 egg and 1/2 c milk but I found that my loaf was too liquidy - so I added more oatmeal and bread crumbs until the consistency was right.  I baked it for 1hr and 15 min and it was perfect! Very very good!! I know that I did make changes to the recipe but I only did so since I did not have plain ground turkey. I will be making this again for sure!!

I'm not a fan of meatloaf, but my husband is...so I tried this.  Substituted 1% milk and low fat everything & egg whites.  It was FANTASTIC!  I'll definitely be making this again!

Excellent!  Since the point of making turkey anything is to cut fat and calories I made some changes.  Used ground turkey BREAST, eggs, 2% Kraft cheese crumbles, extra skim milk, sauteed onion, garlic clove and celery, fresh bread crumbs, and a packet of low sodium onion soup mix.  Eliminated the salt and used some Mrs. Dash and dry parsley.  Covered the roasting pan and baked at 375° until the internal temp reached 165°.  It was moist and flavorful with a lower calorie and fat count.  Thank you for a great recipe!  I noticed some people had problems with spillovers in the oven.  I used one of those deep speckled enamel roasting pans with a cover, sprayed it with Pam and it was perfect.  Easy clean-up with no oven mess.

Wow, this was sooooo good and you'd never even know it was turkey!  I used half the cheese and since I don't like ketchup, used worchestershire sauce instead.  I just sprinkled it over the top before I put the loaf in the oven.  My daughter's only four months old but I'm sure she'll love this when she's old enough!

My family loved this.  Even my 6-year-old PICKY son said it was delicious.  If he says something is good, then it really must be!  I will definitely make it again.

This was the 2nd time I made this and I still had very little of the cheese in the meatloaf and most of it on the bottom of the pan. Not sure what I'm doing wrong here. I halved the recipe, used panko, grated in 1/4 an onion, added 1 clove garlic, a few dashes of worcestershire and a T of parmesan cheese.  It was really good, but disappointed about the cheese.

Best meatloaf I have ever tasted! The whole family loved it. I soaked the bread crumbs in milk before adding it to the meat mixture and used shredded cheese instead of cubed. Also added garlic powder, onion powder, and a bit of Worcestershire sauce.

I have never been a meatloaf fan; but this was SO moist and flavorful, I couldn't stop going back for more!  I didn't have Italian breadcrumbs, so I made my own bread crumbs (it turned out to be a bit more than a cup!) & added Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, minced garlic, paprika, and garlic powder.  I used a mixture of ketchup, BBQ sauce, and brown sugar for the glaze; I don't think it needed the sugar, in fact just ketchup would have done fine.  I was amazed by the amount of cheese, but I cubed & threw it in just like the recipe said, and my family LOVED it.  My fickle 2-year-old especially!

To those of you who said it left your oven a mess: there are 2 solutions to this.  Place the loaf pan on a cookie sheet before putting it in the oven!  OR (/AND, if you're really cautious,) either use a big enough loaf pan, or 2 loaf pans, so it's not likely to overflow.  Mine didn't have a problem!

P.S. Bonus points to this recipe for making PHENOMENAL leftovers!  It reheats and tastes just as good; and the texture is perfect!  Next time I'm making a double batch!  This WILL be my standby meatloaf recipe!

Best meatloaf I've made yet!  I use ground turkey for everything instead of ground beef and so when I tried this I was very happy with the results.  I did add finely chopped garlic and onion just because we like it that way and also used BBQ insead of ketchup. It was wonderful.  Definate  do over.  thanks!!!

Turned out very good.  I mixed in some salsa instead of ketchup and used regular bread crumbs (didn't have italian).  I also added about a teaspoon of garlic.

My husband said this is the best meatloaf he has ever had. He had no idea it was turkey and couldn't have cared less. He was skeptical as I was taking it out of the oven, but after one bite he was raving and already planning what to do with the leftovers. I added some onion and garlic that I cooked on the stovetop to softed (about 1/4 white onion and 2 tbsp garlic) and I did soak the breadcrumbs in the milk. I also used shredded cheddar because that's what we had, but I am looking forward to trying the cubes. I made a glaze of ketchup, a few splashes of worchestershire, a little yellow mustard, and a pinch of brown sugar. Served with green beans and roasted sweet potatoes.

Great turkey meatloaf. I only changed a couple of things. Used Shredded cheese instead of cubed and added 1/2 package of McCormick's Swedish meatball seasoning and sauce mix along with some minced onion. Tastes absolutely delicious!!

My guy is still raving about this meatloaf, and I cooked it 3 weeks ago. I used other viewers advice and used bbq sauce instead of ketchup. I also only had unseasoned breadcrumbs, so I spiced those up a bit and used shredded colby/monterey jack cheese blend. And yum!!!!!

This meatloaf is amazing! My children love it and think it is so much better than regular meatloaf. This has become a regular meal for us since we tried it several months ago. 

As I note, I've only used shredded cheddar chesse because I never have colby on hand.

I was only making for two people so I used 1 lb of ground turkey and 1 egg for this dish. I soaked some white bread, cut into cubes in milk. I also seasoned it with italian seasoning. I added a little salt, black pepper, 1 garlic clove and a dash of worchestershire sauce. Lastly, I folded in the cubed colby cheese then topped it off with a thin layer of heinz ketchup. It doesn't say whether or not to bake covered, but I covered with a foil. Putting this together was easy. Baking was approximate as well; Baked 400 degrees in one hour. I had a wonderfully lightly seasoned moist meatloaf. I liked the cubes of melted colby cheese bubbling and oozing out from all over. I was surprised how well the cheese worked in this dish. Nothing overpowering the ketchup, colby cheese or meatloaf itself. My family loved the meatloaf and said that this tasted like a cheeseburger. I served this with "Browned Butter Vegetables with Almonds, " and "Bacon Rosemary Mashed Potatoes", all from this website. This is what I would consider "comfort food".

This was an instant classic in our house. I definatly add various diffrent spices to add a little flavor to the meat, like garlic, onion, and whatever I have on hand that i think will go good.

Really enjoyed this meatloaf.  Followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was too runny for me.  I like a free-form meatloaf better than one you put in a loaf pan.  Taste was wonderful, though.  2nd and 3rd times, I used less liquid and was able to form the loaf instead of putting it in a loaf pan.  Love the runny bits of cheese that ooze out when this if finished.  Watch out for the grease splatters in your oven while this is cooking (this was more of a problem when I used less liquid and formed my own loaf).   Everyone in the house loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I used shredded cheddar rather than cubed Colby cheese, did not use ketchup and baked them in muffin tins (took 1/2 the time to cook). Also sprinkled in some onion and garlic powder. My kids, ages seven and 3, loved it! Might try mixing in pureed cauliflower next time in place of milk for more nutrition.

Was very good but next time I would try a different type of cheese, maybe mild cheddar. Not crazy about the flavor of the colby, a bit overpowering.

Great recipe although I made some changes...I'm cooking for 1 so I cut the recipe in half.  I mixed the bread crumbs and milk and let it sit for a minute as another reviewer suggested.  I then added a little more milk so it wasn't so dry.  I used 8oz of shredded Mont Jack/Cheddar cheese, chopped up a small onion, 2 tsp of fresh garlic, seasoned with garlic/onion powders, salt/pepper and a splash or two of worchestire.  I left out the ketchup.  I made 2 good size loaves out of it in a baking dish and put a little bit of water on the bottom of the pan.  I cooked it for 45 minutes at 400.  I complimented it with chopped red potatoes drizzled with EVOO and 3/4 of a Good Seasons Italian dressing package.  Mixed it well and put in a loaf pan and covered with foil.  30 minutes into cooking I stirred them up.  Sprinkled with Parm/Romano cheese at the end.  Simply delicious and I don't like meatloaf made with beef, it dries out!
Tip: I used a baking dish instead of the loaf pan because of the issues with it making a mess.  No mess in my oven!

I was pleasantly surprised with how wonderful this was! So moist! I halved this, it makes a lot and the whole recipe would have been too much for my loaf pan. Now I did goof but it didn't matter! I looked at the ingredients and because I add ketchup to my beef meatloaf, I just figured it went in the meat. I had already added a bit of A1 steak sauce and about a 1/4 cup finely minced onions so I just add a bit more bread crumbs and topped with additional ketchup. I also used shredded cheddar as that is what I had. I LOVED it! Even my husband who loves regular meatloaf enjoyed this enough to have leftovers the next night! Thank you!

Yum! i cut the recipe in 1/2 (1 pound turkey), like other reviews i used grated 1/2 onion, 1/2 carrot, grated 3/4 small block of cheese (used Monterrey jack), added 2 cloves of garlic, few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, some italian seasoning i had on hand to the turkey mix. i also let the bread crumbs soak in the milk for a few minutes before mixing in the turkey. i put everything into a glass baking dish as i didnt have a loaf pan. put in the oven for 50 min and pulled it out, drained off some of the liquid that was at the side of the glass dish (came off the loaf), covered with foil for another 10 min. was perfect.  served with mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies. next time will sneak zucchini in so my 2 year old gets a little more veggies. picky hubby even liked this!

Best meatloaf ever! My family and I LOVED this loaf... they even went so far as to say it was the best meatloaf they've EVER had, turkey, beef, or otherwise!  I used the dark meat ground turkey (94%).  I made a few very minor changes from the original recipe: I soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk as suggested (they soaked it right up in about a minute).  I used 8oz Colby Jack cheese (couldn't find just colby) and it was plenty - I think more would have been overkill.  I cubed it a bit smaller than the recipe says. I also added a couple dashes of onion powder, and some grated carrot (I didn't measure, but a big handful or about 7-8 baby carrots).  To the ketchup, I added about 1/4cup brown sugar - which was a good move!  It was incredibly moist and delicious, everyone's asking me when I'll make it again!

The mixture filled up my stoneware loaf pan to the top so I needed a baking sheet underneath to catch the drippings.  This was very moist as I did soak the bread crumbs in the milk BEFORE mixing with the ground turkey.  I will make this again and again.

followed most reviewers advise on adding more spices to the turkey and letting it sit for a about 30mins, soaked the breadcrumb in milk for a few minutes to get soft before adding into the meat mixture. i didn't have any other kind of cheese in the house but velveeta so i had to use that, formed the mixture into two loaves and put it in a 9x13 pan and covered it with a thin film of B-que sauce and baked for 1hr. this meat loaf came out awesome and moist. will definitely try it again

since i first made this, we have learned to STOCK UP on ground turkey.  i would say this is close to turkey roast with a bite of stuffing at the same time. i keep it plain n simple tho(i dont remember if this calls for bbq sauce or ket?, which ever i dont use either) and the only diffrence i make is SHREDDED cheese not cubed, what ever type of cheese we have on hand does well too...we LOVE it with cranberry sauce. i usually shredd a few carrots or 1 med sweet potato and add it just for extra vitamins for the kids.  thanks a million! this is a 1-2x per month dish in our house!!!!

I love this stuff! I hate traditional meat loaf and was very skeptical about making this but it was amazing! Everyone I've made it for (including a die-hard turkey burger hater) has loved it, too!

Very easy to make. I sauteeded 1/2 a yellow onion (finely diced) and 1 box of mushrooms (sliced) and added it to the meat mixture before baking it. I put a layer of bacon on top to keep it moist. I did not use a pan - I made 2 free-form loaves and put them on a baking sheet wrapped with foil. This let the fat/grease run out and made the meatloaf perfect.

Well I had to adjust this a bit.. or I'd give it a 5. I altered by using 1 c. crushed saltines w/ 2 tsp. italian seasoning. Also added 1 tbs. crushed garlic, 1 tsp. onion powder, and a couple squirts ranch dressing. I used only 1/2 c. milk and folded in 1 c. shredded cheddar/mot. jack blend. Topped w/ A1 steak cause instead of ketchup. Came out AMAZING! I used to love red meat meatloaf.. but this is my new absolute favorite!!!!! YUM!

We LOVE this meatloaf! my 13 y/o and 6 y/o finicky eaters even gives it a thumbs up, they like it so much that I make it at least once a week! Some changes that I made: I use Stovetop stuffing mix instead of the italian bread crumbs. I also use shredded colby/jack cheese instead of the cubed ones. I add a little bit of worcestershire sauce. Also I add a 1/4 tsp of brown sugar to the ketchup mixture. Awesome... Now my kids think I'm the best cook!

Very yummy-even my 3 kids ate it.  I used Italian blend shredded cheese, added a half of a zucchini shredded, Italian herbs, garlic and spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup.  I also halved everything b/c I wanted to use just one pound of the turkey.  I will make it again!

This is a recipe with promise.  It is a healthier alternative to regular meatloaf.  I followed the recipe and found that it needs a little more seasoning to give it some zip. I used mini loaf pans and it still took over an hour to cook. Next time I plan to add onion, garlic salt, and some more bread crumbs to keep the meatloaf from being so difficult to handle when raw.  The recipe quantity is big enough to feed a family of four twice.  Freeze the extra pound of meatloaf mix for an easy dinner later.

My husband and I only use ground turkey in our house but were still skeptical about how this meatloaf would turn out.... turns out, It's great!  My husband gave it a 7 out of 10, I would say 8 or 9 out of 10.  Next time I would like to try bell peppers, onions and maybe a spicy bar b q sauce on top instead of ketchup.  Everyone should take the advice from the woman whose oven caught on fire: Definitely put a cookie sheet or broiler pan underneath.  The cheese starts to boil over after about 15-20 minutes in the oven.  We would definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe to play with!  I used garlic salt instead and cut up some onion plus added some chili power.  My husband loved it and said “this is a keeper”.  Also this was great for meatloaf sandwiches (was not dry) the next day.  -Thanks

This recipe was great!!!  I only had 1/2 pound cheese and it was still very cheesy and moist.  My 3 year old who rarely touches meat, had two helpings.  Will definately make again and again.

A little bland, to be honest.  I'm no chef so I don't know what exactly was missing, but it could benefit from some additional seasoning of some kind, and a stronger tasting cheese

This was fantastic. I opted to split it into two football shaped loaves into a 9x13 cake pan. Covered both with Sweet Baby Rays. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T. My husband hates everything and complemented this. Thanks!

I never expected this meatloaf to taste so good - very flavorful and moist!

Like others suggested, I added worchester sauce, some grated onion and garlic to give the turkey a little more flavor.  I also soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk and basted the top of the meatloaf with barbecue sauce.

I baked the meatloaf in a 2 qt baking dish (8 x 11.5) instead of in a loaf pan for 45 minutes.  There was no mess that way and I could easily drain the fat (from the cheese) before serving.

I will definitely make this again.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added diced onions. I also made fresh bread crumbs instead of using dry. If you want to change it up a bit, add some mozarella instead of colby and roasted red peppers.

good recipe. thought it needed more flavor. I used homemade onion soup mix, dash worchestershire, italian seasoning, garlic. shredded cheese instead of chunk. chopped celery and carrot in processor and added. I use ketchup instead of milk with the egg and bread crumbs. And, the guy from cincinnati I believe is referring to CHILI sauce with a touch of br sugar on top. thats how i was brought up eating meatloaf

Oh my GOSH! This was good! I didn't change anything about the recipe except that I halved it (and still needed the full amount of baking time as the regular recipe). If you're thinking of trying it, do!! It's so so delicious-- I can't wait to have leftovers for lunch!

Very nice meatloaf, from one who doesn't really like meatloaf.  I took a few suggestions like shredding onion and adding a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.  I made mine free-form on a cookie sheet and coated one with brown sugar than ketchup and another with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  It was all good when it was hot and also when it was cold on sandwiches.  Will definitely use this again

One of the best meatloaf recipes we've had!! I did a 4 serving version. I used cheese cubes, but cut them down to about a 1/4 inch cube. I used three quarters of the amount of cheese specified (4 oz for 4 serving). My cheese did not overflow and it was the perfect amount. It oozed just beautifully when cut into. It was done at 65 minutes with a temperature approaching 160 degrees. The ketchup topping ensures this meatloaf is full of juices. Because we used ketchup to top I left out the salt and pepper and we did not miss it. SO GOOD.

YUMMY!  My picky kids loved it!  word to the wise, divide the meat in half and bake into 2 loafs!  there is just too much meat and grease from the cheese.  The second loaf can be cooled, sliced, and frozen into individual portions.  Thank you for this recipe, it is the first time I have used ground turkey in place of beef.

Perfect recipe!  Simple and quick to make with staple ingredients and a total crowd pleaser.  The resulting meatloaf is moist and flavorful, not too dense on the inside with that awesome meatloaf crust on the outside.  I only had plain bradcrumbs on hand so I used them and added extra salt and pepper, plus pinches of dried thyme, rosemary, parsley and some fresh garlic.  Also, I used shredded mozzarella instead of colby.  This recipe is going into my regular dinner rotation!

This was delicious! I really do not care for meatloaf, but I really enjoy this recipe. I used ground turkey breast to make it healthier, an only used 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. I also used 1/3 seasoned breadcrumbs, 1/3 plain breadcrumbs and 1/3 parmesan cheese. Delicious!

This was great. I halved the recipe because I only had a pound of turkey. I also used shredded mild cheddar because it's what I had on hand and put some onion and garlic powder in the mix. Easy and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really enjoyed this. I made the neely's bbq sauce and used that as the outer sauce. Next time I might add jalapenos.

You haven't had a great turkey meatloaf until you've tried this one!  My husband and I LOVE this recipe.  It doesn't even taste like you're eating ground turkey (which I am not a big fan of). I use whatever cheese I have in the fridge and follow the recipe exactly and it turns out great every time!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a combination of low fat sharp cheddar and low fat colby cheddar cubes. I also substituted KC barbeque sauce for the ketchup.  Next time I will use milder cheese and mix some barbeque sauce in with the meat, because it was a little bland the first day, but much better the second day.

Read the reviews and altered the recipe a little. Turned out moist and delicious. My husband loves meatloaf and he raved about this one. I even ate two slices and normally only one. I added white panko bread crumbs, used sharp cheddar cheese and 1/4 c. chives, 3 greean onion thinly sliced, garlic powder, 3 shakes of paprika, 1 shake of celery seed, 2 squirts of ketchup, 1 squirt of mustard, then I made into loaf size, but baked in a 13 X 9 glass cake pan putting, 1/2 c. water around edge of loaf and covered with foil for first half hour. I also set oven at 375 not 400. Baked about 1 hr. 10 min. Served with stewed tomatoes with macaroni in them and wheat rolls. Turned out ecellant. We loved it and will defintely make again. Sending to all my kids to try.

This was delicious. I made it this way: 1 lb turkey 1/2 c milk  1/2 c + 1/4 c bread crumbs 1 egg 1/2 tsp salt @ 1/3 lb cheese, shredded 2 small onions 1 carrot a little celery some broccoli stems  I blended the veggies in the food processor to make them nice and small. I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed the 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs into the milk to plump them, then I added the other 1/4 cup later to help bind it together since I had added all the veggies. The cheese gave it a nice richness, but since it was shredded it wasn't the main feature.   We really enjoyed it made this way, and my husband wants to have it twice a month! :-)

Very Good! Added Barbecue Sauce, Ketchup, Garlic Powder to spice it up a little! Results were fantastic. I also used Cabot extra sharp cheese for some variety.

This meatloaf was awesome.  It was so moist!  I was afraid to use a whole cup of milk cause I thought it was too much, but it turned out fine.  I did use chicken instead of turkey cause that is what I had on hand.  I added some diced white onion and minced garlic.  Per other reviews, I also added 1 t. Worcestershire sauce.  I only used a 5 oz. package of Kraft Cheddar & Monterey Jack cheese bites and that was plenty.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Vadalia Onion BBQ sauce.  I will definitely make this one again!

I loved the cheese melted throughout the meatloaf, but we thought it was bland even after adding garlic powder and no-salt seasoning blend.  The spices definitely need to be kicked up a notch or two because the cheese was the best flavor of the loaf.  I love cheese, but there should be other flavors present as well.  I did not add ketchup to the top, next time I will do that (or tomato sauce) to meld in.  I really think that will help.  I will certainly make this again but with a few changes.  I will also cook it less time, maybe 45 minutes instead of an hour.
Update:  Made this again with added spices and ketchup on top but still found it bland. And the turkey just gets too dry even cooking it less time. Won't make again, sorry.

Turned out amazing! I did, however, make modifications... I had less meat on hand and had to also modify the proportions but it turned out incredible. In the words of my husband during his first bite, "Oh my god...this is amazing." Actual recipe used: ~1.3 lb ground turkey, 1/2 cup milk, 1 egg, 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs, 1-2 tsp of italian seasoning, 2-3 tbs bacon bits (this was soo good to add), 1/2 -1 cup small chunks cheddar, 2-3 tbs bbq sauce, 2-3 tsp crushed garlic, dash cayenne pepper, tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1-2 tbs dried parsley, mash all of the above well with a fork, add to loaf pan, top with bbq sauce, settle in fridge for few hrs, bake at 400 for 40-60 min, cookie sheet under for drips, ENJOY!

This recipe has been a hit every time I make it. I have made a few modifications that may warrant consideration for those that like a little heat. First I use a half and half mix of Turkey and Beef chop meat (I even used venison once, and it really cut the gaminess and gave great flavor) One other change I made was to use Monteray Jack cheese with Jalapeno, cut up into 1/2 in squares (the trick is to freeze these then fold into the mixture, that was the cheese stays whole when cooking and does not soak into the meat completely) Yum. Lastly I make into indivudual size meatloafs by using small loaf pans and top with a four cheese red sauce. Just to finish off I throw a few pieces of the frozen jack on top for a little melted cheese on top effect. I hope you enjoy my version. Bon Appetite! PS Every loves getting there own personal meatloaf right from oven to table. Makes less mess too :)

This recipe is great as is, but definitely add some grated zucchini and carrot as suggested. My whole family loves this - even my picky toddler. Adding the veggies adds a sweetness that is surprisingly good!

Very tasty, but like the rest of the reviews I added onion, worshestire, garlic, & crushed red pepper.  I also soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk.  The turkey came in  a pack of 1.25 lbs so I reduced down 3/4 cup milk & breadcrumbs.  To kick it up a notch I mix a little bit of korean chili paste into the ketchup to go overtop.  Used a mix of diced and shredded cheese.  Very good and much healthier than traditional meatloaf.

this meatloaf is excellent!  my husband asked if i could cook it from now on, and i didn't think he liked meatloaf.  i soaked the bread crumbs in the milk for 2-3 minutes and it was very moist.  great recipe!
UPDATE:  Ive been making this once a week for a while now.  My husband STILL gets excited when i make it. I put a whole onion, 1-2 tablespoons minced garlic, and whatever cheese I have- it IS better if you cube it not shred- and i have never had it bubble out of the pan.  For the topping i mix ketchup, barbeque sauce and brown sugar, this gives it a little kick and browns really well.  I found that cooking in a glass loaf pan is so much easier to clean and it doesn't stick to the sides as much either.  Make this meatloaf!  You will love it!

The only changes I made to this recipe were adding a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce to the loaf, and mixing in approx 3 Tbsp. of cranberry-orange chutney to the ketchup (had some leftover from Thanksgiving that needed to be used up). I only had a block of white cheddar on hand, so I used that instead of colby. This was the best heartburn-free meatloaf I've ever had!

It was definitely a unique version of the meatloaf that I am used to. My kids liked it a lot but me and my husand prefer the old-fashioned way. Thanks for the recipe, tho. There was nothing wrong with it. Just wasn't our taste. But it is a good kid friendly meal for toddler like mine who won't eat anything.

We Really Really liked this meatloaf! I added roasted poblano peppers to it. I had Jalapeno Jack as well as Fresco Queso on hand. The cubes held together and we got a nice cheesy bite along with the chili flavor. I used Lipton onion soup mix to give it even More yummyness. Thank you Brooke! I will do this one again.

I loved the flavor of this meat loaf. I didn't have any italian seasoned bread crumbs so I just used plain panko and added dried oregano and basil...and also some garlic salt because I'm an addict.  I also took others advice and added a clove of garlic plus a sprinkle of onion powder. I mixed everything together minus the cheese, meat and ketchup. Once it sat for five minutes I added the turkey and cheese.  I tested the flavor first by making a very small patty with the mixture and cooking it up in a frying pan. This way if I don't like it I can doctor it up before cooking the whole meatloaf. No adjustments were needed!  I would even enjoy this without the cheese if it were to come to that. But I always have tons of cheese on hand. :)

I'm not much of a meatloaf fan but this was soooo good!  I did add some shredded zucchini and carrots to mine. I have passed this recipe on to 3 people just in the last couple of weeks.  It's a definite do over.

I've made this several times since my original review with much better results. I cut the recipe in half and use only 1 lb of ground turkey. It has made its way into my regular rotation, and I've given the recipe out to a number of friends.   The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I want to make it again without repeating a few mistakes that I think I made. I took a lot of the advice in other reviews: soaked the breadcrumbs, added lots of spices, subbed bbq sauce. So it was good, but I don't think the turkey was thawed enough; it was a little mushy in the middle. I also want to cut down the turkey a bit. 2 lbs was waaaay to much for my fat-draining loaf pan. I got positive enough feedback from my husband and parents to try it again.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I had really high expectations for the flavor. It didn't taste as great as I thought it would. It was still really good though, just not as good as I'd expected. I halved the recipe, and I also added 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix like some of the other reviewers did. It gave it a good flavor, but next time I think I'll skip it. I also used shredded cheddar cheese. I will try cubed cheese next time. Mine was done in about 52 minutes. I did not put the ketchup on before I started cooking it because some reviewers said it burned and almost caught their kitchen on fire. I took the meatloaf out of the oven after about 40 minutes of cooking, put the ketchup on, and cooked for about another 10 minutes. I also cooked this in an 8 x 8 square glass baking dish so that it would cook more evenly. The recipe was pretty good overall, my husband liked it. I would make it again with the few minor changes I mentioned. **EDIT** Ok, I have to change what I said before, because I have perfected this recipe. I've made this 3 or 4 times now. I bought a glass loaf pan and it seems to work pretty good. I only use 1 lb of ground turkey since it's only my husband and I. I use cubed cheese - that makes all the difference. Shredded cheese in this recipe is just not right. This is now my favorite thing to make and eat. My husband LOVES it! I make it with homemade mashed potatoes. It's awesome. And it's even more awesome the second day!

This recipe was very, very good!  I cut the recipe in half because it was just myself and my boyfriend.  I added 1/2 chopped onion and finely shredded carrot.  I loved the cheese suprise inside the loaf.  I will make this again, no doubt about it!

This was just o.k.  The texture turned out a little mushy, like dog food.  I added some italian seasoning and garlic, as well as a chopped onion, worchestire sauce, and I grated my cheese rather than cubing it.

As the others have said this was so easy and I managed to please my 2 1/2 year old twins and husband with this.  They couldn't get enough.  It was great the first night and second night as left overs.

I did add a few dashes of worcheshire into the mix.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 an onion.  I used med sharp cheddar cheese becuase it was what I had on hand.  I think I will try mild next time or even the colby as the recipes asks for.  

I halved the recipe and the cooking time was only 45 minutes.

I will definetly make it again!

Loved this recipe. My husband who is a traditional meatloaf guy loved it too. Said it was better than regular meatloaf. My boys who make the hate meatloaf face when they hear it's what for dinner loved it. I followed the recipe exactly. So all you cooks out there who have meatloaf hating kids, try it you will be surprised!!!

Great! I wasn't sure about the ground turkey, as it can be a bit bland. But it was flavorful and tender. Because I am on a low cal diet, I omited the cheese. This recipe was tasty enough without it. Insted of ketchup I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Perfection.

Absolutely the moistest meatloaf ever. I used shredded cheese and a package of schilling meatloaf seasoning in my loaves(I doubled the recipe to share with extended family)I also used ground chicken instead of turkey. You really can't go wrong with the variations. Everyone raved, and took meatloaf sandwiches to work the next day! Thanks for this great staple recipe!

Not sure how to rate this.  It was good, but just not what you expect when you eat meatloaf.  I think if I make it again, I will not use the cheese cubes, only shredded cheese.  The gobs of cheese (and I love cheese) were a little wierd.  Good, but not great stuff.

OMGOODNESS! This IS the best meatloaf I have ever made! Eventhough the recipe asked for 2lbs of ground turkey, I only had a 3lb pack, AND i added a 1lb pack of ground lamb.   WOW, it turn out full of of flavor, richness from the lamb and moist.   Again, THE best!  I omitted the ketchup and made beef gravy and onions for the meatloaf with a side of red creamed potatoes and steamed green beans.  

This is my first time ever posting anything online, but this recipe was soo worth it!   Thanks again for the recipe, a definite keeper!

My husband and I loved this recipe but I changed it quite a bit to add more flavor.  I took the advice of another review and added about 3/4 cup of a chopped yellow onion, 1 tablespoon of Worchershire sauce, 1 small can of mushrooms and then I used barbecue sauce on top instead of ketchup.  I paired it with carrots, squash and potatoes all baked in the oven for the same amount of time.  It was delicious and my husband and I both loved it.

Wow - this is crazy delicious!  We added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoon of garlic salt.  I think the packages of turkey I had were more than a pound, so two packages made enough for two loaves. We did one with BBQ sauce and one with ketchup.  This will be a regular at our house!

I have been an All Recipes member for over five years and never experienced the result I have experienced tonight!  There was sooooooooo much liquid, it was bubbling out the top.  The cheese was burning on top of the loaf.  When I cut into it, it was like cutting into oatmeal.  I don't know why this recipe got such a high rating.

I made this tonight and was pleasantly surprised. It stayed moist and everyone asked for seconds. I cut the recipe in half, and cooked it for 45 minutes. I took the advice of others and added some garlic, Italian seasoning, onion powder,  and worcestershire. I also used barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, and shredded cheddar cheese instead of cubed. It was soooo yummy and we will be making it again soon!

This was delish, even according to my picky 3 year old.  I only had 1.3lbs of meat, so had to adjust the recipe slightly.  I added more spices and a handful of oatmeal also.  And on top I criss crossed ketchup and carolina style BBQ sauce.  Came out so good and moist!

I followed this recipe and it came out very mushy! It had a good flavor, but I want a more firm meatloaf. I will try it again and see if it turns out the same.

I made this for a potluck and everyone enjoyed it. After reading thru reviews I did make a few suggested alterations.
1. Added a packet of Onion soup mix. Omitted salt and pepper.
2. Beat egg and milk together and soaked the bread crumbs in this.
3. 2 cups of Colby/Jack cheese blend(shredded)
4. Mixed ketchup and bbq sauce together for the top coating.
5. Divided and made into 2 loaves and baked in a 13x9 inch pan.
It was wonderful, and I will be making this again very soon.  Thanks for the gr8 recipe.

Very delicious recipe! My 12 year old daughter and her friend said they don't like meatloaf, until I had them try this recipe. What a hit!!! I used monterey jack cheese instead, because I didn't have Colby jack, and added italian seasoning to plain bread crumbs, which turned out just fine. I love the little pockets of cheese throughout, it was so delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This didn't turn out well for us though I really wanted it to.  I ended up cooking it longer than normal to try to get it to firm up.  The flavor wasn't bad, the texture on the other hand was terrible.  It was too moist and downright mushy. My husband had a good point that we grew up on our grandma's "depression era" meatloaf. Perhaps our expectations of what meatloaf should be just didn't mesh with this version.

I thought it was wonderful. I didn't have all the ingredients, so I used 4 cheese Mexican cheese blend shredded cheese. I also didn't have Italian bread crubs, so I used plain with some basil from my garden and some dried oregano. The flavor was very yummy with the fresh basil. I want to try the recipe as is (except using my fresh basil)

I have made this recipe a million times and it always comes out great!  The cheese is definitely better shredded, and sometimes we wrap the meatloaf in bacon before baking.  Recently, for a change, I started using beef instead of turkey, bbq sauce instead of ketchup, and topping the meatloaf with french's fried onions.  Both ways are great!

This was very moist and flavorful. The only things I added were a packet of dry onion soup mix and garlic salt. It did need to cook a little longer. I will definitely make this again!

This is the first recipe that calls for ground turkey that my kids and I actually enjoy, it tastes great.  After reading many of the reviews, I altered it just a bit.  I soaked my bread crumbs in the milk prior to adding it to the meat, I shredded 1/2 lb. of colby and folded it in.  I forgot to add the worcestshire sauce, but I will do that next time.  Instead of ketchup I put a thin layer of bbq sauce on the top.  I made two loaves instead of one.  Cooking time was about 50 minutes.  Next time I will try cubing the cheese, but the shredded tasted fabulous.  I also added a shredded carrot and half an onion.  My kids are the world's fussiest eaters.  No one asked for seconds but they ate everything on their plates, which is a major accomplishment in my house!

Fabulous and a great healthy alternative to beef.  My husband does not like onion and does not like catsup on meatloaf so I made a few changes.  I added A-1 sauce to the meatloaf mixture which gave it a "beefy" taste and made two loaves instead of one and rubbed olive oil and more A-1 sauce over the tops and sides to give it a very nice crust.  Alway moist on the inside!!

(I also combined the bread crumbs, egg and milk together first and let the crumbs plump up before adding it to my ground turkey)

Great recipe.  Made it earlier in the day and cooked it later.  Put barbeque sauce on top instead of catsup.   Everyone in the family ate it. Tasted better the second day

We liked this recipe. Similar to others, I used garlic powder, onion powder, and worchstershire sauce and loved it. we also used cheddar and liked that fine since we didn't have colby on hand.

So good! It might be a solid 5 with Colby cheese, I used Cheddar and it was VERY good but maybe could have been better. The chunks of cheese were a good change to the regular meatloaf I make. I used more salt and pepper than recipe asks for.

Def will make again - hubby loved it!

really great easy dinner idea. I added onions and worcestershire sauce to the turkey and it added a nice kick. Its really moist and delicious. I made mash potatos and green beans for sides... didn't need a sauce because the loaf was so moist.

I have made this meatloaf 3 or 4 times since I found the recipe a few months ago. I have a made a few changes to it that have made it even tastier, I add an onion and about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. I tried adding chopped carrots, but they made the whole meatloaf taste like carrots and they turned out soggy. Will be using this recipe again and again.

The whole family enjoyed this meatloaf.  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, so I used plain and added italian seasoning and garlic powder to the mixture.  I also decreased the milk by 1/2 cup and the meatloaf was plenty moist.  Thanks for a great, flavorful, turkey meatloaf.

I didn't have a block of cheese, so I used shredded. I also added garlic, some worcestershire sauce, dried parsley, and brown sugar to the ketchup. My husband said he could eat this at least once a week for dinner!

WOW! This was fabulous and I don't even really like meatloaf!  I made this for my bf who was wanting a good meat and potatoes meal. This is what I did... I halved the recipe and used one pound of 93/7 ground turkey, added half an onion and one red bell pepper both finely chopped.  I used shredded mild cheddar cheese just because that it what I had on hand and also added some additional spices such as garlic and worcestshire sauce.  On top I put a combination of ketchup and A1 steak sauce.  I still baked for an hour and it came out delicious!  The only things I might change next time is to use sharp cheddar cheese for more flavor. Deliciously moist and flavorful.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.

Excellent!  Made this evening and my husband loved it - and he is not normally a meatloaf fan.  I followed the recommendations of several reviewers and added the following: couple dashes worcestershire sauce, 2 cloves minced garlic, about 3/4 cup minced onion, and BBQ sauce for the glaze instead of ketchup.  I used non-seasoned bread crumbs, so I added 2 Tbsp italian seasoning as well.  Served with rosemary garlic roasted potatoes and a caesar salad.  Will make this one again!

Had to substitute with feta cheese, which I didn't care for. I took the advice of some others and added bbq sauce on top. That was an interesting twist, but unfortunately didn't go well with the feta. Otherwise would have been delicious!

I only tried this because of the reviews, not because I normally like meatloaf.  It's amazing!  It's so moist.  I can't wait to make a meatloaf sandwich with it today!  I will make this again and again.

1.  I whirred wheat crackers in the food processor to make the breadcrumbs more healthy (and flavorful).
2.  I added a little Italian seasoning to make up for the lack of it in the breadcrumbs.
3.  I topped it with barbecue sauce instead of kethcup like Mimi's cafe does.  WOW!

Lovely recipe, who would have thought ground turkey could evolve into such tastiness?  I did alter the recipe as others suggested.  This is what worked for me:  Added 1/2 minced onion, soy sauce, garlic, and various Italian-type seasonings to the turkey mixture, and I topped with ketchup/BBQ sauce mix.  My husband loved it and he declares to hate meatloaf usually.

I thought with all the rave reviews I might finally find a use for ground turkey that I liked. Nope. I am sure the recipe is fine, but still tastes like ground turkey and does not firm up like beef. I even added the extra spices, etc. others suggested.

Great Recipe - I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I used dry stuffing mix instead.  Worked Great.

This is a great recipe!! I sometimes have a hard time metablozing beef meatloaf, so i decided to try something different. And this worked for me. The family loves it, it tastes amazing,simple, easy to make. the only thing I did different is i used sharp cheddar cheese instead of colby. there are never any leftovers with this one!

I made this last night for supper and everyone LOVED it! I did read the recommendations and added the following to the recipe: 1/2 an onion diced, 2 garlic cloves minced, 1 tbsp of worchestershire sauce and then used BBQ sauce on top. I am always looking for good ground turkey recipes and this one was delicious! Will definately make again! I would suggest if you make this to use the cubes of cheese instead of shredded because you get yummy gooey pockets of melted cheese! So good!

This recipe is so good!  I add additional ingredients that would be found in a traditional meatloaf like grated onion and worcheshire sauce and swap panko bread crumbs since it's what I have on hand.  I think any which way you prepare this recipe it's great!  Everyone in my family loves it and that is not an easy thing to accomplish.

I bought some ground turkey and was looking for some recipes to make with it.  After reading all the fantastic reviews on this recipe,I said, how could I go wrong, I have to make this.  OMG was I wrong.  They absolutely did NOT like this at all.  While it was very juicy, I will not be making this again.

Really good, very moist. My kids liked it because it didn't have onion or tomato paste in it like traditional meatloaf. I also shredded the cheese like other reviews, and added BBQ sauce to the top instead of ketchup.  I will definitely keep it on the menu for the kids! Thanks!

This was good, but just tasted like a turkey burger to me. I only used half the amount of the cheese, and it was shredded. I think it would have been way too heavy if I used all of it.

Love this recipe. I made a few adaptations: I used sharp Cheddar instead of Colby, used the ninja (Food processor) to cut very small pieces of onion and red pepper. I have also done this with carrots and onions. Both were excellent! Also, for a little kick on top mixed the ketchup with barbecue sauce.

I made this almost exactly like the recipe except I used shredded colby jack cheese instead of block cheese. My family loved it! My 3 year old son is a little picky at dinner but he asked for seconds when I made this! I'm very happy I found the recipe.

I JUST made this and I have to say it was delicious.  I grated a small onion into the mixture, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I was skeptical that it would have enough flavor judging by the ingredients, but it had A LOT of flavor.  I am happy to have found this recipe and will definitely be making this again.

My kids loved it.  I modified it a bit though.  Kind of combined the best of several recipes out here.  I used 1.6lbs of lean ground been.  A bit more bread crumbs (probably 1.5 cups).  Little less milk (skim).  Once in the loaf pan, I added a couple tbs of wisticher sauce, then covered with a thin layer of brown suger, and then a layer of ketchup.

This recipe was very tasty.  That said, I agree with many other reviewers that the pan boiled over and created some smoke thoughout my kitchen/house.  Also, I may have packed the pan too full because it took more like 1 h 20 min to cook.  Also, I didn't have a meat thermometer (won't do that again!) so I really wasn't sure when it was 100% done.  Next time I will 1) Cook the meatloaf in a bigger pan so it doesn't boil over 2) Make sure I have a meat thermo on hand 3) Add ketchup in the last 15-20 min so it doesn't burn.  All in all, it was very yummy and cheesy!

I can't really rate this yet, but I will.  I can't wait to try it.  I have looked for a long time for a good turkey meatloaf as I am allergic to ground beef.  From the reviews, I know it will be wonderful.

I made this and I thought it came out very good, the only thing I did differently was use shredded Montery cheese and egg beaters.  I think the next time I might add sauteed onions and mushrooms to the mix.

Really good.  I did not have enough turkey so I added shredded zucchini and a carrot as suggested by another reviewer.  The cheese bubbled over the pan and started on fire in my oven as well!!!!  Next time I am going to back on a cookie sheet.  Super yummy and my nephews loved it!

My husband loved it, and I didnt. I'm not too big on turkey though. It was perfect how the cheese oozes out like other reviewers mentioned. I also added BBQ sauce to the top. I'll probably make it again.

Overall very good meatloaf.  My husband does not like the flavor of turkey in any meal that is meant to have beef and he even ate this, always a winner.  It would have been five stars but it definitely needed the added spices and such that others meantion in their reviews.  I added in 1/4 cup sweet onion, 3 Tbsp Worschtiescher (sp?) sauce, 2 Tbsp of seasoning salt and garlic.  It honestly could have used a bit more of each of these.  The cheese was good, but definitely not as strong a flavor as I anticipated.  Overall good flavor and I will make again, very easy!

This is a great way to cook ground turkey, I often think it tastes too dry if I just turn it into a hamburger but the meatloaf keeps it moist and scrumptious! My husband loved it and he is picky about his meatloaf.

Not impressed. For the amount of money I had to spend on the ingredients, it should have been much better. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything at all special.

This was really good. Took advice of others and added sauteed onion and garlic, along with a couple generous splashes of Worcheshire sauce. I shaped into 2 loaves and cooked them in a roasting pan at 400 degrees for 1 hour. Didn't use the topping but only because I was short on time, normally do a ketchup/brown sugar and mustard combo and really like it. Huge hit with the family, said it was the best meatloaf I'd ever made which is really saying something since I make a pretty mean beef meatloaf. Loved the cheese aspect and I really recommend you do it in chunks as recommended.

Healthy dish. It is lighter with the turkey than traditional beef. I did not change a thing with this. My wife liked it too!

This is srcumptious!!  All that cheese is to die for!  Even when left out, this still makes a fine turkey meatloaf!

Amazing!  I added some chopped white onion and it gave it just a little bit extra flavor to make it perfect!  Can't wait to make it again!

I made this for my boyfriend and parents and they were "very impressed" with how delicious it was. Now my mom is asking for the recipe. Definitely use shredded cheese over cubed. Being of puerto rican decent I am big on spices. I added fresh chopped garlic, onion powder, dash of worcestshire sauce, touch of cayanne pepper, italian seasoning, basil, garlic powder, and oregano. Then I mixed ketchup and BBQ sauce to throw over the top of it. It was the best meal I've made to date. Thank you for this recipe!!

The best hands down.  Added Chopped onions, garlic, worcestershire sauce, and I shredded the cheese.  Several people have had this now and they all say it's the best meatloaf they have ever had.  I don't let them know the secret (cheese!)

This was wonderful recipe to use as a start to your own!  I used my own bread crumbs, made from the last part of an herb bread from our favorite bakery.  I added chopped celery, chopped onions, and chopped mushrooms.  Topped with BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  I used shredded cheese instead of cubed, it's what I had in the house.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times- both following the recipe exactly (and w/ minor modifications).  It's absolutely delicious!  I generally halve this recipe but use slightly more ground turkey (as it comes in a 1.2 lb pkg).  I omit the salt, as there is plenty of that in the cheese and the flavor is unaffected.  This is a fantastic meatloaf recipe that's gobbled up by my toddlers and hubby alike.

I literally just started teaching myself how to cook, and this recipe was so easy and fabulous. My boyfriend and his roommate used the word "amazing" and trust me, they were not just being polite. I used garlic & butter croutons for bread crumbs. I didn't use quite as much cheese because I thought it was a bit much. It was fabulous.

I made this using extra lean ground turkey and one package of pre cut cheese cubes from Kraft. By using the extra lean ground turkey you can dramatically cut down on calories, fat and cholesterol.

It's awesome. Very easy to make, even by a novice like myself. I was a little thrown off by the cheese, but it turned out great. I added onions and garlic, and it was good. I've made it twice and my family loved it.

This was the best turkey meatloaf I have ever had and I have tried a lot!  I took other suggestions and added chopped peppers and onions, a little worcestershire and garlic powder.  I also used shredded cheese.  I shaped them in mini loafs and grilled them.  I brushed b-b-q- sauce on the tops.  Will definately make again!!

This was a keeper!  Used sliced Colby cut up in chunks & I didn't have italian breadcrumbs.. so I added some dried oregano, parsley & garlic salt to them and did a few splashes of Wish. sauce like others did.  Also added about 2 tbsp of brown sugar to ketchup... made half the amount & it turned out great - and I am not a fan of meatloaf normally!!!  This is going in my personal cookbook!

I make this recipe once a month! it's amazing! I did modify it after searching through all the reviews. I soak the bread crumbs in the milk in a separate bowl. I season the turkey with the S&P and also garlic powder & onion powder. I also add worchestire sauce and some ketchup to the mix and a dash of soysauce. i usually use two bags of shredded cheese. I also add some other things. I chop up carrots, zucchini, onion, and garlic very finely and saute them with some olive oil with kernel corn (if you can get fresh it's even better) saute just until u think its good u'll know! then i mix everything together top it with ketchup and put it in a loafpan and bake as directed. everything comes together so well and the vegetable mix it so well, if you have kids they'll never even notice that they are eating so many veggies in this meatloaf!

I added my usual onion, celery, and bell pepper combo adding up to about 1/2 - 2/4 cup in total and used some Dubliner cheese because it was there in the fridge.  This is the best meat loaf I've had in forever!

Mmmm, delicious.  I’ve never had meatloaf before (I know...what kind of American am I??) so this cheesy turkey delight was the perfect introduction.  A few things to note:  1) I didn’t put ketchup on top, I put a sweet & spicy Hawaiian sauce and it was awesome  2) I didn’t fold the cheese cubes into the loaf.  I dislike folding cheese in, because I find that it leads to disproportionate amounts of cheese in each piece (obsessive compulsive much?) – I like to have each piece have the same amount of cheesy goodness, so I poked the cheese in evenly after I put it in the loaf pan.  This way, everyone is cheesily satisfied!  Great recipe, thanks!

This recipe was absolutely delicious with a few modifications. I followed the instructions of other reviewers and added minced garlic, onion, worcestershire sauce and used barbeque sauce instead of ketchup. I did use cubed cheese as the recipe called for. The meatlof was very flavorful and moist. It came out great. But, beware! The cheese is going to spill out so make sure you put something underneath the loaf pan. I used foil to catch any spills and it worked perfectly. This recipe is definitely one that I will be using again and again. My boyfriend and I enjoyed this dish. It was great the next day as well.

This recipe was amazing! I was a little bit skeptical about leaving the cheese in cubes, but I tried it and it worked out perfectly! I recommend this method, because it really allows the flavors of the cheese to meld together into the meatloaf. However, do be aware that by only cubing the cheese a large portion of the liquid rises to the top during cooking, so about half way through, I pulled out the meatloaf and soaked the grease off of the top. When it came out if was perfectly moist! Really recommend this!

This was better than expected!  Followed directions as written except shredded the cheese.  Next time I will leave it as cubes -- the cheese flavor got a little lost.  Very moist -- my husband didn't realize it was turkey and my 3 yo loved it.  Will definitely make again.

This was good. I used one package of turkey..1.3 lbs..and used only one egg and less breadcrumbs and milk. I also added worcestshire. Sticky when mixing, so wet my hands in cold water which seemed to help. Formed it in a loaf pan, and then dumped it out into a 13 x 9 pan coated with foil for easy clean-up, and no cheese drips in the stove. Will make it again!

We loved this.  I took a few other reviewers' tips and made slight changes, but for the most part, made as listed.  Added 1/2 large onion to the mix & 4 garlic cloves.  Added about 1 tsp pepper instead of 1/4 t tsp.  Added about 1 T worcestershire sauce. Made into 2 loafs, 1 with ketchup, 1 with BBQ sauce; both came out tasty.  Served with  mashed potatos.  Very moist.  Lighter than beef meatloaf, but really tasty & who can resist all that cheese?

I thought it was pretty darn good, but the leftovers didn't heat up very well. The only change I made was to use shredded colby jack cheese as that was what I had on hand. I think I would have given it five stars if I would have followed my instincts and used the ketchup and brown sugar topping instead of just ketchup. I will probably try it again with the different sauce.

I took other reviewers' advice on the following points: I grated the cheese, soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk, and added a bit of onion, garlic, and worchestershire sauce to the mix.  In terms of yield, I used 2.3 pounds of ground turkey and divided the recipe between two loaf pans, which worked very well.  I also topped the loaves with sweet barbecue sauce before baking and would highly recommend it; however, spread the sauce only to within 1/2 inch of the edge of the loaf to avoid barbecue sauce baked onto your pan.  Overall a great recipe; thanks, Brooke!

I've made this twice now for my family in the last month. They LOVE it.  I also added Worstershire sauce a tad heavier then called for. I also added fried onion to the top.

Beef boullion is the only thing I would add. My family doesnt really like ground turkey, but as long as I add in the boullion (1 tsp to 1 tbsp per pound) they think it tastes just like ground beef. Also if you dont like chunks of onions, onion powder works just as well if you add enough of it.

Wow! This is a fantastic recipe! I added a carrot and an onion to this recipe. I used leftover garlic croutons (mashed up into small pieces) instead of the bread-crumbs for half of the recipe and it worked great. I also grated the cheese, but I think next time I'll cube it instead to see the difference. Very moist and a great flavour. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent dish!  I didn't have Italian breadcrumbs so I used Garlic and Herb Breadcrumbs and I added extra seasonings from my cabinet...other then that I followed directions exactly...I soaked the breadcrumbs in milk like everyone suggested...My man woke up in the morning telling me about my meatloaf and how he dreamed about it.  LOVED IT!  Will definitely make again.

I now have a meatloaf to please everyone!  We added hot pepper sauce because we add that to everything and the onions as suggested by other reviewers.  Very filling - next time I will eat slower - great for teenage boys!

Kid-friendly! Used shredded cheese and Sweet Baby' Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. I'm not a meatloaf fan, but this rocked! Going in keeper file. Served with zucchini boats. Nummy!

This was sooo good. I used montery jack b/c that's what I had. I also added some spices like others mentioned and soaked the bread crumbs in the milk. I forgot the ketchup on top but don't think it needed it. It did overflow my loaf pan. I think next time I'll try using a different pan.

My fiance loved it, but I thought it was a little bland. Next time, I'll add some garlic, onions and Worcestershire sauce to spice things up. I topped it with the sauce we love, from the Lemon barbeque meatloaf from this site (1/2 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon prepared mustard, 1/4 teaspoon cloves and 1/4 teaspoon all-spice) and lemon wedges.

I think this turned out very well.  I tweeked it a little, with the help of other reviewers' suggestions.  I let the breadcrumbs soak in the milk, and by the time I went to add it to the meat mixture, the crumbs had soaked up ALL the milk.  That was fine, it folded in easily.  I omitted the salt altogether and just used  1 teaspoon seasoning salt instead.  I cut back on the cheese a bit, per the suggestion of a fellow Wisconsinite :-).  (I'm from Wisconsin too, and if a Wisconsinite says it's too much cheese, it's too much.)  I used about half a pound a cheese.  I added half an onion, 12 petite baby carrots, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and two tablespoons worchestire sauce.  I added a couple tablespoons brown sugar to the ketchup topping.   I think next time I'll leave out the brown sugar.  The ketchup by itself is just fine.  I'll definitely make this again.  Next time I might try A-1 instead of Worchestire sauce (another reviewer suggestion).

Made this evening.  The best thing about this recipe is that fact that it was very moist.  First, I took the advice of other reviewers and combined the bread crumbs and milk -- let that sit about 10 minutes.  In the meantime, I sauteed about 3 minced garlic cloves, half cup of shredded carrots, cup of chopped onions and a handful of minced spinach [all stuff I had on hand and wanted to use] -- all in olive oil.  It reduced nicely and smelled amazing. Let it cool.    I combined the turkey meat w/ the breadcrumb/milk mixture, worchestire sauce, egg and cheese [I used a Mexican shredded cheese combination mixture that I had on hand].  Carefully, I added the veggie saute making sure that it didn't overwhelm the other ingredients.  I dressed the top of the loaf with a marinara sauce.  It was very moist but a little short on flavor - I did not added the S&P as I did during the veggie saute -- probably could have used the S&P as well as the BBQ on the top.  But, really good.

Good basic recipe, but I changed it a bit to my liking.  I reduced the cheese, but think I will eliminate it next time - it really isn't needed and just ups the fat content.  I also used crackers and italian seasoning instead of bread crumbs.  I added in 4 ounces of carrot puree, some onion, and a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce as well.  It was a hit with my family.

First of all, this was easy to make- always a plus in my book.  And I like that it used pretty healthy ingredients.  Here's what I did different.  I grated about 5 or 6 baby carrots into the mix and chopped one bunch of green onion (I needed to use up these ingredients). I also had many slices of colby jack cheese so I cut those into squares and folded that into the mix.  I didn't have any spilling out all over the place, but there were still "gooey" cheesy spots!  Lastly, I mixed almost equal parts ketchup, worcestershire, and a reliable bottled bbq sauce to spread on top.  My only complaint about this was I wanted more.  Instead of a thin layer on top, I would have liked this taste to be throughout the meatloaf.  I may try just adding more glaze on top next time or maybe serve a side of the sauce.

I'm on a low carb, low fat, high protein diet, and this fit the bill.  Tastes great, and really healthy.  The only downside is the amount of cheese.  It makes for really good eatin', but it almost counters the low fat of the turkey.  I just cut back the cheese a little and I was good to go.  Good food.  MAKE IT!

I love this recipe.  My only recommendations would be to use either shredded or cubed cheese depending on your desired cheese density.  Shredded cheese allows for a more even distribution, and cubed for larger pockets of cheesy goodness.  Make according to taste.  :)  I also added garlic.  I'm rating 5 stars for ease of recipe (hence the title) and for the tastiness of the dish.

We just ate this for dinner and we loved it. My husband isn't a meatloaf fan and he said it was really good. I made a few changes. I added some additional seasonings to keep it from being bland. I added a little onion powder, garlic salt, a dash of smoked paprika, and a couple of shakes of worchestshire sauce. I mixed the ketchup in the meatloaf as suggested. This meatloaf was so moist we'll never go back to ground beef meatloaf.

Very nice loaf.  Added garlic powder & onion powder (1t), otherwise followed rest of recipe.  Leftovers cut into really nice slices the next day to wrap and freeze.  Will be making again, liked as much as the traditional beef meatloaf.

I love ground turkey and don't think I will go back to eating ground beef!  This meatloaf is so moist and tasty.  When it was just about finished cooking, I put BBQ sauce on the top and put it back in the oven for about 5 more minutes.  The BBQ sauce added a great flavor.  Will definitely make this again...and again!!

I only had plain bread crumbs so I added about 2 tablespoons of Italian Seasoning and sweet basil. Instead of ketchup on top I used steak sauce which turned into a really nice crust like topping. This was delicious but it did look a little strange to see chunks of cheese in the meat. Next time I'll hide vegetables like shredded carrots and zucchini in it as well. Great and easy recipe!

My substitutions, made out of necessity: water instead of milk, plain instead of Italian bread crumbs, shredded instead of cubed cheese, small can of tomato sauce instead of ketchup on top.  Added one packet of onion soup mix, a spoonful of minced garlic, and left out the salt.  Baked it in a casserole dish instead of a loaf pan, at 350 for one hour.  It was delicious, easy to customize, and I'll definitely be making this again!

Another good meatloaf recipe and I too shredded my cheese which in this case was Monteray Jack. I can't not add my usual garlic and onion powders and opted to top the loaf with barbeque sauce instead of catsup. Enjoyed by all Brooke and thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly, but all my cheese seeped through the top and bottom so there wasn't much inside. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I thought it was great, though. My husband gave it a 3 and I thought it was a 5, so I split the difference and gave it a 4.

Best Meatloaf ever! Will never go back to beef. I've made this 3 times, tried it with  shredded and cubed cheese. Cubed is by far the best, you get warm gooey little pockets of cheese throughout. I add Worcestershire sauce to the meat, garlic powder and leave  out the salt. I mix ketchup and brown sugar for a  glaze for the top. Yummy!

This recipe was great, only giving it four stars because I took the advice of other reviewers and added the following: bbq sauce, dash of worchestire, grated carrot,  and onion.  I also halved the recipe, it tasted better than any ground beef meatloaf I ever made, my friend dropped by for some and came back the next day to  have leftovers with me.

This meatloaf was awesome.  I only used half the milk and one egg, otherwise it would  be too runny.  I also added 1 envelope onion soup mix and increased the cheese to one pound.  Did not add ketchup (always tastes weird in meatloaf) I also bake my meatloaf on a cookie sheet, it seems to hold together better.  Loved it!

Very good recipe! I took others' tips and added a grated carrot & zucchini, diced onion, a bit of worstershire sauce, 1-2 teaspoons of onion soup mix, seasoned salt and garlic powder. I also mixed a bit of ketchup into it and put some on top. It turned out delicious and very moist. I will definitely make this quick-prep recipe again. My 2-yr old also loved it.

I must say this is the best, most flavorful and moist turkey meatloaf ever.  I used a full 16oz pkg of shredded cheddar instead of 3/4 lb. colby cubes and added additional 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  I will be using this recipe regularly.  Thanks for sharing it.

This meatloaf is amazing.  I think it tastes better than any beef meatloaf I've had.  I took other users' advice and used shredded cheese (only had cheddar on hand).  I also added ketchup and grated Parmesan cheese (reduced-fat) to the top before baking which made a nice crust.  I will most definitely make this again.

This was super yummy. I only changed a few things for mine. 1st i used 1/2 a tsp of salt and 1/2 a tsp of cajun seasoning. Also i used a little more pepper then it called for. I also added about 1/2 a cup of French Fried Onions 
and some bell pepper. Seriously it was our first try at Turkey meatloaf or really turkey anything and we all were very impressed.

Best meatloaf we've ever had.  My 2 and 4 year olds ate it too.  We used shredded cheese instead of cubed cheese.

A very good turkey meatloaf recipe.  I subsituted instant potato flakes for the breadcrumbs because I didn't have any on hand, and I omitted the ketchup.  I put a thin layer of BBQ sauce on top before baking and it came out great!  We loved it.

There were so many reviews where people changed this recipe drastically, yet so many others where people made the recipe pretty much as stated and loved it... what to do? I decided to try it as written. (It was hard not to add onions and garlic!) That being said, we found it to be fairly bland. Not bad, mind you, just on the bland side. We will eat the leftovers no problem; it is good. However, if I made this again, I would spice it up. I didn't have any spill-over in the oven, but I did drain off A LOT of liquid when it was done. (It was definitely moist!) As well, I cooked the loaf for 1.5 hours. (The internal temperature was only 160ºF. A few similar recipes I found online said it was safe to eat "when the juices run clear", rather than waiting until 180º.) I probably won't make it again, only because 12 ounces of cheese (even reduced-fat cheese, which I used) adds a lot of fat back in, sort of negating the whole purpose of using turkey in the first place.

I made this the other night, and it was fantastic, even though I did make a few minor changes.  I didn't have any colby cheese, so I used sharp cheddar, cut into small cubes, a little bit of chopped onion, and I made a ketchup/mustard/brown sugar glaze for the top.  It was so moist and the leftovers made superb sandwiches.  Thanks so much for an awesome alternative to regular beef meatloafs!

Fantastic! My bf said after his first bite, "this is a KEEPER" and after 1/2 way thru it he added "possibly the best meatloaf I've ever had". I did make a few changes because of what I had on hand. Didn't have 2lbs ground turkey so I used my 1.25lb turkey package and added a 12oz roll of Jimmy Dean's 50% Less Fat pork sausage to make the 2lbs. No colby so I used the cheddar I had. I also added 1tsp of minced garlic and 1Tbs of worcestshire sauce. Topped it with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and bacon strips that needed to be used up.

This is my most favorite meatloaf recipe ever.  I think I have made it 4or 5 times since I found it here, each time tweaking it a bit.  I typically use fresh bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Italian seasoned dry bread crumbs.  I also add about 2 tsp worchestershire, ½ cup diced onion (sautéed first, if I have time), and about 1 tbsp minced garlic.  My favorite cheese in this is shredded pepper jack (about two cups).  The peppers really make it zippy.  For the top, I use a combo of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar (70/20/10). I just eyeball the amounts.  And sometimes I’ll add slices of turkey bacon on top. Great recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did make some of the changes recommended- I some worcestire sauce and shredded cheese but the basic recipe was just the best.  Super easy, too.  I always make this meal when someone has a baby, etc. and everyone asks for the recipe.  My kids even love it and they are 3 and 1.

This was pretty good.  I liked the chunks of cheese in it.  I would've called it 'turkey cheeseburger meatloaf'.  The oils from the cheese seeped out the edges/bottom and gave a nice crispiness to the outside edges of the loaf.  My only changes were adding some additional herbs, a small chopped onion and I used cheddar cheese.

This was very good.  I too added onion, green pepper, worcestershire sauce and a variety of spices.  Also added one package of BOCA meatless ground burger.  It helped to bind the meat and add a little flavor.  Topped with a generous amount of BBQ sauce.  Used fat free shredded chedder for the cheese.  I'm sure it wasn't as creamy and cheesy as with whole cheese, but it was still very good and reduced amount of fat.  Tons of leftovers for sandwiches.

This is delicious! I have never been a big fan of meatloaf but this is incredible, cheap and quick to make. I'm sure I'll make this time and time again! I followed the recipe and also added some oregeno and lots of Italian seasoning. This was sooo good!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  We have three young children, and they loved it too!  We did mix the ketchup in w/ the meatloaf & added additional ketchup and brown sugar on top.  We also added a small amount of onions to the mix.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good basic recipe.  I did make a few changes -- I added one chopped onion, fresh chopped garlic, and two teaspoons of poultry seasoning.  I also used less cheese and worchestire sauce rather than ketchup.  It came out very moist and tasty.  I have always been skeptical of typical "american" food but I really enjoyed this!

Good! I used shredded cheese instead of cubed (all I had), and I think it would have been better cubed. I added a little barbecue sauce to the ketchup on top and it was very tasty! :)

Having only made beef meatloaf, I was skeptical about how turkey would come out--but this recipe is delicious.  I marinated the turkey in a dash of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce for a few hours beforehand.  It was very fast to make, and came out light and moist.

This was so delicious! And I don't even like meatloaf!! I did change a few things: used ground chicken instead of turkey, and substituted cheddar cheese and less of it. Really good, even the kids ate it (ages 4 and 15 mos)!!!

We really like this recipe. After making it a few times, I decided to go through the comments and tweaked a few things that made it awesome! Soaked the break crumbs in milk for a few min before adding anything else, added garlic powder, onion powder, Season-it-all, couple shakes of Worcestershire, 2 T Baby Rays BBQ sauce. spread a thin layer of same BBQ sauce over the top of the loaf before cooking. SO moist and Kids were even going back for more!

Excellent recipe.  Most people who like to cook change recipes according to what is on hand and to taste.  The basic recipe works for that and always turns out well.  I added chopped onion and minced garlic cooked in olive oil and cooled to the mix.  The method of soaking breadcrumbs in milk is the key to the recipe.  All I had was panko bread crumbs so the spices I used were seasoned salt, pepper. Garlic powder and thyme.  I followed the rest of the recipe, placed half of the mix in a loaf pan, layered roasted, seeded and chopped Polano peppers over that and added the rest of the mix, topped with plain catsup.  Oh so good.

Not terrible but no seasonings at all but salt and pepper and no onion made it extremely bland. If I had been thinking, I would have tweaked it before baking. I may try it again and add a sauteed onion and probably Worcestershire sauce.

Great recipe! I made a few changes. Instead of milk I used light cream. Added red pepper flakes, minced garlic and garlic powder to give it more zip! It came out delicious!

My favorite meatloaf recipe.  I use barbecue sauce instead of the ketchup & I always use shredded cheese instead of cubes.  Amazing!

I enjoyed this meatloaf very much, although I did coat it with BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. That was the only change I made, it was a nice change from regular beef meatloaf.

Great recipe! I have my dad's recipe for meatloaf with ground beef that my family loves. But we have been trying to eat healthier and cheaper with ground turkey. This recipe is great! I did add chopped onions, Worcestershire sauce and some garlic to the meat mixture. And used barbeque sauce instead of ketchup. This is a very moist and tasty meatloaf. Thank you!

This is going in my dinner rotation! I made the following alterations because of my likes and what I had on hand: added 1 small diced onion, garlic, shredded cheddar cheese, cajun seasoning, and I mixed BBQ sauce with the ketchup. It was delicious!

Since making this recipe, my family won't go back to beef meatloaf! It's now part of the weekly rotation. Everyone who first tries it says, "Ew, TURKEY meatloaf?" But after that first bite they're hooked. I usually add some Worcestershire sauce to the mix for flavor, and sprinkle with basil when it comes out of the oven. Perfect!!

I have made this a dozen times and my family loves it!  I use bagged shredded cheese and I put the BBQ sauce on the last  15 minutes of cooking.   I also add some spices such as thyme, sage or whatever else that will make it awesome!!

I loved this recipe, but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I altered it quite a bit to achieve the result I wanted.  I added a half packet of Lipton onion soup mix (I know, I know - lots of sodium but I don't add any salt that way) and also a dash of hot sauce (we like things spicy in my house).  Also I shaped the loaf into a "meatloaf" shape, but placed it in a cake pan so that if it dripped and oozed it'd drip back into my pan. Oh, and I used shredded cheese rather than cubes.

This was delicious and very easy. I made the recipe as written but ended up making 1 minor change before adding the cheese. After mixing it all, I added more bread crumbs by sight (maybe 1/2-1 cup) bbecause it wasn't holding together. After that, it all came out beautifully. I put a cookie sheet under it, after reading othere reviews where there were issues with cheese bubble over, but I didn't have any problems with that at all. Maybe the extra bread crumbs helped? Regardless, the taste wasrich and cheesy,  just a little something fun and different,  but definitely worth a shot.

Very good meatloaf. Added just a dash of garlic and onion powder for a bit more flavor. I used shredded cheddar instead of cubed colby. Came out delicious, and we'll be using this receipe frequently. I might tweek the seasoning and different cheeses also.

By far the best meatloaf I've ever had. Everyone that has tried it, absolutely loves it. I have made this recipe time and time again. I recently started making a healthier version and didn't include the cheese. It is still delicious and still getting request to make it again.

This is really good if your family doesn't normally like meat loaf! To adjust for my low carb diet, I crushed French Fried Onions and added in place of bread crumbs. Also I added Old Bay Seasoning (I put it in everything!). I put a cookie sheet underneath, just in case of boil over.

OMG! Surprised what a hit this was with my kids. First words from my daughter were "I don't like meatloaf".  Three helpings later she says "I LIKE this meatloaf".  Thanks for the great recipe.  I substituted the bread with panko breadcrumbs, used shredded cheese and add a little worsteshire, minced garlic, red onion, and Italian seasoning.

So moist and flavorful! I added garlic salt and fresh ground black pepper.  I also included some catch up in the mix not only on top. Served went to turkey gravy salad green beans and lemon Parmesan potatoes. A great, great dinner.

I have been making this recipe for years now.  It is one of the few meals loved by my entire family, including my ultra-picky kids.  The recipe as is calls for a huge quantity of cheese that is not required.  I use 1/3 or less than what is called for cut into small cubes and the meatloaf comes out very moist, cheesy and delicious every time.  I use old cheddar instead of colby.  Reducing the cheese improves the nutritional value and has far less calories and fat (230 calories per serving vs. 440 calories).  I occasionally add grated zucchini or carrots if I have any on hand and the kids don't even notice.  This recipe makes 2 full meals for my family of four (plus some leftovers).  It freezes very well.  Last night I made it in muffin tins so I could freeze the leftovers in single serving portions.  They turned out great.  Cooking time was cut in half (40 min vs the 75 min it takes in the loaf pan in my oven).

I read through quite a few reviews before making this and didn't have Colby so I cubed up some velveeta and it was really good. I did grate in some garlic and also added worcestershire sauce. All in all and it was a really good recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt 1 cup of milk was way too much and I had to add a lot more bread crumbs then the recipe called for. I will make this again but with less milk.

Really good and easy meatloaf.  Hubby loved it, and he hated meatloaf growing up, but this is a little different from what he's used to.  I did change up the recipe a little bit.  I used 1lb turkey, 1/2lb beef, and 1/2lb pork.  I added steak/burger seasoning, minced onion, and garlic powder.  And just to be sure it was cooked all the way through, I baked it for 1hr 20min.  Yummy!  Oh, and I followed the advice of others, and cubed the cheese.

Used Maltese Mom's recipe extras (it's my biological last name so I had to try!) and added celery and peppers, and a little Sambal (because we're addicted to it). Very Very good recipe. Made some palak paneer with tofu for the side dish and Great Success!

Sale on ground turkey this week!  I made this and just changed up two of the ingredients.  I used what I had on hand.  I used shredded mozzarella instead of colby and pizza sauce instead of ketchup on top.  I added italian seasoning in the meatloaf to make it more italian.  My family said this was one of the best things I've made.  I consider myself a good cook and cook daily for 20 plus years...so this is a compliment!  My husband is gluten free and thought it tasted like pizza.
Thank you Brooke for the recipe.

Good, but really, just a basic meatloaf recipe. To take it up to five stars, I omitted the salt and added 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 3 cloves minced garlic, a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and 2 teaspoons of dried basil. I also freshly shredded some colby/jack cheese (instead of cubing it). It was very moist and delicious with these additions. Another thing I often do with my meatloaf is to cook a few strips of bacon, crumble them and add to the mix - really makes the whole dish spectacular!

This was pretty good... It's probably more of a three star to me but since I completely forgot the milk (eek!) I wonder if would have been a little better with the milk.  I only made two changes on my own.  I added onion and used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  I like some of the reviews that suggest adding more seasoning but I didn't feel it lacked too much with the BBQ sauce on top.  Just a little dry which is most likely my fault!  If the boyfriend likes it ok I'll try it again with the milk next time!

I make turkey meatloaf with swiss cheese and fresh grated nutmeg. The swiss cheese makes it very nutty-tasting as it browns with the meat.
1 small can evaporated milk and 1 egg and 1 cup of crumbs is the other difference. No other sauces needed and ketchup will kill the taste.

This was amazing! Although I made some changes as well. Instead of 2 pounds of ground turkey, I used 1 pound of chicken & 1 pound of turkey. 1/2 of yellow onion, 1 green bell pepper, 2 eggs, 1 pkg of shredded cheese, salt, pepper, milk, bread crumbs, olive oil & bbq sauce. Same as the first review, I let the of milk & bread crumbs sit while I mixed all the ingredients together then added it to the mix at the end. I used the olive oil on the pans to keep it from sticking too much. I just made this last week for the first time and it was a hit! I will definitely be making this more often! :-)

Delicious and so easy to make. I used only 1/4 lb of cheddar (it was all I had) and added 1 tsp of dried chopped onions (and a little bit of extra salt to make up for less cheese). I also cooked it for about 10 mins longer to be on the safe side (I don't have a meat thermometer). The final product was very tasty and not at all dry. I will definitely be adding this to my regular meal rotation!

I might make it again but use a smaller amount of grated cheese, not big cubes.  By the time it was cooked, the meatloaf was swimming in a pool of grease.

This recipe is a favorite of mine, my family loves it. I just want to forewarn you to add more seasoning of your choice to the turkey mixture, otherwise it will be super bland.  I love the creole seasonings so I always add a few (3 or 4) shakes of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, about a clove of minced garlic, a diced onion, and a diced bell pepper. I also add a little brown sugar or honey to the ketchup topping, sometimes I just put a honey barbeque sauce on top. This recipe is definitely a keeper :)

Fantastic recipe! I've never been a fan of meatloaf but my 7 year old came home one day and requested it after something she saw on TV. I obliged but looked for a turkey alternative since I do not eat red meat. I'm so happy to have stumbled upon this! I wish I could give it more stars. I did alter the recipe slightly though, I grated up a whole large onion, a few carrots, and a couple zucchini's as well as I used mozzarella as this is what I had on hand in my house. I also used a BBQ sauce on the top as the idea of ketchup just didn't float my boat. This recipe made quite a bit of food! I did one standard meatloaf tin as well as an entire mini cupcake pan for the kids, which came out really cute and would make a GREAT appetizer or finger food for a pot luck! The meatloaf came out very moist and had a ton of flavor. Served with a caesar salad, which made a very filling and delicious dinner. My mother even asked for the recipe. I will definitely be making again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I really love this recipe,  I do change it up a bit.  I use oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, I have been doing this for years, my daughter does it too.  I also use dry ranch dressing mix about 3 to 4 tablespoons, as well as the other seasonings.   I use different types of cheese, I love feta cheese in this.  like other reviews mentioned, I use a sweet bbq sauce instead of the ketchup on top....yummmy

I really liked this.  But necessity is the mother of invention as they say, and I really had to improvise.  I had a pound of ground turkey breast that needed to be used, and this came up in an ingredient search.  I halved the recipe since I had only a pound of meat.  I had no breadcrumbs.  But I did have a ground mixture of corn flakes and provolone CheezIts that I used to coat chicken earlier this week.  I subbed that mixture for the breadcrumbs.  I also added a handful of shredded carrots for moisture, and I added finely chopped onions and red bell peppers...just a bit of each, for flavor.  I had only sharp cheddar, and I added less the full amount..didn't really measure.  I don't like ketchup alone as a topping for meatloaf, so I mixed homemade whole-grain honey mustard and ketchup.  The end result was very tasty, and I'm glad I found this recipe.  I'll definitely make again.

first time I tried this recipe, I attempted to use a regular recipe that I always use (that included adding ketchup to the meatloaf mix) and it came out falling apart. I then tried it exactly as the recipe called for but still added, 1/2 cup chopped onions, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and used creole seasoning salt instead of regular salt. added a little bit of basil and rosemary. it came out wonderful. had dinner guest over and they were sending pics to their friends. will use this again and again.

My husband and I really liked it and it was easy enough to make for a weeknight meal. I did do a few things different. Like cooks befor me I added chopped onion & garlic to the turkey. Instead of cubes I shredded the cheese and used a little less because we do not like ketchup on our meatloaf so just befor it was done cooking I put cheese on top. It was yummy!

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this. I loved the cheesiness in particular. A little too moist, so I'll cut back on the milk just a bit next time, and I added a splash of worcestshire, because I don't believe in meatloaf without it. Hoping to make again this week or next. =) Served it with peas and homemade biscuits.

This was a great rainy day fall dinner! My husband and I have been married for 10 years and he has never raved more about anything I've ever made!  Obviously, he has raved to more people as well as I've have had multiple requests for the recipe.  Per other's comments, I made the following additions:  a few dashes of worcestershire sauce, a clove of minced garlic, onion powder and glazed with a mixture of BBQ sauce and brown sugar instead of ketchup.  I served this with buttered corn and potatoes for a good comfort food dinner.  Very important note:  Put a cookie sheet under the loaf pan as the cheese bubbles out!  Next time I will line the cookie sheet with foil as to make clean up easier.

I was weary that my red meat loving guys(2 sons and my husband) wouldnt like this because it is turkey....but they LOVED it! I shouldve made more! All three of them had seconds, and I was very pleased! So easy to make. I used gluten free bread crumbs, so it was easy on my belly to eat as well, it was very good!!! Will make this one of my go to recipes for sure!!

I really liked the flavor of this.  I did make some minor adjustments 1.5lb ground turkey, 1/4lb cheese, 1 fine chopped shallot, and hand full of chopped fresh mushrooms.  Plus added about 1Tbsp of Worcestershire and left out the milk completely. Baked for 50 min and then added ketchup to top and baked 10 more.

I really liked this recipe! Thank you. Instead of using the recommended cheese, I also used shredded cheese because it is all I had and I also changed from ketchup to BBQ sauce. I had never had meatloaf in my life and had never made it, so this was a great easy recipe!

I totally love this recipe though my pregnant wife didn't handle well mixing everything together :). I added 1/4th a red onion, 1 mushroom, and diced up 1/4 cut red peppers to add to my mix and the results were amazing. The only thing I think i'll do next time is shred the cheese or gut it into thinner slices.

This recipe is easy and wonderful. My boyfriend is VERY picky and he had three servings and can't wait to eat the left overs for lunch and dinner! I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added grated onion (about 1/4 cup), 2 pressed garlic cloves, worchestire sauce, and mixed brown sugar in with the ketchup before I topped the loaf with it. You definitely need to make sure you put a pan under this because it will drip! The cubed cheese made delicious cheese pockets throughout the loaf. I will be making this often! Thanks for sharing!

I have been looking for a Turkey meatloaf recipe for years.  My husband doesn't eat beef but loves meatloaf and most recipes don't quite turn out right.  This recipe is a keeper!  My husband made it himself and it turned out delicious!

SO delicious! Halved recipe, followed recipe almost exactly.  I just added some garlic powder (eyeballed amount). I also did a shortcut on time by forming meatloaf into 4 mini squares.  (to get dinner on the table sooner!!) I cooked them for 20 minutes. Was skeptical, and not sure if they would be juicy but it SO was, will use this over and over again!! Simple and yummyyy!! :-)

Easy and delicious! Just how I've always made my meatloaf - except I include 1/2 a sauteed onion and some kernal corn into the mix. Instead of folding the cheese in, I top the loaf with shredded chedder cheese and cover it with ketchup before popping it into the oven. Great with regular chop meat too.

I would give this a 5 but if made as is I think it would be bland...but then again I prefer my food with LOTS of spice, etc. I added onion, garlic, worst. sauce and pepper jack instead of colby : )  And as someone who has NEVER ate ketchup with meatloaf I added it to half and it is so much better that way!!!!

a great and simple recipe!  i made some subtle changes, but they probably aren't necessary.

i used panko (it is what i had in the pantry) rather than italian bread crumbs and i soaked them in the milk (as another poster suggested).  i did add a bit of A1 as well as some sauteed onion and garlic.  i used cheddar cheese cubes b/c i already had some in the fridge.

The idea behind this meatloaf is great, and parts of the loaf had great flavor.  I loved the pockets of cheese that seeped out.  There was way too much meat in this loaf, which gave the meal an unappealing texture.  Neither me nor my husband could finish ours, but surprisingly the kids did love it.  IF I attempt this again, I will be using only half the amount of meat, and the same amount of all the other ingredients.

Changed a couple of things.  Used sweet onions, shredded carrots, and panko bread crumbs.  On the top mixed ketchup, worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar together and spread this on the top. It was delicious.  I made it a couple of hours before and then put it in and took the kids swimming and when we got back it was ready.

It was good, I'd like to see a little more variety in texture so I may add less meat and more actual bread crumbled next time. But it was good!

I made this delicious meatloat for Easter and everybody thought it was really good and asked for the recipe! One of my girlfriends that asked for the recipe, said her husband really liked it and doesn't normally like her meatloaf. Like someone else mentioned, I used shredded cheese instead of blocks. Like others, I soaked the bread crumbs in the milk which I thought would give it some density. I found that it the meatloaf tasted a little bready, so next time I'll probably decrease the amount of bread crumbs or not soak them. I didn't use the ketchup, but will do a ketchup-barbque mixture next time.

After a few tries with this, i made a few changes. i use 8oz of cheese, rather then 12oz, and we use shredded cheese instead. The kids really hated huge hunks of cheese. Also, we don't do the ketchup topping, it's nasty. And third, make sure you place a cookie sheet w/ foil under your loaf pan, or you can end up with a nasty mess! I just read about adding onion soup mix, we'll have to try that next time.

I followed mostly.  I used shreaded cheese instead of cubed.  I also added some brown sugar to the ketchup topping.  It does make it a tad sweeter, but with the turkey I dont know if it really needs that sweetness.

We all loved this recipe!  I used chunks of mozzarella cheese since thats all I had. We all really liked it!  My husband liked it so much better than the traditional meatloaf I make because he is not a fan of onions and bell peppers. I will continue to cook meatloaf this way!  Very tasty and soooo easy!

Followed suggestions of other reviews to create my own recipe. Used shredded instead of cubed, but I used casserole cheese instead of colby. Added seasonings I have used with other meatloafs that were always a hit with the family. Garlic salt, sea salt, and 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning. Chopped an onion, and as the topping I used a local favorite, that I probably shouldn't mention here, if you know Cincinnati you know what I mean :)

So delicious.... not mushy or dry.... perfect 
consistency!  I did add 2 cloves of chopped garlic and a small onion grated into the mixture.  I used shredded cheese blend and it worked great!  So yummy and I'll definitely make again : )

My family just loves this recipe.  I do quite a few substitutions to liven it up:

First off I cut the servings in half, so if you are using 2 lbs of turkey...double the measurements below
Add 1 pckg of Beefy Onion dry soup mix from Lipton

Substitute the ketchup for chunky salsa...it seems to bind the loaf better

Also, my family really loves anything w/ a garlic flavor so I add a tablespoon

I really don't like salsa, green peppers, or raw onions, but I really like the way it tastes in this.  It gives it so much more flavor.

We loved this recipe and even though we forgot the cheese, it was great. We will probably keep making it without. We used a standard package of turkey 1.3 lbs. and reduced the ingredients accordingly. We also split it into 4 small loaf pans and cut the cooking time to 30 minutes!

Love it!  I hate ketchup on top of meatloaf so the only thing I changed was that I put 4 strips of bacon on top when I baked it instead of the ketchup. This recipe is so easy and I will definitely be fixing this again and again!!

This was a great way to use ground turkey in flavorful way.  My husband is not a fan of turkey, but when I made this recipe he said "Wow, this is actually good".  I also used this same recipe for burgers and meatballs, with some changes to the spice.  cheese seems to be the way to go with turkey.

This was amazing but I made a few changes.  I added 6 table spoons of A1 to the mixture along with 1 tsp of Worcestershire  sauce.   Rather than use cheese cubes I used grated Colby Jack and only 1/2 pound.  Still was very cheesy.      Tonight as I cook this again I am experimenting with left over turkey gravy from the holiday replacing the milk.  Also covering the loaf with the same gravy.  We shall see and I'll let you know!

I used a pound of turkey and a pound of ground pork...I took the advice of another and grated carrots, half of a sweet onion, and four garlic cloves into the mixture as well as soaked the bread crumbs in the milk...bought a block of colby-jack and shredded it...I topped with a mixture of ketchup, honey BBQ sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper for a lil' kick...it was delicious.  It makes 2 loaves so you can definately half the portions...a

Came out great!    Followed the recipe and added a packet of Onion Soup. Didn't have Colby, so I used White American. Not too fond of Ketchup, so I mixed it with Steak Sauce and it came out terrific. It also got me to sign up as a member. Thanks for this gem.

This reminded me more of a cheesy turkey patty than a meatloaf. The intent of using turkey was to create a healthier version of meatloaf, but I didn't realize exactly how much cheese was being added until I made it. It all got eaten and it is not bad, but it needs some kind of seasoning to give it that meatloaf taste. It was interesting to make, but not something I would take the time to make for dinner again.

I use a lot of organic, ground turkey and was running out of ideas. Found this and LOVED it. I never follow a recipe exactly and this was no exception. I don't have a loaf pan so I made burger patties instead. I shredded carrots, spinach, cheddar cheese and zucchini into the meat. I also threw in chopped onions, garlic and a bunch of seasonings. Instead of ketchup, I used barbque sauce and worstershire sauce. I omitted the eggs, milk and bread crumbs. In the center of each patty, I squished in a few cheese cubes and I baked them until they were JUST done. They were AWESOME!!! Juicy, flavorful. Holy cow! Thank you for the idea with the cheezy goodness, and I'm glad I read the other reviews about the bbq sauce and shredded veggies. I will make these once a week.  :-)

My twin 4 yr old boys and wife along with myself loved this.  I did make some changes and added chopped spinach leaves and grated carrots to it along with another reviews suggestion of onions, worchestershire, seasoned salt and a few other spicees to it and used cheddar instead of colby since that is what I had.  It turned out great, the family got some vegetables, a good meal, and full stomachs.

I did try this for the first time for a pregnant friend and her husband and they absolutely flipped over it! I used my own barbecue sauce instead of ketchup. They are still hounding me for some more and the baby is 2 years old now!

It was yummy.  We added some chopped onion and a teaspoon of minced garlic to the mix, and we added brown sugar into the ketchup.  We used cheddar instead of Colby Jack.  Everyone at the table enjoyed it. That's rare.

I was looking for a way to use up some ground turkey and stumbled on this.  I had everything on hand except the colby, so I subed some shredded cheddar.  I also halfed the recipe.  The meat mixture was really wet, so I added some more breadcrumbs.  I thought it was just okay, but I gave it 4 stars, because it was even better the next day.

I love it. it was easy and the kids asked for seconds. instead of doing cubed cheese I used shredded cheese. I took some to work and they loved it as well. I also used bbq sauce instead

This grew on me...at first, it didn't seem exceptionally great, but after a while, the flavors grew on me. And when we reheated it the next day for meatloaf sandwiches, I was surprised by how much better it was the second time around. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly. I did not like this meatloaf...unfortunately. I am a huge fan of cheese but did not like this. I don't think I want cheese in my meatloaf ever again or breadcrumbs. Not for me.

Very Delicious! The only thing I did differently was add some worchestishire sauce and minced garlic and chopped onions. I added a little garlic and onion powder as well. The Colby Cheese was an excellent touch. It turned out really moist and delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

Since we're trying to eat ground turkey more verses ground beef, I wanted a good meatloaf recipe to replace my old one... which I knew would not work for ground turkey. I LOVE how this turned out! As always though, after reading the reviews I decided to change it up about. So, here's the changes I made to the recipe (as per what other people suggested). I soaked the bread crumbs in the milk before mixing it in with the turkey. I used shredded colby jack cheese, because that's what I had. I substituted garlic salt for the regular salt. In addition, I added half a grated zucchini (which came to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup), one clove minced garlic, and chopped sweet onion (also about 3/4 cup). I added 1 tsp of mustard and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the ketchup glaze. There was no way it would fit in my loaf pan either, so I just grabbed my 2L pan and shaped my own loaf. Hubby wasn't as impressed as I was, but me and the kids liked it

This was indeed a hit! Both easy and tasty! I followed the recipe and added the worthshire, garlic, onions, and lite ketchup that the others recommended BUT I decided use sharp cheddar, mozzarella, and swiss cheese shredded and peeled an apple and cut it into small pieces so that it would cook down nicely. The end result was amazing! My husband who is a meaty meatloaf fan was shocked and now states that this cheesy apple turkey loaf was tastier then any other meatloaf EVER. We will definitely be having this ALOT!

I too had an issue with the cheese overflowing on to my oven element. I think next time I'll take the advice of some previous raters and put this in to two dishes or just cut the recipe in half. It was so delicious!!! Loved it.

Yummy! I also changed a few things after reviewing other's comments. I added garlic (lots, I love garlic), a tbsp or so of minced shallots, and I used a mixture of ketchup, BBQ sauce, and soy sauce for the glaze on top. I also had to use a shredded colby mix, but the inside was still cheesy and gooey.

My husband loved this - and he's not a fan of "fake" ground beef.  He loves meatloaf but now when I ask him if he wants meatloaf for dinner he requests this - which he calls turkey loaf.  I did make my own bread crumbs and added some italian seasonings.

This is the best turkey meatloaf recipe I have ever tried. I chopped up onion, garlic and carrots in the mini-food processor so making this was a cinch. Even my 2 year old ate it!

I followed the directions exactly except we did not top with ketchup since my family doesn't like it.  It was too moist when finished, to the point the loaf was falling apart and there was a lot of liquid in the loaf pan.  Also, the seasonings were quite bland.  Ground turkey has no real flavor and the seasonings in the bread crumbs did not do much.  I'm willing to give this another try but would consider decreasing the milk and cheese and perhaps even cutting out the egg whites to decrease the moisture in the loaf.  Also, adding more of the seasonings already present in the italian bread crumbs (parsley, oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, thyme, etc) would probably punch up the flavor a bit.  I like meatloaf to have a bit more substance and would have liked to see more freshly chopped onions, garlic, etc.  The recipe has potential but when I made it exactly as described it was only worth 2 stars.  Next time I will try some of the other reader's suggestions to see if I can improve it.

After making a few changes suggested by others it turned out pretty good.  I added frozen chopped onion, frozen chopped bell peppers and minced garlic.  I subbed dressing mix for the bread crumbs which I soaked in the milk.    I'm not eating red meat for awhile so this will satisfy my meatloaf craving.

Yummy.  Ground turkey has become my new obsession thanks to this recipes.  I add half a chopped onion, a handful of baby carrots chopped, about a cup of rolled oats.  I top it with 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup of Heinz chili sauce, a couple tbsp. brown sugar, 1 tbsp. vinegar and some worschestire sauce.  I make four mini loaves.

Really yummy! I use sharp chedder instead of colby for extra flavor. This is only good with ground turkey though. I tried it one day with beef and di not like it at all! I coat the top with Ketchup mixed with brown sugar and worstershire before I bake it. It turns out awesome!

A family favorite. I make it with a 20 oz package of ground turkey, add two shredded carrots, and then slightly decrease the milk and bread crumbs.  An 8 oz package of shredded cheese is plenty.  And it yields 8 generous slices!

I really liked this easy to make meatloaf. I made a few modifications so that it would fit into our eating habits.   I made it to serve 4 rather then 8 and I used turkey BREAST, egg WHITE, FAT FREE shredded CHEDDAR cheese and Bandana's Sweet & Smoky BBQ Sauce instead of ketchup. I also used one of the recomendations of mixing the wet ingredients with the bread crumbs & letting it sit for a bit before adding to the meat.  Making it with those modifications made it so that the per serving fat grams were only 2.25 compared to the 26.8 in the original recipe. It did bring the per serving carb grams up to 20.13 compared to the 17.4 in the original recipe. And the protein grams were slightly increased to 46 compared to the 37.5 in the original recipe.  All in all this was a GREAT recipe that I will make again.  And the fat free cheese melted just fine as well as tasted wonderful!  Thank you for a new meal addition to my menu arsenal.

I loved this!! I made the following changes: soaked bread crumbs in milk for a few minutes before mixing in, added 1/2 of a chopped onion, omitted salt and pepper, only used 1/2 pound of shredded cheddar cheese, and topped with BBQ sauce. I pressed this in a 9x13 pan and baked covered in foil for about 50-55 minutes. It seemed to be PERFECT! Thank you for the suggestions!

We make this about every three weeks - kids and adult guests request it.  I recommend adding 1/2 onion, and making the topping as follows:  1/2 c ketchup, 1/2 c BBQ sauce, plus 2 T brown sugar.  Use about 1/3 of that to baste - once halfway through and once about ten minutes before it's done.  Reserve the rest for sauce - I promise, kids will love this!

Exceptional meatloaf! Kids loved it! I did use shredded cheddar instead cubed. I also sauteed and added 1/2 of a diced onion and a 1/2 diced green pepper. I also added garlic salt instead of plain salt and also about  tsp of cumin. Very good!

Loved this meatloaf, made it last night for dinner. Since my husband and I are on a low fat diet, this was the perfect meal. I did sub. fat free cheddar cheese for the Colby, egg substitute, and I added a 1/4 cup salsa. Looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

This was fantastic! Naturally, I made a few changes. Here's what I did: I used 1 1/2 lbs. of turkey, rather than 2.. just because it fits in my loaf pan better. I used 3/4 c. of crushed butter crackers [instead of bread crumbs], soaked those in 1/2 c. milk. I had to use shredded cheese because it's all I had on hand but I would love to try this with cubed cheese. I used half sharp cheddar, half colby. I added a lot more spices than just s&p. I threw in some oregano, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder. Mixed all that up together and threw it in my loaf pan. For my glaze, I used Honey BBQ sauce with some brown sugar stirred into it. Baked at 400 for 1 hour and 20 minutes. So, so, so good. Everybody in my family loved this.

Very good meatloaf.  I made this for my family and everyone went for 2nds.  The only change I made was, less cheese, and BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  Will make again.

This was a pretty tasty recipe.  I used 2 pounds of leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  It was already cooked, so I just put it in at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes as thats when the cheese melted (I had plenty of shredded cheese so I used that).  Perfect consistency.  Although I think next time I'm going to add at least some onions, maybe garlic and some herbs for extra flavor.

I was told to put this on the "Make Again" list, which is the sure sign of a recipe that hits a home run!    DH not only likes it as a hot meal, but it makes great sandwiches for lunch, too.

Made the recipe exactly as written, but also read the other reviews and added several dashes of worcestershire sauce, finely diced onion, and garlic powder.  Instead of topping it with ketchup, I used fire roasted salsa.  Delicious!

First time meatloafer here!! Whoop. I chose this one hoping the turkey would constitute it healthy//err. I cut it in half but put it in my reg. loaf pan, which seemed alright but it shrunk when it was done?? Weird. Anyways, baack to the recipe..I used what I had, seasoned bread crumbs, shredded cheese two flavor cheese [[from Costco]] an added adititioal seasonings with my homemade italian dressing mix. OVerall it was good, I really liked the cheese part I sprinlked on top but my lil brother didn't . He did however eat  all but two or three slices, pretty swell for him. Thanks for posting, Brooke.

I'm giving it 5 stars because of the cubed cheese idea.  I have made meatloaf several times before with shredded cheese and I could hardly tell that it was there.  I loved biting into the yummy bites of gooey cheese.  I definitely recommend that you cube the cheese.  I did add some onions & green peppers that I softened in a little olive oil, and recommend that as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was good, even though I'm not a big fan of ground turkey. It seemed a bit dry to us, but that was probably my fault since I got busy doing yard work.  Used shredded cheese and that worked nicely.

This was a big hit with all that had it. I made it for my father who is home dying of cancer and he shared it with his pastor and they all loved it. It is very filling and there was enough for left over meatloaf sandwiches the next day. I will definately make this again and again.

I have been trying to find some ways to incorporate more turkey and less beef into my family's meals, but we did not care for the flavor or texture of this meatloaf.

Yum! I also took advice from some of the other reviews--I added a half onion, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika to the meat mix. Instead of folding in cheese, I used shredded mozzarella and made a layer of it in the middle and then put more meat mixture on the top. To finish it off I spread on a thin layer of BBQ sauce. This came out so delicious I will def make it again!

LOVE this! I STRONGLY suggest putting a generous layer of tin foil under the loaf pan in the oven when you cook this, it does overflow! I did make some alterations to this recipe...I soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk for 5 min while I chopped half a large onion, 3 cloves of garlic and shredded one carrot. I then added it all to the turkey along with the rest of the ingredients called for. Instead of ketchup for the top, I used bbq sauce. It cooked for 1 hour 6 minutes and came out soo moist and delicious! Definately a keeper!

Super easy and delicious! I used part feta cheese and part colby, added some garlic powder and a little shredded carrot, baked for an hour and it was perfect. This goes well with a sweet potato casserole. The meat loaf makes a great sandwich the next day too!

This was a very good meatloaf...very moist and flavorful, I only had plain bread crumbs which i soaked in the milk while i cut the cheese up, then i added basil and italian seasoning to the mixture along with a little bit of worcestershire sauce. Came out perfect. Thanks!

This was incredibly simple and quick to put together. The flavor was okay, but could have used some more seasoning. The cheese did run all over my silpat, so next time I'd add shredded cheese instead so it would incorporate better. Not the most amazing meal, but because of the simplicity and being a good base to add more flavors to - I'd try this one again.

This is so good.  I followed the recipe for 1 lb of turkey meat, substituted the milk with Goya Sofrito and used seasoned salt.  Cooked it for 45 min.  My boyfriend doesn't like meatloaf and was hesitant to try it but when he did he took seconds. Very easy and will continue to make.

This was *THE* best meatloaf I've ever eaten!  I did follow other reviewers advice of soaking the breadcrumbs in the milk, and I'm sure that added a lot.  The other alterations I made were adding (couple dashes of each) Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, crushed red pepper, 3/4 C chopped onion, 1 clove minced garlic, substituted kosher salt for regular salt, shredded the cheese, and covered with classic BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  My fiance raved, and we both would make this easy meatloaf again in a heartbeat :)

This was a wonderful and easy recipe. As suggested I added half an onion, 2 tsp of garlic and Worcestershire sauce.  I used Molly’s suggestion and put a tray to catch the juices.  I am so glad I did. Thanks Molly. I would make this again. The only change I would make is add the barbecue sauce when its half way done and use less of it.  I used too much.  This one is a keeper.

An easy, delicious weeknight meal! I skipped the ketchup topping and added a little more cheese (shredded rather than cubed) to the top after it came out of the oven. Keep an eye on the time/temp as mine cooked much faster than the recipe indicated. I also found that it turns out less dry when using a higher fat ground turkey. I prefer the drier version, my husband prefers the moister version.

Awesome recipe! It's definitely lighter than a beef recipe and I loved not having that overly stuffed feeling.  Took some others suggestions and made some slight changes such as adding a diced vidalia onion and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and topped with bbq sauce instead of ketchup.  I also kept the cheese in cubes and just put a baking sheet underneath because some cheese bubbled over and out.  The only thing I would change is maybe adding a few more herbs and spices next time, but it was overall a fabulous meatloaf! Thanks!

I thought this was a very good basic recipe. But I did make a few changes.  I went through my fridge and used the extra leftover veggies I had.  I diced carrots, mushrooms, 4 cloves garlic, and celery and added to it. I used 1/2 the amount of milk, and added worsteshire sauce to the sauce. It came out great! My roommates loved it. It also seems to be a much healthier version of the basic meatloaf. I LOVE the cheese in it!! I would never have thought to add it.  =)

I made this for my boyfriend who didn't like meatloaf and he liked this very much.  He said it tasted like barbeque ribs.  I did the suggested changes from the other reviews: I soaked the bread crumbs, added about 1/4c. worst. sauce, 1/8 tsp. onion powder, a shake of seasoning salt, and added a tsp. of brown sugar to the bbq sauce (instead of ketchup).  I only made one pound of turkey meatloaf and had no problems at all with it overflowing the pan.  It must have been good because it was all eaten within 24 hours!

I thought this was just 'okay'.  My husband seemed to enjoy it a lot more than I did though.  It was just too mushy for me and lacked flavor.  Make sure you put a drip pan under the loaf pan-otherwise your kitchen will be VERY smokey.

This was so-so. I didn't "hate" it, but didn't love it either. My fiance thought it was OK too, but his reasons for not liking this were diff. than mine. For me, the meatloaf was too mushy & a tad lacking in flavor (I even add. a few dashes of W sauce & a pk. onion soup - flakes only). My fiance thought it was blander than I did & didn't like the cheesiness. In order to take the guesswork out of knowing when my meatloaf was done, I set my WS meat thermometer to register 160 deg. I still set my oven timer though, and found that it took more than an hr. to come to temp. For those of you wanting to try this, I have a few sugg. (r/t the burning issue): a) PLACE A DRIP PAN UNDER YOUR LOAF PAN (I used a cookie sheet), b) TURN OFF YOUR SMOKE ALARM (mine went off 3 X's!!!) & c) USE YOUR EXHAUST FAN!!! I also have a couple personal sugg. In retrospect, I think soaking my breadcrumbs in milk was the reason for my loaf's mushiness. If you prefer yours this way, go for it (MALTESE_MOM has good tips). I would also skip the glaze (didn't do anything for us, even w/ the add. of 1.5 T brown sugar). Instead, serve katsup tableside. I'd also use lean beef next time (to see if it would alleviate the mushy issue). Oh, and def. allow your meatloaf to sit for 15 min. or so - it will con't. to cook (and reach a "safe" temp. of 165 deg.), the juices will soak into the loaf & it will be easy to cut. Served w/ Cowboy Mashed Potatoes (Steve) & biscuits, this was a hearty meal. Thx. for sharing :)

So easy. Ready for oven in 5 minutes. I used stredded cheese because I had it on hand. Very good too. One of the best meatloafs I've had. I ate leftovers of it and I'm really bad about leftovers.

Tried this out this week...it was ok.  Nothing fabulous but not bad either.  The texture was a little strange but I guess that is because we are used to hamburger meatloaf...or maybe too many bread crumbs???  Who knows.  Might tweek and try again.  I cut my cheese in little cubes and didn't have any issues with bubbling/burning.  I think grating it would be better though.

Very yummy.   Divided recipe in half, added worchestire sauce, seasoning salt, used italianed seasoned turkey meat and the cheese as directed.  Made one 8" loaf pan topped with bbq sauce and a second 5.63" loaf for my soon to be 1 yr old.    I put 1/2 of the meat mixture into loaf pan made a trench and added shredded mozerella cheese and spinach as well.   Layered remaining meat and topped that with spaghetti sauce.   Hubby loved his meatloaf and my little one loved his.   Both have their own left over.   Will make again.

I tried this after all of the reviews because I love turkey meatloaf. I think if you are 12 you will like this. It tastes like the turkey equivalent of boxed mac and cheese. And you really can't eat it cold on sandwiches. Just did not like this one. Will stick with the traditional.

VERY GOOD!  This was melt-in-my-mouth good.  I added seasoning (italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a few drops of worcestershire sauce).  I didn't have the correct cheese, so I divided it between cheddar and sharp...those were the only changes, and it turned out just wonderful.  The chunks of cheese that melted throughout was a really nice surprise, and it just had an overall great flavor. I will add this to my routine for sure.

Great recipe.  I highly recommend - I noticed that some people were having issues with it taking too long, so I divided the mixture into two smaller loaf pans (5x10") and didn't fill them completely to avoid boiling over.  At about 50 mins at 400 degrees the intern temp was 185.     I added garlic and onion, but other than that I followed the recipe.

we really enjoy this!  i used shredded cheese because that was all i had on hand tonight and it worked just as well as when i've made it with cubed cheese.  in a pinch one night i also made it with strips of american deli cheese that i just ripped up and threw in! i dont put the ketchup on during cooking but serve it with ketchup for dipping. and my breadcrumbs are well seasoned and also have romano cheese in them which i think helps the flavor as well.  i think the texture of this meatloaf is excellent.  wonderful recipe!

I thought that this meatloaf was rather bland (even after adding some of the spices and extras recommended by others).  I had been so excited about gooey pockets of cheese, but it was sort of a letdown.  Not much flavor for all the added fat, cholesterol, and calories, in my opinion!  I enjoyed the chunk of colby cheese I popped into my mouth while I was cooking more than the finished product.  Not a bad dish, but not particularly special.

Agree with everyone, awesome recipe!  I followed some of the suggestions, and first soaked the bread crumbs (I used plain bread crumbs, good choice) then I mixed in a few pinches of salt, a bit of onion soup mix, kosher salt, 1/3 of a large yellow onion grated, 1 small grated carrot, and 1 grated zucchini.  I also shredded my cheese like the others suggested, and it provided an even distribution of cheese with each bite.  Didn't cover it with foil, just let it bake, and it turned out to be a real hit!  Who needs beef?!

This was a fine recipe, but I'm not sure if it's good enough to make again.  My husband liked it a lot more than I did, which was somewhat predictable because he's more of a carnivore than I am and he loves cheese.  To my tastes, the cheese was unnecessary.  I did make a few changes to the recipe: I added a dash of worcestershire sauce and some grated carrot, used colby jack instead of plain colby, and put barbecue sauce on some of it instead of ketchup.  The barbecue sauce was much better than the ketchup.  The other changes probably didn't make much difference.  This recipe makes much too much for one loaf pan, so I used two pans and put a cookie sheet underneath to catch the spills that other reviewers had warned about.  The meatloaf didn't spill, though.

Whole family loved it. I added onions and celery finely chopped.  Also added worcestershire (sp) sauce and used Honey BBQ sauce on top.  As an added health benefit, I added 1 Tbsp flax seed meal (for omega-3).  I only had a mixture of grated mozarella and provolone + Velveeta cheese but they worked fine (I added less than what was called for).

This recipe was a huge hit among meat loaf lovers and haters in my house.  I added a few teaspoons of additional spices to the mixture - garlic salt, season all, whatever I had in the cupboard.  As other reviewers suggested, I only used 1/2 pound of cheese (8 oz) rather than 12 oz. and it was PLENTY of cheese.  I bought the Kraft pre-cubed Colby-Jack mix and just threw it in the mixture as-is and it came out perfectly.  The cheese cubes seemed large to me, but once they melt in the oven you don't get huge globs of cheese when you eat it.  I also mixed a little bit of barbecue sauce in with the ketchup on top...it gets nice and carmelized on the edges from the sugars.  Delish!!

Fabulous! so easy to make, I overloaded it with peppers, onions and carrots and it was a little much so next time I won't put as many veggies. I used super lean turkey, skim milk, and 2% cheese and came out great!

This was great! I replaced the milk with BBQ sauce for extra zip and slathered the top with more. 3/4 lb of cheese is a bit excessive--and I'm even from Wisconsin! I cut it down just a bit

EXCELLENT!!! I changed the recipe a little bit to make it healthier and to fit a family of three. 1 lb lean Jennie-0 turkey 1/2 cup skim milk 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs 1/2 cup chopped onions 1 egg 8 oz sargento reduced fat shredded cheese 1 tsp salt 1 tsp pepper 1/4 to 1/2 cup ketchup 2 tbsp brown sugar (mix the ketchup and brown sugar together to make topping) My family LOVED this recipe!!! I wish I could give it more then 5 stars.

My family loved it! I usually dont add whole pieces of cheese to my meatloaf, I usually grate the cheese and than mix it in. But this worked out really well. My family loved that with every bite they had gooey cheese. I made 2, (I have a big family) and I swear the DH ate 1 whole one by himself.

OMG - I can't believe that we were diggin' meatloaf! Changes: I had 1.25 lbs turkey.  Had to use Saltines (spiced heavily with Penzey's Italian Herb / Parsley / Garlic / Onion Powder / etc), since I didn't have 'crumbs. (Mixed crackers with the milk). Per suggestions, grated some carrots and onion.  Splashed in Worcestershire. Had only a little shredded cheddar. And, instead of Ketchup, I used Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy.  Topped my portion with one of those packets of Arby's sauce.  HOLY SMOKES - WILL MAKE AGAIN!

Wonderful recipe. I used rolled oats with my own Italian herbs and some garlic as I didn't have Italian breadcrumbs. Still fantastic. Loved the melted cheese pools inside the loaf. YUM.

With a few minor changes (read on), this recipe is amazing. It works as a great hot entree right out of the oven, perfect for cold sandwiches the next day, and a great addition to a cook-ahead freezer menu. I will make this many more times.

As far as the modifications go, like many others, I soaked the bread crumbs in the milk for 5 minutes first. That makes for a moister, lighter texture in the end. Also, I added two links of sweet Italian turkey sausage (casings removed), several dashes of Worcestershire sause, two cloves of garlic (minced) and one half of a sweet onion (diced).

The ketchup topping is fine as is, but barbeque sauce works well, too.

No matter how you make it, this is a wonderful recipe to work from. It makes loads of delicious comfort food. I could have easily sliced 16 modest entree portions out of this. Well, in theory. My husband perfered a "big as his head" slab, so it doesn't go as far that way.

My husband loved this.  He said it was the first meatloaf he's ever liked.  I followed the recipe except I used a honey bbq instead of ketchup.  It was so good.  The cheese does bubble a little, but if you split the recipie into two loaf pans, so they aren't overly full, it's no problem.

REALLY great recipe and VERY simple which is absolutely great when the cook is busy :D

I would make a couple of changes though. I'd cut down on the salt (maybe not put any at all if using seasoned Italian bread crumbs) or add salt only if you are using PLAIN Italian bread crumbs. Also, the ketchup adds more saltiness. So, I'd consider not using ketchup for this recipe and maybe make a simple tomato sauce (or use store bought).

This was regular meatloaf, not any better or worse than usual. But I think I had really high expectations because I love cheese.  Even with the cheese, this was your basic meatloaf.  And with the cheese it limits your sauce options somewhat in that we didn't want to add gravy.

This recipe is amazing! I used half colby jack cheese and half pepper jack cheese because that's what I had... and I also had Italian seasoned ground turkey. I just made it for my fiance's company, and they all loved it! I did have the same problem of the cheese bubbling over and burning, but I did what someone else had suggested- put a container underneath the loaf and kept baking. It was REALLY good!!

Great recipe. Made a few changes. Added 1 package onion soup mix instead of salt, and 1 tsp. worcheshire sauce. Also, topped with a small jar of Turkey gravy instead of ketchup. Came out delicious.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and my family would not eat it.  Very bland, and the cheese made it greasy.  I was extremely dissappointed after all the rave reviews.

Very easy to overpower this dish with spices and adding a packet of onion soup mix. Though this was cooked all the way through it had a wet consistency which i didn't appreciate. The taste was over powering. Over all I just did not like this.

My husband didn't even know it was Turkey!  We thought this was very good, and even my kids (6 & 4) asked to have it again.  I only had regular bread crumbs, but tried to make up for the flavor by adding fresh garlic to the milk and letting the breadcrumbs soak in it before adding them to the meat mixture.  I also added parsley and half an onion, choppped fine, to the meat mixture.  Next time I will add more onion and more bread crumbs.  As it was, it fell apart easily (which I like) but my husband would prefer more of a loaf.  Very good!  Will definitely use this again!

Excellent!  I made a few modifications as suggested in other reviews:  worcheshire sauce, used lawrys, added green onions, dried onion, FF 1/2n 1/2 instead of milk, 8 pieces of cubed bread, and mixed the cheese - 1/2 shredded mozz and 1/2 cubed white cheddar. To the sauce, I added BBQ and a lot of brown sugar. I made 4 mini loaves in a 9x13 pan, and baked for 1/2 hour at 400.  Delicious!

I didn't have Italian Breadcrumbs, so I used panko and some Italian herbs I had in my cupboard. I only had sharp cheddar cheese, and I coated it with BBQ sauce as someone suggested, and it came out really good. Using carrots and onions sounds like a good idea, but I was being a bit lazy... I'll definitely do it next time.

I use this all the time I simply love it, sometimes when Im feeling healthy I melt cheese on top at the end instead of putting inside.  Also very easy to throw in veggies to hide from kids.

This is absolutely delicious!  I took the advice of other raters and let my bread crumbs and milk soak first.  My husband is not a big meatloaf fan, but I made this and he raved about how good it was.  It was even better the next day as left overs!

I tried this recipe & found it to be as great as recommended. At least a 5. We all loved it. I will not add salt next time as the cheese makes it salty enough. I added chopped onions & 2 sodium free bouillons. I did not add the catsup because I never do put that in my meatloafs. Will make this often.

I am giving this a 5 for great texture and moisture as well as flavor..... I intended on doing this recipe in hamburger form and grilling since I only had 1 lb.of turkey. Hence, a few friends from the exchange changed my mind...I cut the recipe in half, and used 2 tblspns. of dry onion soup mix in addition. Cheesey, crusty ends, yummy flavors and not DRY!!! That is a huge plus....my family loved this. I will make this one again...thanks!

Very good!  I halved the recipe and added 1/2 packet of onion soup mixture.  I think that it would be somewhat bland without additional spices.  My husband loved it though, good recipe!

This was a great meatloaf.  I made it even more healthy by using 1% milk and low fat cheese.  Very moist and tasty.

Very good! I cut the recipe in half as I'm only cooking for two. I cubed the cheese just as the recipes calls for and it turned out perfect. I also used a generous amount of black pepper seasoning salt, minced, fresh garlic, and about 1/2 cup of chooped onion. It turned out very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

Mmmm! I think as is the recipe would have been a bit bland so I threw in a few extras. I chopped 2 cloves of garlic and half an Inca Sweet onion, soaked the breadcrumbs like someone suggested and added fresh parsley, paprika, tarragon and oregano. I also threw some ketchup into the meat mix and also on top when I baked it. I had sharp cheddar on hand so I used that and baked it in a glass pie plate so it wouldn't bubble over in the oven. The cheese made the pan greasy but somehow the meatloaf didn't hold onto the grease! I love the little pockets of cheese. Awesome recipe, thanks for sharing! Will make this again soon!

The ketchup burnt and filled my kitchen with smoke.  I had to peel it off in the middle of cooking.  Also, this didn't take 1 hour too cook; it took 2!  It kept my family hungry and threw off timing of my side dishes because I assumed the 1 hour time was correct.  Also, it tastes like sausage, not turkey meatloaf.  I know I'm in the minority here, but it just wasn't worth the burning, smoke and rediculous wait time.

Family liked this a lot... changes I made were to shred the cheese instead of cubing it, and adding extra ingredients to spice it up a bit... worcestershire sauce, diced onion and garlic powder. Nice and easy recipe!

I just tried this last night and it was soooo good. I made it with beef because that is what I had on hand. I also halved all ingredients because I only had 1.25 lb. of ground beef. I loved it!!!and I am not a big fan of meatloaf. I make it for my husband- he really liked this recipe too! It's a keeper!

Delicious!  I added an envelope of onion soup to this, as well as some tomato puree and plenty of black pepper, and rather than the colby I used shredded cheddar, and the end result was a big family-pleaser!

I grilled onions, garlic, red bell peppers in EVOO until they were really soft and added them to the meet mix.  I also didn't have italian seasoned bread crumbs so I used just regular old white bread and crumbled it up and added some Italian seasoning.  It was really really great.  My whole family loved it, even my 3 year old.  My family wanted more then what I had made - so I didn't have enough becuase it was so good.  Great recipe.  I was sceptical of the cheese and ketchup (as opposed to make a tomatoe sauce).  It was so simple and so tasty.

I was skeptical making meatloaf with turkey meat, but wanted a slightly healthier option.  It was absolutely delicious and nice and moist! I pretty much followed the recipe exact except I shredded mozzarella cheese and since i ran out of milk i diluted some condensed milk, which gave it a little sweetness.  Never thought turkey meatloaf could be so yummy!  Will definitely make this for the family again!

This recipe was great with a few additions that other reviewers suggested.  We rarely use ground beef anymore definitely prefering ground turkey.  I soaked the breadcrumbs in milk as suggested and only used one egg.  I  also added quite a few splashes on worchestshire sauce, garlic salt and shredded cheddar and mozzerella cheese.  Cooked in a 9 x 9 pan rather than loaves and it cooked more evenly.  Even my son who has an aversion to meat texture ate it and commented that it wasn't so bad.  Thanks for sharing!!

Before making this recipe I was the worst meat ball/loaf maker alive.  I still am.  You can't beat how easy this recipe is but after cooking an hour it came out like a brick.  I blame the breadcrumbs for that.  I didn't add the milk because the uncooked loaf was so moist it never would have held together.  Maybe it is supposed to be this way but if I ever make this type of recipe again it won't contain bread crumbs.  I had already deli sliced cheese, so I just chopped with a knife and added.  Wasn't happy w/flavor either.

I added 1/2 package of onion soup mix to it.  Also I cut the recipe in 1/2 since I had only 1.25 lbs of ground turkey.

This is a fantastic dish! I did cheese cubes, and added 1 package dried onion soup, a chopped jalapeno for some spice, and followed the rest of the recipe. The ketchup added some moisture to the turkey; nice since it has less fat than ground beef. I made it for my husband and he practically ate the whole thing in one sitting! It is so tasty. You won't regret making this dish!

I had a pound of ground turkey leftover and needed to cook it.  Found this recipe and did not have colby - so I used chedder and it was darn good.  Only gave it 4 stars until I try it with colby.  EASY to make for sure.

The first time I made this I shredded the cheese, like so many reviews suggested.  It made the turey loaf appear to be undone, because it was too creamy with cheese.  It was still delicious.
The next time I made this, I increased the bread crumbs to 1 1/2 cups and cubed the cheese.  It came out fabulous.

Very minor changes (topped with BBQ sauce instead of ketchup & sprinkled in Chipotle seasoning during the mixing) to suit my tastes more. I used the newer cheese 'crumbles' & had no issues w/the cheese. Excellent & tasty recipe--this one's a keeper!

This was SOOOOO YUMMY!!!
I halved the recipe (only had 1 lb. turkey thawed).  I used shredded cheddar (all I had on hand) and I also chopped an onion, shredded some carrots, and added some minced garlic...cooked those in a little bit of butter before adding to the turkey loaf.  This was an incredible yummy supper, and leftovers reheat very nicely as well!!  A nice alternative to regular meatloaf!!

I'm not a huge fan of meatloaf, but loved this.  Just a few changes:  added a packet of reduced sodium onion soup mix (as others suggested), used shredded cheese, and added chopped spinach.  The chopped spinach might sound odd, but it tasted great.  My kids didn't even complain about the green stuff hiding in their meatloaf.  Oh, and I didn't use ketchup...

Great turkey meatloaf.  I don't miss beef at all.  I used sharp cheddar cheese because that's what I had.  I tried cubed once and then shredded.  Cubed is better.  Make sure you have a big enough pan because it will boil over.  I did add onion and a little more bread crumbs the second time around.  The recipe is delicious as is and great for adjusting to taste.

I loved this recipe. I took the advice of one of the other reviews and added grated Zuchini, garlic powder, and onion powder. Im not a ketchup fan so I didnt add that part but It was amazing. I have 3 children under the age of 3 and babysit two others 2 and 7 so it was nice to have something so easy to make for dinner. all the kids loved it. I paired it with a fresh romaine/spinach salad and a simple corn dish and all the kids cleared their plates. Super quick and easy meal!!!!!!!!!!!1

I used a combo of grated cheddar and Monterey Jack, and added some grated carrots.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I used panko and they worked fine.  Incredibly moist and flavorful.  I also some Bon Appetit seasoning.  I enjoyed the leftovers every bit as much as the first night!

I used shredded cheese and added a few tablespoons of Weber"s Horseradish Mustard for a bit of a kick. I also make my meatloaves, or Mini Meatloaves as I call them, in a muffin tin for easy leftovers and never getting the crusty part when reheated. Awesome recipe!

Yum! My first successful turkey meatloaf! I followed the recipe exactly except I used shredded cheeses (a combination of mozzarella and Mexican blend) because that is what I had on hand. Will make again!

WOW!!!  All I can say is DELICIOUS!!!  Thank you!!! I made my version just a little different.  Since there are only 2 adults in my family (the other one is still on breast milk! :0), I added half of a chopped yellow onion and 2 cloves of chopped fresh garlic to 1.25 lbs of the turkey meat, and also decided to increase the amount of breadcrumbs to 3/4 cup, and also added 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese to the mix.  I didn't have any colby cheese, so I threw in shredded mozzarella (3 oz.), and grated 3 oz. of velveeta.  This is the first time I have ever had turkey meatloaf, but OMG!!!  So good!!!  YUMMY!!!  I made a side of homemade garlic mashed potatoes, and a fresh green salad, and it was the yummiest lunch I have made in a long time!!  Will definitely make again!!!  Thanks!!!

Great recipe...i made it as the directions called for and i see why diced cheese instead of shredded is the way to go...the diced cheese leaves pockets of warm cheese where the shredded my make the meat loaf a little dry.Thanks for the recipe we love!! it.

Fantastic!  I mix the turkey, eggs, milk, breadcrumbs, ketchup, and some seasonings together, put half the mixture in an 8x8 pan, add a layer of shredded cheese, add rest of mixture on top and bake for 40 minutes at 400 degrees.  Turns out everytime!  served with baked potatoes, YYUUMM.

SOOO DELICIOUS!!  I sauteed together onions, garlic and fresh spinash and added to the mixtrue.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed some herb flavored stuffing cubes.  I followed the remaining of the recipe.  This is my new favorite meatloaf recipe.

This is AMAZING! I opted to keep the cheese cubed, but put it in a 9x9 pan instead of a loaf pan. I also subsituted BBQ sauce for the ketchup. My boyfriend and I both gorged ourselves and he made many comments that this is the best thing I have ever made. I'm actually eating the left-overs right now! AMAZING!

Good stuff.  I am not a huge meatloaf fan, but my boyfriend is.  This was a really good compromise.  I did add extra garlic and used a variety of cheeses- whatever I had in my fridge- all shredded up together. Overall, it was successful for us both!

This was really good! Next time I think I'll omit the salt since the cheese adds enough saltiness. I'm sort of partial to salty foods though, so it didn't bother me. Makes great sandwiches the next day! Thanks for the great recipe...I'll be making this often!

This recipe is a great starting point to play with turkey meatloaf. I made it tonight, and took the advice of the other reviwers, adding onion and garlic.

I also took a spinach salad left over from last night (baby spinach, yellow red and green peppers, red cabbage, celery ect) and put it in the food processor till it was finely chopped. I added that, and used wheat germ instead of half the bread crumbs (super good for you and no one knows the difference). I added some fresh chopped basil and pasley. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. My husband ate almost the whole thing.

This recipe is a great base/starting point and you can dress it up any way you choose. After reading some of the comments prior to trying it out, I decided to make it a couple different ways.
The first time, I followed the suggestion of others and added onion, fresh garlic, jalapenos, worcheschire sauce and sharp cheddar...Fantastic!
The second time I added spinach, black olives, yellow peppers and feta to make a Greek version. Again...Fantastic! I can't wait to see what we come up with next.

Easy to prepare and tasty.  Great as leftovers.  Definitely use a cookie sheet under the meatloaf because it will bubble over.

I do not see what the big hoopla is about this meatloaf.  It is average, at best.  I even added some onion & poured BBQ sauce over the top as others suggested & I still think it was just okay.  I like the Meatloaf with a Bite recipe on this site much better.

This meatloaf is really, really, good. I have made it twice now, once with ground turkey breast and once w/just regular ground turkey (85/15). Both times were awesome. The second time was a little mushy, I'm thinking b/c of the extra fat. Each time I took the ketchup (or tomoato sauce ) and added brown sugar and barbecue to, and it is awesome. My husband ranted and raved about this, so it is now my regular meatloaf recipe. I use cheddar and cut it into smaller cubes. I also add finely chopped onions. YUMMMM......

This was good - better than my usual meatloaf was the husband's take.  Took a little longer to cook than recipe states.  Added chopped green pepper.

My family absolutely loved this meatloaf.  Everyone went back for seconds!! The only thing that I changed was adding a few squirts of worceteshire sauce to the turkey mixture.  A real keeper.

I used lean turkey meat, and added fresh garlic and onions.  The fresh garlic was awesome!  It could have used a little bit more salt, but other than that, very tasty!

This was a good recipe. I did think that it needed some extra spices (minced garlic, garlic powder and onion powder). I think next time I will add some minced onions as it seemed that some bites were full of flavor and others were a little bland. All in all, a good recipe that I will definitely be making again!

I made this for my picky family and they LOVED IT!!! Everyone said that it was the best meatloaf they had ever had. All the leftovers were eaten up for lunch the next day. Like some of the other reviewers had said, I added some worchestershire sauce in w/ the ketchup and it really tasted good! I'm going to be making this at least once a week!

I liked this turkey loaf recipe.  Like other reviewers I did not have the full amount of turkey needed so I added one shredded summer squash.  Next time I'll still add the squash but decrease the liquid ingredients a little because it was too runny/juicy.  I also used shredded cheese as other reviewers did because I didn't want it to ooze into my oven.

this recipe was very good.  My kids really liked it and are usually picky about my turkey meatloafs.  I took the advice of another review and added worshteshire sauce, sauted onions and garlic.  It made the meatloaf much tastier.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Really good.  My husband and I are trying to make some healthy lifestyle changes.  This delivers that great "comfort food" taste with an improvement in nutrition from the traditional meatloaf.  I made it as stated, and my husband is already asking for another!

We enjoyed this meatloaf.  We are used to using beef and this was a nice change!  I went with shredded cheese because I didn't have any cubes, but thought it was good just like that!  Thanks!

My son loved this. I thought it was a bit smooshy and would probably not add as much milk next time. I also used bbq sauce instead of ketchup and shredded cheddar because thats what I had. I added 1 small onion as suggested by several reviewers but would leave it out next time because I thought it overwhelmed the taste.

This is an incredibly delicious meatloaf.  I like it because you don't get the grease that comes from ground beef, for instance.  And it's healthy.  My son, who hates anything healthy, was so impressed that he asks me to make this at least once a week and there are no leftovers.  When he isn't eating it for dinner, he's taking some for lunch.

Wonderfully easy and tasty!  I'll never use beef in  meatloaf again.  Only changes made were those already mentioned--added chopped onion, shredded cheese (1 C), a little worchestershire sauce and top with bbq sauce.  You MUST try this...even good for a summer meal since it's so light.

This makes a very moist meatloaf. I did add one small diced onion for more flavor, 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1 cup and only one egg. Turned out wonderful. Going to try plain bread crumbs next time.

I used this recipe as a guideline because I didn't have all the ingredients handy.  Instead of Colby cheese I used Cheddar and Parmesan.  I also added some garlic salt and a packet of onion soup mix.  It was the best meatloaf I've ever had - and I usually don't like meatloaf

I halved this recipe since I cook for two.  It was very tasty. I modified by using kosher salt instead of table salt about 1 to 2 teaspoons.  I also topped the ketchup with brown sugar.  Very yummy the best turket meatloaf I hav had in forever!

You should really only cook it for 50 minutes at 400.  If you do a full hour I have notice it dries out and burns badly.  I know the old Jennie O recipe called for an hour at 375 and this one is just about identical to it.

Made this and my people loved it! Did not disclose to our son that it was ground turkey until he was through his second serving. I added a medium onion, diced, had sharp cheddar on hand which heightened the flavor of the cheesy treats inside, and the bread crumbs I had were garlic & herb seasoned. Next time I’ll add carrots and maybe some sweet bell peppers.

Recipe is pretty good. Will definitely make it again. I only used 8oz block of cheese which seemed more than enough. I also waited until the last ten minutes to add the ketchup after draining the fat that raised to the top. Meatloaf was moist and cheesy. Took a star away only because the flavor relies on a seasoned breadcrumb which is completely out of my control. Next time I will use plain and season as I desire.

I’ve been making this for about 10 years. My now 22 year old son came over  2 nights ago to have this dish (it’s his favorite). I’ve always made it exactly  by this recipe but decided to play with it this time. I added 1 pkg of Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the turkey mix then, instead of topping it with just ketsup, I mixed 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a pinch of paprika to the ketsup. Made for a much tastier topping.

Super good. I added grated onion, and used panko; added garlic powder, modified the recipe for 1 lb of ground turkey but still cooked for 1 hr at 400 degrees. I wish I had added more ketchup on top bc it caramalizes nicely in the oven. Smells and tastes delish!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  All 3 of my kids agree!  Will definitely make it again.  Only change that was made was colby-jack cheese was inadvertently purchased instead of straight colby, still delicious.

We love this dish, it’s a regular at our house. I made some changes. I put half of the meat mixture in and a layer of shredded Mexican cheese blend then the remaining meat.     Less cheese and calories but we love it, my wife and I.

This recipe is outstanding ! This is going to my new 'Go To'  recipe for meatloaf. The only changes I made were I added  1/4 onion, grated and a few splashes of worcestershire sauce. Also, the leftovers are amazing!!!!

Made this tonight. I am a bariatric patient, 5.5 weeks out from gastric bypass surgery, but I have kids who will love it. I can only eat about 8 or 9 bites so this will be okay for me. Here were my tweaks: one lack of Lipton beefy onion soup mix, garlic/salt fresh ground, fresh ground pepper, a little grated parmesan, Fairlife (low sugar, nonfat) milk, low-fat cubed Colby Jack cheese, and reduced sugar catsup. I haven’t been excited about dinner in a long time! Oh, and use a cookie sheet under the pan while baking :)

Loved it but only gave it 4 stars because I too added onion, minced garlic and Worcestershire sauce. I also used about 1/2 lb of chunks of cheese and the rest 1/4 lb was shredded cheese. Lastly, I needed more than just a half cup sauce. I mixed bbq sauce and ketchup to make about 3/4 cup to spread over the meatloaf. The family loved it!

Well, I love this recipe because I used to make meat loaf with ground turkey meat and it was always way too dry. So I figured with meat loaf I always had to use beef but then its high in fat. This recipe has made my turkey meat loaf nice and moist! Its the milk and cheese that does. 

I had to make a couple changes. I only had 1 pound of ground turkey meat so cut the recipe in half. Next time I will do two. Can't eat bread so used oats and Italian seasoning. Took the advice of others and splashed some Worcestershire Sauce in there. I chopped up some white onion (always have to have that in my meat loaf!) and used up some extra shredded cheese (Mexican blend).  I am not a fan of Ketchup so cooked the loaf for 30 minutes then spread tomato sauce on top and cooked it for another 30 minutes. It was a hit! Delicious! Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Great recipe, easy to make, but a little greasy. I cut back just a little on the cheese, still use 1/2 cup though and it has helped a lot. Also we add just 1/8 tsp of white pepper as well.

I love this recipe. I am always looking for something to do with ground turkey that is not dry. I also love meatloaf but am always looking to avoid red meat as much as possible. This recipe is perfect. I made it to the recipe and it was great, but then I made it again with the following changes, and it was even better. First, I used panko breadcrumbs into which I sprinkled a little parmesan and then soaked with 3/4 cup milk. Instead of ketchup, I used Sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce. I folded 1/4 cup into the meat and then glazed the top. I grated some carrots into the turkey. Since I like the carmelized crust of the meatloaf, I shape the mixture into two loafs to create more crust (for me!) and then watch the baking time closely. It usually doesn't take the full hour.  I don't order meatloaf out any more. When I get a craving, I make this. Best of all, my picky family will eat it too . One last tip: I quarter my Colby cheese cubes because if they are too big, I find too much of the cheese runs out of the loaf during baking.

Very  cheesy as advertised and I only used 1/2 a pound and I live in Wisconsin.  It takes a lot to get me to say something has too much cheese. I put in plain bread crumbs and put in my own Italian seasoning.  Extremely easy to whip up.

I made this tonight for my family and it was a hit. I only had panko bread crumbs instead of Italian bread crumbs. I added some grated onion, some worchetshire sauce, garlic powder, basil and parsley (because I didn't have Italian bread crumbs) and I only had sharp cheddar so I grated it as well. I also topped it w my favorite BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. I cooked it halfway covered with foil and took it off for remaining 30 minutes because I wanted to keep it moist. It was amazing. The only thing I would do next time is cube the cheese. Was very delicious and a great way to use ground turkey.

I will definitely make it a again. Pretty much followed the recipe. Used cheddar cheese, halfed the recipe, and coated the loaf pan with a flavorful olive oil. Will definitely make it again and try some different spices that will compliment the Italian bread crumbs as well as a different cheese just to change it up. It was tasty as is, but there is potential to make it more flavorful. I did coat it with a good amount of ketchup before placing in the oven.

This is my 7 year old's favorite meal! He takes leftovers for lunch at school the entire week after I've made it for dinner. Only change I make is to add 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 small chopped onion. I omit the ketchup and broil the top once it is finished cooking. Absolute perfection!

Okay, I'm a REALLY good cook and this tasted like licking the wallpaper at the Department of Motor Vehicles. I followed a lot of the recommendations by other reviewers- grated onion, garlic, Worcestershire, letting it sit a while in the fridge to "marinate", barbecue sauce on top.  I used grated instead of cubed cheese. It took about an hour and 10 minutes for me. I covered it with foil, I let it sit again another 10. So the big moment? BLAND. BLAND BLAND BLAND. If BEIGE was a flavor, this would be it. I tried a combo of toppings to try and fix it. Tabasco. More barbecue. Gravy. Disgusting. And not an iota of cheese left. I would NEVER make this again. And now I have to order take-out. And the take-out in my area is nasty. THAT has to say something. Signed, I need a drink and a chick flick.

My extremely picky family absolutely loved this meatloaf. It's a new favorite that I'll definitely be making again. Made a few minor changes: reduced amount of ketchup and added panko seasoning into the mix to add a little extra taste and texture.

I made it pretty much as listed but I used cream instead of milk because I was out of milk. I increased the breadcrumbs by 1/3 cup to compensate for the cream. It was really good and my husband said he is looking forward to a meatloaf sandwich tomorrow too.  The cubes of cheese make it moist and creamy. You could spice it up if you want. Basically it is a recipe anyone could put their spin on.  I'll make it again.  Moist and tasty.

Added garlic powder and onion powder. I used shredded cheese instead of cubed because it's easier. I brushed with Sweet Baby Rays instead of ketchup. Used a remote probe and cooked until 170 degrees. It got rave reviews and I really enjoyed it and here is the kicker...I HATE GROUND TURKEY. It is literally ground beef's dumb cousin. I'd make it again.

I've made this twice now, using honey bbq sauce drizzled on top instead of adding the ketchup.  Love it!  Make it in small meatloaf pans and then freeze 2 while eating one.  Freezes well and thaws tasting just as good as if just made.  I am not much of a cook, but this recipe was easy and great tasting!

Have made this a couple of times now.  I used shredded cheese instead of cubes, so the cheese is more evenly distributed through the meatloaf.  As for seasoning, I use salt and pepper, plus a little garlic salt and seasoned salt, plus a dash of onion powder [turkey is so bland].  I also use gluten free bread crumbs and this last time, I added some chopped baby bella mushrooms... wonderful addition... skipped the ketchup and just served the meatloaf with a thin squeeze of honey mustard dressing on the plate... yyyyuuuuummmm.

turned out fine but think next time  1/4 inch cheese cubes would be better.  Turkey made it better tasting than beef!

Really liked this but made with the following modifications: added 1 diced green pepper and 1 diced onion; cut amount of milk by a little bit (maybe 1/4th of a cup) due to extra moisture from added veggies; added a bit extra salt and pepper; topped with a sweet & sour BBQ sauce; baked in 2 pans @ 375F (actually filled 1 pan and I used aluminum foil as a retaining wall in the second pan since there wasn't enough to fill the pan "tall") . 

Very pleased with this, will definitely make again!

I made lots of changes based on other reviewers’ comments on blandness. Especially recommend adding garlic powder, parsley and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture, and maybe finely diced onions. But not so much on the grated zucchini or other fresh vegetables. I tried it, and ended up with a little liquid pooling at the bottom. Also completely agree with the chunk vs. grated cheese. Wasn’t sure how I’d like the pools of cheesiness (never thought I’d type that sentence!), but it’s probably better than homogeneity. But you’ve definitely got to do the topping, with some mix of Wor…, ketchup and BBQ sauce. Final comment: No way that all fits in a standard loaf pan! The 1.5 liter VisionWare pot I used was the perfect size, though I was still grateful for the drip pan when the smoke alarm went off!

My BF wanted to give it 4 stars bc it's not beef but 5 for me. I added 3 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1 Tbsp A-1 sauce, pepper & minimal salt bc Worcestershire, A-1, and cheese are salty.  I would add 1/2 cup milk next time. This time I had to cook it 20 min longer. If you know your meatloaf......check to see if it's too mushy and revise before the oven. I know better. Also try the "Turkey and Quinoa Meatloaf".......honestly, I think that one is better (FANTASTIC)

My five year old loves this meatloaf!  He won't eat any poultry besides ground turkey so this this recipe is a nice change of pace every few weeks.  I've shared it with several people who have enjoyed it as well.

My whole family is a big beef lover and was kind of nervous trying turkey with them. Didn't tell them it was turkey till they were done eating and they LOVED it. couldn't even tell it as turkey! Definitely will make this again!

really good.  i used only 1.3 lbs of turkey so i halved the other ingredients.  mixed bread crumbs with the milk.  i added about half a cup of shredded carrots chopped finely, some worsteshire sauce, trader joes 21 salute seasoning, kosher salt, pepper, egg and about 6 oz cheddar cheese grated.  put in blue glass loaf pan with bbq sauce on top.  doesn't taste like your regular meatloaf, more like a turkey cheeseburger. yum.
doesn't need to cook that long since I halved it.

My husband loved this! I however, did not care for this as much as he did. He gave it a 5 and I gave it a 3 so I split the difference. I took other reviewers advice and added half a minced onion (which I lightly sautéed first), garlic and a few shakes of hot sauce and crushed red pepper. I also topped mine with a spicy barbecue sauce instead of the ketchup. My main issue was the texture, it was a bit mushy. Almost like wet dog food. That could have been my fault, since my ground turkey was not completely thawed. I loved the little pockets of melted cheese though! And the flavor was great. I will try this again, either with fully thawed turkey or even ground beef. Thank you for the recipe!!

I made this the other night, following the directions to the letter (as is the recommended route when trying a recipe for the first time). My only alteration was to replace the ketchup, which was optional, with BBQ sauce. Mainly because my Husband is not a fan of ketchup. I kept the cheese cubed, which made the finished product that much better. My only real issues came after it was baked. First, I guess we didn't wait long enough after it was pulled out of the oven, because the first few pieces practically disintegrated coming out of the loaf pan. The other issue was the loaf pan itself. I used the largest loaf pan I had on hand and the mixture was still too much (I had to put a cookie sheet underneath the pan to catch the drippings). The next time I make this, I am going to use a glass baking dish. All-in-all, it was a great recipe and I highly recommend it.

This is a great recipe and easy to make. I cut the recipe in 1/2 and make into 2 meatloaves, because everyone wants an end piece. I also use shredded cheddar if I don't have a block of cheddar. I just add the whole package to make up for not having the cubes.. I use plain whole wheat breadcrumbs and add my own Italian seasonings. Always comes out great and a big hit.

Delicious recipe, cook time is off though. 400' for an hour leaves you with raw meat in the middle. Leave it in for 1.5 hours, but turn it down to 375' for the last half hour so you don't burn the edges

I added garlic powder, creole seasoning, white onion, and banana peppers. The 1st time 1 cup of milk was a a tad too much for my liking so I dropped it to 1/2 cup. Also I topped the loaf with sweet baby ray's honey bbq sauce. Super delicious, this is definitely into rotation to stay with my family!

I made this recipe about a month ago. Per other reviews, I did add more seasoning and some plain yogurt. Delicious! My husband did not even realize that it was turkey rather than ground beef. My kids loved it too. Will definitely make again.

Loved this! I only had mixed shredded cheese on hand and it worked out great. I also only had original bread crumbs but I mixed in a good amount of italian seasoning to it, plus extra garlic powder.  Because I like very bold flavor, I also added a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce and sprinkled brown sugar on the ketchup top layer.  Came out delicious and and even my 1 year old couldn't get enough!

Made this for dinner last night. This is an extremely WET recipe. 2lbs. of meat with the additional ingredients requires a very large loaf pan, which I did not have and went free form in a rectangular casserole dish. Was worried about the wetness/stickiness, but went with it and must say it was delicious. I did add a tbl. spoon of dried onions and some parsley to help with flavor, based on other reviewers comments. I also added some hickory barbecue sauce to my ketchup topping for an additional flavor profile. It was a good move. I recommend it. I may try to go with shredded cheese next time to see if the distribution is more uniform. The cubed cheese was tough to get evenly distributed, although it makes for a more cheesier surprise when one gets to that bite. Oh yeah, I did cover with foil, tented, for the first 30 minutes to retain moisture. Then removed for browning. Worked well.

This was delicious. I didn't bother checking my ingredients first, so I didn't have exact cheese on hand. I used 10 oz of colby jack slices that I broke into quarters. 
To make life simpler, I mixed everything in my Kitchen Aid starting with the milk and bread crumbs. I read the reviews and decided to add half an onion and a shredded carrot. I added that in with the rest of the ingredients and a couple dashes of  Worcestershire sauce. Then I threw in the quartered slices of cheese at the end and let the mixer break it up further. This worked out great! Gooey cheese, without being gobs. I formed this into one big loaf on a sheet pan and baked for an hour. It was very tender, even though I cooked it past 180 degrees internal while I finished side dishes.

I made this today, but I added my own twist to it. Much more seasoning, garlic, less cheese inside, but sprinkled some grated cheese on top. I also soaked the bread crumbs in milk and mixed the bbq sauce with ketchup and worcestershire sauce. Quite tasty!

I added onion as several people recommended. I then decided to go full on Mexican and added some green chilies and topped it with salsa instead of ketchup. Two thumbs up for the result! Hubby liked it and I will definitely make it again

I followed another reviewer's advice and shaved four baby carrots, added one chopped onion and used barbecue sauce instead of the ketchup on top of the loaves .  I ended up using shredded cheese because that's what I had on hand and this was one of the best meatloafs I have ever made .Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe and it has quickly become a family staple. The only modifications that I make is adding a half of chopped onion and worcestershire sauce. The cheese makes for a flavorful meatloaf, this is by far my favorite turkey meatloaf recipe.

Pleasantly surprised, will likely make this again. I soaked pieces of stale baguette with some dried herbs (in lieu of the bread crumbs) in the milk. Also added a fined chopped onion and added some garlic powder and worcestershire sauce. For cheese I added about 1 1/2 of shredded getost cheese and about 1/2 cup of cubed fresh mozzarella. Substituted barbecue sauce for ketchup.

Followed the recipe except as per other reviewers suggestions, grated the cheese. Also opted for bbq sauce instead of ketchup.  Kids both asked for seconds. Need I say more? So easy too.
Froze the second loaf pan for meatloaf again in a week or so.

11/15 My go-to meatloaf. T asks for it by name! 11/17 used 80/20 gr beef  instead of turkey per DH's request. Soaked the bread crumbs in the milk. Threw in Worchester, lots of garlic, parsley, Captain's blend seasoning from Topsail. Grated 6 baby carrots and finely chopped onion (or used dried onion, can't remember).  I made 2 loaves in a 9x13. Topped one loaf with ketchup, the other with barbecue sauce. Covered each loaf with a thin layer of my favorite bottled BBQ sauce. Put it in the fridge on Friday and baked on Monday.

The most delicious meatloaf I've ever made! My family prefers this turkey meatloaf over ground beef meatloaf. It's so easy and basic that I always have the ingredients on hand, so it's become one of my go-to recipes! I use a whole 20 ounce ground turkey package from Sam's Club. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I added worcestershire sauce and maple syrup to the ketchup. I didn't have colby cheese so I used cheddar and only put it on the top.  I added a handful of dry oats, garlic powder, and dehydrated onions. It was pretty good. I only had one pound of turkey and cooked it for 40 min and it reached 180 degrees.

I love this recipe - it is easy to make and tastes amazing.  I've borrowed tips from other reviewers (thank you).  I mix the milk and the bread crumbs to fluff them up a bit.  I add more veggies - diced onion, diced celery, shredded carrot and shredded zucchini.   I amp up the seasoning with onion power, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce and pepper.  I use BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup.

This was delicious.  I soaked the bread crumbs in Almond milk.  I used the cheeses I had on hand; a mixture of gouda, cheddar horseradish and Swiss, and topped the loaf with a small amount of BBQ sauce.   I also grated some onion and garlic in the mixture.  The mixture looked a bit wet from the onion, so I crumbled a piece of whole wheat bread.  Turned out perfect.

Excellent recipe. I had a 93% lean ground turkey in the traditional package of 1 1/4lb so I had to adjust accordingly. I used just under a 1/2 cup of milk and just over 1/2 cup Italian dry breads. I also only used 4oz cheddar cheese (it was plenty) and added some garlic powder and 1/4 cup of grated fresh onion. I followed other users' advice and mixed some BBQ sauce with ketchup to make about 1/2 cup total. Will make again!

pale looking but tasty-- maybe mix 1lb turkey with 1lb ground beef. Shredded cheese is fine if you don't have cubes.

I added Worcestershire. Liquid smoke. A few dashes of hot sauce. BBQ seasoning. Garlic powder. Grated Onions and garlic per other reviews. Paprika. Plain panko bread crumbs and let soak in milk for a few minutes to fluff up per other reviews. Instead of cubes I grated the cheese. And instead of using 2lbs of Turkey I used 1.25lbs of ground turkey and 1lb of mild Italian sausage (no casings). And then on top of the loaf I put ketchup and BBQ sauce before putting it into the oven. I make this probably once a week in our house, my husband and our dinner guests have all LOVED it! The flavor is out of this world. You can also use this same recipe and make burgers out of it. So delish!!

This is wonderful!  One change I suggest you try, it is very good and I always do this for topping on Meatloaf.  Add Worchester Sauce to the Catsup, mix well to your taste, I add a TBS of brown sugar just for a yummy taste.....Try it!    Duana Hoffhines (Florida)

Very easy & delicious. Did not use milk; cut back on ground turkey, crumbs & egg: used 1.5 lb ground turkey, 1/2 c crumbs & 1 egg. Added diced fresh tomato, fresh peas, onion & garlic. Seasoned w/parsley & Italian seasoning. Very moist. Enjoyable as entree, cold meatloaf sandwich & hot w/morning egg breakfast. It's a keeper.

I gave 4 stars only because I felt the need to add some things in order to make it 5 star.  Added onion, garlic, carrots, red pepper flakes, fresh thyme, and subbed BBQ sauce for ketchup.  Next time I will also add worcestershire sauce.  Very good!

Made exactly as instructed. Ironically this made me think of sausage cheese balls; which I didn't mind. I'll make it again, but will likely tweak it for more flavour.

I've made this recipe dozens of times.  It is my go to meatloaf recipe.  The only things I have changed are, I use 1 lb. regular ground turkey and 1 lb. Italian style and I use fresh ground bread crumbs.  Everyone who has ever tried this has loved it.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I've never been a fan of ANY type of meatloaf growing up, until I made this recipe!!
MOIST!
FAVORABLE!
CHEESY!

My husband was very fond of this recipe and we both agreed it was definitely a keeper!

Although, I did make slight changes but nothing major.

-I added a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce into the meat.
-Seasoning salt instead of regular salt.
(Added a bit more salt than the recipe called for)
-I did let it marinate the night
-Finally, the next day as I was ready to cook, I added in the breadcrumbs soaked in milk (that way the breadcrumbs didn't mush up the night before)
-Tossed in cubed Mozzarella cheese (not too big)
-Cooked at 375 for about 40-50 minutes since I only baked a pound of meatloaf.

Served with mashed potato's, gravy, and corn

I had not had turkey meatloaf prior to this. This recipe made me realize the idea of turkey meatloaf is not a bad one (the reason for the two starts). I felt the recipe did not have enough flavor, but not sure if that's because of it being turkey or just not enough flavor. I will not be making this again. But I will be looking for another turkey meatloaf.

Delicious!  I followed the recommendations found in another review and added a half an onion, three cloves of garlic, and some worstecheir sauce.  I had plain bread crumbs at home, but I added an italian seasoning blend.  The meatloaf had great flavor and we loved the chunks of cheese throughout.  I used two packages of Jennie-o ground turkey which are 1.5 pounds each and had enough to make two meatloaves, one of which we stuck in the freezer for later.

This is a keeper! I made half of the recipe, and after 45 minutes it was deliciously crispy. Used a bit less cheese than called for too.

Absolutely loved this! I took some advice from other reviews and added fresh diced onions and garlic powder to the mix. I also soaked the bread crumbs in the milk and used famous Dave's rich and sassy barbeque sauce  to coat the top.  I could not believe my taste buds this was so good! I've made regular meatloaf before but this turkey loaf is on a whole another level of awesome. Seriously try it you won't regret it !

Great new recipe! I adjusted it by adding in 1 small grated onion and 1 small grated green squash (what I had on hand) to add some more flavor and help us eat more veggies.  It made the mixture more moist than I wanted, so I needed to add a few more breadcrumbs in.  I used 1 lb of turkey, 1 egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, a dash of liquid smoke, onion, squash, breadcrumbs (soaked in milk), cubed cheddar and a squirt of BBQ sauce in the mix.  It took just about 1 hour exactly and was delicious and so easy.  Will definitely make again!

This is a very good alternative recipe for meatloaf. I followed reviews of others and added a few of my own ingredients, and I think it's great! I add about 3 tablespoons of finely chopped onion, 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, a dash of Worchestershire sauce and an extra teaspoon of dried Italian seasoning. I also use shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of the cubed cheese. Everyone I've made this for loves it.

This meatloaf turned out fantastic. I made it over a friends house where she loves her husbands meatloaf. He was working that night I happened to make this and I think she liked this one better than her husbands. I had 1.5 lbs of hamburger already thawed in the fridge so used that instead of the turkey. I also did add plenty more seasoning as well and glad that I did as I do think it would have been a bit bland as some of the other reviews have stated. The cheese was fantastic, I am not sure how much I used, I am sure more than called for :) I also did add brown sugar to the ketchup for a sweet flavor. Will be making again!

This came out good, but only with BBQ sauce on it.  Otherwise it was strangely bland when I expected more flavor from the seasoned breadcrumbs.  Also, I only had shredded cheese on hand, and that was totally lost in it, so go with the recipe and use the Colby chunks!

sometimes turkey can be tasteless, but thi is a great recipe. I added a teaspoonful of Cavender's seasoning to give it extra flavor and found it to be a great meatloaf.

I made this with a couple of variations.  I chopped up a cup of red and green pepper and added that to the mixture, along with a packet on Lipton onion soup mix.  I used a combination of cheddar and mozzarella cheese, topped it with spaghetti sauce instead of ketchup and when just about done, I added mozzarella to the top broiled it just until the cheese bubbled and turned golden.  Relish!

I put into a small casserole dish rather than loaf pan to address the issues some reviewers have had with extended cooking times and the cheese bubbling over in the oven and still had to cook for about an hour and a half to ensure the middle was done. Was still flavorful and moist throughout! I did substitute sweet and tangy BBQ sauce for the ketchup and added a couple tablespoons to the loaf before mixing all the ingredients.  Will definitely be making again!

I halved the recipe and used 1 pound of turkey.  I used homemade wheat breadcrumbs, added some dried onion, worcestershire sauce, shredded colby/jack cheese, and a bit of BBQ sauce on top.  I baked it for 1 hour in loaf pan.  It turned out great and the family loved it!

This is an awesome recipe for the lazy cook.  Very easy and quick to make.  I used 50/50 bbq sauce and ketchup on top.  I will make this all the time.  Might even add onions next time.

This was really good and really easy!  Like others, I added some garlic and Worcestershire sauce as well as BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and it turned out great.  My husband, who usually turns his nose up at eating ground turkey over beef, really liked it and ate the leftovers for lunch the next day.  I will definitely make again!

Might I suggest glazing the top with cranberry sauce/jelly mixed with or without hot sauce or red pepper jelly. It is a nice alternate to ketchup or BBQ sauce.

When I make a meat loaf. I usually line a rimed pan with parchment paper. Then make the meat loaf in the shape of a football. I try to make it the same thickness, so it cooks evenly. And if the cheese oozes out it ends up on the rimed parchment  paper. I will be making this turkey meat loaf next week, sounds great.

Very good recipe my whole family loves. It's easy to make. My kid loves that it is filled with chunks of cheese.

Funny Thing....I JUST made this a few nights ago!  Have had this recipe for about 5 years....ALWAYS a hit with everyone.  I usually half the recipe though because we only have a family of 3 now.  :)  Happy Cooking Everyone!

Great flavor!  Recipe was hearty and stood up to traditional beef meatloaf.  Next time I will add extra egg to hold it together better.  It was a bit crumbly.  Will definitively make again.

I made this for my family last night, and it was fairly good.  It could use a bit more flavor, so next time I will add some onion and garlic.  My 18 month old loved it though, which goes a long way in my book!

Finalllllllly a meatloaf that my fiancé enjoys! After 2 years of trying to add meatloaf to our dinner repertoire  I finally found a recipe that tastes good to the both of us. He even went back for seconds, Yayy! I didn't have Colby Jack cheese on hand so I substituted 3/4 cup of mexican shredded cheese and it tasted yumm.

When I think meatloaf, I think "quick and easy prep." Too many of the meatloaf recipes shown have a ridiculous ingredient list- this had the basics and that is what I was looking for! Both my kids loved it. I sheered 15 minutes off the cooking time by using a glass pie plate instead of a loaf pan. Will DEFINITELY be making this again.

very tasty but I added a lot more seasoning. Love the cheese but the loaf doesn't hold together well when cutting (but that also might be because i used real bread instead of breadcrumbs)

This was okay. Not good or great, just okay. I thought it lacked something, but not sure what. It was pretty tasteless. My husband simply did not like it. He likes meatloaf, actually likes most things, but not this meatloaf! I didn't have Colby cheese, so I used cheddar, but I doubt that would have made the final result that much better. Sounded good, wasn't bad, but won't make again.

To make this just a little tastier, In addition to using Italian Breadcrumbs, I also use Jennie-o Italian Season ground turkey.
 - If you want to make it really, really outstanding however, use one package of the Jennie-O Italian turkey, and one package of Kobe burgers from Trader Joes.... Sure it adds to calories, but its not exactly low fat with all that cheese anyway. ;)

I don't know how to break it to my grandma, but her meatloaf recipe has been unsurped. This recipe was so darn tasty, the entire loaf was gone with no leftovers for the next days usual meatloaf sandwiches! It tasted like a killer cheeseburger, and was very easy to make.

Great recipe!  My husband and I loved it!  Even my son loved it, and this was after he swore he hated meatloaf.  I added finely chopped onion to the ground turkey mixture and used pico de gallo instead of ketchup.  I also used slices of Velveeta (reduced fat) instead of chunks of cheese and put half of the mixture in, topped that with the cheese slices and then the remaining mixture and then pico de gallo on top of all that.

Pretty simple recipe and very tasty.  The only change I made was to mix in about half a packet of the Lipton onion soup mix (b/c I had it lying around from a previous recipe).  I added a side of garlic mashed potatoes, and both of my daughters cleaned their plates (which NEVER happens).  As with ground turkey, it's sometimes tough to tell when it's cooked, so cooking this a few minutes past the recommended hour certainly didn't hurt mine or dry it out in any way...I think it even enhanced the flavor to add about 10 minutes to the cooking time.

My husband and I have made this recipe over and over. We make it exactly "as is" except cut down on the cheese. We found if you use 1/4 pound colby and slice in very small cubes, every bite gets cheese and it's healthier! So good! Thank you!

This was so good! I soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk before adding in. I also added some additional seasonsing for taste. My husband was not thrilled about the idea of turkey meatloaf - but, he loved it!

I tricked my boyfriend into eating turkey meatloaf.  I tried fresh mozzarella instead of cheddar and it was delicious.  All leftovers gone in 2 days!

Excellent recipe!! I made some changes to lower the calories - used ground turkey breast, subbed some 35-calorie per cup dairy product for the milk, and used 4 string cheeses cut into pieces instead of Colby. I'd probably omit the cheese completely next time. 

It turned out so juicy, though! I was shocked. Definitely a winner! 

Can't wait to try it with the tasty cheese one day!

Added a garlic clove, chopped parsley, and worstecheir. Agree with another reviewer - bigger cubes makes for yummy puddles. We don't like ketchup in our house so I added more cheese and breadcrumbs to the top - it made a yummy crust. My husband doesn't like meatloaf (so he says), but he went back for seconds!

My family loves this recipie - I substitute the ketchup with diced tomatoes in the meatloaf and on top.  It  makes a huge improvment to the taste.  We have also tried adding Giardinara for a little kick.

It doesn't get much easier than this and the family liked it. I used 1/4 ketchup, 1/4 cup BBQ sauce on top. I only used half a pound of Colby Jack cheese and made the cheese cubes smaller. It needed a tray underneath to catch liquid bubbling over. Next time I should add chopped onion and Worcestershire sauce too. 2nd NOTE: Used shredded cheese this time. The ground turkey sold is less than 2 lbs so remember to use less milk/egg/bread crumbs. Had to cover w/ foil at end so topping doesn't burn.

Hmm- this meatloaf was very "white" - my 10 year old thought it was a piece of bread. I think it needs some color ie instead of milk use tomato juice (v8 maybe ?) or Worchester as some suggested. Otherwise it was ok! It just looked a little pale for a meatloaf.

Great! Hubby says I can make it anytime. I did add some olive oil when I mixed it. I used shredded cheddar cheese because of hubby's restricted diet, and only a very slight drizzle of ketchup on top (again the restrictions.)

The texture is nice but I expected the Cheese to melt more. I may try a different type of cheese next time like cheddar. Still it was very tasty, just go easy on the salt. I added some onion soup mix which which is why the taste was more salty. I know what to omit when I made this again.

Made just how recipe suggested.  Put cookie sheet under the loaf pan to catch drips.  It was great!

Delicious!!! Really good, I was hesitant about the cubed cheese and didn't put in as much as it called for but no worries, it was great!! Next time I will use the cheese as they suggest but NOTE....DO PUT LOAF ON COOKIE SHEET TO BAKE! The cheese gets bubbly and will go over, so to avoid a mess or fire in your oven put on a cookie sheet. but definatley 5 stars...family loved!

I love this recipe as an alternative to beef/pork versions of meatloaf, but I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it could be more flavorful. Since I have an allergy to tomatoes I always have to find other ways to substitute tomato; and that's usually to boost the seasoning. So I added onions, Worchester sauce, grated Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder; but reduced the milk to just 1/2 cup (my personal preference). You can use cheddar if you don't have Colby and the recipe will still turn out great. Thanks for posting!

This was excellent.  My 6 yr old loved it and asked for more.  I added the shredded carrots described by others, made one loaf with barbecue sauce and one with ketchup on the top and added spices without measuring (ground onion, garlic, parsley, approx a tsp of each).  I left the cheese in cubes and believe that added to the flavor and appeal.  I used a sharp cheddar.

This was delish! I added a few things to make it a little more flavorful though... of course added a ton of garlic to the meat mixture as well as about 3/4 chopped onion.  I also way overdid it with the seasonings and added a little bit of dried basil & thyme... now for the real secret ingredient... sprinkled lots brown sugar on the top of the ketchup.  So yummy and great for a fall dinner!!

Husband and 2 year old loved it!! As did I. Took others suggestions and added 1/2 onion, carrot, squash, garlic and a few other things to add a little extra flavor. Also, good tip on using a drip pan...read that post too late and now have to clean a very messy oven.

I recommend using Jennie-O turkey.  The best meatloaf I've ever made.  Even my husband liked it.  Had to use Monterey Jack because Colby wasn't available.  Yumm!

Very good!  I let the bread crumbs sit in the milk as suggested in another review, added about half an onion and worcestershire sauce, and used 2% milk.

Incredibly delicious too!  I used 1/4 less Colby cheese and cut them into smaller cubes so it would feel like more.  Even eliminating that amount still made it a wonderful recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Quick, easy, and delicious!  My husband looked at it and said it didn't look as good as my usual meatloaf.  (I never made a turkey meatloaf before).  He thought it looked dry - but once he tasted it he realized looks aren't everything!  It was very moist and flavorful!  I will definitely be making this again.  I might try it at 350 instead of 400 degrees though as the edges of mine were a bit overdone.

WOW!  I don't normally buy ground turkey.  But, someone gave some to us for free, so I set out to look for a recipe that I could put it in.  I was expecting this to be just okay.  I absolutely, positively underestimated it.  Delicious!  I used sharp cheddar cheese and a good splash of worcestershire sauce, then topped it with bbq sauce.  Made half the recipe and my boyfriend and I ate the whole thing it was so yummy.  On a final note - like other reviewers mentioned, you can't really tell it's turkey instead of hamburger, which I like.

My husband wanted me to say, "It saved our marriage!" OK, that might be an overstatement, but this was very yummy! :) It has earned a place in our regular supper rotation. I halved the recipe since I only had 1 lb. of turkey, and it worked great! I baked it for about 50 minutes, added some brown sugar to the ketchup on top.

I'm not sure what I missed but this wasn't great.  I soaked the breadcrumbs in milk and added shredded carrots and Worchestshire sauce.  Definitely will not use barbeque sauce next time.

Delicious! My husband and I LOVED this!! I only had cheddar on hand, and also I had to substitute oats for the breadcrumbs (but added some italian seasonings and a little more s&p than called for), but it came out fantastic! Like others have recommended, put a cookie sheet under the loaf pan to catch drips and spill-overs. So tasty!

I've made this 6 or 7 times, made it for our 2nd anniversary stay at home dinner last night! It really is as good as the vast majority of the reviews say. After going through dozens of reviews and making it several times myself, I find that adding a finely grated midsize carrot, about a 1/2 cup of finely grated yellow onion, and letting the breadcrumbs soak in the milk turns out one tasty meatloaf!! I make two loaves in a 9 x 13 pan - usually the packing sizes of ground turkey gives about 2.25 lbs.  I use 45% reduced fat cheese and it's just as gooey and delicious as regular. Topped with a thick and spicey bbq sauce....soooo good!
The recipe posted as is is awesome, though it's super easy to tweek into whatever works for you and your family. Big thanks to the contributor!

I read the reviews and knew I needed to bulk/spice it up.  I used a small zucchini grated up, a 20 oz. pklg of ground turkey, and I also added a package of beef ramen noodles and the flavoring kit.  I added a dash of garlic powder, a sprinkly of dried onions and use lower fat Sargento mexican cheese (2 8oz. pkgs).  My entire family including my daughter who does not like meatloaf, loved it and ate almost all of it.  Next time I will make 2 by putting half and half in separate loaf pans.  Excellent 'base" recipe.

This is absolutely one of my family's new favorites!!  I have made it three times now.  I stay very close to the main recipe, with just a couple of tweaks recommended by the other reviewers - I add an onion, some fresh garlic, and poultry seasoning.  The cheese is magical somehow!!  I haven't used cheese cubes yet because I haven't had block cheese.  I always have shredded cheese and it works just great.  This makes really yummy leftovers too.  If you love cheese, you must try this!  It is better than any other turkey meatloaf I have tried.

Very good. I mixed 1lb ground beef with 1 lb ground turkey (that's all I had on hand), put the bread crumbs in the milk, added some garlic and worst. sauce and per other recommendations. This makes a lot. I opted to put it in a small oval shaped corning ware dish (bigger than a loaf pan) and didn't have any bubble out (used cheese cubes). I topped with bbq sauce and baked an hour. It was very good.

This went down a treat with my family and is something that I'll definitely do again. Simple and tasty and so convenient, what else could you ask for. Makes a great lunchbox, cold with fresh salad.  Colby is not easily found in Ireland so I swapped it for Edam which worked well. I also omitted the optional ketchup as it's not an ingredient I particularly like using. I increased the pepper to give it extra zing and it worked really well.  Going shopping for the ingredients to make this one again... by popular demand.

Awesome!  My whole family loved it, which is are to accomplish.  I read many reviews that suggested onion and garlic - which I did as well - and it came out amazing.  This will be a staple for sure!

I really enjoyed this- the health food store I went to didn't have turkey (go figure) so i had to use beef instead, but it was still great. I also added bell peppers, onion, garlic salt and worchester (sp?) sauce. Also used monterey instead of colby. Easy recipe for a beginner like myself

Turkey stayed very moist, loved the oozing cheese from each piece!  I didn't change a thing and loved it.  Next time, I will add some sauteed diced onion and garlic powder to spice it up a little bit.  DO NOT FORGET TO PUT A BAKING SHEET UNDERNEATH TO CATCH FALLING MELTED CHEESE!

The kids loved it!  Even our picky 2-year-old.  We used cheddar instead of Colby because that was what we had in the fridge.  In our oven (high elevation maybe?) it took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook all the way through.

I really liked this alot, better than groundbeef. I think if you wanted too, you could make this without the cheese cubes it was that moist & good. I did follow the suggestions & added 3 grated baby carrots, used 1 small (tiny) white onion chopped up super good so the kids didn't know it was in there. next time would half the amt of brown sugar, it was too sweet with the ketchup but still good. I didn't have cheese splashing out of my pan and I did use cubed cheese and I did soak the bread crumbs in the milk before adding it in. I did let it sit one hour before baking- I dont know if this did make a difference compared to the original recipe because I never tryed it that way but I can tell you that it did come out perfect! minus the overly sweet ketchup but thats an easy fix for next time.

This meatloaf was a HUGE hit at my house with people who don't like traditional meatloaf!  I used a microplane to grate a zucchini and half of a large yellow onion to mix into the meat.  This way my son gets some veggies and doesn't even know hit!  Like others suggested, I soaked my bread crumbs in the milk before adding to the meat mixture.  Definitely use a drip pan in the oven!  This meatloaf was moist, flavorful and cheesy!  Delicious!

This is surprisingly delicious for how simple the process and ingredients were.   I used ground turkey breast and also used panko crumbs with minced garlic and Italian seasonings instead of the Italian bread crumbs because that's what I had.   It was very good! Kids and husband loved it. This is an easy family pleaser.

Following others advice, I added Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt, minced garlic, 1/2 onion, garlic salt. I must not have "folded" the cheese well enough as most of it was in the top of the loaf.  But still tasty enough to eat.  Next time I will use less onion.

This was great!  I'm usually not a big fan of meatloaf, but, this is a keeper.  I'm already trying to figure out when to make it again! I'm also not a big fan of ketchup on meatloaf, so, I did substitute barbecue sauce.  Phenomenal!

My family loved this meatloaf! Several of them went back for seconds. I used chopped up shallots and added barbeque sauce on top. I only had med cheddar, so that's what I used. Next time I will probably use more bread crumbs or less milk because it was very moist.

I liked this recipe, but I found that it was fairly greasy because of the cheese. That might have been because I used ground beef instead of ground turkey though! I also used BBQ sauce on top instead of ketchup after reading some revies, but actually thought the ketchup would have been better! I did add a dash of worchestire sauce and I'm glad I did. Altogether though, it was yummy!

This was very good but I did jazz it up quite a bit from what this recipe called for. I added onion and green pepper, as well as some ketchup, mustard and worcestershier sauce. I didn't have any Colby cheddar cheese so I just ended up using all shredded cheddar. It turned out very tasty. This recipe is a wonderful base but it's very easy to add lots more flavor by adding other simple ingredients.

Incredibly easy and delicious! Add some grated carrots and onions. I also grated the cheese instead of cubing. Great recipe.

First time ground turkey eaters. We loved it! However...we LOVE cheese and didn't even use a fraction of what this called for. We also like to coat our meatloaf in the ketchup/brownsugar/mustard mix so more cheese would have been a little overwhelming. I just eyeballed it. I took the advise of others and added the garlic, Worcestershire, and onion seasoning. We cut it in half and cooked it for 40 minutes. Wonderful!

Really liked the cheesey cubes in the meatloaf - and the loaf turned out pretty good, just needed a bit more flavor.  Will use more spices next time.

Good recipe. Will make again.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I didn't think it was as amazing and incredible as some others.  Just a good basic meatloaf.

This is the BEST meatloaf!  We use regular beef, however and a different topping:  ketchup, a squirt of mustard, a dab of Western French dressing, and about 1/4-1/2 cup brown sugar!   EVERYONE loves this meatloaf!

This was a great recipie and the turkey stayed moist.  The cheese globs were the best.  I also really liked the BBQ sauce on top.  Only thing I did different was add extra salt and pepper and meatloaf seasoning.  Can't believe I found a turkey dish my husband loved!

WoW! That was awesome. We just finished eating it. My five year old ate it and hes super picky. The only think I changed was the colby cheese was shredded instead of cubed because thats what all I had. Wonderful, will make again.

The only thing I did differently was that I used shredded reduced fat colby cheese. It was outstanding! My fiance said it was better than his mother's meatloaf! Thanks for the recipe! Will make it again!

I made changes to this recipe, based on other reviewer's suggestions, so I cannot give THIS recipe 5 stars. I added onion soup packet to meat mixture, used chunks of cheese (not grated), added Worcestershire sauce to top. Also brushed with Kona Sweet Maui Onion barbeque sauce, which added a tangy sweetness. Sooo good like this.

THIS IS ABSOLUTLEY FABULOUS. If I could give it 2000000 stars, I would. It is absolutely wonderful. i have run out of words to describe it. My family, who are VERY picky eaters by the way, gobbled this up and ased for MORE.

Amazing meatloaf!!! I cut the recipe in half, since there's just two of us.  I added garlic salt instead of regular salt and added minced onion.  It was so moist and flavorful.  Can't wait to make it again.

I have never cared for meatloaf until I started using this recipe!  This is probably one of my most frequently used.  It is easy, cheesy, and delicious! I usually some extra spices, and tonight I am trying bacon bits, we will see how it turns out! Delicious I am sure!

This was so moist and tasty!  It was such a hit in my house that we finished the whole loaf in one meal!  I used shredded colby/mont jack cheese instead and let it all marinate together in the refrigerator for an hour before baking.  For the topping I mixed ketchup with 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was perfect!  I will definately be making this again!

This meatloaf was the best I have made! I had 2 turkey italian sausage links leftover from another meal and I added them to the ground turkey. Other than that, everything else was the same and it came out perfect. Simple recipe and super flavorful.

Delicious! I think this is my favorite turkey loaf now. I used less cheese and breadcrumbs to make it more healthy. Also added more seasonings. We ate this with wild rice and Fried Broccoli.

I wish I could give this a higher rating.  Although it wasn't bad, it wasn't all that good either.  Only difference was, instead of plain ketchup on top, I used a ketchup, mustard, brown sugar mixture.  that made it a bit better.    I doubt I will be making this again.

This is absolutely fantastic.  In lieu of topping with ketchup, I topped with a 2 tsp of my fav bbq sauce.  It was actually nice running out of ketchup, because this substitute would not have happened otherwise.  I also reduced the recipe to 3 servings as my charming husband was recently diagnosed with Diabetes, and this seems to be the best way to portion control.  Reducing to 3 servings worked perfectly.  Hands down, this is my new favorite meatloaf recipe.  Who knew that something so healthly (barring the cheese) could taste so delish! Thanks for sharing.

I've tried so many recipes in the past year, just having fun with the experimentation, but I had yet to make anything truly delicious.  I have now tried this turkey meatloaf and can safely say, with no reservations; "Deliciousness achieved". Wow, so good!

I've been using the same tried and true glazed meatloaf recipe forever, since it's the only one my family likes. I decided to go out on a limb and try this and I think this make have replaced my old go-to sugar-laden recipe! Thank you!!!

I cut this recipe in half (1lb turkey) since there is only 2 of us.  I added Lipton Onion soup and a mixture of Panko italian bread crumbs and Stove Top Stuffing for Chicken, I also added a little ketchup in the mixture.  Fantastic and VERY tasty! I didn't add any salt as the onion soup already had salt in it.

I never ever thought I would love a meatloaf that was made with anything but ground beef but this was fantastic.  Even my beef eating husband liked it.  I did spice it up though - I used Italian Seasoned Jenny O Ground Turkey and I used pepperjack cheeck instead of Colby.  AWESOME!

This was great! But I only gave it four stars because of a couple reasons. I thought the bread crumbs made it a little mushy. I usually make my meat loaf with oat meal which gives it a little more texture. I also didn't care for such a strong Italian seasoning flavor. Lastly, I personally think it would be better with shredded cheese so it's cheesy throughout the whole loaf. Adding some garlic and onion also increases the flavor of the ground turkey. Over all it's a great recipe and I'll make again with a few changes.

I cut this recipe in half, but other than that made no changes. This is another good, cheap, quick, semi-nutritious, delicious weekday recipe. I have found a couple of other meatloaf recipes on this site that I like better, but they are all made w/ beef and require me to chop something. This recipe is a bit different and will be in our monthly rotation. Thanks!

This meatloaf rules!  We are a cheese loving family and everyone loves this stuff.  If you are not a big cheese eater, I would reduce the cheese because it is alot.

as is this recipe is ok. if i make again i would add more spices and i also used bbq sauce on this instead of ketchup. the bbq sauce went well with the turkey and cheese.  there was no problem with this being dry, it actually came out very moist. will make again with modifications.

This was very good and very easy. I used another member's idea and used stuffing mix instead of breadcrumbs (needed to get rid of the box before it expired) and it turned out great! Will make again for sure.

This was very very good. I made some changes.  I put in a 1/4 cup of chopped onions and 1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper. I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I got regular bread and put two tablespoons of chopped garlic, a couple teaspoons of Worcestershire, and a 1/4 cup water and mixed it all together. I also put some dijon mustard in with the ketchup for the top. I used the shredded cheese, but next time I will DEFINITELY use the cubes. The globs of cheesiness will just make it so much better. Since I used 3 lbs, I divided them into two pans. They still bubble up but not over.  I will be making this again very soon.

INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS...Made my meatloaf with a Mexican twist: 1 lb ground turkey, 1 egg, 1 cup seasoned breadcrumbs and 6oz  of shredded Mexican cheese.  I added these spices: minced garlic, chili powder,  Mrs. Dash chipolte flavor and some salsa verde (green chiles would work well too) My sauce for top: Mix together equal parts Chili sauce, salsa verde and some medium Chi Chi's salsa.  This gave it a nice kick. Spanish rice was my side dish.  This tasted better than most ground beef recipes!.Cooked it for an hour. Can't wait to have a cold meatloaf sandwich tomorrow!

Great Recipe. Like a few of the other allrecipe chefs I added shredded carrots and zucchini. I also decided to use shredded cheese rather than the cubed. The loaf had good texture and a nice even cheesy flavor. The only suggestion is to use less salt.

Really yummy and easy! Here are my changes: 1) I seasoned the meat with garlic salt and onion powder. 2) I used stove top stuffing in place of the breadcrumbs -this gives a really delicious flavor and plumps up well it milk, to retain a moist meatloaf. 3) I folded in shredded chedder rather than the cubed Colby.

Really good!  I made several changes. Used 1 1/2 lb of ground turkey and 1/2 lb of ground chicken sausage, used 1 cup shredded monterey jack cheese, reduced milk to 1/3 cup, used only 1 egg, and used unseasoned bread crumbs.  Also added diced onion, diced celery, ground sage, fresh italian parsely, thyme, and oregano.  Topped the meatloaf with a sprinkling of panko bread crumbs. Baked in a casserole dish at 400 for 1 hour.

This is only the second time I've had meatloaf.  I wasn't sure if it was good or not, but must have been better than good b/c my bf had 3 slices, and the leftovers the next day and asked me to make it again 3 days later!  It's delicious!

Delish!!  I have never made meatloaf before and I wouldn't even eat it as a kid, but this was very good!  I used shredded cheese and added oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, A-1 steak sauce, worcestershire sauce, and a pinch of chili powder.  I used BBQ and A-1 as a glaze but I felt the BBQ was a little too sweet.  Next time I will mix ketchup and worcestershire for the glaze.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

My family and I really enjoyed this meatloaf... my husband and I have never really been big meatloaf fans, but this was exceptional! I made a couple minor changes, but other than that it was beyond my expectations. I don't really like the taste of all ground turkey, so I changed it too 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb. ground beef. I then added some minced garlic to the mix, some onion, and sprinkled brown sugar on top of the ketchup. For me, the cooking time for the meatloaf was a little off. I ended up having to cook it for almost 2 hours, instead of the 1 hour that was recommended. I took it out at 1 hour and it was still luke warm in the middle and mushy, but this recipe still deserves 5 stars in my opinion. :o) Happy Cooking!!

I agree with the pan underneath to save your oven from fire, I followed the recipe exactly except I added a packet of french onion soup mix.  It was awesome! Thanks for the recipe.

This is so good.  I do admit that you should cube the cheese.  Don't shred it.  I added BBQ sauce on the top and used a high quallity freshly ground turkey meat whole foods.  Wonderful!

I am not a meatloaf fan, but I thought this might be OK due to the cheese chunks. The meatloaf turned out very breadcrumb tasting and dry. I even added extra seasoning like garlic powder, parsely, and oregano. It took almost 2 hours to bake and I had even allowed extra time. It also made a mess out of my oven. Needless to say, this recipe has not changed my mind about meatloaf.

This was great! I added 2 large cloves of garlic and a packet of onion soup mix ( left out the salt because soup mix is salty, but it was still a little on the salty side. Maybe will try dried onion flakes next time.)

I ended up using ground lean beef, added worstshire (Spelling) sauce and garlic powder. We loved it! The cheese was great!

This was a VERY, VERY delicious recipe. My husband, who just started cooking this year, made this recipe. It was very simple to make. He did make a couple substitutions, using shredded cheese in place of the block cheese and crumbled ritz crackers in place of seasoned bread crumbs. My oldest daughter, who is a picky eater enjoyed this dish; she went back for seconds.

Delicious. Even my boyfriend who doesn't like for me to cook with ground turkey LOVED this meatloaf. I thought it was even better than my beef version. I used grated cheese, additional seasonings, chopped onions, and worcestershire sauce. You can dress this up any way you like. I would recommend making extra sauce for the top and draining the extra juices from the pan about three quarters of the way through cooking time.

Fast, easy, delicious, filling, inexpensive.  What more could you ask for?  Served with parmesan cous cous and raw veggies and dip.  I did take it out of the oven once the internal temp registered at 155, and it reached 165 within minutes after removing.  I'll make this again!

I LOVE THIS! since my family does like a little more spice/seasoning, i stole the worcestershire (yes, thats the correct spelling) sauce tip from dee, and the A-1 tip from brandex... and i do like to add onions to alot of what i cook, so of course this was no exception... but this was absolutely DELICIOUS! my wife and daughters ask for this on a weekly basis! thanks so much Brooke for sharing! best meatloaf ever!

This was VERY good!!!! I soaked the bread crumbs in the milk and then added this mushy mixture to the meat.  I added a half of an onion chopped and two cloves of garlic chopped. I also added a few slashes of worsteshire sauce, and a half a can of tomato sauce into the meat.  I poured the remaining tomato sauce on top of the meatloaf.  I did use the cubed cheese and cut them into smaller cubes, it was great this way.  We had leftovers and it was just as great the next day.  Next time I'm going to try it with beef and see which one I like better but the turkey was awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

Great, easy recipe. I made the following changes/additions after reading the reviews. I added some chopped onion, garlic, green bell pepper, celery, and worcestershire sauce to the mix. While I was preparing the ingredients I let the breadcrumbs soak in the milk (also I only had 1 lb of turkey so I only used 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs & milk). I topped the loaf with some ketchup and brown sugar mixed together. I did put a cookie sheet under the loaf pan to catch any drippings. Mid-way through I drained the grease and again when removing from the oven. Turned out great. I will be making this again maybe with sausage in the mix too.

Ok this is like the best ground turkey meatloaf that I've ever made!! I modified it a little. Didn't have any Italian seasoned breadcrumbs so I used homemade breadcrumbs from toasted bread and used one package of Good Seasons Zesty Italian Dressing mix and finally I didn't have cubed colby jack cheese so I used a shredded cheese blend that had colby in it. Turned out fabulous! You should try it!!

OMG, delicious doesn't even begin to describe this meatloaf.  I grated two large carrots into the mix and added brown sugar to the ketchup for the glaze.  My husband who doesn't eat meatloaf leftovers kept raiding the fridge for little samples of it.  Next time I made it I had to double it so there would be leftovers even after the midnight raidings.  A definite addition to the meal rotation!

Excellent. I used 1lb dark ground turkey and 1lb of ground chicken. I also added lots of garlic, onion powder and Worcestershire sauce. I used cheddar as that it what I had on hand. I didn't use as much as was called for in the recipe. I topped it off with Maple Chipotle Grille Sauce from Stonewall Kitchens. Leftovers were excellent.

This was very good!  I followed the review of a few others and soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk beforehand.  I also did not put in the "chunks" of cheese, instead I just put in a generous portion of shredded, turned out nice and cheesey!  I topped mine off with my husbands favorite BBQ sauce and he said that really added to the flavor.  I will definatley put this one in our menu rotation :o)

This was a great meatloaf.  I thought it tasted great! My family was not a huge fan of the texture, but they loved the taste.  I made it in a casserole dish instead of a loaf pan since it makes so much.  I will make this again, but I think I will use ground beef instead.

I give this 4 stars because it took a few tweaks to get it to 5 star taste.  I used 1lb of ground turkey white meat and 1lb of turkey breakfast sausage (a favorite at our house).  I went a little shy on the liquid and was glad because I had to add a dozen crackers to keep it from being turkey soup! I used grated hard mozzarella cheese as it is lower in fat than colby and tastes great.  I do not suggest cubing the cheese because it will bubble out of the pan even more than grated cheese. I strongly recommend following the suggestions of other reviewers and placing a cookie sheet on the bottom rack of the oven as this meatloaf drips a lot!  It has a great flavor and is an excellent base recipe that you can make into your family's favorite.

I thought this was pretty good, for something different.  It was easy to put together.  I baked it a little longer, but it was still kind of "mushy" towards the middle of the loaf.  The kids ate it and said it tasted good.

This is the first time I've used ground turkey. I added onion, garlic, cayenne, and worcestershire. I used extra sharp white cheddar (it really is important to have it in cubes). I topped it with bbq sauce the last 45 minutes. I made it like I do beef meatloaf, baking it in a casserole dish after shaping it into a loaf, at 350 for 1 1/2 hours. I had no problem with smoke or it spilling in the oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good base recipe. I added some diced onions, worcestershire sauce and garlic powder to the mix. Instead of topping with ketchup, i used barbeque sauce. It was really good, but still needs a little something. Will definately use again.

My 8 year old son loved it.  I didn't change a thing from the recipe other than halved it to use 1 lb. turkey and cooked in a 9x4 loaf pan.  So quick to make, and made the house smell great.

This meatloaf was awesome and healthy :0)! My husband loved it! I think I found a winner, will definitely make this again. I added onion, green, yellow and red bell pepper to this recipe, and used crumbled crackers and italian seasoning...still came out delicious! Great recipe!!!

Loved it! Made this just as stated and loved it.  I formed 3 smaller loafs and cooked on cookie sheet then cut into 12 slices and froze individually. This meatloaf is even better the next day.  Next time I will try to make it a little lower fat.  But was delish and would make again and again.

Big hit with adults and kids! Made the following changes, as suggested by many viewers: 1. let milk absorb bread crumbs before adding to mixture 2. added onion and garlic 3. added 1 tablespoon Worstershire sauce 4. used barbecue sauce on top 5. used shredded cheese 6. used two seperate pans  People could not believe it was turkey, as opposed to beef. Very yummy, easy and quick to make.

This was absolutely delicious, and even the kids had seconds!  My changes: I used shredded cheddar instead of cubed, and baked on a cookie sheet instead of a loaf pan.  Turned out beautifully!

Delicious! After reading other reviews, I  added garlic, onion, worcestershire sauce, and I replaced 1lb of turkey with 1.5 cups of shredded carrots. I also had no dried bread crumbs, but had three slices of bread going stale so I crumbled those up, added them to the milk and added some basil and oregano. I also used grated mozzerella as that was what I had and topped with BBQ sauce.  Everything worked wonderfully and I can't wait to make this easy dish again.

I'm going to try this with oats instead of bread crumbs and add some Italian seasoning.  My husband cannot eat bread in anyway so it will be easier for him to digest.

Great recipe! Kids loved it. Husband loved it. My mom loved it. So I know it was a winner. I adjusted the amount of milk, bread crumbs, and cheese since I didn't have a full 2 pounds of meat.

Very good I put this in a caserole so I did not have the overflow issues.I made 1/2  recipie added  3/4 sm onion diced 1 garlic clove minced 6 oz shredded mozzerella and about 12 oz cubed cheddar also added the worstershire pretty heavy handed with the splashes a splash of 1 tbl sp spicy bbq sauce in the mixture lots of pepper white,black and a little cayenne garlic (spices are the trick to ground turkey)liked by all nothing left maybe shouldn't have 1/2 since I here the sandwiches are so good according to others Cooked for 45 min at 400 let rest for 10 min I put some paper towels over it while it was resting to soak up some of the oil from the cheeses then brushed bbq sauce on top and returned to the oven for 5 min. Very good boys didn,t realize it was turkey LOL

Yummy- I did make many of the additions as others who have posted.  Added worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, diced onion, carrots and put barbecue sauce on top rather than ketchup.  Also used shredded colby.

This is very delicious and very easy.  My husband will even make it on his own!  We love it as is and sometimes, for variety, we will use pepper jack cheese and mix salsa or chipolte tabasco in with the ketchup.  It has become our go-to comfort food recipe.

I got slightly mixed reviews on this, but the biggest critic of all, my fiance, LOVED this! Instead of using salt, I used 1 tsp. of seasoning salt. I also added 1/2 cup of diced onion and 1/2 cup of diced green pepper, along with 3 tbsp. of steak sauce, and put 1/2 cup steak sauce on top of the meatloaf instead of ketchup. I used a little less cheese, and decided to go with cheddar instead of colby. Based on other reviews, I cooked this in a meatloaf dish with an aluminum pan on the shelf beneath it. As expected, there was some "overflow", but not as much as I expected. I think this one is a keeper.

Great and easy! I used 98% fat free chicken and about 2/3 the amount of cheese (aged cheddar), added some worcestershire sauce and it still turned out moist.

Really Good! Really Easy. Not a problem with the shredded cheese though. If you fold it in as directed and not worry about distributing it evenly, you'll still find pockets of oozy cheese throughout(although next time I'll try the cubed cheese). Also, definitely add some chopped onions and other seasonings that are your standbys.

Thanks Brooke, Wonderful and easy.  Read all the reviews and added their suggestions. I used pork/turkey mixed 50/50.  Substituted corn flakes in place of bread crumbs.  Added 1/2 cup of green and red bell peppers for a little more color and flavor. Cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. Served with peas and sweet potatoes. No cheddar here so replaced that with normal white sliced white sandwich cheese but I think any good cheese will do.  Anything that can be made into a sandwich the next day has to be great.  My wife loved it.

Good, Good, Good.  I added worchtisher sauce to this and gave it a little kick.  The italian breadcrumbs made a difference and was something new for us.  I would use this again and again.

Amazingly moist. I used shredded cheese. I added the shredded carrot and onion like another reviewer suggested. I will make it again for sure. Hubby voted it a YES too. Picky son loved it too. It's a winner.

I've never liked meatloaf before, but I loved this! I halved the recipe, added 1/4 c chopped onion, substituted garlic salt for reg salt and used half BBQ half ketchup for the topping. I used another reviewer's suggestion and took the meatloaf out when it hit 160 and covered it tight with foil until it reached the correct temp in order to keep it juicy.

I just made this for dinner and I was really pleased.  I made a turkey meatloaf before and there just wasn't enough seasoning so I remembered that when making this one.  I did what pretty much everyone else suggested; I soaked the breadcrumbs, added sauteed onions and garlic and random seasonings.  My favorite BBQ sauce for meatloaf is Jack Daniels No. 7 :)

VERY GOOD!  I was surprised at how good this meatloaf actually turned out.  I did add some minced green pepper and garlic as well as all spice and rosemary and it gave it a perfect touch.  As per others suggestions I also added brown sugar to the glaze.  I most certainly will be making this again soon!

Delicious!!!  This was easy and good.  I did soak the breadcrumbs in the milk, like others suggested, and added some garlic salt, a dash of worcestershire and ketchup to the mix.  And on top, I used half BBQ sauce, mixed with half ketchup, about 1/4 cup of each.  It is sooo good!

So easy to make...and so delicious!  I added some crushed garlic, but other than that, the recipe was perfect.  Baking the meatloaf in a loaf pan eliminates any possiblity of the cheese dripping out, as other reviewers mentioned.

This meatloaf was a HUGE hit in my house.  I did read some of the reviews and doctored the recipe accordingly.  I added 2 tbs. worcestershire sauce, some chopped onion and garlic, I soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk like the other reviews suggested and I used season salt instead of table salt.  I only used about 1/3 of the amount of cheese it called for, and used a 2% reduced fat mexican blend which was shredded.  Beware though I had to cook it for an hour an a half to get the internal temp to 180.  My children and husband really loved it.  It was moist and very tasty, I will definitely be making this one again!

I make this almost weekly and, like other reviewers, I add veggies in. I grate a carrot, a small zucchini and a small onion into this meatloaf. Sometimes I use a BBQ sauce on top, sometimes not and both are great. I always divide this recipe into two 9x13 loaves. My toddler and my husband both love this and it gets some veggies in them. YUM!

Great recipe. Made a few changes ... I used 1 lb ground turkey and 1 package of Jennie-O Hot Italian Sausage (remove casing!). Also upped the bread crumbs to 1 1/2 cups and added half a yellow onion.

The cubed cheese is my family's favorite part of this recipe. I grate carrot, celery, and zucchini plus add some chopped onion to the meat. I also add a few dashes of tamari. Excellent.

Very moist. I didn't expect to want to keep going back for more. Even my husband liked it (especially when he added a little BBQ sauce as some of the others posted) and he is not a fan of ground turkey.

I made this recipe using 3 lbs of turkey meat, added some diced onion, bell pepper, garlic, hot sauce, and worcestershire sauce... HOLY HECK!!!  The consistency came out great (despite it looking delicate when uncooked), and the taste??? Oh, so good!  Whoever made the suggestions to form the meatloaf in a meatloaf pan and turn it upside down into a larger baking dish was right on the money.  It kept great shape and crisped up evenly.  The soaking the milk in the breadcrumbs was a good call too.  The only criticism I have is that it took about 25 minutes longer than the recipe states to be cooked through.  I also only cooked to 165 degrees (minimum safe recommended temp for poultry) and it was perfect.  My hunny insists that we add this to the rotation.  Leftovers have me excited for once!

This was SUPER easy to make!  Prep time was maybe 10 minutes.  I read the other reviews and I soaked my bread crumbs and I think it really helped. I also added onion and garlic. Yummy! I actually used shredded cheese, but want to try the cubes.  I'll definitely try it again!

This wasn't bad at all.  I will make it again but I think it needs some texture.  Did not like all the milk and breadcrumbs...next time I will use some roughly crushed saltines, less milk, and add some finely chopped onion.  This time I did add some worcestershire and shredded carrot as suggested by others.  Topped with a ketchup, brown sugar and lemon topping - a must. I did put my loaf pan on a cookie sheet lined with foil - thank heaven because it oozed all over. So thanks to those who warned of that. Would of been a horrible nasty mess in my oven otherwise.

Love, Love, Love it! I double my recipe & Glaze it with a 1/2 & half mixture of BBQ sauce & Brown Sugar. My boyfriend requests this often. Huge hit at home.  I serve mine with Homemade Mashed Potatoes & some Corn. Yum!

Update: I wanted to try a new spin on this (it's one of my go to recipes) and decided to make them into meatballs for spaghetti! So far, delicious!!! I just opted to use a mix of Parmesan and Mozzarella and baked them for Approx. 10 minutes and flipped them 1/2 way through. Such a great versatile recipe!

Five stars says it all!  My family loved it... though, I did have to make a few modifications because I do not live close to town and I have to work with what is on hand.   1.  I didn't have italian bread crumbs on hand, so I subsituted regular crumbs and added some italian seasonings... oregano etc. 2.  I did not have colby on hand so used medium cheddar.  I took the advise of others and kept it in little cubes.  I also added dried onions as was suggested earlier as well.  It was awesome!  Definitely will be making it again.

The whole famiy loved this. I actually made two, one without much stuff for the kids and the other half I put red bell peppers, garlic and onion. Really tasty! There was none left and my husband still wanted more! I halved the recipe since there are only four of us but seemed like some more would have been nice and what was left could have been leftoverfs! Next time I'll make more!!

This meatloaf was incredible, just like the name says.   I added additional seasoning as one of the reviewers suggested and it made a real difference in the taste as turkey and be bland.  My husband Loved it.  Thanks for a great meal.

Best meatloaf I have ever had.  I topped mine with bbq sauce.  Also chopped up the leftovers and used them as a topping for nachos!

I soaked the bread crumbs as suggested and added a few dashes of Worcestershire, but other than that -- followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and son said it was good, but not great.  I think it is probably very good for a turkey meatloaf, but I will probably stick to regular meatloaf.  11/17/09 I made this again tonight and soaked the bread crumbs with the milk and egg and added in the carrot.  That suggestion made this so much better that I had to change my rating to reflect that.

This was great!  I used ground turkey breast and I was shocked at how juicy this was!!  I will make again!

I added some co-jack cheese made with 2% milk, worcestshire, fresh garlic, and onion.  Fantastic!!

I made the glaze with ketchup & brown sugar for the top

This meatloaf was awesome!  However, I did make some changes.  I used ground beef instead of the turkey, cheddar instead of colby, added a medium onion and a little worchestershire sauce.  I also let the bread crumbs soak in the milk before adding it and added brown sugar to the ketchup.  Very good!

I had high expectations for this dish, I figured cheese makes everything better, right?  Wrong.  Nobody in my family really liked this, it wasn't gross, but definitely wasn't good enough to make again.  I'm frankly shocked at how many people liked this...I'd try another recipe if I were you.  Sorry!

I only made a half a recipe because I'm only cooking for two. I followed the recommendations of some of the other reviewers and added some carmelized onions that I sauteed with a clove of garlic. I also added Worcestershire. I'm not a fan of pure ketchup toppings, so I used half ketchup, some bar-b-que sauce and equal parts of dijon mustard. It gaves it a little tanginess. I loved this recipe. I still cooked mine in a loaf pan and it worked perfectly. I can see how many peopele's boiled over, but with half a recipe having the chunks of cheese works perfectly. I served with polenta. Delicious!

This recipe is an excellent way to spice up boring ground turkey.  I also added onion, ketchup, & brown sugar to the meat.  I added more brown sugar to the ketchup on top for a sweeter taste.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My girlfriend lovesssss meat and never had meatloaf before.  It's just me and her and we were kinda pissed when there wasnt any more left.  the only thing i suggest is to make lots of this, with a FAMILY it will GO FAST!!!!
Defintely soak the bread crumbs.  I didn't have any store bought bread crumbs, so i broke up some 'almost going stale' hot dog bun, sauteed it butter, oregano, italian seasoning and then soaked it in the milk as others have suggested.
This recipe is delicious.  I need more stars!  
Make this for company, they'll be impressed!

Truly the best meatloaf ever!!!!  I don't eat beef or pork, so this was great.  I've been trying for years to make a turkey meatloaf that worked for me. I had never been satisfied until now. I used the bag of 2% cheddar and colby jack cheese cubes already in my fridge...how perfect was that?!! I used skim milk, and like others had suggested I soaked the breadcrumbs in it. I used plain orgainic whole wheat breadcrumbs and seasoned them myself. I don't like oregano, and it's always in the Italian breadcrumbs. I also used Trader Joes BBQ sauce instead of ketchup because I hate ketchup. I made two loafs, and froze the other one. Thank you for submitting this recipe!

This is our favorite meatloaf recipe.  Shredded cheese is the way to go for easiness, but the cheese cubes look neat when the meatloaf is sliced and somehow make it taste "cheesier" even though the amount of cheese is the same either way.  I cut this recipe in half, and I also make a little indention down the middle of the meatloaf--this holds the ketchup really well and keeps me from wondering if it cooked all the way through in the middle.

This was very good and extremely moist! I used one lb turkey and one lb beef because that's what I had. I also used shredded cheese instead of cubed and mixed in the ketchup instead of having it on top since I was afraid of burning in. Other than adding a few more spices, I left the recipe unchanged and loved the results. It did take about a half hour longer to took than the recipe stated but was well worth the wait.

I made this as written with the exception of reducing the cheese by half.  Something about it was not right- the flavors seemed a little off and it wasn't very good tasting at all.

We love cheese, so I had to try this recipe. I took the advice of others and used shredded cheese, but I'm going to try cubed next time. I added a little garlic powder, onion powder and worcestershire sauce to the turkey mixture for added flavor.

Very good base to start with, but without tweaks it is a touch bland.  I will make it again with some changes suggested by previous reviewers to add just a bit more flavor.

This was great! I added a chopped onion because I like a little crunch. I did NOT bake this in a loaf pan. I shaped it into an oval on a jelly roll pan. It was very tasty! Cooked it for around 45 minutes because it was not as thick. YUM!

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but prepared per this recipe it took almost 2 hours to cook to a safe internal temperature in a standard loaf pan and made a big mess even with a drip pan.  The taste was O.K. but not worth all of the scrubbing I will have to do, not to mention that we did not even end up eating it for dinner tonight because it took twice as long to cook as I had planned.  To salvage it I scraped off the burnt top and used part of it for a casserole.  I'm not sure what will be done with the other half.  I hate to waste so much meat.

I thought this was totally awesome, and I hate meatloaf! I used ground beef and it was just as good. I also used shredded cheese once and it spread the cheese more throughout so it was in every bite. This is a keeper!!

Super easy, cheap and fun! What could be better than that???  My twelve year old daughter made this (with a little help) We read the other reviwers advise and added grated onion and garlic powder. A big hit with the whole family.  We served it with Garlic mashed red potatos (from this site) and some corn. mmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I really liked the taste of this.  Also used shredded cheese.  The only thing that was a wee bit off putting was that it was very "wet".  When you slice into it there is a pool of oil or something in the bottom on the pan.  From the cheese, perhaps?  But it stil tasted yummy!!  I just took it out of the loaf to get it out of the juices.

This was my very first time making meatloaf, and it turned out terrific! I followed other reviewers' advice and used a packet of onion soup mix, and I used Barbecue sauce instead of ketchup. I was never a fan of meatloaf but I really liked this. Hubby and son really enjoyed it too. Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe! The only complaint I would have is that it was a tad "spongy"... but that may be due to a small change I made. I used a small can of chicken broth instead of a cup of milk, and the can was slightly more than one cup so I added more bread crumbs to make sure it wouldn't be too liquidy. I also used 2/3's ground turkey and 1/3 ground chicken... the turkey was already seasoned (Safeway doesn't have very good selection...I also wanted breasts and they only had thighs) so I only added a bit of red pepper flakes, Clubhouse Roasted Garlic & Peppers and a bit of pepper to season. The Clubhouse seasoning is a bit salty and I didn't want to oversalt, so didn't add any. I loved the cubes of cheese throughout. I used old cheddar instead of Colby which was delicious. I think I used slightly more than the 2 lbs, it filled up both of my small loaf pans... which means my boyfriend and I both have leftovers for lunch today! I should have taken a picture, it looked devine as well! Didn't add ketchup on top because my boyfriend hates it. I served with fresh veggies and cooked mushrooms. Yum!

This was good.  We would definitely make it again.  I scaled it to 4 or 5 to fit the 20oz package that ground turkey comes in.  We shredded the cheese and our favorite part was the crusty pieces around the edges.  Oh and I threw in a big jar of carrot baby food with 1/2 a packet of onion soup mix.  The BBQ sauce on the top was a big hit with the kids.  The color was unappealing (esp with the baby food!) but the kids found it fun to squish in a sandwich the next day.

This was the easiest meatloaf I've ever made...and it was great! Needed to make dinner with what I had on hand, and this fit the bill. Loved it. Didn't have cubed cheese so I used shredded...turned out wonderful.

Not a favorite. It was kind of bland and we didn't like the texture. Maybe it needed to rest more.  I had some leftover and made my husband an meatloaf sandwich a few days later and he liked it better as a leftover.

Very good. I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and added italian seasonigs. Also used shredded cheese b/c that's all I had. I also added some garlic powder and dried onion. Very good and healthy too! For an even moister loaf use whipping cream instead of milk, it melts in your mouth!

This recipe turned out great.  I made it with ground beef (simply because it was what I had on hand).  THe cheese in with the meatloaf was wonderful!  I cooked mine with cubed colby cheese, and it turned out fine.  Some of the cheese settled and melted in the bottom of the pan, but it was a nice cheesy bottom to the meatloaf.  Great!

Wonderful!  Kids liked it too.  Sooo easy.  The only thing I did differently is use egg whites and my ground turkey was already seasoned when I purchased it from the grocery store. Will make this again & again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great. I made some embellishments to the recipe. I added some worcestershire sauce, onion powder and season salt. I didn't have quite 2lbs of turkey but it still came out great. My BF who is not a fan of ground turkey was quite impressed. He came back for seconds which is quite a complement.

This was delicious!  We used shredded cheddar instead of cubes of colby, and that seemed to work out well.  We will definitely make this again, it is reminiscient of a cheeseburger, especially with the ketchup on it!

The last time I had meatloaf was 10 years ago. No one in my family likes it so I don't bother with it. I was craving it tonight so I decided to make it. Since I am the only one eating it I only used half the meat. This was really good it hit the spot. Thanks for posting.

Great recipe! Super tasty and healthy. Only difference- I added Worsterchire, garlic salt instead of regular salt, a dash of paprika and shredded cheese. I placed half the meat mixture in the load pan, than added a nice gooey layer of cheese (but be careful when you take it out of the oven, let it cool so the cheese doesn't run when you cut it), then topped it off with the other half and baked. Delish!

Awsome!! Only thing I did different was I cut it in half ( I only had 1.25lbs of Turkey) I added a couple dashes of worchestire, used sharp cheddar that I shredded, and added about a teaspoon of garlic nuggets (dried garlic) , mixed a bit of ketchup in the meat and also put a thin layer on top. I didn't add any salt....plenty in the cheese and the worschestire. I thought that 400 degrees seemed a bit high for a whole hour so I put it just above 375 and only cooked for 50 min. Scrumptious!!

Awesome recipe. Just made a few minor changes. Added one zuchini and one carrot that I shredded. I also only added 8oz of cheese (shredded not cubed) which also set my oven on fire toward the end. With the vegatables I had to add an extra 20 minutes to the cooking time.

This has become the meatloaf of choice in my family.  When making it for a large group, I increase the recipe and cook in a 9x13 pan.  You can even make the night before (without the sauce) and save time just before dinner.

This was very good! I made it at my fathers, who "likes beef not turkey" and he said it was better than his.  I wanted to add onions to the mixture and forgot, so stirred them into the ketchup that I poored on top.  (hey it worked:))
Thanks!

Oh yeah! This was very, very good. I only had a half pound of cheese on hand, but it still was wonderful! It did bubble over in the oven, so place a baking sheet underneath, so you don't have to clean your oven afterwards like I did. Enjoy!

Followed recipe exactly. It was pretty good. Could benefit from some more seasonings. I may add chopped onion and garlic next time. I liked the cheesiness.

I thought this recipe was good for a quick meal. I added onion and garlic powder, sage, and parmesan cheese. I used grated cheese instead of cubed. I omitted the salt. I also added some worchestire sauce to the ketchup. It kept moist and had a good flavor, it will make great leftovers! I will make this again.

I have made this twice now and enjoy it. I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese and it is great. I also use Panko breadcrumbs and add my own seasonings. It could be spiced up a bit, but for an easy dinner that lasts for a few meals, it's great.

This was REALLY good.  I made a couple of changes as the others suggested and it turned out moist and tasted great.  I will definitely make again.  My husband who does not like meatloaf had 2 servings while complimenting how good it was.  He ate the leftovers at 10:00am the next morning.

think ground turkey dry? think again. one word=cheese! Very moist and full of flavor. I used plain breadcrumbs and added my own spices: oregano, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, and basil. for cheese I used cheddar and monterey jack. Hubby loved it, but I have to say that my 2 1/2 did not. I give it 4 stars for that reason, plus the high-fat factor. but we'll definitely make this again. Very good.

This was pretty good. I did not use 1 cup milk, cut back to 1/2 cup. I added chopped onion and fresh garlic and a little more cheese. I also have made it with diced green and red pepper and sometimes with mushrooms. I also did not use ketchup just because my little ones wont eat it/. This was an easy alternative to meatloaf...even my picky eaters loved it. Thanks.

This was pretty good. I added a bit of garlic powder and black pepper. Cubed up Jarlsburg cheese. Split into to loaves and baked side by side in 9x13. One I glazed with a bit of homemade leftover BBQ. Yummy...

Very good!  Used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  Also tried it a couple of ways - w/shredded cheese, the cheesy flavor is more spread throughout; cubes of velveeta make it extra cheesy!

This was very good, but I also made changes based on what other reviewers had mentioned. I added 3/4 of an onion (chopped), 3 garlic cloves (minced), and a few splashes of worcestershire sauce. And I topped it with barbecue sauce mixed with some brown sugar. I also used a bit more cheese than what it calls for, but that was just because I wanted to use up the whole block I had. With the addition of the onion, garlic, and worcestershire, it was extremely good and I will definitely be making this again at some point. I recommend putting something under the pan like others mention though, because it will definitely ooze over the sides. Next time I may try shredded cheese instead just to see if that makes a difference.

This was good, but a bit too cheesy.  I think next time I'll halve amount of cheese and shred it so it is more evenly distributed throughout the loaf.

Very good!  I think next time I will put more cheese in it, and used shredded instead of cubed.  My cheese ran out the sides.  But still tasty!  Also, added a little bit of garlic.  To finish, a little bit of bbq sauce on top (I am not a ketchup fan).  My husband loved it especially for sandwiches the next day!  :)

This was by far the best meatloaf I have ever had!  I did put the pan on foil, which was good, because there was a lot of grease on the foil when done.  Total cook time was an hour and fifteen minutes.  Went exactly by the recipe, with a little bit less cheese.  Spouse is already wanting it again!!!

So great!  My husband and I LOVED it, and I don't usually like meatloaf.  I added an onion, diced.  I also used a bit more cheese than it called for, cubed.  And instead of ketchup alone, I mixed it with BBQ sauce, worstershire, and a little dijon mustard.  YUM!

This turned out tender and yummy!  My pickey sister who hates most things I make had seconds and leftovers for lunch.  I made a glaze with brown sugar and ketchup as someone suggested, and added ketchup to the mix.  I added garlic powder also.  It was terrific!

We really enjoyed this meatloaf.  The only changes I made were to  take the suggestions of the other reviewers and add onion, garlic and worcestershire sauce and then I added some frozen spinach.  I also am not a fan of tomato anything on my meatloaf so I left it off.  It turned out great, thank you for the recipe!

This is one of the best meatloafs I have ever had!  My family absolutely loves it.  You can add as much or as little cheese as you like.  Last night I didn't have bread crumbs so I just broke up some hot dog buns and added italian seasoning.  Worked great!  Delicious!

This really didn't knock my socks off.  It was good though.  I would give it a 3.5  The kids and I ate this earlier since hubby was running late.  When he finally got to eat he exclaimed that it was the best meatloaf he had ever had!!!  He is picky about his meatloaf so this says a lot if he loves it.  When I make this again I will add onions, bell pepper and a little more salt.  I think that is what was missing for me.  This will be a keeper in our house.

My family loved this recipe.  I substituted cheddar cheese because we had it on hand.  My husband loves the leftovers on a sandwich, too.

I agree that it is a great recipe to "hide" veggies in - shredded zucchini, shredded carrots, chopped spinach, etc.

This was the most moist meatloaf I have ever eaten. I cannot eat beef for health reasons, and the turkey was BETTER than beef would have been! Followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used unflavored breadcrumbs instead of Italian ones and I just added my own spices. It was a little plain, but once we added our own spices and ketchup, it was amazing. Will save and recommend!  :)

Love ... LOVE this meatloaf. I actually like the little globs of cheese in it. I usually take the co-jack cubed cheese and cut them in half. Also finally mince some green onion and include that. I use bbq sauce on the top in place of the ketchup.

Very good recipe.  My kids liked it, too.  Next time I make it, I may add onions and peppers.

Although this was good, there was nothing special about it.  I will continue looking for something a little different.

This was pretty good.  Not amazing, but worth making.  The only thing I didn't do was to add the ketchup on top, just because I completely forgot to.  But no big deal.  I wasn't a huge fan of the cubed cheese in the loaf, as I don't feel like it added much to the overall texture or flavor.  With so many other great turkey loaf recipes out there, I most likely will not make this again.  But I'm glad I tried it!

This is terrific!!  I used shredded cheese instead (about 1/2 cup for calorie reasons) and it was fabulous.  My hubby was surprised it was turkey!

Only did 1 thing differently - grated the cheese into the mix instead of cutting into cubes. Also added some sriracha sauce and ketchup to the mix for a small kick, and added ketchup and a small bit of hot sauce to the top after shaping it into a loaf. Tastes pretty good; will definitely make again (maybe next time with cubes).

This was great.  I and added half a chopped onion, garlic powder and 2 teaspoons soy sauce to the turkey mixture. I also used brown sugar with ketchup for the topping and it was perfect.

I made this recipe as-is, & got a great reaction, even from a pretty picky 11 year old!  It is better than many beef meatloaf recipes I've used, & is almost better reheated the next day.  It was really easy to make & we'll definitely have it again!

Not bad!  The only things I did different were I put in an envelope of mushroom onion soup mix and used ripped up bread instead of bread crumbs.  I also added some Italian seasoning since I didn't use the Italian bread crumbs.  Also, a tip: if someone in your family dislikes ground turkey, just rip up 5 pieces of really dark bread instead of bread crumbs, the bread will make the turkey meat loaf look like beef!  Anyway, as for the taste, it was perfectly fine but not anything special.  I probably wouldn't make it again.  Thanks for the recipe, though!

Excellent recipe! I followed some suggestions and used grated cheddar cheese, otherwise followed recipe. My husband and I loved it, and we will definitely be eating it in the future! Thanks!
