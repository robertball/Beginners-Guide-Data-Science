Pretty good--these reminded me of the salmon patties my mother made for me when I was young.  I had a little trouble with the first batch falling apart, but on my second batch I made the patties fatter (they kind of looked like baseballs in my skillet) and they seemed to hold together much better.  I think next time I might add a little more of the onion and perhaps some other spice to make it a bit more zesty, but the hubs and I did enjoy these very much.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll make them again sometime soon!

I was very happy with the way my cakes turned out!  Substituted some ingredients for what I had available- used lime juice in place of lemon, added cilantro, diced sweet pepper and celery, both red and green onion, onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.. I patted them in panko then tossed them in the fridge to firm them up, then fried them in shallow oil  in electric fryer @ 350 for 5 minutes per side.  Wow, what a nice surprise.....soooo good! Drizzled sriracha mayo on top for a little heat....will DEFINITELY make this again!!!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

These were very good.  They didn't fall apart when I cooked them like most fish cakes. We had them with tartar sauce on buns. I'm going to add some Old Bay next time for extra flavor

Tasty! I have a recipe that I usually make, but these were great for a change...I really liked the addition of the parmesan cheese. The only change I made was to coat them in additional breadcrumbs before frying. I would def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

What a lovely dinner! Ok- so I didn't think it would hold together with so little egg - but it did! Instead of using chopped onion I used a packet of Lipton onion soup mix and I added a few dashes of old bay season. To make the patties I put a bit of the bread crumbs in a 1/2 cup metal measuring cup , packed the mix in very tight and added a bit more of the bread crumbs on top before turning the cup over on a tray.  That portioned the mix out PERFECTLY and thought I would share that info! 8 gorgeous, perfectly packed patties that held up without falling apart at all! Amazing. Side notes on flavor- chipotle Tabasco is great on these and my 13 month old loved these to pieces!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made some slight changes by only using 2 cans of tuna and 2 tbsp of oil. I substituted Panko for the bread crumbs. I still got 6 patties out of it. The calorie breakdown for the way I made them was 142 cal/patty. I fried them as instructed for 5 min/side. I served them with a garden salad and used the honey and balsamic dressing from this site. It was delicious and healthy! I might throw in some zucchini next time.

I made these tonight on a whim, because my husband told me a while back he wanted Tuna Patties. I changed up the recipie a bit, by using 4 cans of 5oz Tuna in Oil and adding some old bay seasoning, onion powder (instead of onions), and garlic and herb seasoning. I made them and my husband was disappointed I didn't make more lol. But they turned out fantastic :) I will definitely be making them again, with the additions I made.

The flavor was surprisingly fantastic. I used 4 5-ounce cans, 3 eggs, added chopped celery, and was more generous with the onion. It's a great go-to meal when I'm running low on other staples, because I always have canned tuna on hand. Rice makes a perfect side dish.

Easy Tuna Patties Haiku: "This was a surprise! Such a pleasant one, indeed. Like salmon patty!" Only things that I did differently were to add a shakey-shake of dried dill, and then refrigerate the patties for a few hrs. so that they'd hold together better when frying. The best part about these were the leftover patties that I made into a patty melt w/ swiss cheese, a hunk of tomato and grainy bread.

Omg this is delicious! No it's not fancy, but it sure is yummy! I took others advice and added more onion (medium diced), a dollop of mayo to the egg mixture.  Plus I bought all white tuna $1.28 a can. So easy and really good.  My husband and kids loved it. I loved it too :) Great Lenten meal. Thanks for sharing.

We made this according to directions as we always do and make changes the second round.  Giving this a four star because, for us, it needed more flavor, a little bit of crunchy to it and it tended to fall apart.

The only thing we changed is how we cooked it. Since we are looking to be a little more heathlier, be baked instead of fried.  We baked it at 400 for about 30. At this temp and time, it warmed up the middle and crisped the outside a little. 

We will be adding carrots, celery, maybe onion and some more seasoning to it next go around.

These were easy enough but I thought the texture was a bit lacking. Next time I'll add celery or jicama for more crunch.

I am not a fan of canned tuna and was not expecting to care for these but I was really surprised at how good these were! I only used two cans of tuna and subbed grated asaigo cheese in place of parmesan and added a little salt.  I served these with some tartar sauce. Really tasty!

Added a tablespoon of mayo, about a teaspoon of garlic and had to substitute a teaspoon of vinegar instead of two teaspoons of lemon juice because I was out. My cans of tuna were also only 4 ounces when drained, and specifically I used panko bread crumbs. I decided to make four equal size, basically burger patty sized patties as well because I wanted them to fit on my burger buns. I plan to top them with tartar sauce, pickles and tomato. They came out very delicious, plan on making them as a healthier "burger" option! Love it!

Easy recipe and deserves 5 stars because it is restaurant quality and the recipe brings out the best flavors of the tuna even if you do not use the top brands of tuna.  They taste like freshly cut tuna.  I'm good to try the recipe with salmon and crab too!

Every time I used to make my own tuna patty concoction my kitchen ended up in a disaster. They always fell apart and never cooked right. This recipe is simple, forgiving and easily customizable. My exceptionally picky kids devoured them too!

I love this recipe! I grew up (well almost grew up) in Florida. lol I miss having the opportunity to have fresh fish when I wanted something special. This brings back some childhood memories! I can almost smell the sea salt in the air!! lol I'm Gluten Intolerant so I added GF Panko instead, and used Old Bay Seasoning, and diced celery! Perfectly cooked with a very crunchy overall texture! I made a special sauce with Sriracha, Vegenaise and Lemon juice!! So tasty! Served it with some Jasmine rice!  Everyone Loved it!!

This is a winner!  Only changes are that I added about 2 T diced celery and since I didn't have bread crumbs I used some small dry stuffing cubes.  Turned out beautifully, and even my preschooler gobbled them up!  Healthy and cheap, will become part of our regular menu :)

This was very good. I added celery and Old Bay as suggested by other reviews. We placed them on sandwich thins and topped with lettuce and tomatoe. I'll make them again for sure! I bet the would even be good with salmon.

I absolutely love tuna patties. They are easy to make and always so tasty. I enjoy adding a small dash of Ol Bay seasoning to my patties to give them a little exta zip. Always very tasty! :)

I made a 12 ounce can of tuna and scaled back on everything except the eggs.  These were great!  I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs so I used panko bread crumbs and Italian seasoning.  Picky kiddos loved them!!!!!

This turned out very well. I used a cheddar cheese sauce from Campbell's soup as a sauce. I had heated the soup in a pot beforehand and then poured it over when the patties were finished cooking. I was really happy with the finished product.

At the suggestion of other reviews I added about a TBPS of Old Bay seasoning, 1/4 tsp of dill and an extra TBPS of diced red onion. To help prevent the patties from falling apart I made them a lil thicker , getting five patties rather than eight out of the recipe. I sautéed some mushrooms on the side and we ate it on a bun with spicey brown mustard. Although I don’t normally care for tuna I really enjoyed it and will definitely make again!

These worked perfectly and didn't fall apart!  I added curry powder and a little bit of diJon mustard but that's all I did apart from the written recipe!  Even my 5 year old loved them!!! And so quick to make for our lunch!

Let me start by saying fish isn't my thing. But I'm trying to eat healthier...so...made these as recipe described...fried a sample and found it bland. Texture was good for a fish cake...just not much flavor... I added 1 x tsp each of Lemon grass paste, minced garlic, minced ginger, 1/2tsp of Chinese 5 spice and finally 1 tbsp of soy. That worked for the kids...then added 1/4 cup of red chilli flakes for adults...came out really nice....sort of a Thai chilli fish cake

So good!  It never occurred to me to cook tuna fish!  This is delicious.  It's an easy, quick weeknight dinner.  I had everything in my pantry!  I did make a change swapping out soy sauce for the lemon juice. I've made this many times.

I added more breadcrumbs than what it called for, and the parties held up nicely. I also added a squirt of Siracha for some heat. I also added paprika for some flavor and used three cheese Italian blend cheese. Delicious and easy!

I really liked these tuna patties. I did add three tablespoons of mayo to the mixture and that helped it all stick together better and added a little more flavor!

My kids who like tuna loved this.  I did make a few modifications to use what I had on hand: crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs, no parmesan, and added 1/2 tsp. minced garlic.

I thought these were really great. I used gourmet canned tuna and it still ended up being a very cheap dinner. I kind of just threw them together too, no detailed measuring was used. I added an extra egg to make them stickier for frying, subbed Gorgonzola for Parmesan and used unseasoned bread crumbs so that I had control over the flavor and saltiness. Served with polish cucumber salad (Mizeria) and dipped them in the salad's dressing (Greek yogurt, salt, dill, lemon juice) because they were a little dry. The dressing made them excellent though. Even my man friend, who is a picky water enjoyed this classy dinner!

My two year old ate them!  We are gluten free and I'm always looking for easy recipes that I can substitute gluten free ingredients in.  This turned out pretty good! I substituted gluten free bread crumbs, a table spoon of italian seasoning, and I fried them in coconut oil.  I served it with dill sauce and she ate them up!  next time I might try adding some Old Bay seasoning.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I'm not a huge fan of canned tuna, but my family and I are trying more vegetarian options and tuna seemed inevitable.  Surprisingly, everyone really enjoyed these patties!  I ate mine more like a crab cake; with fresh lemon and cocktail sauce.  Where as my husband and kids ate them like sliders; on fresh rolls with lettuce, tomato, onion, and mayo.  None the less, this is a delicious and healthful meat-free meal option.  We will make this again for sure!

Patties fell apart and were bland in flavor.  I even tried adding another egg and some mayo to try to keep them together.  I will not make again.

I changed out some ingredients because it was all I had on hand.  Mozzarella, green onions, and cornflakes.  I added Italian Seasoning, Salt and Garlic Salt.  I baked them in the oven for 30 minutes at 400 (this was following reading another tip from someone saying it holds up better in the oven, and they recommended 375 for 30-40 minutes, but my oven runs cooler).  I don't think they were fantastic or exceptional in any way, but they were pretty easy and quick to make.  They tasted okay, and I do plan to make them again, though pull them out of the oven a little bit sooner.  The outside was nice and crunchy, but it may have been a tad overdone.  

On a side note, I only got 5 and a half 1 inch patties, and I used the required 3 cans of tuna.  So not sure how they came up with 8 patties.

I used home-canned tuna and followed the recipe- except I used chives instead of onion, and I used avocado oil to fry the patties in. AMAZING!! Will keep this recipe in the favorites rotation!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was so easy!!! The only thing I did differently was add some lemon pepper.  I made 8 and my husband and I ate 8! SO DELICIOUS.  I did have trouble getting them to stay together. I made the patties and chilled them. Next time I will make the batter and chill it and make the patties as I put them in the pan. There will be a next time. It was so good.

I made smaller portions (1/3 of asked) and adjusted the measurements appropriately, but even so they didn't turn out to be patty-consistent. I had to add more liquid ingredients to make the pasty texture. Even after that, the taste was not good. Would not make this again.

Delicious! I recommend making a sauce with mayo, dill, and lemon or lime juice to put on top. Also, when you're cooking these patties, try to avoid flipping the patties multiple times -- the more you flip them, the more prone they are to crumbling. Flip it only once you're pretty sure they're done on each side!

I doubled this recipe to take to a church function.  I was a little leary about "fish" but they were very well received.  I made a cucumber -dill sauce with mayo and sour cream and it was raved about.  The next time I make it I will alter the bread crumbs a little as they made the patties somewhat dense.

Even the non-fish lover at our house really liked it and ate the leftovers cold the next day for lunch! I added chopped celery and a little sriracha then formed and refrigerated the patties for a couple hours before cooking. We plan to use this often. Thanks Phyllis!

This recipe was flavorful and juicy. The only thing I changed was choosing to use canola oil spray instead of vegetable oil to save on calories and it still came out delicious.

The recipe is good, I added shredded carrots, celery and about 1/4 cup mayo, probably used more like a 1/2 cup grated cheese. Also the seasoning needs to be amped up from the original recipe, make sure you taste I added garlic powder and a little Worcestershire sauce. Made 6 patties. Hubby liked.

I had to make a few changes - mine needed an extra egg since my eggs were small, made six larger, thinner patties rather than 8 small ones, cooked for 3 min/side instead of 5, etc. But, easy and delicious nonetheless. I served mine with a garlic mayo for dipping and it was pretty tasty.

These were tasty, and very easy and fast to make.  We did drain the tuna, however, the patties were still pretty wet and it could use a little extra bread crumbs.  Fried up nicely, though, and came out well.

wow very good! I followed the recipe except I used asiago instead of parmesan (only cheese I had) and substituted with italian panko bread crumbs. Used 2 cans (7 oz) white albacore tuna instead of 3. It ended up making 6 patties. Will make again! Thank you.

Delicious and easy to make. Had everything in the house already but I added chopped tomatoes. Not too much so the patties would be soaked and keep the crispy sides after frying!!! Great for brunch to dinner!

I made these on Sunday night and loved them. I was actually impressed that I made something so tasty. Recipe edite: I only used two (2) 6.4-ounce pouches of tuna but kept everything else the same. I also added some extra breadcrumbs to the outside of the patties for crunch. Definitely a winner, I'll be making these again. THANKS!

I scaled this to one serving and it was a decent lunch. I used fresh breadcrumbs and added a pinch of Italian seasoning. It stayed together well and cooked up nicely. I tried half of my patty with hot sauce and the other with tarter sauce- liked the hot sauce best. I've never had any kind of tuna patty/burger/cake before, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I decided on a whim to make this instead of my usual tuna salad. I'd like to try a few other recipes and see if any of them "wow" me more. I would try this one again though; maybe I just need to get used to tuna made this way.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I had no issues with the patties falling apart; I did make 4 large patties though, about burger size and thickness. The mix felt a little wet but they cooked right up. It didn't specify what kind of breadcrumb but I did use fresh wheat breadcrumbs with dried Italian herbs and garlic salt added, that worked perfectly. Served with sauteed bell peppers this was a fast cheap and healthy lunch, thanks so much for sharing.

These were so delicious, I couldn't stop eating them. I added a 3rd egg and some dried basil and I used solid albacore tuna. Will definitely make them again.

Added more onion and celery and did put in frig so burgers kept form better.  I prefer them on a bun with some condiments.  Yum!

Made exactly per the recipe and they were definitely good!  They held together well and the flavors melded together well.  We did find these a little dry and felt they could use a bit more salt/seasoning.  Next time we will add a bit of mayo as well as some old bay seasoning.  A great base recipe and will definitely make again!

Amazing. Only thing I added is a hint of creole seasoning, some shredded fresh basil, and avocado oil in place of vegetable oil. Super easy to make

I have made these twice, the first time with 2 cans of tuna and the rest exactly as instructed (minus lemon juice I didn't have). My kids are 4 and almost 2, they ate them up like they were cookies. My husband also loved them, they're super tasty. 
Second time I used 4 eggs and 3 cans of tuna, the mixture was much more paste-like, and still came out extra delicious. My family loves eating these from the same plate and dipping them in either mayonnaise and mustard mixed, or ketchup and mustard mixed.
Really good, simple, quick and affordable filler-upper. I'll definitely make this a staple for our family.

Absolutely phenomenal! I made these for the first time, my daughter and I loved them ! Our cat jumped on the table and was eating them off our plates ! I gave him his own plate, and took the onions out !The only thing I changed was that I cut up a piece of celery real fine and added that . Awesome !

We made these tuna patties exactly as the recipe states (we did only get 7 patties instead of 8).  We melted cheese over the top and put them in warmed up hamburger buns.  They were delicious, and I say this as someone who's pretty ho-hum about tuna in general.  I loved the crispiness and they were a great alternative to a burger.  We served them with baked french fries which worked out perfect.  Will definitely make again.

These were amazing and I took suggestions from other cooks. I added an extra egg as I felt they would fall apart if I didn’t. I also added salt and pepper to the mix and I added crushed tarragon and finely chopped celery. Before frying I dipped each tuna cake in plain Panko breadcrumbs and that made them nice and crispy. My husband gave them a big thumbs up!

I made these with crab meat instead of tuna, and let me tell you they turned out amazing.  I have eaten a lot of crab cakes in my day and these rank up there on the top of my list. I will be making them again - many times!!

Excellent. A change-up from the usual tuna sandwich.
A hamburger press makes neat patties.

Loved this recipe!  It was an easy and fast meal to get on the table on a busy weeknight and my family loved these Tuna Patties.  They held together like a champ even though they were nice and moist on the inside.  Wouldn't change a thing with this recipe.  Clean up was a snap, too, since I lined a sheet-pan with foil. I'd call this a total dinner-winner!

I had to substitute almond flower for the bread crumbs because I didn't have any on hand.  It worked just fine.  I did add a diced up jalapeno.
They did require careful handling so they would not break when transfering from the pan.
Delicious.

I added a tablespoon of Penzy jerk seasoning, a pinch of dill weed and used granulated onion instead of chopped. Then I rolled each patty in (dry) instant mashed potatoes. I fried them in garlic infused olive oil.  Served with cocktail sauce. Easy and a tasty way to use canned tuna.

It's an easy recipe, but it needed a bit more spice. I will add some cayenne or red pepper to it next time.

Pretty tasty! And easy, which is s bonus. I’d just make sure to add plenty of onion and pepper next time - felt like I could’ve amped it up

They were easy and great tasting.  Reminded me a little of a crab cake.  I made these on the spur of the moment.  I didn't have the bread crumbs so I substituted Ritz cracker crumbs.  I'll buy the bread crumbs for the next time.  However the cracker crumbs were very good.

So yummy! I I used plain crumbs, added onion salt, onion flakes, italian seasoning, and made it with 2 cans of Albacore tuna instead of 3. For a fun spin, I ground up a large garlic clove and a half cup of roasted peanuts with fresh shredded Parmesan cheese. Then I reduced the breadcrumb proportionally for the nut mixture. After mixing, I felt it was too dry so I added a 1/4 c of mayonnaise and the second egg. Using a large tablespoon, I made coaster sized patties. Cook for a couple minutes on one side then flip. At this point, most of them would stay stuck together. These would be great with tartar sauce or Japanese Mayo.

Turned out really good, did add some hot sauce and crushed garlic to the mixture but otherwise made exactly as written. Patties held together really well during cooking as well. Might go with a little less bread crumbs next time though.

These are really good. For the friend I make these for doesn’t care for too much bread, so I cut that in half. I use a 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper (or 1 whole teaspoon since I usually double the recipe)  Thank you for this recipe....a winner in my books.

When I make these for my husband and I , I always use  2 cans of the flavored garlic tuna, 1 egg and instead of bread crumbs I recently tried them with corn flake crumbs since I had run out of bread crumbs. They were outstanding! To fry them I just use a small amount of olive oil mixed with a very small amount of butter and it gets them plenty crisp. For dipping I use Red Hot brand sweet chili sauce and it’s the BEST.

My family loved this! I added a little more onion, creole seasoning, a splash more lemon, and a few dashes of hot sauce! I also used shredded Colby jack cheese instead of Parmesan because that’s what I had on hand. I also used albacore tuna. Delicious!

These are very tasty. I couldn't keep them on the plate. Kiddos praised me for finding this recipe. Made the following week and changed out the tuna for salmon and it worked just fine. I also coated the outside of the patties with parmesan before frying them up.

Easy, quick  summer meal thats's something different from the usual tuna salad.  i served these as sliders on Hawaiian rolls with a side green salad. My family ate them up quickly behind my back after initially turning their noses up.  I went looking for the left overs for lunch the next day, but they had mysteriously disappeared !

I didn't change the recipe at all, just make sue the pan is hot before frying and make the patties like balls when you put them in the pan initially.  As they get that crust on one side , flip them and then start pressing them flat gently so they don't fall apart in the skillet.

This was great. Will make it again. Added dried tarragon to mine. Also made the mayo/sriracha sauce another reviewer mentioned. That was excellent too.

Great recipe! I used soy sauce instead of the lemon juice and served it over rice with broccoli. It's become one of my meal-prep recipes.

I have made a lot of crab cakes in my life but never tuna cakes. I used this as a starter. Substituted old bay for the salt. added some celery and parsley flakes.  They turned out very good. Thanks for sharing!

Flavor was great. It was a little dry. That could be because I had to use gluten free bread crumbs. Next time I’ll add another wet ingredient.

I used a 12 oz. can of solid white albacore tuna and I added some dill, salt and pepper, and I used onion powder rather than fresh onion.  I made 4 large patties and they fried up beautifully, with a nice crisp brown crust.  We enjoyed them very much and I will make them again.  I was especially pleased that my husband liked them because he usually says he doesn't like hot tuna.

Fantastic recipe!  The tuna I use is packed in olive oil, so I use only one egg.  Apart from that, I make it exactly as is in my Airfryer.  It turns out crispy on the outside, moist on the inside without using any oil to fry it in, or flipping it halfway.

it was a great recipe--i wish my patties were cooked more internally but if i left them longer- i think i would have burnt the outside of them. All in all though when i took them out the fryer and they cooled, they tasted nice. Would def try the recipe again!

This was quite tasty.  My hubs and I both said so. I forgot to add the parmesan to the mix so I put it on the slider rolls I was using and toasted the buns, it was still very good.  I liked the lemon it boosted the flavor.  I also added a dash of lime/chili powder to it, but it would have been fine without it too.  Yes, I will make again.

not bad, a great launching point to personalize this recipe. I thought the mix was a bit dry so, I added Dijon and, little mayo to bind. old bay blackening seasoning, Tabasco sauce, a little lemon pepper and a pinch or coarse sea salt. next time, Ill add some finally chopped celery and green onions.

Made these today.  My hubby loved them!
Of course, I started the recipe as posted but being the flavorful latina that I am, I had to tweek it using  my goya adobo seasoning, along with Old Bay (only a pinch) , Sweet Paprika and added finely chopped green peppers.  OMG!!!  That's why I couldn't rate it as posted. Did like it though.

I followed the directions almost exact.  I added two 12 oz cans of tuna, 1 teaspoon of capers, 1/2 of a Serrano with seeds (minced), and a handful of chopped celery leaves. Next time I think I’ll add some dill.  And yes, there will be a next time!

I made the patties using the exact same ingredients as listed for the recipe, except that I did season the patty lightly with cayenne pepper on one side.  

The only problem that I had with the recipe was that the patties are a bit on the dry side.  I ate mine as is with no added sauces or anything.  Hubby had his with a slice of processed swiss cheese on each patty.  
We both agreed that this was a 5 star recipe--especially with the cheese on top. I also submitted a photo when I clicked the "I Made It!" button.  Think I might try a bit of malt vinegar on one of the patties I have left...

They were good, but I need a little more moisture. Maybe another egg, and might add a little dill. Will definitely make again though.

My family loved this recipe. From other notes I added some Old Bay - a little under 1 tsp - and it really adds to the flavor.  Since I like my salmon/tuna patties thin, I added an extra egg and coated the patties in a little extra bread crumbs before frying.  I got them thin and big enough so they would fit a hamburger bun. Tasty.

FINE  with a little effort ,and all the tips ,these come together
well. We found them dry though and I can’t imagine adding
a bun to these which is what I hoped my left-over would be 
used for. I wish I had added mayo for a bit of moisture.
I like this idea for using tuna, but I do not think I will go through the work again.

This is a really good recipe. I made them on a whim so I didn’t have all the same ingredients. I used onion powder instead of onion, Panko breadcrumbs, I added a few teaspoons of flour to help it stick together because I was using egg whites. I also added extra lemon juice because I thought the flower with mute the acidity. I’m not a cook at these turned out great

Love these! I made a few changes and wow! Extra lemon juice,  fennel seeds ( crushed about 1 tsp) , cajun seasoning, 1 tsp mayo and i used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I made large baseball size patties, then roll again in ritz crackers for better crunch. I placed in freezer for 25 minutes before pan frying in peanut oil. I served over spinach salad, with avacodo and balsamic vinegar as a light dressing.  AMAZING!!!!!!!!

Was looking for an easy recipe that involved tuna. Looks like I found another weeknight staple! My secret is topping them with siracha mayo sauce to add spicy goodness.

I love this recipe! The more I make it the more I try new spices. I always add dry dill and super fine diced celery carrot onion green pepper garlic powder paprika most of the basics work great for added flavor. When I stray too far it's nice to come back to the original, always delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy goodness! Added stalk of celery doubled diced onion, two cloves of garlic minced, 1/4 of a very large carrot diced, about  3 tablespoons cilantro fresh cut small, salt, paprika.  Formed patties in 1/2 cup measure lined with amble bread crumbs and topped with more bread crumbs insuring consistent size and shape. Place the patties on a plate and refrigerate at least an hour prior to cooking or flash freeze for 5 minutes.  Using the measuring device and insuring your patties are good and cold going into the EVOO guarantees the patty will NOT fall apart. Lastly do NOT touch them while they are in the pan, I cooked mine over medium heat for 4 minutes on the first side and 3 minutes on the back side.  Restaurant quality! 5 stars with the changes! Bon Appetit!

I usually make tuna salad, or salmon patties...finally occurred to me to look up a recipe for this! My husband is the tuna fan, and I made this for dinner with my parents...it was a hit. It was a little hard to stick the patties together, so I made them smaller than I intended to, but no one minded that.  I’ll make this again.

I made this as written and made 3 large patties.  They held together well.  I also melted a slice of Swiss  cheese on them and made sandwiches. Add condiments to your liking.  My family liked them a lot.

This are excellent and keep well in the fridge for workweek lunches.  I omitted the oil (I'm watching my weight) and I forgot about the parmesan, but the patties didn't need it. 

After rolling the patties into balls, let them rest in the fridge (or freezer) for a few minutes.  This lets the breadcrumbs absorb the liquid so the patties stay moist.  Furthermore, the cold solidifies the fat so that the patties don't fall apart in the pan.  

I served with cabbage wilted in beef bouillon and horseradish and then chilled.

I am so impressed by the texture of these patties. I always end up with mushy, fall-apart tuna patties. These seemed to be going that direction as well, but let them cook for the full time and they will hang together for you! They were meaty and delicious, and also held up really well as leftovers reheated in the microwave- something that is rare for tuna patties, too. **I left out the onion and replaced it with onion powder, which may contribute to the textural result somewhat.**

Very simple and fast to make.  Hubs, kids, and I all enjoyed it.  I did add chopped celery to add a bit more texture as well as rolling the patties in panko before cooking.  Served it with a cabbage salad for a nice, light meal.

These were pretty good and were easy to prepare. I used 3 cans of albacore tuna. Maybe my tuna was extra flaky because I had to add another egg and an additional handful of breadcrumbs in order for the patty to stay together. I forgot to add black pepper, added another 1/2 tsp. of lemon (because I love lemon); and, I added about 1 tsp. of dill weed.

Very good and guilt-free!  I would advise forking the tuna apart first - I used albacore in water and really had hard time mixing once I added the 'paste'.  There is much room for creativity in this recipe - I added red pepper and will spice it up with maybe cayenne next time.

This is a wonderful, basic recipe! I followed the recipe except I substituted scallions for the onion, which added some nice visual interest to the finished product. I thought it seemed too dry to hold together, so I added about a tablespoon more of lemon juice and that did the trick. They fried up beautifully. I did need to be extra careful about flipping them, but that is the nature of this type of patty. I ate them dipped in mustard, but they would also have been great on a bun with lettuce, tomato, etc.

We really liked these, I think the Parmesan made the difference.  I also added pinko to the breadcrumbs. I topped mine with a slice of provolone cheese, yummy.

Made these and they were great. Substituted Italian bread crumbs with regular, but used italian dry salad seasoning in the mixture. I'm not a big tuna fish eater, but these are good. I also made a mayo, ketchup, hot sauce dip to dip them in and they were awsome.

This was a great recipe! I grew up on moms tuna cakes ( poor family's crab cakes). I did add a little more bread crumbs  only because I had extra large eggs! So about 3/4 cup. Thanks! It was a hit

Easy, tasty, everyone loved it - even the picky eaters of the house. Success! 

I used 2 12 oz cans of tuna, four eggs, 1/4 onion (diced) , 20 tbsp of bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and about 6 tbsp of grated parmesan. So i roughly double the recipe. I had no lemon juice, though - so we did without.

Getting ready to make these for the second time because they are SO good! My husband loves them. Only change I made was after I flipped them in the pan, I added a little sharp cheddar cheese on the top.

These are delicious!!!  I was not expecting them to bo so good.  It was a Thursday night and I was packing my lunch for Friday, being lent I reached for tuna, found this recipe and Ill say it again, they are delicious!!!   My husband who doesnt really even care for tuna really liked them too! I am on weight watchers so the only thing I changed was 4T of cheese and 4T of  bread crumbs for less points.

This was great! I will definitely make it again. I didn't have 5oz cans of tuna but I had a 12oz can and a 2.6oz packet of lemon pepper flavored tuna. I figured since the recipe calls for lemon and pepper anyway it wouldn't be a big deal. I also wanted them to be a bit bigger so I made 5 patties instead of 8 and cooked them a lil bit longer. They didn't fall apart and they turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great. I hate it when people do this but I did make some modifications based on reviews and what I already had at home. I used scallions and 1/2 a red onion, as well as a scoop of mayo and some dashes of hot sauce on the paste..Besides that I follow the recipe...I was great. I had a side of white rice, avocado and sweet plantains. Will definitely make again!! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great way to eat canned tuna. It is fairly healthy, and a delicious savory breakfast option. Serve with a spicy tartar.

I had a can of tuna but wanted something more substantial than mayo tuna salad. Stumbled along this recipe and it was great! I didn't have onions but had most of the other ingredients. Only adjustments I made was no onion, and then during the seasoning step in addition to the pepper I added Tony Chichera's seasoning, roasted red pepper flakes, about a teaspoon of relish. I also 1/3 the recipe since I only had 1 can of tuna and was making it for myself, except I used 1 egg so it was slightly more egg proportions than the recipe called for. Made 2 decent sized parties. Used olive oil to fry and they were great!

I've made this a few times now. The only tweaks I've made were to reduce the bread crumbs from 3/4 cups to 1/2 cup, and increase the Parmesan cheese from 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup. Minor changes but a nice improvement in consistency of the batter.

Very simple and pretty good. I made the patties pretty thick to begin with and had no issues with them falling apart. Will go heavier on the onions, and maybe celery as some people suggested for a little more crunch. Will make again.

Oh I can't believe how good these are! I read the reviews beforehand & the only change I made was to add a bit of mayonnaise  to help bind it together, my tuna came in 7 oz cans so I chose to add mayo rather than an extra egg. The Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs add a lot of flavor so then I just seasoned to taste. I took one reviewer's suggestion and baked at 400 degrees for about 30-33 minutes, flipping half-way through. I also used the suggestion to form the patties using a half-cup size measuring cup, made it very easy. Awesome! Thanks for this recipe and all the great tips!

I used unseasoned bread crumbs and added garlic salt, celery seed and pepper to the mixture.  Good flavor, didn't stick together as much as I would have liked, but they were tasty.

have made these many times.  good on a bun, or with tartar sauce.  have also made them with canned salmon. i usually leave out the onion and put in some italian seasoning.  much quicker to make than you might think and yummy!

I had no cheese in the house so I used a bit of ceasar dressing for zip and added the onion, celery and a bit of dry stove-top stuffing to give them some crunch. As recommended by other reviews, I rolled them lightly in Italian breadcrumbs before the frying. I served them with some garlic alioli and they were spectacular - also good the next day cold for lunch on top of a salad. Thanks for the recipe for a change of pace from cold tuna salad!

Could use more moisture to keep the cakes together better. Also more spices. My husband liked them but thought a cheese or white sauce would make it even tastier.

Very very good! Held together great and was golden brown ...... I did wash the tuna real good then squeezed out excess water and I used gluten free chicken coating mix (HolGrain) in place of bread crumbs and we loved it......thanks for the great recipe :)

This was a really good simple dinner idea. Two eggs looked as if the patties were going to fall apart as I fried them so I added a third egg and that did the trick. They held together nicely. I also added fresh parsley from my garden into it. I would definitely make these again. They are very similar to salmon patties, but cheaper to make.

Delicious! I made these for lunch and served them on a light salad and my family loved them  I added Adobo instead of the garlic powder.  I also chilled them a bit before frying them up, as someone else recommended which helps keeps them together.  As a garnish sauce I made sriracha mayo.

Oh these were so freaking amazing although I made minor changes. I was out of onion so I cut up celery and added onion powder. No difference in my opinion. I used olive oil and coconut oil to cook it, and then I only made half so I cut everything in half but kept the same amount of cheese and oil and they came out perfect and didn't fall apart at all! And I ate it on a toasted (I toasted it closed so the inside was soft) English muffin with mayo and they were amazing!!

Loved the recipe!  Did make some changes to suit our tastes though.  Tried only one can of Bumble Bee Albacore Solid White Tuna  to test out the recipe.  So here's what I added:  half of a onion diced, 1/4 c of Almond Flour, some Old Bay Seasoning, garlic power, dash of cayenne, dill, 1 egg and about 2 TBS of mayo.  Used Olive Oil when frying them.  They turned out delicious! Nice and Crispy and held its shape well.

I used plain panko bread crumbs and added some Mrs.Dash instead of Italian bread crumbs. I thought these were good and fried up a little crunchy which is how I prefer them. Will definitely make them again.

Followed recipe as written.. Except for little garlic powder and crazy janes salt..but that goes in everything for me. :) Did not fall apart.  No wow flavor or anything .. Lol- just need a little love..(a little dry- so need condiment/ cheese/ tomato) But they were good. I think would be amazing on a tuna melt or tuna BLT. When jersey tomatoes come out will definitely be making again!

My family and I loved these. They didn't even need sauce! I cooked the onions first, because my kids don't like crunchy, raw onions. It adds 10 minutes, but it's still a fast and easy recipe.

Made this for the first time and it's phenomenal! I added celery and lightly sautéd them first, although probably not necessary. I used coconut oil rather than vegetable oil and made a sauce to dip or add onto the cake... one part mayo one part sour cream and 2 tbsp of fresh dill. Delicious!!!

The patties came together fine, but this recipe is under seasoned and bland. These burgers need a lot of help, flavor-wise. Lots of room for improvement.

This was such a disappointment for me. This was just really dry and tasteless and needed a sauce, cheese, or something to keep it from being a dry patty.  I won't be cooking this again.

Okay. I'm not a fish fan but because of the cheese, this was excellent. A few chances though - didn't put onion because the kids are fussy, and baked 12 minutes (6 minutes each side).

I made these just as the recipe called for and they were delicious! Reminded me of my moms. Next time I'll try adding some diced celery and carrots for a crunch on the inside and dip in flour on the outside before frying for extra crispness on the outside.

Very Tasty! I used 2 cans of tuna instead of 3 and since we are on a gluten free diet used a cup of Chex Corn Cereal ground up in the magic bullet instead of bread crumbs.  Didn't have Parmesan Cheese so used 1/4 cup of shredded mexican blend cheese...also added in some chopped spinach.   The 2 eggs and cheese in the recipe helped the patties stay in one piece.  Will definitely make this one again! My boyfriend who is a "picky eater" was afraid to try them but after he did wanted more.

This is the second time I've made this recipe and it always turns out great!  The second time I made them I had to "make do" with an empty pantry!  Only two cans of tuna, and substituted French's Crispy Fried Onions for breadcrumbs (and chopped onions) - added some Old Bay along with the spices listed and BAM!  It was actually very good - can't go wrong with a good basic recipe!

Question: is it 3 cans of 6 ounces meaning 18 ounces of tuna or 6 ounces total? Thanks!

Really tasty recipe
I didn't have any issues with the patties falling apart, I rolled them tightly into balls (as if I were making snowballs) then gently patted them into patties making sure the edges were "squished" into the patty.
Definitely would make again

I've been a fan of tuna and salmon croquettes for a while.  Needed a base recipe last night and this was perfect.  I did sub crushed Ritz crackers for bread crumbs because it was all I had available, but it worked just fine.  The family devoured them and were genuinely disappointed there were no leftovers.  I will make these again.

I used some mustard instead of lemon juice, but add a little bit of sugar to control the bitterness.  I find it helps to put in the fridge for a few hours -- the tuna absorbs the flavor  and the patties hold together better.   You might also try using your favorite stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs.

I did a paleo/gluten free version of this recipe! instead of Italian bread crumbs and vegetable oil. I used almond meal, Italian seasoning and olive oil! Turned out great! I will definitely make this again!

I made it as directed, and the consistency was perfect, but for some reason mine turned out super fishy after cooking.  My family said they were decent, but we'll stick to salmon patties.

The only change I made is to put the bread crumbs on the outside, also, and add some paprika.  Very good, will make again.

These Tuna Patties were very good, but I'm basing my review on the changes which I made.  I used whole wheat Panko bread crumbs - which I seasoned with Italian seasoning.  I also added some chopped (fresh) flat leaf Italian parsley into the bread crumb mixture.  I used Old Bay seasoning instead of salt.  Since I haven't seen 6 oz. cans of tuna at the supermarket in quite some time (only 5 oz. cans before draining it) so I used 4 cans of 5 oz. tuna (drained & squeezed dry).  The final result was very delicious.

I had a craving and I don't even know why!!! This recipe was easy and quick.  Because it was on a whim, I did not have all the ingredients.    I used jalapeno, egg whites and shredded mexi cheese.  They came out delicious.

Theses where so easy and good! I only had Italian croutons on hand so instead of breadcrumbs I smashed croutons into the batter maybe that even made them taste better :)

I made these this afternoon for tonight's dinner.  I did make a few changes.  Because my tuna was 7 oz. cans I added another egg, 1 T. Mayo, some Old Bay Seasoning & used Panko Italian bread crumbs.  I also sprinkled Panko in a 2/3 measuring cup & packed the mixture in & molded it out as one reviewer suggested.  That worked great.  Put on a dish and covered & refrigerated till I was ready to fry.  They were delicious.  They stayed together nicely.
I also made some Tarter sauce with Mayo,  Relish,  teaspoon of Horseradish & a good dash of hot sauce.  Mixed it well & put in fridge to chill real good.  My fussy husband really loved them.
I got 5 out the recipe because of the larger size.  
Why not make small ones form Appetizers?  
This is a keeper... Thank you again Allrecipe.com!!!

The key here is flaking or a quick process in food processor to make sure tuna has no chunks.  Also a dollop of Mayo or olive oil helps the patties bind well.  Otherwise - a bit more hot sauce..some garlic powder,  a dash of worstcheshire, and it is pretty good.

I have made this recipe several times. I just love it! I finely mince the onion.  I also like to add celery and because we are a hot sauce family, it goes in too, several dashes. I will come back to this often.

I made this tonight and loved it. I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, but I added a chopped jalapeno, more onion, garlic, and the seasoning I buy from my local meat market. I chilled the patties for about 30 minutes prior to cooking to help them stay together. It was tasty and cheap!

I'm a fan! Great use for the four cans of tuna my mom gave me but didn't know what to do with. I considered a casserole, but decided these with veggies/salad is summer-ier. No breadcrumbs, so I ground up some old lavash with dried herbs. Also added couple Tbps mayo for moisture and sourness in place of lemon. I like another's idea to add celery for texture next time.

Yes! Love these! I just made these... And I had no eggs... A just eye balled a big dallop of mayo... Had no Italian breadcrumbs so I used panko breadcrumbs which I added a heaping teaspoon of Italian seasoning and fried them in olive oil!  My kids asked for seconds!   Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe to start a base for a tuna patty!! I added some minced carrots and green onion as well as some white onion and celery to give it a bit of a crunch. I took the other reviewers advice and added a bit of curry powder. Wow that makes the difference! Especially for me and my family because we love spicy. I left all the other proportions of the ingredients the same. I did make them into  patties and then I  chilled them for a little bit just so that they wouldn't fall apart.  It's a great recipe, they went so fast I couldn't even believe it!! I am definitely making this recipe again and again!! Thank you so much for posting!

We enjoyed these very much.  I wanted four large size patties and used two 7-oz cans of (Costco Kirkland) tuna.  I mixed only one egg with the lemon juice and Panko crumbs and grated cheese.  When I added the tuna and onion, it did not seem to want to hold together well, so I added a spoonful of mayo. I made four large size balls with my hands and squished them down onto the griddle to form patties. Fried to golden brown in some oil.    Served these with honey-mustard sauce (equal mix of mustard and mayo, add a spoonful of honey and shake on some dried chopped onions.  Mix well and let sit while the tuna patties cook.)

This recipe is great and will become a staple. The discerning five year old loved it as did we all. I put in less tuna and added a can of salmon. Instead of frying, I baked these, with a little drizzle of grape seed oil and an extra puff of breadcrumbs on top, turning them once.

Really enjoyed this! It was nice change from my regular tuna salad lunch.  I didn't have lemon juice so I just skipped that ingredient.  I also topped mine with a little hot sauce for more flavor.  Can't wait to have it again.

Great recipe. I took recommendations from other reviewers and added finely diced celery and sweet red pepper and replaced the breadcrumbs with almond meal because that's what I had, and it added a great flavor and texture. Will make this again.

Generally we liked these. I gave it 4 stars only because I felt I needed to tweak the recipe. I added some old bay and mayonnaise and upped the cheese and onion a little.  It needed to fry a little longer than the recipe stated. But my picky husband said to keep this and that's rare. We scaled the recipe to 3 servings but only used 2 cans of tuna and used 2 eggs. It stayed together very well.

Finally tried these tonight and they are so good! I did add an extra egg, old bay seasoning, onion powder. I will probably add a little more seasoning next time. Will also try with crab meat, so yummy and something out of the ordinary! Thank you!

So in mine i did not add the onion and instead of vegetable oil i used butter same amount for butter as the recipe calls for vegetable oil. I also added corn and gravy. I also toasted my bread in the oven with butter on one side and flipped every 10 minutes til the it was the brownness i wanted. I first put one piece of bread down then the tuna patty and then corn, gravy and Parmesan cheese on top then closed it off with the second piece of bread. All I can say is YUMMY!!!!!

I loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was let the mixture set for a few minutes before I formed it into patties. This helped them not to fall apart as easily. I definitely will be making these again soon!

You can place patties on toasted bread of you choosing; top with tomato slices and swiss cheese and stick it under the broiler until the cheese melts for an awesome open faced tuna melt!

Served with tilapia fillets and hush puppies. Family loved it, even a non seafood eater (taste tester) thought they were good. Not as fishy as salmon patties. Easy to make and good for leftovers.

Very good and easy. I used Old Bay seasoning as other reviewers mentioned as well as finely chopped celery and LOTS of pepper.  I also cooked them in coconut oil which I believe was what made them even better! My husband ate three even though he said he hates tuna patties... he loved these!

They were ok. The taste was good but I wouldn't ever mix them the way the recipe suggested. Trying to fold the chunks of tuna and onion into the paste was a nightmaire ended up having to mix with my hands like bread doe. Maybe I did something wrong. I will make again I just won't mix it the way the recipe states.

Didn't have tuna, so used canned chicken, and subbed shredded cheese, Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, celery and sun-dried tomatoes with a touch of salt. Will definitely make again!

These need a lot more seasoning, I added seasoned salt, garlic powder and dill, and they still did not have very much flavor. I would also add another egg, because I had a hard time keeping them together even before cooking.

Overall great recipe. I used dried minced onion and 1  teaspoon minced garlic ( was out of onions).  I made little golf ball sized patties and browned in butter, my kids loved them.  Also, I omitted the Parmesan cheese , my kids don't like it.

Now that tuna comes in a 5 ounce can and no longer a 6 ounce can, how do you adjust the recipe?  When using 3 5 ounce cans you then get 3 ounces less.  Do you then use 4 5 ounce cans, so you get an extra 2 ounces.

I liked this, didn't love it. My boyfriend did love it though.  The patties fell apart a little bit but were manageable.  I seasoned them with a little old bay.
