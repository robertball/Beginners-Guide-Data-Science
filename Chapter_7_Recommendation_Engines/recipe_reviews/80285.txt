I would given this 5 stars, but while I'm making this, it dawned on me that you did not have macaroni pasta in this recipe. Also, I made sure there was enough water to cover my ham hocks/sausages (I also used two packages of portuguese sausage (not linguica, it falls apart to easily) as the sausage is the flavoring for the soup. I like that you added stewed tomatoes, gotta have that!! As for the macaroni, that should not be optional, the cabbage actually could be optional. And remember, cabbage soaks up your liquid, so you may have to add more water during the simmering processes. I drained my kidney beans, to take out some of the sodium, but thats not necessary. All in all, this is a great hearty soup, with or w/o cabbage; with or w/o macaroni pasta. (if your gonna add the pasta, for this recipe, a couple of handfuls is all you'll need. if u add the whole bag, or 1-lb, it will soak up all your liquid and you definitely do not want that to happen).  Thanks for this recipe! YUMMY

Thanks Pikala, Quick and easy. In the winter I can go right down the street here in Fatima, Portugal and order this off the menu at most restaurants.  When I make this at home I use less water because we enjoy it more like a stew. The only the sausage changes as you move around Portugal. We would add nothing to your Grandmothers traditional Portuguese recipe she got it right.

I've been away from home (Hawaii) many, many years.  I was so excited to see this recipe.  Excellent and very much what I remember growing up.  I can't eat pork, so I did replace ham hock with smoked turkey leg and linguica sausage with spicy chicken adouille sausaged.  Even with these modifications, though, it was the broth that makes this whole dish.  Thank you so much for sharing and bringing me back to sweet home memories!

This soup was well worth it!  My husband asked when we were going to have it again.  I followed the recipe, but pulsed the tomatoes in my food processor before adding them to the soup.  My husband will pick them out if they are too chunky.  To save prep time I chopped the onion and garlic in my food processor and sliced the carrots, celery and cabbage.

We had some linguica that needed to be used, and I found this recipe while looking to alternatives to my standard kale/white bean/potato soup... Like others, I didn't have a ham hock, but did have about a pound of bacon ends that I subbed. I did take a few other liberties, which included doubling the kidney beans and vegetables. The broth was tasty as written, but I did end up adding some smoked paprika, a touch of apple cider vinegar and some dried chili flakes.

This is the best comfort food!!! I substituted the linguica with a local spiced sausage (we don't have linguica available) and a little less water. I served it to my Protugese friends and they loved it!!!

This recipe is excellent. I didn't have a ham hock and made it with just linguica. Next time I will plan a little better. My husband wanted me to leave the potatoes out so I did. This recipe is a keeper.

This was a good recipe, I used Portuguese sausage, and smoked sausage and 3 ham hocks, instead of 1.  I also added a handful of macaroni noodles.  It was pretty tasty.

This has to be the most flavorless soup I have ever made.  Must brown the linguica first to lock in the flavor. After the linguica simmered an hour it had zero flavor. also, to much water...even my broth had no flavor...this recipe was a huge disappointment...the cooking time seems ridiculously long. Yuck

Good recipe, but it needed salt and pepper. I added soup base for extra richness.

What  wonderful heartwarming dish. Pikala has given our famiy a new favorite Portuguese Bean Soup recipe. My husband the head famiy chef was in aw : ) to receive a "thumbs-up" from the famiy. He came clean and shared where he got the recipe and gave credit where credit is due. So, "THUMBS-UP"! We look forward to other recipes.

This soup is very good; broth is outstanding. I made it with two ham hocks instead of one and substituted Johnsonville spicy Italian sausage for the linguica since I could not find any, and I still think it needs more meat. Plus I added an extra can of tomato sauce. But still a very good soup.

Loved this recipe!! I just threw it all in a regular pot with water and at first it was a little too clear so I guess I put way too much water. To fix, I just added 1 can of tomato paste and that made it perfect. I don't know why some people felt the need to add salt - the sausage was plenty salty and spicy even though I used mild Portuguese sausage. I used a small bowl to taste the soup but just kept re-filling it! Great recipe - Thanks!!

This soup is delicious! I used left over ham. I did not have any sausage but will make sure I have next time. I used butter beans instead of kidney beans because that is what I had on hand. I will  make this soup over and over! Very hearty!

Was looking for a stew with cabbage.  I substituted Kielbasa that I had on hand.  Add spices to your taste and you'll have a nice hearty meal!

I always try to make recipe the first time according to directions. I  substitute a couple slices of bacon for the hamhock as that is what I had on hand.  I thought the soup had good flavor but thickened up quite a bit. I think I would add another 2 cups of beef broth next time.Very hardy, stick to your ribs kinda soup!

This is one my favorite dishes I've had in Hawaii. As for adding macaroni I would cook it separately and add to your liking. As for me I don't like the macaroni I added watercress at the same time as the cabbage and it's a perfect combination. I add a lot more garlic also since I'm a garlic lover(2 or more cloves)

I hate to make changes and rate, but I made such slight changes.  I found this at the last minute, and didn't have a ham hock, so I skipped that part.  I also subbed Andouille.  The rest was the same, except I threw in a half a zucchini I had to use up at the end.  We absolutely loved this.  I only rated it (even though I changed it) because when I go back through my recipe box, I look for the 5 star things to remember what we loved most.  This is right up there.  Served with a Focaccia recipe from this site we also love.
