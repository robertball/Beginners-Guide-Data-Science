A terrific sandwich, however, as written, I would have to have this for breakfast due to the nutmeg and cinnamon. Some people even sprinkle the sandwich with powdered sugar. I prefer this as a lunch, so I season my beaten egg with garlic and onion powder and some pepper. I also cut way back on the amount of swiss cheese stated. Delicious!

these sandwiches were very good, but they might have been better with a different kind of bread... the french bread took a long time to cook & didn't cook very well on the inside.  Other recipes for Monte Cristo sandwiches use white or wheat bread.  Otherwise they were great. =)

I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST OKAY. I USED WHITE BREAD INSTEAD OF THE FRENCH BREAD. PLUS THERE WAS WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE ON THE SANDWICH.

These were very good...I made them more like a grilled cheese sandwich after reading the reviews.  I will definately be making again.  Thanks for the post.

Made the recipe like it says. I didn't like the french toast part.  Although I think that it might be better if it was made more like a grilled cheese sand.   Just butter the bread and brown it in the pan before adding the ham, cheese, and turkey.

I tried this recipe but we all agreed there is something missing. Wasn't easy to make... messy. And the kids turned their noses at it. I ended up taking off the french toast and "rebreading" the sandwiches.

i have fond memories of batter dipped & fried monte cristo sandwiches but like how this one has precooked bread. i used a soft but sturdy italian bread & more cinnamon & nutmeg then what was called for. note: consider using lorraine or alpine lace swiss cheese to trim the calories & sodium level. many thanks susie!

yummy! I used Challah Bread which is great for French Toast and it soaked up the egg mixture perfectly! Otherwise, I made the recipe as written. Delicious!

I am not a fan of adding nutmeg and cinnamon to the egg mixture. I like a monte cristo sandwich not a french toast sandwich but the rest of the ingredients in this recipe are spot on. I also prefer to just dip the assembled sandwiches in the egg mixture and cook. You just have to keep the heat at medium so that the bread cooks slow enough to cook all the way through and to melt the cheese and heat the meats. Sprinkle finished sandwiches with powdered sugar and serve with strawberry jam for dipping and it's just like the restaurants serve.

These were yummy.  I used white bread instead of french.  I also only used 2 pieces of cheese per sandwich.  I had leftover turkey breast, so this was the perfect way to use it up.

We've used a version of this recipe for years...we just vary the ingredients depending on availability and tastes.  A small dish of hot maple syrup for dipping is a nice touch! We like it best for lunch or supper.

I made these for the kids and my 15 YO DS said, "I liked them for the sweetness and the french toasty taste of the bread. With the cheese and meat coming into the background, it was a successful sammie" He said he would eat them again. I also used SF vanilla creamer instead of the milk.  The kids love breakfast for dinner anyway and this fit the bill to the T! Thank You Susie!

Made this for lunch today; used white bread and smoked chicken instead of turkey.  Turned out wonderful, enjoyed by all.  Served with a simple salad.  I think it would be great with a side of soup also.  Thanks for sharing !!

This sandwich was very good.  I too, liked white or potato bread, instead of the french bread.  A monte cristo sandwich is supposed to be made with an egg batter, as Susie noted in this receipe.  I noticed other reviewers suggested just grilling the sandwiches....that is not a true Monte Cristo.  Everything about this receipe is perfect, with the exception of the french bread, and that is just preference...great job Susie.

Very good!  I followed the suggestion above and substituted garlic & herb Mrs. Dash for the cinnamon & nutmeg.  I also cut down on the cheese and might cut it further next time.  Super easy though!

This was good I would recommend using honey ham...I dipped each bread in as I would be make french toast then cooked one side flipped and then added ham turkey cheese and made into and sandwich and finished cooking it that way rather than dipping the whole sandwich in the egg mixture....

Really, really good. It is a filling, change-of-pace sandwich. I followed the recipe exactly and really liked the cinnamon and nutmeg (as did the people I served it to). In addition, I made a dipping sauce from choke cherry jam, and that was a nice complement to the sandwich.

A very easy, basic Monte Cristo sandwich recipe.  I agree with others that it might be better served at dinner.  For those who said it was messy, you could try serving it as an open faced sandwich. I've had it served this way at restaurants before and it makes it a bit easier to eat.  This was a simple meal to toss together when I was short on time. The flavors go together well in my opinion, but I could understand how the French-toast flavors might not be a favorite of some.  Still, it's a fun sandwich to try.

I tried this recipe because it didn't call for deep frying.  It was pretty good.  I did use wheat bread instead of French bread.  I just thought it tasted kind of eggy.

This sandwich made for a very quick,easy and yummy weeknight dinner. I have read the different recipes for this sandwich and i chose this one as it is the style I am familiar with from local restaurants. I only used one slice of swiss per sandwich and dipped in warm maple syrup. delicious.

A good recipe but I've made better M.C. Sandwiches. I prefer the sandwich assembled then soaked and fried. I liked the chopped smoked turkey and honey ham combination instead of sliced ham and turkey.

Very good.  I think the trick to this sandwich is finding the bread that you like.  I also added a little vanilla to the egg mixture.  We were out of swiss cheese, so I used a combination of sharp aged white cheddar and mozzarella.

Sorry.  I thought this would be great, but it was just another sandwich.  Kind of bland.

Sounded sketchy at first but I was sick of the same old lunch-time sandwiches. This turned out really good. My husband liked it more than I did. He pronounced it "FantAstic!!"
