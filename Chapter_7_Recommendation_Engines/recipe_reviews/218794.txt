One runs out of options when attempting to describe a recipe you enjoyed a lot and then, unfortunately, every attempt begins to sound cliche. So, simply said, this soup is simply excellent...in every way. It's easy to prepare (I bought a rotisserie chicken and made a stock of the carcass), uses just a few, simple, fresh and healthy ingredients, smells awesome good while cooking, pretty to look at, and goes down reaaaaaaal easy and good. I also appreciated that the soup depends strictly on the flavor of its few, good ingredients and doesn't have to be pumped up with a ton of spices and herbs to make it good. Delicious, simple comfort food. Oh - and I prepared the recipe exactly as the submitter wrote it, not using the optional cornstarch slurry. It was perfectly thick and hearty without it!  (I originally posted this review back in February 2011 when it was still a “Personal Recipe.”  Glad to see it now published as a “Kitchen Approved Recipe!”)

Good as written, but like other reviewers I did not add the cornstarch & water. However due to high cholesterol issues at our house, we opted for a lower fat version made by substituting the half and half for fat free evaporated milk. (Fat free half and half will also work but I prefer the flavor of the evaporated fat free milk). We also increased the spinach to 8 ounces for extra iron and decreased the gnocchi by half. I let the soup cook a little longer, uncovered on simmer, to thicken. Saved a ton of calories while keeping the flavor of the original recipe and was super healthy!

I thought the soup was excellent. For all the people who cant find Gnocchi, most grocery stores will sell it in a vacuum sealed pouch in the pasta section. Even Walmart sells it!! Try the whole wheat and sweet potato gnocchi too!!

I have been making this soup for 3 years now.  But not from this site. This recipe is missing something fundamental. Flavour. I would suggest a tsp of thyme. Personally I also had just a hint of nutmeg and a Tbsp of sugar. I would always add these seasonings along with salt and pepper to the veggies once cooked and leave for a minute before adding anything else to let them infuse. Also I would suggest a quick chop to the spinach so you don't get long slimy strings. These changes will make it 5 stars.

I've made this twice in the past couple of weeks - once with gnocchi from the pasta aisle and once with the refrigerated stuff.  We definitely preferred the refrigerated gnocchi!  This soup has great flavor and consistency.  My son declared that this is the best chicken soup he's ever had!  It's a keeper!

Update 2/16/16: Made this tonight using a rotisserie chicken, 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2, 1 cup skim milk, and skipped the extra salt and corn starch.  Simply amazing!!

This soup is SOO good. I did modify it a bit. Instead of 1 T of oo, I used 4 T of butter & made a roux with 4 T of flour after cooking the veggies (omitting cornstarch). I added the carrots with the broth and added roasted chicken at toward the end of cooking. I also added about 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and some spices (to the soup & chicken before roasting) -- thyme, sage, and paprika. 

Last time we went to Olive Garden, my husband said he liked this recipe better. Hmmmm - did that just backfire on me? :-)

Simply genius! 
I ALWAYS get the chicken and gnocchi soup at Olive Garden with their salad and breadsticks. It's possibly my favorite restaurant meal. This is so similar to Olive Garden's recipe it's scary! I did try a few things different; but not much. I used about a cup or cup and a half more chicken broth because I made my own homemade gnocchis that my family has been making for YEARS and added about a tablespoon of flour to the soup after I poured in the half and half for a slightly thicker consistency. Turned out AMAZING. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!! I'm definitely keeping this one safe.

HOMEMADE GNOCCHIS 
--------------------------
for this recipe: 
1 cup left over mashed potatoes (just butter and milk mashed potatoes)
1 cup flour
tsp salt

Mix all together with your hands and roll out like a snake and cut into cubes. Use these in place of the premade gnocchis and cook just like the recipe says.

For another recipe... you can make the gnocchis, boil for about 7 minutes and serve with warm marinara sauce.

This soup is absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly; however, I did omit the cornstarch & water......it didn't need it.  My grocery did not have the small gnocchi so I did cut mine in half.

This soup is delicious and perfet for a cool fall day! I did not use the cornstarch/water mixture.  I  used nonfat half and half and a rotisserie chicken and it was thick, creamy, and had a great flavor.  Will make again.

Christina, this soup is excellent! Everyone here absolutely loves it. Delicious, easy, fast and full of ingredients that we all love and are always in the pantry/fridge. Followed the recipe (doubled to feed my crowd) with the exception of only adding a handful of the baby spinach leaves, knowing that there are a couple of the little ones that would not be happy seeing them. Well, I should have gone ahead with the full amount... they ate every bite with no complaints and lots of compliments and second helpings. The "cooks note" with the chicken tenders tip was perfect. There was a long "discussion" over who should be allowed to take the leftovers home with them this evening. This really is the best soup that we have had in a long time. We will enjoy this often. Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe. Easy to adjust seasoning to suit your tastes. No one should ever downgrade a recipe because it is "bland" For crying out loud, get out your favorite herbs and spices and ADJUST.

Comfort food to the max!  Great with a salad on a cold winter night.  Substitute some of the cream with milk or water for "lighter" base.  We have some in the freezer most of the time.  I spare the salt but am generous with the black pepper.  Works with escarole too.

We truly enjoyed this, but just felt it needed a little something, so added some freshly snipped basil, a bit of thyme, a touch of red pepper flakes and a handful of Parm. Didn't add the cornstarch. Will definitely make again, and thanks Christina!

I made it exactly as stated omitting the cornstarch (which I would recommend using).  I am sorry but it lacked flavor.  In retrospect it has very little seasoning in the recipe and I should have noticed that.  I added 1 package of Lipton veggie soup mix to give it more flavor.  Won't be making again.

This is a very good and comforting soup.  It won't knock you in the head with out of bounds flavor, but that's kind of the point here, I think.  I followed pretty closely but had to substitute based on my available ingredients.  I thought I had gnocchi in the freezer, but it turned out to be spinach cheese tortellini.  I didn't want to take the time to make gnocchi, so I just went with it.  I omitted the celery (don't like it), and I used about 1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream instead of 2 cups half and half.  And lastly, I don't care for the texture of cornstarch-thickened soups, so I used a butter/flour mixture.  I really enjoyed this with the tortellini and will definitely try it with gnocchi this winter.  I'll probably add even more vegetables, too.  It's a good base for all sorts of ideas.  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE:  I took the leftover soup and added crushed tomatoes (home-canned) while reheating...very good.  The tomatoes added a nice hit of acidity that played well off the creamy richness of the soup.

Great comfort food!  I sauteed chunks of chicken, added a small amount of poultry seasoning, and also a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper.  Couldn't find gnocchi, but used cheese-filled ravioli.  I did use the cornstarch slurry and it was the perfect consistency.  Very Olive Garden-like.  Next time will use the gnocchi.

A very delicious (& pretty) Soup.  I made a couple adjustments: I used chicken stock (concerned about lack of flavor comments and thought this would add some depth).   Added a tsp. of thyme & a pinch of nutmeg (as suggested by another).  I cut up the spinach into small pieces and used only 1 cup (IMO a whole bag would have been too much).  Make sure to add 1/2 & 1/2 at the very end - and slowly reheat so it won't boil.  Sprinkled parmesan cheese on top with freshly ground pepper.   The whole family LOVED it!

Christina, Your soup was EXCELLENT!  I made it exactly as written  using homemade chicken broth and grilled chicken. I especially enjoyed the addition of the baby spinach. This will definately be in our winter soup rotation. Sorry it took so long for me to try it and thanks for sharing it with us!

My girls gobbled this one up and wanted seconds, they loved the gnocchi in it.  Not only did it look like something you would get at an italian restaurant, but it taste like one.  For me, after adding 3 lg. stalk of celery, 2 lg. carrots and a small onion,plus the chicken/gnocchi  I could tell that it was going to need much more chicken broth (which I made homemade)  I must have doubled it, if not more, which required me to use more cornstarch.  And I usually like to add in Better than bouillon reduced sodium chicken base, eliminating the need for salt, for wonderful flavor.
This is now on the top of my annual soup favorites list! Thanks Christina!

This is the most tasty and soul warming soup I've had the pleasure of making! I disagree with the reviews that call it bland. I used all fresh organic ingredients. I only tweaked the recipie a little...
Used Organic chicken stock in place of broth, omitted celery (not our fave), and I omitted the cornstarch (we do not consume GMO's) I did splurge and use Organic heavy cream in place of half and half. I think this helped thicken the consistency perfectly without the cornstarch slurry. I love garlic & onion so I added to our liking and added fresh parsley and a ill seasoned salt :) I was a bit hesitant including the whole 6 oz of spinach.. I thought that would have been overkill BUT as is wilted down I kept adding more & more! The 6oz amount recommended was just perfect. Thank you Christina for sharing! My plan is to make another batch for my Italian Mamma, she will appreciate this recipie as well!

Beautiful and delicious! The spinach leaves were a great touch. My only addition here was simmering the heavy cream (instead of 1/2 & 1/2) with fresh rosemary and butter before adding to my soup. It was enchanting! Next time I think I'll add more broth since my gnocchi seemed to absorb quite a bit.

This was real comfort food.  Just what we needed after a LONG day of raking and bagging leaves.  I think I would have preferred it to be a bit thicker, so next time I'll add more of a corn starch slurry.  But other than that, it was perfect and I didn't change a thing from the original recipe.  I used low-sodium chicken broth, and it tasted just fine.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Christina.  It was delicious!

I have many chicken soup recipes, and this one rates up there with the best.  I will use this over and over all winter.
My husband loved it.

Absolutely delicious!  Added a little garlic powder and italian seasoning and used homemade gnocchi...turned out great...Hubby went back for thirds and the kids ate it enthusiastically! Not often that we don't have leftovers! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!!!!!

This was very good! I didn't have to use the cornstarch, I liked the soups consistency without it. I served with garlic bread.

This was soooo good!  DH and I really enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to having it leftover.  I used my food processor to chop the onion, carrots & celery-- maybe a little too fine, but it turned out great.  I could see that as an easy way to get your family to eat more veggies!  I did use the cornstarch slurry because I wanted it thicker than it was with just the half-and-half.  This goes together fast (especially if you already have cooked chicken on hand) but tastes like you spent hours on it.  I'll definitely make this again.

Comforting and delicious is right on Christina! We loved this soup and I appreciate how quick and easy it is to throw together. Followed the recipe closely, using a small rotisserie chicken that I pulled apart. I used fat free half-and-half and only about a cup, that was plenty creamy for us and saved quite a few calories and fat. I had half a red bell pepper that needed using so I diced that up with the other veggies. There was no need for the optional cornstarch slurry, this was a perfect consistency without it. For those that commented that this soup lacked flavor, I would look to your chicken broth as the culprit! Make sure you choose a flavorful one, or better yet make your own.

Being a vegetarian, I swapped veggie broth for chicken broth and swapped equal amount of cubed, firm tofu for the chicken-- my carnivorous husband and I both loved it! We also used 1/2 regular half and half and the other 1/2 fat free. we skipped the thickening steps and it was fine.

I know I'm in the minority here, but we found this to be pretty bland. I wound up throwing half of this away. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious. Fantastic. Fabulous. This recipe is perfect- totally perfect! It was a huge hit to everyone I served it too, and it reheats beautifully! I got 6 generous servings. I did add the cornstarch slurry- and I used Fat Free Half/Half. I added a pinch of thyme and basil too. Thank you for such a yummy treat!!

Excellent! I made this for a small dinner party last night and it received rave reviews from everyone. Several of those reviews came from very picky eater. Followed the recipe exactly, included fresh Parmesan cheese on the table and let everyone top their own bowl as desired. So yummy with the Parmesan, French bread and glass of red wine. My husband (picky eater #1) requested I make this part the usual lineup.

Wholesome soup with lots of flavor.  I followed the recipe to the letter except that I only had 1 c. of FF half-and-half, so the other cup was skim milk (it turned out fine), and I used full size gnocchi (all that was available).  For those reviewers commenting that it's bland or missing something, it must be the broth they used.  I used Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock (rich in color and flavor) which I think is the best available.  We enjoyed this, and it will be made again.

This soup is amazing! I pretty much followed the recipe as written. The few changes I made is I cooked my chicken in the pan with the veggies and I didn't use the cornstarch and cold water as I didn't want the soup super thick I thought it was just right amount of creamy soup consistency. I also doubled the broth, cream , and gnocchi but left everything as is. I will make this again and again! We loved it. Oh a few suggestions top with cheese such as parmesan or mozzerella and serve with crusty bread!

Wow. This was fabulous. I read the reviews and I can't imagine anyone not liking this recipe. I used all the ingredients excluding corn starch and water. I shredded all the veges in the food processor just for consistency. I added heavy cream vs half n half. It was superb. It was 30 degrees outside here and it was so enjoyable eating this by the fire. Ive shared this recipe with several friends and family today. Yummmmmm!

Really delicious soup! I'll be making this again and again. 
I added another can of chicken broth because I like a good amount of liquid to dip bread into, but that's just a personal preference.

A bit bland for our tastes.  I have never eaten the Chicken and Gnocchi soup at Olive Garden so maybe I just don't care for the soup in general?  I think it would be better maybe if I added in some Italian Sausage and may try that if I make it again...

Oh, my--this was so good and flavorful! There were so many different flavors and textures, but not a single one that was overly powerful. I had never tried gnocchi before, and I wasn't a real big fan of it, but it was easy to pick out of the soup. I think that next time I will substitute with shells or another kind of pasta. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Yumm... went to Olive Garden the other day for soup, salad, and bread sticks, this was the soup (or very similar) to the one I had! As soon as I got home I began searching the web to find a version of it. I found several but this is the one that sounded the most like it. I made it today for a get together and it got two thumbs up all around....even by the 1 - 10 year old boys that were here (6 of them). I WILL BE MAKING AGAIN AND AGAIN!

Although I didn't add the cream (not fond of cream soup), it was delicious.  I did use frozen spinach and added 3 cups water with 1 T. chicken bouillon.  I would add more carrots next time...and perhaps mushrooms although DH would prefer asparagus.  All done in the crockpot in 3 hours on high.

This recipe isn't right..... You forgot the dried thyme and fresh parsley. Also you need to first make a roux by adding flour to butter and oil mixture. NO cornstarch and NO basil! It's parsley OG uses in this soup, not basil!

This was one of the best soups I've had in a long time too, Christina! I saw someone on the buzz mention using leftover turkey and broth in this recipe - I had an 'aha' moment and dinner was born, thanks to the idea and all my turkey leftovers. It was brilliant. I will say though, that I will try a different brand of gnocchi next time, or just make my own dumplings. The brand I bought was not great and really distracted from the rest of the soup.

A little bit bland for my taste. I doubled the garlic and added some basil for a little extra flavor but it still seemed to be missing something.

WOW!!!!!!!!! Seriously good soup!!!! I made this last night for dinner, perfect for a rainy fall evening!! My boyfriend had 2 and a half bowls!!! He said he can't wait for me to make it again! I did everything as directed, minus the cornstarch mixture (it was plenty thick without it) for my chicken i grilled 6 boneless, skinless tenders and chopped them up. It was delicious!!! Definitely making this a regular!! Thank you for sharing!

I am beginning cook always looking for dinner recipes that are not ordinary or over done. This soup was one of the best things I've tasted! Creamy and yummy and super easy to make! (Which I can say because I am a beginner). The only changes I made were: Omitted celery out of personal taste. I used 9oz of frozen spinach, which I cooked and drained to pkg instructions. I also used frozen gnocchi, because it was all I could find. It was also a 25 oz bag of the standard gnocchi (not a 16oz pack of mini), but you can never have enough of those delicious dumplings! It just added a bit more body  to my soup making it more of a stew in texture, but it was perfectly fine for me! (the boyfriend loved it too!) Also: It took about 15 minutes for my onions to be translucent, which was okay with me! I hate the crunch onion texture but love the flavor, and cooking them so long gave me just what I wanted. I even took the Christina's tip on baking the chicken tenders with salt, paper and garlic powder. Superb!

This soup was very tasty!  I used tortellini in place of the gnocchi, which turned out great.  I ended up needing an extra can of chicken broth simply because the tortellini really soaked it up, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  Will make again...but next time I'll try the sweet potato gnocchi.

Comfort food a it's best.   My husband loves, loves gnocchi and to be added to a good soup base makes it even better.    Cornstarch is not necessary nor are any other changes.

Excellent soup!  I used five garlic cloves. Since I'm lactose intolerant, I substituted the half and half with broth, thickened with potato flakes.    Topped each bowl with a little shredded Parmesan cheese and snipped chives.  Definite winner!

FANTASTIC!  What a great soup for a rainy fall day.  Comfort food at it's best!  It was the first time we've tried gnocchi and Hubby and I both really enjoyed it.  Thank you Christina for sharing this FANTASTIC soup!

We have been making more homemade soups lately and this soup is one of the best! I poached 2 boneless chicken breasts,cut them into cubes and added them to the soup. Like most of the other reviews I didn't add the optional cornstarch. It is creamy and comforting and a new family favourite.

This soup was wonderful! I have tried other chicken and gnocchi soups before and was never impressed. I took some others advice before making it and omitted the cornstarch. I also added 5 celery stalks because I like a fuller soup. For the carrots I just bought a bag of organic already shredded carrots. I also followed someone's advice and added basil, hot read pepper flakes and a handful of parm. cheese. It was delicious!!

This recipe was delicious! The only adjustments i made was that i added a little thyme, nutmeg, and parsley. For a little flavor boost. I also substituted the half & half for evaporated milk because thats what i had on hand. It was so good! I loved it, and my mom and husband loved it too!

It looked perfect, but it didn't taste great at all. I looked at a different recipe and it had the same ingredients except it added butter, flour, and basil which made it absolutely perfect! When I made the original recipe is was so watery. I expected it to taste like Olive Garden's Chicken and Gnocchi but I was let down. Adding those last 3 ingredients made it thicker and look exactly like OG's.

I love this soup. I do add broccoli, and sometimes peppers which are both excellent additions. I only use 1 cup of half half but use the substitute of 1 tbsp of butter and enough milk to reach a cup. I also add sugar, thyme and nutmeg like some of the other reviews. I do end up using more chicken broth to get a bigger pot of soup too because it's so good.

My family and friends absolutely love this recipe. I found it OKAY, but maybe that's because I spent the whole day making it! I also doubled the recipe, not realizing how big the original recipe was.
I decided to broil chicken breasts for this recipe. I followed the instructions from Basic Broiled Chicken Breasts (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/basic-broiled-chicken-breasts/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=broiled%20chicken&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Reviews) The only difference is I added garlic powder and paprika to the chicken.
When it came to prepping the soup, I didn't grate the carrots. I cut them into little pieces instead to save time, and they turned out fine.
Instead of using oil to cook the veggies, I took some of the leftover oil/dripping from the pan I used to cook the chicken. It added a nice extra flavour to the whole entire soup. 
I took the advice of others and added some thyme and nutmeg to the veggies while they cooked.
I also cut up the spinach, so it'd be easier to eat.
I only used half of the cream, because I didn't want a thick, creamy soup. Even without the cream it tasted great. It really just depends on what kind of soup you'd prefer.
Either way, it really isn't necessary to add the cornstarch mixture.

Really hearty and tasty. I used more vegetables (probably 5 carrots and 6 stalks celery), added more broth, as well as thyme and basil, and only used about 1/2 cup half and half. Delicious!

Yummy soup and a surprise hit with my family. I wasn't sure how they would react to the spinach, but no one commented except to say how good it was!. 
I made a few adjustments based on what I had at home etc. I found my chicken broth a little lacking in taste, so I added some boullion powder. I also did not have fresh spinach, but I used a package of frozen chopped spinach which worked really well. In the interest of cutting down on fat, I substituted a can of 2% evapoarted milk for the cream and it was still really good (but I bet the cream would be better!).
This will definitely be  a make again recipe.

Delicious.  I love gnocchi, so any soup that includes it already has a leg up on anything else. I added a chicken boullon cube just to intensify the flavors a little, and added more carrot.

Made exactly as written and although I thought it was good, it didnt knock my socks off. Definately quick and easy with easy to find ingredients, which is always a plus. Will make again, but will make some adjustments for personal taste.

What a nice soup....used the breast meat from a store bought rostisserie chicken (time saver)....save and froze carcass and bones for stock.*  Also added shredded zucchini and a pack of sliced mushrooms....used a block of frozen spinach instead of fresh since it was what I had on hand.....omitted the cornstarch/water slurry.....and used a fresh gnocchi which I think added some thickness to the soup as they cooked in it....also used fat free half and half. Great soup....simple and hearty....thanks!

Ahhhh, it's lovely, it's just lovely!   Delicate, balanced flavors, make it exactly as-written!  I added a bit of spice @ the end to suite our tastes, but it is lovely as-is!  I could not find gnocchi to save my life, after several attempts I looked up the recipe on this site (Gnocchi I) and used my left-over Thanksgiving mashed potatoes to make the dough myself.  So simple!  And no, to those reviewers not familiar with gnocchi, it does NOT have much flavor in and of itself, much like pasta, it should take on the flavor of the dish.  We will make this again & again, whenever we are in the mood for something elegant and light and lovely!

This was a great soup! Did a very simple version of it - cubed chicken, gnocchi, and some chopped broccoli in chicken broth with some onion salt and pepper. The chicken was a little bland so I will have to season it better next time, but this was a very quick and easy dinner!

I have never bought or eaten gnocchi before, but now that we've tried this soup, I will be buying it more often.  My kids LOVED it, even with the "green stuff".  They were so disappointed that it was all eaten at one meal, and have been requesting it often.  Will for sure be made again.  This was easy and quick to prepare and is a terrific fall soup!  Thanks, Christina!

Comforting is definitely the word that best describes this soup. That, and delicious!  This reminds me of the chicken and noodles my grandmother used to make.  I used three smallish boneless breasts, just seasoned with celery salt, a pinch of poultry seasoning, and pepper and baked 30 min at 350.  I could only find large gnocchi so I halved them, worked perfectly.  I followed the recipe as far as amounts, just seasoned with celery seed, a smidge of poultry seasoning and white pepper.  I did not use the slurry, this was very rich and creamy without it.  I may add a little more chicken broth next time (I used lower sodium).  Just wonderful, a definite do-over and surely a crowd pleaser.  You have a winner here, Christina!  Thank you for sharing it with us.

My family LOVED it!. I changed up a few things. I had Sweet Potato Gnocchi so I used it and regular gnocchi. It added a very distinct flavor that complemented the carrots and spinach. I also used greek yogurt because I was out of 1/2 & 1/2. We topped with shreaded cheese and it was awesome.  NO LEFT overs.

Great! No processed ingredients, easy and relatively quick with a rotisserie chicken and pre-shredded carrot. Husband and toddler both loved it. Beautiful to look at, too, with all the colors from the veggies! I added a red pepper because I had it in the fridge.

I love the Chicken Gnocchi soup at Olive Garden and this is not exactly but it is close.  One of the nice things with making at home, I can use all white meat.  Olive Garden uses dark chicken and it isn't my favorite.  I used the fat free evaporated milk and simmered to thicken the soup instead of adding cornstarch.  Cornstarch doesn't hold up for leftovers.  This is a good hardy filling soup.  A keeper.

This was so amazingly good.  Even my "soup hater" loved this soup. The only thing I did different was I made my own gnocchi, otherwise, I made it exactly like the recipe.  Will definitely make it again.

Quick and easy! Super delicious. Modifications I made where using cheese sausage instead of the chicken because we like the taste better. I could not for the life of me find gnocchi and so I used cheese tortellini (next time I will use the gnocchi. Tortellini was good, but I should have left it out....just too much pasta for a soup like this). I also used basil, thyme, and parsley. It was soooooo good! Husband said it tasted better than Olive Garden's!

Very easy & tasty. As suggested by others, I added some spices to the soup while cooking, used fat free half and half and didn't add the cornstarch. The only thing is, it didn't thicken quite like I would have liked. I will definitely try it again, but make some adjustments to make it thicker.

Amazing! I'm usually not one to review, but this is delicious and will definitely become a staple in my dinner plans. It doesn't need the cornstarch, it thickens up nicely on its own with the gnocchi.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't change this recipe, other than adding a bit more chicken, carrots, and broth.  This is the best!  It could very likely replace my traditional chicken noodle soup.

Mixed reviews on this one.....husband loved it (5 stars) while I thought it was a decent base (made per recipe, I gave it 3 stars), hence the compromised 4 stars.  As per usual, I can always find something in a recipe that I feel could be tweaked, and this one was no exception. I'll make again with the following changes: definitely will add another two cups of chicken broth to compensate for all the veggies and chicken. (I use Better Than Buillion.....definitely the best flavor I've found); I'll use far less celery, or just omit it altogether (not a huge fan), thin slices of carrot (not shredded); I'll make a roux with butter & flour, as even with double the cornstarch slurry, I still found the consistency a bit too thin for my liking....easy fix and certainly no fault of the recipe; but rather a personal preference for thicker soups. I'll add garlic powder to my liking and thinly slice or shred the baby spinach instead, as I'd rather see smaller bits in my spoonfuls. I would also add a handful of shredded parmesan to my bowl, as I love cheese! Served with flaky crescent rolls, this was a nice dinner for a cold and snowy Colorado night. We're fans of gnocchi though, and I'm always looking for creative ways to incorporate it into our dinner rotations, so thank you for the inspiration, Christina!

I tried this because I love the chicken and gnocchi soup at Olive Garden and this sounded close.  Loved it!  Couldn't find mini gnocchi so used full sized ones.  Mini's would have been better, but couldn't fault the recipe for that!  I did use fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  Froze leftovers, but got it back out of the freezer the very next week for some work lunches.  Excellent!

Amazing! I used pre-shredded carrots. I had also cooked bone-in split chicken breasts in the crockpot until it fell off the bone and then shredded it for this. Yum! I used less spinach (because I don't love it) and did use fat-free half-and-half. This was wonderful! Definitely a keeper for us! Thanks for sharing, Christina!

Very good.  I added a bit less milk product to mine, since I'm not a huge fan of creamy soups, and I left out the thickener since bf isn't crazy about thick soups.  This is a nice, hearty soup that is great for a fall evening.  I had regular spinach, so I chopped it in the food processer, and tossed in some chopped red pepper.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

All I can say is that this is delicious! I only added some thyme and did half with milk and half and half to equal 2 cups.  This is totally a saver.

I'm obsessed with this soup! I ended up using less onions than it said, but the taste is amazing and I'm definitely making it for the next potluck dinner!

Based on other reviews I added some dried thyme and red pepper flakes to make it more flavorful.  I did use the thickener (but not cornstarch, I used the easy blend flour mixed with a few tablespoons of cold water) because i felt the consistency wasn't as creamy as i would have liked it after the h&h went in. At the very end, I threw in some leftover bacon I had on hand which differs from the way Olive Garden serves it but made this oh so yummy.   Served with fresh grated Parmesan it was delicious.

I didn't measure anything exactly and added shredded bacon along with the chicken since I had some in the fridge. This turned out very delicious. Saving this to make in the future!

My husband said, "you can make this every week and I'd be happy".  I used dried gnocchi from the pasta aisle and the only change is I left out the water/cornstarch slurry as the soup didn't need it.  Truly delicious and comes together quickly - it's in the regular rotation.  Thanks Christina!

1/19/2017  made the soup again, it is a great weeknight dinner.  Used 3 small shallots in a fine mince instead of the onion + garlic.  My chicken broth was from "Better than Bouillon" which I highly recommend as a pantry staple.  Maybe some of the complaints were that their chicken broth was too bland?

The soup was ok.  Seemed like too much celery.  I guess you really need to process it and the onions to really mince them.  The recipe was easy enough and something I can build on.

This was really good. I did add thyme, sage, paprika and parmesan cheese as other readers had suggested. My one son wouldn't try it because of the spinach in it. His loss is my gain (more for me).

Yummy and warms you up on a cold night. I made a few changes. I doubled the garlic, added a teaspoon of thyme and substituted a 14 oz can of coconut milk for the half & half as we don't eat dairy. I did add the cornstarch and water because I prefer a thicker soup.

I have made this twice.  Firt time with the pasta type gnocchi (that's all I could find at the time)- this time with the potato type.  The potato gnocchi is so much better!  Love the dumpling texture.  I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and I omitted the cornstarch.  Even though I used the fat free 1/2 & 1/2 it still thickened up enough.  My husband who rejects any green food loved it and even ate the spinach......total shocker.  I will for sure be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

What a wonderful soup! I really enjoyed it. I didn't put the carrots in the soup. I'm not much of a carrot fan. I also used broth from a left over chicken and put some Parmesan cheese on top. Better than olive garden chicken gnocchi soup! Will definitely keep this recipe for the future!

Great recipe. does not need cornstarch, it is thick enough on its own. Loved the idea about using store bought rotisserie chickens. Works out perfect.  I would love to try this with fresh made gnocci's...that would probably put this dish further over the edge than it already is.

It was very good. My boyfriend said it tastes better than Olive Garden's chicken gnocchi soup! I did make a few small changes. I used a rotisserie chicken to cut some time down. I ended up adding an extra cup of chicken broth because it didn't seem like enough liquid to cook the gnocchi in. I added thyme, garlic powder, pepper, and a little bit of basil. The extra spices really added flavor to the soup. I tried to thicken it by taking a little of the broth and adding flour and then mixing it back in. But it didn't really make a difference. I am still working  on how to thicken soups correctly:) will make it again.

What a treat this soup was! I adapted it slightly but kept very close to the recipe. I used home made chicken stock, some chopped garlic, I chopped the spinach, used cayenne black pepper blend, home made gnocchi and a bit of fresh thyme.  I used lactose free whole milk with great results.  The soup was thick, rich and very satisfying on a chilly day. Family thought the soup would also be good using sausage in place of the chicken. So good and easy to put together! Will definitely make again.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I know I'm really young for a home chef, but the directions were so easy to follow I could teach my little sister to cook this. Now, I added a bit more cornstarch and chicken, because I like my soups full of ingredients and really thick, and I didn't shred the carrots, opting for slicing instead and its a gorgeous soup with amazing flavor. I highly recommend this for a rainy, cold day!

I did not use carrots.  I used 3  cups of chicken broth and  one can of Carnation Fat-Free Milk and no cornstarch because the gnocchi thickens the broth.   Wow, was this great,  Yum!

We loved this dish.  I used leftover roasted chicken so used both white and dark meat.  I also used 1 cup of the drippings from the chicken dinner which I thinned out with 1 cup of water then added 1 cup of low salt chicken broth.   I allowed the soup to simmer on low for a couple of hours.  Will be making again.  Thank you Christina for sharing this wonderful recipe. UPDATE I DID THIS RECIPE AGAIN AND INSTEAD OF THE GNOCHHI I ADDED A SMALL PACKAGE OF CHEESE TORTALLINI.  I ALSO ADDED DRY BASIL, ORAGINO AND SUMMER SAGE (DRY LEAVES) TO ADD A LITTLE ITALIAN FLAIR.  WORKED GREAT.

This has become a family favorite! This is just like the Olive Garden soup in my opinion. I did not add the cornstarch and water the second time we made it because we were vacationing at an efficiency and I wasn't going to buy a box of cornstarch just to get a tablespoon, and it turned out just fine. This is a winter season regular! Kudos to Christina.

4 and 1/2....not because you need to change anything...but because next time, I'll use the fresh Gnocchi.  Very good...I used less half and half for a little less guilt.  Very good...I could see even omitting the half and half if you wanted.

Excellent soup! To make the recipe, I used equal amounts of the onions, celery and carrots (1 cup), but followed the rest as written. It was very thick, reminding me of chicken pot pie, without the crust. I may add frozen peas next time.

This is my favorite soup at OG but I think this recipe is even better. I added a tsp. of basil and a tsp. of oregano and doubled the recipe. It goes to the tops of our favorite soups. I served this with homemade sour dough bread. Yum!

Wow! Unexpectedly delicious! Just looking at the ingredients I wasn't sure how this would turn out. But read the reviews & decided to give it a shot. So glad I did! I wanted to make it easier so cooked three 4oz chicken breasts in a dutch oven with the onions, garlic & celery. After the chicken was browned on both sides, I chopped it into bite size pieces & added the broth. Salt, pepper, a bit of onion powder & a sprinkle of poultry seasoning. Added the gnocchi & let it cook then added the fat free half & half. Boom! Deliciousness! 15 y/o son had 2 big bowls. Oh but I forgot the spinach :( Oh well next time!

This is a wonderful dish.   I've made it before, but forgot to review it.   This lacks nothing and can be made exactly as is.   I did have to use frozen spinach, but otherwise followed exactly.   Thank you.

just finished making this soup.  It is a keeper.  Season your veggies w/ Oregon, basil, parsley, season your chicken before adding and use a good chicken stock..thats it.  flavors come together beautifully.  hearty and satisfying....this will be a regular especially with the colder months coming. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Substituted no fat Greek yogurt at the very end for the half-n-half.  Let the soup cool some, add the spinach to cool it a bit more and stir in the yogurt.  Very good!

This was love at first bite!  I’ve made this several times and each time it’s been fabulous, although I must confess that I double the amount of spinach.  That’s my favorite part of the soup!  As they say, all good things take time.   It never hurts to let the vegetables and chicken simmer for a longer period of time so all of the flavors have ample time to absorb into the broth.  Another tip is to use well seasoned chicken.  That, too, will give it additional flavor.

Tried this soup tonight...........another winner......another keeper.The only changes I made was I didn't have any canned/boxed chicken stock in the house.  So it took longer to make because I had to make my own stock.  Also, I added more garlic and other spices. Thanks, Christina.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site, and one of my husband's all time favorite meals! We make it all the time and it just turns out soooo good. Sublime comfort food. The recipe itself is pretty perfect; I just make sure to simmer the vegetables til they're good and soft, and watch the sodium level in the soup as store-bought gnocchi can be surprisingly salty! We never bother to thicken it, and it never needs extra seasoning. This will be a staple in our household for years to come.

My family loved this soup! Its our favorite at the olive garden and the taste was almost exact. However i did not add the cornstarch/water and put just a little less vegtables than the receipe called for. Will make again!

We found this just okay. The broth needs some spices since it is bland. Easy to make, just needs some spices.

Made exactly according to recipe and it was a hit, even with all that spinach.  Beautiful to the eye and the palate.  Had requests to make it again.  It's easy enough that I probably will.  Delicious!

very good flavor I used 1/4 tsp of pepper and no added salt as the broth I was using was pretty high in sodium content. I would add salt if I was using home made broth.

We LOVE This soup! I found that the gnocchi in the pasta section is much better than the frozen for sure! I have also substituted the half and half with milk, adding a bit more cornstarch and there is no difference in the taste/texture-trying to watch the fat is all....Great recipe-one of my favorite soups!

UPDATE: HAD LUNCH AT THE "CHAIN" WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS. I TRIED THEIR FAMOUS SOUP AND MUST SAY CHRISTINA'S IS FAR SUPERIOR (KUDOS TO YOU!)!!! Pretty good! My hubs didn't care for this, but that's because he's not a fan of cream-based soups. Had I not added cream, he would have gobbled this up. :) I feared this would be terribly bland, but you'd be surprised what a few veggies and a dash of s&p can do.... Our soup was PERFECTLY seasoned! My only complaint is that I was expecting a slightly thickened soup. Even after adding the optional cornstarch slurry, my broth was VERY runny. My husband likened the broth to watered down milk. I will tinker with this a bit to see what I can do about that. I can't compare this to the "chain's" soup because I've never tried it. NOTE #1: If you can find them, splurge for MINI gnocchi. You want tiny bites of pasta, not BIG ones. Gnocchi is a heavy pasta to begin with  and a little goes a LONG way. If you live in the Chicagloand area, Caputo's sells BOTH varieties. NOTE #2: Unless you prefer long, stringy strands of spinach with every bite, chop yours first. Served with garlic breadsticks, this was a nice meal. Thanks for sharing, Christina! :-)

I left out the cornstarch and spinach (mainly because the spinach would have made my daughters leary to try it and I wasn't sure what consistency I would end up with after the cornstarch.)   LOVED this!  My kids are asking for this weekly and my oldest won't eat anything!  We looked and looked for a good recipe after having chicken gnocchi soup at a famous restaurant chain. I promise, this was better than theirs!

Left out the chicken used tortalinni instead because I could not find gnocchi, added extra garlic and topped with some parm and crumbled bacon. WOW really yummy soup.

Liked the idea of this soup yet it was a little bland.  Definitely would need to add more seasonings for my tastes.

I live in Italy and this is the first dish I have made with gnocchi.  This recipe was super easy to make and it did not need the cornstarch and water mix and I used about half the amount of half-and-half.  Using a rotissarie chicken also saved me lots of time.  Being able to buy fresh ghocchi at the store was awesome!

Excellent! Definitely benefitted from a tsp. thyme, 1/2 tsp. pepper, and some salt, and a pinch of nutmeg, as a couple other reviewers suggested. I left out the celery and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. Also added a Tablespoon of vinegar at the end. Really brightened all the flavors.

This was fabulous!  I used more veggies and added an extra can of chicken broth (3 total), then followed others' advice about not thickening with cornstarch.  Big mistake, but totally my fault for adding more broth!  Next time, I will thicken with cornstarch if I add more broth, and I bet it will be perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've never written a review on here before but I just had to share with everyone just how delicious this soup is!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe and it was so very yummy!!!!  I've made it twice in the last week, it is that good.  I would recommend following the recipe without making any changes, just give it a chance, i think you will find it is super tasty just the way it is!  thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I followed the directions exactly, and it tasted wonderful.  I did after tasting it add a pinch of nutmeg to compliment the spinach, and grated some parmensan on top before serving it. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was AMAZING!  So simple, yet so flavorful.  We absolutely loved it.  I made it as written (using the cornstarch/water), except used fat-free 1/2 and 1/2.  It was sooooo good!  This one is a keeper.  Thanks!

I followed this recipe, as written, using the cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce, but used whole wheat gnocchi from Trader Joes and it was phenomenal;  very tasty and comforting. Will definitely make again!  Thank you Christina

This recipe is amazing! Only thing I changed was I did not use the cornstarch and I increased the garlic that I sauteed the chicken and veggies in, just because I love garlic! Oh and I didn't have spinach but I had baby romaine leaves and threw a bunch in to give it the color. Absolutely amazing! Thanks!!

How can something so simple be so good? I've made this soup several times now and it's always a hit. I use an extra cup of broth and 1 cup of heavy cream instead of the half & half. Sprigs of fresh thyme (removed before serving) really make the flavor "pop". Haven't used the cornstarch thickening but I don't think it is necessary. Serve with a salad and some good crusty Italian or French bread....nummy, nummy! Thanks Christina!

This is a great recipe for a hearty creamy soup. However I always add oregano, garlic powder and basil to the chicken before I add it to the oil. Just tossing these with the chicken works the best. I also always add freshly grated parmesan to the soup and parmesan shavings to the top before serving. Such a good recipe though!

This soup is pretty easy to make and sooo good. Perfect for a winter's night. I used a grilled chicken breast and some left over turkey from Christmas. I used whole wheat gnocchi, and organic spinach and carrots from my produce box. So all in all it was pretty healthy. Others said they didn't add the cornstarch & water mixture, but I did, along with the half and half. It would have probably been ok without it but it was SO good with it! It is true that it can be a bit bland so just spice it up with some more pepper, thyme or other herbs, and I added some cayenne pepper because we like things a bit spicy in my house. Definitely will make this again!

I took other reviewers advice and substituted fat free condensed milk for half and half and also added extra spinach. Fabulous! Even my 1 year old daughter ate it up and the spinach was her favorite part. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I thought this was really good.  My kids didn't care for the texture of the gnocchi.  I left out the celery and spinach so my kids would at least try it.  I used skim milk to cut down on fat.  When I went in the fridge later to take a bite it was VERY thick so next time I might make it ahead just so it's thick.  Good and very easy,

Delicious, even without the gnocchi!  I left it out because I was on a tight budget.  I diced the carrots instead of shredding.  I'm looking forward to trying this with the gnocchi.

Amazing soup! My family loved it . Made it with fat free half and half and it was still great minus the fat. Added a little cayenne for some extra zing. Next time I might add mushrooms for a little variation.  This is a great meal for a cold fall or winter night.

I took the basics of this recipe and tweeked it with what I had on hand.  I used leftover turkey from thanksgiving.  Tortellini instead of gnocchi.  I added a can of chopped green chili's and some homemade sofrito. I used poultry gravy mix to help thicken it.  My family LOVED IT!

This soup is DELICIOUS!  It's very simple to make and even my picky son couldn't get enough of it.  It certainly warmed the pipes on a cold day (can you say, comfort food?)  I will definitely make this soup again...and again....and again!  Loved it!

Well I love this recipe. I changed it a tad by adding a bit more chicken broth 2 1/2 cups and allowed more simmering time in between each step. This seemed to allow all of the favors to blend better. Great recipe!!!!

We loved this soup!  The reason it got only 4 stars is that is was a little bland, I added about a half tsp of thyme and 1 tsp of salt.  Also I did use 1 tsp cornstarch/water mixture to add a little thickness but not too much, it was perfect.  Next time I will chop the spinach.

Interesting to read the reviews because we found it to be very bland. If we could make it more flavorful we would try it again but it'd have to have more punch.

I am a Huge fan of this soup at the Italian restaurant chain and this is a close second. I chopped the spinach like someone else recommended and thats how I've seen it there. Only change I would make next time is to cut back spinach to 3 or maybe 4 oz's(6 was alot), but didn't change the flavor. 5 out of 5 ppl in the house enjoyed it and that includes my 5 and 6 yr old girls. Will for sure be making again. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I actually used 6 cups of chicken broth, did not add the cornstarch/water mixture as others said not to and I also added some thyme and it turned out great.   my husband was pretty skeptical when I told him about it (he asked what other meat was in it) but once he got home, smelled it and tasted it he couldn't stop eating it.

I give this three stars because it has possibilities. I liked it better before adding the 1/2 and 1/2. The dairy just diluted the flavor.  Maybe try adding a pinch of nutmeg since it goes great with greens and milk based soups. There are so many other great soups out there that this one is not a keeper at my house.

Very good, very different flavor from the norm. I made with the ingredients as told to but I cooked the chicken along with the other ingredients in a crock pot all day. When ready for dinner I transferred to a pot on the stove then did the gnocchi, spinach, half and half.  Yum!

Super yummy recipe! My test is to see if my kids will eat without being told, and they loved it! My husband wants me to try using coconut milk next time, but I think why bother when it tastes so good as is. This recipe has defiantly made it into the rotation of meals!

This soup is delicious!!  I roasted a whole chicken and used the breast meat for the soup.  To make it lighter, I used fat free half and half.  It tasted as good if not better than Olive Garden's!

Good base, but lacks flavor.  Tastes good with salt and pepper added.  Will season the chicken next time.  I liked it more than my dad did.  Gnocchi is not flavorful at all and the texture is a tad offputting.  Will probably make again but omit gnocchi and add homemade noodles, and add seasonings.

As recommended in the reviews, I seasoned the veggies with thyme, salt, tumeric and a dash of cayenne pepper.
then followed the recipe as written.

Was very  yummy and would make it again!

We loved this!  I was skeptical about the fact that there weren't any herbs or spices in the ingredient list, but it was delicious!  My husband added some hot pepper sauce to his serving, but I was happy with the flavors of the ingredients themselves.  I love the idea of using gnocchi as dumplings too -- so easy!

This soup was delicious.  It was not quite as thick as I was expecting, but then again, I did not add the cornstarch mixture and I cooked the gnocchi separate as someone else suggested.  Still very tasty and would definitely make it again.

PLEASE TRY THIS! I love this recipe. I substituted Fat Free Half and Half and it still tasted AMAZING! My boyfriend also LOVED it and hes never had it before. As for me, It tastes EXACTLY the same as Olive Gardens' Chicken Gnocchi. Definitely a MUST try in the kitchen. ENJOY!

Loved this soup. I had some chicken I had roasted the night before that I used to make the broth and used for the chicken. I couldn't find mini gnocchi so I used regular sized. I skipped the cornstarch/water step. My family really enjoyed this soup, and hubby even took some to work with him so definitely a hit :) Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this soup as the directions said to. Tasting as I went I think next time I will stop before I put in 1/2 and 1/2.  I loved it with and without but to cut calories  I will leave it out. It was plenty salty so I didn't have to add any salt and both daughters and husband ate it and said they would eat it again.  Great recipe!!

So so good!! I didn't use starch and used fat free half and half. I like soup nice and chunky and I added more celery, carrots and onions than called for, and probably chicken too though I didn't weigh it. This was the absolute perfect meal for a cold rainy windy day like today. Loved it!

This is absolutely delicious. The only thing I did wrong was put too many carrots in..I love carrots. I scaled it down to only 3 servings..for a single person that's a lot of meals. Simple and delicious. Just how I love it

I just got done eating this soup and all I can say is.. oh. my. word. By far one of the best soups I have had in a long time. I couldn't stop eating it! 
Instead of regular gnocchi I used whole wheat sweet potato gnocchi. And instead of the half and half I used organic unsweetened soy milk (lactose intolerant). I also added a teaspoon of italian seasoning to the veggies as they were sauteeing. All of this resulted in an ahhhmazing soup, so much flavor! Im still drooling..

loved it!  I doubled the recipe and used canned chicken, undrained, in place of the cooked chicken breast.  Also subbed 1% milk for half of the half-and-half, so the soup did need a little thickening with cornstarch.  Delicious!

Very bland!  I'm a beginner cook, and coming up with my own additions of spices etc is not easy for me.  I followed this recipe exactly, and it look just like the picture.  The concept is good but the flavor is lacking.  My husband wouldn't eat more than a few bites (he's a picky eater).

This soup is absolutely delicious. I made it just as written except I seasoned every thing with salt, pepper and garlic while cooking and it was plenty flavorful. We usually do not like cooked spinach but the whole family really enjoyed this soup with the spinach added. I used italian seasoned gnocchi from the freezer section of my grocery store. The kids topped theirs with a little shredded cheese. Thanks for the great recipe.

A nice recipe for a fall or winter night. I found it a little bland though, so I added some red pepper flakes for a kick. I would make this again, but i think next time I'd only add 1 cup of the half&half rather than 2.

This was good, I'll probably make again. I thought it had too much celery. I also had to cook it a bit longer than directions said for veggies to get tender. The kids loved it though!

Really tasty! Only change I'd make is next time I'm slicing the carrots instead of shredding. I didn't use the cornstarch water combo and it still thickened nicely.

One word...Awesome!  My store sells baby spinach in 9 oz bags so I used a whole one. Otherwise followed exactly and used the cornstarch slurry option.  Next time I think I'll try ff half and half to save some calories.  With the gnocchi and cornstarch I think it will be thick and rich even with ff half and half

My hubby actually made this for me one night after a long day of teaching kiddos.  It was just "alright" for us.  I read all of the reviews and was really excited, but for us it seemed to lack some flavor.  I might try this, again, but I'd have to add to it to brighten up the recipe for my family, I think.  (To be fair, I've never tried the restaurant recipe, but my hubby did.  He said that this one was lacking some flavor elements versus the restaurant one.)

Ingredients that we always use, how could we not love this soup? My toddler doesn't like "chunky" soups, so I chopped all the veggies in a food processor (except the spinach, which I thinly sliced into ribbons then added to the soup at the appropriate time). In lieu of chicken broth I used 2 bouillon cubes + 4 cups of water. I used 2 cans of chicken (I know... Leftovers from a fresh chicken would add great depth to this soup, but I wanted to try this and I had no chicken [it also wasn't on sale]). I did use the optional "slurry" to thicken the soup, as I do enjoy thick and rich soups. I didn't have any half&half so I opted for 1 1/4 cups of evaporated milk and 3/4 cup of 2% milk, still made it plenty creamy. The gnocchi were cooked to perfection, and my son was picking them out of my bowl because wanted more pasta ;) This will be made alot during the winter. I love that it is simple enough to eat any day of the week, but elegant enough to serve to company.

This soup is absolutely amazing and is nearly identical to the Chicken and Gnocchi soup at Olive Garden.  And it is even better the next day, if you can believe that!

Loved it.  I didn't have any celery so used some celery seed for flavor. I use the frozen gnocchi found in the freezer section, it's more like what you get at Olive Garden.

Delicious! I did use store bought gnocchi and I had meant to just buy a rotisserie chicken for this but I forgot so I ended up baking a couple of chicken breast. Instead of shredding the carrot I left in chunks...this soup was the perfect thickness and flavor! Thanks!

This is a go to for us and my family can’t get enough. I also have made it without the Half and Half & Corn Starch. In that instability added a can of diced tomatoes (drained). They loved that as well.

It was yummy and pretty easy it reminds me of Olive Gardens chicken soup I think there’s had gnocchi but it may be tortellini. I added some grated cheese (Asiago, Parmesan Romano and Provolone ) blend and black pepper at the end.

Really great recipe! Like many others, I did my own edits. I did my chicken in the Instapot first (instructions aren't included because there are so many models). Then I reduced the vegetables, I just did 1/2 a carrot and 1 celery stalk- my husband doesn't like veggies too much. I also did double the cream, so four cups total instead of 2 cups. (in the original recipe, it's half and half but real cream helps a lot in my opinion). Also added garlic salt, fresh rosemary, celery salt, salt, pepper, and parm cheese to taste. Really yummy! Will make again!

keep the thickness to your desired level with chicken stock. great to substitute with your Cream of Something soup mix, extra sliced mushroom and a healthy bolus of white wine.  very forgiving and flexible soup.

i am serving it tonight with fresh cheddar garlic biscuits, a green salad and a glass of wine. delicious...

It was ok. 2 out of 3 kids ate it right up. This was the first time I've ever used gnocchi. I think you'd need to find your perfect brand. The soup itself was too bland, I don't like to use a lot of salt, so this is going to take some adjusting

This recipe is perfect as is and I'm confident you will love it without making changes. I only made changes based on other reviews and using what I had on hand for a few ingredients. I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey and homemade chicken bone broth. Didn't have half and half so I used heavy whipping cream...so I also skipped the roux knowing it would be thicker. I did add some seasonings (salt, pepper, thyme) and I did chop my gnocchi up. My family devoured it with baguettes. This is the most comforting comfort food ever!

Definitely lacking taste, obviously the salt and pepper help but adding thyme and rosemary make this soooo good. I also use spicy sausage instead of chicken and kale instead of spinach. Delicious!

It's delicious. I did a few things differently. I double the recipe and add 2 tsp of thyme, 1tsp sage, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp paprika and I add those when I add the chicken broth in. I couldn't find mini gnocchi so I got regular vacuum sealed gnocchi and cut them in half. I chop the baby spinach up a bit so it's not long and stringy. I add shredded parmesan to the bowls after serving and make garlic French bread to go with it. 1000x better than olive garden's.

I was looking for something wholesome and filling, and this definitely fit the bill. The recipe is quite easy, and substitutions weren't a problem. I opted for more broth (more soup consistency than stew), used heavy cream instead of half-and-half, and tossed in a couple teaspoons of curry powder for some extra flavor. It worked out really well. I made enough for leftovers for a few days, and it kept getting better with age. I'll definitely make it again, perhaps with coconut milk.

Didn’t have gnocchi so substituted egg noodles. Added 1% milk instead of 1/2-1/2. Great recipe. Was promoted from “test and experiments” to a favorite soup.

I cooked this for my family. The only difference is I boiled chicken thighs and used the broth from that for my soup. I also put the gnocchi in last since it only takes 3-5 minutes for them to cook. It came out great!  I will be making this again.

Really good and hearty soup.  I like soups that aren't over seasoned where you lose the flavors of the vegetables.

I liked this soup as it was easy to make. For those of you in a hurry I made some changes which turned out quite satisfying. For this soup I relied on some canned goods. I used canned chicken, Costco has a great kind and also 2 cans of evaporated milk instead of half and half as I had none. I also used chopped up kale as I love the texture in soups. Lastly I added 2 bay leaves while the soup was simmering. I did not not thicken the soup as the veggies did the job. I would definitely make this soup again!

I doubled the recipe except for the gnocchi and spinach. I added a teaspoon of thyme. I chopped the spinach as well. I used the corn starch. I used Italian grilled chicken from my freezer. Most of my crew liked it.

Really great soup!!! If you cant find gnocchi, it it SUPER EASY to make yourself! You probably already have the ingredients in your kitchen and allrecipes has some great simple recipes that really take this soup to the next level! Since it relies heavily on the flavors of the veggies and chicken, a home made gnocchi is PERFECT for this recipe! Another super easy delicious hack: Try buying a full rotisserie chicken.. just strip the meat and use the carcass and vegetable scraps to make your own chicken broth!  Home made stuff seriously makes it 1000x better!

This was the best soup I have made yet. I only changed one thing and used half of the fresh spinach and sliced it before adding. This recipe was super easy to make too.

This is a comforting, tasty ,and easy to make soup. The broth is very good, and the gnocchi makes it very filling. My entire family enjoyed this! I like putting spinach in soup-it's a sneaky way for me to get my family to eat it. :)

Easy and delicious! I sauteed the veggies in butter in my Instant Pot, added a tablespoon of flour, and then the other ingredients according to the recipe. I also used Italian seasoning and topped it off with some really tasty shredded asiago I had on hand.

This is delicious!  I have made this twice in two weeks.  The first time I made it as written, and it was almost like a stew.  Very delicious, but next time I added another cup of broth and 1/2 cup of half and half.  Quality of the gnocchi makes a difference too.

This made a wonderful Saturday night supper! I didn’t have any cooked chicken, so I made mini meatballs  (like in Italian Wedding Soup) and it was still wonderful. I’m going to make sure I have a rotisserie chicken the next time I make this. 
Personally, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with using substitutions when preparing a recipe. I have been cooking for over 40 years and sometimes you just have to adjust things to make it work.

I added extra spices - garlic powder, parsley, chili powder, red pepper flakes and paprika to give it a little more flavor.  Great soup on a cold, rainy, winter day.

The things I changed:  I didn’t use spinach because I didn’t have any. I also made this vegetarian by omitting the chicken and substituting vegetable broth for chicken broth. This was just OK. I didn’t like the shredded carrots; next time I will dice them instead. This did need more flavor besides garlic, onions, salt and pepper. Even though I do like cream soups, I think this one would have been better with just broth.

I followed the recipe as written except used evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream, as suggested by another, and the soup was delicious!  I thought it might not have enough liquids, but the finished product was just right, I will definitely make this again.

I put in more onion, carrots, celery and spinach than the recipe called for because I love veggies. I used frozen spinach because I had lots of it in the freezer. I baked boneless, skinless chicken breast with Italian seasoning and probably had 25% more than the recipe called for. I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper at the end.

I been using this recipes a lot, but I did change it a bit I added Italian seasoning  for a little bit of flavor. I usually add it to my taste so I don't know how much I use so I would say till it taste fine to your liking. Instead of adding cornstarch and water I use Italian breadcrumbs to thicken it. Again I don't know how much I use, but use it to your liking of how thick you want your soup.

the 1st time making this I followed the recipe exactly. I found it exceptionally bland, and the taste of the celery was overwhelming. overall I personally found it inedible. Cut to 3rd 4th time making it. I cheat and use a rotisserie chkn from Walmart. wonderfully seasoned, fall of the bone tender and the perfect amount of meat. not much effort taking it apart and shredding it. all for under $5. add it at the absolute end right before serving.  i find most recipes on here cook meat to death and nothing ruins meat more than it being overcooked.  I completely omitted the celery, it adds nothing to the recipe. the first time making it there was a severe lack of "something" I couldn't figure out, but eventually came to the conclusion it needed parmesan cheese, and bad! putting it all together, I added just plain grated parmesan and Romano cheese blend to my personal taste. if using a rotisserie chicken, you can boil the skin in the soup for a few mins and it really amps up the flavor.

I ended up adding about 2 tsp of salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. I also added a little chicken bullion. I substituted 1 cup  of cream for 1 cup of half and half. I also added a few shakes of 21 season solute from Trader Joe's. And a tiny pinch of both thyme and nutmeg and the flavor was awesome!

Excellent.  Added a little freshly grated nutmeg and that brings out even more flavors.  Try with bone!see skinless thighs.  That's an excellent substitution that we like too.

This is really good.  I used regular milk to cut some of the calories.  I thought that it had too much spinach.

I really liked this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was thinly slice the carrots on the bias rather than shred them.  Otherwise, everything else worked out perfectly.

The only thing I would change is using chicken breast instead of thighs! Other than this, the recipe was spot on and super delicious.  I added a little more than 4 cups of chicken broth and also a little butter in addition to the olive oil. 10/10 would recommend this recipe for those chilly Fall days coming up!!

This recipe turned out phenomenally.  I did not make any changes.  As a matter of fact,  a relative of mine ordered soup by the same name at a popular Italian restaurant (chain),  and she said that this was sooo much better.  I even made my gnocchi from scratch which was pretty easy and turned out tender and delicious.  I will make this again very soon.

I cannot say enough about this soup. So delicious and elegant, yet so easy. I lightened it up by using 2% milk instead of cream and also used gluten free gnocchi. This recipe is definitely a keeper, the whole family enjoyed it.

Tastes just like Olive Garden’s Gnocchi Soup! I added 2 c of chicken broth to thin it out a little & subbed arrowroot for cornstarch.

First time making this, and I followed recipe as is to see what if any alterations I'd make the next time.  The chicken/gnocchi soup at Olive Garden is one of my favorites.  This recipe comes pretty close to OG.   I did play with the cornstarch measurments just a tad as at first it didn't seem to thicken up at all.  I don't see making any drastic changes.  We have a local supermarket that sells frozen gnocchi from local italian restaurants so I might try those vs. the ones I picked up this time.  But that's about the extent of any changes for me.

What a easy meal to make, the Gnocchi was the hardest item to find but that task was accomplished! My go to cooking tool is the slow-cooker and it worked great for this dinner. Add a little cilantro and it becomes a “southwest” treat!

I use chicken in a pouch (like tuna) is softer. I tried a heavy cream too... It wasn't as good. half and half is the way to go.

Also chop the onions up extra tiny or it screws up the texture.

This is a wonderful recipe. I hate getting recipes that people rate 4 stars but add a dozen new things to the recipe. Rating the recipe on its own I would rate it a 3.5. It is good but almost lacks a bit of flavor. I would recommend adding the thickener if you like a thicker soup and if you do not the soup is more broth like then creamy. 

HOWEVER, I made this soup three times and by the second time I found that the key ingredient that made me want to make it for a third time was adding about a cup of Parmesan cheese (i used the bottle kind). This not only added more flavor it even helped to make it a bit thicker. I absolutely love this soup with the cheese and even prefer it then getting it at olive garden. That is just my opinion. Rating this recipe with the cheese I would rate it five stars based on my personal taste. The family loves it. 

A single recipe fed about 4 people (2 decent sized bowls per person). I like left overs so I like to make 2 servings of this recipe to have leftovers. I hope this review helps!

The sauce was great. I would use these ratio's again in something else. I discovered I don't care for gnocchi. I would of liked more veggies in it.

I made some chicken with my sous vide, as I didn’t have any leftover cooked chicken, threw it in with some garlic pepper and lemon slices. Made the recipe as is, with the exception of adding sherry wine when the veggies were finishing cooking, and then a dash or two of nutmeg and cayenne pepper after adding the cream. Soup was delicious!!

This looked so good I made it on a hot Texas summer day. I made it as the recipe called for using leftover grilled chicken from the night before. I used the cornstarch but it was already thickening nicely. I could have gone without. It was very tasty. I’ll make it again too in cooler weather. Yum!

I love this soup. I am not a fan of celery, so I substitute dried celery flakes. It doesn’t change the flavor. The creamy broth is excellent.

I felt inspired to try to make this soup after finding potato gnocchi at my local dollar store.  I made this exactly as it is in the recipe. It was a big hit! Everybody LOVED it. I served it with some New York brand bread sticks from the frozen aisle in the grocery store..and everyone thought they were at Olive Garden.
Thanks so much for posting this recipe!! It is a keeper and I will definitely be making it again soon.

This turned out great. The house filled with a wonderful aroma while cooking. I only used one cup of fat free half/half cream because my husband isn’t a huge fan of creamy soups. Still tasted good and had a nice consistency. I also let the chicken steam with the veggies for a min before adding broth to allow the flavor to infuse the veggies. I would even consider trying it without the cream/cornstarch for a lighter, healthier soup.

I often make it with turkey cutlets (diced). It’s definitely in our rotation especially since it can be a slow cooker and is a meal in itself. Love it!!!

I used turkey sausage, zucchini-3 small, and one teaspoon thyme, 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk, and and extra cup of water. The rest of the ingredients are the same, except I chopped the carrots small instead of shredding and cooked veggies longer, and used half the spinach - chopped.

Made this 2 times.  Followed recipe except used tortellini in place of gnocchi and less cream.  Family doesn't like gnocchi so used tortellini and they loved it.  A keeper and will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

My family loves the soup. They compared it to the Olive Garden soup...but claimed “mom’s” was better. Definitely will make again.

I was excited to make this soup on a rainy night. We absolutely LOVED it! I made it exactly as listed, but added a pinch of some dried oregano and cooked my chicken with some minced garlic. So easy, so quick and sooo yummy. I will no longer be able to order this soup at the restaurant because this one is a million times better.

This turned out great. I used what I had in the house - my homemade, frozen gnocchi, fat free half and half. I feel like it could have been thicker, full fat half and half would likely accomplish that. I left it in the crock pot while we went for a bike ride. It was perfect to warm up with, but the gnocchi got a little mushy!

I made this last night for my family. It gets 5 stars in the easy department. This soup is very rich. The flavor was delicious but I would add less cream next time. I followed the recipe exactly aside from leaving out the spinach (because I didn't have any).

Great soup but I made adjustments. I’ve been craving chicken gnocchi soup for the last few weeks. I tried a different recipe a week ago and it was HORRIBLE. So of course my craving was never satisfied. I was a bit nervous trying again but I am SO glad I did. After reading a few reviews I made some adjustments. I used half heavy cream and half & half, I also used chicken stock instead of chicken broth, I omitted the cornstarch and I used a seasoned rotisserie chicken from the store to save time. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of thyme and garlic powder. I know that seems like it’s too many changes but it was perfect. I worked at Olivie garden and with these adjustments it was almost spot on!!!

This recipe is my favorite but I made minor changes and it really came out how I ate it at the Olive Garden . Here is what I modified:
- for chicken I used the drumsticks , which i previously cooked in the oven seasoned for about half an hour, then crumbled the meat part into the little pieces
- I used cream instead of half-and-half, so i wouldn't have to use the cornstarch ( if you wait about 1-2 hours before serving , the soup becomes very creamy)

 Enjoy!

Love the recipe, but a little extra of your favorite spices helps make it perfect.

What I do to make it better is to throw in the meat from a flavorful rotisserie chicken and I experiment with some of the unique spic blends I've accumulated over the years. Makes it more fun.

I used home made chicken stock and i thought it tasted too much like chicken soup. However, i had it the following day and it tasted just like the soup we always order at Olive Garden, which is my favorite! Yum!

Yummy!! Made as written but without the optional cornstarch. It was thick enough for us without it. I will add a little red pepper flakes next time, though.

It was delicious but I didn’t have any chicken broth so I took the Chicken breast, cut them up, boiling the in the water making broth with the Chicken. I didn’t have any fresh spinach, so I used canned. With the changes it was still great.

Made this per the recipe and the kids and I loved it! I used the optional corn starch. This recipe came very close to the OG. Next time I'll add a tad of thyme and nutmeg, but I like trying a recipe as written first.

My husband gets this soup at Olive Garden every time we go there so I thought I'd try this recipe. It was very good and I didn't think it lacked flavor like a few others did. I did use the homemade gnocchi as one other added ( 1 c mashed potatoes, 1 c flour, salt) they were very easy to make. Next time I would make them a little bigger as they got lost in the soup. My 19 yr old son asked what was the green stuff and I said idk !! He put hot sauce ( hot sauce goes on everything) in his soup and no complaints after we were done with dinner and I told him spinach!  I made the veggies, chicken and broth and let simmer for a few hours until ready to eat the added gnocchi, spinich and half & half. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Quick and easy soup! I did modify a bit- added 2 tbs of butter, 1/2 cup shredded Asiago cheese, 1 TBs of garlic powder, lots of kosher salt and Penzeys Bavarian seasoning (mix of brown mustard, rosemary, garlic, thyme, bay leaves and sage).I used dellano gluten free gnocchi. It was delicious!

So delicious, and so easy!  I am gluten-free, and this satisfied all cravings for chicken and dumplings!  I used a small rotisserie chicken and cut up all of it.  I used gluten-free gnocchi (most gnocchi is gluten-free), and instead of using cornstarch to thicken it, I used all-purpose gluten-free flour.  I also only used one cup of half and half, and it was perfect.  My kids loved it.

I've made it exactly as written and also left out spinach because I had none and I also substituted half and half for evaporated milk because that's what I had on hand.  It was delicious both times.  It's a new favorite of my family.

This recipe turned out better than you get at Olive Garden. The only thing I will change the next time I make it is to cut up the baby spinach leaves in fourths before adding to the soup so it isn't real long when you serve   it.

Followed the recipe exactly, except for adding seasonings (thyme, basil, a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, capful of Dale's seasoning, salt & pepper) and this was great! Very good. Thick and hearty. Will make again throughout the cold weather this winter. Thank you for an awesome recipe :)

Followed directions more precisely than usual, but substituted half and half for evaporated milk, no water or cornstarch were used. This was rich and creamy and really lovely soup for a cold winter day. It was filling and all enjoyed with even the youngest having second helpings. Very good recipe.

So Yummy! I actually doubled the chicken ((in order to make soup more acceptable as a "meal" to my husband)) and it was totally fine, but resulted in more of a stew consistency because of the amount of chicken! Also, I added the raw cubed chicken in first and sprinkled some Cavender's in with it, helping to season the chicken a bit!

Delicious but salty. 
I cut the additional salt off the bat, and maybe it's just the chicken stock I used, but this dish was overly salty. Maybe try using low sodium stock or even cutting the stock used. I also only used 1 cup half and half and used another 1 cup 2% milk and cubed my carrots, which added just the right amount of bite. 
Very good, great for cold winter nights. I can't wait to make it again!

We weren't "Wowed" by the recipe. It was lacking something, couldn't quite put my finger on it. I did add thyme like some people said and I liked it but my husband didn't. I think for me the gnocchi not being from the refrigerator section or homemade is why I wasn't fond of the recipe. 3 Stars because the liquid came together beautifully and I'm having leftovers tomorrow (I spent an hour preparing this and $30 on ingredients. I will force myself to finish it haha). 2 less stars because my husband disliked it entirely and seasonings should have been listed but they weren't.

Simple soup with the gnocchi giving it a different texture.  Pretty good, but if I'm going to make a chicken soup, I'd rather have dumplings, rice, or noodles.  Just my preference.

Have been using this recipe for years, I use milk as opposed to half and half to cut down on fat. And homemade gnocchi really takes it to a new place!

I make a roux once vegetables are cooked with approx  1/4 cup flour instead of using corn startch, put in broth with gnocchi until its done, then add cream rather than 1/2 and 1/2.
Love this soup.

I had leftover cooked chicken that I was looking for a recipe for when I found this. It is sooo good I cooked it exactly as written. Usually if we have leftovers we end up tossing them but I will eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner! Didn't think it was "too bland". Next time I might use less onion. I just don't care for the taste of it. Thank you!

We LOVE this soup! We used shallots instead of onions and frozen spinach instead of fresh (because that's what we had on hand); added the spinach before the gnocchi so it could defrost and come back to a simmer. Skipped the step with cornstarch and don't miss it a bit--nicely thick and creamy with just the half-and-half.

I make the soup exactly as the recipe states. I have made this soup several times now and we love it. My husband doesn't like boiled chicken ( from cleaning chickens in his child hood ),  but he does like this soup very much. I will make it again and again. I  want to make it for game night with friends. Don't change anything, it is perfect as written.

I didn't cook the chicken first, instead sautéed it with the veggies and simmered it for a few extra minutes until done. I used kale instead of spinach for the extra crunch and milk instead of Half and half for a few fewer calories. It turned out perfectly!

It worked! I added cilantro and more spices and everyone loved it. I'll definitely make it again but I'll use rotisserie chicken next time and more vegetables.

Not enough flavor. Next time I'd also not use the oil and would use milk rather than half and half.

I made this recipe for my family and it was simply excellent. I tastes better than the soup at Olive Garden. I was wanting to have the Olive Garden soup and then it was emailed to me. How wonderful is that! I did not change anything about the recipe. What really impressed me was my son ate it and he usually will not touch anything that has green vegetables in it. What a way to get spinach into him. It is a keeper.

This was AMAZING! I used rotisserie chicken, 1tsp of chicken bouillon base (friend who is a chef at Olive Garden told me they use this in theirs), I used half the onion and about a handful of spinach. It was just like Olive Gardens...maybe even better! I will definitely be making this again and again!!

Good soup. I'm usually not one for cream based soups, but this one was good. What I liked the most was how easy it was to throw this one together and presto! Soup is served. Also I'm not a big fan of frozen veggies, or store bought gnocchi. But like i said, quick, easy, and done.

This is a great recipe so make a double batch. You'll be glad you did. I used one rotisserie chicken and thinly sliced whole carrots instead of shredded. For the liquids, I used 9 c broth and only 2 cups half n' half. This kept it plenty thick so I skipped the cornstarch. I also added 1 T dried thyme as some have suggested. Pure deliciousness!

This was easy, healthy and delicious with a few modifications. I omitted cornstarch. I added a t. of thyme and cayenne pepper for more flavour (will add nutmeg next time and add spices to veggies to infuse more flavour.) I substituted whole milk for half and half, and cheese tortellini for gnocchi (which I cooked separately and added at the end.) I also used canned chicken from Costco and garnished with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Great winter dinner.

I used some leftover turkey in place of the chicken.  I added more carrots and celery too.  In place of half & half, i used skim milk with a bit of cream that needed using.  I like using the mini gnocchi!  Instead of normal sized one.  Enjoy!

Used whole milk instead of cream to save on calories.  Even cut back a bit on flour and it was still thick enough.  (also  used 2 cans of broth)
I didn't have gnocchi so I used frozen spaetzel and I liked it even better than the gnocchi.  They are smaller than gnocchi and more dense.
Thanks for the  recipe.

Instead  of spinach I use fresh cut basil.  Very aromatic!  I always add more chicken than called for, so I increase the chicken broth by 2 cups.

This recipe was so easy to make and is so delicious. I made it twice and both times it came out great! I lightened my second round by not adding cornstarch. I also chopped my chicken after it was cooked so the pieces were smaller for my kids to enjoy. So delicious!!

Delicious! I unfortunately couldn't find gnocchi in my store...fresh, frozen, or refrigerated...so I used mini tortellini instead and it was very yummy.  Very flavorful and  creamy. Definitely will be making again all Winter!

This soup is SO good! And it is even better the second day. I made it exactly as the recipe is written minus the chicken because I prefer no meat but it would be just as good with it. Going in my recipe book for sure!

This soup is delious. I roasted 2 bone in chicken breast (I had extra time) along with garlic and onion, rosemary. I used one cup of evaporated milk, one cup half & half.  As well as amount indicated with chicken stock. Also added 2 tablespoon butter. This made it so rich added bonus to the flavors.  Thank you.

I made this a few day ago when it was raining. My son says to my "Ok mom where is the Olive Garden containers. I know you didn't make this" This dish is perfect for those colds days.

This was really good!  Like the one at Olive Garden.  I followed the recipe pretty close other than using 1 cup heavy whipping cream instead of 2 cups half/half.  I didn't have spinach on hand  so had to omit that but would add it next time.  I cooked the chicken breast separately with some poultry seasoning and water then diced it and added it to the soup.  Used frozen gnocchi.  4/1/19 Easiest way to make this is by de-boning a rotisserie chicken (I like Costco's).  Shelf stable mini gnocci verses frozen work well too. I always have matchstick carrots on hand to toss into salads and soup and use them in this recipe too, I use spinach if I have it on hand or plan to use it in another recipe otherwise the remainder of it goes to waste in our house.

I sliced baby carrots because that's what I had in the fridge and shredding those little guys is no fun. Also,I skipped the starch. Next time I'll save a few calories and do half skim milk and half half n half and update my review. Didn't add any more salt either. My girls loved it and so did I!

This recipe is very bland. I made one from another site and it is wonderful. The cornstarch would not be necessary if you made a roux in the beginning. Also, my other recipe includes nutmeg, thyme and parsley and is perfect. Keep looking you will be disappointed in this one.

Thanks for this recipe.  Great for  a rainy day football meal.  I poached my boneless breasts with rosemary,  a little brandy and garden veggies and used the stock for the soup.  Picked from my garden some late season Swiss chard and kale instead of spinach and did a rough chop per another cook's suggestion.  Also used leeks and onions. Liked the suggestion for additional herbs so I used smokey paprika, thyme and sage along with Parmesan gnocchi.

Really tasty! I followed the recipe as-is with just two small changes - 1, I added some poultry seasoning since I love that sage flavor with "chicken and dumplings" (which this reminds me of!) and 2, I used kale instead of spinach which is a personal preference. Turned out great and was super hearty and filling.

I make this recipe on a monthly basis. BUT I do add a lot of my own seasoning, otherwise its pretty bland(the reason for my 4 stars). I season the vegatables with Natures Seasoning, thyme, sea salt and a dash of nutmeg. The end result is flawless! ;]

I agree with other posts that this was very bland.  I had to add a lot of seasoning  (Emeril's Essence, chicken soup starter, tons of pepper and some salt--basically anything) after the  soup was cooked completely so it had some flavor.  I used Costco rotisserie chicken which has spices cooked in, but that wasn't enough.  Won't be making this again.

Recipe was great- which is saying something because I'm not a great cook. I used frozen gnocchi based on some internet reviews. The gnocchi was definitely the weak point for my family. I'm either going to have to learn how to make the gnocchi myself (disastrous results last time I tried) or find an Italian deli in town that sells fresh gnocchi.

This is a perfect soup for beginners because it's very easy and quick if you just follow the instructions. It's so tasty. The only changes I made was I added nutmeg to the recipe because it's a geat flavor with spinach and cream. Also I used frozen mirepoix mixture made up of the onion, celery and carrot to avoid having to do all the veg prep on a weeknight.

Awesome recipe! A new family favorite!!! Even my daughter's boyfriend said..."this needs to be cooked again!" I followed the directions pretty close. I'm kind a guesstimater on things.  I doubled the recipe. Just used a box of broth ... a couple large chicken breast....etc. it was awesome!

I didn't use celery just because I'm not that fond of it. I did use peas though and that turned out well. I also used mostly frozen veggies, with only the onion and the garlic being fresh, since I'm a college student living on a budget. Even with using frozen chicken and veggies, it still turned out very well. Yummy recipie!

Made exactly as directed and I loved it. My wife wasn't a big fan of the gnocchi but thought the soup was great. Next time I may substitute some pasta shells for the gnocchi, or do both so we can both get what we want.

I love this recipe.  I make two changes that I think are very important.  I add diced fresh rosemary to the vegetables, and I use real cream instead of half and half.   Also I season at the end with a bit of Aldi's seasoned salt.

If I don't have gnocchi, I use egg noodles, and sometimes homemade egg noodles.  Delicious either way!  Thanks!

So…this soup reminded me so much of my favorite Paula Deen “Lady and Son’s Chicken Noodle Soup” that I adapted this recipe to work alongside hers.  To this recipe, I added 1 bay leaf, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and 1 teaspoon lemon pepper as seasonings, along with a little extra salt and pepper.  I omitted the water/corn starch and added only ¾ quarter cup half and half (instead of 2 cups) and about 2 tablespoons sherry at the end.  The soup was thick, rich, and so flavorful!

great recipe. I try not to make changes, but we are on a gluten & dairy free diet. So the gnocchi was perfect but we replaced the cream with almond milk and kept in the corn starch as thickener. To save time on the weeknight, we also just added the raw chicken to the veggies, and cooked them for an extra 15 min in the broth before adding the gnocchi etc.
It worked out well and this is going to become a staple in our house.

Good and easy to make, lacked a little flavor so I added some parmesan cheese to it.  Also cooking the veggies a little longer could have helped the flavor.

I make this frequently and agree that some extra seasoning helps.  Also if I don't have leftover chicken, I add it raw and boil a bit longer.  Easier and less chewy than basically boiling already cooked chicken.

The recipe  I use most often has dried parsley and ground thyme . The thyme is what gives it the flavor  that is most like Olive Gardens . I sauté onions, celery, garlic and shredded carrots in half butter and olive oil (more flavor) This soup is not low cal but delicious

I am a bit embarrassed about HOW and WHY I found this recipe . . . I had just finished eating my bowl of chicken gnocchi soup at Olive Garden and said to my husband, "I wonder how hard it would be to make this at home." Well, right there at the table, I looked on Allrecipes. Although there are several to choose from on the site, this one seemed healthiest and had the least fat. Is it as "good" as Olive Garden's? I'd say "different but equal in taste", and superior in healthful ingredients.

I made a few minor changes to this recipe. Like other reviewers, i didn't add the corn starch and water. I used pre shredded carrots. I don't use carrots very much, so i got a small bag of this so that I could use it in this recipe. I used around 3 ounces of shredded carrot, I also threw the chicken in raw. Forgot to fully read everything before I started, and didn't realize it needed to be cooked first. Once I realized I just let the chicken sit and cook before throwing in the rest of the stuff. Threw in the rest of the stuff and then also added McCormick Montreal steak seasoning, both the spicy and normal ones, some dried parsley, garlic salt, and some chicken bouillon. Let it all cook until it was somewhat thick. It's super good with the additions of the chicken bouillon and the other seasonings. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

I love this soup it's really great especially on a cold winter day, but I found the amounts of broth and half and half to not work with the amount of solid ingredients. I ended up using 6 cups of chicken broth and over 3 cups of half and half. I also added fresh thyme and rosemary to the soup and a bit of grated Parmesan cheese. Even without the extra spices it's still good.

My youngest daughter, on leave from the Navy, made this with me. We loved it! We left out the celery because she doesn't like it. We used fat-free half and half; did not use the cornstarch because it was thick enough. It was wonderful!

I used chicken thighs and homemade gnocchi. This is a rich and delicious soup.

"It was delish," says my granddaughter.  Everyone had seconds.  Maybe not quite as good as Olive Garden's, but still pretty tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!  Only change I made was omitting the celery, because I forgot to buy some.

This is a huge hit at our house.  I used the chicken tenders and seasoned and baked them as Christina suggested in her footnote.  Near the end of cooking when I tasted, I wanted a little more "chicken-y" flavor so I added some chicken bouillon.  Other than that, no changes to the recipe.  We have it frequently during the winter.  Thanks for sharing.

I don't know how much of a difference it made but instead of 2 cups of half and half I used 1 cup of milk and one cup of heavy cream. It was definitely a hit in our family and will make it again!!

This is very good, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs a few more seasonings. I also added thyme and nutmeg, as suggested, and was quite happy with how it came out. I also roughly chopped the spinach so there weren't big pieces.  If you want to make it in a budget friendly way you can use the leftover meat from a roasted chicken (I pick them up from the deli for $8 and get a meal and then soup) and make your own chicken stock.  It's just as good, doesn't take any longer as I made the stock while chopping and cooking the veggies, and healthier because it let's you control the salt.

Didn't need the cornstarch slurry as the soup thickens when the gnocchi cooks in the broth and then the cream puts some liquid back in.  Didn't use a whole pint of 1/2 & 1/2, closer to 1 1/2 c.  Instead of store bought gnocchi I made the Ricotta Gnocchi also on this site, which is very flavorful.

I went almost exactly by the direction, just didn't add celery. This soup was so flavorful, I didn't have to add any spices and will definitely make this again.  I did roast the chicken the day before so making the soup went fairly quickly after work when I don't have a lot of time.

I noticed that the soup thickens up quite a bit after  a while, so I added one less tablespoon of corn starch. I also added in some lemon zest, white wine (Barefoot Moscato), grated Parmesan cheese (while cooking and some more after serving), and some fresh basil leaves from the garden. Everyone absolutely loved it. Great recipe, especially to warm up on a cold, winter day! ?

I used gluten-free gnocchi.  I also used 1 can of evaporated milk instead of half-and-half.  For more flavor, I sauteed the onion, garlic ( which I always double up on), carrots, and celery in bacon drippings...you could always go with the grapeseed oil for a healthier version.  I also cut up the bacon and stirred it in with the chicken ( rotisserie).  Delicious!!!

I thought I was at Olive Garden when eating this soup! Put some garlic bread in a little basket and enjoyed it thoroughly. Very good recipe, husband and I loved it and will be making it again! Although next time I wont use the cornstarch (I like my soups a bit soupier.)

This is quick,  easy to make and tastes great.  the only things I added were a little minced garlic, a dash of nutmeg and about a tsp of thyme.  You can adjust these to your own taste, but I think it makes the soup better.  Once its complete add parmesan to the top and enjoy!

Was excellent.   I added  basil and thyme to broth.  I always make my gnocchi from scratch.  To cut down on calories I  Used 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2 and 1 cup milk.  Also used low sodium broth.

Yum, yum, yum! Made this tonight for my husbands birthday and it was absolutely delish! Very nice and hearty for a cold Seattle night. I followed the recipe to an absolute 'T', aside from adding two additional cups of chicken broth. (I almost always double broth, because I just love a more broth-y soup, but I reduced to only adding two cups just to keep it from being too chunky, but still  nice and hearty!) It turned out just perfect. My husband stated it might need something to kick it up a little notch and bring out the WOW factor, so I think I may add a TOUCH of granulated chicken bullion next time and see how it helps bring out the underlying flavor without adding more sodium to the dish. Aside from that this recipe is wonderful and I cannot wait to make it again!

Made it exactly as directed except for no spinach since my husband doesn't care for it.  It was delicious and really not a difficult recipe to make.  I'm thinking for a budget recipe to just use diced potatoes but my husband really liked the gnocchi.  I'm going to make it for my dad when we visit him in a few weeks.

This soup is absolutely delicious on a cold winter day.  The gnocchi really makes it hearty.  I added turmeric to it only because I wanted more spice, but it is tasty without it.  Enjoy!

I  made a few minor adjustments and this soup was delicious! I'm sure it would have been great without these, but for the sake of recording: I too made a chicken stock with a rotisserie chicken. I used frozen spinach and grated a small apple into it ( just cause I had one I needed to get rid of). I added some thyme and a dash of nutmeg and curry.

I'm one of those people that like plain foods, partially because my stomach can not handle most spices. I used heavy whipping cream (because I put it in everything) and left out the onion, garlic and celery, because I can't eat those either. My family said it was one of the best soups I've made.

Delicious, only thing I would change is less carrot but I'm bias because I don't really like carrots.

very good soup, i made it as a x3 batch since i had over three pounds of boneless skinless thighs to use. i didn't add salt originally and found it to be really bland like that then added salt and voila.. tasted restaurant quality. tasted better after letting soup simmer on low heat for an hoour.. let the flavors blend better i think. I used baby kale spinach and extra virgin olive oil. I was very pleased with the finished product.

Excellent! did not add the corn starch and it was a perfect consistency. I did take the advice of another review and added thyme and paprika. I also seasoned my chicken, as my family likes flavor :-) Will definitely be making this recipe again- frequently!

The recipe is spot-on and would've been 5 stars except that it's missing one of the main spices---Nutmeg.  This has to be in there to achieve the true Chicken Gnocchi taste. I add it in at the end starting with about 1/2 tsp. Season to your liking. Enjoy??

I made the recipe as written with the optional cornstarch slurry. The only other change I made was using thinly sliced carrots instead of shredded, simply because it was easier. The flavor was delicious and the texture pretty good. Olive Garden's is much thicker and probably made with a roux. I prefer this, as it isn't quite so gloppy.

This was so quick and easy. My daughter and I LOVED the Chicken Gnocchi from Olive Garden, which is what brought me to this recipe.  I cooked my chicken with some oregano and basil, and I pureed the carrots to hide them from my younger children. I did also use the corn starch mixture and It was a huge hit at dinner last night.  Everyone went for multiple bowls. I made this as a side dish and I have NO left overs left!! That is a very rare occurrence in my home!

It was hearty.  Very creamy and smooth.  The flavor is a little lacking.  I had to punch up the herbs and seasonings to satisfy my taste buds.  But not bad overall.

This was deliciously comforting darn good soup. I didn't buy pre-cooked chicken though. I cooked my own with salt & paprika. I also replaced the 2 C half & half with 1 C heavy whipping cream. Delicious!!! (I also didn't use the cornstarch)

I'm really glad I doubled this recipe, now we have leftovers so I can have it again! I added thyme, McCormick Montreal chicken seasoning, and one bouillon cube. It was easy to put together, and we enjoyed it so much!

Soup was so delicious.   I did add my own seasoning plus extra veggies.  Diced up zucchinis and added button mushrooms. Did not need the cornstarch but did add more chicken.  Needless to say even the kids who don't eat their veggies asked for seconds.  Will definitely have to make a bigger batch next time.  Thank you so much.

Every time I make this rich, creamy, delicious soup, people beg for the recipe! For those who think it's bland, I found 1 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper to be just right. (I also like to add 1/2 tsp. ground turmeric, which imparts a lovely golden color and a subtle hint of flavor, but it's totally optional.) The cornstarch slurry does make for a very thick soup. If you find it gets too thick, and you prefer a thinner soup, skip or reduce the slurry. You can also thin a too-thick soup with more broth or milk. BTW, Trader Joe's carries potato gnocchi in the dry pasta section for a fraction of the cost of grocery story prices.

I made this tonight but did not have spinach or celery. I substituted celery salt and kale. Also, could not use what little 1/2 & 1/2 we coffee drinkers had left for morning. I used heavy whipping cream instead. Amazing.......Tasted just like my favorite restaurant version. Thank you for making me look good!

This was pretty good.  It's the first time for me using gnocchi in soup and I wasn't a big fan of it.  Next time I'll try using a big pasta.  But the flavor was pretty good.  I didn't use corn starch. I used a little flour dissolved in water to thicken.

This soup was so good that my husband loaded his thermos up with it and took it to work with him for his lunch (he was on night shifts). I got a text at 12:45 am raving again at how awesome this soup was. I'm beginning to wonder if the other mechanics are gonna get jealous from all the yummy foods he takes in lol.

I made the recipe as is except using a little less onion. This was not a great recipe. It could have used less spinach, or none. Due to the spinach it did not keep over night. I also like a thick soup but this was so thick it could hardly be called a soup. I thought I added a lot of garlic but alas , I could hardly tastes it had garlic in it. Will not make again.

This is a delicious hearty soup for a cold, winter night!  I didn't have half-n-half so I used a can of evaporated milk.  I substituted broccoli for the spinach, it was delicious!! The rosemary and nutmeg add a nice flavor!!

One of the best soups I've had! Definitely comparable to Olive Garden's version of the soup. The only differences I made was I added frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh, just because that is what I had on hand. And I increased the liquids in the soup by 1/2, just because I like a lot of broth in my soups. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly. Most definitely a keeper the entire family loved and I will make again and again! Thank you for submitting:)

Omitted the cornstarch but otherwise I have followed this recipe exactly for the last two years. This is my daughter's favorite meal that we make. She is only two and eats nearly as much as I do because it's that good!  I recommend this over nearly any other soup that I've ever had!

This recipe was a huge hit! I used leftover turkey instead of chicken and added kielbasa sausage for my picky eaters. I used the gnocchi from the pasta aisle and also used the cornstarch, but could have gone without it too! I will definitely make this again! So easy and has great flavor!

I love this recipe I used heavy cream which allows you to omit the cornstarch I also added thyme which certainly increases the flavor, and did not use a small onion I used a very large yellow onion which if you like onion (I love onion) enhances the flavors!

Easy to follow recipe! I added a little more gnocchi b/c I really like it, and a handful more of spinach.

I added a lot more garlic and some Italian seasoning (bit of onion powder too) but otherwise followed this recipe closely. A real winner, thanks!

Great soup.  I use regular sized Gnocchi and cut in half.  Also add a pinch of cayenne.

Very very good! I cooked the chicken the day before in the crock pot with one cup of chicken broth and onion. I used frozen onions and frozen spinach also.

this recipe was excellent, very simple to make and taste great.  I found that I added too much chicken( almost a whole bird) so I added more stock.  I did half milk and half heavy cream as I had some left over.  will make this again, found that you most definitely needs salt and pepper

THIS IS AMAZING. The only thing I did was I put the spinach in a food processor because i don't like the texture of cooked spinach and I didn't add the celery. but seriously, this soup is amazing, easy to make, and lasts for days.

This is superb. I put the chicken broth in pot added four chicken breasts because I had defrosted the whole package. I simmered till they were cooked through. I added pepper and garlic powder to the broth. Once chicken was cooked i  removed it and let cool. Once cooled I shredded 1 large chicken breast.  The other three breasts were refrigerated for another meal. I followed the rest of directions per recipe instructions. The only other ingredient I would add next time is some mushrooms which I didn't have on hand. Cooking the chicken in the broth really added to the flavor. I used chicken bullion cubes for broth as it's less expensive. I also used fat free half n half. This was excellent. Good enough to serve to company along with some crusty bread .

This is very good - just two of us, so cut down on ingredients (two chicken tenders was plenty) - used frozen spinach - added a few mushrooms, fresh basil, and whole baby carrots instead of shredded - it was rich and thickened with the cornstarch mixture -

I agree with some other reviewers this recipe lacks flavor. Thyme, salt and pepper added to the simmering broth/veggies makes all the difference. Pair with ciabatta rolls and asparagus and it makes a terrific meal

I like this recipe, but I did add some extra spices, salt, & garlic, but I must say I wouldn't have thought of using Gnocchi in a soup. Thanks for the great idea! Yummy

This was just ok for me.  I felt like the celery flavor ended up being pretty strong and I wasn't a fan of that.  Also I tore the spinach before adding it to the soup but chopping it fine would have worked better.

Great soup.  Left out the water and cornstarch.  Totally not needed as the soup is pretty thick without it.My crowd liked the flavor, but wasn't big on the gnocchi as it was not something we normally ate.  I tried getting the smaller ones (or cutting the regular ones in halves and quarters) and that helped some.  Lately, I have left them out all together and used cut-up flour tortillas instead.  It makes more of a chicken noodle/dumpling.  It turns out really good and my folks liked it better.  Not saying it is a better option, but just an alternative if you have picky eaters that may not like the gnocchi.  Either way, definitely a 5-star favorite!

Very good and superbly simple to make. My only changes were to add some thyme and to make a roux for thickening instead of the cornstarch. I have made this at home and at work and it is always a hit. Thank you for a great, go-to recipe!

Great recipe and wonderful comfort soup for a cold winter's day! We made the soup using only half of the amount of half n' half listed in the recipe. Also used dried gnocchi since I couldn't find refrigerated. Even our young children (who are sometimes picky eaters) emptied their bowls!

I really loved the sound of this but I was in the mood for seafood so I used the basics of the recipe and changed a couple things. I used 3/4 lb each of medium shrimp and sea scallops. Sautéed them after the vegetables. For the liquid I used about 2 cups of chicken broth and about 3 cups of shrimp broth (from the shrimp shells. I also used a combination of butter and olive oil to sauté everything and then added a couple tbs of flour to thicken rather than using the cornstarch method. Also added a bit of dry jerk seasoning and some grated nutmeg at the end.

This was a winner for my whole family. To cut down on calories and fat I used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup of skim milk. I used organic chicken broth and a shredded rotisserie chicken which gave it nice flavor. I did not thicken with corn starch as the starch from the gnocchi made it just right. I will add zucchini next time because we like it in our soups.

I enjoyed this soup and did make a few changes. I'm not vegetarian but am trying to eat less meat so I used chicken broth but not the chicken. Instead I added a can of chickpeas and a chopped zucchini along with the celery, onion, carrots, and spinach. I also added some Thyme. We're trying to go gluten free so I was lucky to find gluten free gnocchi. The soup was very comforting and nourishing on a blustery, cold winter day (and very substantial without the chicken).

this was the perfect meal on a cold December night...it was delicious, warm, and satisfying.  A big plus is that it doesn't need to simmer on the stove all day so you can make it last minute.  My boys are not fans of "creamy" soups but they each had two bowls of this one.  Thank you!

Was looking for a recipe to help use up turkey leftovers from Thanksgiving and this was perfect! (Or a "winner" as my 10 yr old called it!) The only changes I made (besides using turkey)were  sautéing the veggies in butter, and at the end I added one little container of Knorr concentrated chicken stock.  Wishing we had breadsticks and fresh grated parmesan on hand...but definitely will next time I make it!  Thanks for such a great recipe the whole family loved! Comfort food at its finest.

I used a whole rotisserie chicken and upped the pepper a little bit. Then I used 5 cups of low sodium chicken broth instead of 4.This is my families favorite soup!!! We make it once a week!

If you are looking for a wonderful, comforting soup - this is IT.  I used a shredded Rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and didn't use celery.  My husband wasn't too sure about this recipe at first, but he kept going back for more.  If I could give this 10 stars - I would! :)  Thank you Christina for posting this!  Comes mighty darn close to Olive Garden's soup that I LOVE!

Made it a little different than the original directions. I boiled the carrots, celery, onions and garlic in chicken broth then added chunky pieces of Rotisse chicken. Everything else I followed. I made grilled cheese sandwiches and it was fun to see my 15 year old dip it in the soup. He went back for  a second serving...not back for my picky eater. Thanks for sharing.

This is delightful. Obviously, seasoning is a personal preference.  I stuck with the recommended salt and pepper and that was a good choice for us.  It allowed the flavors of the soup to really shine through.  I only had large gnocchi so end up cutting it into quarters which was a good choice for this soup.  I also topped the soup with fresh grated paremesan at serving and I think that added a nice depth to the flavor.  This is warm and satisfying for cooler weather, but also unique enough to serve to company.  Very nice recipe!!

This is deserving of all its 5-star reviews and then some! Wow, is it good. 
I only had chipotle infused olive oil which is really spicy so I didn't want to use it in this recipe, so I used a pat of butter and a little canola oil in its place. I didn't use the cornstarch because I wasn't using fresh gnocchi (mine were from the pasta aisle), and I did let it simmer a little longer because of that. Doing this released more of the potato starch which makes the cornstarch unneccesary.
My whole family loved this!! Even though it does have very little seasoning, it wasn't bland in the least. It probably helped that I used leftover rotisserie chicken, plus the garlic, onions, and flavor from the veggies gave it such a delicious flavor. Definitely plan on making this a lot and making a double or triple batch next time so I can freeze for later crock-pot meal.

Really nice soup.  Didn't have spinach, so left it out, but still really nice flavour.  I used 2 tbsp. of flour rather than cornstarch to thicken the soup.  Added a bay leaf to the soup while simmering.

This is my new favorite soup! A great, easy recipe! I did not do the cornstarch & water part, I did add a few random spices including Thyme and paprika. I don't think that it really needed it, but the thyme was a nice extra. The leftovers were even great a few days later. The store bought gnocchi from the pasta aisle are fine, I bet it's amazing with homemade. :)

My daughter loves soup so much I made this in August. YUM! Must admit, after reading other reviews, I did make a few changes. One, I deglazed pot with a half cup of white wine then added chicken broth. Two, I did add maybe a half teaspoon of dried thyme. Three, I used fat free half n half. Four, I did add one extra cup of chicken broth so five cups broth total. A lovely soup anyone can fit to their own personal tastes. Thank you Christina!

Great soup! So as with most recipes I make I adjusted for taste and health. I cooked the chicken in the same pot after I cooked and removed the veggies and I added a salt free seasoning to the chicken for extra flavor. Then I followed the recipe except I only added 1/2c of half and half and mixed it w/ the cornstarch-that's all you really need and talk about cutting calories! Still very creamy and tasty!

This soup was wonderful. I left out the spinach as I had none in the house. I cut my gnocchi in half as suggested and used two cans of tyson canned breast of chicken, it was perfect and so quick to make. I ended up adding extra chicken broth because it was too thick the second day. I also added about two tsp or so of savory and quite a bit of pepper. Just added some crusty french rolls (from this sight) and dinner was served.

I didn't have celery so I put in some mushrooms that I had.  Other than that I followed the recipe without the cornstarch.  It turned out wonderful.  It wasn't really popular with the kids - but the hubby and I really liked it.

I didn't really like the gnocchi in this soup but maybe it was the gnocchi I bought.  I will definitely make this soup again but next time I will try replacing the gnocchi with barley.

I found this recipe while searching here for something to use up gnocchi and a box of spinach that I had to use up (trying to go this week with no more grocery purchases but rather whatever we have on hand). It's stellar...my family (3 college students/their friends and husband) all told me how wonderful dinner was and how good it tasted over and over. I doubled the recipe (I had two boxes of gnocchi and potential of several kids home tonight)...I poached a bit over 2 lbs of chicken breasts on the stove..I used that liquid plus 2 cans of purchased chicken broth for the doubled recipe. I could only find 2 stalks of celery in my frig...so I grabbed a zucchini to add filler...no fresh spinach so used a 10 oz frozen box. Using up fat free half and half, some whipping cream, and some skim...cleaning out the pantry never tasted so good. I'll save the recipe for times when I actually intend to make rather than use it as a miscellaneous kitchen pot...yum...(oh, and I cheated all the way...I pulsed the veggies in the food processor rather than cutting pretty...then I turned around and pulsed the chicken breasts..not so long it was mush but rather short stringey texture rather than cubed..apparently, no one cared as they all ate seconds.

I added frozen spinach instead of fresh, and did not want to add the cornstarch, and perhaps that made my broth watery. I thought that the end result was a bit bland, not savory enough for our tastes. I would recommend adding more garlic, as well as ample pepper and salt.

We love this soup!  Reading the ingredients, it doesn't seem like it would have a whole lotta flavor, but indeed it does!  Make sure you get the mini gnocchi and not the larger ones, because they are way too big for this delicate soup.  It is so yummy and even better the next day.  Use the entire amount of spinach, as well.  Enjoy!

Very good starting point.  I think in the future, I will chop up the spinach so it's not in such large chunks... Also, this didn't turn out as thick as I would've liked.  I think next time I'll do a roux.  Maybe add some rosemary.  Thanks!

We liked this, it's on the "keeper" list. I added a little more liquid but that seems to be common for me lately so I'm calling it personal preference. I made homemade squash gnocchi, evaporated milk for the cream and added the spinach at the end because we don't like it too cooked in soups. The shredded carrots were a nice touch that I have never used before.

We all really enjoyed this.  I could not find gnocchi anywhere!  Sad, because we love gnocci.  I wasn't really feeling up to the task of making homemade gnocchi, so I just opted to replace it with tortellini.  Skipped the celery and cornstarch slurry, but did thicken it with some tapioca flour.  Delicious!  Everyone gobbled it down, including my currently somewhat picky one-year-old.

This recipe gives you a great starting point, but I think it stops short. It begs for some fresh herbs, or perhaps a roasted chicken.

We loved this soup!!!  I added more celery and carrots, so I also added more broth.  So easy, and a great use of leftover chicken I had in the freezer.  Delicious, hearty, and comforting.  This will be added to our regular rotation.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was pretty darn good! I used only 2 stalks celery and one big carrot, and for some reason I could only find rice gnocchi at the store this time, so I used that. It was a different texture than the potato gnocchi, but worked fine for a soup. I skipped the cornstarch slurry as I prefer brothier soups, and the gnocchi made it thick enough for me anyway. I also used almost one cup heavy cream because I had it in my fridge, and added a splash of milk too. I didn't find it too bland, but I did add a fair amount of salt and pepper since there was no other spices. It was great for dipping crusty French bread in. I'd make this again. Even though I made it on a Sunday this time, it's quick enough for a weeknight with using leftover chicken.

The whole family loved it!  We have egg/dairy allergies with the kids, so made our own gnocchi using the quick gnocchi recipe, substituting egg replacer for the egg.  And used soy half and half.  But, as my picky 8 year old said, "1000 thumbs up"!

I thought this soup was AMAZING! I had tried a chicken gnocchi recipe a couple of years ago and bombed it, but this one was so good. I didn't eat it the first night I made it. I let the flavors soak in and ate it the next day. I can't believe how similar to Olive Garden this soup tastes!!!!! I am definitely going to make this again. I just used leftover turkey meat from a huge roast. I also didn't have all the broth the recipe called for so I added one can of cream of chicken soup and lots of water. I made the milk with flour since I didn't have any corn starch. I didn't completely follow the recipe because I never do. haha, especially not for soups. I used canned spinach because I didn't have any fresh. I can't say enough about how good this was. My boys loved it, too, because it tastes a lot like chicken noodle soup, except creamier. yum yum yum!

Lacks a tremendous amount of flavor! I added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, and grated 1/2 cup of gouda in order to add a smoky flavor. Make sure you season as you go, a little thyme, nutmeg, italian seasoning. After these changes, my husband loved it!

I have made variations of this recipe and my family LOVES it!  My daughter said that if she could only eat one thing for the next year, it would be "chicken ball soup"!  We like it best with the spinach (chopped) and without the carrots and celery.

I made this for supper tonight. I read most of the reviews and then decided what I wanted. Was in a hurry so slow simmer my chicken to precook in broth highly seasoned with salt, pepper, sage & thyme. Then started the veggies. Used the broth that I cooked my chicken in, added more sage thyme, basil and a pinch nutmeg. The soup was outstanding. Even my husband loved it. Said it was a nice change. Also, I didn't have enough half & half so used evaporated milk with about 1 Tbsp. of butter. It was excellent. I'm sure leftovers will be even better. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper.

This was a definite hit with everyone in the family. Served it with a multi-grain bread. Husband kept raving about it throughout the meal.  Skeptical teenager also enjoyed it though she did complain about the texture of the gnocchi upon first bite (didn't stop her from eating it).  We did not use the optional cornstarch- really seemed thick enough without it.  Took another reviewer's advice and added some thyme for extra flavor otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Used a "cheater" package of pre-cooked refrigerated chicken slices and chopped them up. Loved how this all came together so easily and with ingredients we usually have on hand.  This soup is going to be on regular rotation.

Excellent recipe. I used the cornstarch - we like a thicker soup. Definitely add fresh thyme - adds wonderful flavor. I used regular spinach with tough stems removed, then coarsely chopped. This is now a fall/winter mainstay in our meal inventory.

Christina, this soup is really the best!  I had never had gnocchi and learned about this recipe from lisa’s morning post, “What’s for dinner?”  I am so glad I copied someone’s suggestion of this soup.  I had never tried gnocchi, but had recently bought a package to make something with it.  This soup was a winner.  I loved all the fresh vegetables in this and thought the broth was loaded with flavor.  I gave a large bowl of this to a friend, who thought this was wonderful.  She texted me two nights in a row to exclaim how good this soup is.  She even asked for a copy of the recipe, which I thought was a great compliment to you.  We really enjoyed the gnocchi and I will be purchasing them again.  Thanks, Christina! :o)

Really enjoyed this.  Reminds me of the soup from Olive Garden.  The base of the soup would be dynamite for just about anything.  I can't wait to try more soups with it.

My husband liked it I thought it was okay. I think it woulda been better if I used fresh greens instead of frozen but I had some in my freezer and wanted to use them up. I also used turnup greens instead of spinach my husband doesn't like spinach. so I think if I changed the greens to fresh it'd be much better. I also seasoned my chicken in the oven and it added some more flavor and just added a few spices. I will prob be making this again but with fresh greens of course.

Don't know if I would say it is comparable to the OG version, but it is very easy and tasty. I omitted the cornstarch and water like others had suggested and the consistency was still great. Will definitely add this recipe to my box of favorites!

Delicious!!! I pretty much stuck to the recipe, but did add peppercorns and 1 chicken boullion cube, also, I made it early in the day so the flavors had time to meld.  We loved it, and still do, as it's great the next day or 2 as well:):)

This soup was both simple to prepare and delicious! It's the perfect comfort food for wintertime. Like most reviewers I omitted the cornstarch as it was thick enough. I bought a rotisserie chicken and used fat free half and half to cut down on calories, also topped with some shredded parmesan when serving and served with crusty Italian bread. I'm making again tonight and instead of paying for a rotisserie I put some chicken breasts in the slow cooker with some stock and seasonings.

Sooo good.  I sliced the carrots thin instead of shredding and added an extra 2 c of broth and little red pepper flake.  My husband loves gnocchi so I added an extra 1/2 bag.  Delicious.  Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

I was looking for a recipe that would compare to Olive Garden's soup and this is it.  Maybe even better!  To make it easier and quicker, I used two cans of chicken chunks.  It was perfect.  It is exactly six (small) servings, so I'd suggest doubling it.

My family absolutely loves this soup!  I have made it several times, and omit the corn starch as others have.  It pleases hubby and all four kids, you know it's a keeper when everyone agrees.  I am making it again tonight to warm the family after a long wet, cold football practice.  It's so good that the kids even think mom's is better than Olive Garden's!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe and my niece loves it. I added a can of diced tomatoes and didn't use the cornstarch or water. Easy to make and it makes a lot.

i used this recipe for my base.  if you want to kick it up a little, first when making your gnocchis, i used package potatoes with garlic and herb flavor and also i used a cup of chardonay, or one serving bottles of wine.  Instead of cornstarch in the beginning when cooking the vegies, i add two tbls of flour and make a light rue.  it thickens up great

Prepared this with the recipe for Quick Gnocchi.  Loved it, though I left mine on the stove for a bit too long, it burned the bottom of my pot. But overall was a great meal. My gf loved the soup and variety of veggies I added just because.

We loved this recipe! Easy, quick. We made it with no alterations on the first try. Found it was flavorful. Used the whole package of frozen grocery store plain gnocchi. Will reduce to half. Great the second day, too. Fantastic recipe. THANKS

GREAT recipe!!  This will definitely be a regular for my household!  I like this version better than Olive Garden's because this is chalk full of stuff - the way soup should be.  I used about a cup and a half of heavy whipping cream (half of it already whipped) because that's what I had, a rotisserie chicken, and I added thyme as others suggested.  I'm anxious to try a lower calorie version, but still...Fabulous!

This is absolutely yummy.
I used chicken thighs , chopped and browned first before veggies.  Rough chopped all veggies, adding a bit more, added a little more garlic, used frozen spinach and changed out milk for cream to reduce fat and calories.
Hearty comfort food....delish....thanks for sharing!

sooooooo very yummy!  I make this soup for all my teenagers and they love it love it.  There is never any left.  The only variation I've done is add green onions and last night I used milk because I didn't have any half and half..  Still super yummy!

I really liked this recipe.  I did make a few alterations to cut the fat. I used 1 cup of fat free half and half, and added potato flakes to make the soup richer.  I also added some nutmeg, and some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch. Thanks!

This soup is very good.  I substituted 2 large cans of chicken that I shredded. For the broth and garlic I used 1 can of chicken broth with roasted garlic and 1 can of regular broth.  I did not have baby spinach so I cut up some regular spinach.  I used less half and half and omitted the cornstarch.  I also cut up regular size gnocchi.

It was very bland, even though I added Italian seasoning to it. The texture was fine, so I think I just need to play around with different spices if I try this again.

This is a wonderful soup.  I had a hard time finding frozen gnocchi but it was well worth looking for it.  It is very rich and creamy.  I did add 1 tsp of thyme for extra flavor as someone suggested and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a really hearty soup for a cold or rainy way indoors. The soup comes out thick if you add the cornstarch as suggested. If you prefer a thinner watery soup then just skip it. I also sliced the carrots instead of shredding them because i like it better that way.

I made this tonight & it was great.  If you have cooked chicken on hand it would be a quick meal. I simmered 2 full chicken breasts in the broth from frozen about for 25 minutes and then used about 1 1/2 breasts for this soup.  I didn't have fresh spinach so I used some mixed lettuce sliced into thin strips instead.  I also added a bit of chicken bouillon and some additional granulated garlic and a couple of dashes of Italian seasoning.  My DH asked if I kept the recipe,  in other words it's a keeper.  He just told his friend how good it was - that's a very nice compliment!

This is an AMAZING recipe.
I am a vegetarian so I had to make a few changes, skip the chicken and replace the chicken broth with vegetable broth. This ended up making it a little healthier due to the fact that vegetable broth has 15 calories per serving compared to 39 per serving for the chicken broth!!!! 
Bottom line this is great! :)

I used chopped spinach instead and it was nice. The broth/base is nice and smooth and creamy tasting -- it would be better with maybe new potato rather than the gnocchi. We had never tasted them before so I thought i would try it -- we did not like the taste of them at all - mushy and just a different flavour, was expecting more of a potato flavour. I will try this recipe again but without the gnocchi.

Amazing!  My family's favorite soup.  I did nothing to change it.  One time I tried to save calories by using milk instead of half and half but it was too thin.  It's well worth the calories though!

I have made this soup several times now.  It made a wonderful soup to serve on Christmas day with hot ham and cheese sandwiches.  It is now one of our favorite recipes!  I made no changes to the original recipe.  It is wonderful just the way it says!

Every spoonful had a mouthful of goodness!  I made it just as the recipe instructed.  I didn't thicken it with the cornstarch slurry. Will be made many times over in this house. Thanks for sharing this!

You've gotta try this soup!! So delicious! I suggest using  homemade chicken stock- so easy. Make in large batches and store in containers for future uses. My husband raved about the flavour of this soup. He doesn't even like dumplings, but loved them in this soup. You'll love this soup!

REALLY enjoyed this the next day as the flavors set. Needed a bit more spice of the salt and pepper kind, in my opinion. Makes a pretty big pot but as stated - tastes even better on Day 2!

This was delicious!! I was wondering what to do with gnocchi that I had purchased and this was perfect!  Rarely is there a recipe that everyone in the family likes--this was a winner and will make it into the "favorite" family recipes.  Next time I will try to lighten it up with milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2.

Fabulous!!  Best soup I've ever made!  I substituted non fat evaporated milk for half and half.  I also used 2 cups water with 2 cups broth.  I used the wheat/sweet potato gnocchi and did not use the corn starch.  It turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was expecting great things out of this soup after reading several of the reviews, but I was really disappointed. It was very bland, and not very thick at all. I will not be making this again.

This recipe has been making it's way through everyone in our office!! EVERYONE had to try making this soup. It's delicious, what a great idea.
Cornstartch/water omitted. We had no cream, so used skim milk and a little bit of sour cream and it worked out wonderfully. Also instead of shredded carrots we just used chopped baby carrots and that was fine too. 
Thanks for this great recipe, it shall definitely be a repeater!

Totally delicious. I seasoned with thyme, a bit of paprika, and two shakes of hot sauce, just to make it a bit more complex. I also cut down on calories by whisking cornstarch into a little skim milk and then adding more skim to taste... my soup thickened beautifully and was perfectly creamy. I've also made this with mini tortellini instead of the gnocchi... it's equally as good. Use a rotisserie chicken, it will send the whole thing over the top!

Tastes better the next day, garlic and other flavors really come together nicely! Great filling meal on a chilly, rainy day. I made the following modifications: no celery, tspn of dried thyme (essential IMO as it adds a lot of flavour), bit of nutmeg (couldn't even taste it so probably will leave out next time), used a bit less gnocchi (maybe 2/3 the amount) and 1% milk instead of half and half. H&H would have been too rich for my taste, and low-fat milk is a great, waist and heart-friendly substitution. With the cornstarch mixture it thickened up nicely and tasted creamy enough. Next time I'll probably shred the spinach and add some white wine, but this is a really great and easy recipe.

Fantastic soup.  I added in some poultry seasoning  and a couple of extra shakes of thyme.  A whole bag of baby spinach seemed like a lot so I only put about 3/4 of the bag in.  I could have used the whole bag and it would have been fine (and I wish I would have!).

I was worried that my family wouldn't care for it as we aren't big soup eaters, let alone a creamy soup, but it was loved by all!

I really must say I enjoyed this soup.  I mostly followed the recipe, but added a few spices to the onion/garlic/celery mixture.  I baked two chicken breasts which I had seasoned with seasoned salt, a little poultry seasoning and a bit of bouillon, and after the chicken cooled, cut them up.  Also, instead of thickening everything with flour or corn starch, I added a small can of condensed fat-free, sodium-free cream of mushroom soup and condensed fat-free, sodium free cream of chicken.  In addition, I added a splash of white wine.  Stirred everything up and let it simmer for 20--25 minutes or so.  My oh my, a great meal on a cold evening.

I made one major change to this recipe, which I think really helped. As I was pulling the ingredients together I kept thinking: All this fresh and healthy stuff, why would I want to add half and half? So, I didn't! I added a bit more chicken broth and a little water to make up for the omission, and I thought it was delicious. The gnocci added just enough richness to the mix. The only other change I would make -- and will make next time -- is to add the gnocci during the last few minutes of cooking. I don't think the extra time in the broth helped them at all. Can't wait to have some tomorrow, when I'm sure it will be even better!

I made this soup last night. The family loved it. We will definitely make this again. I had fresh ears of corn in the frig, and cut the kernels off one ear and added it with the veggies and cooked in the oil. A 2 thumbs up.

Fantastic soup!  After I'm done with a Roaster, I throw that into a big pot with water and onions/celery and garlic, and cook for an hour to create the broth.  Then I have the veggies, and the chicken also!  My family loved this soup!!

I made this recipe this week and it was great. It will be in my rotation! I tweaked a bit, for my personal convenience and taste. I used a store bought rotissere (herb&garlic) I removed all the meat, then put the bones and juices and skin in the broth until it came to a boil, I then let it simmer another 10 minutes or so. removed and discarded.( decided to do this based on other reviews ) I used butter instead of olive oil, and I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3. I did not use the cornstarch/water, I used gnocchi off the shelf and cut it in half with sissors. I think I added almost 10oz of spinich This is truly one of our favorite soup recipes...I will be making this for years to come! thank you so much, I had been wanting a soup like this. Nothing bland about this.

This recipe was easy to make and enjoyed by the whole family.  Even better as leftovers the next day. I would say it is even larger than 6 servings.

This was a great and easy weeknight recipe.  I served it with a salad and crusty bread and everyone really liked it.  I didn't have any chicken so I subbed chicken sausage which the kids loved.  I also chopped the spinach a bit per another reviewer and it made all the difference between my kids picking out the slimy chunks or just eating it without mentioning spinach at all.  Genius...I will do this every time I add spinach to soup now.  Plus it looked a lot prettier in the bowl.  Because of dietary restrictions I used 2% Lactaid milk instead of the cream with excellent results.  I added a bit of thyme, paprika and a dash of nutmeg as well, soups beg to be seasoned so I couldn't resist!

This soup was so good! I just bought a rotisserie chicken and pulled off all the chicken and then used the remains for a stock. I used full cream milk instead of half n half to cut the fat and flour/water to thicken. Fresh gnocchi is definitely the way to go!

Very good soup, but a little lacking in flavor.  I'll try adding some spices next time per other reviewers.  I hope the addition of the spices will take this to 5 stars!

I made it exactly as stated in recipe.  I don't think it needed corn starch even though I added it.  Helping are large and filling.  I would imagine it would be good with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  Hubby said it's a keeper.

My husband and I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  We just made it over the weekend.  INCREDIBLE flavor, aroma, and fulfilling.  Tis the season for soups as the weather starts to get chilly.  
For those who like celery salt for seasoning, sprinkle on just before serving.  Delicious!

This was a really good recipe... I am actually surprised since I made so many changes. I actually made it for my aunt that can't eat a lot of foods. I made this with veggie bullion instead of chicken broth. I used non-dairy creamer, and used flour instead of cornstarch. Since the Creamer was non-dairy I had to add  couple more tbs. of flour. I also used whole wheat gnocchi that has sweet potato. Came out pretty good :)

This was quite simply AWESOME!  Bought a rotisserie chicken to save time.  Nixed the cornstarch mix for roux.  Wanted it to last so added another 14 oz can of chicken stock; was still plenty thick enough.  Also did 1 lb. bag of carrots sliced thin - they cooked just fine in broth w/gnocchi, etc.  Added thyme and sage as others suggested.  Also did 1 pint of Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2.  Telling you, have to make it; just amazing!

This soup was SOOO good!  Nice rich flavor and great smooth texture.  The only things I changed, was to use heavy cream instead of half and half, (I did not have any half and half) I also used a whole large onion, because we like onion.  Will definitely be putting this recipe in my regular rotation!

This soup is excellent. I was going to share with my mom and my husband wouldn't let me give any away. It was so easy to make, not time consuming at all but it taste like you slaved over the stove to make it. I also used the fat free half/half which I don't think took away from the taste at all. I loved the spinach added to it. IT WAS JUST YUMMY!!

This was a big hit with my family. My Mother said it was wonderful, and asked for a bowl to go. Plan and simple it takes it's delicious flavor from the vegetables. I used 1/2 fat free half-n-half & 1/2 regular to cut the fat. The addition of fresh Thyme boosted the flavour. This will be a regular at my house! Thank you!

Very good!  Made only one change, used chicken tenderloins cut into bitesize pieces and poahed them in chicken stock.  Added some freshly ground nutmeg.  Will make again and again.  Garnished with fresh parmesan and parsley.

I made this soup for my boyfriend and I and we both agreed that it was very yummy.  This soup was pretty inexpensive to make as most of the ingredients we had on hand.  It was also extremely simple (even people who don't cook would find this easy), and didn't take me more than 10 minutes to put together.  I threw a few split chicken breasts in the slow cooker to cook for a few hours.  I saved the juices, added a little bullion and water and used that as the base for the soup.  I omitted the celery but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did attempt to make the gnocchi myself.... but that was disastrous and ended up going with some pre-made refrigerated gnocchi.  The only 2 reasons why this recipe did not get 5 stars from... I felt the soup had a bit of a "weird" after taste, almost like playdough (could have been something I did, maybe the gnocchi), and it wasn't anything extraordinary deserving of 5 stars.  Overall it was good and I will definitely be adding this one to my collection :)

This soup is amazing.  I did not use the cornstarch and water.  So so good, we just loved it.  I just finished eating it and can't wait to eat it again!

Really Unbelievable! Thank you for posting this recipe! The only thing I did was add about a tablespoon of butter. Just because I like it, it didnt need it. Also it didnt need the cornstarch.It thickened up nicely by itself.  My 12 and 5 yr. old came back for seconds!!!

This tastes like gourmet chicken and dumplings.  The only reason I only gave it four stars is because the recipe is pretty bland.  I added thyme, marjoram, and  rubbed sage to taste.  I used 1 cup of lowfat milk and 1 cup of non-fat half and half, and used the cornstarch mixture.  The consistency and richness was perfect.  I served my husband before adding the spinach and he really liked it...and he is not a big soup eater.  This is going to be one of my favorites...super easy with a store bought rotisserie chicken.

I made this soup this past week.  It was just amazing!!  My family were arguing about who had more.  I didn't have any gnocchi so I made it from the "quick gnocchi recipe".....I had to add gnocchi three times. My eldest son (15) had just come in from outdoors.  While he was eating he said, I've got to take my sweatshirt off, I feel so warm inside."  Great quick fix...We loved it...getting ready to start another pot.....

excellent! I messed up and added 2lbs of chicken instead of one...so added 2 cups of water and a chicken boullion cube to compensate.Added a couple more carrots and celery too. I also used fat free half and half. Came out great. Nice and thick but not bad for you!

I was unable to find Gnocchi, I was most likely looking in the wrong area of the store.  I used the smallest ravioli's I could find.  It turned out great, salt not needed.

I made it for my grand-daughter who has had a cold and sore throat for days.  She home for the fourth day from school and just finished a bowl fro breakfast.

This soup came out great!  I did add a bit more garlic to the soup after it was simmering.  Worth doing again!

Yummers! I made this tonight. I skipped the carrots because I didn't have any. I used milk instead of half and half and let it simmer for a long time. It wasn't thick enough for me, so I added a big splash of cream and the cornstarch mixture. Delicious! The picky eaters in my house gave it a thumbs up.

Very good comforting soup.  Followed recipe but left the optional cornstarch out.  Recipe is definitely a keeper.

Comfort food at its best! I used fat free half and half as others recommended and I am glad I did; it tasted great and was so much healthier this way. I also used shredded rotisserie chicken which has a lot better flavor than just cooked chicken breast. I poured the drippings from the bag right into the soup and then simmered the chicken carcass in water, reduced the stock to intensify the flavor, and added this stock to the soup at the end (I did use store bought stock for the original 4 cups). I did not add the cornstarch mix or a roux because I found that the potato gnocchi (I used frozen gnocci and they worked great) helped to thicken it sufficiently for our taste. What a great recipe; so glad to add it to my recipe box!

Made this soup exactly as prescribed. All four of us thought it was rather bland. I had to doctor it with some spices and it still didn't make that much of a difference. Probably won't make this again.

This soup is great and easy and quick.  Very filling and my picky kids loved it.  My only critique is that it definitely takes more than 5 min of sautee and 6-7 min of simmering to get celery to a more traditional soup consistency (read: much softer)Otherwise, fantastic soup!

Soup was amazing!

I used butternut squash instead of carrots and  cooked down the veggies with Thyme and Tony's.  Such a warm and hearty (but surprisingly also light) soup!

Oh - also subbed out the half and half for fat free and the corn starch for a little bit of all purpose flour. 

And followed someone else's recommendation to chop the spinach. Good advice!

I experimented and used this as a base, also added broccoli. Not sure what to think of Gnocchi. This was my first time using it and it kind of tastes like play-dough... 
regardless! will make again

Oh, yeah.  I've been craving chicken and dumplings lately and this totally fit the bill.  It's not overly-seasoned, as someone mentioned, just good, hearty chicken soup.  I found it to be thick enough for me without the cornstarch and I used 1/2 the half and half, it was creamy enough for me.  Yum, thanks!

Loved the soup.  We did use a whole chicken and made our own stock.  Not so fond of celery so we only used one stalk.  Great recipe, thanks!

WOW, this soup was not only delicious, but also super easy to make! I'd definitely recommend it. I didn't have any celery, so I just doubled the quantity of shredded carrot... it turned out great! Perfect for a chilly autumn day.

This recipe was one of the finest soups that I have ever eaten.  I substituted getting my chicken cubes from a traditional store bought cooked barbecued chicken that has a lot more flavor than a boneless, skinless chicken breast and I believe that it enhanced the flavor.  It was the first time that I have ever used Gnocchi's before.  They really added to make this soup superb.
Thank You for this keeper,  Ernie B.

AWESOME RECIPE! That said, it was a little diffacult to find Gnocchi. I finally found Gnocchi at PUBLIX. We are soup lovers in this house, so I simply doubled the recipe. There wasn't any leftovers. This is definately a keeper recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

Hi,
Love this recipe.  Have been making a version of it for years.
For Jeri - Trader Joe's carries Gnocchi in the pasta section.
