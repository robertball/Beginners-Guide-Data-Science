The measurements are off. Most of the liquid evaporates after simmering for 20 minutes. It filled 1/4 of the blender only and it tasted like a prune shake. I added another cup of water, 2 tsp of sugar and only 1 tsp of flour to save it.

This is a great plum sauce.  I like my BBQ with more spice but I was looking for a healthier style BBQ sauce and came across this recipe.  I cooked up some chicken in the pressure cooker and then put this sauce on it as is.  Very good and it led to seconds.  Thanks.

This is a delicious sauce - just tangy enough to truly capture the flavor of plums and not too sweet.  I did spoon some over ice cream tonight (great) but it would go great with any meat.  I had no problems with measurements.
