This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I used store bought turkey meatballs. I also added a few ingredients to the sauce like Worchestshire sauce, a bit of white wine, sauteed mushrooms and shallots and some paprika to give it a bit more homemade, less canned soup flavor. I will make this again!

We really loved this but I can't give it five stars because I don't think we would have liked it as it was written. I salted the meat, about a half to one teaspoon. I also added some pepper to the meat, and half of an onion, chopped very fine. I would consider at least the salt and pepper necessary. Additionally, because I didn't have vegetable soup I used a can of cream of chicken, and a can of milk, with vegetable "better than bouillon". Because the milk wasn't as thick as the soup I had to thicken the sauce with flour before serving. In the end, it was wonderful! I have to say though, that there is plenty of room for this to be yucky if you don't substitute with the right things, as some people have mentioned. Use discretion; if the soup you have doesn't seem like it would be good over noodles as a sauce, don't use it in this recipe. Also, I would suggest doing as I did and using milk and bouillon thickened with flour if you want to get away from the canned soup taste.

I used italian-seasoned ground turkey, and breadcrumbs made from a sundried tomato baguette. Also used a 26 ounce condensed tomato soup and added chopped fresh carrots and mildly hot peppers, and some heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk. A few changes, but the same basic guidelines, so I rate this a 4 of 5, really enjoyed it. Served it over rice. Didn't tell my husband it was canned soup until after he praised it profusely. ;)

If you are looking for quick easy meals, this is one you'll want to try.  When I first added the condensed soup the dish had that "canned soup" taste.  But the more the dish simmered, you couldn't tell that a convenience food was used in the dish.

Maybe it's me. I don't cook very often and I tried to improvise with this recipe to make it healthier... I think that's where I went wrong.
First off, I couldn't figure out which soup to use. Is condensed veg. soup the stuff that comes with the alphabet noodles in it? Well, in any case, that's what I used. I also used 2% evaporated milk. 
I baked the meatballs instead of frying them.
What I ended up with was really bland meatballs in an orange goopy mess. This dish is in no way pleasing to the eye. 

Luckily my dad will eat just about anything.. with a dash of hot sauce, he said it wasn't half bad (hence the 2 stars).

I won't be making this again.

This was delish! I didn't have condensed soup so I used regular and added some flour to thicken. I also used beef instead of turkey.  It will certainly be going into our dinner rotation!

Wonderful!!!!!!!!
I had never made meatballs before except one time long ago and those were a wreck. These were great and I loved the insta-sauce that goes with it!! The only thing I did different was I used a family sized can if veggie soup (26+ ounces) instead of 2 10.5 oz. cans, which made plenty of sauce.. Great recipe!!!!!!!

I loved the sound of this.  Quick, easy and realtively nutritious, I thought.  I cooked this last night for my family and ended up in tears.  I have never before served them something which tasted so bad or had worse texture. I'm not just disappointed with this recipe, I am downright annoyed.

This was OK. My husband loved it, kids ate the meatballs out, and I probably wouldn't make it for company, but it was OK. I added garlic pepper and a dash of worcestershire sauce  to the meatballs, and served the dish over whole wheat egg noodles.

we tried this recipe and it was very bland ... need to add many spices on your own to kick it up a notch!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  My picky children loved it.  The meatballs turn out so nice and moist.  It has become my meal that I take to fiends who are sick or just had a new baby.  It keeps well and can be reheated in the microwave.  Don't cook the sauce too much because it can get too thick.  Just great!

This will be a good recipe for when my nephew comes over. Seems like something kids would like. Tasted good but not something I'd crave often.

This was a simple but good recipe. I substituted the evaporated milk with light cream and since I only had one can of soup I used some watered down spaghetti sauce from a jar to replace the 2nd can. I served it over rice. Family liked it.

So we tried this out today I made the condensed soup from scratch, we try not to eat a lot of processed foods. Against my better judgment I didn't add a lot of seasoning this recipe didn't have really at all. I added sauteed celery garlic and onion to the meatballs. My kids said they were flavorless.I don't eat meat so I didn't try them. I did add a little bit of parmesan  cheese and a bag of frozen sweet peas. I think spinach or broccoli would have been good too. It still needed a lot more seasoning in my opinion. Obviously that is subjective. So it wasn't perfect, but I think it is a very good base recipe. I think tomorrow I will try to revamp the leftovers. I will use this recipe again just with more seasoning next time.
