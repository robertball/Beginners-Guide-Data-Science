This is a tasty recipe...my family all came back for seconds commenting on how good it was.
It looks like a lot of ingredients but I just sliced and diced everything, measured all of the dry ingredients into a small bowl, and pulled the rest of the ingredients out of the pantry before I started browning the meat. Everything went fast after that.
I like spicy and my family does too, but not as spicy as me, therefore I left out the sliced jalapenos and used Hot Rotel Tomatoes instead. I used a cup of cheese in the mix but probably closer to a 1-1/2 cups on top; served it with sour cream (a must) and tortilla chips.
The next day I used the left overs for burritos, perfect and didn't need additional cheese. Will make again, thanks for sharing.

I tweaked this using sriracha, 1 cup mild salsa, 1/2 c water, large can of corn, diced green chilis, chopped 1 garden tomato. Browned extra beef in garlic and taco seasoning early in the day and made the rest later. Added extra cheese (my family likes things cheesy)!! Served with sour cream and the new Keebler jalape√±o cornbread crackers. Yum!!! Everyone loved it - and if you're going to cook - don't you want everyone to love it?? Enjoy!

this was awesome!! I used chicken broth, instead of water (and actually added up to an extra cup of water as needed, while cooking). i didn't use rotel, just small diced tomatoes is all i had. at the end, i added some corn and  big dollop of sour cream and mixed it all together,. the taste was amazing. had  a nice hint of spice from the red  pepper. i loved it.

It's a winner! Good mix of flavors. I lined the casserole dish with tortilla chips for a little shell. Also had some sour cream on the side for a cool taste with the dish. Good stuff. And more importantly, hubby liked it!  Following the directions it's mild. I used the original style Rotel. If you want a kick, I suggest more cayenne or hot Rotel.

Excellent! It does need a bit more water while simmering.

This was great! My 2 year old loves rice and ground beef, so I was looking for something he would like. He had 2 helpings and loved it. I made it mild and didn't add the chili sauce, but it was still amazing. I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good. It seemed to need a little extra water to cook the rice. I added some corn. Black beans could be a nice addition. I was out of cumin so added some chili powder. I used tomato instead of chili sauce as am cooking for an almost 1 year old and a spice phobic teen. I used 1.5 cups cheese & my teen said she'd like more cheese, but then she is a cheese nut. I needed to add hot sauce to taste at the table.
