Wonderful!! Made this for Christmas and it was a hit. We used 2 round pans instead of the springform, and next time will do the same, and even slice those to make a 4 layer. There is plenty of cream filling, it was oozing out with 2 layers.  Don't substitute banana pudding for the imitation banana flavor, it is yummy! Big difference!

Couldn't find banana extract, so i just mashed up an extra banana and used that instead.  My family went crazy over this.

This cake was wonderful to make and serve. My family is actually very split when it comes to chocolate and fruit. Half of my family loves chocolate while the other prefers fruits. This cake brought them both together! I love the rich taste of the chocolate and the smooth creamy taste of the banana. I may be only cooking for about 5 years now. But this is one of the best cakes I have ever made and ate.

I baked it in 2 round cake pans as suggested, slicing to make 4 layers. To the filling, I added pineapple extract & 1/2 a small can of very well drained crushed pineapple. Then I sprinkled the inside layer with lightly toasted coconut & finely chopped macadamia nuts, finishing the top the same way before adding the 3 sliced banana garnish & mint leaves. AWESOME!!!!!

I've always found the combination of bananas and chocolate absolutely delicious, and this recipe did not disappoint.  I made only slight changes, using sugar free, fat free banana flavored pudding mix, which eliminated having to use banana extract, and I used skim milk to lighten the calorie load.

I only used the banana cream recipe from here (adding 1 fresh, but soft banana) and it turned out delicious - even better after refrigerated overnight.   I then put my own twist on this cake making it a tribute to Elvis, lol! I didn't have boxed cake mix, so I used a dark chocolate cake recipe (from AR) and frosted the side of the cake with a peaunut butter frosting (also from AR)... it turned out great and has now been requested by my 13 for his b-day cake.

Cake was a little dry, even with some extra oil in the mix. Fudge sauce was slippery which made the bananas & cream filling keep sliding off. I had to wrap a wide piece of foil around cake and chill.

Alternatively leave out the banana extract and use sliced strawberries. Sooo delicious!

I made my own cake, using the Black magic cake off this site.  Than followed recipe.  I found the cake tasty but not very visually appealing very very sloppy.   The filling was oozing all over the place.  Tasted good but wont be making again.

My first official kitchen catastrophe.  This cake was a sheer disaster.  The banana cream mixture was not near as firm as I had expected and when I smeared it between the two cakes, the cream was oozing down the sides and the top layer wanted to slide off as I spread a chocolate ganache on top.  Then, both the ganache and cream were falling down the sides of the cake (in a very unattractive way) and pooling all around the cake.  This cake was a birthday cake and unpresentable so as I tried to move it onto a new tray it ripped apart and was futher destroyed.  My only thought as to what went wrong: the amount of pudding mix should be a 3.4oz package (to help firm up the cream a bit more).  This cake was a good idea in theory but in reality it's a mess.

This cake was absolutely fantastic! Very moist. Not overly sweet - the chocolate and bananas together are heavenly. Could have ate more than one slice but I would've felt sinful!

I made this in 2 9-inch round pans, using a box mix that I added a package of chocolate pudding mix to.  I think I used too much hot fudge sauce, as my bananas kept slipping off the first layer! But that was definitely my fault.  I added a banana to the cool whip/pudding mixture and left out the banana flavoring.  I had a lot of extra cool whip/pudding mix left, so I ended up putting it over the entire cake (top and sides) but that was a good thing.  It looked beautiful!  The taste was so good!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I would've given it 5 stars... BUT since i chose to use my 9"cake pans I followed the recommendations listed here for eggs, oil, and milk. Baked for 28 mins., and it was very dried out. I love making my cakes moist! Personally, next time I will bake the cake as directed on the box and add the layers of *totally yummy goodness* =) I think too, it might taste good to use peppermint flavoring with crumbled andes mints layered... hmm other options to try?

This cake came out so good, made it for my mother in law's birthday and she loved it.  I used 2 8" rounds and made the cake according to the box instructions.  I had no problem with the filling oozing out of the sides, it looked just like the photo.  I will make this again.

It was ok. The cake seemed very dry the filling all came out,  and no way what-so-ever should you use sugar free fudge. May try again but doubtful. Disappointed.

This was pretty good and came out beautiful.  My only complaint was that the banana flavoring was so intense you couldn't really taste any chocolate!  Regardless, I would make it again.....

It was good cake but it was SO sweet. I could only eat a very small amount at a time!
