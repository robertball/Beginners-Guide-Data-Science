YUMMY!!!  I have to disagree about the "raw pumpkin" taste other reviewers mentioned.  I scaled recipe to 1 serving used 1/2 c. regular rolled oats, 1/2 c. milk, 1/2 c. water.  Added pumpkin and spices (didn't have pie spice) and 1/4 c. raisins.  My secret ingredient a dash of salt.  Never make oatmeal without it-brings out the flavors.  Microwaved for 5:30 mins. on high.  Added 1 Tbs. maple syrup at end.  Omitted cinnamon sugar.  This will be in my regular breakfast rotation from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!

If you make this oatmeal the way it is written, it is very bland and hard. I ended up adding more milk, because the oatmeal was in a big, hard lump. I also added a little salt, which helped bring out the flavors. It was still really bland, so I added extra pumpkin, and doubled the amount of pumpkin pie spice. This helped a lot. I also sprinkled the top of the oatmeal with a generous amount of extra cinnamon sugar. With these alterations, the oatmeal is very, very good. The pumpkin gives it a smooth, almost velvety texture. I will be making this again, but with these changes. Thanks for sharing!

I twekaed this recipe to my taste just a little: I make it one serving at a time the way I normally do: half a cup of oldfashioned oats with one cup of milk, in the microwave.  Instead of using pumpkin pie spice, I use the three traditional spices for pumpkin pie: cinnamon, ginger and ground cloves.  I don't use cinnamon sugar either, I use crystaline fructose (which I use ion place of sucrose just about everywhere).
Its one of my favorite breakfasts-- I started making it at the beginning of the fall semester when the weather started to turn wintery here in Wisconsin, now it's late June and I still by canned pumpkin regularly just so I can fix it.  Thanks for the great idea!

I love pumpkin oatmeal! I've been putting canned pumpkin in my oats for several weeks now. I was adding 2 tsp. organic brown sugar, but I've switched to sticking half of a frozen banana in the microwave for one minute, 'til it's melted, then adding in the oats/pumpkin/water/spices. That way I'm eating naturally sweetened oatmeal, plus getting veggies AND fruit in my first meal of the day!

Pumpkin lovers heaven, and healthy, too. With a little experimentation it's perfect for my taste. I use 1 cup of milk for 1/2 cup oatmeal (cook on stovetop) 1/2 cup pumpkin, 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of cloves. For sweetness I added a Sweet-n-Low. It's like having dessert for breakfast, and I agree with the other reviewer - extremely filling and satisfying!

Like another reviewer, I liked the idea of pumpkin (my favorite)in my oatmeal (my second favorite?, but didn't like the 'rawness' of the pumpkin flavor.  My solution? Make a batch of Libby's pumpkin custard usng the recipe on the back of the can. You make your regular bowl of oatmeal and add 1/2 cup of the custard mixture to it. You get double the amount of pumpkin for breakfast and it is PERFECTION in a bowl... and relatively guilt free.

Wow, this is a real nutritional powerhouse, using the old-fashioned oats instead of quick.  I used 1 c. oats, 1 c. milk, dash of salt, generous 1/2 c. pumpkin, 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice plus a sprinkle of cinnamon, plus Splenda until it tasted sweet enough.  I cooked it on top of the stove.  Delicious, and I like that it has the cinnamon, which is good to keep blood sugar levels steady.

Very bland as written, but I love the idea of incorporating pumpkin into oatmeal.  After reading reviews, I made the following changes:  used old-fashioned oats instead of instant for better texture, added 1/4 cup dried cranberries (raisins, dates, prunes would also work well) and I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a dash of salt, then omitted the cinnamon sugar.  I probably could have gotten away with just a couple tbsp. of brown sugar, but this definitely needs some sweetness added, even if it's just a little honey or maple syrup.  I'll be making this again!

I have a larger family, so I did NOT microwave.  I used water instead of milk, then just topped my bowl (and the children's too) with Half & Half, a rare treat.   The pumpkin left a raw taste, so cooking it for additional 10 minutes helped tremendously! Which in turn allowed the spices to blend better, don't forget to salt it.  The children still loved it and asked for it to made again. Note:Because recipe is not too sweet, some of my children added dried cranberries, some  of them just added 1 Tbsp Maple Syrup. (yea, I have 6 children.)

I think it is a good idea, a healthy way to satisfy my pumpkin craving, but the oatmeal was hard as a rock! next time I will up the milk/water to 1 1/2 cup and add the pumpkin in at the begining to cook it a little more. I also added 2 packets of splenda and increased the pumpkin pie spice a couple of shakes.

This is a great recipe, but needed a little tweaking for me.  Since I am eating for one, I always make a single serving with 1/2c. old fashioned oats, 1c. water (sometimes I add milk after, but I like to cook with water), 1/2 banana instead of sugar to boost sweetness, 1/3 c. canned pumpkin, and about a 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice with a little extra dash of cinnamon.  Made this way, I get a nice hearty, and flavorful oatmeal!

I love pumpkin and was very excited to try this. First off, I made this one the stove top; my older son and I thought it was ok but, my younger child did not care for it; so I tweaked it. I added a bit of salt (to taste) and I used brown sugar instead of the cinammon/sugar combo and I used soy milk just because my family likes soy milk better. After this, my baby liked it much better and my older son said it brought out the pumpkin flavor; thank you.

FABULOUS!! The kitchen smelled so good! My teenage daughter and elderly mother loved it as well. We don't use rolled oats, only steel cut, so I made the needed changes. Added vanilla almond milk instead of soy (we don't drink soy), crushed almonds and cranberries on top.
Mah-velous!!

Delicious!  I always make on the stove.  Cook oats in milk or water 3 minutes then add pumpkin puree and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ground ginger) for last two minutes.  I also love when mixed with coconut, cranberries, hazelnuts or walnuts.  My FAVORITE, healthy, filling breakfast.

Excellent recipe. Love the concept. I always add a little more pumpkin and spices tough. I also add some cut up bananas or fresh strawberries and nuts sometimes. It adds a little pizzaz:)

Love the addition of the pumpkin, but agree with the other's that this is in desperate need of some more flavor! Ended up adding a dash of salt, more cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice and a little bit of brown sugar.

I would give this 5 stars with a few tweaks, but made as written, it's really only a 3 star. It has potential and I will make it again, but with the tweaks. Made as written, it was extremely bland and needed alot more sweetening to make it palatable.  I also ended up needing altogether a 1/2 c more milk for the cooking process. After tasting, I added twice the pumpkin pie spice and a tablespoon of maple syrup (for one serving). The texture was typical oatmeal, so I also added a tablespoon of chopped almonds for crunch. This would also be good with steel cut oats, which would need a slightly revised cooking method. This was very tasty in the end and very healthy, so it's going to stay in my recipe box. It's a wonderful idea, so thank you for sharing it :)

Yum!  Used water instead of milk to cook, then once it was cooked I topped it off with milk.  Used cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg.  I've also made this topped off with light eggnog....even better! :)

This is such a great idea. I'm always looking for ways to add veggies to breakfast. I really like it both the way it's described and with the pumpkin custard that someone else suggested. With the custard, it could be dessert! Thanks for sharing.

I'm a health food nut, so oatmeal and pumpkin are winners for me. This is a healthy recipe but seriously lacking the wow factor. It was bland, needed maple syrup... alot. Needs something... but it's a great base.

Great base recipe, but will surely need to be tweeked to your personal taste. I added 1T ground flaxseed and used brown sugar instead of cinnamon sugar.

As is, it's okay. I added a couple level
tablespoons of brown sugar to make it
a little sweeter and less pumpkin-intense. After that, I loved it. My kids did not. I floated milk on the top and threw in a handful of raisins, as that's how I grew up always eating my oatmeal.

I used pumpkin butter and did not bother with any of the extra sugar or spices. It has it all in there and it doesn't have that raw pumpkin taste to it. We like to top ours with dried cranberries. Great fall breakfast.

I halfed this for a single serving.  I left out the cinnamon sugar and used a sprinkle of brown sugar on top instead. An excellent breakfast, worth making again.

I love everything pumpkin, but wasn't wild about this one.  It tastes like uncooked canned pumpkin.  UPDATE:  With the following changes this is now one of my favorite ways to serve oatmeal: cook the oats, milk and pumpkin together on the stove top.  Sometimes I add an egg to the milk at the beginning.  Needs more milk.

Good recipe, just needed a few changes for my taste. I made the oatmeal according to the package, not the recipe. I also used water instead of milk. After it was all made, I topped it with brown sugar like I always do. I loved it except I thought it had a little too much cinnamon in it. Next time I think I'll omit the cinnamon sugar and increase the pie spice to half tsp. I'll even add rasins! Yummmm!!!

I really loved this!  I left out the sugar (but did put plenty of cinnamon, and a little nutmeg), and added maple extract and vanilla extract for added sweetness (maybe a Tbsp. of each).  I had a few Craisins laying around, so I added those to the mix, as well as some unsweetened coconut flakes.  I finished it all by topping with pecans.  Thought this made for a wonderful breakfast.  Great flavor, great texture, and totally nutritious. :)  Thank you!

This was very bland. I doubled the pumpkin pie spice and the cinnamon sugar and it was still tasteless. Won't make this again.

I added ALOT to this to make it taste like more than oatmeal with raw pumpkin.  I added extra pp spice, cinnamon, salt, raisins and honey.  It is now just ok and I really like pumpkin things.

I agree with the others as written this was very bland and desperately in need of more milk. I added more pumpkin pie spice, a generous dose of cinnamon sugar and a touch of brown sugar. I may add a little salt next time as others suggested. It is a great way to get some extra veggies in your kids though.

I have oatmeal for breakfast pretty much every morning and needed something different for fall. This turned out really well. I added a couple tablespoons raisins, and used 1 cup water to 1/2 cup old fashioned oats.  There is something different about having the unbaked pumpkin in your oatmeal. I didnt mind so much, as it didnt affect the taste negatively, I think it was a texture issue with me. I still really enjoyed this and will probably make again.

Delicious!...with tweeks. I cooked stove top. Used a full cup of water and 1/2 c of milk, since it was already too thick with 3/4c milk before it even got warm. I used the suggestion of microwaved frozen banana, mixed it in with the pumpkin, oats, water/milk, 1/2 tsp. salt, 3 heaping tsp. brown sugar, some cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger (didn't have pumpkin pie spice), and then cooked the whole thing on medium until it was hot and creamy, topping it with chopped walnuts. Just like having creamy pumpkin break, only better for you. Thanks Juloyes for the great idea.

After reading RENEE35's review, I was worried about the raw pumpkin taste. I didn't want to make custard per se, with the egg and all. So, my solution was to make a batch of Libby's "quick pumpkin pudding" with one packet of FF SF vanilla pudding, a can of FF evap milk and a tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Stir in with your prepared oatmeal. Perfection without the calories or the egg.

ty for the posting of this recipe. ive been looking for more oatmeal ideas. and this has definitely helped. i added a sprinkle of cinnamon since i aint big on the spice. and i took the milk and the pumpkin puree and heated it first. then added my oats. since they are quick oats. its a better idea to wait to the last minute to add em. unless u want a hard lump in a bowl. btw, u can add more pumpkin if u wish when ur doing things this way if you arent liking enough pumpkin flavor. and yeah i used a bit of regular sugar to taste. so good.

If I try this again: Do not use the frozen bananas to sweeten. Don't skimp on the spices. Consistency was good on stovetop. Mix everything before adding oatmeal.

This is great recipe. I used unsweetened almond milk and added some truvia. To make this a 5+ star recipe, add some crushed walnuts and a little brown sugar to the top. So delicious, and a healthy alternative that can also be a great vegan option.

Oh my! This is a perfect breakfast to usher in fall! I cut the serving size down to 1, had to keep adding milk a little at a time as the submitter said, and instead of adding cinnamon sugar, I added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and topped it with Coffee Mate's Italian Sweet Cream liquid creamer. My new favorite breakfast!

I didn't have any pumpkin pie seasoning so used a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg and pinch of ginger instead (omitted cinnamon sugar).  Cooked my oats with water instead of milk and then topped with soy milk.  Delicious, nutritious and very filling!!!

I really wanted to like this but as written it was bland to me. After tasting as written I added more pumpkin pie spice. Then some brown sugar. Then more brown sugar. Then a little salt. After my additions I was able to eat it but I don't think I'll be making this again.

I give this one a four with my additions:  a lot of brown sugar, salt to taste and raisins.  Also, I used old-fashioned instead of quick; a texture thing.

Am I the only one who found this really bland? Maybe I didn't add enough pumpkin spice...but I did follow the directions. It actually tastes more bland to me than just plain oatmeal. Maybe I'll go drizzle some honey over it or something... but even the pound of cinnamon/sugar I've put on top of it hasn't helped.

I use half milk and half water and old fashion oats and cook it on the stovetop.  It takes a little longer but I prefer the chewiness of the bigger oats. I drizzle a big spoon of honey on top and don't forget the raisins! I am FULL for several hours after this healthy breakfast.

Thank you for a great idea!!  I made quick cooking oats as I usually do (with water, not milk), added pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice and a drizzle of maple syrup, yummo!!  A great change for your fall oatmeal!  Thank you!

I was looking for something quick and easy in the morning, I have to get up for work @ 4:30am! I used to just skip breakfast but I know that is not good.
I tried this because I love pumpkin, but I agree with other reviewers that the "RAW" taste was not for me. I used a can of Libby's Pumpkin Pie mix that was already spiced and added a 1/2 cup to my oatmeal. I also used rolled oats which I prefer over the quick oats, and I just microwaved them for 3 min. It was great! Thanks for the idea, I will definately be making this every morning. :-)

I thought this was pretty good, and stretched a bowl of regular oatmeal even further.  I like to make the 5-minute oats that you cook on the stove (i.e., not instant).  I cooked the pumpkin spice with it, then added the pumpkin puree when it was done.  I had to add a lot of sweetener, but once I did that, it was good.  Kind of a weird recipe, but I bet I'll make it again.

I love this. It is my new favorite breakfast. I half the recipe, add raisins, and use more liquid than stated. I've used water when I was out of milk and it worked just as well.

I liked the idea better than the result. My original notes say 'kind of thick and weird'. I will make it again using more milk, sugar and spice. This really is a good way to add vegetables to breakfast. VERY filling!

We enjoyed this - added some butter and needed more sweetness.  We topped it with honey.  Very good.  Also, added about 1/3 more milk.  Will definately make this again.

A bit bland as is but there are so many good things that can be added to this to make it more flavorful. My favorite addition is dates, but other additions include raisins, dried cranberries, sweetened coconut flakes, walnuts, pecans, almonds, banana slices. Always add a dash of salt to bring out the oatmeal flavor. This is such an easy quick to make bowl of nutritious goodness!

I found this to be bland so I used coconut milk and added pure maple syrup. It turned out really good. I gave it three stars from how it tasted prior to adding the other ingredients.

I'm not an oatmeal fan, but this was better than my usual oatmeal.  Did NOT cook in microwave-followed instructions on canister. I basically went by recipe, except I used almond milk needed extra milk btw)  and added a little more pumpkin.  Also, some chopped walnuts and fresh frozen coconut helped amp up the texture and fiber. And if you find it bland (what oatmeal isn't?) naturally add more spice (+ salt) and add to the liquid along with nuts & coconut as oatmeal cooks to get those flavors into the oatmeal.... If you gotta eat oatmeal, I guess this is the way to go.  Happy Heart Health!

Yummy fall breakfast! I doubled the recipe for leftovers. I used 2 cups quick oats and probably 1 1/2 cups milk. The oatmeal was too liquid you for me, but with the addition of the pumpkin puree (1 cup) it turned out perfect. I added ~2 tablespoons brown sugar, for a richer taste, ~1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon allspice. 
Note that with the addition of the puree the oatmeal will cool and may need to be heated again. So yummy and filling!

I made this as a quick breakfast to take to work. It was so filling and tasted so good! I am diabetic so I didn't use the sugar but only cinnamon and it really didn't need the sugar. I added a little sugar-free caramel vanilla coffee creamer to thin it out and oh my gosh! It was fantastic! I freeze my own pumpkin puree instead of using canned and this is now my favorite breakfast before work.  I will make this over and over again!

I made one serving. I added the pumpkin to the milk and stirred until  combined. I also smashed half of a ripe banana and added it to the pumpkin milk before adding the oats. I used cinnamon & allspice instead of pumpkin spice. It's what I had on hand. It was delicious and the ripe banana gave it enough sweetness, so I didn't need to add any sugar.

Pumpkin is great for breakfast esp. with the oatmeal.  A tip I can share if your out of milk is to substitute cream cheese and melt it slowly in the  crock pot, very delicious!

I have to agree with some of the reviewers. This was very bland. Rather than adding more milk I added I.D. Sugar Free Pumpkin Pie Spice coffee cream, more pumpkin spice, a dash of salt, some brown sugar and more cinnamon. It was a lot better after all these additions. I do not think the recipe works as written.

I eat a lot of oatmeal in the winter and love pumpkin, so this was a no brainer for me. I donât add sugar so use raisins for sweetness and this was perfect with the pumpkin!

This is a great, simple recipe that's easy to make. I've made it many times by now and it's one of my go-to breakfasts when I want something tasty, healthy and hot in the morning, but don't have a ton of time. I like  to use steel cut oats, brown sugar, and a few chopped walnuts.

I needed a way to use up my left over fresh pumpkin. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and just a bit of vanilla extract. It turned out pretty good, but hardly even a minute was needed for a more "oat" consistency and less of a mush one. Thankfully my husband loved it!

I added 4 tbsp ground flax seed and 3 tbsp of chia seeds.  I opted for 1/2 milk/water ratio - 1/2 c each; I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp each of ground ginger and ground nutmeg plus a 1/4 c of craisins.  I cooked the pumpkin in with the oatmeal/spices/craisins.  To serve, I topped each bowl of yogurt with maple syrup (to taste), 1/2 c of greek yogurt and 1/8 c of walnuts - yummy!!!

I followed suggestions from others and this was fantastic! I scaled the recipe to 1 serving  and used 1/2 c. regular rolled oats, 1/2 c. milk, 1/2 c. water. Added the pumpkin and pumpkin spice, 1/4 c. raisins, a dash of salt and a little extra cinnamon sugar. Microwaved for 4 mins. and added 1 Tbs. maple syrup at end. Very filling and tasty!

A bit too plain, I added some stevia and brown sugar which really helped, I'm not a fan of the plain pumpkin taste and even with the cinnamon sugar it wasn't my favorite.

This was very very very very bland. It was unedible to both me and my seven year old. I had to make a lot of changes to be able to eat it. I will read other reviews and see what others have done to be able to give this recipe 4 and 5 stars! I'm rating as recipe is stated though.

This was fun because it was so simple and a great way to use canned pumpkin. I didn't want to use sugar and so it came out with a strong flavor. Then I added sugar and it tasted nicer. I would like to add Truvia into it next time to make it super sweet and without sugar. Added flax seeds.

I almost doubled the amount of pumpkin in this recipe because I love the taste of pumpkin, and it was still not flavorful enough for me. I think this has the potential to be delicious but it could use some tweaking first.

I think I did something wrong. I did not have cinn sugar, so I did 1/2 tsp sugar and 1/2 tsp cinn. Otherwise followed exactly. Its pretty good but it looks very unappealing. But I am 24 weeks pregnant, so maybe it's just me.

Great recipe. Like others i've modified it for an individual serving. I added .5 cup oats with 1 cup of water and .5 cup of milk, ground cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice. Instead of the raisins, I cut a peeled banana in half, put some cinnamon on both sides and grilled it in a pan while the oatmeal cooked for 5 minutes in the microwave. Perfection.

I thought this was okay, but the flavor of pumpkin is too strong. I would suggest using less pumpkin and adding more sugar, perhaps a little brown sugar.

I had great hopes for this recipe, but I thought it was super bland, I couldn't finish it. I might not have put enough sugar in it. I think it could be good if you don't mind loading up on the cinimon sugar, maple syrup or some kind of sweetner, but I wanted to keep it healthy. Just my 2 cents.

Very, very good, healthy, and a good way to get a veggie for breakfast (especially for a picky toddler!).  

Will try adding brown sugar/maple syrup next time - my toddler loves it, but I could use a little more sweetener.  :)  Thanks!

I so much wanted to love this!  I was expecting a taste like "pumpkin pie for breakfast" but it took some tweaking.  I needed a lot of brown sugar.  The smell was wonderful.  Made me ready for fall, and it's barely summer!  I will probably make this again, my little son liked it too, and it IS healthy.  Thanks Juloyes!

Yes it's tasty and filling after adding some raisins and sweetening it with either brown sugar or maple syrup (omitting the cinnamon sugar). I also used 1/2c oatmeal and 1/2c milk.
