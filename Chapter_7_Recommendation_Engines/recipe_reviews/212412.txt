I used fat free milk instead of soy milk, honey instead of Stevia (I'm trying to cut out all artificial sweeteners due to fibromyalgia), and I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used organic frozen berries. Very good. Very. Excellent way for me to jumpstart my busy day and it was quite filling. I plan on making one of these every morning this week.

This is delicious and I made it while I was sick. By the time I finished it I was starting to feel ready to move. You need to put a full cup of milk though or it's almost too thick to even come out of the blender.
