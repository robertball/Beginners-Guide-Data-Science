I thought these were pretty good. I would rate them between a 4 and 5. They reminded me of an almond version of a pecan sandy cookie. Getting the dough to come together was a bit tricky. I added 2 teaspoons of water and it worked perfect. I made a half a recipe and got 17 cookies using a standard cookie scoop. I did notice that they keep the shape in which they are placed on the sheet. So, I would flatten slightly unless a mounded cookie is desired. ty

I like this recipe and, as the title suggests, they really are easy. My cookies came out well because I paid attention to the comments of the other reviewers. I reduced the amount of flour from 2 cups to 1  3/4 cups. I added 1 tablespoon of water. Instead of "crushing" the almonds, I ground them in the food processor. These small changes were worth it. My dough was soft and easy to work with. Reviewers mentioned that the cookies mostly retain their shape during baking, so I pressed the balls very gently on the cookie sheet to flatten them slightly.  And just for fun, I pressed a slivered almond on top of each cookie for decoration.  They came out perfectly. I might increase the sugar next time since I have a sweet tooth.

Amazing! Taste like Sandies except hot out of my oven. I just suck too many down without letting them cool enough.

I used 1/2 a cup LESS than the recipe and that helped with the dryness and difficulty keeping the dough together that previous reviews mentioned. Quick, easy and YUMMY!!!!

These turned out super yummy.  Very buttery and almond flavored.  I did the same as some of the reviewers and only used 1 3/4 cup of flour, added 1 tsb of water, and put the almonds in a food processor until they were finely chopped.  I also added 8 tbs of sugar instead of 7.  I used a convection style of baking and added 30 seconds to the total baking time of 15 mins.  I also added almond slivers to make a pretty pattern on them while baking.

I used pecans in place of almond and made cookies and roll some fingers and put powered sugar on them AND THEY WERE FANTASTIC.  I loved them and everyone in my family loved them also. I had them at my book club also and everyone asked for the recipe.

I made these because I had all the ingredients on hand. Seemed to me that there were not enough wet ingredients and after looking at other reviews I thought I would try adding an egg. I used a cookie scoop and the "dough balls" did not spread at all. They tasted pretty good but didn't look so hot. I rolled them in powdered sugar and now they look a bit more appetizing. The flavor was good but nothing to write home about. I doubt that I will make again.

I made this cookie today and followed some of the other reviews. Reduced flour to 1 3/4 cup, finely chopped almonds in old-fashioned grinder,  1.2 cup sugar, 1 tsp almond extract, and 1 tsp. water--I thought they were easy enough to make, but too sweet (and for me, that's saying something!) --also thought they looked a little bland, so will put 1/2 cherry on top next time.

Very dry and didn't rise. By the time I reduced flour, adjusted the sugar and added 2 T of water, the results were not up to par. I think it needed a little levener. I would not make this recipe again.

I liked this recipe, but definitely pay attention to the reviews. I made this recipe with a bit of my changes to prevent dryness or blandness.  First and foremost I used a cup of almond flour for the crushed almonds as they are both technically the same. I replaced 1/2 cup of the flour for 1/2 cup of almond flour. Thus, I used  1 1/2 cup of flour plus 1/2cup of almond flour to prevent dryness. Regarding the sugar, I added initially 8 tbsp (1/2 cup) of sugar and still ended up adding an extra 1/4 cup as the dough was a bit bland. I baked them for about 10 minutes as 15 seemed to brown a bit too much the bottom of the cookies. All in all with the aforementioned adjustments the recipe should be fine. I compare this recipe to the Almond Cookies I available from this site minus the amaretto liquor. I added a full tsp. of almond extract since I like it a lot. It was crunchy but well balanced with a faint chewy interior. The replacement of almond flour for the crushed almonds makes it easier to mix and handle as it yields a dough that can easily be shaped.

After reading the reviews, I decided to heed the advice of others and reduced the flour to 210g (1 3/4C) increased the almond extract to 2 tsp, which added extra liquid to hold the dough together, and I used 8 T of sugar instead of 7. My food processor did a good job of grinding the almonds, though I left them a bit coarse to give the cookies a little crunch. My 1 T cookie scoop yielded 30 cookies which were done after 13 minutes at 350. My oven runs just a tad hot. 
The dough was very easy to handle. I flattened each cookie a bit after placing them on the sheet to bake. 
We thought they were delicious as is, but are even better with a dusting of powdered sugar! Salted butter was what I had, so I used it, but unsalted would be okay too. They weren’t too salty for me. I’ll be making these again.

These were OK.  I was expecting more almond flavor in an almond cookie, and more sweetness.  This tasted more like a shortbread to me.  I won't make them again.   I made them with my kids, and they were so disappointed.

I made this recipe using gluten-free all-purpose flour and non-dairy butter. The only addition I made was to add 1 1/3 teaspoons xanthan gum due to using the gluten-free flour. The cookies came out lovely! They are buttery and not too sweet, and the texture is as another reviewer described, like pecan sandies. I was glad I added the almond and powdered sugar on top, both for esthetics and taste. I added the almonds before putting the cookies in the oven, and the powdered sugar once I moved them to a wire rack to cool using a sieve. Will definitely make again!

I love these cookies and have made them several times.  They are a bit difficult to work with.  Other reviews suggest  adding a couple of tsps of water.  I almost added more butter .  Next time I will try tweeking the recipe a touch so that the dough is easier to form but I love theese cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!   * I made them again and added 2 Tablespoons of milk which  made them much easier to work with.

These are fantastic tasting cookies.  I noticed that many people found them too dry.   Changes made :   Added 1 large egg (beaten);  1 1/2 tsp. pure almond extract.  If you like fresh refrigerator cookies, you can split the dough in half, roll it into two logs then wrap in wax paper then plastic wrap.

I followed the recipe exact. I sifted 2 cups flour, going with 2 cups sifted flour. I used a industrial mixer. Creamed the butter, sugar & extracts first, slowly added the flour & crushed  almonds (I used a food processor to crush raw toasted whole almonds) Dough came together perfect! Rolled walnut sized balls, baked 350 degrees, 15 minutes. Cooked to perfection. 
If you are looking for a moist cookie this recipe is not for you. 
This recipe is definitely a dry, nutty cookie! I'm very pleased with this recipe, considering lightly dusting with powder sugar  to create "snow balls" Happy Holiday's!

I made this recipe following exact directions. After baking, I would have rated this three stars. Wasn't sure if I was a fan. Did feel they were dry. After having them sit overnight I find them much tastier the next day. I will make them again and may try using less flour. They are flavorful.

Nice! I didn't bake it till it was too brown, just a light dusting and it was very buttery and fragrant. I used salted butter to have a slight salty sweet taste, and for those watching your sugar intake, reducing the sugar to 7 moderate tablespoons is just nice. I also tried adding chocolate chips which was just as yummy! The amount of flour is alright.

They were very dry and didn't have the best flavor.

Nice n I call them almond crumbles cookies that melt in your mouth.  Added 250g of butter and lessen the flour to 225g.  Enjoyed them with milk tea for my afternoon tea.  Will definitely bake these cookies again.
