Good bruschetta recipe, but I also added diced roma tomatoes, olive oil, crushed garlic and salt/pepper to taste. The mango/tomato taste is amazing. I've found, having made bruschetta many times, that lots of cheeses are good with it- for this I used fresh grated parmesan and it was great (but gruyere is the best). Thanks!

This was a hit at mother's.  Even the picky eaters loved it!  I got requests to make it again.  It does not make much, however, so I will at least double it for 6 or more people since it was such a hit.  Just a nice different appetizer form the usual.

This is really great, but you have to add some things. I took soft swiss cheese(about three triangles) and added green chilis(half a small can), a couple drops of red hot pepper sauce and a bit of garlic powder. Then I mixed that together and spread it on the brochetta just after crisping the bread, as a base for the other flavors. I did everything else the same, except I added roasted red bell peppers as well. DELISH party tray!

I didn't like this much. I might try denise's suggestion, and use tomato with the mango. Thanks anyway.

Loved this idea! Surprising hit among picky eaters! 

I added some red onion and some cherry tomatoes (halved) as well as some garlic to my mix before throwing everything in the oven. FANTASTIC!

I served this recipe at a dinner party for the first time.  Everyone was looking at me like they were not going to like this dish.  When I served it they were so surprised at the great taste and how great this birchetta appetizer turned out.  It was a big hit!

EXCELLENT!!  I tried this recipe because it sounded refreshing.  I added plum tomatoes and red onion with a little salt and pepper and it was awesome!   My guests were raving about it and were surprised at how the flavors all melded together.  I used the romano cheese and thought this had a great compliment to it.  I see that others have suggested other cheeses so that may be something to try later.  I would recommend this recipe if you are looking for something a bit different, but be sure to add the extra ingredients that really make it a great recipe.  Thanks to other reviewers for the suggestions!

I have made this twice and both times everyone loved it!  I did add some salt and pepper to taste.
