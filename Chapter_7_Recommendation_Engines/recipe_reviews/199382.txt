Incredible. It seemed too easy, but the flavor is incredible. I substituted the powder from a Lipton Onion mix for the onion powder and it worked great.

This was a surprise.  I only modified the ingredient list by adding a teaspoon of salt.  Other than that, I did not deviate from the recipe.  I cooked the roast to exactly 160 degrees and it was succulent.   It even passed the "kid test."  I will do this again.  Thanks!

Too much seasoning! You could cut the seasoning in half and it might work.

This is fast easy and uses spices that I always have in the cupboard. I cut the onion and garlic powder in half and it is plenty for our taste. I also add 1 tsp of salt and 3/4 tsp of paprika to the rub. I also like to sear the roast in hot oil till nicely browned on all sides and add potatoes to the pan with the roast. Delicious!

Nice flavor, lots of pepper but I used fresh ground so I think it came out a little stronger than if you used pre-ground. This was a nice simple meal and tasty. I ran out of garlic powder and used minced garlic but it made the resulting paste harder to work with than I think a rub would have been. Still it tasted great and my husband is looking forward to the leftovers for lunch. Thanks for sharing this, we really enjoyed our meal.

Will do this again.  I used a Pork Loin Sirloin End Roast for this. It came out a little pink in the middle but I'd rather have the pink than it being dry and tough. I also shredded some of the pork leftovers and added it to some pork gravy for sandwiches. They were delicious!

Did not need to go all the way to 160* as that made it a little dry, but still very tasty

A flavorful nice & easy seasoning made the tenderloin a hit with the family. I added a teaspoon of salt but was soooo simple and it came from basic ingredients I always have on hand.

My husband taste a piece while I was slicing it up and said " Now thats the pork roast I was talking about!" I seared the meat after coating it with the seasonings. Next time I will check the temperature after about an hour but will definately make this again.

I live in Iowa and when I saw this recipe on The RecipeBuzz last week I had to try it! Go Hawks! I've made this twice this week. The first time with beef roast in a slow cooker, and the second time with a pork roast on top of the stove in an enameled cast iron roaster. 
BOTH times my husband said it was the best roast he'd ever had, and I have to agree. I wish I'd come across this sooner. He even took the rest of the pork roast to work today and he HATES leftovers!!!!! I will never make a pork roast any other way, ever. As for beef, I will use this but sometimes I also like beef roast in au jus with onions, carrots etc,. So I may slide once in a while on beef...but otherwise...this IS THE recipe!

made this for dinner today on 2/10/11 and it  is so so good and it falls apart and melts in your mouth i was looking for a good pork roast recipe and now i found one this one is a keeper thank you so much. I made this a meal in one and added baby new potatoes,carrots,onions and celery. even my fussy boyfriend liked it and gave this 4 stars. The only thing i did do differnt was add a little bit of water to it to help keep it most and cooked it at 350 for 90 minutes for a 1.23 lb roast

The mix of seasoning was very tasty and the roast came out nice and juicy. I added a pinch of salt to the rub and my family just loved it. My wife asked me to make this recipe every time I do a pork roast.  Thank you for this recipe.

Tasty basic pork roast recipe.  It needed salt though. I added a teaspoon to the rub, but it needed more.  I would use this recipe again, but I recommend salting to taste.

I liked this recipe but the family didn't care for it as much so I have to give it a 3.  It did have a strong peppery flavor so if I make it again I will reduce the pepper.

I have been cooking pork roast for years but always seems to have it turn out dry.  This recipe has ended my search.  I made it exactly as the recipe is stated.  I put it in my roaster and added a bit of water.  Put the lid on popped it in the oven for 90 minutes and it was the best ever.  Moist and so flavorful!  Thanks for the recipe!

We really liked this.  The meat was moist and tender.  I watched temperature carefully and didn't let it go over 160 degrees.  I added sea salt and some Mrs. Dash's seasoning to the rub.  Excellent!

I think that I am a little more difficult to impress when it comes to a pork dinner. This recipe is a good one, on the high plus side it is simple to make and has the bare minimum of ingredients and is very simple to follow. Down side, I'm just hard to impress.

I used the onion soup mix in stead of the onion powder. I also added a can of beefy mushroom soup with some water to the bottom of the roaster, covered and cooked in the over at 275 for about 3 hours and then uncovered and cooked for another hour on 325. It was amazing! And too simple to believe.

Too much seasoning for my kids' taste.  It also was a little too dry, but maybe that's not the recipe's fault but the specific pork we bought or our oven.  My husband and I liked it well enough but next time we'll use a little less seasoning and perhaps not roast it for as quite as long.

I think there is too much pepper. Will try it next with 1/2 the amt.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was FANTASTIC!  I followed the recipe as written with minimal changes .  I rubbed the roast  lightly with olive oil before sprinkling on the seasoning mixture.  I did not use all of the spice mixture, would've been way too much.  I did use a larger pork loin roast (5.6 lb).  If you do, just bake at 350 for 20-25 min/pound. Also baked with the fat side up. Everyone in the house loved this one. It's a keeper.

I also used onion soup mix instead of the onion powder.  I have now made this several times.  It is wonderful!  Very tender and flavorful.

I made this today. It came out delicious! I rubbed the spices into the pork, then seared it in a frying pan. Added sliced onions to the top and put it in the oven. When it was done cooking I covered it with aluminum foil and let it rest for about 15 minutes. I did add a small amount of water to the bottom of the pan and mixed up the juices to make a light, simple, but tasty broth. I will be making this often.

This was wonderful! I cooked it in an oven bag, and used the idea of another reviewer by using onion soup mix in place of the onion powder.  Everything else as directed in the recipe.  Just great and really simple....Thanks much!
