Made this today and loved it! I used Century Red by  Biltmore Estates- it paired well with the blackberries. I will make this again and again - it is a keeper.

This was a time-consuming recipe; I thought it would be worth it in the end, but the little bit of wine overpowered the taste of the blackberries that we'd worked so hard to procure.  I would make again with less or no wine.

Great recipe.  I use a cabernet sauvignon.  I always feel more sophisticated whenever I eat this.
