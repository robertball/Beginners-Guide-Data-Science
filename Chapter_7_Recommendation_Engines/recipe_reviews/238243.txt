Well this one was an even split in the house, myself and my 17 yr old loved it, but the husband and other son said , no way. It has a good flavor, but called for spices I do not usually cook with. This might have been better if I used different spices my family is more used to, like oregano, parsley, spinach flakes, onion and garlic powder. I never added brown gravy  dry mix to anything. This was very good. Next time I try it, I will use the more traditional spices everyone in my household uses.

Awesome dish! I had to cook mine slightly longer, but it may be because I added extra water. Also, I used the water from boiling the sweet potatoes for extra flavor. I used ground turkey and it tasted great, I wouldn't change anything.

I made it with turkey and substituted carrots for corn. It was delicious and flavourful. I also used smoked cheddar instead of feta. It was a hit with my husband who doesn't like turkey.

I made it according to the recipe, but found it bland. I added ginger, ground coriander seed, garlic, cayenne, chickpeas and tomatoes. It helped greatly.

It is a very tasty way to use leftover meat.  This review doesn't express how really delicious a meal this is.  Try it!!

I made this using leftover lamb. In lieu of gravy mix, I used the fat drippings, which was about 3/4 C+ 1/2 C water + 1 tbsp flour. I omitted feta because I didn't have it on hand. The whole family loved it.

This was one of the yummiest things I've ever made.  My mother loved it too, which isn't always true of oddly spiced dishes.  This is easy, delicious and it goes a long way.  We've actually made roast beef so we could make this next.
