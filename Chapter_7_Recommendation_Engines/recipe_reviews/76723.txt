Sorry, but we didn't like this.  The Italian seasoning seemed a bit strange, but I wanted to follow the recipe exactly; I should have followed my instinct.  Additionally, it needed a lot more salt than what the recipe calls for.  It just wasn't very good.  Thumbs down on this one.

I love this recipe!  And best of all, my family do too!  I left out the bell peppers though, as my husband has an allergy to them, but it still tasted great, and was easy as pie to make!

Very good!  We liked the combination of vegetables, so I didn't change anything. (This is unusual for me--I like to experiment.) Will definitely make this again.

This made a fine, satisfying meal, and I will undoubtedly make this in the future. I did have to had water to the recipe though; the broth and beer did not provide enough liquid for all the meat and veggies to simmer in.

I made this for my husband and he loved it. Then a few neighboorhood kids dropped by and they loved it, and when their folks came by they finished it off!! Everyone enjoyed it, and the kids asked for seconds on the turnips!!thanks for the great recipe.

I changed the recipe a bit to suit my family of vegetarians by using 2 lbs. soy chicken and unchicken broth for the beef broth. Was a huge hit! Everyone had seconds.  Will be a winter staple!

This receipe is fantastic!  My husband loved it.  I used just pork and no lamb and used orange and yellow peppers.  A time consuming recipe, but worth the wait!   Thank you for the recipe.

This was awesome!  Used beef instead of lamb.  Had to add another 2 cups of beef broth, but I may have added more veggies than called for.  Will definitely make this again!

I substituted a few things (I'm not a pepper fan), and my timing was off, so I only cooked this for an hour instead of two, but the basic recipe and the cooking method, especially the first steps with onions, seasonings and pork, are excellent. This had lots of flavor, and by timing when to put in vegetables, nothing got mushy, especially the potatoes.
