Tried this recipe tonight for the first time and it was very good. I screwed up by not watching it in the oven and probably due to the shallowness of the baking dish I used, 25 minutes at 400 degrees was a little too hot for a little too long. Luckily the dish wasn’t ruined and ended up tasting great anyway. The only mods I made was I added a little more garlic and a little more butter than the recipe called for. This is a quick, elegant and delicious dish that will impress your guests.

I made as instructed but used 1/2 sherry quantity of white wine. Was dry overall, not sure if from the substitution or not. Flavors are excellent so I will make again with a bit more liquid.

This was excellent! I did use more than a pinch of the herbs and I'm glad I did but that is the only change I made. All of the flavors come together nicely in this and it is one I would make again.

I made it as described except for the marjoram, which I couldn't find. I did add a bit more garlic because I like it, and I broiled it at the end to get the topping crispy. It was delicious.

It was good but really needed to increase the amount of bread crumbs a lot!  I mixed old bread and panko and then did the other measurements as listed in the recipe.    I also chopped fresh parsley and placed under the breadcrumbs.  I used 500 grams of shrimp and was enough for 2+ meals

I loved the concept and it was easy to put together but the flavors were just not there for me. Also, I baked it an extra 10 minutes and It still came out half raw.

On New Year’s Day I made king crab legs and hiker mignon for my family. My wife doesn’t like crab so I made her this shrimp dejonghe recipe.  SHE LOVED IT!!!  It was easy to make and was really flavorful. I substituted dry white wine and added a pinch of smoke paprika on top for color and flavor. I highly recommend this recipe.

I'm not sure what I did wrong.. The sherry overpowered  the dish and the bread crumbs never crisped up, so they were soggy.....

Very much like mine but I mix the cooked shrimp with the topping mixture before baking rather than just topping the shrimp with it.  That way, everything is well-incorporated.
