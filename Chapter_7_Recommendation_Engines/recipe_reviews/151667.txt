This is an excellent recipe. My fiance absolutely loved it. I have made this several times.  I recommend that onion powder is sprinkled on the chops.

I made this with some cream of mushroom soup that I had on hand and a bag of frozen asparagus stirfry mixed veggies. I seasoned the pork with a little pepper and seasoned salt before puting them in with the stuffing mix. This recipe is a definite keeper! So quick and easy and oh so good =)

Instead of using the mushroom soup, I use cream of celery soup(always use it instead of water in stuffing/dressing).  Chop up an onion and add it also...makes a difference!!

The stuffing/vegetable mixture was good, anyway.  I did not care at all for the pork chops.

This recipe was quick and easy, I added some spices to the Cream of Mushroom Soup, like sage, dry parsley, some fresh ground pepper, I also browned my Pork Loins, I baked for 35 minutes the next time I will only bake for 20-25 minutes so the Loins don't dry out.
