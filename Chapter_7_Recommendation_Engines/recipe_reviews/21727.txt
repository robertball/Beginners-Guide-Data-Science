My family came for a family reunion and I ended up making this cake 7 times during a 4 day period.  It was easy and everyone loved it.  It had a good texture.  I jazzed up the flavor by adding a seven up and powered sugar glaze.

This is the BEST!  I put 1-1/2 tsp. of lemon {I like the flavor} and 1/2 tsp. vanilla, instead of 1 tsp. each flavoring.  The texture was dreamy, as was the taste.  Left it for 1/2 an hour to cool, and it came out perfectly.  Cant say enough about it.  Thanks, Sandee

This cake is so moist. But make sure you let it cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes before you remove from pan and let cool completely before placing any cover over it. This cake is always a hit!

I made this cake 2 days ago, and it is already gone! My Fiance' and mother in law destroyed it before it even got a chance to cool! The only thing that I did differently was add 3 cups of sugar and 5 eggs. Its not listed on here, but I made a glaze to go along with it. To make the glaze,  you need  1/4 cup of 7 up and a 1/2 cup sugar. Cook in a saucepan until the sugar is dissolved.  While the cake is still warm, take a toothpick and punch holes through out the cake and pour the glaze over the cake. The glaze really made the cake yummy! I plan on making this cake again in the near future!

I loved the texture of the cake, but it didn't have much of a taste.  I would suggest adding any flavor that comes to mind.  This cake had no flavor.

I searched long and hard for a 7-up pound cake as good as those my friends used to make back home, and this is it! The cake is so delicate and flavorful that no glaze is needed.  (I never liked those anyway!)  Just a perfect cake.  Your friends and co-workers will LOVE it- mine did!

Great Cake! It came out great despite the fact that I forgot to add a second stick of butter. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tblsp of vanilla and lemon extracts. The cake really tasted good.

True pound cakes are dense.  So maybe it's just that you don't like pound cakes.

Thank you Sue for sharing this recipe.  I lost my copy many years ago during a move.  This cake is delicious and when I made it I added cream cheese frosting and placed the cake in the refrigerator and served it chilled.  GREAT!!!

This was not very good. I admit I cheated and used half margarine because I didn't want to use up all my butter. I was pretty nervous when a layer of grease formed and boiled around the edges. Also it was very heavy and dense. It also didn't have much flavor other that grease despite the large amount of vanilla I dumped in.

Love this cake but made a few changes 3 cups of sugar 5 eggs and 10 ounces of 7-up the cake was much lighter, very moist and full of flavor. I bake this cake every month for my mother who is 83 she said it reminds her of the cakes they baked back then.

This cake is very moist and came out perfectly.  The only problem is there isn't enough flavor.  The next time, I will add more vanilla and lemon to enhance the flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I have made this cake over 10 times and everyone loves it.  It is the best tasting pound cake ever.  The key is to remove from the pan after about 2 minutes because it will stick if you let it sit.

I was so excited to see this recipe since I had recently had 7up Pound Cake at a family owned restaurant.  I first noticed the batter was very thick, as other pound cakes I'd made were not.  I always test new recipes before the suggested bake time.  I checked this at 60 minutes and it was done.  I think it might only need to bake for 55 minutes.  Second, it was not a moist texture as expected.  I think it needs changing by possibly adding sour cream and/or oil like other pound cakes I've made.  I did like the taste of lemon, but this recipe needs revising.

Do not over cook as I did.  Take it out after 70 minutes. The cake will continue to cook while in the pan. Because I over cooked it , the cake tasted a litte dry and was not sweet enough for me so I added a lemon glaze and after that, I had to freeze some to keep from eating it.

Everyone loved this cake.  Only changes were that  I used cake flour and cream soda. I did not beat the cream and sugar for 20 minutes - only until light in color and fluffy - maybe 5 - 7 minutes.   Made for a campfire gathering and the cake was gobbled up.  I served with a variety of fresh fruit sauces and whipped cream I made to top it off.

Seriously irritated at this recipe. And it takes a lot for me to get irritated with sweets. I followed the recipe EXACT and this came out dry and tasteless. And it just fell apart! Pieces were breaking off and it just wasn't pretty. I tried to salvage it with a lemon-lime juice glaze and that helped but not enough for me to just flip out over. Good thing my Mom's Meetup Group cancelled this morning, I would have been embarassed to serve this. It might be that I overcooked it but reading through the reviews now, I know I'm not the only person who had that issue. I'd like to try it again but I don't want to get torked.

If you like a very moist pound cake that has a velvet smooth texture then you will love this pound cake. I fell in love with as well as the rest of my family. Try using cake flour (Swan Downs).

It's moist and flavorful. Made it exactly as directed but pulled it out at 65 mins. I did add the glaze that someone else suggested (1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup 7up melted over the stove). Also left it in the pan for over 30 mins before turning it over to remove it.

This recipe was good however not great. I  thought that the cake was lacking flavor the first day when I made it. It was not as moist as I thought it would be. The second day, it tasted much better and moister. I also added the 7 up glaze on top of 1/4 c 7-up and a 1/2 c white sugar. melt on the stove until sugar is dissolved. I would  deffinately make this again, but a day in advance to allow flavors to truely pull through.

My family loved the cake after I tweeked it a little. I added 3/4c 7up, zest of two limes and the juice of both also. Then I put a glaze on it using icing sugar, soda and juice of 1 lime and zest. Cake had a very nice flavor and not to sweet.

Made this cake today 9/4/2013 and half of the cake is already gone. My son said I should have made two. I followed the directions exactly. Once cake was out of the oven I poked holes on the top and pour a glaze I made with powder sugar, 7up, lemon extract and vanilla extract. I will be making this again and again!!!

I have made this cake a couple of times now, and it's always great. Had a little spare time while preparing my Thanksgiving dinner this year, and decided to make this for everyone.  I'm sure they will love it.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for years, but never rated it- until now. I made this for Thanksgiving 2012 and my son and nephew were begging me not to take it to my sister's house. And at dinner, I got so many compliments. My family really enjoys the citrusy flavor and sweetness of the cake. It's a dense cake, but not heavy and dry. And, it stands up well to a scoop of ice cream and fesh fruit (I usually slice strawberrys and put on top of it). I'm going to try this in mini bundt cakes and personalize the toppings.

My husband has often talked about 7up cake, but I had never had it and he didn't have a recipe.  I made this one last night for a gathering today and my husband had to have a taste while it was warm.  All he could say was "Wow!"  And then he had to have some more.  I ended up making another one this morning for our group.  And it was an instant hit there as well.  Such a good, easy recipe!  I did add more lemon extract (about a half teaspoon more)--by accident last night (the spout poured out faster than I expected) and on purpose today because the flavor was just right.  I also added a powdered sugar lemon glaze.  Just perfect!  Definitely will be making this again and again.

This recipe is very similar to the one my mother makes.  Her's calls for 3 cups sugar, 5 eggs and 1/2 tsp almond extract instead of vanilla.  Everything else is the same.  It is a very light flavored cake - just right for the summer.  Great topped with fresh/frozen strawberries or peaches mixed with sugar to form a glaze.

Really good & moist! My first try at pound cake and it is a keeper. I didn't have lemon extract, but did have fresh lemon so I used same amount of juice, came out great! I have tried many recipes over the years and have learned to make 1/2 a recipe to see if good or not before I waste ingredients. so I made this in a mini Bundt pan and still baked it about 55 minutes. Will make a whole recipe next time!

This was a good cake. However, The cake took longer to get done than the recipe specifies. So I had to cook it at least another 20 minutes, so I was scared that it wouldn't turn out right. In the end it was delicious.

My kids and friends Love this cake. It is so very moist. I was a little scared that i had to use crisco also but this ios the best seven-up recipe i ever used. I did cheat a little by adding 1 tbsp of vanilla instead of tsp. Adds more flovour. MMMMMMM good i say!! Thanks Sue for great recipe!!

Great recipe.  Make this for all holidays.  Recently my grandson was diagnose with Celia  .  He told me how much he missed 7 Up cake.  I made it with gluten flour.  He was so happy. Gluten  free 7up cake is now our family dessert.

This is such a great recipe! So tasty so moist! This recipe makes for great cupcakes too as I didn't have a bundt cake pan. I used 2 Tbs of orange zest in lieu of lemon extract because I didn't have that either. Turned out great! I sent it with my husband to share with coworkers at work, he said it was gone within minutes. Loved it!

This is the kind of recipe that makes you happy to bake! I used it as a base for a Boston Cream Pie, so omitted the lemon extract and doubled the vanilla. Followed the recipe otherwise, baked it exactly 70 minutes, cooled it for 1 hour before removing it from the bundt pan.  Use a heavy bundt pan; it's much easier to get good results if your pan doesn't wobble around when you handle it.  I put it back in the pan once it cooled completely and covered it with saran overnight. The next day I split it, filled it with Creme Patissiere lightened with a little whipped cream, and topped it with a simple dark chocolate ganache. Perfection!

I made this cake for the first time for Thanksgiving, it was a hit. I really liked the ease of the directions. I followed the steps but I did however take the advice of some f the prior reviews and added more more vanilla and lemon. I also used butter flavored shortening. My bunt pans where very short, so I divided it into 2 pans. This will be in my repertoire for many more years to come. Making two today for Christmas as gifts.
