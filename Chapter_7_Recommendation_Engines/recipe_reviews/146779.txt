I served this at a family gathering without mentioning the Splenda.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

This was wonderful, and I didn't even let the dressing chill before adding it to the slaw. I did let the entire thing chill for about an hour and a half though.

Wonderful recipe, not only was it delicious, but my friends did not know it was made with splenda.  Having family members that have diabetes they were able to enjoy without worrying about increasing their insulin.  Only after the meal did I shared with my friends, that it was made with splenda, they all wanted a copy of the recipe.  Thank you for making this recipe, diabetic friendly.  Definitely a keeper.  Did not change a thing in the recipe.
