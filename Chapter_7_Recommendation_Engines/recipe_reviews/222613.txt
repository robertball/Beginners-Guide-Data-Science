I used ground turkey and homemade taco seasoning in this pasta salad. I chose not to toss the corn chips into the whole bowl of pasta salad. As I served it I sprinkled Chili-Cheese Fritos over each bowl. This was a great quick dinner and a nice compromise for a mother that's sick of regular taco dinners and kids who can't get enough. I made homemade fry bread to serve with this. I would make this again but I think I would mix the sour cream into the french dressing next time and fold it in with the rest of the salad ingredients.

YUM! I had to use more dressing than called for (I used Catalina b/c I had it here) and served the corn chips on top instead of mixing them in b/c I didn't want them to get mushy. I served this warm b/c hubby requested it that way and I really wasn't sure if this was supposed to be warm or cold so... A very nice change from the usual and one that I would make again! Thanks for sharing.:)

I have been making this for at least 25 years! My family loves this. Great on a hot summer day. Now all my adult kids make it too.

I made a lower fat version that my family loved! We used lean ground beef reduced fat sour cream lite french dressing and lower fat cheese and substituted tortilla chips for corn chips. The beauty of this recipe is you can add "extras" if you like: sliced black olives are good and I chopped a handful of cilantro and squeezed fresh lime juice over it to make it to our liking. I garnished it with avocado slices too. The pasta is what makes this taco salad anything but ordinary -- tasty great mix of textures and good fresh meal to serve.

Family loved the uniqueness of this taco salad having pasta with it. I always have taco meat made ahead and froze in 1 lb. packages for quick meals. It came in handy with this recipe. I mixed part of the corn chips in the recipe and saved some to add to the top of the salad when served. I made 'My Grandmother's French Dressing' from AR for the French dressing the recipe called for. We had a delicious meal that will be repeated.

Only change I made was to skip the lettuce as I was taking it to a picnic...worked out well. I got several requests for the recipe.

Used ground turkey Chicken Taco seasoning packet & added sweet corn kernels. Also added sliced black olives. Forgot the corn chips and didn't miss them. It was so good! Will definitely make again.

Made with ground turkey and couldn't tell the difference (well definitely less grease when cooking up). Use the scoop-able sized corn chips and serve chips on side. Great salad option that I'll use for work pitch-ins.

Crowd pleaser. I doubled the recipe for unexpected guests coming for dinner. I did substitute green onion for white. I would recommend not adding chips until serving.

The flavors are very good and I liked the dish as a whole. However there was far too much pasta in proportion to the rest of the ingredients. I made it a second time using half of the pasta called for and it was much better. Even with half the pasta it still makes 4 -6 good servings. I served both the chips and the lettuce on the side and let everyone toss their own in this way you can still store left overs. A good and different dish!

For starters we did not use the sour cream at all. I made this with ground turkey instead of beef pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar cheese and spaghetti instead of spiral pasta. We bought Tostitos scoops instead of corn chips to scoop since I do not like wet chips but once we started eating it we completely forgot we had the chips till the next day. This was super good. I am not a fan of pasta salads at all but my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. I will be making this a lot over the summer!!!

My family really loves this dish. My kids all ask for it each week for dinner. It's crunchy and soft at the same time. The corn chips and french dressing are what make this for me. Thank you for submitting it.

Just made this for dinner tonight since it is so hot & muggy in upstate NY. This tastes wonderful however in my opinion you don't need the cheese sour cream and the chips which I didn't use any. I wanted to stay on the light side as one of the reviewers had mentioned so used ground Turkey and homemade taco seasoning. This is a keeper in my recipe book! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us all.

I really liked this recipe! It was easy to prepare and very tasty. I used ground turkey skipped the tortilla chips and omitted the sour cream but didn't feel cheated in anyway. This is a keeper.

We had this for dinner tonight and everyone thought it was pretty good (even for my 5 and 2 year old). I added half a green onion but would just leave it out next time. I cooked up the 1 lb of taco meat but halved this recipe which gave us 4 adequate portions without leftovers which I don't think would save well.

Family wasn't fond of this too many noodles and the sweetness of French just wasn't good with taco seasoned beef

My 9 year old loved it and asked for seconds. I used homemade taco seasoning and cooked onions, banana peppers and green peppers in with the ground turkey.
