This recipe was great! My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with celiac sprue and I have been searching for recipes for tasty gluten-free baked goods. These cookies reminded me a lot of the ones my mom made when I was a kid. The only changes I made were to use butter instead of margarine, and natural chunky-style peanut butter. Also, I dipped a fork in a bit of soy flour before pressing the dough balls down (in the familiar peanut-butter cookie pattern) to keep it from sticking. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best GF cookie I have had yet. The only problem is, the rest of my familly eat them instead of the flour versions and I have to constantly bake more. THANKS for this great recipe!

Absolutely delightful! I followed the recipe except I substituted King Arthur flour gluten free multi purpose flour instead of all the flours listed and they turned out great!

These were awesome! I've made them with teff flour in place of the potato flour, and I've also made them with almond butter too! Just delicious!

I used vegetable oil in place of butter, flaxseed and water in place of the egg, and stevia extract in place of he sugars. Also, I used all peanut butter instead of part cashew butter. They were great, although they didn't stick together that well.

I made these for a friend who cannot tolerate gluten, but I'll keep making them for everyone.  They are so easy and very tasty!  I substituted milk chocolate chips for the semisweet chips, pressing the large milk chocolate chips on the top and center of the cookies to prevent them from melting off the cookies, after finding that those I mixed into the batter sometimes separated from the cookie while baking.  How nice to find a recipe that didn't force me to buy expensive, hard-to-find ingredients!

This is a great GF cookie recipe. I love that they dont spread out thin like other GF cookies. I can even press them with a fork and they dont get too thin. I used regular butter instead of margarine (i can't have soybean oil which is in alot of margarine) and I substituted 1 1/2 cups Trader Joe's GF baking mix (because I can't have soy flour). Everyone loves them. Also great with chocolate chunks from Enjoy Life mixed in!

I made these today and they were great. I dont have all the fancy flours so I just used Bobs Red Mill Gluten free all purpose flour instead. The cookies came out soft but very tasty. For the last dozen we added chocolate chips.

Sadly my was oven not working, and I had to use the toaster-oven, adding some skim milk (because I thought the dough was a tiny bit dry), and not having soy flour, having to use coconut flour instead... they were great! I'd keep this recipe for sure! The only thing is that I'd add milk to it, so the dough and cookie isn't that dry. Great recipe!

Excellent. I used this recipe as-is to make peanut butter cup cookies, which I give as Christmas gifts every year. Even my picky 13-year-old nephew liked them. Finally I get to eat the cookies that I've been making for others.

I have a few people in my life that cannot eat gluten, and so I definitely appreciate seeing allergen specific recipes out there, so thanks ADAMSGRL for the recipe!
I decided to use what I already had for the flour, which was 3/4 C Red Mill Barns GF Flour and 3/4 C peanut flour (from Trader Joe's) instead of using the soy, tapioca and potato flours.  I also used unsalted butter instead of the margarine.
Overall I think these were really good cookies - they weren't too dry - which was a nice change for a gluten free cookie. They were a little bland for me, so next time I'll add in a little salt and then maybe roll the dough into sugar before baking them, to mimic another favorite cookie of mine. I added a chocolate mini-kiss to the tops of the cookie when they came out, just for fun. Overall I'm happy with this recipe and will make it again!

This really is the perfect peanut butter cookie! I made these for a dinner party for a friend who is allergic to gluten. He said they were the best gluten free cookies he has ever had. I could not be happier with this recipe...simple and delicious!

I found these cookies dry, like most gluten free recipes.  Also they were slightly too sweet for my liking, but that atleast is something that can be adjusted to individual taste during the preparation.  I would be curious to see how they turn out with chocolate chips added to them?!

My BF liked them a lot, and my wheat free lifestyle is new to him. I’m happy he’s happy, since I made them for him. ?? I used unsalted peanut butter so added about 1/4 tsp. Waited for 1st pan to brown so it cooked longer and got crispier than I wanted. I rolled bigger cookies on the 2nd pan, and didn’t cook them as long, liked the chewier texture better, but still would’ve liked a little more brown to them.  Tasty!

These are fabulous. I added 1/4 cup of gluten free flour and some coconut. This is the best gluten free cookie recipe I have found so far!

instead of the flours in the recipe, I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten free all purpose Baking flour, added 1/4 tsp xanthum gum, and put hershey chocolates in the middle... turned out scrumptuous!!!..

- be careful tho after taking out of oven, Let cookies sit on Cookie sheet a few minutes before taking off to enjoy or they will crumble.

I was pleasantly  surprised by this recipe. I couldn't tell the  difference in texture between a cookie made with all purpose flour and these made with soy, tapioca and potato starch. I did used salted butter which I had on hand.  My old peanut butter recipe has a tsp. of cinnamon in it which I will add to my next batch of these cookies. This is a good, basic peanut butter cookie.  I might try making them with coconut flour ..

These were absolutely delicious-- the entire family approved! I do admit they are a little dry but if accompanied by milk they are wonderful. I used Pillsbury GF multi-purpose flour as it is my favorite blend. At first they appeared to be melting but then they evened out and grew in size. I would say these are actually better than cookies with wheat due to their size. Definitely going to make these again. :)

I made a vegan version of this recipe to bring to work because I have both vegan and gluten free co-workers. I substituted 1/4 cup vegetable oil for the egg and used vegan "buttery sticks" in place of the butter. They turned out beautifully,  if a tad delicate.  They have the perfect peanut butter cookie flavor. Very pleased with this recipe.

Make sure the soy flour is ORGANIC, or it is Genetically Modified!!  I would substitute GF Oat flour or any other GF flour that is GMO Free.  Be careful of GF margarine products too as they often contain other GMO Soy ingredients.  I would try a coconut oil or organic spread.

These are delicious! Have made twice for my teen daughter who is eating gluten free these days. They disappear off the counter as everyone in the family is helping themselves.

Sounds great. I have been looking for gluten free recipes. However, just mixing 1 cup of peanut butter to 1 cup of sugar plus one egg is a set of more readily available ingredients for these peanut butter cookies. I had to bake the one inch dough balls at 350 degrees for a few minutes longer. This is tried and true. Try this version!
