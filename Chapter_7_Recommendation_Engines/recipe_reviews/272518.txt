Excellent & I made a few additions.  Added 1 Tbsp minced garlic to onions while sauteing & sliced mushrooms.

This was excellent.  I really wasn't sure what this would end up tasting like, but I would definitely make this again.  This would be considered a "company" meal.  I'm not much of a cook - I cook because we need to eat.  I used the dried herbs, but can't imagine how it would taste with the fresh ones.  But I followed the recipe pretty much as it is written.  Even the hubby liked it and he is very picky.  No, he wouldn't eat the spinach, but he thought it was good overall.

Enjoyed the meal.  Followed the recipe did not change any ingredients.  Put it over wide noodles.  It took longer then 30 minutes for the chicken thighs to bake.
