I made this last night with fresh peaches.  I will make this again w/ 2 changes: I will layer fresh peaches with the filling, creating several layers and leave off the glaze.  Everyone liked it just the way it was!

All I can say is, "WOW!"  This was a huge hit with my family!  It was so easy to make.  I would recommend it for any occasion.  I made two changes that you might consider trying if you like.  First, I used a graham cracker crust, and second, I put sliced, fresh strawberries on the crust first and then poured the pudding mixture over them.  The strawberries were a great compliment to the peaches!

This was a very good, refreshing dessert, great for summer. I also used a graham cracker crust, with low-fat milk, low-fat sour cream and sugar-free pudding mix. It tasted great. I really had to stir the glaze mixture constantly to keep it from clumping. Next time, I might dice the peaches and cover the whole top of the pie with them.

I wanted individual desserts so I used baked tart shells for this recipe.  The recipe will make about 18 "pies", using 1 tbsp mix per shell. I cut up the peaches into smaller chunks and placed them on top. Make sure the glaze is cool b4 spooning over the pie.  I brought a sample to my neighbor whom I consider a very good cook, and she told me they were to die for.  She requested the recipe right then.  A perfect summer dessert.  You must try it! Thank you, this is sooooo good.

This pie was very good! I had to bring a peach pie to an office party and it I didn't want to bring a traditional one because 3 others had to bring peach pie also. Everyone raved over this one and asked for the recipe. It is a very good cool summer treat!

This is a delicious pie only I used a graham cracker crust.  Also I sliced the peaches even thinner to make cutting easier.  Thank you for sharing it.

I made this pie and was not satisfied with the results.  I would use a graham cracker crust if I were going to make it again, and I would use two cans of diced peaches to top instead of sliced, and leave off the glaze, I found it to be very strange.  The texture was nice, but it was not very sweet and did not have the strong peach flavor I desired.  I can say that it was easy to make.

A good idea and very easy to make. However, I didn't care to much for the flavors together. Sorry :(

I was not crazy about this. I made the glaze and thought it lacked flavor and was very.....odd. I made another glaze using sugar, cornstarch and peach jello mix. Much better and much prettier.

My daughter, the pie maker,who is now 9, made this for the annual pie contest last summer.  It took second place.  We added some fresh whipped cream around the outside, and a fresh blueberry in the middle (I uploaded the pic) and we took the time to arrange the peaches in a swirl pattern.  And it tastes good, the filling is not too sweet or overpowering, to let the flavor of the peaches come through.

I loved the cream filling - tasted just like vanilla cheesecake!  I tweaked this a bit to suit the ingredients I had on hand.  I used a graham cracker crust instead of a pastry one.  I only had frozen peaches on hand so I chopped them into large chunks, put them in a saucepan over medium heat, mixed the lemon juice, a bit of water and the cornstarch and added to the peaches along with 2 tablespoons of ginger jam then cooked until it all jelled up a bit.  Poured the peach mixture over the cream mixture and chilled.  Loved it.

I made this for a friend's birthday. Super easy and very good. Even my husband, who doesn't care for peaches, liked it. I also used a premade graham craker crust, so it was a nobake recipe. I laid the peaches in a circular, "starburst" pattern, and put a maraschino cherry in the center for extra pizzaz.

I used 4 cups of peaches and I did not glaze them. I just piled them on top of the pudding mix in the pie shell.  Turned out a little messy when you cut it, but tastes great.

This pie is awesome. I had so many compliments on it. Next time though I am going to use a graham crust to see which one I like better. Im also going to try diced peaches.

It was ok.  My daughter liked it without the peaches better so I made it again and instead of putting any peaches on it, I took an 8 oz tub of cool whip and folded it into the filling and added a about 1/8 tsp of almond extract.  My whole family loved it that way.  Won't make this recipe again.

My family enjoyed this but I agree with reviews that say the glaze isn't good.  Next time I'll leave the glaze off.  The glaze tasted strange to me.  I think a glaze could work for this, but using a different recipe.  I also used a graham cracker crust which combined with the pie filling was delicious.

This was a real hit in my house.  We finished the pie in one night! Like others reviewers suggested, I used a graham cracker pie crust.  I used fresh peaches and diced them up and put them on top of the graham cracker crust and also added some fresh blueberries.  I then put in the pudding mixture and added more peaches on top in the shape of a sun.  It looked pretty and tasted great.

The recipe was so-so for me. I think I wasn't the biggest fan of the custard/pudding part..it wasn't very sweet or particularly flavorful. However, the recipe was very simple to use, not intimidating and the finished product did look like the pictures..so that's nice for a beginner pie maker.

I used a store brand canned apples  and  a graham cracker crust.
I only had a little sour cream so i added table cream to make the difference.  About to make 2 more as gifts.  Outstanding!!!

Wow!  I added almond extract to pudding, and it's the best light custard!  Could use it to make a trifle, or use any fruit or sweet wine reduction.

Very Yummy! I used the Del Monte Raspberry flavored peach slices cut into small pieces for easy cutting and serving, and it was delicious! I also mixed the peaches and slightly cooled glaze together, and then topped the pie with it, very easy! Perfect for a summer pie too, and perfect light tasting pudding/custard flavor. Not too sweet, hit the spot, and I will be making this again for sure!!! Thankyou!

I loved this recipe.  However I did change a couple of things.  I used fresh peaches, because how can you not when they are in season!  I used fat free pudding and low fat sour cream and skim milk.  It worked out great.  I did omit the glaze part. I had no peach syrup from the can, because of the fresh peaches so I decided to scrap it altogether.  It was a nice refreshing yummy tasting pie.  Not heavy at all.  Might try making my own crust next time.
