So rich, so fattening, so good.  But you MUST make sure all the cake mix is covered with the melted butter.  I use 1/2 cup instead of 1/4.  You can also use cherrie pie filling, blueberry, peach and raspberry.  They all are delightful.

This was one of those moments the family will be laughing about years from now when they want to tease mom.. "remember that awful dessert that ended up in the trash!?!"  After following the directions I ended up with gobs of dry cake mix on top. I figured I could remedy this easy enough by spooning off all the dry stuff.  They we tried eating it.  The cake mix that had gotten moist was a gooey mess. The overall taste was SOOOOO rich and sweet that it was just awful.  Since then I've read the comments and see that adding more butter would have helped with the dry mix on top.  But what about the gooey part?  Did it need to bake longer?  There wasn't any indication as to how well done it should look before removing it from the oven.  Even if I baked it longer it would still be way to sweet and rich.  This experiment ended up in the trash.

I have made many variations of this recipe, but never with apples...DELICIOUS. At my 6 year old's request, we used Duncan Hines Caramel cake mix, and it was a sensational combination!!!

I make a recipe that is the same concept as this one except I use 2 large cans of peaches with lite syrup.  The syrup from the peaches bubbles through the cake mix therefore mixing with the butter which forms a crust instead of just powder on top.  I think if the pie filling had more liquid or juice it would help.  I will give it a try next time.  Also cinnamon can be sprinkled over the top for extra flavor and I always serve my warm with vanilla ice cream!

With a little bit of tweaking, this is wonderful!  I simply used more butter. Enough to almost completely cover the top of the cake mix. I stirred the mix around a little, to ensure most of the cake powder was covered in butter. I think sprinkled a little water on top to help absorb more of the cake mix.  I cooked for about 45 minutes and then served warm. It was very very popular.

Make the cake mix then you won't need as much [melted butter mixed in the apple pie filling.  Add: more cinnamon, fresh grated nutmeg.  If you have never used fresh grated nutmeg you certainly must, it is a completely different taste, you use more than store bought ground nutmeg.  Spices are old to start with, & should be thrown away after a year.  They loose their flavor that fast.  Not herbs.  From an expert.  To a housewife they taste the same for years, not so.

I forgot about this recipe.  I used to make this all the time as a teen.  (I used 1 can filling & 1/2 cake mix with a stick of butter.)  This stuff is SO good!

This recipe didn't taste very good.  I added more butter because it didn't have enough to get all the cake mix covered.

I made this for casual company last night and everyone had rave reviews!! It was so moist and dense, but not heavy. I changed it up just a bit. I used sliced apples instead of apple pie filling (not gelatinous), I melted a stick of butter and added cinnamon, ground nutmeg, ground cloves and ground ginger to my own taste and then mixed it all up to moisten the cake. It was supurb. Moist and slightly sticky.....yummmmmmm!! Thanks, Paula!!

I wish I would have read the other review prior to making this one.  You MUST mix the butter into the cake mix prior to baking for it to turn out right.  I didn't do this and ended up having to stir the entire thing up after cooking for 30 minutes.  Once I stirred it up and baked it 15 more minutes, it tasted great.

What a delight! This was a very easy recipe. I did however change a few things. First to my apple pie filling I added cinnamon and brown sugar. Second mixed up the cake mix according to the box and then poured it on top. Third I nixed the butter because I already used butter in the mix. Lastly I had to cook it an extra 5 minutes.

I have always made this with canned peaches in syrup. I thinly slice 1 stick of butter and making sure it evenly covers the cake mixture on top.  I also sprinkle 1/2 cup chopped nuts on it. Comes out so good and it can't be any easier! You can definately use different canned fruit or fruit pie fillings, but the syrup from the canned fruit really goes nice with this as it does seep through the cake topping. Can serve with cool whip, frozen yogurt or ice cream! Simple and yummy!

This was really delicious. I like sweets so it wasn't too sweet for me/us. After reading the complaints about the mixture, I put the cake mix in a separate bowl and poured the melted butter into it, added some cinnamon, almond flavoring and mixed it until it was like a crumb topping. Super easy and delicious.

I made this for company and it was the worst tasting dessert I have ever had. It was like eating unbaked cake mix. I ended up throwing away the rest of the pan. It was easy to made but tasted awful.

Great-once you make a few changes.  The best advice (partially from other recipes, partially from me): is 1) use the lite apple pie filling.  It's less sweet and gooey.  2) stir in apple pie spice in the filling.  3) Use a butter recipe cake mix with a stick and a half of better.  4) Bake about 37 minutes (like it says on the cake mix).

I took into consideration some of the advice and used 1/2 cup of butter, which I melted and then added the cake mix directly to it. Then I spread it over the apples. I also cooked it for 40 minutes. It is very good. I think I will try a chocolate cake with cherries - instant Black Forest Cake - YUM!

I halved the recipe, and used white cake mix (which I combined with the butter before putting it on the fruit), since that's what was in the pantry.  I baked it for 40 min in a glass deep dish pie pan.  It turned out well.

very easy to make....i mixed the butter with the cake mix until it was crumbly and put it on top of the apples. i baked for about 45 minutes and it tasted good, but very, very sweet. maybe too sweet. i could only do a few bites before it was too much for me.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I add cinnamon to the apples and I find that I use a lot more butter than the recipe here calls for.  If you don't cover the top completely it will not crisp up it will stay powder.  I usually serve it with ice cream or excellent with whip cream.  Very easy and fast recipe.  Always a hit at every party.  When I tell people how to make it they are amazed at how simple.

Absolutely fabulous, and SO EASY! It's perfect for last minute dinner plans, and since there's nothing to mess up measurement wise, I even let my son help out!

One thing I have modified- I mix the cake batter (I find Duncan Hines yellow batter best) and the butter ( I use a FAT half cup) together in a bowl with a large fork first, then sprinkle on top of the apples. It just suits our tastes better, and ensures no hard or burned topping spots.

This recipe is ok, but I recommend using only half a cake mix.  Make sure to cook it long enough, or you'll end up with goo!

we love this recipe. I have adjusted it to fit our tastes-
increased butter to 1 cup, and before sprinkling cake mix over apples, I sprinkle apples with about 1-2tbls. lemon juice(this makes the apples slightly tart- minimizes some of the sweetness)and also about 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Then top off with cake mix and melted butter.  I make this often for pot lucks and never have any left over.  Hope this helps for those of you who are concerned about the sweetness.

To be perfectly honest, I am 14 years old and and never cooked in my life. The pie came out ok, since I have never done this before. My only mistake was opening the oven every 5 sec so it took longer to bake and I made my own apple filling, but I forgot to carve out the skill. A+++ I would definitly use this recipe again

I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was impossible to stir the cake mix and butter after it was on the apples.  I ended up having to put about twice as much butter on to cover all the mix.  I thought the flavor was too sweet and it could have used some spices.  I would not recommend this recipe.

We made Cherry Delight with cherry pie filling and Swiss Chocolate cake mix because that's what I had in the cupboard. LOVED IT! The Boy and I ate the whole pan tonight after supper (1/2 recipe so 8x8" pan ~ oink, oink). I read the reviews first and picked up a couple pointers: I used double the butter (I'm not freaky about fat and calories with my desserts ~ obviously) and I mixed the butter into the cake mix instead of drizzling it over top. It took about 10 minutes longer to bake. Gotta go do a double work-out now!

If you crave something sweet and easy this is the recipe for you. I read the reviews first so I knew to mix the butter and the cake mix first. It turned out great. I took it to a family picnic and everyone loved it.

I made this for Christmas dinner (2002), and my whole family LOVED it. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used more butter than was called for. This is a great, simple recipe. Absolutely loved it.

This is a quick and easy dessert. Like another reviewer suggested, drizzle more butter over the cake mix to make sure it is completely covered. I also like to add a little cinnamon to the cake mix.

I mixed 2 cans of cherry pie filling with french vanilla cake mix thoroughly and poured it in the pan no butter. It was great! Give it 5 or 10min. more baking time.

This was GREAT. I made my own "pie filling" with sliced organic Granny Smith apples that I cooked slightly in vanilla sugar water and thickened with a cornstarch slurry, then folded in almost two teaspoons of homemade apple pie spice. (I don't keep pie filling on hand.) I also used a low-sugar yellow cake mix. This was great at cleaning out one of the many boxed cake mixes in my pantry and made a semi-homemade dessert for my boys after a long, hard day. NOTE: I strongly suggest you make your own "filling" if you can. I used 6 medium sized apples and for the "juice", I used 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. If you cut the butter into thin slices and layer over the dry cake mix, it turns out much better.

After reviewing everyone's comments I made this recipe with 5 fresh granny smith apples and 9 ounces of yellow cake mix (half of a box), 1 tbsp cinnamon and 2 tbsp sugar.  I also used 3/4 cups butter.  I baked it 35 minutes! It was absolutely perfect.

Delicious!!!  Definite 5 star here.  I did mix the butter and cake mix prior to spreading on top.  I think that worked out a lot better than trying to mix over the apple pie filling.  Also I sprinkled it with some cinnamon and sugar after it came out of the over.  SOOOOOO easy.

Very Easy, I did use 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter, and I goofed, I mixed the butter with the cake mix, until the cake mix was all wet... When baking, the aroma was WONDERFUL!, & it was very very yummy, even with my mishap!!  I will make this again, It's a Keeper at my house!!

Absolutely wonderful! I made a few changes. Made my own apple pie filling because I had a lot of apples that needed to be used! I mixed about a stick & a half of melted butter in with my double pudding Pillsbury cake mix. Everyone loved it & several people wanted the recipe.

From other reviews I read it seemed as though this would be a very sweet dessert.  I decided to improvise and use some gravenstein apples (tart apple), add a some sugar and some cinnamon and a little cloves(My apples were frozen so I heated them first in a pan on the stove.).  I then used this mixture to replace the pie filling called for in the recipe.

Very easy and very good! I've made this twice.  The first time I made a boo boo and melted 2 sticks of butter instead of 1.  The second time I did it right.  Either way is very good but I personally liked the "boo boo way" better, it was a bit less sweet that way.  My family can't wait for me to make it again though.  Definitely one for the recipe book.

I used this recipe for a function I needed to attend. It was a big hit! I made one in apple and one in cherry w/chocolate. They were both great. Very easy recipe to make. I made one the way the recipe said and one the way that others said by mixing the butter into the mix first. The one I mixed together first came out the best and so I redid the other and it was great as well. Thanks for the tips I definitely would NOT have made this again with out those tips because the cake mix doesn't moisten if you don't cover every inch with butter!!

Well, I couldn't find the recipe I usually use, so looked for one to make Hubby something with apples. He was suggesting one that used the cake mix topping. I found this one and tried it right to the recipe, except I added a little oatmeal to the topping for extra flavor.   I was not really happy with it, and won't make this one again. It was so sweet it made the roof of my mouth itch!  Cut the brown sugar IN HALF and it might be a lot better.  I used granny smiths too, so it wasn't sweet apples/sweet sugar situation.  The topping got too hard as well. I attributed some of that to my adding some oatmeal, but still... it wasn't what I was after at all, and way way too sweet as written.

Greasy where the butter melted in, dry and gritty where the cake mix didn't get enough butter. Cloying and rich. I checked it at 28 mins, saw that it was not going to turn out and just stirred it all up. At least it was edible. Not doing it again - sticking to crumbles and bettys.

Wowza! This is the easiest desert EVER. Its so good! My kids are gobbling it up as I type. About 1/2 way through the baking time, I pulled it out, and sprinkled water on the dry parts. Worked wonderfully.

I make a similar recipe using a 20 oz can of cherry pie filling along with a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple or chunks.  I also top with the butter just cut in small piece evenly spread over top (not necessary to melt prior) then add chopped pecans over top and press into cake mix. It is a huge hit every time I make it.

I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the 1/4 cup, and I mixed it in the cake mix before I put it on top of the apple filling.  It turned out nicely.

After reading the reviews and only using 3 ingredients I hoped this would be quick and tasty.  I decided to use 1 can of fried apples with cinnamon instead of 2, and 1/2 half box of cake mix..  I decided to use a loaf pan and place some of the cake mix on the bottom of the dish.  I then put in can of apples and topped with the rest of the cake mix.  I drizzled the butter and juice from the apple can over the cake mix.  I baked 35 minutes.  Mine turned out very sweet.  It may have been my choice of canned fried apples.  Next time I will try an unsweeted canned apples or fresh apples in season.

This is a great recipe because it is so easy!  It is great served warm with vanilla icecream.  I used blueberry pie filling and it was fabulous.  Next I will use cherry, then apple and then blueberry again.  You will love this easy recipe and you will want to make it again and again.

I goofed when I made this recipe and put it in a smaller dish, so it took longer to cook.  But when my in-laws had it they loved it.  They even kept half. I added some dashes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to the apples and it added a lot of flavor to the apples. This is so easy to make it's definately a keeper.

I tried this recipe one evening  when I had my inlaws, father and brothers over for dinner.    They all loved it , And so did me and my husband.  Usually I will try a recipe on my husband and see if he likes it, then I will have everyone over to try it.  This time I just made it without even  trying it out and they loved it.  Its easy, and delicious.  Thanks!

This was vwry easy and very good.  It was a huge hit, but did have some comments that it was too sweet.  Definately needed more butter.  Before adding the cake mix, I added cinammon and walnuts to the apples and it gave this recipes some added flavor.  Will definately make it again.

Brought this to a party and received rave reviews.  Several people had seconds.  I made this into a trifle, here are my modifications:

- used cherry pie filling and chocolate cake.  Mixed butter in with the choc cake as per reviewers suggestions.
- when all cooked and cooled, mixed it all up.
- Put one layer of cake on bottom and whipped cream on top.  Did this 3 times to make a nice Black Forest Cherry Trifle in a glass bowl.
Thank you for recipe!

I baked this recipe for approx. 45 minutes, until it was golden and crispy on the top. I used a stick and a quarter of butter and actually split the recipe into twp cake pans. It was absolutely fabulous. Everyone loved it-mserved with cool whip on top. I would definitely bake this one again.

This dessert was so easy to make - and tasted wonderful, melt-in-your-mouth good!  The only thing I noticed was that I had to bake it 45 minutes instead of 30 minutes so that the apples would rise up and moisten the cake mix.

I liked this but had to pour extra melted butter over top. Next time, I will try mixing softened butter into cake mix before putting on top of apples.

I don't think I'll try this one again.  The cake batter sprinkled on top that did not have butter drizzled on stayed as a powder.  It was too sweet and it tasted exactly like uncooked cake batter with apple filling underneath.

It turned out all right, but only because I read the other reviews.  It needs to be cooked about 10 mins longer and needs enough butter to cover all the cake mix.  It is extremly sweet and the ice cream does help alot.  Although it tasted all right I probably won't make it again.

I'll never make this one again! Although it was quick and easy, most of it went into the garbage, and I have a family of 6 with 4 sweet loving kids. We put vanilla icecream on top to try and cut the sweetness, but the kids asked if they could scrape the apple crumb part into the garbage. I thought it was ok when mixed with the icecream, but nothing I'd want again.

After reading several negative reviews, I tried a twist.  I sprinkled only 1/2 a box of cake onto the fruit.  Also, instead of just apple pie filling, I mixed 1 apple and 1 strawberry pie filling together, put into bottom of the pan first.  After drizzling the butter on top, I gently mixed the cake mix with the butter.  I baked it for 40-45 minutes, and it came out wonderful!  The top was crispy and yummy.  My boys all loved it (got 3), so we will definitely make this again.

updated review 2018: i’ve made this recipe numerous times over the last decade, as it’s become a super easy family favorite. i recommend 3/4 - 1 cup of butter on top of the cake mix, making sure to distribute with a spatula. for the filling, using 1 can of lite apple pie filling plus 1 or 2 cans (15oz) of canned peaches in lite syrup (drain most of the syrup out). too with butter cake mix (spread evenly) and butter on top. perfection!

previous review from 2007: made this tonight, but not with apples... used 1 can blueberry and 1 can strawberry filling, and butter yellow cake mix. came out great, but VERY owerpoweringly sweet. i cant think of a way to cut out the sweetness of it... but its good served warm over vanilla ice cream. i'll probably make it again, maybe find some lower sugar content filling.

This was good but way to sweet. I also expected it to be more like cake but it was more like apples with a crunchy topping. Not to bad though,I might consider making it again.

I make this all the time with various fruit fillings.  I reduce the amount of cake mix for a crispier taste or add more butter for more "cake".  I like the butter recipe cake mixes better than regular yellow cake.  I stock up on these ingredients when I shop so I always have an easy, fast, dessert.

This is basically my mom's dump cake recipe with crushed pineapple added to  2 cans of pie filling.  I mixed melted butter in with the cake mix and added 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I don't have a pastry blender so this was a little harder than just putting pats of butter over the dry mixture.  In any case, it turned out delicious. Baked at 325 for about 40 minutes until golden. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

This is so easy! Make sure and keep mixing small amounts of butter into your cake mix until its all moistened (you'll definately use more than called for) - it should be crumbly, but not wet. This is so easy! Delicious w/ vanilla ice cream!

I added more butter as suggested, mixed with the cake mix and cooked it for 45 minutes.  This was easy, but WAY too sweet even with ice cream for us.

This tastes so good warm.  Vanilla ice cream is a plus with this. It is a little powdery if you don't sprinkle butter over all of it.  I recommend using a table spoon more of butter than was suggested.  Make sure that you drizzle butter over the whole cake or it stays powdery.  Otherwise this was so easy and quick to make.  MMM...I want some more!!

I have never tried this but my sister in laws have.  I gave them some Pampered Chef products for Christmas and wanted to present it in an attractive basket.  I thought this recipe would be perfect: one has 5 kids and no time and the other can't cook.  I included the kitchen items, the recipe and the ingredients in the basket.  Not only was the basket a hit, but both said the recipe was WONDERFUL!  Their kids loved it and the non-baker's husband has asked that I scout more recipes that his wife can actually make! :)  I will have to try it now!

It was delicious! I used about 2 1/2 cans of pie filling. I'm sure 2 would have been fine. It I wanted something a little more filling. I baked it for 60 minutes at 350. Everyone loved it.

This wasn't as wonderful as I hoped it would be. It was very simple to prepare but the texture was gooey and weird. I did read the comments and instead of using 1/4 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup and mixed with the cake batter before spooning onto the apple filling. It just never seemed "done" baking at all. Not to mention it wasn't the most attractive looking thing in the world... Which I could over look because of the ease to make and if it had a good taste and texture, but it didn't. I might try to make this again but if I do, I will tweak it a whole lot more.

Easy recipe to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Similar to other reviewers I incorporated cinnamon and nutmeg into the apple filling and in the cake mix.  I also doubled the butter to ensure it covered the cake and I mixed the butter on top to ensure all of the cake mix was incorporated.  The next time I make this I will use frozen apples and pie fie filling

My Mom made this alot back in the 70's. She never melted the butter. She would cut thin pats and lay over the top. Covered evenly as it melted. Very seldom were there any dry spots. It is very rich but so very good.

Yummy! I used the golden butter cake mix, and melted extra butter as per other reviewers suggestions. I mixed the cake mix and 1/2 cup butter in a separate bowl. Added more butter until it had a dough ball shape after mixing with my hands. Put the apples in the pan and then tore up the dough over them evenly. Put some apple pie seasoning on top and baked accordingly. Very yummy. I am going to try a variation next time with more cake mix, a little on the bottom and the rest on top. This would be awesome with ice cream!

This tasted really good but it turned out kind of runny. I was expecting it to be thicker. I guess maybe I didn't cook it long enough or something.

Loved it! Took this to a reunion and came home with 2 pieces left! Im not sure where the too sweet reviews come from...ours was just fine. I used 1 can of filling, butter yellow mix, and 1.5 sticks of butter. Next time I will make sure to have 2 cans! Do mix the butter into the cake mix first, it makes for a cakier tasting topping! Thanks!

This is GREAT!!! I actually did mix the butter into the cake mix first and worked fantastic. I didn't use yellow cake mix, I used butter pecan and let me tell you it is awesome. I will be making this for many people for Christmas gifts.

This was so simple to make as well as great tasting! It is sweet but I love that. Even my husband who isn't a big sweet eater liked it! Next time, I think I will mix the butter with the cake mix first before trying to spread it on as suggested by a previous post. Thanks for the recipe!

This stuff is great. I changed one thing, I used unsweetened apples and mixed a little cinnamom in the apples, I also needed to use more butter than you suggested. I brought this to coffee hour at church today and everyone loved it. I made two trays and wish I had made more as there was none left for me! Great recipe!

This tastes just like cake mix and canned apple filling. Definately needed to cook for more than 30 minutes. This is a cobbler, the cake mix is going to become crumbly on top of the apples.  I would stick to a more traditional cobbler recipe.

Very easy, very yummy!  We had to use a little more butter to cover all the cake mix and we baked it for closer to 45 minutes but it came out PERFECT!  Everyone at the family get-together loved and it and there was NO leftovers.  I made two desserts and they were both big hits (both from this site - the other was Chocolate Eclair Dessert).  YUMMY!

i made this 2 days ago but with 2 cans of peaches in lite syrup.  the first time i served it hot & it was a big hit, but i thought it was too sweet.  but then yesterday i served it cold and it was a HUGE hit too!  and less sweet, for some reason.  also, i didn't use any butter but kind of pushed the cake mix down into the syrup so it would all get moistened and cook right.  (a little bit healthier!?) it was reallllly delicious!  SO EASY!  thanks!!

This "dump cake" recipe is one of our family's favorites.  I've made it with all different kinds of fruit, and even mixed up pumpkin pie filling and used a spice cake mix on the top.  It's basically just a cobbler, so bake it as you would a cobbler.  It does make it a litle easier to mix the butter and cake mix first, but not necessary.  My mom never mixes her first, and it is always perfect.And no offense to anyone, but desserts are supposed to be sweet!  :)

I have been making this dessert for a couple of years and was delighted to see that someone else enjoys it too. The best topping for this dessert is vanilla ice cream. Just perfect.

This was pretty good.  I was nervous when I took it out of the oven because the cake mix still looked like powder.  I mixed everything together in the baking dish and let it sit for about 10 minutes.  It wasn't pretty, but my husband and I both enjoyed it with some vanilla ice cream.

I was a little confused by the recipe, since the cake mix is just sprinkled on top and not mixed with anything. It was pretty good, though the cake mix did stay powdery. I served it with a vanilla custard sauce and this helped take away some of the sweetness.
