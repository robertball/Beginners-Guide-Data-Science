This is an excellent dish, though I did make some adjustments. Those who said this was almost a dessert were not joking. This *is* a dessert! Texture is that of a chiffon/whipped sweet potato pie, that close southern cousin to pumpkin pie.

I decreased the sugar to 2/3rds but could have cut it back even more and been happy.  The topping really provides enough sweetness. 

For those with nut allergies, I substituted 2/3 cup dry oatmeal for the pecans, and just toasted it in a non-stick frying pan with the butter until very lightly browned. Add the brown sugar and keep stirring over medium heat until sugar melts and *just* starts to clump. add the flour. The crunchy sugar and oats provides the same/similar texture of the nuts.

This sweet potato casserole is just like the one they serve at Damon's Restaurant (if anyone else craves it as much as my husband)!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving, with a few adjustments.  I made it the week before following the directions exactly and it was waaaaaaay too sweet.  Then for Thanksgiving, I more than doubled the amount of sweet potatoes (8 cups, made from 4 giant potatoes mashed) and then it was perfect.  I also added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon which deepen the flavor.  My husband loved it.

Tried this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit! Sweet potatoes taste 'custardy' with the egg. A new standard at our house.

I only used half the white sugar and substituted walnuts and pistachios (left over from Christmas cookies...) Delicious!

I didn't quite know what to expect with this recipe.  I mistakenly bought a sweet potato (instead of a parsnip) and thought I'd try to find an interesting recipe.  I liked the topping, though I used pistachio nuts instead of pecans.  I just couldn't get used to the texture.

This recipie is delicious. I dont like sweet potatos but LOVED this. However, next time I make it I am only going to use a half cup of sugar. A whole cup makes it too sweet.

It's very delicious and very sweet.  Play with the amount of sugar you use to find what's right for your family.

I didn't have any pecans, and I used cane sugar instead of white and brown sugar, as well as adding a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to the sweet potato mix.
It's quite sweet; next time I think I'll cut down the amount of sugar I use.

So yummy & a hit at Thanksgiving. Like some of the reviewers said, I could have used less sugar...it's sweet enough with the topping!

This is a amazing base. I made several changes and it turned out wonderfully, not too sweet and very flavorful.  

I cut back the sugar  because it's way too sweet. I used just 1/2 cup of both the white and brown sugar. 

I also wanted to turn the flavor up because it was a bit bland without spices. To the sweet potato mixture I add 1 tlbsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, a pinch of cloves, ginger and orange zest.  For the crumble I added 1tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. 

It was a total winner. Gone in less than a hours.

Well I made changes because I pre-roasted my sweet potatoes in chunks. So I added half the sugar, cinnamon, a dash of cloves and butter to the roasted potatoes. Then I made the crumble topping as written. Smells great so I think it will be good...

We really enjoyed this with dinner last night. I will cut back on the sugar the next time just because you can without hurting the taste. This crisp is sweet but not too sweet. It is as good cold as it is warm. I used this as a side dish but can see making this as a dessert.

Everyone in the family loved this one! I only used 2/3 cup of white sugar as suggested by others and thought it was a good amount. I did add cinnamon to the sweet potatoes (just sprinkled some in).

My sister-in-law served this at a family dinner a few years ago, and now we always request it. It's the best!  I personally don't like pecans, so I substituted 2 packages of vanilla flavored instant oatmeal. The topping was a little gooey at first, but after it had cooled some, it was perfect, and very rich!

This is an excellent recipe. We all love it. I just blended the pecans because of my toddlers.
