Great.  I only had regular couscous on hand and I cut it down to about 2 cups cooked. I had to add a little more balsamic and a little garlic salt and I was in love with this super easy dish!!  Next time I'll double the recipe because as a main dish two adults and a two year old demolished this instantly:)

This recipe was great!  It was missing a tiny bit of flavor so I added some garlic and onion powder (I wish I added fresh garlic!).  I also added a bit more balsamic then the recipe called for.  I also added a touch of soy sauce.  Other than that it was delish!

Made with quinoa and without bell pepper, plus added some garlic salt per one of the other reviews. Very easy source of vegetarian protein!

This recipe had so much potential but the balsamic vinegar completely killed it for me.  The roasted vegetables were so delicious prior to dousing them with an oil / balsamic vinegar concoction.  I will try the overall concept again but definitely will not use this recipe.

This was gross and boring, and far too much oil. Perhaps could be saved with some herbs and less oil?

This is great!  I did use quinoa instead of couscous.  I also added a beet because I needed to use it, and I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil.  Absolutely delicious.  One of the best salads I've made!

Made with brown rice in place of couscous.  We had it for main coarse and the family ate every bite.  Will make again.  Added other fresh veggies I needed to use up.
