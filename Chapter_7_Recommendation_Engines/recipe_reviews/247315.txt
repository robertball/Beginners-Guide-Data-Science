Ok, it taste good but very watery looks nothing like the picture, followed instructions perfectly. I was looking for some chili verde but can’t find how to make the authentic version. Can someone help me find the authentic version as a chili Verde burrito

I've made this several times now with whatever leftover white meat I have on hand... turkey, chicken or pork.  Everyone loves it!

Loved it.  In addition to doubling the Pasilla peppers, I added canned mild green Chiles.  Also, I thickened it by adding a 1/4 cup of flour just after sautéing the onions.

Oh my verde this is one of my favorites. Really fun to make. As leftovers, it really soaks up the broth so don't be shy about it. The flavors were perfect. A nice char on the peppers is a must, really makes all the difference. Will make again, again anf again!

Family loved it. It took longer than 50 minutes, but it was worth it. I used half the broth and had some tomatillo sauce leftover. I added sliced avocados with lime juice, a dollop Greek yogurt, and Mexican white cheese.  Yum!!!
