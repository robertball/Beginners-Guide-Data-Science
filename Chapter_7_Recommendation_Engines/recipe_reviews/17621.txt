I have to differ on this one.  This is one of the best cakes and is one of my favorite.  The original posting (I'm assuming inadvertently) left out one of the ingredients, but it looks like it has now been corrected.  If you had bad luck with it because of this, my advice would be to try it again.

This recipe was not reveiwed for accuracy and the frosting recipe was not a good one...there were not enough "wet ingredients".  I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone.  The cake was not flavorful at all...not a good one for sure!
