I’ve seen this recipe so many times over the years that it makes my head spin (and there was an identical recipe on this site prior to this recipe being posted).  Just be sure to let it cook for a while, so the alcohol cooks out out of the sauce and you’re left with that deep bourbon flavor.  It’s simple, and it never fails to please.

Yum, I was looking for something simple and tasty for our 4th of July neighborhood bbq. I've never had these before - really impressed with the flavor and so dang simple.  We made them tonight as a snack - just to test the booze dogs out.  Oh snap! So good, my husband is polishing them off as I type this review - thanks so much. Cooked a little longer (as recommended by another review) - delicious.  I'm sure this will be a hit this holiday weekend!

My mom made this for parties for as long as I remember. We always sautéed 1/2 an onion in butter with the hot dogs. This works best with less dense hot dogs like turkey , it holds the flavor better and once the dogs "puff" and deflate while cooking the texture will be perfect and the flavor will be infused. Super Bowl standard in our family.

I made these for an all male football get together.  These guys will eat anything!!  And they wouldn't eat these......every one of them tried the hot dogs and I asked each.  The best remark I received was "they're ok"  I threw away about 3/4 of the dish!!

Hubby really likes these, however only cooking them for 10 min was not nearly enough. I added a couple of tablespoons full more of brown sugar and cooked them until the sauce was thick and had almost entirely absorbed into the hot dogs.

These were really good and so easy to make.  Great for Sunday Football TV.  You make them and they will come!

I followed it exactly and it was terrific and a welcome change from the grape jelly one I usually make.
