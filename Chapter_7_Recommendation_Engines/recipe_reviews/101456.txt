This was awesome and very easy. I used pollok fillets because that is what I had on hand. Also, I didn't have dill so I used dry mustard in it's place.
The whole family loved this dish. Will definately make this one again...really soon!

I typically hate fish, so I figure if it's pretty good to me, I'll give it a five.  :)  I used Italian breadcrumbs since I didn't have plain and I also added some garlic powder to the mix.  I drizzled a little lemon juice over the fish along with some lemon pepper shake and bake.  It turned out really well for fish! :)  Thanks!

This is a great way to cook fish. I used butter rather than a spread but other than that followed the recipe exactly. My husband's was "this is better than fried fish".

This was pretty good though not as crispy as I expected.  I used panko bread crumbs and maybe that was why.  Will try again with regular bread crumbs.

I left out the seasoning salt and used orange roughy.  I dont like a lot of fish, but the lemmony flavor made this one a keeper.

I didn't taste the mixture under the breadcrumbs as much as I would have liked to, but this was still really good and I will try it again.  The problem could have been that I only had italian breadcrumbs, and so the spices in that might have overpowered the other flavors.  My husband loved it.

The flavor of the spices really didn't come through in this dish.  I would have loved to taste more lemon or dill or even the paprika that was sprinkled on top.  It just tasted like fish to me and I am not a fan of fish.  I ate it because it's good for me.  I also used gluten free bread crumbs because it is necessary for me.

This went over very well in our family.  Even my sons who hardly ever eat anything I cook gobbled this up.  It was easy too so I will be making this again soon.

This was a hit with my husband...my kids thought it was "spicy" but survived.  I had to double the spice mixture to have enough to coat. I then sprayed the fish with a butter spray before coating with the bread crumbs Yum!!

This was the best baked fish recipe ever. My husband does not usually like baked fish but he was all over this and asked me to make it the next night also! Will use this recipe frequently! Very easy to make and it tastes great! I followed the recipe exactly except I used a different brand of margarine.
