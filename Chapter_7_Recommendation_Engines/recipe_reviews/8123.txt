This is great. I used 1 c white & 1 c brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers. While eating it, I thought it might taste even better with pineapple. My second try I used 2 bananas & 1 cup pineapple. I also used the pineapple juice from the can instead of the water. My family usually calls me Deborah, referring to Raymond's wife who can't cook on 'Everybody Loves Raymond'. Everybody loved this. My sister-in-law asked for the recipe. When she made it she omitted the salt & 1/2 the oil & it was still very good. The best.

I made this cake for my daughter's 1st birthday, since she is a big fan of raisins. It was delicious! I did follow the other reviewer's advice and only baked it for an hour - that was sufficient.

DELISH ! As Rachel Ray would say ! NO words describe it better than this. I use vegetable oil because that's all I have in the house at the moment. I didn't have any ground cinnamom. I only have cinnamon powder so I use 1 1/2 tsps and I also had to bake for 1hr mo minutes, 40 minutes wasn't enough. But I am in a very humid climate. So Maybe that why. I would defintely make this one again.

I loved this recipe.  I only baked it for a little over an hour although I did set my oven timer for 1 1/2 hrs.  I stuck a knife in to test for doneness at the 1 hr mark and the knife came out clean but I let it bake for another 10 minutes just to make sure, I don't know.    Delicious cake, freezes well.  Just warm frozen cake slice in microwave for 30-40 seconds and yumm!

My family loved it. I was a little disappointed. It was pretty dry on the outside and took forever to cook on the inside. It tasted more like a bread than a cake. I did pour a little rum sauce on top, which added a nice kick.

This cake is SO delicious! I have a 5 month old, so I don't have a lot of spare time for baking -- however, this recipe was so fast & easy to make. I did not have walnuts on hand, so I substituted a nut topping mix (finely chopped peanuts & pecans), which came out wonderful. The raisins are a nice change for regular banana cake. I agree with the other reviewers about cooking time: 1 hr is definitely too much. I only had to cook it for 40 mins. A great busy-day cake! I will be making this again.

The first time I made this cake it had a lingering baking soda taste that was unpleasant. The second time around I omitted the baking soda and used 1/2 a tbsp of baking powder instead. The cake was much better. I reduced the baking time to an hour and 10 minutes.

This cake was very good - nice and moist.  However, 1 1/2 hours is too long for baking time - one hour is sufficient.

My 8 year old daughter made this cake pretty much by herself.  This is the first cake she has made by herself and it is absolutley awesome.  She put the cake in a 10x13 pan and cooked it for about 45 mins.  it's awesome.  I'm proud of her and she is very proud of herself.  Great recipe, easy and yummy!!

My family wanted something sweet, I wanted something healthy and this cake was perfect!  I did sub apple sauce for the oil and 1 c brown sugar for 1 c of the white sugar.  Very moist with a nice flavor, but the cooking time was way off.  It was done in 55 minutes!  Will definitely make this again and often.

Awesome! However: I had to get rid of the Bananas but had no Raisins so I used Chocolate Chips. Only used 1 tsp Vanilla (all I had) and a Splash of Orange Extract. Also, I used 1 Cup of Splenda/Suger Mix instead of the 2 Cups of white Sugar. Very happy with the Outcome and will definitely make again with the Raisins!

Oddly enough, mine took the full 90 minutes to bake in the center. I used bananas which I'd previously frozen & thawed, so maybe that explains why it took so long? Regardless, it was YUMMY! A bit sweeter than necessary, so next time I'll take other reviewer's advice and cut back a bit on the sugar, and probably substitute half the oil for applesauce. Quick & easy to make up; just make sure you give yourself a little extra time for baking if you use frozen bananas.

Delicious,  I made into muffins for breakfast, 12 muffins baked perfectly 350, for 45 mins. I used vegetable oil instead. I also topped them with a lemon glaze made from 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar and the juice of 1 lemon. I also soaked the raisin in water for 10 mins to soften them before adding them to the batter, I have seen that in other recipes.

This was a very yummy cake, Will make again, again, I cut the Baking soda in 1/2, and used the other 1/2 as baking powder. Had a bit of a time getting it out of mold, But it was worth the fight.  It was so moist and yummy.

This is excellent! Very dense and moist. I followed the suggestion for half brown sugar, plus I always soak my raisins in 2 tablespoons of rum (or any liquour). Terrific recipe.

I have now made this cake several times, and it is always a big hit in my house.  I agree that it is really banana bread, not so much cake- but as long as you know to expect that it's REALLY good banana bread.  One major recipe change: it only takes 45 minutes to an hour to bake, I can't imagine how dry it would be after 1 1/2 hours!  Also, I don't have a bundt pan, so I use a baking tray.. a little smaller than 9 X 13.  The first time I made it I couldn't find the raisins so I used "fruit bits" instead (little pieces of dried fruit by Sun Maid), and it was incredible, so I've repeated that variation.  Once I made it with raisins and it was also good.  I think I've always used about half white and half brown sugar.  Last time I made it with half the sugar overall so that I could give it to my one-year old- it was less sweet, but still good.  The baby loved it and my husband actually liked it that way, but I prefer the sweeter version.  And I usually add some nutmeg, because my husband thinks everything with cinnamon should also have nutmeg, and he's the chef around here.  I really love this recipe, it is so easy!

Good but needed frosting.  I would use cream cheese frosting.  The cake has the same consistancy of banana bread w/o the spices.

Best banana cake recipe I have ever tried. Delicious! I made this in a 9" springform pan and baking time was about 1 hour 15 minutes.  Doesn't need glaze or frosting of any kind but would be good with either. For anyone with a wheat/gluten allergy, I made this recipe with gf flour and it turned out  great. Fantastic recipe!

My 6 yr old daughter made this (with very little help) for a Girl Scout bake off.  It was delicious. Very moist. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar and veg oil. Only cooked it 1 hour and even that may be 10 minutes too long. Excellent taste!

This recipe is just what I was looking for!  My son says it's addicting, calling it "like crack!"  I had looked at another banana cake recipe on this site, and incorporated some of its ideas: I subbed sour cream for the water, used 4 eggs (to make it cake-ier), and put in chocolate chips instead of raisins.  I mashed the bananas, and used whatever I had around--this time it was 5 bananas. I added more baking soda, to handle leavening this much stuff.  I got a dense, moist chocolate/banana dessert.  Wonderful!

It was very delicious.Banana makes it wet and very smooth.I don't think that was as dense as bread as some reviewers said.
I cooked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes.
My Husband loved my cake.

I only used 3/4 cup of oil, and 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Instead of raisins, I sprinkled 1 cup of mini chocolate chips on the top.  Everyone thought it was divine!

Amazing cake! I tried this for my fathers birthday, and he absolutely loved it! I also made scones (because they're my mothers favourite) everybody absolutely loved this cake! I followed the recipe given, with the exception of switching out walnuts with pecans (my dad is allergic to walnuts)! Would definitely make again! Note; great texture!

It was delicious , but too sweet for my taste. I will reduce the amount of sugar next time. I baked it for 45 minutes  and it was done.

Delicious! Great and easy recipe. I was looking at making my cranberry banana bread and came across this recipe. 1st time using my new bundt pan. Used dried cranberries instead and it just was so yummy. Partner said it was the best dessert I ever made!! 

Just have to make sure you watch the baking time because mine was done before the hour and a half was finished. Checked at 1 hour and had to leave in for another 15 just to make sure the cake was completely baked through. Otherwise a delicious addition to my baking list!

I was a bit disappointed. This really wasn't so much a cake as a banana bread baked in a ring pan. It was dense and somewhat dry in my opinion. I didn't use the raisins, but I dont' think that accounted for they dryness. I ended up having to put a glaze over top just to add some moistness. I was going to give this a 3 but my hubby liked it a little better than I did so I upgraded. If you want a cake that tastes like banana bread, then try this. But if you want something lighter and moister then look eslewhere.

A 4 star recipe made to a 5 star when you add the Peanut Butter Glaze recipe from the frostings and fillings section.  I did not have a pound cake pan, so I used 2 loaf pans.  Baked 1 hour and they came out perfectly.  Definitely consider the glaze..it really makes this cake wonderful.

I agree with one reviewer that this is more bread than cake. The crust came out crunchy and my husband just loved it. Used 1c white sugar and 1c brown sugar. Eliminated walnuts because hubby don't like nuts so added an extra banana instead. Yummy.
