This was delicious and not hard to make at all.  It was humid the day I made this.  The dough seemed way to sticky with the amount of flour called for in the dough part of the recipie.  I hate altering recipies on my first try, but like I said, it was so muggy and we make a lot of our own bread so I know how that can effect dough.  I did end up adding about one cup more flour.  This gave me a slightly sticky, but smooth looking dough. I had to flour my finger tips to push it up the sides of the pan.  The result, regardless of the flour issue, was so so good.  It formed a soft, very thin layer between the apples and dough that was almost cheese danish like..but not doughy or under baked.  My family loved it and I will positively make it again!

Making this one again at husband's request for Thanksgiving dessert. I used dark brown sugar in the topping the first time. A little too "gooey" with just the brown sugar - going to use half regular and half brown sugar this time. Overall flavor and ease of prep was great. Don't be scared of the yeast batter - it takes care of itself without being fussy. Would be great warm with a little scoop of ice cream or whipped cream - yum!

I am currently studying in Germany and this tastes better than the Apfelkuchen at the bakeries! It's not too sweet, just right. I add an extra apple, but 3 is just fine. The dough is super sticky, I add 1/2 cup more of flour, but i've realized that as "wrong" as this feels, sticky is OK! I also cut the butter by half in the crumbs (the butter it calls for made my crumbs almost a paste the first time) and add 1/4 cup of ground almond to my crumbs because why not?! DELICIOUS! This has my German boyfriend's seal of approval too! (ps. didn't add the candied lemon peel)

This is a great recipe. So simple and quick to make. I used fresh apricots and no crumbs. Instead I whipped one egg with 1/2 cup sugar and poured that over the apricots. This is a keeper!

I really like the concept of this recipe with yeast in the cake batter, baked apples, and crumble topping.  The taste and texture were good, but it seems that the recipe's 400F cooking temperature is too high.  The exterior of the cake was brown after just 20 minutes, but the center was not done.  The next time I make this I will use a lower oven temperature in hopes that it will bake more evenly.
... I have made this recipe a second time using 375F cooking temperature and still wasn't thrilled with the way it came out.  I wonder if I am overcooking it, but if cooked less then the batter that isn't touching the baking dish would still be doughy.

GREAT
First of all the changes i made:
1. 4 apples not 3, i cut them into small pieces
2. I used 'Apple spice' instead of nutmeg and cinnamon.
3. I used lemon juice instead of lemon peel, i put aprox. 1 tsp and had to add more flour to the top mixture to dry it back.
4. I put the oven on 180C instead of 200C for aprox. 50-60 min.

It came out INSANE... too good... It was also too easy to make... the kind of cakes I wish I will remember to bring/make when i have friends or family over, or when i need to make something quickly.

I made this the other day, and it was a blast from the past! My mother is from Germany and used to make this often. This is the same recipe she has from a German cookbook called Backen macht Freude (baking makes joy!)  The dough to this recipe can be used as a base for so many other cakes! Good job sneez :)

Such a great cake...almost brownie-like texture. It's essentially a sweetbread with yummy/gooey apple filling topped with a streusel. I ended up adding quite a bit more flour to the dough and also baked it about 10 mins longer, as the center still seemed gooey. It may have set up if I had just left it alone but I wanted to be sure. I actually signed up just so I could leave a review of this cake because there aren't enough. We really loved it!

Loved this cake, can't wait to make this for my family. First time making a cake with yeast. I was a little Leary, but it was great. Not overly sweet like a regular cake, just right. The dough is sticky but just keep your fingers floured and it works just fine. I didn't add the candied lemon, didn't have any.  I used four apples because I felt my apples were small. I wouldn't change a thing. Lol not true I would also try a blueberry filling and a cherry filling. We all know a recipe is just a starting point : ) thank you for a great recipe!

I made this recipe substituting "Splenda for Baking" for the batter because you need some sugar for the yeast. My batter came out rather wet so I could not push it up the sides. DO NOT BEAT the dough in a stand mixer for 5 minutes otherwise your batter will come out like rubber. The 5 minutes must be for hand beating. I used the last 4 apples on our Golden Delicious tree. My result was yummy, but my lower layer also got very brown on the bottom. I did not use the lemon peel. All-in-all I believe this is a very versatile recipe that might be used for several other kinds of fresh fruit: apricot, peach, or cherry. I love the three layers: cake bottom, fruit center, and streusel-like topping. The streusel topping measurements of the sugar-to-butter ratio seemed like too much sugar for the butter. I've been looking for something to bake for work and this would be a good one. I will try this again soon to test my ideas. I too have experienced the wonderful baking of a German Konditerai and this is very close, if not the same.

I made this for my German grandmothers birthday and it was a big hit. The only negative was the dough rose a little too much on the sides of the cake which kind of bubbled over making the cake look a little strange. The inside of the cake was delicious!

This is without a doubt the best apple cake I've baked;  and yes it tastes just like the 'Apfelkuchen' you'd find in Germany. 
The only change I made was to substitute freshly grated lime zest for the candied peel, as I don't like candied peel, and I used 4 apples instead of 3.
Next time I will  bake it at 390' F  for 40 minutes, and definitely bake it on the middle shelf of the oven as it baked a bit dark underneath.- although this could be due to my new oven that I'm still getting used to.
Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

The batter for the base resembles yeast waffle batter. You just spread the batter in your bake form and top with the apples and streusel bake and enjoy. The streusel could be made with 4 tablespoons of butter and 1/4th less sugar and will still be delicious.

This was great!!  I don't even like apple pie at all but I loved this!  My husband loves apple pie and he said he liked this even more!  I will make this often since we have an apple tree and are always trying to find recipes to use them in.  The only things that I changed were that I used 4 apples instead of 3 and substituted a squeeze of lemon juice for the lemon peel since we didn't have any.

I used dough hooks with a cake mixer to mix the dough, and a non-stick plastic spatula to push the dough into the pan, so handling the sticky dough was not a problem. Reduced sugar in the crumble topping, but added a spoonful of granular sugar over the topping after it was spread on top of the apples. I will be using more apples next time!

Really great recipe. I followed exactly but used a 10" springfoam pan and it turned out perfect. Next time I may add foil around the edges so they do not over cook. Definitely would make this again.

I made this tonight and it was not only easy, it was flawless. The taste was wonderful -- I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and added some Allspice as well. On top of all of this -- my home has never smelled more inviting! :-)

The apple and streusel topping were phenomenal! But, what prevents me from rating this a 5 star recipe was the bread part. I'm not sure if the fat from the whole milk contributed, but the crust got very dark - I only baked it for 25 minutes and it was very dark and inedible. The rest of the bread's flavor was very lacking. I might find another crust recipe and combine it with the filling of this one.

I cooked the cake according to the recipe, but it came out burnt on the bottom. I will try this again but cook it at a lower temperature.

I substituted lemon zest and juice for the candied lemon peel because I couldn't find it.  I used four diced apples instead of three sliced ones. Otherwise, I followed recipe as it is written. My  husband loved this so much!  It's a beautiful looking cake, as well.

This was absolutely fantastic.  I followed all instructions, barring my substitution for maple sugar in lieu of white or brown sugar.  I'd never made anything like this, and while worried about the dough's failure to behave as a traditional bread, cake or cookie dough, it turned out fantastic!

So good! My mom is german. I grew up in Germany until I was 7. My Mom had an apfelkuchen recipe I made when I was a teenager even using applesauce instead of apples sometimes. It was delicious but she either lost it or couldn't remember it so I thought I'd try this recipe. It's not like the one my Mom made but still delicious!!!!

I made this cake a few years ago (minus the candied lemon peel) for a dear friend Fr. Jim M.  He told me this kuchen was exactly like his mother made for him when he was a child. I used a springform pan and was delighted at the result and presentation. 

It's time to surprise him and make another.

On another note, the way this recipe is written is quite confusing. Read it carefully so you know the order of things. "Allow dough to rise for 30 minutes" comes after steps are finished. It should come before "press dough up the sides". Just be aware before you start  / KH

Very confused... how on earth did ppl manage to beat this sticky viscous dough on high speed for five minutes?? When I tried to use my electric mixer on this,  it climbed the beaters like a murderous octopus. I ended up partly kneading it by hand,  partly poking at it with a wooden spoon, then just throwing up my hands in despair and defeat after two minutes. That being said, finished product was still an ok texture and tasted fine.  But how are people beating this dough?

Liked this. Used a 10" springform. I was intrigued by the use of yeast without rising time. Came out beautifully.  I used very tart wild apples so the topping was bearable. Next time I will use much less topping and a little less dough. Used lemon rind. It was easy to make. I agree with comment about the beating time, far less than 5 minutes that must've been for doing by hand

I use fresh lemon zest sprinkled over the apples for a great lemon flavouring. I allow the dough to rise for about an hour before baking. Other then that, I stay true to recipe. Have made this many times and it’s a fantastic dessert dish.

This recipe was fabulous. I made it as is, the dough was runny but I put it into the pan anyways and followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out perfect. Yum!  Thank you. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Tasted great. The cake however baked uneven probably my fault as I don't bake often. It doesnt seem too sweet even though it is loaded with sugar. I am going to try this again with some changes and see if it comes out better

Absolutely positively love this cake! I would even wake up in the middle of the night craving this cake and eating more than my fair share. It really seemed easy to also easy enough my middle schooler has made it twice for school and once for home.
