We have updated this recipe due to a typo. The amount of baking powder has been reduced to 1/4 teaspoon.

Delicious shortbread crust. A few comments, though: 1) yields 2 pies, or one double crust; 2) I think baking powder may be omitted, since the shortbread rises very high and 3) may add 1/2 to 1 tsp salt, to make it even more shortbready.

Quick and easy to make crust.  I refrigerated the dough for a half hour before baking, pricked the crust on the bottom to keep it from "poofing" up too much, and added 1 tsp. of vanilla for flavour.  Quick, easy and delicious.  I agree with the previous review; it yields two crusts.  Great with the Fresh Strawberry Pie I.

This recipe provides more dough than will fit into a 9-in pie plate.  It would probably work better in a 9x13.  I had to cook 7 minutes longer than indicated to get it done & a couple of times had to take it out of the oven to pat down & reshape the rising dough so it would leave room in the dish for my pie filling.  It was worth the effort though & went nicely with my key lime pie.

What a simple recipie for crust. Excellent tasting, I could just eat the crust alone. Also the fat calories are not the high.

Very tasty. My supermarket doesn't carry the premade shortbread crusts anymore so I thought I'd try this one. I also added a capful of vanilla to the batter and refrigerated the pie crust for about 1/2 hour prior to baking. I found baking time is more like 15-20 minutes. This crust is great with strawberry pie recipes from this site.

Excellent. I used it for a lemon meringue. If you wanted a nice thick crust this portion makes one thick, delicious crust. Or two thinner crusts. I  placed it into my pie pan, put saran wrap over it and then pressed it using another pie pan. The crust came up over all the sides and made this awesome thick crust with a very thick and pretty border. Did I mention it was delicious?

I made it into little mini fruit tarts. Excellent shortbread crust. I stuck the tarts in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes before baking so they wouldn't rise. Very flaky, buttery crust. Works perfectly.

I thought this recipe was delicious. The first time I made it I filled the crust with fresh strawberries, and the second I used dulce de leche ice cream. Delicious!

I made this and left out the baking powder because I was afraid it would puff up too much.  Even without the baking powder, the crust was so thick that there was no longer space in my 9 inch pie plate for the pie filling and I had to use a different recipe.  Sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar, cut it into wedges, and called it shortbread cookies instead.  Tasted good, but was impractical as a pie crust.  I think it would work nicely as a crust if you cut the recipe down by a third.

This was really good....I made it in a 9 1/2 inch pie dish and it was plenty thick. I made it for a strawberry pie and everyone thought it was great. It's also way easier than a regular pie crust since you just press it into the pan instead of rolling it out. I'll definitely be using this again.

This is GREAT!!!! I will never like graham cracker crust ever again. For the first time, I made cheesecake pie in it. The crust makes all the difference. If I could give this more stars I would. Thank you. All my desserts are better with this crust. It is SO EASY!!!!

I had gastric bypass over 2 years ago. I love cheesecake but I cannot have the sugar in the crust. I ground up some Truvia for the confectioner's sugar and used this for the cheesecake. It was to die for delicious. Everyone loved it instead of the graham cracker. They thought it was a cookie. This will be my go to recipe for all my cheesecakes in the future. Thank you for sharing.

This tasted wonderful! It fits perfectly pressed into a 9x13 pan, and still delivers a think crust. It was very easy to press into the pan and I made sure I poked a few holes in with a fork to stop it from rising up too much and it worked perfectly. I made this with fresh strawberry pie. Just delicious!!

Very easy to make, and made enough for a 9x13 baking dish. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla, as others have suggested, and this would have turned out wonderfully had I baked it long enough. I followed the timing instructions on the recipe, but since it was a glass dish and larger than the pie plate specified it apparently needed longer. I'm guessing that 20 minutes at 325 would have been better. Oh well, next time it'll be great.

Great recipe! Very simple. I do add a dash of vanilla, but otherwise I follow the recipe as written. As other people have mentioned, it does yield 2 crusts.

Delicious! I used an oat flour instead of wheat flour because I think it adds a better flavor. The crust turned out exactly as I hope it would. I scaled it down to 4 servings and it was perfect. I'll never buy frozen shortbread crust again.

This crust was wonderful with a chocolate hazelnut cream cheese filling.  I halved the recipe and it was perfect for a 9" tart.  When you press it up the sides of a pie plate/tart pan, please understand it will shrink significantly so make sure you make the sides a bit higher than you normally might.  This is great with cooked, cream fillings - I highly recommend it.

This is a great recipe as-written just for the texture of it, and the richness. But I wanted to add more flavor, so I put in 2 Tablespoons of lemon zest, and 1 tsp. of almond extract. I patted it into a 9x13 baking dish, followed the baking instructions, and when it was cool, I cut it into bars about 3.1/4 inches long and a little over an inch wide. I then dipped 1 end into a semisweet chocolate ganache, and sprinkled finely crushed macadamias on the chocolate end. Wow...my family loved it! You can tweak this recipe with different flavors of add-ins and coatings, but you still have that great shortbread to start with.  Thanks!

I love this crust! It's going to be my go to crust from now on, it's so yummy and easy to make. It stood up well to my lemon meringue pie and was easy to get out of the pan, unlike some reviewers.This definitely is enough for two crusts and mine took way longer to cook than indicated.

I use my shortbread cookie recipe as a crust and it turns out much more flavorful.  The crust tasted like flour, not enough flavor.

This crust was incredibly easy to make and tasted amazing! I used it in place of a graham cracker crust for a peanut butter bar I made and everyone just kept going on about how moist the crust was! Will definitely make again!

This is an easy and very good crust!  I recommend following the advice of others on this thread, which was to chill the dough & roll it out instead of patting it down.  I found it too sticky and it's definitely a double crust recipe, chilling it makes it easier to cut away half and freeze it for next time.

Super easy to make and soooo tasty!  I used this crust for Key Lime Pie and Lime Cheescakes with Rasberry swirls from this website.  I leave out the baking powder to keep the crust from puffing up so much.

Oh Yum! I made this for the base of chantal's cheesecake. Its so good! The only thing I changed was I did a heaping 1/2 cup confectioners sugar (more like 3/4 cup). You don't have to fo this but to me it just makes it all the more perfect.  I just like everything a little more sweet!

Very quick, simple pie crust recipe. It has a much lighter texture and flavour than pastry or graham crusts and almost got lost under my lemon meringue pie. I think this would be better used for a filling with a subtle flavour, or a pie where you want the filling to be tasted and the crust used mainly for support. I actually made this gluten and dairy free by using gluten free all purpose flour (a combination of rice, potato and tapioca flours) instead of wheat flour and margarine instead of butter. It turned out great and I would definitely use this recipe again.

This tasted great, and was really quick to whip together.  It made more than enough for my one pie, probably enough for two.

Very simple and really good. Used with a refrigerated dessert and would recommend leaving at room temperature for awhile before cutting, otherwise was like a brick to cut and then would soften.

We used half butter, half shortening, and melted them slightly before mixing in the food processor with the sugar. (We also added a little more sugar since we were making a rhubarb pie.) We added 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar, and mixed it all in the food processor until it formed a dough. Then divided in two parts, pressed into a 9 inch pan, put the other  half in the freezer until the one pressed into the tin was done baking. We then rolled out the cold half and cut out shapes to place in top of the pie. Worked beautifully.

I've been making cobblers for a year and a half, searching for the perfect shortbread recipe. FOUND !! 
You can eat it raw, (no eggs) and it tastes almost as delicious as it is baked. 

I substitute somewhat less sugar for Truvia or Splenda to cut down on the sugar. 

Also, you can add pecan pieces to the crust sometimes for more texture and toasty flavor. Especially in a fruit cobbler or tart.

While I didn't really care for this recipe as a pie crust (too sweet for strawberry pie), I made the leftover dough into some AMAZING shortbread cookies. I followed the recipe to a "T", but took the advice of others and only used about half for the pie crust- it was still quite thick enough. Perhaps I should have sprayed the glass pie dish with cooking spray because it was extremely difficult to get the crust out with the pie. To top it all off- the strawberries did not set well, so I ended up with a pile of strawberry goo instead of pie. oh well. didn't taste too bad.

I normally leave the crust when I eat a pie, because most crust doesn't taste that great and it just seems like empty calories, but I love the taste of shortbread.  This crust doesn't really roll like a typical pie crust dough, at least it hasn't for me and I've used it 3 times.  After I mix the dough, I just put the crumbles into the pan and pat it into place and it works fine, but have been unsuccessful rolling it out the traditional way.  Today I tried it with a little additional vegetable oil, and it was much more the texture of typical pie dough, and still tasted fine.  I didn't find the recipe to be too large for a single crust, at least not the way I use it!

Added 1 tsp vanilla.Poked crust with a fork before baking.  If you like a thick crust this makes 1 thick, delicious crust, or 1-9x13" crust or 2 thinner pie crusts. I put it into a 9" deep pie pan, put plastic wrap over it &  pressed it using another pie pan. The crust came up over all the sides & made a  thick crust with a very thick & pretty edge. I have used it for a strawberry pie, my mother-in-laws strawberry cheesecake 4 layer dessert,  chocolate pie & a peanut butter pie.

Glad I read the reviews before making this. I took a reviewer's advice and used a 9 x 13 baking dish. Fit perfectly.  I also wound up cooking this much longer than the 12 to 15 minutes stated. It took more like 25 to 30 minutes for the edges to brown. Well worth the wait though.  This is by far the best shortbread I've ever eaten. It literally melts in your mouth!.

I just made this crust for mini tartlets and the cake and it was the best shortbread crust ever. It is a keeper.Was very simple and quick to make.I love the amount of crust it will make. I made a variety of desserts with it...ex: mini tartlets w/ creamcheese, creamcheese cake and shortbread cookies w/ jam. This is my go to recipe for cookies...No more store bought for us. Thank you for sharing.

I also add a little bit of Orange or Lemon rind if you are making any kind of fruit pie. It just adds to the flavor. I also didn't add baking powder.

Easiest crust I have ever made, and the flavor/texture was wonderful! Had to cook it a bit longer, but that was no biggie.  Next time I will probably chill it before spreading in pan as it wanted to stick to my fingers (not as bad when I switched to a spoon). Used this instead of graham cracker crust for a caramel banana pie. Yum!

I had some leftover Blueberry Sauce (recipe on this site) that I had made for pancakes and was looking for a way to use it.   I halved the recipe for this shortbread crust and pushed the dough into four greased cups in a standard-sized muffin pan.  It took a little longer to bake and kept wanting to rise too much, but I just took it out of the oven and pushed it back down.  It made a soft crust for the tarts in the end, and I filled it with the thickened blueberry sauce and topped each with whipped cream.  Thanks for the crust recipe! Very easy to make.

This crust was delicious, if a little too brittle.  This was enough for two crusts, but I think next time I'll just roll out the extra for shortbread cookie cutouts.  All in all, very tasty crust.  I filled it with the Cream Cheese Blueberry Pie from this site.

This is plenty of dough for two pie shells and will rise a good bit in the oven.  I will certainly butter the pie pans next time as it was difficult to get out.  I made it with the Old Fashion Coconut Cream Pie recipe on this site.  Very good.

I used these for teh bake sale lemon bars and it was delish! Although it was a little wet (may have been because of the lemon bars). If you make it with the lemon bars or something a bit tart, use a little extra sugar (a tablespoon) to the crust and it is perfect!

This is my go to shortbread recipe.  I bake mine in a springform pan so it comes out cleanly.  I have also baked it on sheet pans when I do a double recipe.  I make a great dessert that layers crumbled shortbread, vanilla pudding, fresh berried and whipped cream.  DELICIOUS!

I love this recipe (we love shortbread!) and can see myself using it for many pies that had the traditional crust.  Seems like the right "fit" with fruit pies.  I made a strawberry pie from this site and it was out of this world with this crust!  Thanks!

This crust was great with a coconut cream pie.  I will definitely use this crust again.  Although, the recipe did make more than enough crust, even for a deep dish 9".  It was very good!

This was a good recipe, I ended up tasting it and thought it needed more flavor so I added a bit more sugar, a dash of vanilla, and a pinch of salt. But just taste it and tweak it to your liking!

Great shortbread crust! I made it exactly as directed, pressed it into the bottom of a 13x9 glass pan, and then topped it with some partially cooked apples, cinnamon sugar and what I had left of the shortbread dough. It looked sort of like a crumble on top. I had some caramel I made from the cooked apple liquid and drizzled that on top, baked it all for about 40 min and it is delicious. Better than regular apple pie.

Good crust and super easy to throw together. This had a nice flavor and went well with my peanut butter pie. I don't care for crumb crusts so I'm always looking for a nice alternative to the basic pastry crust.

Thought this was great. Used to top an apple walnut cobbler/pie. Plan on using next year for all my pies.

I easily got two pies out of this recipe, as I used a crumb topping on each. The butter I cut down just slightly, and it was still fantastic. I even made this in a square pan, for shortbread cookie bars. I have heard it said that the simpler the better, and this is so true!
Why buy packaged crust or cookies filled with unpronouncable ingredients when you can whip this up in no time?!

It was pretty good. I was able to use the dough for both the top and bottom layers on my apple pie.  It did sink a little to the bottom, as other reviewers have stated. It also crumbled when serving. Thanks for the recipe!

I used this crust recipe to make the Bake Sale Lemon Bars on this site.  Loved it!  As I said in that review, if you're using this crust in a 9x13 pan, use an angled cake frosting knife to spread it.  Makes it way easier.  Although I'm not a pie maker, I'm sure this would be great!  A++

Yummy!  Follwed the directions exactly and the crust came out perfectly.  It didn't stick to my pie plate and didn't crumble when I cut the pie into pieces.  I used this recipe when making the "Strawberry Shortbread Pie" recipe from this site.  They are a perfect match.

I only wanted to make one 9 inch pie crust. So I just have to everything. I wish I would’ve read all the comments especially the one about refrigerating it a little while before baking. I did put that more than what I wanted and the edges didn’t stay up where I had them. All in all very good recipe and will make again with a few alterations at my own

I used this for a strawberry pie.  Other than halving the recipe for the bottom of a 9-inch pie,  the only thing I changed was to add a 1/2 t of vanilla.  
This is the way to go for those who don't like traditional crust.

I’ve used this crust when making lemon meringue pies because it’s a good sturdy crust and it soaks up any juice from the pie and it tastes great.

Fantastic tasty crust. I made 2 pies. The crust was tasty enough to eat alone. I liked the crust better than the pie filling! Would be a great crust for buttertart squares.

I have been looking for a crust to use for my lemon merinuge pie. This turned out so good. I used it in a 9 x 19 pan and I had a little extra. I like that it was thicker so it was not soggy. Next time I will add some almonds to the crust.

An excellent easy recipe, i read the reviews before me, & i was using a 9" dish, so I halved the ingredients and added just a tiiiiny bit of baking powder & a cup full of vanilla extract, i had no confectioners sugar so i used regular sugar instead as someone commented that she did it by mistake and it turned out right, it took around 20-25 min in the oven , i would definitely do this again.... i only gave it 4 stars cuz i felt it was still missing flavor... could be the sugars fault

This was excellent! I make shortbread cookies & never requires baking powder so I didn't use any....This was excellent. I used this recipe in a 13 x 9" pan & no I DIDN'T double recipe. Look at thickness of crust! It would make 2 - 9" shells or the size you are seeing in photo. PS: the top was a recipe from this sight.... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/12241/lemon-pie-ii/  Both were excellent!

This was divine! Buttery, flaky, just the right amount of sweetness. Don't change anything. It fit my 11 inch tart pan perfectly. I'll use this for pie crusts, tart shells, cookies and bars. I did refrigerate the dough, but it probably wasn't necessary. It takes a bit of time to press perfectly evenly, but totally worth it. I pricked it all over. It came out beautiful. Oh, I also covered the edges with foil before baking since some of the photos looked a bit brown.

love this recipe!!!!! I use it for all my pies.  I even  make extra and freeze it for future use. It's light enough to be a crust, yet tastes like a shortbread cookie, but without too much sweetness.

Very simple and fairly labor-free.  As others have stated, it makes too much crust for a 9-inch pie, so I ended up with about a 1/3 leftover.  Not enough for two pies, unfortunately.   I thought about saving the leftovers for cookies, but in the end I was too lazy and threw it away - which is not something I do normally.

I loved this recipe. I didn't change anything, but since I was using it for a no bake pie, I left it in the oven for about another half hour to make sure it was completely baked. Let it cool completely before  using. Delicious!

This gets 4 stars for how it is "as is."  I made 1/2 a recipe to get 1 pie crust.  It was really sticky & while I could get it pressed in the pie plate, it was WAY too sticky to roll pieces to make a decorative top.  I had to add more flour to be able to work with it.  However, the taste was great.  I will make again with more flour.

This was a great recipe.  I made this crust a few days ago for a lemon meringue pie.  Everyone loved it and it was much simpler and more foolproof than making a traditional crust.  My girlfriend asked if I could just make her a crust to eat by itself! Lol!  I didn't have an issue with the crust puffing up too much or anything.  I liked it just the way it was.

I'm sure this recipe would make 2 - 9x13 pans.  Way too thick, too much butter and flour!  And tastes too floury.

It tasted good- but I found it dry. I may have overworked the crust while pressing it in. It also stuck to the pan, in spite of spraying it with cooking spray. probably won't use this recipe again... I'd like to find a slighter softer, perhaps moister/buttery crust...

Very good. I followed exactly, but my baking powder is about six months-old so I don't know if it even made a difference being in there. I poked the crust with a fork before baking it because others did. This crust is delicious on its own. I know this because I made cookies with the leftover dough from my pie and they were amazing. The dough is very easy to work with. I will use this recipe again for sure.

Tastes good but definitely yields 2 crusts. More appropriate for a bar recipe, but still tasty.

Didn't have any shortening so I tried this crust.  Pretty darn easy! And I did cut it in half as I only needed one crust for a lemon pie.  Will probably use again for a strawberry pie.

This was really good and easy to make. The dough came out very soft, making it easy to shape in the pie plate. Once baked, it was super flaky and just came out perfect!

This recipes is tasty BUT it doesn't stick to the sides of the pie pan. When cooking, all of the dough ends up at the bottom and very thick. It would be great for "bars" but not for a pie crust.

This crust tasted great!  I made it for a coconut cream pie for my husband and it was a delicious combination.  It didn't really hold up very well when serving though, and fell apart.  If you don't care about taking a slice of pie out of the pan in pieces, then I highly recommend this recipe!
