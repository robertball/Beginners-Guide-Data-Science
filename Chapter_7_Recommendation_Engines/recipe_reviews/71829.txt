I've made different variations of meatloaf and this version is similar to mine. This recipes serves a great basis for a meatloaf in that the texure is wonderful. I used 1 1/2 pounds of ground turkey since I love the leftovers :o)~~ Here is what I did different: 1. I used 1 tsp of seasoning salt. 2. I omitted the red wine 3. I used about 2/3 can of tomato paste to the meatloaf mixture (no sauce was placed on top) 4. I added 2 - 3 tsp Italian seasoning 5. I added 1 TBS of worcestershire sauce 6. I pulsed the oats in food processor so the oat pieces were about halved in size 7. I added a small chopped onion that was sauteed in olive oil. 8. I added NO WATER-----it's not necessary. 9. MOST IMPORTANTLY, DO NOT BAKE IN LOAF PAN!!!! Shape the mixture into a loaf and place on a broiler rack!! The liquids will cook AWAY from the loaf, ensuring a nice "crust". This may seem like a LOT of work, but it's not. I buy several pounds of ground turkey and freeze the raw loaves for  future meals. I hope this helps!!!

On first reading this recipe, it looked delicious. However, after cooking, it still looked great, but tasted very bland. It was if all the spices had been absorbed by the oatmeal or something. The recipe was followed to a T so I can't blame the cook. It is no wonder that people fall off diets if this is typical of the fare offered. Not recommended.

I did exactly what user AGENTLUCY suggested in her review, and it was SOOOO GOOOD!!  So flavorful and moist, and still SB-friendly.  I used an xtra large glass baking pan and formed a loaf in the middle, and cooked for 35 minutes.  Mmmm....  The 5 stars are for that version, not the original, which I didn't try.

After reading the others' reviews, I realized this recipe would need some help so I did add spices and onion.  I didn't want to over do it, but unfortunately I was unware of just how bland the original recipe is.  So for anyone else wanting to try this, don't skimp on the added spices.

Simply put, this was awful. The sauce was the only good part. The loaf itself was dry and bland. Maybe more than 1/2 cup of sauce should be mixed in to the meat mixture or something. The ingredients made it sound wonderful. I was just looking for something different to do with ground turkey. This recipe couldn't have hit the circular file fast enough for me.

This needs some adjustment but can be great: 1) For the sauce, just use tomato sauce, sugar substitute--I like Splenda--, and whatever seasonings you like, no paste or wine necessary if you don't like that taste; 2) To add more flavor to the loaf itself, add some finely chopped onion, worsteshire sauce, green olives w/pimentos, and lowfat shredded cheese (swiss or mozzarella is good); 3) If you skip the egg, you won't need quite as much oatmeal, although I thought the oatmeal did a very nice job of holding it all together; and 4) I didn't use the zucchini but will try it next time.

Ugh!  I was very excited about this low-fat recipe.  It would have been great for Weight Watchers, but it was just awful.  Followed the ingredients/instructions to a T and came out with a tasteless brick covered in a tomato sauce that tasted too much like thickened red wine.  My husband and I each choked down a serving, then tossed the rest--and the recipe.

Good starter recipe.  I added green peppers, onions garlic powder and salt.  I used this for weight watchers flex-points diet and a nice piece of meatloaf is only 2 points so it's worth trying.  I also put a slice on a low-carb wrap with salsa and it was pretty good. I put it on bread with mayo for hubby and he didn't complain too much so I will probably try it again.

This meatloaf had a GREAT consistency, but the turkey just didnt do it for me! I don't mind turkey bacon, turkey tacos, etc...not turkey meatloaf. I may try the same ingredients, but with beef. This was the best meatloaf consistency I have ever made, i think due to the oats. You may also want to add some more spices to it.

bland, bland, bland, I smeared a sauce of chipotle in adobo on each piece to spice it up.  Needs more than tomatoe sauce to make it tasty!

This was tasteless. There is another South Beach Diet Meatloaf recipe out there that is much better than this one.

This recipe was quite dry and lacked flavour.  I would add onions to it and put most of the tomato sauce in with the meatloaf, instead of on top.

My mom and I are on the SB diet and neither of us liked this at all.  The sauce was bad too.  I hated to do this, but I had to dip it in ketchup just to get it down.  Won't be making it ever again.

I agree completely with THYMEFORME.  This was a tasteless brick and the sauce tasted like thickened red wine.  Each of us took one bite and couldn't eat anymore.  Unfortunately, I had made 2 of them intending to freeze one.  Here are some ways I think you can improve the recipe:  Use 1/2 cup oatmeal and 1/2 cup bread crumbs using whole grain bread; add minced onion, more minced garlic, and some yellow mustard.

I disagree with other reviewers.  This is one of my favorite meatloaf recipes.  I thought the meatloaf was moist and the sauce had excellent flavor.  I did add some grated onion and garlic to the meatloaf because I like to add onion and garlic to everything.

Sounded good. Went out and bought all the ingredients to make it. VERY Bland. Needs chopped peppers and onions,green olives, or something to give it some flavor. Slightly better the next day after it had set up. My husband, who is pretty much game for anything, took one bite and just couldn't eat anymore.

Sauce was very good, but the meatloaf itself was bland. I might try this again if I check back and someone suggests ways to spice it up a little.

I have been using allrecipes for years and never reviewed a recipe until now... do not try this recipe.   No one in my family would eat it, including me after one bite.  Sorry to be so cruel, but I wouldn't want anyone else experiencing what I did.  I have been on South Beach for a month now and this is the only recipe I found to be this bad!!!  Sorry folks.

This makes a good starter recipe, however I modified it by doing half carrots and half parsnips as the veggie to add into it.  I have not tried cooking it in the oven, but instead found a great way to microwave it: create a large flattened doughnut shaped "loaf" (about 12-16 inches diameter) in and cook it in the microwave on high, covered in wax paper, for 10 minutes.  Top with the sauce and cook another 4-5 minutes.  I like it this way with either beef or turkey.

Both my boyfriend and I found this recipe extreamly tasty! I used a full cup of zucchini and added onion & garlic as another reviewer suggested. I also doubled the sauce based on another reviewer's suggestion. The sauce is WONDERFUL and I'll be using it for pasta recipes as well. VERY GOOD MEATLOAF!
