I made this exactly to the recipe, but I took the onions and celery and blended it to liquid. The guys like the flavor but not the texture, so I make little effort to get them the real stuff without complaining. This turned awesome. All the guys liked it. Not one complaint and I have picky eaters. This one goes in my recipe book...

This hit the spot on a cool night.  I had a bag of tiny potatoes I wanted to use up, cut in quarters, and kept skin on.  I added some fresh parsley growing in my kitchen window, added a few handfuls of kale, but only used 1/4 lb. cheddar cheese.  It was delicious.  This could def. be made without any cheese.  It's thick and great to use up what's left in your veggie bin.  Will def keep this one!

My husband loved this so I will make it again.  We love potato soup and this let me incorporate some healthy carrots and broccoli in as well.  I didn't have the cheeses, so made it without the cheese and we sprinkled some sharp cheddar shreds on top.  I think it was perfect.  Next time I will try the pepper jack and monterey.
