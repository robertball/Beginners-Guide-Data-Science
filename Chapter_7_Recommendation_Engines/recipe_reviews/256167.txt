This is quite good, albeit, I don't remember what hoisin sauce tastes like. I used gluten free soy and played around with the substitutions in the notes. As written, the peanut flavor is bold. I made a batch using black bean paste and even tried one with a bit of both. They were all good. I also preferred molasses to honey. I used szechuan peppers instead of black. Thank ypu for the recipe.

Used this in the Thai chicken thigh bake on this website, and it turned out great.
