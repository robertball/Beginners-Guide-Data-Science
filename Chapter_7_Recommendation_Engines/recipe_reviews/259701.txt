I was liberal on the pumpkin portion. It made for a good flavour. When putting the batter in the muffin trays, I made the first batch as directed. All the cheese cake filling stayed on top. Second batch I added a lot less cake batter then filling, with more cake batter over top. This gave a better look and more mixture throughout the cupcake.

We liked the recipe but the pumpkin flavor was not there. These just tasted like a large Black Bottom ...which we love.  I plan to make them again adding more pumpkin puree or maybe some pumpkin spice.
