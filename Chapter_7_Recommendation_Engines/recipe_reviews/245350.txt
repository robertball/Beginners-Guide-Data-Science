I was craving cinnamon rolls, but didn't want to spend a ton of time on them, and happened to have crescent rolls. This is so delicious and so easy! As the other reviewer said, definitely halve both the cinnamon-brown sugar mix and the icing mix. I didn't have dark brown sugar so I used light brown, and it was amazing. Btw, this amount was perfect for my family of four (2 kids, 2 adults).

These were super easy to throw together. I used two packages of crescents and had a ton of cinnamon and sugar left over. I would half that so there is not as much waste. I also cut the icing in half after realizing how much sugar mix I had leftover. I will definitely make these again when my kids are in need of a quick fix!

Super easy and very tasty!  I used double the cresent rolls (so two tubes) with the amount of filling and frosting and it was perfect.  I also divided the frosting into two bowls and added a little peanut butter to one half...so yummy!

5 stars with my modifications. :) The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. The second time, I improved it! 
-make sure crescent dough is cold and NOT getting to be room temperature 
-use the recipe creations sheets of dough instead of those for actual crescent rolls
-the filling makes enough for TWO batches of rolls...do not overfill!

I made these last weekend, and I had a little too much sugar in them. I could taste the graininess of the brown sugar. I'm going to make them again this weekend and use less brown sugar, and maybe cream a little butter in with the brown sugar. Thanks for posting a super easy and delish cinnamon roll!

I also had way too much cinnamon,brown sugar.  Will halve next time.  I spread butter on the squares before sprinkling with the sugar mixture as that's what my Mom always did when making homemade cinnamon rolls.  For the frosting/glaze, instead of vanilla I used mango orange juice as we prefer the orange glazed cinnamon rolls.  Will make this again.

It was a good recipe, but the measurements seem to be a bit off. I did put butter on the whole rectangle I rolled out and just sprinkled on cinnamon and sugar. Rolled it back up and sliced. The time in the oven was perfect and the icing was good!

Good but too much sugar/cinnamon. Next time I will cut the brown sugar and cinnamon in half and add 3 tablespoons of butter. Also, I rolled from the short end and cut each log into 3 rolls to make medium-sized buns. They worked much better that way.

The recipes calls for at least twice as much dark brown sugar than can possibly be used.  These roll up better with much less mixture.  The glaze is okay for a quick fix, but not very tasty alone.  If making for the first time, plan on a trial run before the batch you plan to serve.

These are great, quick and fairly easy.  I agree w/other reviewers that the filling is too much - think it must be meant for two cans crescent rolls.  The first time, I made as instructed (except for cutting back on filling).  The second time, I spread a little liquid butter on the dough which helped to keep the filling from falling/oozing out.  I cut each into eight pieces which might be a little small for some, but made nice bite size rolls.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are so good!!! And so easy it took a few minutes and I took the advice of the others and halved the brown sugar cinnamon filling . So much easier than making the dough like in the past and really not much of a difference in flavor. Great use of crescent dough.

This was very good. I did do what others had suggested and did half of the glaze and even that was a bit much.  It was a fun, easy project to do with my daughter. I would make this again.

These turned out pretty darn good!  Like other folks I halved both the filling & frosting, & I still have filling leftover which I'll reserve for another batch.  I took 'em out of the oven @ about 11 minutes, but next time I'll check 'em by 9 minutes.  Very tasty indeed, a real nice fix for a sweet tooth with little effort.  I'll be whipping up a batch of these the next time my girlfriends & I get together  :)  .

Typical cinnamon roll from pre made dough. Nothing special but easy if you are craving cinnamon and/or sugar.

I made the filling exactly as directed but didnt use all of it. I think I used maybe 1/3 in my rolls. The rest has been saved for future use. That being said, these came out really good. Unfortunately, I forgot to buy milk so I couldn't make the icing. Fortunately, I had some left over cream cheese frosting in my fridge that I stuck in the micro to melt and drizzle alll over my rolls! What a great, quick, easy breakfast this turned out to be for me and my honey!
