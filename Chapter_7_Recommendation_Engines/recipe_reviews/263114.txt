For everyone butchering the caramel (this guy), trick is to add a 1/4 cup of water to sugar before you start. Put on medium heat. Do not stir, do not swirl, do not jostle when it gets to boiling. If you have a candy thermometer clip one on and wait until you either hit around 340 degrees f or the sugar has turned Amber. Once amber/at 340 go ahead and stir. Other then that rest of the instructions were great.

I almost donâ€™t have much to say. A super-simple and effective recipe. Flan came out great even though I think I took the sugar slightly past where it should have been (yeah, I was on the edge of burning it.

Loved this recipe!  Followed it exactly without any changes and it came out perfect!  Just a tip for getting the flan out of the jars...once you have it flipped over with the plate on top, give it a FIRM shake, and it will pop right out!

I had a little bit of caramel still left in the bottom after flipping it over that I used to drizzle on the white plate over the flan.  I added some fresh whipped cream to the top and a few colored sprinkles (since I was making this at the holidays).  BAM - yummy and impressed the guests!

LOVED this! Watch that you don't overcook the sugar, I added a little water, stirred once,  then let the stove do it's thing.  I used a silicone brush dipped in water to get the sugar off the sides of the pan.  Worked great.  Such an easy and delicious dessert!  
thanks for sharing.

I've made this a few times and it's yummy!! I will say every time, I've overcooked the sugar. Not sure why, it could be the sugar, it could be me. Will try a slightly different technique with the sugar next time to see if I can improve it. It comes out rock solid with a bit of caramel that seeps into the flan. Ha! Over all, good stuff!

I did not have a Sous vide cooker..or 4 oz jars, but I did have the 8 oz sized jars.  I still divided the recipe into 8 jars, I baked in the oven in a water bath. Turned out very nice, very pretty and tasty! The recipe is a little sweet for me, but very good:)
