I used this over the holidays.  It was good.  Next time I may use more horseradish, but overall, it was excellent.

I added a little more horseradish, garlic salt, and dill - - it was very good.  I can see where it might taste better the next day, as the flavors have more time to meld!  It was very good - and I would make it again!

This was easy to whip up and you could jazz it up with an assortment of different crackers.  My friends asked for the recipe.

As other posters noted, this is a tad bland for my tastes so added 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce for a bit more robust flavor.

This is one of my FAVORITE quick dip recipes.  I prefer using creamy horseradish (1-2 tablespoons) and extra dill than called for in this recipe.  Additionally, for a crowd, I double the recipe and serve it in round pumpernickle (or rye, or whatever) bread that I have hollowed out - reserving the chunks of bread to scoop out the dip.  Delicious!

My husband thought this was very good. I found it to be a little bland, lacking a zing flavor, will try to doctor it up a little next time.

Very tasty with Salt & Papper potato chips!  I doubled this.  I did not have horseradish, so I used a few good size squirts of Stone ground mustard with horseradish (very good idea-yum!!).  I had green onions, so I used those.  My cream cheese was the whipped kind, so I did not need to add the milk.  Although I doubled this, I only used one jar of the beef and added a few shakes of Lawry's seasoned salt.  With or without the black olives, this is some good stuff!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I really liked this but added 1/2 cup sour cream which helped the mixture be a bit lighter.

This is good but I ended up adding more horseradish an dill after tasting. It definitely gets more flavorful as it sits so plan ahead.
