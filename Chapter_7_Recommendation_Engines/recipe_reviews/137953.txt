I loved his recipe.  I did change a couple of things.  I steeped the chai tea bags in simmering milk instead of water, I added some cardomon, cloves, cinnamon,and ginger to get a speckled effect. I also added two tablespoons of powdered meringue to get a stiffer consistency. Yum!

The flavor is excellent when using Stash's Premium Chai Spice Black Tea. My only gripe is that my batch turned out a bit runny and has more the consistency of the icing you'd find on cinnamon buns. I added a lot of extra powdered sugar and still couldn't get it to stiffen quite right. I'm tossing it in the fridge to cool down before trying to crumb coat with it. For those wanting a truly yummy chai flavor, might I suggest trying to work with the powdered chai mix from Tasteful Simply? It's called Oh My! Chai, and has been my absolute favorite chai of all of the various brands I've tasted. The fact that it is a powdered mix instead of tea bags might work to the advantage of stiffening the mix a bit too. I would have used it today, but alas, I am out. - I am willing to give this recipe another try.

This buttercream is wonderful!! Especially on chocolate cake. Only one thing I had to change, you never want to put any tea into "boiling" water. Bring water to a boil, remove from heat, after it quits bubbling, then add tea bags.

This was nice for a frosting. The chai was subtle enough that it wasn't overwhelming but i also only used a tablespoon of the chai water. The recipe itself is huge and i think the proportions were off a little bit for the thickness i wanted for my cookies. I cut the recipe in half because i didnt need that much but it was so watery i had to keep adding more sugar. I would suggest mixing everything else first and then adding the sugar until you get the consistency you want.

Great frosting recipe when it comes to the consistency. I've tried two other recipes on here that were crapola, but this once has a great, firm texture. I give it 4/5 stars, however, because I personally didn't find the taste of the chai to be strong enough over the sugar (I combated this by adding extra cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove). I'll definitely reference this one again.

It was really good! Everyone in my family enjoyed it! Though I didn't have chai tea in bags, so I put 1 1/2 tbsp in the milk heated it and let it cool then put it in! Thanks for the recipe!!

Didn't have much of a true Chai taste to it. I added ground cinnamon and settled on it as a vanilla with a subtle taste of Chai...perhaps using less sugar would solve the problem? It yields quite a bit of icing as it is.

Loved the flavor. I had to alter the recipe slightly - I only used about 1/3 of the milk and tea liquid because more then that would have made the icing way too liquidy (especially if you want to try and pipe with it). I used Bigelow Vanilla Chai Tea and the flavor of the icing was so yum.

As an icing this is really good, it's a bit soft for a true buttercream. I added one extra tea bag to my 1/4 c water and I could just taste the tea. I might even suggest using 4 tea bags if you want a noticeable chai flavor. I used this to fill and crumb coat my birthday cake, then I covered it with the rolled buttercream fondant. Very good!

This was an "OK" recipe in my book. It was very thin, did not hold it's shape when piped from decorating bag with tip. Everyone did enjoy the flavor, but I was disappointed with the texture and consistency. I made it with yellow cupcakes, added french vanilla pudding to cake mix. Decorated with small amount of frosting and topped with a glazed walnut and a dusting of cinnamon. Might try again, depending upon request for these cupcakes again or not.

The only reason I did not give 5 stars was because the flavor was very light.  I was expecting more of a Chai flavor.  Also when I added the powdered sugar it  didn't mix with the whipped butter, so I had to add the liquid right away.

 However the frosting has a nice flavor that would be good on carrot cake, in place of cream cheese

I liked the flavor of this a lot. It was a little too runny without adding more powdered sugar, which hid the chai flavor. A great solution when you don't have all the right chai spices on hand!

Even though this recipe is for 12 cupcakes it seemed like a bit much, so I halved it.  For me 1/2 was perfect for 12 cupcakes.  I took another review's advice to add cardamom to my frosting to add more taste.  I think next time I might actually double the amount of tea bags that I use because I would have liked a better punch of flavor.  But my coworkers gave me good reviews.

It tastes great.  I would only suggestion that you steep tea bags in 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of water combined, it makes frosting mutch fluffier. Over all a great recipie.

I liked this idea and it pairs well with a yellow cake, but the consistency was just too loose.  I tweeked it a bit by adding a little more margarine and less sugar, while adding a dash of salt (subdues the overwhelming buttery flavor and sweetness).

I really liked this recipe but it doesn't taste enough like chai. I added clove to the recipe and it was amazing. Matched with a dark chocolate cupcake they were perfect

Definitely not bad. I doctored it up like other reviewers with cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg to help bring out the taste. I also simmered in milk. 

The consistency "problem" other experienced will be solved if you add only some of the sugar in first, than pour the chai in tablespoons and repeat. Or at least that helped me.

Downside-this has a very definite buttery taste. May need to add additional flavoring to bring out more of the chai.

Note - I have not made this frosting. I was intrigued and read the reviews and came to some conclusions.

1. Chai spices are: cinnamon, clove, cardamom. Some optional spices are black pepper and star anise. I think the base 3 are a very nice set for chai. 

2. For the tea flavor, I think an extract (don’t know if one exists) would be best. Otherwise an instant unsweetened tea powder is probably best for consistency. 

Doing those changes would make altering a simple vanilla buttercream recipe into a chai flavored one much easier. It also seems it would help to reduce the sweet factor because it appears the additional powdered sugar is being used to offset the larger amount of liquid in this recipe.
