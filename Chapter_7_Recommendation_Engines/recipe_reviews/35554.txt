I have been making Turkey Patties for a number of years.  This is a good addition to anyone's recipe box.  HOWEVER, I always add very finely chopped mushrooms to the mixture.  This adds the needed moisture to the pattie, as well flavor.

I thought this was very good, I added 1/2 cup of water and put it in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour to let the bread crumbs absorb the water, otherwise it will come out dry also it let the the flavors blend.  I changed the soy sauce to light soy, the egg to egg beaters.  It was a really good change from beef.

I found this recipe when I wanted to use up the last of my green onions and some ground turkey. It was so good, full of flavor and far from dry (even when reheated).  I did add a tablespoon of water becuase I was wary of it being dry. I didn't add any ginger either! And I used Pam instead of oil to cook the patties in a skillet.  I served it with brown rice and a vege. IT turned out great!  My fiance loved it, and he ain't a fan of ground turkey (becuase the texture is so much different from that of ground beef, but he said the flavor trumped the texture!). My coworkers liked it too, and asked for the recipe.  This will be used often in my household!

I thought this was great.  I went without the onion (used onion powder) and used ground ginger instead of the ginger root, and added some ground mustard - skipped the parsley.  Very pleased with the results.  Think I could get my family to actually eat ground turkey with this recipe, and that's saying alot.

This was a FABULOUS new way to use ground turkey!  My whole family absolutly enjoyed every bite!  Fresh flavors of garlic and ginger really make this an eye opener!  Thank you so much for the new idea!  We've made it twice since I found this recipe 1 week ago!

These were delicious! I read the other reviews and if your gonna use turkey, you gotta use a little olive oil in the pan, so they don't dry out, especially if you use all turkey breast. And be careful not to overcook. I used ginger paste from the jar and dried minced onion instead of fresh. There were no leftovers.

I just made these and I think the flavors hold a lot of promise. I can't speak to the texture because I made mine super soft for my toddler by adding milk-soaked bread. Despite the fact that I doubled the garlic, added a small amount of salt, pepper, and sesame oil, they were still a bit bland. The next time I make this I am going to add more of all the flavor ingredients I used this time (garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, pepper, and salt). By the way, for those of you that find the meat dry, you might want to try a trick suggested by Cook's Illustrated: add 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese for each 1.25 lbs of 93% lean ground turkey. They say it makes the burgers moist and chewy.

I thought this was very good, mine didn't turn out dry.  I grilled them on my George Foreman to good effect. I had about 1.3 lbs. of ground turkey and was able to make 8 smallish burgers just perfect for the 8 smallish Weight Watchers buns I had.  I was very pleased to be able to make a patty and a bun for 200 calories, not to mention making two nights' dinner for our family of four in one night.

This were really good, I mixed the green onion with some yellow onion and also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  We cooked them outside on the grill which turned out excellent, but put them on tray to make sure they wouldn't fall apart.

This was just Okay.  I would not buy turkey to make this.  We had leftovers and tried it.  I added a second egg, but only the white.  Make this ONLY if you can't find another way to use up leftover turkey

My family didn't like these at all.  We're trying to find alternatives to red meat every now and then, but they weren't very receptive to this recipe.  It was somewhat dry, and the garlic taste just didn't seem to work.

Pretty tasty!  It came out a little dry for me.  I may try 2 eggs next time to see if that helps.  My husband said it wasn't too dry for him at all.  Also, he actually thanked me for making this.  He appreciated my trying to "broaden his horizons" a little.  My 4 year old ate it right up.  The 20 month old wouldn't touch it, but she's in a picky phase lately.

I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand, so I just used a little dry ground ginger instead.  Tasted fine.

Will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe, Michele!

These are fast, easy-to-make, and tasty.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I substituted matzo meal for the bread crumbs (which I couldn't find) and used 1/2 cup of that instead of 1/4 cup because the raw meat mixture seemed kind of soupy.

If you don't love these, maybe you're not making them correctly. They were VERY flavorful - the best turkey burgers I've ever had. I sauted extra onions and garlic and put that on top with tomato. No condiments necessary!

I made these burgers with ground chicken and it was very tasty.  My husband really enjoyed them also and asked me to keep this recipe.  My finicky 3 and 5 year old also liked these.  I'll definitely be making these again.

We didn't have the ginger, so we didn't use it, but they were still delicious! I also added mushrooms, thanks to the suggestion below, and it was great. I will make again.

They were pretty good.  Took more than 5 minutes on each side.  Maybe my stove was not as hot.

Amazingly moist! Used white onion instead if green, and ginger powder. I also added about a tablespoon Dijon mustard.   Will be making again! Served on whole grain bun with Swiss.

I make turkey patties for dinner about 1-2 times a week but was looking for a turkey patty recipe to use up some extra green onions. I omitted the ginger and parsley because I didn't have any. The trick to make these juicy and crispy on the outside is to heat up your pan and oil really hot then cook the patties on one side and flip only once. If you're not familiar with cooking turkey it is tricky- turkey cooks much faster than beef. The fresh garlic and soy sauce really made these taste unique!

I made this recipe for the 4th of July weekend.  I loved it!  They were moist and had a lot of flavor!  I cooked it on the grill rather than pan cooking it.I will definitely make this again.

My children loved this! My one super picky child actually ate one whole patty and didn't say it was disgusting after tasting one crumb like she usually does! That is real accomplishment for me. This was easy to make, I didn't have to slave away in the kitchen only for my kids to take one bite and not like it. I used leftover cooked turkey and put it in the food processor, and skipped the parsley since my kids would never eat anything with "green stuff" in it. It was a success! Thank you!
