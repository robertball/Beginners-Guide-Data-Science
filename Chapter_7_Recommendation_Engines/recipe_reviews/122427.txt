This was good. I used a little less than 1tsp of the cayanne for extra kick. The sauce came out great. I let the meat/tomatoe mixture simmer for about 20 min before adding to the noddles and baking. I used whole wheat pasta and didnt think that there was enough sauce. Maybe it was the whole wheat pasta. Next time Ill either half the pasta or double the sauce.

This is a great dish to serve to a crowd. I added a clove or 2 of garlic instead of the garlic powder. Also, I increased the sauce to a 15 oz can to make it a little less dry. Awesome recipe!

Unfortunately, I found this dish to be rather dry and the flavor is bland.

I thought this recipe had a good flavor.  I added carrots, mushrooms, and celery as well because this seemed like a good recipe to sneak veggies in for my family.  There isn't a lot of sauce, so I would decrease the amount of pasta next time, but overall will make this again.

We love this recipe and have been making it for several years.  How thrilled I was to find it here when I lost my original copy of it!  Even my kids who are not crazy about regular spaghetti are happy when I make this.  I often used ground turkey instead of beef, and I leave out the olives (personal preference.)  I usually make two dishes, and freeze one for later.

I made two large pans of this for a Halloween party lasy year. Everyone raved about it and asked me to bring it again this year. I have also made this many times for potlucks and it always gets eaten right up. I think it is a five star for feeding a group. It looks good and taste fabulous!

Good basic food. Wasn't picky about getting the tomatoes right, just tried to keep the texture (fresh tomatoes and mashed, peeled tomatoes). Moisture was ok with extra third of tomato mix. Also put in more seasoning. Stirring might be needed after 15min to prevent the spaghettis from drying up. Good base for experimenting.

I have used this recipe for years for family gatherings and pot lucks at church.  Always a hit!  It is also a great alternative for same old spaghetti.  Very easy to make.  The kids love it!

This was very good. I only gave it four stars because I did make some changes based on personal taste and what I had on hand. Firstly, I added a finely diced cherry bomb pepper to the green pepper/onion/meat mixture. I also chopped 3 small cloves of garlic instead of using the garlic powder. The tomatoes I used had diced green chiles in them, I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and used ground turkey instead of beef because those were what I had on hand. I doubled the cayenne because we like it spicy and added about a teaspoon of oregano, basil and crushed red pepper. It was sweet and spicy. I will be making this again.

We had this last night for dinner and thought it was pretty good for an easy weeknight meal.  I made the recipe exactly as written.

I just whipped this up and it is quick and tasty!  I used tomato soup as some one suggested because that is what I had on hand.

I have made this once before, but lost my recipe. This is a great dish if you are tired of the same old spaghetti. I also added chopped mushrooms, black olives, and slices of italian sausage links. There is only three in our family and we seldomly have leftovers :)

Ok, I was just about to give this recipe two stars because it was so dry, but I re-read it and realized that I used 16 oz. of spaghetti instead of the 12 oz. it calls for.  I added a second can of tomato sauce to the leftovers and doing that made it taste pretty good.

Though the flavour of the recipe was good, it was still rather bland.  We likes the sweetness that the brown sugar added.  If you have kids who are fussy eaters, this might be a good thing.  However, even with extra cayenne and paprika added, it still lacked the zip we were used to in the spaghetti sauce we regularly make.  And really, this casserole is basically spaghetti, only it takes longer to make!  If you want to try this recipe, I suggest making the sauce separately and using it as such, skipping the 30 minute bake time.

This was a wonderful meal.  I will definitely make this instead of my traditional spaghetti sauce, which takes much longer to cook.  There's a lot you can do here to tweak the dish to your liking.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, omitted the salt, and used a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  My husband went back for seconds but next time I will cut down on the cayenne pepper since it was a little too spicy for my kids.
